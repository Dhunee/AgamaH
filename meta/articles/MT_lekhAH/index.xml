When did human rituals begin? As a ritualist and evolutionary explorer this question has naturally attracted my attention. My own contention is that the genetico-memetic complex of ritual probably goes back to our common ancestor with the African Great Apes or even beyond to the common ancestor of the Great Apes. In this context, the Bushmen of Africa are of particular interest because they are the earliest branching line of humans alive today.</description>

paramparA So impressed was Jung by the mental patients that he believed the origins of myth lay in mental disease. With this conclusion Jung set rolling many a modern western critique of myth.
The first sterile offshoot was that of Freud, whose own ‘diseased mind’ produced certain unfalsifiable constructs that he used to deconstruct myth. Freud’s many successors live in a certain dark world where the light of scientific practice has still not shone.</description>

      <description>In general these are texts I&amp;rsquo;d recommend educated religiously inclined H to study texts of heathen cultures comparable to ours:
the yasht-s of the old Iranians; then others in order: The Homeric hymns &amp;amp; thereafter the Orphic hymns &amp;amp; the hymns of Proclus. The Iguvine tablets, Vergil Herculean hymn, Carmen Arvale. Aspects of the Poetic Edda. Papyri Graecae Magicae Hittite incantation texts. Egyptian Book of Dead &amp;amp; temple texts; Hymn to Enlil etc Mesopotamian material.</description>
