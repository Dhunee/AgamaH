Those receiving mantrashAstra education should acquire special stava-s beyond those meant for lay devotees. These stava-s are essentially core to the personal practice of the deshika along with his yoga. These are very important for the development of the deshika as a mantra-vAdin. E.g. for saiddhAntika-Shaiva I would say the pa~nchAvarNa stava and vyapohanastava are a must. gUDha-dhyana on the deities unfolding in them is of highest importance to the practice. 

Finally, as I have earlier clarified to @goghritaM there might be sAdhaka-s who primarily develop as yogin-s on the siddha track with acquisition of mantra-siddhi-s and those who primarily develop as vidvAn-s with little mantra-siddhi-s. As abhinavagupta laid out the latter is more important for the system as they preserve tradition. Hence, even though the first might look immensely charismatic to the lay devotee it is important that the system focus on development of the latter, and ensure that the siddha-s don't stray out of the bounds of the system.

In the end we have to realize that many of our old mantravAdin-s were polymaths of high standing. Think of bhojadeva, aghorashiva, shivadAsasena, vyomashiva etc.  Hence, we should aim high with the objective of also providing an education system for supporting such.

## matsyendra
I think matsyendra was unique: as the yuganAtha he was both paNDita &siddha at the same time. Not a paNDita in the sense of 1 who writes in masterly Skt but 1 who boldly writes his insights as a systematic text as the sole author rather than contributing to an Agamika compendium. In this regard he is rather unique; there were some other like that on both on our side that of the bAhya-s. However, the majority of his apabhraMsha-using successors, irrespective of the force of their charyAgIti-s were mostly in the siddha mold.
