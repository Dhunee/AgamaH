One thing many fellow traditional Hindus have found frustrating about me is my lack knowledge and lack of affinity for the advaita stream of vedanta, and more fundamentally me being a svatantra. My blasphemous views regarding vedas and their apauruSheyatva are also hardly appreciated in their midst. I am not shaken by their views because I am pretty firm in my convictions on these matters arising from ongoing study of the originals, and yAj~navalya always stands out as beacon.</description>

When did human rituals begin? As a ritualist and evolutionary explorer this question has naturally attracted my attention. My own contention is that the genetico-memetic complex of ritual probably goes back to our common ancestor with the African Great Apes or even beyond to the common ancestor of the Great Apes. In this context, the Bushmen of Africa are of particular interest because they are the earliest branching line of humans alive today.</description>

The Wodeyar of Mysore, kR^iShNa rAja, prepared a compendium of Hindu iconography from diverse classical Hindu sources. This collation called the shrI-tattva-nidhI (STN) has become a useful standard for upAsaka-s in amongst educated Hindus, especially from Southern India. Sadly, the full text is not easily accessible these days. It is useful to examine the succinct descriptions of iconography that he provides in his text.
The STN is divided into 9 chapters:</description>

      <title>“Tantric” upaniShad-s and their role in Hindu thought</title>

The point of origin of the later sectarian upaniShads is unclear. It appears that the early shaiva-s and vaiShNava-s had begun the composing upaniShadic material in the latest phase of the vedic era. The oldest amongst these is the shaiva-leaning upaniShad- shvetAshvatara, which incorporates several verses from the shatarudriya of the kR^iShNa-yajurveda. The atharva-shiras and the nArAyaNa-valli seem to the next set of upaniShads composed by the shaivas and vaiShNavas respectively.</description>

The shrIvidyArNava is an excellent tAntric manual that was used as textbook for mantra shAstra instruction amongst certain brahminical schools. It contains 2 halves called pUrva and uttara ardha-s of 18 chapters called shvAsas each. It runs into 1459 devanagari print pages to give an idea of its size. It is a digest for a wide range of material from ancient tantras that appear to be lost. One of these is the kukkuTeshvara tantra, whose prayogas are still remembered by several practioners even if only in fragments.</description>

      <title>Agama-mImAMsA</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/AgamaH/meta/MT_lekhAH/Agama-mImAMsA/</link>

      <description>Some traditions developed their own unified theory similar to mImAMsA: e.g. parshurAma-kalpasUtra-s for the shrIkula tradition. abhinavagupta&amp;rsquo;s tantrAloka can be seen as another such synthesis.
However, the main issue is the basic focal &amp;amp;/ sectarian nature of most tAntrika traditions. Hence, 1 could complain that these works are narrow &amp;amp; not overarching like mImAMsA addresses the vaidika ritual. In that sense we align with the the message of thread.
However, as a smArta, while I&amp;rsquo;m a (low level) practitioner of the tAntrika religion, like many of my ilk over the centuries we have an inclination for an overarching structure with mImAMsA akin to that done in the older vaidika religion.</description>

      <title>siddha vs paNDita</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/AgamaH/meta/MT_lekhAH/siddha_vs_paNDita/</link>

      <description>Importance of vidvAn-s As I have earlier clarified to @goghritaM there might be sAdhaka-s who primarily develop as yogin-s on the siddha track with acquisition of mantra-siddhi-s and those who primarily develop as vidvAn-s with little mantra-siddhi-s. As abhinavagupta laid out the latter is more important for the system as they preserve tradition. Hence, even though the first might look immensely charismatic to the lay devotee it is important that the system focus on development of the latter, and ensure that the siddha-s don&amp;rsquo;t stray out of the bounds of the system.</description>

      <description>Those receiving mantrashAstra education should acquire special stava-s beyond those meant for lay devotees. These stava-s are essentially core to the personal practice of the deshika along with his yoga. These are very important for the development of the deshika as a mantra-vAdin. E.g. for saiddhAntika-Shaiva I would say the pa~nchAvarNa stava and vyapohanastava are a must. gUDha-dhyana on the deities unfolding in them is of highest importance to the practice.</description>
