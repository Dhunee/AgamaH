A selection from the Orphic Argonautika showing elements of yavana soothsaying and ritual.

> And you have learned the ways of divination by beasts and birds,  
> and what the order of entrails,  
> and what is presaged in their dream-roaming paths by souls of mortals overcome in sleep;  
> answers to signs and portents, the stars' courses, the purification rite, great blessing to men, placation of gods, and offerings poured out for the dead.
