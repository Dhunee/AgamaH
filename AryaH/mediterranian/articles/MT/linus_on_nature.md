Linus: “On the nature of the world” 

So through discord all things are steered through all.  
From the whole are all things, all things form a whole,  
all things are one, each part of all, all in one;  
for from a single whole all these things came, and from them in due time will one return,  
that's ever one and many... 

Often the same will be again, no end will limit them, ever limited...  
For so undying death+++(5)+++ invests all things,  
all dies that's mortal,  
but the substrate was and is immortal ever, fashioned thus,  
yet with strange images and varied form  
will change and vanish from the sight of all.
