Socrates: Is it not well to pray to the deities here before we go?  
Phaedrus: Of course.  
Socrates: O beloved Pan and all ye other Gods of this place, grant to me that I be made beautiful in my soul within, and that all external possessions be in harmony with my inner man. May I consider the wise man rich; and may I have such wealth as only the self-restrained man can bear or endure. Do we need anything more, Phaedrus? For me that prayer is enough.  
Phaedrus: Let me also share in this prayer; for friends have all things in common.

(Plato, Phaedrus 279b-c, trans. H. N. Fowler)
