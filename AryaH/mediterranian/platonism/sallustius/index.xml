      <description>On the Gods and The World by Sallustius
Translation by Gilbert Murray in Five Stages of Greek Religion
What the disciple should be; and concerning Common Conceptions Those who wish to hear about the Gods should have been well guided from childhood, and not habituated to foolish beliefs. They should also be in disposition good and sensible, that they may properly attend to the teaching.
They ought also to know the common conceptions.</description>

      <description>Some of the Hermetic sage Sallustius&amp;rsquo;s views &amp;ldquo;On the Gods and the world&amp;rdquo; are extremely valuable in understanding the deva-s. Sallustius was a friend of the revered Roman emperor Caesar Julian the Apostate, who tried but ultimately failed to restore deva-dharma and was murdered by a Christian. Below are some pertinent quotes from a translation by Gilbert Murray in Five Stages of Greek Religion.
Gods are unchanging, unbegotten, eternal.  &amp;ldquo;Neither are they separate from the first cause nor from one another, just as thoughts are not separate from mind nor acts of knowledge from the soul.</description>
