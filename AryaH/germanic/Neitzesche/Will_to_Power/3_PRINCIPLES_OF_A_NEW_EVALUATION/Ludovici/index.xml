      <description>1 THE WILL TO POWER IN SCIENCE.
 (a) The Method of Investigation.
  The distinguishing feature of our nineteenth century is not the triumph of science, but the triumph of the scientific method over science.
  The history of scientific methods was regarded by Auguste Comte almost as philosophy itself.
  The great Methodologists: Aristotle, Bacon, Descartes, Auguste Comte.
  The most valuable knowledge is always discovered last: but the most valuable knowledge consists of methods.</description>

      <description>2 THE WILL TO POWER IN NATURE.
   The Mechanical Interpretation of the World.
   Of all the interpretations of the world attempted heretofore, the mechanical one seems to-day to stand most prominently in the front. Apparently it has a clean conscience on its side; for no science believes inwardly in progress and success unless it be with the help of mechanical procedures. Every one knows these procedures: &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo; are allowed to remain out of consideration as far as possible; it is shown that, provided a sufficient amount of time be allowed to elapse, everything can evolve out of everything else, and no one attempts to suppress his malicious satisfaction, when the &amp;ldquo;apparent design in the fate&amp;rdquo; of a plant or of the yolk of an egg, may be traced to stress and thrust in short, people are heartily glad to pay respect to this principle of profoundest stupidity, if I may be allowed to pass a playful remark concerning these serious matters.</description>

      <description>3 THE WILL TO POWER AS EXEMPLIFIED IN SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL.
   Society and the State.
   We take it as a principle that only individuals feel any responsibility. Corporations are invented to do what the individual has not the courage to do. For this reason all communities are vastly more upright and instructive, as regards the nature of man, than the individual who is too cowardly to have the courage of his own desires.</description>

      <description>4 THE WILL TO POWER IN ART.
  Our religion, morality, and philosophy are decadent human institutions. The counter-agent. Art.
  The Artist-philosopher. A higher concept of art. Can man stand at so great a distance from his fellows as to mould them? (Preliminary exercises thereto:—
  To become a self-former, an anchorite.
  To do what artists have done hitherto, i.e. to reach a small degree of perfection in a certain medium.</description>
