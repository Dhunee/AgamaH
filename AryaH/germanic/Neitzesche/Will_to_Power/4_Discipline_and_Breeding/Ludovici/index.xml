      <description>The Doctrine of the Order of Rank.
   In this age of universal suffrage, in which everybody is allowed to sit in judgment upon everything and everybody, I feel compelled to re-establish the order of rank.
  Quanta of power alone determine rank and distinguish rank: nothing else does.
  The will to power.—How must those men be constituted who would undertake this transvaluation?</description>

      <description>To him who is one of Nature&amp;rsquo;s lucky strokes, to, him unto whom my heart goes out, to him who is carved from one integral block, which is hard, sweet, and fragrant—to him from whom even my nose can derive some pleasure—let this book be dedicated.
He enjoys that which is beneficial to him.
His pleasure in anything ceases when the limits of what is beneficial to him are overstepped.</description>

      <description>My philosophy reveals the triumphant thought through which all other systems of thought must ultimately perish. It is the great disciplinary thought: those races that cannot bear it are doomed; those which regard it as the greatest blessing are destined to rule.
  The greatest of all fights: for this purpose a new weapon is required.
A hammer: a terrible alternative must be created. Europe must be brought face to face with the logic of facts, and confronted with the question whether its will for ruin is really earnest.</description>
