      <description>Preface (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
1
Of what is great one must either be silent or speak with greatness. With greatness&amp;ndash;that means cynically and with innocence.
2
What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism. This history can be related even now; for necessity itself is at work here. This future speaks even now in a hundred signs, this destiny announces itself everywhere; for this music of the future all ears are cocked even now.</description>

      <description>2 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim is lacking; &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; finds no answer.
3 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence when it comes to the highest values one recognizes; plus the realization that we lack the least right to posit a beyond or an in-itself of things that might be &amp;ldquo;divine&amp;rdquo; or morality incarnate.
This realization is a consequence of the cultivation of &amp;ldquo;truthfulness&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;thus itself a consequence of the faith in morality.</description>

      <description>57 (1884)
My friends, it was hard for us when we were young: we suffered youth itself like a serious sickness. That is due to the time into which we have been thrown&amp;ndash;a time of extensive inner decay and disintegration, a time that with all its weaknesses, and even with its best strength, opposes the spirit of youth. Disintegration characterizes this time, and thus uncertainty: nothing stands firmly on its feet or on a hard faith in itself; one lives for tomorrow, as the day after tomorrow is dubious.</description>
