      <description>PREFACE. Concerning great things one should either be silent or one should speak loftily:—loftily—that is to say, cynically and innocently.
What I am now going to relate is the history of the next two centuries. I shall describe what will happen, what must necessarily happen: the triumph of Nihilism. This history can be written already; for necessity itself is at work in bringing it about. This future is already proclaimed by a hundred different omens; as a destiny it announces its advent everywhere, for this music of to-morrow all ears are already pricked.</description>

      <description>Nihilism As an Outcome of the Valuations and Interpretations of Existence Which Have Prevailed Heretofore.
What does Nihilism mean?—That the highest values are losing their value. There is no bourne. There is no answer to the question: &amp;ldquo;to what purpose?&amp;rdquo;
Thorough Nihilism is the conviction that life is absurd, in the light of the highest values already discovered; it also includes the view that we have not the smallest right to assume the existence of transcendental objects or things in themselves, which would be either divine or morality incarnate.</description>

      <description>II.
CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN NIHILISM.
(a) Modern Gloominess.
My friends, we had a hard time as youths; we even suffered from youth itself as though it were a serious disease. This is owing to the age in which we were born—an age of enormous internal decay and disintegration which, with all its weakness and even with the best of its strength, is opposed to the spirit of youth. Disintegration—that is to say, uncertainty—is peculiar to this age: nothing stands on solid ground or on a sound faith.</description>
