      <description>THE WILL TO POWER
Excerpts
BOOK IV DISCIPLINE AND BREEDING
I. Order of Rank
 The Doctrine of Order of Rank  858 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
What determines your rank is the quantum of power you are: the rest is cowardice.
862 (1884)
A doctrine is needed powerful enough to work as a breeding agent: strengthening the strong, paralyzing and destructive for the world-weary.
The annihilation of the decaying races. Decay of Europe.</description>

      <description>1. The Doctrine of Order of Rank 854 (1884) In the age of suffrage universel, i.e., when everyone may sit in judgment on everyone and everything, I feel impelled to re establish order of rank.
855 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What determines rank, sets off rank, is only quanta of power, and nothing else.
856 (1885-1886)
.
The will to power.- How those men would have to be con stituted who took upon themselves this revaluation.</description>

      <description>1003 (Jan-Fall 1888)
To him that has turned out well, who does my heart good, carved from wood that is hard, gentle, and fragrant-in whom even the nose takes pleasure this book is dedicated.
He enjoys the taste of what is wholesome for him;
his pleasure in anything ceases when the bounds of the whole some are crossed;
he divines the remedies for partial injuries; he has illnesses as great stimulants of his life;</description>

      <description>1053 (1884)
My philosophy brings the triumphant idea of which all other modes of thought will ultimately perish. It is the great cultivating idea: the races that cannot bear it stand condemned; those who find it the greatest benefit are chosen to rule.
1054 (1885-1886)
The greatest of struggles: for this a new weapon is needed.
The hammer: to provoke a fearful decision, to confront Europe with the consequences: whether its will &amp;ldquo;wills&amp;rdquo; destruction.</description>
