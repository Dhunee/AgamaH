Herr Schopenhauer says: 

> "we are only that one eye of the world which looks out from all knowing creatures..."

mudgala bhArmyashva says: 

> "tvaM vishvasya jagatash chakShur indrAsi chakShuShaH |"  
> You O indra, are the [eye] of the entire universe, the eye of the eye.

While it is well known that Schopenhauer was influenced by H ideas, AFAIK he was not well-conversant with the RV. So this expression might be seen as convergent. We know that the idea of the universal eye is expressed in many ways in the earliest Vedic tradition. Some famous expressions of it apart from the above include 

1. the eye of mitra and varuNa:  ud u tyach chakShur mahi mitrayor AM eti priyaM varuNayor adabdham |
2. Eye of savitR^i: like the above identified with the sun: seen sUkta of eye: 10.158
3. the eye of agni agnir asmi janmanA jAtavedA ghR^itam me chakShur amR^itam ma Asan |
4. The eye of uShas: vishvAni devI bhuvanAbhichakShyA pratIchI chakShur urviyA vi bhAti |
5. The footprint of viShNu whose pervasion of the heaven is like that eye: divIva chakShur Atatam |


Actually, there is no evidence (at least known to me) that he drew from the old Germanic tradition. That strand of thought was largely lost in Germania & even now few people see the philosophical underpinnings in the surviving North Germanic material
