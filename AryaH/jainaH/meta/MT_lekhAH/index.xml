Continuing with our encounters with padubai (padmAvatI), we come to that expedition that opened to us the secrets of this deity. The our nAstIka astronomer acquaintance of the 3rd varNa had mentioned that there was a large idol of padmAvatI in the depression to the south of our city where also lay an old temple of rudra. That leader amongst the shUdra-s told us right then that he recalled that there also lay an old aniconic rock of padubai.</description>

Intro The jainas possess some interesting divergent variants of the canonical Indo-Aryan myths. The harivaMsha of jinasena and the triShaShThi-salaka-puruSha charita of hemachandra is a rather rich source for such mythic material. The jaina view postulated the existance of 63 salaka-puruShas or notable figures who are like spokes in the wheel of time. Not unexpectedly the 63 includes the 24 tirthankaras. Other than these there are 12 chakravartins who start with the great bhArata.</description>
