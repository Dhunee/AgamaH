Zoroastrianism (Mazdayasna) must be the only form of "monotheism" where the creator diety (Ahura Mazda) offers sacrifices to his own created beings. (Yasht 15) Or where the one God (Ahura Mazda) says that his own created beings are as worthy of worship as himself (Yasht 10). I find it very funny how so many modern day westernized Parsis or Iranian Shia converts actually believe "Zoroastrianism was the first monotheism!" Anyone with a basic understanding of Mazdayasna knows this is totally incorrect. Zoroastrianism was polytheistic dualism.

> "Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'Verily, when I created Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, O Spitama! I created him as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of prayer as myself, Ahura Mazda."

> "May he come to us for victory! May he come to us for good conscience! May he come to us for bliss! he, the awful and overpowering, worthy of sacrifice and prayer, not to be deceived anywhere in the whole of the material world, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures."

If Mitra is worthy of worship, worthy of sacrifice, worthy of prayer, what is he but not a God?

> "To him did the Maker, Ahura Mazda, offer up a sacrifice in the Airyana Vaejah, on a golden throne, under golden beams and a golden canopy, with bundles of baresma and offerings of full-boiling [milk]."
