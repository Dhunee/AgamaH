Abaris son of Seuthes is a likely non-Zoroastrian, Iranic ritualist operating among the yavana-s. We could see him as an Iranic &amp;ldquo;pAshupata&amp;rdquo;-like figure. He is said to have composed several works titled the
 Scythian oracles; The marriage of river Hebrus; Purificatory rites A prose theogony; Apollo&amp;rsquo;s coming to the Hyperboreans.  He is said to have been a contemporary of Pythagoras &amp;amp; the yavana-s record him as the author of numerous incantations, especially for medical use.</description>

      <description>In late antiquity many IE groups (India, Iran, Armenia, Germania, Rome to degree) converged to a triad (trimUrti) of &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; deities. The Armenian one is given as Aramazd, Anahit, and Vahagn. It is not identical to the Iranic one despite the Iranic origin of the names. It seems the Iranic names were superimposed onto the original Armenian ones. Thus, it may indeed be correct to assume that behind vahagn was the original Armenia indra-class deity.</description>
