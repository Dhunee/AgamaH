      <description>&amp;ldquo;From the fragments of the pre-Achaemenid Medians and Persians, and also to certain extant the later Parthians and shAkas we observe that the system based on the worship of the Aditya-s (though they are never called that) was the dominant one. Especially, mitra, varuNa, bhaga (who came to be widely transmitted throughout the ancient Iranic sphere - &amp;ldquo;bhAgdAd&amp;rdquo; to the Turks and mongols - &amp;ldquo;bhagaputra/ bhagAtur, ulAn bATar&amp;rdquo;).&amp;rdquo; MT1 &amp;ldquo;the mighty vAyu, even after zarathuShTra’s heterodox sweep, remained the first receiver of the haoma in the Iranian ritual.</description>

      <description>A sibling of the Arya deva-dharma, a child of the ancestral Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-Aryan. They shared several deva-s with the Arya-s.  Rituals  &amp;ldquo;Iranians, like their Indic counterparts, were largely un-iconic in public ritual to start with, probably using icons only in small private shrines.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;On the eastern front things were dramatically different, with Iranians receiving iconographic inputs not just from the Greeks but also Indians. For example vAyu of the Kushanas inherits his iconography from rudra in India.</description>

      <description>Mani the syncretic incarnation Mani&amp;rsquo;s (216-276/77) parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites.
Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the &amp;ldquo;Religion of Light&amp;rdquo;. Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and Jesus.</description>
