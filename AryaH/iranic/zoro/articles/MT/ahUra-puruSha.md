The samanid official Ahmad al-Jayhani  while a Mohammedan was suspected by some of his coreligionists to be a cryptic Manichaeist. He preserves an interesting Iranic fragment that we as practitioners of sister religion can immediately see cognancy with. The god Ahura Mazdha says: 

> I created the whole of this world from myself. I created the souls of the righteous from the hair of my head; the sky from my brain; nails & arms (?) from my forehead; the sun from my eye; the moon from my nose; the stars from my tongue; Sraosha &the rest of the Amesha spenta-s from my ear; the earth from the tendon of my foot.

Here the macranthropic puruSha is applied to Ahura Mazdha by the Iranians. A similar concept seems to have been transmitted by the early eastern Iranians to the chIna-s, who incorporated it as is in their origin mythology. Only one of the amesha-spenta-s or yazata-s the one deity mentioned by name is Sraosha. Sraosha was particularly popular in the Eastern Iranian reflex and syncretized with skanda for the Hindu votaries.
