It is now generally agreed that the Arab conquest of Iran in the seventh century A.D. was not achieved by a few great battles, but took more than a generation to accomplish; and that, although Islam was established thereby as the state religion, it needed some three hundred years, or nine generations, for it to become the dominant faith throughout the land. During this time the Zoro astrians continued to look for leadership to their high priest, the Dastur dastūrān, hereditary successor to the prelate who in the days of the Sasanian Empire had been head of the established church.</description>

ZOROASTER is the only founder of a great revealed religion who was a priest; and as such he clearly knew the value of observance, and therefore provided his followers with firm guidance for their devo tional lives. He himself, so the tradition says, was the author of the greatest of the Zoroastrian prayers, the Ahuna vairyo or Ahunvar, a brief utterance in honour of Ahura Mazda which is for the Zoro astrian what the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer is for the Christian.</description>

      <description>SOME INDIVIDUAL RITES OF PIETY AND CHARITY
IN one of the Rivayatst it is said that, if it were impossible, because of poverty, for anyone in a community to found a gahanbar, then all the faithful there should join together to celebrate what the writer calls a &amp;lsquo;gahāmbār-e toji&amp;rsquo;, to which each should contribute what he could. The literal meaning of tõjī is obscure, but the learned translator of the Rivayat sought to connect the word with one surviving in Persian as tõžī, used for a &amp;lsquo;schoolboys&amp;rsquo; picnic&amp;rsquo;, and with the verb tozīdan in the sense of &amp;rsquo;to gather, collect&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Down the centuries Zoroastrians have been called by those of other faiths &amp;lsquo;fire worshippers&amp;rsquo;, a name which thinking members of the community indignantly reject, saying that they worship only God. Fire, they declare, was appointed by Zoroaster simply as an object in whose presence men should pray, in order to fix their thoughts on righteousness—for fire, he taught, was the creation of Ardvahišt, the hypostasis of all that is right and just.</description>

      <title>05 THE LAWS AND RITES OF PURITY</title>

      <description>WHETHER one is concerned with acts of worship, or holy places, or simply patterns of daily living, one is bound to become involved with one or other of the laws of purity, for these affect all areas of Zoroastrian life. The purity code of this ancient faith is a complex one, and some of its elements plainly go back to distant, pre Zoroastrian times. These elements were developed and refined upon in the light of the prophet&amp;rsquo;s dualistic teachings, and new ones were added.</description>

      <description>WHEN death comes, Zoroastrians have two pressing duties: to dispose of the polluting corpse with care and celerity, according to strict rules, and to do everything possible to help the disembodied soul to reach heaven and be blessed. The first duty should be fulfilled within a day, the second should last at least thirty years&amp;ndash;a contrast which marks the difference in value between dead body and living soul, the one belonging to Ahriman, the other to Ohrmazd.</description>

      <description>THE SPRING NEW YEAR AND THE HUNDREDTH-DAY FEAST
The ancient Iranian calendar, observed, it seems, by Zoroastrians till the downfall of the Parthians, had twelve months of thirty days each, and accordingly slipped back steadily against the natural year, being the shorter by over five days. It was kept in accord with it, however, by the frequent insertion about once every six years, of a thirteenth month. This calendar was reformed under the first Sasanian king by the addition on the model of the Egyptian calendar) of five days set at the end of the year.</description>

      <description>SOME RITES OF EXPIATION OR COMFORT FOR THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
The words of their ancient holy texts were a source of immense comfort and strength to the Zoroastrians, who believed unquestion ingly that these had all been directly revealed by God to their prophet. They had faith that by uttering verses from them they could procure divine aid and blessings, and it was usual to say a prayer before embarking on any enterprise, whether this was sowing the new season&amp;rsquo;s crops or setting off on a bus journey to Yazd.</description>

      <description>THE FESTIVALS OF ALL SOULS AND THE RELIGIOUS NEW YEAR
UNTIL the beginning of the Sasanian era the ancient festival of All Souls, Hamaspathmaedaya, was evidently celebrated on the last night of the twelfth month, directly after the day&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the sixth gahambar. The spirits of the dead were entertained as honoured guests in their old homes throughout the hours of dark ness, and were then bidden a formal, ritual farewell at the dawn of the new year.</description>

      <description>ACCORDING to the Avesta, initiation into the Zoroastrian community, with full responsibility for one&amp;rsquo;s own religious and moral life, should take place at fifteen years of age (which in ancient Iran was regarded as the time of maturity). Among the Parsis this had been reduced to seven or eight, much as the age of confirmation has been reduced in some Christian communities, but the Irani villagers usually initiated their children at between twelve and fifteen years.</description>
