Btw, at their core, the Zoroastrian (Mazdean) & Vedic religions are about the same thing, that is, order (asha/rta/dharma) has to be maintained perpetually in a chaotic world, and this order is principally restored by engaging in relationships w the Gods focused around sacrifice. 

Ofc, they differ a good bit also, but they are the most similar to each other. It's like two sects of Christianity, obviously they will believe the same core things, but their differences will seem huge to each other as well, because they will differ on crucially important issues. 

Before some Mazdean chimes in to say "the Indo-Aryans also demonized Asuras" - well, not really. Asura was a title that meant "Lordly" in the RV/Avesta. Many of the Gods were called Asuras, but at the same time many an-Arya gods/spirits & an-Arya tribes were also called "Asura"

## varuNa-centredness
Early Mazdayasna can be thought of as a sect/sampradaya of the Vedic/IIr religion with a lot of its own internal evolution (the soteriology for one with the three soul tier is quite innovative) and a lot of "heresy" (choosing to reject lot of the common Gods, elevating Varuna).

> Persia and sindh (varuNa major in both) being next to each other seems non-coincidental.

Btw, I was reading the Avesta and found it interesting how often the dvandva of Mithra and Ahura Mazda comes up. Just like the Vedic dvandva MitraVaruna. Further proof that Ahura Mazda is indeed an alter ego of Varuna.
