      <description>ACCORDING to the Avesta, initiation into the Zoroastrian community, with full responsibility for one&amp;rsquo;s own religious and moral life, should take place at fifteen years of age (which in ancient Iran was regarded as the time of maturity). Among the Parsis this had been reduced to seven or eight, much as the age of confirmation has been reduced in some Christian communities, but the Irani villagers usually initiated their children at between twelve and fifteen years.</description>

      <description>Once the practice was established of giving the consecrated food-offerings for the dead to a dog, then this act, being very frequently performed, must gradually have merged with the ordinary daily feeding of herdand house-dog, and so have led to this being itself regarded as a rite which served the departed. The development was probably a slow one, but may well be very old. It must certainly have been firmly established before the downfall of the Sasanians, in order for it to be maintained by both branches of the Zoroastrian community down into modern times.</description>

      <description>The separation of the Zoroastrians from the rest of the community was enforced as thoroughly as possible by the Moslem authorities. Thus the &amp;lsquo;gors&amp;rsquo; were forbidden to take up crafts or professions which might bring them into contact with Moslems, and were in the main restricted to farming and labouring work.+++(4)+++ They had, moreover, to wear distinctive clothing, so that they could be instantly recognized and shunned. Traditionally Iranian peasants dressed in blue, 28 but Zoroastrian men were forbidden to wear this or any other colour, and had to have garments of undyed cotton or wool, with roughly tied headgear to mark their lowly state.</description>
