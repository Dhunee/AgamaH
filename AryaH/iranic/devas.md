- "From the fragments of the pre-Achaemenid Medians and Persians, and also to certain extant the later Parthians and shAkas we observe that the system based on the worship of the Aditya-s (though they are never called that) was the dominant one. Especially, mitra, varuNa, bhaga (who came to be widely transmitted throughout the ancient Iranic sphere - "bhAgdAd" to the Turks and mongols - "bhagaputra/ bhagAtur, ulAn bATar")."

- "The goddess aredvI sUrA anAhitA, the sarasvatI ortholog, was one of the Iranian deities to receive an iconic representation from very early on. ...  Like sarasvatI (also perhaps even the prototype of Pallas Athena, sarasvatI and anAhitA), she had a warrior aspect. "
