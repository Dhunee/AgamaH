      <description>Source: here.
It is clear that the chInas have had contact with the Indians over a long period and have imbibed various forms of Hindu thought. It is also well-known that the bauddha influence on the chIna-s was profound from the early phase of the foreign expansion of the bauddha-mata. Especially, the emphasis on the desha-bhASha as against the deva-bhASha in the transmission of the early bauddha doctrine resulted in a profound change amongst the chIna-s, which corressponded to the shift from the peculiar literary chIna-bhAsha to the colloquial chIna-bhASha, with incorporation of indic terminology in translation.</description>

      <title>rupAvalIya</title>

      <description>We first heard of a lankan text termed the rupAvalIya written in the 1000s of CE in a vulgar register of saMskR^ita in the works of Coomaraswamy Ananda. He thought is a H text. It has never been published but snippets have been described by him &amp;amp; lankan authors.
It is clear that it is text descending from a H smArta-shilpa source (perhaps of kali~Ngan vintage) that has been reworked into a bauddha context.</description>

      <description>The karaNDavyUha a counter-religious saugata text states that after emitting the deva-s from various parts of his body avalokiteshvara told rudra who had emerged from his forehead (lalATAn maheshvaraH |) that:
 भविष्यसि त्वं महेश्वरः कलियुगे प्रतिपन्ने कष्ट-सत्त्व-धातु-समुत्पन्न आदिदेव, आख्यायसे स्रष्टारं कर्तारम् +++(इव)+++।
at the start of the kaliyuga he would be known as the primal god who is the creater &amp;amp; agent of existence in the troubled sentient beings.</description>
