I've observed anti-hindus (esp. christians) attack "sati" (properly - anugamana), and hindus going on the defensive. A response I prefer is to proudly accept that practice as a noble choice in certain rare circumstances and point to famous non-hindu dramatizations. In this thread, let us collect such (Please add further high-quality ones).

- Lt. Shinji Takeyama and his wife Reiko  [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cCp4oM4io)  (For mature viewers only. A very moving and noble classic short film- incidentally involving anugamana.)
- Noble Brünnhilde after Siegfried in Wagner's Götterdämmerung [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhdVNvd7yKo)
- Diódōros's account - [Perseus](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0541%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D34)
  - Note that Diódōros described the Greeks as condemning the practice (calling it ἄγριος "wild" and χαλεπός "savage"), but the fact that Greek soldiers in the vicinity of India adopted this practice demonstrates that many non-Indians did indeed see something beautiful and noble in the practice, and it was not a practice forced upon people.
