      <description>Siva Caturmukha ´
The myth of Tilottamā
In chapter 203 of the Adiparvan ¯ of the Mahābhārata we are told that, in order to kill the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, who could only be killed by each other, Viśvakarman, ordered by Brahmā, creates a woman of unparallelled beauty. The Grandfather tells her to go to the two demons and to seduce them in order that they may kill one and other in their rivalry over her.</description>

      <description>Imagination, Imagery, and Image in Vedic and Saiva Initiation ´
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,
Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Matthew 25: 34 (cf. Ecclesiastes 10: 2)
Introduction
The transformation of the Vedic religion into new systems of belief and prac tice, early Hinduism for short, is a process of cultural change that, despite two centuries of research, has only partly been understood.</description>

By the middle of the sixth century the city of Kanauj seems to have emerged as the capital of the rising dynasty of the Maukharis under its king Īśānavarman. 1 This town, in the Sanskrit tradition named Kānyakubja/ Kanyakubja, is known from the Skandapurāṇa, and from this text only, as the seat of one of the Pāśupata lineages.</description>

      <description>The Descent of God in Gujarat and the Practice of Imitating God
Kauṇḍinya’s Panc˜ arthabh ¯ as¯.ya
Kuśika and the divine revelation
When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha, which has the form of a commentary (bhāṣya) on the Sūtras of the Pāśupata school (the Pāśupatasūtras (PS)), resembles a gospel in many respects.</description>

Introduction
The village of Nagarī is situated in the Chittorgarh District (Rajasthan), 11 km north of the famous fort. The present archaeological site lies to the south of the village on the right bank of the River Berach. The original citadel along the river extended further northwards and included the space presently occupied by the village (Plate 129).</description>
