## Legal disabilities 
-   Higher punishment for certain offences.
    -   For example: Adultry with a dvija woman, slander against a dvija.
    -   Attenuation: In several cases, a person of a higher varṇa was subject to greater prāyaścitta and daṇḍa. For example, Manu and Gautama require that a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya and a vaishya would respectively be fined eight, four and two times more respectively than a śūdra. Kātyāyana and Vyāsa make this principle a general rule for all offences.
-   A śūdra could not be a judge in high courts (if he was not a king, to be sure).
-   Lower punishments were prescribed for killing a śūdra.


## Limitations on social intercourse with dvija-s
-   brāhmaṇa-s could not accept alms from them or eat their cooked food in common circumstances, or even be touched by him.
    -   All this was earlier allowed in some cases, but was later barred as something to be avoided in the kali age (kali-varjya).
-   Marital relationship (especially between a shūdra male and a dvija female) was discouraged.

> The three castes, (viz.) the Brāhmaṇas and the next (Kshatriyas and Vaiśyas), were produced from the face, the arms and the thighs of the Lord (lśvara) ; and for their support was born the fourth caste from His (i.e., lśvara's) feet. (5)  
> That this caste is more pure than those (other three) is self-evident ; for (verily) this caste was born along with the (river) Bhāgīrathī, (i.e., the Ganges [which springs from Vishṇu's foot]), the purifier of the three worlds. (6)
> The members of this caste are eagerly attentive to their duties, not wicked, pure-minded, and are devoid of passion and other such blemishes ; (they) ably bear all the burden of (protecting) the earth by helping those born in the kingly caste. (7)

### Incompariability: Medhātithi
"Brāhmaṇa is not superior to Cāṇḍāla" - Medhātithi (on Manusmṛti 10.112) Why? He says that it is only between two things of the same category, that one is said to be superior to the other.

Context: Statement of Manu that śiloñcha is better than pratigraha. He says that it is only because śiloñcha & pratigraha belong to the same category, i.e., taking someone else's possession, that one is said to be better than the other. The example of the Brāhmaṇa & Cāṇḍāla could imply that Medhātithi's conception of superiority between varṇas &/or jātis was probably not based on the hierarchical view of the upper one as the Brāhmaṇa and the lowest one as the Cāṇḍāla. It seems that, for him, both are incomparable with regard to superiority & inferiority.
