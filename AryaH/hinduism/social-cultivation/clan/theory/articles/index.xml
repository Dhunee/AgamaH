Class, Caste, and Genes
An article by Sabrina Tavernise appeared in the New York Times a few days ago describing increasing perceptions of class conflict in America, and there is a lot of recent commentary in the press about this report from the Pew Charitable Trust that claims there is less class mobility here than in several other northern countries. It is not very clear to me what the complaints really are or what alternatives exist.</description>

This is from a 3yr old video. He has said such content as recently as two days ago. So I am not making it up and all this is public content. It is the traditional stance on Equality as well. Vouched by many other Acharyas. Approximate Translation of Jeeyar&amp;rsquo;s talk follows:
People keep getting into fights with each other in the name of politics, in the name of caste or in many cases in the name of religion.</description>

      <description>In Bṛhaspatismṛti, the king is told to protect the dharmas of those born of pratilomas, those residing in forts, and the dharmas of specific deśa &amp;amp; jāti. Even though, elsewhere they may be punishable, but for them they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so, or else they would develop aversion for the king, which&amp;rsquo;ll lead to destruction of his power and treasury. Following are some examples of dharmas given:
Dākṣiṇātya dvijas marry the sibling of their mothers, etc.</description>

Hostis Xenos The Latin &amp;lsquo;hostis&amp;rsquo; (hostile) &amp;amp; the Greek &amp;lsquo;xenos&amp;rsquo; (xenophobic) did not always have a -ve sense. They originally used to mean &amp;lsquo;guest&amp;rsquo;, someone in a reciprocal relationship with your clan. As the Greco-Romans lost their clannish society, &amp;ldquo;guests&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;enemies&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;strangers&amp;rdquo;. As their clans grew, cities came up, the polis replaced the basic interactional unit of one dempotis / paterfamilias with another, as they became nations from tribes; the clan-clan reciprocality ended.</description>
