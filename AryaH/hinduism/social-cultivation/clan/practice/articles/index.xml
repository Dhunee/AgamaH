Thread on the myth of Ambedkar Mahar and Matki :
Whatever sources I provide are true to my knowledge and from contemporary sources. Story revolves around the year 1936. Ambedkar was to give a speech at Lahore session organized by Jaatpat Todak Mandal, but due to differences on his speech to be given the session was cancelled by the mandal so Ambedkar went on to publish his speech independently where he stated that during the rule of the Peshwas Mahars &amp;amp; other lower jaatis were forced to wear Matka (pot) in their neck &amp;amp; broom (jhadu) on the back of their waist.</description>

The intrinsic risk in attempting to divorce religious offices from hereditary contexts (by hereditary, it can be ANY group; so don&amp;rsquo;t come here &amp;amp; bark) &amp;amp; linking it purely with a system of &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;merit&amp;rdquo; is that it tends to result in the over-rationalization of traditions and non-abrahamic polytheisms in particular have this rich body of narratives &amp;amp; mythos linking the divine world with the human one as a defining characteristic.</description>

      <description>Excerpt from essay (by shikShA sharma?) in ‘Sindhi Tapestry’ by Saaz Aggarwal
Experiences One of my earliest memories is having people of my community, much older than me, touch my feet for my blessings. As an instinctive, knee-jerk response, I always jumped back, surprised each time it happened. Why was this happening to me? TV serials were a large part of my growing-up years, thanks to my mother and grandmother. In them, I saw younger people touching the feet of their elders.</description>

      <description>The Legend of Vimana Venkateshwara Swamy
After having the divine darshan of Lord Venkateshwara Swamy, devotees go around the Vimana Prakaram and have the darshanam of Vimana Venkateshwara Swamy, who is on the North-eastern corner on the middle tier of the 3 tiered Vimana gopuram. There is a board pointing towards this and also there is a Silver Prabhavali or Silver Makarathorana around the Vimana Venkateshwara Swamy on the Vimanam.</description>
