(Friends suggested that I turn one of my recent comments into an independent article. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried. Hope they like it.)
THE ELUSIVENESS OF ROMANTIC FULFILMENT
PART I Romantic fulfilment is perhaps the greatest joy that life in the world can offer. The deep pleasures of sexual intimacy occupy a place unmatched in the vast repertoire of human experiences. As the Brihadaranyaka Upanishat candidly proclaimed, सर्वेषाम् आनन्दानाम् उपस्थम् एकायनम्। - &amp;ldquo;Joys reach their fullness in lovemaking.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;dharma&amp;rdquo; among hindus came forth as dharmashAstra in reaction to the &amp;ldquo;dharmas&amp;rdquo; of nAstikas around 350BCE .  &amp;ldquo;pAshaNDa&amp;rdquo; cults of ashokan edicts and kauTilya-artha-shAstra include ajIvakas, jainas, bauddhas, brAhmaNas gRhastha contrasts with pravrAjaka (with some tension harmonized by Ashrama-system); is a religious person. The former term seems to have been motivated by prAkRta parallels. gRhapati and gRhapatnI were used earlier - and replaced in later works. The replacement stems from a slight semantic shift.</description>
