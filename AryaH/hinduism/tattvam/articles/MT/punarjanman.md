## Non-centrality to religion
The second point where I call for circumspection is the insistence on the beliefs of punarjaman and/or mokSha as central belief elements of the H religion. They are important for uttaramImAMsA but that is not a universal scaffold for other H systems. I don't discount the possibility that punarjaman was one of the greatest discoveries of the ancients that needs us to completely alter the framework of modern knowledge. However, I remain insufficiently convinced by the evidence favoring that position.

I'm fine with a position that states that it is a valid domain of further inquiry & the discoveries in that direction might tell us something about the situation that points to a theory that goes beyond what the ancients had felt.

I'm also fine with a view that acting as though punarjanman exists creates a more ethical society & provides for the mental health of an individual.+++(5)+++

But the we cannot reduce the core H religious framework to items of belief.

I would say that certain aspects of philosophy & "world theory" are less important in the definition of a H. More important is the& central is the worship of a *multiplicity of deities* with correct rituals & mantra-s; if uninitiated with stava-s and stotra-s. This latter part shouldn't be understood as being contrary to what the author says.

## Japan
I heard a talk by a Japanese investigator who remarked that though Japan is the 8th least religious country in the world several people report cases of claimed reincarnation broadly similar to cases that have been reported in India, Lanka, Thailand & Burma. He also mentioned that even in the 1800s such a case had been reported & bore close parallels to cases found in the Indosphere. He seemed have gathered some interesting data on such cases & remarked that he had e.g.s of kids who claimed such memory were not significantly enriched in bauddha-s.

The 1800s Japanese metempsychosis claim offers an independent parallel to those investigated by modern sleuths like Stevenson, Pasricha etc. It does raise the question as why these cases have cross-cultural similarity.
