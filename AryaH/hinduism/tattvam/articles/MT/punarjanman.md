The second point where I call for circumspection is the insistence on the beliefs of punarjaman and/or mokSha as central belief elements of the H religion. They are important for uttaramImAMsA but that is not a universal scaffold for other H systems. I don't discount the possibility that punarjaman was 1 of the greatest discoveries of the ancients that needs us to completely alter the framework of modern knowledge. However, I remain insufficiently convinced by the evidence favoring that position.

I'm fine with a position that states that it is a valid domain of further inquiry & the discoveries in that direction might tell us something about the situation that points to a theory that goes beyond what the ancients had felt.

I'm also fine with a view that acting as though punarjanman exists creates a more ethical society & provides for the mental health of an individual.+++(5)+++

But the we cannot reduce the core H religious framework to items of belief.

I would say that certain aspects of philosophy & "world theory" are less important in the definition of a H. More important is the& central is the worship of a *multiplicity of deities* with correct rituals & mantra-s; if uninitiated with stava-s and stotra-s. This latter part shouldn't be understood as being contrary to what the author says.
