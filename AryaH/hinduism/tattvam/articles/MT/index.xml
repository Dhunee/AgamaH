      <description>Source: here.
We had earlier mentioned the interesting discussion we had with Marc and kalashajA on what the western philosophers admit is the hard problem of consciousness. Our other acquaintance of the clan of the kAshyapa-s, had asked me if the Indians had contributed anything to the problem. He intuitively felt they had done so, but could not place a finger on it. Marc, R and I had some further discussion, and realized I knew less of it than I thought I did.</description>

      <description>(The peculiar case of an American girl from 1895 CE, from a report by Mason in the JAMA. In H medicine the same might have been described as seizure by one of the skanda-graha-s or an agent of kubera.)
Alma Z. was an unusually healthy and intellectual girl, a strong and attractive character, a leading spirit in whatever she undertook, whether in study, sport, or society. From overwork in school, and overtaxed strength in a case of sickness at home, her health was completely broken down, and after two years of great suffering suddenly a second personality appeared.</description>

      <description>Non-centrality to religion The second point where I call for circumspection is the insistence on the beliefs of punarjaman and/or mokSha as central belief elements of the H religion. They are important for uttaramImAMsA but that is not a universal scaffold for other H systems. I don&amp;rsquo;t discount the possibility that punarjaman was one of the greatest discoveries of the ancients that needs us to completely alter the framework of modern knowledge.</description>
