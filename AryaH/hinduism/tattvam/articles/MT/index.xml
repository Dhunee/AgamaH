      <description>Source: here.
We had earlier mentioned the interesting discussion we had with Marc and kalashajA on what the western philosophers admit is the hard problem of consciousness. Our other acquaintance of the clan of the kAshyapa-s, had asked me if the Indians had contributed anything to the problem. He intuitively felt they had done so, but could not place a finger on it. Marc, R and I had some further discussion, and realized I knew less of it than I thought I did.</description>

      <description>The second point where I call for circumspection is the insistence on the beliefs of punarjaman and/or mokSha as central belief elements of the H religion. They are important for uttaramImAMsA but that is not a universal scaffold for other H systems. I don&amp;rsquo;t discount the possibility that punarjaman was 1 of the greatest discoveries of the ancients that needs us to completely alter the framework of modern knowledge. However, I remain insufficiently convinced by the evidence favoring that position.</description>
