      <description>Source: here.
The mantra of the goddess trailokyavijayA is provided by the yuddha-jayArNava tantraM. A somewhat corrupt version of this tantra is incorporated into the agni purANa. Stand-alone manuscripts of the YJA also exist, though they have not been edited or published. In addition to the version of the agni-purANa I had access to a hand-written transcript on paper. The Dutch explorers have recovered a corrupt version of the same in their collection of Hindu mantras known as stuti-s and stava-s from Indonesia (now only surviving in Bali).</description>

      <title>shrIvidyA beyond the pa~nchadashI and classical phase</title>

      <description>Source: here.
Not much is remembered of the shrI-kula traditions before the universal sweep by the pa~nchadashI and structurally related mantras, like manu vidyA or skanda vidyA. These may be termed the classical shrIvidyA mantras and examples include:
The manmatha vidyA or kAdi vidyA:
ka e I la hrIM | ha sa ka ha la hrIM | sa ka la hrIM
This celebrated mantra is seen even in tiru-mantiraM of sundaranAtha (tirumUlar) the celebrated siddha who migrated from Kashmir to the drAviDa desha.</description>

      <title>The hAdi krama</title>

      <description>Source: here.
In South India outside of the chera country the knowledge of hAdi vidyA has largely declined. I recall a gentleman telling me that hAdi vidyA is only used for abhichAra purposes. Of course this is an erroneous view. I was going through R’s manual used for the hAdi krama- pretty distinctive in terms of its vArAhI and mAta~NgI formulae. But the hAdi pa~ncha krama involves the worship of AdyA-kAlI in the morning, tArA at the mid-day ritual, ChinnamastA at the sunset rite, bagalAmukhI at the nocturnal rite and hAdI-vidyA at the mid-night rite.</description>

      <description>Source: here.
While mahAchInakrama is a not a path of tantra usually followed by the shrauta-smArta ritualist, it was once secretly practiced by several, including brahminical paNDitas. Some believe such paNDitas practicing mahAchInakrama where fallen brahmins, often associated with the nAstIka matas, but others believed that they had reached a state of “siddha-hood” that made them transcend the sacral and sacrilegious state. shrI shyAmol rAm whom we introduced earlier was an exponent of mahAchInakrama and his upAsana deities included mahAchInakrama-tArA, ekajaTA, and a form of bR^ihaspati known as ma~Njughosha.</description>

      <description>Source: here.

A stream of the kubjikA tradition has evolved out of the more archaic atharvanic tradition. One of the most important links between the kubjikA mata and the older atharvan tradition is the kubjikA upaniShad. kubjikA is identified with pratya~NgirA or atharvaNa bhadrakAlI the spirit of the atharva veda. The kubjikA mata also preserves certain other connections to the atharvan tradition in the form of the medico-magical use of herbs.</description>

sAmantadeva had entered the shrine of the 64 yoginIs, the yoginI at vajrapura in kali~nga. He stood in the center worshiping nityaklinnA. He saw an apparition of the great goddess who instructed him to seek daNDanAthA. Go north she said. sAmantadeva crossed the pITha of shAradA and moved beyond to the heart of oDDiyAna. There in the middle of the most enchanting oDDiyAna, where the siddhi of yoga manisfests itself, the very thought of which causes one to proceed of the flight of the yoginI, sAmantadeva went on to create the kirichakra maNDAla with colored sand.</description>

We worship chi~nchinI under the large tamrind tree from whom the sea of spanda has emerged.
There are 4 AmnAyas:
pUrvAmnAya: The mukhya shaktI, the great goddess of this AmnAya is kuleshvarI who manifests as tribhuvaneshvarI along with paramAndabhairava. From this face emerged the trika tantras with khagendranAtha as the first of the kaula adept in this lineage. It was temporarily destroyed by kArttikeya.
dakShinAmnAya: The great goddess of this stream is kAmeshvarI- she is pleasing to the eye as the young sun, yet brilliant as hundred million flashes of lightning that strike the consciousness of the adept as the rahasyas of her mantras are realized.</description>

A famed archaic tantric manual of the atharvans is glorious kubjikA upaniShad. Its material is remarkable and worthy of detailed discussion at some point. It was founded by the bhArgavas, who are supposed to have obtained it directly from dhUrta kumAra in the manner in which pata~njala kApya’s daughter became the medium of the ancient bhArgava. That tale goes thus:
When the students of pata~njala kApya, who had his school in the kingdom of the mAdras, asked him for an ancient vidyA, he said that it was only known to the long gone bhArgava kabandha AtharvaNa.</description>

shrichakra 

The glorious yantra of shri lalitA-tripurasundarI can be defined formally by the following parameters (given for a unit shrichakra):
YF=.668; XF=.126; YP=.463; XA= 0.187; YJ=.398; YL=.165; YA=.265; YG=.769; YV=.887; YM=.603; YD=.551 (where X, Y are the coordinates with the point A, F, J G etc with the origin at the intersection of the largest yoni triangle and the bounding circle)
These define the exact shrichakra as laid down by kaivalyAshrama.</description>

      <title>pratya~NgirA and kR^ityA prayoga</title>

      <description>Source: here.
There was more than one discussion recently as to whether the tantric goddess pratya~NgirA was associated with a kR^ityA prayoga. The atharvan text clearly deploys the sUkta of pratichIna A~Ngirasa as a counter charm against kR^ityAs. An extension of the deployment, similar in spirit is seen in the R^ig vidhAna of shaunaka. MS Bhat titled his study on the R^igvidhAna as “Vedic Tantrism”. This title is somewhat appropriate because the vidhAna appears to represent intermediate condition through which the evolution of vedic prayogas into tantric prayogas occured.</description>
