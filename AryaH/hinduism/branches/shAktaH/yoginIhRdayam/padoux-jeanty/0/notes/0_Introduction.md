[^4]: For the reader who might be surprised by the shift in Sanskrit terms from *i* to *ai* \( *Śiva* to *Śaiva* , *Tripura* to *Traipura* \), let us explain that in Sanskrit, the adjecti-val form of a verbal or nominal root is made by adding an *a* , hence *tri * \+ *a = trai*. 

[^5]: Though very often called “Mother,” the Hindu goddess in her various forms and names, is not a “mother-goddess.” She has no children \(or, at any rate, does not give birth to them normally\). Tripurasundarī has Bhairava as a consort but is not married to him. 



[^6]: There are *ardhanārī* , half-female, half-male images of this divine pair. 

[^7]: On this group of deities, see David Kinsley, Tantric Visions of the Divine: The Ten Mahāvidyās \(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997\). 

[^8]: This observance consisted for the practitioner in wandering while carrying a skull-topped staff and an alms bowl fashioned of a human cranium. 



[^9]: The best description of the *āmnāya* system and, more generally, of the Śaiva traditions is that of Alexis Sanderson, “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” in Stewart Sutherland et al., eds, *The World’s Religions* \(London: Routledge, 1981\), pp. 606–704. 

[^10]: On the *pīṭ has* , see note 22 of chapter 1 below.

[^11]: This tradition has been studied by Douglas R. Brooks, notably in Auspicious Wisdom: The Texts and Traditions of Śrīvidyā, Śākta Tantrism in South India \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1992\). 

[^12]: There is Brooks’s study quoted above and also his *The Secret of the Three Cities. *

*An Introduction to Hindu Śākta Tantrism* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990\). Though informative, these two books do not cover the vast area of texts of the Tripurā tradition of the *dakṣiṇāmnāya. * 

[^13]: Edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in the *Tantrik Texts* , fi rst published in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). 

[^14]: The *Subhagodaya* 

and the 

*Subhagodayavāsanā* 

of Śivānanda or the 

*Jñānadīpavimarśinī* of Vidyānanda, for instance. 

[^15]: This was done by Pdt. V. V. Dvivedi in the introduction \(in Hindi\) of his edition of the YH. The hypothesis does not lack probability. Abhinavagupta mentions central India \( 

*madhyadeśa* 

\) as the seat of all the Śaiva treatises 

\( *ni ḥ śeṣaśāstrasadanam* \). This remains to be proved. 

[^16]: The Pratyabhijñā \(the “Recognition”\), one of the philosophical systems of Kashmirian nondualist shaivism, was propounded fi rst by Somānanda \(c. 

900–950\), then by his disciple Utpaladeva, whose work was commented on and expanded by Abhinavagupta. It is one of the most remarkable Indian philosophical systems. Its main contention is that liberation is gained by the recognition \( *pratyabhijñā* \) of the identity of the human self \( *ātman* \) and the supreme Lord, Śiva. The “transpersonal” self thus realized contains the totality of subjective and objective phenomena in a nondualistic synthesis where all distinctions disappear in the fullness of the Absolute. A concise and clear presentation of the Pratyabhijñā was made by Kṣemarāja in the *Pratyabhijñāhrdaya*. It is translated into English by Jaideva Singh, Pratyabhijñāhr̥dayam, Sanskrit text with English translation and notes \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1963\). 

[^17]: It has not been translated into English. Bhāskararāya wrote a short and useful treatise on the *śrīvidyā* , the *Varivasyārahasya*. It was edited with an English translation in the Adyar Library Series, no. 28 \(1948\). I translated Amṛ tānanda’s *Dīpikā* together with the YH in *Le coeur de la Yoginī:* Yoginīhr̥daya *avec le com-mentaire* Dīpikā *d’Amṛ tānanda* \(Paris: Collège de France, 1994\) 18. A typical, though extreme, case of this is Pāṇini’s Sanskrit grammar, the *Aṣṭ ādhyāy* , which is entirely cryptic. Its fi rst sutra is: *vṛ ddhirādaic*. .. 

[^19]: On these two forms, see below. 

[^20]: Other Śaiva traditions have a goddess as their main deity, such as the Kubjikā 

tradition or the Krama, with Kālī. The Śaiva nondualist Kashmirian system of the Trika has three supreme goddesses: Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā. We may underscore here the fact that with very few exceptions, the Tantric traditions whose main deity is a goddess nevertheless hold the male divine form of the deity, usually Śiva/Bhairava, as metaphysically higher. Tantras, we must not forget, were composed by male brahmins; their extolling of the goddess or of 



165

feminine powers were \(to quote an American anthropologist\) “male constructions of femaleness.” 

[^21]: The *mātṛ kās* 

are either seven, the 

*saptamātṛ kā* 

, or eight \( 

*aṣṭ amātṛ kā* or 

*matāṣṭ aka* \). The number eight is important in Tantric texts. Eight times eight is the \(theoretical\) number of Bhairava Tantras. Sixty-four is also four times sixteen, which is an important lunar number, the number of fullness. Sixteen is also the number of the Nityās, the fi rst of which is Tripurasundarī\(see YH 

[^3]:113\); and the name of the VM/NṣĀ, *Nityāṣo ḍ aśikārṇava* , means “The Ocean of the Sixteen Nityās.” 

[^22]: A *crore* \( *ko ṭ i* \) is ten million.

. 

On the Śaiva nondualist conceptions of the heart, see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The Triadic Heart of Śiva \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1989\). 

[^24]: But a light that is consciousness, a conscious light. 

[^25]: We say “manifested” rather than “created,” for in a nondualist system, the deity does not create outwardly the world; she manifests, causes to appear outwardly \(though in herself\), the cosmos, which is in seed in herself. There is no *fi at* taking place at the beginning of time; creation as manifestation is being eternally, perpetually manifested by the godhead who pervades and animates it—otherwise, it would disappear. 

[^26]: Indian philosophical systems, like the classical Western \(Greek\) philosophies, are not abstract theoretical constructions but ways of life, traditions to live by. 

[^27]: *Bhāvanā* is a very important practice in the universe of Tantra. The term is derived from the causative form of the Sanskrit verbal root *BHU* , to cause to exist \( *bhāvyate* \). It designates a practice consisting of evoking mentally the image of a deity with the same precision as a concrete image or creating, by calling it intensely to mind, any image, vision, or thought, thus identifying the meditating person with the subject or theme being meditated. It diff ers from *dhyāna* in its intensity and identifying power and in the fact that it creates its object, which is not necessarily the case in *dhyāna*. Its role is fundamental in Tantric mental practices, spiritual life, and ritual. As is well known, in Tantrism, *dhyāna* designates meditation but also, and more important, the mental visualization of a deity as described in stanzas of ritual manuals called *dhyānaślokas. * 

[^28]: *Uccāra* is an utterance of a mantra that is both an enunciation and an upward thrust of the phonic subtle sound, the *nāda* , of the mantra in the body of the mantrin. This ascending phonic movement is often associated with the ascent of *kuṇḍ alinī* along the *suṣumnā* ; it is more a yogic practice than a verbal enunciation. This is, notably, the case of the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* described in the third chapter \( *śl*. 169–188\) of the YH. 

[^29]: On the levels of *vāc* , see chapter 2, *śl. * 63, and n. 25 ad loc. 

[^30]: See the commentary and notes to *śl*. 1.57. 

[^31]: The *uddhāra* of a mantra is the ritual procedure by which one “extracts” 

\( *ud-DHRī* 

\) its constituent syllables from the ensemble of the Sanskrit 

166



alphabet, this being displayed, according to particular rules, on a consecrated surface or placed in a particular order in a diagram called *prastāra* \(“display”\) or *gahvara* \(“cavern” or “hiding place”\). This permits revealing the composition of the mantra only to initiates who know how to “extract” the syllables thus hidden. The *uddhāra* can also consist of listing the syllables of a mantra, giving them conventional, theoretically secret names, or by alluding esoteri-cally to them. 

[^32]: There are, in fact, various other forms, made of three clusters but of varying length, quoted notably in Purṇānanda’s *Śrītattvacintāmaṇi*. 

[^33]: On this important term, see YH 1.67 and its commentary. 

[^34]: The basic work on the *kāmakalā* is Puṇyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , which was edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). A careful and interesting study of this diagram is found in chapter 4 

of David G. White’s *Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian Contexts* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003\). 

[^35]: *Nirīkṣaṇa* , also called *dṛṣṭ ipāta* \(“the casting of a glance”\), as a means to infl uence, harm, or else help spiritually, plays an important role in Indian religious or magic practice. The compassionate glance of the guru helps his disciple. 

[^36]: Hindu rites are traditionally divided into three classes. *Nitya* , “regular,” are daily and mandatory rites; their performance does not bring any merit, but not to perform them is a fault. The *naimittika* , “occasional,” rites are obligatory but are to be performed on particular prescribed occasions; they bring merit. 

*Kāmya, * “optional,” rites are undertaken to attain desired aims; mantric rites are *kāmya* , as are, of course, all “magical” rites. 

[^37]: On the practice and spirit of the Tantric Śaiva worship, see Richard H. Davis, Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press\), especially the chapter titled 

“Becoming a Śiva.” This book is a study of dualist shaivism, for which only ritual liberates one from the fetters of this world, a conception opposed to that of nondualist shaivism and therefore of the YH. The rites are, however, generally the same. 

[^38]: It is mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* and in Tantras of the Kubjikāmata. 

[^39]: There are traditionally eight main *siddhis* 

always quoted, beginning with 

*aṇimā* , the power to become as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The others are *laghimā* , to be light; *mahimā* , being large; *prāpti* , to obtain all; *prakāmya* , being irresistible; *ī śitva* , domination; *vaśitva* , subjugation; and *yatakāmavaśayitā* , to be able to go to whatever place one wishes. A ninth *siddhi* , *garimā* , to become heavy, is sometimes added. 

[^40]: On this center of the yogic body, situated twelve fi nger-breadths above the head, see chapter 3.49.
