[^31]: The *uddhāra* of a mantra is the ritual procedure by which one “extracts”\( *ud-DHRī*\) its constituent syllables from the ensemble of the Sanskrit

alphabet, this being displayed, according to particular rules, on a consecrated surface or placed in a particular order in a diagram called *prastāra* \(“display”\) or *gahvara* \(“cavern” or “hiding place”\). This permits revealing the composition of the mantra only to initiates who know how to “extract” the syllables thus hidden. The *uddhāra* can also consist of listing the syllables of a mantra, giving them conventional, theoretically secret names, or by alluding esoteri-cally to them. 

[^32]: There are, in fact, various other forms, made of three clusters but of varying length, quoted notably in Purṇānanda’s *Śrītattvacintāmaṇi*. 

[^33]: On this important term, see YH 1.67 and its commentary. 

[^34]: The basic work on the *kāmakalā* is Puṇyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , which was edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). A careful and interesting study of this diagram is found in chapter 4 

of David G. White’s *Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian Contexts* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003\). 

[^35]: *Nirīkṣaṇa* , also called *dṛṣṭipāta* \(“the casting of a glance”\), as a means to infl uence, harm, or else help spiritually, plays an important role in Indian religious or magic practice. The compassionate glance of the guru helps his disciple. 

[^36]: Hindu rites are traditionally divided into three classes. *Nitya* , “regular,” are daily and mandatory rites; their performance does not bring any merit, but not to perform them is a fault. The *naimittika* , “occasional,” rites are obligatory but are to be performed on particular prescribed occasions; they bring merit. 

*Kāmya, * “optional,” rites are undertaken to attain desired aims; mantric rites are *kāmya* , as are, of course, all “magical” rites. 

[^37]: On the practice and spirit of the Tantric Śaiva worship, see Richard H. Davis, Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press\), especially the chapter titled 

“Becoming a Śiva.” This book is a study of dualist shaivism, for which only ritual liberates one from the fetters of this world, a conception opposed to that of nondualist shaivism and therefore of the YH. The rites are, however, generally the same. 

[^38]: It is mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* and in Tantras of the Kubjikāmata. 

[^39]: There are traditionally eight main *siddhis* 

always quoted, beginning with 

*aṇimā* , the power to become as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The others are *laghimā* , to be light; *mahimā* , being large; *prāpti* , to obtain all; *prakāmya* , being irresistible; *ī śitva* , domination; *vaśitva* , subjugation; and *yatakāmavaśayitā* , to be able to go to whatever place one wishes. A ninth *siddhi* , *garimā* , to become heavy, is sometimes added.
