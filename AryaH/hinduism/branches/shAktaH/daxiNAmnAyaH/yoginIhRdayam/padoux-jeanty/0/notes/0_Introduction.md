[^36]: Hindu rites are traditionally divided into three classes. *Nitya* , “regular,” are daily and mandatory rites; their performance does not bring any merit, but not to perform them is a fault. The *naimittika* , “occasional,” rites are obligatory but are to be performed on particular prescribed occasions; they bring merit. 

*Kāmya, * “optional,” rites are undertaken to attain desired aims; mantric rites are *kāmya* , as are, of course, all “magical” rites. 

[^37]: On the practice and spirit of the Tantric Śaiva worship, see Richard H. Davis, Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press\), especially the chapter titled 

“Becoming a Śiva.” This book is a study of dualist shaivism, for which only ritual liberates one from the fetters of this world, a conception opposed to that of nondualist shaivism and therefore of the YH. The rites are, however, generally the same. 

[^38]: It is mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* and in Tantras of the Kubjikāmata. 

[^39]: There are traditionally eight main *siddhis* 

always quoted, beginning with 

*aṇimā* , the power to become as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The others are *laghimā* , to be light; *mahimā* , being large; *prāpti* , to obtain all; *prakāmya* , being irresistible; *ī śitva* , domination; *vaśitva* , subjugation; and *yatakāmavaśayitā* , to be able to go to whatever place one wishes. A ninth *siddhi* , *garimā* , to become heavy, is sometimes added.
