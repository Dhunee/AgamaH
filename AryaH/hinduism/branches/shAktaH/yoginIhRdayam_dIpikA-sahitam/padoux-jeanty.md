* Preface * 

this book originates in a French translation of the *Yogin ī hṛ daya* from Sanskrit by André Padoux, published in 1994 in Paris by the Collège de France. It was printed by Editions de Boccard as an annotated translation with transliterated Sanskrit of the three chapters of the *Yogin ī hṛ daya* and of its commentary by Amṛ tānanda, meant for an academic readership. 

Pursuant to his interest in the Śr ī Vidyā tradition, this book was read by Roger-Orphé Jeanty, living in the United States. Assuming that the *Yogin ī hṛ daya* would be of considerable interest to a larger English-speaking readership, he proceeded in 2003 to translate its three chapters into English, working with his colleague Sarah Caldwell, using Padoux’s French translation and a Sanskrit *devanāgari* edition. This was published informally in English with the original Sanskrit both in the Indian *devanāgari* script and in transliteration. It was designed for use by readers interested in or practicing within contemporary Śr ī Vidyā communities. 

Some time after completion, Jeanty sent a copy of this eff ort to Padoux, in recognition of the considerable eff ort required for the original published French version. In fact, Padoux had already considered the possibility of such a translation and began writing an English introduction to the text and attempted a translation of the fi rst chapter. But he found translating Sanskrit into English very diffi

cult and the attempted translation very awk-

ward and unsatisfactory, and he therefore abandoned it. 

Upon receiving a copy of this English translation, Padoux found it quite satisfactory, while admiring the beautiful *devanāgari* text that accompanied it. He thought it a pity that such useful work should be known and made use of by only a few people, and he suggested that they take up the job together. 

Padoux emended Jeanty’s translation when needed to make it more true to the original Sanskrit text, and Jeanty corrected Padoux’s English \(in 

x

*P r e f a c e*

the introduction and the notes and in the translation\) whenever necessary to make it more grammatically correct, more fl uent, and conforming to American usage. 

It is sincerely hoped that this conjoined eff ort will make this important text much more widely known and distributed within an English-speaking readership. 

* Note on the Transcription and *

*Pronunciation of Sanskrit * 

the sanskrit alphabet has forty-nine letters, which are transcribed in this book when necessary using diacritical signs according to a common international system. 

The vowels are pronounced very much like Spanish or French vowels. 

The short *a* , however, is pronounced like the *u* in “but,” and the long *ā* 

is pronounced like the *a* in “fast.” 

As for the consonants, *g* is pronounced as in “guest,” *c* as *ch* in “church,” 

and *j* as in “jungle.” The aspirated consonants \( *tha, dha* , *pha* , *bha* \) are pronounced marking the aspiration, as in “top hat,” for instance. And *ṛ * is a vowel pronounced more or less like “ri.”

*The Heart of the Yoginī* 

Introduction 

in spite of its modest size, the *Yogin ī hṛ daya* \(abbreviated as YH hereafter\), whose title may be translated as “The Heart of the Yogin ī ,” rates among the principal works of Tantric Hinduism. For the lay reader who is not a scholar, this text may be surprising or disconcerting because of its language, its obscurities, and its challenging concepts. We have made every eff ort in our com-ments and annotations to clarify these diffi

culties in the text and have used 

extensively the commentary by Amṛ tānanda called the *D ī pikā * \(“The Lamp”\). 

Some help to the reader would fi rst consist in placing the YH in its context, which is Tantric Hinduism, the world of Hindu Tantra. This, naturally, cannot be done satisfactorily within the limits of this introduction. A few points, however, may be made to situate the YH in the histori-cal development of Indian Hindu culture and, in that culture, within the Tantric phenomenon. 1 

this particular aspect of Hinduism, as far as we can say, seems to have appeared around the fi fth century of our era \(we do not know exactly where\), as cults arose of mostly feminine, often fearsome deities whose worship included having the offi

ciants become “possessed” by the deity, 

occasional sexual rites, and having the adepts follow particular observances \( *vrata* \). In contrast with mainstream orthodox Hinduism, the religious doctrines of these groups were not traced back to the Veda by their followers but attributed to deities, a male god, most often an aspect of Śiva/Bhairava or of Vi ṣ ṇu, or a goddess, usually Kāl ī . The religious beliefs of these ascetic groups were deemed to have been revealed by these deities. The texts upholding them are usually called Tantra but also Āgama \(tradition\) or Saṁhitā \(collection\). They were composed in Sanskrit by brahmins, which demonstrates that these traditions did appear within the socioreligious Hindu fold. The Tantric traditions, in eff ect, did not reject entirely the Vedic fund of doctrines and practices. They considered it only

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

as socially valid but unable to give liberation, which could only be attained through the complementary and higher teachings of the Tantras. 

First limited to small esoteric transgressive groups of ascetics, this teaching progressively spread to larger groups, being adopted by \(externally\) orthodox Hindu householders who, from a certain time \(perhaps the seventh or eighth century\) onward, formed the vast majority of Tantric believers. This was in spite of the fact that Tantric teachings are esoteric and in principle meant only for initiates, initiation \( *d ī k ṣ ā* \) being theoretically the necessary fi rst step toward liberation—a liberation giving both *mukti* \(liberation\) and *bhukti* \(the enjoyment of mundane or supramundane rewards or supernatural powers\) and, of course, to be enjoyed while still living: a *j ī vanmukti* . The Tantric *j ī vanmukta* , the liberated in this life, is not only free from this world, but he also dominates it magically. 

In the course of time, Tantric traditions developed, expanded, and diversifi ed. As they spread, their notions and ritual practices progressively permeated the whole Hindu world, so much so that for the last thousand years, there has been practically no Hindu tradition entirely devoid of Tantric elements. The Hindu worship, the *pūjā* , for instance, is Tantric in its conception and ritual process, the principles of Hindu temple building and iconography are Tantric, and so on. The Tantric domain penetrated also the social and political fi eld. It spread to the whole Indian subcontinent and South Asia. Its textually most active period was \(approximately\) from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries. One of its main centers in the Indian subcontinent was in Kashmir, where several important Śaiva traditions appeared, such as the Spanda, Krama, Pratyabhijñā, or Trika. Abhinavagupta, one of the most remarkable and brilliant Indian philosophers and mystics, the master of the Trika, was from Kashmir \(fl . 

c. 975–1025\). 

Among the Kashmiri nondualist systems and forming one of the four 

“transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \) of the Kula is the Śr ī vidyā, whose main deity is Tripurasundar ī , the supreme goddess of the YH. 

the YH is a very typical text of Tantric Hinduism and embodies archetypal characteristics. As is often the case in such works, its esoteric teaching is expounded in a dialogue between two deities, the Goddess Tripurasundar ī 

\(or Mahātripurasundar ī \), “The Beautiful \[Mistress\] of the Three Cities” \(or 

“Fortresses”\)—of the three worlds, 2 that is—who questions, and the god 

Bhairava, a fearsome form of Śiva, who answers her in the form of these teachings. 

* Introduction *

3

Tripurasundar ī , a beautiful, auspicious \(and erotic\) form of the great Hindu Goddess, is the main deity of an important Tantric Śaiva tradition, often called *śr ī vidyā * because such is the name of her main or root mantra \( *mūlamantra* \). 3 The term *śr ī vidyā* , however, is not usual in ancient works and has come to be used mainly to refer to a modern form of this tradition, which \(as we shall see\) is still active in India today. It is therefore better to call this system the tradition of Tripurā \( *traipuradarśana* or *traipurasaṁpradāya* , 4 in Sanskrit, the doctrine or tradition of Tripurā\), as is done in most texts. We shall do this here. It is also sometimes referred to as *saubhāgyasampradāya* , the *śr ī vidyā * being sometimes called *saubhāgyavidyā. Saubhāgya* means good fortune, happiness, and success, in addition to beauty and charm; all of these terms evoke an important aspect of this goddess and therefore of this tradition. 

The name Tripurasundar ī is often explained as referring to that goddess’s character as “Mother” 5 of various triads—all the more so when the exegetes of the system interpret it in the spirit of the Kashmirian Śaiva nondualist system of the Trika, the “Triad” \(which happens to be the case of Amṛ tānanda, whose commentary on the YH we follow here when trying to elucidate this sometimes obscure text\). She is also Kāmeśvar ī , associated with Kāmeśvara as the Mistress and the Master of Love. 



6 

Tripurasundar ī is sometimes called Lalitā. She is also considered as one of the ten Mahāvidyā ṣ , or Nityās, 7 in which case she is sometimes named Ṣ o ḍ aś ī \(“Sixteenth”\) or even Śr ī vidyā. There exist, too, such aspects of her as Tripurabhairav ī or Balatripurasundar ī . Indian deities commonly have many aspects, corresponding to diff erent characters or aspects of the deity, auspicious or fearsome, receiving diff erent types of worship. In the auspicious form that she has in the YH, she is usually shown as a beautiful shining woman, three-eyed, with the waxing moon on her forehead, wearing a red garment, seated on a lotus, holding in her four hands goad and arrow, bow and noose. 

There are very few stone images of Tripurasundar ī , but there are many paintings. Her worship is done using the *śr ī cakra* , and no concrete image is used, but during the ritual, she is to be visualized by the offi ciating 

adept as described in the texts. 

as is frequent in India, next to nothing is known of the origins of the tradition of Tripurā. It goes back probably to the tenth or eleventh century a.d. It has survived until our day and has produced important and interesting works well into the modern period. As far as we know, its two oldest

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

and most basic texts are the *Vāmakeśvara* / *Vāmakeśvar ī mata* Tantra \(VM\), also known as the *Nityā ṣ odaśkārṇava* \(N Ṣ A\) and the YH. These works may date from the tenth or eleventh century. It seems that a passage of the VM was quoted by Abhinavagupta \(11th c.\) in two of his works, the *Parātr ī śikavivaraṇa* and the *Mālinī vijayavārttika* ; and Jayaratha, who lived in the twelfth century and wrote a commentary on the VM, mentions several earlier commentators on this Tantra, one of whom may have lived as far back as the ninth century. But there is no proof of this. 

There also does not seem to exist any iconographical evidence of Tripurā’s worship before the tenth or eleventh century. It has indeed been suggested that an allusion to the *śr ī vidyā * and perhaps to the *śr ī cakra* is to be found in the South Indian Tamil work *Tirumantiram* , which some scholars date as far back as the seventh or eighth century. This, however, remains to be proved. There is also a belief in the modern Śr ī vidyā tradition that a *śr ī cakra* was installed in Sṛ ṅ geri, together with an image of the goddess Śāradā, by Śa ṅ karācārya \(8th c.\). But this is mere imagining. 



the tradition of Tripurā is one of the four “transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \) of the vast Kula \(or Kaula\) ensemble of Tantric Śaiva systems that developed from the earlier Śaiva fund of beliefs and practices based on the so-called *kāpālika* form of practice, on traditions in which the fearsome Bhairava was the main deity, the basic form of observance \( *vrata* \) was that of the skull \( *kāpālavrata* \), 8 and the worship was carried out in cre-mation grounds \( *śmaśāna* \). These cults may have originated in northern India, perhaps in Kashmir. They were visionary transgressive cults whose adepts were possessed by the deity and in which the main deity, male or female, was surrounded by secondary deities refl ecting his or her power and pervading the cosmos with their \(usually fearsome\) energy. These secondary female deities, the Yogin ī s, were considered to be grouped in lineages \( *gotra* \), clans, or families \( *kula* \), hence the name Kula given to this religious ensemble. In the course of time, the earlier transgressive practices tended to be replaced by more staid ones, the main adepts being henceforth usually householders of pure castes rather than skull-bearing ascetics. The ancient Tantras, their terminology, and their deities were, however, retained but tended to be symbolically interpreted. The actual performance of the most “Tantric” rites \(the sexual ones in particular\) was now limited to a few religious “virtuosi,” and possession \( *āveśa* \) by the deity was replaced by mystical union or fusion \( *samāveśa* , although the term *āveśa* continued to be used\) of the adept’s consciousness with

the divine Absolute. This combination of Tantric visionary elements with an intellectual and mystical approach is clearly visible in the YH and still more in its commentaries and also in other texts of the Tripurā tradition \(or in other Kula systems\). 



the kula ensemble of traditions is traditionally divided into four “transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \), named according to the points of the compass: eastern \( *pūrva* \), northern \( *uttara* \), western \( *paścima* \), and southern \( *dak ṣ iṇa* \). 9 

The *pūrvāmnāya* \( *pūrva* being understood both as eastern and as primary or earlier\) was perhaps the original *kula* system. It includes a number of elements \( *p ī ṭ has* , 10 lineages, coded language, rituals, etc.\), which 

are found in all four transmissions; we shall see some of them here. The worship included sexual rites. The Trika system, the Kashmirian and best known of the Śaiva nondualist traditions, seems to have developed mainly from this *āmnāya* . So does the Spanda, “Vibration.” The Trika has long since disappeared as a living religious tradition but has survived to this day as the Kashmirian main form of nondualist shaivism. 

The *uttarāmnāya* , the Northern transmission, is that of the Kāl ī cults. 

It included three traditions. One is the Mata \(the “Doctrine”\), of which very little is known and which has disappeared. Another is the Krama \(the 

“Sequence”\), so called because its pantheon and its worship are organized in sequences or phases \( *krama* \). In it, the Goddess dominates Bhairava. 

A number of Krama texts have survived; some are edited. Abhinavagupta included *krama* elements in his Trika, as did many Śaiva authors, including commentators on the YH. The third tradition is that of the worship of the fearsome goddess Guhyakāl ī , which survives in Nepal as the worship of Guhyeśvar ī . 

The *paścimāmnāya* , the Western transmission, has as its main deity the hunchbacked goddess Kubjikā, with the beautiful mantra god Navātman as consort. Its main text is the *Kubjikāmatatantra* \(which is edited\). Here, too, the goddess is placed above her consort. 

Finally, the *dak ṣ ināmnāya* , the Southern transmission, is the one to which the YH belongs. Its chief deity is Kāmeśvar ī , goddess of erotic pleasure \(with Kāmeśvara as consort\), or Tripurasundar ī \(with Bhairava\). It is \(or was\) in many respects a cult of erotic magic, as appears notably in the VM/N Ṣ A. Its main characteristic is the use in ritual and meditation of a particular diagram, the *śr ī cakra* , and of a particular mantra, the *śr ī vidyā* . It is probably the most recent of the four *āmnāyas* . It has lasted until today, producing several interesting works. It does not seem to have divided into

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

diff erent schools. There are, however, at least since the thirteenth century, two diff erent lineages, with two diff erent forms of the *śr ī vidyā* \(as we shall see\). Variants also appeared. There is in particular a modern South Indian Śr ī vidyā, based in Sṛ ṅ geri, very largely “vedantized” and “de-Tantricized,” 

which is, however, not socially unimportant since it has been adopted by the Śa ṅ karācāryas. 11 



as we have seen, the four *āmnāyas* have diff erent main deities, diff erent pantheons and mantras, and so on; however, because of their common Śaiva *kāpālika* origin, they have, if not exactly a common esoteric core, at least a common fund of metaphysical \(and sometimes theological\) notions or doctrines, or ritual or spiritual practices, expressed by using a common vocabulary, such as the use of the term *kula* and its derivatives \( *akula* , *kaula* , *kaulika* \). Some mantras, too, are common to diff erent *āmnāyas. * 



although it is still the most active tradition of the Kula, the Tripurā 

tradition is little known outside India. There is, as far as we know, no 

complete and systematic study of its vast literature. 



12 This includes, 

among earlier authors, such people as Puṇyānanda, who was the master of Amṛ tānanda, who often refers to his *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , 13 and Śivānanda or Vidyānanda, both of whom commented on the YH but also wrote various ritual, theological, or philosophical works. Later came Lak ṣ m ī dhara \(16th c.\) and the polymath Bhāskararāya \(c. a.d. 1700\), who wrote a commentary on the YH to which we sometimes refer here; Kaśināthabha ṭ ṭ a is also worth mentioning. 

The tradition includes such works as the vast mythical and speculative *Tripurārahasya* , a number of Tantras or Tantric compilations such as the *Gandharvatantra* , the *Tantrarāja* , the *Tripurārṇava* , the *Śaktisa ṅ gama* , the *Vidyārṇava* , and so on. There are Upani ṣ ads, too, such as the *Tripurā* , the *Tripurāttāpin ī * , or the *Bhāvanopaṇi ṣ ad* . Very important from the ritual point of view is the *Paraśurāmakalpasūtra* \(where the goddess is Lalitā\), commented on by Umānanda in the *Nityotsava* \(1745\) and then by Rameśvara in 1831. A number of other works—digests, ritual manuals, hymns, and 

so on—would deserve mentioning. 14 Of these, we only refer to one of the best known, the *Saundaryalahar ī * , traditionally attributed to Śa ṅ karācārya. 



no precise information can be given on the origin of the YH or on that of its parent text, the VM/N Ṣ A. No ancient manuscript has been found. Abhinavagupta \(c. 975–1025\) does not mention its name, nor does 

* Introduction *

7

Jayaratha \(12th c.\) in his commentary on the *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\). It is not one of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras listed by him when commenting on TĀ 1.18, nor is it quoted or alluded to in other lists of the Śaiva canon. 

A *Yogin ī hṛ daya* is indeed mentioned in a Nepalese manuscript of the eleventh century, but we do not know if this text is the same as the one we have now; it is probably not. Amṛ tānanda, who lived probably in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, says in his commentary on the YH, the *D ī pikā * \(D ī \), that his was the fi rst one made on that work. But surely, if the YH were by then an ancient work, other commentaries would have existed. All of this makes it very unlikely that the date of the YH is earlier than the eleventh century, and it might well be later. 

There are many reasons for believing that the Tripurā tradition originated in northwestern India, more specifi cally in Kashmir. Jayaratha, who was certainly a Kashmiri, mentions in his commentary on the VM two masters as having introduced this *darśana* into Kashmir, and he appears to believe that there was a long tradition of local exegesis. Śivānanda, the thirteenth- or fourteenth-century commentator on the same text, explains certain peculiarities of the *śr ī vidyā* as being a result of the Kashmirian origin of the tradition. Of course, the fact that Jayaratha mentions the tradition as having been brought down into Kashmir \( *kaśmire ṣ u avatārakam* \) may mean that it came from elsewhere, and some scholars believe it originated farther northwest, not far from Kashmir, in U ḍ ḍ iyāna, the valley of Swat \(now in Pakistan\), a region often, but perhaps rather mythically, quoted as the place of origin of several Śaiva Tantric practices or traditions. Central 

India, too, has sometimes been named as the birthplace of this tradition. 15 

All of this is possible. The metaphysics and the vocabulary of the YH, however, are so close to those of the postscriptural Śaiva texts, and espe-

cially to those of the later Pratyabhijñā 16 as expounded by K ṣ emarāja, that its Kashmirian origin seems very likely. \(But since a number of authors on the tradition, such as Puṇyānanda, Śivānanda, and Vidyānanda, were from the south, a South Indian origin of the YH, however unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.\) 

The Tripurā cult was certainly present at a comparatively early date in the North Indian Himalayan area. There seem to be ancient traces of it in Nepal. Even if it began in the north, Tripurā’s cult appears to have soon spread to the south, as shown by works of such authors as those noted above. A large number of Śr ī vidyā works come from the south, and the many manuscripts mostly in South Indian scripts that are found nowadays in libraries all over India testify to the comparatively early and

widespread popularity of the Tripurā cult. This fact is also interesting in that it shows the vitality and importance, from ancient times, of intellectual contacts between diff erent parts of the Indian subcontinent. 



there are two important commentaries on the YH. The earlier one is the *D ī pikā* \(“The Lamp”\) by Amṛ tānanda, which we often refer to here \(abbreviating it as D ī \) since it is used as the basis of our explanation of the YH. The other one is the *Setubandha* by Bhāskararāya, who lived in Mysore and Varanasi at the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. It is a commentary on both the VM/N Ṣ A and the YH, treating them as one and the same work. Amṛ tānanda’s D ī interprets the YH in the spirit of the later Pratyabhijñā as developed by K ṣ emarāja, which shows that even if Amṛ tānanda was South Indian, he was nevertheless steeped in the Kashmirian Śaiva nondualist tradition. Bhāskararāya’s *Setubandha* , on the other hand, which was fi nished, we are told, on the Śivaratri day of Śaka 1655 \( a.d. 1733\), is the work of a much later remarkable polymath \(more than forty works are ascribed to him\), not characteristically written in the spirit of a particular sectarian tradition but very true to the Tantric spirit of the YH. It is clear and useful. 17 There are other commentaries of lesser interest. 

It may be useful here to draw the reader’s attention to the fact that Indian religious or philosophical texts, often obscure or arcane or cast in 

brief elliptical statements, 18 were meant to be made explicit by commen-

taries given orally through the teaching of masters or in written exegetical works. This is how Indian traditions appeared and developed, permitting 

“change in continuity.” Truth being deemed to have been proclaimed in the origins of time—or out of time—in the Veda, or by deities, nothing could be added to it except by way of commentaries and explanations. 

A problem that arises concerning the text of the YH is its relationship to the VM/N Ṣ A. The three chapters of the YH have often been considered to be the latter part of a work in eight chapters, the fi rst fi ve of which constitute the VM/N Ṣ A. The YH begins with the Goddess asking Bhairava to explain to her “the many unknown elements that are in this Vāmakeśvaratantra” \( *vāmakeśvaratantre ‘sminn ajñātārthas anekaśaå* \). The YH would thus appear to be an esoteric complement to the more exoteric VM, which is a work of erotic magic and ritual, whereas the YH is mainly metaphysical and devotional, even in its third chapter on the *śr ī cakrapūjā* . 

To this can be added that Amṛ tānanda sometimes refers to the VM in his D ī , notably when explaining why a particular point is or is not mentioned 

* Introduction *

9

in the YH or in his own commentary, and that Bhāskararāya later wrote his commentary, *Setubandha* , on all eight chapters of the two texts as if they constituted a single work, and he states explicitly that the YH is the latter half of the Tantra: *tantrottarārdham. * 

There are, however, convincing reasons to believe that these two works are related but distinct texts, probably of diff erent periods. For instance, Śivānanda and Vidyānanda never refer to the YH in their commentaries on the N Ṣ A. Jayaratha, when commenting on the VM, mentions several earlier commentators on the same, while Amṛ tānanda, in his D ī , says that he is the fi rst to comment on the YH. Not only is the spirit of the two works very diff erent, but the YH also gives the *śr ī vidyā* in the so-called *hādi* form, whereas the NŚA/VM gives it in the *kādi* form. 19 For these reasons and several others, we believe that the VM and the YH are two diff erent works, the VM being the earlier one and the YH being composed to complement it philosophically, which is why these two texts came, at some later period, to be considered as two sections of one work. 



the Śr ī vidyā or Tripurā tradition constitutes one of the “transmissions”—the *dak ṣ ināmnāya* —of the Kula, and the YH, which is one of its basic texts, is a Tantric work. It is Tantric both in its spirit, its theology, and its metaphysics and in its ritual practices and forms of worship. 

It is Tantric in its conception of the supreme deity as inseparably male and female, Bhairava and Tripurasundar ī , the latter being, theologically, the supreme goddess but metaphysically subordinated to Bhairava, who is Śiva. The Goddess is also Śakti, the divine universal power that creates and animates the cosmos in all its aspects, human, material, mundane, or supramundane, her power spreading out as a hierarchy of feminine deities or energies radiating concentrically from her; this characteristically Tantric “mandalic” aspect of the pantheon is found in the whole of South Asia. It is illustrated here by the *śr ī cakra* with the deities who abide in it. 

Also Tantric is the notion of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , the divine cosmic power present in the human body. The Tantric adept lives with the image of this both human and divine power present in the image of his body, this structure of centers \( *cakras* , etc.\) or nodal points \( *granthis* \) connected by subtle tubes or channels, the *nā ḍ is* , where the life breath, the *prāṇa* \( *prāṇas* , rather, for they are numerous\) circulates along with the mantras. 

This structure, imagined, visualized, even sometimes “felt” as present \(“intraposed”\) within his physical body by the yogin, is usually called 

“subtle body” in English. We do not use this expression because it is a

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

misnomer. In *all* Sanskrit texts, the term *sūk ṣ maśar ī ra* \(or *sūk ṣ madeha* \), which means “subtle body,” designates not this structure but the transmigrating element in the human being, which is made up of diff erent *tattvas* and therefore has no shape, no visible aspect. It cannot be visualized as is the inner structure of *cakras* and *nā ḍ is* . We call it yogic body or imaginal yogic body, not subtle body. 

The presence and the meditative and ritual use of this purely mental \(but existentially perceived\) image of the body is fundamentally Tantric, even though it is used by most non-Tantric practitioners of yoga. Also Tantric, of course, is the worship beginning with an inner \( *āntara* \), entirely mental *pūjā* , followed by the outer \( *bāhya* \) worship organized following the traditional Tantric pattern, which includes not only visualisations \( *dhyāna* \) but also yogic phases during which the offi

ciating adept is to awaken his 

*kuṇḍ alin ī * . The *pūjā * ends with a *japa* of the *śr ī vidyā* , which is, in fact, a practice of *kuṇḍ alin ī * yoga. The off erings made during the worship, being Tantric, include meat and alcohol. But there are no sexual rites. 

We will comment further on these Tantric aspects, and mention other ones, as they occur in the three chapters of the YH. Here we underline only a few particular points. 

* Yoginī *

The Yogin ī of the title is the goddess Tripurasundar ī . Amṛ tānanda, in his D ī , explains that she is so called because she manifests the coming together \( *yoga* \) of all the constitutive elements of the universe. She bears this name, he says, because she is eternally in union, *yoga* , with Śiva. 

These explanations are of some value insofar as they underscore the at once transcendent and immanent nature of the Goddess Śakti and her indissoluble union with Śiva. 

The name Yogin ī is also interesting as a reminder of the links between the Tripurā tradition, as an *āmnāya* of the Kula, with the ancient \(but still surviving\) Yogin ī cults. This tradition having as its main deity a goddess who is the supreme power, Śakti, surrounded by a retinue of feminine secondary deities/powers— *ṣ aktis, * which are also Yogin ī s—could be called Śākta. But the so-called Śākta systems developed in a Śaiva context and are in eff ect Śaiva. Metaphysically, Tripurasundar 

ī is subordinated to 

Paramaśiva, the supreme level of the godhead. The YH is expounded by Bhairava, the fearsome form of Śiva, in answer to a question of the Goddess. 

True, he does so because she orders him \(“I am ordered by You,” *tvayāham *

* Introduction *

11

*ājñaptaḥ* \), but this order is a form of his own will \( *madicchārūpayā* , 3.202\). 

As the D ī explains, the universe is the “play” \( *l ī lā* , *kṛ ḍ * \) of Śakti, but Śiva is her master. Theologically, in the devotion and worship of her devotees, the Goddess is supreme; but if Śiva and Ṣ akti are inseparable, Śiva, the masculine aspect of the total supreme godhead, is higher: Ṣ akti is Śiva’s energy. Tripurā’s tradition is therefore Śaiva. 20 

Surrounded by the Yogin ī s abiding in the *śr ī cakra* —in the cosmos, that is—Tripurasundar ī is the fi rst of them, infusing them with her power and presiding over their activity. They emanate from her in a hierarchical order, embodying and spreading her power on all planes of the cosmos and fulfi lling the functions allotted to them. As Bhairava says in YH 3.194: “You alone it is, Enchantress of the worlds, who are playing under the guise of these \[deities\].” They are aspects \( *rūpa* \) she takes on in her cosmic play. 

In the Tantras and the Purāṇas, the Yogin ī s are usually said to be sixty-four in number, which is eight times eight, that is, eight times the Eight Mothers \( *a ṣ ṭ amātaraḥ* , *a ṣ ṭ amātṛ kā* \). 21 In the third chapter \(3.193\), the 

YH multiplies this number by ten million, mentioning sixty-four crores 22 

of Yogin ī s, to be worshipped in an eightfold ritual. In the *śr ī cakra* , however, although they are in eight groups \(plus the Goddess\), corresponding to the structure of the diagram, they number seventy-eight. Their names also are not those usually found in the Purāṇas. 

* Hṛdaya *



The great secret \( 

*mahāguhya* 

\) disclosed to initiates by the YH is the 

*Yogin ī hṛ daya* , the “Heart of the Yogin ī ,” by which is meant the supreme reality, the supreme divine plane where the Goddess, consciousness \(of\) itself, manifests her power and her glory. She does this by means of the *śr ī cakra* and the *śr ī vidyā* , which are not a mere ritual diagram and a mere mantra but her visual, or diagrammatic, and her phonic form, two aspects of her cosmic creative \(and destructive\) power. 

The heart as the supreme reality, as the spiritual plane, and as the center in the human body \(or, more exactly, in the image of the body\) where this reality is revealed and experienced is an ancient Indian notion. 

It was taken over and developed in nondualist shaivism by such authors as Utpaladeva, Abhinavagupta, and K ṣ emarāja, who described it in his commentary on the Śivasūtras as being “the light of consciousness since it is the place where everything abides” \( *viśvaprati ṣ ṭ hasthānatvāt citprakāśo* *hṛ dayam* \). He also describes it as throbbing and fl ashing consciousness 

12

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

\( *sphurant ī ṁ saṁvidam* \) or as both made of the world and transcending it \( *viśvātmakaṁ tadutt ī rṇam* \). It is therefore the total plenitude of the godhead as mystically experienced in one’s heart. 23 \(We must not forget that in traditional India, the center of consciousness is in the heart, not in the brain.\) 

* Mudraˉ *

*Mudrās* do not play a fundamental role in the YH. Their case, however, needs to be mentioned here because of the particular conception of *mudrās* in Tantric texts. They are not mere symbolical gestures evoking a deity or some person or entity, object, or feeling, as is true of the *mudrās* \(or *hastas* \) of dance or theater. They are both evocative/invocative gestures and—in the case of deities or powers—the supernatural entity they evoke or symbolize. They are both bodily gestures or attitudes by which the performer invokes and makes present \(and, up to a point, identifi es with\) the entities they symbolize *and* these very entities. The nine *mudrās* described in *śl* . 59–61 of the fi rst chapter of the YH are nine deities, ancillary goddesses of Tripurasundar ī made present by a gesture whose performance \(together with the mental visualization\) identifi es the adept with that deity. 

\(Such deities are to be worshipped during the *śr ī cakra pūjā* , as we shall see in the third chapter.\) 

Gestures are an important element in human communication. They 

play a role in support of language. They also supplement it. In ritual, they have meaning and power, and they act, usually by accompanying a mantra but also sometimes by their own visual/bodily power; this appears clearly here in chapter 1. 

For many texts, *mudrās* are more than gesture; they are mystical attitudes, and in practicing them, the yogin identifi es with a deity or even with the absolute. Such is the case, for instance, with the *mudrās* described in the *Vijñānabhairava* or those described in chapter 32 of Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka* , where he explains that the *mudrā* , together with the mental concentration of the adept, brings about the presence of the deity invoked and identifi es the adept with it. 

* Metaphysics *

The philosophical conceptions of the YH can be said to be those of the nondualist Kashmirian shaivism, and especially those of the *pratyabhijñā* -based 

* Introduction *

13

Trika as expounded notably by Abhinavagupta. This is one more reason for believing the YH to have been elaborated, if not in Kashmir, then at least, and certainly, in circles where the Kashmirian Śaiva tradition was active. 

The supreme reality \( *paramaṁ mahat* , *mahātattva* , or *mahāsattā* , the 

“Great Being”\) is described as transcendent, undivided \( *ni ṣ kala* , 1.27\), transcending space and time, pure light \( *prakāśa* , 1.11\), 24 and consciousness \( *saṁvit* , 1.10\). It is also the phoneme *A* , the “unsurpassed” or “peerless one” \( *anuttara* \). This absolute fl ashes forth, vibrates luminously \( *sphurattā* , *ullāsa* \). It expands as a luminous wave \( *sphuradūrmi* , 1.10\) by its own free will \( *svecchayā* , 1.9\) and manifests thus the whole cosmos made up of the thirty-six *tattvas* , from Śiva to the earth \( *pṛ thiv ī * , 2.32–33\). This universe, manifested 25 as if by play \( *l ī lā* \), is pervaded by the divine power or energy; everything, from the gods to this earthly world, is in fact the Goddess herself, supreme splendor \( *paraṁ tejas* , 1.72\), “surrounded by the sparkling waves of her multitudinous energies” \(1.55\). Of this manifestation, the Goddess is luminously conscious \( *prakā ṣ āmarśana* \) as it unfolds “on the screen of her own self” \( *ātmabhittau* , 1.56\). She vibrates \( *spandarūpiṇī * \), being immersed in bliss \( *ānanda* \). Although transcendent \( *viśvott ī rṇa* \), the Goddess as supreme power \( *paramaśakti* \) is also immanent, “made of the world” \( *viśvamaya* \), that is, embodied in everything that exists. The cosmos is her manifested form, but although she is shining, “Flame of the essence of divine play” \( *divyakr ī d rasojjvala* , 2.76\) as the absolute, she is ever pure, undivided light and bliss. All these notions and the terms used are typical of nondualist shaivism. 

The YH, however, is not a philosophical treatise aiming at expounding particular metaphysical tenets. Neither was that the aim of the D ī , in spite of the fact that its interpretation of the sutras always develops their metaphysical import. The aim of this text \(and of practically all Indian metaphysical systems\) 26 was, while conveying an esoteric teaching, to show a way toward liberation—more precisely to a Tantric form of liberation in this life, *j ī vanmukti* , which is both liberation from the fetters of this world and domination over it. This is the raison d’être of the three chapters of the YH. 

* Chapter 1: * Cakrasaṁketa \(86 ślokas \) * *

The YH does not say here how to draw the *śr ī cakra* \(nor does Amṛ tānanda in the D ī \). It describes how it appears as an outward manifestation of the power of the Goddess, who is deemed to have agreed with her consort, 

14

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Śiva, to be present with him in the *śr ī cakra* , hence the title of the chapter, *Cakrasaṁketa* . What is described is a cosmic process bringing about the existence of the *cakra* that embodies this process and mediates it to the *sādhaka* who is to visualize mentally its aspect and its dynamism through an intense identifying form of meditation called *bhāvanā* . 27 

After presenting the dialogue, in the Absolute, between the Goddess and Bhairava, which makes up the text of the YH, the chapter fi rst describes the cosmic unfolding of the *śr ī cakra* from the central *bindu* to the outer square \( *śl* . 10–21\). Then the adept, following a reverse movement, since he is a human being, is to visualize and perceive within himself the three main constituent parts of the *cakra* , going from the outer square to the center. Now, once the meditation of the *sādhaka* has reached the central *bindu* , he is to evoke and follow mentally the ascending levels of phonic energy \(the *kalās* , “parts”\), from *ardhacandra* to *unmanā* , of the utterance \( *uccāra* \) 28 of the *b ī ja HR Ī Ṃ * , the basic mantra of the Goddess. 

The mental process goes thus from the spatial, visual domain of the diagram to the oral one, as if sound were felt as a subtle extension of space. The adept is to meditate there on three planes of the Word, *vāc* , from the supreme, *parā* , to the intermediate, *madhyamā* , 29 and to evoke the fi fty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet while also meditating such entities as *p ī ṭ has* or *li ṅ gas* \( *śl* . 37–49\). He is to conceive the *śr ī cakra* as being the universe produced by the will \( *icchā* \) of the deity, a will that is eventually to become action \( *kriyā* \) and which is then *mudrā* “because it rejoices \[ *mud* \] the universe and makes it fl ow \[ *rā* \].” 30 Stanzas 57–71 then describe ten *mudrās* that are both ritual hand gestures and aspects of the Goddess, corresponding also to the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* \(and to its entirety\). The *mudrās* symbolize or, more accurately, are actually stages in the progression of the *sādhaka* from the outer world where he lives to the godhead. 

Other meditations on the *śr ī cakra* are then prescribed, all meant to help the adept to realize the metaphysical import of the diagram as the form the Goddess takes on in her cosmic creative \(and destructive\) play; added to the preceding ones, this *bhāvanā* will lead him to liberation. 

* Chapter 2: * Mantrasaṁketa \(85 ślokas \) 

Although this chapter is entirely based on the phonetic pattern of the *śr ī vidyā* \(in which the Goddess and Śiva have agreed to meet; this is the 

*saṁketa* 

of the chapter’s name\), its syllabic composition—its 

* Introduction *

15

“extraction,” *uddhāra* , 31 as it is usually called—is not given. In this, the YH diff ers from its parent text, the N Ṣ A, which does give it. It appears, however, that the *śr ī vidyā* is considered to be made up of fi fteen syllables grouped in three clusters, as follows: *HA SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ • HA* *SA HA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ • SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ * . This is, as we have said, the *śr ī vidyā * in the so-called *hādi* form, because it begins with *HA* . There is also another form, called *kādi* \(because the fi rst cluster begins with *KA* \): *KA E I LA HR Ī Ṃ * . These two forms are used in two Tripurā traditions called, respectively, *hādimata* and *kādimata* , which seem to have existed from comparatively ancient times since they are mentioned by such authors as Śivānanda \(13th c.\). 32 The three clusters of the *śr ī vidyā* 

are called *kū ṭ a* , which means “summit” or “group”; they are also called *b ī ja* or *piṇḍ a* . 

The *mantrasaṁketa* ’s purpose is to give six diff erent “meanings” \( *artha* \) by means of allegorical symbolical interpretations of its syllables—that is, to expound six diff erent ways to understand, perceive, and experiment by *bhāvanā* its inner nature and hidden meaning, a practice that will lead the *sādhaka* toward liberation. These interpretations are abstruse and often far-fetched, and we have not always understood them in spite of help received from Professor V. V. Dvivedi of Varanasi. 

The chapter begins by enumerating the *vidyās* \(i.e., mantras\) of the nine *cakreśvar ī s* , the regent deities of the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* , which the adept must place by *nyāsa* on nine parts of his yogic body and worship there as present in the nine constitutive *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra. * 

Then is expounded the fi rst *artha* , the *bhāvārtha* \( *śl. * 16–25\). It is based on symbolical values given to the syllables of the *vidyā* , the three parts of which are described as resulting from the union of Śiva and Śakti, from whose interactive union \( *saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* \) 33 the “fl ow,” the creative play of the mantra, is deemed to issue. This very fl ow expressed by the phonetic constituents of the *śr ī vidyā* , manifests, sustains, animates, and ultimately reabsorbs the cosmos, a process the adept must experience spiritually through a *bhāvanā* in which the three parts of the mantra are experienced as fused with his *kuṇḍ alin ī * . The power of the *vidyā* also takes on here the form of the *kāmakalā * \( *śl* . 21–25\), a diagram whose symbolism, based on the sexual union of Śiva and Śakti, is both visual and phonic. 34 

The *saṁpradāya artha* , the “traditional meaning” \( *śl* . 26–48\) shows how the cosmic process is pervaded by the *śr ī vidyā* , that is, by the united Śiva and Śakti. To this eff ect, the YH explains how the constitutive elements of 

16

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

the universe— *tattvas, guṇas* , *prāṇas* , and so forth, even the gods—come to be manifested. All of this is grasped and experienced by *bhāvanā* . 

The *nigarbha artha* 

, the “inner meaning,” very briefl y considered, 

\( *śl* . 48–51\), is the essential oneness of Śiva, the guru, and the self of the *sādhaka* , who is to realize it by *bhāvanā* , thanks also to his devotion and to the power of the guru’s gaze \( *nir ī k ṣ aṇa* \). 35 

The *kaulikārtha* , the Kula meaning of the *vidyā* \( *śl* . 51–68\), is meant to bring about a realization by the adept of the essential oneness of the *cakra* , the godhead, the *vidyā* , the guru, and his own self. The *śr ī cakra* is shown as being born from the phonemes of the *vidyā* ; as being the cosmic, essential body \( *vapus* \) of the Goddess; and as having the *vidyā* as its essential nature. The Goddess is described as present in the cosmos as fi ve diff erent groups of divine aspects or entities, Yogin ī s and so on. The adept is to realize and experience by *bhāvanā * that all of this is present in the *cakra* and in the *vidyā* and in his own body and that of the guru. To realize this is to gain liberation. 

The *sarvarahasya* , the “most secret of all” *arthas* \( *śl* . 69–72\), is secret because it is a most direct way to fusion with the godhead. It is a *kuṇḍ alin ī * 

yoga practice where the parts of the *śr ī vidyā* , the fi fty Sanskrit phonemes, and the thirty-eight cosmic *kalās* are interiorized by the adept and made to ascend with his *kuṇḍ alin ī * . He thus experiences a cosmic pervasion lead-ing to liberation. 

Finally, the *mahātattva artha* , the one concerning the highest reality \( *śl* . 

73–80\), is the nondual realization of the Absolute “in the fl ashing forth of the essence of the divine play.” This *artha* is meant for the “heroes” 

\( *v ī ra* \), followers of the *kaulācāra* , the practice of Kula, who participate in the ritual meetings of the Yogin ī s \( *yogin ī melana* \). The practice described here seems to be mainly meditative, not actually sexual. It shows, however, the surviving links of the Tripurā tradition with the earlier *kāpālika* Kula practices, an aspect that the adepts of the South Indian Śr ī vidyā later tried to blot out. 

* Chapter 3: * Pūjaˉsaṁketa \(204 ślokas \) 

This chapter is the longest of the YH. It accounts for more than half of the work. Although the Goddess is to be visualized during the worship, which is performed on the *śr ī cakra* without any material icon, she is not described here as she is, for instance, in *śl* . 130–146 of the fi rst chapter of the N Ṣ A. Only her theological and metaphysical traits as the supreme 

* Introduction *

17

deity are given. Tripurasundar ī , in N Ṣ A, is described as a beautiful young woman, luminous like the rising sun, having three eyes, a half-moon on her forehead, and a crown of jewels on her hair. She wears gold brace-lets, is clad in a red garment, and is seated on a lotus. She holds in her two upper hands a noose \( *pāśa* \) and an elephant-goad \( *a ṅ kuśa* \) and in her two lower hands a bow \( *dhanus* \) and arrows \( *bāṇa* \). These four attributes are quoted in YH 1.53 as those of Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvar ī , who, taken together, are forms of Tripurasundar ī . 

The fi rst *pūjā* 

described is the 

*nityāpūjā* 

, the worship all Hindus 

must perform daily. Some are occasional \( *naimittika* \) rites, and a few are optional \( *kāmya* \). 36 It is not described in full detail, except for the *nyāsa* and the *japa* , two rites meant to identify the offi

ciating adept with the 

deity. Some rites are hardly dealt with. The YH underscores the parts of the ritual that aim more specifi cally at helping the *sādhaka* to identify with the godhead, which is the raison d’être of the YH but which is an essential aspect of Tantric worship. Its performance is a means, if not to gain, at least to progress toward liberation. In fact, no Tantric worship may be performed if one is not already divinized by a preliminary ritual. 

It is said, *nādevo devam arcayet* \(“One who is not God must not worship God”\). But although he is thus already ritually divinized, the offi ciant 

must still perform during the worship several rites that will advance him toward the goal of identifi cation with the deity he worships. 37 In such a view, the ritual is seen more as a spiritual exercise than as a mere worship of the deity. 

This explains why the chapter begins by saying that there are three sorts of *pūjā* , the lowest of which is the ritually performed one. The highest one \( *śl* . 3a, 4b–7\), the “supreme worship,” is purely spiritual. It is a *bhāvanā* 

associated with an ascent of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , by which the adept experiences mystically his unity with the supreme Śiva. It is the total plenitude of the absolute I \( *pūrṇāhaṁbhava* \), an experience of the nature of the Goddess as the fl ashing forth of consciousness. The second sort is “nonsupreme” 

\( *apara* \). It is the *cakrapūja* as described in this chapter. Bhairava says here \( *śl* . 3b\) that he performs it ceaselessly; it is a divine, not a human, activity. 

Then there is \( *śl* . 4a\) the “supreme-nonsupreme worship” \( *parāparāpūjā* \). 

It consists in “seeing all that appears of itself” and especially, it seems, all rites as being in truth of a purely spiritual nature. 

The description of the nonsupreme \( *aparapūjā* \), ritually performed worship begins next. It fi lls *śl. * 8–199. It conforms to the usual pattern of the Tantric worship, whose dual \(if somewhat contradictory\) aim is to 

18

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

identify the performer with the deity while worshipping her. It includes the following items: 

Four succeeding series of ritual placings \( *nyāsa* \) of mantras, of deities, and of the *śr ī cakra* on the body of the offi ciating adept 

\( *śl. * 8–89\). 

The construction of the throne \( *āsana* \) of the Goddess and the off ering of a propitiatory oblation \(a *bali* \) to the Yogin ī s \( *śl. * 90\). This is where an “inner sacrifi ce” \( *antaryāga* \), or “worship of the self \( *ātmapūjā* \), should normally take place, but the YH does not mention it. 

Removal of obstacles \( *vighnabheda* \) \( *śl* . 92–93\). 

Worship of the sun \( *sūryapūjā* \). This is a preliminary rite of all Śaiva cults, with the sun being worshipped as an aspect of Śiva \( *śl. * 94–95\). 

Drawing of the *śr ī cakra* on which the ritual worship is to be performed \( *śl. * 95–97\). 

Off ering of the “common *arghya* ”—consecrated water and so on—on a special diagram; worship of the *āsana* and *p ī ṭ ha* and of the *kalās* of fi re, sun, and moon \( *śl. * 98–100\). 

Preparation of the “special *arghya* ” \( *vi ṣ eśārghya* \), which, as appears later on, includes wine, and off ering it to Bhairava and to the succession of masters \( *gurupa ṅ kti* \) \( *śl. * 103–104\). 

Inner oblation \( *homa* \) in the “fi re of desire” \( *kāmāgni* \). This is normally performed materially at the end of the ritual. Here it is an interiorized, mystical oblation \( *śl. * 105–108\). 

*Śr ī cakrapūjā* , worship of the Goddess and of her retinue of deities \( *āvaraṇadevatā* \) with sixteen off erings or services \( *upacāra* \), on each of the diff erent parts of the *śr ī cakra* , from the outer square to the center \( *śl. * 109–161\). This is the main part of the *pūjā* . It ends with the off ering of the “lamp of Kula” \( *kūlad ī pa* \), together with wine and pieces of meat \( *śl. * 165–168\). 

*Japa* of the *śr ī vidyā* \( *śl. * 169–188\). 

“Satisfaction” \( *tarpana* \) of the deities of the *cakra* with off erings of wine, meat, and fi sh \( *śl. * 190\). 

Occasional \( *naimittika* \) rituals to be performed on certain days to the Yogin ī s of the *śr ī cakra* \( *śl ̥ . * 191–197\). 

Taking in by the offi

ciant of the leftovers of the off erings to the deity 

and fi nal *bali* to Ba ṭ uka and K ṣ etrapāla. 

* Introduction *

19

The last stanzas \(199–204\) deal with the fruits, worldly or otherworldly, resulting from the performance of the *pūjā* . 

All of these rites will be explained and discussed later, with the translation of chapter 3. The following, however, may be said now about some of them. 

*Nyaˉsa* 

Eighty-one stanzas, nearly one-fi fth of the chapter, are taken up by the prescription of this long and complex ritual, which is indeed important since it infuses the body of the offi

ciating adept with the powers of the 

Goddess, identifying him with her. First, six diff erent “forms” \( *rūpa* \)—

we could say epiphanies, divine and cosmic—of the Goddess are placed. 

This ritual placing \(or imposition\) being sixfold, it is called *ṣ o ḍ hānyāsa* . It is considered particularly important and effi

cacious. It is prescribed and 

extolled in many of the texts, ancient or modern, of the Tripurā/Śr ī vidyā 

tradition. It is also mentioned in other Śaiva traditions. 38 Next \( *śl. * 41–68\) comes the *nyāsa* of the *śr ī cakra* , fi rst of its nine concentric parts, then of the deities abiding in those parts, going from the outer square, imposed on the extremities of the body, to the Goddess, imposed on the heart. This is followed by another placing \(the third series of *nyāsas* \) of these deities, starting with the Goddess and ending with the Siddhis of the outer square. These two rites will increase the feeling of identifi cation of the offi

ciant with the Goddess by an interiorization of her diagrammatic cosmic form. The YH says \( *śl. * 81\) that he is now to consider himself as inseparable from her \( *svābhedena cintayet* \). Then, as a fourth series of *nyāsas* \( *śl. * 

81–86\), come eight diff erent placings of various entities on the hands and on other parts of the body. The *nyāsas* end with a libation \( *saṁtarpana* \) to the Goddess, which is, in fact, a meditative practice with an ascent of *kuṇḍ alin ī * ; this somehow confi rms the ritual identifi cation of the adept with the deity he worships. 

*Śrīcakrapūjaˉ* 

This is not a worship of the *śr ī cakra* but a worship, performed on the *cakra* , of Tripurasundar ī , who resides in its center while also pervading it, and of all the deities of her retinue placed in concentric tiers around her in the diff erent parts of the diagram. They are worshipped going from the outer 

20

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

square to the inner triangle, the Goddess herself being worshipped in the whole *śr ī cakra* since it is her diagrammatic cosmic form. 

We have already enumerated the diff erent parts of this *pūjā* . We note here, however, that in each of the constituent parts of the *śr ī cakra* , a Siddhi is worshipped, which is both a deity and a supernatural, magical power. 

Thus, the worship in each of the *cakras* confers on the *sādhaka* one of the eight main magical powers, the *mahāsiddhis* , *aṇimā* , and so on. 39 The ritual worship, therefore, is not only a means to approach the Goddess and identify with her but also a means to acquire supernatural powers, as is expressly stated in *śl* . 189 and 203 of the chapter. This is in conformity with the Tantric conception of liberation in this life, which confers worldly powers along with liberation. 

The *pūjā* is made up of a number of sometimes complex rites organized as a dynamic, coherent ritual process, with two intermediate meditative periods, carrying the worshipper from the outer, ordinary world to the realm of the gods, a process during which he acts out symbolically an inner transformation from his condition of a mere mortal being to that of *j ī vanmukti* by identifi cation with the godhead. Progressing along this structured ritual and spiritual path, the offi

ciating adept, after “enter-

ing” the diagram by paying homage to the lower and most external deities abiding in the outer square, the *bhūgṛ ha* ; purifi es his hands and his *prāṇa* \(in the two lotuses\); then causes his *kuṇḍ alin ī * to ascend and feels thus absorbed into the cosmic energy \(the *kulaśakti* \), which is also present in his body, this in the *cakra* of fourteen triangles. As he concentrates on an inner subtle phonic resonance \( *nāda* \), he raises his *kuṇḍ alin ī * again from the *mūlādhāra* to the *ājñācakra* \(in the fi rst *cakra* of ten angles\), and then, along with the *kuṇḍ alin ī * \(in the second ten-angles *cakra* \), he becomes absorbed in his own essence. After that, as his *prāṇa* is concentrated in his heart \( *cakra* of eight triangles\), he realizes the pure essence of consciousness, and \(having attained the central triangle\) he worships the higher deities destructive of the cosmos surrounding the Goddess, which means that he rises to the source of the universe. The worship having now reached the central *bindu* “whose nature is that of the supreme *brahman* ,” 

the adept worships Tripurasundar ī in the whole *śr ī cakra* since she pervades it. This he does “in total freedom,” that is, with the absolute liberty of one who has outsoared \(ritually, of course\) all limitations. 

Perceived in this way, as a movement from this world to the supreme deity, the *pūjā* is for the adept not a random succession of discrete ritual actions but a total and fulfi lling existential experience of participation in

the divine, a coherent progress toward the Absolute realized by an identifi cation with the cosmic play of the Goddess. 

*Japa* 

Finally comes the *japa* , the recitation of the *śr ī vidyā* , the *mūlamantra* of the Goddess, a rite performed in the last part of all ritual Hindu worships. 

The *japa* prescribed here is, however, not really a recitation. It is a complex spiritual and yogic exercise associating the enunciation \( *uccāra* \) of the *vidyā* with visualizations and with the ascent of *kuṇḍ alin ī * . The *uccāra* is, in fact, an upward movement of the phonic resonance of the *śr ī vidyā* along the *su ṣ umnā* , going from the *mūlādhāra* up to the *dvādaśānta* , 40 inseparable from the ascent of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * . It is therefore a practice of Tantric mantrayoga where the *śr ī vidyā * is used as a means to facilitate the fusion of the adept with the cosmic divine power of the Goddess. 

The *japa* is made up of four meditative-yogic practices: *Japa* of the three parts of the *śr ī vidyā* \( *śl. * 169–173\). This consists in visualizing the three parts and the nine constituent *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* as tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* , then to perceive the *kalās* of the subtle vibration of the *b ī ja HR Ī Ṃ * , which ends these three parts \( *kū ṭ a* \) of the mantra as ascending from the *mūlādhāra* to the heart, then from the heart to the *ājñācakra* and thence up to the *dvādaśānta* , where the threefold phonic vibration reaches the plane of *unmanā* , the “transmental,” and dissolves into the silence of the Absolute, with which the adept also fuses. Table 3.1 in chapter 3 

shows the pattern of this *japa* . 

*Japa* of the sixfold void, *śūnya ṣ a ṭ kam* \( *śl. * 174–175\). This practice involves only the *uccāra* of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * and their *kalās* , the *uccāra* being organized along six “voids,” or points of the yogic body. It does not seem to include visualizations. Like the fi rst one, it leads to a fusion with the Absolute “in the central void of the divine undivided Consciousness,” says the D ī . 

*Japa* of the fi ve states of consciousness, the *avasthās: jāgrat* , waking; *svapna* , dream; *su ṣ upti* , dreamless sleep; *turya* , the “fourth” state; and *turyāt ī ta* , “above the fourth” \( *śl. * 176–180\). It is also an *uccāra* of the *śr ī vidyā* with which the adept experiences these states, from the ordinary waking state up to the highest, “above the fourth,” which is identical with the absolute divine Consciousness. 

22

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

*Japa* of seven “equalizations,” *vi ṣ uvas* \( *śl. * 181–193\). This is the longest practice, since it includes seven *japas* . It is also the most diffi cult to 

understand, since the nature of these *vi ṣ uvas* —apparently states of equilibrium of the *prāṇas* —does not appear clearly. It is also a meditative practice whose aim, as with the preceding ones, is to bring about a fusion of the adept with the Absolute. It is a somatopsy-chic—bodily, mental, and spiritual—practice; in the Tantric domain, whatever is experienced spiritually is also “lived” in the body. 

Finally, the third chapter describes the last off erings of the *pūjā* . It ends, too \( *śl. * 188–189\), by promising the adept who has performed all of these deifying rites or practices \(and who is, we may believe, on the way to liberation\) not liberation, *j ī vanmukti* , but that he will rapidly be in possession of all possible supernatural powers. This may strike us as something of an anticlimax. But on the one hand, is this ritual worship meant to lead progressively, by its daily practice, toward liberation, or is it not rather an acting out of such liberating experiences? Be that as it may, the fact is that the *śr ī cakrapūjā* , being performed repeatedly every day, cannot but create mental impregnations \( *vāsanas* \) which can eventually bring the performer, if not to liberation, at least to its threshold. This salvifi c effi cacy 

can act progressively with the repeated performance of the *pūjā* , whereas the magical powers are “rapidly” obtained; both can therefore be given by the same ritual. On the other hand, in the Tantric perspective, liberation and powers are inseparably linked: a *j ī vanmukta* may despise supernatural powers, consider them as fetters, but he is necessarily endowed with them. We may recall here the Śivasūtras, or Abhinavagupta stating that whatever the *j ī vanmukta* says is mantra and that all of his actions are *mudrās* ; these are supernatural actions resulting from the condition of liberation in life. The Tantric perfection is metaphysically not of this world, but it takes place in it. It is not disincarnate. It is total plenitude \( *pūrṇa* \). It is experienced, “lived,” on all planes of being. The liberated person is free from the fetters and illusions of this world: he or she outsoars it but also dominates it. The quest of a magical domination of the world is, as much as the hope for liberation, an Indian dream. 



the edition used for this translation is the one prepared, on the basis of several manuscripts, by Pdt. Vrajvallabh Dvivedi, former head of the Yoga-Tantra Department of the Varanasi Sanskrit University, which was published by Motilal Banarsidass in Delhi in 1988, together with

Amṛ tānanda’s commentary, the *D ī pikā* . It is a good edition both of the YH and of the commentary. Professor Dvivedi kindly let me use it before it was published for the French translation I made of this work. 41 For this, and for the help he otherwise extended me, I wish to thank him once more very sincerely. The YH—of which a large number of manuscripts exist in India and Nepal—was fi rst edited in 1923, together with the commentaries of Amṛ tānanda and of Bhāskararāya, by Gopinath Kaviraj; this edition is still available, but it is not very reliable. The YH was also published together with the *Nityā ṣ o ḍ aśikārṇava* and with the *Setubandha* of Bhāskararāya as vol. 53 of the Ānandāśram Sanskrit Series.

* Encounter in the * Cakra * *

cakrasaṁketa 

the 

*yogin ī hṚ daya * begins 

with the Goddess asking her 



consort, Bhairava, to enlighten her on the secret teachings of the Vāmakeśvaratantra—by which is meant either the text of this name or a larger textual ensemble of the Tripurā/Śr ī vidyā tradition \(see introduction, above\). This dialogue being carried out between two deities is viewed as taking place out of time, in the Absolute. 

On the complex meaning of the term *saṁketa* , which cannot be satisfactorily translated by one word and which we try to render here both by encounter \(or co-presence\) and by agreement, see the introduction, above. 

It is this commonly agreed presence of Śiva/Bhairava and the Goddess in the *śr ī cakra* that transforms it in the \(visible\) embodiment of the diff erent aspects of the cosmic creative and reabsorbing power of the Goddess united with Bhairava. It gives its powers and effi

cacy to the *śr ī vidyā* and 

ensures the soteriological effi

cacy of the *pūjā* . 

The Goddess said:

*śr ī devyuvāca* 

O God of gods, great God, expanding in total fullness, there are in this Vāmakeśvatatantra many unknown elements //1// please reveal them entirely, O Bhairava\! 

*devadeva mahādeva paripūrṇaprathāmaya* /

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

25

Bhairava said:

*śr ī bhairava uvāca* 

Hear, O Goddess, the great secret, the Heart of the Yogin ī , supreme. 

//2// What I tell you now out of love for you is to be kept carefully hidden. On earth, it has \[always\] been taught and received by word of mouth. //3// It must not be given to the disciples of other \[masters\], nor to unbelievers, O Goddess\! nor to those who do not wish intensely to hear it, or who do not give over riches. //4// 

*śṛ ṇu devi mahāguhyaṁ yogin ī hṛ dayaṁ param* //2// 

*tvatpr ī tyā kathayāmy adya gopitavyaṁ viśe ṣ ata ḥ * / 

*karṇāt karṇopadeśena saṁprāptam avan ī talam* //3// 

*na deyaṁ paraśi ṣ yebhyo ṇāstikebhyo na ceśvari* / 

*na śuśrū ṣ ālasānāṁ ca naivānarthapradāyinām* //4// 

It can be given to \[someone\] who has been examined and tested 

during half a year. As soon as one knows it, O Woman with beautiful hips\! one attains the state of *khecara* . //5// 

*par ī k ṣ itāya dātavyaṁ vatsarārdho ṣ itāya ca* / 

*etajjñātvā varārohe sadya ḥ khecaratāṁ vrajet* //5// 

Secrecy is always insisted upon in Tantric traditions, which are initiatory. 

The teaching is therefore transmitted secretly by the master, the guru, to a carefully chosen disciple, intent on acquiring the esoteric knowledge of the tradition, fully devoted to his master and careful not to divulge the doctrine to unbelievers. The mention of those who give over riches may well surprise us, but it was traditionally considered one of the ways to gain knowledge—

or at least a means to approach a master. 1 More generally, as is often said in ritual texts, to spend lavishly on costly rituals is meritorious or even a religious duty: one must never be stingy in one’s relationship with the deity. 

We must not forget that in India, poverty is not meritorious; it is an imperfection, a stigma, the result of the play of karma, therefore not unmerited. 

As for *khecaratā, * it is a supernatural power \(a *siddhi* \) consisting in being able to move \( *caratā* \) freely in space \( *khe* \) but, more specifi cally, to move—that is, to fuse spiritually—in the inner space or sky, the heart, the central void \( *kha* \) of consciousness. The Sanskrit term *kha* means a hole, an opening, and, more technically, the void for the axle in the hub of a wheel, a notion metaphysically transposed to mean the “void” \( *śūnya* \), 

26

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

which is the “central” inner essence of the deity: one who moves \( *cara* \) in that void is identifi ed with Śiva. The state of *khecaratā * is thus the highest spiritual attainment: liberation. 

The teaching as expounded by Bhairava now begins:

O Supreme Goddess\! Threefold is the agreed co-presence of the 

goddess Tripurā: the agreement 2 concerning the *cakra* , and those concerning the mantra and the worship. //6// 

*cakrasaṁketako mantrapūjāsaṁketakau tathā * / 

*trividhas tripuradevyā ḥ saṁketa ḥ parameśvari* //6// 

As stated in the introduction above, the adept must realize and experience ritually and mystically the divine co-presence of the two aspects, male and female, of the supreme deity during the practices and observances prescribed in the three chapters of the YH, their spiritual effi cacy resulting 

from this active, dynamic co-presence. 

The fi rst chapter will now describe this divine presence and power as found and understood in the *śr ī cakra* :

As long as one does not know this threefold agreement, one will not be recipient of the supreme authority \[inherent\] in the *cakra* of Tripurā. //7// 

*yāvad etan na jānāti saṁketatrayam uttamam* / 

*na tāvat tripurācakre paramājñādharo bhavet //7//* 

The YH now describes the agreement concerning the *cakra* , that is to say, both the diagrammatic structure of the *cakra* with the deities who reside there and the understanding the disciple must have of this *cakra* as embodying the cosmic manifestation of the power of the Goddess united with Śiva. 

This \[ *cakra* 

includes\] fi ve energies directed toward emanation 

\( *sr ṣ ṭ yā\)* , and four fi res turned toward resorption \( *layena\)* . The *cakra* is \[therefore\] produced by the conjunction of fi ve energies and four fi res. //8// 

*tacchaktipañcakaṁ sṛ ṣ ṭ yā layenāgnicatu ṣ ṭ ayam /* 

*pañcaśakticaturvahnisaṁyogāc cakrasambhava ḥ * //8// 

The concentric series of triangles that make up the *śr ī cakra* result from the intersections of fi ve triangles apex downward: 3 the energies or powers 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

27

\( *śakti* \), the female aspect of the godhead, and four triangles apex upward: the so-called fi res, the male aspect. The energies \( *śakti* \) are creative. The cosmos appears through their play. Fire, on the contrary, evokes destruction, resorption. The total cosmic play of the Goddess, who creates and dissolves the universe, is thus implicitly present in the very pattern of the *śr ī cakra. * 

I will tell you, O Perfect One, the descent \[on earth\] of your *cakra* . 

*etac cakrāvatāraṁ tu kathayāmi tavānaghe* / 

The *śr ī cakra* being the diagrammatic form of the Goddess is a divine, transcendent reality. It therefore comes down to earth \(a process known as *avatāra* \) so as to be perceived and worshipped by the adepts or devotees. 

This happens because the Goddess wills it:

When She, the Supreme Power, \[becoming\] out of her own free will embodied as all that exists \( *viśvarūpiṇī * \), perceives herself as fl ashing forth, the *cakra* then appears. //9// 

*yadā sā paramā śakti ḥ svecchayā viśvarūpiṇī /* /9// 

*sphurattām ātmana ḥ paśyet tadā cakrasya saṁbhava ḥ * / 

The *śr ī cakra* being the cosmic form of the Goddess results from the same act of consciousness or awareness \( *vimarśa* \) of the deity as the cosmos. As Amṛ tānanda says in the D ī , “The intensely luminous fl ashing forth of the Supreme Power is nothing else than the emission of the cosmos.” The apparition of the *śr ī cakra* is therefore described in *ślokas* 10–17 

in terms of a cosmic process that simultaneously manifests the geometric pattern of the *śr ī cakra* and brings about the apparition of the deities that abide in the *cakra* and animate, nay manifest it, by their power. This is why the process is described starting from the center, that is, from the Goddess. 

Note that each of the nine constituting parts of the *śr ī cakra* is called *cakra. * \(See fi gures 1.1 and 1.2.\) 

From the void letter *A* and from that which ends by emission, \[that is\] from the *bindu* , vibrating consciousness whose supreme nature is light and which is united with the fl ashing fl ow \[of divine power, appears\] the throne of the *bindu* \( *baindavāsana* \) which is the \[birth\]

place of the fl ow made up of the three *mātṛ kās* . It then assumes a threefold aspect. // 10cd–12a //

“The void letter *A* ” \( *śūnyākāra* \) is to be understood as the supreme Śiva, and since Śiva precedes creation, it is considered as void. *A* , the fi rst letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is traditionally considered the origin and substrate of the whole alphabet, which, in the Śaiva system of phonetic emanation, is the source and essence of the cosmos. Hence the identifi cation of *A* with the supreme deity.

The *bindu* , the *anusvāra* , the nasal addition to the preceding vowel \( *A* , in this case\), written as a dot over the letter it prolongs, is conceived of as the fusion of Śiva and Śakti into one point of concentrated energy: the notion is both visual \(a dot\) and metaphysical. *Bindu* is thus metaphysically both the totality of the Absolute and the power that will manifest the universe. Being a concentrate of creative power, *bindu* is always described as luminous and vibrating, throbbing. 

The “fl ow of the three *mātṛ kās* ” issuing from it are \(says the D ī \) the three levels of the Word: *paśyant ī , madhyamā* , and *vaikhar ī * , 4 which is another way of saying that the central *bindu* is the birthplace of the whole cosmos, while underlining the fact that the levels of the cosmos appear together with those of the Word and with the letters of the Sanskrit 

30

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

alphabet, which, as we shall see, are in eff ect associated with the diff erent parts of the *śr ī cakra* . 

The triangle surrounding the *bindu* is said to have a threefold aspect insofar as the two triangles \(one of energy, one of fi re, therefore one female, one male\) are added to the central one, which makes three times three. 

This is why the triangular *cakra * surounding the *bindu* is called *navayoni* , ninefold womb. This *navayonicakra* is associated with, or rather brings about the apparition of, nine elements, as follows:

\[Thus appear\] *dharma* and *adharma* , then the \[ four\] *ātman* , 5 the knower, what is to be known and knowledge: the *cakra* is thus a ninefold womb. It is immense, a compact mass of consciousness 

and bliss. A division of mantras in nine \[corresponds to\] this ninefold *cakra* . //12–13// 

*dharmādharmau tathātmanau mātṛ meyau tathā pramā* //12// 

*navayonyātmakam idaṁ cidānandaghanaṁ mahat* / 

*cakraṁ navātmakam idaṁ navadhā bhinnamantrakam* //13// 

*Dharma* 6 is the socioreligious Hindu law, *adharma* its opposite, for there is no rule without its contrary. The four *ātmans* —a notion developed notably in Vedānta—correspond to four levels of the Self as consciousness, from the Absolute to the living being. Together with the knowing subject, objectivity, and knowledge, they make up the whole cosmic manifestation. This is why this *cakra* is considered the womb—the ninefold womb \( *navayoni* \)—of the universe. This *cakra* is said to include nine mantras, those of the of the regent-goddesses \( *cakreśvar ī * \) 7 of the nine parts \( *cakras* \) of the *śr ī cakra* . 



The three categories—knower \( 

*pramātṛ * 

\), object of knowledge 

\( *prameya* \), and means of knowledge \( *pramā * or *pramāṇa* \) 8 —are deemed to recapitulate the totality of the world as experienced by the subject who 

“knows,” perceives what is to be known: the objectivity and who does this using means or criteria of knowledge. It is a very common philosophical notion, which we will meet several times here. 

\[This ninefold *cakra* \] is present in the \[next *cakra* \], of eight triangles, in the form of Ambikā, surrounded by vowels, it is the dynamism of consciousness, 9 the fi re of resorption rising from the throne of the *bindu* . //14//

31

*baindavāsanasaṁrū ḍ hasaṁvartānalacitkalam* / 

*ambikārūpam evedaṁ a ṣ ṭ ārasthaṁ svarāvṛ tam* //14// 

The *cakra* of eight triangles results from the expansion of the *navayoni* , says the D ī . This is why the *navayoni* is said to be present in it as Ambikā, the Mother, the Goddess, who dominates and brings together the three fi rst energy-goddesses, Vāmā, Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and Raudr ī , and who is to be imagined as encircled by the fi fteen “vowels,” from *A* to *bindu* , the sixteenth one, *visarga* , remaining inside. 

The two next *cakras* are made up of ten triangles:

The \[fi rst of the two *cakra* \] of ten triangles is a shining form born from the fl ashing forth of the nine triangles. It causes the luminosity of the ten phonemes, from the one preceding *śakti* 10 to the last of the nine \[ following ones\]. //15// It is the support of the light of the ten subtle and gross elements. The fl ashing form of the second ten-pointed \[ *cakra* is associated with the ten\] phonemes beginning with *krodh ī śa. * //15–16// 

*navatrikoṇasphuritaprabhārūpadaśārakam* / 

*śaktyādinavaparyantadaśārṇasphūrtikārakam* //15// 

*bhūtatanmātradaśakaprakāśālambanatvata ḥ * / 

*dvidaśarasphuradrūpaṁ krodh ī śādidaśārṇakam* //16// 

The nine triangles are the eight of the *navayoni* together with the so-called *baindavāsana* , the throne of \(or the throne that is\) the *bindu* . 

In each of the ten triangles of this *cakra* is a phoneme, beginning with *YA* \(which, in the Sanskrit alphabet, precedes *RA* \) and going up to the last phoneme, *K Ṣ A* . 11 The light \( *prakāśa* \)—the essence, that is—of the ten gross and subtle elements \( *bhūta* and *tanmātra* \) abides also in these ten triangles. The ten phonemes “beginning with *krodh ī śa* ” are the fi ve guttural and the fi ve palatal phonemes, from *KA* to *ÑA* \( *krodh ī śa* 12 being a name for *KA* \); they are associated with the objects of the senses and the organs of action \(speech, etc.\). 

The transformation of the luminescence of the \[fi rst\] four *cakra* s conjoined \[with the *cakra* of ten angles\] results in the fourteen-angled one whose nature is that of sense perception and of the sense organs. \[The next *cakra* \] is made up of the expansion, in the highest sense, of the 

32

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

phonemes from *khecar ī * to *jayā* , its nature being therefore that of the luminescence of Raudr ī fl ashing forth as fi re and energy. //17–18//

*evaṁ śaktyanalākārasphuradraudr ī prabhāmayam* //18// 

The *cakra* of fourteen triangles is associated with sense perception \( *saṁvitti* \) and the fi ve senses of apperception and the fi ve of action, to which are added mind \( *manas* \), “egoity” \( *ahaṁkāra* \), and intellect \( *buddhi* \) 13 , to these—so as to have a total of fourteen—is added a fourth element, which, according to the D ī , is *citta* , the limited empirical consciousness. 

\[Then appear\] the square, a form of Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and the threefold circle, a form of Vāmā. //19a// 

*jye ṣ ṭ hārūpacatu ṣ koṇaṁ vāmārūpabhramitrayam* / 

The square is the outer quadrangular part of the *śr ī cakra* , sometimes called *bhugṛ ha* , the house of the earth, since it is the part of the diagram deemed to be metaphysically on the level of the earth. The “threefold circle” refers to the two eight- and sixteen-petal lotuses with the three circular lines that enfold them. 

Another vision of the nature of the *śr ī cakra* , as associated with the fi vefold cosmic division of the *kalās* , is now propounded: The inner triangle participates in consciousness \( *cit* \). The eight triangles, of *śāntyāt ī ta* \[ *kalā* \]. //19// The two ten-pointed \[ *cakras* \] as well as the fourteen-pointed one are part of *śānti* \[ *kalā* \]. \[The one that\] is surrounded by eight petals is made up of the eff ulgence of the *vidyākalā* . //20// The sixteen-petaled lotus shining clearly is in the body of the *prati ṣ ṭ hā* \[ *kalā* \]. When the aspect of the *nivṛ tti* \[ *kalā* \]

One of the divisions of the cosmos of the Tantric traditions is that of the *kalās* . It is part of an all-embracing cosmic and soteriological conception that divides the ways of apparition and maintenance of the cosmos \(and the ways toward liberation\) into “six paths” \(or ways, *adhvans* \): the *ṣ a ḍ adhvan* . It is a sixfold division into two groups of three notions or entities, all spreading from the deity to our world, to create and animate the cosmos, and manifest ways also to be followed, going upward, toward liberation. 

These *adhvans* are: the way of time \( *kālādhvan* \), which includes the phonemes, the mantras, and the “words,” entities that exist in time, not materially; and the way of space \( *deśādhvan* \), which includes the *kalās* , the *tattvas* , and the *bhuvanas* , which are more concrete elements, existing in space. The *bhuvanas* are the infernal, terrestrial, and divine 

“worlds,” numbering usually 224. The *tattvas* are the thirty-six entities or cosmic levels, from Śiva to the earth. The *kalās* , “portions,” are divisions too complex to be described here. They include *tattvas* and *bhuvanas* in addition to phonemes, mantras, and “words” \( *padas* \). The highest *kalā* is *śāntyāt ī ta* , “transcending *śānti,” * made up of Śiva and Śakti; then comes *śānti* , made up of the next three *tattvas* ; then *vidyā* , made up of the *tattvas* from *puru ṣ a* to *māyā* ; then *prati ṣ ṭ hā* , from *prakṛ ti* to water; and fi nally, *nivṛ tti* , earth. 

The correspondences between the parts of the *śr ī cakra* and the fi ve *kalās* are logical since they both give expression to the same cosmic hierarchy, going from the deity to our world: the creative and animat-ing process of emanation, embodied diagrammatically by the pattern of the *śr ī cakra* , which *is* the Goddess, as creating and embodying the cosmos. 

An opposite movement is shown in *ślokas* 22–24, the parts of the *śr ī cakra* , with their attending deities, being enumerated in the reverse order, from the outer square to the center, according, that is, to the process of resorption \( *saṁhārakrameṇa* \), a process that goes metaphysically from the level of this world to the plane of the supreme deity and is also symbolically present in the *śr ī cakra* . The nine parts are quoted not by their names but by the divine entities or deities abiding in them. These are divided in three groups:

In the nine *cakras* , Trailokyamohana and so forth, O Sureśvar ī \! are found *nāda* , *bindu* , *kalā* , Jye ṣ ṭ hā, Raudr ī then Vāmā, //22// as well

as Vi ṣ agn ī , Dūtar ī , and Sarvānandā, in this order. *Nāda* and *bindu* are undivided, Kāl ī has the nature of will, //23// Jye ṣ ṭ hā is knowledge, the remaining ones being activity. The *cakra* is thus threefold. 

It is a form of *kāmakalā* ; its essential nature is expansion. //24// 

*trailokyamohanādye tu navacakre sureśvari* / 

*nādo bindu ḥ kalā jye ṣ ṭ hā raudr ī vāmā tatha ḥ puna ḥ * //22//

*jye ṣ ṭ hā jñānaṁ kriyā śe ṣ am ity evaṁ tritayātmakam* / 

*cakraṁ kāmakalārūpaṁ prasāraparamārthata ḥ * //24// 

The D ī explains the triplicity of the *śr ī cakra* mentioned in these three stanzas as linked to three forms of energy-goddesses, each being present in a group of three *cakras* . Thus, the peaceful, *śāntā* , which is consciousness \( *cit* \), is indivisibly present in the outer square and in the sixteen-petal lotus, with *nāda* and *bindu. * The eight-petal lotus is made of the energy of will \( *icchā* \). Jye ṣ ṭ hā is the energy of knowledge \( *jñāna* \) and is present in the fourteen-triangle *cakra* . The remaining fi ve *cakras* \(the two ten triangles, *navayoni* , central triangle, and *bindu* \), in which are located the goddesses Raudr ī , Vāmā, Vi ṣ agn ī , Dūtar ī , and Sarvānandā, are pervaded by the energy of activity \( *kriyā* \). The *śr ī cakra* is thus pervaded by the three basic energies of Śiva, their places in it being inverted, since the highest, *śāntā* , is in the outer square and the lowest in the center, an inversion that expresses the omnipresence of the whole energy of Śiva in the whole diagram. 

To say that the *śr ī cakra* is a form of *kāmakalā* is to say that it is a form of the \(sexual\) union—and therefore both embodying and causing the expansion/emanation of the cosmos—of Śiva and Śakti expressed by the *kāmakalā* . 14 

Yet another manner of conceiving and making a yogic and meditative use of the *śr ī cakra* is expounded in the following eleven *ślokas* \(25–35\): In *akula* , in what is called *vi ṣ u* , in energy and in fi re, then in \[the *cakra* of \] the navel, in the *anāhata* , the \[ *vi* \] *ṣ uddha* , the uvula, the forehead, //25// in the moon and the half \[moon\], in *rodhin ī * , *nāda* , *nādānta* , and *śakti* , then in *vyāpikā* and in the domain of *samanā *

and *unmanā* , //26// then in the *mahābindu* , one must meditate in this way the \[ *śri* \] *cakra* in a threefold manner. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

35

Up to the *ājñā * \[ *cakra* , the meditation\] is said to be with parts \( *sakala* \), then up to *unmanā* it is with and without parts \( *sakalani ṣ kala* \). 

On the supreme level, it is without parts \( *ni ṣ kala* \). It is \[therefore\] 

threefold. 

On the forehead \[the *kalā* \] is round, like a lamp; \[the enunciation, 

there, lasts\] a half a mora. 15 //28// *Ardhacandra* \[located above it\] has the same aspect and lasts one fourth of a mora. *Rodhin ī * , appearing like moonlight is triangular in shape; it lasts an eighth of a mora. 

//29// \[ *Nāda* , to be visualized as\] a line between two dots, is shaped like a penis, scintillating like a jewel, lasts a sixteenth of a mora. 

//30// Lasting half as long is *nādānta* fl ashing like lightning, in the shape of a plow, with a *bindu* on its right. Then *śakti* like an upright line above and to the left of two *bindus* . //31// *Vyāpikā * appears when *bindu* , by its play, becomes triangular. *Samāna* , then, is a straight line between two *bindus* . *Unmanā* \[appears\] when the play of *bindu* 

produces a straight line. 16 

The essential body 17 of *śakti* , etc., shines like twelve blazing suns. 

//33// The fractions of mora of the \[enunciation\] from *śakti* onward are 1 / of a *mora* , then two times less, then again half as much for 64

*manonman ī * . Then \[comes\] *unman ī * . //34// 

Higher still, \[there is\] the Supremely Great, transcending the limitations of time or space, of innate beauty, overfl owing with supreme bliss. //35//

The YH prescribes here to meditate, that is, to visualize each of the nine constituent parts of the *ṣ r ī cakra* in each of nine bodily *cakras* \(also called *padma* , lotus\) tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* , from its lowest part to the *mahābindu* , a system of *cakras* proper to this text \(see fi gure 1.3\). 

As the D ī explains, these *cakras* are the following: at the base, at the root of the *su ṣ umnā* , is the *akulapadma* , a red thousand-petal lotus, turned upward, above which is another, eight-petal lotus supporting a third, six-petal lotus. These three elements form what is called *vi ṣ u* , a word that means poison but is taken to come from the Sanskrit root *VIŚ* , to enter or be present, this lotus being deemed to pervade in essence all thirty lotuses tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* . What these thirty lotuses are is not explained by the D ī , but the YH probably refers to secondary subtle centers \( *ādhāra* , *sthāna* , etc.\), which we will meet later. Above these lotuses are the usual seven *cakras* : *mūlādhāra* \(“fi re”\); *svādhisthāna* , considered as the place of *śakti* ; *maṇipūra* ; *anāhata* ; *vi ṣ uddha* ; *lambika* \(on the uvula\); *ājñā* \(or *bhrūmadhya* \), above which the yogin is to meditate on the *bindu* . On the top of the head is another thousand-petal lotus, on the *brahmarandhra* . All this is usual. 

But now the *bhāvanā* takes on a diff erent aspect, since the adept is to 

“meditate” the *kalās* , the subtle phonic “parts” of the *b ī ja HR Ī Ṃ * starting with the *bindu* \(the *anusvāra Ṃ * , that is, which prolongs the *M* of *HR Ī Ṃ * \) and ending with *unmanā* . He is to cause to appear in his mind \( *bhāvayet* \) all these *kalās* , seeing them mentally as described in *ślokas* 27–34. The D ī 

explains that in this meditation, the conventional shapes and colors of the *kalās* , along with the aspect of the deities abiding in the nine bodily centers, are to be visualized.

The adept should do this while giving to each of these mental images the prescribed length of time. These, however, are so infi nitesimal as to be entirely theoretical. We may therefore surmise that they are meant merely to express the extreme subtlety and transcendence of these phonic elements. 

When this supreme *kalā* sees the fl ashing forth of the Self, assuming the aspect of Ambikā, the supreme Word is being uttered. //36// 

*ā* *tmana ḥ sphuraṇaṁ paśyed yadā sā paramā kalā * / 

*ambikārūpam apannā parā vāk samud ī ritā * //36// 

When the supreme Goddess perceives herself as identical with the supreme Śiva—that is, when the supreme godhead, in total plenitude, at once male and female, becomes conscious of this state—she becomes 

38

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Ambikā, the Mother, the origin, in other words, of all that is. She is then also the supreme Word \( *parā vāk* \), which is the basic ground and substrate of the universe, and the absolutely peaceful, Śāntā, energy deity. 

This metaphysical level is to be imagined diagrammatically as in the center of the *śr ī cakra* . 

The creative function of the levels of the Word is then shown as visibly embodied in the geometrical structure of the inner triangle of the *śr ī cakra* : When she turns toward \[creation\] so as to manifest the universe 

which is held \[within her\] as a seed, taking on the form of a hook, 18 

\[she becomes\] Vāmā because she vomits the universe. //37// Then, being the energy of will, this very \[goddess\] embodies herself as the visionary \[word\]. Then, as energy of knowledge, she is Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and the intermediate word is being enunciated. //38// With the conservation of the universe, her form spreads out as a straight line. Then, on the level of resorption, she takes on the form of *bindu* . //39// 

When the reverse process takes place, she fl ashes forth in a body 

\[shaped like\] a *śṛ ṇgā ṭ a* . She is then energy of action. She is Raudr ī , the corporeal \[word\], appearing as the universe. //40//

*kriyāśaktis tu raudr ī yaṁ vaikhar ī viśvavigrahā* //40// 

These four *ślokas* describe the process whereby the Goddess, having perceived herself as the supreme \(divine\) limiting creative power \( *paramakalā* \), manifests the universe through the three stages or levels of the Word \( *vāk* \), starting out from *paravāk* , the supreme Word, which is the eternal, omnipresent, pervasive ground of the whole process. This process, in the metaphysics of nondualist shaivism, brings about the cosmic manifestation as resulting from the Word: the world exists because it has been and is eternally being enunciated, expressed by the supreme deity, which is essentially Word. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

39

There are, based on *parā* , three stages or levels in this process. First is the visionary \( *paśyant ī * \) word, in which there appears in the divine consciousness a vision of what will be manifested—the word and the vision being inextri-cably mixed. Then comes the plane of *madhyamā* , the intermediate word, in which there appears a diff erentiation between elements of word or speech and in which the lineaments of the objective world appear but still ideally. 

There is a third and lower plane of the word, that of *vaikhar ī * , the “corporeal,” 19 in which words and objects appear manifested and separately. 20 

But in the present case, what appears after the intermediate word is not the next stage of manifestation but the opposite movement: toward resorption, with the *bindu* , the dot in the center of the central triangle. This is because the whole process takes place within the deity and because creation and destruction are always present together in the supreme godhead. 

This process, which unfolds on the highest divine plane, is thus described as resulting from the Goddess assuming the aspect of four goddesses and of four energies. First is Ambikā, the Mother of creation, together with the highest peaceful \( *śāntā* \) goddess form of energy, on the plane of *parā vāk. * Then comes *vāmā* , “because she vomits the universe” 

\( *viśvasya vāmanāt* \), projects it outside, that is, together with the energy of will \( *icchā* \). She also visualizes ideally the universe in herself, the level of the word being *paśyant ī * . After this comes the goddess Jye ṣ ṭ hā, together with the power of knowledge \( *jñānaśakti* \), since she takes cog-nizance of her creation on this plane. It is the level of *madhyamā vāk* . 

Since the creative movement stops here and a reverse, resorption movement appears, the Goddess takes on now the form of the fearsome Raudr ī , deemed to arise together with the divine power of action \( *kriyāśakti* \), described as abiding in the central *bindu* wherein all powers are united and concentrated. The central triangle is thus complete, its three sides being made by the forms taken on by Ambikā, Vāmā, and Jye ṣ ṭ hā, with Raudr ī on *bindu* in the center. 

What the adept is to realize here is the fi rst creative movement of the supreme Goddess manifesting the inner triangle of the *śr ī cakra* together with the four basic forms of energy and four forms of herself as four energy-goddesses, while retaining all this within herself: hence the fourth goddess, Raudr ī , and the return to the *bindu* . 

In or around this central triangle, other entities are now to appear: While manifesting 21 everything that exists in essence then exter-

nally, these four energies \[produce\] KA PŪ JĀ O, in that order. //41//

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

These *p ī ṭ hās* are located respectively in the bulb, the word, the form, and beyond all form. Their forms are respectively those of a square, a circle with six *bindus* , a half-moon, and a triangle. They are known as being yellow, smoke-gray, white, and red. //42–43// 

*bhāsanād viśvarūpasya svarūpe bāhyato ‘pi ca* /

*p ī to dhumras tathā śveto rakto rūpam ca k ī rtitam* //43// 

The four basic energies, from *śāntā * to *kriyā* , present in the central triangle around the Goddess are now said to bring about the apparition of more concrete cosmic elements, the *p ī ṭ has* , which are the four main seats or centers of presence and power of the Goddess. They are quoted by the initials of their names, which are Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and O ḍ ḍ iyāna, four places ensuring “geographically” the concrete presence of the Goddess in the Indian subcontinent. 22 A characteristic of Tantric sacred geography is that it is mentally and bodily interiorized, so the *p ī ṭ has* are also to be visualized by the adept on four points of his yogic imaginary body. The bulb \( *kanda* in Sanskrit\) is a bulge in the lower part of the *su ṣ umnā * usually considered as the center from which issue and radiate in the body the 72,000 *nā ḍ ī s* , the channels in which the *prāṇa* circulates. It is also assimilated to the lower yogic center, the *mūlādhāra* . 

The three terms “word” \( *pada* \), “form” \( *rūpa* \), and “beyond the form” 

\( *rūpāt ī ta* \)—together, usually, with *piṇḍ a* rather than *kaṇḍ a* —are the names of four centers of the yogic body. According to the D ī , “word” refers to the *haṁsa* , which we may understand here as the inner breath in the heart. The 

“form” \( *rūpa* \) would be the *bindu* , on the forehead, on the so-called *ājñā *

center. “Beyond the form” \( *rūpāt ī ta* \) refers to the *brahmarandhra* . The *p ī ṭ has* appear thus as tiered along the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , where they are to be visualized as colored geometrical shapes, which are, in fact, those of the *maṇḍ alas* of four elements, the *tattvas* of earth, water, fi re, and air. Their being associated with *cakras* of the yogic body, from the base to the summit of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , corre-lates cosmic and human levels. This practice \(since the *p ī ṭ has* are to be visualized and “interiorized”\) is thus at once mental-spiritual, diagrammatic-visual, bodily \(in the yogic sense\), and cosmic, the description of this part of the 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

41

*śr ī cakra* being at the same time the prescription of a yogic practice. This is one more instance of the tantric association of ritual and yoga. 

Now *li ṅ gas* are described as present in the same places: The self-existing *li ṅ ga* , the *bāṇali ṅ ga* and the *itara* , then the supreme 

\[one\], O Dear One, are present in the *p ī ṭ has* . //44// 



They shine like gold, \[like\] the bandhūka fl ower, the autumn 

moon. The great *svayambhuli ṅ ga* is surrounded by the vowels and is three-pronged. //45// The *bāṇali ṅ ga* , triangular, is encircled by the phonemes from *KA* to *TA* . \[The *itara* \] is shaped like the round fl ower of the Kadamba and is encircled by the letters from *THA* to *SA* . //46// The supreme *li ṅ ga* is subtle; it is enclosed by all the phonemes. It is the *bindu* , root of supreme bliss, arising from the eternal plane. //47// 

*svayambhūr bāṇali ṅ gaṁ ca itaraṁ ca paraṁ puna ḥ * / 

*p ī ṭ he ṣ vetāni li ṅ gāni saṁsthitāni varānane* //44//

*kadambagolakākāraṁ thādisāntāk ṣ arāvṛ tam* //46// 

*sūk ṣ marūpaṁ samastārṇavṛ taṁ paramali ṅ gakam* / 

*bindurūpaṁ parānandakandaṁ nityapadoditam* //47// 

The *sādhaka* is to imagine these *li ṅ gas* as being on the same places as the *p ī ṭ has* : three on the three angles of the inner triangle, the fourth on the *bindu* in the center. Since *li ṅ gas* are icons of Śiva, we may assume that to conceive them as placed on the *p ī ṭ has* , the seats of the Goddess, is to mark symbolically the co-presence \(the *saṁketa* \), the union, of these two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity. 23 

A *li ṅ ga* is an icon of Śiva of any aspect, shape, or material, not necessarily the more or less visibly phallic image one usually means when using the term. 24 *Li ṅ gas* are classifi ed in Tantras or in iconography manuals under diff erent names and categories, notably that of “special” \( *śi ṣ ṭ a* \) *li ṅ gas* , which is the case of those mentioned here, where their shape and color are specifi ed for the adept to visualize them. 

The self-existing \( *svayambhu* \) *li ṅ ga* is normally any sort of natural object that has been declared to be a visible icon of Śiva. In the present 

42

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

case, it is described as three-pronged \(that is, says the D ī , having three *bindus* on its summit\) and golden in color. *Bāṇalingas* , as a rule, consist mostly of quartz and are egg-shaped pebbles. Here it is triangular and red. The *itaralingas* , as their names indicate \( *itara* means “other”\), are normally all other sorts of *li ṅ gas* . Here it is said to be round like a ball and white. The *parali ṅ ga* is colorless, invisible, since it is above the fi eld of the senses. It is, says the D ī , “the root made of bliss of the liana extending from *A* to *K Ṣ A* whose boughs are the \[levels of the Word\] *paśyant ī * , 25 etc., and whose imperishable root is the supreme \( *parā* \) word. It ‘arises from the eternal plane’ because the *mātṛ kā* is eternal. This *li ṅ ga* arises as the primordial vibration \( *prathamaspanda* \) 26 from the eternal plane which is to be reached by all those who wish to be liberated from the fetters of this world.” 

Here, too, the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are present but in their subtle form, as the *mātṛ kā* , the “mother” of the phonemes, not as utterable phonic elements. The vowels are associated with the *svayambhuli ṅ ga* since they are of a higher nature than the consonants, associated with the *bāṇa* and *itara li ṅ gas* , whereas the whole alphabet, the totality of the power of the Word, is associated with the supreme *li ṅ ga* . 

Such are the *kula* and *kaula* entities expressed by the whole mantra taken as a whole with its three *b ī jas* . //48// 

Such \[too\] are the states called waking, dream, deep sleep, and fourth, as well as the one beyond, supreme splendor \[wherein\] 

appears the consciousness of the Self. //49// 

*b ī jatritayayuktasya sakalasya mano ḥ puna ḥ * / 

*etāni vācyarūpāṇi kulakaulamayāni tu* //48// 

*jāgratsvapnasu ṣ uptākhyaturyarūpāṇy amūni tu* / 

*at ī taṁ tu paraṁ tejas svasaṁvidudayātmakam* //49// 

Having associated the four *li ṅ gas* with the *mātṛ kā* and with the levels of *parā, paśyant ī * , and so on, that is, with the total power of the Word, the YH now considers these entities to be expressed or predicated \( *vācya* \), that is, brought to existence by—or to have their essence in—the three parts, here called *b ī jas* , of the *śr ī vidyā* and \(for the supreme *li ṅ ga* \) by or in the *ṣ r ī vidyā * taken in its totality. The term *kula* is understood by the D ī as referring to the three human and cosmic divisions: knower, object of knowledge, and knowledge—or subject, objectivity and cognition; or measurer, 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

43

measurable, and criteria of measurement—\( *pramātṛ -prameya-pramāṇa* , which we have already seen above, *śl* . 12–13\), taken separately, *kaula* referring to these three elements taken together. 27 

Then \( *śl. * 49\) another, human group of four elements is added as present in the center of the *śr ī cakra* : the four *avasthas* , which are states or modalities of consciousness going from the ordinary waking consciousness \( *jāgrat* \) to a fourth \( *turya/tur ī ya* \) subtle one, these four being sub-sumed and dominated by a fi fth “above the fourth” \( *turyāt ī ta* \) transcendent state, identical with the supreme uncreated divine Consciousness. 28 

What comes forth appearing as a self-willed visible layout of everything in the shape of the universe is Consciousness, a form of the Self, beauty of uncreated bliss. //50// 

*svecchāvi ṣ mayollekhakhacitaṁ viśvarūpakam* / 

*caitanyam ātmano rūpaṁ nisargānandasundaram* //50// 

Having shown the goddesses or energies present in or around the central triangle as issuing from the absolute while having it as their essence and substrate, the YH now comes back to the cosmic aspect of the *śr ī cakra* : by drawing it out by an act of her own will \( *svecchā* \) as a visible layout of everything that exists \( *viśvamayollekhakhacita* \) consisting in the universe \( *viśvarūpaka* \), the Goddess manifests the universe as the *śr ī cakra* , entirely pervaded by her power. The D ī quotes here K ṣ emarāja’s *Pratyabhijñāhṛ daya* , 29 2: “By the power of her own will she unfolds the universe on her own screen” \( *svabhittau* \), that is, on herself as the essence and substrate of all. The D ī also quotes a well-known formula:: “The Lord Śiva gladdens having seen the infi nite diversity of the world which he has drawn out with the brush of his own will.” Another quote: “the supreme energy inseparable from Śiva has as her body the whole cosmic process.” 

That the diagrammatic and the cosmic processes are one and the same is again stated, as follows:

When the measurable, the measurer, and the criteria of measure 

spread out, the brightness contracts, being will, knowledge, and activity. \[Consciousness then\] takes on a triangular 30 form. //51// 

*meyamātṛ pramāṇamānaprasarai ḥ saṁkucatprabham* / 

*śṛ ṇgā ṭ arūpam āpannam icchājñānakriyātmakam* //51// 

44

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

What appears now in the supreme Consciousness is the condition of the knower \( *pramātṛ *\), the empirical subject \(the measurer\), and what the subject can know \(the objects, which are measurable, *meya* \), knowledge \( *pramā* \), and its criteria \( *pramāṇa* \). This development implies a “contraction” \( *saṁkoca* \) of Consciousness since it evolves from an absolute fullness and undiff erentiation to the diff erentiated, discursive thought \( *vikalpa* \) of the empirical, individual subject, an evolution whose dimension here is cosmic: the divine energy takes on the form of the universe without, however, losing her divine, absolute, luminous nature. This is expressed by saying that she acts as the three fundamental divine powers of will, cognition, and activity \( *icchā, jñāna* , and *kriyā* \). These being three, she becomes threefold, a condition expressed in the YH by saying that she assumes the shape of a water chestnut \( *śṛ ṅ gā ṭ a* \). 

The YH now says \( *śl* . 52–55\) how the adept is to conceive meditatively—

by *bhāvanā* —and visualize the supreme deity as abiding in the *śr ī cakra* :

\[One must see the energy of consciousness as\] the resting place of the very nature of Śiva as the sustaining power of the expansion of the forms of the universe, supremely beautiful, resting as on a couch against the hip of Kāmeśvara. //52// Shining, she holds the noose made of the energy of will, the hook which is \[energy of \] 

knowledge, the bow and the arrows made of energy of action. //53// 

Split into support and supported, divided into eight, bearer of weapons, arising from the *cakra* with eight points, she has the ninefold *cakra* as a throne. //54// 

*viśvākāraprathādhāranijarūpaśivāśrayam* / 

*kāmeśvarā ṅ kaparya ṅ kanivi ṣ ṭ am atisundaram* //52//

*āśrayāśrayibhedena a ṣ ṭ adhā binnahetimat* / 

*a ṣ ṭ āracakrasaṁrū ḍ haṁ navacakrāsanasthitam* //54// 

The supreme energy of the godhead, supreme consciousness, is now to be conceived as the metaphysical resting place of Śiva, who supports the expansion of the cosmos. She is also to be visualized as the goddess Kāmeśvar ī resting on the lap of the god Kāmeśvara: 31 a division in two of the absolute oneness of the supreme which will bring about the multiplicity 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

45

of the expansion \(through the thirty-six *tattvas* \) of the cosmos. This divine pair is described as each bearing the four symbolical “weapons” \( *āyudha* , here called *heti* \) of Tripurasundar ī , each identifi ed with one of the four 32 

basic energies of Śiva, and is therefore said to be divided into eight. 

Although arising from the *bindu* , in the center of the inner triangle, this pair, which is somehow the Goddess herself, stretches out in the whole *śr ī cakra* , which is ninefold, and is thus her throne. 

This is the form in which the supreme splendor abides embodied 33 

as the 

*śr ī cakra* 

, surrounded by the sparkling waves of her 

multitudinous energies. //55// 

*evaṁrūpaṁ paraṁ teja ḥ śr ī cakravapu ṣ ā sthitam* / 

*tad ī yaśaktinikarasphuradūrmisamāvṛ tam* //55// 

The supreme splendor is the supreme godhead, Tripurasundar ī , in her cosmic aspect as the *śr ī cakra* , with all the deities that animate it surrounding her. The image is that of a central throbbing core of light and power surrounded, as by the waves of the sea, by the energies emanating from this center. 

More technically, but interestingly, the D ī explains as follows this fl ow of the divine energies as linked to, or embodied as, the *śr ī cakra:* “When Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvar ī , who are pure light and refl ective awareness \[ *prakāśavimarśamaya* \] 34 assume by their own free will the forms of the constitutive parts of the *śr ī cakra* , then the energies which constitute these parts surround them in the form of the *āvaraṇadevatās* Kāmeśvar ī , Vajreśvar ī , Bhagamālin ī \(etc.\).” 

As for the word “wave” \( *ūrmi* \), it is explained as follows: “the supreme Lord, who is light \[ *prakāśa* \] is the sea, Kāmeśvari, which is awareness \[ *vimarśa* \] 

is the water, the waves being the numberless energies into which they divide themselves. As the waves appear and subside in the sea, so the *cakra* made of the thirty-six *tattvas* , with its energies, appears and disappears there.” 

Having visualized in this way the *śr ī cakra* in its dynamic cosmic aspect, the adept is now to visualize and experience bodily and mentally, while displaying them, nine divinized powers, the *mudrās* , which are deemed to reside in the *cakra* \( *śl* . 56–71\):

When Consciousness becomes luminously aware of the universe 

\[appearing\] on the screen of her Self, fi lled with the desire for 

46

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

action, she \[produces it\] by her own free will. //56// \[She is then\] 

energy of activity, called *mudrā* because she gladdens the universe and makes it fl ow. 

*cidātmabhittau viśvasya prakāśāmarśane yadā * / 

*karoti svecchayā pūrṇavicik ī r ṣ āsamanvitā * //56// 

*kriyaśaktis tu viśvasya modanād drāvaṇāt tathā * / 

*mudrākhyā* 

The awareness that the Goddess, supreme consciousness, has of the universe born from her is said to be luminous since the cosmic manifestation has just been described as an ocean of light. In nondualist Tantric Śaiva traditions, the apparition of the cosmos is viewed as a real transformation of the deity into the universe: she is “made of everything \[that exists\]” \( *viśvamaya* \). The world, therefore, is not purely illusory. 35 The creation is also viewed as an image the godhead projects as with a ray of light on herself, as on a screen, which is to say that she is not only the origin but also the substrate of the world. Since the world is being manifested, the energy acting in this case is the energy of activity \( *kriyāśakti* \). 

The interpretation of the term *mudrā* as gladdening \( *modana* , from the verbal root *MUD* , therefore *mu* \) and causing to fl ow \( *dravayati* , from the root *DRU* , to fl ow or dissolve, therefore *drā* \) is traditional. 36 The term can thus be taken as denoting the blissful fl ow of the universe, diff erent aspects of which will be shown as appearing in diff erent parts of the *śr ī cakra* \(which is a cosmic diagram\), as a result of the action of such secondary deities as the Mudrās, who embody diff erent aspects or stages of the cosmic activity of the Goddess. They are described in the YH as energy-goddesses, not as hand gestures, the usual meaning of *mudrā* . 

Only in the D ī \(and in Bhāskarāya’s commentary\) are they shown as gestures \(and as deities or energies\). These hand gestures are to be displayed by the adept, who will thus not only evoke the *mudrās* as deities but also, through this physical action, experiment in mind and body the cosmic activity of the Goddess as she manifests the cosmos, or, in this case, reabsorbs it, a process parallel to that of the quest for liberation. 

When this consciousness, Ambikā, made of three *kalās* , //57// 

becomes divided into three, she causes the continuous presence 

\[of the Goddess in the *śr ī cakra. * \]. She is celebrated as pervading the whole *cakra* . //58// 

*sā yadā saṁvidambikā trikalāmay ī * //57// 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

47

*trikhaṇḍ ārūpam āpannā saṁnidhikāriṇī * / 

*sarvasya cakrarājasya vyāpikā parik ī rtitā * //58// 

Consciousness \( *saṁvit* \) is said to be made of three *kalās* , since *kalā* s are limiting forms of power \(see above, *śl. * 21, and n. 10\). The term denotes the three energy-goddesses Vāmā, Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and Raudr ī , who, taken together, are Ambikā, the Mother of all powers, the Goddess, who, 

“becoming divided into three,” is present as these three goddesses in the whole *śr ī cakra* but also as the *mudrās* . As such, she “causes her continuous presence” \( *saṁnidhi* \) in it, since, in Hindu ritual, a deity is to be actually, continuously, and favorably present in the icon when it is to be worshipped. 

*Saṁnidhi* , or *saṁnidhāna* , is the third of a series of four ritual actions to be performed at the beginning of all worship to ensure this divine pres-

ence. 37 The Goddess is, of course, always present in and as the *śr ī cakra* . 

The *saṁnidhi* here is to ensure her presence as *mudrās* who symbolize nine diff erent aspects of her cosmic activity. 



This same \[consciousness as Trikhan 

 ḍ ā 

*mudrā* 

\], when \[in her, 

the aspect of \] 

*yoni* 

increases, \[becomes\] the universal agitator 

\[Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhin ī \] who abides in the *cakra* of the doors and in whom the energy Vāmā dominates. //59// 

*yoniprācyuryata ḥ sai ṣ ā sarvasaṁk ṣ obhiṇī puna ḥ * / 

*vāmāśaktipradhāneyaṁ dvāracakre sthitā bhavet* //59// 

The Mudrās, 38 as divine aspects of the cosmic activity of the Goddess, are now enumerated, going from the outer square section of the *śr ī cakra* to its center. The fi rst aspect of this activity to be considered is that of creation, in the outer square \( *bhūg ṛ ha* , house of the earth\), which corresponds, in the cosmic symbolism of the *śr ī cakra* , to the plane of the manifested world. The *mudrā* Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhin ī , the universal agitator, disturbs the cosmos, that is, embodies the action of the Goddess as actively present in this world, not purely quiescent and transcendent. 

In Śaiva nondualist systems, the term *k ṣ obha* , which, like *saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* , has sexual connotations, implies creation. As the D 

ī says, 

*sṛ ṣ tir *

*eva k *

*ṣ obha ḥ * 

, “agitation is indeed creation” \(or “creation is indeed 

agitation”\). 39 

The quadrangular external part of the *śr ī cakra* is called *cakra* of the doors \( 

*dvāracakra* 

\), because each of its four sides includes a portion

technically called a door \( *dvāra* \), by which the offi

ciating adept can enter or 

leave 40 the diagram. Being considered on the level of the empirical world, 

of *māyā* , this *cakra* is fi ttingly called Trailokyamohana \(“delusion of the three worlds”\), since the Goddess deludes, enchants, the world by upholding its deceiving nature through her *māyā* . 

The goddess Vāmā is so called, it is said, because she “vomits” \( *vamati* \), that is, brings out, manifests, the world. 

The YH mentions only the metaphysical aspect of the *mudrās* , their role as divine energies. They are, however, also hand gestures, to be displayed by the adept. This is explained in the D ī for each of the ten *mudrās* . 

These explanations are interesting, but translating these passages would take too much space here. Sketches of these hand poses, made by a *paṇḍ it* of the French Institute of Indology in Pondicherry, are given in fi gures 1.4 

and 1.5. 

When Jye ṣ ṭ hā predominates, she ensures the conservation of the universe 

\[which had been\] agitated. As the *kalās* of the gross aspect of the phonic subtle vibration, she bestows grace to all. //60// This 

selfsame Mudrā whose form fl ashes forth is in the *cakra* called Sarvāśapūraṇa. 

*k ṣ ubdhavi ṣ vasthitikar ī jye ṣ ṭ hāprācuryam āśritā * / 

*sthūlanādakalārūpā sarvānugrahakāriṇī * //60// 

*sarvāśāpūraṇākhye tu sai ṣ ā sphuritavigrahā * / 

After the creative agitation caused by Vāmā, the energy-goddess Jye ṣ ṭ hā 

now causes the preservation \( *sthiti* \) of the universe. This action is considered to take place \(diagrammatically\) on the level of the sixteen-petal lotus called Sarvāśapūraṇa \(“fulfi llment of all wishes”\). The *kalās* mentioned here are the sixteen “vowels,” from *A* to *visarga* , in their gross, that is, 

audible, form. 41 

According to the D ī , these *kalās* are also sixteen “attracting” divine energies, Kāmākar ṣ in ī and so on, which are to be worshipped in this *cakra* during the *pūjā* . 42 

The D ī gives the name of this Mudrā: Sarvavidrāviṇī \(“causing everything to fl ow”\) and, naturally, describes the corresponding hand gesture. 

“Because its nature is conservation,” it says, “it consists in raising the 

50

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

joined middle and index fi ngers and joining the ring and little fi ngers. Its nature being to attract desires, it causes fullness of divine grace.” 

When Jye ṣ ṭ hā and Vāmā are in equilibrium, creation predominates. 

//61// This Ākar ṣ iṇī *mudrā* is known as the agitator of the universe. 

*jye ṣ ṭ hāvāmāsamatvena ṣ ṛ ṣ ṭ e ḥ prādhānyam āśritā * //61// 

*ākar ṣ iṇī tu mudreyaṁ sarvasaṁk ṣ obhiṇī smṛ tā * / 

The role of this *mudrā* does not seem to diff er greatly from that of the preceding one, whose action it seems merely to confi rm. Interestingly, the D ī says that if this *mudrā* is attracting \( *ākar ṣ iṇī * \), it is “because of the curved position \(like a hook\) of the two index fi ngers”; the gesture is given as explaining a metaphysical element. This is one more case of the total interpenetration of the theoretical and the bodily, characteristic of the *mudrās* . 

This *mudrā* 

is localized in the lotus of eight petals called 

Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhanacakra, the *cakra*  of universal agitation. 43 

\[The *mudrā* \] who holds herself in the interval between two *vyomans* , O Maheśvar ī \! //62// is known as causing the absorption into the deity resulting from the conjunction of Śiva and Śakti. It is an embodiment of the bliss of consciousness, located in the *cakra* of fourteen triangles. //63// 

*vyomadvayāntarālasthabindurūpā maheśvari* //62// 

*śivāśaktyākhyasaṁśle ṣ ād divyāveśakar ī smṛ tā * / 

*caturdaśāracakrasthā saṁvidānandavigrahā * //63// 

The term *vyoman* , which means sky, space, or ether, refers here to secondary centers of the yogic body sometimes also called *śūnya* , void. They are described as numbering fi ve, tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* , where they are located between the bodily *cakras* , from *mūlādhāra* to *ājñā* . The D ī adds that between these elements there are also fi ve other secondary centers, 44 

*bindus* , to be identifi ed with the gross elements \(the *mahābhūtas* \). 

The absorption \( *āveśa* \) in the union of Śiva and Śakti embodied in this *mudrā* , called Sarvāveśakar ī , is displayed in the corresponding hand gesture, which consists in a joining of the hands, the fi ngers being inter-locked. It embodies the bliss of consciousness \( *saṁvidānanda* \), since the fusion \( *saṁśleśa* \) of Śiva and Śakti is intensely blissful. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

51

The *cakra* of fourteen triangles where this *mudrā* is to be contemplated is called Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka \(“giver of total happiness”\). 

When she fl ashes forth between the *bindus* as a subtle fl ame, the energy Jye 

ṣ ṭ hā predominating, she intoxicates all beings. She 

remains, staying in the \[external\] *cakra* of ten triangles, O Praised by the heroes\! //64–65a// 

*bindvantarālavilasatsūk ṣ marūpaśikhāmay ī * / 

*jye ṣ ṭ hāśaktipradhānā tu sarvonmādanakāriṇī * //64// 

*daśāracakrāsthāyā saṁsthitā v ī ravandite* / 

This *mudrā* , looking like a fl ashing fl ame, extends, according to the D ī , from a *yonibindu* placed in the *mūlādhāra* to a *mahābindu* , on the level of the *brahmarandhra* , therefore along the *su ṣ umnā* , which means that the experience of the adept is one of *kuṇḍ alin ī yoga* , not a merely mental, visual one. What with the visual evocation of the *mudrā* in the yogic body as part of a practice of *kuṇḍ alin ī * yoga, conjoined with the display of the corresponding hand gesture, this practice appears as a particularly complex mental-bodily experience. 

The *mudrā* ’s name is Sarvonmadin ī \(“totally intoxicating”\). The *cakra* of ten triangles is called Sarvārthasādhaka \(“accomplisher of all \[human\] 

aims”\). 

Then the energy Vāmā predominating \[again\], she becomes the 

Great Hook. //65// Thus, vomiting the universe, she abides in 

the second \[ *cakra* \] of ten triangles, being full of joy, remaining in the form of *mudrā* . //66// 

*vāmaśaktipradhānā tu mahā ṅ kuśamay ī puna ḥ * //65// 

*tadvad viśvaṁ vamant ī sā dvit ī ye daśārake* / 

*saṁsthitā modanaparā mudrārūpam āsthitā * //66// 

The energy *-* goddess Vāmā is considered to permeate the second *cakra* of ten triangles, named Sarvarak ṣ ākāra \(“bringing protection to all”\). As we saw previously \( *śl* . 37\), Vāmā \(the word means also left, crooked, oblique\) was associated with the left, oblique side of the inner triangle. Now she is similarly associated with the hook *mudrā* , her joy being the bliss of fusion with the supreme godhead. An *a ṅ kuśa* is a hook or goad of an elephant driver. It is one of the attributes \( *āyudha* , 45 “arms”\) held by Tripurasundar ī . 

52

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Born from the unifying interaction of *dharma* and *adharma* in the form of intelligence, she destroys the faults of omission in ritual action resulting from diff erentiated thought. //67// \[This *mudrā* ,\] 

the supreme *khecar ī * , destroyer of the diseases born from diff erentiated thought, abides, made of consciousness, in the Sarvarogahāra *cakra* . //68// 

*dharmādharmasya saṁgha ṭ ṭ ād utthitā vittirūpiṇi* / 

*vikalpotthakriyāloparūpado ṣ avighātin ī * //67// 

*vikalparūparoganāṇāṁ hāriṇī khecar ī parā* / 

*sarvarogaharākhye tu cakre saṁvinmay ī sthitā* //68// 

*Dharma* here means Śiva, and *adharma* is Śakti. That the *khecar ī mudrā *



should be born from their conjunction, 

*saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* 

\(their total fusion, 

*sāmarasya* , says the D ī \), is not surprising, since this *mudrā* has a very high position in many *kula* traditions. It is the main *mudrā * described in the *Tantrāloka* \( chapter 32\), where it is described as a complex bodily-mental attitude deemed to bring about the presence of the deity and unite the adept with it. In the *Parātr ī śikā* , a basic Trika work, the highest spiritual state the adept can reach is *khecaratā* , the state of being *khecara* , of moving \( *cara* \) in the void of consciousness \(  *khe* 46 \), a state described as the state of Śiva \( *śivāvasthā* \). In such a state, all forms of discursive, diff erentiated thought evidently disappear. 

Then, in the sky \[of consciousness\], in the fl ashing forth of the embrace of Śiva and Śakti, making the universe which is there in a subtle form to shine forth perpetually, //69// she holds herself in the Sarvasiddhimaya \[ *cakra* \] as the Great Mudrā whose nature is seed. 

Then, in this place where one enjoys the fullness of light, //70// this Yonimudrā which is the power to act, stays in the Sarvānandamaya 

\[ *cakra* \]. 

*śivaśaktisamāśle ṣ asphuradvyomāntare puna ḥ * / 

*prakāśayant ī viśvaṁ sā sūk ṣ marūpasthitaṁ sadā * //69//

*saṁpūrṇasya prakāśasya lābhabhūmir iyaṁ puna ḥ * //70// 

*yonimudrā kalārūpā sarvānandamaye sthitā* / 

The luminous state of identifi cation with the union of Śiva and Śakti having been reached while displaying the *khecar ī mudrā* , the adept, enjoying the bliss of the full luminousness of the divine consciousness, displays 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

53

the last *yonimudrā* , which evokes by hand gesture the *yoni* of the Goddess and also the Goddess as *yoni* , source or seed \( *b ī ja* \) of the universe. The D ī 

says that this *mudrā* embodies the dynamic power of the conscious awareness \( *vimarśakalā* \) of the supreme deity: the deity, in Tantra, is never static but is dynamic: bliss, absolute total consciousness, but also life, power, as is underlined in the next half-stanza. 

The *yoni* being always symbolized by a triangle, this *mudrā* abides therefore in the central triangle of the *śr ī cakra* . 

The YH concludes:

This is how the \[energy of \] activity, whose nature is consciousness, abides in the \[ *śr ī * \] *cakra* . //71// 

*kriyā caitanyarūpatvād evaṁ cakramayaṁ sthitam* //71// 

This half-stanza is commented on as follows by the D ī : “As has been said before \( *śl. * 57\), the power of activity is named *mudrā* because she gladdens the universe and makes it fl ow.” 

It is therefore only the energy of activity that, dividing herself, beauti-fi es and diversifi es herself by the division and the \(successive\) predominance of the energy-goddesses Vāmā and so on, and assuming the forms of the various *mudrās* , from Saṁk ṣ obhin ī to Yoni, her nature being that of a consciousness \( *caitanya* \) that becomes the *cakra* , that is to say, that assumes the aspects of the ninefold 

*cakra* 

, from Trailokyamohana to 

Sarvānandamaya. To avoid, however, that one should believe that only the power of activity acts in the *śr ī cakra* , the YH adds: The awakened must always meditate intensely on the supreme 

splendor which is will. //72a// 

*icchārūpaṁ paraṁ teja ḥ sarvadā bhāvayed budha ḥ * / 

The adept must never forget that it is the supreme deity, the united Śiva and Śakti, that acts through the energies of which *kriyāśakti, * that of activity, is the lowest. The YH reminds us, therefore, that the deity acts through her own free will, *svecchayā* . This the devotee must meditate in his heart, perceiving it directly, being however helped by his spiritual master, his guru \(who for him is Śiva\), and whose compassionate glance falls on him. This is called in Sanskrit *gurukatāk ṣ apāta* , the descent of the glance \(bearer of the power of Śiva\) of the guru, who thus transmits the divine saving energy of the deity, sometimes called *śaktipāta* . 

54

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Two other forms of “encounter” \( *saṁketa* \) with the *śr ī cakra* —diff erent visions and practices of it, that is—are now described:

Now \[here\] are the threefold and the ninefold encounter of the 

*cakra* . //72b// 

*tridhā ca navadhā ca cakrasaṁketaka ḥ puna ḥ * //72// 

First the threefold division:

The fi rst \[section of the *cakra* is to be imagined as being produced\] 

by one fi re and two energies, the \[second\] one by three fi res and the triad of energies, //73// and the \[last\] as made up of two lotuses and the triple *bhūgṛ ha* . Five energies, four fi res, two lotuses, and the triple earths //74// \[constitute thus\] the great *cakra* in its complete fullness. 

This aspect \[of the *cakra* \] is explained \[thus\]: the fi rst \[portion\] is that of the *navayoni* . To this are added the two \[ *cakras* of\] ten triangles, //75// 

then the fourteen *yoni* and, immediately after, the third \[portion made up of eight and sixteen petals, followed by the triple square.\] //76// 

\[Thus\], O Parameśvar ī , is described the threefold \[aspect of \] the *cakra* . The emanation, then, //77// goes from the *navayoni* to the earth and the resorption from the earth to the *navayoni* . Such is the teaching of the treatises. 

*vahninaikena śaktibhyāṁ dvābhyāṁ caiko ‘para ḥ puna ḥ * / 

*taiś ca vahnitrayenāpi śaktināṁ tritayeṇa ca* //73// 

*padmadvayena cānya ḥ syād bhūgṛ hatritayena ca* / 

*pañcaśakti caturvahnipadmadvayamah ī trayam* //74// 

*paripūrṇaṁ mahācakram tatprakāra ḥ pradarśyate* / 

*tatrādyaṁ navayoni syāt tena dvidaśasaṁyutam* //75// 

*manuyoni paraṁ vidyāt tṛ t ī yaṁ tadanantaram* / 

*a ṣ ṭ advya ṣ ṭ adalopetaṁ caturasratrayānvitam* //76// 

*cakrasya triprakāratvaṁ kathitaṁ parameśvari* / 

*sṛ ṣ ṭ i ḥ syān navayonādipṛ thivyantaṁ saṁhṛ ti ḥ puna ḥ * //77// 

*pṛ thivyādinavayonyantam iti śāstrasya nirṇaya ḥ * / 

The *śr ī cakra* is here conceived as made up of three portions. The fi rst one results from the interaction of one triangle apex upward \(the “fi re”\) 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

55

and two triangles apex downward \(the “energies”\), this constituting the eight-angle fi gure of the *navayoni* . The next portion is seen as adding to the preceding one two series of three triangles, one male \(“fi re”\), the other female \(“energies”\), which results in the two ten-triangle *cakras* and the fourteen-triangle one. The third portion is made up of the threefold circle and the square outer portion enclosed by three lines. 

The reason the *sr ī cakra* is to be conceived and meditated upon as made up of three section is—as the D ī explains—that each of these three threefold portions has a particular aspect \( *prakāra* \). In the central section, resorption \( *saṁhāra* \) predominates, and in the middle one, conservation \( *stithi* \) predominates, while manifestation \( *sṛ ṣ ṭ i* \) predominates in the outer portion. In addition, in each of these three *cakras* , *saṁhāra* , *sthiti* , and *sṛ ṣ ṭ i* are respectively considered as predominating. Thus, the dynamism of the *śr ī cakra* taken as a whole is that of emanation when going from its center to its outward portion, that of resorption when going from the outer portion to the center. 

But since resorption, conservation, and emanation are all present in each of the three sections, the whole *śr ī cakra* is, at the same time, entirely permeated by these three aspects of the cosmic activity of the Goddess, who is thus eternally and everywhere at once the creator, the maintainer, and the destroyer of the universe, a fact expressed by this three-times-threefold structure of her *cakra* . As the diagrammatic form of the Goddess, the *śr ī cakra* thus symbolizes and expresses her ever living, throbbing, creative, and destructive power. To meditate and realize this mystically, as is here prescribed, is to realize and to fuse with this divine dynamic plenitude. Hence the usefulness of the *śr ī cakra* , whose nine sections are now again enumerated and then named:

\[Now\], O Parameśvar ī , is told in its entirety the *cakra* of Tripurā //78// 

through whose knowledge alone one becomes a knower of Tripurā.

\[this\] triangle. //80–82a//

The constituent *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* are enumerated going from its outer portion to its center: from this world, that is, to the supreme Goddess, which is the course of liberation. The D ī explains the names of the *cakras* and the rewards or power the adept is deemed to acquire when worshipping the Goddess and her retinue of ancillary deities and powers abiding in each *cakra* , as we shall see in chapter 3 below, where the diff erent parts of the *pūjā * are described. 

Trailokyamohana, “deceiving the three worlds”: the three worlds are to be understood as the ensemble formed by the objective world, the apprehension of this duality, and the subject, the “knower” who knows it and who is deceived by duality and discursive thought. 

Sarvāśāparipūraka, “satisfying all desires”: a satisfaction attained, says the D ī , when complete fusion with the supreme Śiva is attained. 

Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhana, “agitation of the universe”: interpreted as alluding to the movement \(s *aṁk ṣ obhana* \) through which the *tattvas* , from earth to Śiva, are reabsorbed into the supreme godhead. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

57

Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka, “giver of all happiness”: the happiness is that of the union with supreme Śiva. 

Sārvārthasādhaka, “accomplisher of all \[human\] aims”: the highest of these aims is liberation \( *mok ṣ a* \) by union with the godhead. 

Sarvarak ṣ ākāra, “eff ecting all protection”: putting away all obstacles to liberation. 

Sarvarogahara, “destroyer of all illnesses”: the illnesses are the manifested world, duality, all that is not liberation. 

Sarvasiddhimaya, “made of all accomplishments or powers”: these are the creation, maintaining, and reabsorption \( *sṛ ṣ ṭ ī * , *sthiti* , *saṁhāra* \) of the cosmos, of which the central triangle is diagrammatically the origin. 

Sarvānandamaya, “whose nature is all bliss”: this is the nature of the supreme godhead, the eternal union of Śiva and Śakti symbolized by the central *bindu* . 

Since the *śr ī cakra* is not only the diagrammatic form of the Goddess but also the means to be used to worship her, the YH adds:



This is where must be worshipped the great Goddess 

Mahātripurasundar ī . Such is, in its perfect fullness, the great *cakra* giver of eternal youth and immortality. //85 

*atra pūjyā mahādev ī mahātripurasundar ī * / 

*paripūrṇaṁ mahācakram ajarāmarakārakam* //85// 

One could be tempted here to note that the practice of the *śr ī cakra* appears to be conferring immortality and not merely liberation, that is, a physical, worldly benefi t, not a purely spiritual one. The D ī , however, interprets this by saying that the one who has immortality and liberation is the supreme Śiva. Therefore, what is obtained by the worship of the *śr ī cakra* is in eff ect acquiring the perfect and immortal state of Śiva, a point confi rmed by the last *śloka* . 

Thus has been said, O supreme Goddess\! the encounter with the 

great *cakra* of the goddess Tripurā, giver of liberation while still in life. //86//

* Encounter in the * Mantra

mantrasaṁketa 

the purpose of this chapter is to teach how to understand the inner hidden meaning—and thus the mystical effi

cacy—of Mahātripurasundar ī ’s 

mantra, the *śr ī vidyā. * As was the case for the *śr ī cakra* , this effi cacy results 

from the agreed common presence \( *saṁketa* \) of Śiva and Śakti in Tripurā’s mantra, whose constituent phonemes will be shown to be pervaded by the interactive presence and power of these two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity and therefore as imbued with saving power. Diff erent aspects assumed by the Goddess, along with cosmic elements, are also shown as expressed by the phonemes of the *vidy* *ā*. 

The interpretations given in this chapter of the hidden meanings of the *śr ī vidyā* are, however, often extremely far-fetched and sometimes very diffi cult to understand, even with the help of Amṛ tānanda’s commentary. Even Professor Dvivedi, whose edition was used to translate the YH and the D ī pikā 

and with whom I read and discussed this chapter, was in many cases unable to explain the meaning of some stanzas and the corresponding passages of the commentary. We therefore do not expect the reader to fi nd our attempt at deciphering such passages very satisfactory or always fully intelligible. 

I will now tell you the divine presence of \[Siva and the Goddess embodied\] in the mantra. Whoever knows this becomes, like 

Tripurā, master of the circle of heroes. //1// 

*mantrasaṁketaṁ divyam adhunā kathayāmi te* / 

*yad vettā tripurākāro v ī racakreśvaro bhavet* //1//

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

59

The master of the heroes \( *v ī ra* \), that is, of those who have attained the highest knowledge and supernatural powers, is the supreme Śiva. The realization of the inner secret meaning of the *śr ī vidyā* leads thus to identifi cation with the supreme godhead. 

The *śr ī vidyā* being the root mantra \( *mūlavidyā* \) of the Goddess is considered to be, like the deity, surrounded by secondary \(or ancillary\) feminine mantras—those of the Cakreśvar ī s, the regent-goddesses of the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* , which the *sādhaka* is to assign by *nyāsa* on the nine centers of his yogic body, thus mentally identifying himself with these nine powers. These nine *vidyās* are the following:

The fi rst is the Karaśuddhikar ī , the second one Ātmarak ṣ ikā, the third Ātmāsanagatā; then, after her, //2// \[comes\] Cakrāsanagatā, then Sarvamantrāsanasthitā. Sādhyasiddhāsana is the sixth one, 

her nature being that of Māyā and Lak ṣ m ī , supreme. //3// The one called Mūrtividyā is the seventh goddess. The eighth one is the *vidyā* Āvāhin ī ; the ninth is the supreme Bhairav ī , //4// also called Mūlavidyā, subjugating the three worlds. 

*karaśuddhikar ī tvādyā dvit ī yā ātmarak ṣ ikā * / 

*ātmāsanagatā dev ī tṛ t ī yā tadanantaram* //2// 

*cakrāsanagatā paścāt sarvamantrāsanasthitā * / 

*sādhyasiddhāsanā ṣ a ṣ ṭ h ī māyālak ṣ m ī may ī parā * //3// 

*mūrtividyā ca sā dev ī saptam ī parik ī rtitā * / 

*a ṣ ṭ amy āvāhin ī vidyā navam ī bhairav ī parā * //4// 

*mūlavidyā tathā proktā trailokyavaśakāriṇī * / 

These nine Vidyās preside over the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* , from the outer square to the central triangle with the *bindu* in its center. To each of them a particular role or function, expressed by her name, is ascribed. The fi rst is Karaśuddhikar ī , “purifi er of the hands,” since the hands of the adept are to be purifi ed before he performs the ritual. He is also to protect himself against all mental or spiritual imperfections and especially against egoism and the illusion of duality, hence the name Ātmarak ṣ ikā, “protector of the Self,” of the second Vidyā. The third one, “who stays on the throne of the Self,” embodies, according to Amṛ tānanda, the consciousness of the unity of the *sādhaka* , the *cakra* , the mantra, and the Self. The fourth is Cakrāsanagatā, 

“having the *cakra* as a seat,” while the fi fth, Sarvamantrāsanasthitā, “abiding 

60

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

on the throne of all mantras,” presides over the portion of the *śr ī cakra* called Sarvārthasādhaka, “which fulfi lls all wishes.” The sixth, Sādhyasiddhāsana, 

“the seat of the accomplishment of what is to be accomplished,” governs the powers nearest to the Goddess, the accomplishment alluded to being the cosmic work of the Goddess as symbolized by the *śr ī cakra* and the *śr ī vidyā. * 

The seventh is the Mūrtividyā, the visible form of the Goddess. The eighth one, Āvāhin ī vidyā, is the one used to invoke and keep \(during worship\) the presence of the Goddess. The ninth *vidyā* is Bhairav ī , the Goddess herself; she is therefore the *śr ī vidyā* , the *mūlamantra* of Mahātripurasundar ī . 1 

Thus, O Mistress of Kula, these nine kinds \[of *vidyās* \] are to be carefully placed //5// at the time of worship, in order, by the *sādhaka* . 

*evaṁ navaprakārās tu pūjākāle prayatnata ḥ * //5// 

*etā ḥ krameṇa nyastavyā ḥ sādhakena kuleśvari* / 

The term *kula* , or Kula, is often met with in the YH and the D ī pikā. 

It refers in a general way to the ensemble of nondualist Śaiva traditions formed by four *āmnāyas* \(see the introduction, above\). But it also has technical meanings. It is used to designate not only the yogic imaginal body but also the physical body or the universe conceived as a body: the grouping of diverse elements. In its usual meaning, *kula* means family or clan, notably the clan of the Yogin ī s. The Goddess as “Mistress of Kula” is thus the mistress of the universe in all its cosmic or bodily aspects. 

The places where these *nyāsas* are to be made are as follows: On the end of the feet, on the legs, the knees, the thighs, the anus, the tip of the penis. //6// On the \[ *mūl* \] *ādhāra* is to be imposed the Mūrti\[vidyā\] on which is to be placed the Ā v ā hin ī . With the Mūla\[vidyā\] one must do a *vyāpakanyāsa* , 2 Parameśvar ī \! //7//

*ādhāre vinyasen mūrtiṁ tasyām āvāhin ī ṁ nyaset* / 

*mūlena vyāpakanyāsa ḥ kartavya ḥ parameśvari* //7// 

Once these *nyāsas* are made, 

One must, on the spots previously mentioned, namely *akula* and so forth, 3 concentrate one’s thought on the nine *cakras* already enumerated, associating \[each of them\] with \[its own\] *cakreśvar ī * . //8// 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

61

*akulādi ṣ u pūrvoktasthāne ṣ u paricintayet* / 

*cakre ṣ var ī samāyuktaṁ navacakraṁ puroditam* //8// 

The adept is to evoke meditatively each of the nine constitutive *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* in each of the nine *cakras* of his yogic body. He must thus meditate intensely \( *bhāvayet* \), fi rst, on the Trailokyamohanacakra, the square outer portion of the *śr ī cakra* , presided over by Tripurā in the thousand-petal red *akulapadma* at the root of the *su ṣ umnā. * Then he meditates on the Sarvāśaparipurakacakra presided over by Tripureś ī , in the *vahnyādhāra,* that is, the *mūlādhāra* , and so forth, up to the Sarvānandamayacakra, with Mahātripurasundar ī , in the *bindu* , on the forehead. 

In this way, the adept perceives mentally the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* and the nine deities abiding there up to the supreme Goddess as present in his body, tiered along his *su ṣ umnā* . This identifi es him with the deity both in her diagrammatic form and in her fullness as the nine aspects she assumes in the *śr ī cakra. * 

Of these I shall tell the names in their proper order. The fi rst is the goddess Tripurā; the second is Tripureśvar ī ; //9// the third is the the goddess named Tripurasundar ī ; the fourth, a great goddess, is Tripuravāsin ī . //10// The fi fth is Tripuraśr ī , the sixth Tripuramālin ī ; the seventh is Tripurasiddhi, the eighth Tripurāmbikā. //11// As for the ninth, she is the great Goddess Mahātripurasundar ī . These goddesses are to be worshipped in their proper order in the ninefold *cakra* previously described. //12// 

*tāsāṁ nāmāni vak ṣ yāmi yathānukramayogata ḥ * / 

*tatrādyā tripurā dev ī dvitiyā tripureśvar ī * //9//

*navam ī tu mahādevi mahātripurasundar ī * / 

*pūjayec ca kramād etā navacakre purodite* //12// 



The worship prescribed here is purely mental, each of the nine 

Cakreśvar ī s being mentally visualized and worshipped as abiding in each of the nine yogic bodily *cakras* , from the red thousand-petaled *akulapadma* 

62

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

to the *bindu* . This identifi es the adept with these nine forms of the supreme Goddess, who appears thus as ninefold though remaining the one and supreme power, bestowing youth and immortality through identifi cation with Śiva:

O Parvati\! The primordial One \[ *ādyā* \] appearing thus at the time of worship under nine \[diff erent\] aspects has in truth only one form, that of the primordial Power \[ *ādyaśakti* \] bestowing eternal youth and immortality //13// 

*evaṁ navaprakārādyā pūjakāle tu pārvati* / 

*ekākārā hy ādyaśaktir ajarāmarakāriṇī * //13// 

The D ī explains here that the only one who is eternally young and immortal is Śiva, and therefore, what the worshipper will now enjoy is the condition of Śiva. The reader will note that the above stanza shows that the aim of the rites described in the Tantra is the gaining of supernatural rewards or powers in addition to liberation. 

The reason stanzas 1–13 of this chapter enumerate the deities of the *śr ī cakra* and prescribe their *nyāsa* and worship in the *śr ī cakra* is not clear, since the theme of this chapter is the expounding of the esoteric meanings of the *śr ī vidyā* . We may imagine, however, that such a worship and the spiritual union with the deity are to precede and facilitate the mental exertion needed to understand the often abstruse reasoning and arcane speculations of stanzas 16–80 of this chapter, which are now expounded. 

The practice of the mantra \[ *mantrasaṁketaka* \] of that \[primordial power\] can take diff erent forms. It is only by following the tradition and the regular order of the various mantras that one can obtain \[its knowledge\]. //14// 

*mantrasaṁketakas tasyā nānākāro vyavasthita ḥ * / 

*nānamantrakrameṇaiva pāramparyeṇa labhyate* //14// 

We have already explained the meanings of the term *saṁketa* in the introduction and chapter 1. Here the term is to be understood as the expounding and, of course, the spiritual understanding of the inner experience, the esoteric meanings of the *śr ī vidyā* . As *śloka* 81 underlines, this understanding can be obtained only by following the traditional interpretation of the mantra as transmitted by the succession of the masters 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

63

\( *gurupāramparā* \) of the Śr ī vidyā school; no outside or personal interpretation is valid. Six such esoteric interpretations are given here. 

The “various mantras” alluded to above are not diff erent mantras but the various meanings given to the *śr ī vidyā* , each considered a diff erent mantra since each discloses a diff erent understanding of it. The expression refers also to the three subdivisions, the *kū ṭ as* or *b ī jas* , of the *śr ī vidyā* 

or to its constituting phonemes, all of which are mantras in their own right. The term may also refer to the nine Vidyās we have just seen, which are both deities and feminine mantras. 

This \[practice\] is sixfold, O Mistress of the Gods\! I will tell it to you, O Perfect One\! 

There is the natural meaning, the traditional one, the inner meaning, the *kaulika* meaning, //15// then the completely secret meaning, and fi nally the meaning according to the highest reality. 

*ṣ a ḍ vidhas taṁ tu deveśi kathayāmi tavānaghe* / 

*bhāvārtha ḥ saṁpradāyārtho nigarbhārthaś ca kaulika ḥ * //15// 

*tathā sarvarahasyārtho mahātattvārtha eva ca* / 

As we shall see, the six symbolic interpretations of the *śr ī vidyā* give mainly the esoteric meanings to be extracted from it, but they also describe meditative and yoga practices to be followed so as to experiment in mind and body the purport and power of the mantra. The interpretations given by the YH are in some cases complex and far-fetched. The most obscure and diffi

cult to understand fully, even with the help of Amṛ tānanda’s \(or Bhāskararāya’s\) commentary, are the “natural” \( *bhāvārtha* \) meaning \( *śl* . 

16–25\) and the “traditional” \( *saṁpradāya* \) meaning \( *śl* . 26–48a\). The other ones are more briefl y expounded. 

Although the explanations given are entirely based on the syllabic pattern of the *śr ī vidyā* , neither the YH nor Amṛ tānanda’s D ī pikā gives its syllabic composition, its “extraction” \( *udhāra* \) 4 . It is clear, however, that for the YH, the *vidyā* is—as we noted in the introduction—in the so-called *hādi* form, namely its fi fteen syllables, shared out into three groups called *kū ṭ a* \(or sometimes *b ī ja* \): *HA SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ • HA SA HA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ *

*• SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ . * 



The natural meaning is simply the meaning of the phonemes 

\[ *ak ṣ ara* \] \[of the *vidyā* \], O Parameśvar ī \! //16// 

*ak ṣ arārtho hi bhāvārtha ḥ kevala ḥ parameśvari* //16//

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

The king of mantras, O dear One\! is at all times engendered by the union of Śiva and Śakti and by that of the Yogin ī s, the V ī ras, and the V ī rendras. //17// 



Thus constituted, delighting in the utmost bliss, the Goddess, 

whose nature is vibration \[ *spanda* \], of innate beauty, once known, is to be freely worshipped. //18// 

*yogin ī bhis tathā v ī rai ḥ v ī rendrai ḥ sarvadā priye* / 

*śivaśaktisamāyogāj janito mantrarājaka ḥ * //17// 

*tanmay ī ṁ paramānandananditāṁ spandarūpin ī m* / 

*nisargasundar ī ṁ dev ī ṁ jñatvā svairam upāsate* //18// 

As we will see in the following pages, the interpretation that the YH gives in stanzas 18–25 of the *bhāvārtha* of the *śr ī vidyā* is anything but a description of “simply the meaning of the syllables” \( *ak ṣ arārtha* \) of the *vidyā* ; of all the six *arthas* , this is by far the most obscure and diffi cult to understand. 

The above stanzas 17 and 18 describe the whole *śr ī vidyā* \(considered the highest and best mantra and thus called the king of mantras, *mantrarāja* \) as resulting from the conjunction \( *samāyoga* \) of Śiva and Śakti and also from that of the pairs of male and female deities surrounding them. In this respect, too, the *śr ī vidyā * is, like the *śr ī cakra* , the place and the embodiment, and the result, of the “meeting” \( *saṁketa* \) of Śiva and Śakti. 

Amṛ tānanda interprets the term *Yogin ī * as referring to the three goddesses Bhārat ī , Pṛ thiv ī , and Rudraṇī and to the three basic powers of Śiva, namely will, cognition, and activity \( *icchā* , *jñāna* , *kriyā* \); these entities, being feminine, correspond to the aspect of consciousness \( *vimarśāṁśa* \) of the Goddess. The V ī ras, associated with the Yogin ī s, are Brahmā, Vi ṣ ṇu, and Rudra, who, being male, are aspects of the light of consciousness \( *prakāśāṁśa* \) aspect of the supreme godhead, who is considered to be in its fullness *prakāśāvimarśamaya* , both pure conscious light and supreme active consciousness. The V ī rendras, we are told by Amṛ tānanda, transcend the cosmos, their nature being pure energy, and whereas the Yogin ī s and the V ī ras are considered to be present in the three *kū ṭ as* , the three groups of syllables of the *śr ī vidyā* , the V ī rendras are associated with the three *HR Ī Ṃ * \(here called *kāmakalā* \) which end the three *kū ṭ as. * 

We thus have to understand the *śr ī vidyā* as pervaded by Śiva and Śakti together with their retinue of male and female ancillary deities. Being thus engendered and permeated by the united Śiva and Śakti and by their threefold 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

65

divine aspects, the *śr ī vidyā * is a veritable embodiment of the Goddess as united with Śiva. This the adept must “know,” that is, experience, realize meditatively, the fact that the *vidyā* is the very self of the Goddess who is then to be worshipped. Neither the YH nor its commentary explains in what respect this worship is to be “freely” \( *svairam* \) performed. We may take it, perhaps, that it is to be performed with all the rites and off erings that will please and honor the deity and help the worshipper to identify with her. 

In the next fi ve stanzas, the YH shows, fi rst, that the *śr ī vidyā* encapsu-lates symbolically the creative power born from the interaction of Śiva and Śakti \(that is, the Goddess surrounded by her retinue of secondary deities\) \( *śl* . 19–20\), this interaction being visibly manifested and experienced in the *kāmakalā* \( *śl. * 21\). Then the supreme power is shown as abiding in the three *kū ṭ as* of the *vidyā* \( *śl. * 22\), this omnipresent Goddess \( *śl. * 23a\) having to be intensely meditated upon and understood. 

\[The Goddess\], in mantra form, is thought \[ *manana* \], made up of the knower and the known. She abides in the eternal Brahman in 

the form of the conjunction of Śiva and Śakti on the plane where 

\[Śiva\] adheres to the fl ow of his expansion which \[ for him\] is but an Indraic secondary trait. //19–20a// 

*śivaśaktyākhyasaṁgha ṭ ṭ arūpe brahmaṇi śāśvate* / 

*tatprathāprasarāśle ṣ abhuvi tvaindropalak ṣ ite* //19// 

*jñātṛ jñānamayākāramananān mantrarūpiṇī * / 

The *śr ī vidyā* is the Goddess in mantra form. She is thought \( *manana* \), intelligence or consciousness, a condition described as consisting of \(or resulting from\) the unifying interaction \( *saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* \) 5 of Śiva and Śakti, since the mantra is the locus of this interaction. Being divine, this interaction takes place on the supreme plane of the eternal Brahman, a plane where Śiva and Śakti, in their embrace and interpenetration, expand and transform themselves into \(and therefore adhere to\) the cosmos. The *śr ī vidyā* is thus, like the *śr ī cakra* , a symbolic form of the cosmic activity of the Goddess. This creative action of Śiva and Śakti is called “Indraic” 

because, bringing about the universe which is ruled by *māyā* , it is similar to the action of the god Indra, who is conceived since the *Ṛ * gveda 6 as taking up many forms thanks to his magical power, his *māyā* . This activity, too, though important, is nevertheless, for the supreme godhead, not a main trait but a secondary one. 

66

The supreme energy is the mother of these \[deities\] taken 

together. //20// 

*te ṣ āṁ sama ṣ ṭ irūpeṇa parāśaktis tu mātṛ kā * //20// 

The *śr ī vidyā* as supreme power \( *parā śakti* \) made up of the coalescence of Śiva and Śakti appears thus as the mother of all the deities and of the cosmos, which issues from her. The term describing this creative aspect is *mātṛ kā* , which denotes also the fi fty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet taken together, that is, the totality of the Word \( *mātṛ kā* can also designate one of these phonemes, being in that case a synonym of *varṇa* or *ak ṣ ara* \). 

The *śr ī vidyā * is therefore described here as including, or being, both the whole pantheon and the whole universe and, implicitly, the totality of the Word: the three levels, that is, of *vāc* issuing from *paravāc* and going down to *vaikhar ī * . 7 This allows Amṛ tānanda to end his commentary on the last half-stanza by saying: “What is expressed \[ *vācaka* \] by the whole 

mantra, 8 which is made up of the \[male gods\] Brahma and so forth and of the \[ female ones\] Bharat ī , etc., is the total fusion \[in the supreme godhead\] of light \[ *prakāśa* \] and consciousness \[ *vimarśa* \] expanding as *paśyant ī * , *madhyamā* , and *vaikhar ī * .” The *śr ī vidyā * as a whole, we are to understand, is identical with the divine power insofar as she is the Word \( *vāc* \). She holds within herself all the forms and planes of the Word and all the deities and all the cosmos, which we saw in chapter 1 as present in the *śr ī cakra* ; she is, phonetically, in a mantric form, what the *śr ī cakra* is diagrammatically. 

The interactive presence of Śiva and Śakti in the *śr ī vidyā* is now shown as manifesting itself in a diagrammatic form as the *kāmakalā* :

\[Held\] between the middle *bindu* and the *visarga* , the supreme \[power\] 

in her coiled form has space and *kalā* as refl ected image. //21// 

*madhyabinduvisargānta ḥ samāsthānamaye pare* / 

*ku ṭ ilārūpake tasyā ḥ pratirūpe viyatkale* //21// 

According to Amṛ tānanda \(and Bhāskararāya\), this stanza describes \(or, rather, alludes to\) the *kāmakalā * diagram \(see fi gure 2.1\). One can hardly say that the wording of this obscure stanza justifi es such an interpretation, which, however, is traditionally upheld in the Śr ī vidyā system. It is as follows. 

The supreme power, *śakti* , in her coiled form \( *ku ṭ ilārūpaka* \), is the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , which stretches between the “middle *bindu* and the *visarga* .” This is to say that she is inscribed within an upward-pointing triangle \(a masculine symbol, that

of Śiva\) on whose apex is a *bindu* and on each of whose two lower angles is also a *bindu* : two *bindus* , therefore, which make up a *visarga* whose written form is that of two dots \(:\). The upper *bindu* , it is said, is *kāma* , desire or passion; it is considered to be made up of the coalescence of the whole Sanskrit alphabet, from *A* to *HA* and as being the Sun. The *visarga* results from the division in two of *bindu* . It is the sixteenth “vowel” of the alphabet symbol-

izing the creative power 9 of *vāc, * its two dots being symbolically Moon and Fire. 10 It is *kalā* , that is, active power. Between these two, between *kāma * and *kalā* , extends the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , which is graphically drawn as the letter *Ī * inscribed within a triangle pointing downward \(a feminine symbol, that of Śakti\). On the down-pointed apex of this triangle is the letter *HA* , or *hārdhakalā* , “the power of the half of *HA* ” \(a term that denotes also the *visarga* \). 

These two triangles with *kun ḍ alin ī * located inside them are considered a symbol of the totality, from *A to HA* . They are also, mainly, a fi gure of the Goddess \(sexually united with Śiva\), her face being the “middle” upper *bindu* , the two lower *bindus* on the ends of the lower line of the masculine triangle being her two breasts, and the apex of the down-turned feminine triangle \(where *HA* or *hārdhakalā * is\) being her *yoni* . The shape of *kuṇḍ alin ī * , the letter *Ī * \(or, rather, the *b ī ja Ī Ṃ * , since *kuṇḍ alin ī * is topped by the middle *bindu* \), evokes her coiled form. This *kuṇḍ alin ī * , says the YH, is refl ected by the two lower *bindus* , a statement not clearly explained by the commentators. Thus, this diagram, with *kuṇḍ alin ī * and the two superposed intersecting triangles, represents the co-presence of the sexually united Śiva and Śakti. 11

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

The interpretation of this stanza as a description of the *śr ī vidyā* embodying the *kāmakalā* diagram, however arbitrary, is confi rmed by other works of the Tripurā tradition, such as Nā ṭ anānandanātha’s commentary on the seventh stanza of Puṇyānandanātha’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* or the N Ṣ A, 2.185–

186, with the commentaries of Śivānanda and Vidyānanda. It is also to be found in the *Gandharvatantra* , 30.37–64, which prescribes a visualization of *kuṇḍ alin ī * shaped as the letter *Ī Ṃ * extending in the yogic body of the adept from the *mūlādhāra* to the *brahmarandhra. * 

This is why she is described as supremely blissful and beautiful and animated by the *spanda* , the primordial vibration that creates and animates the universe. 

The equally obscure next stanza is explained by the commentaries as describing the role played by the letters *A* and *HA* of the *śr ī vidyā* . 

She holds herself in the central block \[ *pin ḍ a* \] of the mantra in the sky of the primordial vibration \[ formed by\] the expansion of the central breath. Then, in the third block, //22// she fl ashes forth undivided in the *kū ṭ a* of Rahu. //23a// 

*madhyaprāṇaprathārūpaspandavyomni sthitā puna ḥ * / 

*madhyame mantrapiṇḍ e tu tṛ t ī ye piṇḍ ake puna ḥ * //22// 

*rāhukū ṭ ādvayasphūrjat* 

The explanation given by the D ī of the fi rst sentence, which alludes to the middle section of the *śr ī vidyā* , called *kāmarāja* , identifi es the letter *HA* of this section of the mantra with the *HA* in the lower triangle of the *kāmakalā* 

diagram, since its says that it is placed between the two lower *bindus* of this fi gure. As in the *kāmakalā* , this *HA* is an aspect of the Goddess and, as such, 

“expands,” being made up of the fulguration of the power of consciousness \( *vimarśaśakti* \), in the “fi rmament of the primordial cosmic vibration.” 

Then one is to imagine that in the third subdivision \( *kū ṭ a* \) of the *śr ī vidyā* , the Goddess fl ashes in the letter *SA* of that group of phonemes made up of the letters *A* and *HA* , that is, the whole Sanskrit alphabet, which is also the totality of the Word \( *vāc* \). 

The next two stanzas refer \(in the same very obscure way\) to the *śr ī vidyā *

as a whole, expressing the cosmic power and role of the Goddess: When, in a state of palpitation, she is joined to the syllables expressing what is to be expressed \[that is\] *dharma* and *adharma* , made of poison and nectar, She is called Omniform. 

* *

69



\[Thus,\] by meditating intensely on the primordial power, the 

Goddess made of three subdivisions, taking her either in her totality or in her constitutive parts, she who is the Mother, the supreme Power conjoining \[in herself all\] these \[elements\], one understands the natural sense \[of the *vidyā* \]. //23b–25// 

*calattāsaṁsthitasya tu* / 

*dharmādharmasya vācasya vi ṣ āṁṛ tamayasya ca* //23// 

*vacakāk ṣ arasaṁyukte ḥ kathitā viśvarūpiṇī * / 

*te ṣ āṁ sama ṣ ṭ irūpeṇa parāśaktiṁ tu mātṛ kām* //24// 

*kū ṭ atrayātmikāṁ dev ī ṁ sama ṣ ṭ ivya ṣ ṭ irūpiṇī m* / 

*ādyāṁ śaktiṁ bhāvayanto bhāvārtha iti manvate* //25// 

What is to be understood here is that the Goddess, taken to be made up of the three subdivisions \( *kū ṭ a* \) of the *śr ī vidyā* , is in a state of palpitation—

that is, active—because she is both the cosmos \(meant here by *dharma* \) and its destruction \(called here *adharma* \). The fi rst of these two aspects is called poison \( *vi ṣ a* \), since the *saṁsāra* is poisonous for the ordinary mortal; the other, nectar \( *amṛ ta* , a term that, in Sanskrit, means immortality\), 

“is the death of death whose destruction is liberation” \(D ī \) or immortality. Creation and destruction— *sṛ śti and saṁhāra* —are the two sides of her cosmic activity symbolized by the *śr ī vidyā. * 

As for the two syllables expressing this double notion, they are *A* , the fi rst letter of the alphabet usually considered to be what “expresses” Śiva, and *HA* , the last letter associated here with Śakti. This “natural sense” 

\( *bhāvārtha* \) 12 of the *śr ī vidyā * is what is to be understood through intense identifying meditation \( *bhāvanā* \). 

The second meaning will now be expounded in stanzas 26–47. It is the one transmitted by tradition \( *sampradāya* \), that is, the secret knowledge received by the disciple from the mouth of his spiritual master. 

Underlining the fact that the whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded \( *vyāpta* \) by the *śr ī vidyā* , that is, by the united Śiva and Śakti, it shows how the phonetic elements that constitute it “express” \(are the *vācakas* \), that is, evoke or denote and thus bring into existence and pervade the universe made up of the thirty-six *tattvas* , the three *guṇas* , the three sorts of knowers \( *pramātṛ *\), the *prāṇas* , and the gods. 

The *śr ī vidyā * and the cosmos, in their structure and in their existence or function, are inseparably one. To understand the *vidyā* is thus to understand the universe and liberation, a knowledge obtained by 

*bhāvanā* 

70

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

\( *śl. * 39\), but only insofar as one receives it from an initiated master well versed in the traditional teaching, hence the name of this *artha* . 

The oral tradition is the great knowledge present in the mouth of the spiritual master. The greatness of that which spreads \[thus\] in the form of the universe dwells in this \[mouth\]. //26// 

*sampradāyo mahābodharūpo gurumukhe sthita ḥ * / 

*viśvākāraprathāyās tu mahatvaṁ ca yad āśrayam* //26// 

Repeating that the ultimate knowledge is to be transmitted secretly from the mouth of the master into the ear of the disciple, the D ī says that the knowledge thus transmitted is that of the real nature of the universe, 

“which results from the transformation, in the form of the three *b ī jas* \[of the *vidyā* \], of the complete fusion \[of Śakti and\] of the supreme Śiva, which can only be received from the mouth of the guru.” 

This cosmic role of the *śrividyā * is fi rst underscored by the Tantra: Through the *mūlavidyā* , of which Śiva and Śakti are the primary 

\[cause\], by her, O Parameśvar ī \! the whole universe is permeated. 

Listen to this carefully, O Dear One\! //27// 

*śivaśaktyādyayā mūlavidyayā parameśvari* / 

*jagatkṛ tsnaṁ tayā vyāptaṁ śṛ ṇu ṣ āvahitā priye* //27// 

Śiva is the letter *A* , and Śakti is *HA* ; the whole universe is therefore permeated by the totality of the Sanskrit alphabet, by the totality of the word with which the *mūlavidyā* , the “basic *vidyā* ,” the *śr ī vidyā* , that is, is identifi ed. 

The universe made of the fi ve elements is what \[the Goddess\] is made of, O Ever Eternal One\! Such too is the *mūlavidyā* that I am telling you. //28// 

From the letter *HA* space is born, from *KA, * wind, from RA fi re; from SA comes the *tattva* of water. //29// Earth is born from the letter *LA. * 

In this way \[is made\] this \[reality\] which contains the universe.

*rephād agni ḥ sakārāc ca jalatattvasya saṁbhava ḥ * //29// 

*lakārāt pṛ thiv ī jātā tasmād viśvamay ī ca sā * / 

The Goddess and her mantra are deemed to be made of the fi ve gross elements \(the *bhūtas* \) constituting the gross, concrete level of the cosmos. 

This is said to show that the universe as identical with the deity is meta-phorically present in the *śr ī vidyā. * 

*HA* , *KA* , *RA* , *SA* , and *LA* are, in all traditions, considered the *b ī jas* , the *vācakas* , of the fi ve gross elements. “Thus,” says the D ī , “the fi ve gross elements and the phonemes which express them are born in this way from the light and consciouness \( *prakāśa* and *vimarśa* \) which form the supreme Reality whose nature is the total fusion of Śiva and Śakti. The nature of this supreme *vidyā* is the total fusion of these two \[aspects of the deity\]. In other terms, she is made of the phonemes that compose her and of the universe \[that they ‘express’\].” The D ī then quotes stanzas 9, 10, 13, and 14 

of Puṇyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* . 13 

It is said that the fi fteen *guṇas* of the gross elements \[are also found there\]. Thus formed, she is favorable. //30// 

*guṇā ḥ pañcadaśa proktā bhūtānāṁ tanmay ī śivā* //30// 

There are, in fact, only three *guṇas* : *sattva* , *rajas* , and *tamas* \(goodness, passion, and darkness\). This number could be explained by the fact that there are fi ve gross elements \( *bhūtas* \), which would result in 5 x 3 = 15. But the commentary explains this number by the fact that the *bhūtas* “interpen-etrate mutually”; that is, the higher ones are present in those that follow, which results in 1 \+ 2 \+ 3 \+ 4 \+ 5 = 15 *guṇas* . This is a peculiar conception, not the generally admitted one of the Sāṁkhya, for whom the gross elements issue from the subtle ones \( *tanmātra* \). Fifteen, however is the number of the phonemes of the *śr ī vidyā* . There are, therefore, two series of fi fteen elements. 

In any object one can say that there is energy \[ *śakti* \]. This \[energy\] 

is the Goddess, the universal sovereign. And any object is the 

supreme Lord. //31// 

*yasya yasya padārthasya yā yā śaktir ud ī ritā * / 

*sā sā sarveśvar ī dev ī sa sa sarvo maheśvara ḥ * //31// 

In this world, says Amṛ tānanda, everything that is active is energy. 

And all energy is the Goddess, the universal sovereign, mistress of all

that exists, from Śiva to the earth, whereas all that is object is the supreme Lord, the supreme Śiva. These two, he adds, take on in the *vidyā* the aspect of objects \(the fi fteen male *guṇas* of the fi ve *tattvas* \) and that of the fi fteen \(female\) phonemes of the *vidyā* . The basic male-female dichotomy is therefore present in the *vidyā* . This, however, includes other elements: This *vidyā* , made up of the elements and the *guṇas* , is pervaded by fi fteen phonemes \[namely\] by fi ve, then six and four syllables. //32// 

*vyāptā pañcadaśārṇai ḥ sā vidyā bhūtaguṇātmikā * / 

*pañcabhiś ca tathā ṣ a ḍ bhiś caturbhir api cāk ṣ arai ḥ * //32// 

These three groups of syllables are those of the three *kū ṭ as* of the *śr ī vidyā* , which have six, then fi ve, then four syllables. These phonemes are said to pervade the *vidyā* , since she is made up in her totality of these fi fteen letters. 

If she is parceled up into vowels and consonants, she is divided into thirty-seven. If divided into thirty-seven, she is formed of the thirty-six *tattvas* , //33// her essential nature transcending the *tattvas* . This *vidyā* , one must ceaselessly meditate.

*saptatriṁśatprabhedena ṣ a ṭ triṁśattattvarūpiṇī * //33// 

*tattvāt ī tasvabhāvā ca vidyai ṣ ā bhāvyate sadā* 

If we divide the *vidyā* into vowels and consonants, we have eleven letters in the fi rst *kū ṭ a* , thirteen in the second, and nine in the third; thirty-three phonemes to which are to be added the three *bindus* which crown the three *HR Ī Ṃ * ; thirty-seven in all. 14 Divided in this way, the *vidyā* can be considered as made up symbolically of the thirty-six *tattvas* and thus to have the same nature as these cosmic divisions of the universe. The *śr ī vidyā* 

is the Goddess in her cosmic activity, carried out by the *tattvas* , which she dominates, transcends, being in this sense a thirty-seventh *tattva* . Her essential nature, says Amṛ tānanda, is that of Śiva, and it is as such that she is to be meditated \( *bhāvyate* \). 15 

The D ī quotes here the fi 

rst twenty-seven stanzas of the 

*Saubhāgyasudhodaya* , which describe the cosmic creative activity of the deity as Śakti, and the divisions and aspects of this work. The passage is interesting but is too long and needs too many explanations to be quoted here. 

74

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

The YH now considers again the fi fteen elements and the three *guṇas* previously mentioned in *śl. * 32:

In the elements earth, etc., each element that is above is pervading, 

//34// the one below is pervaded. / This is why the *guṇas* whose receptacles are the pervading \[elements\] are in those which are pervaded, O Goddess\! being \[themselves\] divided into gross and subtle. //35// 

*pṛ thivyādi ṣ u bhūte ṣ u vyāpakaṁ cottarottaram* //34// 

*bhūtaṁ tvadhastanaṁ vyāpyaṁ tadguṇā vyāpakāśrayā ḥ * / 

*vyāpye ṣ vavasthitā devi sthūlasūk ṣ mavibhedata ḥ * //35// 

Thus, sound, the *guṇa* of space, pervades the \[gross elements\] air, etc., the fi vefold sound \[present in these elements\] being denoted by the *b ī jas* of space which are in the *vidyā* . //36// 

Of these \[fi ve sounds\], what stays in addition as \[their\] cause is made of *dhvani* . \[The phoneme *HA* \] must be \[understood as being\] the seed of those that carry the *guṇas* and also as that which expresses the *guṇas* . //37// The fact that they have \[respectively\] the nature of cause and eff ect shows their unity. 

*tasmād vyomaguṇa ḥ śabdo vayvād ī n vyāpyā saṁsthita ḥ * / 

*vyomab ī jais tu vidyāsthair lak ṣ ayecchabdapañcakam* //36// 

*te ṣ āṁ kāraṇarūpeṇa sthitaṁ dhvanimayaṁ param* / 

*bhaved guṇavatāṁ b ī jaṁ guṇanām api vācakam* //37// 

*kāryakāraṇabhāvena tayor aikyaṁ vivak ṣ ayā * / 

What is to be understood here seems to be that each subtle element is present in the corresponding gross element but also that a gross element 

may be present in another one becoming subtle with regard to it. 16 The so-called *b ī jas* of space \( *vyomab ī ja* \) denoting the fi ve elements are the fi ve letters *HA* present in the three sections of the *śr ī vidyā* . The element added to these fi ve *HA* is, according to Amṛ tānanda, the sixth *HA* of the *vidyā* , that is, the *HA* of the third *kū ṭ a* , placed between the *KA* and the *LA* of the *kāmarājakū ṭ a* . This *HA* is, for some reason, considered to be “made of *dhvani* ,” that is, embodying a subtle form of sound, which would explain why it is the cause of the fi ve other ones. 

The YH continues by expounding the links that exist between the *guṇas* , the gross elements \( *bhūta* \), and the letters deemed to “express” them:

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

75

One must meditate intensely, O Goddess\! on the apparition of the 

\[elements\] air, fi re, water, and earth, distinguishing the gross from the subtle ones, and on that of \[the *guṇas* of \] contact \[which pervade them\] as originating all from the three Mahāmāyā and from the 

*bindu* which is their origin. //38b–39// 

*mahāmāyātrayeṇāpi kāraṇena ca bindunā * //38// 

*vāyvagnijalabhūm ī nāṁ sparśanāṁ ca catu ṣ ṭ ayam* / 

*utpannaṁ bhāvayed devi sthūlasūk ṣ mavibhedata ḥ * //39// 

The Mahāmāyās are the letters *Ī * of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * of the *śr ī vidyā* , the *bindus* being the three *Ṃ * s. 

The three \[ *guṇas* \] of \[the *tattva* of \] form \[ *rūpa* \] are to be meditated on in the same manner using the three *RA. * Their essential part has the form of fi re. \[They are\] indeed engendered by this *b ī ja* . //40// 

*rūpāṇāṁ tritayaṁ tadvat tribh ī rephair vibhavitam* / 

*pradhānaṁ tejaso rūpaṁ tadb ī jena tu janyate* //40// 

These three *guṇas* are those found in the *tattvas* of earth, water, and fi re. *RA* , to be used to meditate them, is the *b ī ja* of fi re, since their essential part is fi re. This implies the presence of form in these three *tattvas* . 

According to the D ī : “The three gu *ṇas* of form, which is the *guṇa* of fi re, having been \[described as\] denoted by the phonemes which are the *vācaka* of fi re, the *guṇa* of water is now described by the phonemes that are the *vācakas* of that element.” 

Taste, both subtle and gross, is evoked through the lunar *b ī jas* present in the *vidyā. * In this world also one knows the association of *rasa* and *amṛ ta* . //41// 

*vidyāsthai ṣ candrab ī jais tu sthūla ḥ sūk ṣ mo rasa ḥ smṛ ta ḥ * / 

*saṁbandho vidito loke rasasyāpi amṛ tasya ca* //41// 

The lunar *b ī jas* are the letters *SA* of the three *ku ṭ as* of the *śr ī vidyā* , the letter *SA* often being given the name *candra* \(moon\). Taste is the *guṇa* of water. It is therefore in its natural gross form in the *tattva* of water, which is taken to be pervading; in the *tattva* of earth, which is pervaded, it is subtle, the D ī explains. 

It also explains \(more comprehensibly\) that according to the Purāṇas, the 

76

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

*amṛ ta* appeared from the water of the ocean when it was churned by the gods and the *asuras* . Hence the link between these two elements. 

The *guṇa* of the earth is smell. Its letter is that which expresses smell. The threefold nature \[of this letter\] is to the result of the link existing between the three worlds, O Maheśvar ī \! //42// 

*vasundharāguṇo gandhas tallipir gandhavācikā * / 

*bhuvanatrayasaṁbandhāt tridhātvaṁ tu maheśvari* //42// 

The *b ī ja* of earth is *LA* , and it is denoted by one *LA* only, whereas there are three *LA* in the *śrividyā. * If one were to object to this fact, the D ī answers: there are three worlds \( *lokatraya* \) in the universe, which are mutually supporting and supported, and, because of that, the earth is also considered triple though being one. 

The other body in the three \[sorts of \] conscious subjects—pure, impure, and mixed—is manifested by the triple *krodh ī śa* present in the *vidyā* . //43// 

*aśuddhaśuddhamiśrāṇāṁ pramātṛ ṇāṁ paraṁ vapu ḥ * / 

*krodh ī śatritayenātha vidyāsthena prakāśyate* //43// 

The triple *krodh ī śa* are the three letters *KA* of the *śr ī vidyā* . They denote the three sorts of conscious subjects \( *pramātṛ * \), which represent three dif-ferent levels or modes of consciousness. They are, says Amṛ tānanda, the *vijṇānākalā* , who suff er only the *āṇavamalā* , the innate impurity of the soul \(the *aṇu* \), their minds being already purifi ed and in essence like Śiva; then the *pralayākala* , bound souls who will be endlessly reborn to “burn” their *karman* till the next *pralaya* ; and the *sakala* , who are bound by all the fetters of this world. 17 

Just as the ten *śr ī kaṇṭ has* are that which expresses the nonmanifested, O Goddess\! so the eleventh remains in the form of breath, the other one //44// is the *puru ṣ a* : being unique, he becomes multiple. 

*śr ī kaṇṭ hadaśakaṁ tadvad avyaktasya hi vācakam* /

77

The ten *śr ī kaṇṭ has* are the ten letters *A* of the twelve syllables that form the *śr ī vidyā* \(which are twelve if one excludes the three *HR Ī Ṃ * \). The nonmanifest \( *avyakta* \) which these the letters express is, says the D ī , the vital principle, the *j ī va, * of the human individual bound by the senses linked to the inert, insentient \( *ja ḍ a* \), not illuminated by divine Consciousness. The other one, linked to the two other *A* , is the *puru ṣ a* , the supreme soul, Śiva, who is, in fact, unique but becomes multiple by his infi nite appearances and by being present in the vital breath of all living beings. 



The deities named Rudra, 

Ī śvara, and Sadeśa, limited \[divine\] 

forms, are invoked by the three *bindus* . The totally unlimited forms, those of Śanti, Śakti, and Śambhu , are denoted by the three *nādas* . 

//45b–46// 

*rudreśvarasadeśākhyā devatā mitavigrahā ḥ * //45// 

*bindutrayeṇa kathitā amitāmitavigrahā ḥ * / 

*śānti ḥ śaktiśca śambhuś ca nādatritayabodhana ḥ * //46// 

The D ī , referring for that to the *Svacchandasaṁgraha* , expatiates on the role of the deities enumerated in this stanza. Rudra, it says, presides over the *tattva* of fi re, in which are the fi ve *tattvas* from *puru ṣ a* to *māyā* , the *tattvas śuddhavidyā* , *sadāśiva, * and *ī śvara* depending from the *tattva* air. Being linked to *tattvas* , these three deities are limited in time and scope. They are invoked by the three *bindus* which “crown” 

the *M* of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * of the *śr ī vidyā* . The three unlimited divine forms, Śānti, Śakti, and Śambhu \(Śiva\), are denoted \(have for *vācaka* \) three *nādas. * Śānti is thus the not-manifest subtle sound \( *avyaktadhvani* \) produced in the *brahmarandhra cakra* , where all the highest energies are deemed to be appeased; one thus shifts here from syllables of the mantra to the body of the adept. Śakti is the highest aspect of *śaktitattva* , Śambhu being the *śivatattva. * 

The YH concludes the section on the *bhāvārtha* as follows: As the threads of a net are gathered in its initial thread, in the same way the mantras are all found together in the *vidyā* . //47// 

*vāgurāmūlavalaye sūtrādyā ḥ kaval ī kṛ tā ḥ * / 

*tathā mantrā ḥ samastāś ca viyāyām atra saṁsthitā ḥ * //47//

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

The D ī explains that the net alluded to here is a net for catching fi sh, the threads of whose mesh are gathered at their “root” in a metal ring from which they, as it were, issue forth. In the same way, the *vaikari* , manifested form of the word, of all uttered mantras, and, of course, the *śr ī vidyā* when made use of, is gathered initially in the supreme, *parā* , plane of the Word, *vāc* . 

Then comes the so-called traditional meaning \( *saṁpradāyārtha* \), which is transmitted through the \(oral\) teachings of the succession of spiritual masters of the Śr ī vidyā school \( *gurūpadeśakrameṇa* \). In this respect, this *artha* does not bring anything new, as appears from its being expounded in one half- *śloka* :

\[The meaning\] that one can attain through the succession of spiritual masters is called the traditional meaning. 

*gurukrameṇa saṁprāpta ḥ sampradāyārtha ī ritha ḥ * / 

The D ī quotes here a long \(unidentifi 

ed\) passage from the 

*Svacchandabhairavatantra* 

which describes how the teaching issuing 

from the supreme “transmental” \( *unmanā* \) plane of the divinity or of the Word \( *vāc* \) goes through several lower divine planes down to the god Śr ī kaṇṭ ha, who then reveals it to human masters. Śr ī kaṇṭ ha, we note here, is not one of the fi ve masters of the *divyaugha* , the “fl ow of divine masters” of the Śr ī vidyā tradition in the *pāraṁparas* given by Śivānanda, Vidyānanda, and Amṛ tānanda. This can be explained by the fact that the *Svacchandabhairava* , which is often referred to in the D ī , is not—

if we identify it with the *Svacchandatantra* —a Tantra of the Śr ī vidyā. 

Concluding on the subject, Amṛ tānanda says: “Whoever who, ignorant of the exact meaning of the words and of the tradition, would, without attending the teaching of a master, try to discover alone the meaning of the words as one can do for the stanzas of the Purāṇas and so forth, shall never be able to fi nd it.” 

The next meaning is the inner or secret \( *nigarbha* \) one. It is not merely alluded to but briefl y considered:

As for the inner meaning, O Great Goddess\! it is an experience \(or perception\) of Śiva, the spiritual master and the self. //48// 

*nigarbho ‘pi mahādevi śivagururātmagocara ḥ * //48// 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

79

This sense is secret and/or inner \( *nigarbha* \) 18 insofar as Śiva is transcendent, unattainable by thought and word. The spiritual master considers Śiva his own inner transcendent self, this same omnipresent self being also the self of the disciple, who is to have a personal inner experience of this full omnipresent pure divine Consciousness, “all his fetters having been destroyed by the compassionate gaze of the guru” \(D ī , p. 174\). This 

“sense”—this experience, that is—of the *vidyā* , concludes the D ī , consists in “the concentration of the mind \[ *anusandhāna* \] on the experience of the unity of Śiva, the master, and the self.” But how is one to concentrate on this unity? The answer is:

I give you only a mere indication of how it is done, O Mistress of the gods\! \[A fusion\] of this sort results from the one-pointed attention on the unity of Śiva, the guru, and the self. //49// 

*tatprakāraṁ ca deveśi di ṅ mātreṇa vadāmi te* / 

*śivagurvātmanāṁ aikyānusandhānāt tadātmakam* //49// 

Namely:

Having understood that there is no division within Śiva and that the spiritual master has the same quality, the \[disciple\], bent down in devotion, unsullied by the presence of contraction, must realize thanks to the power of the gaze of his master that he has himself the nature of Śiva. //50–51a// 

*ni ṣ kalatvaṁ śive buddhvā tadrūpatvaṁ guror api* 

*tannir ī k ṣ aṇasamarthyād ātmanaś ca śivātmatām* //50// 

*bhāvayed bhaktinamra ḥ san śa ṅ konme ṣ ākala ṅ kita ḥ /* 

The general meaning of this stanza is clear. The term “contraction” 

\( *saṁkoca* \) may, however, surprise the reader. The D ī explains that it is the condition of a person whose mind is attached to the life in this world, this condition being revealed \( *unme ṣ a* \) by the pleasure one fi nds in “such external objects as wife, son, and the like.” More philosophically, it is the state of the soul that has lost its original omnipresence and freedom. 

The saving power of the gaze \( *nir ī k ṣ aṇa* \) of the master which “falls” 

\( *katāk ṣ apāta* 

\) on his disciple—one also says 



*ḍ ṛ ṣ ṭ ipāta* —is a common 

80

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

theme. The practice is also used ritually: *nir ī k ṣ aṇa* is one of a group of four purifying rites in Śaiva ritual. 

We may also note here the attitude of devotion \( *bhakti* \), both mental and bodily, prescribed to the adept: a *tāntrika* is not merely a ritualist and a yogin; he is also a devotee. 

The next *artha* is expounded in the next seventeen stanzas. Although it is complex, it is not diffi

cult to understand:

I will now tell you the *kaulika* meaning: it is the unity of the *cakra* and the deity, //51// the *vidyā, * the spiritual master, and the self. 

What this \[unity\] consists of will be shown. 

The four-sided lines \[are born\] from the letters *LA* . The two lotuses, which are fi re and moon and are accompanied by a triple circle, are born from \[the phonemes of \] energy, O Dear One\! From the letters numbering nine which form the three *hṛ llekhā * //53// \[when\] joined to three *bindus* is born the *cakra* with nine *yonis* , O Dear One\! 

The *cakra* that is in contact with the triple circle and which is fi re and energy //54// is born only from the triple *b ī ja* of space. 

Accompanied by the triple subject, associated with the three 

“intoxicatings,” will, knowledge, and activity, //55// is the throne of Sadāśiva, O Goddess\! constituted by the *mahābindu* , supreme. This is why the nature of the *cakra* is that of the mantra. 

*kaulikaṁ kathayi ṣ yāmi cakradevatayor api* //51// 

*vidyāgurvātmanāṁ aikyam tatprakāra ḥ pradarśyate* / 

*lakāra ī ścaturasrāṇi vṛ ttatritayasaṁyutam* //52// 

*saroruhadvayaṁ śāktair agni ṣ omātmakaṁ priye* 

*ḥ ṛ llekhātrayasaṁbhūtair ak ṣ arair navasaṁkhyakai ḥ * //53// 

*bindutrayayutair jātaṁ navayonyātmakaṁ priye* / 

*maṇḍ alatrayayuktaṁ tu cakraṁ śaktyanalātmakam* //54// 

*vyomab ī jatrayeṇaiva pramātṛ tritayānvitam* / 

*icchājñānakriyārūpamādanatrayasaṁyutam* //55// 

*sadāśivāsanaṁ devi mahābindumayaṁ param* / 

*itthaṁ mantrātmakaṁ cakram* 

In these stanzas, the YH goes on describing the mutually interwo-ven condition and interdependence of the *śricakra* and the *śr ī vidyā* . This is shown by saying that the diff erent parts of the *cakra* are born from 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

81

diff erent letters of the *vidyā* . The four-sided fi gure is the external square enclosure of the *cakra* made of three lines—hence the plural \( *caturasrāṇi* \) form used. The “energy phonemes” are the letters *SA* of the three *kū ṭ as* , this being justifi ed by a quotation from a Tantra: “Śiva is *HA* , Śakti is *SA. * ” 

As for the two lotuses, the outer one with sixteen petals is *soma* , a usual designation of the moon, the number sixteen being a lunar number. 19 The letters numbering nine are the three letters *H* , *R* , *Ī * of each of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * \(here called *hṛ llekhā* , “the letter *HR Ī Ṃ * ”\), the *bindu* joined to them being the *Ṃ * of *HR Ī Ṃ . * 

We have seen the *navayoni cakra* in chapter 1. The *cakra* that is in contact with the triple circle is the *cakra* of twelve triangles inside which are the two other *cakras* of, respectively, fourteen and ten triangles, all three being deemed to issue from the three *b ī jas* of space, that is, the three *HA* . 

The throne of energy is the central triangle, the three “intoxicating” \(or maddening\) phonemes being the letters *KA* deemed to be the phonetic aspect of the subjects submitted to the powers of will, knowledge, and activity. 

But if the *cakra* is identical with the mantra, it is also, fundamentally, an aspect of the Goddess. The YH, therefore, says:

It is the other body of the deity. //56// 

*devatāyā ḥ paraṁ vapu ḥ * //56// 

The D ī refers here to stanza 55 of the fi rst chapter, which says that the *cakra* is “the cosmic body of the Goddesss all surrounded by the sparkling waves of her multitudinous power.” This cosmic aspect of the Goddess \(which we will fi nd again in the third chapter, beginning at *śl. * 9, where the Gaṇeśas, etc., are placed by *nyāsa* on the body of the worshipper\) consists of deities \(Gaṇas, Yogin ī s, Ḍ ākin ī s, etc.\), breaths, and aspects of the word, shown as linked to diff erent parts of the *vidyā* . The mantra brings together all these inseparably divine and human realities. 

That the Goddess could, while always supreme and unique, appear as so many diff erent epiphanies should not surprise us. The multiple aspects of deities go back to the Veda; it gives an expression to the diversity of their power. This multiplication, which implies the multiplication of sanctuaries, concretizes \(today and in the past\) the omnipresence of a deity on the Indian soil, sacred space being delimitated by their sanctuaries. 

This totality is shown as follows:

82

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

In addition, since her nature is that of one hundred and eleven deities, the Great Goddess has the supremacy over the *gaṇas* ; further, because of the fact that will, cognition, and activity, together with moon, sun, and fi re, are associated with the three *guṇas* , this Goddess has a planetary aspect. //56b–58a// 

*ekādaśādhikaśatadevatātmatayā puna ḥ * / 

*gaṇeśatvaṁ mahādevyā ḥ sasomaravipāvakai ḥ * //57// 

*iccchājñānakriyābhiś ca guṇatrayayuktai ḥ puna ḥ * / 

*graharūpā ca sā dev ī * 

The one hundred and eleven deities—called “troups” \( 

*gaṇas* \) 20 —

are those surrounding Tripurasundar ī , abiding in the nine parts of the *śr ī cakra* , from Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvar ī , in the center, to the Mudrās and Siddhis, in the outer square. We have already met them in the fi rst chapter and will see their worship in chapter 3. The Goddess, says Amṛ tānanda, is both the deities of the *cakra* and the totality of the deities, of the Godhead. As such, she is the three basic energies, will, knowledge, and activity, in the powers symbolized by the three luminaries \( *dhāman* \), 21 moon, sun, and fi re, and is also the nine planets, the *grahas* . 22 

Her aspect as constellations comes from the senses of apperception and action as well as from their objects, O Mistress of the gods\! 

from the internal organs, from *prakṛ ti* and from the *guṇas* and from the self and the state of *pumān* . //58b–60a// 

*jñānakarmendriyair api* //58// 

*tadarthair eva deveśi karaṇair āntarai ḥ puna ḥ * / 

*prakṛ tyā ca guṇenāpi puṁstvabandhena cātmanā * //59// 

*nak ṣ atravigrahā jātā* 



The Goddess as mantra takes on the aspects or nature of the 

twenty-seven constellations \( *nak ṣ atra* \); 23 these astral aspects are corre-

lated, in the *vidyā* , with the *tattvas* , enumerated here going from the fi ve faculties of action \(speech, grasping, evacuation, copulation, movement\), the fi ve senses of apperception \(hearing, contact, seeing, taste, smell\), their ten objects \(the subtle and gross elements: the fi ve *tanmātras* and the fi ve *bhūtas* \), and then the internal organs, *manas* , *ahamkāra* , *buddhi* , plus *prakriti* and *puru ṣ a* and the *guṇas* . The D ī concludes: “It is because 

* *

these twenty-seven \[elements\] make up her constitutive parts that the Goddess appears as the constellations, an aspect she takes on of her own free will.” 

\[Her\] nature of Yogin ī is now expounded. Because of the Ḍ ākinis, etc., mistresses of the body elements, the skin, etc., she is associated with the eight Yogin ī s presiding over the eight groups of phonemes. Assuming the condition of the Yogin ī s, she shines forth, having the world as her form. //60a–61// 

*yogin ī tvam athocyate* / 

*tvagādidhātunāthābhir ḍ ākinyādibhir apy asau* //60// 

*vargā ṣ ṭ akanivi ṣ ṭ ābhir yogin ī bhiś ca saṁyutā * / 

*yogin ī rūpam āsthāya rājate viśvavigrahā * //61// 

The elements that constitute the human body \( *dhātu* \) number traditionally seven: skin, blood, fl esh, fat, marrow, semen, bones. The D ī 

quotes only six, omitting bones. Their number does not coincide with that of the Yogin ī s which are, says Amṛ tānanda, Ḍ ākin ī , Rākin ī , Lākin ī , Kākin ī , Śākin ī , and Hākin ī . These deities, generally collectively called Ḍ ākin ī s, are traditionally associated with the bodily elements. Here they come together with the eight Yogin ī s, which are, in fact, the eight Mothers \(Mātṛ or Mātṛ kā\), Brahm ī , and so on, traditionally considered the regents of the eight groups of phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet. 24 Together, these Yogin ī s, says the D ī , embody or stand for the totality of the cosmos. 

It adds: “the Goddess plays in the form of these Yogin ī s.” 

Then follows another aspect taken up by the Goddess:

\[The ten breaths,\] *prāṇā* , *apāna* , *samāna* , *vyāna* , *udāna* , *nāga* , *kūrma* , *kṛ kāra* , *devadatta* , and *dhanañjaya* , along with the individual soul and the supreme Self—it is through them that she assumes a zodiacal nature. //62–63a// 

*prāṇāpānau samānaścodānavyānau tathā puna ḥ * / 

*nāga ḥ kūrmo ‘tha kṛ karo devadatto dhanañjaya ḥ * //62// 

*j ī vātmaparamātmā cety etair rāśisvarūpiṇī * / 

This series of ten vital breaths \( *prāṇa* \) is a current one. Together with the individual soul, or vital principle \( *j ī vātman* \), and the supreme soul, *paramātman* , they number twelve, like the signs of the zodiac, which are the same in India as in the West, from which they were borrowed by the Indians. 

The next aspect is less evident:

84

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

The great *vidyā* made of supreme Word and of the other \[three levels of the Word\], having as nature the triple group \[of phonemes\] *A* , *KA* , *THA* , and the other ones, becomes mistress of the *gaṇas* , starting with the third \[of these groups\]. //63b–64a// 

*akathāditripa ṅ ktyātmā tārt ī yādikrameṇa sā * //63// 

*gaṇeśo ‘bhūn mahāvidyā parāvāgādivā ṅ may ī * / 

The Sanskrit alphabet, from *A* to *HA* , is the totality of the Word \( *vāc* \) which—in the view of most Tantric traditions—is considered as existing on four levels: *parā* , the supreme; *paśyant ī * , the visionary; *madhyamā* , the intermediate; and the plane of the gross, empirical speech, of discursive thought, *vaikhar ī * . 25 *A* here designates the sixteen vowels, the fi rst of which is *A* ; *KA* stands for the sixteen consonants from *KA* to *TA* ; *THA* is for the sixteen letters from *THA* to *SA* . The *A* group is considered to be included in the last *kū ṭ a* of the *śr ī vidyā* , the *śaktib ī ja* ; the *KA* group is in the middle *kū ṭ a* , *kāmarāja* ; and the *THA* group is in the fi rst *kū ṭ a, vāgbhava. * The totality of the alphabet is thus present in the whole *śr ī vidyā* . 

When in the three *kūtas* \[in the form\] of *b ī ja* , *bindu* , and *dhvani* , she takes on the nature of the planets. //64b// 



\[When made of her\] syllables numbering fi fteen: the three 

*hṛ llekhas* and the twelve other phonemes, her form is that of the constellations. //65// 

*b ī jabindudhvan ī nāṁ ca trikū ṭ e ṣ u grahātmikā* //64// 

*hṛ llekhāttrayasaṁbhūtais tithisaṁkhyais tathāk ṣ arai ḥ * / 

*anyair dvādaśabhir varṇair e ṣ ā nak ṣ atrarūpiṇī * //65// 

Since there are three elements, *b ī ja* , *bindu* , and *dhvani* , in each of the three *kū ṭ as* , the total is nine, which is the number of the *grahas* . *B ī ja* , the commentary explains, is the *HR Ī * of the three *kū ṭ as* , *bindu* being the *Ṃ * and *nāda* the subtle phonic vibration that ends the *HR Ī Ṃ . * 

As for the *nak ṣ atras* , which number twenty-seven, this number is obtained by counting fi rst the fi fteen phonemes of the *śr ī vidyā* \(fi fteen being also the number of the lunar days, the *tithis* \), 26 then its twelve phonemes without the three *HR Ī Ṃ . * “Thus,” concludes the D Ī , “the *vidyā * in the form of constellations being formed by fi fteen and twelve phonemes, we get twenty-seven in all.” 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

85

The state of Yogin ī of the *vidyā* \[results from\] six syllables: \[those of \] 

energy and those preceding the energies that are present in the *vidyā* . 

Its zodiacal state \[arises\] when one removes those that are at the end. //66// 

*vidyāntarbhūtaśaktyādyai ḥ śāktai ḥ ṣ a ḍ bhis tathāk ṣ arai ḥ * / 

*yoginitvaṁ ca vidyāyā rāśitvaṁ cāntyavarjitai ḥ * //66// 

The syllables of energy are the three *HR Ī Ṃ * ; what precedes them are the three letters *LA* , the total of six being reached if one counts the *HR Ī Ṃ * 

as one syllable only. The aspect of energy of the Goddess is that of the six Yogin ī s, Ḍ ākin ī , and so on, that we have already seen. 

For the twelve signs of the zodiac, one counts the syllables of the *vidyā* 

without the three *HR Ī Ṃ * . 

Maheśvar ī \[when\] in the form of the *cakra* \[has\] in the same way a cosmic aspect. //67a// 

*evaṁ viśvaprakārā ca cakrarūpā maheśvar ī * / 

The *śr ī cakra* , along with the *śrividyā* , is the Goddess in her cosmic activity. 

All the forms we have just seen taken over by her as the *vidyā* —as mistress of the *gaṇas* , and so on—she also assumes when in the form of the *cakra* . 

The D ī tells which parts of the *śr ī cakra* are to be associated with the diff erent aspects \( *gaṇas* , planets, constellations, etc.\) quoted in stanzas 57–66:

\[All the aspects just\] described as in the body of the Goddess \[are to be found\] in the same way in the body of the spiritual master, and, through his grace, the disciple will also shine in this form. //67b–68a// 

*devyā dehe yathā prokto gurudehe tathaiva hi* //67// 

*tatprasādāc ca śi ṣ yo ‘pi tadrūpa ḥ saṁprakāśate* / 

The body of the Goddess Tripurasundar ī , says Amṛ tānanda, is the one she has assumed, in her play, of her own free will \( *svecchāgṛ h ī ta-l ī lāvigraha* \). 

The nature of the guru, he adds, being that of the deity’s body, the deity is also in his body. And this is also to be found in the body of the disciple, who “having benefi ted from the grace of his master, shines, like him, like the deity.” We note here again the importance always given in Tantric traditions to the grace bestowed by the spiritual master, which replicates on 

86

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

the human level the movement of the divine grace \( *anugraha* \), also called 

“descent of the \[divine\] energy” \( *śaktipāta* \). 

Thus is said the *kaulika* meaning, O Perfect One\! Celebrated by the heroes. //68// 

I will tell you also the most secret of all meanings, O Perfect One\! 

*ity evaṁ kaulikārthas tu kathito v ī ravandite* //68// 

*tathā sarvarahasyārthaṁ kathayāmi tavānaghe* / 

This interpretation of the *śr ī vidyā* is the most secret one, says the D ī , because thanks to it, the disciple may attain the supreme \( *para* \). It is, in fact, a yogic practice. 

The *vidyā * having taken on, in the *mūlādhāra* , the condition of the *vāgbhava* , similar to lightning, //69b// her body being made of fi fty phonemes associated with thirty-eight *kalās* , in the form of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , pierces the three *maṇḍ alas* . //70// Shining like ten million fl ashes of lightning, shaped like a lotus fi ber, she attaches herself to the *maṇḍ ala* of the moon of the inner sky, her nature being that of a fl ow of nectar //71// of which she pervades the whole universe, her nature being constant bliss. The thought: “this energy is my own self,” such is the secret meaning, O Maheśvar ī \! //72// 

*mūlādhāre ta ḍ idrūpe vāgbhavākāratāṁ gate* //69// 

*a ṣ ṭ atriṁśatkalāyuktapañcāśadvarṇavigrahā * / 

*vidyā kuṇḍ alin ī rūpā maṇḍ alatrayabhedin ī * //70// 

*ta ḍ itko ṭ inibhaprakhyā bisatantunibhākṛ ti ḥ * /

*sadā vyāptajagatkṛ tsnā sadānandasvarūpiṇī * / 

*e ṣ ā svātmeti buddhis tu rahasyārtho maheśvari* //72// 

The term *vāgbhava* here does not designate the fi rst *kū ṭ a* of the *śr ī vidyā* 

but the condition \( *bhava* \) of the Word \( *vāc* \) whose fourfold division we have seen above \( *śl* . 63\). The *vidyā* is thus identifi ed with the totality and the full power of the Word. This explains why her body \(in the shape of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * \) is “made of fi fty phonemes,” the Sanskrit alphabet being, as we have seen, the totality of the Word. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

87

Going upward, from the *mūlādhāra* , in the body of the adept, the *vidyā* 

as *kuṇḍ alin ī * pierces three *maṇḍ alas* not otherwise identifi ed by the YH 

and its commentary, except \(by the D ī \) as being those of the fi re, the sun, and the moon, traditionally considered to have, respectively, ten, twelve, and sixteen divisions called *kalās* , totaling thus thirty-eight. These *kalās* are cosmic and divine entities with which are associated the fi fty Sanskrit phonemes; here, too, is the totality of the Word. The moon, called *soma* \(the sacred beverage of the Veda\), is traditionally associated with the *amṛ ta* , the nectar, which, when this center is pierced by the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , fl ows over and fi lls up the universe and, evidently, the body and mind of the adept, who is then identifi ed with the divine *śakti* , saying, “This energy is my own self.” 

“The thought \[ *buddhi* \] that ‘this *kun ḍ alin ī śakti* made of consciousness 

\[ *cinmay ī * \] is my own self’ \[ *svātmeti* \], that is to say, the total fusion by identifi cation \[ *tadātmatayā samāveśa ḥ * \] with this form \[of power\], such is the sense of the secret meaning,” says the D ī , which also says that *kuṇḍ alin ī * , having pierced the moon *maṇḍ ala* , enters the *akula* center. 27 

The experience described here is therefore both cosmic and bodily. 

The D ī quotes a stanza from the *Svacchandasaṁgraha* which says that the supreme sky \( *paraṁ vyoman* \) is placed on the head between the forehead and the summit of the head \(between the *brumadhya* or *bindu* and the *brahmarandhra* \). 

Then comes the next meaning:



The meaning \[relating to\] the highest reality, I will tell you, O Goddess. 

It \[consists in\] uniting oneself with the indivisible, supreme, subtle, imperceptible, with no concrete existence, the reality supreme, above the inner sky, light and bliss, both transcending the universe and identical with it. //73–74// 

*mahātattvārtha iti yat tac ca devi vadāmi te* / 

*ni ṣ kale parame sūk ṣ me nirlak ṣ ye bhāvavarjite* //73// 

*vyomāt ī te pare tattve prakāśānandavigrahe* / 

*viśvott ī rṇe viśvamaye tattve svātmaniyojanam* //74// 

This stanza heaps up terms to describe the indescribable divine Absolute. 

The D ī explains the terms, but the passage does not really need to be interpreted. It underlines the total transcendence of the Absolute, adding, 

88

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

“but this supreme reality is also identical with the universe \[ *viśvamaya* \]”; it manifests itself through the infi nite diversity of the world. Quoting the Upani ṣ adic saying *tat tvam asi* , “This thou art,” 28 the D ī concludes: “Such is the supreme truth. And the meaning relating to the highest reality is to identify oneself totally with it, that is to say, to unite one’s self, whose pure essential nature is awakened by the spiritual master, with the supreme Śiva, giver of the supreme *vidyā* brimming with this supreme meaning.” 

But how are we to know this nature of our self? The answer is:

Since luminosity is the state of things that are luminous and also that of those that are dark, there is therefore a necessary and essential connection between the universe and the \[highest reality\]. //75// 

*tadā prakāśamānatvaṁ tejasāṁ tamasām api* / 

*avinābhāvarūpatvaṁ tasmād viśvasya sarvata ḥ * //75// 

Commenting on this stanza, the D ī gives a summary of some of 

the main tenets of the nondualist Śaiva vision of the deity and the cosmos: “Even as Śiva shines in the mind \[ *citte* \] of all living beings, in the same way the self is united to the senses and these to the objects; thus the state of luminosity exists in luminous things, such as the sun, etc., and also in those that are insentient, dark, such as pots and pans and the like. It shines fi rst in consciousness, in the supreme Śiva, who is the Self of consciousness \[ *cidātman* \], then through the play of sense organs; the perception of reality shines also on the plane of the diversity of objects. As the Revelation says: ‘Everything shines as a refl ection of His Light, by His brightness this \[world\] shines’ \(Katha Upani ṣ ad, 5.15\).” 

This vision of the cosmos as something that shines \( *prakāśate* \) as a refl ection of the divine light \(a theme developed notably by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* , chapter 3\) is stated again in the next half-stanza: The highest reality shines, O Flame of the essence of the divine play\! //76a// 

*prakāśate mahātattvaṁ divyakr ī ḍ ārasojjvale* / 

This play \( *kr ī ḍ ā* \) of the Goddess is the unlimited power of divine Consciousness \( *cicchakti* \), a power whose work is to manifest and animate the universe: “Thou, O Goddess\! art the blazing light bursting forth from this action, being \[ for us and in us\] the intuitive comprehension \[ *prat ī ti* \] 29 

eternally fastened on the total union of Śiva and Śakti.” 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

89

The secret meaning, \[the attainment of which is\] preceded by the stability of the spirit that appears when all volition and all doubt are banished, is completely hidden. It gives immediate certainty. 

//76b–77a// 

*nirastasarvasaṁkalpavikalpasthitipūrvaka ḥ * //76// 

*rahasyārtho mahāgupta ḥ sadya ḥ pratyayakāraka ḥ * / 

The state of mind necessary to have this mystical experience of the highest reality is the complete nakedness, or void, of consciousness, without any will to act or any doubt about what is to be done. Once this state is present, the certainty fl ashes forth that “I am Śiva” \( *śivo ‘ham* \), says the commentary. 

It is seen in the ocean of the high knowledge. There, no doubt \[survives\], O Pārvat ī \! //77b// Giver of divine powers, it is present in the 

\[three *kū ṭ as* \] composing the seat \[ *p ī ṭ ha* \] of the *vidyā. * //78a// 

*mahājñānārṇave dṛ ṣ ṭ a ḥ śa ṅ kā tatra na pārvati* //77// 

*vidyāp ī ṭ hanibandhe ṣ u saṁsthito divyasiddhida ḥ * / 

Amṛ tānanda explains the term *vidyāp ī tha* , saying that the Śr ī vidyā is herself the *p ī ṭ ha* , since she is the place where Śiva and Ṣ akti rest together. 

This seat is made up of the three constitutive parts \(the *kū ṭ as* or *b ī jas* \) of the *śr ī vidyā* , whose meaning or spiritual import is to be experimentally realized by following the phonic process that extends from the fi rst syllable of each *kū ṭ a* to the ultimate phonic vibration of the *HR Ī Ṃ * that ends each of them: the phonic plane of *unmanā* , the “transmental.” 30 

As for the divine powers \( *divyasiddhi* \), they are defi ned as consisting of the total knowledge and understanding of the supreme reality, not as the possession of supernatural powers, which is the usual meaning of the term *siddhi* —a meaning that is, however, given to it in stanzas 203–204 of the last chapter: Amṛ tānanda, as we know, interprets the YH according to the Śaiva nondualist tradition, insisting on its metaphysical and spiritual aspects, not the magical ones. 

Will enjoy this, O Goddess\! those who follow the practice of Kula and who meditate on the feet of the Master, who take part zealously in the meetings with the Yogin ī s, who have received the divine unction, are free from the stain of doubt, their spirit ceaselessly joyful

and well versed in the secret meaning known through the uninterrupted succession \[of masters\]. //78b–80//

*pāraṁparyeṇa vijñātararahasyārthaviśaradai ḥ * / 

*labhyate* 

“The *kaulas* ,” says the D ī , “are those who know that *kula* is the body 

and that it can have a very great use.” 31 

Concerning the meditation on the feet of the Master, the D ī quotes the following stanza: “One is the shape of Śiva, luminous by himself 

\[ *prakāśa* \]. \[One, too,\] is the ‘being’ or essence \[ *tanu* \] which is its awareness \[ *vimarśa* \]. The supreme, total fusion of these two aspects \[of the supreme deity\], such is the imprint of the feet \[of the Master\]. It is in essence the supreme Śiva.” The supreme godhead is, in the nondualist Śaiva traditions, both light \( *prakāśa* \) and free consciousness \( *vimarśa* \), a reality that only those who are devoted to the feet of the Master will enjoy. 

The “meeting with the Yogin ī s” \( *yogin ī melana* \) is a collective *kula* ritual in which participants, by pair, male and female, under the guid-ance of their guru, worship the deity, the ritual usually including the sexual union of the participating couples. The D ī underlines the festive, joyful atmosphere of the rite, in which the adepts, fully instructed according to the traditional teaching, free from doubt, enjoy the union with the deity. 

\[So it is and\] not otherwise, I promise you, O Goddess, Beauty of the Family\! //80// Those who, deprived of the tradition, are infatuated with their own science, since they transgress the rule, the rays \[of consciousness\] destroy them. //81// 

*nānyathā devi tvāṁ śape kulasundari* //80// 

*pāraṁparyavih ī nā yejñānamātreṇa garvitā ḥ * / 

*te ṣ āṁ samayalopena vikurvanti mar ī caya ḥ * //81// 

* *

*Encounter in the * Mantra * *

91

The infatuated adepts are those who, being without an initiated guru, do not benefi t from the teachings of the Tantras, do not know the meanings expounded here, and therefore do not understand the full meaning and import of the *śr ī vidyā* and of its constituting syllables: the rules of utterance \( *uccāra* \) of the mantras, and so forth. 

The rays of consciousness \( *cinmar ī ci* \), the D ī explains, are the Mothers of Kula \( *kulamātara ḥ * \), the goddesses Brahm ī , and so on, along with the deities of the bodily elements \( *dhātudevatā* \) 32 , the Ḍ ākin ī s. These divine rays destroy the bodies of the bad adepts by causing a disequilibrium of these elements. 

But he who experiences consciously the joy of the divine essence, staggering in the bliss of alcohol, propitiates the rays \[of consciousness\] at all times and especially in the morning, on lunar days, and on those of the constellation of the deity, obtains the fullness of 

\[awakened\] consciousness. //82–83// 

*yas tu divyarasāsvādamodamānavimarśanah* / 

*devatātithinak ṣ atre vāre ‘pi ca vivasvata ḥ * //82// 

*mar ī c ī n pr ī ṇayaty eva madirānandaghūrṇita ḥ * / 

*sarvadā ca viśe ṣ eṇa labhate pūrṇabhodhatām* //83// 

The yogin who follows the practices of Kula \( *kaulācāra* \) is deemed to be always united with Śiva. His experience is that of “the uncreated fl ashing bliss of the intense absolute consciousness \[ *parāmarśa* \] of his unity with the supreme Śiva.” Then, says the D ī , having partaken of the ritual off erings \( *arghya* \) to the Goddess \(which include meat and alcohol\), he staggers. 

The particular times and days mentioned here are those when occasional mandatory rituals, prescribed in Tantric manuals of worship, are to be practiced by the adept. 

O Mistress of the gods\! such a state \[of mind\] made of highest 

knowledge is immediately obtained by human beings thanks to the grace of the best of spiritual masters. //84// 

*evaṁbhavas tu deveśi deśikendraprasādata ḥ * / 

*mahājñānamayo devi sadya ḥ saṁprāpyate narai ḥ * //84// 

The chapter concludes:

92

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in Ī

Thus, the knowledge that gives all this, which is attained through the science of the phonemes of the *vidyā* , O Goddess\! and is secret, has been explained to you in six ways, O Durg ī \! because of my love 

\[ for you\]. He who understands this becomes immediately lord of the circle of heroes. //85// 

*evam etatpradaṁ jñānaṁ vidyārṇāgamagocaram* / 

*devi guhyaṁ priyeṇaiva vyākhyātaṁ durgi ṣ a ḍ vidham* / 

*sadyo yasya prabodhena v ī racakreśvaro bhavet* //85// 

The lord of the circle of heroes, says the D ī , is the supreme Śiva, which means that the initiated adept who has obtained the knowledge of the six meanings is identifi ed with Śiva. 

*3* 

* Encounter in the Worship *

pŪjĀsaṁketa 

this chapter is also called *saṁketa* , since wherever male and female principles or deities are present in couples during the *pūjā* , Śiva and Śakti can be held to be present in conjunction: they meet and/or fulfi ll their promise \( *saṁketa* \) to be there. The worship, too, although it is that of Tripurasundar ī , is aimed at the supreme godhead, which both includes and transcends the masculine and the feminine. Since the chapter describes ritual practices, the term *saṁketa* could also be translated as “practice,” which is one of the meanings of this Sanskrit word. 

This chapter is the longest. With 204 stanzas, it accounts for more than half of the *Yogin ī hṛ daya* . It does not describe precisely the visible aspect of the Goddess, although she is to be visualized as clearly and precisely as possible during the worship, which is performed on a *śr ī cakra* , without any material icon, the deities to be worshipped being placed immaterially by *nyāsa* , using their mantras, on the diff erent parts of the *cakra* , 1 where they are to be visualized and imagined as present. The fact that the YH 

consists of instructions given by Bhairava to Tripurasundar ī may explain why she is not described. The main reason, however, for the lack of practical informations is that the YH is not a mere ritual manual to be read and used privately by any person. It is a revealed text to be transmitted by word of mouth to a chosen disciple by a master who would give him all necessary information for understanding the doctrine and performing the sometimes very complicated prescribed ritual actions. 

The *pūjā* is to be performed using a *śr ī cakra* diagram, usually drawn ritually and according to precise rules, with colored powders, and adorned as mentioned in stanzas 95b–97. But if this geometrical fi gure is the necessary material basis of the worship of Tripurasundar ī , the *pūjā* , its 

94

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

performance appears \(as is, in fact, the case in all Tantric ritual worship\) to consist more in evoking mental images and uttering \(audibly or mentally\) mantras than in concrete visible actions. At some points, the offi ciating 

adept is to concentrate intensely and/or follow the ascent of his *kuṇḍ alin ī * . 

He is therefore intensely and completely implicated, immersed, in what he is doing, The *śr ī cakrapūjā* is \(or ought to be\) a total—bodily, mental, spiritual—divinizing experience. This aspect appears from the start, in the fi rst stanzas of this chapter, and is continuously underlined by the D ī . 

Now, O Incomparable One\! I will tell you the practice of the worship whose mere knowledge causes the liberated in life to exult. //1// 

Your worship, eternally present and manifest, is threefold, O Gaur ī \! It is supreme, nonsupreme, and thirdly, supreme-nonsupreme. //2// 

*pūjāsaṁketam adhunā kathayāmi tavānaghe* / 

*yasyaprabodhamātreṇa j ī vanmukta ḥ pramodate* //1// 

*tava nityoditā pūjā tribhir bhedair vyavasthitā* / 

*parā cāpy apara gauri tṛ t ī yā ca parāparā* //2// 

The Sanskrit term used to characterize the ritual worship of the Goddess is *nityodita* , which means eternally \( *nitya* \) appearing or arising \( *udita* \), being eternally present. The term is often used by Jayaratha in his commentary on the *Tantrāloka* as the characteristic of the divine Consciousness, which is ever present, active, manifested. It is applied here to the *pūjā* because the supreme deity is deemed to be ceaselessly worshipped in the heart of her devotees, a worship made in the luminous center of nonduality \( *advaya* *dhāmni* \), “in the grandeur of the inner void,” says Amṛ tānanda. The nonsupreme worship is the ordinary ritual worship, which will be described in this chapter. The supreme-nonsupreme one consists in “intense meditation \[ *bhāvanā* \], absorption in the absolute Consciousness, in nonduality 

and in the nondualistic element present in the dualistic worship.” 2 

The main traits of these three types of worship are now shown:

The domain of the fi rst \[type of worship\] is the activity of all \[senses\] 

insofar as they remain in the condition of nonduality. //3a// 

*prathamādvaitabhāvasthā sarvaprasaragocarā * / 

This worship is purely spiritual. The D ī quotes here stanzas 116–117 of the *Vijñānabhairava* , the fi rst of which states: “Wherever the mind goes, 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

95

toward the exterior or the interior, there is the state of Shiva. Since he is omnipresent, where can \[the mind\] go to avoid \[Him\]?” There is no way to evade the omnipresence of the supreme deity. 

The second one, the worship of the *cakra* , is ceaselessly performed by me. //3// 

*dvitiyā cakrapūjā ca sadā ni ṣ padyate mayā * //3// 



We may well wonder how Bhairava would ritually worship 

Tripurasundar ī . He says this, however, in spite of his being omniscient, in order to help the devotees understand nonduality. 

The third one, O Goddess\! consists in \[placing\] that which arises by itself in what is pure knowledge. //4a// 

*evaṁ jñānamaye devi tṛ t ī yā svaprathāmay ī * / 

This practice is “supreme-nonsupreme” \( *parāpara* \) in that it consists \(insofar as we can understand the YH and the D ī \), for the adept, in seeing mentally by an intense meditation of nonduality \( *advaitabhāvanā* \) all the rites he performs—the worship of all the deities abiding in the *śr ī cakra* , that is *—* as immersed in the Absolute. The D ī quotes: “With the off ering, I throw the mental constructions of the limited being, and all such elements, into the fi re which is a compact mass of consciousness, just as one pours clarifi ed butter into the sacrifi cial fi re.” We will see later several ritual acts interpreted metaphysically in the same way. 

The highest is known as the supreme one. Listen now to how it 

must be done. //4// 

Having evoked mentally within the *vāgbhava* placed in the forest of the great lotus the footprint of the \[divine\] Master which fi lls the form of the universe by pouring down the supreme ambrosia, //5// 

\[the adept\] totters, intoxicated with the realization of nonduality with the supreme. 

*uttamā sā parā jñeyā vidhānaṁ śṛ ṇu saṁpratam* //4// 

*mahāpadmavanāntasthe vāgbhave gurupādukām* / 

*āpyāyitajagadrūpāṁ parāmṛ tavar ṣ iṇī m* //5// 

*saṁcintya paramādvaitabhāvanāmadaghūrṇita ḥ * / 

96

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

This practice is considered supreme because it implies a complete fusion of the adept with the Absolute. 

*Vāgbhava* , here as in stanza 69 of chapter 2 \(see above\), designates not the fi rst *kū ṭ * a of the *śr ī vidyā* but the place where the four planes of the Word \( *vāc* \) are situated \( *bhavanti* \). This totality of the Word is to be visualized by the adept as shining in the “forest of the great lotus,” that is, the *akulapadma* , which, as we have seen in chapter 1, is, in this system, a white thousand-petaled lotus located on the summit of the *su ṣ umnā* , where the *vyāpin ī kalā* of the *uccāra* of the mantra is located, pouring incessantly a fl ow of ambrosia \( *amṛ ta* \). The D ī explains that this fl ow of ambrosia is “the fl ow of the essence of the undivided divine Consciousness.” The adept is to have an intimate direct awareness \( *svātmatayā vimṛ śya* \) of this. Note that the above visualizations are to be mentally “seen” in the yogic body of the adept; yoga and worship are inseparable. 

The footprint of the Master is the presence in this world of the supreme Śiva. Amṛ tānanda quotes again the fi rst stanza of his *Cidvilāsastava* : “One is the form of Śiva, luminous by himself. One \[also\] is the ‘being’ \[ *tanu* \] 

which is the awareness of this. The supreme \[reality\], total fusion of these two \[elements\], such is the footprint of \[the Master\]: it is in essence the supreme Śiva.” 

On the realization of nonduality, the D ī adds: “The mystical realization of the absence of all duality with Him consists in being totally absorbed in the \[awareness of \] ‘This, verily, I am’ \[ *saivāham asm ī ti samāveśa* \], a state called intoxication since it makes one \[divinely\] intoxicated; and it is because of the state thus caused that the \[adept\], full of joy, totters.” 

He must turn away from the chatter of discursive thought, being entirely devoted to the contemplation of the *nāda* which arises inside the Small One. //6// 

*daharāntarasaṁsarpan nādālokanatatpara ḥ * //6// 

*vikalparūpasaṁjalpavimukha ḥ * 

To defi ne the Small One \( *dahara* \), the D ī quotes the *Mahānārāyana* *Upani ṣ ad* : “The Small One, without defects, residence of the supreme Lord, lotus of the heart abiding in the center of the citadel.” It is therefore the space in the center of the lotus of the heart: “In this Small One is the inner space” \( *daharo’sminn artarākāśa ḥ * \), says the *Chāndogya Upani ṣ ad* . 

The adept must therefore contemplate, meditate, this symbol of the supreme, concentrating on the *nāda* , the inner subtle vibration he feels in 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

97

his heart, leaving therefore aside such discursive activity as the recitation of mantras. 

The adept must meditate \( *dhyānaṁ kuryāt* \) as follows: Ceaselessly looking inward, \[he participates\] in the intense beauty that is the destruction of contraction by the shining forth of the power of consciousness. //7// 

*antarmukha ḥ sadā * / 

*citkalollāsadalitasaṁkocas tvatisundara ḥ * //7// 

The actual, material worship is now described in the 156 stanzas that follow:

The worship of oneself must be done with elements that are pleasing to the senses. //8a// 

*indriyapr ī ṇanair dravyair vihitasvātmapūjana ḥ * / 

The worship to be done is not of the self of the worshipper but of the deity that is the very essence *—* the deity of one’s self \( *svātmadevatā* \) *—* of the worshipper. The D ī quotes here a text that says: “To worship in a natural fashion the deity that is one’s own self by using perfumes etc. to which the doors of the senses are opened, such is the great sacrifi ce of one who knows.” And it adds: “as has been said, the highest sort of *pūjā* consists in attaining a complete fusion \[ *sāmaras ī karaṇa* \] thanks to the great felicity born from the experience of the sounds, etc., perceived by the ears and the other senses of the worshipper.” The identifi cation of the worshipper with the deity being worshipped, which is the aim of the Tantric *pūjā* , is considered in all Tantras as being more easily achieved when helped by the beauty and charm of the ritual. 

The description of the “nonsupreme” \( *apara* \) *pūjā* begins now, with the preliminary rite of *nyāsa* , which is very complex, a large number of elements having to be ritually imposed on the body of the offi

ciant in order to 

purify and divinize it: identifying it with the mantra, the *śr ī cakra* , and the deities abiding in it. Seventy-nine stanzas \(8–87\) are devoted to this rite. 

* Impositions *\( nyaˉsa \) 

Four series of *nyāsas* are to be performed: fi rst, the “sixfold imposition” 

\( *ṣ o ḍ hānyāsa* \), *śl. * 8–40; second, the imposition of the *śr ī cakra* , *śl* . 41–68; third, 

98

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

the imposition of the deities abiding in the *śr ī cakra* , *śl* . 69–79. Then come four series of placings: the purifi cation of the hands \( *karaśuddhi* \), an imposition of the *śr ī vidyā* , then another *karaśuddhi* , and fi nally a group of impositions of the throne \( *āsana* \) and of several entities. Finally this is completed \( *śl* . 85–86\) by a *tritattvanyāsa* on the whole body deemed to achieve the total 

“cosmicization” and divinization of the offi

ciating *sādhaka* . 3 

One must \[fi rst\] perform the placing of mantras on the body starting with the sixfold placing. //8// 

*nyāsaṁ nirvartayed dehe ṣ o ḍ hānyāsapura ḥ saram* //8// 

The fi rst placing \[must be done\] with the Gaṇeśas, the second one with the planets, the third with the *nak ṣ atras* , the fourth with the Yogin ī s, //9// the fi fth with the signs of the zodiac, and the sixth with the *p ī ṭ has. * The sixfold *nyāsa* \[now\] told to you is said everywhere to be invincible. //10// The one whose body is touched in this way is worthy of being worshipped by all yogins. In the worlds there is no \[being, even his\] father, mother, etc., that he should revere. //11// 

He alone is to be venerated by all \[ for\] he is himself the supreme Lord. If he were to bow in front of someone who has not received the sixfold *nyāsa* , O Parvat ī \! //12// he would soon die and go to hell. 

*gaṇeśai ḥ prathamo nyāso dvit ī yas tu grahair mata ḥ * /

The sixfold *nyāsa* \( *ṣ o ḍ hānyāsa* , sometimes called *mahā ṣ o ḍ hānyāsa* , the 

“great sixfold *nyāsa* ”\), which imposes on the body of an adept or offi ciant 

six aspects or forms of a deity, is described in many Tantric texts and even in some *purāṇas* . It is considered particularly eff ective in pervading the body of the adept with divine power. The divinization of the offi ciant of the 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

99

worship is a necessity, for it is only after having shed his human ordinary condition and becoming divine that an adept is permitted to approach a deity and to perform its ritual worship, the *pūjā* . As the saying goes, “One should worship God \[after\] having become god” \( *devaṁ bhutva devaṁ *

*yajet* \). This is the paradox of the Tantric *pūjā * that it aims at the divinization of an offi

ciating person who, to be permitted to reach this goal, must 

fi rst be already divinized. The paradox *—* the ritual redundancy *—* is all the greater since, as we shall see, the *ṣ odhānyāsa* is followed by other impositions: those of the *śr ī cakra* and of the deities that abide in it.

That there could be fi fty-one Gaṇeśas should not surprise the reader. 

Tantric deities tend to multiply: there are nine Durgās, sixteen Nityās, eighteen \(or fi fty-one\) Rudras, even six hundred forty million Yogin ī s \( *śl* . 

193\); the supreme deity manifests thus the omnipresence of its power. 

Since there are fi fty-one Gaṇeśas, to be placed by *nyāsa* on the same places as the phonemes of the *mātṛ kā* , the latter must be made up of fi fty-one letters, including therefore the so-called Vedic *ḷ *, which is not usual. 

Being Tantric, these Gaṇeśas are accompanied by their consorts, fi fty-one *śaktis* , enumerated in the D ī . In iconography, they are shown sitting on the Gaṇeśas’ left thighs, sometimes holding his erect *li ṅ ga* . The adept, when performing their *nyāsa* , is probably supposed to visualize these couples as he utters or evokes mentally the mantra of each of these gods. The names of the Gaṇeśas and of their *śaktis* are not exactly the same in all Tantras. 

The *nyāsa* of other deities or entities is then described, starting with the planets \( *graha* \): 4 

One must impose Sūrya below the heart accompanied by the vowels, 

//21// the Producer of Nectar on the place of the *bindu* with the four phonemes *YA* , etc.; on the eyes, the Son of the Earth presiding over the group of the gutturals, O Dear One\! //22// Then, on the heart, one must place Venus, regent of the group of palatals; above the heart one will impose Mercury, regent of the cerebrals. //23// On the region of the throat, Bṛ haspati, who presides over the dentals, O 

Dear One. On the navel, Saturn, master of the *pavarga* , O Mistress of the Gods\! //24// Then one must impose Rahu accompanied by 

the four phonemes *ŚA* , etc., on the face, and Ketu accompanied by the letter *K Ṣ A* on the anus, O Mistress of the Gods\! //25//

The Yogin ī s are then to be placed:

One must impose the deities Ḍ ā, etc., mistresses of the constituent elements of the body, on the *vi ṣ uddha* , heart, navel, *svādhisthāna* , *mūl* \[ *ādhāra* \], and *ājñā* \[ *cakras* \]. //30// They are to be visualized exactly through meditation on the feet and on the *li ṅ ga* and the

*pāde li ṅ ge ca kuk ṣ au ca hṛ daye bāhumūlayo ḥ * //31// 

The “deities Ḍ ā, etc.” are a group of secondary goddesses, or Yogin ī s, the name of the fi rst one beginning with *ḍ a* . They are: Ḍ ākin ī , Rākin ī , Lākin ī , Kākin ī , Sākin ī , and Hākin ī . They are traditionally considered the regents of the *dhātus* , the seven constituent elements of the body, of which the commentary here quotes only six: skin, blood, fl esh, fat, marrow, and 

semen, 6 because the YH associates them with six bodily *cakras* only. 

Amṛ tā is the fi rst of a group of sixteen *śaktis* or Mothers \( *mātṛ kās* \); their names are enumerated in a passage of the *Svacchandasa ṅ graha* quoted in the D ī \(p. 238\). 

All these deities are placed mentally on the imaginal body of the offi ciating adept by an *āntaranyāsa* , an inner imposition, which is a mental rite; this is explained in the commentary, which also says that the *dhyāna* , the mental visualization of all the deities, can be found “in another *āgama* .” 

Starting with the right foot and ending with the left foot, one must impose the signs of the zodiac, Aries, etc., with the phonemes \[of the *mātṛ kā* \], O Parvat ī \! //32// 

*dak ṣ iṇaṁ padam ārabhya vāmapādāvasānakam* / 

*me ṣ ādi rāśayo varṇair nyastavyā saha pārvati* //32// 

For this *nyāsa* , the fi fty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are distributed in twelve groups, beginning with the group of the vowels and ending with *K Ṣ A. * 

Finally to be placed on the body of the offi

ciant are the fi fty seats of 

power \( *p ī ṭ ha* \) of the Goddess, that is, the fi fty places on the Indian subcontinent to which the pieces of the dismembered body of Śiva’s wife, Sat ī , fell from his shoulders while he roamed, desperate, after her death when she had jumped into the sacrifi cial fi re of Dak ṣ a: 7 

Then, O Goddess, one must impose the *p ī ṭ has* on the places where the *mātṛ kanyāsa* \[is made\]. Their names are \[now\] given. Listen carefully, O Dear One\! //33//:

We have seen in chapter 1 \( *śl* . 41–43\) the four main *p ī thas* of the Tripurā 

tradition. Enumerated here are the fi fty *śākta* ones, the list of which varies according to diff erent texts. The list given here is perhaps ancient, but this is not certain. Some *p ī ṭ has* can be identifi ed \(Kāmarūpa, Nepal, and Varaṇasi, for instance\), others not. Attempts have been more or less convincingly made at locating all of them geographically. They seem to spread out all over India but not to include Kashmir. 

104

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The D ī explains that each phoneme is to be uttered distinctly when placing it on the body, together with the name of the *p ī ṭ ha* concerned. 8 

The sixfold \[ *nyāsa* \] having thus been done, the imposition of the *śr ī cakra* is then to be performed. Listen, O Dear One\! to the imposition of the *cakra* of the venerable Tripurasundar ī //41// which has never been told to anyone, purifi es the body, and is supreme. 

*evaṁ ṣ odhā purā kṛ tvā śr ī cakrancakrayāsam ācaret* / 

*śr ī mattripurasundaryās cakranyāsaṁ śṛ ṇu priye* //41// 

*yan na kaścid ākhyātaṁ tanuśuddhikaraṁ param* / 

The D ī here extols the *nyāsa* of the *cakra* of the supreme goddess Tripurasundar ī , who is “the supreme dynamism of consciousness \( *paracitkalā* \), the object of supreme love \( *parapremāspada* \), her *cakra* being made up of all the *tattvas* from Śiva down to the earth, which is the place where she reveals herself. The process of this *nyāsa* is to be kept secret. 

It purifi es the body and is supreme.” This, says the D ī , is to say that “it transforms the body made of the thirty-six *tattvas* by bringing it up to the level of the supreme essence”; this is why this imposition is superior to all others. 

First, while saying “Praise to the fi rst line of the square,” one must make a pervasive imposition on the right side: on the back of the shoulder, the extremity of the hand, the hip, and the toes and, on the left side: on the toes, the hip, the extremity of the hand, and the back of the shoulder //43// and also on the base and the back of the head, O Beautiful One\!

*sacūl ī mūlapṛ ṣ ṭ he ṣ u vyāpakatvena sundari* / 

The imposition to be made here is called a *vyāpakanyāsa* , a term we translate as “pervasive” imposition or placing. This practice, very often prescribed, consists of touching the body on several places according to the usual rules of *nyāsa* , the eff ect of these several placings being conceived as spreading from one point to the other in order to \(in the present

105

case\) trace on the body the lines of the *śr ī cakra* . A *vyāpakanyāsa* may also be made with the two hands, which rub or stroke the body to pervade it with the power of a mantra. 

One may well wonder how a square structure with circles inside it can, even in imagination, actually be placed on a human body. The idea, however, is not so much to place a structure on the body of the adept as to place there all the deities abiding in the *śr ī cakra* , thus pervading him with the divine elements, which are in, and constitute, this diagrammatic supremely energetic form of the supreme Goddess. 

On the same ten locations, one must impose the ten Siddhis, Aṇimā, 

and the others. 9 //44// Then, back from these, one is to impose \[the second line of the square, conceived\] as stretching along the body, with the mantra “Praise to the middle line of the square,” O Dear One\! as well as the energies Brahmāṇī , etc., on eight locations of this line: on the big toes of the feet, on the right side, then on the other side of the head, //46// on the left and right knees, then on the outsides of the two shoulders. 

What is to be imposed \[next\] must be placed with \[the mantra\] 

“Praise be to the inside line of the square” //47// as stretching 

along 10 the body behind the points just described. 

On ten points of this \[line\], one will impose the ten Mudrās. //48// 

Eight of them must be imposed on the eight locations of Brahmaṇī , etc., and the last two on the *dvādaśānta* and on the big toe. //49//

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The Mudrās are the deity aspects of the ten *mudrās* we have seen in chapter 1, *śl* . 56–71, which are hand gestures but are also forms of divine power and deities. 

The *dvādaśānta* , the “end of twelve,” is the *cakra* considered to be located over the head twelve fi nger-breadths above the *brahmarandhra* . It is the highest of the *cakras* . The *Svacchandasamgraha* identifi es it with the sky of consciousness, the *vyoman* . 11 

Then is told the *vyāpakanyāsa* of the sixteen-petaled lotus: Inside this \[square\], after having imposed the mantra “Praise to the sixteen-petaled lotus,” one must impose on these petals Kāmākar ṣ in ī 

and the other \[powers\]. //50// The petals are considered as being, on the right side, on the back of the ear, on the shoulder, the elbow, the back of the hand, the thigh, the knee, the ankle, and the sole of the foot, //51// and, on the left side, on the symmetrical \[spots\], but starting from the sole of the left foot. 

*tadanta ḥ ṣ o ḍ aśadalapadmāya nama ity api* /

*vāmapādadalādy evam etad evā ṣ ṭ akaṁ matam* / 

Now, the *vyāpakanyā * of the eight-petaled lotus:

Thereafter, on this \[lotus\], after having made an imposition using the mantra “Praise to the eight-petaled lotus,” //52// one must place the eight energies Ana ṅ gakusumā, etc., on these petals, on the right temple, collarbone, thigh, and ankle and on the left ankle, thigh, collarbone, and temple. //53–54a// 

*tadantare cā ṣ ṭ adalapadmāya nama ity api* //52//

*ūrvāntargulphorujatruśa ṅ khe ca vāmata ḥ * //53// 

*ana ṅ gakusumādyās tu śaktir a ṣ ṭ au ca vinyaset* / 

The commentary gives the names of these eight minor goddesses, 

which all begin with Ana ṅ ga. They are Guptatarayogin ī s, “very secret Yogin ī s.” Their worship is described in *śl* . 131–135 of this chapter.

107

The preceding ones, Kāmākar ṣ in ī , and so on, to be placed with the imposition of the sixteen-petaled lotus, are Guptayogin ī s, “secret Yogin ī s” 

\(ritual described in *śl* . 120–130\). 

Then follow \( *śl* . 54–80\) the impositions \(all of which are pervasive, *vyāpakanyāsa* \) of the circles of triangles that are inside the lotuses and surround the Goddess; the deities abiding in theses *cakras* are also placed on the body of the offi

ciant:

Having made an imposition inside this \[lotus\] with \[the mantra\] 

“Praise to the *cakra* with fourteen \[tri\]angles,” //54// one must impose on these \[tri\]angles the fourteen energies Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhin ī , 12 etc. 

These \[tri\]angles, I will tell you \[where to impose them\]. //55// \[They are to be imposed\] on the right side of the forehead, on the middle of the right cheek and of the shoulder, on the \[right\] side, on the inside of the right thigh and the right leg. Then on the left cheek, and so forth, O Pārvati\! //56// on the left thigh, the left side, the left shoulder, the left side of the forehead, and on the back \[of the head\]. //57// 

After this, one must also \[make an imposition with the mantra\] 

“Praise to the *cakra* with ten \[tri\]angles,” O Pārvati\! 

The \[tri\]angles \[of this *cakra* are to be placed\] on the right eye, at the root of the nose and on the left eye, on the northeast and the northwest angles of the trunk, the knees, and the anus, then on the angles of the trunk named *nairṛ ti* and *vahni* . //58–59a//

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Even for a reader able to follow the Sanskrit text, the two last stanzas are not very clear. The commentary explains, therefore, that the constituent triangles of this *cakra* are to be mentally visualized \( *bhāvan ī yāni* \). The term *kuk ṣ i* , which we translate as “trunk,” means usually the belly, but it is explained by the commentary to mean “the part of the body which extends from the thighs to the arms,” that is, the trunk. The upper portion of the trunk is considered to be on the east side, the lower part on the west, the left and right sides respectively on the south and the north. The “angles” 

of the trunk would then be where the arms and the thighs begin. “Thus,” 

the D ī concludes, “the root of the left arm will be in the northeastern angle 

\[ *ī śa* \], the left groin will be in the northwest \[ *vāyu* \], the right groin in the southwest \[ *nirṛ ti* \], and the root of the right arm in the southeastern 13 angle.” 

Then he shall impose //59// the ten energies Sarvasiddhipradā, 

etc., O Dear one\! 

Then, having made the imposition with \[the mantra\] “Praise to the fi rst *cakra* with ten \[tri\]angles” in that \[inner *cakra* of ten angles\], 

//60// one is to place Sarvajñā, etc., on its angles. \[These are to be placed\] on the right nostril, the right corner of the mouth, the right breast, the \[right\] testicle, the scrotum, the left testicle, the left breast, the corner of the mouth and nostril, and the tip of the nose. 

Such are, one should know, the ten \[tri\]angles. //62//

We may take the Vāgdev ī s mentioned here to be the eight Mātṛ kās, regents of the *vargas* of the alphabet. 

The chin, the throat, the heart, and the navel are considered as forming the right side \[of this *cakra* \]; the *maṇipūra* , etc., being the foursome of the left side, //64// the whole forming the \[ *cakra* \] with eight \[tri\]angles. 

*cibukaṁ kaṇṭ hahṛ dayanābh ī nāṁ caiva dak ṣ iṇam* / 

*jñeyaṁ pārśvacatu ṣ kaṁ ca maṇipūrādi vāmakam* //64// 

*catu ṣ ṭ ayaṁ ca pārśvānāṁ etat koṇā ṣ ṭ akaṁ puna ḥ * / 

The *cakra* of eight triangles is considered “originating” because the three larger *cakras* encircling it, which we have just seen, are deemed to issue from it. This is consistent with the inner movement of the *śr ī cakra* , which goes from the center to the periphery. The central position of this *cakra* , encircling the central triangle within which is the *bindu—* the place of the Goddess *—* is underlined by the fact that it is imposed on four places along the axis of the body, one of which is not a part of the physical body but is the *maṇipūracakra* , a center of the yogic imaginal body 14 situated on the level of the navel \(as the D ī explains\). The weapons \( *āyudha* \) 15 that the Goddess holds in her four hands are then to be imposed:

One must impose on the outside, in the four directions, around 

\[this\] triangle which is in the heart, the arrows, the bow, the noose, and the goad. //65// 

*hṛ dayasthatrikoṇasya caturdik ṣ u bahir nyaset* //65// 

*śaracāpau pāśasṛ ṇi* 

Then, having done the imposition with the mantra “Praise to the triangle,” one must impose on the angles \[of this triangle\], in front, to the right and to the left, //66// the Goddesses Kāmeśvar ī , etc., and, in the middle, the Goddess. 

*trikoṇāya namas tathā * / 

*vinyasya tasya koṇe ṣ u agradak ṣ ottare ṣ u ca* //66// 

*kāmeśvarādidev ī nāṁ madhye dev ī ṁ ca vinyaset* / 

The central triangle of the *śr ī cakra* being, as it were, its heart is, quite naturally, to be imposed on the heart of the offi

ciating adept *—* the heart 

110

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

being, as is well known, the spiritual, mystical center of the human being. 

The lines of this triangle \(to be placed by a *vvāpakanyāsa* , whose effi cacy 

spreads along all of the outside lines\) are to be imposed with the mantra *trikoṇāya nama ḥ * . To avoid any misunderstanding, the D ī explains that the heart is “in the middle of his breast.” Three goddesses are to be imposed there—Kāmeśvar ī , Vajreśvar ī , and Bhagamālin ī —on the three points of the triangle and, on its center, on the *bindu* \(also called *baindavacakra* \), the Goddess. The weapons, it is explained, are those of Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvar ī , 16 two diff erent deities that are the male and female aspect of the Goddess; eight *āyudhas* are thus to be placed. 

Thus, O Goddess\! I have told you the imposition, a most secret procedure. //67// It is indeed to be performed by you most secretly, O Praised by the heroes\! It is to be entrusted to those \[only\] who follow the rule \[of Kula\], never to anyone who is not the \[initiated\] 

disciple \[of a master of this tradition\]. //68// 



This \[ritual\] is more secret than any secret I have revealed to you today.

*guptād guptataraṁ caitat tavā ‘dya praka ṭ ī kṛ taṁ* / 

The extreme importance given to secrecy is, as we have already said, a characteristic Tantric trait. Amṛ tānanda gives here a metaphysical reason for this secrecy. He says, speaking for Śiva: “All this I have revealed to you because you are my beloved, your nature being that of the light of consciousness which is a portion of myself” \( *madaṁśabhūtavimarśātmikā* \). The supreme godhead is indeed *prakāśavimarśamāya* , both conscious light and absolute Consciousness, a supreme truth not to be revealed to unbelievers. 

After this, one must do an imposition beginning with the originating Goddess and ending with Aṇimā. //69// 

*mūlādevyādikaṁ nyāsam aṇimāntaṁ punar nyaset* //69// 

After having described the placing of the circles of deities abiding in the *śr ī cakra* , going from Aṇimā to the Goddess \(called here *mūladev ī * , 

“root-goddess,” since she is the originating cause of the whole universe\), 17

the YH now prescribes the imposition of the same deities in the reverse order, from the Goddess to Aṇimā. This is to be done as follows: On the triangle of the head, one must impose, starting from the east \[the goddesses\] Kāmeśvar ī , etc. 

One must impose—on the right and on the left—the arrows on the 

eyes, the two bows on the eyebrows, //70// the nooses on the ears, the goads on the tip of the nose. 

*śirastrikoṇe pūrvādi kāmeśvaryādikā nyaset* / 

*bāṇān netre bruvoś cāpau karṇe pāśadvayaṁ nyaset* //70// 

*sṛ ṇidvayam ca nā ṣ āgre dak ṣ iṇāgraṁ tu vinyaset* / 

The “triangle of the head” is probably the place of the fontanel. The D ī 

describes it: “there is on the center of the head a triangular place, which is easily seen, being very fragile, on small children.” The deities accompanying Kāmeśvar ī are Vajreśvar ī and Bhagamālin ī . The offi

ciant is to imagine 

on the top of his head a triangular place where he imposes the Goddess surrounded by her three fi rst *āvaraṇadevatās* . 18 The “weapons” \( *āyudha* \) to be imposed on the left and the right of this triangle are those held by Kāmeśvara \(on the right\) and Kāmeśvar ī \(on the left\). 

Along a rosary placed on the head, one must impose the eight 

Vāgdevatas. //71// 

*muṇḍ amālākrameṇaiva nyased vāgdevatā ṣ ṭ akam* //71// 



These eight deities of the word, also named Mātrya 

ṣ ṭ aka, or 

A ṣ ṭ amātarā ḥ , “the eight Mothers,” presiding over the eight groups \( *varga* \) of phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are usually Mahālak ṣ m ī \(or Brahm ī \), 19 and so on. The D ī says they are “Vaśin ī , etc.,” a list proper to the Śr ī vidyā, however, not given. They are also considered to form a group of eight *siddhayogin ī * , as we will see later \(3.154\). 

The *cakra* of the *bindu* and the other ones are \[the only elements now\] to be imposed, O Beautiful One\! on the inside and outside 

corners of the eye, then in front and in the back of the ear. //72// 

In front of the tuft 20 one must impose the half \[of these deities\], the 

other half being imposed on the tuft behind the ear, in front of the ear, and on the inner and outside corners of the eye. //73//

The deities of the retinue of the Goddess, surrounding her, are now to be imposed on the body of the offi

ciant:

One must then impose the \[Yogin ī s\] Sarvasiddhi\[pradā\], etc., on the neck, going from the right to the left. Then on the heart, in the same way, the energies abiding in the *cakra* of fourteen triangles. //74// 

The lotus with eight petals is to be imposed on the navel; this, however, is made on the spine, on the left, then on the other side of the belly, this for the fi rst group of four \[ *śaktis* \]. //75// The other group of four \[ *śaktis* \] is imposed between the spine and the left side, etc.

*vaṁśavāmāntarālādi nyased anyaccatu ṣ ṭ ayam* / 

The exact places on the body on which to impose all these deities are explained in the commentary. For instance, “in front of the tuft” is explained as the forehead. Since our readers are not expected to practice this *pūjā* , we do not believe it is necessary to clarify the text. 

The two next impositions are to be made on two *cakras* ; they are to be imposed by *nyāsa* on the parts of the body corresponding to the *cakras* . For the *svādhi ṣ ṭ hāna* , the group of four deities is to be placed circularly on four places on the lower part of the belly. As for the ten Mudrās to be imposed on the *mūlādhāra* , they are, in fact, to be imposed there and \(according to the D ī \) on the right and the left of the spine:

On the *svādhi ṣ ṭ hāna* one must impose, starting from the east in front of oneself and fi nishing in the south, //76// the \[energies\] in groups of four, successively, in the four directions of space. 

The best of *sādhakas* must impose the ten Mudrās on the *mūlādhāra* . 

//77// Then \[impose\] again the ten Mudrās on the spine, on the left and the right, in between and above and below.

According to the commentary, the ten Mudrās, after having been 

imposed on the body where the *mūlādhāra* is situated, are to be imposed on the right and the left sides of the spine, four in places corresponding ideally to the four directions of space, the nadir and the zenith \(these two directions meant by “above and below”\). 

\[The locations\] above and below being excluded, //78// one will impose the eight \[energies, or Mothers\] Brahmaṇī , etc., on the right leg, this being done as \[was described\] previously. Then, beginning by the left leg, //79// one must impose eight Siddhis, starting from the left, on the same locations, and two others on the soles of the feet.

“Brahman ī , etc.,” are the eight Mothers \( *mātṛ kā* \) who preside over the eight groups of phonemes \( *varga* \) of the Sanskrit alphabet. They are called Vāgdevatā, “Goddesses of the Word” \( *śl. * 71\), and Vāgdev ī s \( *śl* . 84\). 

The ten Siddhis, which are deities or Yogin ī s *and* supernatural human powers, have already been mentioned above \( *śl* . 44\). 

The YH now concludes on the nature and role of *nyāsa* : The imposition spreads from its cause as a lamp, it is said, \[is lighted\] from \[another\] lamp. //80// \[Thus,\] who has performed the imposition in this way, O Mistress of the Gods\! will consider himself as not diff erent from the Self.

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

As the D ī explains, this stanza is to be understood metaphysically. 

What is the “cause,” or, better, what is at the root of the imposition of the *śricakra* \(together with the Goddess and the deities abiding in it\), is the total fusion of the light and the act of consciousness \( *prakā*

*śvimarśasāmarasya* \): 21 the supreme deity insofar as it is identical with the totality of the universe \( *akhilajagadrūpa* \), which, as we have seen, is the real nature of the *śr ī cakra* . By imposing on the body of the offi ciant, section by section *—* as lamps are lighted going from one lamp to another *—* all the constitutive parts and all the deities of the *śr ī cakra* , the adept’s body becomes progressively, part after part, identifi ed with this cosmic Absolute in its several aspects and in its totality. To quote the D ī : “Having meditated and made mentally appear \[ *vibhāvya* \] all the parts of the *śr ī cakra* together with their energies as not diff erent from the various parts of his body \[on which they are imposed, the adept\] 

must meditate and realize mystically \[ *bhāvayet* \] that there is no distinction between himself and the supreme \[Goddess\] presiding over this 

\[ *cakra* \].” 

This identifi cation once obtained, the adept must still perform a few other preliminary rites:

Then \[the offi

ciant\] must do the impositions of purifi cation of 

the hands, etc., his mind being fully concentrated. //81// He 

must impose the *vidyā * on the head, the sex organs, and the heart, on the three eyes, on the ears, O Goddess\! then on the 

mouth and on the arms, //82// on the back, on the knees, and 

on the navel. After this, he must perform the purifi cation of the hands, then impose the throne, the six *a ṅ gas* //83//, Śr ī kaṇṭ ha, etc., and the Vāgdev ī s. Then he must impose the *cakras* of fi re, etc., on the \[ *mul* \] *ādhāra* , the heart, the tuft, and on the place of the *bindu* . //84//

The imposition of the *vidyā* is that of the three *b ī jas* \(or *kū ṭ as* \) of the *śr ī vidyā* , the *vāgbhavab ī ja* being imposed on the head, the *kāmarājab ī ja* on the sexual organs, and the *śaktib ī ja* on the heart. 

The D ī does not identify the throne. The six *a ṅ ga* are the six “limbs” of Śiva: *hrdaya* \(heart\), *śiras* \(head\), *śikha* \(tuft\), *kavaca* \(cuirass\), *netra* \(eyes\), and *astra* \(weapon\), which are, in fact, not limbs of the body but attributes or powers of the god \(or of any other deity\). The *nyāsa* of Śr ī kaṇṭ ha is an imposition of fi fty Rudras, of which Śr ī kaṇṭ ha is the fi rst. The eight Vāgdev ī s, as we have seen, are the Mātṛ kās, Kāmeśvar ī , and so on, mistresses of the *vargas* of the Sanskrit alphabet. 

The imposition of “the *cakras* of fi re, etc.” is a complex procedure. First to be imposed are the *cakras* of the three luminaries \( *dhāman* \), Fire, Moon, and Sun; then the four main *p ī ṭ has* of the Śr ī vidyā, O ḍ ḍ iyāna, Kāmarūpa, Jālandhara, and Pūrṇagiri, with their regents, powers, and attendant goddesses. The details of this process are given in the D ī . 

Then a last imposition is to be made:

Having made a general imposition of the three *tattvas* \[separately\] and together, accompanied by the three *b ī jas* of the *vidyā* , from the feet to the navel, the neck, and the head, //85// then having identifi ed himself with the Supreme, \[the offi

ciant of the rite\] must off er to the Goddess a 

libation whose liquids are the nectars of moon and fi re. //86// 

*tattvatrayaṁ samastaṁ ca vidyāb ī jatrayānvitam* / 

*pādādinābhiparyantam āgalaṁ śirasas tathā * //85// 

*vyāpakaṁ caiva vinyasya svātm ī kṛ tya paraṁ puna ḥ * / 

*saṁtarpayet punar dev ī ṁ saumyāgneyāmṛ tadravai ḥ * //86// 

The three *tattvas* \( *tritattva* \) are Śiva, *śakti, * and *nara* \(God, the energy, and man\), the three components of the cosmos, each being imposed while uttering one of the three parts of the *śr ī vidyā* , the cosmic divine totality being thus imposed on the adept before he begins the ritual of the *pūjā. * 

According to the D ī , the moon is the “half- *kalā * of *HA* without second” \( *anuttara* \), that is, *Ḥ * , which is in the triangle at the center of the thousand-petaled lotus placed at the base of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , whereas the fi re is the letter *S* in the triangle at the center of the four-petaled lotus of the *mūlādhāra* . \(The mantra to be imposed is therefore *SAU Ḥ * , the *b ī jamantrra* of Paṛ ā, the supreme goddess of the Trika.\) From there, a fl ow of nectar

issues, resulting from the fusion of the *amṛ takuṇḍ alin ī * of moon and the *agnikuṇḍ alin ī * of fi re, one fl owing downward and the other upward, assuming the double \(sexual\) aspect of the union of *yoni* and *li ṅ ga. * 

It is thus, O Worshipped by the Gods\! that the fourfold imposition is to be performed. The sixfold *nyāsa* , O Dear One\! that of Animā, etc., and that of the *mūladev ī * , and so forth, //87// and also that of the purifi cation of the hands \[must be performed completely\] by the adept in order to completely eff ect his object. 

*evaṁ caturvidho nyāsa ḥ kartavyo v ī ravandite* / 

*ṣ o ḍ hanyāso ‘ṇimādyaś ca mūladevyādika ḥ priye* //87// 

*karaśuddhyādikaś caiva sādhakena susiddhaye* / 

This object, says the D ī , is liberation, not the possession of supernatural powers, since these are already possessed by the adept who is a *sādhaka* . 

They are to be performed each separately in the morning, at the time of the ritual worship, during the rite of *homa* //88/ and the *japa* ; or the best of adepts will do all of them during worship. 

*prāta ḥ kāle tathā pūjāsamaye homakarmaṇi* //88// 

*japakāle tathā te ṣ āṁ viniyoga ḥ pṛ thak pṛ thak* / 

*pūjākāle samastaṁ vā kṛ tvā sādhakapu ṅ gava ḥ * //89// 

The commentary explains that the sixfold *nyāsa* is to be done in the morning, at the time of the worship, the *nyāsa* of the Siddhis, Animā, and so on; the imposition of the Goddess, and so on, taking place with the *homa* and the *karaśuddhinyāsa* , and so on, having to be performed when doing *japa* . Otherwise, all the impositions can be performed before beginning the *pūjā* , as prescribed here. 

* Other preliminary rites *

Having imagined the throne \[of the Goddess\] as going up to the 

thirty-sixth *tattva* , \[the offi

ciant\] must off er a  *bali* 22 with a mantra to 

the secret Yogin ī s and to the other ones //90//

The Goddess dominates the universe; her throne is therefore made up of all the *tattvas* that constitute it, from the *tattva* of earth to that of Śiva. 

One would be tempted to imagine this throne as rising up from the central *bindu* of the *śr ī cakra* . The commentary, however, says that it is the whole *śr ī cakra* that is to be imagined as the throne of the Goddess, “because it is the receptacle of the rays of light of consciousness \[ *cinmar ī ci* \], 23 of the deities, that is, who abide in the *śr ī cakra* .” Regarding the mantra and the ritual action to be performed, a stanza is quoted as stating: “One must, while meditating in one’s heart the *tattvas* from earth to Śiva, cause the throne to appear by throwing lotuses on which the phoneme *SAU* 24 has been recited.” \(How and on what the lotuses are to be thrown is not said.\) The “secret Yogin 

ī s” \( 

*guptayogin ī * 

\), says the D 

ī , are not hidden 

but are all those that are manifested \( *praka ṭ a* \). The other ones form seven groups: Guptatara \(very secret\), Sampradaya \(traditional\), Kulakaula, Nigarbha, Rahasya \(hidden\), Atirahasya \(very hidden\), and Parāpararahasya. This makes eight groups in all, which are to be found, under the same or under diff erent names, in many Tantric Śaiva traditions. We shall meet these Yogin ī s later, in *śl* . 113–155 of this chapter, distributed in the diff erent parts of the *śr ī cakra* , from the outer square to the central triangle 

The D ī adds that since the adept must fi rst perform an inner, purely mental worship, he must meditate on the *śr ī cakra* “made of all the *tattvas* ” as being his own body and perform a worship on his head with the *mūlamantra* of the Yoginis. 

He will then proceed by removing the internal obstacles:

Since they are shared out among the \[centers named\] *piṇḍ a* , *rūpa* , *pada* , and *granthi* , the \[internal\] obstacles \[are destroyed\] by the imposition of the *vidyā*  on the secret place, 25 the heart, the face, and 

the head, O Beautiful One\! //91// 

*piṇḍ arūpapadagranthibhedanād vighnabhedanam* / 

*guhyahṛ ṇmukhamūrdhasu vidyānyāsena sundari* //91// 

*Pinda* , *rūpa* , *pada* , and *granthi* are places or elements of the structure of the yogic body that are also bodily centers of focused awareness, normally tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* . As such, they represent stages of \(bodily\) experience in the ascending movement toward liberation. They are proper to the Kula traditions, notably the Kubjikāmata. The internal obstacles to be destroyed are 

118

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

mental or sensual dispositions that tend to block the way toward liberation and, in the present case, to prevent the offi

ciant from reaching the state of 

purity necessary for the inner worship he is now to perform. 

How to destroy these obstacles ritually is now described:

He who knows the mantras, driving away the obstacles in the temple of the sacrifi ce, will expel the obstacles that are on the earth by a kick with the heel, those in the atmosphere by clapping the hands, 

//92// and with the *astramantra* and the casting of a glance those that are in the sky. 

*yāgamandiragāṁścaiva vighnān utsārya mantravit* / 

*pār ṣ ṇighātena bhaumāṁśca tālena ca nabhogatān* //92// 

*astramantreṇa dṛ ṣ ṭ yā ca divyān vighnān apohayet* / 

Tantric rites can only be performed in a place or an area that is perfectly pure, free from all impurities and \(more\) all evil, dangerous, or impure forces, hence this threefold rite, whose pattern is customary. The casting of a glance \( *ī k ṣ aṇa* or *nir ī k ṣ aṇa* \) is used in many circumstances in the Hindu world for ritual or spiritual reasons. 

\[Thereafter\] one must visualize mentally with precision the form of a great fi re \[shining\] in all directions, above and below. //93// 

*dik ṣ vadhordhvaṁ mahāvahniprākāraṁ paribhāvayet* //93// 

The D ī , true to its metaphysical interpretation of the YH, says that this great fi re is nothing other than the Supreme Consciousness fl ashing forth everywhere. This fi re, it adds, must be impassable so that none of the obstacles resulting from dualistic thought may enter the consecrated area of the sacrifi ce or the mind of the offi

ciating adept who has mentally con-

structed this luminous image. 

O mistress of the gods\! one is to perform with the common *arghya* the worship of Mārtaṇḍ a accompanied by the energy of light. He is of a red color, resplendent, //94// surrounded by the Seizers, and others, manifesting the brilliance of the universe. 

*sāmānyārghyeṇa deveś ī mārtaṇḍ aṁ paripūjayet* /

119

Mārtaṇḍ a is a name of the sun god, Sūrya. The worship of the sun \( *sūryapūjā* \) is the fi rst item of the daily mandatory \( *nitya* \) ritual worship \( *pūjā* \) of Śiva. The sun is generally considered golden but is also seen as red, especially in the Āgamas or Tantras. When represented in human form, he is often white with a red garment. Red is the color of the Goddess; it is also the color of passion, attachment, and *vimarśa* , self-consciousness, while *prakāśa* , light, is white, the color of Śiva. Insofar as Mārtaṇḍ a manifests the universe, he is on the side of *vimarśa* and redness. 

The Seizers \(Graha\), who number nine, are, as we have seen before \(see chapter 2, *śloka* 58\), the planets, but they are also demonic, dangerous supernatural beings who “seize” their victims. The planets, too, are seizers insofar as they “seize,” or infl uence, human beings. The “others” \( *ādi\)* are the six “limbs” \( *a ṅ ga* \) of Śiva, *hṛ daya* , *śiras* , *śikha* , and so on, 26 according to the D ī ; but *ādi* , in *grahādi* , can also be understood as “the sun being the fi rst \( *ādi* \)” \(of the Seizers\). 

*Arghya—* there is no satisfactory translation of the term *—* is the specially prepared water off ered as oblation to a deity. 27 

The sun worship having been performed \(neither the YH nor the D ī 

describes it\), the worship of the Goddess can begin:

O Goddess\! one must make appear in the right manner the king of *cakras* \[drawing it\] with orpiment, agalloche, and kunkuma mixed with lunar and igneous \[substances\] while reciting the *mūla* \[ *mantra* \] 

of the Yogin ī s. //95–96a// 

*saumyāgneyayutair devi rocanāgurukuṇkumai ḥ * //95// 

*mūlam uccārayan samyag bhāvayec cakrarājakam* / 



By “in the right manner,” the YH means “following carefully the instructions given by an expert.” Orpiment \( *rocana* , also called *gorocana* \) is a mineral form of arsenic, of a yellow color. Agalloche is also a yellow stuff , as is kunkuma \(turmeric\). The lunar \( *saumya* \) substance is camphor, which is white, like the moon; while the igneous or fi ery one is saf-fron, “for it looks like a fl ame,” says the D ī , which also explains that these items are to be mixed “with nectar,” *sudha* , a term usually synonymous with *amṛ ta* . It may, however, also mean powder; *maṇḍ alas* to be used only once are most often drawn with powders. The D ī explains, too, that the *śr ī cakra* is to be drawn on a sheet of gold “or another” \( *ādi* \) material with a needle of gold. It adds that some experts say that the diagram may be drawn “with musk, saff ron, camphor, sandal, and nectar.”

The *mūlamantra* 

to be recited is that of the manifest Yogin 

ī s 

\( *praka ṭ ayogin ī * \), says the D ī ; see our commentary on *śl* . 90 above. 

Then one must throw on it fl owers held in one’s joined hands. 

//96// Or \[one may adorn it\] with gems and coral while \[reciting\] 

the *mūlavidyā * backward One must, in all cases, ensure that \[the *cakra* \] is not empty, \[ for\] if it were empty, the obstacles would be innumerable. //97//

*maṇimuktāpravalair vā vilomaṁ mūlavidyayā * / 

*aśūnyaṁ sarvadā kuryāt śūnye vighnās tvanekaśa ḥ * //97// 

The rule that the *cakra* or the chalice used for the ritual worship of a Tantric deity must never be empty of the prescribed off erings is a general rule. In the case of Bhairava, the Tantrāloka says that if the chalice were empty, the god, always furious and voracious, would immediately devour the adept. More sedately, the D ī says that if the *cakra* were empty of these off erings during the worship, the ritual would be fruitless. 

\[The *sādhaka* \] must place the *arghya* between the *śr ī cakra* and himself on \[a fi gure\] of six angles inside a square, O Beloved of the gods\! 

//98// where, after having worshipped the six *āsanas* and having honored successively inside the triangle the four *p ī ṭ has* Kā, Pū, Jā, O, //99// he must sacrifi ce on the place of the *arghya* to the ten *kalās* of Fire.

The D ī describes the diagram in which a six-angled fi gure with a small triangle in its center is inscribed in a circle, which is inside a square. The chalice into which the *arghya * has been poured \(the *arghyapātra* \) is to be placed on this inner small triangle. The D ī gives the names of the six *āsanas* who seem to be throne deities \(or deities of the throne\), sacralizing, as it were, the “throne,” the place of the *arghyapatra* . 28

Kā, Pū, Jā, and O are the initials of the names of the four main *p ī thas* of the Ṣ r ī vidyā tradition, Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and O ḍ yāna, as we have already seen in chapter 1, \( *ślokas* 41–43\). 

The *kalās* are energies associated with a deity and formed \(or symbolized\) by letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. Fire as a deity \(Agni\) has ten *kalās* associated with the last letters, from *YA* to *K Ṣ A* . 29 

Once the *arghyapātra* is placed, \[the offi

sacrifi ce to the twelve *kalās* of the Sun. //100// He will \[thus\] worship on the chalice the *kalās* of the Sun \[associated with the letters\] 

*KA-BHA* , etc. Then, with clarifi ed butter and \[another\] substance, he will off er a sacrifi ce to the sixteen *kalās* of the Moon. //101// 

*arghyapātraṁ prati ṣ ṭ hāpya tatra sūryakalā yajet* //100// 

*pātre sūryakalāś caiva kabhādi dvādaśārcayet* / 

*vighṛ te tu punar dravye ṣ o ḍ aśendukalā yajet* //101// 

The *sādhaka* is to worship a \(mental\) image of the sun god in the center of the chalice by invoking its image in his heart while uttering its mantra and worshipping its twelve *kalās* , associating each with one of twelve letters of the Sanskrit alphabet from *KA* to *THA* and from *BHA* to *Ḍ A* , while uttering their names, this being done with an off ering of perfumed water. The sixteen *kalās* of the moon are worshipped in the same way, with the sixteen fi rst letters of the alphabet, from *A* to *visarga* , 30 and sprinkling of clarifi ed butter associated with “another substance,” which, according to the D ī , is wine \( *madya* \). 31 

And in its center he must meditate intensely on Amṛ teś ī with the Navātma\[mantra\]. Then, with the Navātman, O Goddess\! he must 

make a libation of the goddesses of the constituent elements \[of the body\] //102// and to Ānandabhairava with \[a mantra\] ending with *vau ṣ a ṭ . * 

*amṛ teś ī ṁ ca tanmadhye bhāvayed ca navātmanā* / 

*navātmanā tato devi tarpayed dhātudevatā ḥ * //102// 

*ānandabhairavaṁ caiva vau ṣ a ḍ antena tarpayet* / 

Amṛ teś ī , “the Mistress of the Nectar,” is a goddess who pours *amṛ ta* on the world, thus helping and stimulating it. The Navātmamantra is usually given as *HSK Ṣ MLVRYŪ Ṃ * . It is an important mantra of the Trika. 

122

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

It is also the mantra form of the beautiful god Navātma, the consort of the crooked goddess Kubjikā, the main deity of the Tripurā tradition of the Kula. We translate the verb *bhāvayet* as “meditate intensely,” which implies a mental concentration so intense as to create in the mind of the adept a precise image of the deity. Anandabhairava is a form of the god Bhairava. The mantra ending with *vau ṣ a ṭ * is the Navātmamantra to which is added *ānandabhairavāya vau ṣ a ṭ * . 32 

The best of *sādhakas* must also prepare carefully, in the same way, the special *arghya* . //103// 

Having worshipped the sandals of the \[succession of \] masters, he must then off er this *arghya* to Bhairava. Being impelled by the latter’s order, he must off er it to the succession of masters. //104// 

*tathaivārghyaṁ viśe ṣ eṇa sādhayet sādhakottama ḥ * //103// 

*gurupādālim āpūjya bhairavāya dadet puna ḥ * / 

*tadājñāpreritaṁ tacca gurupa ṅ ktau nivedayet* //104// 

The sandals or footprints \( *pādukā* \) of the gurus are those of all the masters of the tradition of Tripurā, from Śiva to one’s own guru. These *pādukas* are metaphysically the imprint, the trace of the presence of the supreme deity in this world; to worship them is therefore to worship the deity as present in this world. The *gurupūjā * is a mandatory element of the fi rst part of the Tantric *pūjā. * 

In this tradition, the succession of the gurus is deemed to go through three stages, called fl ows \( *ogha* \). First, the divine \( *divya* \) fl ow, starting with Śiva followed by four masters, one for each of the four cosmic cycles, the *yugas* from *Kṛ tayuga* to *Kaliyuga* ; then the fl ow of perfect or accomplished masters \( *siddhaugha* \); and fi nally, the human ones \( *mānavaugha* \), the succession of the masters of this world, going from the fi rst revelation of the doctrine to our days. The D ī tells how to worship them: the *arghya* is to be elevated three times up to his head by the offi

ciant, then off ered to 

Bhairava, who, as the Master, is in a triangle in the center of the “forest of the great lotus,” which, as we have seen \( *śl. * 3–5\), is on the *brahmarandhra* . 

Having collected what remains of it, one must perform \[with it\] an oblation in the fi re of desire where the whole universe is burning while reciting the *mūlavidyā* and the \[ formula of worship of \] the sandals of the Master. //105// 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

123

*tad ī yaṁ śe ṣ am ādāya kāmagnau viśvatastvi ṣ i* / 

*pādukāṁ mūlavidyāṁ ca japan humaṁ samācaret* //105// 

As is underlined at length by the D ī , this oblation is not so much a material as a symbolic rite. Actual pouring may take place, but the process is a mental, spiritual one. The offi

ciant, namely, is to imagine 

the Master as standing on his head, and, as the Master \(the godhead\) orders, he is to off er mentally in the “fi re of consciousness,” that is, to the supreme godhead in her aspect of cosmic destruction, the whole creation together with his own mental constructions. It is an oblation consisting of symbolically throwing duality into the fi re of consciousness in order to burn it entirely. 

In spite of the symbolic nature and meaning of the oblation, what remains of it after it has been off ered to the deity is supposed to be absorbed by the offi

ciant. 

The YH explains further its metaphysical value:

One must pour in oblation, together with the internal organ or 

intellect, the activity of the rays of light in the great light \[located\] in the mouth of Kuṇḍ al ī , where the resorption and vomiting forth of the cosmic fl ow take place. //106// 

*mahāprakāśe viśvasya saṁsāravamanodyate* / 

*mar ī civṛ ttir juhuyān manasā kuṇḍ al ī mukhe* //106// 

The YH pursues the metaphysical aspect of the oblation:

Conceiving the unity of I-ness and objectivity as being in the ladle *srùc* , which is *unman ī * , what is born there through the intensity of the rubbing is the great oblation. //107// Pouring and pouring himself the oblation, \[the adept\] becomes spontaneous bliss. 

*ahantedantayor aikyam unmanyāṁ sruci kalpitam* / 

*mathanodrekasambhūtaṁ vasturūpaṁ mahāhavi ḥ * //107// 

*hutvā hutvā svayaṁ caivaṁ sahajānandavigraha ḥ * / 

The ladle *srùc* is one of the two ladles used since Vedic times for off ering the ritual oblation in the fi re, the *homa* . This ladle, in the present case, is not a material object. It is the “transmental” \( *unman ī * \), the highest 

plane of consciousness. 33 It is on this level that the oblation takes place; 

124

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

it consists of pouring \(in spirit\) all the aspects of the cosmic manifestation in the central, both human and divine, void of consciousness. This is why a “spontaneous” \(that is, uncaused\) bliss arises in the offi ciating 

adept. The D ī says: “Having poured again and again the full oblation \(both human and divine\) of clarifi ed butter, which in reality is the total fusion of the objectivity and the I-ness \( *ahāntā* \) 34 born from the rubbing of the 

*araṇis* of the mantra, \[one reaches\] the supreme fulgurating bliss. Such is the internal oblation.” 

According to a passage of the D ī \(which also quotes stanza 72 of the Vijñānabhairava\), the oblation may be made of *amṛ ta* and may even include an alcoholic substance *—* a possibility the D ī mentions again when, commenting the next half- *śloka* , it says that a wise man is somebody who, because he drinks alcohol, keeps his mind concentrated in a single intent. From this concentration \( *dhāraṇā* \), meditation \( *dhyāna* \) is born: “without concentration, the worship is fruitless.” Thus, having off ered to the Masters, Śiva, and so forth, alcohol transformed into nectar \( *amṛ ta* \) and having poured it in off ering into the fi re of the self, the spirit of the adept will become perfectly stable, and he will experience the supreme, blazing bliss. The practice is mental, spiritual, rather than actually performed with an alcoholic beverage. 

Thus, as stated in the next half- *śloka* :

The wise \[adept\] must then perform the worship of the *śr ī cakra* , the form that the expansion of his consciousness takes as it spreads out. //108// 

*svaprathāprasarākāraṁ śr ī cakraṁ pūjayet sudhi ḥ * //108// 

The *śr ī cakra* can be said to be the form taken by the adept’s consciousness as it spreads out, because in the nonduality of consciousness \( *saṁvidadvaya* 

\) of Kashmir Shaivism, there is no diff erence between 

human consciousness and the deity’s absolute consciousness. To quote the D ī : “What shines \(i.e., appears\) as the *śr ī cakra* is nothing else than the cosmic expansion of the godhead who is his \(the adept’s\) consciousness, an expansion formed by the fourfold *antahkarana* , the inevolute \( *avyakta* \), the *mahant* , and the *ahaṁkāra* , along with the subtle elements \( *tanmātra* \), the ten senses \( *indriya* \), their ten activities, their objects, the *purya ṣ ṭ aka* , and the expansion \[which goes down\] to the gross elements \( *dhātu* \) and 

\[ forms\] the sixteen ‘evolutes’ \( *vikāra* \).” 35 

Now comes the description of the *śr ī cakra pūjā* proper, *ślokas* 109–168. 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

125

* The śrīcakra pu*¯ *jaˉ *

This *pūjā* consists of the worship of Tripurasundar ī and her retinue of ancillary deities: of the several deities abiding in the *śr ī cakra* , from those in the outer square section to the Goddess in the central triangle. The worship is followed by the *japa* of the *śr ī vidyā * and a fi nal off ering in the fi re, a *homa* . 

A sacrifi ce 36 to Gaṇeśa and to Dūtar ī , to the Master of the Field, and to Dūt ī is to be performed, O Goddess\! as also, on the external door, to the goddesses headed by Svastikā. //109// 

*gaṇeśaṁ dūtar ī ṁ caiva k ṣ etreśaṁ dūtikāṁ tathā* / 

*bāhyadvāre yajed devi dev ī śca svastikādikā ḥ * //109// 

The D ī explains that the ritual worship of the fi rst group of deities is to be performed “on the frame of the door” of the outer square section of the *śr ī cakra* . The Master of the Field, K ṣ etreśa or Ksetrapāla, is the god Ba ṭ uka, an aspect of Bhairava; Dut ī is his consort. The goddesses headed by Svastikā, worshipped on the external part of the door, number fi ve; they are “singing goddesses” \( *gāyikā* \), deemed to delight Tripurasundar ī with their songs. 

Then the line of masters, which abides, threefold, in the inner triangle is also \[to be worshipped\]. 

*tataś cāntastrikoṇe ‘pi gurupa ṅ ktiṁ tridhā sthitam* / 

The succession of the masters of the Tripurā tradition is said to be threefold because, as we have seen \( *śl* . 104\), starting from Śiva, it is divided into three groups: divine, perfect, and human gurus. This succession is secret, says the D ī . It is not to be found in books but learned by word of mouth. 

and in this \[ *baindavacakra* \] he will worship, after having invoked her, the great Goddess //110// who holds herself in the forest of the great lotus, resting against my side, her body \[fi lled with\] the joy of the 

“cause”: You, Goddess, who gives the fruits that the will desires\! //111// 

\[This\] worship is to be performed with off erings of food, etc., of which you are yourself formed. 

*tadantaś ca mahādev ī ṁ tām āvāhya yajet puna ḥ * //110// 

*mahāpadmavanāntasthāṁ kāraṇāndavigrahām* / 

126

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

*mada ṅ kopāśrayāṁ dev ī m icchākāmaphalapradām* //111// 

*bhavat ī ṁ tavanmayair eva naivedyādibhir arcayet* / 

The “Forest of the Great Lotus,” as we have seen \( *śl* . 5\), is the *akula* lotus of one thousand petals on the summit of the *su ṣ umnā* . It is therefore on a spot of his own yogic body that the adept is to mentally perform this worship. The ritual process of the *pūjā* appears here *—* as it will do again later *—* as a total process, both bodily and mental. The Goddess is seen in this lotus leaning against Bhairava, on whose left thigh she is sitting. 

As for the “cause” \( *kāraṇa* \) 37 that fi lls her with joy, it is an alcoholic beverage, as is appropriate in a Tantric ritual. This, says the D ī , when drunk by the Goddess, becomes nectar and fi lls her body with joy, her body being henceforth pure, supreme, luminous bliss. 

The off erings of “food, etc.,” are the usual ritual off erings of perfume, food, lights, incense, and fl owers, each corresponding to one of the fi ve constitutive gross elements of the cosmos and of the body: earth, water, fi re, air, and space, elements of which the Goddess is also constituted insofar as she is identical with the cosmos. 

The D ī expatiates at length on the metaphysical symbolic interpretation of these off erings; as interesting as they are, these developments are too long and complex to be reported here. 

Then, on the triangle, \[one must worship\] the refl ected forms of her fl ashing forth, //112// the Nityās made of all the *tithis* , their aspects being those suitable for optional rites. 

*trikoṇe tatsphurattāyā ḥ pratibimbākṛ t ī ḥ puṇa ḥ * //112// 

*tattattithimay ī r nityā ḥ kāmyakarmānurūpiṇī ḥ * / 

This worship is to be performed on the three lines of the central triangle. The Nityās \(the Eternal Ones\) are ancillary deities numbering sixteen, identifi ed with the phonemes of the *śr ī vidyā* , which surround the Goddess. They are also identifi ed with the *tithis* , the lunar days, 

which are divine entities and also number sixteen. 38 The *śr ī cakrapūjā *

being performed to attain a desired \( *kāmya* \) goal, all the rites it includes are so-called optional or desiderative \( *kāmya* \) rites; the mentally visualized forms of all the deities must therefore be adapted to that type of worship. 39

127

There, in the Trailokyamohana\[cakra\], are the manifested Yogin ī s. 

//113// Because they are gross forms of the *mātṛ kā* , these Yogin ī s pervade the skin, etc. They are known as manifest for they are \[located in a *cakra* \] whose nature is to support the gross world. //114//

*mātṛ kāsthūlarūpatvāt tvagādivyāpakatvata ḥ * / 

*yoginya ḥ praka ṭ ā jñeyā ḥ sthūlaviśvapradhātmani* //114// 

The skin is one of the seven constituent elements of the organic body which are therefore gross \( *sthūla* \), a character shared by the so-called manifest Yogin ī s, who, appropriately, abide \(and are worshipped\) in the outer square part of the *śr ī cakra* \(also named *bhūgṛ ha* , “underground room”\), a part that can be said to support the world, since it is the section of the diagram that is metaphysically on the level of the manifested universe. It is also the plane of *vaikhar ī * , the lowest, gross level of the Word \( *vāc* \). 

\[There, too,\] abide the eight *siddhis* Aṇimā and the others, O great Goddess\! They are deep red in color; their hands make the gesture of propitiation and protection. //115// They hold the great fabulous gem and thus give the fruit one desires. 

*aṇimādyā mahādevi siddhayo ‘ ṣ ṭ au vyavasthitā ḥ * / 

*tās tu raktatarā varṇair varābhayakarās tathā * //115//

We have already seen the *siddhis* \( *śl* . 44\). The “great fabulous gem” is the *cintāmaṇi* \(or *mahācintamaṇi* \) supposed to fulfi ll all desires of its pos-sessor. It is mentioned in many Sanskrit works. 

There also one must worship, in order, Brāhm ī , etc., O Dear One. 

//116// 

Brahmāṇī , yellow in color and adorned with four faces, her hands in the *varadā * and *abhaya mudrās* , holds a jug and a rosary, radiant.

Māheśvar ī , white in color, having three eyes and holding in her hands the trident, the skull, the antelope, and the axe, O Dear One\! 

//118//

129

like Brahmā, Maheśvar ī carrying Śiva’s \(Mahe ṣ vara’s\) attributes, Vai ṣ ṇav ī 

those of Vi ṣ ṇu, and so on. 

Having thus visualized \[these goddesses\], one must worship them, then \[worship\] Tripurā, mistress of the *cakra* . 

Because she purifi es the organs of action, she is called She Who Accomplishes the Purifi cation of the Hands; //125// and there is found the *siddhi* Aṇimā arising from the purifi cation of the hands. 

*evaṁ dhyatvā yajed etāś cakteś ī ṁ tripurāṁ tata ḥ * / 

*karmendriyāṇāṁ vaimalyātkaraśuddhikar ī smṛ tā * //125// 

*kāryaśuddhibhavā siddhir aṇimā cātra saṁsthitā * / 

The purifi cation of the hands \( *karaśuddhi* \) is a mandatory preliminary ritual, since in order to perform ritual acts of worship of a deity, the hands of the offi

ciant must be perfectly pure. This rite normally 

consists of imposing on the hands the *astra* \(weapon\) mantra. Here it is the Goddess who is symbolically deemed not only to purify but also to cause the *siddhi* goddess Aṇimā to exist. But why Aṇimā? Because, says the D ī , the *siddhi aṇimā* \(and thus the goddess Aṇimā\) reduces the self, the living being \(of the offi

ciating adept\), to its fi nest, most 

subtle state. 

The worship in the second *cakra* , the sixteen-petaled lotus, is then described:

In the group of sixteen vibrations, the *kalās* whose nature is wonder //126// are what animate the sixteen vital breaths, *prāṇa* , etc. 

They are seeds because their nature is that of vowels; they have the form of seeds because they incite. //127// Because they are internal, the Yogin ī s who abide \[there\] are hidden. They are Kāmākar ṣ aṇā, etc. Since they dominate in emanation, O Dear One\! //128// they are to be worshipped \[going from right\] to left in the *cakra* called Sarvāśāpūraṇa. 

*ṣ o ḍ aśaspandasaṁdohe camatkṛ timay ī ḥ kalā ḥ * //126// 

*prāṇādi ṣ o ḍ aśānāṁ tu vāyūnāṁ prāṇanātmikā ḥ * /

*sarvāśapūraṇākhye tu cakre vāmena pūjayet* / 

130

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī



These stanzas must be explained. The Yogin 

ī s that abide in the 

sixteen-petaled lotus of the *śr ī cakra* are identifi ed with an aspect of the cosmic vibration that animates the universe, the *spanda* . This *spanda* is said, in the present case, to be sixteen-fold, being identifi ed with the sixteen “vowels” of the Sanskrit alphabet, which, in Ṣ aiva cosmogonies, are the sixteen *kalās* , limiting energies, of Bhairava when he manifests the cosmos. Their nature is described as “wonder” \( *camatkāra* \), by which is meant that they are pervaded with consciousness \( *cit* \), that is, subtle. They are also identifi ed with the vital breaths, *prāṇa, apāna* , *udāna* , and so on, which, in fact, are usually considered to number only ten, not sixteen: “the names of the six others can be found in other *āgamas* ,” says the D ī , without quoting any reference. These *kalās* , being active, are “seeds” \( *b ī ja* \), 

which is the case of the “vowels.” 41 

The Yogin ī s abiding in this inner portion of the *śr ī cakra* are called Guptayogin ī s \(see above, *śl. * 90\). This, says the D ī , is because they are evolutes that are pervaded with consciousness. They are to be worshipped in the reverse order, starting from the right, not simply because they are Tantric deities but, says the D ī , because they are associated with the emanation that is done by “vomiting” \( *vāmena* ,\) the universe. 

They hold the noose and the goad; they are red and clothed in red. 

//129// The *siddhi* of he who enjoys \[them\] is lightness, made of the purifi cation of the breaths. Tripureś ī , mistress of the \[ *śr ī * \] *cakra* , must be worshipped with all the ritual services. //130// 

*pāśā ṅ kuśadharā hyetā raktā raktāmbarāvṛ tā ḥ * //129// 

*prāṇaśuddhimay ī siddhir laghimā bhoktur ātmana ḥ * / 

*tripureś ī ca cakreś ī pūjyā sarvopacārai ḥ * //130// 

Since the aspect of pure, nondiscursive consciousness pervades this *cakra* , *laghimā* , the supernatural power of lightness \(the *prāṇas* being also purifi ed\), it is, quite naturally, the power deemed to be given by these secret Yogin ī s to the adept who worships them. 

This part of the worship ends with a renewed ritual worship of the main Goddess to which all the prescribed ritual services \( *upacāra* \) are to be off ered. The lists of *upacāras* vary, going from fi ve to thirty-six; they are off erings of lights, incense, food, fl owers, clothes, jewels, and so forth, all that can be off ered to a distinguished guest. In a Tantric context, the variety of the *upacāras* , pure or impure, is very great.

*Encounter in the Worship *

131

Now comes the worship in the third *cakra* , the eight-petaled lotus: Linked to the enjoying 

*purya ṣ ṭ aka* 

absorbed in the experience 

of the body, subtle, associated with the eightfold *vāgbhava* , having for essence the classes of phonemes, //131// all these Yogin ī s, Ana ṅ gakusumā, etc., are very hidden \[and are to be worshipped\] 

in the \[ *cakra* \] Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhana. They are adorned with red cuirasses, //132// beautiful, their braids of hair hanging down, carrying bow and arrows. 

*kaulikānubhavāvi ṣ ṭ abhogapurya ṣ ṭ akāśritā ḥ * /

*ana ṅ gakusumādyās tu raktakañcukaśobhitā ḥ * //132//

*veṇī kṛ talasatkeśās cāpabāṇadharā ḥ śubhā ḥ * / 

The *purya ṣ ṭ aka* , “the eight in the body,” is the subtle transmigrating body, a nonmaterial, all-pervading soul, which, while the person lives, is absorbed in the experience \(the enjoyment, *bhoga* \) of the body it animates. 

The “eightfold *vāgbhava* ” is the phoneme *AI* repeated eight times with the eight Yogin ī s whose essence \( *svarūpa* \) is constituted by the classes \( *varga* \) of consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet. The very hidden \( *guptatara* \) Yogin ī s are one of the several categories of Yogin ī s of the Śr ī vidyā tradition. 

Parameśvar ī , mistress of this *cakra* , is purifi cation of the intellect. 

The quality she possesses is beauty. //133// She rests on the planes of *piṇḍ a* , etc., of the Lord, the subject who enjoys all that can be enjoyed, which is to say, the intellect and the variety of all \[that the intellect perceives\]. //134// Her nature is the supernatural power of growing at will. She must be worshipped with all the ritual off erings and services.

*cakreśvar ī buddhiśuddhirūpā ca parameśvar ī * //134// 

*mahimāsiddhirūpā ca pūjyā sarvopacarākai ḥ * / 

To say that Parameśvar ī is purifi cation of the intellect means that the intellect is purifi ed when it reaches her level. The intellect \( *buddhi* \) is the 

132

plane of consciousness that grasps the objects of the senses whose savor is enjoyed by the supreme subject, Śiva, who, as the D ī says, is therefore called the “knower of the fi eld” \( *k ṣ etrajña* \) of perception. 

The expression “planes of *piṇḍ a* , etc.,” refers to the conception of the subtle body as including four ascending planes called *piṇḍ a* , *pada* , *rūpa* , and *rūpāt ī ta* , planes also conceived of as tiered along the *su ṣ umnā* ; the highest of these, *rūpāt ī ta* , is on the consciousness level of *tur ī ya* , where 

one attains liberation. 42 

To say that the nature \( *rūpa* \) of Parameśvar ī is the supernatural power of growing at will is to say that she bestows that *siddhi* . 

\[This worship is to be performed\] by a penetration, going up to the extreme point of the *visarga* , of consciousness, which fl ashes forth while piercing the twelve knots after experiencing energy. 

//135b–136a// 

*dvādaśagranthibhedena samulasitasaṁvida ḥ * //135// 

*visargāntadaśāveśācchāktānubhavapūrvakam* / 

The D ī explains this obscure stanza as follows. Consciousness here is, in fact, the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , which ascends following the path of the *su ṣ umnā* along which are tiered twelve subtle centres \( *granthi* \) *—* the usual six *cakras* and six “knots” placed between them *—* and goes up to a center called *ṣ o ḍ aśānta* \(“end of sixteen”\), probably to be imagined as sixteen fi ngers-breadths above the head. This ascending energy within the body of the adept, being Consciousness, is luminous; it fl ashes forth. The same movement was described previously in chapter 2, *śl* . 71 of the YH: “Shining like ten million fl ashes of lightning, . . . she attaches herself to the maṇḍ ala of the moon of the inner sky”. This was said above about the inner ascent of the *śr ī vidyā* ; the same experience is taking place here. Here the maṇḍ ala of the moon is not mentioned, but with sixteen being a lunar number, 43 the *ṣ o ḍ aśānta* is also a “lunar” center. This ascent is described as “going up to the *visarga, * ” because the *visarga* is the sixteenth “vowel” of the Sanskrit alphabet; saying *visarga* is therefore equal to saying “sixteen.” 

While performing this worship, the adept is to cause his *kuṇḍ alin ī * to go up to this center. This is one of the cases in which a yogic process is to take place during a ritual action. As we know, in Tantra, yoga and rites cannot be entirely separated; they are two aspects of the total, both bodily and mental, active experience of ritual.

*Encounter in the Worship *

\[The worship is to be done\] with \[what is born\] from the expansion of the energy of awakening, the predominance of the energy of will, 

//136// and with the four phonemes formed by her unifying interaction with *akula* , \[then\] with the phonemes the main of which is *SA* , vapor of the knowable, and with those that are produced by the mixed energy of will, //137// accompanied by the two phonemes 

corresponding to the absorption in the energy of *kula* . \[Thus,\] by the expansion of the essence of the energy, O Maheśvar ī , //138// \[is to be performed\] in the Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka *cakra* \[the worship of the Yogin ī s\] received through traditional transmission. 

*unme ṣ aśaktiprasarair icchāśaktipradhānakai ḥ * //136//

*kulaśaktisamāveśarūpavarṇadvayānvitai ḥ * / 

*śakte ḥ sāramayatvena prasṛ tatvān maheśvari* //138// 

*saṁpradāyakramātās cakre saubhāgyadāyake* / 

The worship, progressing toward the center, is to be done now in the next three *cakras* : the fi rst of fourteen angles and the two others of ten angles. The practice is based on the so-called *bhūtalipi* , the “writing *—*

*lipi—* of the elements,” 44 of forty-two letters. We saw previously the place of yoga in ritual; we see now the role of the letters. The Sanskrit alphabet \(as we have said before\) is divine, appearing fi rst, and being eternally present, in the supreme godhead and thus the source and origin of the whole cosmic manifestation. 

The above stanzas fi rst enumerate the letters of the *bhūtalipi* . These are to be visualized by the adept as present in the so-called *akula* white, thousand-petaled lotus turned downward placed on the *brahmarandhra-cakra* , on the top of the head. There is the fi rst letter of the alphabet, *A* , which is the supreme Śiva. It is in “unifying interaction” \( *saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* \) with the energies of will \( *icchā* , hence *I* \) and of awakening \( *unmeśa* , hence *U* \); we have thus *A \+I = E* , *A \+ U = O. Akula/A* now interacts with *E* and *O* , which gives *AI* and *AU* . The process goes on in the same way in order to produce all forty-two letters of the *bhūtalipi. * The “phonemes of which the main is *SA* ” are the sibilants *ŚA Ṣ A SA* and the aspirate *Ḥ A* , usually called vapor \( *ū ṣ man* \), and so forth. We cannot decrypt here the whole procedure to produce all the letters. 

134

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The last stanza underlines the fact that the expansion of the energy of will \( *icchāśakti* \) realized in the ascent of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * is the eff ective element of this worship of the Yogin ī s present in this *cakra* . These are said to be “received through traditional transmission,” not because they are more received than the other ones by the tradition transmitted by the gurus but because they are called Sampradāyayogin ī s, “traditional Yogin ī s.” 45 

These Yogin ī s are now described:

O goddess\! the \[Yogin ī s\] having at their head Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhiṇī , mag-nifi cent, looking like Aṇimā, \[are those to be worshipped\] in the *cakra* whose name agrees with what it is, by uniting oneself to the force of the beauty that spreads without interruption. //140// The *siddhi* Ī śitva, also, purifi er of the body, the senses, etc., in the triple city already described, to be realized, \[along with\] Tripuravāsin ī , by destroying the original impurity of the conjunction \[with duality\]. //141// All these 

\[deities\], O Goddess, must be worshipped with all the off erings. 

*nirantaraprathārūpasaubhāgyabalayogata ḥ * //139// 

*anvarthasaṁjñake devi aṇimāsadṛ śā ḥ śubhā ḥ * / 

*sarvasaṁk ṣ obhin ī pūrvā dehāk ṣ ādiviśuddhidā * //140// 

*ī śitvasiddhir api ca proktarūpe puratraye* / 

*yogādikleśabhedena siddhā tripuravāsin ī * //141// 

*etā ḥ saṁpūjayed devi sarvā ḥ sarvopacārakai ḥ * / 

The name of the *cakra* is Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka, “the giver of all felicities,” which agrees with its nature, since it is deemed to bestow on the adept all forms of felicity. The Yogin ī s, Sarvasaṁk ṣ obhin ī , and so on, look like Aṇimā, and so on, since, like these, they are clothed in red and bear the same ornaments. The “force of the beauty that spreads without interruption” with which the worshipper is to unite is the power born from the uninterrupted intense meditation on the nonduality from Śiva \( *śivādvaitabhāvanā* \): 46 this mental state is apparently to be maintained by 

the adept during the worship of the Yogin ī s of this *cakra* . 

The Siddhi Ī śitvā, also worshipped there, gives the adept the state of Śiva, which implies, says the D ī , the purifi cation of the body and of the senses of the adept and also of the objects. This threefold purifi cation gives to the adept the state of Ī śvara. To say that it takes place “in the triple city” \( *pūratraye* \) means that “the knower, knowledge, and the known,” 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

135

the perceiving person and what he perceives *—* man and the world he perceives—are “purifi ed,” \(mentally\) deifi ed, understood *sub specie aeternitatis* . 

Worship in the fi fth \(ten-angled\) *cakra* , Sarvārthasādhaka, is as follows:

\[The energy of the Goddess in the fi fth *cakra* \] takes on the nature of the eternal *nādas* abiding in the nine apertures, //142// along with a general and common aspect while being made of distinct 

sounds. \[She is manifested\] by ten phonemes, shadows of the movable and immovable objects of knowledge. //143// They are the 

Kulakaulikāyogin ī s who bestow all the powers or perfections. 

*sadātanānāṁ nādānāṁ navarandhrasthitā ṭ manām* //142// 

*mahāsāmānyarūpeṇa vyāvṛ ttadhvanirūpiṇī * / 

*asthtirasthiravedyānāṁ chāyārūpair daśārṇakai ḥ * //143// 

*kulakaulikayoginya ḥ sarvasiddhipradāyikā ḥ * / 

Here, too, the Yogin ī s to be worshipped are identifi ed with phonetic aspects of the divine energy experienced by the offi

ciant as present in his 

body, a spirit-mind-body experience. 

*Nāda* is a subtle form of sound, a stage in the process of dissolution of uttered sound or phonemes into the silence of the Absolute. It is not audibly perceptible; it is “unstruck,” *anāhata* , sound, being a form of *śabdabrahman* , the cause of the apparition and of the effi

cacy of the phonemes. In spite of this 

unique and absolute nature, *nāda* is sometimes considered divisible, divided in eight, nine, or ten *nādas* , often associated with diff erent parts of the yogic body; such is the case here. The nine apertures \( *randhra* \) are nodal points, *cakras* , of the yogic body. The D ī describes them as parts of the inner space \( *gaganabhāga* \) of the *su ṣ umnā* and enumerates them: “ *mūlādhāra* , *svādhisthāna* , *maṇipūra* , *anāhata* , then above these *vajrapadma* , *kaṇṭ ha* , *laṁbikā* , *vi ṣ uddha* , and *ājñā, * ” of which only the fi rst four and the last three are the usual *cakras* of this system. 

As the D ī also explains, the Goddess, in addition to these “distinct sounds,” is present in the body in a general way as an indistinct sound \( *nirviśe ṣ adhvani* \). 

The ten phonemes that manifest her are the cerebrals and the dentals. They are “shadows” of the various objects of knowledge in that they are deemed to manifest these objects. The long commentary of the D ī on this stanza is rich and interesting but too abstruse to be given here. 



White, clothed in white, wearing white ornaments, //144// 

the \[Kulakaulayogin 

ī s\] Sarvasiddhipradā, etc., are in the 

136

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Sarvārthasādhaka *cakra* , whose name agrees with what it is because of the expansion of the proper nature of the mantras that takes place \[there\]. //145// 

*śvetāmbaradharā ḥ śvetā ḥ śvetābharabhū ṣ itā ḥ * //144// 

*mantrāṇāṁ svaprathārūpayogād anvarthasaṁjñake* / 

*sarvasiddhipradādyās tu cakre sarvārthasādhake* //145// 

The “expansion of the mantras,” according to the D ī , means that they help the offi

ciant to realize that the true nature of his self is the same as that of the “absolute I” of Śiva \( *śivāhambhāvabhāvanā* \). Because such a mystical realization takes place in this *cakra* , it is called Sarvārthasādhaka, “fulfi ller of all wishes,” the highest of which is, of course, the wish for union with Śiva, which is precisely being fulfi lled in this *cakra* \(says the D ī \). 

The Mistress of the *cakra* is Tripurāśr ī , O Great Sovereign\! \[named thus\] because she is the cause of the prosperity of the three worlds. 

In addition, born from the purifi cation of the mantras, //146// it is said \[that she gives\] the power of subjugation. All these \[deities\] 

must be worshipped. 

*lokatrayasamṛ ddh ī nāṁ hetutvāc cakranāyikā * / 

*tripurāśr ī r maheśāni mantraśuddhibhavā puna ḥ * //146// 

*vaśitvasiddhir ākhyātā etā ḥ sarvā ḥ samarcayet* / 

Tripurāśr ī means “prosperity of the three cities,” that is, of the three worlds *—* of the universe, in other words. The purifi cation of the mantras, it is explained, results from the prolongation of their utterance \( *uccāra* \) *—*

in the case of *O Ṃ * , *HR Ī Ṃ , * etc. *—* from the fi nal *Ṃ * to the transmental \( *unmanā* \) plane, where the utterance disappears in the utter silence of the Absolute. If the adept is able to ascend to such a supreme level, he acquires the supernatural power to subjugate all beings \( *ī śitva* \). 

Worship in the sixth \(ten-angled\) *cakra* , Sarvarak ṣ ākara, is as follows: O Goddess\! the phonemes *KA* , etc., as they expand, are manifested by the *kuṇḍ alin ī * facing upward and \[then\] downward //147// when she externalizes herself by the will of Kula. They are manifested by the supreme interior Yogin 

ī s, Sarvajñā, etc., located in the 

Sarvarak ṣ ākara *cakra* , which, being totally absorbed in its own inner 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

137

nature, brings about total absorption. These \[Yogin ī s\] carry a book and a rosary. //148–149// 

*ūrdhvādhomukhayā devi kuṇḍ alinyā prakāśitā ḥ * //147// 

*kulecchayā bahirbhāvāt kādivarṇaprathāmayā ḥ * / 

*nigarbhayogin ī vācyā ḥ svarūpāveśarūpake* //148// 

*sarvāveśakare cakre sarvarak ṣ ākare parā ḥ * / 

*sarvajñādyā ḥ sthitā ḥ etā ḥ saha pustāksamālikā ḥ * //149// 

The divine energy, *kuṇḍ alin ī * , facing fi rst upward, reaches the supreme; then, facing downward, coiling back in the *mūlādhāra* , she manifests the universe through the phonemes *KA* , and so on, the consonants. This she does by the will of Kula, the deity, as identical with the cosmos \(or, as the D ī says, holding in herself the thirty-six *tattvas* , together with the pho-

nemes\). 47 These are manifested by the ten Nigarbha \(“interior”\) Yogin ī s whose names begin always with Sarva, abiding as they do in the *cakra* Sarvarak ṣ ākara \(“causing total protection”\). 

In this *cakra* , the offi

ciant, is supposed to be absorbed in his own nature 

or essence \( *svarūpāveśa* \), thinking, “I am the supreme Śiva.” “Through this absorption,” says the D ī , “the deity shines without duality in the sixth *cakra* , which produces in the worshipper a total absorption in Śiva,” while the *cakra* protects him from everything that could hinder his spiritual search. 

Nourishing the \[three\] cities of the knowing subject, the knowable, and knowledge, the mistress of this *cakra* , magical enchantress of this world, is called Tripurāmālin ī . //150// 

*mātṛ mānaprameyāṇāṁ purāṇāṁ paripo ṣ in ī * / 

*tripurāmālin ī khyātā cakreś ī sarvamohin ī * //150// 

We have already seen the triad of knowing subject, knowledge, and known \( *mātṛ mānaprameya* or *mātṛ * , *māna* , *meya* \) used to designate the totality of the world, which the Goddess both nourishes by her *śakti* and deludes by her *māyā* . 

The supernatural power that is purifi cation of the energy of the *vidyā * is called *prākāmya* . All these goddesses must be worshipped with all the ritual services. //151// 

138

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

*vidyāśaktiviśuddhiṁ ca siddhiṁ prākāmyasaṁjñitām* / 

*etā ḥ sarvopacāreṇa pūjayed devatā ḥ kramāt* //151// 

The energy of the *śr ī vidyā* , says the D ī , is “expressed,” that is, manifested, by her phonemes. It is in reality the power of the all-powerful Supreme Consciousness. The *siddhi* given here is therefore quite naturally *prākāmya* , irresistibility. The adept who acquires it can transform himself or act freely everywhere, like Śiva. 



Now comes the worship in the seventh, eight-triangled 

*cakra* , 

Sarvarogahara, destroyer of all illnesses, with all the mental constructions that go with it:

As the knots open because of the unifying interaction of the vital breaths when becoming immobile, \[the energy\] extending from 

the root- *granthi* to the heart, where consciousness is, as the void subtle transmigrating body, \[one must worship\] the goddesses, the secret Yogin ī s, Vaśin ī , etc., abiding, O Beloved of the heroes, in the Sarvarogahara *cakra* , in the blazing fi re of destruction of the *saṁsāra* , by following the groups of consonants touched by the *kalās* of the vowels, which are seeds. //152–154a// 

*niruddhavāyusaṁgha ṭ ṭ asphu ṭ itagranthimūlata ḥ * / 

*hṛ dayāntarasaṁvittiśūṇya ṣ ṭ akātmanā * //152// 

*b ī jarūpasvarakalāspṛ ṣ ṭ avargānusārata ḥ * / 

*rahasyayogin ī r dev ī ḥ saṁsāradalanojjvale* //153// 

*sarvarogahare cakre saṁsthitā v ī ravandite* / 

The worship in this case consists, for the offi

ciating adept, of mak-

ing his *kuṇḍ alin ī * go up from the “root- *granthi* ,” the *mūlādhāra* , that is, to the heart *cakra* , the *cakras* \(or *granthis* \) between these two points being “opened,” awakened, by the conjunction \( 

*saṁgha ṭ ta* \) *—* which 

consists, in fact, of their immobilization *—* of the *prāṇa* and *apāna* vital breaths. These two breaths stop in the central void of the heart, which is where the subtle transmigrating body \(the *purya ṣ ṭ aka* \) is generally supposed to stay. Therefore, there arises in the adept a subtle, “void” 

state of mind. 

The D ī expresses this as follows: “meditating on \[the *kuṇḍ alin ī * \] as a snake whose brightness is made to palpitate by the syllable *HU Ṃ * , one 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

139

makes it go upward together with the ascent of the breath and the thought. 

Thus, the *kuṇḍ alin ī * rises up from the *mūlādhāra* . As an expert master says: ‘then one must meditate in the lotus of the heart the blazing power of consciousness,’ the adept’s consciousness, blazing in his heart, being the self which is consciousness itself \( *cidātman* \).” 

This mental process also has a phonetic aspect, the Yogin ī s to be worshipped there being associated with the sixteen “vowels,” from *A* to *visarga* \(also called here *kalās* \) associated with the groups \( *varga* \) of consonants, *KA* , *CA* , and so on, these syllables being what brings about the presence of the secret *—* Gupta *—* Yogin ī s who are to be worshipped. Their subtlety, says the D ī , explains why they are in the Sarvarogahara *cakra* where the fi re of cosmic destruction is deemed to be present, its fi re being able to destroy the “illness” \( *roga* \) of the *saṁsāra* , “impermanent, stained, and impure.” 

The Yogin ī s endowed with supernatural powers, Vaśin ī , and so forth, are red in color, \[their hands\] forming the gesture of protection and of reassurance and holding the book and the rosary. 

//154b–155a// 

The *siddhis* 

of enjoyment and the 

*siddhi* 

of pure knowledge, 

O Maheśvar ī , //155// \[and\] Tripurasiddhi, mistress \[of this *cakra* , all these deities\] are to be worshipped by the off ering of drops \[of *arghya* \]. 

*vaśinyādyā ḥ raktavarṇā varadābhayamudritā ḥ * //154// 

*pustakaṁ japamālāṁ ca dadhānā ḥ siddhayogin ī ḥ * / 

*śuddhavidyāviśuddhiṁ ca bhuktisiddhiṁ maheśvari* //155// 

*ī śvar ī ṁ tripurāsiddhim pūjayed bindutarpaṇai ḥ * / 

Pure knowledge \( *śuddhavidyā* \), says the D ī , is the consciousness of the nonduality of the subject and the object: all is pure, unique, divine Consciousness. The realization of the nonduality of consciousness \( *saṁvidadvaita* \), of the nonduality with Śiva, is the highest, liberating knowledge. “Thus, the supernatural power of enjoyment \[ *bhukti* \] is the great power to enjoy the whole diversity of the world gained by the adept when worshipping in this seventh *cakra* .” This he does, adds the D ī , “by off ering drops of *arghya* , together with unhusked grains of barley corn \( *ak ṣ ata* \) and fl owers, with the *mudrā * of union of Śiva and Śakti made by joining the thumb and the little fi nger.” 

140

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The *pūjā* in the eighth \(three-angled\), Sarvasiddhimāyā, *cakra* is now described:

O Goddess\! \[the Yogin ī \] whose nature is that of the three energies, auspicious, splendid, and powerful fl ow of consciousness, 

//156// forms of the fi re of cosmic destruction, supremely secret, are the cause of the supernatural power whose nature is fullness and nonfullness, O Sureśvar ī \! In the *cakra* called Sarvasiddhimaya, adorned by the divine weapons, are the four deities of the *p ī ṭ has* with Kāmeśvar ī at their head. //158// 

*śaktitrayātmikā devi ciddhāmaprasarā ḥ śivā ḥ * //156// 

*saṁvartāgnikalārūpā ḥ paramātirahasyakā ḥ * / 

*pūrṇāpūrṇasvarūpāyā ḥ siddher hetu ḥ sureśvari* //157// 

*sarvasiddhimayākhye tu cakre tvāyudhabhū ṣ ite* / 

*sthitā ḥ kāmeśvar ī pūrvāś catasra ḥ p ī ṭ hadevatā ḥ * //158// 

The deities in this *cakra* are, by their nature, nearer to the Goddess than the Yogin ī s we saw previously. They are more important ones. 

The three energies are the three basic energies of Śiva: will, knowledge, and action \( *icchā* , *jnāna* , *kriyā* \). Consciousness, says the D ī , is the Supreme Consciousness named Ambikā, the Mother; her splendor \( *dhāman* \) is made of light rays \( *kiraṇa* \) whose expansion \( *prasara* \) is the cosmic vibration \( *spanda* \) produced by the three regents of the cosmos identifi ed here with the three energy goddesses Vāmā, Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and Raudr ī . The four regents of the ages of the world \(the *yuganāthas* \) are also there. 



All these entities form the fi rst circle of deities surrounding the Goddess. They are said to be forms of the fi re of destruction \( *saṁvartāgni* \), for when one approaches the Goddess, the world tends to disappear. The power they bestow is fullness, because it is the complete absorption \( *samāveśa* \) in the supreme Śiva. It is also nonfullness, because it includes the totality of the cosmic manifestation. The Siddhi present here, having these two aspects, gives liberation in life \( *j ī vanmukti* \). 

The *p ī ṭ has* are the four sacred seats of the Goddess, the ritual and spiritual \(more or less mythical\) centers of this tradition. They are Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and O ḍ ḍ ī yāna, as we have already seen. 48 Kāmeśvar ī 

is the fi rst of a group of four goddesses; the three others are Vajreśvar ī , 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

141

Bhagamālin ī , and Tripurasundar ī . Only the fi rst three are in this *cakra* , Tripurasundar ī residing in the next, central, *cakra* . 

As for the weapon deities, shining with an intense red brilliance, each carrying its weapon on its head, their hands making the gesture of reassurance and protection, they are to be worshipped. 

They give the fruit desired by those who visualize them in meditation. //159// They are yours and mine and bestow power on men 

and women. 

*āyudhās tvatiraktābhā ḥ svāyudhojjvalamastakā ḥ * / 

*varadābhayahastāśca pūjyā dhyātṛ phalapradā ḥ * //159// 

*tvad ī yāśca mad ī yāś ca puṁstr ī vaśyavidhāyina ḥ * / 

All Tantric deities are represented as holding in their hands objects called weapons \( *āyudha* \), which are sometimes arms \(bow and arrows, for instance\), sometimes tools \(such as a goad\) or various symbolic objects. 

Although objects, *āyudhas* , being elements of a divine fi gure, are considered deities, *devatās* , and may in such cases be represented \(or, as is the case here, be visualized by *dhyāna* \) as human fi gures bearing their “weapons” on their heads. They are then to be worshipped as deities, bestowing boons on their worshipper. They can also be associated with phonemes or mantras. 

O Sureśvar ī \! these arrows of yours are associated with the second vowel, their nature being that of \[the constituent elements of the body,\] skin, blood, fl esh, fat, and with what follows bone and marrow. //160b–161a// 

*tvaga ṣ ṛ ṇmāṁsamedo ‘sthimajjārṇāntā ḥ sureśvari* //160// 

*dvit ī yasvarasaṁyuktā ete bāṇās tvād ī yakā ḥ * / 

We are to understand here that the arrows are associated with the mantras of the *dhātus* , the constituent elements of the body, which are formed by the second vowel, *Ā* , of the Sanskrit alphabet and by one of fi ve consonants and ending with *Ṃ * . These consonants are the four semivowels, *YA* for the skin, *RA* for the blood, *LA* for the fl esh, *VA* for fat, and “what follows bone and marrow,” which is *SA* , for semen, which is designated in this way because, in the lists of the *dhātus* , *semen* \( *śukra* \) usually follows bone and marrow. The mantras of the fi ve arrows to be used in the 

142

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

worship to invoke them are \(as given in the D ī \): *YĀ Ṃ * , *RĀ Ṃ * , *LĀ Ṃ * , *VĀ Ṃ * , and *SĀ Ṃ * . 

\[The Mistress of this *cakra* is\] Tripurāmbikā, who generates the three cities Vāmā, etc., //161// These \[deities\], O Lovely-faced Woman, are to be worshipped with all the ritual off erings and services. \[They bestow\] the supernatural power of unlimited will because their 

nature is that of supreme freedom. //162// 

*vāmād ī nāṁ purāṇāṁ tu janan ī tripurāmbikā * //161// 

*parasvātantryarūpatvād icchāsiddhir maheśvari* / 

*etā ḥ sarvopacāreṇa pūjayet tu varānane* //162// 



Vāmā is one of the three main goddesses surrounding 

Tripurasundar ī : Vāmā, Jye ṣ ṭ hā, and Raudr ī . They are called “cities” probably because they are near Tripurasundar ī , the “Beautiful \[Mistress\] of the Three Cities.” The D ī , however, says that it is because they are presided over by Kāme ṣ var ī , whose nature is that of the three basic energies, *icchā* , *jñāna* , and *kriyā* . 

Then comes the worship in the ninth, central, *cakra* :

In the supreme Sarvānandamaya *cakra* , O Goddess, whose nature is that of the supreme *brahman* , one must worship with all freedom of practice Mahātripurasundar ī , \[supreme\] consciousness, who is both egoity and objectivity. She is the great Kāmakalā. She gives the supernatural power of \[attaining\], the *vidyā* , the *p ī ṭ has* , and so forth. 

//163–164//. \[This\] goddess, the great *mudrā* , must be worshipped.

*mahāmudrāmay ī dev ī pūjyā* 

That the supreme Goddess should be *parabrahman* and consciousness goes without saying. The D ī adds, however, that she is, for the worshipper, the goddess of his own consciousness \( *svasaṁviddevatā* \), underlining thus the *saṁvidadvaita* \(the “nonduality of consciousness”\) conception of the Trika: that there is only one conscious principle, Śiva, of which the 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

143

individual consciousnesses of human beings are merely aspects. It is in this respect that she is equally *ahantā * and *idanta* , both the absolute pure I and the multiplicity of the objective world. 

Tripurasundar ī is also “the great Kāmakalā.” This refers to the *kāmakalā* 

diagram, symbolizing the union of Śiva and Śakti, which we have already seen in chapter 2, *śl* . 21. 

She is to be worshipped with all freedom of practice \( *svairācāreṇa* \), that is, says the D ī , “with elements pleasing to the senses and whose nature is what the worshipper desires,” a practice, it adds, characterized by an intense one-pointed mental concentration on the blazing pulsation \( *pari-sphurat paramānusaṁdhāna* \) of the supreme. Tantric worship, as we have already seen, implies the total mental and bodily, intensely lived participation of the offi

ciant in the ritual action. The D ī quotes here stanza 74 of 

the *Vijñānabhairava* : “Wherever the mind of the individual fi nds satisfaction, on this supreme point the mind is to be fi rmly concentrated, for the supreme bliss shines intensely there.” 

The *siddhi* gained here is *prāpti* , the power to attain everything. Here it is the power to realize the nature of the *śr ī vidyā* , to reach \(symbolically\) the four *p ī ṭ has* of the Śrividyā tradition, and to unite with the four deities, Kāmeśvar ī , and so on, all of which gives the adept the power to rest in the supreme, on the plane “beyond the fourth” \( *turyāt ī ta* \) 49 *—* and therefore to be omnipotent, like Śiva. 

The great *mudrā* is the *yonimudrā* , which is in this *cakra* because it is a triangle, the triangle being the usual symbolic representation of the feminine sexual organ, the *yoni* . We have seen the *yonimudrā* in chapter 1, *śl* . 70b–71a. 

Made up of fi fteen \[syllables\] and as many *tithis* , eternal, she is the ninth supreme Bhairav ī //165// \[to be worshipped in\] each *cakra* , together with the *mudrās* described in the \[fi rst chapter\] “Encounter in the *cakra* .” 

* pañcadaśātmikā*

*tattattithimay ī nityā navam ī bhairav ī parā * //165// 

*praticakraṁ samudrās tu cakrasaṁketakoditā ḥ * / 

The Goddess is said to be made up of fi fteen syllables, because the *sr ī vidyā* of fi fteen syllables is herself in her mantric aspect. She is also made up of the *tithis* , the fi fteen lunar days, because they form together the whole moon, another totality. In fact, the number of the totality \(and of the moon\) is not fi fteen but sixteen. The D ī explains, therefore, that 

144

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

if one adds to the fi fteen *tithis* or syllables of the *śr ī vidyā * the *ṣ r ī vidya* as a whole, taken as a unit, one has 15 \+ 1 = 16. The *mūlavidyā * worshipped in this central triangle is thus seen as made up of her separate syllables plus their ensemble, thus being sixteenfold. 

The Goddess is to be worshipped also in the whole *śr ī cakra* , since she pervades it entirely. 

The worship in the nine *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* ends with another ritual worship:



The sage must perform a sacrifi ce to Nityaklinnā, etc., using 

optional rites, //166// either in the triangle or in the intermediate space of the square. 

*nityaklinnādikāś caiva kāmyakarmānusārata ḥ * //166// 

*caturasrāntarāle vā trikoṇe vā yajet sudh ī ḥ * / 

Nityaklinnā is placed on the left side of the central triangle between two other goddesses, Kāmeśvar ī and Bhagamālin ī . The other goddesses of the inner retinue of Tripurasundar ī \(meant by “etc.”\) are thirteen Nityās. 50 They are to be worshipped either in the central triangle or on the sixteen-petaled lotus, meant here by “the intermediate space of the square.” 

The use of so-called optional rites \( *kāmyakarmaṇi* \), that is, rites undertaken to attain a desired object, is normal in the present Tantric context, since the worship of all these deities gives *siddhis* , which are desired \( *kāmya* \) by the adept. The D ī describes these rites as consisting of “fl owers, visualizing meditation \[ *dhyāna* \], syllables, etc., adapted to such optional rites as subjugation, etc.” The next stanza is more explicit:

Having honored the deities with alcohol, pieces of cooked meat, perfumes, and incense, //167// the worship of the *cakra* is thus accomplished. \[The offi

ciating adept\] must \[then\] off er the lamp of 

*kula* , blazing with its own splendor, shining forth internally and externally, O Dear One\! //168// 

*alinā piśitair gandhair dhūpair ārādhya devatā ḥ * //167// 

*cakrapūjāṁ vidhāyetthaṁ kulad ī paṁ nivedayet* / 

*antarbahirbhāsamānaṁ svaprakāśojjvalaṁ priye* //168// 

The term we give here in English as “alcohol” is *hetu* , which means 

“cause.” It is one of the several terms used to mean an alcoholic beverage without mentioning it explicitly. 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

145

The off ering of lights to the deity is the waving of lights in front of the image, which is a part of all *pūjās* \(called *arati* , it is nowadays often its main, if not its sole, part\). 



This action is here metaphysically interpreted, 

*kula* 

being, as we 

have seen, one of the terms used to mean the body, whether cosmic or human. *Kula* , says the D ī , is “the body made of the thirty-six *tattvas* ”, in other words, the whole world, which is thus symbolically off ered to the Goddess. But the D ī also interprets this as follows: this lamp “is the dynamism of consciousness shining in the lotus of the heart and which, through the senses, shines in the same way in all objects.” “This lamp it adds, “shines by its own light, which is the direct intuitive perception of the supreme reality,” the act of off ering being, for the adept, “the inner quiescent tranquillity \[ *viśrānti* \] in consciousness that he experiences when turning inward.” 

Now comes the last rite of this *pūjā* , the *japa* . 

* Japa * 

The *japa* is the mandatory penultimate act of all *pūjās* \(normally, but not here, followed by an off ering in the sacrifi cial fi re, a *homa* \). 

It consists of reciting a more or less large number of times the root mantra, the *mūlamantra* , of the deity being worshipped. This is, however, not the case here, for this *japa* is, in fact, a long and complex meditative and yogic practice in which the enunciation 

\( *uccāra* \) of the *śr ī vidyā* , associated with the ascent of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , is accompanied by mental visualizations of elements of the *śr ī vidyā* 

imagined \(and, to a certain extent, experienced\) as taking place in the yogic body of the adept together with the ascent of *kuṇḍ alin ī * . 

We have described its general pattern above in the introduction. 

Here we will follow, with the help of the D ī , the details of the process as described \(or alluded to\) in stanzas 169b–189a. \(See table 3.1.\) 

Then, having done the *añjali* with fl owers, he must practice *japa* with a composed and steady mind. //169a// 

*pu ṣ pajlaliṁ tata ḥ kṛ tvā japaṁ kuryāt samāhita ḥ * / 

O Great Goddess\! \[The *japa* consists of \] the conjunction of the *cakras* placed one above the other \[realized\] by the *nāda* in the three *kū ṭ as* and the threefold *kuṇḍ alin ī * . //169b–170a//

In these \[ *kū ṭ as* \] are the phonemes *prāṇa* , *agni* , and *māyā* , followed by the *kalās: * *bindu* , *ardhacandra* , *rodhin ī * , *nāda* , *nādānta* , *śakti* , accompanied by *vyāpikā* , *samanā* , and *unmanā* , who are in the *dvādaśānta* , O Dear One. //171// Then, for \[the *kū ṭ a* \] whose nature is the root *kuṇḍ alin ī * , and for the middle one, turned \[the fi rst\] toward emanation, \[the second\] toward the resorption of the cosmos, O Maheśvar ī \! 

//172// The conjunction \[goes on\] rising higher and higher only as the subtle *nāda* . In the modifi ed third \[ *kū ṭ a* \], O Goddess, the twelfth *kalā * \[is enunciated\]. //173//

*kevalaṁ nādarūpeṇa uttarottarayojanaṁ * / 

*śabalākārake devi tṛ t ī ye dvādaś ī kalā * //173// 

This fi rst part of the *japa* is to proceed as follows: The adept is to imagine that along his *su ṣ umnā* are tiered the nine constituent *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* \(from its square outside part to the central triangle\), each associated with one of the nine *cakras* of his yogic imaginal body, from the *mūlādhāra* to the *dvādaśānta* . Going upward along this axis, the *kuṇḍ alin ī * is conceived of as being threefold. Its lower part, from *mūlādhāra* 

to the heart 

*cakra* \( *hṛ daya* or *anāhata* \), is the so-called *agnikuṇḍ alin ī * ; it is fi ery and associated with emanation, *sṛ ṣ ṭ i* . Then, from heart to *bhrūmadhya* \(the *cakra* between the eyebrows, also called *bindu* or *ājñā* \), extends the *sūryakuṇḍ alin ī * , which is solar and associated with conservation, *sthiti* . Third, from *bhrūmadhya* to *dvādaśānta* , rises the *somakuṇḍ alin ī * , which is lunar and linked to resorption, *saṁhāra* . 

This conception of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * as in three sections that have respectively the nature of fi re, sun, and moon is found in several Tantric Śaiva texts. Its point seems to be to give a cosmic dimension to the ascent of the *kuṇḍ alin ī * . 

148

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

Now the adept is to imagine that in the *mūlādhāra* lies the fi rst part, or *kū ṭ a* , of the *ṣ r ī vidyā* , *HA SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ * . Then, in the heart *cakra* , is the second *kū ṭ a* , *HA SA KA HA LA HR Ī Ṃ * ; and in the *bhrūmadhyā* is the third *kū ṭ ā* , *SA KA LA HR Ī Ṃ * . The enunciation of these three *HR Ī Ṃ * , like that of all *b ī jas* ending with *Ṃ * \( *bindu* \), is deemed \(as said in *śl. * 170\) to be prolonged by a subtle phonic vibration, the *nāda* , which goes through eight ever subtler phonic stages, the so-called *kalā ṣ * , named *ardhacandra* , *rodhin ī * , *nāda* , *nādānta* , *śakti* , *vyāpin ī * , *samanā* , and *umanā* , with the last, 

“transmental,” *kalā* , which fi nally dissolves in the silence of the Absolute. 

This being so, the *japa* consists, for the offi

ciant, of the mental enun-

ciation \( *uccāra* \) of the three *kū ṭ as* of the *śrividyā* , enunciating fi rst their letters, from *SA* or *HA* to the *bindu* , *Ṃ * , then prolonging the *uccāra* of *Ṃ * by the eight *kalās* , from *ardhacandra* to *samanā* , this subtle vibration ascending for the fi rst *kū ṭ a* from *mūlādhāra* to the heart, for the second *kū ṭ * a from the heart to the *bhrūmadhya, * and for the third *kū ṭ a* from *bhrūmadhya* to the *dvādaśānta* , where it reaches its ultimate form, *unmanā* , the “transmental.” This it does, however, together with the *unmanās* of the two fi rst *HR Ī Ṃ * , with which it intermingles \(this is why it is called “modifi ed” in *ṣ l* . 173b\). There the phonic vibration unites with and disappears in the Absolute. The *kalās* are said by the YH to number twelve, because one is to add to the eight subtle ones, *ardhacandra* to *unmanā* , the four elements that constitute *HR Ī Ṃ * : *H R Ī * \+ *bindu* . 

This *japa* is thus not a recitation but a purely mental mantric utterance \( *mantroccāra* \), conceived by the adept as carrying upward the three parts of the *śr ī vidyā* , through the *cakras* of his yogic body united with the constitutive parts of the *śr ī cakra* , with the *kuṇḍ alin ī * and with his mind, to the highest level of sound vibration, where it merges in Mahātripurasundar ī , supreme Consciousness. It is a complex, both visual and phonic-mental, process. It is a mental process, we note, that also has a cosmic dimension, since, as it unfolds from distinct syllables to *unmanā* , it includes, with the three 

*kū ṭ as* 

, the whole cosmic process, from emanation to 

resorption, a process parallel to, isomorphic with, the phonic one, which goes from distinct sound to the silence of the Absolute and, implicitly, from ordinary waking awareness \( *jāgrat* \) to the supreme nondualistic *turyāt ī ta* state of mind. This *japa* , therefore, if eff ectively carried out, requires an extremely intense and diffi

cult mental/spiritual exercise in 

creative imagination. 

This, however, is only the fi rst part of the *japa* ; three other *japas* are now prescribed. 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

149

One must perform the *japa* mentally while meditating on the sixfold emptiness, O Goddess, the fi ve conditions of the mind, and the seven equalizations. //174// 

*śūnya ṣ a ṭ kaṁ tathā devi hyavasthāpañcakaṁ puna ḥ * / 

*vi ṣ uvaṁ saptarūpaṁ ca bhāvayan manasā japet* //174// 

These entities *—* the six emptinesses \( *śūṇya* \), the fi ve states or conditions \( *avasthā* \) of the mind, and the seven *vi ṣ uvat* \(a term we translate as 

“equalization”\), says the D ī , are to be meditatively realized \( *bhāvayet* \) in the constitutive elements of the *śr ī vidyā* of which this is therefore a *japa—*

of a particular sort. 

Dividing into groups of three \[the *kalās* of the *uccāra* \] from *agni* to the *dvādaśānta* , O Fair-Faced Woman\! one will give birth to the threefold emptiness, each \[of the emptinesses\] being in the interval between each \[of the groups of three\], O Dear One\! //175// In the supreme abode, beyond the threefold emptiness, one is to meditate on the great emptiness. 

*agnyādidvādaśānte ṣ u tr ī ṁstr ī ṇtyaktvā varānane* / 

*śūnyatrayaṁ vijān ī yād ekaikāntara ḥ priye* //175// 

*śūnyatrayāt pare sthāne mahāśūnyaṁ vibhāvayet* / 

Although called “threefold” \( *śūṇyatrayam* \), there are six emptinesses. 

They are linked to the ascending enunciation \( *uccāra* \) of *HR Ī Ṃ —* its letters, then its *kalās—* the *śūṇyas* being imagined as nodal points placed on the level of a *kalā* between two others, beginning with the *R* of *HR Ī Ṃ *

\(called *agni* , since *RA* is the *b ī ja* of fi re\) and ending on the level of *unmanā* , which is in the *dvādaśānta* , as shown in table 3.1 above. 

The offi

ciating adept is apparently to meditate intensely on these imaginary points. The D ī explains that he is to see in his mind the *śūṇyas* looking like “the multicolored circles adorning the feathers of a peacock,” for which it quotes sūtra 32 of the *Vijñānabhairava* : “If one meditates on the fi ve voids \[using as support\] the multicolored circles adorning the feathers of a peacock, one penetrates in the heart, supreme void.” 

The D ī also quotes part of stanza 41 of the same text: “he will be absorbed in the marvelous ether of consciousness.” 

The fi rst line of *śl* . 175 implies that there is a still higher, “emptier” level of emptiness, above the sixth one. 

150

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The YH then explains the meditation on the fi ve conditions of the mind, the *avasthas* : waking \( *jāgrat* \), dream \( *svapna* \), deep sleep \( *su ṣ upti* \), the “fourth” \( *turya* \) state, and the one “above the fourth” \( *turyāt ī ta* \): The meditative realization of the waking senses, then, \[must be done\] through the state of waking, //176// in the fi re, O Goddess, a state of great wakefulness, together with the two \[categories of \] 

faculties. 

*prabodhakaraṇasyā ‘thā jāgaratvena bhāvanam* //176// 

*vahnau devi mahājāgradavasthā tvindriyadvayai ḥ * / 

The two categories of faculties are the fi ve organs or faculties of apperception \( *jñānendriya* or *buddh ī ndriya* \), sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and the fi ve senses of action \( *karmendriya* \) corresponding to the functions of speaking, holding, walking, excreting, and copulating. These two categories correspond to two groups of *tattvas* in the classifi cation of the Sāṁkhya, categories that are active in the waking state. A meditative realization, an inner experience of the plane of consciousness corresponding to these sense experiences or activities is probably what the adept is supposed to have in this part of the *japa* . 

The meditative realization of the great wakefulness is to take place “in the fi re” \( *vahnau* \), which is to say, the D ī explains, “in the letter *RA* present on the tip of the third *b ī ja* ,” 51 that is, in the  *R* of the *HR Ī Ṃ * of the third *kū ṭ a* of the *śr ī vidyā—* something we may fi nd diffi

cult to visualize but which is 

important, since there is no *japa* without \(at least a part of\) a mantra. 

Since there are fi ve ascending conditions of the mind, the meditative process of the *japa* goes on as follows:

\[Linked\] to the internal organs is the dream state revealed by *māyā *

//177// in the region of the throat. 

*āntarai ḥ karaṇair eva svapno māyāvabodhana ḥ * //177// 

*galadeśe* 

The state of dream \( *svapna* \) is defi ned by the D ī as the condition of the knowing subject \( *pramātṛ * \) 52 when his mental activity is separated from 

the senses of action and linked to the internal organs. The internal organ, the *anta ḥ karaṇa* , is made up of the three *tattvas* between the senses of apperception and *prakṛti* , namely the mind \( *manas* \), the principle of the 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

151

ego \( *ahaṁkāra* \), and the intellect \( *buddhi* \). These are “revealed by *māyā* in the region of the heart,” which is, says the D ī , by the letter  *Ī * 53 of *HR Ī Ṃ * to be felt and meditated as present in the region of the heart, which is the 

“region of dream” \( *svapnasya sthānam* \). 

*Su ṣ upti* is the perception of what was previously dissolved with the dissolution of the domain of the movements of the internal organ. 

//178// \[The meditation bears here\] on the preceding phonemes taken in the reverse order. It takes place on the *bindu* , between the eyebrows. 

*su ṣ uptis tu l ī napūrvasya vedanam* / 

*anta ḥ karaṇavṛ tt ī nāṁ layato vi ṣ ayasya tu* //178// 

*pūrvārṇānāṁ vilomena bhrūmadhye bindusaṁsthitā * / 

*Su ṣ upti* is the state of deep sleep, where no dream appears. All mental activities stop there, because the movements of the internal organ, the *anta ḥ karaṇa* , of which one was conscious in the previous, dream state, have now disappeared. In this state, one is intensely conscious \( *parāmṛ śyate* \) only of one’s self \( *svātma* \) and of happiness \( *sukha* \), says the D ī . 

As for the *japa* to be done here, it would consist of meditating on the syllables of the central *kū ṭ a* of the *śr ī vidyā* , the *śaktib ī ja* , taking them in reverse order, *LA KA SA* , these phonemes being meditated, visualized as being “on the *bindu* placed on the *hṛ llekhā* \(on the *Ṃ * of the *HR Ī Ṃ * , that is\) which is in the *bhrūmadhyacakra* ” *—* the *HR Ī Ṃ * would thus be imagined as placed there, between the eyebrows. This part of the *japa* , like the others, is a yogic practice based on the structure of the mental image of the yogic body. 

\[The meditation\] of *turya* is the grouping together there of the half-circle, etc. //179// Being the cause of the manifestation of consciousness, \[this state\] is knowledge of the nature of the *nāda. * 

*turyarūpaṁ tasya cātra vṛ ttārdhades saṁgraha ḥ * //179// 

*caitanyavyaktihetos tu nādarūpasya vedanam* / 

*Turya* , the fourth condition of the mind, is above the three normal states of consciousness, being considered their cause. It is not merely peaceful but dynamic. In its *bhāvanā* , says the D ī , there appears an intense awareness \( *parāmarśa* \) of the phonic vibration, the *nāda* , of the *śr ī vidyā * on the three levels of the *uccāra* following *bindu* : *ardhacandra* \(the “half-circle”\), *rodhin ī * , and *nādānta* , these three *kalās* being considered as together “on 

152

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

the apex of the third *b ī ja. * ” What the adept is to realize there, we are told, is the inciting \( *kalana* \) nature, the dynamism, of the *nāda* , which causes the 

apparition of a pure consciousness of the self. 54 

*Turyāt ī ta* , O Dear one, is a state of happiness. It is on the level of *nādānta* and what follows it. //181// In that very place, the awakened must, during the time of *japa* , remember the fi ve conditions of the mind. 

*turyāt ī taṁ sukhasthānaṁ nādāntādisthitaṁ priye* //180// 

*atraiva japakāle tu pañcāvasthā ḥ smared budha ḥ * / 

The D ī defi nes the essence of the condition of *turyāt ī ta* as supreme bliss transcending word and thought \( *manovāgat ī taparamānanda* \), which is, however, to be experienced on the level of *nādānta* , *śakti* , *vyapin ī * , *samanā* , and *unmanā* , which are the “region of happiness” \( *sukhasthānam* \). This 

“remembrance” 55 is to take place “in that very place,” which \(according to 

the D ī \) is to be understood “in the *śaktib ī ja* ,” the third *kū ṭ a* of the *śr ī vidyā* . 

“He must remember” \( *smaret* \) is taken as the equivalent of *bhavayet* : he must meditate intensely. 56 

Another series of *japa* follows now, that of the seven *vi ṣ uvas* . There is no satisfactory translation of the term *vi ṣ uva* because of our uncertainty about what the term designates. In astronomy, it is the equinox. More generally, it means a central or middle point, a point of equality or equalization, equilibrium. Here it evokes a point of equilibrium or equalization between the *prāṇa* , or *nāda* , of the mantra and some other element brought into play by the *japa* . With each of these *japas* , the adept would experience in mind and body a particular union with the phonic vibration, the *nāda* , of the *śr ī vidyā* 

and would thus progress toward union with the supreme. 

The *vi ṣ uva* named *prāṇa* is the union of breath, the self, and the mind. //181// 

*yogaḥ prāṇātmamanasāṁ vi ṣ uvaṁ prāṇasaṁjñakam* //181// 

This description of the *prāṇavi ṣ uva* is clear enough, but neither the YH 

nor the D ī explains how this union is realized or the role the *vidyā * may play in this practice. 

Knowing that what assumes the form of the self is dissolved in the *nāda* which rises from the \[ *mūl* \] *ādhāra* , conjoining and disjoining 

* *

153

the phonemes of the mantra, O Maheśvar ī , //182// \[then\] perceiving that what has the nature of *nāda* 57 \[rises\] from the *anāhata* to the ultimate \[ *cakra* , this is the *mantra* \] *vi ṣ uva. *

*vi ṣ uvam* 

“What assumes the form of the self” is the divine Consciousness. This Consciousness, assuming the form of the consciousness of the adept, is to be imagined as dissolved in the phonic vibration, the *nāda* , which rises from the *mūlādhāra* up to the *brahmarandhra* , a movement during which it is associated with the three parts of the *śr ī vidyā* , fi rst taken separately, then taken together, and, in this case, considered as rising from the *anāhata* , the *cakra* of the heart, to the highest *cakra* . This is done, says the D ī , “enunciating up to the heart the *nāda* present on the apex of the *vāgbhava* \(the third *kū ṭ a* \) which is in the *mūlādhāra* , and dissolving there. The spiritual experience the adept has by one-pointed attention \( *anusaṁdhāna* \) is that the real nature of his self is divine; such is the *mantravi ṣ uva* .” 

What is called *nā ḍ ī vi ṣ uva* is produced by the phoneme when the twelve *granthis* are pierced inside the *nā ḍ ī * in conjunction with the *nāda* , O Dear One\! //183b–184a// 

*nādasaṁsparśān nā ḍ ī vi ṣ uvam ucyate* //183// 

*dvādaśagranthibhedena varṇād nāḍyantare priye* / 

The phoneme \( *varṇa* \), says the D ī , is the *kāmakalā ak ṣ ara—* the letter *Ī —* present on the apex of the three *kū ṭ as* , the letter *Ī * , that is, of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * of the *śr ī vidyā* . This phoneme is to pierce the twelve *granthis* , the 

“knots,” namely the six *cakras* , from *mūlādhāra* to *brahmarandhra* and six intermediary knots, tiered along the *su ṣ umnā nā ḍ ī * . This ascending movement is associated with the equally ascending subtle phonic vibration, the *nāda* , of the three *HR Ī Ṃ * , as we have seen in the fi rst *japa. * ; It is, in fact, practically the same mental yogic practice, with the same spiritual eff ect. 

Conjunction with the *nāda* , the *praśānta* \[ *vi ṣ uva* \] falls within the range of the appeased senses. //184// One is to meditate the fi re,

*māyā* and *kalā* , *cetanā* , *ardhacandra* , *rodhin* ī , *nāda* and *nādānta* dissolved in *śakti* . //185// 

*nādayoga ḥ praśāntaṁ tu praśāntendriyagocaram* //184// 

*vahniṁ māyāṁ kalāṁ caiva cetanāṁ ardhacandrakam* / 

*rodhin ī nādanādāntān śaktau l ī nāṇvibhāvayet* //185// 

“The fi re is the letter *RA* , *māyā * is *Ī * , and *kalā* is the half- *kalā* following *SA* placed in the middle of this letter \[ *Ī * \] which has the shape of a line. 58  *Cetanā * is the *bindu* which is the inner impulsion of consciousness \[ *caitanya* \]. As for *ardhacandra* , *rodhin ī * , etc., they are to be meditated on, being dissolved in *śakti* , as previously described,” 59 says the D ī . This is, it adds, because the energy here is the energy of the offi

ciant who thus feels appeased as he evokes mentally 

this ascent of the phonic *kalās* of *HR Ī Ṃ * along the way of the *kuṇḍ alin ī . * 

The *vi ṣ uva* named *śakti* is above her. \[It consists of \] applying one’s thought to the *nāda* . Still above this is the *kālavi ṣ uva* , which extends up to *unmanā* , O Maheśvar ī \! //186// The perception of the *nāda* 

\[lasts\] *muni* , *candra* , eight and ten *tu ṭ is* . 

*vi ṣ uvaṁ śaktisaṁjñaṁ tu tadūrdhvaṁ nādacintanam* / 

*tadūrdhvaṁ kālavi ṣ uvam unmanāntaṁ maheśvari* //186//

*municandrāṣṭadaśabhis tuṭibhir nādavedanam *

The *śaktivi ṣ uva* is “above *śakti* ” because it is to be meditated as extending up to the *samanā kalā. * The *kālavi ṣ uva* , the *vi ṣ uva* of time, is still above it, since the adept is to consider its meditation as reaching the supreme level of *unmanā* , which transcends time. 

The D ī explains that *muni* means seven, and *candra* means one. If one adds eight and ten, the length of the *uccāra* of the *vidyā* from the *HA* of *HR Ī Ṃ * to *unmanā* would be ten thousand eight hundred seventeen *tu ṭ is* , a *tu ṭ i* being an extremely small division of time; it is described in a text quoted by the D ī as a hundredth part of the twinkling of the eye. 

The equalization which is the cause of the manifestation of consciousness is called *tattva* \[ *vi ṣ uva* \]. //187// 

*caitanyavyaktihetuśca vi ṣ uvaṁ tattvasaṁjñakam* //187// 

This *vi ṣ uva* 

is described in the D 

ī as the one-pointed attention 

\( *anusaṁdhāna* \) to one’s own self resulting from the dissolution of the 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

155

*nāda* during the length of time described above as counted in *tu ṭ is* , this being experienced on the level of *unmanā* —an experience of a purely transcendent state of consciousness, the summit of which is reached in the last, supreme *vi ṣ uva* :

The supreme stage, O Great Goddess, is the beauty of uncreated bliss. 

*paraṁ sthānaṁ mahādevi nisargānandasundaram* / 

This ultimate stage, says the D ī , transcends the sound and movement that existed in the fi ve vacuities and in the six preceding *vi ṣ uvas* . Its beauty is “the beauty of the place of rest \[ *viśrānti* \] of the universe,” which is the Absolute. It both includes and transcends all forms of bliss. It is the supreme level of the deity that is the cause and origin of all that exists and holds it in herself: it is the supreme Goddess as mistress and place of rest \( *viśrānti* \) of the world, for, as we may say, all is in God. 

The YH concludes the passage on the *japas* as follows: Who applies thus his mind during the times \[prescribed for\] *japa* , O Pārvati\! //188// will rapidly obtain all the supernatural powers thanks to your favor. 

This being done, he must off er the *japa* to the Goddess in her left hand. //189// 

*evaṁ cintayamānasya japakāle ṣ u pārvati* //188// 

*siddhaya ḥ sakalās tūrṇaṁ siddhyanti tvatprasādata ḥ * / 

*evaṁ kṛ tvā japaṁ devyā vāmahaste nivedayet* //189// 

The symbolical off ering of the *japa* \( *japanivedana* \) into the hand of the deity being worshipped is one of the usual actions of the *pūjā* . It is a mark of respect and devotion. The D ī , however, true to its nondualist philosophical doctrine, interprets it symbolically. 

In this perspective, the *japa* that has just been performed is lived by the offi

ciating adept as bringing about a fusion with the *śr ī vidyā * associated with the *kuṇḍ alin ī * , a power both human and cosmic-divine, and thus as having a transcendental-cosmic dimension. It is a lived experience of the resorption of the cosmos into the deity. Given in the left hand of the Goddess, the *japa* is considered as being off ered to the dissolving aspect of the deity. The Goddess holds it and reabsorbs it in herself and, with it, the *sādhaka* , who is thus symbolically liberated. 

156

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The last rites of the *pūjā * are now to be performed; fi rst, the ritual libation, *tarpana* :

With the joined thumb and ring fi nger, he must satiate the deities of the *cakra* . 

*anāmā ṅ gu ṣ ṭ hayogena tarpayec cakradevatā ḥ * / 

The joined thumb and ring fi nger symbolize the union of Śiva \(thumb\) and Śakti \(ring fi nger\). The off ering is to be done to all the deities of the *cakra* . How it is done, and with what consecrated water, is not said. The D ī 

gives a metaphysical interpretation of this rite 

The oblation to the Goddess follows:

He will off er to the Goddess wine, meat, and fi sh. //190// 

*madyaṁ māṁsaṁ tathā matsyaṁ devyai tu vinivedayet* //190// 

Those are usual Tantric off erings. No sexual practice is prescribed here, as is, however, sometimes the case in the tradition of Tripurā. 60 

He will worship her in the company of heroes devoted to the practices of Kula. 

*kaulācārasamāyuktair v ī rais tu saha pūjayet* / 

There is no indication that this *pūjā* is a collective worship. It is called *cakrapūjā * because it is done with the *śr ī cakra* , not because worshippers are placed in circles. We may therefore believe that this prescription aims merely at excluding the presence of noninitiates: the D ī says it excludes those who are not perfected \( *siddha* \). 

The *cakrapūjā* of the Yogin ī s is to be performed in a special manner under the constellations of *pu ṣ ya* , when the sun is dominant, O Parameśvar ī \! //191// on the birthday of the *guru* , on that of one’s own constellation, and also on the eighth and fourteenth lunar days. 

//192// 

*pu ṣ yabhedena tu vāre saure ca parameśvari* //191// 

*guror dine svanak ṣ atre caturdasya ṣ ṭ ami ṣ u ca* / 

*cakrapūjāṁ viśe ṣ eṇa yogin ī nāṁ samācaret* //192// 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

157

“In a special manner” \( *vi ṣ eśena* \) is to be understood \(says the D ī \) as using the sort of “occasional \[ *naimittika* \] rites that would satisfy the group of sixty-four, or other categories of, Yogin ī s.” This precision is not useless, since the part of the *pūjā * performed in the nine *cakras* of the *śr ī cakra* was to be done using “optional” \( *kāmya* \) rites; see *śl. * 166. 61 

*Pu ṣ ya* is the sixth or seventh lunar day. The day when the sun is dominant would now be Sunday \(sun-day\). 

Since sixty-four crores of very powerful Yogin ī s are assembled in this *cakra* , O Beloved of the Heroes\! //193// \[their worship\] is to be performed eight times eight times, without cheating on the 

expenses. 

*catu ḥ ṣ a ṣ ṭ ir yata ḥ ko ṭ yo yogin ī nāṁ mahaujasām* / 

*cakram etat samāśritya saṁsthitā v ī ravandite* //193// 

*a ṣ ṭ ā ṣ ṭ akaṁ tu kartavyaṁ vittiśā ṭ hyavivarjitam* / 

A usual number of Yogin ī s is sixty-four. From each of these sixty-four, a crore \(ten million\) emanate. Surely, they are merely to be mentally evoked, even if imagined as crowding the *śr ī cakra* . No indication is given about when and how these sixty-four *pūjās* are to be performed. 

The rule to act without cheating, without limiting the expenses, is a generally valid principle, already alluded to in the fourth stanza of the fi rst chapter of the YH. Hindu ritual works on a *do ut des* principle: one cannot expect the deity’s favor or generosity if one does not worship with generosity. 

\[But\] you alone it is, Enchantress of the Worlds, who are playing under the guise of these \[deities\]\! 

*tvam eva tāsāṁ rūpeṇa kr ī ḍ ase viśvamohin ī * //194// 

As a consequence of this, says the D ī , when one worships all these deities who are but fragments of the Goddess, it is in reality the supreme Goddess who is worshipped. 

Who, not knowing the doctrine and practices of Kula or paying 

respect to the sandals of the guru, penetrates in this doctrine, you will assuredly punish him. //195// 

*ajṇātvā tu kulācāram aya ṣ ṭ vā gurupādukām* / 

*yo ‘smin śāstre parvarteta taṁ tvaṁ p ī ḍ ayasi dhruvam* //195// 

158

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

The YH repeats the rule already given in the fi rst chapter that only adepts initiated by a guru of the sect and following its rules of behavior are permitted to study and try to follow its doctrine and practices. The eff orts of the uninitiated are necessarily fruitless. 

O Woman of beautiful hips\! \[the adept\] who has thus learned, 

who follows ceaselessly the rules and behavior of the Kula, having off ered us wine and meat changed into something else, //196// 

must consider carefully the forms of the fl ow of your expansion which is \[in fact\] none but You. 

*evaṁ jñātvā varārohe kaulācārapara ḥ sadā * / 

*āvayo ḥ śabalākāraṁ madyaṁ māṁsaṁ nivedya ca* //196// 

*tvatprathāprasarākāras tvām eva paribhāvayet* / 

The forms taken by the expanding fl ow of the Goddess are the deities that surround her \(the *āvaraṇadevatā* \), whose forms, the D ī says, are born from her and who therefore are to be considered as mere forms taken by her: “They are fi gures born from the playful shining forth \[ *vilāsa* \] of the energy of free consciousness \[ *vimarśaśakti* \] which are to be seen and meditated as being none other than you.” 

The off erings of alcohol and pieces of meat are “changed into something else,” since they are believed to be transformed into ambrosia by the ritual of off ering. The D ī quotes here a saying: “Wine is Śiva, meat is Śakti; bliss is said to be liberation.” 

You, Goddess who takes on the form you desire, are to be perceived under the aspect of the spiritual master. //197// Having made an off ering to the master who is no other than yourself, \[the adept\] 

must unite with himself what remains of it. 

*tvām icchāvigrahāṁ dev ī ṁ gururūpāṁ vibhāvayet* //197// 

*tvanmayasya guro ḥ śe ṣ aṁ nivedyātmani yojayet* / 

It seems best here to quote all of Amṛ tānanda’s commentary:

The Goddess is embodied in all forms that exist \[ *viśvarūpa* \]. Wishing to spread her grace on the universe, she takes on forms by play 

\[ *l ī lā* \]. She assumes thus the form she desires. You only are to be perceived under the aspect of the guru. To this master “who is no 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

159

other than yourself,” who has your nature \[ *tvadrūpa* \], one must have off ered “cause \(= wine\); then the *sādhaka* will unite with himself this off ering: what remains, that is, of what he fi rst off ered to the deity and to the master. Which is to say that the *sādhaka* , insofar as he has absorbed this remain, will be united, fused \[ *samaras ī bhavati* \] 

with the one and the other. 

O Great Goddess\! the *bali* is to be off ered, using “cause,” to myself who am the Guardian of the Field and to Ba ṭ uka who is the self of the Yogin ī s. //198b–199a// 

*yogin ī nāṁ mahādevi ba ṭ ukāyātmarūpiṇe* //198// 

*k ṣ etrāṇāṁ pataye mahyaṁ baliṁ kurv ī ta hetunā * / 

The rite of *bali* is one of the last parts of the *pūjā. * It is given here a metaphysical dimension underscored in the D ī , which says that the inner nature of Ba ṭ uka is the vibration \( *spanda* \) of the supreme bliss, which is the self of the Yogin ī s. 

As for K ṣ etrapāla, the “Guardian of the \(sacrifi cial\) Field,” the “fi eld,” 

it says, is the body. It is, therefore, in the mind \( *manasi* \) to the guardian of the body and in reality to Bhairava that the *bali* is given. The D ī concludes: “It is by appeasing the movement of the *prāṇa* and *apāna* breaths 

and by annihilating the threefold 62 diff erentiation, and with the thought ‘I am Śiva,’ that one off ers the inner *bali* .” 

Divinized by the *pūjā* , the *sādhaka* may henceforth act freely: Ceaselessly drinking, devouring, and rejecting, acting on his own of his own free will, //199// realizing meditatively the unity of subject and object, the \[adept\] will remain in happiness. 

*nityaṁ piban vaman khādan svvecchācārapara *

*ḥ svayam* //199// 

*ahantedantayor aikyaṁ bhāvayan viharet sukham* / 

This drinking, devouring, and rejecting may be taken literally as referring to daily life. The D ī , however, understands it as drinking and eating the ritual off erings while rejecting them mentally. 

Acting of one’s own free will is explained as considering that whatever the *sādhaka* wishes, he must consider permitted. To realize the unity of I \( *ahanta* , I-ness\) and this \( *idantā* , objectivity\) is to realize the truth of nonduality. 

Amṛ tānanda quotes a stanza of the *Vijñānabhairava* which we may attempt to render as follows: “Because of the blossoming of the bliss 

160

t h e h e a r t of t h e yo g in ī

arising from the pleasure of eating and drinking, one is to fuse mentally with the perfection of this joy; one will then identify with the supreme bliss.” 

The YH concludes the *pūjāsaṁketa* , saying:

This divine and excellent threefold practice has been told to you. 

//200// 

It is to be kept carefully hidden, as one does one’s secret parts, O Dear One\! Neither to a frivolous being nor to one who merely 

desires knowledge is it to be revealed, O Perfect One. //201// One must not, in contradiction to the rules, entrust it to unbelievers, O Maheśvar ī \! 

*etat te kathitaṁ divyaṁ saṁketatrayam uttamam* //200// 

*gopan ī yaṁ prayatnena svaguhyam iva suvrate* / 

*cumbake jñānalubdhe ca na prakāśyaṁ tvayānaghe* //201// 

*anyāyena na dātavyaṁ nāstikāṇāṁ maheśvari* / 

This prescription was already formulated in the fi rst chapter, 1.4. 

I am thus ordered by You who are the form taken by my own will, O Mistress\! //202// 

*evaṁ tvayāham ājñapto madicchārūpayā prabho* //202// 

Bhairava, the supreme God, a form of Śiva, appears here as both dominant, since the Goddess is the form taken by his will, and subordinated, since he is ordered by the Goddess to question her. We may see this as expressing the contradiction between the metaphysical principle that the supreme transcending reality is the male Śiva and the fact that theologically, the Goddess, Śakti, is the supreme deity. She is supreme, but Śiva is metaphysically above her. We must not forget that the Tantras were composed by men. 

Who will give \[this teaching\] contrary to the rules will surely perish. 

Who understands \[this\] practice will become dear to the Yogin ī s. 

//203// 

Receptacle of the fruits of all desires, he will obtain all the fruits he wishes for. 

* *

*Encounter in the Worship *

161

*anyāyena tu yo dadyāt sa pareto bhavi ṣ yati* / 

*saṁketaṁ yo vijānāti yogin ī nāṁ bhavet priya ḥ * //203// 

*sarvep ṣ itaphalāvāpti ḥ sarvakāmaphalāśraya ḥ * / 

The Yogin ī s, “rays of light of the supreme Consciousness,” says the D ī , have a particular connection \( *yoga* \) with the supreme Śiva, the master of all powers. The adept who follows this teaching, helped by the Yogin ī s, 

“will therefore become the supreme Śiva,” omnipotent and omniscient. 

The statement that the adept will enjoy all the fruits he desires may come as a surprise to the reader who has seen that all the practices propounded in this Tantra were deemed to lead the adept to liberation. This, however, is normal in a Tantric context. The Tantric liberation in life *—*

which can be reached, in principle, by using the means of this world, notably *kāma* , passion *—* gives, in fact, both *mukti* and *bhukti* , liberation and rewards. This is liberation from the fetters of this world but also magical domination over the world thanks to the possession of supernatural powers, *siddhi* s. 

The Śr ī vidyā’s initiated adept permitted to perform a 

*pūjā* 

is a 

*sādhaka* : one who possesses *siddhis* . He is usually considered a *bubhuk ṣ u* , a being “desirous of *bhukti* ,” of worldly and otherworldly rewards, that is, rather than a *mumuk ṣ u* , 63 a seeker of liberation. The  *tāntrika* , we might say, is not of this world but in this world, which he has not left but transcends and dominates. This is what the YH off ers. 

The YH concludes:

What is visible everywhere, O Goddess, how can the sage not turn his thought toward it? //204// 

*yato ‘pi dṛ śyate devi kathaṁ vidvān na cintayet* //204// 

Śiva’s *—* or the Goddess’s *—* omnipresence is surely visible, understand-able, by the sage if he follows the YH’s teaching. Amṛ tānanda concludes his commentary: “O Mother\! your nature, which Śiva did not expose clearly because it is very secret, has been explained at the request of the Master” *—* that is, by the YH. 

We hope that the reader will have found this text illuminating and that our attempt at an explanation has been useful.We would conclude in the traditional Sanskrit way *—* as Amṛ tānanda has done in the D ī pikā—by saying, “be indulgent to us for that,” *no k ṣ amasva tat* .

* Notes * 

in t roduc t ion

1 . There is also a very important, and still very active, Buddhist Tantric domain, sharing many traits with Hindu Tantra but very diff erent in practice and notions. 

2 . The world is traditionally considered as threefold: sky, air, and earth. This is an ancient Indian notion. There are also other threefold cosmic divisions. 



3 . Or rather, in the present case, *mūlavidyā* , since the goddess is feminine. A *vidyā* 

is a feminine mantra—the mantra, that is, of a female deity. Mantra/ *vidyā * and deity are, in fact, identical. 

4 . For the reader who might be surprised by the shift in Sanskrit terms from *i* to *ai* \( *Śiva* to *Śaiva* , *Tripura* to *Traipura* \), let us explain that in Sanskrit, the adjecti-val form of a verbal or nominal root is made by adding an *a* , hence *tri * \+ *a = trai* . 

5 . Though very often called “Mother,” the Hindu goddess in her various forms and names, is not a “mother-goddess.” She has no children \(or, at any rate, does not give birth to them normally\). Tripurasundar ī has Bhairava as a consort but is not married to him. 



6 . There are *ardhanār ī * , half-female, half-male images of this divine pair. 

7 . On this group of deities, see David Kinsley, Tantric Visions of the Divine: The Ten Mahāvidyās \(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997\). 

8 . This observance consisted for the practitioner in wandering while carrying a skull-topped staff and an alms bowl fashioned of a human cranium. 



9 . The best description of the *āmnāya* system and, more generally, of the Śaiva traditions is that of Alexis Sanderson, “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” in Stewart Sutherland et al., eds, *The World’s Religions* \(London: Routledge, 1981\), pp. 606–704. 

10 . On the *p ī ṭ has* , see note 22 of chapter 1 below.

*Notes*

11 . This tradition has been studied by Douglas R. Brooks, notably in Auspicious Wisdom: The Texts and Traditions of Śr ī vidyā, Śākta Tantrism in South India \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1992\). 

12 . There is Brooks’s study quoted above and also his *The Secret of the Three Cities. *

*An Introduction to Hindu Śākta Tantrism* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990\). Though informative, these two books do not cover the vast area of texts of the Tripurā tradition of the *dak ṣ iṇāmnāya. * 

13 . Edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in the *Tantrik Texts* , fi rst published in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). 

14 . The *Subhagodaya* 

and the 

*Subhagodayavāsanā* 

of Śivānanda or the 

*Jñānad ī pavimarśin ī * of Vidyānanda, for instance. 

15 . This was done by Pdt. V. V. Dvivedi in the introduction \(in Hindi\) of his edition of the YH. The hypothesis does not lack probability. Abhinavagupta mentions central India \( 

*madhyadeśa* 

\) as the seat of all the Śaiva treatises 

\( *ni ḥ śe ṣ aśāstrasadanam* \). This remains to be proved. 

16 . The Pratyabhijñā \(the “Recognition”\), one of the philosophical systems of Kashmirian nondualist shaivism, was propounded fi rst by Somānanda \(c. 

900–950\), then by his disciple Utpaladeva, whose work was commented on and expanded by Abhinavagupta. It is one of the most remarkable Indian philosophical systems. Its main contention is that liberation is gained by the recognition \( *pratyabhijñā* \) of the identity of the human self \( *ātman* \) and the supreme Lord, Śiva. The “transpersonal” self thus realized contains the totality of subjective and objective phenomena in a nondualistic synthesis where all distinctions disappear in the fullness of the Absolute. A concise and clear presentation of the Pratyabhijñā was made by K ṣ emarāja in the *Pratyabhijñāhrdaya* . It is translated into English by Jaideva Singh, Pratyabhijñāhṛ dayam, Sanskrit text with English translation and notes \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1963\). 

17 . It has not been translated into English. Bhāskararāya wrote a short and useful treatise on the *śr ī vidyā* , the *Varivasyārahasya* . It was edited with an English translation in the Adyar Library Series, no. 28 \(1948\). I translated Amṛ tānanda’s *D ī pikā* together with the YH in *Le coeur de la Yogin ī :* Yogin ī hṛ daya *avec le com-mentaire* D ī pikā *d’Amṛ tānanda* \(Paris: Collège de France, 1994\) 18 . A typical, though extreme, case of this is Pāṇini’s Sanskrit grammar, the *A ṣ ṭ ādhyāy* , which is entirely cryptic. Its fi rst sutra is: *vṛ ddhirādaic* . . . 

19 . On these two forms, see below. 

20 . Other Śaiva traditions have a goddess as their main deity, such as the Kubjikā 

tradition or the Krama, with Kāl ī . The Śaiva nondualist Kashmirian system of the Trika has three supreme goddesses: Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā. We may underscore here the fact that with very few exceptions, the Tantric traditions whose main deity is a goddess nevertheless hold the male divine form of the deity, usually Śiva/Bhairava, as metaphysically higher. Tantras, we must not forget, were composed by male brahmins; their extolling of the goddess or of

feminine powers were \(to quote an American anthropologist\) “male constructions of femaleness.” 

21 . The *mātṛ kās* 

are either seven, the 

*saptamātṛ kā* 

, or eight \( 

*a ṣ ṭ amātṛ kā* or 

*matā ṣ ṭ aka* \). The number eight is important in Tantric texts. Eight times eight is the \(theoretical\) number of Bhairava Tantras. Sixty-four is also four times sixteen, which is an important lunar number, the number of fullness. Sixteen is also the number of the Nityās, the fi rst of which is Tripurasundar ī \(see YH 

3.113\); and the name of the VM/N Ṣ Ā, *Nityā ṣ o ḍ aśikārṇava* , means “The Ocean of the Sixteen Nityās.” 

22 . A *crore* \( *ko ṭ i* \) is ten million.

. 

On the Śaiva nondualist conceptions of the heart, see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The Triadic Heart of Śiva \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1989\). 

24 . But a light that is consciousness, a conscious light. 

25 . We say “manifested” rather than “created,” for in a nondualist system, the deity does not create outwardly the world; she manifests, causes to appear outwardly \(though in herself\), the cosmos, which is in seed in herself. There is no *fi at* taking place at the beginning of time; creation as manifestation is being eternally, perpetually manifested by the godhead who pervades and animates it—otherwise, it would disappear. 

26 . Indian philosophical systems, like the classical Western \(Greek\) philosophies, are not abstract theoretical constructions but ways of life, traditions to live by. 

27 . *Bhāvanā* is a very important practice in the universe of Tantra. The term is derived from the causative form of the Sanskrit verbal root *BHU* , to cause to exist \( *bhāvyate* \). It designates a practice consisting of evoking mentally the image of a deity with the same precision as a concrete image or creating, by calling it intensely to mind, any image, vision, or thought, thus identifying the meditating person with the subject or theme being meditated. It diff ers from *dhyāna* in its intensity and identifying power and in the fact that it creates its object, which is not necessarily the case in *dhyāna* . Its role is fundamental in Tantric mental practices, spiritual life, and ritual. As is well known, in Tantrism, *dhyāna* designates meditation but also, and more important, the mental visualization of a deity as described in stanzas of ritual manuals called *dhyānaślokas. * 

28 . *Uccāra* is an utterance of a mantra that is both an enunciation and an upward thrust of the phonic subtle sound, the *nāda* , of the mantra in the body of the mantrin. This ascending phonic movement is often associated with the ascent of *kuṇḍ alin ī * along the *su ṣ umnā* ; it is more a yogic practice than a verbal enunciation. This is, notably, the case of the *japa* of the *śr ī vidyā* described in the third chapter \( *śl* . 169–188\) of the YH. 

29 . On the levels of *vāc* , see chapter 2, *śl. * 63, and n. 25 ad loc. 

30 . See the commentary and notes to *śl* . 1.57. 

31 . The *uddhāra* of a mantra is the ritual procedure by which one “extracts” 

\( *ud-DHR Ī * 

\) its constituent syllables from the ensemble of the Sanskrit 

166

*Notes*

alphabet, this being displayed, according to particular rules, on a consecrated surface or placed in a particular order in a diagram called *prastāra* \(“display”\) or *gahvara* \(“cavern” or “hiding place”\). This permits revealing the composition of the mantra only to initiates who know how to “extract” the syllables thus hidden. The *uddhāra* can also consist of listing the syllables of a mantra, giving them conventional, theoretically secret names, or by alluding esoteri-cally to them. 

32 . There are, in fact, various other forms, made of three clusters but of varying length, quoted notably in Purṇānanda’s *Śr ī tattvacintāmaṇi* . 

33 . On this important term, see YH 1.67 and its commentary. 

34 . The basic work on the *kāmakalā* is Puṇyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , which was edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). A careful and interesting study of this diagram is found in chapter 4 

of David G. White’s *Kiss of the Yogin ī : “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian Contexts* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003\). 

35 . *Nir ī k ṣ aṇa* , also called *dṛ ṣ ṭ ipāta* \(“the casting of a glance”\), as a means to infl uence, harm, or else help spiritually, plays an important role in Indian religious or magic practice. The compassionate glance of the guru helps his disciple. 

36 . Hindu rites are traditionally divided into three classes. *Nitya* , “regular,” are daily and mandatory rites; their performance does not bring any merit, but not to perform them is a fault. The *naimittika* , “occasional,” rites are obligatory but are to be performed on particular prescribed occasions; they bring merit. 

*Kāmya, * “optional,” rites are undertaken to attain desired aims; mantric rites are *kāmya* , as are, of course, all “magical” rites. 

37 . On the practice and spirit of the Tantric Śaiva worship, see Richard H. Davis, Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press\), especially the chapter titled 

“Becoming a Śiva.” This book is a study of dualist shaivism, for which only ritual liberates one from the fetters of this world, a conception opposed to that of nondualist shaivism and therefore of the YH. The rites are, however, generally the same. 

38 . It is mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* and in Tantras of the Kubjikāmata. 

39 . There are traditionally eight main *siddhis* 

always quoted, beginning with 

*aṇimā* , the power to become as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The others are *laghimā* , to be light; *mahimā* , being large; *prāpti* , to obtain all; *prakāmya* , being irresistible; *ī śitva* , domination; *vaśitva* , subjugation; and *yatakāmavaśayitā* , to be able to go to whatever place one wishes. A ninth *siddhi* , *garimā* , to become heavy, is sometimes added. 

40 . On this center of the yogic body, situated twelve fi nger-breadths above the head, see chapter 3.49. 

41 . See note 17 above. 

* Notes *

167

c h a p t er 1 



1 . There are innumerable instances both in the past and in the present of the nar-row relationship between economics and religion in India. The large Hindu temples are very rich, and some rites are very costly, so much so that temple priests today are sometimes not fully initiated because they cannot aff ord the fi nancial cost of a *d ī k* ṣ *ā* . 



2 . The D ī glosses *saṁketa* by several words, among which is *samaya* , which means not only agreement but also a conventional rule or practice or an observance. 

3 . A triangle apex downward is the usual symbol of the *yoni* , the feminine sexual organ, which is also called *janmasthāna* , the place of birth. 



4 . On these notions, see the commentary below on *śl* . 40. 



5 . The text has *ātmanā* , a dual form, meaning two *ātmans* . But the D ī interprets this as referring to the “four *ātmans* ,” four aspects of the Absolute Self, a notion found in some Upani ṣ ads \(see, for instance, the Ātmopani ṣ ad\). These *ātmans* are: *ātman* , the Absolute, the Brahman; *antarātman* , the inner self who enjoys the world; *parāmātman* , the supreme Self, the level of the subtle living creature \( ṣ *ūk* ṣ *maj ī va* \); and *jñānātman* , which is the Brahman as nonseparate from the living being \( *j ī vābhinna* \). 

6 . There is no sanskrit term for religion, a notion that is foreign to traditional India. For Hindus, the *dharma* regulates the social and what we would call the religious aspect of their life. 



7 . Their names are given in chapter 2, *śl* . 3–5. 

8 . *Pramā * or *pramāna* means, in fact, measure: the subject “measures” the world, which is the work of *māyā* , a word whose root is *MĀ* , to measure. 

9 . *Citkalā * could be more precisely translated as a limiting dynamism, for *kalā* , in shaivism, is a limiting form of energy or power to act, a dividing or parceling energy. 

10 . The Sanskrit *śaktyādi* could also be understood as “the fi rst \( *ādi* \), which is *śakti* ” 

\(this is how Bhāskarāya understands it\). There are, in any case, not ten but nine letters between *YA* and *KSA* ; the exact meaning of this passage is therefore uncertain. 

11 . The forty-nine phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are, in their traditional order \(the *varṇasamāmnāya* \): sixteen “vowels,” from *A* to the aspirate *visarga* ; then twenty-fi ve consonants, in fi ve groups \( *varga* \) of fi ve, classifi ed according to their places of articulation, from the throat to the lips \(guttural, palatal, cerebral, dental, labial\), ordered in each group according to their phonetic characteristics \(voiced, voiceless, aspirate, nasal\); then four “semivowels,” *YA* , *RA* , *LA* , *VA* ; then three sibilants; and fi nally, the aspirate *HA* , to which is added the consonantal group *K Ṣ A* , so as to have fi fty letters. The reader will note that the Sanskrit alphabet is not in a complete phonetic disorder, as is our own, but 

168

*Notes*

is shown \(for more than two thousand years\) in a logical and phonologically grounded order, an order that European linguists discovered only about two hundred years ago. 

12 . The name *krodh ī śa* is given to *KA* because, in the ritual placing \( *nyāsa* \) on the body of the fi fty Rudras \(called *śr ī kaṇṭ hādinyāsa* \), which is done together with the fi fty letters of the alphabet, the Rudra Krodh ī śa is to be placed with *KA* . 

13 . Those are twelve *tattvas* corresponding to the mind and the senses of human beings. 

14 . On the *kāmakalā* , see note 34 in the introduction, above. We shall come back to the subject later \( chapter 2, *śl* . 21\). For a theoretical and well-informed study of the subject, see David G . White , “Transformations of the Art of Love: K ā makal ā 



Practice in Hindu Tantric and Kaula Traditions,” 



History of Religions 





*38* 

\(November 1998 \): 172–198 , or his book, * Kiss of the Yogin ī : “Tantric Sex” in Its* *South Asian Contexts * \( Chicag o: University of Chicago Press , 2003 \) . 

15 . A *mora* \( *mātra* \) is a prosodic instant. It is defi ned in traditional Indian phonetics as the length of time required to pronounce a short vowel. 

16 . To associate a particular visual aspect to the infi nitely subtle planes of phonic energy of the *kalās* may seem surprising. These are, however, traditional notions. They are shown on the table of the *japa* of the *śr ī vidyā* at the end of the Adyar edition and English translation of Bhāskararāya’s *Varivasyāprakāśa* \(Adyar, 1948\). 

17 . The term thus translated \(in fact, mistranslated\) is *vapus* , which means shape, appearance, or body but not an ordinary body—a beautiful one, the body or apparition of a deity. It evokes, too, the essence of something, notably when it is contemplated in deep meditation \( 

*b ḥ avanā* 

\)or in mystical absorption 

\( *samāveśa* \). 

18 . The term used is *a ṅ kuśa* , which means hook or curb and also oblique. The meaning here is “oblique,” referring to the left, oblique line of the triangle. 

19 . There is no satisfactory translation of the term *vaikhar ī * , which evokes the notion of spreading out \( 

∙ *vi* \) and is generally understood as evoking the 

external, concrete, perceptible dispersion of articulate speech, as opposed to the subtle concentration, and of the preceding stages of the word. In Indian thought, the less concrete, the briefest, the inaudible, is always the better or the best; the manifest, the concrete, the audible, is considered the lowest. 

20 . The complex and interesting process of apparition or spreading out of the Word, from *parā* to *vaikhar ī * , both as a cosmic process and as the process of apparition of speech and consciousness in humans, was described notably in Abhinavagupta’s *Parātr ī * ṣ *ikāvivaraṇa* and in the third chapter of his great Tantric work, the *Tantrāloka* . There is no easily readable English translation of the fi rst work and none of the second. The subject was studied and described by A. 

Padoux in * Vāc: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras * \( Albany : SUNY 

Press , 1990; Delhi , 1992 \) . The theory of the levels of *vāc* \(without *parā* \) was 

* Notes *

169

originally put forward by the philosopher-grammarian Bhartṛ hari \(5th c. a.d. \) in his treatise “On the Sentence and the Word,” *Vākyapad ī ya* , a diffi cult work, 

part of which can be read in an English translation. 

21 . The term rendered in English by “manifesting” is *bhāsanā* , from the verbal root *BHĀS* , to shine, to be bright, which is used because in such systems as that of Tripurā, the manifestation of the cosmos \(in fact, all manifestation\) is conceived as a shining forth, a luminous manifestation, *ābhāsa* . This is an essential notion of the Pratyabhijñā philosophy, explained at length by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta. 

22 . The *p ī ṭ has* are seats or places of power sacred to the Goddess. They are usually said to number fi fty-one, being the places of the Indian subcontinent where pieces from the dismembered body of Sat ī , Śiva’s consort, fell as he roamed with it after she died following Dak ṣ a’s sacrifi ce. Their numbers, however, vary. 

The oldest traditions have only four \(or fi ve\); of those mentioned here, the principal is O ḍ ḍ iyāna, even when, as here, it is not mentioned fi rst. Kāmarūpa’s *tattva* is the earth. It is a yellow square. Geographically, it is Kamākhya, in Assam. Pūrṇagiri’s *tattva* is air. It is gray, shaped as a circle with six *bindus* inside. It is diffi

cult to locate in the Indian subcontinent. Jālandhara’s *tattva* is water. It is white, shaped as a half-moon. It would be in the present region of Jullundur, in the Punjab. O ḍ ḍ iyāna’s is fi re, red, triangular. It is identifi ed with the valley of Swat, now in Pakistan. On the colors attributed to the elements, see T . Goudriaan , * Māyā Divine and Human * \( Delhi : Motilal Banarsidass , 1978 \) , chap. 4. The *p ī ṭ hās* are here manifestations of the Goddess. They are also places where esoteric doctrines were revealed—hence the use of the word *pi ṭ ha* for particular traditions or ritual practices \(e.g., Mantrap ī ṭ ha and Vidyāp ī ṭ hā 

to designate two divisions of the Bhairavatantras\). The *p ī ṭ has* are also considered aspects or forms of energy corresponding to planes of the yogic imaginary body, as is the case here. 

23 . Some Śaiva texts say: “The *p ī ṭ ha* is Śakti, the *li ṅ ga* is Śiva.” 

24 . In many Tantras, notably those of the Trika, the best *li ṅ ga* is said to be the *tūra* , a human skull decorated with incisions. 

25 . See the commentary above on *śl. * 40, on the theory of the four levels of the word. 

26 . *Spanda* is the primary subtle vibration that animates the eternal dynamism of the supreme deity and pervades and animates the cosmos. *Spanda* is one of the fundamental notions of the Kashmirian nondualist shaivism. It was expounded in the *Spandakārikā* deemed to have been composed by Utpaladeva \(10th c.\). On this important system, see Mark S. G. Dyczkowski , * The Stanzas* *on Vibration * \( Albany : SUNY Press , 1992 \) . 

27 . The repartition of items into a certain number of parts to which is added another part made of the totality of these parts is quite frequent in India, especially the division into 3 \+ 1: three parts plus the whole. This is what we have here. The 

170

*Notes*

ś *r ī vidyā * is also sometimes described in this way: its three parts taken separately, then taken as a whole, which is sometimes called *tur ī yavidyā* , the fourth *vidyā* . 

28 . The theory of the *avasthās* \(also called *sthāna* \) goes back to the early Upani ṣ ads, notably the Maitri, where the fourth is described as *acittaṁ cittamadhyastham* *acintyam* , a thoughtless unthinkable present in thought: it is a condition of pure consciousness \( *caitanyamātravṛ tti* \), says the D ī . *Jagrat* is the waking state; *svapna* , which more specifi cally means dream, is the state of sleep, whereas *su* ṣ *upti* is deep, dreamless sleep. The state «“above the fourth” \( *turiyāt ī ta* , a more recent notion\) is described in the D ī as a transcendent state \( *at ī tarūpam* \) of consciousness of the Self. It is the «“unsurpassed” \( *anuttara* \), the absolute, 

«“light of all lights” \(to quote the Mundaka Upani ṣ ad II.2,10\), which, though transcendent, is present as their self \( *ātman* \) in all living creatures. 

29 . The *Pratyabhijñāhṛ daya* , by K ṣ emarāja \(11th c.\), a disciple of Abhinavagupta, is a short philosophical treatise describing the main traits of the Pratyabhijñā 

system. It has been translated into English by Jaideva Singh \(Delhi, 1963\); see introduction, note 16, above. It is not a diffi

cult text and is well worth read-

ing. The D ī on *śl. * 50 is rich and interesting. It is unfortunately too long to be translated here. 

30 . The term we translate by triangular is *śṛ ṅ gā ṭ a* , which is the nut of the water chestnut, the which is triangular in shape. *Śṛ ṅ gā ṭ a* is often used to mean a triangle or something triangular or threefold. 

31 . As mentioned in the introduction above, Kāmeśvar ī \(with Kāmeśvara\) can, along with Tripurasundar ī \(with Bhairava\), be considered the chief deities of the *dak* ṣ *iṇāmnāya* . The coincidence of two, male and female, fi gures underlines the twofold though nondual nature of the supreme deity. This character is sometimes iconographically shown in images of Kāmaśvara and K āmeśvar ī as one bisexual *ardhanari* \(half-female\) fi gure—see, for instance, Ajit Mookerjee , * Kuṇḍ alin ī * \( London : Thames & Hudson , 1982 \) , plate X\). 

32 . The energies are four when a supreme one, the Peaceful, *śāntā* ,, or Ambikā, the Mother, is added to the basic three. 

33 . The expression we translate as “embodied as the *śr ī cakra* ” is *śr ī cakravapu* ṣ *ā* , 

“having the *śr ī cakra* as body”\( *vapu ḥ * \). This last word means form, fi gure, beauty, beautiful appearance, or a form one discovers in meditation, rather than a concrete body. It is therefore sometimes translated as essence, cosmic, beautiful form or presence. The *śr ī cakra* is in eff ect viewed as a cosmic embodiment of the Goddess, not as a concrete body or form. 

34 . In the nondualist Śaiva systems—the Trika or Pratyabhijñā, especially—the supreme godhead is described as being inseparably light \(conscious light\) and refl ective awareness \( *vimarśa* \), *prakāśa* being masculine, Śiva, and *vimarśa* feminine, Śakti. *Vimarśa* \(a term found in the D ī but not in the YH\) designates the consciousness or awareness one has of what is being perceived or experienced, contributing in this respect to the autonomy and total freedom of 

* Notes *

171

consciousness. This is why the supreme deity is free and active, not unmovable as in the Vedānta; this is one of the points on which Vedānta and Tantra diff er. 

35 . The Goddess, says the D ī , transforms herself really into the world, as milk becomes curd. This point is also one of the main diff erences between the Tantric views and those of the Vedānta. 

36 . This sort of interpretation, called *nirukta* , goes back to Vedic times. It is sometimes falsely called etymology and then criticized as fanciful, but it is not an etymology. It is an imaginative way to enlarge the semantic fi eld, the aura of meanings, of a word by associating it with other verbal roots, as shown here. 

37 . These actions are *avahāna* , inviting the deity to come; *sthāpana* , fi xing it in the icon; *saṁnidhāna* ; and, fi nally, *saṁnirodhāna* , detaining it there. 

38 . We write Mudrā when referring to the goddesses so-called and *mudrā * when referring to the notion or to the hand gesture, it being understood that they are perceived by the YH and the D ī as being simultaneously both deity and gesture. 

39 . *K* ṣ *obha* —which may be translated as eff ervescence—is, among Trika authors such as Abhinavagupta, the state of consciousness in which the cosmic manifestation appears, perturbing by its diversity the original quiescence of the Absolute. This role of *k* ṣ *obha* is also found in other traditions, such as the *Vi* ṣ *ṇupurāṇa* , I.2.29–31. 

40 . Such doors here are symbolical, since one does not enter a *śr ī cakra* . But when a *cakra* or yantra drawn on the ground is large, as is the case in various rituals, the offi

ciant can actually enter or leave it using these doors. 

41 . In the third chapter \( *śl* . 127\), these *kalā* s or “vowels” are called *vāyu* , or winds, that is, vital forces, *prāṇas* . 

42 . See chapter 3, *śl* . 126–128. 

43 . On *k* ṣ *obha* , see note 39, above. 

44 . The number of *cakras* varies according to traditions. In the Tripurā tradition, they number nine, corresponding to the nine divisions of the *śr ī cakra. * There are also secondary centers \( *adhāra* , *śūnya* , *vyoman* , *bindu* , etc.\), the number and places of which in the imaginal yogic body vary also according to traditions. 

45 . On the *āyudhas* of deities, see chapter 3, commentary on *śl* . 159, and n. 15. 

46 . *Khe* is the locative form of *kha* : “in *kha. * ” 

47 . *Bhūtraya:* not because there are three earths but because the outer part of the *cakra* , called *bhūgṛ ha* , “house of the earth,” is encircled by three lines. 

c h a p t er 2

1 . This, we may note, is a case in which mantra and deity are indistinguishable. 

2 . A *vyāpakanyāsa* , a diff usive or spreading placing of a mantra on the body, is normally made with the two hands over the whole body or on a whole part of it, the power thus placed being deemed to pervade the whole region thus submitted to the power of the mantra. In the present case, the *mūlavidyā* would 

172

*Notes*

pervade the whole body of the adept with the power of the Goddess. Although it is mantric, this practice is therefore entirely mental. For the performer, however, it is a total—both mental and bodily—experience. 

3 . These nine centers of the yogic body with their presiding deities are enumerated in *śl* . 25–27a of chapter 1; see above. 



4 . On the term *uddhāra* , “extraction” of the letters of a mantra, see above, note 11. 

5 . *Saṁgha ṭ ṭ a* means coming together and also rubbing, interacting. It therefore has a sexual connotation, hence its use to denote the union of Śiva and Śakti. 



6 . “Indra, thanks to his magical powers \[ *māyābhi ḥ * \], takes on diverse forms” 

\(Ṛ gveda, VI.47.18\). See also the *Bṛ hadāraṇyaka Upani ṣ ad* II.5.19. 



7 . On the planes of the Word \( *vāc* \), from *parā * to *vaikhar ī * , see our commentary above on chapter 1, *śl* . 36–40. 

8 . Amṛ tānanda says, in fact, “the fourth mantra,” the totality of the *śrividyā* being taken as a fourth element made up of the three *kū ṭ as* : 3 \+ 1 = 4. 

9 . *Visarga* means emission. In the phonematic emanation system of the nondualist Śaiva traditions, *visarga* , as the last “vowel,” preceding the consonants in the traditional order of the Sanskrit alphabet, is deemed to “emit” them. 

10 . Sun, Moon, and Fire \(Sūrya, Soma, and Agni\) are the three astral luminaries \( *dhāman* , *dhamatraya* \) of the Śaiva traditions. They are usually conceived as three concentric discs visualized on top of one another. Their symbolic meanings or correspondences are often mentioned. They are homologized with various powers: the three *guṇas, * yogic *nā ḍ ī s* , etc. *Dhāman* , a locus of light or glory, is the place where a deity or power is present, manifesting itself luminously. 

The indologist Jan Gonda defi ned it as “a holder or container of numinous potency.” 

11 . On the theory and symbolic meaning of the *kāmakalā* , the reader is referred to Puṇyānandanātha’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , edited, translated, and with commentary by Arthur Avalon, a study fi rst published in 1922. This diagram was especially studied by David G . White in * Kiss of the Yogin ī : “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian* *Contexts * \( Chicago : University of Chicago Press , 2003 \) . 

12 . *Bhāva* has, in fact, many meanings: it may mean natural, simple, but also con-jectural or meditative, etc. Since it is to be attained by meditating intensely \( *bhāvayan* \), “a meaning attained by meditation” could perhaps be a likely rendering of the term. 

13 . See Arthur Avalon’s edition and English translation of this work, published in the Tantrik Texts series \(Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953 \). 

14 . The YH takes over the notion, expounded notably by Abhinavagupta, that there is a thirty-seventh *tattva* , called *paraśiva* , which is “emptier than empty” \( *śunyātiśūnya* \) and represents Śiva as identical with and inseparable from the universe. Still higher, there is, for Abhinavagupta, a thirty-eighth *tattva* , which is unlimited and is taught mainly for meditation \(see *Tantrāloka* beginning at 11.22\). 

* Notes *

173

15 . On the intense identifying form of meditation called *bhāvanā* , see note 27 of the Introduction, above. 

16 . The cosmology of the YH is, as in all Tantric texts, that of the Sāṁkhya, for which the constituting elements of the cosmos are the twenty-fi ve *tattvas* , “realities,” 

going from *puru ṣ a* , the Lord, to the earth \( *pṛ thiv ī * \), to which are added, above *puru ṣ a* , from fi ve to eleven other *tattvas* corresponding to higher planes of the godhead. The subtle elements \( *tanmātra* \) are, in descending order, sound, contact, form, taste, and smell; the gross ones \( *bhūta* \) are ether, air, fi re, water, and earth. 

17 . *Pralayākalā* is to be understood as “without *kalā* , etc., thanks to the *prayala* ”; they are subjects, that is, who will survive the next *pralaya* \(the end of the cosmos\) because they have not burned away all their karma. The *vijṇānakalas* are “without *kalā* \[and other fetters\] thanks to their discriminative knowledge.” The *sakalā* , 

“associated with \[the *tattva* \] *kalā* ,” which is the lowest of the *kañcukas* \(the cuirasses which imprison the soul\), are submitted to all possible fetters and limitation. The YH and its commentary mention here three *pramātṛ * only, although there is, in all Śaiva systems, a hierarchy of seven *pramātṛ * \(the term is variously translated as subject, conscious or experiencing subject, or experiencer, no translation being very satisfactory\) going from Śiva, the highest, to the *sakala* , The three quoted here are the three lowest ones. The other, higher ones are, after Śiva, the *Mantramahe* ś *varas* , Great Lords of the Mantras, the *Mantre* ś *varas* , Lords of Mantras, and the *Mantras* . 

18 . *Nigarbha* : Bhāskararāya, in his commentary \( *Setubandha* , p. 155\), explains this rather unusual term, saying that *nigarbha* is as if entirely in a womb \( *nitaraṁ *

*garbhe* \), thus completely secret \( *rahasyottama* \). Jayaratha, in another text, says that it is an inner \( *āntaratayā* \) experience of the pure Self \(even if it is diff erentiated into master, disciple, etc.\). 

19 . The moon has fi fteen “sections” \( *kalā* \) or digits \( *tithi* \) for its half-month but sixteen if one counts the *āmāvasya* , the night of the new moon; see note 26 below. 

20 . The term *gaṇe ṣ atva* is to be taken as “the state of mistress \[ *ī śatva* \] of the troup 

\[ *gaṇa* \]” of deities, not as “having the nature of Gaṇeśas.” These deities are to be placed by *nyāsa* on the body of the offi

ciant of the *pūjā* which we will see in 

chapter 3, *śl* .14–21. 

21 . See note 9, above. 

22 . The nine *grahas* are: Sun, Moon, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, to which are added Rāhu and Ketu, heavenly bodies that are favorable or dangerous. The Grahas, “Seizers,” are also a category of demons that “seize” human beings, especially women and children. Their worship, the *grahapūjā* , aims at pacifying them, stopping their dangerous action. 

23 . The *nak ṣ atras* are the lunar mansions, the constellations through which the moon passes. They are both divisions of the ecliptic and goddesses. Like the Grahas, they have infl uences, either bad or good, on humans. 

24 . These are the sixteen vowels; the fi ve groups of consonants; the four semivowels *YA* , *RA* , *LA* , and *VA* ; the sibilants *ŚA* , *Ṣ A* , *SA* \); and *Ḥ A. *

25 . The theory of the levels of the Word was fi rst propounded by the grammarian-philosopher Bhartṛ hari \(5th c.\), for whom there were only three levels. Later on, Tantric authors, notably Abhinavagupta, added a fourth \(or, rather, a fi rst\) transcendent, supreme, *parā* level, considered the basis of the three others, those through which the word fi rst appears in consciousness, then becomes subtly formulated, then is fully manifested as speech, these three stages being also the stages of the manifestation of the cosmos. On the subject, see A . Padoux , * Vāc: The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras* \( Albany : SUNY Press , 1990 ; Delhi, 1992\), pp. 166–222. 

26 . The lunar month has thirty days, called *tithi* . It is also considered to be divided \(for the half-month\) into sixteen *kalās* , the fi fteen days, plus the so-called *amākalā* , which is the *amāvasya* , the night of the new moon during which sun and moon are supposed to be together; this *kalā* is deemed invisible and immortal. The division of the supreme reality into sixteen goes back to ancient, even to Vedic, times; see the Bṛ hadāraṇyaka Upani ṣ ad, I.5, 14–15, on the division of Prajāpâti into sixteen parts. 

27 . As we have seen in the fi rst chapter \(1.25\), there are in this system two lotuses with a thousand petals, one at the base, the other at the summit of the course of the *kuṇḍ alin ī . * 

28 . Chāndogya Upani ṣ ad 6.8, 7. 

29 . The term *prat ī ti* is often used in the D ī in the sense of an intuitive nondiscursive comprehension of the reality. It is defi ned notably as *pramātṛ viśrānti* , that is, repose, meditative contemplation, spiritual absorption in the supremely conscious. The Goddess is here defi ned as such insofar as she must be understood by the adept in this way, in her cosmic glory, through a mystical experience. 

30 . On the *kalās* of *HR Ī Ṃ * , see chapter 1, the commentary on stanzas 25–35, above. 

31 . *Mahāprayojanam* , that is to say, a very high use, a very prominent goal: the realization of the highest meaning, liberation, the union with Śiva. See also the commentary on stanza 5, Chapter 1, above. 

32 . On the Ḍ ākin ī s and the bodily elements, see the commentary on stanzas 60 

and 61, above.

1 . We have already seen *nyāsas* in chapters 1 and 2. It consists of the ritual placing \(or imposition\) of mantras on the body or on some support. It is done by uttering \(and/or evoking mentally\) a mantra while placing it where needed with a particular hand gesture, a *mudrā* . The eff ect of the placing is sometimes conceived of as extending pervasively on a whole part of the body; this is called a *vyāpakanyāsa* \(usually done with both hands; see chapter 2, note 2\). Such is the case here for the lines of the square that form the outer limit of the *śr ī cakra. * For a thorough overview of the subject of *nyāsa* as expounded in Sanskrit texts, see A . Padoux , * Tantric Mantras * \( London and New York : Routledge , 2011 \) , pp. 54–80. 

* Notes *

175

2 . The division of a category of subjects or objects into three groups—highest, middling, inferior \( *uttama* , *madhyama* , *adama* \) or supreme, supreme-nonsupreme, nonsupreme \( 

*para* , *parāpara* , *apara* 

\)—is usual in Indian philosophy and 

metaphysics. 



3 . The term *sādhaka* is seldom used in the YH, but only an adept who has received the *sādhaka* \(or *nirvāṇa* \) *d ī k ṣ ā* \(initiation\) has the formal capacity \( *adhikāra* \) to perform the ritual. The adept, here as in the preceding chapters, is therefore a *sādhaka. * 



4 . The planets \(called *graha* \) include, in addition to fourteen heavenly bodies, Sun, Moon, etc., Rahu and Ketu, which are two lunar nodes. *Grahas* , as their name shows \(it means “seizer”\), are powers that can magically “seize,” that is, infl uence, human beings. Diff erent sorts of demons or evil supernatural beings are also called *graha* . 



5 . The twenty-seven *nak ṣ atras* were already mentioned in chapter 2, *śl* . 58b–60a. 



6 . When considered as numbering seven, this group of Yogin ī s includes Yākin ī . 



7 . The episode is described in several Purāṇas. 



8 . The *p ī ṭ hanyāsa* would thus be performed uttering a mantra such as “ *AI Ṃ *

*HR Ī Ṃ ŚR Ī Ṃ A Ṃ Kāmarūpāya nama ḥ * ” on the head, for the fi rst *p ī ṭ ha* and the phoneme *A* . 



9 . The *siddhis* , supernatural powers, are also minor goddesses, Yogin ī s. We therefore sometimes refer to them as Siddhis. Their number is not the same in all texts. Their list, however, usually begins with *aṇimā* , the power to be as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The usual number of *siddhis* is eight. They are *aṇimā* , *laghimā* \(to become light\), *garimā * \(to become heavy\), *mahimā* 

\(greatness\), *prāpti* \(to obtain what one wishes\), *prakāmya* \(to be irresistible\), *ī śitva* or *ī śitā* \(domination\), and *vaśitva* \(to subjugate\). To this canonical list is sometimes added *śānti* \(pacifi cation\) or even other ones, The D ī lists ten *siddhis* . See *śl. * 115. 

10 . This translates *vyāpakatvena* as “pervasively.” 

11 . The term *vyoman* designates the inner “space” of the mystical heart \(also called *kha* , a term that refers to the central void of the axle of a wheel and, by extension, the void of the heart\). It is therefore also the highest level of consciousness. There are sometimes several *vyomans* that are centers of the yogic body. 

See above, chapter 1, the commentary on *śl* . 62. 

12 . The D ī gives the names of these fourteen energies and the names of the series of twice ten \(Sarvasiddhipradā, Sarvajñā, . . . \) ones. We will meet them again later, starting at *śl* . 115. 

13 . The term used to mean southeast is *agni* , fi re, because Agni, the god of the sacrifi cial fi re, presides over this direction of space. 

14 . On the yogic imaginal body, see the introduction, above. 

15 . The so-called weapons \( *āyudha* \) are the objects that the deities hold in their hands. They are not always arms but diff erent tools or symbols. Tripurasundar ī 

\(or Kāmeśvara/Kāmeśvar ī \) holds the elephant goad \( *ā ṅ kuśa* \), the noose \( *pāśa* \), 

176

*Notes*

a bow \( *dhanuś* \), and arrows \( *bāṇa* \). *Āyudhas* are also deities and are then shown in human form, each carrying one of the weapons. They are then part of the deity’s retinue \( *āvaraṇadevatā* \). 

16 . These deities are often shown in “half-woman” \( *ardhanar ī * \) form, both male and female, the male aspect forming the right half of the image, the female the left half. 

17 . Her mantra, the *śr ī vidyā* , is similarly the *mūlamantra* of this tradition. 

18 . The *āvaraṇadevatā* , “surrounding deities,” are those forming the retinue of a main deity. They are usually disposed around her or him in concentric circles—a “mandalic” pattern, as one often says. 

19 . The number and the names of the Mātṛ kās vary according to traditions and texts, the fi rst being often Brahm 

ī /Brahman ī . They are enumerated and 

described in *śl. * 116–123 for their worship. 

20 . The D ī explains: “that is to say, on the forehead.” 

21 . On the absolute as inseparably Light and Act of Consciousness, \( *prakāśavimarśamaya* \), see the Introduction. 

22 . A *bali* is a ritual off ering to a deity, notably, in a Śaiva context, to Yogin ī , or to Ba ṭ uka, and K ṣ etrapāla, both often seen as forms of Bhairava. It may consist of food, various beverages, or ingredients. It sometimes includes an animal sacrifi ce. 

23 . The term “ray” \( *mar ī ci* \), or “ray of consciousness” \( *cinmar ī ci* \), is used for the Yogin ī s and also for the sense organs, which underlines the luminous and conscious character of these deities with which the sense organs are sometimes identifi ed. 

24 . *AU* is the central part of *SAU Ḥ * , the *b ī jamantra* of Parā, the supreme goddess of the Trika. 

25 . The secret place \( *guhya* \) is “the place between the anus and the male organ” 

\(the perineum\), says the D ī . By face \( *mukha* \), one is to understand the forehead. 

26 . The six *a ṅ gas* are, in fact, not the limbs \(which is the usual meaning of *a ṅ ga* \) of a deity but attributes, perfections, or powers of a deity. They number six: *hṛ daya* \(heart\), *śiras* \(head\), *śikhā* \(tuft\), *kavaca* or *varman* \(cuirass\), *astra* \(weapon\), and *netra* \(eye\). They play a role in ritual, being imposed \( *nyāsa* \) by their mantras. 

27 . *Arghya* usually consists of water specially prepared, mixed with various substances, and accompanied by a mantra. One traditionally distinguishes between ordinary or common *arghya* \( *sāmānārghya* \) and special *arghya* \( *viśe ṣ ārghya* \). 

The latter is used for particular deities or specifi c rites. In Tantric rites, *arghya* may include blood, diff erent bodily fl uids or excretions, or other “transgressive” elements. *Arghya* is one of the ritual “services” \( *upacāra* \) presented to a deity during worship. Here the *arghya* prescribed is the common one. 

28 . We have not found any information on these deities. 

29 . The composite phoneme *K Ṣ A* is, as we have seen, often added to the forty-nine letters \(ending with the aspirate *HA* \) in order to have fi fty letters. The so-called Vedic *Ḷ* is sometimes also added in order to have fi fty-one letters. 

* Notes *

177

30 . The sequences of Sanskrit letters given here are not arbitrary; they follow the traditional grammatical order \(the *varṇasamāmnāya* \) of the Sanskrit alphabet. 

31 . The term *madya* may refer to diff erent alcoholic beverages, but when several dif-ferent terms are used, *madya* tends to designate wine \(made with grape juice\). 

32 . *Vau ṣ a ṭ * is one of the exclamations, the *jātis* , added at the end of a mantra to adapt it to diff erent uses. *Jātis* are of Vedic origin. They are six in number: *nama ḥ * , *svāhā* , *vau ṣ a ṭ * , *hūṁ* , *va ṣ a ṭ * , and *pha ṭ * . 

33 . See YH 1.34. 

34 . In the Pratyabhijṇā system, the *ahantā* is the I-ness, the conscious perceiving subject, the state of being “I,” as opposed to all that constitutes the objectivity, the objective world, the “this-ness” \( *idantā* \). 

35 . This rather obscure list of elements includes all the “realities” \( *tattva* \), or principles, constituting the cosmic manifestation. Each of them is considered here as corresponding to a section of the *śr ī cakra:* the fourfold inner organ corresponds to the central triangle; *avyakta* , *ahaṁkāra* , and the fi ve *tanmātra* to the eight-triangle *cakra* ; and so forth, down to the sixteen “evolutes” \( *buddhi* , *ahaṁkāra* , the senses, and the elements\) corresponding to the sixteen-petaled lotus. 

36 . We write “sacrifi ce” because the Sanskrit verb used here \(for metrical reasons\) is *yajet* . It refers, however, to the usual Tantric *pūjā* . 

37 . Many diff erent terms are used for ritual alcoholic beverages, the most usual being *hetu* and *kāraṇa* , which both mean “cause.” 

38 . There are sixteen when one adds to the fi fteen lunar days the *amāvasya* , the night when sun and moon are deemed to coincide and which is invisible. 

These days are also called *kalas* , “portions.” As for the *śr ī vidyā* , it numbers sixteen syllables when the *vidyā * as a whole is added to its fi fteen constitutive letters. Sixteen is a lunar number. It is also the number of divisions of Prajāpati or of the Puru ṣ a, since the Veda. 

39 . A general rule in Tantric worship is that the aspect of the deity to be worshipped \(usually to be visualized\) is to be adapted to the aim of the ritual: a fearful form, for a “cruel” \( *krura* \) rite, a peaceful one for an appeasing one, and so forth, the shape, clothes, ornaments, color, etc., of the deity being diff erent in each case. 

40 . The term *matulu ṅ ga* 

is variously translated as “wild lemon” or \(in the 

Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary\) as “horn-apple.” 

41 . In the traditional Sanskrit grammar, the “vowels” \( *svara* \) are considered male and active, as seeds \( *b ī ja* \), whereas the consonants \( *vyañjana* \) are deemed to be feminine and inactive by themselves; they are *yonis* \(wombs\). In the traditional Indian view, the role of the womb is passive, as a mere receptacle of the male seed. \(We put “vowels” in quotes because the sixteen *svaras* include two diphthongs and two accessory signs— *bindu* and *anusvara* —which are not grammatically vowels.\) 

178

*Notes*

42 . See our commentary on chapter 1, *śl* . 42, above. 

43 . A lunar month is made up of thirty lunar days; half of it \(waxing or decreasing\) lasts fi fteen lunar days, to which is traditionally added the *āmavasya* , the day of the new moon, which makes sixteen. 

44 . *Bhūtalipi* 

is often translated as “demon-writing” \(in the Monier-Williams 

Sanskrit-English dictionary, for instance\). But this is a misnomer, its diff erent groups of phonemes being associated with the gross elements \( *bhūta* \) of the cosmos, an association mentioned in the D ī . The *bhūtalipi* is made up of forty-two letters only, from *A* to *SA* , ventilated into nine groups \( *varga* \) of vowels, diphthongs, and semivowels, then of consonants ending with the sibilants, the last of which is *SA* . In spite of its being called a writing, *lipi* , its uses seem more oral and metaphysical than concrete; here we are on the plane of *madhyamā* , a subtle, nonmanifested level of the Word \( *vāc* \). 

45 . The names of the diff erent categories of Yogin ī s of the Tripurā tradition are given above in the explanation of *śl* . 90 of this chapter. 

46 . On *bhāvanā* , see chapter 2, note 12 above. 

47 . This conception of *kula* will be seen again with stanza 168. 

48 . See chapter 1, *śl* . 41–43, and chapter 1, note 22. 

49 . On the fi ve conditions or states \( *avasthā* \) of the mind, from waking \( *jāgrat* \) to *turyāt ī ta* , see chapter 1, *śl. * 49, above. 

50 . The Nityās as quoted in the YH number sixteen \(see *śl. * 112b–113a\). They include Nityā, Kāmeśvar ī , and Bhagamālin ī , mentioned here fi rst, followed by the thirteen others. 

51 . *RA* is traditionally the *b ī ja* of fi re \( *agnib ī ja* \), *LA* is that of water, etc 52 . On the notions of *pramātṛ * , *prameya* , and *pramāna* , see chapter 1, *śl* . 13, above. 

53 . *Māyā * often designates *HR Ī Ṃ * . The *Ī * here is the *Ī * of the *śaktikū ṭ a. * 

54 . Other Tantric Śaiva texts give diff erent defi nitions of *turya* . 

55 . *Smaraṇa* \(or *smṛ ti* \) has an important role in nondualist shaivism, for, in joining the past to the present, it abolishes time. \(An analogous role is given to memory by Marcel Proust in *Time Regained* .\) 

56 . In Śaiva philosophy, remembrance or memory \( *smṛ ti* , *snaraṇa* \) is an important state of consciousness, since in remembrance, consciousness, turning back upon itself and desisting from the perception of new objects, recalls those previously perceived and rests within itself in a subtle state. Also, connecting time past with time present, memory transcends time and thus opens the way to the Absolute. 

57 . We have translated *mantrātmā * in this way, but *ātmā* does not, in fact, add anything to *ṇada* . *Rūpa* at the end of a word often does not convey any special meaning. 

58 . This refers to the curved shape of the letter *Ī * in *devanāgari* script. 

59 . In the commentary to YH 1.29–30. 

* Notes *

179

60 . The so-called *pañcamakāra* is a modern notion. Older texts mention as Tantric off erings only wine, meat, and sex \( *madya* , *māṁsa* , *mithuna* \), a triad, inciden-tally, already mentioned in Manu’s Laws as involving no fault \( *na do ṣ a ḥ * \). 

61 . *Naimittika* rites are obligatory; they must be performed, but not every day, only on particular occasions or at particular times of the year, such as the *parvans* , or in special cases, such as initiation \( *d ī k ṣ ā* \), rites of installation \( *prati ṣ ṭ ha* \) etc., and, of course, on the occasions mentioned here. 

62 . The traditional triad of knower, known, and knowledge, which is taken to refer to the totality of the world. 

63 . In Tantric texts, the category of *mumuk ṣ u* includes women and children.
