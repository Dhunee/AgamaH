It&amp;rsquo;s something I have been wondering myself since there is no proper codified text as far as alaMkAra is concerned. As far as temples in TN are concerned, the Agama-s give very brief instructions and do not delve into details. For instance, one encyclopedia I have quotes the particular ratio in which flowers, cloth and jewels must cover the vigraha of deity. There are some basic guidelines that I have encountered.</description>

Felt like re-reading an old judgement: https://tinyurl.com/y9pzm28b This judgement is not without problems &amp;amp; more than anything bears out the inherent flaws of the constitution. Nonetheless, it was a significant victory that was won for ALL Agamika temples by the Adishaiva priestsA remarkable feature of tamil shaivam and of the broader tamil bhakti movement for which I am yet to observe a parallel elsewhere is the veneration of the shaiva priesthood and the fact that this high veneration was given a canonical status.</description>

There are 6 parallel paths which map all of material existence (i.e. Evolutes of Śuddhamāyā (Bindu) &amp;amp; Aśuddhamāyā). These 6 can be divided into 2 broad categories.
Vācya (Objects/Artha):
 Kalā Tattva Bhuvana  Vācaka (Word/Śabda):
Varṇa Mantra Pada  In Śaiva Metaphysics, 227 Bhuvanas in Bhuvanādhvan are mapped to the 5 Kalās, 36 Tattvas, 50 Varṇas, 11 Mantras and 81 words of the Vyomavyāpī.
During Dīkṣā, the body of the Dīkṣita becomes a ritual site for all of these six paths to be mapped via a thread (sūtra), with the Dīkṣita’s potential births in the Bhuvanas being realized then &amp;amp; there through mantra so that he wouldn’t have to undergo actual births there.</description>

Regarding the worship of a book by the उष्णीषधारी-s, even this meme, as most would know, has roots in हिंदु-धर्म. Nothing original. We see an example of that from the उत्तरभागा of the कामिकागम, going back to at least 500 years prior to the birth of the शिक्षपान्थी-s’ founder.
There will be a centre for studies (विद्यापीठ) in any of the temple’s 4 cardinal &amp;amp; 4 intermediate directions of the temple, or its inner circuit or, best, in the comforting presence of images of शिवभक्त-s.</description>

Today on the 28th of January, at IST 404 AM, as per the tamizh calendar, the tithi of tai mRgashIrSa has begun. It is the guru pUjA of kaNNappa nAyanmAr. 🙂
In pothapi nADu (name still in vogue in Andhra Pradesh), in a tribal village called uduppUr, was born this glorious nAyanmAr named kaNNappa. His father nAgan was the chief of the hunters &amp;amp; mother was the tattai. Both parents had a leonine appearance as befitting their heritage.</description>

Intro My favorite śloka in the Mṛgendrāgama, revealed by Devendra to Bharadvāja-Ṛṣi. 🙏🏾

“In the perfection [obtained] in the Śaiva [path], [He] shines above all others.
The liberated one, at [the start of the next] creation, is a supreme person; he falls down not.

      <description>Briefly put, The real hubs of Siddhānta-Śaivam are Kāśmīradeśa &amp;amp; Madhyapradeśa, where Śaiva Brāhmaṇas (as well as Bhojarāja of Paramāra dynasty, a Kṣatriya &amp;amp; the odd one out) systematized the doctrine.
The earliest Siddhānta Āgamas we have are:
 Niśvāsa (possibly 400s) Svāyambhūva (likely 400s; commented 1st in 5/600s in Kāśmīra) Raurava (likely same as Svāyambhūva) Kiraṇa (commented 1st in mid 900s in Kāśmīra; likely 6-700s at the very least); Mṛgendra (commented 1st in Kāśmīra in early 900s; likely same age as Kiraṇa).</description>

      <description>Śaivālaya Dharmakartā (शैवालय-धर्मकर्ता)
By Uttaramērūr Tamiḻ-Paṇḍita Siddhānta-Paṇḍita-Bhūṣaṇam Śrīmān Ā. Īśvaramūrti-Pillai (उत्तरमेरूर् तमिऴ्-पण्डितर् श्रीमान् आ. ईश्वरमूर्ति-पिळ्ळै)
Year of Publication: 1940
Intro by translator I have translated his 16-point essay in Tamizh on the qualifications &amp;amp; duties of an ideal धर्मकर्ता i.e. temple administrator. It may be interesting to take a look at this (now) historical document in the light of recent debates.
While several points are शैव-centric, you can read them mutatis mutandis (That is, you can rephrase the शैव points for yourself in another specific framework or a generic one).</description>

The Siddhānta is still very much dominant in TN. But yes, it did not spread much outside TN. Even Umāpati Śivācārya did not propagate it outside TN. The decline of the Siddhānta has two historical phases:
   It was once very dominant in Kāśmīra, Madhyapradeśa, Gauḍa &amp;amp; Utkala deśa-s. By 1000s-1100s, it was rapidly shrinking to the area of the southern states.    Post 1200s: We have evidence suggesting that the Siddhāntāgamas &amp;amp; Aṣṭaprakaraṇas (Siddhānta proper) were well known even in Karṇāṭaka though it was getting immensely diluted in Kērala.</description>

The greatest gift of rituals is the reverence it instills in us; not just for the deity but for all beings, all communities. The Agamika tradition involved a number of rites where different individuals (even animals) were honored. Let us see some verses from the kAmikAgamaThe kAmikAgama does not simply concern itself with rituals at temple. After all, the prerequisite for temple worship is, well, a temple which has been built.</description>

      <description>In the Śaiva context, your Dharma is Śivatvam (Śiva-Ness). To be omniscient, omnipresent &amp;amp; omnipotent is your true nature &amp;amp; therefore your Dharma. Again, Dharma here is not something you do but something you are. Karmas get done through the bodies, instruments, world &amp;amp; objects (tanu-karaṇa-bhuvana-bhoga) supplied by Māyā. The fruits of Karma are also consumed by means of tanu-karaṇetyādi. As Karman is gradually burnt off by experience (whether happiness or suffering), your Karman attains pakvam (maturation) &amp;amp; that individual Śakti of mala acting on your particular soul, in conjunction with your Karman, will also get pakvatvam.</description>
