      <description>Tantrasāra (TS), as its name suggests, is the summary of impor tant notions, principles, doctrines, and practices found in the Tantras in general and in the Tantrāloka (TA) in particular. The TĀ is Abhinavagupta&amp;rsquo;s most extensive work on the principles of nondual Saiva doctrines written in verse, while the TS, which is its summary, is significantly shorter and written in prose.
It was the tradition of some of the ancient pandits belonging to different schools of Indian thought to write brief and simplified versions of the main principles and doctrines of their schools.</description>

      <description>One day in May of 1980 in South Fallsburg, I was sitting in my room in between programs at the Siddha Yoga Ashram reading some science fiction book, when Muktānanda came in the room. As always, when Swami Muktānanda came in the room, every body&amp;rsquo;s foreheads immediately hit the floor, and that day was no exception.+++(5)+++ Mine was on the floor immediately. The first thing Muktānanda did in looking around the room while I was on the floor was to note there was a book on the bed.</description>
