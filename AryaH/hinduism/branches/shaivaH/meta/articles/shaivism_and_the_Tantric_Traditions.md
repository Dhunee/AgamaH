### Preface 

This volume results from a symposium held at the University of Toronto in honour of Alexis G.J.S. Sanderson. The symposium was convened in March 2015 in anticipation of his retirement as the Spalding Professor of Eastern Reli gions and Ethics at All Souls College, Oxford University. The event was con ceived by Srilata Raman, who worked tirelessly and resourcefully to make it a success. In this she was aided by Shaman Hatley, co-convener of the sym posium, and a number of graduate students, especially Kalpesh Bhatt, Tamara Cohen, Larissa Fardelos, Nika Kuchuk, and Eric Steinschneider, to whom we offer our sincere thanks. It was immensely satisfying to have so many of Pro fessor Sanderson’s former doctoral students assemble from across the world for the occasion, students whose graduate studies at Oxford spanned more than three decades of Alexis Sanderson’s teaching career. The volume is based mainly on papers presented in the symposium, with additional contributions by several of his former pupils who had not been able to present their work at that time (Parul Dave-Mukherji, Csaba Dezső, Csaba Kiss, Ryugen Tanemura, and Anthony Tribe), as well as by Diwakar Acharya, his successor to the Spald ing Professorship. We would also like to extend our thanks and recognition to those who enriched the symposium with excellent papers, but who for various reasons could not include these in the present volume: Hans Bakker, Gudrun Bühnemann, Shingo Einoo, Alexander von Rospatt, and Somadeva Vasudeva. 

We would like to acknowledge the sponsors who made the symposium pos sible: All Souls College, Oxford University; the Centre for South Asian Studies, University of Toronto; the Department of Religion of the University of Toronto, and its Chair, John Kloppenborg; Brill Publishers; and Srilata Raman, who con tributed quietly and generously from her own research funds. We would also like to thank University College of the University of Toronto, and John Mar shall, its Vice Principal, for making available the lovely Croft Chapter House, in which the symposium was held. 

The contributors to the volume and the publisher have endured a long wait for this volume to come to fruition, and we would like to thank them for their patience and cheerful support. Special thanks are due also to Anusha Sudin dra Rao, who proofread the volume carefully on short notice, and to Liwen Liu, who prepared the index.

### Notes on Contributors 

Diwakar Acharya 

is the Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University, a fellow of All Souls College. Before succeeding Professor Sanderson at Oxford, he was a visiting lecturer and then associate professor of Indological Studies at Kyoto University (2006–2016), before which he held positions at Hamburg Uni versity and Nepal Sanskrit University. His research covers a wide range of topics in Indian religious and philosophical traditions, Upaniṣadic studies, epigraphy, the early history of Nepal, ritual, and Sanskrit literature. Recent publications include Early Tantric Vaiṣṇavism. Three Newly Discovered works of the Pañcar ātra: The Svāyambhuvapañcarātra, Devāmṛtapañcarātra and Aṣṭādaśavidhāna (Pondicherry, 2015), and a number of articles, such as“ ‘This world, in the begin ning, was phenomenally non-existent’: Āruṇi’s Discourse on Cosmogony in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad” ( Journal of Indian Philosophy 44.5, 2016). Acharya now also serves as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Indian Philosophy. 

Jason Birch 

(SOAS University of London) completed a first class honours degree in San skrit and Hindi at the University of Sydney under Dr Peter Oldmeadow, and was then awarded a Clarendon scholarship to undertake a DPhil in Orien tal Studies at Balliol College, University of Oxford, under the supervision of Professor Sanderson. His dissertation (submitted 2013) focused on the earliest known Rājayoga text called the Amanaska and included a critical edition and annotated translation of this Sanskrit work, along with a monographic intro duction which examines the influence of earlier Śaiva tantric traditions on the Amanaska, as well as the significance of the Amanaska in more recent yoga tra ditions. Birch is currently a post-doctoral research fellow at SOAS University of London on the Haṭha Yoga Project, which has been funded for five years by the ERC. His area of research is the history of physical yoga on the eve of colonial ism. He is editing and translating six texts on Haṭha and Rājayoga, and supervis ing the work of two research assistants at the École française d’Extrême-Orient, Pondicherry. Birch has taught courses at SOAS and Loyola Marymount Univer sity, and given seminars on the history of yoga at the Università Ca’ Foscari in Venice, Italy and Won Kwang University in Iksan, South Korea.

notes on contributors xv 

Peter Bisschop 

is Professor of Sanskrit and Ancient Cultures of South Asia at Leiden Univer sity. In 2004, after finishing his PhD at the University of Groningen under Hans Bakker, co-supervised by Harunaga Isaacson, he was offered the opportunity of spending a year in Oxford as a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College. During his spell at Oxford, he met on a weekly basis with Alexis Sanderson in All Souls College to discuss his ongoing work on the Pāśupata tradition. In par ticular he was able to read with him a draft of his critical edition of chapter 1 of Kauṇḍinya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya, including a previously lost passage of Kauṇḍi nya’s commentary on Pāśupatasūtra 1.37–39 on the basis of a newly identified manuscript from Benares. An edition and translation of this passage was pub lished the year after in the Journal of Indian Philosophy, 33. In 2005 he was appointed Lecturer in Sanskrit Studies at the University of Edinburgh, where he remained until his move to Leiden in 2010 to take up the chair of Sanskrit. He has published extensively on different aspects of early Śaivism, in particular the Pāśupatas and associated lay traditions, from his monograph Early Śaivism and the Skandapurāṇa: Sects and Centres(2004) to his contributions to the ongoing critical edition of the Skandapurāṇa, as well as a new book entitled Univer sal Śaivism: The Appeasement of All Gods and Powers in the Śāntyadhyāya of the Śivadharmaśāstra (Brill, 2018). He is also the editor-in-chief, with Jonathan Silk, of the Indo-Iranian Journal, and general editor of the Gonda Indological Stud ies. 

Parul Dave-Mukherji 

is professor of Visual Studies and Art History at the School of Arts and Aes thetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. She holds a DPhil from Oxford University,where sheworkedwith Alexis Sanderson on a critical edition of the Citrasūtra of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa from 1988–1991. Introduced to the rigour and intricacy of critically editing a text based on manuscripts, her work vindicated Sanderson’s view that the earlier work by Priyabala Shah was far from being a critical edition. In 2001, her critical edition, The Citrasūtra of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa, was published by the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts and Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi. The śilpaśāstras and pre-modern Indian aesthetics remain important areas of research, along with modern/contemporary Indian/Asian Art. Dave-Mukherji has held fellowships at the Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, USA; South Asia Institute, Heidelberg, Germany; British Academy fellowship, Goldsmiths’ College, London; and Kun sthistorisches Institut, Florence. Her recent publications include “Whither Art History in a Globalizing World” (The Art Bulletin 96.2, 2014); Arts and Aesthetics in a Globalizing World, co-edited with Ramindar Kaur (Bloomsbury, 2014); and

Arindam Chakrabarti; Bloomsbury, 2016). Currently, she is co-editing, with Partha Mitter and Rakhee Balaram, a comprehensive his tory of modern and contemporary Indian art in a volume entitled 20th Century Indian Art. 

Csaba Dezső 

studied Classical Philology, History and Indology at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. After finishing his masters degrees (Latin Language and Literature and Indology), he went to Oxford in 1998 to study for a PhD under the supervi sion of Professor Alexis Sanderson. He submitted his doctoral thesis in 2004, a critical edition and annotated translation of BhaṭṭaJayanta’s Āgamaḍambara, a satirical play about religious sects and their relations with the court in Kashmir around 900CE. He then returned to Budapest and has been teaching Sanskrit since then at the Department of Indo-European Linguistics, Eötvös Loránd University. He has published, among others, first editions of fragments of San skrit plays based on codices unici, as well as a new critical edition and English verse translation of Dāmodaragupta’s Kuṭṭanīmata, “The Bawd’s Counsel,” in collaboration with Dominic Goodall. Recently he has been working on the crit ical edition of Vallabhadeva’s commentary on the Raghuvaṃśa together with Dominic Goodall, Harunaga Isaacson and Csaba Kiss. 

Dominic Goodall 

began studies in Classics and German at Pembroke College, Oxford, before fin ishing a BA in Sanskrit with Pali. After two years spent in Hamburg to learn medieval Tamil with S.A. Srinivasan, he returned to Oxford, to Wolfson Col lege, where, under Alexis Sanderson’s guidance, he produced a critical edition of the opening chapters of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s tenth-century commentary on the Kiraṇatantra, which he submitted as a doctoral thesis in 1995 and pub lished from Pondicherry in 1998. He was attached to the French Institute of Pondicherry as a junior researcher in 1996–1997 before returning to Oxford as Wolfson Junior Research Fellow of Indology from 1998 to 2000. In 2000, he became a member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient and was appointed Head of its Pondicherry Centre in 2002. For his habilitation, he submitted to Hamburg a first edition of the Parākhyatantra, which was later published from Pondicherry in 2004. Posted in Paris from 2011 to 2015, he gave lectures at the École pratique des hautes études (Religious Sciences Section), at the invitation of Gerdi Gerschheimer, on Cambodian inscriptions in Sanskrit and on Śaivism. Now back in Pondicherry, he continues to pursue his interests in 
 

notes on contributors xvii 

Sanskrit poetry (both Indian and Cambodian) and in the history of the Śaiva siddhānta. With Marion Rastelli, he co-edits the Viennese dictionary of tantric terminology, the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa. In May 2016, he was elected membre correspondent étranger de l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. 

Jürgen Hanneder 

studied Indology, Tibetology and Comparative Religion in Munich, Bochum, and Bonn, where he took his MA. His interest in the Śaiva traditions of Kashmir led him to Oxford, where he studied under the supervision of Alexis Sanderson. After completing his PhD in Indology in Marburg, and working as a research assistant in Bonn, he joined the Mokṣopaya Research Group initiated by Wal ter Slaje in Halle. After some terms as substitute professor in Freiburg he fol lowed his former teacher Michael Hahn to the chair of Indology in Marburg in 2007. The main areas of his research interests are within classical and modern Sanskrit literature, i.e. poetry, religious and philosophical literature, including Indo-Tibetan studies and occasional excursions into neighboring fields, as for instance the names of lotuses (“The Blue Lotus. Oriental Research between Philology, Botany and Poetics?,” ZDMG 152.2 [2002]: 295–308), and a study of Indian crucible steel, which has played an important role for the modern steel industry (Der “Schwertgleiche Raum”. Zur Kulturgeschichte des indischen Stahls; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2005). Current larger projects include August Wilhelm Schlegel als Indologe and The Minor Works of Sahib Kaul. 

Shaman Hatley 

completed an interdisciplinary liberal arts degree at Goddard College (1998), and then studied Indology and Religious Studies at the University of Pennsyl vania. He completed his doctorate on the Brahmayāmala and Śaiva yoginī cults in 2007 under the direction of Harunaga Isaacson. In 2003 and 2006, he had the opportunity to read the Brahmayāmala with Professor Sanderson while a visiting student at Oxford, a formative scholarly experience that was crucial to his doctoral project. He taught at Concordia University, Montréal, from 2007 to 2015, and is now an associate professor of Asian Studies and Religious Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. His research mainly concerns early Tantric Śaivism, goddess cults, and yoga, and he regularly contributes to the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa. Recent publications include The Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, Volume I: Chapters 1–2, 39–40, & 83. Revelation, Ritual, and Material Culture in an Early Śaiva Tantra (Pondicherry, 2018).

Gergely Hidas 

started a DPhil in Oriental Studies under the supervision of Alexis Sander son at Balliol College, University of Oxford, in 2002, after earlier studies in Budapest. The revised version of his doctoral thesis, on a principal scripture of Buddhist dhāraṇī literature, Mahāpratisarā-Mahāvidyārājñī, The Great Amulet, Great Queen of Spells, was published in New Delhi in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012 he held research and teaching positions at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, and thereafter contributed to the Cambridge Sanskrit Manuscripts Project, an Oxford medieval sources project, and the Vienna Viscom project, and was also was awarded a research grant by the Hungarian Academy of Sci ences. In 2013–2014 he was appointed as Khyentse Fellow at the Centre for Bud dhist Studies, Eötvös Loránd University. Since 2014, he has had a postdoctoral affiliation with the British Museum in the ERC Synergy project “Asia Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State,” where, among other forthcoming publications, he is finalizing a book manuscript entitled Vajra tuṇḍasamayakalparāja, a Buddhist Ritual Manual on Agriculture. 

Harunaga Isaacson 

was born in Kuma, Japan, in 1965; he studied philosophy and Indology at the University of Groningen, and was awarded a PhD in Sanskrit in 1995 by the University of Leiden for a thesis on the early Vaiśeṣika school of philosophy (1995). From 1995–2000 he was a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Sanskrit at the Oriental Institute, Oxford University. After holding teaching positions at Hamburg University (2000–2002) and the University of Pennsylvania (2002– 2006), he was appointed Professor of Classical Indology at Hamburg University in 2006. He has been a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, and is a member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg. His main areas of study are: tantric traditions in pre-13th-century South Asia, especially Vajrayāna Buddhism; classical Sanskrit belles-lettres (kāvya); classical Indian philosophy; and Purāṇic literature. 

Csaba Kiss 

began his doctoral studies at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Professor Alexis Sanderson in 2003. After defending his thesis, a critical edition of selected chapters of the Matsyendrasaṃhitā, he worked at ELTE Uni versity, Budapest, as a research assistant. From 2008 to 2010, he was member of the Early Tantra Project, conducting research on the Brahmayāmala, since published as The Brahmayāmalatantra or Picumata, Volume II. The Religious Observances and Sexual Rituals of the Tāntric Practitioner: Chapters 3, 21, and 45 (Pondicherry, 2015). He has since been taking part in a number of research 
 

notes on contributors xix 

projects: writing entries for the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, contributing to the edi tion of Vallabhadeva’s Raghupañcikā led by Dominic Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson, and contributing to research on jātis, as well as to digitization of Gupta-era inscriptions within the ERC Project “Beyond Boundaries.” 

James Mallinson 

met Alexis Sanderson at an open day for prospective undergraduates at the Oriental Institute in Oxford in 1987. As a result of this meeting he changed his choice of course to Sanskrit. As an undergraduate he had Professor Sanderson as his essay tutor. Mallinson was not always the most diligent of students, so was delighted when Professor Sanderson agreed to supervise his doctoral stud ies at Oxford, which he started in 1995. His doctoral thesis was a critical edition and annotated translation of the Khecarīvidyā, an early text on haṭhayoga. After receiving his doctorate, Mallinson worked as a principal translator for the Clay Sanskrit Library for six years. In 2013 he became Lecturer in Sanskrit and Clas sical Indian Studies at SOAS, University of London. Since his doctorate he had continued to work on unpublished materials on yoga, often reading his working editions with Professor Sanderson, and in 2015 Mallinson was awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant for a five-year project on the history of haṭhayoga. Among the members of the project team is Jason Birch, another former doctoral stu dent of Professor Sanderson, and the team have continued to work closely with him. Among Mallinson’s publications is Roots of Yoga (Penguin Classics, 2017), an anthology of translations of texts on yoga, including several by Professor Sanderson and his former students, together with a detailed analysis of the his tory of yoga and its practices. 

Libbie Mills 

teaches Sanskrit and Pali at the University of Toronto. She completed her doc torate under Alexis Sanderson’s supervision at Oxford University in 2011. Her principal research interest is in South Asian architectural theory and practice. Her work on the architectural instruction given in the early Śaiva installation manuals (pratiṣṭhātantras) of North India features the first exposition of these texts’ contents. By examining extant buildings in light of texts, her research introduces new tools for dating, which are valuable for these as well as other sources. Her textual study has since expanded to cover domestic and temple building practices up to the modern period, in both South Asia and its dias pora. She is currently engaged in two research projects: “The Nāgara Tradition of Temple Architecture: Continuity, Transformation, Renewal,” funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and “Tamil Temple Towns: Conservation and Contestation,” funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. 
 

xx notes on contributors 

Nina Mirnig 

undertook her studies at the Oriental Institute at Oxford University. She first met Alexis Sanderson during the second year of her undergraduate course when joining an MPhil reading class in 2002. His inspiring teaching and the insights he offered into the fascinating world of Śaiva Tantrism prompted her to do her BA special paper in this field. She continued her post-graduate studies under his supervision on the topic of the socio-religious history and develop ment of Śaiva tantric cremation rites (antyeṣṭi) and post-mortuary ancestor worship (śrāddha). Upon completing her DPhil in 2010, she continued to work on early Śaiva religious history in an NWO-funded project on the composition and spread of the Skandapurāṇa under the direction of Hans Bakker. After a Jan Gonda Fellowship at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Lei den and briefly joining an AHRC project on the manuscript collections at the University Library in Cambridge, under the direction of Vincenzo Vergiani, she moved to her current position at the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In addition to the early Śaiva tantric traditions, her research now concerns early Śaiva lay traditions, a critical edition of Śivadharmaśāstra 1–5 and 9, and the cultural history of early medieval Nepal, with special focus on the Sanskrit Licchavi inscriptions.

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania (2005), an MPhil degree in Indian Religions from Oxford University, an MA in Religious Studies from the University of California at Santa Barbara, and a BA in Religion and Classics from the University of Rochester. At Oxford, he worked extensively with Alexis Sanderson in the course of completing his MPhil degree and thesis, most notably in the form of weekly private tutorials on Śaiva litera ture in Sanskrit, which Alexis generously offered every academic term for two full years. Nemec again profited from Alexis’s boundless generosity as a visiting doctoral student, when he once more read Sanskrit with him at All Souls Col lege in the Trinity Term of 2002. His publications include The Ubiquitous Śiva: Somānanda’s Śivadṛṣṭi and His Tantric Interlocutors (Oxford University Press, 2011). 

Srilata Raman 

is Associate Professor of Hinduism at the University of Toronto and works on medieval South Asian/South Indian religion, devotionalism (bhakti), histori ography and hagiography, religious movements in early colonial India from the South, as well as modern Tamil literature. Her areas of interest are Tamil 
 

and Sanskrit intellectual formations from late medieval to early colonial peri ods, including the emergence of nineteenth-century socio-religious reform and colonial sainthood. Her publications include Self-Surrender (Prapatti) to God in Śrīvaiṣṇavism. Tamil Cats and Sanskrit Monkeys (Routledge, 2007). 

Isabelle Ratié 

is Professor of Sanskrit Language and Literatures at the Sorbonne Nouvelle Uni versity (Paris). She defended her doctoral thesis in 2009 at the École pratique des hautes études after reading about two thirds of Abhinavagupta’s Īśvara pratyabhijñāvimarśīnī in Oxford under Alexis Sanderson’s guidance (2005– 2006). She has published several monographs on Śaiva and Buddhist philoso phies (Le Soi et l’Autre. Identité, différence et altérité dans la philosophie de la Pratyabhijñā, Leiden: Brill, 2011, Weller Prize 2012; Une Critique bouddhique du Soi selon la Mīmāṃsā, Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2014; and with Vincent Eltschinger, Self, No-Self, and Salvation. Dharmakīrti’s Critique of the Notions of Self and Person, Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2013). She has also coedited with Eli Franco the collective volume Around Abhinavagupta. Aspects of the Intellectual History of Kashmir from the Ninth to the Eleventh Cen tury (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2016). She is currently editing and translating recently discovered fragments of Utpaladeva’s lost Vivṛti on the Īśvarapratyabhijñā trea tise, and she is working with Vincent Eltschinger, Michael Torsten Much and John Taber on a translation of Dharmakīrti’s Pramāṇavārttika 1 (the section on apoha). 

Bihani Sarkar 

completed her BA (First Class) in English from St. Hilda’s College, Oxford, then undertook an MPhil in Classical Indian Religions and a DPhil in Sanskrit (Ori ental Studies) from Wolfson College, Oxford, both under the supervision of Alexis Sanderson. Her doctoral thesis, now the book Heroic Shaktism (Oxford University Press, 2017), is a history of the rise and spread of the cult of Durgā between the 3rd and the 11th centuries CE and its influence on heroic ideol ogy and the risingIndian kingdom. She was a Nachwuchsinitiative Postdoctoral Fellow in Hamburg University from 2012–2014, and a British Academy Postdoc toral Fellow at Oxford University from 2014–2017. She is presently a Teaching Fellow in South Asian Religions at Leeds University and Associate Member of Christ Church College, Oxford. She is working on her second book, on the sub ject of grief and lamentation in kāvya.

Péter-Dániel Szántó 

began his studies at ELTE Budapest, where he received diplomas in Tibetology in 2004 and in Indology in 2006. He first met Alexis Sanderson at his depart ment in 2002, where he held a week-long intensive reading of Abhinavagupta. These sessions were so inspirational that Szántó decided to apply to Oxford, where he was successful in joining in 2006 with the help of Csaba Dezső, thus becoming both the śiṣya and praśiṣya of Sanderson. His doctoral thesis, defended in 2012, was on the Catuṣpīṭha, an early Buddhist Yoginītantra. After being a Junior Research Fellow at Merton College, Oxford, and then having a ten-month stipend in Hamburg, Szántó returned to Oxford as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at All Souls College, thus having the enormous pleasure and privilege of spending many splendid dinners with Sanderson. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Leiden University in the Open Philology project. Most of Szántó’s publications deal with the literature of esoteric or tantric Buddhism in India, but he has also authored papers on poetics, epigraphy, and material culture. His latest publication, “Mahāsukhavajra’s Padmāvatī Commentary on the Sixth Chapter of the Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatantra: The Sexual Practices of a Tantric Buddhist Yogī and His Consort” ( Journal of Indian Philosophy 46), was co-authored with Samuel Grimes. Szántó is currently working on the editio princeps of the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṃvara, a project featuring much input and inspiration from the man we celebrate in this volume. 

Ryugen Tanemura 

is an associate professor of Buddhist studies and classical Indology at Taisho University, Tokyo, Japan. After having been educated at the University of Tokyo, he went to Oxford in 1997, where he did his doctoral research on tantric Bud dhism under the supervision of Professor Sanderson for five years. He took his DPhil in classical Indology at the University of Oxford (2003). After post doctoral research at the University of Tokyo and some other institutions, he began his current position in 2014. His main research field is Indian tantric Buddhism, and he has authored many works in this area, including Kuladatta’s Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā: A Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of Selected Sections (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2004) and Kriyāsaṃgraha of Kuladatta, Chapter 7 (Tokyo: Sankibo, 1997). His recent publications include critical edi tions of Śūnyasamādhivajra’s Mṛtasugatiniyojana, a manual of the Indian Bud dhist tantric funeral, and chapters 1 (part), 13 (part), 19, and 22 (pratiṣṭhā sec tion) of the Padminī, a commentary on the Saṃvarodayatantra by Ratnarakṣita (chapters 1 and 13, in collaboration with Kazuo Kano and Kenichi Kuranishi).

Judit Törzsök 

completed an MA in Indic Studies at ELTE University, Budapest, and then con tinued her studies at the University of Oxford in 1993, where she was funded by the George Soros Foundation to do research on Abhinavagupta under Professor Sanderson’s supervision. In 1994, having received the Domus Senior Scholar ship at Merton College, she started working on the Siddhayogeśvarīmata for her DPhil, supervised by Sanderson. The years spent in Oxford under his guidance determined the course of her research, which has focused on the early history of yoginī cults ever since. After postdoctoral research fellowships at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and at the University of Groningen (supervised by Profes sor Hans Bakker), she was elected Associate Professor (maître de conférences) in 2001 at the University Charles-de-Gaulle Lille III in France, and professor (directeur d’études) at the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) in 2018. She defended her Habilitation in 2011, at the École pratique des hautes études (Religious Studies Section), entitled The Yoginī Cult and Aspects of Śaivism in ClassicalIndia, supervised by Professor Lyne Bansat-Boudon. She regularly con tributes to the dictionary of Hindu tantric terminology (Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna) and participates in the Skandapurāṇa Project (Leiden-Kyoto). In addition to papers on various aspects of Śaivism and the early yoginī cult, she has also published on epigraphy, Tamil Śaiva devo tional poetry, and classical Sanskrit literature. 

Anthony Tribe 

is an independent scholar working in the field of Indian tantric Buddhism, and at present a senior fellow of the Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Arizona, Tucson. He received his doctorate in Indian Buddhism from Oxford in 1995. Subsequently, he taught in the Asian Studies program at the Univer sity of Montana, Missoula, USA. In Oxford, his doctoral thesis on Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī was supervised by Professor Sanderson. He remem bers with deep gratitude and much warmth the personal tutoring, encour agement and friendship he received from him during that time. Many after noons and evenings were spent in Professor Sanderson’s study at his home in Eynsham: learning how to read manuscripts and produce critical editions; exploring Vilāsavajra’s tantric Buddhism; and being fed before catching a late bus back to Oxford. He remembers too the infectiousness of Professor Sander son’s enthusiasm and commitment, his humour, looking after his house and cat, the clatter of the keyboard on his early, tiny-screened but magical, Apple Macintosh computer, and the kindness of being given the use of it while he was on sabbatical for a term lecturing in Paris. Dr. Tribe is also a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, and his publications include Tantric Buddhist Practice in

### A Note on Alexis Sanderson and Indology 

Dominic Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson 

On the occasion of the Symposium organised by Srilata Raman and Shaman Hatley in Toronto in March 2015, Harunaga Isaacson was given the gratifying but also daunting task of delivering a eulogy of Alexis Sanderson. This note is only very slightly based on what we, Dominic Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson, remember of the speech given on the occasion, since it was in large part extem porised from skeletal notes, and since it contained jokes and science-fictional scenarios that worked well in the telling, but that proved hard to commit to writing without losing their intended flavour. 

Born in 1948, G.J.S. Sanderson later chose to be known as Alexis because he liked the name and was known by it by friends in Greece. His early education, at the Royal Masonic School for Boys in Bushey, a no-frills charitable boarding school where bromide was said to be administered in the boys’ tea, was fol lowed by undergraduate years at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took degrees in Classics (1969) and Sanskrit (1971). He then spent a large part of a six-year period in Kashmir, studying with the scholar and Śaiva guru Swami Lakshman Joo, during which time he was simultaneously Domus Senior Scholar at Merton College (1971 to 1974) and then Platnauer Junior Research Fellow at Brasenose College (1974 to 1977). 

Despite not having taken a doctorate, he was appointed University Lecturer in Sanskrit and Fellow at Wolfson College in 1977, where he remained until he became Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at All Souls College in 1992. He never got around to taking a doctoral degree, or indeed to finish ing any book-length publication in that period, partly because he was so busily occupied with teaching all manner of Sanskrit texts to students of every level. As a by-product of his projected thesis on the little-read and still unpublished Yonigahvara, he had in fact produced a grammar of aiśa language, in other words of the sorts of irregular Sanskrit encountered in the Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts that transmit many tantras. But that grammar has not seen the light of day. Looked at in this light, his career is reminiscent of a 19th-century tradition of scholarship, where recognition depended less on publications, cita tions and the acquisition of degrees. 

A few months after the Toronto Symposium in Alexis’s honour, one of the two authors of this preface, Dominic Goodall, and perhaps several others of the contributors too, found himself in the strange position of being asked by an American administrative authority to supply a letter of reference for his own 
 

xxvi goodall and isaacson 

tutor. The letter perhaps now gathers dust in some bureaucratic archive, but we can now aptly quote its first two paragraphs in this note: 

I had the great good fortune to begin my studies of Sanskrit at Oxford under Alexis Sanderson in 1988. At that time, he had the post of Univer sity Lecturer in Sanskrit, a rare achievement because he had not taken a doctorate, and had then published rather little: a couple of reviews (1985), one ground-breaking article on “Purity and Power among the Brahmins of Kashmir” (1985)—an article so compact that it seemed like a tightly compressed book—and one article for “general readers”. This last had few references, since it was intended as an overview, in an encyclopedia of the world’s religions, of “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions” (1988). Clear and very readable, this article remains, twenty-seven years later, the best overview there is of a huge subject, covering a broad range of largely still unpublished early medieval literature for the first time, and providing, again for the first time, a model of how the various parts of the vast and complex corpus were related and hierarchized by followers of a major cur rent of Indian religion. 

His “lectures” at that time were really more like intensive reading classes, which sometimes seemed to take place round the clock, with stu dents often filing in to his room for one class just as others filed out from another, and they were for me the most intellectually exciting events I attended at Oxford. I had come up to study Greek, Latin and German in the autumn of 1986, but decided to switch to Sanskrit after the first pub lic exam, in 1988, so I had had 5 terms of lectures and weekly tutorials on Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Plato and the like behind me. From the settled cer tainties of centuries of classical scholarship on a relatively small corpus, I had moved to a literary universe with few well-founded editions, few published translations and annotations in European languages and seem ingly endless questions. Classes were therefore essential, and although there were other learned teachers in Oxford at the time who were well read in certain genres, it was “Mr. Sanderson” whom everybody acknowl edged to have the broadest reach, and who therefore was called upon to teach whatever was required in the genres of philosophy, courtly poetry, exegesis of traditional Indian law or indeed any sort of technical com mentary.1 Because there was so often no time between classes, there was presumably never much time to prepare; but preparation never seemed 

1 In the realm of classical Sanskrit literature, a notable exception here was the technical liter ature of traditional grammar, for which we were fortunate to have the guidance of Dr. James 
 

a note on alexis sanderson and indology xxvii 

necessary.We, the students, would attempt to render a line of a given text, and Mr. Sanderson would interrupt, constantly, with explanations to set us right where we were going wrong. Nearly every word called for com ment or explanation of knowledge that needed to be taken into consider ation: details of manuscript-transmission, issues of text-criticism, seman tic flavours not recorded in dictionaries, particle-usage not recorded in grammars, essential religious or historical context not described in pub lished secondary literature, and so forth. This might all sound rather dry, but it was delivered with humour, verve, plenty of eye-contact, a rich and well-chosen vocabulary and an evident delight in teaching. And it always zipped by so fast, provoking further questions along the way, that it could never all be noted down. In short, it was thrilling. So much so, that after two years of post-graduate study in Hamburg, I decided in 1992 that there was no alternative as interesting to me as returning to Oxford with a doc toral theme consciously chosen to be of potential interest to the same teacher. 

In the interim, Alexis had become Professor Sanderson, having acquired the Spalding chair for Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford’s most prestigious college. There was, in consequence, a marked change in teaching style. The lectures were now magisterial, theme-oriented, weekly talks on aspects of his chosen field: early medieval religion, focusing on the history of Śaivism, its rela tions with the state, and its influence on Buddhism and Vaiṣṇavism. And they were well-attended events, taking place around a very long dining table in the Wharton Room of All Souls College. Each week, there would be a substantial and beautifully typeset hand-out giving passages of often unpublished materi als,2 and each week several of us gathered naturally together to discuss it after wards over lunch at Wolfson College, for it was there that several of the throng of new doctoral students were enrolled, or over tea in the crypt of the Univer sity Church. It was in this period, because he was at last less rushed than he had been as a lecturer, that Alexis Sanderson entered his first phase of prolific writ ing, to begin publishing his many discoveries. To date, his work has appeared exclusively in articles, although several of them run into hundreds of pages and are actually book-length studies, accepted nonetheless in journals and volumes of essays because of their truly exceptional quality and importance. 

Benson, who first introduced me to Sanskrit and painstakingly began to reveal the complex ities of the thought of Pāṇini. Rereading this letter, I am prompted to add that I am of course grateful to him and to all of my other teachers too.

xxviii goodall and isaacson 

His most celebrated piece is perhaps “The Śaiva Age—The Rise and Domi nance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period” (2009), an “article” of more than 300 pages that bears in fact upon all the classical religions of India, and not just upon Śaivism. Among his other outstanding articles we may mention just two that might be said to have revolutionised different fields of study that were not in fact at the centre of Alexis Sanderson’s scholarly interests. The first is “The Śaiva Religion among the Khmers. Part I” of 2004, which covers fully 114 pages of the large-format Bulletin de l’École française d’Extrême-Orient. This paper has much of importance to say about how Śaivism may be defined and how it has manifested itself in different regions, but it is also essential read ing for historians of medieval Cambodia and other parts of South East Asia, by whom it is much quoted. The second, in length a more conventional article of just 18 pages, is entitled “Vajrayāna: Origin and Function” (1994); this proposes a new paradigm for the understanding of Tantric Buddhism and has therefore relaunched a vigorous debate among scholars of Buddhism about the relations between Śaivism and Buddhism. 

As stated above, these articles are in fact peripheral to Alexis Sanderson’s abiding central focus of interest, the work of India’s most famous tantric thinker, the prolific polymath Abhinavagupta, who lived in Kashmir at the turn of the first millennium, where he produced a corpus of rich, difficult and influential Sanskrit works on poetry, theatre, aesthetics, theology, ritual and sal vation. In 2015 Alexis Sanderson retired from the Spalding professorship and since then has been able at long last to concentrate exclusively on the most celebrated work of this seminal thinker, the vast and complex “Light on the Tantras” (Tantrāloka), working on a critical edition of the text, with an anno tated English translation and a detailed commentary.3 

In other words, the work that Alexis is currently engaged in is the culmi nation of a lifetime of research on Abhinavagupta’s place in Indian thought and the diverse Śaiva and Śākta traditions that informed his Śaivism and are in varying degrees subsumed within it. His other contributions to our under standing of Indian intellectual history, dazzling though they may be, are mostly the offcuts and side-products of his preoccupation with this literary giant. Since “retiring” he has now been able to write up his prodigious knowledge about what has for him always been the “central story.” 

3 In spite of its fame and in spite of its being the focus of numerous scholars’ work over the last century, only one translation of the Tantrāloka into a European language has ever been completed, that of Raniero Gnoli. 
 

a note on alexis sanderson and indology xxix 

We do not always find excellence in research combined with excellence in teaching. But Alexis’s career as a teacher has been extraordinary too. Tes timony to the truly exceptional qualities of Alexis Sanderson as an inspiring teacher may be found by looking around the universities of India, Europe, North America and Japan where his students have been employed; they are not clustered together in one academic fiefdom, but have spread widely abroad and attained international recognition as scholars in a range of subjects from classi cal Indian theatre to the history of yoga. They include, for example, Jason Birch, Parul Dave, Csaba Dezső, Paul Gerstmayr, Dominic Goodall, Jürgen Hanneder, Gergely Hidas, Madhu Khanna, Csaba Kiss, Nina Mirnig, John Nemec, Srilata Raman, Isabelle Ratié, Péter-Dániel Szánto, Judit Törzsök, Somadeva Vasudeva, James Mallinson, Ryugen Tanemura, Joel Tatelman, Anthony Tribe, and Alex Watson. 

We have mentioned Alexis’s reading-classes and his impressively rich lec tures, but what many of his direct students may remember best are interactions with him in tutorials. He tended to offer aspiring doctorands many hours of extremely helpful criticism and coaching for the first year or so, and then, when he judged them capable of working more independently, he would nudge the doors of opportunity half-closed and so encourage them to get on with their work by themselves. Once they were thus launched, they would be invited to deliver a lecture in his graduate research seminar, an experience which many will remember as both daunting and exhilarating, requiring the victims to give of their very best before an audience of fellow students along with Alexis and Harunaga Isaacson, typically seated to their right and left, at whom they would be casting furtive glances to search for their reactions! 

Alexis is something of a raconteur when the mood takes him, imitating the accents and mannerisms of the cast that people his narrations, and so we tended to learn unwritten snippets of history about other indologists from him. One annual occasion was particularly propitious for this. Professor Gombrich used to mark the end of the summer term, and so of the academic year, with a lunch in his garden, after which several of us would walk to the churchyard of St. Mary’s in Kidlington to visit the grave of another former Boden Professor of Sanskrit, Thomas Burrow. This never failed to call forth a string of reminis cences of Alexis, beginning with something about Professor Burrow himself, but leading often to Professor Brough and others. 

The above paragraphs recall Alexis’s interactions with students who spent years at Oxford. But there were also many others who came for only short periods or whose interactions were only or largely epistolary and upon whose work Alexis nevertheless had an important influence. Those who have received Alexis’s immense letters, typically packed with quotations from unpublished 
 

xxx goodall and isaacson 

Sanskrit texts marshalled to demonstrate ideas, doubts and conclusions, will know just how extraordinarily rich and useful they are. In some well-known cases, they have provided invaluable evidence for the recipients’ books. Parts of David Gordon White’s The Alchemical Body, for instance, or Frederick Smith’s The Self Possessed, or François Grimal’s edition of Harihara’s commentary on the Mālatīmādhava, are heavily indebted to lengthy letters from Alexis. 

In a bygone age, it might have been appropriate to gather together in one publication all Alexis’s Kleine Schriften, or all his published work, as was done just over a century ago for another illustrious thinker whose work helped shaped knowledge both of Indian and Cambodian history, namely Auguste Barth, the first volume of whose complete Œuvres was published in 1914. But unless and until the internet implodes, such an endeavour seems unneces sary: Indologists throughout the world have PDF copies of Alexis’s published works, a list of which is appended to the end of this preface. A collection of his many fascinating letters would be a boon, but gathering and editing them seems impracticable, and we hope that Alexis will himself continue publishing such discoveries as they document, as well as others, in the publications that he continues to work on today. 

What we hope and expect instead is that the papers gathered in this volume will reveal some of the many ways in which Alexis has been influential, their authors showing us in the mirrors of their own bright intellects some reflec tions of the radiance, the prakāśa, of Alexis Sanderson.

### Introduction

and Srilata Raman 

Academic study of Asia’s tantric traditions has blossomed in recent decades. Once dismissed as marginal, or unworthy of serious attention, we now under stand the Śaiva, Buddhist, Vaiṣṇava, and Jaina tantric traditions as integral to the religious and cultural landscapes of medieval South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia. This shift, which is reshaping the historiography of medieval India, is in no small measure due to the magisterial contributions of Alexis G.J.S. Sanderson, Fellow of All Souls College and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at Oxford University, from 1992–2015, and now Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College. The present book is a collection of essays in his hon our, written by specialists of the various fields he has influenced from around the world, most of whom were his students at Oxford. 

The twenty-three chapters of this volume span multiple fields of Indology. Organized around the theme of “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” the essays are nonetheless diverse in method, historical context, and source material. Hinting at Alexis Sanderson’s own scholarly breadth, the essays here assembled span the history, ritual, and philosophies of Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism, Vaiṣṇavism, religious art and architecture, and Sanskrit belles-lettres. Together, they represent a significant contribution to our understanding of the cultural, religious, political, and intellectual histories of premodern South and South east Asia. Most of the contributions are original studies of primary sources of the tantric traditions, reflecting Sanderson’s relentless commitment to philol ogy and the discovery of new sources. The essays have been grouped into five parts, within which they appear more or less chronologically, according to sub ject matter. Part 1 concerns early Śaiva traditions: the pre-tantric Śaivism of the Atimārga, as well as the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, perhaps the earliest surviving Śaiva tantra. The essays of part 2 concern Śaiva and Buddhist exegetical and philosophical traditions. Part 3 brings together studies on the topics of religion, polity, and social history, while part 4 (“Mantra, Ritual, and Yoga”) concerns religious practices. Part 5’s essays on art and architecture complete the vol ume. Naturally, the five parts of this book overlap somewhat, and several essays would be at home in more than one. 

The volume’s first chapter, by Peter Bisschop, bears the title “From Mantra mārga back to Atimārga: Atimārga as a Self-referential Term.” Following the publication of Alexis Sanderson’s groundbreaking article “Śaivism and the Tan

tric Traditions” (1988), the division of Śaivism into Atimārga and Mantramārga has become commonplace among students of Śaivism. Atimārga in this classi fication refers to the ascetic path associated with the Pāśupatas and Lākulas, while Mantramārga refers to the ‘higher’ tantric path with its various sub divisions. Bisschop’s paper first of all observes that this division represents a purely Mantramārga perspective on Śaivism, for so-called ‘Atimārga sources’ seemingly do not use the term Atimārga. The main part of the paper then draws attention to a passage from an unpublished ca. twelfth-century Māhātmya of Vārāṇasī that does uniquely use the term in what may be called an Atimārga context. The passage in question centers on Vārāṇasī’s cremation ground and Bhairava’s teachings and activities there. The passage on the one hand attests to the existence of a strong Atimārga community in Vārāṇasī around the time of the text’s composition, but also to the transmission and knowledge of the Svacchanda there. It also testifies to the fact that the views on what constituted Śaivism in early-medieval India differed across different Śaiva traditions and that much of our modern understanding derives from specific textual tradi tions that only represent one layer within a much broader spectrum of religion oriented around the worship of Śiva. 

Chapter 2, by Judit Törzsök, addresses the question, “Why are the Skull Bearers (Kāpālikas) Called Soma?” One of the alternative names by which pre-tantric Kāpālikas or ‘Skull-Bearers’ were referred to in classical India was “Those Who Profess the Soma Doctrine” or simply “Soma People” (somasi ddhāntavādin, somajana). The word Soma also appears regularly as the last part of their initiation name. Törzsök’s chapter explores what this appella tion could have meant for the Kāpālikas according to period sources, includ ing inscriptions, purāṇic and dramatic literature, without arriving at a defini tive answer. First, it is argued that the later derivation sa-Umā (‘accompanied by Umā’) is probably to be rejected, for female initiates also bore the name -Somā. Second, the appellation is also unlikely to refer to the vedic Soma, for Kāpālikas were not commonly known to perform vedic sacrifices. It is possible that the name Soma may derive from the name of their legendary founder, Somaśarman, but it may have had additional connotations. It may also have referred to the moon and its whiteness (evoking the whiteness of the ashes of the cremation ground or of human bones), the nectar of immortal ity (amṛta) the moon is supposed to contain (immortality being a main goal of all power-seekers), or any nectar, such as alcohol, regularly used in Kāpā lika worship. Finally, given the polysemy of the word, it could also be under stood to mean “the best,” implying that the Kāpālikas, just as other Śaivas, considered themselves to follow the best way that leads to power and final release.

Chapter 3, by Dominic Goodall, is entitled “Dressing for Power: on vrata, caryā, and vidyāvrata in the Early Mantramārga, and on the Structure of the Guhyasūtra of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā.” One of several meanings proposed by Monier-Williams for the term vrata is “a religious vow or practice,” which has led to the widespread tendency to translate vrata with “vow,” thus call ing to mind a web of partly alien ideas about promised religious undertakings that culminate in offerings made ex voto suscepto, upon attainment of one’s desired end. A better approximation is perhaps “timed religious observance.” This paper attempts to address the question “What is a vrata?” by attempt ing to uncover how the notion is used and understood in early works of the Mantramārga, in particular the sūtras of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā. In doing so, it touches upon the layered composition of the Guhyasūtra. The early history of the term caryā (in the tetrad jñānā, kriyā, caryā and yoga) is also illuminated, as well as the use of the expressions vidyāvrata, puraścaryā and pūrvasevā. 

Part 2 contains five chapters concerned with Śaiva and Buddhist philosophi cal and exegetical traditions. Chapter 4, by Alex Watson, discusses where pre cisely the self-theory (ātmavāda) of Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha II—the most prolific and influential of the early Śaiva Siddhānta exegetes (c. 950–1000)—should be placed in the nexus of other rival positions. Its relation to the self-theory of Rāmakaṇṭha’s Buddhist and Naiyāyika interlocutors is considered, and so too in passing to that of the Sāṅkhyas and the non-dualistic Śaivas. A previous article (Watson 2014) places Rāmakaṇṭha’s Saiddhāntika view in the middle ground between Nyāya and the momentariness theory (kṣaṇikavāda) of the Buddhists. The present chapter adds a number of considerations that, while not invalidat ing the ‘middle ground thesis,’ show it to be one-sided and incomplete. Some of these considerations weigh in favour of seeing it as just as ‘extreme’ as Nyāya; others in favour of seeing it as more extreme than Nyāya. The conclusion con siders whether and how these varying perspectives can be integrated. 

Chapter 5, by Isabelle Ratié, is entitled “Some Hitherto Unknown Fragments of Utpaladeva’s Vivṛti (II): Against the Existence of External Objects.” As Ratié highlights, Utpaladeva’s detailed commentary (the Vivṛti or Ṭīkā) on his own Īśvarapratyabhijñā treatise was certainly the most innovative text of the Pra tyabhijñā corpus; unfortunately, however, to date we only have access to frag ments of this work, as first discovered by Raffaele Torella. This chapter is part of a series of papers by Ratié devoted to the edition, translation and explanation of shorter fragments of the Vivṛti found in the margins of manuscripts containing Abhinavagupta’s commentaries on Utpaladeva’s treatise. The paper deals with fragments of the Vivṛti on verses 1.5.6–9, which argue against the Sautrāntikas’ thesis that we must infer the existence of a reality external to consciousness in 
 

4 goodall et al. 

order to account for phenomenal variety. In these fragments Utpaladeva shows not only that, as already emphasized by the Vijñānavādins, postulating the exis tence of an external world is of no use in the realm of everyday practice, and that an external object must have contradictory properties whether it is under stood as having parts or not, but also that the very act of mentally producing the concept (and therefore the inference) of an external object is in fact impos sible to perform, because an object by nature alien to consciousness is simply unthinkable. 

Chapter 6, by Christopher D. Wallis, is entitled “Alchemical Metaphors for Spiritual Transformation in Abhinavagupta’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī and Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛtivimarśinī.” In this essay, Wallis examines an alchemi cal metaphor for spiritual transformation found in Abhinavagupta’s two com mentaries on the Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā of Utpaladeva. Analyzing this trope provides insight into Abhinavagupta’s innovative usages of the key termssamā veśa, turya, and turyātīta. Additionally, the essay considers his homology of the fivefold self—Void, prāṇa, the subtle body consisting of the mind and its faculties (puryaṣṭaka), and physical body, plus the transindividual Power of Awareness (citi-śakti)—with the five phases of lucidity: the states of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, the transcendental ‘fourth’ state, and the state ‘beyond the fourth’ (turyātīta). As Wallis shows, these passages in the two different commentaries do not entirely agree, and both present textual problems. His provisional conclusion is that Abhinavagupta seems to change and develop his view in the time between the two commentaries: the Vimarśinī features a sim pler model of a gnostic transcendentalist turya succeeded by an ‘immanentist’ yogic turyātīta (the latter being marked by the transcendent element’s perva sion of all that was previously transcended), while the Vivṛtivimarśinī proposes two distinct versions of both turya and turyātīta, gnostic and yogic, respectively (yielding four categories in total), where the yogic is to be preferred despite be ing more gradual because in it the saṃskāras of dualistic experience are finally dissolved. Wallis’ analysis of these problems gives us a deeper understanding of Abhinavagupta’s thought, and points us in some intriguing directions. 

Chapter 7, by Péter-Dániel Szántó, is entitled “On Vāgīśvarakīrti’s Influence in Kashmir and Among the Khmer.” In this essay, Szántó seeks to elucidate the role and importance of an early eleventh-century Buddhist scholar, Vāg īśvarakīrti, far from his homeland in Eastern India. The first part examines a passage showing that, probably still during his lifetime, he was considered an important opponent by a Kashmirian scholar, Ratnavajra. The debate in ques tion comcerns the validity of the so-called Fourth Initiation. The second part of Szántó’s essay advances the hypothesis that, although not mentioned by name, Vāgīśvarakīrti is referred to in a Khmer inscription from the same century.

Chapter 8, by Srilata Raman, is entitled “Reflections on the King of Ascetics (Yatirāja): Rāmānuja in the Devotional Poetry of Vedānta Deśika.” This paper is concerned with examining one specific hagiographical genre within the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition—the praise-poem addressed to the ācārya, in this case Rāmānuja. It looks in detail at two of these poems, one in Tamil and the other in Sanskrit. These are “The 100 Antāti Verses on Rāmānuja” (Irāmāṉuja Nūṟṟantāti) of Tiruvaraṅkattamutaṉār, one of the earliest hagiographical/sto tra works we have at hand on Rāmānuja, and Vedānta Deśika’s “The Seventy Verses on the King of Ascetics” (Yatirāja Saptatiḥ). Analysing the main motifs of these poems as traceable to the Tamil devotional poetry of the Āḻvārs, the paper also demonstrates that a central motif within the poems contributes to a reconsideration of prapatti doctrine in the post-Rāmānuja period, leading to the idea that “love for the ācārya” (ācāryābhimāna), and, in the most extreme case, belief in Rāmānuja’s prapatti, is itself sufficient for salvation. The analysis of the stotra literature on Rāmānuja here, by no means exhaustive but rather illustrative of the formative phase of doctrine, also reinforces a central con tention of this paper: that devotional poetry composed not just by the āḻvārs but also by later the ācāryas is central—as central as commentaries and inde pendent works—to the evolution of Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine. 

The essays of part 3 concern various aspects of religion, the state, and the social history of premodern India. Chapter 9, by Csaba Dezső, is entitled “Not toWorry, VasiṣṭhaWill Sort it Out: The Role of the Purohita in the Raghuvaṃśa.” This essay examines the various tasks Vasiṣṭha fulfils in the Raghuvaṃśa as the royal chaplain of the kings of the Sūryavaṃśa. As Dezső shows, these are in harmony with the standards laid down in the Arthaśāstra, from officiating at life-cycle ceremonies to empowering and defending the king and his army with the help of Atharvavedic mantras. Vasiṣṭha also acts as the king’s mentor and chief advisor who tries to reason against Aja’s overwhelming grief, placing the interests of the dynasty before the king’s private emotions. These verses of the Raghuvaṃśa invite comparison with a passage in Aśvaghoṣa’s Buddhacarita in which the chaplain and the minister try to persuade the bodhisattva to return to the palace and to carry out his role as the heir to the throne. 

Chapter 10, by Gergely Hidas, is entitled “Buddhism, Kingship and the Pro tection of the State: The Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra and Dhāraṇī Literature.” Hidas’s essay focuses first on the ritual core of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra, which represents the ritual establishment of the state’s protection as an act of mutual benefit to the Buddhist Sangha and the monarch. The essay then explores how this theme appears in some examples of dhāraṇī literature from the first half of the first millennium. It is shown that offering safeguard for 
 

6 goodall et al. 

rulers and their realms is a long-established practice in South Asian Buddhism, one that perdures up to modern times, while there have been a variety of incan tation scriptures available for such purposes. 

Chapter 11, by Nina Mirnig, is entitled “Adapting Śaiva Tantric Initiation for Exoteric Circles: Lokadharmiṇī Dīkṣā and Its History in Early Medieval Sources.” The article investigates the history and scope of usage of the term lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, one of the most accessible and mainstream-conforming classes of Śaiva tantric initiation. In essence, this category denotes a form of initiation that allows the practitioner to maintain his exoteric register of reli gious practice (the lokadharma), in this context the brahmanical mainstream. As such, it is contrasted with the śivadharmiṇī dīkṣā, which operates on purely Śaiva ritual and soteriological premises. The terminology of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣāwas used in different initiation-classification schemes, reflecting differing and evolving ways of negotiating the interface between initiatory and exoteric practices among different Śaiva tantric groups throughout the early medieval period. By tracing the shifting history of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā terminology in pre-twelfth century Śaiva tantric sources, the article points to the complexities of interpretation of terminology relating to initiatory categories. 

In chapter 12, John Nemec investigates “Innovation and Social Change in the Vale of Kashmir, circa 900–1250C.E.” This essay addresses the nature of social and religious change by examining the ways in which they are negotiated in the writings of selected post-scriptural Śaiva authors of the Kashmir Val ley. Nemec argues that the writings of Somānanda (ca. 900–950), Utpaladeva (ca. 925–975), Abhinavagupta (ca. 975–1025), and Jayaratha (early 13th C.E.) evince a self-consciously constructed, emic theory of scriptural authority and social conduct that exemplifies what the author contends should be taken as a maxim in the study of South Asian religions and religion more generally— namely, thatchange is not inimical to religion, even if particular religious agents are not infrequently inimical to change. Envisioning a layered hierarchy of authoritative scriptural sources, both Vedic and Tantric, these authors deemed otherwise proscribed religious and social practices permissible in their particu lar contexts; yet, because they promoted novel practices only as modifications to otherwise universally applicable social strictures, the changes they autho rized were necessary incremental in nature, which Nemec suggests is in fact the normative pattern for social change in premodern South Asia. In doing so, he argues that the complex model of scriptural authority exemplified in this emic theory challenges Sheldon Pollock’s characterization of the relationship of theory (śāstra) to practice (prayoga) as monolithic and simple in premodern South Asia. The essay concludes by sketching the implications of this study for our understanding of Indian religions, and for religion tout court. 
 

Chapter 13, by Bihani Sarkar, is entitled “Toward a history of the Navarā tra, the autumnal festival of the Goddess.” This essay provides a chronological chart of the development of the Navarātra, the Nine Nights festival of the God dess. Drawing on Sanderson’s work on the Orissan Mahānavamī traditions of Bhadrakālī and ritual descriptions outlined in Sanskrit sources, Sarkar iden tifies four phases in the trajectory of the Navarātra, as it grew into the pre eminent political rite for authorizing and creating royal power. These were: an early Vaiṣṇava rite in the monsoon, its incorporation of a pre-established Brahmanical military tradition in Āśvina, its expansion into a ten day affair and inclusion of tantric rituals for powers (siddhis) in East India, and the growth later of the distinctive Southern and Western Navarātras. Tamil sources of uncertain date, however, add complexity to this picture. 

Part 4 of this book contains six essays on various aspects of religious praxis, including yoga. In chapter 14, “Śārikā’s Mantra,” Jürgen Hanneder studies the tantric deity Śārikā, who is worshipped in the form of a large stone on the “Śārikā Peak” or Pradyumna Peak in Śrīnagar. Hanneder examines several rit ual texts that describe the iconography and worship of this goddess, includ ing her mantra. In the seventeenth century the Kashmirian author Sāhib Kaul wrote a Stotra devoted to Śārikā, in which her mantra is given in the style of a mantroddhāra, that is with code words, so that the “sounds” of the mantra need not be explicitly uttered. This chapter contains an edition and trans lation of this text and an analysis, which shows that Sāhib Kaul’s version of the mantra of Śārikā strangely fails to accord with most other sources of this mantra. 

Chapter 15, by Diwakar Acharya, is entitled “The Kāmasiddhistuti of King Vatsarāja.” In this chapter, Acharya presents an edition and translation of the previously unpublished Śaiva Kāmasiddhistuti attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravartin Vatsarāja, who can perhaps be identified with King Vat sarāja of the Gurjara-Pratihāra dynasty (c. 775–805A.D.), the father of Mahārā jādhirāja Nāgabhaṭa II (805–833A.D.). As a pūjāstuti, this text guides its reciter through the mental or actual worship of Goddess Nityā Sundarī, of whom the poet is a devotee. He invokes the goddess as Maheśvarī and Gaurī, but concedes that some call her Lakṣmī and Parā Prakṛti. As Acharya shows, the poet appears unaware of the systems of nine, eleven, or sixteen Nityās, which are worshipped in the traditions of the Nityākaula, Manthānabhairava, and Vāmakeśvara Tantras, respectively. Rather, the author is aware of only one Nityā, who is simply called Sundarī and is installed as Nityā Sundarī at the altar of worship in the centre of the maṇḍala, without a consort, independent and supreme.

Chapter 16, by Shaman Hatley, is entitled “The Lotus Garland (padmamālā) and Cord of Power (śaktitantu): The Brahmayāmala’s Integration of Inner and Outer Ritual.” This essay examines the relationship between “ritual” and “yoga” in the Brahmayāmala, a voluminous early tantra whose place in the history of Śaivism was first identified by Professor Sanderson (1988). The early history of Śaiva yoga remains inadequately studied, and foundational early sources such as the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā and Brahmayāmala diverge widely in their tech nical vocabulary and conceptions of the body. The focus of this essay is the explication of the Brahmayāmala’s manner of integrating inner and outer rit ual processes, both of which have their basis in a system of Nine Lotuses and Nine Knots (granthi) strung together by the “cord of power” (śaktitantu, śak tisūtra). In analysing this unique system, the essay examines a number of key issues, including the role of visualization in ritual, mantra-installation (nyāsa), the body’s subtle channels (nāḍī) and knots (granthi), and shifting conceptions of the relationship between knowledge ( jñāna) and ritual action (kriyā). 

Chapter 17, by James Mallinson, is entitled “The Amṛtasiddhi: Haṭhayoga’s Tantric Buddhist Source Text.” The unpublished circa eleventh-century Amṛta siddhi is the oldest text to teach any of the principles and practices that came to distinguish the haṭha method of yoga practice taught in later Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva manuals, such as the Dattātreyayogaśāstra and Haṭhapradīpikā. Many of its central teachings have no precedents in earlier texts: the yogic body with the moon situated at the top of the central channel dripping amṛta and the sun at its bottom consuming it; the three physical techniques that make up the text’s central practice (mahāmudrā,mahābandha andmahāvedha); the four stages of the practice (ārambha, ghaṭa, paricaya and niṣpatti); the principle that bindu or semen is the most important vital constituent and hence that its preservation is paramount; and the principle that the mind, breath and bindu are connected, so that controlling one controls the others. These are then repeated, often ver batim, in almost all subsequent haṭha texts. The Amṛtasiddhi has been the subject of only one previous study, an article by Kurtis Schaeffer (2004), which analyses the text as found in a bilingual (Sanskrit and Tibetan) manuscript that probably dates to the twelfth century CE. Schaeffer, because of some seem ingly non-Buddhist teachings in the text, in particular those on jīvanmukti, understands it to be a Śaiva work. This paper, however, shows that some of its teachings are specifically Buddhist, and concludes that the text was composed in a Buddhist milieu and that later Indian and Nepalese manuscripts of the text either misunderstood its Buddhist features or deliberately removed or changed them. 

Chapter 18, by Csaba Kiss, is entitled “A Sexual Ritual with Māyā in Matsye ndrasaṃhitā 40.” The Matsyendrasaṃhitā, a 13th-century South Indian Kubji 
 

introduction 9 

kā-Tripurā-oriented tantric yoga text of the Ṣaḍanvayaśāmbhava tradition, de scribes a unique sexual ritual in its 40th chapter. Kiss analyses sigificant ambi guities therein, in addition to providing an edition and annotated translation of the relevant passages. The chapter recommends that the yogin have sex ual encounters with (human) yoginīs, while avoiding pāśavī (uninitiated?) women, but devotes most of its attention to a ritual with Māyā, a rather ambigu ous female. Is she an imagined goddess (kuṇḍalinī?) or an uninitiated woman of low birth? Is the sexual act visualized or ‘real’? Kiss argues that these ambi guities may be deliberate. The ambiguity between actual sex and visualization reflects the tension between sexuality and asceticism manifest in the frame story of the Matsyendrasaṃhitā, a unique version of the legend of Matsyen dra and Gorakṣa. While possibly echoing or quoting older tantric texts con taining descriptions of sexual rituals, the redactors of the Matsyendrasaṃhitā were perhaps transitioning towards ascetic or brahmacarya-oriented teach ings. As a result, Kiss argues, they came up with an obscure variant on the figure of the tantric yoginī: Māyā, first described as a phantom, resembling a goddess visualized in worship, then also takes part in an actual sexual rit ual. 

Chapter19, byJason Birch, is entitled“Haṭhayoga’s Floruit on the Eve of Colo nialism.” The aim of this article is to provide a framework for examining the textual sources on Haṭhayoga that were composed from the sixteenth to eigh teenth centuries. After a brief introduction to the early history of Haṭha- and Rājayoga, the main section of the article focuses on the salient features of the late literature on Haṭhayoga by dividing the texts into two categories; ‘extended works’ and ‘compendiums.’ The extended works expatiate on Haṭhayoga as it was formulated in the Haṭhapradīpikā, whereas the compendiums integrate teachings of Haṭhayoga within a discourse on yoga more generally conceived. Both etic categories include scholarly and practical works which, when read together in this way, reveal significant changes to the praxis and theory of Haṭhayoga on the eve of colonialism. The article concludes with a brief dis cussion on the regional distribution of the literature of Haṭhayoga during this period and how the codification of its praxis and theory appears to have diverged in different regions. 

The papers of part 5 concern religious art and architecture. Chapter 20, by Lib bie Mills, is entitled “The Early Śaiva Maṭha: Form and Function.” We are not told a great deal in the early Śaiva textual record about the practicalities of life inside the maṭha. In this chapter, Mills seeks to find a way into the topic by looking at the physical structure of the buildings. Drawing on materials that include instructions for building, the essay considers the designs given 
 

10 goodall et al. 

for the construction of the maṭha, and what those designs might tell us of what took place inside. The paper aims to add to the exploration of the maṭha treated to great effect by Tamara Sears.1 

Chapter 21, by Ryugen Tanemura, concerns “The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta and its Parallels in the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras.” As Sanderson demon strates in “The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism During the Early Medieval Period” (2009), tantric Buddhism devised a number of ceremonies in the domain of public religion following the Śaiva models, such as consecra tion (pratiṣṭhā) and funeral rites (antyeṣṭi). Tantric Buddhist manuals called maṇḍalavidhis teach the details of these public social rituals. These manu als closely resemble the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras and Paddhatis. Among these, the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta, most probably written in the Kath mandu valley in the eleventh century C.E., is particularly rich in information, as are also the Vajrāvalī of Abhayākaragupta and the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya of Jagaddarpaṇa or Darpaṇācārya. The purpose of this paper is to present var ious Śaiva parallels in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, especially textual parallels between the nimittokti section of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā and the Śalyo ddhārapaṭala of the Devyāmata, a Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra. The relevant sections and chapters of these two texts concern the topic of how to find and remove extraneous substances (śalya) underground during the rituals in order to avoid the calamities which they may cause. Tanemura also presents as an appendix a preliminary edition and translation of a section of the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya called Bhūśalyasūtrapātananimittavidhi; this also contains some parallels with the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā and the Devyāmata. 

Chapter 22, by Anthony Tribe, concerns “Mañjuśrī as Ādibuddha: The Iden tity of an Eight-armed Form of Mañjuśrī Found in Early Western Himalayan Buddhist Art in the Light of Three Nāmasaṃgīti-related Texts.” This chap ter examines the identity of an eight-armed form of Mañjuśrī found in early western Himalayan Buddhist art (11th–13th centuries). This figure is found most prominently in the Sumtsek (Gsum-brtsegs, “Three-Storeyed”) temple at Achi, Ladakh where, as a mural, it is the central deity of a maṇḍala. Its position on the top storey, suggesting that it is the figure of highest status in the temple’s iconographic programme, has long puzzled scholars. Less well known are two other examples of this figure: a mural in the chapel of the two-armed Maitreya at Mangyu, Ladakh, and a clay figure in the Golden Temple or Serkhang (Gser-khang) at Lalung, Spiti.

ure in three Nāmasaṃgīti-related texts—the Ākāśavimala of Mañjuśrīmitra, the *Sādhanaupayika (Sgrub pa’i thabs) of Agrabodhi, and the Nāmamantrā rthāvalokinī of Vilāsavajra—Tribe argues that the figure should be identified as (Mañjuśrī in the form of) the Ādibuddha and not Mañjuśrī as a bodhisattva. The authors of these three texts comprise some of the earliest commentators on the Nāmasaṃgīti (also known as the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti), and share a concern to promote Mañjuśrī by placing him, as the Ādibuddha, at the heart (both literally and metaphorically) of Mahāvairocana in an adaptation of the yogatantra Vajradhātu-mahāmaṇḍala. 

Chapter 23, by Parul Dave-Mukherji, is entitled “Life and Afterlife of Sādṛśya: Revisiting the Citrasūtra through the Nationalism-Naturalism Debate in Indian Art History.” This essay revisits the Citrasūtra, a seminal section on painting from the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, in the light of key concerns around the cul tural politics of art historiography, the śāstra-prayoga debate, and the related question of interpretative frames to study traditional Indian art. The last con cern has lately come to the forefront in the context of postcolonial studies and global art history. If the former is critical of intellectual parasitism, the latter pushes postcolonial thought to explore ‘native’ interpretative frames to study pre-modern Indian art. This paper attempts to complicate the search for alternative frameworks by underlining gaps and slippages that surround the meaning of terms in the given text and their modern appropriation. To this end, it traces a genealogy of a term, sādṛśya, from the śilpaśāstric lexicon through its twentieth-century reception in art-historical discourse. How does a term acquire an afterlife when it enters into the force field of reinterpretation steeped in cultural nationalism? How would a newly ‘discovered’ Sanskrit text function in such a space? Dave-Mukherji also addresses a larger question: what is the genealogy of India’s cultural past, and specifically its “art,” as transcen dental/idealistic/spiritual, which has translated itself into a belief? And why does this belief persist, although in different configurations? The essay then turns to alternative interpretative frames for the study of Indian art, first by critically examining ethnographic approaches to the study of texts, and then by relating Coomaraswamy’s transcendentalism with David Shulman’s recent discourse around the ‘more than real.’

### 1 From Mantramārga Back to Atimārga: 

Atimārga as a Self-referential Term 

Peter C. Bisschop 

1 Introduction 

The impact of Alexis Sanderson’s scholarship can be easily measured by the subject of the present paper. Before 1988, when Sanderson published his groundbreaking article “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” the term Atimārga was hardly used by anyone with the exception of a few specialists of Tantric Śaivism, and it certainly was never addressed systematically.1 Thus, for exam ple, Minoru Hara, who completed his dissertation on the Pāśupatas at Harvard in 1966 and published extensively on the Pāśupata tradition in the subsequent decades, never once used the term.2 In the years to come, however, various scholars started to use it with great confidence in increasing numbers and cur rently the Atimārga is widely regarded as one of the two major divisions of Śaivism, alongside that of the Mantramārga. Quite influential in the dissem ination of the term has been Gavin Flood, who adopted it in his An Intro duction to Hinduism (1996). The chapters on the Śaiva and Śākta traditions in this book are deeply dependent on Sanderson’s scholarship. As an illustration of how commonplace and accepted its use has become, reference may also be made to the entry on Atimārga in the popular A Dictionary of Hinduism by W.J. Johnson (2009). The description clearly reflects Sanderson’s scholar ship: 

One of the two main branches of Śaivism described in the Śaiva Āgamas or Tantras (the other being the mantramārga, or “path of mantras”). The atimārga, which is entered on solely in order to attain liberation, is open only to ascetics. It has two divisions, the Pāśupata, and the Lākula, itself

a development from within the Pāśupata tradition; both are concerned with Śiva in his wild and terrible form of Rudra.3 

In the present paper I would like to reconsider the meaning and use of the term Atimārga, in the light of an intriguing passage from an unpublished Māhātmya on the holy city of Vārāṇasī (sometimes referred to hereafter as “VM”). In par ticular, I want to take up the question whether the term Atimārga was ever used by Pāśupatas or other groups that one would associate with the Atimārga themselves. Was it, in other words, ever used self-referentially or does it only represent a higher, tantric (“Mantramārgic”) perspective on the ascetic path of Śaivism? 

2 Atimārga and Mantramārga 

For a start, here is the introduction to the Atimārga from “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” without a doubt the single most influential article on Śai vism of the twentieth century: 

The Teaching of Śiva (śivaśāsana) which defines the Śaivas is divided between two great branches or “streams” (srotas). These are termed the Outer Path (Atimārga) and the Path of Mantras (Mantramārga). The first is accessible only to ascetics, while the second is open both to ascetics and to married home-dwellers (gṛhastha). There is also a difference of goals. The Atimārga is entered for salvation alone, while the Mantramārga promises both this, and for those that so wish, the attainment of super natural powers (siddhis) and the experience of supernatural pleasures in the worlds of their choice (bhoga). The Atimārga’s Śaivism is sometimes called Raudra rather than Śaiva. This is because it is attributed to and con cerned with Śiva in his archaic, Vedic form as Rudra (the “Terrible”), the god of wild and protean powers outside the śrauta sacrifice. It has two principal divisions, the Pāśupata and the Lākula. (Sanderson 1998, 664.) 

An important aspect of the above definition is that it is written from the view point of the Mantramārga. Although it follows an emic division of Śaivism,4 it is one which appears to have been coined by the Mantramārga and not by 

3 Quoted from the electronic version: http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/978 0198610250.001.0001/acref‑9780198610250

the Atimārga itself. In other words, it reflects the higher Mantramārgic system atization of doctrines and practices. The Atimārga, in contrast, represents a more archaic ascetic strand of Śaivism, predating the development of tantric Śaivism. Initially it was not known as Atimārga, nor do we have evidence of ascetics who refer to themselves as Atimārgins, “Followers of the Outer Path.” The name Atimārga was well chosen, however, for the Pāśupata ascetics adhered to what they called the Atyāśrama “Outer Discipline,” by which they indicated that they were beyond the four disciplines (āśrama) that define orthodox Brahmanism. Pāśupatasūtra 2.15–17 plays on the theme of being “beyond” (ati-) customary practise: 

atidattam atīṣṭam atitaptaṃ tapas tathā atyāgatiṃ gamayate 

The extraordinary gift, the extraordinary offer, and the extraordinary practise of asceticism leads to the extraordinary goal. 

Whoever coined the term was therefore closely familiar with the tradition. The division of Śaivism into Atimārga and Mantramārga appears for the first time in the Niśvāsamukha, the introduction to the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā. The Mantramārga is presented here as the fifth and highest stream (srotas) of reli gion, which has been revealed by Śiva’s fifth, upper face.5 The Atimārga, by contrast, is said to have been revealed by Śiva’s fourth, eastern face. In terms of hierarchy this indicates a lower position, on a par with that of the revelations by Śiva’s three other faces: the Laukika or mundane religion taught by his west ern face, the Vaidika or brahmanical religion taught by his northern face, and the Ādhyātmika or system of knowledge of the self taught by his southern face. On the other hand, its connection with Śiva’s eastern face sets it apart from the three other religious traditions and it is clear from the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā itself that some of the text’s teachings are in fact deeply influenced by those of the Atimārga.6 The Niśvāsamukha’s fivefold scheme itself appears to be an expansion based on a passage from the Manusmṛti (2.117), where three forms of knowledge are distinguished: Laukika, Vaidika, Ādhyātmika.7 

Śaivism of the Pāśupatas and related systems, is extracted, then, from a stage of the tradition which predates our famous commentators and perhaps even some of the Āgamas them selves.”

Following the Niśvāsamukha, we find the division in a range of Mantramārga scriptures and in texts of authors with a Mantramārga affiliation, although it is certainly not ubiquitous across tantric literature. As will be seen below, most important for the present paper is the following passage from the Svacchanda tantra: 

It is called Atimārga because it is beyond the mental dispositions. It is taught as “Atimārga” because the doctrine is beyond the worlds. And the lokas are designated “bound souls,” in the cycle of birth and death. They who are established in the Atimārga, [that is to say] the followers of the observance of the skull and the Pāśupatas, they are to be known as beyond them. There is no rebirth for them and they abide in [the reality of]Īśvara, in [the world of] Dhruva.8 

The division into Atimārga and Mantramārga appears to be found only in texts belonging to the Mantramārga.9 No Pāśupata or for that matter “Atimārga” text refers to the concept of Atimārga, let alone to Mantramārga. The only excep tion that I am aware of is a medieval Māhātmya about Vārāṇasī, the subject of this paper. 

laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ vāpi tathādhyātmikam eva ca | 

ādadīta yato jñānaṃ taṃ pūrvam abhivādayet || 

The first half of this verse is identical to two pādas in Niśvāsamukha 1.26–1.27ab, where the fivefold division is introduced for the first time: 

śṛṇvantu ṛṣayas sarve pañcadhā yat prakīrtitam | 

laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ vāpi tathādhyātmikam eva ca || 

a[[timārgaṃ ca mantrākhyam]]—| 

For a discussion of this incomplete passage, see Kafle 2015, 21; and pp. 49–53, for further evi dence of the influence of the Manusmṛti on the composition of the Niśvāsamukha. 8 Svacchanda 11.182–184: 

atītaṃ buddhibhāvānām atimārgaṃ prakīrtitam | 

lokātītaṃ tu taj jñānam atimārgam iti smṛtam ||182|| 

lokāś ca paśavaḥ proktāḥ sṛṣṭisaṃhāravartmani | 

teṣām atītās te jñeyā ye ’timārge vyavasthitāḥ ||183||

3 The Atimārga in the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya of the 

Bhairavaprādurbhāva 

For some years now I have been working on a manuscript containing a unique collection of Vārāṇasīmāhātmyas.10 It concerns an old palm-leaf manuscript, currently in the Kaiser library in Kathmandu (Acc. No. 66).11 The manuscript may be dated on palaeographical grounds to the end of the twelfth century CE. It was most probably penned down in Vārāṇasī itself, as suggested by comparison of the old Nāgarī script with that of other manuscripts written in twelfth-century Vārāṇasī, but now likewise surviving in the collections of Nepal.12 It is an extensive but incomplete manuscript: 145 folios survive but the text breaks off in the middle of a long quotation of the Skandapurāṇa. The manuscript consists of Māhātmyas taken from and attributed to a range of Purāṇas, including the Matsyapurāṇa, Nandipurāṇa, Brahmapurāṇa, Liṅga purāṇa, Śivapurāṇa and Skandapurāṇa. Several Māhātmyas can be identified in the present editions of works bearing the same name (most importantly the Māhātmyas of the published Matsyapurāṇa and the early Skandapurāṇa), but quite a few of them are unknown from any other source. The manuscript provides a unique glimpse into the production of Māhātmya literature in early medieval Vārāṇasī. 

The first 13 chapters, covering the first 59 folios, about one third of the sur viving text, contain the complete text of a Māhātmya not known otherwise. It is attributed in the colophons to the Bhairavaprādurbhāva of the Matsya purāṇa, but there are strong grounds to think that this attribution is incorrect and that it was originally intended to belong to the Bhairavaprādurbhāva of the Vāmanapurāṇa instead. My reasons for this assumption are the follow ing: 

– The attributions of Māhātmyas to other Purāṇas are incorrect in several other cases of the manuscript as well. 

– There is no section called Bhairavaprādurbhāva in the surviving text of the Matsyapurāṇa. 

10 See Bisschop 2007 and 2013. 

11 The manuscript has been microfilmed by the NGMPP on reel C 6/3. I also have access to excellent colour photographs kindly provided to me by Harunaga Isaacson. There is also a paper apograph in a private collection, microfilmed as NGMPP E 766/7. 

12 Some comparable manuscripts produced in Vārāṇasī and dated to the twelfth century are: Jayadrathayāmala (NGMPP A 996/3, A 997/1), Bṛhatkālottara (A 43/1), Harivaṃśa (A 27/5), Manusmṛti (C 44/4). The scribe of our manuscript is, however, less neat. The text also abounds in scribal errors. 
 

20 bisschop 

– Colophons in several manuscripts of the Vāmanapurāṇa, critically edited by the Kashiraj Trust, reveal that various chapters from chapter 9 onwards are attributed to the Bhairavaprādurbhāva of the Vāmanapurāṇa.13 

– The narrators of the present Māhātmya and the Vāmanapurāṇa are the same: Nārada and Pulastya. 

– The “Origin of Bhairava(s)” (bhairavaprādurbhāva) is narrated in relation to the destruction of Andhaka by Bhairava in Vāmanapurāṇa 44.30ff. – The eight Bhairavas (aṣṭabhairava) originating from the blood of Andhaka when Śiva strikes him correspond with a set of eight Bhairavas mentioned in our Māhātmya.14 

I therefore conclude that the Māhātmya was originally meant to be included in the Bhairavaprādurbhāva section of the Vāmanapurāṇa. In all likelihood the text was composed by a local pandit in twelfth-century Vārāṇasī, for the description of the town evinces clear connections to the layout of the town around the time when the Gāhaḍavālas were ruling north India and had made Vārāṇasī into their religious capital. It appears to be the work of a Śaiva author who engages with the increasing presence of Vaiṣṇava worship in Vārāṇasī sup ported by the Gāhaḍavāla kings.15 

The Atimārga is referred to towards the end of the first chapter of this Māhā tmya. After Pulastya has told Nārada about the abodes of the eight Bhairavas, 

13 See also Bonazolli 1982. 

14 Vāmanapurāṇa 44.23–38: Vidyārāja (east), Kālarāja (south), Kāmarāja (west), Somarāja (north), Svacchandarāja, Lalitarāja and Vighnarāja. Bhairava himself should be added as the eighth. In VM 1.53–54 seven similar Bhairavas are mentioned: Kālarāja (in Avimukta), Kāmarāja, Saumya, Svacchanda (in Jayantika), Lalita, Vighnarāja (in Kālañjara), and Bhai rava (in Bhṛgutuṅga). The passage is corrupt and requires heavy emendation. I have ten tatively reconstructed the text as follows, but many readings remain doubtful:

kālarājasya ca kṣetraṃ dattaṃ caiva svayaṃbhuvā ||53|| 

kāmarājā tu saumyaś ca svacchandaś ca jayantike|

15 Particularly relevant in this connection is chapter 7 of the Māhātmya. It deals with the north end of the town, which was the centre of Gāhaḍavāla religious activity. This area, referred to in the text as “Brahmapura,” is presented as an area of brahmanical author ity where gifts of gold, land, etc., are practised, as is indeed attested by the Gāhaḍavāla inscriptions, and where Vedic recitation constantly takes place. See Bisschop 2011.

the most important of which is Kālarāja, who resides in Vārāṇasī and is also known as Kālabhairava or Āmardaka,16 he introduces a number of important tīrthas in the town. From VM 1.99 onwards Pulastya zooms in on the cremation ground, the śmaśāna, also called ūṣara (saline ground), where, at the time of destruction, all beings and worlds enter into Bhairava’s mouth. He tells Nārada that it is because of this that the cremation ground grants release.17 He also reports that there is a pond there called Kālodaka, which arose when Kālaru dra was playing on the cremation ground. At that time the Lord taught the observance of the skull (kapālavrata). He chopped off the fifth head of Brahmā, as a consequence of which there arose the holy Pāśupata pond.18 Mahādeva subsequently carries Brahmā’s skull around the world and unites with the cre

mation grounds.19 There he teaches that transmigration results from attach ment (sneha), that attachment comes from desire (rāga), and that attachment is destroyed by indifference (vairāgya). When people attain indifference, their karma is destroyed and they attain unequalled happiness (saukhya).20 He then teaches the following: 

The great tree of transmigration has arisen from the seed of desire. After cutting the tree with the axe of indifference, whose sharp blade is disat tachment, they proceed on the Atimārga.21 

Here the text introduces a term that we do not expect to come across in a Māhātmya. The text continues in the same vein, however, attesting to the appropriation of this significant terminology. The passage is worth quoting in full: 

Engaged in the path of the observance of the skull (Kāpālavratamārga), the Lord wanders, free from attachment, displaying the Lokamārga and the supreme Lokātīta. And the lokas are designated “bound souls,” includ

The reading of pāda d is highly uncertain: it shows syncopation throughout and a mean ingless compound-breaking -m- is inserted. As Harunaga Isaacson has pointed out to me, the image calls to mind Bhagavadgītā 15.3d (= Mahābhārata 6.37.3d): asaṃgaśastreṇa dṛ ḍhena chittvā.

ing gods, demons and men. No one realizes the supreme certainty with respect to knowledge of the self. And except for Śarva, the supreme god, there is no such behaviour of another [god]. No other god has certainty of knowledge. There is no such behaviour anywhere in the world with all its gods. The gods, beginning with Brahmā, also proceed along the Laukikamārga. The God of gods, Virūpākṣa, who is established in the Lokottaramārga, proceeds beyond [the institutes of] sacrifice ( yajña), giving (dāna) and asceticism (tapas). But those sages who are on that path, delighting in the knowledge of the self, also proceed along the Lokottaramārga, abandoning their bodies. And there is no rebirth in this world (iha) for those Pāśupata sages who follow the observance of the skull, they who abide by the Atimārga. For the practitioners of the Ati mārga there is only (kevalam) indifference. Those who have set out on the Atimārga only (kevalā) delight in indifference. Those who die on the saline ground (uṣara) go along that path, but of all saline grounds Vārāṇasī is the best, O sage. And there is no sprouting for those who die there. The body abandoned on the cremation ground merges in the Lord of Time.22

This passage is revealing in several respects. First of all, it is the only known non-Mantramārga source that uses the term Atimārga. Moreover, it does so in a proper Atimārga context: its message is strict asceticism and there is no mention of the Mantramārga at all, neither here nor in the following chap ters of the Māhātmya. As for the identity of the Atimārga in question, the text brings together a number of key terms under one umbrella: Kāpālavratamārga, Lokātīta, Pāśupata, and Atimārga. In appearance it is a form of Kāpālika asceti cism, involving cultivation of indifference (vairāgya) and aiming for death at the cremation ground. This is an old theme in the Pāśupata tradition, harking back to the Pāśupatasūtra itself.23 

There are several hints in the above passage that indicate a relation with the Svacchanda. The Svacchanda, as we have seen earlier, also refers to the division of the Atimārga and, like our passage, stresses that it is Lokātīta (“Beyond the Worlds”). The Vārāṇasīmāhātmya elaborates further on this theme, drawing a clear distinction between the way of the Lord and that of the other gods. The latter are merely followers of the Laukika path, or Lokamārga. 

Moreover, we can identify two textual parallels: 

1. lokāś ca paśavaḥ proktāḥ (Svacchanda 11.183a = VM 1.117a) 

2. kapālavratino ye ca tathā pāśupatāś ca ye | 

sṛṣṭir na vidyate teṣām (Svacchanda 11.184ac) 

≈ 

ye ca pāśupatā viprāḥ kāpālavratadhāriṇaḥ | 

na teṣām udbhavo ’stīha (VM 1.122ac) 

Aside from these textual parallels it is noteworthy that some of the themes that precede the verses on the Atimārga in the Svacchanda are taken up in the passage of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya. Thus, in Svacchanda 11.176 it is stated that those who follow the hetuśāstra “science of reasoning” find no certainty or conviction (niścaya) in matters of Dharma, Artha, Kāma or Mokṣa: dhar mārthakāmamokṣeṣu niścayo naiva jāyate(Svacchanda 11.176cd). The theme of niścaya is taken up in the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya with respect to the “knowledge of the self” (ātmajñāna), which is restricted to Śiva alone. No other god has it.

The last sentence may be translated alternatively as: “he merges in the Lord of Time, but his body is abandoned on the cremation ground.” 

23 The Pāśupata ascetic was supposed to die on the cremation ground. See Pāśupatasūtra 5.30–40. 
 

from mantramārga back to atimārga 25 

Moreover, the Svacchanda also introduces the concept of vairāgya, a key term in the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya, just before its discussion of the Atimārga. The Svacchanda distinguishes several religious traditions on the basis of their char acteristic mental dispositions (buddhibhāva):24 

– Laukika is connected to dharma 

– Pāñcarātra and Vaidika are connected to dharma and jñāna 

– Bauddha and Ārhata are connected to vairāgya 

– Sāṃkhya is connected to jñāna and vairāgya 

– Yoga is connected to jñāna, vairāgya and aiśvarya 

The Atimārga is said to be beyond these mental dispositions.25 Instead of this, the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya passsage rather stresses the importance of vairāgya, along with knowledge of the self (ātmajñāna), as the key to liberation. Al though we can thus trace some influence of the Svacchanda the teaching is put in a new, proper Atimārga perspective. 

The passage also involves some genuine Pāśupata ideals and concepts. The statement that Śiva “proceeds beyond (atītya) [the institutes of] sacrifice ( yajña), giving (dāna) and asceticism (tapas),” instantly calls to mind Pāśupata sūtra 2.15–17, quoted above: atidattam atīṣṭam atitaptaṃ tapas tathā atyāgatiṃ gamayate. Finally, the prominent presence of the word kevala in this passage, which is employed to stress that for the follower of the Atimārga only vairāgya (indifference) remains, can be connected to the technical use of Kevala in the Pāśupata tradition. For the terms Kevalijñāna and Kevalārtha are used as syn onyms for the Pāśupata teaching in several sources.26 

The Māhātmya continues to use the terminology of Atimārga and Loka mārga in the subsequent two chapters. In chapter 2 Śiva returns to Vārāṇasī after he has wandered around with the skull for twelve years. He enters the 

24 Svacchanda 11.179–181:

The list of mental dispositions calls to mind Sāṃkhyakārikā 23:

cremation ground and installs the skull to the north of Kālarāja. When he has completed his observance, he bathes and satiates the sages, gods and ances tors. In this way, it is said, he displays the Lokamārga and sets an example for the people to follow.27 

The logic is illustrated by drawing on a phrase from the Bhagavadgītā: 

Otherwise, if Deva would not display it, the path would be destroyed. The people follow what he sets up as the standard.28 

A tīrtha called Ṛṇamocana appears, provided with three liṅgas. The three liṅgas release from the threefold debt to the gods, the sages and the ancestors.29 In this way the narrative integrates the teachings of the Lokātīta, or Atimārga, and the Lokamārga. Śiva next continues to display more observances. He even gives the Kāpālavrata to Kubera.30

In chapter 3, the apparent contradiction in Śiva’s behaviour is articulated by Brahmā, who says that those who have no faith see the path of the world, viz. the Laukika and Apavargika, on the one hand, and the great path, the Lokottara, on the other, as a contradiction: 

ekataś ca jaganmārgaṃ laukikaṃ cāpavargikam |

But in God the two paths are united. In him there is no contradiction. His ways are inscrutable; only he can unite these contradictions and he does so because he delights in play (krīḍā).31 

4 Concluding Observations 

I started this paper with the observation that the term Atimārga, although certainly useful for referring to the ascetic strand of early Śaivism, appears not to have been used by “Atimārgins” themselves. The term represents, by all accounts, a Mantramārgic perspective on the formation of the Śaiva religion.32 

The Vārāṇasīmāhātmya discussed in this paper is the only exception that I know of in which we do find the term Atimārga—as well as the related term Lokātīta—used outside of a Mantramārgic context. Several observations can be made with reference to the passages of the Vārāṇasīmāhātmya discussed here: 

dhanadasya vrataṃ dattvā kāpālaṃ parameśvaraḥ | 

so ’pi tatra vratī bhūtvā devam ārādhayan sthitaḥ ||20|| 

20a dhanadasya] V1; vanadasya V2 

31 VM 3.7: 

krīḍayā yāni deveśa karmāṇi kuruṣe prabho | 

tāni lokeṣu dṛśyante paramārthapradāni tu || 

32 The same applies mutatis mutandis to terms such as Lokamārga or Laukika. Although Mantramārga sources take the Laukika religion to refer to the merit-making rituals and practices of the Śaiva laity taught in the Śivadharma, the term is not used by the Śiva dharma itself to refer to its own religious practice, which is rather referred to as “Śiva dharma.”

– The VM provides important evidence on traditions relating to Bhairava, in particular attesting to knowledge of the Svacchanda in Vārāṇasī around the twelfth century. 

– The VM integrates the divide between Lokamārga and Atimārga or Lokotta ramārga in a narrative of the origin of several sacred spots in Vārāṇasī and the rituals to be performed there. 

– The VM adopts the term Atimārga within a proper Atimārga context. The ide ology is clearly Atimārgic, representing a mixture of Pāśupata and Kāpālika Śaivism. 

– Finally, and most importantly, in appropriating the term, the Atimārga is pre sented here as the ultimate path of liberation. 

It is striking that the author of the text does not seem to have felt the need to contextualize the Mantramārga from which he has adopted the term in the first place. Although it seems certain that the author had knowledge of the Mantramārga—the influence of the Svacchandabhairava is quite clear— he chose to neglect the Mantramārga entirely. Is this because he considered it irrelevant to the content of the text, which is after all a Māhātmya of Vārāṇasī, or because the Māhātmya represents a different perspective on what it means to be a Śaiva? It certainly testifies to the fact that views on what constituted Śaivism in early-medieval India differed across distinct Śaiva traditions. Much of our understanding today derives from specific textual traditions that only represent one layer of a much broader spectrum of religions oriented around the worship of Śiva that sought to define themselves and claim their place. 

5 Postscript 

After the presentation of my paper at the symposium in Toronto, Professor Sanderson kindly drew my attention to a veiled reference to the Atimārga in the Halāyudhastotra. The text of this stotra is recorded, together with the Mahimnastava and a Narmadāstotra, on an inscription of 1063AD (saṃvat 1120) in the Amareśvara temple at Oṃkāreśvar/Māndhātā.33 The inscription 

33 For an overview of the inscriptions of the Amareśvara temple and the publication of several more hitherto unpublished inscriptions from the temple, including the Narmadā stotra, see Neuss 2013 and 2015. The Halāyudhastotra was first published by P.P. Sub rahmanya Sastri, with an additional note containing the prose part of the inscription by N.P. Chakravarti, in Epigraphia Indica 25 in 1939–1940 (appeared in 1948: Sastri 1948 and Chakravarti 1948). The text of the Halāyudhastotra was constituted on the basis of the inscription and two manuscripts of the stotra from the Madras Government Oriental Manuscripts Library. The inscription was subsequently republished by Mittal 1979, 322– 339, and Trivedi 1989, 604–611.

was written by a Pāśupata, paṃḍita Gāndhadhvaja, while the text itself is said to have been composed by a brahmin named Halāyudha.34 The spiritual lin eage of the engraver of the inscription is recorded in a prose passage at the end of the inscription and mentions the names of several Pāśupata teachers: Bhāvavālmīka → Bhāvasamudra → Bhāvaviriṃci → Supūjitarāśi → Vivekarāśi → Gāndhadhvaja.35 

The Halāyudhastotra is an ornate poem in praise of Śiva. Phyllis Granoff (1993) has introduced and translated several parts of the inscription in an arti cle on the experience of religion in medieval hymns and stories, but the verses that concern us here have not been translated or discussed before. Verses 34–35 contain what appears to be an allusion to the Atimārga: 

The visitation of the wives of the distinguished sages in the Pine Park, the oblation with seed in Fire, the twilight dance: Your behaviour is not rep rehensible.36 O Three-eyed one! The doctrines of the world do not touch those who have left worldly life, having passed far beyondthe path of those whose minds are afflicted by false knowledge. 

The gods all wear gold and jewels as an ornament on their body. You do not even wear gold the size of a berry on your ear or on your hand. The one whose natural beauty, surpassing the path [of the world], flashes on his own body, has no regard for the extraneous ornaments of ordinary men.37 

These verses poetically allude to the distinction between the Lokamārga and Atimārga, although the terms themselves are not used. Significantly, the Halā yudhastotra also makes reference to the term Kevalajñāna, in the first pāda 

34 Sastri (1948, 74) argues that he is identical with Halāyudha the tenth-century author of the Abhidhānaratnamālā and the Kavirahasya. 

35 Chakravarti 1948, 185, lines 51–55. 

36 The verse refers to three key mythological events: Śiva’s visit as a naked ascetic to the Devadāruvana, the emission of his seed into the mouth of Agni leading to the birth of Skanda, and his performance of the twilight dance. 

37 Halāyudhastotra 34–35: 

dārūdyāne dvijavaravadhūpaplavo retasāgnau 

homaḥ sandhyānaṭanam iti te ceṣṭitaṃ naiva duṣṭam | 

[mithyājñānopa]hatamanasāṃ mārgam ullaṅghya dūraṃ

of verse 3: “Victorious is the One God, Śiva, the embodiment of the Kevala jñāna.”38 As mentioned above, Kevalajñāna may be used as a synonym for the Pāśupata teaching. A Pāśupata background of the Halāyudhastotra is further more indicated by the prose part of the inscription, which records the names of several Pāśupata teachers connected to the Amareśvara temple. The inscription also makes reference to the liṅgas at five famous Pāśupata centres: Avimukta, Kedāra, Oṃkāra, Amara (Amareśvara) and Mahākāla (Ujjain).39 All in all the Amareśvara inscription merits further study as a testimony of the survival of Pāśupata Śaivism in north India in the medieval period.

### 2 Why Are the Skull-Bearers (Kāpālikas) Called Soma? 

Judit Törzsök 

1 The Question 

The Kāpālikas or Skull-Bearers, who formed the third group of the Atimārga, alongside the Pāśupatas and the Lākulas,1 were perhaps the most notorious Śaiva ascetics of classical India. They were known for their cremation ground rituals and for wandering around with a skull for an alms bowl. The skull (kapāla), their most conspicuous attribute, also provided their name. But the Kāpālikas are also designated as Somasiddhāntins, “Those of the Soma Doc trine,”2 or the “Soma People with the Skull.”3 These appellations seem to have been of some importance because their initiation names also included or ended in -soma in most cases (e.g. Satyasoma, Devasomā,4 Somibhaṭṭāraka5). What was this Somasiddhānta, doctrine of Soma or teaching about (the) Soma? 

1 Concerning these distinctions within the Atimārga, the term Atimārga itself and the Kāpā likas as an Atimārgic group, see Sanderson 1988 and 2006. Professor Sanderson has published several ground-breaking papers focussing on the Kāpālikas. This paper, inspired by his discov eries, is dedicated to him. 

2 This term figures in the Pauṣkaravṛtti of Jñānaprakāśācārya, IFP transcript no. 110, p. 591. They are also called “Knowers of the Doctrine of Soma” (somasiddhāntavedinaḥ in Sarvajñānottara 14.4, edited by Goodall), which could be corrupt for somasiddhāntavādinaḥ, “Those who Pro fess the Doctrine of Soma.” 

3 Or “Skull-Bearers Who are the Soma People,” somajanakāpālī in Jayadrathayāmala 3.35.33c. There may be an attempt here to distinguish the skull-bearing Soma ascetics from other skull bearers, such as those who follow a Bhairava tantra or a Kaula tantra. 

4 The names of the two Kāpālikas in the Mattavilāsaprahasana. 

5 The name or title of a Kāpālika in the Kannada inscription of ancient Koḷḷipāke, Andhra, in 1050CE, cited by Lorenzen 1989, 233–234. This Kāpālika is said to be mukha-kamala vinirggata-Sōmasiddhāntābhiprāya- “devoted to the meaning of Somasiddhānta issued from the lotus mouth [?of Śiva]” (Lorenzen’s translation). While this implies that the Somasi ddhānta or Soma teaching was ultimately considered Śaiva revelation (if we accept Loren zen’s suggestion of supplying Śiva), it does not tell us anything about its nature and content, nor about the meaning of the word soma itself. The wording suggests, nevertheless, that it is not Śiva who is called Soma.

In what way was it typical of Kāpālikas? Why did -soma figure in their initi ation names? 

I am afraid I will not be able to offer conclusive answers to most of these puzzling questions. However, I propose to look at a few passages about the Kāpālikas which may shed more light on what the word or name Soma pos sibly meant for them. 

Now I am not the first to ask this question. An ingenious answer can already be found in commentaries on the Prabodhacandrodaya of Kṛṣṇamiśra (itself dating from 1041–1073): commentators understand soma to mean sa-umā, i.e. “with/accompanied by Umā,” with reference to the fact that a male Kāpālika normally had a consort, just as Śiva is accompanied by Umā.6 

This understanding seems rather forced. Female Kāpālikas or tantric con sorts are not normally called Umā and this interpretation does not seem to figure at all in earlier sources. It also fails to explain how we are to understand the element -soma in female initiation names (such as Devasomā), in which it cannot mean “with Umā/with a female consort.” Nevertheless, the sa-umā explanation of soma higlights an important trait of the Kāpālikas, namely that they were exceptional in the Atimārga in that male and female initiates per formed rituals together7 and were obviously not required to maintain celibacy, unlike (most probably) the ascetics of the Pāśupata and Lākula groups. 

David Lorenzen has proposed a different hypothesis.8 He identified a Kāpā lika called Kāpāli-śarman in a (probably) sixth century inscription from Kar nataka. This Kāpāliśarman is said to have performed vedic Soma sacrifices. Lorenzen therefore suggests that Kāpālikas were perhaps dedicated vedic Soma sacrificers. 

This is also rather unlikely, for at least two reasons. First, Kāpāliśarman may not have been a Kāpālika in the strict sense, for his name does not include Soma and does not appear to conform to other kinds of Kāpālika names either.9 Sec ond, nowhere else is it said that Kāpālikas performed vedic Soma sacrifices. However, as we shall see they took interest in particular ‘essences’ other than the vedic Soma, and in a metaphorical sense, perhaps did perform their own kind of Soma ritual. 

6 For this and some other references to Kāpālikas associated with some Soma doctrine, see Lorenzen 1991, 83. 

7 Two well-known literary examples are the Kāpālika man with his partner in the Matta vilāsaprahasana and the Kāpālika couple in the fifth act of Bhavabhūti’s Mālatīmādhava. 8 Lorenzen1989, 235 citing K.V. Ramesh Inscriptions of theWestern Gangas 70–74, no.19, inscrip tion from Bangalore district, 6th cent.? (sic!). 

9 Since Kapālin/Kāpālika can denote Śiva/Bhairava himself, the name could simply mean “Pro tected by Śiva/Bhairava” without being markedly Kāpālika. 
 

why are the skull-bearers (kāpālikas) called soma? 35 2 Somaśarman and the Moon Image 

We reach firmer ground when we turn to the often-cited Malhar or Junwani copper plate inscription (647CE, see Bakker 2000 and 2015; Sanderson 2012), which lists a lineage of Kāpālikas as identified by Sanderson. This mentions Somaśarman and the “line of tradition starting with Soma” (continuing later with Rudrasoma, Tejasoma, Bhīmasoma). It is in Somaśarman’s house that Lakulīśa, founder of the Pāśupata order, is said to have been born as an incar nation (avatāra) of Śiva. Lakulīśa was then initiated into or through the mahā vrata, perhaps by Somaśarman himself: 

[…] adhunā kali-kālam āsādya śrīmal-Lakulīśa-nātho ’vatīrya Somaśarmā khya-brāhmaṇa-kule jātaḥ mahāvrate[ te?]na dīkṣito jagad-indus tenāpi Musalīśas tataḥ Somādi-pāramparya-krameṇa sthānaguru-śrī-Rudraso ma-praśiṣya-śrī-Tejasoma-śiṣyebhyaḥ śrīmad-Bhīmasoma-pādebhyaḥ […]

[…] reaching the present Kali age, the venerable Lord Lakulīśa took up an incarnation and was born in the family of a brahmin called Somaśarman. He was initiated into the Great Observance by him (?) [and became] the Moon of the World. Then by him, Musalīśa [was initiated], then, by the unbroken tradition starting with Soma, the local Master Rudrasoma, his disciple Tejasoma, whose pupil is the venerable Bhīmasoma […] 

Before examining the question of Soma and related issues, I would like to point out some details concerning the word mahāvrata or Great Observance. Lakulīśa and others were most probably initiated into the mahāvrata (mahā vrate) and not with/by the mahāvrata (mahāvratena), for this observance is not known to be used as a rite of initiation in any Śaiva system.10 

By the beginning of the seventh century, the mahāvrata certainly referred to the ritualized mimesis of Śiva’s expiation for cutting off Brahmā’s fifth head. 

10 This follows the conjecture proposed by Isaacson, although the reading of mahāvratena is of course grammatically acceptable. However, it is also possible that the instrumental mahāvratena was understood to stand for the locative, and that no additional instrumen tal tena was intended. In this case, it is not expressed that Somaśarman initiates Lakulīśa, although it may again be implied. Bakker (2015,143) opts for the instrumental, but assumes that this only implies a Pāśupata affiliation of Lakulīśa.

According to this well-known story, Śiva must wander with a skull he uses as an alms bowl, for he has committed the sin of killing a brahmin, i.e. Brahmā. Wandering with a skull for twelve years is in fact the expiatory observance for killing a brahmin as prescribed in the Dharmasūtras,11 but there it is not yet called mahāvrata. Although most attestations of the mythological story come from late puranic sources, the myth already figures in the (original) Skandapu rāṇa (chapters 5–7),12 dated around the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh century. 

Moreover, the Kāpālika Satyasoma in the Mattavilāsaprahasana (600– 625CE) mentions that it was thanks to the practice of the mahāvrata that his Lord bearing the crescent moon on his head was purified of his sin, which he had committed by cutting Brahmā’s head.13 The verse clearly identifies Śiva’s mahāvrata as the expiation rite for a brahmin slayer, and also shows that Kāpā likas were practising the mahāvrata in imitation of Śiva. In fact, the Skandapu rāṇa (6.5–6) also seems to associate this observance with sanguinary practices, such as those of the Kāpālikas. For when Śiva-Nīlalohita starts looking for suit able alms, Viṣṇu tries to fill his kapāla-bowl with his own blood—a very odd, distinctively Kāpālika notion of what alms should consist of. 

Now returning to the question of the Soma lineage: Lakulīśa, whether he was indeed initiated by Somaśarman or not, is said to have been born in Somaśar 

11 See e.g. Baudhāyanadharmasūtra 2.1.2–3: bhrūṇahā dvādaśa samāḥ kapālī khaṭvāṅgī ga rdabhacarmavāsā araṇyaniketanaḥ śmaśāne dhvajaṃ śavaśiraḥ kṛtvā kuṭīṃ kārayet | tām āvaset | saptāgārāṇi bhaikṣaṃ caran svakarmācakṣāṇas tena prāṇān dhārayet |. “A man who has killed a learned Brahmin should do the following for twelve years. He should carry a skull and a post from a bed-frame; wear the skin of an ass; reside in the wilder ness; and, using the head of a corpse as his flag, get a hut built in a cemetery and live in it. He should maintain himself by begging almsfood from seven houses while pro claiming his crime.” Translation by Olivelle (2000, 241). See Gautamadharmasūtra 22.4: khaṭvāṅgakapālapāṇir vā dvādaśa saṃvatsarān brahmacārī bhaikṣāya grāmaṃ praviśet | karmācakṣāṇaḥ. “Or else, for twelve years he should live a chaste life and, carrying the post from a bed-frame and a skull, enter a village only to beg for food while proclaiming his crime.” Translation by Olivelle (2000, 175), who remarks in the notes to this passage that khaṭvāṅga must mean skull-staff (a staff topped with a skull) rather than the post of a bed-frame. Brick 2012, however, shows convincingly that the post of a bed-frame was probably intended at the time of the Dharmasūtras. See also Yājñavalkyasmṛti 3.243: śi raḥkapālī dhvajavān bhikṣāśī karma vedayan | brahmahā dvādaśābdāni mitabhuk śuddhim āpnuyāt ||. 

12 The version related here replaces the figure of Śiva with one of his ectypes, Nīlalohita. On this narrative device, which is used here to distance the supreme deity from sanguinary practices, see Granoff 2006.

man’s house. According to the inscription, the Kāpālikas belong to the spiritual lineage starting with Soma, and their initiation names therefore seem to be derived from the founder’s name. The name Soma can naturally be understood as a short form of Somaśarman. Thus, Kāpālikas are the Soma people because they follow the tradition started by Somaśarman. 

Our investigation could stop here. For the name Soma seems to be suffi ciently explained in this way. However, several issues remain unexplained. It is not clear whether Somaśarman was a historical person. If he did exist, it still remains uncertain whether he was indeed the founder of the Kāpālika move ment or whether Kāpālikas claimed retrospectively that he was their founder. Thus, we cannot take it for granted that the Soma name indeed derives from him. 

For this reason,I suggest we look at some other details more closely. Lakulīśa, after his initiation in Somaśarman’s house, is called the Moon of the Word ( jagadindu) in the inscription. There are at least three interpretations of jaga dindu: 

1. A natural understanding of the moon as having cool rays. Thus, “Moon [whose cooling rays have calmed the fever] of the world” (translation by Sanderson 2012). 

2. Moon on the earth, i.e. having a lunar-white body (sitāṅga) on account of the bathing with ashes (Bakker 2000; 2015, 153). This understanding is backed up by the description of Lakulīśa in the Skandapurāṇa as being white-bodied when covered with ashes.14 

3. Without going against either of these interpretations, both of which are plausible, I propose as a tentative hypothesis that, in addition, the expres sion jagadindu may indirectly allude to a Kāpālika affiliation if we under stand this in the sense of *Jagatsoma, a compound suggestive of a Kāpā lika initiation name.15 This may imply two things. First, it is possible that 

14 It must also be noted that the Skandapurāṇa (180.10) calls the mere ash-bath a/the great observance (mahāvrata). It also says that Somaśarman with his family received Lakulīśa’s grace when he visited them in their house, and that they were given yogasiddhi(167.125ff.). The Skandapurāṇa appears to represent an earlier(?)/pāśupata version of the story. (Cf. also Bakker 2015, 143ff.) Bakker 2015, 143–144 (note 442) also proposes that the Soma name suggests a parallel with the Soma-vaṃśa dynastic affiliation of Mahāśivagupta. However, the Soma name figures elsewhere, in seventh-century South India in the names of Kāpā likas of the Mattavilāsaprahasana, where no such parallel can be assumed; such implica tions therefore seem unlikely. 

15 I cannot cite any initiate with this name, and I do not intend to suggest that Jagatsoma (or Jagadindu) was necessarily an actual initiation name. The word may, nevertheless, be con strued in the same manner as Kāpālika initiation names such as Satyasoma, Devasoma, 
 

38 törzsök 

the Kāpālikas derive their name Soma/Moon from Lakulīśa, too, who is considered the Moon of the World. Second, the sequence of events as presented in the inscription may also suggest that Lakulīśa himself came to be called the “Moon of the World” (suggestive of a Kāpālika initiation name) because of Somaśarman. Whatever is the case, the lunar image is emphatically present in the names or epithets of both alleged founders as well as in the initiation names of Kāpālikas. 

Now the naming of Lakulīśa as the “Moon,” in the manner of a Kāpālika, may be more than a coincidence. It may well be understood as an attempt to present Lakulīśa as a true Kāpālika, perhaps via his association with another “Moon person,” Somaśarman. Or, from another point of view, by presenting Lakulīśa as a Kāpālika initiate, the text may suggest the preeminence of the Kāpālikas over the other two Atimārga groups, the Pāśupatas and the Lākulas. 

But no matter how we understand the hidden agenda of the above inscrip tion (if there is one), it is undeniable that the Kāpālikas’ initiation name ending in -soma is understood to recall both their founder(s)’ name and the image of the moon. 

3 The Moon and the Nectar of Immortality (amṛta) in the Skull(s) 

The moon also forms an important element of Pāśupata yogic practices. As we learn from the Skandapurāṇa (179.28ff.), as pointed out by Bakker (2015, 141), their “accomplishment in yoga” ( yogasiddhi) comes about through a process of withdrawing the senses until the practitioner can see a lunar disc (soma maṇḍala) in his heart. From the moonlight within his body, yogic powers, omniscience and the like arise. These powers include being immune to disease (vyādhayo nāviśanty enam) and possessing a divine body (divyaṃ vapuḥ). 

Speaking of the moon and practices related to its visualization, the Kāpālikas appear to share the pan-Indian idea that it also contains the nectar of immor tality.16 In one passage of Bhavabhūti’s Mālatīmādhava (5.23) an invocation is addressed to the fierce goddess, Cāmuṇḍā, which describes her violenttāṇḍava dance. The verse is uttered by the two Kāpālikas in the cremation ground. Dur ing this dance, the goddess inadvertently slashes the moon, from which the 

etc., which can be interpreted as “Moon of Truth,” “Moon of the Gods,” etc. What I pro pose is that this parallelism of names ending with “-moon” seems too remarkable to be accidental. 

16 This idea perhaps also contributed to the spread of various visualization practices cen tered around the image of the moon.

amṛta flows downward and fills her garland of skulls. The skulls, thus resur rected, start emitting a loud and harsh laughter.17 

This image is not particularly significant in itself. However, it seems that Kāpālikas were particularily interested in a special sort of ambrosia. In their quest for the amṛta, they probably joined a large range of ascetics or yogins of the period who, in various ways and through different practices, all sought the same magical essence.18 So what exactly was the amṛta of the Kāpālikas and how did they expect to find or produce it? 

4 What is the Kāpālikas’ Nectar (amṛta/soma)? 

We now turn again to the Kāpālikas of the Mālatīmādhava.19 At one point in the story (5.2), the female practitioner mentions that she can extract the so called “five nectars” (pañcāmṛta), which are five vital essences of the human body. They have a powerful, invigorating effect (as one would expect from such a nectar), so much so that the female Kāpālika can fly a great distance in a few seconds.

18 Obtaining the nectar of immortality and, thanks to it, an immortal physical body is the main goal of the haṭhayogic and Nath yogic traditions; see Mallinson 2007 and Ondračka 2007. Mallinson (2015, 120ff.) proposes that there may have been an early, nonsectarian tradition of ascetics, the precursor of what is later known as haṭhayoga, for which he finds traces already in the Pali Canon. 

19 I understand, in the context of this paper, the Kāpālikas of this play to represent the Kāpālikas of the Atimārga here under discussion. They could alternatively be considered skull-bearing tantric practitioners, as Hatley (2007,143ff.) argues on the basis of numerous parallels with prescriptions found in the Brahmayāṃala and elsewhere. In fact, one could interpret the evidence in two ways: either take the Kāpālikas of the play to belong to the Atimārga, which has strong influence on later Śaiva tantras of the Vidyāpīṭḥa, or one can take them to be tantric skull-bearers of the Vidyāpīṭha, who certainly inherit much from the Kāpālikas of the Atimārga. In either case, the practices described in the play may well reflect what is a ritual core common to both the Kāpālikas of the Atimārga and those of the Vidyāpīṭha. For this reason, in the context of the present argument, I understand the Mālatīmādhava’s Kāpālikas to be representative of Atimārga Kāpālikas or their practices, even if this identity remains uncertain.

The extraction of the five nectars (pañcāmṛtākarṣaṇa), as well as other, Kāpālika-type cremation ground practices, also figure in the Brahmayāmala, as Hatley (2007, 143ff.) points out. The five substances are not listed in a systematic way, but they usually seem to include these four: semen (śukra), blood (rakta), fat/marrow (medas) and sneha (see also the entry pañcām ṛta in Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. III). Other sources also describe Kāpālikas as making use of various parts of the human body. Kāpālikas use human flesh (mahāmāṃsa), brain (mastiṣka), intestines (antra), fat (vasā) and blood (kīlāla) in ritual, and drink alcohol (surā), according to Prabodhacandrodaya 3.13. 

In addition to the extraction of the five nectars, the Brahmayāmala also includes rituals which make particular use of human body parts and are to be performed in the cremation ground. A notable series of chapters prescribing such rites forms a small cluster around chapter 46. Since the practices pre scribed have close affinity to the kinds of ritual attributed to Kāpālikas, these chapters could well be adaptations or assimilations of originally Kāpālika ritu als,20 although this remains a hypothesis in the absence of any surviving Kāpā lika scriptures. It is also notable that the Brahmayāmala describes possession (āveśa) by Bhairava, stating that through possession one obtains Bhairavahood; and possessionwas, according to numerous Śaiva sources about the subject, the way in which Kāpālikas claimed to attain final liberation.21 

Now in chapter 46 of the Brahmayāmala, much like the Kāpālikas, the prac titioner makes ritual use of human flesh, hair (keśa), bones (asthi), body fluids (picu), particularly blood (rakta), and intestines (antra); moreover, he offers and drinks alcohol (madirā). 

It is in this chapter that the amṛta comes to fore again in ritual. For the main subject here is amṛtamanthāna, the churning and drinking of the amṛta. The Sādhaka is to make pots from clay obtained from the cremation ground, contruct a sacrificial pavilion from bones, and place the ritual cauldron upon a corpse. He is required to churn a mixture including mahāpicu (sexual flu ids or various other human fluids?) using a piece of bone as the churning stick, with a rope made of human hair, intestines and skin (?). The cauldron is identified with Aghorī and the churning stick with Bhairava. In this rite, the Sādhaka re-enacts the cosmic churning of the ocean, and the same miracu lous objects emerge (the Kaustubha gem, etc.) as the gods brought forth dur ing the primordial churning. Then the terrifying goddess, Caṇḍikā, receives

homage. She appears in the form of Aghorī, offering the Sādhaka a boon. The practitioner chooses to drink the milk of Aghorī’s breasts. The chapter ends by saying that having produced the amṛta and having drunk left and right (probably meaning having drunk Aghorī’s milk from both breasts), one becomes omniscient, Bhairava himself. Although Aghorī’s milk and the amṛta that the Sādhaka prepares are not identified, they could well be the same thing.22

What emerges from this chapter is that the preparation of the nectar of immortality was also an important way in which one could obtain Bhairava hood. Moreover, it involved worship of a fearsome goddess, Caṇḍikā or Aghorī, which again recalls the Kāpālikas in the Mālatīmādhava, who worship Cā muṇḍā. 

But was the bodily amṛta the only nectar the Kāpālikas collected and con sumed? 

5 Alcohol, Immortality and Soma 

The Kāpālikas were also known for their use of alcohol in ritual. The Prabodha candrodaya (3.20 and prose) presents a Kāpālika rite of initiation, in the course of which the Kāpālika offers alcohol to the initiands and calls it amṛta, for, once again, this releases someone from the bondages of this world and of the state of being a bound soul. In this sense, amṛta is not just a simple metaphor denot ing a precious or delicious liquid. It is a genuine nectar of immortality, for it actually makes one immortal by bestowing final release, mokṣa.23 

In a more satirical way, the Kāpālikas’ alcohol is also treated as their equiva lent to the vedic Soma. The Kāpālika in the Mattavilāsaprahasana cries out as follows when he sees a pub: 

My darling, look. This pub resembles the vedic sacrificial ground. For its signpost resembles the sacrificial pillar; in this case alcohol is the Soma, drunkards are the sacrificial priests, the wine glasses are the special cups for drinking Soma, the roasted meat and other appetizers are the fire obla tions, the drunken babblings are the sacrificial formulae, the songs are the Sāman-hymns, the pitchers are the sacrificial ladles, thirst is the fire and the owner of the pub is the patron of the sacrifice.24

why are the skull-bearers (kāpālikas) called soma? 43 

Nobody would assume from this passage that the Kāpālikas were Soma sacrificers—the comic effect intended is readily evident. It is nevertheless interesting that, once again, the Kāpālikas are presented as having a special nectar of their own, whether it is called amṛta or Soma, and that the ritual significance of this nectar may be, it seems, comparable to the Soma of vedic ritual. 

6 Inventors of a New Nectar (soma/amṛta)? Or Simply ‘the Best?’ 

From the passages looked at here, no firm conclusion can be drawn as to why the Kāpālikas included the word Soma in their initiation names and what exactly they meant by “the teaching of or about Soma” (Somasiddhānta). The most readily explicable case is found in the Junwani copper plate inscrip tion, which associates the Soma name with the name of their alleged founder, Somaśarman. It is, nevertheless, possible that Kāpālikas identified Somaśa rman as their founder only retrospectively and that this derivation of Soma from Somaśarman is secondary. 

Conveniently, Soma as a proper name is also one of Śiva’s names,25 although it does not necessary imply that he is accompanied by Umā (sa-umā). Soma is probably used metaphorically for Śiva, just as it is used for other gods such as Viṣṇu or Kubera. In any case, somasiddhānta can accordingly simply mean “Śiva’s doctrine.” However, as a rather generic appellation of the god’s teaching, it seems unlikely to designate the Kāpālika doctrine in particular. 

Soma, meaning “moon,” and more particularly the nectar of immortality the moon is supposed to contain, is another possible explanation. Various kinds of nectar (amṛta/Soma), whether alcohol or essences of the human body, appear to be in the focus of attention in Kāpālika rituals. The vital essences in par ticular were considered to have an invigorating effect that provided Kāpālikas with the magical power they were apparently famous for. Concoctions of the vital essences were probably thought to bestow omniscience and Bhairava hood. Whether it was really this nectar or these nectars that were at the origin of the name Soma is impossible to tell; but whatever the case may be, the bod ily nectar of the vital essences was most probably a crucial element of Kāpālika doctrine and practice.26

Given this rather wide range of possibilities, it is possible that the Kāpālikas themselves intended to make full use the natural polysemy of the word Soma, although it is less likely that such polysemy was intended from the very begin ning. 

Finally, to add one more possible interpretation: Soma at the end of a com pound can also mean “chief, principal, the best.”27 In this sense, one could understand the Kāpālika names to imply that they considered themselves sim ply the best Śaivas around.

### 3 Dressing for Power
Dressing for Power: On vrata, caryā, and vidyāvrata in the Early Mantramārga, and on the Structure of the Guhyasūtra of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā 

Dominic Goodall 

If, twenty years ago, you had read most of the literature published before the 1990s about the Śaivasiddhānta, you would probably have received the impres sion that this was primarily a South Indian movement, whose scriptures, called āgamas, were divided into four sections, or pādas, devoted to ritual (kriyā), doctrine ( jñāna), yoga and pious conduct (caryā). The first two of these four sections, the kriyā-pāda and the jñāna-pāda, you would have learnt, were the most important, the kriyāpāda being devoted to describing the rituals practised in the Śaiva temples of the Tamil-speaking area, and the jñānapāda (or vidyā pāda) being devoted to teaching and defending a strictly dualist system that presents an ontological ladder of thirty-six tattvas, but that recognises three irreducible ontological categories: pati, paśu and pāśa. That is to say: the Lord (pati), bound souls (paśu), and the bonds that bind them (pāśa), namely Mat ter, karman and an innate impurity called mala or āṇava-mala. 

Each one of these pieces of received wisdom has been challenged by the dis coveries of the last two decades, so that we now know that none of the above propositions actually holds true for the earliest strata of the religion to which surviving primary literature can give us access. A great many of those discov eries are those of Alexis Sanderson and the students to whom for decades he devoted much of his time and energy. 

Of course it is wide reading of a very broad corpus of published and unpub lished sources that has gradually revealed to us quite a different picture of the early phases of the religion. But if one were to single out any one text for its importance in expanding our knowledge of the early history of the Mantra mārga, it would probably be the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā. 

Ten years ago, hardly any aspect of the text had been explored in print, but, thanks in part to the spotlight of the Franco-German ‘Early Tantra’ project, which between 2008 and 2011 focussed the minds of many people present at the Toronto symposium on the Niśvāsa and on its relation to other early tantric literature, parts of the work have been commented upon in an array of publica tions. The first major arcticle actually predates the ‘Early Tantra’ project, and is,

of course, by Professor Sanderson himself: it is his study of the Lākulas (2006). Apart from the first volume of the collaborative edition and translation, cov ering the earliest three books of the Niśvāsa—the Mūlasūtra, Uttarasūtra and Nayasūtra—there are now substantial articles on, for instance, the evolution of the system of tattvas that can be traced as it gradually takes shape within the Niśvāsa-corpus (Goodall 2016), and on the lengthy grimoires of magical rites contained in theGuhyasūtra that are similar in style and content to those found in Buddhist kriyātantra works, and most strikingly similar to the those in the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa (Goodall and Isaacson 2016). 

Now that the earliest three books of the Niśvāsa are published at last, and now that the introductory book, the Niśvāsamukhatattvasaṃhitā, has been thoroughly examined in a doctoral thesis defended this year at the University of Leiden by Nirajan Kafle (2015*), what remains is the largest book of them all: the Guhyasūtra. The ninth-century manuscript of the corpus (NGMPP Reel No. A 41/14) comprises 114 folios, and all of the hitherto edited works together cover only the first 40 of those. The remaining 74 folios give us the text of the Guhyasūtra. Here is a very brief outline of the structure of its eighteen chapters: 

A. Sādhana 

Ch. 1 personality-types of sādhakas and types of liṅgas that may be used for siddhi. 

Ch. 2 liṅgapratiṣṭhā. 

Ch. 3 preparations for sādhana, prognosticatory rites, vratas, procedures for attaining certain siddhis. 

B. Cosmography 

Chs. 4–7 a lengthy cosmography (prakriyājñāna). 

Ch. 8 a variant form of dīkṣā in the form of worship of a series of maṇḍalas peopled by deities of the different levels of the cosmos (prakriyāyāga). 

C. Other Mantra-systems 

Finally, the use, primarily for magical powers, of mantra-systems other than those given in the earlier three sūtras, namely 

a) Chs. 9–11 The vyomavyāpin. 

b) Chs. 12–14 The five brahmamantras. 

Ch. 15 Long forms of their aṅgamantras. 

c) Chs. 16–18 A ten-syllable mantra called vidyā. 

The Guhyasūtra is somewhat like a series of appendices to the earlier sūtras, containing more detailed accounts of some topics that have already been cov

ered (cosmography), but also entirely new subjects (new mantras) or treat ments of subjects that have hitherto only been alluded to, notably the acqui sition of siddhis. As I have tried to indicate with the overarching titles (A, B, C) in the brief summary above, I think that it can be said that chapters 1 to 3 have a certain sort of unity because they cover the acquisition of magical powers in much greater detail than we see in earlier layers of the text: the first chapter gives information about sādhakas, then stresses the importance of the liṅga for attaining siddhis, after which, in chapter 2, the installation of liṅgas is covered, and then in the third chapter we return to the preparations for sādhana and finally the procedures to be followed. Chapters 4–7 then give us a very detailed account of the Śaiva cosmos, the higher reaches of which have been further expanded and embroidered upon since the composition of the earlier sūtras of the text.1 This is undertaken because dīkṣā involves purg ing the soul of the fruits of karman that would need to be experienced—and thus expended—through every layer of the Śaiva universe. Using the same cosmography, chapter 8 describes an alternative dīkṣā involving the worship of maṇḍalas representing successive layers of the universe, and it then con tains a number of add-on discussions that suggest, it seems to me, that the text once drew to a close at that point, as we shall see below. What follow, tak ing us up to the end of the Guhyasūtra, are three distinct textual layers each devoted to introducing an extra mantra-system, namely 1) that of the 81-word vyomavyāpin, 2) that of the brahmamantras, and 3) that of the ten-syllable vidyā. To each of these is attached a grimoire of magical recipes (kalpa). 

Turning to the conclusion of chapter 8, I think that we can see from the sum mary given below that it reads like a series of codas. Verse 105 gives a clear statement of what we are supposed to have learnt from the preceding chap ters, and it is followed immediately by remarks about the persons to whom these teachings may and may not be submitted, a typical closing device. Tagged on to this, from verse 116 onwards, is a treatment of religious suicide, again a theme suitable to the conclusion of a work of scripture. The final section, from verse 125, is introduced by Devī’s question about the status of rival religious tra ditions. In answer, Śiva explains that He and Devī, as consonants and vowels, are the source of all language, and that they are the source of all the universe in that they are to be identified with the various tattvas from which all else evolves. 

1 A full examination of this embroidery will have to await the publication of the relevant parts of the Guhyasūtra, but some idea of its extent and nature may be gained from the table on pp. 290–293 of Goodall, Sanderson and Isaacson 2015 and from the surrounding annotation, as well as from Goodall 2016. 
 

50 goodall Summary of the conclusion of Guhyasūtra 8:2 

8.88–89 Devī asks how an initiate may foretell his own death. 

8.90–98 Śiva recounts signs of death. 

8.99–104 Activities that can be done under particular asterisms that grant release [from death?]. 

8.105 Summary of teachings from chapter 4 up to this point in chapter 8. 

8.106–110 Those to whom one should and should not transmit this knowledge. 

8.111–114b The 4 means of liberation: dīkṣā, jñāna, yoga, caryā. 

8.114c–115 One should transmit this only to someone worthy. 

8.116–117 Devī asks about religious suicide. 

8.118–122 Śiva deprecates death in tīrthas for initiates; he teaches instead 5 varieties of a ‘razor’-mantra for suicide by japa. 

8.123 Increasing length of life by yogic dhāraṇās. 

8.124 The supreme Śaiva knowledge, without which one cannot be liber ated, has been taught! 

8.125–127 Devī asks about the fate of those who follow rival religions. 8.128–133 Śiva explains that He and Devī, as the consonants and vowels of the alphabet, are the source of all linguistic expression (vāṅ 

mayam) and of all that has evolved (vikārāḥ). 

8.134–136 The mūla-mantra is a panacea (mṛtasañjīvanī). 

8.137–138 Śiva and Pārvatī are parents of everything in that they are respectively these tattvas: puruṣa and prakṛti; kāla and niyati; īśvara and māyā+vidyā; sadāśiva and kalā. 

8.139–140 They are also respectively [supreme] Śiva and His Will (icchā). 8.141 Those who do not know the navātman, who are devoid of dīkṣā and jñāna, who do not know the mūla, do not attain the highest state. 

2 Much of this conclusion has, by the way, been borrowed and adapted into the Niśvāsakārikā, which seems itself like another series of addenda that further modify and extend the teach ings of the sūtras of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā. Thus Guhyasūtra 8.88–89 and 8.92–104 have been reworked to produce chapter 21 of the jñānakāṇḍa of the Niśvāsakārikā (T. 17, pp. 131– 133; T. 127, pp. 36–38); and Guhyasūtra 8.125–136 have been reworked to form the beginning of chapter 20 (23 in T. 127) of the jñānakāṇḍa of the Niśvāsakārikā (T. 17, pp. 122–124; T. 127, pp. 231–233). The chapter continues, at least in T. 17, for a further 32 verses on rival notions of liberation and methods for attaining it.

We may remark in passing that a noteworthy feature of this final passage is that the text takes no clearly defined position on the debate between dualism, which was to become a defining characteristic of classical mainstream Said dhāntika doctrine, and non-dualism: it seems as though this debate had not yet caught the interest and attention of Śaiva thinkers. Here is the passage in question: 

ahaṃ pumāṃs tvaṃ prakṛti niyati puna[[r eva ca]] 

niya---[2] kālarūpī maheśvaraḥ 8.137 

tvam māyā ca tathā vidyā aham punas tatheśvaraḥ 

sadāśiva ahan devi tvañ caturdhā kaleśvarī 8.138 

īśitvāc ca vaśitvāc ca sarvajñatvāc ca nityaśaḥ 

śāntatvān niṣkalatvāc ca samatvāc ca ahaṃ śivaḥ 8.139 

mama icchā na hanyā tvaṃ tvaṃ hi śaktibalodayā 

tvatsūtañ ca jagat sarvaṃ śivadā sadanugrahe 8.140 

I am puruṣatattva and you are prakṛti and also niyati; … Maheśvara is Time; you are Māyā and Vidyā, while I am Īśvara-tattva. I, O goddess, am Sadāśiva [and] you are mistress of the 4 kalās. (137–138) 

Because I rule, I control, I am omniscient, because I am permanently at rest, without division and in equilibrium, I am Śiva. (139) 

You are my Will, not to be crossed, for you are the one from whom the power of the śaktis arises! 

The whole universe has sprung from you; You bestow Śiva-nature, O you of true compassion! (140) 

Having proposed an identification of the principal layers of redaction that are detectable in the Guhyasūtra, I should like now to skip back to the verses in the conclusion of chapter 8 that speak about those to whom the teachings may and may not be transmitted, since these verses bear both upon the themes that structure the work and upon the subject of caryā. For, slipped into the middle of that section, beginning in verse 8.111, is a short sequence of verses that make the claim that the teachings of the text comprise four independently salvific parts: dīkṣā, jñāna, yoga and caryā. 

etad buddhvā na dātavyaṃ śivadevāmṛtam param 8.110 

dīkṣājñānena yogena caryayā ca yathākramam 

pratyekaśaḥ śivāvāptis tantre ’smin pārameśvare 8.111 

dīkṣayā sukaraṃ mokṣaṃ yad gurus sādhayet sadā

52 goodall 

---[f. 72r] te mX yo XX(?) ca gurupādataḥ3 

ātmaśaktyā carec caryāṃ sarvasiddhipradāyikām 8.113 

etac catuṣṭayam proktaṃ saṃsārabhayanāśanam 

parasyaiva na deyan tu yadi ’cchet siddhim ātmanaḥ 8.114 

Knowing this, one should not give [lightly] the supreme nectar of Lord Śiva. (110) 

According to this scripture of the Lord, one may attain Śiva by each of the following [practised individually] (pratyekaśaḥ): initiation, knowledge, yoga and caryā in due order. (111) 

By initiation one attains liberation easily, since it is the guru who invari ably accomplishes it.4 And knowledge is obtained, once one finds a guru, through his grace. (112) 

… yo[ga] … from the feet of the guru; One must practise caryā, which bestows all supernatural powers, using one’s own strength (ātmaśak tyā). (113) 

This tetrad has been taught to destroy the dangers of saṃsāra. It should not [lightly] be given to others if one desires supernatural power for oneself. (114) 

An innocent might here at first suppose that we find here what may be the ear liest allusion to the notion that each Śaiva scripture should be arranged in four text-units called pādas, for it is not difficult to see that the kriyāpāda might easily be referred to by the most significant ritual of all, namely dīkṣā. Now Brunner (1992) and others5 have shown that most early scriptures are not in fact divided into four such text-units, and the Niśvāsa certainly is not. Nonetheless, one might reasonably suppose that the four topics to which some later scrip tures devote four text-sections called pādas are referred to here. But are they? Plainly the first three, dīkṣā, jñāna and yoga, may be found treated at length in the Niśvāsa; but is there anything that we might recognise as caryā? This is a word we are rather used to seeing translated as “conduct” or “comportment,” as for instance in the title of Brunner’s 1985 translation of the kriyāpāda and caryāpāda of the Mṛgendratantra: Mṛgendrāgama[.] Section des rites et section du comportement. When she characterises the content of the caryāpāda there, she observes (p. xxxvii): 

3 Perhaps N once read: yogañ ca gurupādataḥ? 

4 At the beginning of the kriyāpāda of the Mataṅga (1.2), initiation is similarly presented as an alternative route to salvation that is easier than taking the more difficult path of jñāna. 5 See Goodall 1998, lviii–lxv.

La presque totalité de l’exposé (śl 1–105) est consacrée à un sujet unique: le comportement normal des différents groupes d’initiés.6 

This is a topic that we really do not find addressed in the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā, and it is therefore clear thatcaryā probably does not mean“comportement nor mal” in this text.When speaking in Toronto,I was unaware that ChristianWede meyer, faced with similar difficulties of interpretation resulting from assuming such a meaning, had already devoted a chapter of his work on Making Sense of Tantric Buddhism (2013, 133–169) to discussing how caryā and related terms should be understood in early Buddhist and Śaiva tantric works.7 An explo ration of this theme therefore now seems in some respects less pressing to me than it once did. But there are still some issues that can usefully be commented upon, and there are several early Śaiva attestations of the nexus ofcaryā-related terms of which Wedemeyer was not aware and which serve to adjust, I think, some of what he has said about this semantic field, and that go some way to explaining a significant juncture in the semantic voyage of the term caryā that led to its being commonly assumed in modern scholarship to mean something like “comportement normal,” even in passages in which such a meaning does not fit. Wedemeyer’s account does clarify a number of confusions, and he is to be commended for taking into account several Śaiva passages, but a combi nation of a desire to show that it is the Śaivas who have borrowed from the Buddhists rather more than the Buddhists have from the Śaivas here (2013, 136–137, 154) and of not having had access to the earliest known Śaiva mate rial (which I should like to have made widely available long ago, but editing concurrently the Niśvāsa, the Kiraṇa and the Sarvajñānottara is proving a very time-consuming project) have led him to some problematic assertions and assumptions, some of which I hope to correct below.8 In what follows, I will 

6 “Almost the entire exposition (verses 1–105) is devoted to a single subject: the regular com portment of different groups of initiates.” 

7 I am grateful to Tim Cahill for bringing Wedemeyer 2013 to my attention by kindly giving me a copy when he was visiting Pondicherry in 2015. 

8 John Nemec too expresses some reserves in his generally positive review (2014, 272–273) and encourages further investigation of the Śaiva understanding of vratas: 

Even if we grant thatWedemeyer limits his argument to instances of the antinomian prac tices that were understood to lead to liberation through a nondualistic, epistemological, or gnostic insight, as I think he wishes to do, there is nevertheless some work left to be done, in my view, to prove that even this particular understanding of the rites in ques tion originated with tantric Buddhism (and the Guhyasamājatantra in particular [160– 162, 166]). What is needed is a more thorough effort to establish the relative chronology of the relevant texts and, more importantly, a more detailed account of the Śaiva self understandings of the religious observances in question.

be expanding upon and shoring up what was advanced rather too tentatively in a lengthy note on Mūlasūtra 4.17c–18 (Goodall, Sanderson, Isaacson et al. 2015, 284–287). 

In fact, the basic difficulty with the central term caryā had arguably already been resolved, in nuce, by Alexis Sanderson in his 2006 article on the Lākulas, but in a somewhat laconic fashion. What he writes, just before presenting the vratas in the ninth chapter of the caryāpāda of the Mataṅgapārameśvara, is the following: 

The Śaivas have conventionally divided the means of liberation taught in the Āgamas, that is to say their subject matter, into the four categories, ritual (kriyā), doctrine or gnosis ( jñānam, vidyā), meditation ( yogaḥ), and ascetic observance and other rules governing the conduct of the various classes and kinds of initiate (caryā). Continuities between the Lākulas and the Śaivas have now been shown in the areas of the ritual of initiation and in the doctrine of the path to liberation, […] Insuffi cient evidence exists to permit much of a comparison in the domain of meditation. […] This leaves only the domain of ascetic observance (vrat acaryā). 

It is clear, in other words, that caryā, in early Śaiva works, may refer specifi cally to ascetic observance, presumably indeed because it is a contraction of the collocation vratacaryā/vratacaraṇa,“the performance (caryā/caraṇa) of timed religious observances (vrata).” The verb car, “to move,” but also “to be engaged in,” has indeed long been the natural idiomatic verb of choice for use with vrata, and this accounts for the frequency of such bahuvrīhi expressions ascīrṇavrata (“who has observed his observances”), both in non-Mantramārga works (e.g. Bodhāyanagṛhyasūtra 4.12.2 on p. 118, Yājñavalkyasmṛti 3.298c, Mahābhārata 3.81.135c) and in works of the Mantramārga (e.g. Mālinīvijayottara 10.17c and 10.34c, Mohacūḍottara 1.14a, etc), as well as for the distinctively tantric bahu vrīhi expression cīrṇavidyāvrata (e.g. Siddhayogeśvarīmata 13.1a),9 to which we shall return below. 

9 One non-tantric instance has been pointed out to me by Harunaga Isaacson (email of 26.xii .2015). 

… I find one occurrence of cīrṇavidyāvrata in a non-tantric text and a non-tantric context. It is in Vyomaśiva’s Vyomavatī, the oldest of the commentaries on the Padārthadhar masaṃgraha (perhaps early 10th century; might be even slightly earlier). Of course, even though the context is here of orthodox Vedic/brahmanical practice, we can be pretty cer tain that Vyomaśiva, as his name already suggests, was familiar with the Siddhānta and

If we were concerned only with the meanings of the word caryā, then it might seem that we could almost end our essay here: Wedemeyer has pointed out that caryā conventionally refers to virtuous behaviour and conduct in accordance with religious precepts in a number of early non-tantric Buddhist texts (2013, 135), where he characterises it as “by far the most common generic term for the spiritual undertakings of buddhas and bodhisattvas,” just as it does in much later Śaiva works of the Mantramārga, such as the Mṛgendra; Sanderson has alluded (in the passage just quoted) to the observed fact that it may refer in Śaiva sources both to the prescribed “conduct of the various classes and kinds of initiate” as well as to “ascetic observance,” and he has pregnantly suggested that this second meaning is connected with the notion of vratacaryā; finally, Wedemeyer has observed that caryā in Buddhist tantric sources, and in some Śaiva ones, refers not to life-long virtuous conduct, but rather to timed antinomian practices, in troubling places such as cremation grounds and involving transgressive sexual and mortuary elements. 

But, as my title indicates, there is in fact a nexus of terms to be exam ined here. Wedemeyer indeed points out that there are several other related terms that seem to be used in places where caryā might have served instead, caryāvrata and vratacaryā being apparently “used with identical meaning” (2013, 136), to which he adds instances of these words “in compound with qualifiers related to ideas of secrecy or madness,” such as guhyavrata, guhya caryā, prachannavrata, unmattavrata, and “a cluster of interrelated terms that appear in the same contexts, and which seem to be largely synonymous,” which he tabulates on p. 137. Among these, he singles out vidyāvrata, for which he suggests the translations “knowledge observance, spell observance, and/or consort observance” (2013, 136) as being “treated as essentially equivalent to caryāvrata/vratacaryā in Buddhist and Śaiva sources.” 

Now it may indeed be the case that several of these terms appear to be used interchangeably, but a slightly broader and chronologically deeper slice of Śaiva samples reveals, it seems to me, both how the terms in fact differ from each other and also why it is that they may in some contexts appear to be inter changeable, while at other times they are not. This may seem hair-splittingly tedious, but, as Wedemeyer points out, if we do not understand the words, then we cannot understand what it is that they serve to express.10 The Viennese 

quite likely other forms of Śaivism, so there is a chance that his terminology has been unconsciously influenced by tantric usage. 

In the passage in question, on p. 233 of the edition, Vyomaśiva is glossing Praśastapāda’s use of the term vidyāvratasnātaka.

endeavour that has so far produced three out of five volumes of the Tāntrikāb hidhānakośa is a step towards a better understanding of technical terms and of common terms used with technical senses in the literature of the Mantra mārga, even if it does not, alas, cover Tantric Buddhist literature.11 

Turning to the Viennese dictionary for an understanding of caryā is, how ever, not yet particularly useful, for the entry under this word consists only of a cross-reference to the term caryāpāda. But the account of that term does con tain what will one day be a useful cross-reference to a future article on the term vrata, and it includes one useful pointer to a moment in the history of the term caryā: 

Note that vrata is substituted as a synonym for caryā in Kir[aṇa] 6.6c; indeed it is conceivable that the term is an abbreviation of vratacaryā (Kir[aṇa] 49.4). 

The volume of the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa in question appeared back in 2004; by the time the fifth volume appears, including the terms vrata and vidyāvrata, this dictionary will be a still more useful resource for tracing out the shifting semantics of this and many another nexus of tantric terms. 

Let us follow up this reference to the Kiraṇatantra. Since its chapter, 49, on vratacaryā is short, we may quote much of it below, omitting from the middle a detailed treatment of the ideal kamaṇḍalu, and giving just the readings of the Devakottai edition (ED) and the Nepalese manuscript of 924ad (N, f. 70r):

cerned with understanding the meanings of common words that are used with technical senses (2013, 134): “Recognition of these terms as terms of art is, however, essential, inso far as failure in this regard creates and sustains broad and systemic misinterpretation of Tantric literature and of the traditions that produced (and were, in turn, produced by) these works.” 

11 The desirability of covering Buddhist Tantric literature is alluded to in the preface to the third volume (p. 11), but it is obvious that the project cannot be simply “tweaked” at this late stage to incorporate a huge extra corpus only in volumes 4 and 5.

You have taught me, O great Lord, the activities of the neophyte, the putraka and the ācārya. Tell me those of the sādhaka. (1) 

The Lord spoke: 

The excellent (varaḥ) sādhaka [should be] full of sattva, firm, capable of endurance, his mind fixed on [his] mantra, unassailable, of great wisdom, looking impartially on mud, stones and gold, (2) 

engaged, regular in [the performance of] oblations, always devoted to recitation and meditation, dexterous in the dispelling of obstacles, firm in [the practice of his] religious observance, calm, pure. (3) 

Accompanied by his ritual assistant, he should go to the forest and begin the practice of his religious observance (vratacaryāṃ). [If he is] without a ritual assistant, then his spouted water-pot is his ritual assistant in that [practice].12 (4)

Alternatively, [instead of a kamaṇḍalu,] it may be a gourd with a shaft. Having made this [ready], he should practise his observance. (13cd) This is the auspicious Raudra-vrata: imposing with a chignon of mat ted locks, marked by a trident and khaṭvāṅga, equipped with a clean half skull, awe-inspiring with a third eye, clothed in the skin of a tiger, peaceful. (14–15b) 

For one firm [in this observance], the highest siddhi will arise in six months; middling [powers] in four months; the lowest [powers] will arise in three months. (15c–16b) 

The highest of the observances is the Raudra[-vrata]. On accomplishing that, one becomes [equal to] the Sakala [form of Śiva]. (16cd) 

For attaining siddhi, the sādhaka should perform a mantra-observance that is appropriate [to the mantra in question].13 (17ab) 

What we see here, it seems to me, is a reflection of the old notion that caryā refers to vratacaryā, “the performance of a vrata,” where vrata is a timed reli gious observance that typically involves adopting an unusual diet (not men tioned here), an unusual style of dress (often with accoutrements of the cre mation ground, in this case the khaṭvāṅga), and unusual behaviour (sexual transgressions, mortuary obsessions, or, as here, ascetic detachment). This observance is furthermore a preparation for the attainment of magical powers through the use of a mantra. 

This is, I think, in essence, the same as what is meant by the term vrata in all early tantric literature. It explains therefore how vratacaryā, “the performance 

13 Or perhaps “appropriate [to the desired siddhi].” 
 

dressing for power 59 

of such a vrata,” and therefore sometimes also caryā have come to be used interchangeably with vrata.14 But the term caryā evidently began to expand and then slip in meaning as the Mantramārga expanded to include not just sādhakas (who seem to be the only audience of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā15), but also other categories of initiates. We can see that this slippage has in fact already taken place by the time of the Kiraṇa, for that work begins its thirty-first chapter with an announcement that the next topic to be taught will be caryā, and yet, as we have just seen above, does not deal with the vratacaryā of the Sādhaka until chapter 49, which follows eighteen chapters later. 

Here is the beginning of chapter 31, in which the topic called caryā is first introduced in such a way as to suggest that the primary meaning has now become something like regular enjoined “comportment.”

Garuḍa spoke: 

What are the day-to-day activities of the neophyte and the putraka? Tell me this. You have not taught me the [regular rules of] behaviour (caryā) before. (1) 

No such clear evidence can be found of this broadening of the meaning of the word caryā in another post-Niśvāsa but pre-tenth-century Saiddhāntika scrip ture for which we have an early Nepalese palm-leaf witness, this time appar ently of the ninth-century, namely the Sarvajñānottaratantra.16 Thatwork gives 

14 As forcaryāvrata, which, as we have seen above, Wedemeyer considers to be synonymous with vratacaryā, I suspect that it rather means “one of the timed religious observances belonging to [the body of activities that can collectively be called] [vrata-]caryā.” No doubt there is, in certain contexts, little difference between saying this and saying “the performance of timed religious observances” (vratacaryā). 

15 For the absence of initiates who are not sādhakas from the religious teachings of the Niś vāsa, see Goodall, Sanderson, Isaacson et al. 2015, 47ff.

All the gods, beginning with Brahmā, reside in the liṅga; therefore a yogin who venerates his guru, God and the fire and who has per 

formed his vidyāvrata should install the liṅga, following the proce dure taught in scripture. (19.2–3b) 

We shall return below to the use of the term vidyāvrata, which I have not trans lated here. First we may observe that these passages of the Kiraṇa and Sarvaj ñānottara might appear to confirm Wedemeyer’s observation that the vratas in early Śaiva works were observances in which the sādhaka imitated God (2013, 165). 

The early Śaiva Tantric paradigm for the transgressive vrata, then, was one of imitatio dei—mimicking the activity of the god in the interest of eliding the (presumably mistaken) sense of a gulf between him and the devotee. In none of these rites is there mention of transcendence of conceptuality or attainment of any epistemic nonduality—the concern seems entirely to be one of nonduality in the sense of union with the god Śiva. 

Imitation of forms of god, whether pure or transgressive, seems indeed to be typical of vratas in early Śaiva sources, but it is not the invariable rule, as the Niśvāsa demonstrates.43 Several vratas are described in the course of the work, but there is one passage in which a set of nine is concisely described together, namely in chapter 3 of the Guhyasūtra. A brief summary of the contents of that chapter will help to contextualise that description, showing that it is part of a chapter devoted to 1) preparations for magical pursuits, and 2) magical proce dures: 

43 Nemec also (2014, 273) expresses doubt about this point of Wedemeyer’s: I am, in a word, not convinced that the many transgressive practices in the “early period” of Śaiva tantra, defined as “pre-tenth century” (165), involve a practice of imita tio dei,“of union with the god Śiva,” to the exclusion of “transcendence of conceptuality or attainment of any epistemic nonduality” (ibid.). 

As to what states of consciousness such non-imitative observances might or might not be intended to achieve, the text gives us no direct information; we can only say that it does elsewhere describe practices whose purpose is said to be transcending duality, for exam ple in yogic meditations described in Uttarasūtra 5.42–43 and Nayasūtra 4.55ff., and that a non-dualist cosmogony is sketched out in Uttarasūtra 1.13.

[Once the rosary has been thus prepared, he becomes] ready for siddhis and power. (29cd) 

Dangerous creatures do not harm one who has [first] accomplished an observance [that qualifies one] for [using] Spells: he should 

begin an observance by means of recitation ( jape[= japena]).60 

(30ab) 

The one engaged in observance should practise the False Observance (mithyāvrata) [by wandering about proclaiming]: “I have committed bad deeds: I have killed a cow, mother, father, brother, a guest, friend, brahmin!” (30c–31b) 

[If] one wanders in the cremation-ground at night, with a skull in one’s hand and a khaṭvāṅga, covered in ashes, that is called the cremation ground observance (śmaśānavrata). (31c–32b) 

If one dances, sings, laughs and talks madly, with the body smeared in ashes and wearing rags, this is called the Gaṇavrata. (32c–33b) 

One performs the Clod-of-Earth Observance (loṣṭukavratam) by 

being engaged in recitation, feeding on alms, sleeping on the earth, with senses controlled, engaged in meditation and restraint. (33c– 34b) 

One may perform the Block-of-Wood Observance (kāṣṭhavratam) in a forest full of bears, tigers and lions, conquering the urges to sleep and eat, [constantly] reciting. (34c–35b) 

If one takes on the appearance of a woman and sings and dances, adorned with bracelets, with a winnowing fan, ball and plait, one observes the Colourful Observance (citravratam). (35c–36b) 

With a weapon in hand, full of compassion, if one wanders like a saviour of creatures (?)61 focussed upon recitation, meditation and worship, one performs the Warrior Observance (vīravratam). (36c–37b)

If one torments the body with rain, cold and heat, …, devoted to 

recitation and meditation, this is called the Great Observance 

(mahāvrataḥ). (37c–38b) 

A woman skilled in the pleasures of love-making, endowed with beauty and youth; such a woman one should procure, holding one’s senses back from the objects of the senses, and one should kiss and embrace [her], placing the penis upon her sex while remaining focussed upon recitation and meditation—one performs [thus] the Sword-Blade Observance (asidhārāvratam). If one should succumb to the control of desire, then one certainly falls into hell. (38c–40) 

One should recite the navātman one lakh times … for [si]ddhi: one who [thus] observes such an excellent observance for a year or 

just six months attains lowest, middling or best siddhi. But if, while observing such a vrata, someone recites five lakh times, then [that mantra] succeeds [for him] (siddhyate), and all mantras succeed for him and he attains the fruits he desires. (41–43b)

(43c–45) 

Right at the beginning of the above-quoted passage, we find a further attesta tion of the term vidyāvrata, and this time, rather than prevaricating further, I have proposed translating it as “an observance [that qualifies one] for [using] Spells.” There are other passages that can and will be adduced in support of this, but I think that it should already be becoming clear from this passage of the Guhyasūtra and from the passage quoted just before from the Sarvajñān ottara that the different particular vratas that are performed serve to prepare the performer for some subsequent religious activity that involves the use of the mantra or vidyā. In the case of the Guhyasūtra, it is the pursuit of siddhi for which the sādhaka is prepared; in the case of the Sarvajñānottara, the indi vidual is prepared for the performance of the installation (pratiṣṭhā) of a liṅga. From the beginning of chapter 10 of the kriyāpāda, we learn that it is also an essential to the consecration of an ācārya in the Mataṅgapārameśvara: 

catuṣpādārthakuśalaṃ mahotsāhaṃ hy aninditam 10.2 

ṣaṭpadārthapraṇītārthaṃ sarvabhūtahite ratam

nityaṃ carubhujā bhūmyāṃ kuśaprastaraśāyinā 

pūjāgnibhavane yuktacetasā bhāvitātmanā 10.5 

Rāmakaṇṭha: [vidyāśaktiḥ] vyomavyāpilakṣaṇā.62 

The guru should consecrate [as an ācārya] a man who is skilled in what is taught in all four pādas, who has great energy, who is beyond reproach, who expounds the meaning of the teachings [encapsulated] in the six topics [of this scripture], who is devoted to the welfare of all beings, who has performed the observance for [the propitiation of his] mantra. 

Rāmakaṇṭha: Now if you ask what this vidyāvrata is which he must have observed, this is what the text teaches: 

The power of the vidyā that is mentioned here [in this compound vidyā vrata] is first to be recited for a year in a temple to Śiva, while exercising control of the senses, maintaining purity, eating daily [only the sacrificial gruel known as] caru, sleeping on the ground in the room reserved for pūjā and fire[-sacrifice] on a spread of kuśa-grass, with his mind engaged [in meditation], focussed. 

Rāmakaṇṭha: It [viz. the power of the vidyā] is the vyomavyāpin. 

Once this preparation, taking the form of the observance of one among a vari ety of possible vratas (but ideally one suitable to the mantra to be put to use, as seems already to be implied in Kiraṇa 49.17ab above, and as we shall see confirmed below), is complete, the observer can be called cīrṇavidyāvrataḥ (as here and in Sarvajñānottara 19.3a) or siddhavidyāvratasthaḥ (as in Guhyasūtra 3.30a). 

If we make such an assumption, then we can see how the expressions vrat acaryā and vidyāvrata might be regarded as interchangeable in some con

texts,63 even though they are not actually synonymous. It also becomes clear how it is that vidyāvrata can be characterised as preparatory mantra-pro pitiation and therefore equivalent to what may also be called puraścaraṇa. Sanderson characterises it in such a way when referring to the account of the Bhairavācārya in Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita: 

With this account of a pūrvasevā, also called puraścaryā or vidyāvratam, i.e. the initial period of ascetic japaḥ etc. to be undertaken after one has received a Mantra, whereby one becomes able to accomplish feats (kar māṇi) with that Mantra …64 

So if vrata and vratacaryā and some other terms may seem to be used inter changeably in some works with vidyāvrata, it is because the principal purpose of the vratas taught in the early Mantramārga seems to be to propitiate mantras prior to further religious activities involving those mantras, rendering those who complete such observances describable by such terms ascīrṇavidyāvrata, siddhavidyāvratastha, vidyāvratasnāta and so forth.65 Various observances can, in other words, be observed in order to become one “who has completed the observance [required for the propitiation] of a vidyā.” 

This discussion might seem to suggest that in finding the originalmeaning of the expression vidyāvrata we believe that we have found its immutable seman tic core, but that is not really what I intend to say. Of course the term vidyāvrata may have gone on to evolve and be used in contexts that suggest that one might elsewhere also or instead render it as “knowledge observance” or “con sort observance” (Wedemeyer 2013, 136) or, as we shall see below, “observance relating to a vidyāṅgamantra.”66 Furthermore, one might argue that we have in 

63 Cf.Wedemeyer 2013, 159:“It is worth noting that theTantrasadbhāva/Kubjikāmata and the Siddhayogeśvarīmata clearly take the terms vidyāvrata and vratacaryā to be synonymous.” 64 Sanderson 2001, 13, note 11. Wedemeyer quotes from this definition (2013, 255, note 96), but in a manner that suggests that he was oddly not convinced by it, or not convinced that the same kind of vidyāvrata was being alluded to by Sanderson: 

Sanderson (“History”, 13n11) also describes a very different rite [scil. from that referred to in Vīṇāśikhatantra 180?] when he speaks of vidyāvrata as an “initial period of ascetic japaḥ etc. to be undertaken after one has received a Mantra,” i.e., he takes it to be a kind of pūrvasevā or puraścaryā. 

65 Another purpose of performing vratas in the early Mantramārga is of course expiation: see, for example, Guhyasūtra 9.10a, Siddhayogeśvarīmata 10.3c, both quoted below, and Hṛdayaśiva’s Prāyaścittasamuccaya passim (appendix to Sathyanarayanan 2015). 

66 We do not aim, however, to examine here all later passages in which the meaning of vidyāvrata is arguably stretched. One such passage is a sequence of verses discussing the term that has been borrowed from the Tantrasadbhāva into the Kubjikāmata: that dis

any case not started from its point of origin, for the term has presumably been drawn from or at least coloured by the brahmanical expression vidyāvratasnāta that is common from the Gṛhyasūtras onwards and that we find, for instance, in Manusmṛti 4.31: 

vedavidyāvratasnātān śrotriyān gṛhamedhinaḥ 

pūjayed dhavyakavyena viparītāṃś ca varjayet 

Olivelle (2005, 125–126) translates: 

At rites for gods and ancestors, he should honor individuals who have bathed after completing the Vedas, vedic learning, or vedic vows, who are vedic scholars, or who are householders, but avoid individuals different from these.67 

It seems to me very likely that the use of vidyāvrata in the Mantramārga—and a fortiori of vidyāvratasnāta (Siddhayogeśvarīmata 10.20 and Svāyambhuvasū trasaṅgraha 21.35)—should have been influenced by earlier brahmanical usage such as we see in the Gṛhyasūtras and in the Manusmṛti. Nonetheless, in the 

cussion begins with Bhairava saying (Tantrasadbhāva 4.2ab = Kubjikāmata 25.30ab): śṛṇu devi pravakṣyāmi vidyāyā vratam uttamam, “Listen, O goddess: I shall teach the excellent observance of/for vidyā.” 

67 Olivelle also adds a note that explains that there is doubt about the term (2005, 270): [M]ost commentators take vedavidyāvrata as three separate categories. The first refer to those who have only learned the Veda by heart; the second to those who have mas tered its meaning; and the third to those who have completed the vows associated with vedic study, such as living with the teacher for a certain number of years, even if they have not mastered the Veda. 

This interpretation is not wholly consistent with what we find earlier in Gṛhyasūtra liter ature. In Jaiminigṛhyasūtra 1.19 (p. 18), for instance, we read: 

trayaḥ snātakā bhavantīti ha smāhāruṇir gautamo vidyāsnātako vratasnātako vidyā vratasnātaka iti teṣām uttamaḥ śreṣṭhas tulyau pūrvau. 

Caland (1922, 32) translates: 

According to Âruṇi Gautama there are three kinds of Snātakas: the Snātaka by knowl edge, the Snātaka by the completion of his observances, and the Snātaka by knowledge and by the completion of his observances. Of these the last ranks foremost, the first two are equal (to each-other). 

Cf. Pāraskaragṛhyasūtra (kāṇḍa 2, kaṇḍikā 5, sentences 32–35, p. 220): 

trayaḥ snātakā bhavanti: vidyāsnātako vratasnātako vidyāvratasnātaka iti 32 samāpya vedam asamāpya vrataṃ yaḥ samāvartate, sa vidyāsnātakaḥ 33 samāpya vratam as amāpya vedaṃ yaḥ samāvartate, sa vratasnātakaḥ 34 ubhayaṃ samāpya yaḥ samāvar tate, sa vidyāvratasnātaka iti 35

Niśvāsa certainly, and probably throughout the early Mantramārga, the use of vidyāvrata to mean “observance for [the propitiation of] a mantra” seems to be the norm. As Sanderson has observed in the note of his that we have just quoted, vidyāvrata seems indeed to be used in the same way as pūrva sevā in the Niśvāsa. Many short paragraphs of prose in the grimoires (kalpa) that we find in the Guhyasūtra sketch out the essential features of particular observances, and these paragraphs are very often concluded with a succinct statement of the magical powers that can be won by following them (the power tofly,for example, or to disappear); but sometimes wefind instead the assertion that the observance fulfils the requirements of pūrvasevā (10.27, 10.99, 14.26) or puraścaraṇa (14.24) or, as here in Guhyasūtra 10.91, the requirements of the vidyāvrata: 

devaṃ pūjyāgnau juhuyād audumbarasamidhānāṃ tryaktānāṃ sahas raṃ tṛsandhyaṃ. kṣīrāśī saptā dināni juhuyāt. cīrṇṇavidyāvrato bhavati. 

Having worshipped the Lord, he should oblate into the fire at the three junctures of the day a thousand pieces of Udumbara-wood smeared with the three [sweet substances]. Consuming [only] milk, he should make oblations [in this manner] for seven days. He will become one who has accomplished the vidyāvrata. 

BeforeI wrap up the discussion, it should be mentioned that a different hypoth esis as to the meaning of vidyāvrata was advanced some years ago, when many of the above-cited passages had not yet come to light, by Judit Törzsök when translating chapter 10 of the Siddhayogeśvarīmata. We quote here the begin ning of the chapter (without the apparatus) from Törzsök’s 1999 edition: 

devy uvāca 

mayā deva purā pṛṣṭaṃ vratayāgavivarjitam 

siddhayogeśvarīṇāṃ tu mataṃ mantraprasādhakam 1

sitayajñopavītaś ca akāmo niyame sthitaḥ 5 
 

dressing for power 71 Here is Törzsök’s translation (1999*, 143): 

The Goddess spoke 

I have previously asked you about the Doctrine of the Yoginīs (Siddha yogeśvarīmata), O God, which helps to make mantras effective 

(mantraprasādhakam) without any observances or worship. (1) 

However, you have asserted, O God, that success depends on the ancil lary mantras; therefore, tell me briefly about how to practise the 

observance[s] associated with them (teṣu). (2) 

Bhairava spoke 

First [before any other practice to attain a specific supernatural power], for all kinds of supernatural powers, [and] for expiatory purposes, one has to start the observance of the [ancillary] mantras, which destroys all obstacles. (3) 

The male or female practitioner, with his/her mind focused on the mantra, should perform worship according to prescriptions and then undertake the vow (vratacaryāṃ). (4) 

[In the first of these] all his limbs covered with ashes, the practitioner is to observe silence and should wear a white garment; he should be of good understanding. He must have a white sacred thread, he should be free from desire and established in self-restraint. (5) 

Now the reason that Törzsök translates vidyāvrata with “the observance of the [ancillary] mantras” is that each of the vratas in the chapter is specific to the cultivation of a particular auxiliary mantra—the first one, given above in verse 5, must, by elimination, be an observance for the hṛdaya-mantra— and those auxiliary mantras belong to a set known in this work and in others as the vidyāṅgamantras.68 It was therefore reasonable for her to assume that vidyāvrata was short for vidyāṅgavrata, for she had no evidence to suggest oth erwise, and she had parallel evidence that seemed to reinforce this hypothesis, namely the testimony of Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha 21 (from which Törzsök quotes, citing Alexis Sanderson’s collation, in her notes on p. 78). 

That passage again gives a series of vratas, which are, by the way, again not instances of imitatio dei, and which are again specific to the vidyāṅgamantras; so it is wholly understandable that this seemed to Törzsök in 1999 to confirm 

68 For these mantras and their individual names, see Brunner 1986 and, more recently, Goodall 2004, 222–223.

the notion that the element vidyā in the collocation vidyāvrata must refer to the vidyāṅgamantras. I think, however, that it will now be clear that chapter 21 of the Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha might in fact be interpreted equally well internally if we assume that vidyāvrata is used instead to mean “observance for [propitiation of] a mantra” and that, given the other attestations of the term that we now know about in, for instance, the Guhyasūtra, the Mataṅga, and the Sarvajñānottara, it actually makes better sense to assume this broader interpre tation in this passage too. 

There is somewhat better evidence for pinpointing the place of the Svāyam bhuvasūtrasaṅgraha in a relative chronology of Saiddhāntika writings than there is for most other pre-tenth-century Siddhāntatantras, for in terms of both doctrinal and social developments, it seems later than the sūtras of the Niś vāsatattvasaṃhitā (see Goodall, Sanderson, Isaacson et al. 2015, 41–44, 47–50, 58), and yet it cannot be later than Sadyojyotiḥ, who has written a commen tary upon it and who, Sanderson argues (2006b, in particular p. 76), lived between c. 675 and 725ad. The edition is not widely accessible, which may be why Wedemeyer did not refer to this passage, and its text almost invari ably needs to be corrected against manuscripts, but this particular chapter has just been published anew, in the form in which it appears when quoted by Hṛdayaśiva in his Prāyaścittasamuccaya (see Sathyanarayanan 2015, Appendix chapter 10).69

Having recited [a particular mantra] along with [the practice of one of the] observances in accordance with the rules, and having bathed [at the end of the observance], one may recite that mantra for attaining supernatural powers. (27cd) 

The skilled practitioner should do his recitation not too slowly, not indistinctly, not without taking [the meaning of what he recites] in, not too fast, not without counting, and not with his thoughts in confusion. (28) 

Dressed in white, with a white turban and a white sacred thread and white unguents and garland, he should perform the observance for the vidyādhipa-mantra. (29) 

Dressed in red garments and red garlands and unguents the Mantrin should first perform for one month the stated observance for the brahmaśiraḥ. (30) 

Wearing yellow garments and yellow garlands and unguents and a yel low sacred thread he should perform the excellent observance of rudrāṇī for a month. (31) 

The competent ritualist (budhaḥ), constantly devoted to the worship of Śiva, should perform the observance for puruṣṭuta for one month with all accoutrements being black. (32) 

The mantrin, intent on attaining all manner of special powers, should perform the observance for the pāśupatāstra resolutely (dhīraḥ) dressed in multi-coloured garments and with multicoloured garlands and unguents. (33) 
 

74 goodall 

And upon the completion of one or another of these observances (vratavratasamāptau),70 he should pour upon himself Śiva-water that has been consecrated by recitation of his mantra over it from a pot. (34) 

Being thus bathed after the observance [in propitiation] of [his] mantra, invested in the right to [pursue] all [manner of special powers], fault less, he should then recite [his chosen] mantra according to the rules of his hand-book,71 without being afraid. (35) 

In the above lines, 27d and 35 seem to make particularly plain that these vratas are performed by way of pūrvasevā, also known as vidyāvrata, as a preliminary to the pursuit of siddhi. 

Csaba Kiss, following Judit Törzsök’s lead, has also alluded to the link between vidyāṅgamantras and the name vidyāvrata, but I think it will be clear from what he says below that the evidence that his new edition of parts of the Brahmayāmala has recently brought to the discussion again supports rather the broader interpretation, in which the element vidyā alludes to any mantra, not just a vidyāṅgamantra. Below are his remarks (2015, 211) on Brahmayāmala 21.4–5b, which he constitutes and translates as follows: 

ete nava vratā proktā vidyābhede vyavasthitā 

eteṣāṃ tu yathānyāyaṃ yathā caryā bhave tv iha 

kathayāmi mahādevi tan me nigadataḥ śṛṇu 

These are the nine ascetic observances (vrata), corresponding to [the syllables of] the Vidyā[, Caṇḍā Kāpālinī’s nine-syllable mantra]. I shall now teach you how to perform them correctly, O Mahādevī. Listen to me [while I] teach you. 

… these observances are in fact called the vidyāvratas in 21.10c, 42d, 47a, 51b, 53b, 75d and 102d; the nine types of observances obviously corre spond to the nine syllables of the Navākṣaravidyā (oṃ caṇḍe kāpālini svāhā), taught in BraYā 2; vidyāvratas may also serve, as seen in many tantric texts, as preliminary propitiation, by the use of vidyāṅgamantras, of a mantra to be applied later, or simply for the purpose of gaining

mastery over the Vidyā, similarly to the way it is taught in the Yoginīsaṃ cāra; as Sanderson (2009:134 n. 311) remarks: … 

More closely parallel to these nine observances, as we can now see, are the nine taught in chapter 3 of the Guhyasūtra, which are probably each for one of the nine elements of the navātman. So perhaps the association with vidyāṅga mantras is simply a red herring. 

Kiss’s reference there to Sanderson 2009, 134, note 311 proves to be another passage in which Sanderson reveals that, although he did not spell out every detail of his assumptions and the evidence upon which he based them, he had in fact already assumed the interpretation for which we have been somewhat long-windedly arguing here, both of vidyāvrata and of its relation to individual named vratas: 

The Yoginīsaṃcāra requires anyone who has gone through its initiation ceremony and then received consecration (abhiṣekaḥ) to adopt one of three forms of ascetic observance in order to gain mastery over the Vidyā (vidyāvratam): the Bhairavavrata, the Cāmuṇḍāvrata, or the Triṣaṣṭikula vrata, the observance of the sixty-three families [of the Mothers], which it also calls the Kāpālavrata, i.e. the Kāpālika. 

So let me reiterate my conclusion: we should probably assume that, even if the expression vidyāvrata was originally drawn from the common brahman ical expression vidyāvratasnāta that we saw in Manusmṛti 4.31, and even if it may have been subsequently coloured in some contexts by other associa tions of the word vidyā (vidyāṅgamantra, “knowledge,” “consort”), the expres sion vidyāvrata appears throughout the early Mantramārga to be used with the understanding that it refers primarily to an “observance for [the prelimi nary propitiation of a] mantra.” While some works (such as the Saiddhāntika Kiraṇatantra, and the Sarvajñānottaratantra) appear to mention only one way of fulfilling the requirements of the vidyāvrata, many others (Niśvāsa, Yoginī saṃcāra, Brahmayāmala, Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha, Siddhayogeśvarīmata, Tantrasadbhāva, Kubjikāmata) teach several vratas, not all of which are equally transgressive and not all of which involve imitatio dei, as alternative ways of realising the vidyāvrata. 

Finally, let me show how this assumption seems to me to throw light even on passages where none of the terms that we have been discussing actually occur. The first few times I read the beginning of chapter 9 of the Guhyasūtra, it seemed to begin with a curious non sequitur: the goddess asks a question about how the alphabet, treated as mantra, can be used to bring about supernatural

power and liberation; Śiva’s reply, however, first explains at some length how someone should dress half his body as the goddess and the other half as Śiva. How could this, I asked myself, be an answer to the goddess’ question? Was the apparent incoherence of the text here an indication that it had become cor rupt?

The Goddess spoke: 

From the mātṛkā supernatural power and liberation can come about, O Lord. Tell me [how to attain] supernatural power and liberation through the mātṛkā. (1) 

Why did you teach the mantras that arise from it? Tell me [the answer to] this excellent question. … fruit to me. (2) 

The Lord spoke: 

Wearing half the dress of a woman and half [that of] a man, on one half, he should place [feminine] tresses, on one half, he should wear mat ted locks. (3) 

On one half, there should be a forehead mark; on one half a [forehead] eye. A ring (vālikā) [should be] in one ear; a [pendant] ear-ornament (kuṇḍalam) in one ear. He should put a trident (śūlam) in his right hand and a breast on his left side, a girdle (mekhalām) on the left half, a bangle on the left arm, a woman’s anklet on the left leg, a man’s anklet on the right leg and a muñja-grass belt. At the hips, he should put a loin-cloth on the right and wear a woman’s garment on the left. (4–6) 

In the left hand, he should hold a winnowing fan in the observance of Ardhanārīśvara. Adopting this observance he should eat alms, keep his senses under control, be devoted to regular obligatory recitation and oblation, rejecting the receipt of gifts. (7–8b) 

He should venerate God three times [a day] and perform ablutions three times [a day]. Eating vegetables and barley-gruel, eating bulbs (skanda° [= kanda°]), roots and fruits, for one month … (9) 

He will be released from [the retributive force of] major transgressions; and he will attain low siddhis after two months, middling siddhis after half a year and high siddhis after a year; he will attain power over the spell (vidyāsiddhim). (10–11b) 

The ability to make himself atomic, along with the others [of the yogic powers], will arise. He will take pleasure in the company of siddhas. He will attain the wishes he desires; if he is without desires, he will attain liberation. (11c–12b) 

Although the words vrata,caryā and vidyāvrata are none of them to be found, it is now clear to me that this passage makes implicit allusion to the structure now familiar to us from numerous other passages: the sādhaka propitiates a given mantra, here the mātṛkā, by performing a timed religious observance involv ing unusual dress and diet, the rules of which are ideally held to be in some way appropriate to the mantra in question, and then becomes eligible for the pur

suit of particular siddhis. In the case of the mātṛkā, adopting the appearance of Ardhanārīśvara is particularly appropriate because the mātṛkā is made up of feminine vowels and masculine consonants, which, as is explained else where in the Niśvāsa-corpus, are to be applied respectively to the left and right halves of the sādhaka’s body before worship in a preliminary rite that prefigures what came to be called sakalīkaraṇa.78 The imitatio dei that is such a promi nent feature of some observances, such as this one, now seems as if it should be more precisely characterised as identification with the mantra-deity being propitiated. 

Conclusion 

So what can be learned from the foregoing pages? In the beginning of this paper, I tried to emphasise the layered structure not only of the Niśvāsa tattvasaṃhitā, but also of the Guhyasūtra itself. This incidentally means that we should not only be, as always, cautious in proposals for dating both this and related literature, but that we should perhaps also allow for a broad fourchette for the composition of this work, broad enough to cover the periods of compo sition of other related works.79 We should also bear in mind, while attempting to model the relative chronology of early Tantric literature, that it is the very latest layers of the Guhyasūtra that provide the closest parallels with the gri moires of the Buddhist kriyātantras, in particular with the final chapter, 55, of the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa (see Goodall and Isaacson 2016, passim). 

We have also learned, I believe, about a further early stage in the history that precedes the familiar idea that Śaiva scriptures were divided into four sec tions treating knowledge, ritual, yoga and day-to-day behaviour ( jñāna, kriyā, yoga, caryā). In the period of the redaction of the Niśvāsa, initiates were, de facto, all sādhakas seeking to harness the power of mantras and their caryā was not a matter of approved day-to-day behaviour, or “comportment,” but rather of vrata-caryā, the performance of timed religious observances. Such timed religious observances could be used, as in many other religious tradi tions, for expiation, but their primary use in the early Mantramārga was for

mantra-propitiation prior to other activities involving the mantras. Such pre liminary mantra-propitiation could also be referred to by such expressions as vidyāvrata, puraścaryā and pūrvasevā. These notions about mantra-use and mantra-propitiation may be found reflected in a wide range of post-Niśvāsa pre-tenth-century writings. But once the intake of the religion had broadened to include many who were not occupied with spell-mastery at all, the term caryā in the tetrad of tantric topics also regained its (usually non-technical) sense of day-to-day “comportment.” This shift in usage had taken place by the time of the composition of the Kiraṇa, in other words by the beginning of the ninth century at the latest.80 Finally, the early Śaiva evidence furnished here suggests that this nexus of notions and labels is not such a fertile field as might have been supposed for those searching for evidence of instances of Buddhist influence upon the early Śaiva Mantramārga.

### 4 Rāmakaṇṭha 0 Ātman Debate
Further Thoughts on Rāmakaṇṭha’s Relationship to Earlier Positions in the Buddhist-Brāhmaṇical Ātman Debate 

Alex Watson 

The present article is a continuation of my previous work on where precisely to place Rāmakaṇṭha’s self-theory (ātmavāda) in the nexus of other rival posi tions. I am delighted to have been included in this volume and in the con ference which led to it, in honour of my former DPhil supervisor, Profes sor Alexis Sanderson, with whom I spent many hours reading Rāmakaṇṭha’s Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa (as well as Kumārila’s Ślokavārttika, ātmavāda, and Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, pudgalaviniścaya)—and indeed at whose suggestion I began working on Rāmakaṇṭha’s philosophical texts. 

A previous article of mine (Watson 2014) places Rāmakaṇṭha in the middle ground between Nyāya and Buddhism. What I would like to do here is present some considerations that run counter to that. I do not think they invalidate my earlier contentions, but they do reveal them to be one-sided and incomplete. 

In section 1 I introduce key issues in the self debate between Nyāya and Bud dhism, in order to then be able to locate Rāmakaṇṭha in relation to these two. In section 2 I briefly explain my “middle ground” idea that was put forward in the 2014 article.`1 In section 3 I present evidence for seeing Rāmakaṇṭha as just as extreme as Nyāya. In section 4 I present evidence for seeing him as being even more extreme than Nyāya, with Nyāya being the moderate position. In section 5 I present evidence for Nyāya not being so moderate after all. In the concluding section I ask where all of this leaves us. 

1 The Naiyāyika-Buddhist Debate about the Existence of the Self 

As a means of identifying what precisely separated Nyāya and Buddhism2 on the question of the self (ātman), I like to use a triple distinction, one that I had

figure 4.2 Self as substance 

not seen in secondary literature prior to my 2014 article, but whichI think arises naturally from the primary sources. This is a distinction between three ways in which the self was envisaged by the Naiyāyikas, and three corresponding ways in which the self was argued against by the Buddhists. To elaborate the idea, I will use the same set of diagrams that I used in my 2014 article. 

Figure 4.1 is intended to illustrate the difference between the Buddhist doc trine of momentariness, according to which we are something different in every single moment, and the Brāhmaṇical idea of the self as the unchanging essence of a sentient being. The self is something that remains the same— both numerically and qualitatively—over time; a Buddhist individual is both numerically and qualitatively different in each moment. 

Whereas in figure 4.1 we were focusing on the conception of the self as unchanging essence, in figure 4.2 we are dealing with the self as substance, rep resented by the large circle on the left—a substance that is the owner of certain qualities (guṇa), represented by the small circles. For Naiyāyikas qualities can not exist without some substance in which they inhere; hence we can infer the existence of the self from the existence of qualities such as cognition, plea 

Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, and the Yogācāra and Sautrāntika of Dignāga, Dhar makīrti and their followers. What is said of Buddhism in this article does not, therefore, hold true of Madhyamaka, for example.

sure and pain.3 For Buddhists cognitions, feelings and the other constituents (skandha) of an individual exist bundled together, without belonging to some greater whole. 

In figure 4.3 we are dealing with the conception of the self as agent; and we have to distinguish two senses of “agent”—the doer (kartṛ) of actions, and the subject of cognitions ( jñātṛ). Actions and cognitions (the circles can represent either) all share a common agent for Nyāya, namely the self (represented by the line). For Buddhism they do not: the agent of one particular action or cog nition will have ceased to exist by the time another action or cognition comes into being. 

The Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika concept of the agent of physical actions was some times elaborated by comparison to a puppeteer: as a puppeteer brings into being movements of the body of the puppet, so the self brings bodily move ments into being.4 And the Naiyāyikas and Vaiśeṣikas both borrowed the Gram marians’ (Vaiyākaraṇas) definition of the agent as that which is autonomous, i.e. that cause of action which does not depend on anything else.5 Buddhism opposes this concept of an autonomous agent standing over the psycho-phys ical stream of events, manipulating it from above. Any physical action will depend on the previous moment of consciousness, this will depend on what causes it, and the latter will depend on what causes it, etc. There is nothing 

3 The argument involves three contentions, each of which had their own supporting argu ments: (1) Qualities cannot exist without substances to which they belong; (2) Cognition, desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, and volition are qualities; (3) The self is the only possible substance to which these qualities could belong. See Nyāyavārttika ad 1.1.10, p. 62,12–18 (that is to say, p. 62, lines 12–18—a convention used throughout this essay), and Praśastapāda bhāṣya p. 16,3–7.

here that is autonomous; and if there were it would not be able to be a cause as it would stand outside the causal chain. So for Buddhism the agent of an action is simply its principal cause, and this will be an event within the psycho physical stream.6 Buddhism thus replaces a two-tier model with a one-tier one. 

If we are talking not of a physical action but specifically of a cognition, its agent will not be a previous moment of consciousness but rather the cognition itself. The agent of a perception, i.e. the thing doing the perceiving, is the per ception itself. The subject of any act of awareness, i.e. that which is aware, is the stream of consciousness at that particular moment. So here too we have a contrast between a Naiyāyika two-tier model, in which the cognizer ( jñātṛ), i.e. the self, is ontologically quite distinct from the cognition ( jñāna), versus a Buddhist one-tier model in which the cognizer is pluralized and dispersed into the stream of cognitions. 

2 Rāmakaṇṭha in the Middle Ground 

Where does Rāmakaṇṭha fit in all of this? On two counts he falls with Nyāya and on two counts he falls with Buddhism. He falls with Nyāya (1) in oppos ing the Buddhist doctrine of momentariness and in upholding the existence of a self that is the unchanging essence of the individual; and (2) in maintain ing that there is an autonomous, unconditioned agent of our physical actions. But he agrees with Buddhism (1) that cognition does not inhere in something other than itself: there is no self-substance over and above cognition; and (2) that there is no cognizer over and above cognition, no agent of awareness over and above awareness. For him, as for Buddhism, that which does the cogniz ing or perceiving is just cognition/awareness/consciousness ( jñātṛ/grāhaka = jñāna). 

How does he manage to reconcile all of these positions? I.e., how does he manage to preserve the existence of an unchanging, autonomous self when he denies that there is anything—any substance or agent—over and above cogni tion/consciousness? The answer is that he equates the self and cognition/con sciousness ( jñāna/saṃvit/cit/caitanya). This means that he has to maintain that cognition/consciousness is permanent and unchanging, not plural and momentary as it is for both Buddhism and Nyāya. Thus the three views can be laid out on a continuum.

figure 4.4 Rāmakaṇṭha’s view in the middle ground 

For Nyāya there is both cognition, and a self over and above that. For Bud dhism there is no self, there is just cognition. For Rāmakaṇṭha there is a self, but it is just cognition. Rāmakaṇṭha falls in the middle in the sense that, like Buddhism, he as it were crosses out the line under Nyāya—he reduces the self to cognition; but he does not go all the way down the path of Buddhist argu mentation, as he joins up the dotted line into one unbroken one: he argues that cognition is permanent. 

I will not here dwell on how Rāmakaṇṭha further elaborates and defends his idea of unchanging cognition, as I have done so elsewhere.7 

3 Rāmakaṇṭha as Extreme as Nyāya 

It is at this point that I would like to question and supplement my earlier line of thinking.What precisely is this continuum intended to capture?What deter mines the particular location on it that a position will occupy? 

One thing it might be intended to capture is the amount of change that a position posits in the subject of experience. On the left we have the Naiyāyika position according to which the self is eternally unchanging. On the right we have the Buddhist position according to which the subject is changing, both qualitatively and numerically, in every moment. But for Rāmakaṇṭha the self is completely unmodifiable (avikārya), so on this measure his position should fall with Nyāya at the left hand extreme. 

One thing it was certainly intended to capture is heaviness or lightness of postulation. On the right we have the Buddhist position that postulates no more than all the disputants agree exists: a sequence of cognitions. On the left we have the Naiyāyika position that postulates an extra entity over and above that: an eternal self that is the owner and knower of those cognitions. On this

92 watson 

measure it looks as though the Naiyāyika position should indeed fall to the left of Rāmakaṇṭha’s: the former seems to postulate two things where Rāmakaṇṭha postulates only one. 

But even here there is a consideration that seems to negate this difference. Rāmakaṇṭha actually accepts two very different kinds of “cognition” ( jñāna). In Rāmakaṇṭha’s discussions with Buddhism, a common objection put by the Buddhist pūrvapakṣin is: if cognition ( jñāna) is unchanging and single,8 as you Saiddhāntikas claim, how can we account for the difference between a cognition of blue, a cognition of yellow, an awareness of pain, an awareness of pleasure, etc.? Rāmakaṇṭha’s usual answer is to maintain that throughout such a sequence cognition itself is indeed single and unchanging.9 All change happens on the object side of the subject-object (grāhaka-grāhya) divide. The subject/perceiver, i.e. cognition or awareness, is like a light shining out always in the same form; the red, blue, pleasure and pain are different objects that are illuminated in turn by the light, but they do not affect the nature of the light (= cognition) at all. 

But sometimes he gives a different answer, namely that there are two dif ferent kinds of cognition, i.e. that the word jñāna can be used in two differ ent senses. There is cognition proper, i.e. the self (ātman), the perceiver (grā haka/jñātṛ), and there is the cognition that is located not in the self but in the intellect (buddhi). The first is termed pauruṣaṃ jñānam,10 the cognition of the self, or grāhakātmasaṃvit,11 cognition whose nature is the perceiver; the second is termed adhyavasāyātmakaṃ jñānam12 / adhyavasāyātmikā saṃvit,13 cognition that is of the nature of determination, or parāmarśātma jñānam,14 

8 “Single” here means single in each individual; the Saiddhāntikas, unlike the non-dualistic Śaivas, maintained that each being’s self/consciousness was eternally separate from every other’s.

cognition that is of the nature of verbal determination.15 The second kind is not unitary and unchanging, but divided into discrete instances, verbalizable as, for example, “this is blue,” “this is yellow,” “this is a pain.” If these are discrete instances of cognition ( jñāna), how is this answer compatible with the first answer that all change occurs on the side of objects, not on the side of the sub ject? The answer is that these discrete instances of determination are actually objects of cognition in relation to the perceiver.16 If we are using “cognition” to refer to the perceiver, they are objects of cognition; but they themselves can be referred to as “cognitions” if we understand “cognitions” to mean determina tions (adhyavasāya, parāmarśa). These products of the intellect (buddhi) are transient, i.e. plural over time; the nature of the self is unchanging and single over time. 

This is no innovation of Rāmakaṇṭha’s: both the earlier exegetes in his Sai ddhāntika tradition, and the Saiddhāntika scriptures themselves, locate jñāna at two different places on the scale of tattvas that is partially inherited from Sāṅkhya: within the material world (i.e. that which evolves out of māyā) at the level of buddhi-tattva, where jñana features as one of the eight properties (referred to in Śaiva literature with such terms as bhāva, dharma, guṇa, aṅga) of the buddhi,17 and as the immaterial nature of selves (which are qualitatively, but not numerically, identical to Śiva). 

Bearing in mind this distinction between two different kinds of cognition, let us revisit the situation that is illustrated in figure 4.4. That diagram, since it prints the line under Rāmakaṇṭha on the same level as the dotted line under Nyāya and the dotted line under Buddhism, makes the following assumptions: (1) Cognition for Rāmakaṇṭha refers to (more or less) the same thing as cogni tion for Nyāya. (2) Cognition for Rāmakaṇṭha refers to (more or less) the same thing as cognition for Buddhism. These were not unreasonable assumptions. They reflect the way that Rāmakaṇṭha himself presents the situation. When arguing against Nyāya, he effectively says: unlike you Naiyāyikas, we accept only cognition, not some extra self over and above that in which it inheres.18 

15 For an elaboration of Rāmakaṇṭha’s distinction between these two kinds of cognition, see Watson 2006, 360–382. 

16 See Kiraṇavṛtti ad 1:15, p. 18,33–35, Parākhyatantra 4:93ab, Tattvasaṅgraha of Sadyojyotis 13ab, Mṛgendratantra, vidyāpāda 10:23, Boccio 2002, and Watson 2006, 376ff. 

17 Seefor example Parākhyatantra 4:74ff., Mataṅgapārameśvara 17.2, Mṛgendratantra, vidyā pāda 10:24 (cited at Goodall 2004, 254, note 383), Bhogakārikā 55, and Sadyojyotis’ com mentary on Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha 2:12. This feature of Śaivism is inherited from Sāṅkhya; see Sāṅkhyakārikā 23.

figure 4.5 Rāmakaṇṭha’s view as equivalent to Nyāya 

And when arguing against Buddhism he assures us that his self/cognition is just the jñāna that Buddhists talk about, not some container of it, some self substance to which it belongs.19 

But now that we have seen that Rāmakaṇṭha actually recognizes two kinds of cognition, different possible assumptions, and hence different possibilities for the drawing of the diagram, emerge. We could take Buddhist jñāna as cor responding more to Rāmakaṇṭha’s plural cognitions. And if we do, then the fact that Rāmakaṇṭha adds an extra layer above that makes him very much akin to Nyāya—at least on this point of how many things they are postulating. 

Similarly, we could take Rāmakaṇṭha’s first kind of cognition as compara ble to Nyāya’s self, and the second kind as comparable to Nyāya’s cognitions ( jñāna). When we adopt this perspective, the difference between Nyāya and Rāmakaṇṭha regarding the extent of their postulation disappears. We arrive at the situation depicted in figure 4.5. 

To what extent is it reasonable to take the first kind of cognition as equiva lent to Nyāya’s self? It is reasonable to the extent that we are aligning Nyāya’s self and Rāmakaṇṭha’s self, though the former is not of the nature of jñāna whereas the latter is. To what extent is it reasonable to take the second kind of cognition as equivalent to Nyāya’s cognitions and Buddhism’s cognitions? The fact that the second kind is plural makes it a more natural equivalent than the unitary first kind; but the fact that the second kind of cognition is uncon scious (a product of primal matter) makes it less equivalent to Buddhist and Naiyāyika cognitions, which are sparks of awareness, than the first kind, which is equivalent to awareness. 

As well as the amount of change in the subject, and the amount of postu lation, there is a third possibility for what the continuum could capture: the amount of dynamism in the subject. On this measure does Rāmakaṇṭha’s self 

only the Naiyāyikas, but also the Vaiśeṣikas and Sāṅkhyas, on the grounds that they all accept a self over and above cognition, whereas he accepts only cognition. 

19 See Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa ad 1.5, pp. 13,5–14,2 (discussed and translated in Watson 2006, 213–220); and Kiraṇavṛtti ad 2:25ab, p. 53,4–8 (discussed and translated in Watson 2010, 87–89).

fall closer to a Buddhist stream of consciousness than a Naiyāyika self does? Yes. Nyāya’s rock-like20 self is in its own nature devoid of consciousness and agency; Rāmakaṇṭha’s is of the nature of an outpouring—the outpouring of the light of consciousness—and during liberation it remains not just conscious, but also an agent. But Rāmakaṇṭha’s self is not as dynamic as that of the non-dualistic Śaivas. For them vimarśa, representative cognition, is a power (śakti) of the self.21 Rāmakaṇṭha resists this move, since for him (as for them) there is no dif ference between a power and the thing that has the power (śakti and śaktimat), so to accept that vimarśa, which is changing, is a power of the self would have been to accept some change in the self. Vimarśa for him belongs in the buddhi, not the self;22 so it does not affect the unchanging nature of the self. Rāmakaṇ ṭha was more concerned than the non-dualist Śaivas to protect the self from any change, though his self does have more dynamism than a Naiyāyika one. There is a tension in Rāmakaṇṭha’s self between its lack of change and its dynamism, one to which we will return in the final paragraphs of the article. 

4 Rāmakaṇṭha More Extreme Than Nyāya 

We have seen that by two out of these three measures, Rāmakaṇṭha’s self looks to be just as “extreme” as Nyāya’s. In fact there is one consideration that arguably makes it more extreme. Rāmakaṇṭha’s self is perhaps even further removed from change than Nyāya’s, given that for Nyāya changing cognitions 

20 See Nyāyamañjarī vol. 2 p. 432,4: jaḍaḥ pāṣāṇanirviśeṣa eva tasyām avasthāyām ātmā bhavet; “The self in that state [of liberation] would be unconscious, just like a rock.” These words are put by Jayanta into the mouth of an opponent; but the Naiyāyika siddhāntin does not deny the similarity of the liberated soul to a rock. I thank Harunaga Isaacson for this reference. 

21 See Sanderson 1992, 288–289. 

22 See (1) Mataṅgavṛtti, vidyāpāda ad 6:35b–d, p. 175,4–5 (and Watson 2006, 366), where Rāmakaṇtha asserts that parāmarśa, despite rising and passing away, does not indicate the non-eternality of the self, as it occurs not in the self but in the buddhi (and the ahaṅkāra): that vimarśa is synonymous with parāmarśa for Rāmakaṇṭha is suggested by Nareśvara parīkṣāprakāśa ad 1:17, pp. 41,5–44,3 (translated and discussed in Watson 2006, 313–332), where they are used interchangeably; (2) Kiraṇavṛtti ad 2:25ab, pp. 53,10–54,17, where Rāmakaṇṭha distinguishes adhyavasāya, which is transient and a property (dharma) of the buddhi, from saṃvedanātmakaṃ jñānam, which belongs to the soul and is always occurrent; that Rāmakaṇtha uses adhyavasāya and parāmarśa (and niścaya) as synonyms is suggested by Mataṅgavṛtti, vidyāpāda ad 6:35b–d, p. 174,4–175,9; (3) Mataṅgavṛtti, vidyā pāda ad 17:2, p. 382,12–21, which distinguishes adhyavasāya fromsaṃvedana and identifies the former as the svabhāva of the buddhi; (4) Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa ad 1:6ab, p. 28,12– 19, where adhyavasāya is said to be a guṇa of the buddhi.

inhere in the self. For Rāmakaṇṭha, by contrast, changing cognitions, as we saw above, are objects of awareness (grāhya) for the self; they occur outside of it, in the intellect (buddhi). So we arrive at a different continuum, illustrated in figure 4.6, where the large circle is the self and the dotted lines are cognitions. The position that postulates the most amount of change in the subject is the Buddhist position on the right; the position that postulates the least amount of change in the subject is Rāmakaṇṭha’s position on the left; Nyāya falls in the middle. 

And what is asserted here of cognitions is also true of latent impressions (saṃskāras), pleasures and pains.Whereas for Nyāya these all reside in the self, Rāmakaṇṭha and his fellow Saiddhāntikas, arguing that this would entail the unwanted consequence that the self is subject to change, locate latent impres sions, pleasures and pains outside of the self in the buddhi.23 

The fact that we are dealing here with two different conceptions of the rela tionship between self and cognitions—for Nyāya inherence (samavāya), and for Rāmakaṇṭha a subject-object relation (grāhyagrāhakabhāva)—means that certain objections that are put to Rāmakaṇṭha are not so applicable to Nyāya. 

First, a common objection that is articulated in Buddhist texts against a Sāṅkhya self,24 and in Rāmakaṇṭha’s texts as a Buddhist objection to his own view,25 is as follows. If the self were completely unmodifiable, it would not be able to perceive objects, for to perceive a pot, say, followed by a cloth requires being able to register the change in the object-sphere from the pot to the cloth. And there is no way to register a change without being affected by the change. The way in which a perceiver perceives an object is by being modified by that 

23 See Mataṅgavṛtti, vidyāpāda ad 17:2, p. 383,1–8 and ad 6:34c–35a, pp. 173,11–174,1. 24 E.g. Tattvasaṅgraha of Śāntarakṣita 287 and 288. 

25 See Mataṅgavṛtti, vidyāpāda introducing 6:34c–35a, p. 172,7–10; Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa introducing 1:6ab, p. 17,3–4; and Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa ad 1.6ab, p. 26,19–20. 
 

object in some way.If the perceiver is permanently unaffected and unmodified, it is mysterious how it can be a perceiver. 

Here the Naiyāyika will respond that the self is modified to the extent that separate cognitions inhere in it, the first caused by the pot and the second caused by the cloth. 

Second, Rāmakaṇṭha combines the claim that the self is unmodifiable with the claim that it is an agent. This lays him open to an objection that, unlike the last one, is not applicable to Sāṅkhya: how can something that is beyond all change be an agent? There are two aspects to this objection. (1) How can something that does not itself “move” cause movement? Here Rāmakaṇṭha’s response is to adduce the example of a magnet. A magnet causes movement in iron filings without itself moving; so similarly, the self causes bodily movement without itself moving.26 But even if it were conceded that the magnet example renders plausible a self as “unmoving mover,” there is a related but different problem. (2) If the self is beyond all change, how can we explain that at one moment it brings about one action and at another moment it brings about a completely different action? Surely an agent that is always in the same state would have to either always be doing nothing or always be doing exactly the same thing? 

Here again, the objection is not so applicable to Naiyāyikas, for they accept the existence of different impulses (prayatnas) that inhere in the self. A prior bodily movement will be brought about by a particular impulse, and a subse quent, different kind of bodily movement will be brought about by a different impulse. 

5 Nyāya Not so Moderate after All 

Section 3 gave reasons for judging Rāmakaṇṭha’s position not to fall in the mid dle ground between Nyāya and Buddhism, but to be just as extreme as Nyāya. Section 4 gave reasons for judging Rāmakaṇṭha’s position to be more extreme than Nyāya’s, with the latter as the moderate one, closer to Buddhism. But this section introduces a consideration that reveals Nyāya to be not so mod erate after all. 

It is true that Nyāya holds cognitions, impulses (prayatna), latent impres sions (saṃskāra), pleasures, pains, etc., to inhere in the self, whereas Rāmakaṇ 

26 Kiraṇavṛtti ad 3:1; Paramokṣanirāsakārikāvṛtti ad 3c, pp. 115,99–116,106; andWatson, Good all and Sarma 2013, 258–259, especially note 196.

ṭha (in accord with his Sāṅkhya inheritance)27 locates all of these outside of the self, indeed outside of the realm of the immaterial altogether, within the world derived from māyā and prakṛti. We thus seem to be left with the picture given in figure 4.6, where the small lines can represent any of the things just listed: they fall within the self for Nyāya, but outside of it for Rāmakaṇṭha. But the statement that they fall within the self for Nyāya has to be qualified. For Nyāya actually regards them as part of the “not-self.” How can that be, given that they are qualities of the self? Because of Nyāya’s view of the firm differ ence between a thing and its qualities (guṇaguṇibheda). Any substance for Nyāya is a completely different thing from its qualities. Change in the quali ties of a substance will not necessarily result in any change or modification of the substance. And there is even more distance between the self and its quali ties than there is between a physical substance and its qualities. For the self is eternal, its qualities temporary; it is omnipresent, while they are restricted to a particular location.28 This Naiyāyika idea that the self in particular, and sub stances in general, are unaffected by changes in their qualities was one of the things that separated their view from that of Kumārila and the Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃ sakas. For the latter held the relation between a thing and its qualities to be difference-cum-nondifference (bhedābheda); they maintained that changes in the qualities of a thing do affect the thing itself. The self, for them, although never ceasing to exist, is subject to modification when its qualities change.29 The fact that the Naiyāyikas rejected this, protecting the self from any effect of change in its qualities, means that their view cannot be so starkly differentiated from Rāmakaṇṭha’s view as figure 4.6 suggests. 

This impression is strengthened by Naiyāyika passages dealing with libera tion (apavarga, mokṣa). Here Naiyāyika authors assert that the self’s nature is, and always has been, free of all its particular qualities (sakalaguṇāpoḍha).30 These qualities are thus irrelevant to its nature. They are described as extrinsic to it, not innate (na naisargikaḥ).31 They are part of the “not-self” with which it confuses itself while in saṃsāra, and which is to be abandoned (heya).32 

This thoroughgoing difference and separateness of the self’s qualities from the self—indicated by all of the considerations above—means that the Nyāya

6 Concluding Remarks 

Where do all of these divergent analyses leave us? What is cancelled out by what? It may be better to see each perspective as having its own validity. We have four perspectives: 

1. Rāmakaṇṭha in the middle ground (section 2 and Watson 2014). 2. Rāmakaṇṭha as just as extreme as Nyāya (section 3). 

3. Rāmakaṇṭha as more extreme than Nyāya (section 4). 

4. Rāmakaṇṭha as just as extreme as Nyāya (section 5). 

Or rather, three perspectives, since 2 and 4 are the same. In what sense is 1 valid? The Śaiva equating of self and consciousness/cognition and its view of the self as the shining forth of prakāśa, the light of consciousness, is indeed something that differentiates Rāmakaṇṭha’s view from Nyāya in substantial and significant ways. Related to this is the Śaiva rejection of the existence of substances (dravya) over and above qualities (guṇa), or property-possessors (dharmin) over and above properties (dharma). And just as, for Rāmakaṇṭha, there is no self-substance over and above consciousness/cognition, so too there is no self as agent (kartṛ) or knower ( jñātṛ/grāhaka) over and above conscious ness/cognition. From the point of view of this equating of self and conscious ness, perspective 1 is valid, and figure 4.4 captures a certain relationship that Rāmakaṇṭha’s position bears to Nyāya and Buddhism. This perspective and this figure also accord with the way that Rāmakaṇṭha’s self is more dynamic than Nyāya’s. 

But it is not valid to see things only in this way, because when we add the consideration that Rāmakaṇṭha accepts two kinds of cognition, this allows for

the possibility of aligning not his first kind, but his second kind (that which is plural and is located in the buddhi) with Nyāya’s and Buddhism’s cognition. When we do that, and we add Rāmakaṇṭha’s self (i.e. his first kind of cogni tion) above that, his position becomes equivalent to Nyāya’s (both in terms of the number of things postulated and the amount of change in the self)—and figure 4.5 becomes appropriate. 

But this does not exhaust the number of ways of seeing the relationship between Rāmakaṇṭha and Nyāya, because there is a further significant consid eration. While it is true that the selves of both Nyāya and Śaivasiddhānta are eternally unchanging (which supports the idea that they are both as extreme as each other: perspective 2), it is also the case that cognitions, impulses (pra yatna), latent impressions (saṃskāra), pleasures, pains, etc., inhere in the self for Nyāya, but fall completely outside it for Rāmakaṇṭha. Emphasizing this makes it appear that Rāmakaṇṭha’s self, like a Sāṅkhya self, is even more removed from change than Nyāya’s. This perspective 3 (illustrated in figure 4.6) carries some weight, but is no final resting place, for if we concentrate on those places where Nyāya emphasizes that qualities are extrinsic to substances, and that consciousness/cognitions, etc., are part of the not-self, not affecting its nature in any way, then it appears that there is in fact no more change in a Naiyāyika self than a Saiddhāntika one. So to adopt perspective 4 is to revert to perspective 2, which this time can be illustrated with a slightly different dia gram: figure 4.7. 

The explanation for the difference between perspectives 3 and 4 is a cer tain tension within Nyāya, one that was already noted by Frauwallner in 1956.33 Frauwallner argues that the Naiyāyika self is the product of two separate influ ences. On the one hand, it derives from the self as characterized in the old philosophy of nature; on the other hand it was subject to continual attrac tion to the self of the Sāṅkhyas. According to the former, selves were of limited size, and hence capable of movement; they were that which transmigrates from body to body; and they were all qualitatively distinct from each other, as a result of being characterized by their own qualities (svaguṇaviśiṣṭa). There was thus a huge difference between these selves and those of Sāṅkhya: the latter were all pervading and hence incapable of movement; it was not they that transmigrate (but rather a subtle body); and they were devoid of all qualities. But over time the difference of the selves of the Naiyāyikas and Vaiśeṣikas from those of the Sāṅkhyas decreased. The former became all-pervading and hence incapable of movement; they ceased to be that which transmigrates from body to body

(the manas took on this role); and their relationship to their qualities became reassessed. They were no longer characterized by their own qualities (svagu ṇaviśiṣṭa); rather those qualities came to be regarded as extrinsic to them, as part of the not-self, and as needing to be abandoned if the self is to rest in its own nature. Previously selves were affected by changes in their qualities; subse quently they were not. Previously selves were qualitatively different from each other; subsequently they were all qualitatively identical as a result of being, in their true nature, devoid of particular qualities. 

The residues in a Naiyāyika self of earlier philosophy of nature weigh in favour of perspective 3; the influence of the Sāṅkhya model of a self pulls it towards perspective 4. 

Just as the difference between perspectives 3 and 4 results from focusing on different aspects of Nyāya, so the difference between perspectives 1 and 2 results from focusing on different aspects of Śaivasiddhānta. Just as we have offered an explanation of the first difference in terms of a tension within Nyāya, is there also an explanation of the second difference in terms of a tension within Śaivasiddhānta? In fact there is. Rāmakaṇṭha’s self is one whose nature derives to a large extent from Sāṅkhya: passing cognitions do not inhere in it, saṃskāras do not reside in it, pleasures and pains fall outside of it. It is elevated above all change; it sits above and beyond the various tattvas that comprise the psycho-physical universe. This is the kind of self that Rāmakaṇṭha inherits from his scriptural tradition. But his concept of self is also the result of a sec ond influence, one which goes back to some of the Śaiva scriptures34 and which had been increasingly making itself felt among the Śaivas of Kashmir (both Saiddhāntikas such as Nārayaṇakaṇṭha and non-dualists such as Utpaladeva) during the previous century. This second influence sees the self not as a static Sāṅkhya-like entity, but as dynamic and as an outpouring of light (prakāśa)— the light of cognition/consciousness. The contrast between the two influences is strong. (1) According to the first influence it is a passive non-agent; according to the second it is a fully-fledged agent. I.e., not only is it an agent while unlib erated, as in Nyāya, but it is also an agent in liberation; indeed at that time its agency expands into omnipotence. (2) According to the first, jñāna falls com pletely outside of the self; according to the second, the self is of the nature of jñāna. 

Perspective 2 (which was presented in section 3) results from focusing on the first influence, the Sāṅkhya inheritance. Perspective 1 (presented in section 2) results from focusing on the new Śaiva insights.

### 5 Some Hitherto Unknown Fragments of 

Utpaladeva’s Vivṛti (II): Against the Existence of External Objects 

Isabelle Ratié 

1 Fragments of Utpaladeva’s Vivṛti in Marginal Annotations of Manuscripts Belonging to the Pratyabhijñā Corpus 

Raffaele Torella’s discovery and remarkable edition of the only (and very incomplete) manuscript of the Vivṛti thus far known1 has enabled us to deter mine with certainty that some marginal annotations in manuscripts of Abhi navagupta’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī (henceforth ĪPV) and Īśvarapratya bhijñāvivṛtivimarśinī (henceforth ĪPVV) regularly quote Utpaladeva’s lost work. Nine of the ĪPV manuscripts that I have been able to consult contain such quotations;2 two ĪPVV manuscripts3 known to me bear several fragments, the most important of which is by far the lengthiest Vivṛti fragment known to date (including the one found in the codex unicus edited by Raffaele Torella), covering three Vivṛti chapters;4 and two manuscripts of the Īśvarapratyabhi jñāvṛtti (henceforth Vṛtti) have been shown to contain some much shorter Vivṛti quotations.5 The following pages are an attempt to edit and translate 

1 The manuscript as it stands now only covers verses 1.3.6 to 1.5.3. See Torella 1988 (this first part of the fragment was in fact edited from a transcript of the original manuscript D later found by R. Torella in the National Archives of India and used for the edition of the remaining parts of the fragment), and Torella 2007a, 2007b, 2007c and 2007d. 

2 For a list of parallels between marginal annotations in D2, SOAS and S3 and the fragment edited by R. Torella, see Ratié 2016. Five other ĪPV manuscripts—namely JR, S2, S5, S7, S9— have been shown to contain such fragments in Ratié 2016b, and one more (S15) in Ratié forthcoming (see also below).

5 See Kawajiri 2016 and 2016b for a diplomatic edition of marginal annotations containing Vivṛti quotations in a Vṛtti manuscript from Lucknow in Devanāgarī script. Note, however, that S19 (a Śāradā manuscript used by Raffaele Torella for his edition of the Vṛtti) also con tains many Vivṛti fragments. It is described in Torella 2002, l–li (under siglum N) as “profusely annotated by a different hand with single glosses or long passages (mostly drawn from the ĪPV) between the lines and often entirely covering the margins.” Indeed, many of these quota

some brief marginal annotations borrowed from Utpaladeva’s lost Vivṛti on Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā (henceforth ĪPK) 1.5.6 and 1.5.8–9.6 

This is no easy task, because very little is known of the source(s), purpose(s) and history of these annotations,7 and because most of the time their authors do not specify whether they are quoting8—and if so, which text9—or rather giving a comment of their own. We can quite safely assume that these anno tations are indeed genuine quotations from the Vivṛti whenever we can find in them a sequence of words corresponding exactly to the pratīkas in Abhi navagupta’s ĪPVV. However, Abhinavagupta’s quotations of the Vivṛti are some times so brief that we cannot always reach such a high level of probability, as can be seen from one problematic instance below.10 Besides, the marginal 

tions are from the ĪPV; but some are Vivṛti fragments, as shown in Ratié forthcoming (see also Ratié 2018b, Appendix I). S19 was not taken into account here, not because it would be irrelevant (its margins bear several fragments on ĪPK 1.5.6–9, and interestingly, most of them are not found in the ĪPV and ĪPVV manuscripts used below), but because unfortu nately, I made this discovery too late to incorporate the new findings in this article. 

6 So far I have not found any Vivṛti quotation on ĪPK 1.5.7 in ĪPV or ĪPVV manuscripts. It should also be noted that S12, to which I only recently had access, bears the frag ment edited in Ratié 2016, 239–240 from marginal annotations in S3. In S12 the frag ment appears in the margins of folios 119A–120B. The missing words in S3 (Ratié 2016, 239, note 35) appear as tathā carati in S12; the compound parajñānaviṣayabhāvagamanā bhisandhir (ibid., 239, §1, last line) has the wrong reading parajñānaparajñānaviṣaya bhāvagamanābhisandhir; S12 shares with S3 the wrong readings °vyavahārādy° instead of °vyāhārādy° (see ibid., 239, note 36 and 37), and occasionally reads °vyavahārādy° where S3 has the right reading °vyāhārādy° (in tajjñānagatavyāhārādy°, ibid., 239, §2, line 5); it reads yadi where S3 has yad iha (ibid., 239, §2, line 6—I had conjectured yadi hi); it also has ābhāsabhedahetutva° instead of ābhāsabhede hetutva° (ibid., 240, §5, line 5); it shares with S3 the wrong readings yathāvabhāsānāṃ (see ibid., 240, note 41) and pramā tṛprābhāsaparyavasānaṃ (see ibid., 240, note 42); finally, it reads nāpi pratibodhitā ekaiva instead of S3’s nādhipratitvocitaikaiva (and my conjecture nādhipatitvocitaikaiva). 

7 See Formigatti 2011 and Ratié 2018b. Formigatti 2011 (a very interesting study of marginal annotations in Sanskrit manuscripts from northern India and Nepal) bears in part on ĪPV manuscripts; unfortunately it makes no mention of Vivṛti fragments, although at least one of the manuscripts examined, Ś7 (= S9 in the present paper), contains quotations from Utpaladeva’s detailed auto-commentary (see Ratié 2016b). The reason for this is that due to the length of the ĪPV, Formigatti chose to confine his research to the annotations on the first chapter, which are apparently devoid of such quotations. 

8 This happens, however: see Ratié 2016, 228, note 10, and below, note 58. 

9 The marginal annotations most often quote from Utpaladeva’s Vṛtti and Abhinavagupta’s ĪPVV, but other works are occasionally cited, including Śaiva texts (such as the Śivadṛṣṭi) as well as Buddhist works (e.g. Dharmakīrti’s Sambandhaparīkṣā) or Brahmanical treatises (e.g. Jayanta’s Nyāyamañjarī): see Ratié 2017, 165.

annotations are sometimes barely legible, and Utpaladeva’s prose is difficult. For all these reasons, both the edition and translation given here are only ten tative. 

2 The Context and Gist of Fragments 1–3 on ĪPK 1.5.6 

The overall context of the fragments presented here is a controversy over the existence of a reality external to consciousness, and Utpaladeva’s main inter locutor at this point of the debate is a Buddhist Sautrāntika.11 The latter admits that we can never have direct access to any reality existing beyond conscious ness, since the objects of our perceptions are nothing but internal aspects (ākāra) of consciousness; yet he claims that an external reality must be inferred so as to account for phenomenal variety: according to him, consciousness is in itself an undifferentiated manifesting entity or light (prakāśamātra), so that the variety of objects of which we are aware must have a cause outside of con sciousness, just as a variety of reflections in a mirror must have as its cause a 

11 On the portrayal of this philosophical figure by the Śaiva nondualists and Utpaladeva’s refutation of his thesis (both of which are only briefly outlined here), see Ratié 2011, 368– 402 and 442–473, and Ratié 2011b.

variety of forms existing outside of the mirror. In ĪPK 1.5.6, Utpaladeva endeav ours to criticize this thesis by showing that the sphere of ordinary human prac tice (vyavahāra) functions on the mere basis of phenomena (so that from this practical point of view, at least, all inquiries into the existence of an external reality are useless) and that further, an external object is not even rationally possible, so that there is no point in assuming the existence of such an absurd object.12 

In fragment no. 1, Utpaladeva first points out that human activities pertain only to phenomena and that no inquiry over a potential external object is needed to ensure practical success in the everyday world: in the course of ordi nary existence we are content to deal with mere manifestations, because these manifestations are endowed with an efficacy (arthakriyā) capable of fulfilling our needs (when we are hungry, we do not ask ourselves whether mangoes exist outside our consciousness: we look for the phenomenon of a mango and are content with experiencing its perceptible effects, since no entity by nature imperceptible can be consumed or utilized).13 

To this the Sautrāntika could reply that assuming the existence of some imperceptible entities is nonetheless a necessary requirement if we are to make sense of our own perceptions; thus most Indian philosophical systems acknowledge that our eyes, which are perceptible elements of our body, are not enough to explain the phenomenon of vision (since blind people too may possess them), so that we must consider them (as well as our ears, etc.) as mere receptacles for the real sense organs (indriya), understood as instruments of perception that are too subtle to be perceptible, but that must nonetheless be inferred from the fact that we do perceive. Utpaladeva’s opponent argues that just as we must assume the existence of the imperceptible indriyas so as to account for our faculty of perceiving, in the same way, we must infer the existence of an external reality so as to explain phenomenal variety. In response to this argument, Utpaladeva points out in the fragment that con trary to what the Sautrāntika claims, the assumption of the indriyas’ existence is not universally shared among theoreticians, and in this connection he men tions two theses that claim to explain perception without assuming that such 

12 See ĪPK 1.5.6: syād etad avabhāseṣu teṣv evāvasite sati | vyavahāre kim anyena bāhyenānu papattinā ||“Let [us admit] this: since ordinary human practice (vyavahāra) is determined on [the basis of] these manifestations alone, what is the point of some external [object] that would be distinct [from consciousness and] that is not [even] logically possible (anu papatti)?” On the two possible interpretations of syād etat according to Abhinavagupta, see Torella 2002, 114, note 12, and Ratié 2011, 386, note 48.

imperceptible sense organs must exist. According to Abhinavagupta, one of these theses belongs to Bhartṛhari and was expounded in his now lost Ṣaḍ dhātusamīkṣā,14 while the other is that of a “follower of Bṛhaspati” (bārhas patya), i.e., a materialist (cārvāka).15 In fact Utpaladeva disagrees with both theories since in ĪPK 1.5.8–9 he clearly admits that the inference of the indriyas is valid; but contrary to the Sautrāntika, he believes that inferring the existence of a purely imperceptible entity is illegitimate and even impossible (which is why he claims that the indriyas are perceived at least in some respect).16 Most importantly, it seems that his goal here is merely to show that there is no con sensus on the necessity of assuming the indriyas’ existence: the fragment only points out that there are competing ways of explaining perception, some of which do not involve the assumption of imperceptible organs of perception, so that the Sautrāntika cannot invoke any universal agreement on the indriyas in order to substantiate the claim that external objects too must be inferred. 

Utpaladeva then goes one step further in this first fragment and asserts that the investigation of the external object is not only useless but also doomed to failure, because the external object is not rationally possible. 

It is worth noting in this respect that in his commentaries, Abhinavagupta points out that there are two different kinds of argument showing that the external object is impossible from a rational point of view.17 The first one sim ply consists in stating that the external object cannot exist because it cannot be manifest in any way, even as an object of inference.18 The second set of argu ments (which obviously paraphrases Vasubandhu’s Viṃśikā19 but may have been borrowed, at least in part, from Śaṅkaranandana’s synthetic reformula tion of Vasubandhu’s arguments in his Prajñālaṅkāra20) consists in showing that the external object cannot exist because there is no way of satisfactorily

explaining it, whether or not we consider it to be made of parts.21 Abhinav agupta calls the first argument “principal” (mukhya)22 and specifies that while the other, additional arguments focus on the contradictions involved in this or that particular property of the external object, the main argument functions as a global refutation of the external object’s existence.23 This distinction is not found in Utpaladeva’s Vṛtti, which merely mentions what Abhinavagupta calls the “additional” arguments;24 nonetheless, the ĪPVV’s phrasing shows that it was no innovation on Abhinavagupta’s part and that it must have been stated

by Utpaladeva himself in his Vivṛti.25 This is confirmed by the fragments pre sented below. While fragment no. 3—which mentions the famous criticism of atomism in Vasubandhu’s Viṃśikā 11–15—is obviously concerned with the second set of arguments,26 in fragments no. 1 and 3 Utpaladeva clearly refers to the first, “principal” argument against the existence of the external object; thus the end of fragment no. 1 explains that the only possible objects for con sciousness are phenomena and that objects are nothing but the manifesting consciousness (prakāśa), and fragment no. 2 further explains that even objects known through inference must be manifested (avabhāta) in some way so as to be objects for consciousness. 

This latter point is crucial, because the idea that even conceptual objects must be directly manifested in some way is one of the main divergences between Buddhist and Śaiva nondualistic epistemologies, as Abhinavagupta himself makes clear in his commentary.27 The Śaiva nondualists thus accuse the Vijñānavādins of unwittingly granting some legitimacy to the external ism of their Sautrāntika opponents by admitting that contrary to a perceived object, the object of a mere concept does not require any immediate mani festation at the time of its conceptualization. According to the Śaivas, such a concession entails that there is nothing inherently wrong in trying to infer, as the Sautrāntikas do, an external object by nature alien to manifestation, whereas Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta deny the mere possibility of even conceptualizing—and therefore inferring—an entity fundamentally distinct from consciousness.28 

At the end of fragment no. 2, Utpaladeva states a new objection on the part of his externalist opponent. According to the Sautrāntika, if we do not assume the existence of an external reality, we cannot explain why we are aware of a phe nomenal variety that occurs in a specific sequence: there must be a reason for the fact that some things are manifest to us and that these manifestations occur successively rather than simultaneously. As Abhinavagupta puts it, “a manifes tation necessarily requires a cause as regards both [its] arising and [its] not arising,”29 and if we do not attempt to determine that cause, the very notion of causality as well as that of the relationship between the apprehending sub ject and the apprehended object (which, according to the Buddhists, depends

on the causality relationship) is lost. The Sautrāntika’s intention is obviously to have his opponent admit that the only possible cause for this phenomenal vari ety endowed with a specific order is a variety of external objects possessed of a corresponding specific order and projecting their forms onto consciousness. 

Unfortunately, Utpaladeva’s answer to this objection is not to be found in the margins of the manuscripts that I have consulted so far. It is possi ble, however, to retrieve the gist of Utpaladeva’s reply from Abhinavagupta’s ĪPVV: Utpaladeva seems to have argued in the missing passage of the Vivṛti that the Sautrāntika cannot rightfully look for an external cause explaining the arising of manifestations as well as their lack of arising, because reality (understood as a unique and all-encompassing consciousness) is always man ifest and always evident for any conscious entity, in the form of the immedi ate self-awareness inherent in any subjectivity.30 In fact temporal and spatial sequences (kāladeśakrama) are nothing but ways for consciousness to manifest its unitary nature as if it were differentiated, and this differentiated manifesta tion is the result of the fundamental dynamism of consciousness, conceived as a constantly exerted power of manifesting itself in all possible forms. Thus according to the Śaiva nondualists, consciousness is not a mirror passively reflecting a world of objects existing independently of it, and phenomenal vari ety, far from being the mere reflection of such an external world, is an expres sion of consciousness’s freedom (svātantrya) to manifest itself in an infinite variety of forms while playfully hiding its fundamental unity. The Sautrāntika is therefore wrong to assume that phenomenal variety and its spatio-temporal sequence can only be explained by postulating an external cause, since they can be accounted for as the result of the freedom of consciousness31—a free 

30 See e.g. ĪPVV, vol.

And [Utpaladeva] has explained this in the verse on [the Self being] always already established.” The verse to which Abhinavagupta is alluding here is ĪPK 1.1.2: kartari jñātari svātmany ādisiddhe maheśvare | ajaḍātmā niṣedhaṃ vā siddhiṃ vā vidadhīta kaḥ || “What conscious Self could produce either a refutation or a demonstration [of the existence] of the agent, the know ing subject, the always already established (ādisiddha) Self, the Great Lord?”

dom which, contrary to an external object, is experienced by all conscious beings, for example when they imagine.32 

3 The Context and Gist of Fragments 4–6? on ĪPK 1.5.8–9 

In ĪPK 1.5.8–9,33 Utpaladeva comes back to the Sautrāntika’s contention that the external object can and must be inferred, and he endeavours to show that this inference is simply impossible. In fragment no. 4, he first argues that infer ential knowledge is conceptual in nature and that the concept in which the inference results arises thanks to the residual trace (saṃskāra) left by a previ ous experience. When we draw from the fact that a distant hill is smoky the conclusion that there must be a fire there, our concept of fire arises thanks to our previous experiences of fire and smoke; fire can be a conceptual object for us only because we have already witnessed fires in the past, and these previous experiences of fire have left in the conscious stream a trace that is reactivated when we form the inferential concept of “fire.” It is this residual trace that guar antees the possibility for the conceptual object to be an object manifest for consciousness, as well as the reliability of concepts as tools in the sphere of human practice, because it enables an object directly perceived in the past but no longer existing to be manifested again. 

The consequence of this remark is that the external object cannot be inferred precisely because it is by nature imperceptible: it has never been man ifest to any consciousness (if it had, it would not be external) so that we cannot form any concept of it.34 Utpaladeva also points out that an inference is valid insofar as it manifests the conceptual object as particularized by a specific time and place rather than as a pure abstraction: our knowledge that a hill is on fire 

32 See Ratié 2010b.

[Before being inferred,] a sense organ has already been manifested [at least in the general form of a cause] through the manifestation of a real entity that [happens to be] a cause, such as a seed [which is the cause of a sprout]; but the mani festation of an object external to manifestation has never occurred in any way. Therefore there can be no establishment of this [external object]—not even through an inference.”

II, 161: tad anupapannaṃ saṃvidbāhyasya svapne ’py anābhātasya vikalpya tvāyogād anumeyatānupapannā yataḥ. “This [inference of an object particularized by its being external to consciousness] is impossible, since [an entity] external to conscious ness—[and therefore] unmanifested, even in a dream—cannot be an object of inference, because [such an entity] cannot be the object of a concept.”

because it is smoky would be useless if it were not the knowledge that the par ticular hill currently seen is on fire—an idea shared with the Dharmakīrtians, particularly Dharmottara35 (who might be targeted, here as in Abhinavagupta’s ĪPVV, as the Sautrāntikas’ most prominent champion).36 Here too, Utpaladeva does not explicitly draw the consequence of this affirmation, but his aim is probably to show that the external object cannot be inferred because, as he emphasizes later in the treatise, spatial and temporal relations, which are noth ing but a partial incompatibility between some determined phenomena, can only belong to manifest entities,37 whereas the external object must remain purely indeterminate as regards form, time and space. 

To this argument the Sautrāntika could object—and obviously did in a now missing passage of the Vivṛti—that some inferences do not rest on a pre vious perception and actually regard an entity that is by nature impercep tible. According to Abhinavagupta’s commentaries, here Utpaladeva’s oppo nent relies on the traditional distinction between the pratyakṣatodṛṣṭa and sāmānyatodṛṣṭa types of inference,38 and he argues that in the case of the sense organs, the indriyas are not inferred as some particular entity directlywitnessed in the past, but as a mere generality (sāmānya), i.e. as a “mere something” (kiñ cinmātra) that must be assumed as a purely indeterminate cause of perception. This enables the Sautrāntika to claim that the external object can be inferred as the cause in general of phenomenal variety, although just as the sense organs, it has never been perceived.39 

Fragment no. 5 is a response to the Sautrāntika’s objection. Utpaladeva claims that the reason why we can infer the sense organs as a mere indetermi nate cause of perception is that in fact the sense organs have already been per ceived, at least in the general form of a cause. Utpaladeva can afford to defend this paradoxical thesis because he has already shown that the perception of any particular entity is in fact the synthetic apprehension of a number of elemen tary phenomena (ābhāsa) that, when put together, constitute the singularity of the perceived entity, but that, when taken separately, function as generalities (sāmānya).40 This means that according to him, the generality “causality” is in fact directly perceived in all our experiences of entities endowed with a causal

power (for instance, in our perception of a seed capable of producing a sprout, or in that of clay as the material cause of a pot).41 

Of course, Utpaladeva’s strategy here might seem very risky, since the Sautrāntika could argue that just as the sense organs are inferred as a mere general cause enabling us to account for the phenomenon of perception (a general cause already perceived in countless previous experiences of partic ular causes), in the same way, the external object can be inferred as a mere generality, given that the generality “externality” is constantly experienced in the course of everyday life: we can draw the concept of an object external to consciousness from our past experiences of objects external to houses, villages, mirrors, etc. If Utpaladeva concedes that the sense organs have already been perceived as a general cause and can legitimately be inferred as such, he should accept the same kind of reasoning regarding the external object inferred as a mere “external thing” in general. This objection is the content of fragment no. 6?. As explained below,42 I am not sure whether this last passage really is a fragment of the Vivṛti; but if it is not, it must at least be a paraphrase of it, because Abhinavagupta’s ĪPVV43 shows that Utpaladeva had expressed this very objection in the Vivṛti. 

Unfortunately, once more Utpaladeva’s answer to this objection is missing from the margins of the manuscripts thatI was able to consult; but here too, the gist of his answer is preserved in Abhinavagupta’s commentaries on ĪPK 1.5.9.44 Utpaladeva apparently argued first that in the case of the sense organs, what is inferred as a cause is a mere generality, whereas in the case of the exter nal object, the Sautrāntika tries to infer a cause that is not a mere generality since it is particularized by the peculiar property of being external to conscious ness. Now, contrary to the notion of causality, this property cannot have been included in any previous perception; indeed, we do perceive entities that are external to other entities, but the case of an entity external to consciousness is radically different from that of the pot being external to a house or a mirror, because in the latter examples externality only means a spatial relationship of proximity between two forms occupying a particular place, whereas when the Sautrāntika talks about an object external to conscious manifestations, he does not have in mind an object that would stand next to consciousness (since con sciousness is not spatially determined): he rather means an object that is not 

41 As noted by Torella (2002, 116, note 18), Utpaladeva thus “include[s] the concept of sāmānyatodṛṣṭa within the pratyakṣatodṛṣṭa.”

consciousness. Such an object cannot be conceptualized on the basis of our for mer perceptions involving externality, since there is only a “verbal similarity” (śabdasāmya) between the externality (i.e. proximity) of a pot with respect to a house, and the externality (i.e. absolute otherness) of an object with respect to consciousness. And the latter type of externality constitutes the very limit of our power of conceptualization, since however wild our imagination may be, we are incapable of picturing anything that would be by nature alien to con scious manifestation. This experience of our limitation as conscious beings is paradoxically what reveals the infinite power of consciousness: the very notion of a reality existing beyond consciousness is unthinkable and therefore absurd, and according to the Śaiva nondualists, this means that whatever exists only exists as a manifestation of consciousness.

Vincent Eltschinger and Eli Franco both suggested eliminating the negation as a corrup tion instead of doubling it, and they might be right. However, I personally find the double negation more in accordance with the writing habits of Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta (I am assuming that the former shared with the latter a propensity for double negations). For his part Eli Franco considers that “nobody writes like this” and that “if a second nega tion should be added, one would expect it in the beginning ( yathā na hi …).” (Personal written communication.) However, there is no doubt that at least Abhinavagupta writes

50 parasparātmakatvam ] S3, S12, note 170 ĪPV (vol. I, 176); parasparātmatvam S15, JR. There is a discrepancy here between the text of the Vivṛti as found in the marginal anno tations (parasparātmakatvam) and Abhinavagupta’s pratīka in the ĪPVV (pratītiparam parātmaketi). Abhinavagupta’s explanation, however, seems to require rather parasparāt maketi since it makes no mention of a series or succession (paramparā) of cognitions (pratīti) and explains that ultimately the vyavahāra requires the identity of the object with the manifesting consciousness (see below, note 92), which fits with the text given in the marginal annotations. So I assume that parasparātmaketi first got corrupted into paramparātmaketi and that someone then added pratīti° to try and make sense of this “succession,” but I might be entirely wrong (this pratīka might in fact belong to a passage of the Vivṛti that is missing in the marginal annotations; see the following note). 

51 At this point the marginal annotations in S3, S15, JR and S12, as well as note 170 in ĪPV, vol. I, 176–177, give a series of quotations that do not seem to belong to the Vivṛti itself (?).

Note that note 6 of the Śivadṛṣṭi edition, 4, which is apparently borrowed from a marginal annotation in manuscript D3 (the latter being in all probability the manuscript “a” used by the KSTS editors), gives the same quota tions from the Bhagavadgītā while commenting on this verse, and introduces them with a text almost identical to that found here: evaṃ cārthasya prakāśatve prakāśo ’py arthaḥ, artho ’pi prakāśaḥ. “And [since it is] so, since the object is the manifesting consciousness, the manifesting consciousness is the object, and conversely the object is the manifest ing consciousness.” My assumption that the Śivadṛṣṭi manuscript called “a” by the KSTS editors is none other than D3 is based on the fact that the description of “a” (Śivadṛṣṭi, I–II) closely corresponds to D3 (which unfortunately I was only able to examine very quickly at the National Archives of India) as regards the number of folios, the average number of lines per folio, and the average number of akṣaras per line, not to mention that both manuscripts bear many marginal annotations (at least some of which are iden tical). Both, moreover, are bound together with manuscripts of the ĪPV, Parātrīśika and Paramādvayadvādaśikā. It should also be noted that another Śivadṛṣṭi manuscript origi nally owned by the Śrinagar Research Library is now preserved in the National Archives of India (D4); I could not consult it as it had been sent for repair at the time of my visit to the Archives, but from the catalogue description I suspect that it might be the Devanāgarī transcript called “b” by the KSTS editors. A thorough analysis of D3 and D4 would there fore certainly be a welcome addition to the examination of some Śivadṛṣṭi manuscripts provided in Nemec 2011, 79–90. 

52 This passage occurs in S3, folio 40B (third line from the bottom of the page), S15, folio 47A (left margin) and JR, folio 82B (bottom margin, from line 2 onwards, then on the right mar gin). It is not found in D2, S2, S5, S9, S10, SOAS or in the footnotes of the KSTS edition of the ĪPV, but it also occurs in the ĪPVV manuscript S12 (folio 121A, bottom margin).

54 S3, S15, JR and S12 all bear this reading, and although the pratīka in ĪPVV, vol. II, 132 is given as vikalpapratibhāsiteti, at least one ĪPVV manuscript has vikalpapratibhāsineti(see below, note 95).

66 This fragment appears in marginal annotations in S3 (top of folio 43A, line 1, after a quo tation from the ĪPVV, then on the right margin—see figure 5.1), S15 (folio 50A, top and left margins), JR (folio 87B, right margin) and S12 (folio 130A, left and bottom margins); I could not find it in D2, S2, S5, S7, S9 and SOAS.

75 Here a part of the text is missing, as is obvious from Abhinavagupta’s commentary (ĪPVV, vol. II, 162), which mentions the words eṣa punar and vyāptivimarśāt, and again (ĪPVV, vol. II, 163) dharmapratyakṣa. The next fragment is commented in ĪPVV, vol. II, 163.

79 This annotation is not found in S3, S15, JR or S12, but it appears in both SOAS (folio 106B, upper right corner) and D2 (folio115B, upper and right margins); it is also found in note 248 inĪPV, vol.I,190.In all three cases this passage is preceded by a quotation fromĪPVV, vol.II, 165 (from bāhyatvaviśiṣṭo ’rthaḥ up to kramikābhāsavaicitryāt). This ĪPVV quotation is also found in S9, S10 and followed in all cases by ity āśaṅkyāha grāmagṛhāder iti. But after that point, while S9 and S10 add ayam āśayaḥ and then quote again the ĪPVV from nedaṃ bāhyatvaṃ ghaṭasya onwards, SOAS, D2 and the ĪPV note give tathā cātra pūrvavyavasthā sphuṭam eva dṛśyate yathā, and then the text quoted above. There is very little direct evi dence that this annotation is indeed a quotation from theVivṛti: the onlyĪPVV passage that could comment on it apparently explains a sentence beginning with nanu cakṣurādi°(see ĪPVV, vol. II, 165), whereas no nanu is to be found in the annotations and I had to conjec ture it. Nonetheless, it seems to me quite probable that the words preceding cakṣurādi° are not part of the quoted text, as I cannot understand the sentence with the presence of the word yathā twice (the KSTS edition has vā after the second yathā, although this vā is found neither in D2 nor in SOAS; but even with this additional vā I fail to see the structure of the sentence). Besides, as shown in Ratié 2011b, 491–499, this passage expresses a crucial objection against Utpaladeva’s reasoning, and it is at least certain from Abhinavagupta’s explanations in the ĪPVV (see below, note 119) that the Vivṛtistated this very objection in a passage beginning with nanu cakṣurādi°. So it seems likely that this passage is a genuine fragment from the Vivṛti, although this is by no means certain.

successful[ly] ascertain85 the existence (vyavasthā) of [this or that] entity— an ascertainment in which [they necessarily] engage [in their ordinary activi ties]; so this pondering over an unperceived reality that is [supposedly] some thing more (adhikatara) [than phenomena and the consciousness manifesting them]86 is a [purely] arbitrary endeavour!87 For it is not [universally acknowl edged that] no [perception] at all can be accounted for (upapadyate) without speculating about the [imperceptible] sense organs;88 thus some89 propound 

85 See ĪPVV, vol. II, 131: nirapāyety apāyaḥ pramāṇābhāvo dūṣaṇasaṃbhavaś ca, tadrahitā. “[This ascertainment] is successful[ly performed] (nirapāya), i.e.,] it is devoid of the fail ure (apāya) [consisting in] the lack of a means of [valid] knowledge, and [it is devoid of] the possibility [that the means of valid knowledge] may be refuted.” 

86 The word adhikatara is the comparative form of adhika, which by itself means “some thing more.” According to Abhinavagupta, Utpaladeva uses it because if the manifesta tions of objects in consciousness are something morethan the consciousness manifesting them, the so-called external object must be considered as something more than these very manifestations: the external object must be considered as existing over and above phe nomena and the consciousness taking their form—which is absurd. See ĪPVV, vol. II, 131: adhikatarety ābhāsā eva darpaṇāt pratibimbānīva saṃvedanād adhikāni, yac ca tato ’py adhikataraṃ na kvacid bhāvi tat tata eva* dṛṣṭaṃ tac ca vastu katham. [*tat tata eva conj.; tata eva J10, J11, T, ĪPVV]. “ ‘adhikatara’ [means the following]: the [various] phenomena are [something more (adhika)] than consciousness, just as reflections are something more than a mirror [reflecting them]; and that which is something more than something more, [i.e., that which is something more] than these very [phenomena,] can never be perceived in any [circumstance] for the very [reason that it is distinct from phenomena]; and how could that be a [real] entity (vastu)?” 

87 Cf. ĪPVV, vol. II, 131: svacchandaceṣṭitam iti na pramāṇabalopanatam ity arthaḥ. “[It is] ‘a [purely] arbitrary endeavour,’ i.e. it is not brought about by the force of [necessity inherent in] a means of [valid] knowledge.”

For the former acknowledge that ordinary human practice is accounted for if this much [is admitted]: the five elements and con sciousness, because such other [things as] the sense organs are included in these; whereas the latter admit that the ordinary human practice [consisting in the relationship between] an apprehending [subject] and an apprehended [object] is accounted for if a particular transformation called ‘consciousness’ arises in the four elements from [some of their] var

the theory of the six elements (ṣaḍdhātu) while not taking the sense organs into account in any way, [and] others90 defend the theory of the two [sorts 

ious combinations, and if this transformation does not arise [from other combinations of the four elements].” On the author of the Ṣaḍdhātusamīkṣā and the followers of Bṛhaspati see below, notes 89 and 90, and Ratié 2018. 

89 According to Abhinavagupta’s commentary (see above, note 88), their “theory of the six elements” (ṣaḍdhātuvāda) includes a set of five elements (bhūtapañcaka)—i.e. most probably earth, water, fire, wind and ākāśa—to which consciousness (cetanā) is added. At first sight one might assume that Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta had a Buddhist author in mind (on the Buddhist theory of the ṣaḍdhātu see e.g. Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 28 [on Abhidharmakośa 1.27]: ya ime tatra ṣaḍ dhātava uktāḥ pṛthivīdhātur abdhātus tejo dhātur vāyudhātur ākāśadhātur vijñānadhātuḥ …; cf. La Vallée Poussin 1923, 49, note 2 for sources). But according to Abhinavagupta’s commentary (ibid.), here Utpaladeva is rather hinting at the Ṣaḍdhātusamīkṣā—a lost work ascribed to Bhartṛhari. This treatise, alluded to by Somānanda in Śivadṛṣṭi 2.73 as the Samīkṣā and mentioned by Utpaladeva himself in Śivadṛṣṭivṛtti, 83–86, is also known as the Śabdadhātusamīkṣā (see e.g. Iyer 1969, 9– 10), but as already pointed out in Torella 2002, xxvi–xxvii, note 39 (cf. Torella 2014, 573), the latter title, which appears in the KSTS edition of the Śivadṛṣṭivṛtti, is a corruption (note that as seen above, note 88, the ĪPVV gives the title as Ṣaḍdhātusamīkṣā). On the few known fragments of it and what might have been the overall goal of the work, see Ratié 2018. As pointed out there, Abhinavagupta makes some interesting remarks regard ing this ṣaḍdhātuvāda while commenting on another part of the Pratyabhijñā treatise (ĪPVV, vol. I, 93): sāṅkhyasya yady api pañcaviṃśatis tattvāni sphuranti, tathāpi pañcaiva bhūtāni cetanā cety etāvanmātre tāvat sākṣātkārarūpo ’nubhavo nādhike. tata eva tatra bhavato dhātuṣaṭkanirūpaṇa eva viśvaṃ nirūpitaṃ bhavatītyāśayena tatsamīkṣodyamaḥ. saṃbhāvanānumānāgamajaniteṣv api jñāneṣu tad eva bhāsate, kevalaṃ yojanāmātram adhikam. yathā pṛthivy eva yā surabhyasurabhyādivicitragandhā tatraiva viśeṣatyāgena saukṣmyeṇa ca gandhatanmātrarūpateti. “Even though for a [follower of] Sāṅkhya, the twenty-five principles (tattva) are manifest [as the universe], to begin with, experience (anubhava), that is, immediate perception, consists in nothing but this: the sole five ele ments (bhūta) and consciousness (cetanā)—and nothing more. This is why for the master [Bhartṛhari] (tatrabhavant), the universe is [entirely] explained as soon as the six ele ments are explained—it is with this intention that he has undertaken their Examination (Samīkṣā). It is also this [set of six elements] that is manifest in cognitions that arise from hypothetical inferences or scripture [and not only in perceptions; and] anything else is nothing but a mere combination [of these elements]. For example, [the prop erty of] consisting in the subtle sensory object (tanmātra) of smell lies in the [element (dhātu) of earth]—that same earth that may possess various smells, some pleasant, oth ers unpleasant, etc.—insofar as [earth] is devoid of particularities and subtle.” So it seems that Utpaladeva alluded to this theory at this point of the Vivṛti because according to the author of the Ṣaḍdhātusamīkṣā, perception can be explained in its entirety as the result of a mere combination of the six elements, without inferring the existence of imperceptible indriyas that would be fundamentally distinct from these elements; or, as Abhinavagupta puts it (see above, note 88), according to this theory the indriyas are already included within the six elements. 

90 If we follow Abhinavagupta’s interpretation of this passage (see above, note 88), these 
 

fragments of utpaladeva’s vivṛti (ii) 125 

of combinations of four elements—namely, the sort that produces conscious ness and the one that does not—without taking imperceptible sense organs into account either]. And exactly in the same way, ordinary human practice [can] be entirely accounted for (parisamāpti) without any investigation about an absolutely imperceptible object [considered as] something more than phe nomena. Therefore speculating about this [absolutely imperceptible object] is [nothing but] air. 

Nor [can] the [external object] be established by any [such] speculation, because of the impossibility of this external [object]—this is what [the verse] 

“others” are “followers of Bṛhaspati” (bārhaspatya), i.e. some materialists (cārvāka) who embrace the ideas expressed in the sūtras traditionally ascribed to Bṛhaspati (on the known fragments of this work and the probability that it was written around the sixth century, see Namai1976, Bhattacharya 2002 and Franco 2011, 634–636). According to Abhi navagupta, they understand the relationship between the apprehending subject and the apprehended object as the mere result of various combinations between four material elements. Thus the fragments of the Bṛhaspatisūtras do not deny the very existence of sense organs, but they refuse to see them as distinct entities: whereas the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika theories of vision for instance present the visual organ as an imperceptible ray of light fundamentally different from the perceiving body and perceived object (see e.g. Preisendanz 1989), the materialists see the indriyas as mere aggregates made of the same matter constituting the subject and object. See fragments A2 to A4 in Namai 1976, 39 (cf. Bhattacharya 2002, 603–604 and Franco 2011, 635): pṛthivy āpas tejo vāyur iti tattvāni || tat samudāye śarīrendriyaviṣayasañjñāḥ ||tebhyaś caitanyam ||“Earth,water,fire andwind are the principles. [It is merely] their aggregates that the terms ‘body,’ ‘sense organ’ (indriya) and ‘object’ designate. Consciousness [arises] from these.” Besides, according to the “fol lower of Bṛhaspati” whose views are mocked by Jayanta Bhaṭṭa (the term bārhaspatya appears e.g. in Nyāyamañjarī, vol. I, 496 and Āgamaḍambara, 63), inferences are valid only if they regard entities that have already been perceived, but not if they are meant to establish the existence of entities that are by nature imperceptible, such as God and the Self. See Nyāyamañjarī, vol. I, 326: dvividham anumānam, kiñcid utpannapratīti kiñcid utpādyapratīti. īśvarādyanumānaṃ tūtpādyapratīti. tatra dhūmānumānādeḥ prāmāṇyaṃ kena neṣyate | ato hi sādhyaṃ budhyante tārkikair akṣatā api || yat tv ātmeśvarasarvajña paralokādigocaram | anumānaṃ na tasyeṣṭaṃ prāmāṇyaṃ tattvadarśibhiḥ || “Inference is of two sorts: one [concerns an object] the perception of which has [already] occurred [at some point]; the other [concerns an object] the perception of which has [yet] to occur. But the inference of [entities] such as God [concerns an object] the perception of which has [yet] to occur. Among these [two types of inference,] who would not admit the valid ity of an inference such as that [of fire] from smoke? So [people] apprehend what is to be established [by such an inference] even though they are not pestered by logicians. But the validity of an inference regarding such [entities] as the Self, God, an omniscient or an afterlife is not acknowledged by those who know reality.” 

Whether the materialists of Jayanta’s time had also explicitly targeted the inference of the indriyas or not, Jayanta criticizes their thesis by emphasizing that it leaves them with no choice but to reject the inference of imperceptible indriyas as well. See Nyāyamañjarī, vol. I, 501: śrotrādyanumāne ’pi yathodāhṛte śakyam evam abhidhātum … “And also with

respect to the inference of the hearing organ and so on, according to the way in which it is formulated, one can declare similarly, [as in the case of the inference of God or the Self, that it is invalid] …” Cf. Āgamaḍambara, 68, where the Saiddhāntika arguing with a Cār vāka who denies the validity of the inference of īśvara points out that then the Cārvāka should equally dismiss the inference of the indriyas. The Cārvāka replies: “Let [us admit that] the [sense organs] too are not inferred; why should it be a problem for us?” (tad api mānumāyi, kiṃ naś chinnam); the Saiddhāntika asks in turn: “But [then] how can you see a visual form without any visual organ?” (nanu cakṣuṣā vinā kathaṃ rūpaṃ drakṣyasi). See Dezső 2005, 168–169. On the possibility that the materialist portrayed by Jayanta might be a caricature of a ninth-century Kashmirian materialist, poetician and grammarian named Udbhaṭa, see Solomon 1977–1978, Bronkhorst 2008 and Bronner 2016. Cakradhara, while commenting on the Nyāyamañjarī, explicitly identifies Jayanta’s materialist target as Udb haṭa, to whom he ascribes a commentary on the Bṛhaspatisūtras (see Solomon 1977–1978, 988–990), and it is not impossible that Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta also knew this work. 

91 Utpaladeva has just argued that there is no universal acknowledgement of the necessity of positing the existence of imperceptible entities (such as the indriyas) so as to account for perception. He now adds that even granted that we admit this necessity (hence the “Let us admit this,” syād etat, in the verse), such an argument is in fact invalid because, as he is about to show, the existence of the external object is contradictory to reason. Cf. ĪPVV, vol. II, 131: anupayogino ’pi vastuvicāracakṣuranveṣyatvāt* tattvam, iha tu bāhye ’rtha idam api nāstīty āha nāpīti. [*vastuvicāracakṣuranveṣyatvāt conj.; vastuno vicāracañcuranviṣya tāt ĪPVV, vastuvicāracañcuranveṣyatāt T; vastuvicāracaṃcaranviṣyatāṃ J10, J11.] “[With] ‘Nor …’, [Utpaladeva] says that [something may be considered as] having a reality (tattva), even though it is useless [in ordinary human practice], on the grounds that [the existence of] the visual organ [for instance] is required when speculating on the real entity [that contributes to the production of a visual perception]; but in the [case of the] external object, there is not even [room for] such an [assumption].”

To begin with, the Buddhists, when saying that the validity of a means of knowledge arises from the force of determination (adhyavasāya), admit that even inference must have an object that is external [insofar as it is based on the determina tion of a previously perceived object. This is what Dharmakīrti has said in Pramāṇaviniś caya 2.7b]: ‘In both [inference and perception], the validity [of the means of knowledge] concerns a real thing …’. But in our doctrine, the concept necessarily rests on the real thing, [even at the time of conceptualization: Utpaladeva] has [already] stated this elsewhere, for instance in [verse 1.3.5 beginning with] bhrāntitve cāvasāyasya. For this very reason, in our system the [Buddhist] externalist’s claim that a concept involves no real manifes tation cannot be accepted at all: since the proponent of the theory that cognition has aspects says that a concept is [immediately] manifest in itself [insofar as every cognition is immediately aware of itself,] even though with respect to the object, [this concept] is a [mere] determination, how could it have a nonexistent manifestation? So enough with this.” 

Here is the gist of Abhinavagupta’s reasoning as I understand it. The Buddhists see conceptualization as bearing on a mere generality or a pseudo-object resulting from a process of exclusion (apoha); yet they acknowledge (as Dharmakīrti in the Pramāṇaviniś caya) that a valid inference has as its object a real entity inasmuch as its object is capable of efficacy (see Pramāṇaviniścaya 2, 48: … arthakriyāyogyaviṣayatvād vicārasya, “because a [valid inferential] speculation has an object that is capable of efficacy”). According to Dharmakīrti, this is the case because although the generalities aimed at in concepts are no real entity (since reality is purely singular), they result from the determination (adhyavasāya) as one single entity of many perceived singular entities that have a some what similar efficacy (thus the concept of “fire” results from our determining as one many perceived fires that are all in fact different from each other but share the capacity to burn, etc.). So even inferences are somehow based on at least one aspect of perceived entities (namely arthakriyā), and this is why valid inferences enable us to obtain desired entities and to shun undesirable objects. Nonetheless, the Buddhists consider that only perceptions involve an immediate manifestation of the object, and the Śaivas see this as a contradiction in the Dharmakīrtian system: according to Abhinavagupta, the Bud dhist theory of determination entails that conceptual objects too are directly manifested at the very time of their conceptualization (and not only in some perception anterior to the conceptual elaboration), at least as regards their efficacy (see e.g. ĪPVV, vol. II, 132: 
 

128 ratié 

[something determined as being] external, and that an activity [can occur] with respect to [something determined as being] fire. Ordinary human practice [can even occur] with an object such as the sense organs, or heaven and liber ation, although [these always remain] beyond the reach of the sense organs, [but] only inasmuch as they are [somehow] manifest in the concept [repre senting them].95 And [since it is] so, being an object is nothing but having a 

arthakriyāpi cābhāsamānatayaivābhilaṣaṇīyeti sāpy ābhāsaviśrānteti. “And even efficacy can be desired only insofar as it is being manifest; therefore it too rests on manifestation.”). Besides, the Buddhist epistemologists cannot deny that concepts involve a real, immediate manifestation since they consider that all cognitions have two aspects (“an aspect [con sisting in] the object,”viṣayākāra, and “an aspect [consisting in] themselves,”svākāra), and that even concepts, insofar as they possess self-awareness (svasaṃvedana, svasaṃvitti), involve an immediate manifestation of themselves (on this idea and its appropriation by the Śaivas see Ratié 2011, 44–45, note 20). 

Abhinavagupta thus emphasizes in this passage the major point of contention between the Śaiva nondualists and their Buddhist counterparts as regards concepts: according to Utpaladeva, all concepts involve the immediate manifestation of a real thing at the very moment when they arise, because there can be no conscious representation of something that consciousness cannot present to itself in an immediate way; without such a manifestation, concepts could not occur or would be similar to a state of unconscious ness. And this means that even objects conceptualized as being external are ultimately internal aspects of consciousness manifesting itself as if it were external to itself. See e.g. ĪPVV, vol. II,129–130: anumito ’pi bāhyo ’rthaḥ prakāśamāna eva vaktavyaḥ, prakāśād bhede hy aprakāśanaprasaṅgād anumitatvam api vastuno mūrchāprāyaṃ bhavet. “Even [if] an external object [is] inferred[, it] can be talked about only insofar as it is being manifest, for if [it] were distinct from the manifesting consciousness (prakāśa), since as a result it would not be manifest, [the awareness of] the very fact that the entity is inferred would amount to a state of stupor!”

[If you reply:] “But this [property of being an object] can only belong to [things] that are distinct from manifestation,” what apprehension [of these objects] could there be [if they are distinct from manifestation]?96 [And] what is this [so-called] annihilation of ordinary human practice [that must inex orably occur according to you] if [objects] are one with phenomena? This is what [the Vṛtti] says in “let [us admit that] they consist in phenomena.”97 Only [the following] could [still] be objected:98 if these [objects] did not exist after as well as before [their] being manifest, [then] the very fact that they 

96 Here the opponent is arguing that by definition, an object is what we apprehend as being distinct from—i.e. external to—us considered as conscious subjects, so that the ideal ist’s thesis is absurd because it contradicts our most ordinary experiences in the sphere of human practice. He is therefore implicitly invoking the evidence of common knowl edge (prasiddhi) to show that there must be some external object. Utpaladeva answers that this evidence, far from being contradictory to his idealism, is in fact an argument in favour of it. Cf. ĪPVV, vol. II, 132: tataś ca prasiddhyaiva bāhyaḥ sidhyatīti pratyuta viparī tam etat … “And therefore, [to the objection:] ‘the external [object] is established through mere common knowledge,’ [one should answer] that it is rather the contrary.” According to this fragment, the reason why this is so is that apprehending an object means mak ing the object manifest to consciousness, and such a manifestation can only occur if the object is nothing but consciousness taking the form of an object. This idea is justified at length at the beginning of chapter 1.5 (see Ratié 2011, 309–366). 

97 Cf. the beginning of Vṛtti on ĪPK 1.5.6, 20: ābhāsamānair evārthair vyavahāraḥ, te cā bhāsātmakāḥ santu, kā kṣatiḥ. “Ordinary human practice occurs thanks to objects pre cisely insofar as [they are] being manifested, and let [us admit that] they consist in phe nomena [and nothing else]—what harm [might ensue for human practice if it is the case]?” See Torella 2002, 114.

[According to him] this ‘could [still] be objected,’ [i.e.] it deserves the [following] objection. Which one? This is what [Utpaladeva says] in ‘[if these objects did not exist] after as well as before [their] being manifest …’” My tentative emendation above (vītarāgatām instead of avitārakatām) is based on passages such as Nyāyamañjarī, vol.

See e.g. Kṣemarāja’s Sva cchandatantroddyota, vol. VI, 98 (alluding to Nyāyasūtra 1.2.1, according to which “debate comprehends both the thesis and the antithesis,” … pakṣapratipakṣaparigraho vādaḥ): … pakṣapratipakṣaparigraho vītarāgakathārūpo vādaḥ. “Debate, which comprehends both the thesis and the antithesis, [and] which is a discourse of [people] who are free of bias …” On vāda as a vītarāgakathā see also e.g. Nyāyamañjarī, vol. I, 18 or Nyāyabhūṣaṇa, 328; cf. Tantrālokaviveka on Tantrāloka 13.126, vol. VIII, 90. So as far as I understand the ĪPVV pas sage, Abhinavagupta simply means here that by raising himself (svayam) this objection to his own thesis, Utpaladeva is showing to his opponent that he is an unbiased interlocutor. 

99 Cf. ĪPVV, vol. II, 133, which explains the objection in the following way: … ābhāsanam avaśyaṃ bhavane cābhavane ca nimittam apekṣate. tac cen nāsti, tan nirhetukatā. tataś ca kāryakāraṇābhāvād ghaṭārthī na mṛdam āharet, na kumbhakārakulam abhigacchet, na dhūmārthī hutabhujam ādadīta. kāryakāraṇatāmūlaś ca jñāpyajñāpakabhāvaḥ … “A man ifestation necessarily requires a cause as regards both [its] arising and [its] not arising. And if there is no such [cause], then [this manifestation] is causeless. And since as a con sequence there is no relation of cause and effect, [someone] who wants a pot should not get clay [and] should not go see a family of potters; [and someone] who wants smoke should not get himself a fire. Moreover, the relation between the knowing subject and the object of knowledge has as its root the relation of cause and effect …” As for the gist of Utpaladeva’s reply to this objection according to Abhinavagupta, see above, note 30. 

100 This fragment, which targets the Buddhist Vaibhāṣika theory according to which external objects are nothing but aggregated atoms, must have followed a criticism of the Vaiśeṣika thesis that the external object is a whole (avayavin) distinct from its parts (avayava), hence the atha here. See ĪPVV, vol. II, 140:evaṃ kāṇādasaṃmataṃ bāhyaṃ dūṣayitvā vaibhāṣika paribhāṣitam api dūṣayaty atheti. “Having thus refuted the external [object as it is] under stood by the followers of Kaṇāda, [Utpaladeva now] refutes as well [the external object as it is] explained by the Vaibhāṣikas [in the sentence beginning with] ‘If, on the other hand.’” This line of argument is of course borrowed from the famous criticism in Viṃśikā 11–15 of the various theories claiming to account for the external object. Vasubandhu shows there that we cannot make sense of this external object whether we try to understand it as a whole distinct from its parts, as atoms taken individually, or as aggregated atoms. On the recent debate as to whether Vasubandhu’s reasoning was meant to show that the external object cannot exist, or whether his goal was merely to point out that such an object cannot be known, and for convincing arguments in favour of the first hypothesis, see Kellner and

form, necessarily appears as having [different] parts [respectively located in the] east, west, etc.; and [this spatial extendedness]101 is not possible if [this pot] is thus made of atoms[, since by definition an atom cannot have different parts].102 To explain:103 a second atom that is connected with the atom con sidered as the first [one]104 must be one with this [first atom]; for if [these atoms] devoid of parts are in contact, how much [of them could] remain that

On Vasubandhu’s refutation—summed up in this fragment—of the Vaibhāṣikas’ atomism, see e.g. Kapstein 2001,181–204; for Abhinavagupta’s explanation of it, see Ratié 2010, 450–452, and Ratié 2011, 395–399. 

101 Cf. ĪPVV, vol. II, 140: na caivaṃ paramāṇumayatva iti vaitatyaṃ digbhāgabhedavattvam. “And [spatial] extendedness, which [consists in] being differentiated into parts according to the directions, is ‘[not possible] if [this pot] is thus made of atoms.’” 

102 The main idea is that if perceptible things, which are made of imperceptible atoms, are spatially extended, the atoms too must have such an extendedness, but spatially extended atoms must have parts, which is absurd since the atom is by definition partless. Cf. Viṃ śikā 14ab: digbhāgabhedo yasyāsti tasyaikatvaṃ na yujyate | “That which is differentiated into parts according to the directions cannot be one.” See also Viṃśikāvṛtti, 7: anyo hi para māṇoḥ pūrvadigbhāgo yāvad adhodigbhāga iti digbhāgabhede sati kathaṃ tadātmakasya paramāṇor ekatvaṃ yokṣyate. “For if an atom has one part in the direction of the east, [and others in the directions of the south, west, north, above] and below, given that [the atom] is differentiated into [various] parts according to the directions (digbhāgabheda), how could the atom be one [whereas it] consists of these [different parts]?” 

103 According to Abhinavagupta, here Utpaladeva has the externalist face a dilemma, the first part of which remains implicit in the Vivṛti. See ĪPVV, vol. II, 140: tac ca bahūnāṃ para māṇūnāṃ bhinnadeśatve mūrtatvenānyonyarūpadeśākramaṇayogyatvābhāvāt* pratilab dhe kimiti na ghaṭata ity āśaṅkyāha tathā hīti. ayaṃ bhāvaḥ—yadi sāntarāḥ paramāṇavo ghaṭaḥ, tad adṛśyatā … [*mūrtatvena° corr.; ’mūrtatvena° ĪPVV.] “[The opponent:] ‘And why is [this spatial extendedness of the pot] not possible if [we admit that] the numerous atoms get to have different places because, since they are of a material, [i.e. solid] nature (mūrta), [they] cannot extend to the place of the others’ forms?’ Anticipating this [objec tion, Utpaladeva] says ‘To explain …’ Here is the implicit meaning [of this passage]: if the pot is [nothing but] atoms with intervals [separating them from each other], then [the pot] must be imperceptible …” In other words, the opponent is tempted to respond to the objection just stated in the fragment by explaining that atoms can indeed occupy different locations because although partless, they cannot penetrate each other so as to coexist in the same spot. But this reply is unsound, first and foremost because then the macroscopic pot should remain imperceptible, as it would merely consist of imperceptible atoms and intervals between them. After enumerating a few more of the “countless defects” (śataśo doṣāḥ) inherent in the thesis that atoms are separated by intervals, Abhinavagupta adds (ibid.): nairantaryetu parasparasaṃśleṣaḥ.“But if [the atoms] are contiguous, they [must] be in contact with one another.” It is the absurdity of the latter hypothesis that the frag ment is now going to point out. 

104 Alternatively, one could understand: “a second atom that is connected with the atom con sidered as [located] in the east.”

might not be in contact? And [if they are thus entirely] in contact, their natures must be immersed in each other, therefore [they] can only be manifest as one [single] atom; and if [they are] in contact with yet another atom, the same [consequence follows]—therefore even if an infinite number of atoms were connected, they should be manifest as having the size of one [single] atom;105 or [rather], even this [manifestation] would not exist, because atom[s], [taken] one by one, are beyond the realm of the sense organs.106 

7 Translation of the Fragments on ĪPK 1.5.8–9 

[4] For inference is a concept, and this [concept] arises thanks to the resid ual trace (saṃskāra) [left by] a previous experience; so to begin with, [it] depends on thefact that the object was directly perceived [at some point] in the past, and inference is a conceptual cognition that arises as an unfailing (avya bhicāra)107 [means of knowledge] with respect to this [previously perceived] object.108 And insofar as this [inference]109 produces the realization (vimṛśati) 

105 If atoms are in contact, they must all share the same place since they are partless, and as a result their aggregate, however complex, cannot be larger than a single atom. See Viṃśikā 12cd: ṣaṇṇāṃ samānadeśatvāt piṇḍaḥ syād aṇumātrakaḥ | “If the six [atoms supposedly surrounding the first one] share the same location [as the first one], [they] must [con stitute] a lump [of matter] that has the size of a [single] atom.” Cf. Viṃśikāvṛtti, 7: atha ya evaikasya paramāṇor deśaḥ sa eva ṣaṇṇām. tena sarveṣāṃ samānadeśatvāt sarvaḥ piṇ ḍaḥ paramāṇumātraḥ syāt parasparāvyatirekāt. “If, on the other hand, the place of one atom is also that of the six [atoms supposedly surrounding it], then since they all have the same place, [they] must all [constitute] a lump [of matter] that has the size of a [sin gle] atom, since they are not distinct from each other.” See also ĪPVV, vol. II, 141: iti dvāv api militau nādhikaṃ rūpaṃ samutthāpayeyātām. evam anyamelane ’pi vācyam. tad āha ananteti. “Therefore two connected [atoms] cannot bring about a form larger [than one single atom], and the same must be said if another, [third atom] gets in contact [with them]—this is what [Utpaladeva explains] with ‘[even if] an infinite [number] …’” 

106 If aggregated atoms are not larger than one atom, no material object should be percepti ble, since a single atom is imperceptible. Cf. Viṃśikāvṛtti, 7: iti na kaścit piṇḍo dṛśyaḥ syāt. naiva hi paramāṇavaḥ saṃyujyante niravayavatvāt. “So no lump [of matter] at all should be perceptible; for the atoms cannot be in contact [with each other] at all, since they have no parts.” 

107 Literally, “non-deviating.” 

108 According to Abhinavagupta, here Utpaladeva specifies that inference is a“non-deviating” means of knowledge (that is, according to the Buddhist epistemologists, a means of knowl edge that is valid inasmuch as it unfailingly enables us to reach a given object) so as to point out that although conceptual, it is not a mere mental construct absolutely unre lated to perception, since it regards a previously perceived object.

of this object—[which only] exists inside [consciousness at the time when we infer]—thanks to the residual trace of the [past] experience, [and inso far as it produces this realization] as is appropriate [for an object, i.e.] in the form “this” (idantā), it only manifests [this object] as being separated [from the subject, the latter being expressed as “I”]. And this mere [realization that the object is something separated from the subject] is not enough to transform this object into something on which [human] activity may be exerted; there fore [this object] is [also] made manifest (prakāśita) as having a specific place and time, because only a particular having a specific place and time can be something on which [human] activity may be exerted, since [only such a par ticular] can be obtained (prāpya) and since [only such a particular] may have the efficacy (arthakriyā) that [we] expect [from it]. So [a valid inference is] an act of realization (vimarśana) that is exactly so, [i.e. it is an unfailing means of knowledge with respect to a previously perceived object that it manifests as having a specific place and time].110 This is what [the Vṛtti] says [with the words]“manifested in the past” (pūrvāvabhāta),“an object invariably concomi tant [with this entity]” (nāntarīyakārtha) [and] “[due to the association of this entity with] this or that [specific] place and time, etc.”111

But is inference nothing but a mere concept? With [the word] avyabhicāra°, [Utpaladeva] answers ‘no’ [to this question].”

Therefore what [we] call an inference is [not just any] conceptualiza tion (vikalpana), [but only one] that consists in a means of [valid] knowledge since it is reliable (avisaṃvādaka), [and one] that concerns an object possessed of a specific time and place, [therefore being] fit to be [something on which] an activity [is exerted].”

[5] Even a sense organ has already been experienced before [being inferred]; for this [sense organ] is not inferred in its own specific form, but rather, as a [mere] generality (sāmānya).113 This is what [I] say in the Vṛtti [with the words]“a cause that is a mere indeterminate thing” (kiñcinmātra).114 The object [inferred in this inference of the sense organs] is a generality (sāmānya) [that simply consists in] being a cause; [and this generality] was manifested before [the inference] in the cognition that the seed is a cause of the sprout, [or] in the cognition that clay for instance is a cause of the pot and [other such objects].115 For in that [cognition that the seed is the cause of the sprout],116 it is not [something] specific[, i.e.] only a seed [and nothing else], that is mani- 

[of this entity] with this or that [specific] time and place, etc.” As noted in Torella 2002, 117, note 19, Utpaladeva’s definition specifies that inference “aims at proving the existence of an object that is able to propose itself as the possible object of purposeful activity (i.e. specified by a definite time and space […]).” And this amounts to saying that the external object cannot be an inferential object, not only because there can be no previous experi ence of such an object, but also because according to Utpaladeva’s definitions of time and space (on which see e.g. Ratié 2011, 197–201), spatial and temporal relationships can only belong to manifested entities. See e.g. ĪPV, vol. II, 16: nanv evam ābhāsaviṣayābhyām eva deśakālakramābhyāṃ bhavitavyam. “But [if it is] so, the spatial and temporal sequences can only regard phenomena.” 

112 See above, note 75. 

113 On the Śaivas’ understanding of this type of inference called sāmānyatodṛṣṭa (which infers the mere existence of some imperceptible and therefore indeterminate entity so as to account for a phenomenon that would remain inexplicable otherwise) see e.g. Torella 2002, 117, note 20, and Ratié 2011b, 486–488. 

114 Cf. Vṛtti, 22: indriyam apy anumīyate kiñcinmātraṃ nimittaṃ tac ca bījādyābhāsād ābhā sitam eva. “Even a sense organ is inferred [as] a cause that is a mere indeterminate thing; and this [sense organ] has already been manifested due to the manifestation of a seed, etc.” See Torella 2002, 117. 

115 Utpaladeva considers every perceived object as a particular synthesis of general features (including that of causality); see Torella 1992, 332–333, and Torella 2002, 89–90, note 3. On Abhinavagupta’s explanations of this point see Ratié 2011b, 488–491. It is this theory that enables Utpaladeva to claim here that although the sense organs are imperceptible in the sense that they can never be apprehended as singular entities existing in a deter minate place and time, they can still be considered as having somehow been perceived before being inferred (so that their inference is valid); this is so because the inference of the sense organs does not concern a particular entity but a mere generality (that is, an indeterminate cause that must be postulated on top of other conditions such as light so as to account for the phenomenon of perception), and this general notion of causality is part of countless perceptions of particular fires seen as causing smoke, etc., since the per ception of a particular is nothing but the apprehension of a synthetic unity of generalities, including causality.

fested as a cause; [otherwise,] as a consequence [we] would not know that clay too [is a cause]. Nor is clay only [cognized as a cause] in a [cognition occurring] after [that of the seed being a cause], because [if it were so] there would follow that [we] would not know that the seed and so on [are also causes]. And [one should rather consider that] within this [notion of causality that is present in the perception of the clay] as well as [in that of the seed], a [process of] partic ularization leads to an exclusion [that takes the form]: “it is the clay that is the cause of the pot, not the seed”; [and this exclusion eliminates from the general notion of cause] that which [the particular cause] is not but which is intrinsi cally linked (prasakta) [with the notion of cause in general].117 

[…] 

[6]?118 [—Objection from the Sautrāntika:] But just as [you] have said that [in the case of the inference of the sense organs,] the generality “causality” has already been experienced through the experience of [particular causes] 

117 Utpaladeva is arguing here that within any act of perception, the apprehension of uni versals or generalities (such as causality) comes first, and it is only once these general features are apprehended that we determine our perception as being that of a singu lar synthesis. This determination of the perceptual object as a singular entity takes the form of the mental process of exclusion (vyavaccheda, apoha) which, according to Dhar makīrti, produces generalities (Utpaladeva’s system thus integrates the Dharmakīrtian notion of apoha, but not without turning it upside down). In other words, upon see ing a pot being made out of clay, we first apprehend a number of generalities inherent in the clay, and then we exclude from e.g. the generality “causality” whatever falls into the general category of cause (or, as Utpaladeva says, is intrinsically linked with it) but has a different efficacy—seeds for instance. According to Abhinavagupta, it is because we thus apprehend the generality “causality” before the particularities of the perceived cause that we are capable of using the word “cause” to describe various entities. See ĪPVV, vol. II, 156: anyathaikatra bīje kāraṇaśabdaḥ saṅketito na mṛtpiṇḍādau saṅketito bhavet. “Otherwise, the word ‘cause’ would be conventionally associated with one single [entity, such as] the seed, [but] it could not be conventionally associated with a lump of clay, etc.” It is also this theory that enables Utpaladeva to claim here that in a sense, all causes (including imperceptible ones such as the sense organs) are perceived when we perceive clay, although contrary to the singular clay perceived at that particular time and place, all the other causes are only apprehended in the form of the general feature “causality.” Cf. Abhinavagupta’s explanation in ĪPVV, vol. II, 163: nanu kumbhaṃ prati mṛdo nimit tatājñāne bījam api nimittabhāvena svīkṛtam iti kutaḥ. atrocyate prasakteti. prasaṅgaś ca kāraṇatāsāmānyapratibhāsasamutthāpita iti bhāvaḥ.“To the [question:] ‘But how is it that in the cognition that the clay is a cause with respect to the pot, [we] apprehend the seed too as a cause?,’ [Utpaladeva] replies [with the expression] ‘that which is intrinsically linked (prasakta) [with the notion of cause in general].’ And this intrinsic link arises from the manifestation of the generality [consisting in] causality—this is what [Utpaladeva] means.” 

118 On my reasons for thinking that this passage might be a fragment from the Vivṛti, see above, note 79.

such as a seed, without considering the particulars that are the visual organ and so on, in the same way, [you must admit that] externality too has already been experienced as a generality from the experience of [various objects that are] external to the body, the house or the village, etc. Alternatively, if [you] claim that [the external object cannot be inferred because] there is no expe rience of externality through a particular [entity characterized as] not being consciousness, [then] since the visual organ and so on have not been previ ously experienced [as] a particular cause either, there can be no inference [of the sense organs either]; so why don’t [you simply] admit that inference applies [in both cases]?119 

119 I now think that my understanding of the last part of this sentence was mistaken in Ratié 2011, 466, note 221, and Ratié 2011b, 494, note 48. As for the general meaning of the passage, see ĪPVV, vol. II, 165: grāmād darpaṇād gṛhād dehāt saṃvedanād bāhyam iti bāhyatāsāmānyam* ekam,tac ca gṛhād bāhyam iti pratītau siddham.tataś ca samarpakaṃ darpaṇād iva bāhyaṃ* saṃvedanād api setsyati kramikābhāsavaicitryāddhetor ityāśayena pūrvapakṣayati nanu cakṣurādīti.

Ratié 2011b, found in T; darpaṇādibāhyaṃ J10, J11, ĪPVV, marginal annotation in SOAS, D2 and note 248 ĪPV (vol. I, 190).] “With [the sentence beginning with] nanu cakṣurādi-, [Utpaladeva] states the prima facie thesis [that he is about to refute] with the intention [of conveying the following objection]: It is one [and the same] generality of externality [that is present in these various cognitions: ‘this is] external to the village, to the mirror, to the house, to the body, to consciousness.’ And this [generality of externality] is established in the [mere] experience: ‘[this is] exter nal to the house.’ And as a consequence, [something] may be established to be external to consciousness as well and to project [its specific form onto consciousness], just as [something is external] to a mirror [and projects its specific form onto the mirror, and it may be established to be so] on the basis of the [logical] reason that is the variety of successive phenomena [experienced by any conscious being].” As to how, according to Abhinavagupta, Utpaladeva was answering this objection in the now missing Vivṛti passage following this fragment, see ĪPVV, vol. II, 165: naivaṃ* bāhyatvaṃ ghaṭasya grā māc ca saṃvedanāc caikam, saṃvedanād bāhyaṃ hy asaṃvedanarūpam, na tu gṛhād bāhyam agṛharūpam. evaṃ sati hi gṛhaikadeśaḥ kuḍyādir gṛhāntarvarty api ca ghaṭādir gṛhabāhyaḥ syāt. na caivam, gṛhasannikr̥ṣṭaṃ ca yadvad* bāhyaṃ gṛhān na tadvad eva saṃvedanāttasyāmūrtasya sannikarṣādideśavyavahāryatvābhāvāt.tataḥ śabdasāmyamā treṇedaṃ* sādhyam ekaṃ pratibhātīty abhiprāyeṇottarayaty atrocyata iti.

The externality of the pot is not thus one [and the same whether it is considered] with respect to the village or with respect to consciousness; for that which is external to consciousness consists in that which is not consciousness, whereas that which is external to the house does not consist in that which is not a house!

Although my doctoral research was undertaken and completed at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (Paris) under Lyne Bansat-Boudon’s supervision, I studied in Oxford under Alexis Sanderson’s guidance in 2005 and 2006 while working on my PhD dissertation, and I am immensely indebted to him. He was kind enough not only to let me attend his classes there but also to orga nize many extra reading sessions so we could cover more of Abhinavagupta’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī, and we ended up reading about two thirds of this lengthy and difficult text in less than two years. It was an extraordinary experi ence for me, not only owing to Alexis’s remarkable erudition and exceptional philological acumen, but also because his generosity, humour and curiosity have always created among his students a unique atmosphere of intellectual freedom and enthusiastic research. I am proud to consider myself a pupil of his, and it is a great honour and joy for me to be given this opportunity, by contributing to the present volume, to express my profound admiration and affection for this wonderful scholar and teacher. 

Most of the research presented in this paper was carried out thanks to the generous financial help of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, as part of project FR 2531/3–1. The National Mission for Manuscripts, the SOAS Library and Mr. Chetan Pandey were kind enough to provide photographs of the manu scripts used for the edition of the fragments given below. Many thanks are also due to Vincent Eltschinger and Eli Franco, who read a draft of this paper and provided insightful remarks.

And whereas that which is external to the house is next to the house, it is absolutely not the case as regards that which is [external] to con sciousness, because of the impossibility for [consciousness]—which is devoid of material form (amūrta)—of having any spatial relation whatsoever such as proximity.

### 6 Alchemical Metaphors for Spiritual Transformation in Abhinavagupta’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī and Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛtivimarśinī 

Christopher D. Wallis 

1 Introduction 

It is a great privilege to be able to present a paper in honour of Alexis G.J.S. San derson. I was fortunate enough to be his pupil for two years at Oxford, and to study with him subsequently in Leipzig and Kyoto. In my view, if one were to accord Professor Sanderson the praise that he in fact merits, it would sound (to those who do not know him) like embarrassingly unrestrained hyperbole. Suffice it to say here that his example formed my ideal of intellectual integrity, an ideal which entails relentless pursuit of the truth as part of a community of scholars engaged in the kind of longitudinal study that prioritizes the field as a whole over personal glory. Professor Sanderson taught me the value of admit ting when I don’t know, of sacrificing my own agenda in deference to the truth, and of striving to be as transparent a mediator as possible in the act of trans mitting the words and ideas of the ancient Sanskrit thinkers to students of the present day. It is with enormous gratitude to his unstinting scholarly labours (I estimate he has logged well over a hundred thousand hours of research so far) that I offer this paper in his honour. 

The oeuvre of the Kashmirian Tantric master Abhinavagupta (fl. c. 975–1015) is one of the many areas of research Professor Sanderson has mastered, and it is this author which the present paper treats. Specifically, we here focus on a trope found in Abhinavagupta’s two commentaries on the Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā (ĪPK) of Utpaladeva, viz., that of an alchemical metaphor for spiritual transfor mation. These passages provide no small number of difficulties, because the text as we have it is not secure, and because some knowledge of Indian alchemy (rasāyana, dhātu-śāstra) is needed in order to translate it correctly. While I do not claim to have solved these problems, this paper may certainly con tribute to our understanding of how Abhinavagupta thought about the process of spiritual transformation conferred by the uniquely potent insight ( jñāna) and yoga offered by initiatory Śaivism. Specifically, we learn much about his usage of the key terms samāveśa, turya, and turyātīta, and it is hoped that

this paper advances our understanding of these topics, which are significant within Śaiva theology.* 

2 The Pratyabhijñā Doctrine of the Fivefold Self 

Some readers are no doubt aware that in Utpaladeva’s ĪPK we find a teaching on the “layers” of the individuated self (see, e.g., III.1.8), parallel to the later Vedāntic teaching of five kośas based on Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.3–5.1 This teach ing, formed as Sanderson says on “slight scriptural precedent,” is adopted by subsequent gurus of Utpala’s lineage; for example, it has a prominent place in Kṣemarāja’s Pratyabhijñāhṛdaya.2 In this model, the self is said to be fourfold: void (śūnya), life-force (prāṇa), the subtle body consisting of the mind and its faculties (puryaṣṭaka, i.e. the antaḥkaraṇa plus tanmātras), and the physical body (śarīra). It is fivefold with the transindividual Power of Awareness (cit, saṃvit) that permeates the whole. In fact, it is not only cit that permeates the other levels: Kṣemarāja tells us that “it is clear that the very essence of each of these levels is the fact of its pervasion by all the loci of perception prior to it,”3 where “loci of perception” (pramātṛ) refers to these levels of embodiment as those realities with which contracted souls identify, and “prior to” means “more fundamental than.” 

Abhinavagupta adds to this teaching a homology implied but not spelled out in the ĪPK itself, one that assimilates these five levels to the five“phases of lucid ity,” as Vasudeva (2004) calls them: the states of waking, dreaming, deep sleep, the transcendental “fourth” state, and the state “beyond the fourth” ( jāgrat, svapna, suṣupta, turya, and turyātīta). We will come to understand the last two terms as we proceed. 

Our texts in this study are Abhinavagupta’s two commentaries on the ĪPK, his -vimarśinī (hereafter ĪPV) and his -vivṛti-vimarśinī (ĪPVV). The former is his commentary on the kārikās themselves, the latter is his commentary on Utpaladeva’s lost Vivṛti or longer auto-commentary. For both texts, we will

use the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies (KSTS) edition. First, though, we will consider the two verses of the ĪPK that Abhinavagupta is commenting on, using Torella’s critical edition (2002), and summarize Abhinava’s initial remarks thereon. All translations are my own unless otherwise noted. 

kalodbalitam etac ca cit-tattvaṃ kartṛtā-mayam | 

acid-rūpasya śūnyāder mitaṃ guṇatayā sthitam || 

ĪPK III.2.11 

And this Awareness-principle, consisting of [unlimited] Agency, [be comes] limited—[though] it is strengthened by partial agency (kalā)— abiding as a [mere] attribute in a person whose [habitual] nature is unconscious, [identifying as he does with] the void, [prāṇa, mind,] and [body]. 

mukhyatvaṃ kartṛtāyās tu bodhasya ca cid-ātmanaḥ | 

śūnyādau tad-guṇe jñānaṃ tat-samāveśa-lakṣaṇam || 

III.2.12 

By contrast, the characteristic of “immersion into That” is realization of the primacy of the Self-that-is-awareness as the [only] true Knower and Agent, and [a concomitant] insight regarding [the other layers of individ uality,] the void, [prāṇa, mind] and [body], as mere attributes of it.4 

Explaining the first of these verses in his ĪPV, Abhinava first describes how consciousness—which in its real nature is primordial, a priori, unlimited and free—comes to be in the degraded state we consider as normal. Through the power of his māyā expressed as the three malas, Śiva contracts himself into a limited form (aṇu, the individual soul), then equips himself with the five kañ cukas beginning with kalā (cf. ĪPK III.1.9), resulting in a being that identifies itself with what is actually objective, that is, the body, mind, prāṇa, and void 

4 While these verses have been translated a number of times (cf. Torella 2002, 202–203), they are not easy to translate in such a way that the reader clearly understands what is being said. Here I capitalize words that are equivalent, on this view, to the Deity. An unobtrusive but important word here is tat-, which I have translated as That but could also have been ren dered Him. Assuming that it is to be taken as compounded with what follows, then it must denote what one is immersing in. The use of a gender-neutral pronoun that could just as well denote neuter tattvam as masculine Him (= Śiva) is exemplary of the decreased theism of the Pratyabhijñā phase of the tradition. 
 

(cf. ĪPK III.1.8).5 Identification with the void (śūnya) can be identification with the state of deep dreamless sleep (as Abhinava states it here) but also, and more importantly, the void is the considered the primary locus of the limited “I” (see ĪPK III.2.13), which, being in reality empty (śūnya), vainly seeks to reify itself through identification with the body, mind, and prāṇa. This identification per sists in all three states of ordinary consciousness (waking, dreaming, and deep sleep).6 

Note that the real“I” is not here the core of an individual being as in Sāṅkhya, but the one transindividual Self of all beings. The individual soul (aṇu) only exists as a particular phase of that transindividual Consciousness, specifically, an expression of the contracted state of bondage. Thus, one may argue, the non dual Śaiva’s “I” is closer to the view of the Vijñānavāda Buddhists than it is to the ātman of Vedānta. (Even the dualistic Śaivas, who did posit a separate and eternal soul, distanced their view of the ātman from those of the brāhmanical schools (Watson 2006).) 

3 The Exegesis of the Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī 

Now let us look more closely at our first text as Abhinavagupta charts the trajec tory from bondage towards liberation, commenting on ĪPKIII.2.12 (KSTS vol. 33, p. 230–231): 

yadātūkta-gurūpadeśādi-diśātenaivāhaṃ-bhāvena svātantryātmanā vyā pakatva-nityatvādi-dharma-parāmarśam ātmani vidadhatā tataḥ śūnyā deḥ prameyād unmajjya iva āsyate tadā turyāvasthā7 | 

But when, through realizing [that the divine] qualities such as all-per vasiveness and eternality apply to oneself, by having the experience of the [real] “I” whose nature is [unqualified] freedom—[an experience] 

5 For example, Abhinava writes idantāpanna-dehādi-śūnyānta-prameya-bhāga-nimagnatvāt prameyam, yo gauro, yaḥ sukhī, yas tṛṣito, yaḥ sarva-rūpa-rahitaḥ so ’ham: “The levels from body to the Void are objects of awareness, [but] because of the submerging of a portion of that objectivity, [there arise the erroneous cognitions] ‘I am the one who is pale’ (body), ‘who is happy’ (mind), ‘who is thirsty’ (prāṇa), ‘who was devoid of all appearances’ (void)” (KSTS vol. 33, p. 230). 

6 seyaṃ jāgrat-svapna-suṣupta-rūpā saṃsārāvasthā (KSTS vol. 33, p. 230). The illusion of sep arate individuality persists even in the deep sleep state because of the presence of the saṃ skāras (cf. ĪPK III.2.13).

pointed out by the guru’s instruction and other methods that I have explained—[and] having therefore emerged as it were from [identifica tion with] the objective knowables of the Void etc., and [as a result] abid ing [in one’s real nature], then that is the [transcendent] state [called] the Fourth.

When further [the layers of the objective“self”] from the Void to the [very] tissues of the body are transmuted10 by means of the “alchemical elixir,” i.e. by the [fundamental] “I”-sense which is certainly conjoined with the qualities of magnificent power (vaibhava), eternality, sovereignty, [and

Torella (email communication, July 2014); turya- Ed. 10 Āyurveda scholar Dominik Wujastyk (of the University of Alberta) recommended this translation of vidhyate as “transmuted” (over that of “penetrated”) based on his reading of the rasāyana literature, especially the Rasa-ratna-samuccaya 8.94–95 and the Bodhinī thereon (email communications, 7 and 9 July 2014). Ashok Aklujkar also contributed a citation from the same text (5.11: vedhajaṃ suvarṇam—pārada-vedhena saṃjātaṃ suvar ṇam), which I believe verifies that vedha must mean transmutation (or similar), not piercing or penetration, though he would wish to retain the latter translation (email, 7 July 2014). (See also n. 27 below.) The alchemical metaphor here (elaborated further in the ĪPVV, infra) is of course not original to Abhinavagupta; we find it earlier in the well-known eighth century Buddhist text, the Bodhicaryāvatāra, 1.10cd: rasajātam atīva vedhanīyaṃ sudṛḍhaṃ gṛhṇata bodhicitta-saṃjñaṃ, which I translate as “Firmly take hold of the alchemical elixir called Intent to Awaken (bodhicitta), which must be thor oughly transmuted.” Vesna Wallace (1997, 19) translates almost identically; in this verse, it appears, rasajāta is unmodified mercury that must be properly transmuted to be safe for consumption, implying that some refinement of the initial raw bodhicitta is neces sary. (However, Matthew Kapstein [email communication, 9 July 2014] points out that both the Sanskrit commentator and the Tibetan translation do not take vedhanīyaṃ as translated above, but rather in the active sense, “able to transform [this aśuci-pratimā to a jina-ratna-pratimā, 1.10ab]”—e.g., Prajñākaramati glosses atyuccavedhakāritvād—atīva vedhanīyam.) Our passage does support this latter reading, for here we certainly have siddha-rasa denoting a mercury preparation that can transmute base metals into gold (or more accurately, extract gold from base metals). Thus, the pure dynamic power of aware ness called cit is here compared to a chemical catalyst: it needs no refinement or alteration, but can alter that which it contacts.

others] of such nature that are cognized [as aspects of that “I”], then in this state [called] Beyond the Fourth they abandon (as it were) their objectivity. 

Having introduced the three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, Abhi navagupta now discusses turya and turyātīta, which complete the set of the “phases of lucidity.” Now, in this passage, I take Abhinava to be reconciling two modes of realization: one gnostic, rapid, transcendent, and liberating, and the other yogic, gradual, immanent, and siddhi-conferring. Here, the Fourth state is the gnostic realization that one has wrongly taken objective realities to be the self; it is waking up out of the trance of believing“I am the body,” etc. Such a real ization can be sudden because it requires no transformation, only a recognition of what is already the case, including a reflective awareness (parāmarśa) of the qualities (dharmas) of one’s real self. As Torella puts it, “the adept, after becom ing aware of the supreme nature of the I, becomes as though withdrawn from the knowable which formed his fictitious identity” (2002, xxxiv). Turya is then an exclusive kind of realization. By contrast, the process of turyātīta (“Beyond the Fourth,” but not actually a fifth state)—here described in terms of pene trating the layers of that constructed identity with this deeper awareness or transcendent I-sense—is inclusive and gradual, requiring yogic practice. In the turyātīta experience, the objective layers of the limited self are seen as expres sions of the transindividual divine consciousness, and thus are recovered as part of a greater “I” than the one they were excluded from in the previousturya state. This process by which the cidātman penetrates the layers of body, etc., is likened to alchemical transformation, whereby the elixir called siddha-rasa transforms a base metal into gold (or extracts the gold from the base metal).11 The use of the word iva (last word of the passage just cited) denotes that the body etc. do not actually cease to be knowables when they come to be seen as nothing but crystallizations of the dynamic “liquid” essence of conscious ness in the turyātīta state,12 just as the previousiva denoted that emerging from 

11 Cf. Kulārṇava-tantra 14.89: rasendreṇa yathā viddham ayaḥ suvarṇatāṃ vrajet | dīkṣā viddhas tathā hy ātmā śivatvaṃ labhate priye ||, “Just as iron penetrated by mercury becomes gold, even so a soul penetrated by initiation becomes divine.” Torella writes, “[here] the various components of the levels of the limited subject are gradually pene trated by the elixir of the I, until they become, so to speak, transfigured, removed from their nature of [being merely] knowable realities” (2002, xxxiv).

identification with knowables does not mean completely leaving them behind (which would entail physical death). 

Now, the coherence of this passage only emerges after the emendation to the edition suggested by Torella and adopted here, that of exchanging the words turya and turyātīta. This may seem a dramatic emendation, but it would make little sense for Abhinava to list the three states of ordinary consciousness, then proceed to turyātīta when what is obviously called for is turya, “the Fourth.” Further, it would make no sense to argue that turya is an extension of the tury ātīta state without completely ignoring the meaning of those two words; but the other way around exactly matches the meaning of the words. 

But what would occasion such a confusion in the edition? It may well be that later scribes (for we do find the edition’s reading in the manuscripts), influ enced by the more transcendentalist mainstream Indian philosophies, simply could not imagine that turya could denote the transcendent state while tury ātīta, which is obviously intended as the higher attainment, embraced imma nence. But this is precisely in line with Abhinavagupta’s Kaula view, for with the text emended as Torella suggests, we have here a model that is central to the Kaula Kālīkula, which Sanderson characterizes as “transcendence followed by an expansion that causes the state of enlightenment to pervade the tran scended” (Sanderson 2007, 402–403). The Śivasūtra (well known to Abhinava) inherits this model, teaching the “establishing of this realization first through withdrawal into the heart of consciousness and then through its expansion into the states that constitute the mundane awareness of the bound” (ibid.), which precisely characterizes our ĪPV passage. For example, in the Śivasūtra (1.7) we find the teaching that the Fourth state can spread to the ordinary states of jāgrat, svapna, and suṣupta, imbuing them with awakened conscious ness, which the Śivasūtra calls turyābhoga but which is simply turyātīta under another name.13 Of course, an examination of all the extant ĪPV manuscripts, preferably after forming a critical stemma, would be necessary to make a final ruling on the reading of the passage. 

To return to our text, Abhinava concludes his ĪPV discussion of ĪPK III.2.12 by informing us that turya and turyātīta are forms of samāveśa, which, when it becomes continuous and stable (āsyate), is itself liberation. 

seyaṃ dvayy api jīvanmuktāvasthā samāveśa ity uktā śāstre, samyag-āve śanam eva hi tatra tatra pradhānam, tat-siddhaye tūpadeśāntarāṇi |

alchemical metaphors for spiritual transformation 151 

This twofold state of one who is liberated while living is called samāveśa in the scriptures. For complete entering14 is itself primary in each of these; other teachings are [only] for its attainment. 

This is a surprising statement, perhaps, for I know of no scriptural passage in which these two states are called samāveśa. What Abhinava wants us to under stand, I think, is that when the scriptures use the term samāveśa, they are always referring to one of these two states. In turya, then, one fully and directly penetrates into one’s true nature, while in turyātīta, one causes that nature to fully and gradually penetrate the objective levels of one’s limited selfhood; for this reason they can both be appropriately referred to with the word samāveśa (from ā√viś, to penetrate). Abhinava continues: 

dehapāte tu parameśvara evaikarasaḥ, iti kaḥ kutra kathaṃ samāviśet 

But at the fall of the body, there is only one essence: the Supreme Lord. Thus, who could enter (/immerse), where and how? 

In other words, it is only meaningful to speak of samāveśa in the context of embodiment, for only in that context are there apparently differentiated layers of selfhood such that there can be an “entry” of the locus of identity (ahaṃ bhāva) from the body, etc., into cit, or an “entry” of cit into one of the layers of limited selfhood (dehādi)—the former entry being turya and the latter tury ātīta. 

4 The Parallel Passage in the ĪPVV 

The corresponding ĪPVV passage (KSTS vol. 65, 327–331) is similar but sheds more light on some important points while simultaneously greatly complicat ing the issue. Abhinava elaborates further on the alchemical metaphor briefly introduced in the ĪPV; here, though, if we do not emend the published text, he appears to have changed his view from that seen in the ĪPV. There the alchemi cal metaphor was reservedfor the turyātīta state, while here we see two stages of the alchemical metaphor, corresponding to both turya and turyātīta.15 Further more, it seems that he now posits two different modalities for attaining both 

14 Abhinava is telling us that the sam- in samāveśa is in the sense of samyañc. 15 Though Torella proposes an emendation which would bring the ĪPVV in line with the ĪPV (see below).

states, one gnostic and one yogic. (Here I differ from Torella’s 1994 hypothesis that a single turya state bifurcates into two kinds of turyātīta.) Abhinava writes:

[Utpala teaches that] the “distinguishing mark of samāveśa” is “insight,” since it is opposed to the Impurity that is ignorance, being characterized by a perfect (samyag), that is to say complete (ā samantāt), entry into one’s true nature,16 obtaining which one becomes a gnostic ( jñānī), and practicing which, on the levels of body, prāṇa, etc., one becomes a yogī, due to attaining the glory (vibhava) that is an intrinsic quality of infinite Consciousness.

This is said [already in the ĪPV]: when the [true] I-sense, due to the power of the realization of its all-pervasiveness, eternality, etc., through the [scriptural] indication of its [innate] autonomy, emerges as it were from the objectified [levels of limited selfhood]—Void etc.—and abides [in its real nature], then that is the state [called] the Fourth. Nevertheless [in that state] the impressions of the Void, etc., still remain. Thus this has exactly the same [nature] as [that which is called] the “separated tury ātīta.”

Without this emendation, the following comment turyātīta-samatā eva makes little sense. 18 iti vyatireka ] conj. em. Torella; iti avyatireka Ed. Following this emendation (proposed in an email, 15 July 2014) we can take vyatireka in the sense of kevala or kaivalya, i.e., a spir itual state which is separated from the saṃskāras but does not dissolve them. Even if we do not emend, we can still argue for the same meaning: avyatireka- could indicate that he is “unseparated” from his saṃskāras in the sense of still having them, though they are now powerless to obscure his real nature. However, the emendation makes for a clearer meaning. 
 

alchemical metaphors for spiritual transformation 153 

Though I am not aware of another usage of the technical term vyatireka turyātīta, the meaning here is clear enough (after applying Torella’s suggested emendation): the gnostic who does no yoga enters into a transcendental turya state in which he is authentically immersed in his essence, but the impres sions of limited selfhood from which he has successfully separated (vyatireka) himself from remain undissolved (thus his social self might exhibit little to no change). Thus, Abhinava argues, the attainment of turyātīta of the vyatireka variety is in fact no different from the turya state itself. This obviously sets up the possibility of a higher attainment, an avyatireka-turyātīta in which one dissolves those impressions through practice, allowing the practitioner to be not-separated (avyatireka) from his body, mind, etc., yet still liberated; i.e. an immanentist state of liberation. 

It is hard to see what Abhinavagupta has gained here, because in the sim pler ĪPV model, turya was the transcendental state and turyātīta the immanent (and therefore higher) attainment. Perhaps he simply wants to indicate here that either state can be attained by either gnostic or yogic means. But there is more evidence to examine before drawing conclusions. 

Now we see the yogic version of the turya → turyātīta progression. In the fol lowing paragraph (continuing directly from the previous ĪPVV citation), note that the first part closely parallels the ĪPV passage we have seen above (pp. 147– 149), while the second part is new data. 

yadā tu parāmṛṣṭa-nityatva-vyāpitvādi-dharmakaiśvarya-ghanātmanā ahambhāva-siddharasena śūnyādi-deha-dhātv-antaṃ19 vidhyate yena prameyatvāt tat cyavata iva, tadā turya-daśā; 

But when [all the layers of limited selfhood] from the Void to the tissues of the body are penetrated by the “alchemical elixir” that is the [true] I-sense—replete with the sovereignty in which the qualities of eternal ity, all-pervasiveness, etc., are cognized [as aspects of that “I”]—through which [penetration] they abandon (as it were) their objectivity, then that [too] is [called] the Fourth State.

When, further, these elements of prāṇa, body, etc., [already] penetrated by the elixir of Awareness, are thoroughly permeated [by it], they are [then] “digested” like the element of gold [is by mercury], by which [pro cess] their purifier, the“liquefied essence” [of Awareness] as it were, alone remains—then that too is the state Beyond the Fourth. 

Here we have a clear progression of turya → turyātīta without the necessity of emendation. Or do we? According to the earlierĪPV passage, in the Fourth state, one simply transcends the objective layers of the self, rather than those lay ers losing their objectivity. Thus, either Abhinavagupta has changed his view since writing the ĪPV, or an emendation is indeed necessary here. If the lat ter, we could either emend tat to sa (“one leaves behind their objectivity”) or we could emend turya-daśā (in the first paragraph above) to turyātīta-daśā. The latter solution, tentatively proposed by Torella in an email communica tion (July 2014), seems to me to ignore the grammar that suggests two stages here (the first structured around the relative/correlative yadātu…tadā, and the second around yadāpi …tadāpi); or rather, more correctly, he sees the grammar (after his emendation) as referring not to two successive stages but to two kinds of turyātīta, the api in tadāpi informing us that “thus, this too isturyātīta.” How ever, then we have the problem that two apparently distinct stages of the same process are denoted by the very same word, turyātīta. That they are distinct stages is evidenced by the fact that in the first phase (the paragraph ending with the compound turya-daśā), we see the verb √vidh (penetrate20), and in the second (turyātīta) phase we have √vidh followed by abhini√viś, which here denotes a further development of the same process (as also indicated by the adverb atyantam, construing with abhiniviṣṭa). Furthermore, Abhinava’s reca pitulation of this discussion (KSTS vol. 65, 348) would seem to argue against Torella’s conjecture here. On the other hand, if we did adopt the emendation, it would allow us to preserve the notion seen in the ĪPV that turya is the gnos tic attainment and turyātīta the yogic one. It seems to me, however, that this creates more problems than it solves. 

In summary, by not adopting the emendation, we see here a yogic21 ver sion of the Fourth state that can be developed into the state Beyond the Fourth, thus indicating a change in Abhinavagupta’s thought since the ĪPV. 

20 Note that the verb is here being used in a more precise sense than in the ĪPV passage, in which (I argue) it means “transmute.” See also the extended discussion on vedha-dīkṣā in TĀ 29, translated in an appendix to my doctoral dissertation (Wallis 2014). 

21 Besides the alchemical metaphor, Abhinava signals to us that this is a yogic process with the word aiśvarya, which, like v(a)ibhava, often relates to yogic power (siddhi). 
 

alchemical metaphors for spiritual transformation 155 

To explain in more detail my understanding of this rather difficult passage, the process goes like this: having inundated/penetrated (viddha) the objective layers of selfhood (body etc.) with the “elixir” of one’s ultimate nature (i.e., saṃvid-rasa, autonomous dynamic consciousness), the “gold” hidden within them is extracted, i.e. their dependence on consciousness as their substrate is revealed.22When those layers have become completely permeated (abhiniviṣṭo ’tyantaṃ), through, one presumes, further spiritual practice,23 all trace of their objectivity (and the saṃskāras thereof) is “worn away” or “digested” ( jīrṇa) by the elixir of consciousness—as mercury eats up gold flakes—which thus becomes a single unitary mass of awareness (prakāśa-ghanam eva saṃvid rūpam, cited infra). 

Our understanding of Abhinava’s vision of this process depends in part on grasping his use of an alchemical metaphor rooted in the complex and often ambiguous rasāyana (alchemy, proto-chemistry) theories of medieval India. In this matter I was fortunate to receive the helpful comments of Professors Wujastyk and Houben (of the University of Alberta and the Sorbonne, respec tively), who clarified that jīrṇa here stands in for jāraṇa, one of the sixteen rasa-saṃskāras (alchemical processes). Jāraṇa can mean digestion, assimila tion, or swallowing (in much the same sense that we speak of an acid “eating away” at a metal). Here the alchemical elixir of the metaphor is of course pre pared mercury (siddha-rasa), which can indeed “digest” gold (the modern term is amalgamate).24 That Abhinavagupta was aware of the basics of alchemy is confirmed by his use of the compound druta-rasa, for according to Houben, “initially the mercury remains as fluid as before it started to ‘eat’ the gold etc. but at a certain point its viscosity increases significantly … [it] remains fluid or druta [only] as long as it is not saturated.”25 Clearly, Abhinava wishes to emphasize that here this saturation does not occur, that Consciousness must be 

22 Cf. Sarvajñānottara 1.5: tāmrasyaiva tu hematvam antarlīnaṃ yathā sthitam | antarlīnaṃ tathā jñeyaṃ śivatvaṃ pudgalasya tu (“Just as gold is hidden within copper, in the same way the Divinity which a man seeks to know is hidden within [him].”). 

23 In the present context, the nature of the yogic practice alluded to is very likely the proto kuṇḍalinīyoga that Utpaladeva outlines at ĪPK III.2.19–20 and which was presumably elaborated in his Vivṛti. For Abhinava, such practice must be animated by bhāvanā (con templative insight) to be truly effective. 

24 This can be clearly seen in a video made by Dr. Andrea Sella (Department of Chemistry, University College London), which includes the following comment: “[In ancient times] mercury was absolutely essential … in extracting gold and purifying it … what gold can do is, it can actually dissolve in mercury” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKxCw889qck &feature=youtu.be).

understood purely as a catalyst (something that effects change but is not itself affected): it remains as it is, a dynamic “fluid” essence (druta-rasa = cid-rasa). First, then, in this alchemical vision, the mercury transmutes the base metal into gold,26 then “digests” or absorbs it without a (perceptible) trace (as can be seen in the chemistry video cited in note 24).27 That is to say, if we follow the terms of the metaphor strictly, first the layers of body, etc., are experienced as expressions of the dynamic essence of awareness, then all the saṃskāras implanted in those layers through one’s earlier experience of them as other than awareness are dissolved or “digested.” 

To summarize, if we are constituting and interpreting the text correctly, Abhinava has changed his view as follows: in the ĪPV, turya is an exclusive, gnostic, transcendental state and turyātīta an inclusive, yogic, immanent one (the progression from one to the other exemplifying the typical Kaula model of transcendence followed by pervasion), with the alchemical metaphor denot ing only the turyātīta stage; whereas in the ĪPVV, there is a rapid gnostic version of turya progressing to turyātīta (in which saṃskāras are not dissolved) and a gradualist yogic version of the same (in which they are dissolved in the turyātīta phase), both stages (of the latter) being described in terms of the alchemical metaphor. In the second text, then, we have a fork in the road, giving us four stages, only two of which a given practitioner is likely to traverse. 

Before we move on to examine the last version of the alchemical metaphor, we have one more problem with the present passage: how to interpret the final compound of the phrase sa druta-rasa iva ābhāti kevalaṃ tat-saṃskāraḥ. Here I differ from Torella (2002, 209 n. 35), who seems to interpret it to mean that only the saṃskāras (impressions) of śūnyādi-dehāntam remain. However, that case was already specified for the first, gnostic turyātīta (tadāpi ca śūnyādi saṃskāro ’py asti, above), and if that were intended here we would have noth ing to differentiate the two turyātītas described. Thus I take tat-saṃskāraḥ in apposition to druta-rasaḥ, in the meaning “the purification (or refinement) of that,” or, as translated above on page 10, as a bahuvrīhi meaning “their purifier,” the antecedent of the neuter pronoun tat being śūnyādi-dehāntam in either 

26 Even though professional alchemists must have known that mercury actually extracts gold from a base metal, rather than magically transmutes that metal into gold, vedha is cer tainly used in the sense of transmute or transform—see the citations in note 10, in one of which √vidh is glossed with pari√ṇam (Rasa-ratna-samuccaya-bodhinī ad 8.95). See also the relevant statement in Roşu 1982, 366: “la transsubstantiation [alchimique] du corps (deha-vedha) étant calquée sur la transmutation des métaux vils (loha-vedha) …” He cites Rasārṇava 12.165–166 in support (ibid., note 21).

case. Torella argues (email communication, 10 July 2014) that the saṃskāras of śūnyādi-dehāntam cannot be entirely dissolved here because then there would be no possibility of samāveśa, since, consciousness having become a single unitary mass, there would be nothing that could enter or be entered (cf. p.151supra).However,while Abhinava unambiguously does say thiswith regard to the after-death state (dehapāte tu eka-ghanā eva śivateti tadā samāveśādi vyavahāro na kaścid, KSTS vol. 65, 328), I am not at all sure that he thought it impossible to go beyond samāveśa, as generally understood, before death; after all, in a continuous nondual state of “complete immersion” (a new sense of samāveśa starting with Utpala’s usage; see Wallis 2014) there will no longer be any kind of “entry” or “penetration” (ā√viś) per se. 

We need not speculate overmuch on this question, however, for we can find evidence to suggest that Abhinava did regard such supervention of samāveśa as possible. That evidence is found almost twenty pages further on in the ĪPVV (KSTS vol. 65, 348, commentary on ĪPK III.2.19), where he recaps his earlier dis cussion (our most recent passage above) but also adds new information:

Another possibility is to not emend the text, and take it instead to be speaking of the digestion/dissolution of the brass or copper (pītala) that remains after gold has been extracted from it. This has not been adopted on the assumption that the present passage recaps the one on p. 153 supra. Also, I presume that Abhinavagupta, not being himself an alchemist, viewed the process of vedha as one of transmutation more than extraction—and if so, there would be no brass (or copper) left to digest. Further, the metaphor of transmutation suits his purposes better.

[b] [objectivity] is completely destroyed or “liquefied”—i.e. in the state Beyond the Fourth, the level of Goddess-consciousness, as it were [śākta-saṃvit, i.e. śakti-tattva]—according to the maxim of liquid mercury thoroughly digesting the remaining “gold,” i.e. the power of the impression(s) of that [objectivity], which [now] have the appearance of gold [i.e., radiant and soft] due to having been thor oughly penetrated by the innate form of that [“I”/rasa], 

then [in either case] 

[c] there is simply the delightful blossoming of full autonomy, even while the body exists.29 

This passage features a piling on of parenthetical phrases that is rather easier to understand in the Sanskrit than in literal English translation;30 I have illus trated the basic structure here as“when a) or b), then c).” Several things become 

29 Some parallel passages: cf. TĀ 14.12, TĀ 5.151 (svayaṃbhāsātmanānena tādātmyaṃ yāty ananyadhīḥ | śivena hematāṃ yadvat tāmraṃ sūtena vedhitam ||), and Yogarāja’s com mentary ad Paramārthasāra 96, a verse on anupāya and atitīvra-śaktipāta, the effect of which is compared by the commentator to alchemical transformation by means of siddha rasa ( yathā tāmra-dravyaṃ siddharasa-pātāt suvarṇībhavati). Note that later in the same passage the aspirant is referred to as anugraha-śakti-viddha-hṛdayasya, “one whose heart has been penetrated/transmuted by the power of divine grace (i.e., śaktipāta).” We find the same terminology used with reference to dīkṣā, e.g. in the Kulārṇava-tantra (14.89): rasendreṇa yathā viddha-mayaḥ suvarṇatāṃ vrajet | dīkṣā-viddhas tathā hy ātmā śivatvaṃ labhate priye ||, “Just as [a metal] penetrated by mercury becomes gold, even so a soul penetrated by initiation becomes divine.” Cf. Goodall 2004, 402 note 904: 

The conception that gold can be created out of copper with an alchemical preparation is, as Prof. Isaacson has pointed out to me, commonly used in tantras as an image for the irreversible transformation that takes place in dīkṣā. See, e.g., Kiraṇa 59.36c–38b … And cf. Sarvajñānottara 1.6 (Devakoṭṭai ed.):rasa-viddhaṃ yathātāmraṃ hematvaṃ pratipady ate | tathātmā jñāna-sambandhāt śivatvaṃ pratipadyate ||. Cf. also Haravijaya 6.137 … In his commentary thereon Alaka cites the following verse: rasa-ghṛṣṭaṃ yathā tāmraṃ na bhūyas tāmratāṃ vrajet | evaṃ yuktaḥ śivatvena na bhūyaḥ paśutām vrajet. 

I render the last verse cited as: “Just as copper rubbed with mercury [becomes gold and] does not again become copper, in the same way one united with Divinity does not again become a bound soul.” Goodall informs me (email communication, 13 July 2014) that the Sarvajñānottara verse cited in his footnote (viz., 1.6) is the most typical form of the maxim; the verse immediately preceding it is cited above in note 22. 

30 And I wonder if the largely redundant first part of the long compound (tan-nija-rūpa samyag-viddha-kanaka-rūpatā), which fits awkwardly, might have been a marginal anno tation in a manuscript that got incorporated into the main text. However, it may be more likely that Abhinava is here incorporating language that Utpala used in his lost Vivṛti, as he tends to repeat Utpala’s compounds with added glosses. 
 

alchemical metaphors for spiritual transformation 159 

clear from this paragraph, despite its density. First, if my translation is correct, it corroborates my reading of the previous alchemical passage. Second, it con firms that the saṃskāras are indeed “thoroughly digested” in the state Beyond the Fourth (atyanta-jaraṇāpādita-tat-saṃskāra-), and that this can occur with the body still existing (deha eva sati api). However, having said this, we must note that “thoroughly digested” does not mean “entirely destroyed” if Abhi navagupta is holding strictly to the terms of his metaphor; for when mercury absorbs gold leaf such that the gold is entirely dissolved and thus completely invisible, it is in fact still present in the mercury and can be retrieved by evap orating the latter in a retort. We have no way of knowing if Abhinava knew this, but if so, Torella could well be correct in arguing that a subtle trace of the saṃskāras (which are themselves subtle traces) can remain in the turyātīta daśā. What certainly is entirely dispelled or dissolved (sarvathaiva pradhvaṃ sitā vidrāvitā vā) in that state is objectivity, which was only“covered” (ācchāditā) by subjectivity in the turya state. 

We find similar language in chapter three of the Pratyabhijñā-hṛdaya, authored by Abhinavagupta’s disciple Kṣemarāja, where the Sadāśiva-tattva is described in these terms: “[a level of consciousness] in which an implicit and indistinct objectivity is covered by [the predominant] subjectivity [literally, ‘I-ness’]” (sadāśiva-tattve ahantācchāditāsphuṭedantā-mayaṃ).31 Thus, accord ing to the Pratyabhijñā schema, abiding in turya means achieving the īśvara or sadāśiva-tattva and abiding in turyātīta means reaching the śakti-tattva. In either case the result is the “delightful blossoming of full autonomy” (pūrṇa svātantryollāsa), i.e. liberation. But if the yogic/alchemical turyātīta is equiv alent to reaching śakti-tattva, are we supposed to understand that the gnostic turyātīta reaches śiva-tattva, despite the fact that the latter turyātīta does not dissolve the saṃskāras and the former does? If so, does Abhinava mean to imply subtly that Śakti is in reality higher than Śiva? This would contradict the mainstream doctrines of Śaivism, but not of the Krama, the sect of Abhi nava’s first initiation. We know from the Mālinī-vijayottara-tantra, Abhinava’s root-text, that the tattvas of Sadāśiva and Īśvara are indeed associated with the Fourth state and that “Śiva and Śakti exist in the state Beyond the Fourth” (2.28c–29b32). So we would expect that the two turyātītas are associated with tattvas 1 and 2. But which is which? 

31 However, Kṣemarāja loc. cit. positsīśvara-tattva as a level in which subjectivity and objec tivity are equal and opposite, whereas in our present passage Sadāśiva and Īśvara are not differentiated, both being described as a level at which objectivity is “covered.”

The reader will recall that we looked ahead eighteen pages in our primary source to see how Abhinavagupta recapitulated his alchemical metaphor. Now we return to our main passage (KSTS vol. 65, 330) to address the questions just raised. First we see that the distinction we have posited between the gnostic and yogic paths to liberation is not as clear-cut as it would seem: 

yadā tu dehādeḥ kiṃ tattvam iti cintopakramaṃ prakāśa-ghanam eva saṃvid-rūpam iti,tadā bodha-svarūpīkṛtaṃtad-rasānuviddham iva33śūn yādi-dehāntam avabhāti. iti abhyāsāt tasya saṃvid-dharmāḥ śakti-viśe ṣāḥ samyag āviśanto vibhūtīr utthāpayanti. anabhyāse ’pi tu tat-kṣaṇāve śa eva ānandodbhava-kampa-nidrā-vyāpti-rūpa-ghūrṇy-āvirbhāvana-kra meṇa jīvanmuktatā-lābhaḥ | 

When one begins to contemplate “What is the reality of the body, etc.?” [and subsequently realizes] “it is simply a form of awareness, replete with the Light of Consciousness,” then those [levels] from the Void to the body manifest as [they really are,] of one essence with Awareness, as if trans muted by its elixir. Thus, due to practicing [this insight], the qualities of His consciousness, which are aspects of śakti, fully penetrate [those various levels], causing the [various] powers (vibhūti) to arise. But even without practice, in the [rare] case of an instantaneous immersion into That, one obtains the state of liberation-in-life through the process of the direct experience of [the Five Mystic States]: Bliss, Ascent, Trembling, Sleep, and “Whirling,” which means Pervasion. 

This passage serves as an explanation of tat-śakti-samāveśa in Utpala’s Vṛtti on III.2.12. The passage confirms for us that Abhinava sees samā√viś (= atyantam abhini√viś in the previous iteration of the alchemical metaphor) as denoting the further development of the process first denoted by √vidh. More impor tantly, here we find crucial evidence that the distinction between the yogic and gnostic in Abhinavagupta’s thought is not as clear-cut as we have been led to expect: in this passage, a contemplation (cintā) on the nature of real ity leads to a realization that entails a spiritual transformation metaphorically described as alchemical transmutation (= turya stage), which then may be sta bilized and enhanced with yogic practice such that the qualities of this deeper awareness (e.g., svātantrya-śakti) come to fully penetrate or infuse (samā√viś)

all the layers of limited selfhood (= turyātīta stage). Gnostic realization is here inseparably wedded to the pañcāvasthāḥ or Five Mystic States that we see repeatedly in the Kaula scriptures. This emphasis on direct experience (āvir bhāvana) demonstrates that Abhinava’s understanding of the path of the jñānī is not one of intellectual or conceptual realization, but rather one of insights into the nature of reality so powerful that they spontaneously bring on psy chophysical experiences. 

Curiously, he uses the phrase “instantaneous immersion” or kṣaṇāveśa in describing gnostic realization but then immediately follows it with the term krama, denoting a sequential process of passing through the Five States. I would hypothesize that Abhinava is saying that each of the Five States is (or rather can be) an example of kṣaṇāveśa; even though there is a process, it may unfold spontaneously and in sudden leaps, in connection with the jñānī’s deep contemplation of the nature of reality. 

At any rate, now our reading of two distinct tracks (or two distinct turyātī tas), one gnostic and one yogic, is problematized. Yet we cannot abandon it, for on the very next page of our text (KSTS vol. 65, 331) we find the following: 

turya iti etad-daśā-samāpatti-paryanta-rūpā api turyātītatā tatraiva uktā, vyatirekeṇatu śūnyāder avasthāpane bodhasyaturyātītatātatraiva uktā— śuddhātmatā niṣkalatā śuddha-caitanyam iti sāmānya-darśaneṣu sarvot tīrṇaika-tadrūpa-vedakeṣu darśiteti sūcayati | 

The state of turyātīta taught [above] with reference to that [blossoming of insight34] is simply the [further] extension of the realization of the state called turya. But that state of turyātītawas taught there as a state of aware ness in which Void etc. remain [as objective knowables], but is separated (vyatireka) [from them].35 This is the state referred to as “the pure Self,” “the Formless,” and “pure Consciousness” in the Saiddhāntika scriptures. It is taught with reference to those who know the Deity36 solely as [being] all-transcendent; so [Utpaladeva] indicates [in his Vivṛti]. 

34 Inferring the antecedent of tatra from the previous line: jñānollāsa iti ajñāna-vigamād advaya-bodha-prasaraṇād ullāsa[ḥ], “ ‘the blossoming of insight is a blossoming that results from the departure of ignorance and the [concomitant] spread of nondual aware ness.” 

35 Exactly how to construe the grammar of this sentence is not clear to me, nor am I con vinced that the text is secure. 

36 For Abhinava’s use of tadrūpa to mean the Deity, see, e.g., TĀ 1.173c–174b.

Again we are presented with the notion of a vyatireka-turyātīta, though here its transcendental as opposed to its gnostic character is stressed. Since this state is associated with the transcendent deity (sarvottīrṇaika-tadrūpa, a kenning for Anāśrita-śiva, usually considered tattva 1), we are inclined to conclude that, as suggested previously, Abhinava wishes us to understand that the turyātīta which accesses the śakti-tattva is in fact the superior one. Perhaps this is not stated explicitly because it is a subversive view relative to the mainstream of the tradition. 

Here Abhinava criticizes the exclusively transcendentalist view of the Said dhāntikas, since as a nondualist Śākta he wishes to privilege the Kaula “imma nentist” view. Likewise, his disciple Kṣemarāja argues that the defining feature of their lineage (trikādi-darśana, meaning the view of the Trika-Krama synthe sis uniquely expounded by Abhinavagupta) is the view that the Divine Self is simultaneously transcendent of all and immanent in all.37 Now, since the tran scendental turyātīta is identified with the teachings of the sāmānya-śāstra (i.e., right-current Śaiva Siddhānta), we would expect the yogic-cum-alchemical turyātīta to be identified with the viśeṣa-śāstra (i.e., left-current Śākta streams), and just such identification is found by Torella (2002, xxxiv note 52) on the same page of the ĪPVV as the passage just quoted, but to me the text is not so clear. Apparently glossing viśeṣa-darśaneṣu in Utpala’s lost Vivṛti, Abhinava says (KSTS vol. 65, 331): “The specialized views are those which predominantly teach the nonduality of Power [and the Power-holder, i.e. Consciousness]; they are superior (viśeṣa) because they teach the Power-characteristics of the Self, [and thereby] lead one to the direct experience [of that]” (viśeṣa-darśaneṣu iti śāktādvaita-pradhāneṣu, viśeṣaḥ śakti-lakṣaṇa ātmano darśyate sākṣātkāraṃ nīyate yeṣu). There is no explicit correlation with the second, yogic turyātīta, but perhaps we can assume it because the power element of the self (vai bhavādi) is repeatedly mentioned in the passages we have examined in con nection with that turyātīta. 

37 From chapter 8 of his Pratyabhijñāhṛdaya: “The Tāntrikas (= Saiddhāntikas and other rit ualists) hold that the reality of the Self is all-transcending. Those attached to traditions such as the Kula say it is all-embodying. Those who hold [our] viewpoint of the Trika and [the Krama] hold that it is [simultaneously] all-transcending and all-embodying” (viśvot tīrṇam ātma-tattvam iti tāntrikāḥ, viśva-mayam iti kulādy-āmnāya-niviṣṭāḥ, viśvottīrṇaṃ viśvamayaṃ ca iti trikādi-darśana-vidaḥ).

Now to summarize what we have learned about these two states of immer sion.38 The primary distinction Abhinava wishes to make is that the first turya → turyātīta constitutes an “active” entry/immersion into one’s essence-nature (one’s satya-svarūpa or ahaṃbhāva, which is cidānanda and prakāśa-ghana), and the second turya → turyātīta denotes a “passive” process by which one is entered; i.e., that in which the various layers of selfhood are permeated by that ultimate I-sense (note that it is passive only in the grammatical sense, for the yogic method involves considerably more work). This distinction is summed up as āveśyāveśaka-bhāvaḥ (p. 331). Since the yogic process is a gradual one, differ ences are noted between turya and turyātīta, whereas the gnostic turyātīta is said to be identical in nature (though presumably not in degree) to the turya that precedes it (turyatā … turyātīta-samatā). 

Table 6.1 summarizes the data in tabular form (items in parentheses are only implicit in the primary source text). 

6 Problems of Interpretation 

To close, I will briefly discuss some interesting ambiguities and difficulties of these sections of the ĪPV and ĪPVV, apart from those already discussed above and in the notes. The first problem is the one raised (but not discussed) by Torella (2002, xxxv note 52), who tells us that Abhinavagupta’s inclinations lie towards the second turyātīta, the yogic-alchemical one. This seems evident from the passages we have translated here, but on the other hand it is surpris ing, because in general Abhinava tends to privilege the gnostic over the yogic in his work. Perhaps the context of a clearly liberation-focused yoga outlined in ĪPK III.2.19–20 allowed him to endorse a term that otherwise so commonly denotes the pursuit of siddhi and bhoga in the Śaiva literature. 

But we have another problem with Torella’s hypothesis, one briefly discussed already above: the implication in these passages is that the gnostic turyātīta— (1) in Table 6.1—reaches the śiva-tattva, while (2) explicitly only reaches the śakti-tattva. My reasons for concluding that turyātīta (1) reaches the śiva-tattva are as follows: since the term turyātīta refers to the highest liberation where only the absolute“I” remains, and in the tattva-system that attainment is explic itly identified with the top two tattvas, turyātīta (1) must correspond to the śiva

a Note that the ĪPK itself (III.2.20) lists the levels of turya-attainment as those of the Vi jñānākalas (= level of Mahāmāyā, just outside the śuddhādhvan and therefore not yet lib erated), Mantras (= śuddhavidyā-tattva, lowest level of liberation), and Īśvara; but Abhinava takes mantreśa in that verse to refer to the Mantra-lords of īśvara-tattva, then reads-īśa a sec ond time, taking it to refer Lord Sadāśiva (Torella 2002, 208 note 33). Here he is making the correlation correspond to what is found in Trika scripture, for the Mālinī-vijayottara-tantra teaches that “the Mantras, Mantreśas and Mantramaheśvaras occupy the Fourth state” and “Śakti and Śiva exist in the state Beyond the Fourth” (2.28c–29b, trans. Vasudeva 2004, 209– 210). 

tattva, which also matches its transcendent nature (the Śiva of tattva 1 is often called Anāśrita-śiva39). Andwe have seen thatturyātīta (2) alignswith the śakti tattva. Now, it doesn’t seem altogether likely that Abhinavagupta would favor an attainment that reached only to tattva 2. However, he may well have held the view explicitly articulated by his successor Kṣemarāja, i.e. that there is no real ity to hierarchy with regard to Śiva/Śakti, they being two aspects of one reality, one or the other of them being more prominent in the liberated experience at any given moment (see Vasudeva 2004). In other words, Abhinava may have held the view that since Śiva and Śakti are in fact inseparable except heuristi cally, to attain one is to attain the other. Or perhaps, as already posited above, we are to understand that Abhinava is allusively suggesting that in this system, 

39 E.g., in Pratyabhijñā-hṛdaya chapters 4 and 5. 
 

alchemical metaphors for spiritual transformation 165 

Śakti is in fact tattva 1. Such a hidden doctrine would be in keeping with the rest of his esoteric theology, which constitutes a Trika doctrine with a Krama core. 

The other problem of interpretation that arises in connection with these passages is a philosophical one, not yet to my knowledge addressed in the secondary literature. This issue centers on the question of who is the agent of the various verbs used here, most especially √viś. For example, when it is said that “there is an entry into one’s true nature,” who or what is the agent of that entry, since the satya-svarūpa that is entered is the only real source of both awareness and agency? This problem is not glaringly obvious because of the nature of the Sanskrit language, in which passive voice is so common, and nouns or pronouns denoting the agent can be omitted entirely, the verb conjugation itself communicating a generic unspecified third-person agent. When a first-person active verb is used, for example when Kṣemarāja glosses namas or naumi as samāviśāmi (in his commentaries on stotras40), the prob lem is made evident: what exactly is the “I” that enters? Obviously it cannot be mind, body, etc. (since they have no agency of their own), nor can it be cit, for it would make no sense to say that consciousness, which is undivided, enters into itself. 

Two possible solutions occur. First, that what enters from the mind, etc., into the Self is a kind of “locus of subjective identity” or ahaṃbhāva. But Abhinava seems to use this term in the passages we have considered to mean the true I sense, the Self-that-is-awareness. The second and more likely solution is that this language of entry is purely metaphorical, derived from the phenomenol ogy of the experience it denotes (i.e., what it feels liketo have that experience), and that in actuality there is no entry at any time: the true “I” simply realizes itself or wakes up to itself, clearly apprehending itself. It may be the case that Abhinava addresses this problem of agency in relation to √viś verbs somewhere in his vast body of work, and I simply have not yet come across it. 

7 Postscript: Samāveśa and Turya in Tantrāloka 10 

Abhinavagupta also discusses turya and turyātīta briefly in Tantrāloka 10.264– 284. Though this passage is not directly a commentary on theĪPK (being instead a commentary on the phenomenological categories of Mālinī-vijayottara-tan tra, chapter 2 and passim), it clearly has in mind Utpaladeva’s phrase tat-śakti 

40 See Stainton 2013 or Stainton 2019. 
 

166 wallis 

samāveśa in the Vṛtti on ĪPK III.2.12 and very likely also alludes to his lost Vivṛti on the same.41 For Tantrāloka 10.265 informs us that turya is in fact śakti samāveśa!42 This seems to imply that turyātīta is śiva-samāveśa, which could match the ĪPV account but not the ĪPVV; again, perhaps Abhinava changed his view between the two, the latter having been composed after the Tantrāloka. Abhinava goes on (in TĀ 10) to subdivide this śakti-samāveśa into four stages, corresponding to the four epistemological categories of knower, knowing, known and the autonomous pure awareness (para-pramātṛ) which is the source and ground of the previous three (Vasudeva 2004, 230).43 The four stages are as follows. When immersion into this parā saṃvit is only proximate (tat-samāveśa-naikaṭyāt), object-consciousness is dominant (TĀ 10.270d–271a). When there is contact44 with this immersion, the process or faculties of know ing are dominant (tat-samāveśoparāgān mānatvam, 270cd). In full identifica tion with this immersion, the state of the knower becomes clear (tat-samāveśa tādātmye mātṛtvaṃ bhavati sphuṭam, 270ab). Beyond this, in the state of the so-called pure awareness in which all three previous categories have perfectly fused, in which there is perception but no sense of a separate perceiver or per ceived, the Light of Consciousness is self-manifest and we cannot speak of an immersion, except metaphorically (10.269). This helps us understand that the movement into the transcendent Fourth state can indeed happen in stages, the first three of which (prameya, pramāṇa, pramātṛ) are an expression of divine grace (trayaṃ tat tad-anugrahāt, 270b). We can infer that speaking of grace is meaningless in the fourth stage, where there is no duality (though the ĪPV and ĪPVV accounts tell us that there are still saṃskāras of duality at this stage). 

41 This supposition receives support from the fact that Abhinava explicitly comments on ĪPK III.2.15–17 further on in the same chapter (viz., TĀ 10). 

42 pūrṇatāgamanaunmukhyam audāsīnyāt paricyutiḥ | tat turyam ucyate śakti-samāveśo hy asau mataḥ ||, paraphrased by Vasudeva (2004, 229) as “In the fourth state … knowable entities appear as awareness on the verge of reaching plentitude because [the] indiffer ence [that characterized the third state of deep sleep] is abating. Abhinavagupta further identifies this state as an immersion into Śakti.” 

43 For the fourth category of pure awareness, see TĀ 10.269: pramātṛtā svatantratva-rūpā seyaṃ prakāśate | saṃvit turīya-rūpaivaṃ prakāśātmā svayaṃ ca sā ||, and Jayaratha ad loc.: parā saṃvid evam aṃśa-trayottīrṇā … svātantrya-mayī para-pramātṛtā … sā hi para pramātṛ-rūpā śuddhā saṃvit svayam prakāśate na tu paśyāmītyādi-vikalpollekha-bhūmiḥ. That there are four epistemological categories, not three, is due to the influence of the Krama, in which Kālī is identified with the fourth. 

44 Uparāga seems a strange word to use here; its commonest use is “eclipse” or “affliction”— perhaps we should emend to upayoga. 
 

Abhinava then defines turyātīta at 10.278: “that [state] whose beautiful nature is full and undivided, overflowing with joy, is called Beyond the Fourth; that alone is the supreme state” ( yat tu pūrṇānavacchinna-vapur ānanda-nir bharam turyātītaṃ tu tat prāhus tad eva paramaṃ padam45). His discussion goes on, but it reaches beyond the purview of the present work. 

8 Conclusion 

The present paper does not, of course, entirely solve the complex textual and exegetical problems we discovered in the comparison of these passages of the ĪPV and the ĪPVV, but perhaps it contributes towards an understanding of their significance for the study of Tantric Śaiva theology. Provisionally, I propose that we see Abhinavagupta changing, developing, and nuancing his view in the time between the ĪPV and the ĪPVV (with Tantrāloka falling between the two). If I am reading the texts correctly, the ĪPV features a simpler model of a gnos tic transcendentalist turya succeeded by a “immanentist” turyātīta (the latter being marked by the transcendent element’s pervasion of all that was previ ously transcended), while the ĪPVV proposes two distinct versions of both turya and turyātīta, gnostic and yogic respectively (giving us four categories in total), where the yogic is to be preferred despite being more gradual because in it the saṃskāras of dualistic experience are finally dissolved.

### 7 On Vāgīśvarakīrti’s Influence in Kashmir and among the Khmer 

Péter-Dániel Szántó 

1 Introduction 

The aim of this article is to point out the far-reaching influence of an East Indian tantric Buddhist scholar, Vāgīśvarakīrti ( floruit early 11th c.). In the first part I will show that his views were considered important enough to be con tested sometime before 1057ce, probably still during his scholarly activity, in Kashmir. In the second part I wish to propose the hypothesis that although unnamed, he is a master alluded to with great reverence on the Sap Bāk inscrip tion from the Khmer Empire, dated 1067ce.* 

“Our” Vāgīśvarakīrti should not be confused with his namesake, a Newar scholar from Pharping, whence his epithet Pham mthiṅ ba (for what we can gather about this person, see Lo Bue 1997, 643–652). Nor should we confuse him with a rather nebulous person, whose name is re-Sanskritised as *Suvā gīśvarakīrti, author of a number of small works extant in Tibetan translation. Lastly, there is no good reason to assume that he is the same as a commen tator of Daṇḍin’s Kāvyādarśa; this person’s name is often re-Sanskritised from the Tibetan as *Vāgīśvara, but it is more likely that his name was Vācaspati or Vāgīśa. 

The writings of Vāgīśvarakīrti are fairly well known to scholars of esoteric Buddhism. A significant portion of his oeuvre survives in the original Sanskrit. 

* I have already discussed these two subjects in two separate lectures. The first subject was tackled at the First Manuscripta Buddhica Workshop in Procida, Italy in May 2011, where I received some extremely valuable feedback, especially from Professor Harunaga Isaacson, with whom I also had the opportunity to briefly study the passage in question in Kathmandu some months earlier. The second problem I have merely alluded to in a lecture at Kyoto Uni versity in February 2015; Professor Arlo Griffiths commented on an early draft of my notes and kindly encouraged me to publish my findings (e-mail, December 4, 2014). A later draft was read by Dr. Johannes Schneider, whose suggestions greatly improved some of my state ments and saved me from a couple of blunders. To all involved, I offer my sincerest thanks. All remaining errors are mine.

While some of the attributions in the Tibetan Canon are disputed, the follow ing major works may be assigned to him with confidence. 

The Mṛtyuvañcanopadeśa is a learned anthology of rites to cheat death once its signs have been perceived. This work, which survives in at least four manuscripts,1 has been admirably dealt with recently by Johannes Schneider (2010). His German translation supersedes Michael Walter’s earlier English translation (2000). As Schneider conjectures (2010, 23), the Tibetan transla tion must have been completed in 1042/3ce, since this is the only time the two scholars mentioned in the translators’ colophon, *Adhīśa (better known as *Atīśa or *Atiśa) Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna and Rin chen bzaṅ po, spent time together at Tho liṅ. This date is also Schneider’s terminus ante quem for the text. 

The Saṃkṣiptābhiṣekavidhi is a succinct initiation manual for the Guhya samāja system, which also contains a fascinating polemic passage (Onians 2002, 279–289). At present we may access only one manuscript; this has been edited by Munenobu Sakurai, but is in dire need of being revisited. Another witness, now probably in Lhasa, is mentioned in the catalogue KCDS, p. 139. 

The Tattvaratnāvaloka (henceforth TaRaA), a short treatise in twenty-one verses, and a largely prose auto-commentary thereof, the Tattvaratnāvalokavi varaṇa (henceforth TaRaAVi), are usually mentioned in the same breath and are indeed transmitted together in the only known manuscript. These texts have been edited by (presumably) Banarsi Lal. The Tibetan translations were undertaken by ’Gos Lhas btsas (although only Tōh. 1890 / Ōta. 2754 is actually signed by him), whose activity falls in the middle of the 11th century (Davidson 2005, 139). 

The *Saptāṅga (henceforth SaA), another treatise, this time in mixed verse and prose, is the only major work of Vāgīśvarakīrti which appears to be lost in the original. One of its most important verses survives in quotation (Isaac son and Sferra 2014, 171, 271, passim). The Tibetan translation is the work of the same ’Gos Lhas btsas. 

I shall not discuss here Vāgīśvarakīrti’s other, minor works, or the fact that some of his major works are present more than once in various recensions of the Tibetan Canon, some of them even annotated. 

We shall have the opportunity to study some of Vāgīśvarakīrti’s ideas later on, although I cannot hope—nor do I propose—to be exhaustive here. The two most important features to keep in mind for the time being are these: that for the author, the most important cycle of tantric Buddhist teachings is the

Guhyasamāja, and that he was a proponent of the view that full initiation con sists of four consecrations, culminating in the so-called caturthābhiṣeka. There is very little hard evidence for a prosopography of Vāgīśvarakīrti. All modern authorities conjecture that he lived during the 10–11th centuries and all seem to accept the statements of Tibetan hagiographies, namely that he was active in Vikramaśīla in the rather nebulous capacity of “door-keeper.” The pri mary source for this information is Tāranātha’s famous historiography, the Rgya gar chos ’byuṅ, which dedicates a long passage to Vāgīśvarakīrti, presenting him as a scholar, an accomplished tantric practitioner, a miracle worker, and a pious founder (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970 [2004], 296–299). 

2 Vāgīśvarakīrti in Kashmir 

The source I shall be using for starting the discussion here is found in an unpublished and little-studied commentary of the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti, the Gūḍhapadā of one Advayavajra (incorrectly spelt as Advayavakra or perhaps Advayacakra in the colophon), which survives in a single manuscript. This is a voluminous text, occupying 180 densely written palm-leaf folios; according to the colophon, it measures 4,000 granthas. It has not been translated into Tibetan. This Advayavajra is very likely not the same as the famous Advayava jra or Maitreyanātha (some good reasons against this identification are listed in Isaacson and Sferra 2014, 74–75). 

Since it was not translated into Tibetan and it survives in a single manuscript, the Gūḍhapadā may nowadays be perceived as obscure. However, it was not an unknown work, at least not in the 12th century. Raviśrījñāna, one of the most famous exegetes of the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti, mentions it as one of the main sources he relied upon. Oddly, the particular verse where he does just this is not found in the published Amṛtakaṇikā, because the Sarnath editor did not have access to or ignored the tradition that transmits it. One such witness is Royal Asiatic Society London, Ms. Hodgson 35 (the so-called Vanaratna codex; see Isaacson 2008), folio 40r1–2.2 There can be little doubt that this closing verse is authorial: the Tibetan translation, although in a garbled way, mirrors

it (D 96a5–6, P 115a8–115b1), and Vibhūticandra’s sub-commentary, the Amṛ takaṇikoddyota, has some of its words in lemmata (Ed., p. 216, ll. 13–16).3 Vibhūticandra’s sub-commentary gives us the upper limit for Raviśrījñāna. The former first came to Tibet in 1204ce (Stearns 1996). We also know that the Amṛtakaṇikā is one of Raviśrījñāna’s earlier works, because he refers to it in his Guṇabharaṇī (Sferra 2000, 100). He cannot be much earlier than the late 12th century, since one of his masters, Dharmākaraśānti, lived during the reign of Gopāla (pace Sferra 2000, 47–48), in whose court he was a royal preceptor. This Gopāla must be Gopāla IV (r. ca. 1128–1143ce), because the other Gopālas are too early for Raviśrījñāna to mention all three bodhisattva commentators of the Kālacakra system (see here, note 2). Therefore the Gūḍhapadā must have been in existence around these dates. The debate we are about to examine seems to suggest a mid-11th-century environment, but we cannot be entirely certain. The Gūḍhapadā has the following commentary to Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti 8.41ab on folio 128r4–128v4. The text is first given in diplomatic transcript. The line is here marked in bold; the manuscript highlights it in red. An akṣara added in the upper margin in the second hand is marked thus ⟨ ⟩. A deleted anusvāra is marked with ⟨| |⟩. I have added the line numbers in square brackets. I split the passage into seven units—marked (a) to (g)—for the sake of easier reference.

For the pratīkas of pāda b we have this printed: … dapadam āśritā | śrīnāropādapañjikāsandhī(m adhītya) | The only manuscript of the Amṛtakaṇikoddyota I can consult for the time being is Tokyo University Library no. 18 (old no. 348), last folio, l. 1 and this fairly clearly reads ślāghyā gūḍhapadām āśritā | śrīnāropāda pañjikāsaṅgī (?) |

The beginning (tasyā eka° up to °vivekātmakas) and end (evaṃ eka° up to °āvabodhadhṛk) of the text—i.e. (a) and (g)—are of no concern to us here. These sentences should nevertheless act as cautionary devices that the passage is quite corrupt. Most of the content here is in any case an almost word-for word copy of Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī.4 

Unit (b) explains the compound ekakṣaṇa (“a singular moment”) in terms of post-Hevajra yoginītantra doctrine. According to this teaching, during ini tiation one experiences in sexual union the four “blisses” (ānanda), which are linked to four “moments” (kṣaṇa). This experience is then cultivated in medi tation leading to enlightenment, a state sometimes referred to as “the innate” (sahaja). The passage should therefore be interpreted something like this:“[It is a] singular moment, because it embodies in a unitary manner the four blisses. [And this is nothing else but] the moment of innate complete awakening, which, in turn, is beyond the fourth [state of consciousness—the four being wake, sleep, deep sleep, and the fourth].” 

Unit (c) seems to take a turn. Apparently, we have a continuation of the pre vious topic, but in fact here we turn to the problem of initiation. The passage is doubtless a quotation, introduced by tathā coktam. The author of the quoted passage is referred to—once we emend the text slightly, śrīmatkāśmīrīyaiḥ for śrīmaṅkāsmīrīyai5 and understand that the plural shows respect—as “the glo rious Kashmirian, the venerable Sūkṣmāvartabhaṭṭa.” The anuṣṭubh verse fol lowing may be restored thus: 

kaśmīreṣu kathā nāsti caturthasyeti †niskṛpaḥ† | 

asti deśāntare tāvac caturthaṃ samyak[ ]sevitam || 

4 For the sake of comparison, I give here Vilāsavajra’s text from Ms. Cambridge University Library Add. 1708, folio 81v5–7: ekakṣaṇamahāprājñaḥ sarvadharmāvabodhadhṛg iti | ekaś cāsau kṣaṇaś ca ekakṣaṇaḥ | mahāṃś cāsau prājñaś ca mahāprājñaḥ (em., °prājña Ms. post corr., °prājñaś caMs. ante corr.)sarvadharmavivekātmakaḥ (Ms. post corr., °ātmākaḥMs. ante corr.) | tataś cāyam arthaḥ sampadyate | ekenaiva kṣaṇena mahāprājñatayā yathoktasarva dharmāvabodhanatayā | ekakṣaṇamahāprājñasarvadharmāvabodhas(em., °āvabodha|sMs.) tad dhārayatīti ekakṣaṇamahāprājñasarvadharmāvabodhadhṛk || 

5 The first error ṅ for t in ligature with k is a simple orthographic error. The second is a banal feature of East Indian scribal habits: sibilants are freely interchangeable. The third is a cus tomary loss of visarga before sibilants, which may reflect pronunciation. 
 

on vāgīśvarakīrti’s influence 175 

The only real intervention here is sevitam for sevida[ḥ], which is nonsense, whereas sevitam is both grammatical and yields good meaning. The emenda tion kaśmīreṣu for kasmīreṣu is rather banal, but I remain undecided whether this should be emended further to kāśmīreṣu (“among Kashmiris” rather than “in Kashmir”); the plural is otherwise often used with both toponyms and inhabitants of a region. As we shall see, there must be an iti hiding in caturtha syaiti. Spelling ai for e is not uncommon in East Indian manuscripts, although of course it is incorrect. We can safely dismiss the idea that the reading is cor rect and what we have here is the present third person singular of the root i, “to go”; in that case we would expect an accusative, probably of an abstract noun, but nothing of the sort can be conjectured. The corrupt niskṛpaḥ (or perhaps niṣkṛpaḥ) unfortunately masks a crucial word. We shall return to it forthwith. 

The name of the author and the first third of the verse can be traced in Tibetan. The work in question is the *Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa, attributed in the colophon (D 159b3–4) to “the great Kashmiri master … *Ratnavajra” (kha che’i slob dpon chen po … dpal rin chen rdo rje). We see the same name in unit (e). Sūkṣmāvarttabhaṭṭa and Ratnavajra are one and the same, as the last verse of the work reveals (D 159b3): 

| dpal kha che’i slob dpon rin chen rdo rje daṅ | 

| mtshan gźan phra bar rtogs pa’i dpal źes bya’i | 

It is immediately apparent that there is something wrong with the Tibetan translation: the number of syllables per quarter is out of balance—the ini tial dpal could be superfluous—and the daṅ seems just a little bit off, unless we think it is justified inasmuch as it links a name and an alternative name. However, the underlying meaning is clear enough: the author identifies him self as a Kashmiri master called Ratnavajra, also known as *Sūkṣmāvartaśrī, as āvartta—with a slight stretch—can be reconstructed fromrtogs pa, whereasśrī is perhaps a metrical equivalent of bhaṭṭa or an unusual rendering into Tibetan. 

Whatever doubts we may have about having correctly traced the author, they are dispelled once we look at the first line of the treatise (D 156b2–3): 

| kha che ba la bźi pa’i gtam | | sṅar yaṅ yod par ma thos (em., thas) la | | da ltar yod pa mthoṅ na yaṅ | | bźi pa rñed pa ma yin no | 

Translated somewhat loosely, this means: 

Previously, in Kashmir (or: among Kashmiris) not a [single] word was heard of [this] “Fourth” [Initiation]; although nowadays we see it prac 
 

176 szántó 

ticed, [I will show that in fact] the “Fourth” cannot be found [to have authoritative sanction]. 

It is now clear that this is what we have echoed in our Sanskrit verse: kaśmīreṣu kathā nāsti caturthasyeti. The Tibetan ba (or pa?) seems to suggest that we should understand “among Kashmiris.” 

But now we have a stylistic problem. Apparently, the introduction to the quotation applies only up to iti. The corrupt †niskṛpaḥ† must be some sort of dismissive statement, since the second line seems to contradict Ratnavajra: true, Kashmir has not heard of the Fourth Initiation (caturtham), but this does not mean anything, since it does exist (asti) and is correctly practiced (samyak sevitam) in another land or other lands (deśāntare). One tentative solution for niskṛpaḥ may thus be niṣkṛtam (“disregarded”, “dismissed”), but I must confess that I still regard this as nothing more than a diagnostic conjecture. 

It is conceivable that we are wrong to emend śrīmaṅkāsmīrīyai to śrīmatkā śmīrīyaiḥ and that we must boldly conjecture bṛhatkāśmīrīye. As we have seen in the verse given here in note 3, Raviśrījñāna knew of such a work, since he lists it as one of his sources of inspiration. Moreover, this is not the only time he refers to it: in the body of Amṛtakaṇikā we find at least one reference (Ed., p. 25, l. 18), which is mirrored in the Amṛtakaṇikoddyota (Ed., p. 197, last line). If I interpret Vibhūticandra’s commentary correctly, in the text given here in note 4, he attributes this work to the famous Nāropāda. If Vibhūticandra is cor rect, we cannot take Ratnavajra/Sūkṣmāvarttabhaṭṭa to be the author of the Bṛhatkāśmīrapañjikā, since there is nothing to suggest that he might be the same as Nāropāda. (Of course, Vibhūticandra could be wrong, but then the number of variables becomes too great to contemplate meaningfully.) If we fol low this idea, the introduction would give the source for the entire verse—i.e. the Great Kashmiri Commentary—, in which Ratnavajra’s idea is embedded as a prima facie view. However, the stylistic problem remains: it would be very unnatural to give a title and then a name, which is not that of the author but that of an interlocutor in it. Perhaps it is not impossible that Ratnavajra’s other name was once a gloss meant to elucidate the ownership of the point to be refuted, and that this gloss made it into the main text at some point during transmission. 

Unit (d) is somewhat easier to tackle. The quotation reinforces the existence of the Fourth Initiation by quoting Vāgīśvarakīrti. The verse is very corrupt in the form given here, but fortunately we have access to the source, which is the TaRaA, verse 17. The TaRaAVi does not offer any explanation for the verse; indeed, it shrouds it in secrecy, stating that the meaning should be obtained from the oral teachings of a qualified guru (Ed., p. 100, l. 20: dambholītyādi| 
 

etat sadgurūpadeśato jñeyam|). Vāgīśvarakīrti seems to have changed his mind about this when he wrote his other major work, the SaA. There, he offers a very long explanation (D 199b7–201a3, P 235b4–237a2), alluding to the fact that mis understandings of his position prompted him to do so. This verse is also quoted by Raviśrījñāna in the Amṛtakaṇikā (Ed., p. 76, ll. 22–23). 

Thus, with the help of the TaRaA manuscript (Ms.), the edition (Ed.), the Tibetan translation (D and P agree in all the readings), the lemmata in the SaA (SaA), and Raviśrījñāna’s testimony as edited (AKa) with the readings of the unused Vanaratna codex (V, folio 29r10), we may restore unit (d) thus: 

kutaḥ | yad Vāgīśvarakīrtinocyate– 

dambholibījasrutidhautaśuddha 

pāthojabhūtāṅkurabhūtapuṣṭi | 

turīyaśasyaṃ paripākam eti 

sphuṭaṃ caturthaṃ viduṣo ’pi gūḍham || iti||6 

The verse does not immediately lend itself to understanding, but in the present context, as a cited authority, it must have been understood along these lines: 

Cleansed by the oozing of the seed (i.e. semen) from the thunderbolt (i.e. the officiant’s penis) growing as a sprout born from a purified lotus (i.e. the consecrated vulva of the consort), the crop that is the fourth [state of consciousness] comes to full bloom; [although] the Fourth [Initiation] is manifest, it is hidden even from the wise. 

The coded language expresses what happens in the three higher initiations (guhyābhiṣeka, prajñājñānābhiṣeka, caturthābhiṣeka), the first two of which are of a sexual nature. The SaA makes it clear that the first stage, where the seed from the thunderbolt oozes and cleanses, alludes to the guhyābhiṣeka, where in practice the officiating master copulates with a consort and the ejaculates are placed in the mouth of the blindfolded initiand. Via this rite, the mind of the initiand, which is similar to a field, is purified. The second stage, where a

sprout is said to be born and made to grow in a pure lotus, alludes to the prajñā jñānābhiṣeka, where it is the initiand who copulates with the/another consort. The sprout represents his fledgling wisdom. The logic of the allegory demands that it is in the caturthābhiṣeka where this sprout comes to full bloom, that is to say, reaches the highest state, here called “the Fourth.” This is somewhat con fusing, since just above the author of the Gūḍhapadā seems to advocate a state “beyond the fourth” as the highest. Also note that sphuṭam could be construed in a different way, either as an adjective to paripākam or an adverb to eti. 

Unit (e) is certainly the most challenging part of the passage. The first sen tence seems to condemn those who do not recognise (nāstipaḳsyā[ḥ]) the exis tence of the Fourth Initiation on account of their stupidity and selfishness. What exactly the aim of their desire (doctrinal or otherwise) is,I cannot tell.We do not fare any better with the next statement. The compound evamādikṛtasya escapes me completely. The next statement again seems to introduce a quota tion, but the accusative case is puzzling.It is perhaps better to emend to a nomi native while also fixing the first honorific. Thus we get:śrīmadratnavajrāṃghrir āha. The other honorific, aṃghri (lit. foot), is somewhat unusual. It doubtless stands for the more common °pāda and it may do so for metrical reasons: if we observe the metrical pattern of Ratnavajrāṃghrir āha, the words would fit the last seven syllables of a Mandākrāntā line. However, in this case we must give up on śrīmad°, since here we would require laghu-guru (short-long) and not guru-guru. This idea must be considered, for what follows is indeed a per fect Mandākrāntā line (with some minor corrections applied): bhrāntā yatra pravaramatayaḥ kīrtiśāntyādayo ’pi, i.e. “in which respect even those of the choicest intellect, such as Kīrti and Śānti, are deluded.” We may safely assume that yatra refers to the matter at hand, i.e. the veracity of the Fourth Initia tion, and we can reasonably suppose that these are Ratnavajra’s words, paying respect to his opponents, but claiming that they are wrong. Kīrti no doubt refers to Vāgīśvarakīrti, whereas Śānti is most likely shorthand for another great intel lect of early 11th-century Eastern India, Ratnākaraśānti. While Vāgīśvarakīrti’s position on the FourthInitiation is known, we know very little as to what Ratnā karaśānti thought of the matter.7 

Although we seem to understand this particular passage, there is a slight problem: it is not from the *Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa and it is not from any other work attributed to Ratnavajra in the Tibetan Canon. The next sentence, a corrupt anuṣṭubh, on the other hand can be traced in the *Caturthasadbhā 

7 The most likely place for addressing this would have been his Hevajra initiation manual (to which he refers as the Hevajrābhyudayamaṇḍalopāyikā; see Muktāvalī, Ed., p. 215, ll. 15–16), but this text is most unfortunately lost.

vopadeśa (D 157a7–157b1). I repeat the lines here along with the Tibetan trans lation, because they are quite crucial: 

idaṃ caturthālokakārakā pūrvadeśapaṇḍitaiḥ | 

vāṭyamātraṃ na vijñātā tadgranthatodgataṃ | 

| bźi pa sgron (em., sgrol) ma mdzad pa yi | 

| śar phyogs kyi ni mkhas pa yis | 

| gtam tsam yaṅ ni mi śes so | 

| de yi chos la bdag gis rtogs | 

The pronoun idaṃ is puzzling and I am tempted to disregard it completely, all the more so since the Tibetan does not mirror it. Alternatively, one could emend it to ittham and consider it as an introductory statement. Emending the Tibetan sgrol to sgron is warranted by the Sanskrit °āloka°, and this makes good sense, because this is an attested title to which we will return shortly. If this is a title, it would make sense to emend °kārakā to °kārakaiḥ following the Tibetan mdzad pa yi understood in the sense of “author” to qualify the com pound in the next pāda, or to °kāraka° joining the line into one compound. Unfortunately, this creates a serious metrical problem. I do not have a solution at present, except suggesting that we do indeed need a word meaning “author” for the broken part. 

It is apparent that in the second verse quarter we are one syllable short. The most straightforward solution is probably to read °deśīya° for °deśa°. Assuming that the cruces hide a word meaning “author,” as I suggest, we would thus get a line in harmony with the Tibetan expressing a logical subject: caturthāloka- †kārakā†pūrvadeśīyapaṇḍitaiḥ, i.e. “the learned one from the Eastern lands, the author of the Caturthāloka.” The plural is, again, for showing—here, mock—respect. This pundit is none other than Vāgīśvarakīrti, since Caturthālo ka is an alternative title for his TaRaA. In fact, this alternative title seems to be the one preferred by the author himself, because this is the way he refers to his previous work in the SaA. He does so thrice (D 190b3, 199a2, 199b7 & P 225a7, 234b4, 235b4–5), calling the treatise Bźi pa snaṅ ba, and citing lemmata from TaRaA, verses 8, 11, and 17 respectively.8 

8 For the sake of clarity, here are the passages: 1) de dag la yaṅ Bźi pa snaṅ ba ñid las | ñid mtshuṅs lha mos ’khyud daṅ źes bya ba la sogs (D, la sogs pa P) tshigs su bcad pa bdun […] citing svābhāṅgaśleṣi; 2) ji ltar Bźi pa snaṅ ba lassku ni nam mkha’ daṅ mtshuṅs źes bya bas […] citing gaganasamaśarīraṃ; 3) da ni Bźi pa snaṅ ba las smos pa’irdo rje źes bya ba’i tshigs su bcad pas […] citing the beginning of the verse discussed above, dambholi°.

As for the next pāda, this is probably where we should find the logical pred icate, but for this we must emend vijñātā to vijñātam. For the first word, the Tibetan seems to suggest vākya° (gtam). No doubt, vāṭya° (“fried barley,” “fig” (?)) seems to be the more difficult reading, but I am not familiar with this idiomatic expression, if indeed it is one. Let us accept the emendations and read vākyamātraṃna vijñātaṃtogetherwith thefirst line, i.e.“not a singleword was understood by the learned one from the Eastern lands, the author of the Caturthāloka [understand: Vāgīśvarakīrti].” 

What exactly Vāgīśvarakīrti did not understand or how exactly it became clear to the Kashmirian author that the Easterner is a fool is a mystery, since the last pāda seems, at least to me, beyond redemption and the Tibetan is not very clear either. One may conjecture with great hesitation after having harmonised the two something like tadgranthato mayodgatam, in the sense “[this] I have understood from his work.” But this would create a metrical issue, since a ra gaṇa is not permitted for syllables 2–4. A more serious intervention would yield tadgranthāt/tadgranthe tan mayodgatam. Another problem is that udgatam is not entirely elegant and does not make very good sense. However, we are prob ably not too far from a genuine solution. What Ratnavajra seems to be saying then is that he had read Vāgīśvarakīrti’s work, the Caturthāloka, and realised that the Eastern scholar is an ignoramus. 

The meaning of unit (f) is somewhat clearer, but it is impossible to say who the speaker is. Somebody—deutero-Advayavajra? Ratnavajra?—states the viewpoint of his guru: the introductory clause asmadīyagurupādamatam āha does not need any correction. The first line of the verse seems to be fine as is, although the meaning is somewhat obscure: turyātītam avācyaṃ tu kṣaṇam ekam arūpakam, i.e. “as for that ineffable [state of consciousness called] ‘beyond the fourth,’ it is a singular, formless moment.” The second line is prob lematic. Pāda c is unmetrical: both the second and the third syllables are short, while the fifth, sixth, and seventh syllables form a ra-gaṇa, thus a ra-vipulā, but there is no caesura after the fourth. Pāda d with the closing particle should probably read jñātājñeyau tu nirvṛtāv iti or jñātṛjñeyau, etc., or jñānajñeyau, etc. The first of the possible solutions, that is to say, leaving the compound as transmitted, contains an irregular dvandva, perhaps inspired by the well known mātāpitṛ-. In spite of these serious irregularities, I have no reason to think that the first half of the line is corrupt, especially since we already had the collocation sahajasaṃbodhikṣaṇaḥ in unit (b). The line therefore proba bly meant, “due to complete awakening of the innate, for me [the duality] of knower [or: knowledge] and objects of knowledge has been extinguished.” Let us attribute the irregularities to the ecstatic power that must have overcome the nebulous guru at the moment of enlightenment. 
 

on vāgīśvarakīrti’s influence 181 

We will now return to Ratnavajra and his scathing attack on Vāgīśvarakīrti. Much light would be thrown on this matter if the Sanskrit original of the *Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa were to become available, or better said, accessible. 

The work is reported to exist in the now famous—and notoriously inac cessible—Lhasa birch-bark manuscript. The existence of this unique codex, once penned in Kashmir and until very recently kept on display at the Tibet Museum, was first reported by Kazuhiro Kawasaki (2004). TheJapanese scholar was allowed to consult the table of contents and the colophon on the last folio of this remarkable document. We know from his report that the manuscript is a composite codex containing twenty-seven works. The sixth item listed in the table of contents (Kawasaki 2004, 51/904) is none other than Caturthasadbhā vopadeśaḥ Śrīratnavajrakṛtaḥ. 

A decade later, Kazuo Kanō (2014) provided a new reading of the colophon and converted the date precisely. According to his calculation, the [Kali] year 29 corresponds to 1057ce, since the ruling king, Anantadeva, is also mentioned, and his reign falls between 1028 and 1063ce (Kanō 2014, 62–63). This date is extremely important, because it gives us a rather early upper limit for the cre ation of the Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa and thus Ratnavajra’s mature activity, besides confirming his reading of Vāgīśvarakīrti’s work. 

Ratnavajra was an authority not to be taken lightly. His influence and fame can be gathered from other sources as well. For example, *Prajñāśrīgupta, in his commentary on the Mahāmudrātilaka, now extant only in Tibetan (Tōh. 1201), eulogises him thus (D 154b3–4): “the great scholar, who has obtained ini tiation and the oral teachings, the king over overlords of kings, the best of gurus, the teacher from Kashmir, the glorious Ratnavajra.” *Prajñāśrīgupta also claims that Ratnavajra stood at the end of an uninterrupted lineage of masters stem ming from the famous Indrabhūti. He also quotes from at least one of his lost works, probably simply called *Utpannakrama (D 155b3–4). In another work, the *Ratnamañjarī (Tōh. 1217), a commentary on the *Tattvapradīpa, he again eulogises Ratnavajra as his master (D 325a2). 

We find several more references to Ratnavajra in the work of *Sambhogava jra, probably *Prajñāśrīgupta’s disciple or junior contemporary. In his *Raha syanalinī (Tōh. 1418), he claims the same spiritual descent, while adding the equally prestigious name of *Avadhūtīpāda along the way. He is only slightly less loquacious when it comes to praising the famous master (D 250b2–3): “he who has crossed to the other shore of all Vedas, who has obtained the accomplishment of the mantra, the Kashmiri master, the glorious Ratnavajra.” *Sambhogavajra quotes the same passage (partially) from the lost *Utpanna krama (D 240b1) and a verse from another work entitled *Adhyātmapadma (D 244b6). He too emphasises that Ratnavajra was a Kashmiri (D 246b5).

Ratnavajra’s name was probably exploited to make other works more pres tigious. One such pseudepigraphical case in my view is an initiation manual of the Sarvabuddhasamāyogaḍākinījālaśaṃvara system, the *Sarvasattvasukho dayā (Tōh. 1679). Contrary to the opinion voiced in the *Caturthasadbhāvo padeśa, this text does teach the Fourth Initiation (D 294a1–4). A less likely scenario is that Ratnavajra eventually changed his mind and accepted what was, to him, initially a controversial abhiṣeka. 

Ratnavajra, too, seems to have been particularly proud of his Kashmiri her itage. In his *Akṣobhyavajrasādhana (Tōh. 1884) he proudly claims to have sat at the feet of Northern gurus (D 162b5), perhaps in yet another attempt to disso ciate himself from innovations in the East.9 This work—which, in spite of the title, is a manual in the tradition of Jñānapāda—is most likely genuinely his, since the qualifications of the practitioner mention having received all initia tions but the Fourth (D 144b1–2). 

Returning to his Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa, here too Ratnavajra voices what is perhaps a challenge to all non-Kashmiris. The third verse of the text says (D 156b3–4): 

| yul phyogs gźan na la la dag | gal te skal ldan gyur pa dṅos | 

| yod pas gter ni mi nub ces | | bdag blo ṅes par dbugs dbyuṅ ṅo | 

The verse is not entirely clear, but it probably means something along the fol lowing lines: 

Should there be any fortunate ones (i.e. worthy Buddhists) in other coun tries, let them [come forward and] put my mind at ease so that [this] treasure would not fall into oblivion. 

The “treasure” (gter, which more correctly would be rin chen) he refers to is in my view the Fourth Initiation, cf. an oft-quoted and later scripturalised pāda from the Prajñopāyaviniścayasiddhi (3.38d): vācaiva dadyād abhiṣekaratnam. Perhaps less likely is the possibility that he uses *ratna as a shorthand for TaRaA, in which case we have here yet another reference to Vāgīśvarakīrti’s work. In my reading, Ratnavajra was being ironic. He would not have found any

on vāgīśvarakīrti’s influence 183 

comfort in his being convinced of the genuineness of the Fourth Initiation. It follows that the “treasure” he seems to be worried about should be read kākvā, in a mocking tone. 

Although Ratnavajra seems to refer to the Caturthāloka/TaRaA exclusively, it is very likely that his reading of Vāgīśvarakīrti was much broader. After all, verse 17 from that work does not reveal much about his position concerning the Fourth Initiation. I think that there is a possibility that this is what he refers to in the verse (D 157b1) immediately following the one we had attested in the Gūḍhapadā: 

| ’on kyaṅ gti mug bsal ba daṅ | | som ñi rab tu źi ba daṅ | 

| phyin ci log ni bsal ba’i phyir | | mkhas pas bstan bcos rgyas par mdzad | 

Now, in order to dispel confusion, to put doubts at ease, and to clear up distortions, [this] learned man expanded his treatise. 

In what follows, Ratnavajra echoes in his pūrvapakṣas many points brought up by the TaRaAVi. If this conjecture holds, it would seem that some time elapsed between Vāgīśvarakīrti’s writing his verses and the auto-commentary. It is also not impossible that the SaA was written partly as an answer to Ratnavajra’s crit icism. However, for all this to be determined one would need access to the San skrit original of the Caturthasadbhāvopadeśa. Until that time, we must leave the matter to rest. 

In spite of the numerous corruptions we have encountered in the Gūḍha padā passage, let us recapitulate what may be gathered with certainty. At some point before 1057ce, an influential Kashmiri master called Ratnavajra or Sūkṣmāvarttabhaṭṭa published a scornful refutation of the idea that there is a Fourth Initiation (caturthābhiṣeka). This position he seems to have attributed first and foremost to “Eastern” scholars, singling out Vāgīśvarakīrti and his Tattvaratnāvaloka or Caturthāloka. In spite of the vitriolic dismissal, it is evi dent that Vāgīśvarakīrti was too important to be ignored. The debate between the two remained well known, as some of its salvos were preserved perhaps already in the now lost Bṛhatkāśmīrapañjikā, and certainly in the Gūḍhapadā. The latter was still an influential work before the end of the 12th century, since the famous Raviśrījñāna used it as a source. 

One could extrapolate a more general point from this debate, namely that scholarly communication between East India (at this point in time under Pāla sovereignty) and Kashmir was vigorous. Kashmiris seem to have been a little more orthodox in their views, but innovations—for which the hotbed was undoubtedly Pāla East India—did filter in. This exchange between the

two regions was certainly not a unique event. The famous satirist Kṣeme ndra describes Bengali students flocking to Kashmir around the same time (Deśopadeśa, chapter 6 in 45 verses). He is even more scornful of Easterners, describing them as illiterate, dim-witted, pretentious, sanctimonious, vulgar, and ugly. I find it very likely that the poet’s bigoted diatribe met with many a sympathetic ear in his local audience. 

3 Vāgīśvarakīrti among the Khmer 

The document known as the Sab Bāk inscription (K. 1158), consisting of fifteen (idiosyncratic) Sanskrit verses and a few lines in Old Khmer, was discovered at an unconfirmed location in what is now Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thai land. It is one of the most important sources testifying to the presence of the Guhyasamāja system in Southeast Asia. The text of the inscription was first edited by Prapanvidya (1990). Since then it has been noted and discussed in a fairly large number of publications, the latest of which, at least to my knowl edge, is by Conti (2014). This article also features a new translation by Tadeusz Skorupski. 

The inscription, dated Śaka year 988, 7th of the waxing fortnight of Tapasya (Friday, 23rd of February 1067ce), records the words of one Vraḥ Dhanus, given the title ācārya in the Khmer portion, a devotee of the Guhyasamāja. The text first eulogises three teachers of Vraḥ Dhanus, all indicated by toponymic sur names: the venerables of Cuṅ Vis, Campaka, and Dharaṇīndrapura. It then describes the erection of an unspecified number of icons beginning with an image of the Buddha. The Khmer portion refers to previous installations as well. 

The document is fascinating and important, but still requires substantial work. I cannot touch on these topics here; instead, I wish to concentrate on a particular aspect, the identity of a master referred to in verses 3 and 4. The most reliable edition of the text is that of Estève (2009, 557–558), which I have checked against an estampage of the original (ÉFEO n. 1497); here I quote only the relevant couplet: 

śrīsamāje parā yasya bhak(t)iḥ śraddhā ca nirmmalā 

tasya dāsasya dāso haṃ bhaveyaṃ sarvajanmasu || [3] 

ity ājñā paramaguroḥ śrutvā stutyā namaskṛtā 

anukathyā mayā bhaktyā śrīsamājan name sadā || [4] 

These are the translations that have been published thus far. Prapanvidya (1990, 12) interpreted the text as follows: 
 

on vāgīśvarakīrti’s influence 185 

In all my births, may I become the slave of that slave, who has great devo tion to and impeccable faith in the Śrīsamāja. ‘Having saluted with praise, I must hear and repeat the teacher’s command devotedly:’ thus is the com mand of the supreme teacher.I constantly pay my obeisance to Śrīsamāja. 

Estève’s French translation is perhaps a bit more accurate (2009, 561): 

«Ce Śrī Samāja pour lequel j’ai une dévotion suprême et une foi pure, que j’en sois le serviteur du serviteur dans toutes mes existences». Après avoir entendu l’ājñā du paramaguru, je dois lui rendre hommage avec des louanges puis, avec dévotion, le répéter. Je rends hommage perpétuelle ment à Śrī Samāja. 

Finally, Skorupski’s translation published in Conti (2014, 393) is quite similar to that of Prapanvidya: 

In all my existences, may I become a servant of the servant who has supreme devotion and stainless faith in the glorious Samāja. Having thus heard the command of the supreme guru, I respect it with praises, (and) having repeated it with devotion, I always pay homage to the glorious Samāja. 

The first hemistich of the quoted portion is in my view an echo of Vāgīśvarakī rti’s words. The penultimate closing verse of his TaRaAVi is this: 

śrīsamāje parā yasya bhaktir niṣṭhā ca nirmalā | 

tasya vāgīśvarasyeyaṃ kṛtir vimatināśinī ||10 

This is the work to dispel all opposed opinions of Vāgīśvara[kīrti], whose dedication to the glorious [Guhya]samāja is supreme and whose devotion is without blemish. 

Moreover, this is the closing verse of his SaA (D 202b7–203a1, P 238b5–6): 

| dpal ldan gsaṅ ba ’dus pa las | | dri med dad mchog mthar phyin pas | | ṅag gi dbaṅ phyug de yis ’di | | byas pas blo ṅan (D, ldan P) ’jig gyur cig 

10 There are two silent emendations by Sarnath editors; the Ms. reads bhaktiniṣṭhā and vimatināsanī. 
 

186 szántó 

I find it almost certain that this is a clumsy Tibetan rendering of the same verse. The small emendation las to la would fix the first pāda, whereas the sec ond would better read *dad mchog mthar phyin dri ma med, were it not the case that mthar phyin pa (*niṣṭhāgata?) is a very bad choice for niṣṭhā. The third and fourth pāda may be seen as a very loose rendering: “may this work written by Vāgīśvarakīrti destroy wicked views!” However, here too the choice of words is inapposite, as we would expect lta and not blo for mati. 

I am unaware of any other texts that would use the same phrasing; it can be said therefore that this is a ‘signature verse’ of Vāgīśvarakīrti. 

The only difference between the hemistich of the Khmer inscription and the verse transmitted in India, Nepal, and Tibet is a mere synonym, śraddhā for niṣṭhā. Perhaps the Khmer author thought that the latter is a lesser-known word for “devotion” and decided to replace it with a metrically and gender-wise unproblematic, more current noun. Otherwise the echo is unmistakable. 

In light of this discovery, the second line of the Khmer inscription would mean that someone is wishing to become a devotee (dāsa) of that devoted one (tasya dāsasya) in all subsequent rebirths—i.e., these are the words of a stu dent of Vāgīśvarakīrti. 

In the first pāda of verse 4, these words seem to be described as “the com mand (ājñā) of the paramaguru.” The syntax here is quite incorrect, since ājñā should also be construed with śrutvā, and we would therefore require an accusative; however, namaskṛtā and anukathyā forces the author to leave it in the nominative. This is not the only bizarre usage of Sanskrit in the text. To note only the most glaring examples, in verse 6 we have a double sandhi, saiva for sa eva, in verse 15 the enclitic cet stands at the beginning of the line, and so on. Another oddity is that such pious exclamations are not called ājñā, but praṇidhāna or praṇidhi, even in the tantric context (e.g. Hevajratantra 2.8.6–7 and prose before). 

It should also be noted that the first quarter of verse 4 is a na-vipulā, with the minor blemish that the fourth syllable is not long. This perhaps suggests that the composer found it important to include the term paramaguru. This does not only mean “supreme teacher,” but has a more technical sense, namely one’s spiritual grandfather, i.e. one’s guru’s guru. I could not find Buddhist texts that clearly have this usage (a possible exception is the Balinese Buddhaveda, p. 75); however, it is prevalent in Śaiva literature.In Abhinavagupta’s Tantrasāra (Ed., p.156) wefind the sequence guru, paramaguru, and parameṣṭhin,followed by the collective pūrvācāryāḥ. In the glosses to the Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati (Ed., vol. 3, ad 13.58ab) we find this list stretched for five generations: guru, paramaguru, parameṣṭhiguru, pūjyaguru, and mahāpūjyaguru. We sometimes (e.g. Puraścaryārṇava, Ed., vol. 1, 3.578cd-579ab) find parāparaguru between parama and parameṣṭhin. 
 

Keeping in mind the hypothesis that paramaguru has a technical meaning here and does not simply mean “supreme teacher,” two further likely hypothe ses emerge. The command, which Vraḥ Dhanus relates, is spoken by one of his teachers, namely his guru’s guru, in which case Vāgīśvarakīrti was the guru of this person, that is to say, Vraḥ Dhanus’parameṣṭhiguru or parāparaguru. How ever, given the loose phrasing seen elsewhere in the document, it might just be the case that Vraḥ Dhanus is referring only to the first half of the verse, in which case he is acknowledging Vāgīśvarakīrti as his paramaguru. The latter is gram matically speaking less likely, but more likely if we think about the number of spiritual generations elapsed between Vāgīśvarakīrti, active in the earlier half of the 11th century, and Vraḥ Dhanus, whose commissioned inscription is dated 1067ce. Whichever scenario we accept as the most plausible, what seems to be certain is that by this date Vāgīśvarakīrti’s person and Guhyasamāja-related teachings were known in the Khmer lands. 

If Vāgīśvarakīrti was known in the Khmer lands, then so was Jñānapāda’s school of thought. Although more attention should be dedicated to this mat ter, I feel confident in saying that Vāgīśvarakīrti was a follower of the Jñānapāda exegesis. The strongest evidence for this claim is his brief overview of Jñāna pāda’s Samantabhadra or Caturaṅgasādhana as well as at least one unattrib uted quotation from the same work in his SaA (D 202a2ff., P 238a1ff.). 

4 Epilogue 

During the editorial process, I came across two further possible testimonies for Vāgīśvarakīrti’s influence.I am grateful to the editorsfor allowing me the oppor tunity to include them here. 

The first comes from what is now Burma/Myanmar, an inscription dated 1442ce celebrating the construction of a monastery and related donations by a district governor called Thirizeyathu (Taw Sein Ko 1899, 37–47). The document records a large number of books as part of the governor’s generous gift, includ ing the famous couple Mahākālacakka and Mahākālacakka ṭīkā, long accepted as evidence for the presence of the Kālacakra system in Burma. The work listed immediately before this (p. 47) is called the Mṛtyuvañcana. While this could refer to any death-cheating ritual manual, the most celebrated such work was that of Vāgīśvarakīrti. There is therefore a strong possibility that he was still read in Burma as late as the first half of the 15th century. Naturally, I do not claim this as conclusive evidence. 

Another possible allusion to Vāgīśvarakīrti, or at the very least the debate he was famous for, comes from certain recensions of Saraha’s Dohākośa. In a 
 

188 szántó 

verse criticising fellow Buddhists, the famous siddha (or the author posing as the siddha) says that “[without having realised reality,] some are immersed in explaining the Fourth.” 

I read the verse in the following three sources: a) Niedersächsische Staats und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen manuscript Xc 14/16, folio 2r: ko vi vak khāṇa caüṭṭhihi laggo; b) Tokyo University Library manuscript 517, folio 17v: ke vi vakkhāṇa caüṭṭhahiṃ laggaü; and c) NAK 1–1607 = NGMPP A 49/18, recto of 83rd leaf: koï vakkhaṇa caüṭhṭhihi laggo. The verse with this line was not avail able for Śāstrī (1916, 85), Shahidullah (1928, 129—although the Tibetan given here does mirror our reading very closely: kha cig bźi ba’i don ’chad pa la źugs) or Sāṃkṛtyāyan (1957, 4); Bagchi (1938, 16) reconstructs the verse, and his read ing is followed by Jackson (2004, 58), who also suggests that one possibility for interpretation is the “Fourth Initiation”; see also Schaeffer 2005, 136. 

The single-folio NAK fragment is a part of the Sahajāmnāyapañjikā commen tary, a very precious (and unfortunately very corrupt) witness, as here Bagchi’s manuscript has a lacuna. The relevant passage in Tibetan can be found in D 184r7–185v2. Interestingly, here the target is identified as a monk, but caü ṭhṭhihi is glossed either as a cardinal number, in which case the four schools are meant (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, Madhyamaka), or as an ordinal number, in which case the meaning is innate bliss (sahaja). This commentator would therefore not think that the object of the (fruitless) explanation is the Fourth Initiation. 

It is of course possible, and perhaps even likely, that Saraha here refers to the fourth and ultimate state of consciousness or the fourth and highest bliss (ānanda), but it is not out of the question that what he has in mind is the (or a) debate regarding the FourthInitiation. However, again, this is hardly conclusive evidence.

### 8 Reflections on the King of Ascetics (Yatirāja): Rāmānuja in the Devotional Poetry of Vedānta Deśika 

Srilata Raman 

The ocean of Śrīvaiṣṇava literature is vast and it is a humbling scholarly endeav or to realize that the more one works on it, the more there is to discover; thus, any conclusions that one reaches on the intellectual history of the tradition can only be tentative postulations which can and must be superseded by further research.1 This being said, it has become increasingly clear that we are see ing a particularly fertile period between Rāmānuja (traditional dates: CE1017– 1137CE) and Vedānta Deśika (traditional dates: CE1268–1369CE): a period when doctrinal ideas are emerging from a wide spectrum of genres—from devotional poetry and hagiographies to commentaries and kāvya literature. We see also that, for instance, when it comes to the issue of the salvational means—the upāya for mokṣa—and their definitions, there was in fact much variation and a spectrum of views, without one single overarching version. Thus, to take one example, even within what emerged as a consensus on the significance of pra patti as the more appropriate upāya for the Kali Yuga, as opposed to bhakti, matters were by no means settled in the immediate post-Rāmānuja period as to how to understand the qualifications (aṅgas) for prapatti, or who was qual ified for it.2 

1 In this essay, the transliteration of maṇipravāḷa passages is uneven in that I have adhered to the exact wording in the respective printed books, which is often not systematic, sometimes giving the devanāgarī letters and sometimes not. All translations are my own. 

2 This has been suggested in the tradition particularly of the writings of Meghanādārisūri, a senior contemporary of Vedānta Deśika. Raghavan (1979), in his survey of Viśiṣṭādvaitic liter ature post-Rāmānuja, suggests that the principal work of Meghanādārisūri on prapatti, called the Mumukṣūpāyasaṃgraha, is currently lost. I have been able to acquire a copy of a single printed Telugu manuscript with this title which, in the Upodghātaḥ section, points to at least one view of the author, cited as Meghanādārisūri, which is dramatically different from both the mainstream Vaṭakalai and Teṅkalai ācāryas on prapatti. The relevant sentence is: asmin granthe dvitryaṃśavyatirikteṣu bahvaṃśeṣu śrīmadvedāntācaryapakṣīyair upādeyārthā eva pratipāditā iti bhāti. taditareṣv artheṣv ayam anyatamaḥ sāmānyaviśeṣalakṣaṇalakṣitapra pattijñāne tadarthānuṣṭhāne ca traivarṇikānām evādhikāraḥ na śūdrasya iti. śrīmadvedān tācāryapraṇīteṣu grantheṣu sapramāṇaṃ prapatteḥ sarvādhikāratā yā samarthitā sā tatraiva

reflections on the king of ascetics (yatirāja) 195 

With the wisdom of hindsight, therefore, one could say that it is not at all surprising that a tradition that grappled with such wide divergences would find some of them encapsulated and formalized in the Teṅkalai and Vaṭakalai aṣṭādaśabhedas by as late as the eighteenth century. The perception of Rāmā nuja, as well as ideas regarding his role in the salvation of his community, correspondingly, also change with the other doctrinal divergences that emerge in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition after him. This topic forms the core of this paper. 

Here, I hope to show that there are many points of convergence in the hagiographical understanding of Rāmānuja between what consolidated into the later Vaṭakalai and Teṅkalai ācārya stotra traditions. The primary texts of comparison here are the Irāmāṉuja Nūṟṟantāti (henceforth, IN) of Tiru varaṅkattamutaṉār, one of the earliest hagiographical/stotra works we have at hand on Rāmānuja (see the next section for some tentative dating), and Vedānta Deśika’s Yatirājasaptati (henceforth, YS). The paper suggests that we do not see any major doctrinal divergence between the views of Vedānta Deśika and those expressed by Tiruvaraṅkattamutaṉār. What we are therefore seeing is a consolidated viewpoint regarding Rāmānuja’s stature in the tradi tion as a whole, which remains unchanged through the centuries. Further, I would suggest that both these works see Rāmānuja not simply as any other ācārya of the tradition, but unique in his special role as being central to the salvation of every Śrīvaiṣṇava. Nevertheless, there are definite variations of emphasis and hence of doctrinal inflection that can be traced and these, in turn, the paper suggests, feed into eventual soteriological differences in sig nificant ways. Exploring these subtle inflections is also the purpose of this paper. 

The paper begins with a brief examination of the motifs regarding Rāmānuja in the IN, contextualizing the poem within the history of earlier devotional poetry addressed to the ācārya within the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. It then pro ceeds to consider two of the main motifs of the poem relating to Rāmānuja’s divinity before turning to the YS of Vedānta Deśika. It then discusses the dif 

draṣṭavyā. (“In this work, other than with regard to two or three sections, in many sections, only the meanings established by those who adhere to Vedānta Deśika’s position have, it seems, been proven. In the case of meanings that differ, there is this one—that, with regard to the knowledge of prapatti characterized by general and special features, as well as in the accomplishment of the meaning of it, only those of the three varṇas are qualified, not the śūdra. In the texts authored by Vedānta Deśika the establishment of [the position that] all are qualified for prapatti, together with authoritative proofs, can be seen there [within those texts themselves].”)I am currently in the process of having this text transcribed and will begin a study to determine whether something definitive can be said about its authorship.

ference in emphases of the two poems and concludes with some historical observations about what this might mean for Teṅkalai and Vaṭakalai soterio logical doctrine, post-Rāmānuja. 

1 Amutaṉār’s Pirapantam on Rāmānuja 

The Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiographical tradition places the author of the IN, Tiruvara ṅkattamutaṉār or Amutaṉār, as he is also referred to, within Rāmānuja’s own lifetime. In the hagiography, the Splendour of the Previous Ācāryas (Pūrvācārya Vaibhavam), Prativāti Payaṅkaram Aṇṇaṅkarācāriyār (1955) states that he was either the father or the grandfather of Piḷḷai Perumāḷ Aiyaṅkār, the author of the Aṣṭaprabandham, who was a disciple of Parāśara Bhaṭṭar. Since Bhaṭṭar is traditionally considered to date to the twelfth century, this would place Amu taṉār within Rāmānuja’s own traditional dates of 1017–1137CE. This is further consolidated by details given in the hagiography of Amutaṉār. In it, Amutaṉār is introduced as a recalcitrant employee of the Śrīraṅgam temple (kōyil kottil uḷḷavar) who first resists but later accepts Rāmānuja’s chief disciple Kūrattāḻ vāṉ as his own teacher and, rewarded for this by being made the administrative head of the temple (srīkāryam) by Rāmānuja, subsequently also composes the IN.3 

The IN is an extensive poem of 108 verses composed in the kalittuṟai viruttam metre.In terms of its poetic type it falls within the“super-genre” called pirapan tam. Zvelebil (1974, 193) has pointed out that the great variety of poetic forms that fall within this category have only this much in common: “the character of a connected narrative with strong elements of description.” Traditionally, pirapantams were listed as thirty-six in number but by the eighteenth century, when Beschi wrote his Caturakarāti, the number had increased to ninety-six.4 The IN faithfully follows the logic of the genre of Nuṟṟantāti, being a poem of technically one hundred verses (here we actually have eight, auspicious addi tional verses), in veṇpā and kallituṟai metres in an antāti arrangement, where the last syllable or word of the preceding stanza is identical with the first syl

A further Tamil work attributed to Amu taṉār is the Tiruppatikkōvai, a poem in Tamil of 40 verses in the kōvai genre of pirapantam literature that is considered to list the 108 sacred places of the Śrīvaiṣṇavas. 

4 In effect the pirapantam emerged as the most prolific genre of poetic composition in pre modern Tamil literature, outdoing the tanippāṭal, bhakti poetry and epic/narrative forms. On this see Zvelebil 1974, 194. 
 

lable or word of the succeeding one. It models itself consciously on the poetry of the āḻvars, on the Tiviyappirapaṉtam, and its very specific model is the small work attributed to Maturakavi āḻvār, the “Knotted, Fine, Small Rope” (Kaṇṇinuṉ ciṟuttāmpu), since the latter is the first work of the Tiviyappirapaṉtam where the ācārya himself, rather than Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, becomes the object of vener ation and worship.5 Hence, the Kaṇṇinuṉciṟuttāmpu functions as a precursor to all subsequent hagiographical stotras on the ācāryas of the tradition. The opening verse of this very short poem of ten verses is: 

Sweet it will be, my tongue will fill with nectar 

in saying, “Nampi of South Kurukūr” 

after nearing him through my Lord,6 

the Great Māyaṉ, who allowed himself to be tied 

by the knotted, fine, small rope.7 

The verse sets the tone for the entire poem, where the poet seeks out Nammāḻ vār, implicitly seen as the focus of direct devotion rather than Māyōṉ/Kṛṣṇa. In his introduction (avatārikai) to the text, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai (an older contem porary of Vedānta Deśika traditionally dated to the mid-thirteenth century) makes it clear that Maturakavi takes refuge with Nammāḻvār himself as the person who can most help him when it comes to reaching God, as the person who can bring about the experience of the Blessed One for him (bhagavadanu bhavasahakārī) and who, due to helping him in various ways, is himself the object to be aimed at (uddeśya).8 There are three motifs in the poem: first, that Nammāḻvār himself is the direct object of refuge; second, that he has rid the

6 The commentators interpret the words “eṉṉappaṉil naṇṇi” in two different ways. They either take the “il” to be a negative suffix, thereby suggesting that the poet moves away from Māyaṉ towards Nammāḻvār, or they take it as an ablative suffix, thereby suggesting that he approaches Nammāḻvār through or via God.

poet of his bad karma/sins, and finally, that he has rendered the Vedas into Tamil. As we proceed to look at the IN we will see that these three motifs as well as the religious assumptions and the contents of the Kaṇṇinuṉciṟuttāmpu both permeate and influence the poem. 

The IN itself came to occupy a special place within quotidian Śrīvaiṣṇava religiosity. Its significance can be gauged from the fact that, though it is not composed by the āḻvārs, it is one of the few anomalous works to be included within the corpus of the Tiviyappirapantam itself, as part of the concluding section of the Iyaṟpā,9 and hence also a part of the daily cycle of prayers— the nityānusaṃdhānam—for all Śrīvaiṣṇavas, both Teṅkalai and Vaṭakalai. A further name attributed to it, and included in Amutaṉār’s traditional hagiogra phy, is Prapannagāyatrī—in other words, that like the Gayatrī mantra recited by the twice-born male during the daily morning and evening prayers (saṃ dhyāvandanam), the IN must also be a part of the daily prayer rituals of the one who has undertaken prapatti (prapanna).10 The hagiography of Amutaṉār points out that the decision to include the IN within the Iyaṟpā as well as the decision to make it part of the daily prayer cycle of Śrīvaiṣṇavas was taken by Uṭayavar (Rāmānuja) himself, as recorded in the chronicles of the Śrīraṅgam temple (Kōyil Oḻuku).11 

In this brief consideration of this poem, with its verses of simple and elegant beauty, I begin with two examples which show its debt both to the Tiviyappira pantam and to the stotra tradition of the ācāryas generally. In the first example, towards the latter part of the poem, we have the following verse (76) where there is the piling up of examples of all that which is precious and delectable, culminating in the assertion that only Rāmānuja can offer the devotee that which is most precious, which are his feet: 

O Rāmānuja! 

Enduring fame, expansive waters, 

splendid Vēṅkaṭam with its golden summit, 

9 The Tiviyappirapantam is traditionally divided into four books of which the Iyaṟpā, mean ing,“short metres,” forms the third book. For a detailed discussion of the possible rationale of the arrangement of the poetry into this four-fold division and their internal contents, see Hardy 1983, 247–256.

the land of Vaikuṇṭha, the celebrated Milk Ocean— 

How much pleasure all these give you! 

That much pleasure your lotus feet also give me. 

Then, grant them, graciously.12 

Not only does this verse immediately echo for us the opening line of Nam māḻvār’s verse 68 of the Periyatiruvantāti, which begins, “mountains, the grove ringed Ocean and the heavenly kingdom of Vaikuṇṭha” (kallum kaṉaikkaṭalum vaikunta vā nāṭum), but even while echoing the prior poem it is doing some thing entirely novel. In Nammāḻvār’s verse the poet is talking about how Kṛṣṇa, the dark God, has entered his heart and will not be dislodged from it. Hence, all God’s usual habitations—the sacred mountain, the Cosmic Ocean and even Vaikuṇṭha itself appear abandoned. Here, in the IN, Amutaṉār seems to suggest that these places where Kṛṣṇa normally dwells are the very same places which are within Rāmānuja’s reach—and give him pleasure. For him, in contrast, he would gladly forsake all these for Rāmānuja’s feet. 

Verse 92 of the IN turns to another ubiquitous theme in Śrīvaiṣṇava prap atti stotras: the unworthiness of the person seeking refuge. Here, in the first two lines Amutaṉār says, “I have not done the virtuous vows” (puṇṇiyanōṉpu purintum ilēṉ), and “I have not spoken the subtle, rare and sacred words” (nuṇaruḷkēḷvi nuvaṉṟum ilēṉ). These lines resonate for us with the words of another verse of Nammāḻvār’s: Tiruvāymoḻi 7.5.1 (nōṟṟanōṉp illēṉ, nuṇṇaṟiv ilēṉ). We are further reminded of the poetry of another ācārya whose Sanskrit work was also heavily influenced by the Tiviyappirapantam—Āḷavantār’s Sto traratna, verse 22: na dharmaniṣṭho’ smina cātmavedī,na bhaktimāṃstvaccara ṇāravinde. 

The IN thus consciously positions itself within this lineage of devotional poetry—showing us that it continues and builds upon doctrinal views regard ing God and the ācārya, who are seen as mirror images of each other, just as the poetry of each previous ācārya becomes a template available for embedding, as a literary echo, within the work of a successor.Indeed, the Kaṇṇinuṉciṟuttāmpu itself becomes a direct source of further emulation in the Maṇavāḷamāmuṉikaḷ Kaṇṇiṇuṉciṟuttāmpu—a 13-verse poem (circa fourteenth-century) by the lat

ter’s disciple Kōyil Kantāṭai Aṇṇaṉ, which centres on Maṇavāḷamāmuṉi’s feet as a refuge because he, in turn, had taken refuge with Nammāḻvār. This brings me to one of the main motifs that appears again and again in the poem: the indirect identification of Rāmānuja with Māyōn/Māyavaṉ/Kaṇṇaṉ as the dark cloud who brings cool rain and alleviates suffering. 

In this regard a few examples from the poem should suffice: “the dark cloud that is Rāmānuja” (irāmānucaṉ eṉṉum kār), in verse 24; in verse 25, “O Rāmānuja, benevolent as a dark cloud” (kārēy karuṇai irāmāṉucā ); verse 27 speaks of Rāmānuja as that capacious rain cloud that enters the heart of the poet; verses 55 and 60 use the word koṇṭal for rain cloud, where Rāmānuja is likened to a cloud pouring out the rain of the Vedas (55), or a rain cloud endowed with good qualities (60); and verse 83 speaks of his generosity being like a dark rain cloud (kār koṇṭa vaṇmai), as does verse 104, likening him to a bountiful rain cloud (ceḻuṅkoṇṭal). Finally, verses 74 and 104 even suggest, through a kind of poetic hyperbole similar to that which will surface later in the Ācāryahṛdayam of Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷapperumāḷ Nāyaṉār,13 that Rāmānuja, the dark cloud who convinces everyone through cool reason, might even be more effective than Māyavaṉ with his fiery discus—or that even if one were shown Kaṇṇaṉ like a gooseberry in the palm of one’s hand, one would want nothing other than Rāmānuja’s greatness (cīr).14 

13 The reference here is to Ācāryahṛdayam, sūtras 56ff., where theTiviyappirapantamis com pared to a golden vessel and the Vedas to an earthen vessel. 

14 IN, verse 74:

reflections on the king of ascetics (yatirāja) 201 

These multiple references to Rāmānuja as a dark, bountiful, compassionate and cooling rain cloud cannot but take us back again to the Tiviyappirapantam and, even prior to it, to the early history of Kṛṣṇa worship in the Tamil coun try. As Hardy in his magnum opus Viraha Bhakti has convincingly shown (1983, 149ff.), the earliest references to the God Māyōṉ come to us from specific verses in the Puṟanāṉūru and Pattuppāṭṭu. The word itself, meaning “the dark com plexioned one,” clearly is the Tamil equivalent of Kṛṣṇa and the references from the earliest poetry are to his dark colour, which is compared to the ocean. Hardy masterfully traces the images of Māyōṉ from these early references through the late Caṅkam poetry into the use of the akattiṉai by the āḻvārs. The IN clearly situates itself with this lineage of poetic images and plays with the image of Rāmānuja as both Māyōṉ, as better than Māyōṉ, or in a crucial verse I shall come to later, as the incarnation of the weapons of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. There is no doubt that this invocation of Rāmānuja as Kṛṣṇa is meant to set the stage for the second ubiquitous motif in the poem—that Rāmānuja has cleansed the poet of his sins by giving him his feet as a refuge. 

2 Rāmānuja as Saviour from Sin and Granter of the Ultimate Goal 

As mentioned previously, the motif of the ācārya saving the disciple appears in the Kaṇṇinuṉciṟuttāmpu already. The relevant verse is number 7, where Mat urakavi āḻvār says Nammāḻvār removed and destroyed his ancient, bad deeds (paṇṭaivalviṉai pāṟṟiy aruḷiṉān). It is this very claim that the IN makes with regard to Rāmānuja. Let me give a few salient examples for this motif in the poem: verse 4 states that Rāmānuja destroys karma, as in the lines, “After mak ing me a substantive thing in this world, he [Rāmānuja] first cut at the root, age old karma that secreted illusion …” (eṉṉaip puviyil oru poruḷākki maruḷ curanta muṉṉaippaḻaviṉai vēr aṟuttu); verse 7 refers to Rāmānuja as he who enables the poet to cross over sin (paḻiyaik kaṭattum irāmāṉucaṉ); in verse 26 the poet reiterates that Rāmānuja has removed his true defects that are in the form of his terrible sins/karma (eṉ cey viṉaiyām meyykuṟṟam nīkki); in verse 35 the poet asks howkarma could ever shroud him after he has in his memory the lotus feet of Rāmānuja (aruviṉai eṉṉai evvāṟ iṉṟiy aṭarppatuvē); verse 41 plays upon the idea of the accessibility of Rāmānuja by pointing out that even when Mādhava 

I do not want. 

Even if cast into the affliction of Hell, 

or reach the Heaven of light, 

this grace done by you sustains me.

is born on earth within each body, as the Inner Dweller, those who not recog nize him are able to become his devotees when Rāmānuja incarnates and gives them true knowledge; in verse 45 the poet emphatically declares that there is no other greater desired object than Rāmānuja’s feet, and that no one can make them attainable except the feet themselves (pēṟ oṉṟu maṟṟ illai niṉ caraṇ aṉṟi, appēṟ aḷittaṟk āṟeṉṟum illai maṟṟaic caraṇ aṉṟi), etc. In verse 66 the poet sets up an analogy that both compares and distinguishes between the generosity of God and Rāmānuja. Mādhava, he says, gives the supreme abode (vāṉam) to those who pine (naipavar) for him. But this same goal also becomes available to those who have committed grave sins, because these have been removed by Rāmānuja from their hearts (valviṉaiyēṉ maṉattil īṉam kaṭinta irāmānucaṉ). These verses build up to a crescendo in verses 71 (“my previous karma was removed due to your gracious conduct,” muṉ cey viṉai nī cey viṉayataṉāl pōn tatu) and 77 (“he burnt out my sins at their roots,”eṉ viṉaikaḷai vēr paṟiyak kāyn tanaṉ). In verse 94 the poet emphasizes the assurance that Rāmānuja grants right conduct, the wealth of service to God, and the ability to execute this. 

In a brief digression it must be added that we cannot fully understand the theological developments on the Teṅkalai side, or the Tamil stotra tradition on the āḻvārs and ācāryas in particular, without seeing very similar parallel developments on the Tamil Śaiva side. We are speaking of a shared religious and, most importantly, poetic landscape here where there was mutual influ ence and emulation. Hagiographical pirapantams were composed on the lead ing religious figures of both traditions. Thus, the Irupā Irupaḵtu, attributed to Aruḷnaṉti Śivācāriyar (traditional dates: thirteenth century), who is considered one of the foremost disciples of Meykaṇṭar whose work Civañāṉapōtam (Śiva jñānabodham) inaugurates the Tamil Śaiva Siddhānta canon, is a pirapantam poem of 12 verses whose resemblance to the IN is striking. The Irupā Irupaḵtu equates Meykaṇṭār with Śiva himself, his greatness as a guru being such that he can rid devotees of primal impurity (mala). Such parallels between poetic traditions must also be kept in mind when reflecting on the hagiographical traditions linked to Tamil devotional poetry, considered across the sectarian divides. 

Careful reading of the poem shows that IN sets up a series of analogies: between Kaṇṇaṉ/Māyōṉ and Rāmānuja, and between the salvation promised by Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavadgītā 18.66, the Caramaśloka, according to which taking refuge with him would remove all sins of the devotee, and the descent of Rāmānuja in the Kali Yuga, which removes the sins of the poet. This analogy is by no means the only one and I do not wish, hereby, to simplify the poem, reducing it to this doctrinal message. Indeed, in other verses the poem suggests that taking refuge at the feet of the devotees of Rāmānuja is equally important, 
 

reflections on the king of ascetics (yatirāja) 203 

or that Rāmānuja is not so much Māyōṉ as the incarnation of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa’s weapons. But there is no doubt that many of its verses suggest that Rāmānuja is connected with the promise of the Caramaśloka; and it is this motif, with the direct analogies it draws between Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva, on the one hand, and Rāmānuja, on other, that is central to the hagiographical impulse of the poem. 

But before I expand on what this means for the representation of Rāmānuja from the earliest hagiographical tradition on him, I would like to focus our attention on Vedānta Deśika’s 70 verses on the King of Ascetics, the Yatirājasap tati, to see how it might converge or diverge in its representation of Rāmānuja. 

3 The Yatirājasaptati 

The YS is a poem of remarkable lyrical beauty consisting of a total of 74 verses. Of a very different aesthetic feel than the IN, the poem begins with ten verses on the guruparamparā, where the poet salutes his lineage of teachers, beginning with Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa and concluding with Rāmānuja. It is carefully structured to hold in a dialectical unity the greatness of Rāmānuja, his divine incarnation, on the one hand, and the greatness of his works and his achievements, on the other. The poem moves in circles, again and again, around these two themes, with the additional theme of the greatness of his devotees inserted in some of these circular reflections. Vedānta Deśika tells us, at the very end of the poem why he has composed it (verse 73):

May the Yatirājasaptati, the lamp that aids the Upaniṣads by which the distortions that are wrong views are extinguished, give us the knowledge that encompasses both the vibhūtis of the Blessed One. 

Thus in this verse, which is a phala-śruti, Vedānta Deśika makes it clear that the poem is as much about Rāmānuja’s feat in composing the Śrībhāṣya, thereby giving the right interpretation of the Upaniṣads, as it is about the greatness of Yatirāja himself. Indeed, Vedānta Deśika makes it clear that Rāmānuja’s great ness lies in his composition of the work on Vedānta. 

The poem’s first ten verses create the context for the exaltation of Rāmānuja. This context is the lineage of teachers (guruparaṃparā) who preceded him and are listed in the first eight verses of the poem in the following order: Nārāyaṇa, Śrī-Lakṣmī, Viṣvaksena, Nammāḻvār, Puṇḍarīkākṣa (Uyyaṅkoṇṭār), 
 

204 raman 

Śrīrāmamiśra (Maṇakkāl Nampi), Yāmuna (Āḷavantār) and Mahāpūrṇa (Periya Nampi). In verse 11 Rāmānuja is addressed, for the first time, with the phrase “Lord of the Ascetics” (patiṃ yatīnām). 

It is relevant that this is not the first time in the hagiographical literature that this epithet is used for him. Instead, as the modern commentator of the YS Vātūla Nīlameghācārya points out, the word is already used for him, as the title bestowed upon him by Lord Varadarāja at Kāñcīpuram when he took the vows of an ascetic, according to the hagiographical literature composed contempo raneous to the poem. Here the commentator references the Yatirājabhairavam, composed by Rāmānuja’s immediate disciple Āndhra Pūrṇa (Vaṭuka Nampi) probably around the same time as the IN, where this episode is narrated.15 

When we come to the poem’s understanding of the divinity of Rāmānuja we find a wide spectrum of meanings. In verse 12, which agrees with verse 33 of the IN, Rāmānuja is seen as the coming together of all the five weapons of Murāri (apṛthakpratipanna yanmayatvaiḥ vavṛdhe pañcabhir āyudhair murāreḥ, 12cd). In the very next verse, 13, there is a playful simultaneous narration or śleṣa on the victorious activities of both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rāmānuja, where the meanings converge in the word Rāmāvarajaḥ, referring both to Yatirāja as well as Kṛṣṇa himself as the younger brother of Balarāma, thus establish ing identity between the two figures. Verse 27 lauds Rāmānuja as the aggre gation of the threefold splendour (saṃvalita-tridhāman) of Agni (śikhāvān), the moon (auṣadhīśaḥ) and the sun (tāpanaḥ). In verse 32 Rāmānuja is seen as having the same capacity to offer protection to the world as Viṣvaksena, with the latter’s cane staff transformed into his ascetic’s rod.16 Verse 28 is par ticularly eloquent in describing and encapsulating all his nurturing and pro tecting qualities, which are compared to those present everywhere in nature itself—as the mountain from which originate all the streams of knowledge (sakalavidyāvāhinījanmaśailaḥ), the tree under which the weary traveller wan dering in saṃsāra takes rest ( janipathaparivṛttiśrāntaviśrāntiśākhī), the ris

The use of the epithet Yatirāja was not the preroga tive only of the Śrīvaiṣṇavas but of the hagiographical traditions of other sectarian groups as well, seeking to exult their ascetic religious founders, as for instance the Madhvas of Vyāsatīrtha. On this see Stoker 2016.

ing sun that keeps the illusionary darkness of those with distorted views at bay (nikhilakumatimāyāśarvarībālasūryaḥ) and the full moon that brings to high tide the ocean of the Vedas (nigamajaladhivelāpūrṇacandraḥ). Finally, in verse 63 Rāmānuja is Viṣṇu himself in his form (mūrtiḥ) as Dattātreya, with his yellow-ochre robes (pītavasanaḥ) and protective ascetic rod.17 

When we consider the range of figures that Rāmānuja is identified with in the YS we see that they converge overwhelmingly, with some exceptions, on Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. Thus, the references to him as Agni, the sun and the moon, as the yellow-robed ascetic God, and then, secondarily, as Viṣvaksena or the col lective of the weapons of Viṣṇu, all draw upon images that have a long geneal ogy in Vedic, epic and Purāṇic literature on Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. If the YS echoes other Vaiṣṇavite devotional poetry at all, in addition to the Tiviyappirapantam, we would do well to consider the images of Viṣṇu presented in the Paripāṭal, in the context of the overall Vedicism of the early poetic work.18 Thus, despite the commonality between the IN and the YS in stressing Rāmānuja’s divinity, his being elevated to a level above that of the other ācāryas, we see a subtle differentiation in the manner in which the IN foregrounds the significance of the Bhagavadgītā in contrast to the Vedic, epic and Purānic representations of Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa in the YS. This difference in inflection can also be understood if we consider the overwhelming importance that the YS attributes to Rāmānuja’s establishment of the “right” kind of Vedānta.

kāṣāyeṇa gṛhītapītavasanā daṇḍais tribhir maṇḍitā

18 On this see Raman 2011, 661–662: “A brief comparison of the Tirumāl motifs of the Pari pāṭal with those relating to Viṣṇu in the Vedic and immediate post-Vedic Brāhmaṇa and epic literature shows how thoroughly vedicized the Vaiṣṇavism of the text is. It would not be unreasonable to speculate that this Vaiṣṇavism of the Paripāṭal may be drawn from Sanskrit textual sources: the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas, the Mahābhārata (particularly the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Śāntiparvan) and the Viṣṇupurāṇa. Here, one should draw attention to the following motifs which already appear in these sources: […] the general description of Tirumāl clad in yellow garments, with the Goddess and the jewel Kaus tubha on his chest and, finally and, most importantly, the identification of Tirumāl with elements of the Vedic sacrifice in Paripāṭal 2.61–64. … There is also the repeated insistence in the text that our only true source of knowledge for Tirumāl’s appearance, his deeds, his prowess and his divine grace are the Vedas (called, variously, maṟai, mutumoḻi and vāy moḻi), guarded and transmitted by the Brahmins (antaṇar).” 
 

206 raman 4 The Eyes of the Vedas: Rāmānuja’s Vedānta19 

There are allusions to Rāmānuja’s “protection” of the Vedas, his defeat of those who hold other Vedāntic views as well as the significance of his establishment of the right interpretation of the Vedas in innumerable verses of the YS. Thus, Rāmānuja’s words are a firmly established cage of logic to prevent the wan derings that are the Vedas (v. 14) and they also draw in the texts that are the Vedānta (v. 26).20 They cause those who have touched the bed of the Ocean that is the rules of the Vedānta to rejoice, and have them establish the state of salvation.21 Rāmānuja, the poem states, is the tridaṇḍa-bearing ascetic who sits at the base of the tree of the Vedas, removing the fear of deceitful people from the minds of people (v. 22).22 Verse 31 captures in a lovely set of images the nature of Rāmānuja’s works. They are wish-fulfilling trees for the imagination of debaters (kathakajanamanīṣā-kalpanākalpavṛkṣāḥ), oozing with the nectar of Hari’s feet (haripadamakarandasyandinaḥ), possessing many branches (anu gatabahuśākhāḥ) so that they can remove suffering/heat (āpam unmūlayanti), and subduing (with their perfume) the stench of sins (śamitaduritagandhāḥ). 

The repeated reference to the Vedic basis of Rāmānuja’s teachings is stressed in several further phrases in verses 44, 47, 50, etc. In verse 57 Vedānta Deśika interestingly historicizes the tradition, accepting that even if Rāmānuja’s doc trine (mata) is new (navīnaṃ) and others might have come before (prāk), this does not matter. For Rāmānuja is within the lineage of those ancient commen tators such as Ṭaṅka, Dramiḍa and Guhadeva, who were fearless (nirātaṅkāḥ) because of their unobscured vision (nijamatitiraskāravigamāt). This view of Rāmānuja’s central role in the establishment of a new, Viśiṣṭādvaita Vedānta is the second central motif in the poem. Thus, even while we also have verses in the poem that, like in the IN, echo the sentiments of taking refuge at the feet of Rāmānuja, such as verses Verse 18, where those who take refuge at the feet of Yatipati become free of sin (anaghā) or Verse 20, where the feet are a

refuge compared to medicine that stills the fluctuations of the mind (calacit tavṛttivinivartanauṣadhaṃ śaraṇaṃ yatīndracaraṇaṃ vṛṇīmahe), it becomes clear that the framework of the poem does not allow for a predominant focus on the analogy between Rāmānuja and Kṛṣṇa nor that his feet themselves are the predominant upāya for mokṣa. 

In summing up, we see a common emphasis in the representation of Rāmā nuja in the two poems, the one composed in Tamil and the other in Sanskrit separated by centuries. This was a representation rooted in a strong hagio graphical, stotra tradition parallel to that of the guruparamparās that emerge from the twelfth century onwards and the various commentaries with hagio graphical elements on the Tiviyappirapantam. It reaffirmed Rāmānuja’s divine descent, similar to the divine descent of the āḻvārs. It was less uniformly codi fied, though, as to in what or in whom to locate Rāmānuja’s divinity—in Kṛṣṇa himself, in Viṣvaksena or Dattātreya, in Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa or his weapons. It is also equally clear that from early on the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition was united in seeing Rāmānuja as central to the salvific process, and in considering that, for those who were his disciples, taking refuge in Rāmānuja would accelerate the path to Vaikuṇṭha and the state of servitude (kaiṅkarya) to Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa. Nevertheless, the frequent references to Rāmānuja as destroying one’s sins, a reference directly calqued on the central promise of the Caramaśloka, is not absent but does not function as the fulcrum of the YS as it does in the IN. 

Here, we would do well to recollect Vedānta Deśika’s poetic tribute to other figures of the guruparaṃparā in the kāvya style, such as his references to Nam māḻvār in the Pādukāsahasram, the mahākavya of 1008 stanzas that centres around the Rāmāyaṇa episode where Bharata takes the sandals of Rāma on his head and has these reign as the symbol of Rāma’s presence, in the latter’s absence. Playing in certain verses on the double meaning of the pādukās— one as the divine sandals and one as Nammāḻvār himself being the sandals, adorning the feet of God as his ideal devotee—allows the poet to speak of Nam māḻvar’s subordination (śeṣatva) as well as his greatness in giving us the Tamil Vedas.23 Similar to the treatment of Rāmānuja in the YS, the Pādukāsahasram section on Nammāḻvār is careful to place him within the context of the entire guruparaṃparā tradition as someone who performs an extraordinary function in establishing the doctrinal foundations of the school, rather than as a unique figure who towers entirely above all the others of the lineage. Such a perspec tive, which even while lauding the achievement of each respective ācārya also

relativizes it within a historical understanding of the tradition, is very different from the affective framework of the IN, which dwells on the emotional reso nance of a single figure. 

5 Post-Prapatti 

The IN’s greater emphasis on Rāmānuja in his role as the ācārya significant for salvation anticipates Teṅkalai doctrinal development, as we see it evolv ing in the works of Piḷḷai Lokācārya (traditional dates: CE1264–1327) and in the commentaries on his works. In his works attention had decisively shifted to a soteriological path that was considered even more appropriate than prapatti for the seeker of salvation—both in terms of being easier as well as the most appropriate expression of the humility of the soul. This new salvific means was “love for the ācārya”—ācāryābhimāna. 

In her thorough study of the writings of Maṇavāḷamāmuṉi in the immediate post-Vedānta Deśika period, Mumme (1988) demonstrates the consolidation of the doctrine of ācāryābhimāna as the preferred form of salvation in his com mentaries on Piḷḷai Lōkācārya’s works. Summarily put, the doctrine of ācāryā bhimāna mirrors, in a mimetic fashion, the reasons why prapatti was favoured above bhaktiyoga in the immediate post-Rāmānuja stage of doctrinal forma tion. Ācāryābhimāna is not simply for the person incapable of prapatti; it is also “not only a separate means, but the superior or ultimate means (caramo pāya), given the ultimate limits of the soul’s nature and destiny” (p. 243). The pragmatics of it meant a total surrender of all one’s own responsibility for doing anything for salvation by relying on the ācārya to do the needful. What, then, exactly was the ācārya to do? As the commentary of Piḷḷai Lōkam Cīyar on Piḷḷai Lokācārya’s Arthapañcakam explains, this meant, in effect, that one surren dered all responsibility for performing prapatti to the ācārya, who out of great compassion and being a great devotee himself, does it for you in your stead and advises you on all your future conduct, so that the prapatti he does for you might prove efficacious.24 Thus, as Mumme (1988, 226–227) puts it succinctly, 

24 Arthapañcakam, Sūtra 9 commentary: “The person who does this ācāryābhimāna is inca pable of doing anything else. With regard to him, reflecting on his lowliness and the happiness of the Lord if he were to obtain him, like a mother, who when her child falls ill, sees this as her own fault and gives it medicine, the ācārya is that greatly compassionate one (paramadayālu) and great devotee (mahābhāgavata) who can undertake the means of salvation for the soul. All that the souls has to do is to surrender to the love for him and, 
 

reflections on the king of ascetics (yatirāja) 209 

The only means of salvation in practice today among the Teṅkalai is ācāryābhimāna—the love of the ācārya. As they see it, Rāmānuja has already done prapatti to the Lord for all future generations of his follow ers. Therefore, rather than surrendering to the Lord himself, one merely has to take refuge with an ācārya of his lineage. For the Vaṭakalai, the way of salvation is through the performance of prapatti to the Lord in the manner prescribed by the śāstras under the guidance of a qualified ācārya. Though the ācārya can perform prapatti specifically for a partic ular disciple, mere relationship with the ācārya is no substitute for the performance of bharaṇyāsa [understood in the broadest sense as the lay ing down of all one’s agency] with it’s aṅgas. 

Hence, she also goes on to point out that there is a widely held belief among contemporary Teṅkalai Śrīvaiṣṇavas, not established in any of the writings of Piḷḷai Lōkācārya, Maṇavāḷamāmuṉi or Vedānta Deśika, that “Rāmānuja is the ācāryawho has saved all future generations of Śrīvaiṣṇavas with his prapatti …” There is a conspicuous textual exception to the absence of this doctrine in the writings of the major ācāryas of both traditions in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries, though. This is the Caramopāyanirṇaya of Nāyaṉār Āccāṉ Piḷḷai (tra ditional dates: 1227–1327), the nephew and adopted son of Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai, a work that clearly endorses the view that taking refuge with Rāmānuja himself is central to salvation, thus making this a doctrinal position found well before contemporary belief. Mumme’s arguments (1988, 87–89) for doubting that this could be the work of Nāyaṉār Āccāṉ Piḷḷai is not dissimilar to the controversy regarding Rāmānuja’s authorship of the Gadyatraya, which I have addressed in some detail in my 2007 book: stylistically, she suggests it is different (too sim ple) compared to the same author’s other doctrinal works and ideologically it is far too radical for its time, anticipating a doctrine of ācāryabhimāna centred on Rāmānuja which only came much later. 

The detailed look I have taken at the Caramopāyanirṇaya, to be dealt with in another paper, shows a great deal of doctrinal convergence with the IN. Indeed, both works in their emotional appeal to Rāmānuja within a salvific framework

allow one to assume that Rāmānuja’s salvific qualities, stretching to a point where they can extend over historical posterior time, had become accepted doctrine in at least one important strand of the tradition, even within (if not shortly after) his postulated dates. That Vedānta Deśika, for his part, was also not unaware of these views centred around Rāmānuja becomes clear from a particular passage of his major work on prapatti, the Rahasyatrayasāram. In Chapter 8 of the text, where he is discussing the different categories of those qualified for prapatti(adhikārivibhāga), Vedānta Deśika differentiates between the uktiniṣṭhaṉ person, whose prapatti is based upon the utterance taught to them by their ācārya, and the ācāryaniṣṭhaṉ person, whose prapatti is done for them by their ācārya. Regarding this second category of persons, he has this to say: 

Among these [two categories], the ācāryaniṣṭhaṉ is himself included within the ācārya’s laying down of his burden (bharasamarpaṇam) with regard to him and his own …. For this ācāryaniṣṭhaṉ, according to the axiom of “how much more, then” (kaumutika nyāya), there can be no doubt as to the attainment of the fruit. Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ [Rāmānuja’s nephew] taught the verse: like those creatures on the body of a lion that leaps from one mountain to another, when Bhāṣyakāra [Rāmānuja] jointly leaps [does prapatti], then, due to our bodily relationship with him [i.e. being related to him due to kinship ties], we too have been elevated [we get the same salvific benefits as he does].25 

Vedānta Deśika is fully aware that these words attributed to Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ are capable of being understood as implying that Rāmānuja’s act of prapatti becomes the single soteriological event that saves all those who come after him in the community. Precisely to firmly reject such an understanding he adds, almost immediately, the following emphasis: 

In the Nyāsatilakam[verse 21] we also said:“The blind man is able to move about led by the one with sight, O Lord of Śrīraṅgam; the cripple, placed within a boat, is taken across by a boatman; the children of a servant relish [royal] food though they don’t know the king; thus will my compassion

reflections on the king of ascetics (yatirāja) 211 

ate teacher help me to reach you.” The Lord of All will not relent to give the supreme goal without prapatti being done in some way, through some person.26 

The significant point here is that Deśika is citing poetry of his own to show that the ācārya is the helper, even up to a point where he can do the prap atti for you. What this means that is that it is your current ācārya who can do this for you, and this is what the Nyāsatilakam verse elaborates. This does not mean that Rāmānuja’s prapatti at one historical moment absolves his entire community from henceforth doing it. Thus, Vedānta Deśika is concerned to subtly disagree with the statement of Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ’s or at least differs in his interpretation from what it comes to mean later within the Teṅkalai tradition. 

Ultimately, the doctrinal musings on Rāmānuja are central to a theme that lies at the heart of the tradition: the issue of how to reconfigure the nature of God’s and the religious canon’s own accessibility to the community of ordi nary devotees. Succinctly put, the literature of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition has repeatedly reconfigured the motif of accessibility both to enable the incor poration of doctrinal change and to allow for canonical expansion. Thus, the central argument in the equation of the Tiviyappirapantam and the Vedas is one of the accessibility of Vedic revelation in a manner that overcomes lin guistic, caste and gender boundaries. We see this elaborated in detail for the first time in Nañjīyar’s Āṟāyirappaṭi vyākhyānam and then more radically reit erated in the Ācāryahṛdayam of Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷapperumāḷ Nāyaṉār. The IN is also drawing upon this theme of accessibility—suggesting that Rāmānuja’s feet provide the same refuge in the Kali Yuga that Kṛṣṇa’s did in the Dvāpara Yuga. While Vedānta Deśika is determined to pay homage to Rāmānuja’s significance within the tradition and sees him as occupying a summit of his own, he is also determined to place him within a framework that establishes the coherence of the school of Viśiṣṭādvaita as a whole. The differences between the two poems are reflective of the differences, broadly speaking, in the hermeneutical strate gies between the Teṅkalai and Vaṭakalai literature, which Mumme (1988) again summarizes so well: the Teṅkalai literature, in general, leans towards hyperbole and dramatic intensity, drawing heavily upon popular idioms and metaphors and rooting itself in the Tamil, devotional poetry.In contrast, in Vedānta Deśika, 

26 Vedānta Deśika (1980, 296–297): andho’ nandhagrahaṇavaśago yāti raṅgeśa yadvat, paṅ gur naukākuharanihito nīyate nāvikena | bhuṅkte bhogān aviditanṛpaḥ sevakasyārbhakā diḥ, tvatsaṃprāptau prabhavati tathā deśiko me dayāluh || eṇṛu nyāsatilakattilē coṉṉōm. Ētēṉum oru parkaramākavumām, ārēṉum oruvar anuṣṭikkavumām prapattikk allatu sar veśvaraṉ puruṣārtham koṭukka iraṅkāṉ eṉṟatāyiṟṟu.

particularly, we see the need to balance rhetorical flourishes with scholastic precision. He wishes to be seen to be speaking for the coherence of the tradi tion as a whole, particularly in order that it withstand pan-Vedāntic scholas tic scrutiny. For him, homage to Rāmānuja must not lead, through rhetorical excess, to a new and radical turn in the doctrine of prapatti, as it does in the Teṅkalai case. 

The analysis of the stotra literature on Rāmānuja here, by no means exhaus tive but rather exemplary of the formative phase of doctrine, also reinforces for us what has already been established for Rāmānuja’s own writings, as in the case of the Gadyatraya: that devotional poetry composed not just by the āḻvārs but also the later ācāryas is as central as commentaries and independent works to the evolution of Śrīvaiṣṇava doctrine. 

Finally, it is no mere coincidence that both the Vaṭakalai and Teṅkalai nityā nusaṃdhānam texts begin with a pool of common single, independent verses (taṉiyaṉ) of salutation to each figure in turn in one’s guruparaṃparā, which Śrī vaiṣṇavas are encouraged to recite on a daily basis. Both contain Kūrattāḻvāṉ’s taṉiyan that ends with the words asmadguror bhagavato ’sya dayaikasindhoḥ, rāmānujasya caraṇau śaraṇam prapadye. This convergence in Rāmānuja as the object of veneration speaks for his centrality—as the central gemstone in the necklace of the guruparamparā, as Vedānta Deśika says in his poem (verse 15): a pendant that holds together, gives structure to and makes resplendent not just the individual beads of the necklace but indeed, as the other ācāryas who are themselves likened to the beads of the necklace would say, adorning and forming the dazzling central gemstone of the entire tradition.

Not to Worry, Vasiṣṭha Will Sort It Out: 

The Role of the Purohita in the Raghuvaṃśa Csaba Dezső 

It is my greatest pleasure to dedicate this paper to Professor Alexis Sanderson, whose guidance I was fortunate to have during my doctoral studies at the Uni versity of Oxford. I couldn’t have wished for a better supervisor. His formidable knowledge of the intellectual history of early-mediaeval India has been both overwhelming and inspiring right from the first lectures I attended. The reason why I hold that without the sound skills of philology it is pointless to undertake the study of the past is to a large extent thanks to the mastery he has shown in using those skills. The breadth of his learning and his keen interest in diverse aspects of classical Indian culture prevented me from ever feeling uncomfort able for not doing research on Śaivism, his main field, but persisting in studying kāvya. Our tutorials had a formative influence on my scholarship; they were always stimulating and eminently enjoyable. I am grateful to have had the good fortune of being his student. 

Recounting the deeds of several kings of a royal lineage, Kālidāsa’s epic does not describe a single hero’s rise to success (abhyudaya). One could regard with Bonisoli-Alquati (2008, 105) the dynasty itself as the protagonist of the Raghuvaṃśa. There is one character, however, whose timely interventions help the continuance of the dynasty throughout the whole epic: this character is Vasiṣṭha, the royal chaplain, purohita. But how is it possible that Vasiṣṭha was the purohita and guru of the Sūryavaṃśa for so many generations?Is it the same Vasiṣṭha? 

A legend in theTaittirīya Saṃhitā tells us that among the sages itwas Vasiṣṭha alone who could see Indra. The god taught him the Stomabhāgas with the charge that any king who had him as purohitawould thereby flourish if Vasiṣṭha did not tell the Stomabhāgas to other sages.“Therefore—teaches the text—one should have a descendant of Vasiṣṭha (a Vāsiṣṭha) as one’s brahman priest.”1 The 

1 Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3.5.2.6: tásmād Vāsiṣṭhó brahmā́kāryàḥ. In the later Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa we read that formerly only a descendant of Vasiṣṭha could become brahman, but now anyone who is suitable can (12.6.1.41, quoted in Minkowski 1991, 126).

brahman was the priest who silently monitored the ritual. He was associated with the Atharvaveda and with the office of the family priest, the purohita of the patron of the sacrifice, the yajamāna.2 We may connect with these Vedic passages the tradition that Vasiṣṭha or several Vasiṣṭhas were the purohita(s) of the kings of Ayodhyā, the members of the Ikṣvāku- or Sūryavaṃśa. Pargiter (1922, 203ff.) distinguished seven Vasiṣṭhas in the legends, but, as he pointed out, these Vasiṣṭhas merged into one person. Thus we read in the Mahābhārata (1.164.9cd–11): 

Ikṣvākavo mahīpālā lebhire pṛthivīm imām. 

purohitavaraṃ prāpya Vasiṣṭham ṛṣisattamam 

ījire kratubhiś cāpi nṛpās te kurunandana. 

sa hi tān yājayām āsa sarvān nṛpatisattamān 

brahmarṣiḥ Pāṇḍavaśreṣṭha Bṛhaspatir ivāmarān. 

The Ikṣvāku kings conquered this world. 

Having obtained Vasiṣṭha, the best of sages, as their excellent purohita, those kings performed sacrifices, O descendant of the Kurus. 

For that brahmin sage officiated for all those great kings at their sacri fices, 

O best of the Pāṇḍavas, as Bṛhaspati did for the gods. 

In the Raghuvaṃśa, too, it is the same Vasiṣṭha who is the purohita of the whole dynasty. As Dilīpa says to the priest (1.71cd): Ikṣvākūnāṃ durāpe ’rthe tvadadhīnā hi siddhayaḥ,3 “For the successes of the Ikṣvākus depend on you in goals that are hard to achieve.” When Rāma returns from Laṅkā he also greets Vasiṣṭha as the guru of the lineage of Ikṣvāku (ikṣvākuvaṃśagurave praṇamya …, 13.70). 

Both Vedic and epic texts emphasise the purohita’s role by the king’s side in achieving victories and averting dangers.4 As Gonda (1975, 322) has shown, this protective function is already expressed by the name of the office: puro hita means “placed in front,” that is in front of the king like a shield. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa we read that “the gods do not eat the food of that king 

2 Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 12.8.6: annaṃ vai brahmaṇaḥ purodhā, “the office of the purohita is the food of the brahman.” 

3 I quote the verses of Raghuvaṃśa 1–6 from Goodall and Isaacson 2003, and the verses of can tos 7–19 from Nandargikar 1982, unless indicated otherwise.

who has no purohita,”5 and “the purohita is half of the kṣatriya’s self,”6 he is the protector of the kingdom, rāṣṭragopa.7 This close relationship between king and chaplain and their co-operation in the protection of the state is expressed in a verse of the Raghuvaṃśa in which Kālidāsa writes about king Atithi (17.38): 

Vasiṣṭhasya guror mantrāḥ sāyakās tasya dhanvinaḥ 

kiṃ tat sādhyaṃ yad ubhaye sādhayeyur na saṅgatāḥ? 

The mantras of Vasiṣṭha, the guru, and the arrows of that archer— what is there to achieve that these two could not achieve when 

united? 

According to the Arthaśāstra the purohita had a central place among the king’s closest advisers. The ninth chapter of its first book gives us some details about the person of the royal chaplain (1.9.9–10): 

purohitam uditoditakulaśīlaṃ sāṅge vede daive nimitte daṇḍanītyāṃ cābhivinītam āpadām daivamānuṣīṇām atharvabhir upāyaiś ca 

pratikartāraṃ kurvīta. 

tam ācāryaṃ śiṣyaḥ pitaraṃ putro bhṛtyaḥ svāminam iva cānuvarteta. 

He should appoint as chaplain a man who comes from a very distin guished family and has an equally distinguished character, who is thoroughly trained in the Veda together with the limbs, in divine omens, and in government, and who could counteract divine and human adversities through Atharvan means. 

He should follow him as a pupil his teacher, a son his father, and a ser vant his master.

When Dilīpa visits Vasiṣṭha in his ashram he extolls the merits of the purohita in preserving the welfare of the kingdom. Vasiṣṭha is the one who “counteracts

both divine and human calamities.”8 The Arthaśāstra lists eight divine disas ters (4.3.1): fire, water, famine, rats, harmful animals, snakes and demons. In another passage (8.4.1) it mentions fire, flood, disease, famine and epidemic. The mantras and rituals of the Atharvaveda and thus the purohita who was an expert in Atharvavedic rituals had major roles in averting these calamities.9 Vasiṣṭha’s “holy spells defeat the enemy even from a distance,”10 and “his offer ing thrown into the fire becomes rain for the crops parched by drought.”11 It is the sacred power (brahmavarcasa) of the purohita thanks to which diseases and other disasters avoid the people (1.63). The king attributes the welfare and safety of his country to his guru (1.64): 

tad evaṃ cintyamānasya guruṇā Brahmayoninā 

sānubandhāḥ kathaṃ na syuḥ sampado me nirāpadaḥ? 

Therefore when my guru, who was born from Brahmā, takes care of me in this way, 

how could my accomplishments not be continuous, free from calami ties? 

Vasiṣṭha, who is well-versed in yoga, discovers with the help of concentration what causes Dilīpa’s childlessness: once he failed to salute Surabhi, the sacred cow, who cursed the king, at least in some versions of the texts. In another ver sion it is the king’s negligence in itself that made him childless.12 Luckily the grandchild of Surabhi is in Vasiṣṭha’s ashram, so the king can wait on her to obtain her blessing. As soon as her name has been uttered the holy cow appears: a good omen according to the sage, who is also an expert in the interpretation of signs, as a purohita should indeed be. 

In the eleventh sarga Daśaratha is on his way back from the court of the king of Mithilā, where they have celebrated the weddings of his sons, when he encounters ominous signs: strong headwinds tear the flags of his army, a fright ening circle surrounds the sun, the points of the compass filled with red clouds 

8 Raghuvaṃśa 1.60: daivīnāṃ mānuṣīṇām ca pratikartā tvam āpadām, cf. Ayyar 1925, 8. 9 Arthaśāstra 9.7.84 prescribes the rites of the Atharvaveda against too much or too little rain, and against demons, 4.3.40 also against demons, while 4.3.35 against snakes. On the association of the purohita with the Atharvavedic tradition see Sanderson 2007, 204f., notes 28 and 29. 

10 Raghuvaṃśa 1.61: mantrair dūrāt saṃyamitāribhiḥ.

resemble a menstruating woman, and female jackals are howling.13 Daśaratha asks for Vasiṣṭha’s help (11.61 in Vallabhadeva’s text):14 

tat pratīpapavanādi vaikṛtaṃ kṣipraśāntam adhikṛtya kṛtyavit 

anvayuṅkta gurum īśvaraḥ kṣiteḥ svantam ity alaghayat sa tad 

vyathām. 

The king who knew what to do asked his guru about those portents like the headwind etc., 

if they would be averted soon, and he removed his fears saying, “It will end well.” 

The southern commentators (Mallinātha, Aruṇagirinātha and Hemādri) read the second pāda as prekṣya śāntim adhikṛtya (v. 62 in their version), that is Daśaratha asks the purohita about the pacifying ritual that quells the ills. Vasiṣṭha’s reply, “it will end well,” might mean in this case that there is no need to perform such a ritual. The omens indicate the arrival of Paraśurāma, who is defeated by Rāma, so the story does indeed end well.15 

The purohita performed such important ceremonies for the royal family as the rituals associated with childbirth. As we read in the Arthaśāstra (1.17.26): prajātāyāḥ putrasaṃskāraṃ purohitaḥ kuryāt, “When she (i.e. the queen) has delivered, the chaplain should perform the rite of passage for the son” (trans. Olivelle 2013, 89). As Olivelle (2013, 486) remarks, this may also refer to the rites of early childhood, possibly including the upanayana. In the Raghuvaṃśa we see that Vasiṣṭha performs the priestly duties when Dilīpa’s son Raghu is born (3.18): 

sa jātakarmaṇy akhile tapasvinā tapovanād etya purodhasā kṛte 

Dilīpasūnur maṇir ākarodgataḥ prayuktasaṃskāra ivādhikaṃ babhau. 

When the complete birth ritual was done by the ascetic chaplain who had come from the grove of ascetics, 

Dilīpa’s son shone yet more, like a precious stone taken from a mine and then polished.

15 The source of the story is Rāmāyaṇa 1.73.7ff. 
 

222 dezső 

In Kālidāsa’s poetry, as Ingalls (1976, 19) has observed, ritual is associated with beauty. The purohita is like the jeweller who polishes the precious stone and transforms it into a gem. He performs the life-cycle rituals that make the individual a member of civilised society. 

The purohita also had an important role in the marriage ceremonies of the royal families. Aja and Indumatī were wed by the chaplain of Indumatī’s brother (7.20): 

tatrārcito Bhojapateḥ purodhā hutvāgnim ājyādibhir agnikalpaḥ 

tam eva cādhāya vivāhasākṣye vadhūvarau saṃgamayāṃ cakāra. 

There lord Bhoja’s venerable chaplain, who was like fire, offered clarified butter and other things to the fire, 

and having made the same [fire] witness to the marriage he wed the bride and the groom. 

At the end of his life Raghu entrusted the kingdom to his son, Aja, and lived the life of a yogin, aiming for apavarga, liberation from the cycle of rebirths (8.16). He chose the time of his death himself: “by yogic meditation he reached the eternal Soul, beyond darkness” (tamasaḥ param āpad avyayaṃ puruṣaṃ yogasamādhinā, 8.24). The verse describing Raghu’s funeral ceremonies is transmitted in two versions. Vallabhadeva knew the following version (8.26):16 

śrutadehavisarjanaḥ pituś ciram aśrūṇi visṛjya Rāghavaḥ 

vitatāna samaṃ purodhasā kratum antyaṃ pṛthivīśatakratoḥ. (8.26) 

When he heard that his father had laid off his body, Raghu’s son shed tears for a long time, 

and then performed the final sacrifice of that Indra of the earth together with the chaplain. 

The second half is transmitted in the southern commentaries as follows (8.25cd in Mallinātha, Aruṇagirinātha and Hemādri): 

vidadhe vidhim asya naiṣṭhikaṃ yatibhiḥ sārdham anagnim agnicit. 

16 Quoted from a draft edition prepared by Dominic Goodall, HarunagaIsaacson, Csaba Kiss, and myself. 
 

not to worry, vasiṣṭha will sort it out 223 

… he, who had arranged the sacrificial fires, performed his last rites with out fire together with the ascetics. 

According to this version Raghu’s body was not cremated but buried, as it was the custom in the case of saṃnyāsins, ascetics striving for final liberation. The purohita is not mentioned in this version; it was rather Raghu’s fellow yogins who attended the ceremony. In the version known to Vallabhadeva it is not made explicit that the ritual was performed without fire, and Vasiṣṭha, the puro hita was also present. If we suppose that this was the original version, the text known to the later commentators might be the result of a correction or dis ambiguation: since Raghu had retired from secular life and was striving for mokṣa as a renunciant, it might have seemed more correct to have his burial performed by the community of ascetics.17 However, the question might be more complicated, since in the variants of the verses describing Raghu’s final years, as well as in the Keralan commentaries and that of Hemādri, we can detect a tendency to weed out or explain away references to Raghu being a saṃnyāsin. But in this verse, interestingly, it is the Southern commentators’ ver sion in which Raghu is clearly treated as a deceased yati. Raghu’s position as a retired king was not without ambiguities: his son, Aja, did not allow him to retire to the forest, so Raghu moved to a place outside the palace, bahiḥ kṣiti pālaveśmanaḥ, at least in Vallabhadeva’s version (8.14),18 because the Southern commentators knew a text according to which the old king moved outside the town, purād bahiḥ.19 Here we perhaps see the same effort that tries to make Raghu’s position less ambiguous and to move him further away from the palace and worldly life. But this effort is not completely successful since in the second half of the same verse we read that Śrī, the goddess of wealth and royal majesty, who was now enjoyed by his son, served Raghu like a daughter-in-law (samu pāsyata putrabhogyayā snuṣayevāvikṛtendriyaḥ śriyā), which means that Raghu did not entirely live the life of an ascetic. 

The king of the last canto of the epic, Agnivarṇa, lived a dissolute life and died of a consuming disease. His death was kept secret (19.54): 

taṃ gṛhopavana eva saṃgatāḥ paścimakratuvidā purodhasā 

rogaśāntim apadiśya mantrinaḥ sambhṛte śikhini gūḍham ādadhuḥ. 

17 Thus Goodall 2001, 121. 

18 8.14ab: sa bahiḥ kṣitipālaveśmano nivasann āvasathe yativrataḥ … (Quoted from a draft edition prepared by Dominic Goodall, Harunaga Isaacson, Csaba Kiss, and myself.) 19 8.14ab: sa kilāśramam antyam āśrito nivasann āvasathe purād bahiḥ.

The ministers joined by the chaplain who knew the last rites placed him on the pyre in secret 

in the palace garden, under the pretext of a ceremony that averts dis ease. 

The ministers and the purohita concealed the king’s death because they wanted to secure the succession to the throne. Since Agnivarṇa did not have a son, they placed his pregnant widow on the throne, in accordance with the instructions of the Arthaśāstra (5.6.36).20 

The purohita had a central role in the ceremony of the royal consecration. About Aja we read the following in the Raghuvaṃśa (8.3–4): 

anubhūya Vasiṣṭhasaṃbhṛtaiḥ salilais tasya mahābhiṣecanam 

viśadocchvasitena medinī kathayām āsa kṛtārthatām iva. 

sa babhūva durāsadaḥ parair guruṇātharvavidā kṛtakriyaḥ 

pavanāgnisamāgamo hy ayaṃ sahitaṃ brahma yad astratejasā. 

Having experienced his great consecration with water gathered by Vasiṣṭha, 

the earth seemed to express her contentment with clear sighs. 

When the ritual had been performed for him by the guru who knew the Atharvaveda, he became unassailable by his enemies, 

for when brahman is united with the power of weapons it is a union of wind and fire. 

Both Aruṇagirinātha and Mallinātha quote ad loc. the Manusmṛti which teaches the inseparability of royal and priestly power (9.322):21 

nābrahma kṣatram ṛdhnoti nākṣatraṃ brahma vardhate 

brahma kṣatraṃ ca saṃpṛktam iha cāmutra vardhate. 

The Kṣatriya does not flourish without the Brahmin, and the Brahmin does not prosper without the Kṣatriya; 

but when Brahmin and Kṣatriya are united, they prosper here and in the hereafter. 

trans. Olivelle 2005, 206 

20 See Dezső 2014, 161f. Though many generations separate Raghu and Agnivarṇa, Vallab hadeva also identifies the purohita of the latter as Vasiṣṭha (commentary to 19.54). 21 Cf. Ayyar 1925, 8. 
 

not to worry, vasiṣṭha will sort it out 225 

In the case of Atithi’s consecration Kālidāsa stresses the importance of Atharvavedic mantras (17.13): 

purohitapurogās taṃ jiṣṇuṃ jaitrair atharvabhiḥ 

upacakramire pūrvam abhiṣektuṃ dvijātayaḥ. 

The brahmins headed by the chaplain began to consecrate him who was destined to victory 

first with Atharvavedic mantras that lead to victory. 

The rituals performed by the purohita made the king invincible in battle.When Raghu was about to set off to defeat Kuvera, the god of riches, Vasiṣṭha empow ered his chariot (5.27): 

Vasiṣṭhamantrokṣaṇajāt prabhāvād udanvadākāśamahīdhareṣu 

marutsakhasyeva balāhakasya gatir vijaghne na hi tadrathasya. 

Due to the power arisen from the sprinkling performed with mantras by Vasiṣṭha 

the course of his chariot was not blocked on the ocean, in the sky and in the mountains, like that of a cloud helped by the wind. 

The source of the mantras used by the purohita was again probably the Athar vaveda. The ritual manual of the Kauśikasūtra (15.11) contains several verses prescribed for the consecration of the chariot. 

In the Raghuvaṃśawe see the purohita at every important ceremonial occa sion taking place in the royal court, from the birth of the heir through the marriage of the prince to the funeral of the king. Vasiṣṭha protected the king’s person and made him invincible in battle with his Atharvavedic mantras. On the other hand Vasiṣṭha was also the guru and adviser of the king who showed him the path to be followed: we see him in this role in the eighth canto when he comes to the support of the despairing Aja. 

When a garland falling from the sky kills his wife, Aja laments over her with some of the most moving verses of Sanskrit literature. The only reason he does not throw himself on the funeral pyre is that people would speak badly of a king who follows a woman in death. Vasiṣṭha learns in his ashram that Aja has been paralysed by grief,22 and since he is engaged in a ritual and therefore can 

22 abhiṣaṅgajaḍam: 8.75 in Mallinātha, 76 in Hemādri, 73 in Aruṇagirinātha. Vallabhadeva reads abhiṣaṅginam (8.76). 
 

226 dezső 

not visit the king personally he sends one of his disciples to convey Aja his message. Vasiṣṭha knows everything that has happened, happens or will hap pen in heaven, on earth or in the netherworld, so he tells Aja in his message that Indumatī was a cursed apsaras who had to live in a human body until she was touched by a heavenly garland. Aja should stop grieving (8.84 in Vallabha deva):23 

tad alaṃ tadapāyacintayā vipad utpattimatām avasthitā 

vasudheyam avekṣyatāṃ tvayā vasumatyā hi nṛpāḥ kalatriṇaḥ. 

So do not think about her death. Those who have been born will surely die. 

Have regard for this Earth, for the Earth is the true wife of kings. 

Vasiṣṭha first expresses the truism we also find in the Bhagavadgītā, jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyuḥ, “death is certain for all that is born.”24 Then he reminds Aja of his duty as a king: he must protect the earth, who, as the goddess Earth, is also his wife. This idea has already appeared in the same canto: Raghu handed over Aja the earth as a second Indumatī, and Aja took possession of the earth gently, as one enjoys a newly wedded wife (8.7). His divine wife gave him lots of gems, his human wife gave him a valorous son (8.28). But Aja’s lament makes it clear whom he regards as his real wife (8.53 in Vallabhadeva):25 

manasāpi na vipriyaṃ mayā kṛtapūrvaṃ nanu kiṃ jahāsi mām 

vata śabdapatiḥ kṣiter ahaṃ tvayi me bhāvanibandhanaṃ manaḥ. 

Surely I have not offended you even in my thoughts, why are you leaving me? 

Truly I am the earth’s husband only in name, my heart is bound with feelings to you. 

If we consider Aja’s words we might suspect that Vasiṣṭha’s admonition will not have much effect on him.

25 Quoted from a draft edition prepared by Dominic Goodall, HarunagaIsaacson, Csaba Kiss, and myself. 
 

udaye yad avāpyam ujjhatā śrutam āviṣkṛtam ātmanas tvayā 

manasas tad upasthite jvare punar aklīvatayā prakāśyatām. 

The learning that you showed when you avoided what could have been achieved in the time of success— 

demonstrate the same again like a man now that your heart is suffering. 

“What could have been achieved” (avāpyam) and what Aja avoided was, ac cording to Vallabhadeva, ecstasy or being overjoyed (praharṣaṃ madaṃ vā). As at the time of success he could stay away from an excessive mental state, in the same way he should behave like a man and be composed at the time of grief.27 Aja could not find Indumatī even if he followed her in death, since those who live in the other world go on paths that differ according to their karma (8.86 in Vallabhadeva). Aja should stop crying because the tears of the relatives burn the departed souls (a belief we also read about in texts on dharmaśāstra28). Then Vasiṣṭha’s message becomes more philosophical:29 

maraṇaṃ prakṛtiḥ śarīriṇāṃ vikṛtir jīvitam ucyate budhaiḥ. 

kṣaṇam apy avatiṣṭhate śvasan yadi jantur nanu lābhavān asau. (8.88 in Vallabhadeva) 

The wise say that death is the natural state of embodied creatures and life is a change in that state. 

If a being remains breathing even for a moment it is surely fortunate. 

avagacchati mūḍhacetanaḥ priyanāśaṃ hṛdi śalyam arpitam, 

itaras tu tad eva manyate kuśaladvāratayā samuddhṛtam. (8.89 in Vallab hadeva)

Death should be regarded as an unavoidable, natural event, which can even be beneficial: as Vallabhadeva says, when attachment ceases, one attains the imperishable state (snehakṣayāt kila nirapāyapadāvāptiḥ), the cutting of one’s emotional bonds helps achieve the stopping of rebirth and redeath. Aja should regard his dead wife as one of the sense objects he meets and is parted from every day. 

Finally Vasiṣṭha appeals to Aja’s pride:30 

na pṛthagjanavac chuco vaśaṃ vaśinām uttama gantum arhasi. 

drumasānumatoḥ kim antaraṃ yadi vāyau dvitaye pi te calāḥ? (8.91 in Vallabhadeva) 

Best of the self-controlled! You ought not to become subject to grief like common people. 

What would be the difference between a tree and a mountain if both shook in the wind? 

When Duṣyanta gives way to despair over the loss of Śakuntalā, the vidūṣaka expresses his puzzlement with similar words: “How have things got this far? How could the fortitude of good men be affected by grief? Surely mountains remain unshaken even by a storm wind.”31 Duṣyanta is shaken up by Mātali,

Indra’s charioteer, who pretends to kidnap the vidūṣaka and thus arouses in the king his fighting spirit and his sense of duty to protect others. Aja seemingly acquiesced in the words of his purohita, but, as Kālidāsa writes, Vasiṣṭha’s counsel “could not find a place in his heart full of grief and returned, as it were, to his guru” together with the disciple.32 The king took into consideration that his son was not yet of age and reigned eight more years, while his only solace was the likeness of his beloved (similarly to Duṣyanta who found pleasure only in painting a portrait of Śakuntalā). When his heart was completely shattered by grief, Aja starved himself to death and left his body behind at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Sarayū. Then he met his beloved again in Indra’s heaven in a form that surpassed her former beauty. We do not know what Kālidāsa’s sources were for Aja’s tragic story, but there is a work with which we can make interesting comparisons: Aśvaghoṣa’s Bud dhacarita.33 When prince Siddhārtha leaves the palace to live the life of a wandering ascetic in search of the teaching that gives liberation, the king’s min ister and purohita undertake to find him and appeal to his better self. Though they do not trust in the success of their undertaking, they set off nevertheless, setting off a battle between the bodhisattva and the diverse rules of scrip ture.34 

Like in the Raghuvaṃśa, we read about a message, but in the Buddhacarita it is the purohitawho conveys the words of the king to his son, a king whose heart has been transfixed by the dart of grief.35 The king is inconsolable because Sid dhārtha has not waited until his old age, as is prescribed in the śāstras, to retire to the forest in search of mokṣa, and so his father could not transfer the king dom to his son and retire himself (9.22). Only the coward needs such things as the forest and the symbols of ascetics (vanaṃ ca liṅgaṃ ca hi bhīrucihnam, 9.18), for kings may also walk on the path leading to mokṣa (9.20). The purohita tries to stir the bodhisattva’s feelings and paints in vivid colours the sorrow he caused to his father, foster mother, wife, little son and the whole harem when he left the palace behind (9.23ff.). 

The bodhisattva, after some thought, replies that he had no other choice: because of the fear of sickness, old age and death he had to forsake his fam

ily.36 Separation is unavoidable anyway, as in the case of travellers who meet on the way, therefore his father’s clinging to him is pointless (9.33): 

maddhetukaṃ yat tu narādhipasya śokaṃ bhavān āha, na tat priyaṃ me, yat svapnabhūteṣu samāgameṣu saṃtapyate bhāvini viprayoge. 

You spoke about the king’s grief on account of me; I am not pleased that he is so distressed, 

amidst associations as fleeting as dreams, when separation is bound to take place. 

trans. Olivelle 2008, 257 

Such ideas might be familiar from the Raghuvaṃśa where the purohita tries to shake up Aja with similar words, but without much success: during the remaining eight years of his life Aja consoles himself with the festivals of brief encounters with his wife in his dreams.37 While Aja out of a sense of duty does not throw away his life immediately and reigns until his son grows into a man, nothing and nobody can convince the bodhisattva to break his vow, return to the palace and take upon himself the burden of kingship, which he deplores.38 

After the purohita the minister also tries to persuade the bodhisattva to return to the palace. He argues that we have no certain knowledge about the afterlife, so one should enjoy power and wealth as long as one can (9.53ff.). Real liberation is the clearing of the three debts: towards one’s ancestors by father ing offsprings, towards the gods by sacrificing and towards the sages by studying the Vedas (9.65). But the bodhisattva cannot be discouraged: for him there is no way back to the palace, and instead of a sceptical attitude he wants to acquire the knowledge leading to liberation himself (9.73). 

The mission of the purohita in the Buddhacarita does not succeed; the bodhi sattva is unwilling to leave the path he has chosen himself (9.78): 

tad evam apy eva ravir mahīṃ pated, api sthiratvaṃ Himavān giris tyajet, adṛṣṭasattvo viṣayonmukhendriyaḥ śrayeya na tv eva gṛhān pṛthagjanaḥ. 

Therefore, although the sun may fall to earth, or Himālaya lose its fixity, I’ll not return home like a common man, 

36 9.31: vyādhijarāvipadbhyo bhītas tv agatyā svajanaṃ tyajāmi. 

37 Raghuvaṃśa 8.93: svapneṣu kṣaṇikasamāgamotsavaiḥ. 

38 Buddhacarita 9.40: mohāyatanaṃ nṛpatvam.

whose senses yearn for sensual things, and who has not perceived the truth. 

trans. Olivelle 2008, 275 

Siddhārtha does not want to live the life of a common man, a life into which the purohita and the minister want to pull him back. For him separation from his loved ones is indeed the door leading to liberation. Vasiṣṭha asks Aja to rise above common people and not to let his feelings take hold of him. Aja should accept what cannot be avoided; he should not grieve because of separation that is bound to happen, but he is unable to do this. Siddhārtha has recognised the impermanence of human relations and he is not shaken by appeals to family bonds. 

The bodhisattva is more than human; his firm resolution to break away from the values of brahmanical society inspires awe. Aja remains very much human in his grief. Vasiṣṭha demands of him detachment while remaining in the world: a way of life that Vasiṣṭha himself, an ascetic sage who is at the same time a royal chaplain, lives. Vasiṣṭha is truly the purohita of the dynasty and the dynasty needs kings who rule in an exemplary fashion, beget offspring and transfer the kingship to a suitable heir when the time has come. He saves the dynasty again since the transfer of power between Aja and his son Daśaratha takes place smoothly, but he fails to have any influence on Aja’s feelings. Here we touch upon one of the key issues of Kālidāsa’s poetry: the difficulty of creating and maintaining a harmony of duties, interests, and emotions, be they love or grief. Aja’s example shows that there is a grief so deeply felt that no teaching about detachment, no appeal to duty can assuage.

### 10 Buddhism, Kingship and the Protection of the State: The Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra and Dhāraṇī Literature 

Gergely Hidas 

1 Introduction 

This article focuses first on the ritual core of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra, which teaches the protection of the state for the mutual benefit of the Bud dhist Sangha and the monarch. The essay then explores the ways in which this theme appears in dhāraṇī literature in the first half of the first millennium.1 It is shown that offering safeguard to rulers and their regions is a long-established practice in South Asian Buddhism, persisting into modern times, and that there have been a variety of incantation scriptures available for accomplishing this task. 

2 The Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra: The Sūtra of Golden Light 

This scripture of Mahāyāna Buddhism survives in its oldest form in South Asia in two palm-leaf manuscripts from Nepal dated to the 14th and 16th centuries.2 The remaining witnesses from the subcontinent are paper codices of later cen turies, but dozens of Central Asian Sanskrit fragments survive from the second half of the first millennium. The Sanskrit text of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama has been edited a few times, most recently by Skjaervø (2004). This scripture was remarkably influential across the Buddhist lands of Asia, and was trans lated into Chinese, Tibetan, Khotanese and several additional languages over the course of many centuries. The Chinese translation by Dharmakṣema is the earliest, from circa 417CE, which marks the terminus ante quem for the emer gence of thissūtra. Editions of Tibetan and Chinese recensions were published

by Nobel in the 1940s and 1950s, while Skjaervø (2004) provides the most com prehensive treatment of the Khotanese version. Several translations of this scripture are available in Western languages, with Emmerick 1970 being the classical point of reference, based on the Sanskrit. An excellent overview of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama with a detailed account of previous research was published by Gummer (2015). 

3 The Ritual Core of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra 

The structure of this scripture shows evidence of considerable expansion over the centuries. The most widespread Sanskrit version contains nineteen chap ters, but Nobel (1937) suggests that there may only have been fourteen pari vartas initially.3 He also proposed that chapter 3, the Deśanāparivarta, is likely to represent the original core of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama, containing verses on the confession of sins, the resolution to attain buddhahood and praise of the buddhas, the recitation or hearing of which brings about great benefit.4 If we look, however, for chapters that actually have detailed ritual instructions, it appears that the ritual core of this sūtra is contained in sections 6, 7 and 8: the Caturmahārājaparivarta, Sarasvatīparivarta and Śrīparivarta. The latter two include more complex observances and dhāraṇī-spells. 

Chapter 6, the Caturmahārājaparivarta or Chapter on the Four Great Kings,5 conveys an explicit message: those kings (manuṣyarāja) who venerate the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama and support the Buddhist Sangha will be protected from hostile armies and other dangers by the Four Great Kings, and their coun tries will exist in highest state of harmony. Simultaneously, those who ignore this tradition will face decline. This sūtra directly and repeatedly refers to monarchs, and throughout this chapter and the whole scripture it is obvious that kings are envisaged as the principal target audience. At one point the

5 These eminent yakṣas Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa are celestial guard ians of the cardinal directions, along with their retinues in Jambudvīpa. From the Pali Āṭānā ṭiya-sutta (Dīgha-nikāya 32) to various Sanskrit rakṣā texts, they often take the role of chief protectors. Note that the Four Great Kings guarded the cardinal points at the great stūpa of Bhārhut, circa 100BCE (Skilling 1992, 163).

scripture calls itself a rājaśāstra,6 a text for kings, and it is notable that chap ter 12 is entitled Devendrasamayarājaśāstraparivartaḥ, or Chapter of the Royal Treatise called Conventions for Divine Kings, which expounds the ideal of the Dharma-following monarch.7 On the basis of the general tone of the Caturma hārājaparivarta it is fairly evident that the main intended function of thissūtra was proselytizing, that is, attracting leaders of various regions to Buddhism by offering them mutually beneficial services. The Buddhist community appears to have been in perceptible need of securing support from the highest places; some passages seem to indicate a degree of despair, as reflected in their accen tuation of vital threats for those not prepared to follow this tradition.8 It is also not unlikely that Buddhism was at times persecuted, as certain references indicate.9 Occasionally the text becomes somewhat guarded or equivocal, for example in its claim that the Four Great Kings and the summoned deities arrive in the king’s palace with invisible bodies,10 which suggests an effort by the text’s compilers to achieve their goals in the most secure possible ways. As for the ritual instructions in this chapter,11 it is prescribed that the king should clean the palace, sprinkle the premises with perfumes and scatter flowers. He should prepare an ornamented Dharma-throne and a lower seat for himself. He should listen to this sūtra recited by a dharmabhāṇaka monk and honour those of the Sangha who present the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama. As a result, the whole universe will be adorned, lit up by golden light. The Four Great Kings and other divine beings will approach the palace to listen to the recitation and will protect the sovereign and his realm. 

In chapter 7, the Sarasvatīparivarta,12 the goddess Sarasvatī grants her sup port to the Dharma preacher through the gift of eloquence, and presents a bathing ritual with enchanted herbs for him and his audience in order to appease all disturbances.It is promised that, invoked by praise, Sarasvatī herself

8 Skjaervø 2004, 6.5.14–6.5.32. Chapter 12 also includes a description of grave dangers for kings who fail to follow the Dharma; see Skjaervø 2004, 12.17–12.61. 

9 Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra 6.1.35–36 (Skjaervø 2004): manuṣyarājā … teṣāṃ sūtrendra dhārakāṇāṃ bhikṣuṇāṃ sarva-pratyarthikebhya ārakṣāṃ kuryāt. 

10 Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra 6.2.17, 6.2.37 (Skjaervø 2004): te vayaṃ bhadanta bhagavaṃś catvāro mahā-rājānaḥ sa-bala-parivārā anekair yakṣa-śata-sahasrair adṛśyair kāyātma bhāvais tenopasaṃkramiṣyāmaḥ. It seems that the redactors wished to avoid the risk that the listener expects these divine beings to come in a perceptible form, and then perhaps be disappointed.

will appear and remove all diseases and difficulties. The ritual instructions pre scribe that one should pound herbs and consecrate the powder with mantras at the time of the Puṣya constellation. A maṇḍala should be drawn with cow dung, flowers should be scattered and gold and silver vessels filled. Four armed men and four well-adorned maidens should be placed there holding pots in their hands, thus accomplishing the protective sealing of the boundaries (sīmā bandha). One should use incense, music, umbrellas, flags, banners, mirrors, arrows, spears and dhāraṇī-spells, and in due course bathe behind an image of the Buddha.13 

In chapter 8, the Śrīparivarta,14 the goddess Śrī offers support to the Dharma preacher and good fortune to his audience. A rite which provides prosperity is described, through which Śrī herself enters that place. According to the ritual instructions, one’s home must be purified and one should bathe and wear clean garments. One should offer worship (pūjā) with perfumes, flowers and incense, then sprinkle juices (rasa) and utter the names of Śrī, Ratnakusuma Tathāgata15 and the Suvarṇaprabhāsa. One should then recite dhāraṇī-spells, draw a maṇ ḍala of cow-dung and offer perfumes, flowers and incense. Finally, a pure seat should be provided where Śrī descends and stays. 

As can be seen, chapters 7 and 8 contain ritual instructions primarily for securing health and wealth. These seem to be ancillary rites which accompany the ritual for the protection of the state taught in chapter 6. Interestingly, these rituals are actually more complex than those in the Caturmahārājaparivarta, where recitation is the main focus, potentially indicating a somewhat later date of composition. It is worth noting that chapters 9 and 10, the Dṛḍhāparivarta and Saṃjñāyaparivarta, also offer further support and protection but do not include detailed ritual instructions. 

4 Dhāraṇī Literature Presenting Rites for the Protection of the State 

Perhaps contemporaneous with the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra, there are at least three pieces of dhāraṇī literature proper which include detailed ritual instructions for the protection of the state: the Dhvajāgrakeyūradhāraṇī, Nārā yaṇaparipṛcchā/Mahāmāyāvijayavāhinīdhāraṇī and the Mahāsāhasrapramar

danasūtra.16 The former two are centered on this theme, while in the latter the defence of the state is included as one among various rituals. In all three cases the monarch is directly referred to as the beneficiary of the rites. 

The Dhvajāgrakeyūradhāraṇī17 was edited by Giunta (2008) based on an undated palm-leaf manuscript, and compared with the Tibetan translation by Jinamitra, Dānaśīla and Ye shes sde of circa 800CE.18 The Chinese translation by Dānapāla/Shi-hu dates to 982CE.19 The setting of this scripture is the celes tial Trāyastriṃśat abode where Śakra requests help from the Buddha after the gods have been defeated by the asuras, led by Vemacitrin. The lord tells Śakra to learn the invincible Dhvajāgrakeyūradhāraṇī, which he had come to know from Aparājitadhvaja Tathāgata during a previous existence. Then the Bhaga vān reveals the dhāraṇī and teaches that its user becomes victorious in battles and conflicts. The spell is to be fixed atop a banner (dhvajāgra) or around the neck, and protects kings (manuṣyarāja) or heroic people (śūrapuruṣa). Mani festing as a divine female, it stands in the frontline, providing fearlessness and protection, driving the enemy away as well as granting blessings and prosper ity.20 Following the main text, the manuscript incorporates the brief Dhvajā grakeyūrahṛdaya “spell-essence.” 

The Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā/Mahāmāyāvijayavāhinīdhāraṇī21 was edited, along with the Tibetan translation22 by Bstan pa’i nyin byed,23 by Banerjee (1941) on the basis of a palm-leaf manuscript dated to 1361CE. No Chinese translation seems to be available. The setting of this scripture is Mount Svar 

16 While the Chinese and Tibetan translations of these scriptures are relatively late, on the basis of language and terminology it seems that all three date to the first half of the first millennium. On the approximate antiquity of the Mahāsāhasrapramardanasūtra see Hidas 2013, 229. 

17 Cf. the Dhajagga-sutta in Pali (Saṃyutta-nikāya I.11.3), where the Buddha teaches that, just as Sakka encouraged the gods to behold his banner or that of other deities when experi encing fear in a battle against the asuras, monks experiencing dread should call to mind the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha.

ṇaśṛṅga,24 the mansion of Vaiśravaṇa, where Nārāyaṇa requests help from the Buddha upon defeat by the asuras, much like the Dhvajāgrakeyūradhāraṇī. The lord tells him that earlier, during the reign of King Ratnaśrī of Maga dha, there lived Sarveśvara Tathāgata, from whom the Bhagavān learned the Mahāmāyāvijayavāhinī spell. For hundreds of thousands of years that king ruled righteously by the power of this dhāraṇī. In his next existence he was born as Māndhātā, a bodhisattva and cakravartin king,25 who practiced char ity for sixty-four thousand kalpas and became a buddha. Then the lord tells Nārāyaṇa that this spell should be learnt, recited and taught to others. The dhāraṇī should be fixed upon five models of chariots and placed across the battlefield. Then the personified Queen of Spells (i.e. Mahāmāyāvijayavāhinī) should be visualized there as devouring the enemy.26 At midday the king should write down this incantation with saffron, after which he is to conquer the hos tile army.27 By reciting this dhāraṇī three times daily one is freed from even the five sins of immediate retribution, gains heaps of merit and shall be able to remember former existences. Laypeople, monastics, kings (rāja), princes (rājaputra), Brahmins and Dharma preachers are all promised to benefit from this spell. 

The Mahāsāhasrapramardanasūtra was edited in Iwamoto 1937 based pri marily on a paper manuscript from 1553 (CE28), while its rituals are studied in Hidas 2013. The Tibetan translation by Śīlendrabodhi, Jñānasiddhi, Śākya prabha and Ye shes sde dates to circa 800CE, and the Chinese one was com pleted by Dānapāla/Shi-hu in 983CE. The setting of this long and complex

scripture is Rājagṛha, where the Buddha and the Four Great Kings offer pro tection from calamities following an earthquake in Vaiśālī. Towards the end, this sūtra provides detailed instructions for several rituals, including one for the protection of the state. This prescribes that the royal residence (rājadhānī) should be cleaned and purified with flowers, incense and other offerings. Four maidens should be placed in the four directions with swords in their hands.29 The dhāraṇī should be recited and written on strips of cloth, mounted on the top of caityas, trees and banners. Recitation should continue for a fortnight, thus saving the state.30 

5 Dhāraṇī Literature Making General Reference to the Protection of the State 

Various examples of dhāraṇī literature, in the wider sense, include references to the defense of the state, while not being centered on this theme and lacking detailed ritual prescriptions. Schopen (1978: 363–367) lists the Bhaiṣajyagu rusūtra, Prajñāpāramitā, Ratnaketuparivarta, Sarvatathāgatādhiṣṭhānavyūha and Śrīmahādevīvyākaraṇa as relevant texts surviving among the Gilgit man uscripts (6th–7th centuries). The Bhaiṣajyagurusūtra claims that all distur bances to an anointed kṣatriya king, including hostile armed forces, shall cease by performing worship (pūjā). The Prajñāpāramitā teaches that those who study this text shall be protected in the battlefield. The Ratnaketuparivarta declares that those kings who commit this spell-text to writing shall not face any danger from an enemy’s army. If they raise the Ratnaketudhāraṇī on a banner they shall be victorious in battle. Paying reverence to the Sarvatathā gatādhiṣṭhānavyūha will cause victory for kings and queens in war and riots. Those monarchs who preserve the Śrīmahādevīstotra will face no calamities in their realm, and Śrī herself will reside in their homes.31 In addition to these scriptures, the Amoghapāśahṛdaya states that to protect one’s land from the enemy or calamities the ritually pure officiant should fill a vessel with vari ous substances, perform great pūjā and recitation; peace shall follow thus.32 The Amoghapāśakalparāja teaches a couple of methods for success in warfare.

By the use of a magical noose the army of the enemy and its weapons shall be bound.33 By encircling a sword the weapons of the enemy shall be broken and disabled.34 The Mahāpratisarāmahāvidyārājñī promises the destruction of hostile armies and victory in battle with the help of its dhāraṇī.35 This scrip ture includes a testimonial narrative in which King Brahmadatta overpowers the army of the enemy by fixing the spell upon his body before entering the battlefield.36 In another story it is Śakra who defeats the asuras with the help of this incantation.37 

6 The Characteristics of Buddhist Rituals for the Protection of the State in the First Half of the First Millennium 

As the passages above show, the protection of the state and acquiring safety in battle were recurring topics in Buddhist ritual literature from the early cen turies of the common era onwards. The target audience was primarily monar chs.38 Besides defence, the texts occasionally promise additional rewards as well, most commonly health and wealth. While these incantation scriptures principally aim at worldly goals, it is worth noting that in a few cases they promise a better future existence, such as rebirth as a bodhisattva. Even bud

36 Hidas 2012, 216–217. Note the setting similar to the Dhvajāgrakeyūradhāraṇī. 37 Hidas 2012, 227. 

38 Note that monarchs were also addressed in a highly elevated literary style by prominent Buddhist personalities such as Mātṛceta and Nāgārjuna in the first centuries CE (cf. e.g. Zimmermann 2006, 228–229, Sanderson 2009, 103–104, Bronkhorst 2011, 103–107). While works such as the Ratnāvalī lack the ritual instructions, as might be expected, their coun sel of righteous governance, however idealized, sometimes resonates with certain parts of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra.

dhahood is promised.39 These texts of both mainstream and Mahāyāna Bud dhism employ various ritual means, such as the use of mantra, dhāraṇī, maṇ ḍala and sīmābandha. It is difficult to suggest a precise chronology for the emergence of these scriptures and, for example, to estimate whether the grand Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra appeared first, with independent dhāraṇī texts following afterwards, or the reverse. What can be stated more or less with cer tainty is that all the aforementioned scriptures originate from the first half of the first millennium, but emerged over an uncertain interval of time. 

As far as actual users or evidence for the protection of the state in South Asia is concerned, only indirect information is available. Various Chinese sources refer to the successful use of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra in some Indian kingdoms as early as the first century CE, although these may only be legendary accountsfor the promotion of Buddhism in China.40 A more telling piece of evi dence, however, from the middle of the first millennium, is the Gilgit collection of manuscripts, where royal patronage and apotropaic literature are closely linked, albeit without surviving exemplars of the Sūtra of Golden Light.41 In the southern island of Sri Lanka, where monastics and worldly rulers were deeply interdependent for most of the centuries, we have no proof that the Sangha provided protection for the state or that the king used the above mentioned texts. There are however accounts from at least the fourth century CE onwards reporting the performance of paritta-recitals with the Ratanasutta in times of national calamities.42 Simultaneously, in East Asia we find plenty of direct evi

41 See von Hinüber 2014 and 2018.It is notable that in Bāṇa’s Harṣacarita (early-7th-century), the Mahāmāyūrī (surviving in Gilgit in numerous manuscript copies) is mentioned as being recited for healing at the royal palace: “So amid the salutations of the chamberlains he slowly entered the palace. There he found people bestowing all their goods in presents, worshipping the family gods, engaged in cooking the ambrosial posset, performing the Six Oblation sacrifice, offering tremulous Durvā leaves besmeared with clotted butter, chant ing the Mahā-Māyūrī hymn, purifying the household, completing the rites for keeping out the spirits by offerings. Earnest Brahmans were occupied in muttering Vedic texts; Śiva’s temple resounded with the murmur of the Hendecad to Rudra; Śaivas of great holiness were bathing Virūpākṣa’s image with thousands of vessels of milk.” (Cowell and Thomas 1897, 137). 

42 Gunawardana 1979, 226–227; Norman 1983, 174. On paritta texts, the Ratanasutta/Ratnasū tra tradition and its remodelling as the Mahāsāhasrapramardanasūtra see Skilling 1992. Cf. also Hidas 2013. On modern Thai amulet cultures incorporating the Ratanasutta see McDaniel 2014, 143–144. On Southeast Asian aspects and the recitation of the Mahādib bamanta before going to battle see Skilling 2007, 195, and for a detailed study of this text Jaini 1965. Note that Pali canonical sources acknowledge the efficacy of spells, but do not have a high opinion of them: in the Kevaṭṭasutta (Dīgha-nikāya 11) the Buddha teaches

dence for protective practices employing dhāraṇī texts. De Visser (1935), May (1967), Sango (2015) and Gummer (2015) provide a detailed picture how the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra was actually used for the defense of the emperor and the state. From these studies it becomes clear that Japanese ritual proce dures follow what is prescribed in the original Sanskrit remarkably closely;43 it thus appears that the ‘periphery’ preserves well what may have once been the norm in the native center of this tradition. 

7 The Continuity of Buddhist Rituals for the Protection of the State into Later Times 

From the second half of the first millennium CE, new types of Buddhist rit ual texts incorporated the theme of state protection in South Asia within the tantric traditions. Sanderson (2009, 105–106) refers to passages in the Sarvavaj rodaya of Ānandagarbha and the Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi of Dīpaṅkara bhadra (9th c.) being used for the protection of the monarch, in connection to rites of initiation. Sanderson (2009, 125) also observes that the Mañjuśriyamū lakalpa and Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra both offer protection to the ruler through royal consecration. In the latter text protection is accomplished by Vajradhara and the Four Great Kings, reflecting continuity with earlier sources. As for chronicled accounts of the protection of royal dynasties, Sanderson (2004, 238; 2009, 93–94) refers to Tāranātha’s history of Indian Buddhism, which reports that upon seeing omens of the future ruin of the Pāla dynasty, the eminent master Buddhajñānapāda of Vikramaśīla persuaded Dharmapāla (r. circa 775–812) to institute a regular fire-sacrifice at the monastery in order to protect his dynasty. The rituals lasted for many years at immense cost. In another reference to Tāranātha, Sanderson (2009, 107) notes that tantric rit uals were often performed to avert the enemy, especially Turuṣkas. Based on passages from the Mañjuśriyamūlakalpa and a grant by the Rāṣṭrakūṭa king Govinda III, dated to 805CE, Sanderson (2003–2004, 433–434 fn. 308) writes that “[t]he practice of going into battle with an image of one’s personal deity and the belief that this will protect one’s troops and confound those of the 

that monks who display supernatural powers in order to promote faith in the Bhagavān among people would be thought by some to have used incantations like the Gandhārīvijjā or Maṇikāvijjā to achieve these accomplishments, rather than the power of their contem plation. 

43 The Sūtra of Golden Light reached Japan as early as the end of the 6th century (Skjaervø 2004, xxxii).

enemy, is well attested in Indian Buddhist sources and in Far-Eastern sources derived from them.” A few texts of this period also pick up on the theme of pro tection in warfare. The Siddhaikavīratantra introduces mantric amulets worn on the body which, with help from enchanted swords, ensure victory in bat tle.44 The Laghusaṃvaratantra claims that one who enters the battlefield after reciting a certain mantra one thousand times towards the enemy cannot be hurt by weapons and obtains an indestructible vajra-body.45 Finally, one of the latest and most complex tantric scriptures in South Asia, the Kālacakratantra, mentions a number of war-machines ( yantra), presumably integrated into this religious text because of the imminent threatfromWestern ‘barbarian’ invaders in North India around the 11th century.46 

8 The Protection of the State in Modern Nepal 

As for recent practices in the Kathmandu Valley, there is evidence for the per formance of a royal ritual for protection involving Pañcarakṣā recitation in the era of Mahindra Vira Vikram Shah (r. 1955–1972). As the officiant, Ratnarāj Vajrācārya of Patan, kindly provided information, in 1962 he performed a cere mony in the royal palace for the protection of the monarch and his realm using this influential apotropaic collection.47 In this part of South Asia, few early manuscripts of the Suvarṇaprabhāsottama survive, though this sūtra became part of the renowned Navadharma collection of nine texts in medieval times.48 

44 Siddhaikavīratantra (Mikkyō Seiten Kenkyūkai. 1995, 7): kuṅkumādilikhitaṃ kaṇṭhe bāhau mantraṃ dhārayan saṃgrāme śastraṃ stambhayati; saṃgrāme ’nusmaran mantraṃ vija yaṃ labhate; khaḍgam abhimantrya saṃgrāme praviśaṃ jayam āsādayati. 

45 Laghusaṃvaratantra 12.4 (Pandey 2002): parasainyābhimukhaṃ sahasrajaptaṃ kṛtvā saṃgrāme vā prativiśati. śastraśatair hanyamānasya vyathā notpadyate. na ca śastrasa hasrair bhidyate. vajraśarīraṃ bhavati. On the formation of the concept of vajrakāya see Radich 2011.

The latter remarks that “[t]hese canonical works are not so much studied for their content as liturgically recited or put to other ritual uses.”

Various other scriptures of dhāraṇī literature, however, such as the Pañcarakṣā, are available in several old palm-leaf witnesses, and we have colophons from the wider region which indicate their use at the court.49

### 11 Adapting Śaiva Tantric Initiation for Exoteric Circles: The Lokadharmiṇī Dīkṣā and Its History in Early Medieval Sources 

Nina Mirnig 

1 Introduction 

A consistent concern in the study of early Śaivism is to understand the scope of the clientele texts were written for, and how representative this literature was of practices on the ground at given times. The methodological limita tions we face in exploring this largely prescriptive body of literature in relation to actual practice are notorious. Yet, in his seminal works on Śaiva religious history, Alexis Sanderson developed groundbreaking insights into the socio religious and political landscape in which the surviving texts were produced, reconstructing processes that led to the dominant position of Śaivism in the medieval Indic world. Thanks to his pioneering research, and that of other scholarswho have taken up the subject in the wake of his work, our understand ing of the relative chronology of Śaiva scriptures and medieval authors has also greatly improved.1 This increasingly enables us to investigate these materials historically, and thus to pursue questions of a socio-historical nature, which are at the heart of Sanderson’s work. In his own words (Sanderson 2005, 230), 

[…] it is possible, I would say necessary, to read the literature and inscrip tions with the sort of questions in mind that a social historian would wish to ask. 

For this felicitation volume, the present article is intended as a small contri bution of this kind, applying a social-historical approach to a certain form of Śaiva initiation, namely the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā. In essence, this denotes a form of initiation that is compatible with maintaining one’s socio-religious and rit ual obligations in society—the lokadharma.

Scholars familiar with tantric traditions know well that initiation (dīkṣā) is one of the core tantric rituals. As Goodall explains, tantric initiation was novel and different from earlier Indic forms of religious initiation, being not only “a preparation for a particular religious undertaking, but … also a transformative rite that purifies the soul.”2 This purification is achieved through an innova tive ritual technology, using the power of mantras to destroy an individual’s karmas and connected rebirths at all reality levels (tattvas). This enables the Śaiva Guru to free the bound soul of all ties, and to guide the candidate to a cosmic level where he can either realize liberation through union with the highest form of Śiva, if he is a liberation seeker (mumukṣu), or attain divine powers, if he is a seeker of supernatural powers and enjoyments (bubhukṣu). As such, tantric initiation confers spiritual benefits to the candidate a priori to his practice. It is thus arguably the most powerful tantric rite, designed in principle for practitioners who intend to devote their lives to the religion, as was probably the case in its original setting of esoteric, probably ascetic, cir cles. 

At the same time, we know from history that tantric Śaivism did not remain confined to the margins of society, but emerged as a religious movement which successfully interfaced with the mainstream, and gradually came to dominate the religious and socio-political discourse of the early medieval Indic world.3 As one would expect, this development is reflected in ritual and in changes to the constitution of the initiatory community, which by then encompassed not only ascetic practitionersfully devoted to Śaiva religious practice, but also brah manical householders. The increasing engagement with the mainstream led to the creation of exoteric forms of initiation, including versions that would con fer spiritual benefits without requiring the candidate to adopt a purely Śaiva ritual lifestyle. The most well-known example is the nirbījā dīkṣā (“initiation without the seed [of having to perform post-initiatory rites]”), which offers the candidate the highest soteriological goal of ultimate liberation at the time of death. However, according to the scriptures, such an initiation was only granted in special cases, namely when the candidates were considered unable to per form any kind of post-initiatory practice for special reasons. The list of such people classically comprises the king, but also the old, the young, the sick, and women.4

The other, lesser-known form of exoteric initiation is the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, which forms the subject of this paper. This term translates as “the initiation which contains/adheres to the lokadharma,” the lokadharma denoting the sphere of observance that Śaiva sources consistently define as the exoteric religion of śruti and smṛti, that is to say the domain of the brahmanical house holder.5 Unlike the nirbījā, access to the lokadharmiṇī initiation is not limited to specific groups, and in its original context, the initiation is mainly benefit oriented: a lokadharmī initiate is said to pursue mundane spiritual goals before attaining some kind of divine status. He does so by means of the merit procured through lay worship, and not through Śaiva rites that require the propitiation of mantras. This seemingly antithetical initiatory category is little discussed by Śaiva authors, probably precisely because of the doctrinal implications of such an initiation, which foregrounds a level of practice and spiritual goals that Śaivas claim to surpass. In the course of time, the lokadharmiṇī initiation underwent several shifts in application. These developments are deeply entan gled with the complex history of the system of initiatory categories, which was subject to processes of division and reassignment reflecting local and histor ical circumstances. A historical investigation into this form of exoteric Śaiva initiation therefore touches upon the larger issue of how tantric initiatory com munities related to the brahmanical mainstream, at various stages, after their emergence from esoteric ascetic circles. 

The first part of the paper investigates the lokadharmiṇī in its original set ting, as an initiation for Sādhakas, first by surveying the available sources and then by contextualizing them in the socio-religious setting of tantric Śaivism’s early stages. The second part will examine how this category of exoteric bubhu kṣu initiation is subsequently re-assigned to the sphere of the mumukṣu, thus becoming integrated into the Śaiva soteriological path, especially in the Jaya drathayāmala. The third section looks into the usage of the lokadharmī cate gory in the ritual manuals of the 11th–13th centuries, particularly sources from the South, tracing how in some works, notably the Jñānaratnāvalī, there is another shift in usage: the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā comes to denote a regular Śaiva initiation for the householder, as opposed to the ascetic, who receives a śiva dharmiṇī dīkṣā. The final section reflects upon how the initiatory category of the lokadharmiṇī fits within the larger context of tantric Śaivism’s development in medieval India.

2 The Original lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā as a Form of Sādhaka Initiation: Sources and Mechanics 

The earliest sources that mention a lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā—always as the counter part of the śivadharmiṇīdīkṣā—feature it as aform of Sādhaka initiation6 in the domain of the bubhukṣu, i.e. the seeker of power and enjoyment, as opposed to the liberation-seeker (mumukṣu). The first extant text to feature the loka dharmiṇī is the Svacchanda. In its fourth chapter, dedicated in its entirety to initiation, the text gives an overview of all the initiation categories, dividing the initiatory community into mumukṣus and bubhukṣus. The former may receive either a sabījā or nirbījā initiation, and the latter a śivadharmiṇī or lokadha rmiṇī initiation.7 Of these, the śivadharmī Sādhaka is the Śaiva Sādhaka proper, who through initiation gains the ability to propitiate Śaiva mantras in order to attain benefits and supernatural powers, while the lokadharmī Sādhaka is his exoteric counterpart, seeking enjoyments and spiritual benefits through mun dane religious acts rather than mantras: 

The Sādhaka is of two kinds. On the one hand, there is the śivadharmī, for whom the cosmic path is purified by Śaiva mantras and who is yoked to [particular] mantras that are to be mastered; he is knowledgeable, consecrated [to office], and devoted to the propitiation of mantras. This Śaiva Sādhaka is capable [of mastering] the threefold supernatural pow ers.8 The second [kind of Sādhaka] adheres to the mundane path and 

6 Brunner, in her 1975 paper dedicated to the figure of the Sādhaka, also outlines many of the general features of the Śaiva Sādhaka’s initiation and practice thereafter. She does, however, not treat the lokadharmiṇī kind of initiation at length. 

7 Svacchandatantra 4. 79b–81b: atha dīkṣādhvaśuddhyarthaṃ bhuktimuktiphalārthinām || vi dhānam ucyate sūkṣmaṃ pāśavicchittikārakam | guruḥ saṃpṛcchate śiṣyaṃ dvividhaṃ pha lakāṅkṣiṇam || phalam ākāṅkṣase yādṛk tādṛk sādhanam ārabhe |, “Next there is the initiation for the purpose of the purification of the cosmic path (adhvan) for those who seek the fruit of [either] enjoyment or liberation. The subtle method that causes the cutting of the bonds is explained. The Guru asks the candidate seeking benefits [about] the two-fold [option]. Whatever fruit he desires, accordingly he should start the propitiation of Mantras.” 

8 This may be a reference to the old classification of siddhis into three kinds, which goes back to early sources such as the Niśvāsa and Buddhist Kriyātantras, as Goodall (2014, 16 and 80– 82) discusses. Thus, in the Niśvāsa Guhyasūtra three levels of siddhi can be attained after preparing some potion. Which kind of siddhi has been obtained can be deduced from the manifestation of heat, if the power is to cover great distances on foot, the manifestation of smoke if he is to have the power to disappear, and the manifestation of flames if he is to have the power to walk through the sky (Goodall 2013, 81). For more on siddhi-practices in Tantric Śaivism, see Vasudeva 2012.

is devoted to the performance of good and meritorious works (iṣṭāpūr tavidhau); desiring the fruits produced by [his] karma, he abides solely [devoted to] meritorious [karma], free of the unmeritorious. [The Guru] should always perform the destruction of the unmeritorious portion [of the candidate’s karma] with mantras.9 

Kṣemarāja, in his commentary, further specifies that meritorious acts in the case of the lokadharmī consist of bathing at sacred places, providing food and building wells, tanks and monasteries.10 These are precisely the kinds of reli gious activity that we would expect of an ordinary lay worshipper. As we see in this passage, what the lokadharmiṇī initiation does is to enhance the initi ate’s spiritual benefits by destroying bad karma connected to all reality levels, leaving only good karma and its positive outcomes in place. 

This function of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā is reiterated later in the chapter, when the text explains how the two kinds of bubhukṣu initiations differ from that of themumukṣu. These differences concern two points:11 firstly, the portion of karma that is purified and thus removed for the candidate; and second, the cosmic level at which the candidate is united with the respective deity upon initiation’s conclusion: 

Next, he should then bring about destruction of the past and future karma for the liberation-seeker (mumukṣu), because of his indifference [to the world]. He should not purify the one [part of karma] that is the prāra bdha [karma], [which fuels his present existence]. But for the Sādhaka, he should purify [only] one [part of the] past karma for the purpose of power,12 and having manifested the past and future karma together (ekastham), he should initiate [the candidate]. This is the śivadharmiṇī dīkṣā. The

The sacred rites (iṣṭam) [consist of] such actions as bathing at a sacred site and giving away food. The meritorious acts (pūrta) are [the donations and setting up of] such things as wells, tanks and monasteries for ascetics.”

other form [of bubhukṣu initiation] is the lokadharmiṇī, which destroys both past and future demerit. That lokadharmiṇī [dīkṣā] is known to exclude the obligation to propitiate mantras [by means of purvasevā etc.]. However, when the current body breaks, [the candidate] expe riences [the series of eight supernatural natural powers] starting with becoming very small (aṇimā). Having experienced [these] enjoyments he moves upwards to whichever [cosmic level] the Guru has joined him [by yojanikā]. Whether this is at the sakala or niṣkala level [of Śiva] depends on [the preference of] the candidate and Guru.13 

Thus, we learn that the lokadharmī candidate can be united with any deity of any cosmic level at the end of the procedure, and could even choose to be united with the highest, niṣkala form of Śiva, a form of union synonymous with the state of ultimate liberation. In addition, while the lokadharmī initiate can not propitiate Śaiva mantras, unlike the Sādhaka, he is nevertheless granted supernatural powers, which are usually said to result from mantra practice; the difference is that he experiences these powers after death. 

Regarding the śivadharmiṇī dīkṣā, we note that there is some difficulty inter preting how karma is held to be eliminated at this point. As evident from the translation, the problematic phrase is 142ab, sādhakasya tu bhūtyarthaṃ prākkarmaikaṃ tu śodhayet; this is supposed to define the difference in proce dure from the nirvāṇadīkṣā of the mumukṣu, for whom only prārabdha karma, the karma that fuels the current life, is to be preserved.14 Looking at the differ ent treatments of this phrase, we find that commentators disagree on whether or not any additional karmic bonds are excluded from purification—and in effect, whether the dīkṣā of the Sādhaka is very close to that of the mumukṣu Putraka or not. Kṣemarāja, in his commentary, wants to see a clear difference, and interprets this passage to indicate that two kinds of karma are excluded from purification, in case of the Sādhaka, namely (1) the karma that is nec essary for the attainment of supernatural powers (i.e. bhūtyarthaṃ), without

making explicit what that means,15 and (2) the good portion of the prārab dha karma, which ensures the success of the siddhi practice by preventing its being blocked by bad karma.16 On the other hand, Abhinavagupta, when adopting this passage in his Tantrāloka, as discussed below, drops pādas 142cd and rephrases 142ab as prākkarmetthaṃ tu śodhayet, “He should purify the past karma in the same way [as in the case for the mumukṣu]”—thus indicating that for him, the procedure for the Sādhaka is exactly the same as for the mumukṣu Putraka, except that the prārabdha karma is directed towards supernatural powers rather than liberation. In his commentary on this passage, Jayaratha, in turn, criticizes Kṣemarāja’s reading of ekam instead of ittham, undermining his understanding that the bad portion of the prārabdha karma is destroyed, instead saying that neither is it possible to remove any part of the prārabdha karma, since this fuels the current life force, nor does this interpretation have scriptural support.17 At the same time, he remains silent about the fact that the text teaches the removal of only the bad karma in case of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā.18 

15 Kṣemarāja ad Svacchanda 4.142a (sādhakasya tu bhūtyarthaṃ): bhūtiproyojanaṃ bhāvi mantrārādhanarūpaṃ yat tad api na śodhayed ity arthaḥ, “He should not purify the [por tion of karma] which is for the future propitiation of mantras for the purpose of super natural powers; this is the meaning.” 

16 Kṣemarāja ad Svacchanda 4.142b (prākkarmaikaṃ tu śodhayet): bhūtyarthād yat prāg dehārambhi śubhāśubhaṃ tata ekam aśubham evāsya śodhayet, evaṃ hi nirvighnaṃ bho gasiddhir bhavati || yat tu janmāntarasaṃcitaṃ śubhāśubhaṃ yac cāsmiñ janmani kari ṣyati, tat sarvam uktanītyā mantrārādhanavarjam asya putrakavac chodhyam evety āha, “For the purpose of supernatural powers, from the past pure and impure [karma] that maintains the [current] body (i.e. the prārabdha karma) he should only purify the impure [portion] for him, for in this way (evam) the achievement of enjoyment comes about with out any obstacles. As for the pure and impure [karma] that is accumulated in other [past] births and which he will do in a [future] birth, all those should be purified for him accord ing to the proclaimed procedure, like in the case of the Putraka, apart from [those karmas for] the propitiation of mantras (mantrārādhanavarjam). Therefore he said, [prākkar māgāmi caikasthaṃ bhāvayitvā ca dīkṣayet (Svacchanda 4.142cd)].” 

17 Jayaratha ad Tantrāloka 15.28: sādhakasya ca ittham eva karmaśodhanaṃ, kiṃ tu tat bhū tyarthaṃ, tasya hi bhogaunmukhyāt tadvāsanābhedāt phalabheda iti pratijñāto ’pi artho nirvāhitaḥ | yad uktaṃ“sādhakasyatu bhūrtyarthaṃ prākkarmetthaṃtu śodhayet | prākka rmāgāmi (corr.

18 A similar problem of interpretation also occurs in the passage of the Mṛgendra, which outlines the superior and the inferior bhautikī dīkṣā, the former being the śivadharmiṇī and the latter the lokadharmiṇī. This passage appears to say that for the superior kind, i.e. the śivadharmiṇī, along with the prārabdha karma some undefined additional karma is

Another early source which distinguishes between the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā is the Mṛgendra, which was composed after the Svaccha nda. This scripture maintains the same basic set of categories and organiza tion of initiatory groups, even though it uses slightly different terminology. Thus, instead of referring to initiations for the mumukṣu and the bubhukṣu, the Mṛgendra uses the terms naiṣṭhikī and bhautikī,19 the former of which is divided into the sāpekṣā and nirapekṣā,20 corresponding to the sabījā/nirbījā distinction, and the latter again into śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī, for which we find the following description: 

preserved for the success of the siddhi practice (śaivasādhanasādhyena), perhaps similar to Kṣemarāja’s bhūtyartham category. Mṛgendra 8.1146–148:evam eva kriyāyogād bhautiky api parāparā | kiṃ tu dehāviyogārthaṃ prārabdhaṃ karma dehinaḥ || śaivasādhanasā dhyena saṃdhāya paripālayet | sānubandhaṃ dahed anyad dīpte dīkṣāhutāśane || kaṣṭā kaṣṭapadāntasthe sādhake pañcakeśvare | yogo ’syātmikadeśinyām anyasyām iṣṭavigrahe || (for a translation, see Brunner 1985, 258). However, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, comment ing on this passage, is against such an interpretation, and rather awkwardly interprets śaivasādhanasādhyena to refer to the post-initiatory discipline that the Sādhaka is to carry out, which would seem odd given that such post-initiatory practice is also to be carried out by the mumukṣu: … prārabdhaṃ karma prārabdhakāryaṃ dehinaḥ jantoḥ dehāviyogā rthaṃ śarīrapātasaṃrakṣārthaṃ śaivasādhanasādhyena samayācārapālanena saṃdhāya saṃyojya paripālayet rakṣayet. (For a translation, see Brunner 1985, 286). 

19 That the terms bhautikī and naitṣṭhikī correspond at this point to the initiations for the bubhukṣu and mumukṣu respectively, is suggested by the commentary of Nārāyaṇakaṇ ṭha (ad Mṛgendra, Kriyāpāda 2: niṣṭhā kaivalyam. te bhūtiniṣṭhe prayojanaṃ yayos te tathā. bhautikī bhūtikāmasya. niṣṭhārthino naiṣṭḥikī nairvāṇikīty arthaḥ), which also Brunner fol lows in her translation, translating bhautikī as “donneuse de jouissance” and naiṣṭhikī as “donneuse de liberation” (Brunner 1985, 199). Further, from later passages it is clear that the bhautikī is equated with the Sādhaka; e.g. in Mṛgendra, Caryāpāda 11, where the loka dharmiṇī is even referred to as a Sādhaka. As such, this division of the Mṛgendra would reproduce the same structure as we found it in the Svacchanda; but internally we have to note that the category of the bhautikī and the naiṣṭhikī, if taken in this manner, don’t overlap with what in the Cāryapāda of the Mṛgendra is described as bhautikavratins and naiṣṭhikavratins, as Brunner (1985, 347, note 2) already points out. Thus, here, the bhau tikavratin, i.e. one who has a temporary vrata, and the naiṣṭhikavratin, who has a perma nent vrata, are both opposed to those who have no vrata at all (avrata), a category which, in turn, includes the lokadharmī sādhaka featuring under the bhautikī dīkṣā. However, it may be that the Mṛgendra is simply not entirely consistent. Interpretative problems appear also in other places regarding the definitions and procedures for the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī, and similarly, perhaps confusion also remains on the bhautikī and naiṣṭhikī distinction. Goodall also draws attention to the difficulties in interpreting the terms naitṣṭhika and bhautika in his entry on the term naiṣṭhika in Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. III. 

20 However, note that in her English summary it seems that Brunner (1985, 481–482) applies the divisions of sāpekṣā and nirapekṣā to both the naiṣṭhikī and bhautikī. 
 

The śivadharmiṇī [initiation] is the root of success for the fruits of the Śaiva religion for the individual soul. There is another [kind of śiva dharmiṇī] taught without the destruction of the body, up until the disso lution of the world.21 The remaining one is taught to be the lokadharmiṇī, for the purpose of [attaining the eightfold supernatural powers] starting with aṇimā after the current life, after all the bad portions [of karma] were destroyed at all reality levels.22 

While the description of the śivadharmīṇī initiation differs somewhat, imply ing that there are two levels of Śaiva Sādhaka,23 the explanation of the loka dharmiṇī resonates much with what we found in the Svacchanda, namely that all bad karma is destroyed and the initiate attains supernatural powers after death. Regarding the end point of union for the lokadharmī candidate, the Mṛgendra offers a choice similar to that of the Svacchanda, namely that the candidate is either lifted up to the cosmic level of his choice and absorbs the applicable deity’s divine powers, or that he is united with the highest form of Śiva, for liberation: 

Having lifted up the lokadharmī to [the cosmic level of] the deity he desires, he should cause [this deity’s] qualities to be present in the can didate, or, for those desirous of liberation, [join him] in Śiva. He should establish the [regent] who is at the top of the [respective] path,24 together with his powers, recite the OṂ at the end of the mantra, and then join [him with the deity], while remaining untouched by unmeritorious [karma].25 

21 See below, note 23. 

22 Mṛgendra, Kriyāpāda 8.6–7: śivadharmiṇy aṇor mūlaṃ śivadharmaphalaśriyaḥ | hitetarā vinā bhaṅgaṃ tanor ā vilayād bhuvām || bhogabhūmiṣu sarvāsu duṣkṛtāṃśe hate sati | dehottarāṇimādyarthaṃ śiṣṭeṣṭā lokadharmiṇī ||. 

23 The definition of the śivadharmiṇī appears more general here, in comparison to the Svac chanda, since the śivadharmiṇī bhautikī initiation is simply said to confer the fruits rooted in the Śaiva religion, presumably through the propitiation of Śaiva mantras. In addition, the Mṛgendra also teaches a special version of the śivadharmiṇī, in which the candidate attains the ability to keep his body until the end of dissolution, the form of the śiva dharmī that Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha declares to be the superior one (see Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha ad Mṛgendra 8.6b: itarā dvitīyā śivadharmiṇy eva tanoḥ bhaṅgaṃ vinā hitā vihitā śreyas sādhikā.).

However, the Mṛgendra goes even further than the Svacchanda and makes explicit that this procedure can also be applied in case a candidate wishes to be united with a non-Śaiva brahmanical deity: 

In exactly the same way (evam eva), [the Guru] may guide a devotee to union [with a deity such as] Ambikā, Sūrya, Smara, Viṣṇu or Brahmā, after having purified that path [up to the cosmic level of the desired deity] [of all bad karma]. And the same procedure (evam eva hi) [is applicable] for any other deity that is on the path [that the devotee wishes to be united with].26 

As for the mode of religious practice of the lokadharmī, we learn in the Caryā pāda of the Mṛgendra that the lokadharmī is avrata,27 presumably referring to 

26 Mṛgendra, Kriyāpāda 8.151–152b: evam evāmbikāsūryasmaraviṣṇuprajāsṛjām | sāyujyaṃ bhaktimān neyas tad adhvani viśodhite || mārgasthānāṃ pareṣāṃ ca devānām evam eva hi |. 

27 Mṛgendra, Caryāpāda 11: sādhako lokadharmī yaḥ putrakaḥ snātako gṛhī | samayī prāg gṛhasthaś ca śaivāḥ syur vratavarjitāḥ ||, “The lokadharmī Sādhaka, a Putraka who is a married householder, a Samayin and someone who was previously a householder [and had become a saṃnyāsin] are Śaivas without vratas.” (I follow Brunner (1985, 349) here in sep arating the Samayin and pṛāggṛhastha, i.e. one who was previously a householder, as two kinds of initiates intended here; Kṣemarāja also interprets the passage thus. However, as Brunner already points out, this category makes little sense in the present context.) See Kṣemarāja ad loc.: sādhakasya śivadharmilaukikadharmibhedād dvaividhye sati loka dharmī yaḥ sādhakaḥ, putrakaḥ, tathā snātako gṛhī gṛhasthatve sati snātaḥ, samayī, prāg gṛhasthaḥ pūrvaṃ gṛhasthaś cety ete vratavarjitā jñeyāḥ | prāggṛhasthaś ca ity uttarakālaṃ gārhasthyatyāgāpekṣayā | yataḥ sambhavanti kecana ājīvanam ujjhitagṛhāvasthitayaḥ | tadvailakṣaṇyārthaṃ prāggṛhasthagrahaṇam ||. As Brunner (1985, 350, note 5) argues, vrata appears here to refer to a Śaiva observance with mantras, as in the Svacchanda, perhaps combined with an abstinent ascetic lifestyle, rather than to the performance of a Śaiva post-initiatory discipline as a whole; this is indicated by the fact that the loka dharmī is mentioned here next to the Putraka who is a snātaka and thus married, the Putraka who is a head of the household, the Samayin, and someone who is the head of the household, though this last category is dubious. In any case, of those we can expect that at least the Samayin and the married Putraka—unless he received a nirbījā initiation— would have had to comply with the samayas. On the other hand, the other interpretation of vrata above would fit for all those cases, since such an ascetic lifestyle would not be appropriate for the married Putraka, and the Samayin would perhaps not be considered able yet to do so given his neophyte status. Nevertheless, there appears also to be the possibility of becoming a bhautikavratin with a temporary vrata, in which case the practi tioner is instructed to reject the paraphernalia he received for the practice and offer them back to the deity after the successful outcome of his vrata (see Mṛgendra, Caryāpāda 9b– 10).

his not being able to perform religious observances involving propitiation of mantras, just as we have seen in the Svacchanda. 

Aside from the Svacchanda and the Mṛgendra, there is one more scrip ture that features the lokadharmiṇī as a type of Sādhaka initiation, namely the Tantrasadbhāva. However, this scripture does not provide any details con cerning the lokadharmiṇī; it mentions this initiatory category only for the sake of completeness while introducing the śivadharmiṇī dīkṣā, here also called vidyādīkṣā,28 as the initiation undertaken by the Śaiva Sādhaka before receiv ing consecration.29 

The lokadharmiṇī/śivadharmiṇī distinction between Sādhaka initiations is carried over into Abhinavagupta’s early-11th-century Tantrāloka,30 since Abhi navagupta incorporates the Svacchanda passage into his work, somewhat mod

ified.31 However, Abhinavagupta does not deal with the śivadharmī/lokadharmī Sādhaka distinction beyond quoting this passage. On the other hand, Jayaratha returns to this division among bubhukṣus in his commentary on the 13th chap ter, which is dedicated to the different degrees of śaktipāta, the descent of Śiva’s divine power upon souls, which causes them to seek initiation. In this chapter, Abhinavagupta ranks the intensity of śaktipāta, relating each degree— from highest, middle, and lowest, each further divided into three levels—to a certain kind of initiatory category. The principle is that the more intense the descent of power, the more immediate is the candidate’s final liberation; and by this criteria he is to receive the appropriate form of initiation.32 On this scale, the enjoyment-seeking bubhukṣu is at the lower end, but Abhinava gupta himself does not make explicit how he correlates different degrees of śaktipāta to the śivadharmī and lokadharmī initiates. Rather, he restricts him self to the bubhukṣu, assigning the middle (madhya-madhya śaktipāta) and lower levels (manda-madhya śaktipāta) of the middling kind of śaktipāta to two unspecified categories thereof. Of those, the middle level is for the bubhu kṣu who attains Śivahood after enjoying the siddhis of his respective tattva,33 and the lower level for the bubhukṣu who enjoys siddhis in his subsequent

The purification of only the bad karma, and not the mer itorious, is the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, which is without the worship of mantras.

rebirth and only attains union with Śiva after that.34 In his analysis of this chapter, Takashima (1992, 73) points out that the śivadharmiṇī and the loka dharmiṇī division would fit these two respective levels well, yet Jayaratha’s commentary nonetheless interprets these differently. He instead equates the two levels of bubhukṣu with two levels of the śivadharmī Sādhaka, a distinc tion encountered in the Mṛgendra passage above, which spoke of an ordinary Sādhaka and one who retains his body until the time of cosmic dissolution.35 It is of course not clear whether Jayaratha had precisely this distinction in mind, but be that as it may, by assigning these two levels to the śivadharmiṇī category, Jayaratha frees up the category of the lokadharmī Sādhaka to cover the three remaining, lowest levels of śaktipāta, which are concerned appro priately with practices focused on worldly enjoyments.36 In order to create three levels of lokadharmī, he uses the following distinctions, according to which the way to liberation is increasingly remote: the highest (tīvra-manda śaktipāta) concerns the lokadharmī who automatically attains Śivahood after an interval of of some period, which he spends in a desired cosmic level— a category of lokadharmī Jayaratha equates with the standard form we have so far encountered;37 the second highest (madhya-manda śaktipāta) concerns the lokadharmī who is initiated again in another world before reaching libera tion;38 and the third (manda-manda śaktipāta) concerns the lokadharmī who first experiences enjoyments for a very long period, as well as different levels of proximity to the deity (sālokyasāmīpyasāyujyāsādanakrameṇa)39 of the cho

(2013, 249–250 and note 167) dis cuss, an example of a “lower” level of liberation, associated with paurāṇic spiritual goals, is to become a gaṇapati, or chief attendant, of the lord, thus experiencing being in the same world (sālokya) as the Lord or in his vicinity (sāmīpya)—spiritual goals, as the authors point out, which are also expressed in the lay literature of early medieval India, such as the old Skandapurāṇa and Śivadharmaśāstra.

sen universe, and only then receives initiation again, through which he attains Śivahood.40 In creating these different levels, Jayaratha might have had a sys tem similar to the Mṛgendra in mind, where we also found various levels of lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, whose recipients range from those seeking final liberation to those who want to be united with and experience enjoyments related to a non-Śaiva deity.41 

3 Tracing the Socio-historical Context of the Emergence of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā 

Thus, to sum up, the following five features consistently appear in descriptions of the lokadharmī initiate: 

1. His source of merit lies in lay religion, the lokadharma, namely what is taught in śruti and smṛti. 

2. During initiation all the bad karma connected with any level of reality is to be purified, leaving good karma intact to be enjoyed by the initi ate. 

3. He is not entitled to perform the propitiation of mantras (mantrārā dhana). 

4. He experiences supernatural powers after death. 

5. He can choose whether he eventually attains ultimate liberation, or instead union with any deity of the cosmos he wishes; in the case of the Mṛgendra these include even non-Śaiva, brahmanical deities. 

For obvious reasons, this initiatory category is difficult to positionwithin a Śaiva doctrinal framework, for it offers not only enhanced merit through destruction of all bad karma, but also attainment of any cosmic level, including libera tion, without the commitment to perform Śaiva ritual with mantras. In this light, even the very label “Sādhaka” to such a candidate appears inappropriate, given the Sādhaka’s paradigmatic association with seeking supernatural attain ments through the power of mantras. Perhaps with this hesitation in mind, 

40 Jayaratha ad Tantrāloka 13.246: mandamandaśaktipātavān punas tatraiva sālokyasāmī pyasāyujyāsādanakrameṇa cirataraṃ kālaṃ bhogān bhuktvā, tata eva dīkṣām āsādya śiva tām iyat. See also Takashima (1992, 73), who has a slightly different interpretation of the sālokyasāmīpyasāyujyāsādhanakrameṇa, taking it to denote “various stages of enjoy ment.” 

41 Cf. pp. 257–256. Note that in his conclusion, Takashima (1992, 74–75) proposes that Abhi navagupta intended the manda level of śaktipāta for those who only received samaya dīkṣā, contrary to Jayaratha’s interpretation of different levels of lokadharmī initiates. 
 

adapting śaiva tantric initiation 263 

Kṣemarāja ad Svacchanda 4.85, offers a weak explanation for the lokadharmī being called a Sādhaka, leaning on the meaning of the underlying verbal root “sādh-,” “to be successful, achieve;” he says that the lokadharmī is referred to as a Sādhaka “because he achieves (sādhanāt) the fruit by his pious acts alone.”42 One could argue that a stronger reason to refer to the lokadharmī as a Sādhaka is that he will experience supernatural powers, like the Śaiva Sādhaka, except that he does so after death. Yet this addition to the professed outcome of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā seems almost to be a doctrinal elaboration added to war rant its place among Sādhaka initiations. Another sign that the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā held a doctrinally difficult position might be the meager commentary these passages receive. Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha, for instance, restricts himself to rather self-explanatory comments on the entire lokadharmiṇī passage in the Mṛgendra. 

Regardless of this awkward near-silence, at least for these scriptural sources and Kashmirian Śaiva authors, such an initiatory category appears to have been a social reality that needed to be accommodated and acknowledged. In addi tion to the sources discussed, the lokadharmiṇī/śivadharmiṇī distinction also features in a fourteenth century Kashmirian initiation manual, the Kalādīkṣā paddhati of Mānodatta,43 and Kṣemarāja introduces these initiatory categories into his commentary on the Netratantra, even though the root text itself does not contain them.44 Additionally, we have seen how Jayaratha uses the category of the lokadharmī Sādhaka to speak of initiates who pursue mundane spiritual goals, giving the impression that there exists a wide range of lokadharmī initi ates with different degrees of involvement in the Śaiva religion, similar to the model in the Mṛgendra. 

However, the question remains why such an initiatory category, which seems so counter-intuitive and difficult to justify doctrinally, came into existence in the first place. From a socio-historical perspective, the creation of a bubhukṣu orientated exoteric form of Śaiva initiation appears to be connected to the position of tantric communities in an early phase, when the sphere of the

For more information on Manodatta’s work, see Sanderson 2004, 362, note 34.

power-seeking practitioner had a more prominent role. Brunner (1975, 439) long ago noted that the Svacchanda and the Mṛgendra—both of which contain the lokadharmiṇī, as we have seen—appear to preserve a comparatively promi nent position for the power-seeking Sādhaka, which she suspects harkens back to an early phase of the tantric traditions, when the gulf between soteriological and power-orientated goals was not so vast. Her hypothesis finds confirmation in findings of the past decade, particularly those resulting from study of the Niś vāsatattvasaṃhitā (Goodall et al. 2015). As the earliest extant Śaiva tantra, the Niśvāsa affords important insights into the early stages of the “tantric age,”45 particularly in that—as Goodall points out—it envisages a time when tantric communities appear to have been restricted to limited esoteric circles46 with much focus on the propitiation of mantras for magical purposes, which were pursued prior to liberation. He further observes that the classical fourfold hier archy of Samayin, Putraka, Ācārya and Sādhaka is entirely absent at this stage, with all practitioners simply referred to as Sādhakas—a category of initiates associated with the utilization of mantras for both supernatural powers and liberation. The community had not yet been divided into those who sought one to the exclusion of the other.47 That the pursuit of power and soteriological goals belonged to the same spiritual path is reflected in the Niśvāsa’s initiation system, which teaches rites of two types, namely vidyādīkṣā,48 through which a candidate is admitted to the community and becomes a Sādhakawith authority to propitiate mantras, and themuktidīkṣā, through which the confirmed Sādha ka attains liberation.49 Of neither initiation is there an exoteric form at this stage.50 

Theoretical repercussions caused by separating the liberation- and power seekers’ goals are visible, for instance, in the ambiguous treatment of karma’s 

45 The Niśvāsa is the earliest extant tantric scripture, preserving a stage of the development of tantric communities where non-tantric, Atimārgic roots are often visible, as Sanderson (2006) observed. 

46 On the absence of the domain of social ritual in the Niśvāsa, see Goodall et al. 2015, 47. 47 See Goodall et al. 2015, 47–50. As for all initiates probably being referred to as sādhakas at this stage, see also Goodall et al. 2015, 281. 

48 See Goodall et al. 2015, 50. And, in fact, the dīkṣā for the Sādhaka is sometimes referred to as vidyādīkṣā, as in the Tantrasadbhāva. For more see Goodall’s entry nirvāṇadīkṣā in Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. III. 

49 See Goodall et al. 2015, 280–282, 289. However, Goodall also notes that this interpretation that any initiate takes first the vidyādīkṣā and then the muktidīkṣā is a working hypothesis at the moment, not completely excluding the possibility that these may be two separate modes of initiation, which at the same time seems less likely.

elimination during the initiation ritual for the Śaiva Sādhaka.51 Nevertheless, we find that the status and centrality of the “original” Sādhaka’s position and practices are preserved in most early tantric scriptures, even after the commu nity came to be divided into different initiatory ranks, and centered around the Ācārya and liberation-seekers. It is tempting to conclude that the creation of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā is directly connected to this early sphere of tantric religion, which put so much emphasis on the pursuit of magical powers and benefits. While in due course Śaiva literature grew to put more emphasis on the soteriological aspirations of the mumukṣu—reflected in the fact that the soteriological-orientated nirbījā dīkṣā has a more prominent role—the attrac tion of the powers and benefits gained through mantras must nonetheless have played an important role in the initial popularization of tantric groups. For the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā would hold obvious attractions for laypeople desiring to enhance the fruits of their current practice without committing to the dis ciplinary regimen of tantric Śaiva ritual. Another appealing aspect may have been that through this initiation, a lokadharmī became part of the initiatory community and perhaps privy to services accessible only to initiates, especially those offered by Śaiva Sādhakas. That broadening access to initiation may have played an important role in popularizing tantric Śaivism at an early stage is suggested by the fact that the Mṛgendra extends the scope of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā to those who are not even Śiva-worshippers, people who may nonetheless have desired specific services distinctive to the Śaiva tantric domain. However, the doctrinally awkward position of the lokadharmī Sādhaka, combined with the increasing emphasis on purely soteriological goals, may have led to the gradual oblivion of this category, causing its reassignment in later sources, as will be seen below. 

51 See ibid., pp. 254ff. I am not aware of an established, coherent theory on what kind of karma needs to be left in place in order to pursue supernatural powers. But note that—in quite a different context—the idea that the success of a Sādhaka’s practice is intertwined with his karmic position is also found in the Brahmayāmala. In his analysis of the chapters on the Sādhaka, Kiss shows how the Brahmayāmala teaches complex mechanics under lying a logic of karma, according to which the level of a Sādhaka’s practice is dependent on actions in past births and on whether he had received initiation in a past life, as well as special rituals to remove karmic bonds that would block the success of the Sādhaka’s practice (see Kiss 2015, 35–55, in particular 52–53 concerning the rites to remove karmic bonds). 
 

266 mirnig 4 The lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā in the Context of the nirvāṇadīkṣā 

The two other early Śaiva scriptures which make a distinction between śiva dharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī initiations are the Jayadrathayāmala52 and the rather later Bṛhatkālottara, both composed after the Svacchanda, and in the latter case certainly after the Mṛgendra as well. However, in both of these works the association of these initiatory categories with the Sādhaka gets lost; they become reassigned to the context of nirvāṇadīkṣā, the initiation for those seeking liberation rather than supernatural powers and enjoyments. However, unlike the Bṛhatkālottara, the Jayadrathayāmala preserves in part the origi nal logic of karma-elimination seen in the bubhukṣu category of lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, despite this reassignment. 

In the Jayadrathayāmala we find both of the initiatory categories in ques tion—here referred to as śivadharmadīkṣā and lokadharmadīkṣā—in the description of initiation types53 outlined in the first ṣaṭka. This is the por tion of the text which Sanderson (2007, 235–236) identifies as its oldest layer, deriving originally from a work called the Śiraścheda. Unlike the Svacchanda and Mṛgendra, the Jayadrathayāmala does not here employ the broad divi sion between the mumukṣu and bubhukṣu in its exposition of initiatory cat egories, but rather makes a distinction between an initiation that bestows adhikāra, that is to say the authority to perform certain rituals,54 and those that bestow liberation (mokṣadā).55 In presenting the latter, the nirvāṇadīkṣā, the

53 The immediate context here is Devī’s question to Bhairava about the number of initiatory categories as well as the issue whether the initiatory procedure is the same for all four caste-classes. 

54 The passage is problematic, and it is not specified what exactly is intended by the category of adhikāradā initiations. We may hypothesise that this refers to a kind of initiation that bestows to Śaiva office holders—i.e. the Ācārya and the Sādhaka—entitlement (adhikāra) to perform rituals for others. See Goodall’s entry on niradhikāradīkṣā in Tāntrikābhi dhānakośa, vol. III. See also note 83 for an example of the pair adhikāradā and niradhi kāradā dīkṣā in a list of initiation types in the Somaśambhupaddhati. 

55 The Jayadrathayāmala (1.13.3) appears to want to impose this distinction already on the Samayadīkṣā, which would be unusual, since the Samayadīkṣā by itself typically cannot grant adhikāra. For the Sanskrit text and translation, see note 56. 
 

Jayadrathayāmala teaches the following options:56 (1) the śivadharmadīkṣā, (2) the lokadharmadīkṣā, and (3) the kṣipraghnī, which appears to be a synonym of the sadyonirvāṇadīkṣā (i.e. “the initiation that instantly grants liberation”).

[And], O God dess, [the Śivadharmadīkṣā] has two forms: in Śaiva scriptures the division of initiation 
 

268 mirnig 

Of those, the śivadharmadīkṣā is defined as twofold, namely sabījā (i.e. with the seed of post-initatory practice) and nirbījā (i.e. without the seed of post initatory practice), which amounts to the bifurcation we typically expect of nir vāṇadīkṣā. The śivadharmadīkṣā initiate therefore attains liberation at death, either with the stipulation to perform post-initiatory rites (sabījā) or without this stipulation (nirbījā). The lokadharmadīkṣā variations, on the other hand, lead to liberation only after the initiate has enjoyed the merit earned through his mundane ritual practice. In this category, two versions are taught: first is the lokadharmiṇī kind, which we have already encountered in the Svaccha nda, Mṛgendra and Tantrāloka, namely an initiation involving the elimination of all bad karma, leaving meritorious karma in place to be enjoyed before the eventual attainment of liberation. The second appears to be a version of the lokadharmadīkṣā in which only the impure universe is purified, the idea being that the initiate will go to some segment of the pure universe after death.57 

is called that without the seed (nirbījākhyā) and that with the seed (sabījā). The Ācārya performs the [initiation] which contains the duty to perform post-initiatory rites purified (viśuddhasamayācārā) for children, imbeciles, those whose limbs suffered trauma, deaf people, women, people who are suffering from chronic illness and kings and renouncers (saṃnyāsin) who are extremely devoted [to Śiva]; this [initiation] is the nirbījā. The sabījā is the opposite to this and is performed, O beautiful one, for those who are learned, endure extremes and are able bodied. By those the rituals towards the Guru, the God and the fire have to be performed with extreme devotion, since the desired fruit will not come about for them who don’t do [these rites]. The lokadharmadīkṣā is a Śaiva ritual [and therefore] proceeds contrary to established [practice] (i.e. the brahmanical order), but also conforms to worldly religion. Either [the Ācārya] should purify all [karma] or only not purify the dharma (i.e. the auspicious karma); [then the initiate] is dedicated to [the accumula tion of] dharma through mundane observances (laukikācāradharmasthaḥ), and having enjoyed this [dharma] he proceeds to liberation. Thus, the Ācārya should only purify the bad [karma]. Alternatively, (athavā) [only] the impure path is purified, [so that] no expe rience (bhogaḥ) comes about [in the impure universe]. [In other words] that [experience] does not have to be experienced [anymore in the impure universe] because it has already been experienced [through the process of initiation]. The soul [of the initiate] (ātmā) goes straight to the higher level (i.e. the pure universe). That is known to be the initiation called lokadharma, which leads to liberation. Such [an initiation] (i.e. the śivadharma or lokadharmadīkṣā?) [is performed] when the past action has been destroyed, but the prārabdhakarma [is present], O loved one. But that initiation which [is performed] after [all experiences that] need to be experienced have waned, that is the piṇḍapātikā (i.e. which causes the dropping of the body). [The Ācārya] should take hold [of the soul] through yoga and expel it with the razor and other fierce mantras in order to bring its union [with the deity] through the highest fusion (parayogasamāyoge). For this is the [ini tiation which] bestows liberation immediately (sadyonirvāṇadā).” 

57 For the interpretation of the second kind of lokadharmadīkṣā I am indebted to Alexis Sanderson. 
 

adapting śaiva tantric initiation 269 

While our sources discussed so far did not teach such a variation of the loka dharmiṇī, we did see that the Mṛgendra and Jayaratha conceived of different levels of lokadharmī practice, the latter even adding a level in which the loka dharmī is reborn and then initiated again on another cosmic level.58 The śiva dharmadīkṣā and the lokadharmadīkṣā thus differ broadly from each other in that the former bestows spiritual liberation through the power of Śaiva ritual alone, being opposed to the worldly practice (i.e. mokṣvāptikarī yā tu lokācāra viparyayāt | śivadharmā smṛtā dīkṣā), while in the latter brahmanical ritual acts as the source of the immediate spiritual benefit, even though—as in the ear lier cases—the power of initiation eventually brings about union with a deity on some or another cosmic level. That in the Jayadrathayāmala too this cate gory holds a doctrinally awkward position can perhaps be inferred by the need the redactors felt to stress that the lokadharmadīkṣā is indeed a Śaiva ritual ( Jayadrathayāmala, Ṣaṭka 1, 13.12).59 

In the case of the Bṛhatkālottara, the śivadharmiṇī/lokadharmiṇī terminol ogy makes only a brief appearance. So far I have only been able to locate a single passage featuring this distinction, at the end of the chapter on initia tion.60 Here too these categories are not used in the context of the Sādhaka or bubhukṣu, but feature rather as variations of the nirvāṇadīkṣā.In contrast to the Jayadrathayāmala, the pair is used to describe the nirbījā dīkṣā and sabījā dīkṣā, respectively, and in the case of the lokadharmiṇī, there is no reference to the elimination of bad karma alone. What is curious is that the text, as preserved in the manuscript available to me, equates nirbījā dīkṣā with the śivadharmiṇī and sabījāwith the lokadharmiṇī.61 This seems counterintuitive, since in all the classifications we have seen the sabījā is the initiation after which a candidate is obliged to observe Śaiva post-initiatory rites (samayas) until death, whereas in the nirbījā case, the initiate is free of this obligation and maintains his ritual obligations in accordance with his position in society. It is tempting to conjec ture that the transmission of the text is simply wrong at this point—that we should emend the order so that the nirbījā is equated with lokadharmiṇī and the sabījā with śivadharmiṇī. However, this remains conjectural, and a more thorough study of the initiatory categories will require critically editing at least

this portion of the text. Nevertheless, what we can extract for our discussion is that here the classification is associated neither with the Sādhaka, nor with the “karma logic” of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā found in the Jayadrathayāmala. 

5 Pre-13th Century Saiddhāntika Manuals: Householders versus Ascetics 

Labels for the initiation categories śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī are carried over into the Saiddhāntika manuals, though differently and inconsistently reas signed by various sources, and with weak links to the original Sādhaka context. The following surveys early Saiddhāntika manuals, with particular focus on the earlier sources, but is not exhaustive. Noticeably, the influential Somaśambhu paddhati, also called the Kriyākāṇḍakramāvalī, of Somaśambhu does not teach a mundane form of the sādhakadīkṣā, nor does it include lokadharmiṇī among the mumukṣu options; rather, the text speaks of the Śaiva Sādhaka receiving, as in the sources discussed earlier, a modified form of the nirvāṇadīkṣā right before his consecration to office.62 However, in the description of the sabījā nirvāṇadīkṣā, at the point when karmas are emplaced upon the pāśasūtra— representing all reality levels of the cosmos, which will be burnt and destroyed in the consecrated fire—the Somaśambhupaddhati presents various options for the karma that can be exempted from purification, namely the prārabdha karma, the karma for mantrasiddhi, and the karma that results from meritori ous acts, comparable to those of the lay devotee. While Somaśambhu himself does not explicitly correlate these options to specific initiation types, we may note that the latter two categories of karma, to be exempted for purification in certain circumstances, correspond to the procedures we have seen envisaged for the śivadharmiṇī initiation for the Śaiva Sādhaka, and the lokadharmiṇī initiation, respectively. In fact, in his commentary on this passage, Trilocana explicitely assigns these categories accordingly.63 

62 See, Somaśambhupaddhati Sādhakābhiṣeka 1–2:sādhaskyābhiṣeke tu nivṛtyādikalātrayam | mumukṣor iva saṃśodhya śāntyatītāṃ viśodhayet || tataḥ sadāśivaṃ dhyātvā mūlama ntreṇa pūrṇayā | śāntau saṃyojya kurvīta guṇāpādanam aṣṭadhā. For a tanslation and notes, see Brunner 1977, 500–506.

adapting śaiva tantric initiation 271 

Another manual from this period is the Vimalāvatī of Vimalaśiva, who com posed his work in 1101/2 and lived in Vārāṇasī (Sanderson 2014, 22). Vimalaśiva explicitly uses the categories of śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī; and though he partly draws on the passage from the Mṛgendra examined earlier, he does not assign these to different kinds of Sādhaka, but rather assigns the śiva dharmiṇī initiation to the Putraka and Ācārya—a feature we also see in the Ajitāgama64—and the lokadharmiṇī simply to the Sādhaka devoted to merito rious action.65 However, it appears that in this passage the allocation of initi ation categories has gone awry, such that the Śaiva Sādhaka is missing, unless the reason for this omission is the actual disappearance of the Sādhaka from medieval South-India. 

Jñānaśiva wrote his Jñānaratnāvalī also while residing in Vārāṇasī, probably some decades later.66 In his application of the śivadharmiṇī/lokadharmiṇī ter minology he seems to be the most innovative of Saiddhāntika authors in this period. He also quotes sources for this classification that have yet to be identi fied. Jñānaśiva uses this terminology to denote divisions of the nirvāṇadīkṣā— that is to say, the full regular Śaiva initiation—in essence in order to distinguish, broadly, between initiations performed for the ascetic practitioner, here the śivadharmī, and those for the householder practitioner, here the lokadharmī.67

The actual procedures for the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī initiations are the same, being those for the nirvāṇadīkṣā, with only one difference: for the śivadharmī, the topknot is cut off during the initiation, while for the lokadharmī it is not.68 The topknot is believed to contain the rodhaśakti,69 that is to say the power to delude the soul,70 which is apparently eliminated by cutting the top knot off in the case of the ascetic. This is not done for the lokadharmī, who, after all, is by definition still engaged in worldly activity. In terms of post-initiatory practice prescribed for the lokadharmī initiate, the Jñānaratnāvalī differs from the earlier scriptural sources discussed in the first part of the paper, in which an initiate who received a lokadharmiṇī or lokadharmadīkṣā was only required to continue his ritual obligations of the brahmanical ritual sphere (the loka dharma), without Śaiva-specific additions. In the Jñānaratnāvalī, however, we have seen that the lokadharmiṇī is clearly defined as a form of nirvāṇadīkṣā, which—unless otherwise specified—is of the sabījā kind. Thus, the signifi cance here is that the initiate retains his socio-religious status in mundane society (lokadharma) as a householder and keeps up these practices in addi tion to his Śaiva post-initiatory ritual obligations, a principle that is already expressed in early Śaiva sources.71 There is no mention of the procedure to 

dane is known to be for householders, the śivadharmiṇī for ascetics. In the lokadharmiṇī initiation there is no cutting of the topknot. The initiation in which the topknot is cut off is the śivadharmiṇī.” At the end of this section, all the sāpekṣā types are contrasted with the nirapekṣā; see Jñānaratnāvalī, p. 269:evaṃ sāpekṣā bahudhā jñeyā nirapekṣā ca parā paratvena dvividhā sadyosadyonirvāṇā ceti, “In this manner the sapekṣā type is known to be manifold, and the nirapekṣā type is twofold on account of its higher and a lower forms, [namely] the immediate and the not-immediate types of nirvāṇadīkṣā.” 

68 For the Sanskrit text and translation, see note 67. Note that this is not the case in all manuals; for instance, the Somaśambhupaddhati does not maintain this distinction. See Brunner 1977, 338, note 395. 

69 Also referred to as tirodhānaśakti. 

70 See, e.g., Somaśambhupaddhati, Nirvāṇadīkṣāvidhi, verse 219 (Brunner 1977, 338–339): śikhāmantritakartaryā rodhaśaktisvarūpiṇīm | śikhāṃ chindyāt śivāstreṇa śiṣyasya catu raṅgulām ||, and also Jñānaratnāvalī, p. 344: śikhāñ chidyāt tayā śaktyā rodhaśakti svarūpiṇīm | kāraṇaṃ sarvapāśānāṃ sāvadhe dvādaśāṅgulāt. See also Brunner 1977, xli, and for a discussion of the cutting of the topknot at other moments during initiation in some sources, see Goodall et al. 2015, 282–283. 

71 Sanderson (2009, 302) has demonstrated how Śaiva scriptures and commentaries early on developed clear positions regarding the importance for Śaiva householder initiates of maintaining their brahmanical householder duties, i.e. the lokadharma. This helped ensure that Śaiva initiation remained attractive to the householder mainstream, who, in this way, were not required to completely transform their public lives. However, it is emphasised in these sources that such full Śaiva initiates were asked to maintain brah manical practice merely for the sake of conformity, or in order to avoid transgression, not as a source of spiritual merit. 
 

adapting śaiva tantric initiation 273 

eliminate only the bad karma linked to all reality levels, which we have seen associated with the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā. 

However, while this seems to be the underlying basic division of the nir vāṇadīkṣā in the Jñānaratnāvalī, these distinctions subsequently become entangled with aspects of the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī initiations stem ming from their original Sādhaka context. This happens in the context of cre ating sub-categories for both the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī categories, based on a division between those who desire something (sakāma), i.e. what would otherwise be called the bubhukṣu, and those who do not desire anything except liberation (akāma, niṣkāma), i.e. the mumukṣu. For ascetic practition ers, the śivadharmiṇī is divided into kinds for temporary ascetics (bhautika) and permanent ascetics (naiṣṭḥika),72 and each of these is further divided into the sakāma and niṣkāma type.73 In the case of the naiṣṭhikī sakāmā initia tion, the initiate is promised enjoyments of the pure universe, after which he is to attain liberation.74 The naiṣṭhikī niṣkāmā initiation, on the other hand, bestows liberation immediately. On the division of the bhautikī into sakāmā and niṣkāmā types, Jñānaśiva quotes the first two verses of a passage from the Mṛgendra, which mentions that there are two types of bhautikī dīkṣā, the superior and the inferior, the first being śivadharmiṇī and the second being the lokadharmiṇī type.75 However, since Jñānaśiva uses these as sub-categories 

72 Jñānaratnāvalī, p. 266 (with a conjecture by Goodall recorded from the etext): tatra śivadharmiṇī dvidhā naiṣṭḥikī bhautikī ceti tatra niravadhitapasvino naiṣṭhikāḥ. teṣāṃ yā sā naiṣṭhikī niravadhīty api kathyate dvitīyā *katipayadina(conj.

The [initiation] that is [performed]for them is the naiṣṭḥikī, that is to say the one called the permanent. The second [kind of initiation] (i.e. the bhautikī) restores the state of being a householder immediately after the performance of an observance for a certain number of days.” 

73 Jñānaratnāvalī, p. 266: tatra naiṣṭḥikī sakāmākāmabhedena dvidhā, “In that case, the naiṣṭḥikī initiation is divided into one for those who desire [enjoyments and supernat ural powers] and one for those who don’t.” 

74 Jñānaratnāvalī, pp. 266–267: tatra sakāmasya śuddhādhvabhogan datvā tadanantaraṃ śivapadapradā sakāmā, “In that case, for the one who desires [enjoyments and supernatu ral powers] the sakāmā [initiation] [first] bestows the pleasures of the pure universe and immediately after that the level of the [highest] Śiva.”

of the śivadharmiṇī, this is not the way in which he wants the Mṛgendra to be understood; rather, the prose after the quotation explains that the differ ence lies in the sakāmā entailing purification of the impure universe only up to māyā, thus providing enjoyments within the sphere of the pure universe; the niṣkāmā type, however, entails purification of all levels of the universe, and the initiate thus attains liberation at death.76 If we are to understand these as two sub-categories of the temporary ascetic, the second type makes little sense, a confusion that is probably caused by the terminology bhautikī and naiṣṭḥikī dīkṣā in the Mṛgendra, where the terms are not, in turn, synonyms of the bhau tikavrata and naiṣṭhikavrata,77 as they are understood in the Jñānaratnāvalī.78 

The lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, in turn, is divided into superior (para) and infe rior (apara) forms. Of those, the superior version is what we expect of the nirvāṇadīkṣā, with all karma but the prārabdha destroyed, the candidate thus being united with Śiva at the end of the initiation ritual in anticipation of his ultimate liberation at the time of death.79 The inferior form is assigned to an initiation in which only bad karma is destroyed, thus the version of the loka dharmiṇī dīkṣā seen in the Svacchanda and the Mṛgendra.80 Jñānaśiva even 

sakāmasya māyāntādhvaviśodhanam | niṣkāmasya samastādhvaviśodhanañ ca yogaḥ | punaś śuddhādhvani bhogayogas sakāmasya niṣkāmasya śivayogaś ca […],“Next, the bhau tikī [dīkṣā]is twofold, and it is said [in the scriptures]: ‘In the same way the bhautikī [dīkṣā is achieved] through ritual and union [and] is also of a superior and inferior kind. Rather, for the [still] deluded [souls] he should preserve the prārabdha karma, which has the pur pose of keeping [the initiate] with his [current] body, after joining it with [the karma] to be cultivated for the practice of propitiating Śaiva mantras for supernatural powers (i.e. śaivasādhana). The other [karmas] together with their consequences he should burn in the blazing initiation fire.’ This is the meaning: ‘in the same way’ means through kriyāyoga, that it to say the rituals and union [with the respective deity] for the sakāma and akāma bhautikī are just like those for the sakāma and akāma naiṣṭhikī. Therefore the ritual for the sakāma kind is the purification of the universe up to māyā. For the niṣkāma it is the purification of the entire cosmic path and then union. Or rather, for the sakāma there is union with enjoyments in the pure universe, and for the niṣkāma there is union with Śiva. […]”

quotes a verse which is shared with or probably original to the Mṛgendra, though embedded in a quotation from a different, unidentified text, which reit erates that the initiate can be united with the deity of his choice at the end of the initiation ritual.81 However, what is not made explicit in any of these pas sages is what the practice after initiation consists of; since both of them are sabījadīkṣās, we expect some form of post-initiatory practice to be applicable, which is fitting for the superior kind, but not for the inferior kind, as we have seen it so far. But given the context, we can probably assume that the inten tion is the same as it was in the original context, namely that the initiate of the lower (apara) form simply follows his lokadharma after initiation. However, it is difficult to know whether this reflects actual practice—that is, whether this categorization intimates the convention of giving initiation even to lay worshippers of non-Śaiva deities—or whether this is an artificial distinction created in the process of accounting for the Mṛgendra’s shared terminology. Another place where Jñānaśiva invokes the śivadharmiṇī/lokadharmiṇī dis tinction is regarding the post-funerary śrāddha rituals, which vary according to initiatory types. Here, the mode of śrāddha for the śivadharmī appears to

But the inferior [lokadharmiṇī initiation] bestows supernatural powers, starting with the power to become as small as one wishes, and the qualities of the deity presid ing over the [respective cosmic level], after the purification of the cosmic path up to the level of the universe [the candidate] desires. And even on this desired cosmic level, the cessation of karma is [only] of the unmeritorious part. And it is said: ‘The remain ing [initiation], known as the lokadharmiṇī, [is performed] for the purpose of [obtaining supernatural powers], such as the power to become as small as one wishes, in a subse quent body, after the bad portion of [karma] is destroyed on all reality levels [through initiation]’.” Note that the appropriation of the Mṛgendra verse here to denote the inferior level of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā is not the original intention. Rather, the phrase śiṣṭeṣṭā lokadharmiṇī denotes the second kind of bhautikī dīkṣā, namely the lokadharmiṇī itself, in contrast to the śivadharmiṇī.

be that which is intended for ascetic initiates, while that for the lokadharmī is for householder initiates, thus being consistent with the basic distinction Jñānaśiva sets up in the beginning of the initiation section (Mirnig 2013, 292– 295). 

The Jñānaratnāvalī’s innovative application of the śivadharmiṇī/loka dharmiṇī terminology led to some interpretative confusion and inconsisten cies in subsequent classifications,82 perhaps especially since the influential Somaśambhupaddhati does not mention this division of initiatory categories.83 Thus Trilocana, for instance, who is a student of Jñānaśiva and wrote a com mentary on the Kriyākāṇḍakramāvalī, when commenting on the initiation cat egories taught there, fits the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī initiations into Somaśambhu’s system under the category of sāpekṣā initiation, even incorpo rating such details as the difference in cutting or not cutting off the topknot.84 However, he runs into difficulties when mapping the initiatory categories onto the various forms of śrāddha, which differ according to the initiate’s spiritual status during his lifetime (Mirnig 2013, 296). 

This distinctive idea that the topknot is be to cut off in the case of the śiva dharmiṇī initiation, but not in the lokadharmiṇī, is carried over into subse quent sources that include these categories in their initiatory classifications. 

82 See, for instance, Brunner 1977, 194, note 71. 

83 Somaśambhupaddhati, Samayadīkṣāvidhi 5–13: nirādhārā ca sādhārā dīkṣā tu dvividhā matā | nirādhārā dvayos teṣāṃ sādhārā sakalasya tu || ācāryanirapekṣeṇa kriyate śambhu naiva yā | tīvraśaktinipātena nirādhāreti sā smṛtā || ācāryamūrtim āsthāya mandatīvrādi bhedayā | śaktyā yāṃ kurute śambhuḥ sā sādhikaraṇocyate || iyaṃ caturvidhā proktā sabījā bījavarjitā | sādhikārā niradhikārā yathāvad abhidhīyate || samayācārasaṃyuktā sabījā jāyate nṛṇām | nirbījā tv asamarthānāṃ samayācāravarjitā || nitye naimittike kāmye yasya syād adhikāritā | sādhikārā bhaved dīkṣā sādhakācāryayor ataḥ || nirbījādīkṣitānāṃ tu tathā samayiputrayoḥ | nityamātrādhikāritvād dīkṣā niradhikārikā || dvividheyaṃ dvirū pāpi pratyekam upajāyate | ekā kriyāvatī tatra kuṇḍamaṇḍalapūrvikā || manovyāpāramā treṇa yā sā jñānavatī matā | itthaṃ labdhādhikāreṇa dīkṣācāryeṇa sādhyate ||. For a trans lation and notes, see Brunner 1977, 4–13. 

84 Thus, Trilocana’s Somaśambhupaddhativyākhyā, p. 184, is somewhat similar to Jñānaśiva’s text (see note 67): … yā dīkṣaiva sabījā, nirbījā, sādhikārā, niradhikāra ceti caturvidhā proktā. tatra tāvat samayācārasaṃyuktā yā sā sabījā. sā ca dvividhā śivadharmiṇī loka dharmiṇī ca.tatratāvac chivadharmiṇī śikhāyāś chedasahitā. sā ca dvividhā naiṣṭḥikī bhau tikī ceti. tāvan naiṣṭhikī niravadhiḥ. dvitīyā katipayadinavrataparipālanānantaraṃ gṛha padadāyinī. And Trilocanaśiva ad Somaśambhupaddhati, Nirvāṇadīkṣāvidhi 31, as quoted by Brunner 1977, 191, [32a]: atraivāvasare tāvan nirbījināṃ dehārambhakarmaṇaḥ | sabī jāyāṃ tu dīkāyāṃ śivadharmiṇyāṃ samayācāradehārambhakakarmadvayāt | atha sādha kadīkṣāyāṃ mantrasiddhiphalād api | lokadharmiṇyām iṣṭāpūrtādidharmāc ca vyatiri ktaṃ prabandhakaṃ kalānām antare smaret. For notes and a translation, see Brunner1977, 190, note 66. 
 

Thus, the Siddhāntaśekhara (18–22b)85 of Viśvanātha, who wrote in Vārāṇasī in the first half of the thirteenth century (Sanderson 2014, 23), in essence teaches a structure similar to the Jñānaratnāvalī, with the śivadharmiṇī and lokad harmiṇī being the broad divisions of sabījā initiation, except that the lokad harmiṇī is not further divided; the śivadharmiṇī, in contrast, is divided into naiṣṭhikī and bhautikī varieties, but there is no further division into sakāma and niṣkāma kinds.86 

Even this brief survey of some early-medieval South-Indian sources, writ ten some centuries after the sriptural material discussed in the first part of the paper, shows that there was no fixed consensus on what the different initia tory categories covered exactly; the same elements appear in various places, assembled together differently.87What the sources share, however, is that these categories are no longer in any case associated with the bubhukṣu category. 

6 Conclusion 

The material reviewed above allows us to trace how the emergence and devel opment of the lokadharmiṇī initiation are linked to larger developments in tantric Śaiva history. To sum up: the initial stage appears to reflect an early phase of tantric Śaivism, when the power- and enjoyment-seeking aspects of 

85 Siddhāntaśekhara p. 145, Naimittikakāṇḍa, chapter 2.18–22b: sabījā dvividhā proktā pra thamā śivadharmiṇī | dharmādharmātmakaṃ karma sañcitāgāmicitrakam ||18|| saṃ mṛdya sādhyate yasmāt sā dīkṣā śivadharmiṇī | adharmasañcitaṃ sarvaṃ karmāṅgam iva śodhyate ||19|| dharmāvaśeṣito yatra sā dīkṣā lokadharmiṇī | tatrādyā saśikhācchedā na śikhācchedanādarā ||20|| bhautikī naiṣṭikī ceti dvidhā sā śivadharmiṇī | vratamokṣasamā yuktā bhautikīti nigadyate||21|| śarīrapātaparyantā yathā sā naiṣṭhikī matā |. 

86 See, for instance, Nigamajñāna II’s Dīkṣādarśa, for which see Ganesh 2009, 196; see also further mention of these categories on pp. 137, 164–165, 196, and 240. 

87 For instance, in the16th century Śaivaparibhāṣā (for the date of which see Sanderson 2014, 86) of Śivāgrayogin, the śivadharmiṇī and lokadharmiṇī are differentiated according to an original feature: that for the former all karmas are destroyed, and for the latter only the bad ones. The feature of cutting off the topknot, on the other hand, is connected with the nirvāṇadīkṣā as opposed to the samayadīkṣā and viśeṣadīkṣā; however, the text does link the cutting of the top-knot to the ascetic, saying that it should take place after his nirvāṇadīkṣā; see Śaivaparibhāṣā, chapter 5, p. 5: iyam api śivadharmiṇī lokadharmiṇī ceti dvividhā. dharmādharmayor ubhayor api yatra saṃśodhanaṃ sā śivadharmiṇī. adharma mātrasya yatra saṃśodhanaṃ sā lokadharmiṇī. kriyāvatī prakārāntareṇa trividhā. sama yadīkṣā viśeṣadīkṣā nirvāṇadīkṣā ceti. yatra rudrapade yojanaṃ kriyate sā samayadīkṣā. yatreśvarapade yojanaṃ sā viśeṣadīkṣā. anayor ubhayor api nāsti śikhācchedaḥ. yatra śiva pade yojanaṃ sā nirvāṇadīkṣā. yatra nirvāṇadīkṣapūrvakaṃ sannyāsaḥ tatra tv asti śikhā cchedaḥ.

tantric practice held a comparatively prominent role. It seems that the loka dharmiṇī dīkṣā was created in this milieu in order to extend the benefits and services of the tantric repertoire to various groups within the brahmanical mainstream, in this way appealing to the ordinary lay worshipper, who was perhaps attracted by the magical and merit-enhancing aspects of the religion but did not want to commit to the ritual life of a tantric practitioner. This ini tial function aligns with a gradual process of professionalization within tantric Śaiva communities, bridging the gap between esoteric practitioners and the laity. In this matter they followed in the footsteps of the Atimārga, for epi graphical evidence attests to members of these Śaiva ascetic initiatory cir cles serving as religious officiants for lay practitioners from as early as the fourth century (Sanderson 2013).88 However, at the same time, the Sādhaka form of lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā is found only in the Svacchanda, Mṛgendra, and the Tantrasadbhāva, suggesting that in the broader Śaiva tantric world—apart from Kashmir—its function was of marginal or no importance, a circumstance likely contributing to its disappearance from subsequent sources. 

We have seen that in other sources using the lokadharmiṇī category, this was reassigned to the sphere of the liberation-seeker. This allocation, in turn, may be correlated with two further developments. Firstly, increasing emphasis was given to the liberation-seeking aspect of the religion, a development that in the South culminates in the disappearance of the figure of the Śaiva Sādhaka, as Brunner (1974, 440) observes. Consequently, retention of an exoteric form of the enjoyment-seeker category may have gradually become obsolete. Sec ondly, we know that tantric Śaivism was successful in gradually adapting to the ritual needs of the brahmanical mainstream, even to the point of incor porating its practices within the tantric ritual repertoire, so that full initiation also became available to brahmanical householders, giving them unrestricted access to the religion.89 This development is reflected in the use of the cate gory lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā in the 12th-century Jñānaratnāvalī, where it is pre scribed for precisely those householder initiates who had full access to the tantric repertoire but maintained their position and brahmanical ritual obli gations in society (the lokadharma). Again, the need for a lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, which made the bubhukṣu aspect of the religion more accessible and may originally have been a catalyst for outreach, may thereby have become less meaningful. The increasingly large-scale inclusion of the brahmanical main

stream from this time onwards is also visible in other areas of ritual, especially in South-Indian sources. Thus, for instance, we find the emergence of literature on penance rites regulating social interactions, such as the two works known as Prāyaścittasamuccaya by Hṛdayaśiva and Trilocana, respectively, the latter having been edited and translated by Sathyanarayanan (2015). In his intro duction to this volume, Dominic Goodall draws attention to the socially all encompassing nature of the work, showing how its prescriptions include even women as part of the community, and how the focus shifts to public temple rit ual.90 Goodall also points out another change within these tantric traditions, which we may find reflected in the history of the lokadharmiṇī dīkṣā, namely that along with these developments the goal of individual liberation gradu ally waned in importance. He observes also that the “colonization by the Śaiva Siddhānta of many large South Indian temples, and the dominance of Vedān tic non-dualism appear to have diminished the significance of ritual salvific dīkṣā.”91 As the tradition’s focus shifted from individual to public ritual life, it may be this waning importance of dīkṣā’s salvific function that has contributed to the confusion evident in Saiddhāntika manuals concerning how to cate gorize the lokadharmiṇī and śivadharmiṇī dīkṣās. The dominant concern in allocating these initation types eventually became simply to differentiate the householder initiate from the ascetic, rather than to distinguish the spiritual goals attained through various initiations. This usage of the terminology is far removed from its original purpose: designating special types of tantric intia tion for those seeking powers, access to higher cosmic realms, and, ultimately, liberation.

Thus I have set forth this new (nava), easy path as it was explained by my distinguished teacher [Somānanda] in the śāstra, [entitled] the Śivadṛṣṭi. Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikās of Utpaladeva at 4.16ab

1 Introduction 

It is well known that religious agents in premodern South Asia appealed to the purported timelessness and transcendence of their scriptural sources to secure not only their legitimacy but also that of the ideas found in them. Equally well known—in no small part due to the work of Alexis Sanderson on the social history of Śaiva and other religious traditions in early-medieval Kashmir and elsewhere—is the fact that premodern South Asian religions do not appear as unchanging and immobile traditions in social stasis. Quite the opposite: the various religious traditions of medieval South Asia were nothing if not inno vative in idea and practice, most notably in their literary productions. These myriad religious traditions, moreover, had a measurable and not insignificant influence on contemporaneous social life. 

In beginning to address the question of religious change in premodern South Asia I would like not merely to point out that the religious practitioners of the day were surely able to distinguish new religious, and other, ideas and prac tices from received tradition—just as we are today—a fact that itself calls into question the reification of the sort of social stasis and lack of historical awareness posited in previous Indological scholarship.1 I also will argue that

a self-conscious, emic theory or explanation of scriptural authority and social change may be found in the history of religions in premodern Kashmir. I wish to examine the significance of novelty, of innovation, as it was conceived by the authors I propose to place under study, and to identify its role in establish ing, or challenging, religious authority in the period in question, all of which I will do by exploring an exemplar that illustrates what I suggest should be taken as a maxim in the study of South Asian religions (and religion more generally), namely, thatchange is not inimical to religion, even if particular religious agents are not infrequently inimical to change.2 

In particular, I propose to examine selected writings of some among the most prominent of the Śaiva tantric “post-scriptural” authors of the Kashmir Valley, who thrived there in the period reserved by the title of the present essay. They include Somānanda (circa 900–950), Utpaladeva (circa 925–975), and Abhinavagupta (circa 975–1025), as well as Jayaratha (early 13th C.E.), the author of the Tantrālokaviveka commentary on the Tantrāloka (hereafter TĀV and TĀ, respectively). Their textual contributions are properly associated with what continues, sometimes, to be labeled “Kashmiri Shaivism,”3 and they offer an important opportunity to reevaluate the nature of various sources of reli 

any proper appreciation of history. MacDonell, in turn, both reiterates this position and adds to it a second claim regarding what he calls the “total lack of the historical sense” in premod ern Indian literature: he claims that historical events in premodern South Asia were insuffi cient to trigger the cultivation of a properly historical consciousness. See MacDonell [1900] 1962, 8–9. This pair of views exemplifies the two types of arguments that earlier Indologists have made regarding the supposed ahistoricality of premodern South Asian works: Schol ars often suggested either that the authors of premodern Sanskrit works held theoretical— mainly religious—views that precluded them from taking interest in historical concerns; or, they argued that historical events in premodern South Asia transpired inways that preempted the possibility of a properly historical response to them. 

2 Scholars in the academy have given new attention to the question of the place of change in religion in recent years.Jonathan Edelmann, formerly of Mississippi State University and now at the University of Florida, has suggested, in an unpublished précis of concerns addressed by four panelists of a session of the 2011 American Academy of Religion National Meeting enti tled “Authorizing Theologies,” that the question to hand was a matter of “newness,” of novelty, and of “authorizing” such novelty in the language of “theology,” with the shared hypothesis of all the panelists being that the various theological formulations they placed under exami nation each sought to “recast and re-contextualize influential concepts and arguments from earlier traditions” (to quote from the panelists’ description of the session). Some of the prod ucts of this panel may be found in a special issue of the International Journal of Hindu Studies, for which see Edelmann 2014. The present essay constitutes a response to and an engagement with the broader theme first engaged by these scholars at the AAR Annual Meeting in ques tion.

gious authority in premodern South Asia, as well as the manner of establishing and deploying such authority in practice in India’s premodernity. This is so, firstly and primarily, because the authors in question explicitly wedded themselves to the notion that novelty, the production of something new, was not only acceptable, but was an asset to their religion. This they maintained over and against the ethos of Vedic religious authority, which was defined by its claim to offer a kind of knowledge that was beyond question, its infallibility guaranteed by the purported timelessness and authorlessness of the Vedic scriptures themselves. Secondly, and related to this, they lived and wrote in the Valley at a time when Kashmir was economically dynamic and culturally and religiously pluralistic, and was perhaps the most active cen ter of Sanskrit literary production in the Indian sub-continent not only in its day, but in Indian history (after the time of the Guptas).4 Indeed, the bibli 

4 Royal patronage certainly did much to cultivate this cultural richness, as the many Kashmiri contributions in poetry and aesthetic theory illustrate, these of course being important con cerns of the premodern South Asian court; but this was not the only catalyst. Five additional elements served to make such cultural production possible. These include: 

(1) The relative security of Kashmir. Closing the famed “gates” to the Valley—the moun tain passes or dvāras—offered reliable protection from outside military interference, though this did not help quell internal military threats, as the Rājataraṅgiṇī makes abundantly clear. 

(2) This does not mean, however, that Kashmiris were unaware of outside military and other influences. One anecdote illustrates as much: to my knowledge the earliest use in San skrit of the term turuṣka appears in a Kashmiri work, the famed Kuṭṭanīmata of Dāmodara gupta; and the term frequently appears in later Kashmiri works such as the Rājataraṅgiṇī and the Kathāsaritsāgara. So much signals the second catalyst: cosmopolitanism, or a cognizance of the wider world and significant contact with it. Foreign invaders were long kept at bay, to be sure; but, simultaneously, scholars and merchants regularly were given leave to visit the Valley from the plains of India and from as far afield as Central Asia and China, and possi bly beyond. Perhaps most notably, Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims frequented Kashmir in order to study in the Valley’s thriving monasteries, which were influential in the period in question even if relatively few archaeological traces of them have survived to the present day. 

(3) Next, the extensive and longstanding cross-pollination of Hindu and Buddhist thought did much to enrich humanistic thinking in the Valley in the period under study; it helped that, with relatively few exceptions, the kings of Kashmir supported a healthy religious diversity in the Valley. (Harṣa of course is one exception to the general rule that Kashmiri kings, and members of the court, patronized various traditions simultaneously, and certainly lived up to the Dharmaśāstric norm of leaving religion alone short of the emergence of egregious con cerns therewith.) I would count this intellectual and religious pluralism the third productive factor in Kashmiri intellectual and cultural history. 

(4) A fourth influence was economic: global trade along the nearby Silk Road is likely to have contributed to the Valley’s material prosperity, which would have facilitated the culti vation of Kashmir’s cultural wealth (though more work is needed better to understand this dimension of Kashmiri social life); and the Valley itself, with its large tracts of arable land, was agriculturally largely self-sufficient.

ography of Kashmiri contributions, one feels, is practically asymptotic to that of premodern Sanskrit learning tout court.5 Quite a number of innovative lit erary works were produced there in this period, moreover; and some among the Śaiva authors in question actively participated in this cultural and liter ary tradition by composing texts that contributed to selected non-tantric lit erary genres. A study of these authors thus opens a window into the ways in which religion functioned in larger intellectual and public spheres in a period of tremendous intellectual and cultural flourishing, even if the present essay will examine the internal logic of the selected tradition’s philosophical and 

(5) Finally, one cannot discount the significance of the location itself: Kashmir was—and is—considered to be one of the most beautiful places of the entire sub-continent, and people simply wanted to live there. This in part explains the long history of Brahminical migration (at the king’s invitation) to the Valley from across the sub-continent. 

5 The Kashmiri contributions are of course numerous and cover the gamut of fields of San skritic learning, from Dharmaśāstra to philosophical writings to vyākaraṇa and other tech nical literatures, to works of belles lettres in a range of genres, and, of particular note, to the alaṃkāraśāstra. Consider the following. Two of the five works that are demonstrably based on Guṇādhya’s Bṛhatkathā were composed in Kashmir (these are the Bṛhatkathāmañjarī of Kṣemendra and Somadeva’s famed Kathāsaritsāgara). Virtually all the ālaṃkārikas of the mature phase of the study of aesthetics were Kashmiri—including Vāmana, Bhaṭṭa Udbhaṭa, Rudraṭa, Ānandavardhana, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka, Kuntaka, Mukulabhaṭṭa, Mammaṭa, Ruyyaka, and Pratīhārendurāja. In the various areas of Śāstric learning, the famed Naiyāyika Bhaṭṭa Jayanta was Kashmiri, as were Varadarāja and possibly Vyomaśiva. Among the Buddhists, Arcaṭa, Dharmottara, Śaṅkaranandana, and Jñānaśrīmitra hailed from the Valley, and Vinītadeva (among many others) spent time there. The grammarians Jayāditya and Vāmana, authors of the Kāśikāvṛtti, are thought by some to have been Kashmiris, and Kaiyaṭa certainly was (and is said to have been the son of Mammaṭa). So, too, was Helārāja a Kashmiri (of course he is the author of the Prakīrṇaprakāśa commentary on the Vākyapadīya). Medhātithi, the famed early commentator on the Mānavadharmaśāstra, also hailed from the Valley, as, of course, did Kalhaṇa, the author of the Rājataraṅgiṇī. 

Additionally, a number of key works of unnamed authorship can be shown to have Kash miri origins, including the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, the Haracaritacintāmaṇi, and the Mok ṣopāya, which, as by now is well known, is the early recension of the Yogavāsiṣṭha. Among Śaiva scriptural works, we can say with some confidence that the Bṛhatkālottara, the sec ond, third, and fourth ṣatkas of the Jayadrathayāmalatantra, the Svacchandatantra, the Netratantra, and, in all probability, the Tridaśaḍāmaratantra (about which I wrote my M.Phil. thesis at Oxford under the direction of Alexis Sanderson, the product of which may be found in evidence in Nemec 2013) are Kashmiri productions. Among Pāñcarātrika scriptures (this according to Alexis Sanderson), the Jayākhya-, Jayottara-, and Sāsvata-saṃhitās are of a Kashmiri provenance. Finally, I note that many other works were also influential in the Valley, and were heavily studied there, even if they cannot be proven to have a Kashmiri provenance. For a survey of Kashmiri authors and the scholarship that treats them, see Nemec 2015. (I thank Harunaga Isaacson for his contribution to my understanding of the provenance of these anonymous tantric works, which came in the form of personal correspondence, via email, in December of 2013.) 
 

religious writings rather than explain the relationship between such writings and those of other, more “secular” genres. 

The wider cultural context of the Kashmir Valley is of note, because schol ars have sometimes linked the purportedly transcendent nature of religious authority—and of textual production more generally—to a concomitant, forced stasis in the social order. Rigid and purportedly timeless ideas about the nature of reality and the place of various peoples situated in it, the think ing goes, produced and supported rigid rules concerning the innate rights and capacities of particular individuals and groups, with such rights and capacities inevitably being hierarchically and inequitably defined, all in a manner as resis tant to change as the transcendent sources of religiously sanctioned authority were held to be. The precise social implications of a religious worldview that welcomes innovation, in a context in which innovation in literary production was not uncommon, is therefore of primary concern in defining the role of reli gion in public life in premodern South Asia.6 

In what follows I will proceed in three stages. First, I will offer a précis of the problematic associated with the issues to hand, this by examining Pollock’s theorization of the relationship of theory (śāstra) to practice (or prayoga) in premodern South Asia. Pollock is selected for further examination because his writings on premodern South Asian cultural change are, in my view, the most sophisticated and engaging of any scholarly treatment of the subject to date, even if I will ultimately adopt his view only in part, challenging it in part as well. 

Following this, I will examine key textual passages from the writings of the tradition here placed under study, this to illustrate the ways in which tran scendentally authorized religious ideas can be conceived simultaneously to be historically situated and, indeed, new—and therefore demanding of a new social consciousness. Here I wish to support the claim thatsocial change in pre modern South Asia tends almost invariably to be incremental, not revolutionary, in nature. It regularly—not to say exclusively—involves modifications of social norms and strictures, not wholesale changes thereof. The relevant textual pas sages will be examined in two sections, the first dealing with the tradition’s emic theory of textual authority, the second with its religious practices. 

6 The idea, then, is to begin, at least, to consider the tantric Śaivas’ religion in light of the exis tence of their non-tantric lives (if not explicitly their non-tantric textual contributions), as well to measure their religious writings with the wider social, cultural, and intellectual con texts in which they thrived in mind.I intend, anyhow, to make a start at this here by examining the role of innovation, of change, in religion, even if any exploration of these themes more broadly will have to wait for a subsequent study.

Finally, I will conclude by charting the implications of this exemplar in a concentric series of contexts, culminating with the study of religion, broadly conceived. If I might be allowed to argue by way of example—ab uno disce omnes—I will suggest in conclusion that the present illustration offers insight into the nature and functioning not only of religion in premodern India, but also of religion tout court. 

2 Theory and Practice: Sheldon Pollock on śāstra and prayoga 

The issues associated with endeavors to negotiate cultural and social change may be set in the brightest relief if we read them in light of what is in my view the most sophisticated treatment to date of the relation of śāstra—i.e., (textual) theory—on the one hand, and cultural and intellectual practice or prayoga, on the other, that of Sheldon Pollock (as articulated in a pair of arti cles: “Mīmāṃsā and the Problem of History in Traditional India” [1989] and, perhaps more importantly, “The Theory of Practice and the Practice of Theory in Indian Intellectual History” [1985]). Pollock has argued, in what is the most significant theoretical contribution of this pair of articles, that classical San skrit theoretical works in premodern South Asia articulated an epistemological formulation according to which there was no dialectical relationship between theory (śāstra) and practice (prayoga). New practices were not seen as able to challenge or shape theoretical models, Pollock has argued, due to the claimed a prioristatus of the theoretical works themselves, which came to be understood to represent (in, he suggests, the language of Ryle) a form of “knowing that” a given social or cultural form was in its very nature just as it appeared in prac tice, as opposed merely to offering a “knowing how” the social or cultural form in question functioned or could function (based on empirical observation).7 

This is to say that the purportedly timeless and authorless works defined the world in terms of what it is and should—and must—be, rather than artic ulating a contingent theory, one subject to revision on the basis of on-the ground practices, or in other words in a dialectical relationship with events. “For here,” Pollock argues, “on a scale probably unparalleled in the pre-modern world, we find a thorough transformation—adopting now Geertz’s well-known dichotomy—of ‘models of’ human activity into ‘models for,’ whereby texts that initially had shaped themselves to reality so as to make it ‘graspable,’ end by

innovation and social change in the vale of kashmir 289 

asserting the authority to shape reality to themselves.”8 Pollock ultimately iden tifies three consequences to this theory of theory and its practical application: (1) the“ ‘creation’ of knowledge” was understood to be exclusively a divine activ ity; (2) knowledge was “by and large viewed as permanently fixed in its dimen sions”; and (3) third and finally, there could be “no conception of progress, of the forward ‘movement from worse to better,’ on the basis of innovations in practice.”9 

One product of such “ahistoricality”10 was an apparent stasis in Brahminical views of the normative social order, at least as such views were codified in the classical Sanskrit śāstras par excellence—the Vedas, which, to reiterate, were reified as authorless and timeless works and said therefore to convey transcen dent and unchanging truths.11 The śāstras were self-consciously understood to 

8 ibid. 

9 See Pollock 1985, 515. 

10 This is the term so often used to describe Indian attitudes toward history—and change. Pollock is not alone in using it (though one should be careful to note that he deploys it differently, and in a markedly more self-conscious and sensitive manner, than his prede cessors). So much was it perceived to be the case that India knew nothing of history, that some Western Indologists around the turn of the last century went so far as to suggest, per A.A. MacDonell, for example, that “early India wrote no history because it never made any.” See MacDonell [1900] 1962, 8–9; cf. footnote 1, above; finally, see footnotes 11 and 27, below, for Pollock’s use of the term in question. 

11 As Pollock (1989, 606) understands it, the practice of producing “a content invariably marked by ahistoricality” has its root in the early history of Vedic exegesis, which sought to establish the authority of the Vedas by claiming them to be timeless and authorless productions—ahistorical productions—in which any apparent references to contempo raneous events or persons were said to be explicable by a variety of analyses that served to vitiate any reference to historical realities. See Pollock 1989, 608: 

Mīmāṃsā holds on empirical grounds that the tradition of the recitation of the Vedas must be beginningless (uktaṃ tu śabdapūrvatvam, PMS 1.1.29; cf. Ślokavārttika, Vākyā dhikaraṇa, vs. 366). But that is not sufficient to prove its transcendence and thus infal libility (something false can be beginningless, the jātyandhaparaṃparānyāya). It is therefore argued that the Vedas are transcendent by reason of their anonymity. Had they been composed by men, albeit long ago, there is no reason why the memory of these composers should not have been preserved to us. Those men who are named in association with particular recensions, books, hymns of the Vedas—Kaṭhaka, for example, or Paippalādaka—are not to be regarded as the authors but simply as schol ars specializing in the transmission or exposition of the texts in question (ākhyā prava canāt, 1.1.30; pūrvapakṣa ad 1.1.27). Texts for which no authors can be identified have no authors, and this applies to the Vedas and to the Vedas alone (which are thus pre sumably the only authentically anonymous texts in Indian cultural history). 

See also ibid.: 

The transcendent character of the Vedas, which is proved by the fact of their having no beginning in time and no author, is confirmed by their contents: the Vedas show 
 

290 nemec 

articulate a range of social and other normative views that were consciously held to be unassailable, because the works in which they were recorded were said to stand entirely outside the realm of mundane and contingent existence: 

History, one might thus conclude, is not simply absent from or unknown to Sanskritic India; rather it is denied in favor of a model of ‘truth’ that accorded history no epistemological value or social significance. The denial of history, for its part, raises an entirely new set of questions. To answer these we would want to explore the complex ideological forma tion of traditionalIndian society that privileges system over process—the structure of the social order over the creative role of man in history—and that, by denying the historical transformations of the past, deny them for the future and thus serve to naturalize the present and its asymmetrical relations of power.12 

no dimension whatever of historical referentiality. Allusions to historical persons or to historical sequentiality are only apparently so. For instance, the Vedic sentence ‘Babara Prāvāhaṇi [son of Pravāha] once desired …’ [TS 7.1.5.4]—which might establish a ter minus post quem for the composition of the text (i.e., after Pravāha begot Babara)— contains merely phonemic resemblances to the names of historical persons (paraṃ tu śrutisāmānyamātram 1.1.31; pūrvapakṣa ad 1.1.28). ‘Etymological’ analysis shows that the references are in fact to eternally existing entities (in the case in question, to the ‘howling wind’). 

Note that Pollock thus challenges the notion, maintained by earlier Indologists such as MacDonell, that such ahistoricality reflects any lack or deficiency in Indian intellectual historical awareness, and he clearly would disagree, asI emphatically do, with those earlier Indologists who denigratedIndian thinkers for failing to develop a“proper” (Western-like) historical consciousness. See, e.g., Pollock 1989, 604: “I believe the received view about Indian historical consciousness is constructed out of a set of ideas whose truth can no longer be taken for granted: ideas about history and narrativity as such, about ancient historiography in general and Indian intellectual history in particular. Moreover, even if we grant that there are idiosyncratic features about the traditional Indian response to historical experience, the characteristics of this idiosyncrasy have never been adequately described or convincingly explained.” (See also, ibid.: “On the face of it the reduction of historical consciousness to a ‘zero-category’ for traditional India is improbable; from the viewpoint of phenomenology, which offers us the most sustained analysis of such con sciousness, it is impossible.”) Rather, Pollock argues, any “ahistoricality” is intentionally constructed, in his view to perpetuate the social control of those (Brahmins) who con structed it. See below.

innovation and social change in the vale of kashmir 291 3 The Kashmiri Śaiva Example in Its Theoretical Form 

If I question Pollock’s model in part, it is not because it is nowhere operative in premodern South Asia or, mutatis mutandis, in contemporary Indian religions. For, decidedly it was, and sometimes is; and Pollock’s theory adroitly explains a strategy for dealing with cultural and social change that in its primary fea tures is also operative in other religious traditions of other times and places. Indeed, it signals what is a fundamental concern for religion and does much to theorize and explain what is a common response to it.13 Where I differ with Pollock is with his understanding of this model as monolithic, as functioning equally across the gamut of premodern śāstric modes of discourse and across textual genres and religious traditions.14 For the facts as we can discern them “on the ground” in the period in question challenge the universal applicability of his model, and the construction and use of religious authority in premodern South Asia was regularly if not uniformly more complex than Pollock’s model allows. 

Two dimensions of textual production in premodern South Asia compli cate his view of the śāstras—the normative, technical, and for our purposes religious writings—of classical India. These are, firstly, (1) the fact that the canon—or, more precisely, canons—of Hindu scripture remained (and in cer tain instances continue to remain) open, allowing for a proliferation of scrip tural sources regularly to emerge “on the ground”; and, secondly, (2) the fact that “ahistoricality”—the very basis of the authorless and timeless transcen dence that, Pollock has shown, furnished (religious) authority—was conceived in multiple ways, including, in the tradition placed under consideration in this essay, in a manner that allowed purportedly divine and timeless teachings simultaneously to be associated with the particular biographies of historically located religious figures (“perfected ones” or Siddhas, in the present example). 

13 The concern may be summed up in plain terms, namely, that while the world changes, the religious ideas, ideals, practices, and principles that are meant to shape and guide human activity are established before such changes can be known or fully anticipated. More than this, religious authority not infrequently is derived from its very antiquity, from the fact that it is born from what is said to be a transcendent source or sources, which can speak “truths” neither produced by, nor subject to the revisions of, the fallible and fickle. There is a need, then, to prove the prescience of the religiously authoritative sources, either through exegesis or eisegesis: one may do so either by finding events as they eventually transpired to have been anticipated in the scriptures or by reading events as they tran spire into the scriptures themselves. 

14 On the ubiquity of this strategy, in Pollock’s view, see footnote 27, where he refers to the use of the strategy in “whatever sort of [Sanskrit] text it might be” that one has to hand. 
 

292 nemec 

This pair of dimensions of scriptural production allowed for the recognition of and advocacy for change in Hinduism in ways that have heretofore passed without mention: religious authority could be conceived of as simultaneously new and timeless; and in a context in which religions could readily proliferate textual sources of a staggering variety, religious authority was complex, both because it was layered and because it could and did change over time. It is precisely for these reasons that the example offered by the Śaiva tantrics of Kashmir both challenges and confirms elements of Pollock’s theory. 

I begin the case-study with the examination of a theoretical work, a śāstra, one inspired by Śaiva tantric scriptures and views, but one voided of explicit ref erences to such texts: Utpaladeva’s Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikās (hereafter ĪPK), the preeminent expression of Pratyabhijñā philosophy, for which the author wrote both a short and a long autocommentary, respectively the Īśvarapratya bhijñākārikāvṛtti (ĪPKVṛ) and the Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā-vivṛti or -ṭīkā (the latter of which is lost excepting that a number of fragments of the work have been recovered in recent years; see chapter 5 of this volume). TheĪPK andĪPKVṛ offer an exoteric explanation for the nature of the divine and the place of the practitioner in the world. They were written by a Brahmin who in his pub lic life would have adhered to caste norms and the associated rules of purity and pollution. Yet, as is well known, Utpaladeva and the other authors of the Pratyabhijñā simultaneously would have allowed, in theory, at least, for the contravention of these rules in the context of the family of tantric initiates, a complex practice summarized by the famous dictum,“internally a Kaula, exter nally a Śaiva, and in social practice a follower of the Veda.”15 (I will return to this maxim in what follows in order to examine the wider textual context in which it is recorded.) 

My contention is that the ĪPK and its commentarial tradition exemplify the possibility of self-consciously introducing religiously—indeed, what are held to be transcendently—authorized innovations, and that they also serve to illus trate and explain the possibilities and limits of such innovations on contempo raneous social life. Consider, to begin, the by now well-known invocatory verse (maṅgala) of Utpaladeva’s masterwork: 

15 See TĀV ad TĀ 4.251ab (vol. 3, p. 278, line 5): antaḥ kaulo bahiḥ śaivo lokācāre tu vaidikaḥ. Cf. TĀV ad TĀ 4.24cd–25ab (vol. 3, p. 27, line 11). 

I note that there is a difference in the writings of Utpaladeva, Somānanda, and Abhi navagupta as regards the place of the norms of varṇāśramadharma; for, the latter two authors were more explicit in their understanding of the merely conventional nature of such social distinctions than was Utpaladeva (in the ĪPK and ĪPKVṛ, at least). 
 

innovation and social change in the vale of kashmir 293 

Having somehow become a servant of Maheśvara, wishing to offer assis tance to all people ( janasyāpi), I will facilitate the recognition of [the Lord], which brings about the achievement of all successes.16 

Utpaladeva’s stated wish to assist “all people” ( janasyāpi) requires further examination, and I will return to this statement in what follows. More immedi ately, one may note two key and perhaps obvious qualities of the maṅgala as it is offered to the reader. First, Utpaladeva claims access to the transcendent, for he says he has “somehow become a servant of Maheśvara,” i.e., of Śiva. Second, he promises to bring others to a similar level of accomplishment by account ing for his insight in the very text that is to hand, paving a path for others to the same ennobled state. 

The first quality is anticipated in the maṅgalawith which Somānanda opens his Śivadṛṣṭi (hereafter ŚD), a verse that is also by now well known: 

May Śiva, who has penetrated/possessed my form by warding himself off by means of his own self, pay homage to his (all-)extensive self by means of his own power.17 

Here, as before, the author’s association with Śiva is noted, though it is rather more prominently asseverated than is the association with Śiva described by Utpala in the ĪPK—for the ŚD uses the Kaula scriptural idiom of possession. We thus clearly are not met with those who count themselves merely to be informed intellectuals, but with those who claim to be both scholars and practi tioners, who understand themselves to be close to—or in fact the very embod iment of—God in the form of Śiva. 

So much is confirmed in the history of the transmission of the teachings of the Pratyabhijñā that is found in a textual passage appended to the Śivadṛṣṭi, said to be an autobiographical account of Utpaladeva’s teacher, Somānanda.18 

16 See ĪPK 1.1.1: kathañcid āsādya maheśvarasya dāsyaṃ janasyāpy upakāram icchan |samas tasaṃpatsamavāptihetuṃ tatpratyabhijñām upapādayāmi. 

17 See ŚD 1.1: asmadrūpasamāviṣṭaḥ svātmanātmanivāraṇe | śivaḥ karotu nijayā namaḥ śak tyā tatātmane. 

18 An edition and translation of this “autobiography” may be found in Nemec 2011, 22–24. As noted there, I have my doubts about the authenticity of the passage as autobiogra phy, and rather think it is something probably composed after Somānanda’s day, but I here note that it is likely to have existed by the eleventh century, as it is replicated, to a substantial degree, in Abhinavagupta’s Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛtivimarśinī (ĪPVV), which explicitly associates the narrative with the ŚD itself. (See below, especially footnote 33.)

While this quasi-mythological passage claims a divine origin for the Pratyabhi jñā, origins that were shrouded with secrecy, it emphasizes the emergent quality of the teachings—their very entry from obscurity into circulation among men, or, in a word, their novelty. For the teachings, we are told therein,19 were kept by “great-souled sages” (mahātmanām ṛṣīṇām) until they retreated from the world at the dawn of the Kali Yuga, at which point it was incumbent on God (deva) himself to cross down to earth “in order to grace [humanity]” (devaḥ … anugrahāyāvatīrṇaḥ … bhūtale).20 This he did by instructing the irascible and imprecating sage Durvāsas to perpetuate the lineage of initiates. Durvāsas is said to do so by producing a mind-born son named Tryambakāditya, who stands at the head of a fifteen-generation lineage of such mind-born Siddhas (all named Tryambaka).21 The last falls in love with a Brahmin woman who bears him a son named Saṃgamāditya. He in turn is said to have moved to Kashmir,22 and over the course of the generations the lineage and its esoteric teachings were passed down to Somānanda. Thus, we are told, the teachings were not lost (nocchidyate). 

I would further suggest that the type of autobiographical expression offered by Somānanda is also found in Abhinavagupta’s famed autograph verse, with which he opens virtually all his Trika commentarial works and which Sander son has examined, already, in detail. Sanderson (2005, 89) has rendered this bivalent (śleṣa) maṅgala verse as follows: 

May my heart shine forth, embodying the bliss of the ultimate, [for it is] {one with the state of absolute potential made manifest in the fusion of these two, the ‘Mother’ grounded in pure representation, radiant in ever new genesis, and the ‘Father’, all-enfolding [Bhairava], who maintains the light [of consciousness] through his five faces} / { formed from the emis sions produced through the fusion of these two, my mother Vimalā, whose

These expressions, in turn, reflect the tradition of the poet’s autograph verse, which, it must be added, is something of a late phenomenon in the history of Indian literature. I offer for comparative purposes one example thereof, that of Ratnākara (as rendered by David Smith), which opens his famed Haravijaya: 

Ratnākara, son of Amṛtabhānu who was the son of him who lived at Gaṅ gāhrada on Himādri’s peak and was of Śrīdurgadatta’s lineage, wrote this poem, a lovely composition, which is beautiful because it is based on the deeds of Śiva, whose crest is the digit of the moon.24 

The similarities lie precisely in the fact that by identifying his parentage and/or family lineage each author stakes a claim to his unique biography and thereby his historicality, even if each does so without explicitly situating himself histori cally with any traceable reference to a calendrical date or reign of any particular royal sovereign. The autograph, then, furnishes precisely what this term sug gests, a marker of the unique identity of the author.25 

23 The verse reads as follows: vimalakalāśrayābhinavasṛṣṭimahā jananī bharitatanuś ca pa ñcamukhaguptarucir janakaḥ | tadubhayayāmalasphuritabhāvavisargamayaṃ hṛdayam anuttarāmṛtakulaṃ mama saṃsphuratāt. See Sanderson 2005, 89. 

24 The verse reads as follows: śrīdurgadattanijavaṃśahimādrisānugaṅgāhradāśrayasuta- ̄mṛtabhānusūnuḥ | ratnākaro lalitabandham idaṃ vyadhatta candrārdhacūlacaritāśraya cāru kāvyam. See Smith 1985, 104. 

25 One may observe that only authors of particular genres reveal much of anything of them selves: some authors never compose autograph verses, or anything similar to them. Thus, while the poets who clearly worked in the royal courts of Kashmir reveal parts of their own biographies to the reader, or at the least are willing to acknowledge themselves as biographical figures, we conversely know little from the playwrights of their parentage or their place in the world, nor do the philosophers reveal much of themselves (though Kalhaṇa places many such figures in history in his Rājataraṅgiṇī). 

It is clear that the Śaivas of concern in this essay were willing to think of and talk about themselves in a language that best pairs—at least up until the time when they lived—with the literary agents who operated in the “secular” arena of the royal court. In Somānanda’s case, his personal story is, as we have seen, offered in semi-mythological terms; Utpaladeva’s is presented in the maṅgala of a text that he surely would have had circulated in intellectual circles, probably those connected, in some significant ways, to the royal court. All of this clearly signals some sense of—some self-conscious awareness and articulation of—historical location, which is proximate to a self-conscious awareness and articulation of novelty. Abhinavagupta’s autograph verse in particular is, in my view, most like those of the poets, and it certainly indicates his very entrance into historicality, however extraordinary and exulted he wished to suggest his entrance may have been. 
 

296 nemec 

It bears reiterating that the historical accuracy of such accounts is not here pertinent; what is of concern in these and other similar expressions is the fact that their authors conceive of themselves not only in terms of their historicality, the mere fact that they appear in time, but also in terms of their historicity:26 the authors in question claim for themselves—and whatever (religious) authority they claim—the possibility of being mapped historically, located in particular social, political, religious, and other contexts due to their own distinguishable personages and individual biographies. 

Most significant is the fact that Utpaladeva is explicit in the ĪPK about the nature and significance of the spiritual path he describes: it is not only efficient and effective, but it isexplicitly new.27 This Utpaladeva tells us in the concluding passage of the fourth and final section (adhikāra) of the work, where, reflecting on his completed text, he says: 

26 I here adopt the distinction between historicality and historicity as defined by J.N. Mohanty (2010, 334): “Historicality is the property of being in history. Historicity is the condition of the possibility of history. One can distinguish between three levels of his toricity: historicity of human existence; historicity of a culture; and historicity of scientific thinking and, in the long run, philosophy. A mere fact or an event does not have historicity. Only an ideal meaning, as Derrida insists in his work on Husserl, can have it.” 

27 That this is so is significant, for it is indeed the case that such expressions of novelty are relatively scarce in premodern Sanskrit sources, as Pollock has noted. But they are not entirely absent, and one suspects that scholars will find a greater number of such pas sages as they continue to look for them. See Pollock 1989, 606: “To an astonishing degree Sanskrit texts are anonymous or pseudonymous, or might just as well be. The strategy of eliminating from the text—whatever sort of text it might be—the personality of the author and anything else that could help us situate the text in time is a formal correlate of a content invariably marked by ahistoricality. Works on statecraft, for example, describe their subject without specific reference to a single historically existing state. Books on law expatiate on such crucial questions as the relationship between local practices and gen eral codes of conduct without adducing any particularized events or cases. Belles-lettres seem virtually without date or place, or indeed, author. Literary criticism prior to the tenth century (Ānandavardhana) neither mentions the name nor cites the work of any poet, the ālaṃkārikas themselves supplying all examples. Philosophical disputation takes place without the oppositional interlocutor ever being named and doxographies make no attempt to ascribe the religious-philosophical doctrines they review to anyone, unless a mythological personage. Even in those texts whose historical vision I suggest merits particular reconsideration—Raghuvaṃśa, for instance—referentiality remains somehow unanchored:We are indeed told that it is the Bengalis that Raghu uproots (4.36), the Kalin gas he attacks (38), the Pandyas he scorches (49), the hair of the Kerala women upon which he sprinkles the dust of his army (54), and so on, but if the digvijaya has local contours, it remains essentially timeless. In short, we can read thousands of pages of Sanskrit on any imaginable subject and not encounter a single passing reference to a historical person, place, or event—or at least to any that, historically speaking, matters.” 
 

Thus I have set forth this new (nava), easy path as it was explained by my distinguished teacher [Somānanda] in the śāstra, [entitled] the Śivadṛṣṭi.28 

We see this sentiment reiterated, moreover, in the ĪPKVṛ, where Utpaladeva glosses the term “new” (nava) with the synonym abhinava;29 and Abhinav agupta reproduces this latter term in the shorter of his two sub-commentaries, the Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī (ĪPV), where he adds that the path in question is both “included in” all the various secretśāstras (sarvarahasyaśāstrāntargata) and, because it has been concealed from public view, is not well known (san nigūḍhatvād aprasiddha).30 

Isabelle Ratié, the first scholar explicitly to note the significance of this passage, has suggested that Utpaladeva refers to the novelty of the path he described in the ĪPK because he wishes to indicate that it does not authenti cate itself by any overt appeal to scripture.31 Now, it is undoubtedly the case that the Kārikās are unmistakably philosophical in tone and content, and that they require no special or extensive knowledge of esoteric scriptural sources for their comprehension; and one may note that Utpaladeva’s teacher, Somānanda, similarly obscured the scriptural influences on his articulation of the Pratya bhijñā.32 

28 See ĪPK 4.16ab: iti prakaṭito mayā sughaṭa eṣa mārgo navo mahāgurubhir ucyate sma śivadṛṣṭiśāstre yathā |. 

29 See ĪPKVṛ ad ĪPK 4.16: so ’yam avakra evābhinavo mārgaḥ sākṣātkṛtaparameśvarabhaṭ ṭārakākārair bhaṭṭaśrīsomānandapādaiḥ śivadṛṣṭināmni prakaraṇe nirdiṣṭo mayā yuktini bandhanena hṛdayaṃgamīkṛtaḥ. etatpariśīlanena śivatāveśāt jīvann eva mukto bhavati. “This new, direct path was foretold in the treatise entitled the Śivadṛṣṭi by the venerable Somānanda, whose very appearance is that of the great lord Parameśvara in front of one’s eyes; I have made it [i.e., this path] enter the heart(s) (of men) by furnishing a logical justi fication for it. By pursuing this [path] one becomes liberated in this very life [ jīvann eva], this as a result of being (fully) penetrated by Śiva-nature.” 

30 See ĪPV ad ĪPK 4.16: asmatparasmeṣṭhibhaṭṭārakaśrīsomānandapādaiḥ śivadṛṣṭiśāstre ’yam abhinavaḥ sarvarahasyaśāstrāntargataḥ sannigūḍhatvād aprasiddho bāhyāntara caryāprāṇāyāmādikleśaprayāsakalāvirahāt sughaṭas tāvad uktaḥ … “This new, easy [path]—(easy) because it lacks in the (need for) skill in the external and internal exertions (usually required) for the (removal of one’s) afflictions, [practices] such as appropriate conduct [caryā] and breath exercises [prāṇāyāma]—which is included in all the secret śāstras, (and) is not well known since it has been concealed from public view, was first explained in the śāstra (entitled) the Śivadṛṣṭi by the venerable Somānanda, our great grand guru.” 

31 See Ratié 2011, 6 (and especially note 8): “Pourtant, Utpaladeva lui-même présente la Pratyabhijñā comme une ‘voie nouvelle’ (mārgo navaḥ). Nouvelle, elle l’est avant tout au sens où elle ne fait pas appel à l’autorité scripturaire.” 

32 About this phenomenon, see Nemec 2011, 12–19.

I would propose, however, that one must understand a rather different jus tification for Utpaladeva’s description of the path he describes as “new.” It is not—or, rather, it is not merely—the fact that one need not appeal to Śaiva scriptures to follow it; rather, I suggest that the primary sense of Utpaladeva’s description of the path as “new” is that it is new to humanity. As is evinced in Somānanda’s “autobiography,” the Pratyabhijñā teachings were said to have been concealed by great sages at the beginning of the Kali Age, preserved as they were by means of the secret lineage described therein, and were only revealed subsequently for the benefit of those who would come to be initiated into its ways. Some justification for linking these mythological origins to the attested novelty of the path may be found, moreover, in the fact that Abhinava gupta explicitly invokes the narrative found in Somānanda’s“autobiography” in a passage of the ĪPVV that comments on ĪPK 4.16, precisely the verse in which the novelty of the Pratyabhijñā’s path is proclaimed. And in doing so Abhinav agupta may be understood himself to associate the lineage with Utpaladeva’s claim to novelty.33 

The Pratyabhijñā thus presents the reader with a self-conscious (theoretical) understanding of their śāstra as divinely sanctioned, guaranteed by the iden tity of the authors in the lineage with Śiva himself; and, while thus divinely sanctioned, the śāstras are intimately, inextricably, tied to the biographies of individual, monadic agents—Utpaladeva, Somānanda, and those preceding and following them in their lineage. Thus, and perhaps not unlike the theology 

33 ĪPVV ad ĪPK 4.16 (vol. 3, p. 402, lines 14–20): śivadṛṣṭīti tadgatam ā śrīkaṇṭhanāthāt guru parvakramaṃ sūcayati. tatra hi śrīśrīkaṇṭhanāthaḥ śāsane samutsanne śrīdurvāsomuniṃ tadavatāraṇāya dideśa, so ’pi śrītryambakādityaṃtraiyambakākhye lokaprasiddhyātairim bābhidhāne gurusantāne pravartayitāraṃ mānasaṃ sasarja—ityādi vitatyoktam. śrīkaṇ ṭhanāthaś cādhigatatattvaḥ śrīmadanantanāthāt, so ’pi śrībhagavacchaktita ityādy āga meṣu nirūpitam iti saṃpūrṇo guruparvakrama uktaḥ. 

Compare, in the following graph, the lineages as articulated in the ĪPVV and the ŚD “Autobiography,” with coincident names in the respective lineages underlined: 

ĪPVV: Bhagavacchakti → Anantanātha → Śrīkaṇṭhanātha → Durvāsas → Tryambakāditya. 

ŚD “Autobiography”: Śrīkaṇṭha → Durvāsas → Tryambakāditya → 14 Tryambaka-s → Saṃgamāditya → Varṣāditya → Aruṇāditya → Ānanda → Somānan 

da. 

Clearly, Abhinavagupta wishes both partially to confirm the lineage offered in the “autobi ography” and also to add to it at the top the persons Bhagavacchakti and Anantanātha. (Or, if the composition of the ŚD “autobiography” postdates that of the ĪPVV, one may instead conjecture that the author of the former wished to add to the lineage of the latter at the tail end of the same.)

associated with, e.g., the avatāra theory, we are here offered a view of Siddhas or “Perfected Ones” who have emerged in human form in the world in their partic ular historical contexts, contexts to which they could—and did—actively and explicitly respond. Finally, this concurrence of historicity and divine author ity allows the ĪPK in particular to claim to offer something that is plainly and explicitly “new” (nava), yet nevertheless “transcendent,” even “timeless,” as it were, insofar as authorized by Śiva himself. The Pratyabhijñā thus achieves in its explicit and implicit theoretical formulations the apparently paradoxical aims of offering something both historically located and new, on the one hand, and transcendent, on the other, the teachings being ultimately authored and authorized by Śiva himself and thus held to be uncontained by any historical bounds. 

4 The Kashmiri, Śaiva Example in Practice 

This much, then, represents the Kashmiri non-dual Śaivas’ theory, their self conscious view of the place of their śāstra and those who carry it in history. But, what of their practices? What did their theory suggest they should do, and what, so far as can be known, did they do? 

As is well known, the Śaivas of the Pratyabhijñā understood the various prac tices related to varṇa or birth to involve mere social custom, their view being that caste identity was not based in any real difference in the natures of the individuals so marked by it. We see this view exemplified perhaps nowhere more clearly than in a passage of Somānanda’s ŚD (at 3.42cd–47), where the question of the need to purify a fire installed in an outcaste’s, a caṇḍāla’s,34 house is addressed: 

svecchāto bhāvarūpatve parādhīnā kutaḥ sthitiḥ 3.42

Given that he [i.e., Śiva] exists of his own volition in the form of (all) the entities (that make up the universe), how is existence dependent on another than himself? If, for example, you say it [i.e., the purported dependence] is one similar to (the example of curds, whose genesis depends on the) milk (of which they are comprised), it [i.e., the universe] would be insentient, dependent on another. The fault (attributed to our system) that must be corrected—being pure, being diminished, or the like—is precisely the result of this (wrong) point of view. How can there be something pure, something diminished, etc., when his nature is undi vided? The fact of being gold simply exists in gold, (be it) in (the form of) a golden spittoon, etc., or in (the form of) a tiara, etc. The (fact of being) gold is in no way divided [i.e., differentiated] whatsoever.If you argue that a fire installed in an outcaste’s house is not (properly) called a fire [i.e., it is not a proper, ritually-purified fire], we reply: that may be so [i.e., this does not contradict our notion of the uniformity of the nature of fire as such]. But, if you say (in reply) that injunctions involving the rites of pas sage for fire are explained in the (Śaiva) teachings, (we reply:) what is the goal of the (ritual) action (in question)? It is the action itself.35 There is no division of its [i.e., the fire’s] nature, here. It is the same for his [i.e., Śiva’s] abiding there [in the world]: that [i.e., the distinguishing of “pure” from “impure” elements in the world, or the distinction of that which is said to be Śiva and that which is said not to be] is conceived of merely as the assignation of names for the purpose of everyday speech/everyday activity [vyavahāra].36 

35 In other words, there is no substantial change in the fire qua being fire that results from the performance of the ritual. It is a social custom, not something that materially transforms the fire so treated. 

36 See also the ŚDVṛ on the same passage: atha vahner yady aśuddhatā na syāt tat tasya kuto mantraiḥ saṃskārayogaḥ kāryasaṃpādanārthaṃ śāstre codyeta tasmāt tasyāśud dhatā saṃbhavet. naivam kāryam evānuṣṭheyam eva tad vyavahārāya na tu svarūpe vah ner vibhāgaḥ, svarūpe nijarūpe sthite tu vahnāv upagamyamāne tatsvarūpatā vahnirū pataiva sarvatra.tadvac chivarūpatā jagatastasya,tatheśvaratanmātrapṛthivyādirūpatayā vyavasthānāt parasthūlasūkṣmatādibhedaḥ. tathā ca sarvatraikye saṃsāravyavahārāya saṃjñākaraṇamātraṃ tat kalpitaṃ bhavati. “Now, if you argue that, if fire cannot be impure, then it is inexplicable why the rites of passage, replete with the mantras, are enjoined to it in the (Śaiva) teaching(s), this for the purpose of accomplishing their (puri fying) effect; thus, it must be possible that [fire] can be impure, (we reply:) this is not so. The rite itself is simply established for the purpose of everyday speech/activity, while

That caste distinctions should not disqualify anyone from hearing the teach ings of the ĪPK has also been stated plainly enough, if somewhat obliquely, in the maṅgala verse of the ĪPK, where, as noted above, the “new path” (nava mārga) is explicitly said to be offered to “all people” ( janasyāpi). While the maṅgala is merely suggestive of any implications regarding caste, however, the ĪPKVṛ and Abhinavagupta’s ĪPV and ĪPVV further clarify what is intended by the expression; and what Utpaladeva means by “all people” is explained with increasing clarity as one delves into the succeeding levels of commentary. 

The ĪPKVṛ indicates that one should understand the term to refer to all people without exception: Utpaladeva glosses janasyāpi with imam akhilam.37 Abhinavagupta, in turn, addresses the caste implications of this pledge—to help all people—in a more explicit fashion.In the ĪPV subcommentary, he indi cates that the term jana refers to any person regardless of the circumstances of his birth ( janasyeti yaḥ kaścij jāyamānaḥ tasya); and he further specifies that no distinction by the “office” held by a candidate for initiation (adhikāriviṣaya) may serve to restrict access to the teachings of the Pratyabhijñā.38 He later adds that the term in question should be understood to refer to anyone afflicted by the suffering of incessant births and deaths.39 

Finally, Abhinava also is explicit, in both the ĪPV and ĪPVV, in stating that jāti should not be considered an appropriate measure of a candidate’s eligibil ity for entry into the soteriological path of the Pratyabhijñā. This he does in the passages of his two sub-commentaries that address the concluding verse of the Kārikās, where Utpaladeva has again indicated that the text is meant for “[all] people.” Referring to himself in the third person, he says (at ĪPK 4.18):40 

there is no change in the nature of the fire. Rather, it being established that fire is fixed in its nature, i.e., in its own form, the fact of having that nature, i.e., the very fact of being fire, exists in every instance (of fire). Similarly, the universe has Śiva as its nature. Thus, divi sion into the fact of being supreme, coarse, and subtle, etc., exists as a result of (the same Śiva) being established in the form of the Lord, the subtle elements, the earth, etc. And thus, there being oneness everywhere, that [i.e., such categorization or division of Śiva nature] is conceived of as merely the assignation of names for the purpose of everyday speech/everyday activity in saṃsāra.”

In order that [all] people ( jana) can attain perfection effortlessly, Utpala, the son of Udayākara, has presented this Īśvarapratyabhijñā [treatise]. 

Abhinava’s ĪPV suggests that with “people” ( jana) Utpaladeva refers to any person, for neither jāti nor any other criterion is innately disqualifying.41 He reiterates the same in the ĪPVV as well, where, additionally, he excludes the individual’s “conduct” (ācāra) from consideration in determining whom the teachings may help.42 Note also that the ĪPVV explicitly links the present pas sage with the one found at the beginning of the ĪPK, saying:etac ca prārambha evāsmābhir vitatam.43 Simply, distinctions marked by birth—including caste distinctions—are to be ignored. 

The professed catholic reach of the work is significant, not only due to its inclusivism, a quality well attested in the context of tantric rules of initiation, even if this cannot be taken to imply the existence in practice “on the ground” of a concomitant equality of participation, or status, within the context of the initiatory “family” (kula); but it is further significant that it is declared, albeit obliquely, in the ĪPK (and ĪPKVṛ), a text (and commentary) that has all the hallmarks of works intended for audiences of non-initiates.44 I submit that there must have been some appreciation for a certain novelty in the appar ent inclusivism professed in the work. This, then, may constitute another rea son for Utpaladeva’s description of the Pratyabhijñā path as “new”: it offers a certain novelty in being (more or less explicitly) indifferent to caste distinc tions. 

While the use of the term jana in the ĪPK offers a certain ambiguity of expression, Abhinava’s subcommentaries are explicit in stating the inclusivism of the śāstra. One can thus see operative here a certain stratification of expres sion, a certain obliqueness with regard to any reference to caste in the ĪPK and ĪPKVṛ, but a more explicit asseveration of the sociological parameters of the tradition in Abhinavagupta’s sub-commentaries. So much of course reflects the

See also the avataraṇikā to ĪPK 4.18 (ĪPV, vol. 2., p. 275, line 14), where Abhinava describes the śāstra in question as one that can help “everyone”: sarvopakārakaṃ mahāphalam idaṃ śāstraṃ …

complex of practice of the tradition, exemplified as it is by the dictum quoted above, “internally a Kaula, externally a Śaiva, and in social practice a follower of the Veda.” 

This dictum and the complex practice it invokes—one of engaging differ ent rules and norms in differing contexts—is explicitly tied to the question of social practices, those associated with caste and life-stages, as the context pro vided by Jayaratha for this quotation clearly indicates. For he considers the sig nificance of preserving the social order—varṇāśramācāra—precisely where he quotes the complex form of practice that is here of concern.45 Moreover, the entire matter is raised in the context of coming to understand precisely whether the Śaiva practitioner should respect the Veda-based rules of purity and impurity.

“Thus, [Abhinavagupta] says that, since it is superior to all (other śāstras), what is to be done is fixed in its primary sense in the Śaiva śāstra alone and not elsewhere: ‘Therefore, O Skanda, one need not observe the rules of the (everyday) world as though they were of primary importance.’ 

However, the sense (of this passage) in its secondary meaning, absent of what is fixed (to be done), is that no fault accrues to the one who performs lokadharma for the purpose of protecting the people/world [loka]. The following is said on the mat ter: 

‘Moreover, one should not cause the well-known, proper customs of the country (in which one lives) to go awry, these being ( ye) the societal [laukikāḥ] acts of conduct associated with varṇa and āśrama and the expiatory acts. From the time beginning with the ceremony before conception and until one has performed the wedding cere mony, Vedic acts (are to be enjoined). Following this, one is to be devoted to the Śaiva [path] and no other. Indeed, O Skanda, one need not perform the rules of the (every day) world as though they were of primary importance.’ 

For this very reason: 

‘Internally a Kaula, externally a Śaiva, and in social practice a follower of the Veda, having extracted the essence, one should remain, as does the fruit of the coconut.’”

“Here, the Lord has explained the appropriate conduct (of the accomplished yogin) in the 18th chapter (of the Mālinīvijayottaratantra): ‘There is no purity here, nor impu rity, no consideration of what is to be eaten, etc. There is no duality, nor non-duality, and no (requirement to perform) acts of devotion to the liṅga, etc. There is similarly no (requisite) abandoning of those [acts], nor the (required) renunciation of mate rial possessions, nor again any (requirement regarding the) accumulation of material possessions. There is no (requisite) maintenance of twisted locks of hair [ jaṭā], of (smearing oneself with) sacred ashes, or the like, nor any (requisite) abandoning of the same. And as regards the performance or non-performance of vows, etc., and entrance into sacred places, etc. [i.e., kṣetras, pīṭhas, and upapīṭhas; see TĀ 4.259cd and the TĀV thereupon], the observance of rules of action, and (those rules associated with) initia tory name, initiatory lineage [gotra], or the like [i.e., according to the lodge (ghara) and the like of the initiate; see TĀ 4.267cd], whether the form, sectarian marks, and so on be one’s own or another’s—nothing is prescribed here regarding these, nor, con trariwise, prohibited. Absolutely everything is performed here [according to the rules of the Mālinīvijayottara], and, contrariwise, omitted. Yet, this (alone) is necessarily enjoined here [in the Mālinīvijayottara], O Goddess, that the wholly pleased yogin must fix his consciousness [cetas] on reality; and he should therefore act only in accor dance with that [reality (tattva)], whatever that may be for him. Moreover, the one whose consciousness [citta] is fixed on reality, partaking even in the pleasures of the senses [viṣaya], is not touched by bad consequences, just as the petal of a lotus (is not affected) by water. The yogin who has great understanding [mahāmati] is the one who is similar to the person who, armed with mantras that counteract poison and the like, is not deluded by the poison even while devouring it.’”

that it is the matter of śuddhi and aśuddhi, as in was in ŚD 3.42cd–47, which is here (at TĀ 4.213cd) explicitly placed in question. The TĀ and TĀV go on to sug gest that yogis know for themselves what is pure, what impure; and they further state that it is their very awareness that should determine how they act, for the normative rules of purity do not apply to them.47 

Following this, the key objection is raised: are there not (Vedic) injunctions that require one to follow the rules of purity?48 The opponent asks, that is, whether tantric Brahmins must respect Vedic authority as well as Śaiva truths. How is it that, given the apparent validity or “truth” of both sets of śāstric injunction, the Vedic and the Śaiva, one can be invalidated, the other affirmed? How can one be internally a Kaula, externally a Śaiva, and a Vaidika in social practices when to be one sometimes requires one to contravene the strictures of the other? 

The answer given not only suggests that it is not always inappropriate in practice to contravene the rules of purity and impurity, of śuddhi and aśud dhi; it further offers a rationale—a theory—for this complex of practice. This it does by invoking a general, and common, śāstricsensibility, namely, that the śāstras operate by first issuing blanket rules, which may later be superseded in certain specified contexts. This is a fundamental organizational structure of, among other śāstric works,49 the system of Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī—which (as is well known) sets out exhaustively to account for correct speech not by listing every possibleform of speech, but by structuring classes of rules thatfirst define the utsarga or generally applicable rule, only then to itemize the apavādas or 

47 See TĀ (and TĀV ad) 4.228ab (vol. 3, p. 249, lines 4–12):

“ ‘As regards the yogin, moreover, that purity exists with respect to (all) entities.’ Indeed, the majority of bound souls do not perceive even (Śaiva) mantras as hav ing Śiva-nature, and therefore they suppose them to be impure, since they fail (even) to perform their own duties (in employing these mantras). But, as for the yogin, he perceives (everything,) beginning with the earth(-tattva), as having that [Śiva-nature]. Therefore, (he perceives that) all of them without exception are completely pure. Indeed, this alone is the very nature of the yogin as a yogin, that he perceives this entire universe as possessed of Śiva-nature. This is definitive.” 

48 See TĀ 4.228cd (vol. 3, p. 250, lines 4–5): nanu codanayā śuddhyaśuddhyādikaviniścayaḥ. “Objection: a fixed knowledge of purity, impurity, and so on exists by way of (Vedic) injunc tion(s) [codanayā].”

exceptional rules that can override the former in the appropriate contexts. So much is explained in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya as follows:50 

Now, one may object by asking whether it isn’t the case that, when this (system of) instruction of (correct) speech is operative, one must recite each word in the course of acquiring the (correct forms of) words. (That is:) Every word must be recited, as in ‘cow, horse, man, elephant, bird, deer, Brahmin.’ Reply: Certainly not! It is not expedient to recite each word in the course of acquiring the (correct forms of) words. For, so much has been communicated as follows: ‘Bṛhaspati imparted to Indra the study of words by uttering each one individually over the course of a thou sand divine years, and he did not reach the end of it.’ Bṛhaspati was the teacher [pravaktṛ], and Indra was the student [adhyetṛ]; and the time of instruction did not reach its terminus over the course of a thousand divine years. What of (the use of this method) today? One who plainly lives a long time (today) lives for (only) a hundred years … How, then, should these (correct) words be acquired? A certain characteristic asso ciated with the generic [sāmānya] and the particular [viśeṣa] should be activated, by means of which [people] can—with little effort—become acquainted with the extremely massive flood of words. What, pray tell, is that? Utsarga and apavāda. A general rule [utsarga] is (first) to be employed; (then,) an exception [apavāda](, which overturns the general rule). But under what circumstances is the general rule to be used, under what circumstances the exception? The general rule is to be used generi cally. E.g.: karmaṇy aṇ (A 3.2.1). The exception to it (should be used) in a particular circumstance. E.g.: āto ’nupasarge kaḥ (A 3.2.3). 

50 See Paspaśāhnika (7) of Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya: utsarga and apavāda, vol. 1, p. 5, line 24 and following of the Kielhorn edition: athaitasmiñ śabdopadeśe sati kiṃ śabdānām prati pattau pratipadapāṭhaḥ kartavyaḥ. gaur aśvaḥ puruṣo hastī śakunir mṛgo brāhmaṇa ity evamādayaḥ śabdāḥ paṭhitavyāḥ. na iti āha. anabhyupāyaḥ eṣaḥ śabdānām pratipattau pratipadapāṭhaḥ. evam hi śrūyate. bṛhaspatir indrāya divyaṃ varṣasahasraṃ pratipado ktānāṃ śabdānāṃ śabdapārāyaṇaṃ provāca na antaṃ jagāma. bṛhaspatiś ca pravakten draś ca adhyetā. divyam varṣasahasram adhyayanakālaḥ na ca antaṃ jagāma. kim punar adyatve. yaḥ sarvathā ciraṃ jīvati sa varṣaśataṃ jīvati … kathaṃ tarhīme śabdāḥ pratipa ttavyāḥ. kiñcit sāmānyaviśeṣaval lakṣaṇaṃ pravartyaṃ yenālpena yatnena mahato maha taḥ śabdaughān pratipadyeran. kiṃ punas tat. utsargāpavādau. kaścid utsargaḥ kartavyaḥ kaścid apavādaḥ. kathañjātīyakaḥ punar utsargaḥ kartavyaḥ kathañjātīyako ’pavādaḥ. sāmānyenotsargaḥ kartavyaḥ. tad yathā. karmaṇy aṇ. tasya viśeṣeṇāpavādaḥ. tad yathā. āto ’nupasarge kaḥ. 
 

Here, we see that it is for efficiency’s sake that this model is adopted. And we are given a sample application in Pāṇini’s grammar, the details of which are explained in Appendix A. Essential to recognize is the fact that the pre scription delineated by the general rule, the utsarga, always stands; yet, on some occasions its application is suspended by a special prescription, in the defined context of the apavāda or exceptional rule.51 Whenever no apavāda applies, however, the utsarga automatically prevails, for whenever or wherever the special rule does not apply (or must itself be suspended), one reverts by default—invariably and automatically—to the general, standing rule. 

It is this very śāstric mode that is explicitly invoked by Jayaratha in reference to the very phenomenon we have here, that of a complex of religious practice, Vedic and Śaiva.52 

TĀ 4.230ab: ‘If you argue that this [Śaiva rule] is invalidated by the Vedic one, (we reply:) why shouldn’t it be the other way around?’53 

… 

Considering that one may object by asking how it is that both [śāstras] are equally real, given that in certain contexts the injunction(s) [vidhi] asso ciated with purity and the like are invalidated, even though they apply universally, for all people, [Abhinavagupta] says: 

51 Note, therefore, that the domain of application of the general rule is said to be ubiquitous (sarvatra) at both Kāśikāvṛtti ad A 3.2.1 (which reads, in part: sarvatra karmaṇy upapade dhātor aṇpratyayo bhavati) and in Jayaratha’s explanation of the matter, at TĀV ad TĀ 4.230cd–231ab, for which see below. 

52 See TĀ 4.230–232ab (vol. 3, p. 253, line1 to p. 255, line16), along with the corresponding pas sages of the TĀV (though one should note that, for the sake of brevity, none of the commen tary is here cited of what follows TĀ 4.230ab, excepting the avataraṇikā that introduces 4.230cd–231ab; and only part of the commentary that appears prior to TĀ 4.231cd–232ab is quoted here below):

TĀ 4.230cd–231ab: ‘If you think about it clearly, a rule that is an excep tion [apavāda] invalidates a rule generally applied [sāmānyavihita vidhi], because it applies in a particular domain.’ 

So, if you properly consider the procedure of invalidation, then (you will realize that) no injunction [codanā] whatever loses reality [sattvahāni]. To explain: the rule that is the exception [apavādavidhi]—by nature spe cific because it is (generally) void of any occasion (for application)— supersedes the general rule [utsargavidhi], which, being one that always has met with its occasion (for application), is by nature generally appli cable [sāmānyātmaka]. This is what those who know language say … 

TĀ 4.231cd–232ab: ‘Moreover, purity and impurity, which are generally enjoined, are simply superseded when a man knows reality. This is how it has been explained here [in the Mālinīvijayottara].’ 

In the face of the objections of a more orthodox opponent who demands to know how the less permissive rules of the Veda cannot prevail over Śaiva scrip tures, Abhinavagupta brilliantly inverts the hierarchy by appealing to a main streamsāstricinterpretive rule: it is the exception that preempts the normative, overarching rule and not the other way around. The rule that applies most gen erally, the Vedic one, is the utsarga. It is invariably prescribed—Jayaratha here described the utsarga as sarvatra labdhāvakāśa and sāmānyātmaka—but it is occasionally superseded by the exceptional rule or apavāda (described by Jayaratha as niravakāśatvād viśeṣātmā), where in this instance the apavāda is the Śaiva rule, occasioned as it is by the special knowledge of the accomplished yogin who sees reality for what it is, as transcending the conventions of social position as determined by birth. 

Nevertheless, whenever this special rule does not prevail—viz., outside the confines of tantric knowledge and practice—one must revert by default to con forming to the general rule, the utsarga (i.e., the Veda-based strictures), which is never nullified but only occasionally and temporarily superseded. So much is the position Abhinavagupta articulates in the TĀ, and Jayaratha indicates that in doing so he responds to the potential criticism that tantric rules authorize practices that are proscribed by Vedic norms, implying thereby that the tantric practices should be abandoned. Thiscomplex of practice, offered by Śaivas who engaged in rites that transgressed social and other contemporaneous cultural norms, was thus said to be the necessary product of the mainstream theoretical model that they understood to prescribe it. 

The implications of this exemplar, then, are evident. Divinely sanctioned (in no small part by the authors’ identification with Śiva), the Pratyabhijñā offers a tradition that prescribes exceptional practices that were introduced 
 

innovation and social change in the vale of kashmir 309 

in historical time but are nevertheless rooted in an “ahistorical” authority. The knowledge it offers is fixed in its dimensions: there is no theology of “progress” in thisśāstra. Each śāstra, moreover, Vedic and Tantric, speaks in a voice that in some important sense offers not merely a“knowing how,” but rather a“knowing that”; for each individually denies the possibility of a dialectical relationship between theory (śāstra) and practice (prayoga) in Pollock’s sense of the prob lematic. (New political developments could not alter its vision of the nature of Śiva as a ubiquitous consciousness, for example.) To this extent, then, Pollock’s model is applicable to these śāstras. 

Yet, the tantric śāstra here placed under study nevertheless allows for a the ology of novelty, because its “ahistorical” authority was said to have been intro duced by particular agents in particular historical moments. The system thus allowed for, indeed anticipated, the emergence of new exceptional rules, and because the canon remained open, it was ever possible that another text, a new apavāda as it were, could emerge in a context in which the general parameters of social action—of religious practice or prayoga—otherwise and inevitably would remain operative. 

A dialectic, then, between theory and practice in premodern South Asia, while it might not be found in the self-representation of any single given work, can befound in the proliferation of multiple śāstras,which in supplementing as well as competing with one another could accommodate innovation, explicitly or implicitly, by introducing novel theoretical models as circumstances war ranted. The dialectic may only be found in the scriptural gestalt, however; for, it is only by reading multiple scriptural sources with an awareness of their mutually shared contexts, pedigrees, and, most importantly, structured mutual relations that one might begin to identify patterns of religious (and other forms of) change in Indian premodernity.54 

54 In response to two important observations of Shaman Hatley, who read an earlier draft of this essay, two caveats are here required. First, I wish herein to indicate not that the Pratyabhijñā authors innovated the practice of deriving authority from their siddha hood. This is a practice that indeed predates these authors. Rather, I wish to suggest that such a practice, and others like it such as the avatāra theory, allowed for innovations in tradition—they allowed authors self-consciously and explicitly to introduce unprece dented practices and ideas, what would be new in human history, as those that were religiously—transcendently—sanctioned. Thus, in an example offered from the avatāra theory, Kṛṣṇa deploys novel—and context-appropriate—ways of upholding dharma, even if he is himself ultimately considered to be an emanation of the timeless and transcendent Viṣṇu himself. 

Second, it can be observed (as Hatley did in a personal communication, via email, of November 11, 2015) that the social model that Abhinavagupta has developed is in fact also quite conservative, for while allowing for an innovative social institution that ignores caste 
 

310 nemec 5 Conclusion 

I note, in closing, a concentric series of five implications of this phenomenon, each of an increasing degree of generalization, and in doing so I intend to point to possible avenues of further inquiry that lie beyond the scope of the present (and admittedly particular) case-study. The first involves a relatively narrow methodological concern in the study of Śaiva post-scriptural sources: the present exemplar stands as a reminder that knowledge of the wider con text of “orthodox” śāstric texts and concerns should inform scholarly inter pretations of the post-scriptural literature; for even works that are primarily rooted in and explicitly concerned with esoteric scriptures, as is the TĀV, fre 

distinctions it also synchronizes such practices with the caste-based Brahminical stric tures that were not, historically speaking, espoused in the Kula-Kaula branch of Śaivism; and it limits the transgressive practices by defining them as exceptional, as the (rare) contravention of the overarching, normative structures of Brahminism. (Similarly, Alexis Sanderson, in response to the shortened version of this essay thatI presented at the confer ence held at the University of Toronto in his honor, suggested that what is offered here is a “vertical” model of authority and innovation, as opposed to the more radical, “horizontal” models found elsewhere in the Śaiva traditions, which more fully unshackled themselves from Brahminical norms.) This cannot be denied. There is, in the complex of theory and practice offered by the Pratyabhijñā, a certain preservation of Veda-based tradition. And it is true that there were in premodern South Asia models of change that sought not to mod ify (as Abhinavagupta does) but to upend Brahminical norms. Yet, a distinction here must be made between the degree to which these traditions in fact changed social norms and the fact that they explicitly and self-consciously wedded themselves to the idea that reli gion could offer ideas and practices that were explicitly said to be new. To put the matter differently, one might reasonably argue that Abhinava was somewhat inimical to (social) change—not entirely so, as what he endorses clearly also allows for the contravention of Brahminical norms, in part at least; but he also explicitly does not espouse a view that change is inimical to religious ideas and practices. If it is indeed the case that he—and Utpaladeva—sought to preserve a certain Brahminical order (in part at least), reigning in or domesticating, as it were, the more radical practices of Śaiva and Śākta traditions, it is all the more noteworthy that they did so by explicitly endorsing the possibility of religious change—of changes in ideas and social and other practices—in doing so; for this strategy speaks to the very fact that change, in premodern South Asia, was not inimical to religion, even if, as one might argue, the fact that they said as much was done in service of limiting social change to modifications of Brahminical norms, rather than allowing for the whole sale rejection of them. My own view, as is clarified in the conclusion, is that the model here presented—of change through modification of the normative order—both embraced the idea of change and ushered in changes “on the ground” in religious and social practice; moreover, I maintain that it offers what was the prevalent model of change in premod ern South Asia—that of change through modification as opposed to wholesale change or revolution—and scholars should look for such types of change in places where previous scholarship has only seen a static social and intellectual order.

quently record a substantial interaction with the mainstream systems of learn ing (including both various śāstric systems such as Pāṇinian grammar and the classical philosophical darśanas). 

Second, there is the matter of the social context, the Kashmir Valley of the period in question, in which the authors of the Pratyabhijñā lived and wrote. While it is worth noting that the tantric initiatory “family” (kula) would have frequently offered an uncomfortable home for low-caste and outcaste initiates (as many or few as there might have been in practice), entry into the tantric kula could also have afforded the initiate a certain place of privilege. Initiation was, from the perspective of the tradition, a significant institution, one that the tantric practitioner would have coveted and shared sparingly; and member ship would have conferred not only a certain prestige but also a special form of knowledge that those within the tradition would have held to be paramount: a certain access to the divine. 

Thus, while this form of privilege does relatively little globally to address the social inequities enshrined in normative, caste-based strictures, the initiation of low-caste or outcaste individuals into the secret śāstras nevertheless consti tutes a social innovation over and against preexisting Vedic (or, perhaps more accurately, dharmaśāstric) norms. The change it offers, however, comes not in the form of social revolution but in the form of a particular and circumscribed social inclusion. Generalizing from the present exemplar, one suspects that social change in premodern South Asia will most often be found in its incre mentalism, as opposed to efforts in total revolution such as the toppling of the institution of royal sovereignty or the wholesale displacement of Brahminical authority. Social change, simply, will likely be found, where it is to be found, in the often-subtle exceptions that contradict overarching and often oppressive rules that were more globally applied, in Kashmir or elsewhere, in premodern South Asia. 

Third, the model of social conduct witnessed in the Pratyabhijñā exemplar finds correspondences in the narrative tropes of (non-tantric) Śaiva mythology. Śiva is not only paradoxically erotic and ascetical in the mythological literature, as is well known, but he also appears there as both asocial or anti-social and integrated into society (and often simultaneously so), as is also well known. Take, for example, the insult of Dakṣa’s sacrifice, where Śiva is depicted as a pariah while simultaneously standing as the ideal husband in the eyes of the eminently acceptable Satī. One may therefore query whether the sort of complex of social practice examined in the present essay constitutes a phe nomenon more widely attested across various Śaiva traditions.55 

55 I thank Shaman Hatley for suggesting that, among the various candidates that present

Fourth, the exceptionalism offered by the utsarga-apavāda model is com monly attested across a range of premodern Indian cultural systems, most notably, for the purposes of the present essay, those that address social rules and life. The Kṛṣṇa of the Mahābhārata plainly contravenes a series of gener ally applicable social strictures,for example, rules that he otherwisewouldwish vigorously to maintain; and the rules of conduct for crisis-situations (āpad dharma) more generally are premised on the idea that the prescribed actions are exceptional both because they contravene otherwise normative behaviors and because they are deemed inactionable outside the only context in which they may apply: that of a social emergency. And one cannot overlook, in this context, the frequency with which the Veda is acknowledged as authoritative in Hindu traditions while the contents of Vedic works are nearly entirely ignored. It is common, in sum, to find a layering of practice in South Asian religion and social life; and such complexes of practice, allowing as they do for the exception, in its place, to supersede normative strictures, should probably be counted as the normative model of social organization in premodern South Asia.56 

Fifth and finally, I address an issue relevant to the study of religion, broadly conceived. It is instructive that Pollock appealed to Geertz in formulating the theoretic that defines his understanding of the relationship of śāstra to prayoga. Indeed, he finds Geertz’s famed distinction of “models of” from “mod els for” precisely in the article in which he famously defines religion as “(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realis tic.”57 

Geertz apparently did not anticipate the possibility of a complex of (some times mutually-contradictory) beliefs or a complex of (sometimes mutually contradictory) practices. His model instead elaborates a more singular structure or phenomenon, referring as it does to “a system of symbols” that establishes powerful moods and motivations in men by formulating “a general order of 

themselves for examination along these lines, the anti-caste Vīraśaivas immediately come to mind. 

56 Indeed, the sort of “And” approach that Pollock identifies and endorses (over and against an “Either/Or” approach) elsewhere in his writings owes something, I think, to this intel lectual practice of allowing for exceptions in the context of an overarching normative practice that otherwise prevails. See Pollock 2006, 574–580. Cf. footnote 59. 

57 See Geertz 1973, 89.

existence,” which is clothed in “an aura of factuality,” all of which implies a model of a singular source of religious authority. There is in this, as in other sim ilarly situated definitions,58 an understanding of religion as involving an appeal to an ultimate that does not seem naturally to allow for variegated and equally legitimate sources of authority, that fails to account for the type of “And” model found in South Asia and, one imagines, elsewhere, as well;59 and in defining religion in this manner, we see foreclosed any possibility that a religious tradi tion might innovate or simultaneously access disparate sources of authority in order to recommend diverse—or even new—doctrines and/or practices, as we see in our premodern Indian exemplar. 

The example here studied, then, begs for novel theoretical models of reli gion, ones that could attend more fundamentally or at least more explicitly to the capacity of religion to accommodate, indeed self-consciously to cul tivate, change. To proffer as much would refocus our possible ways of read ing premodern religious traditions, allowing us to identify patterns of social and religious change that are not defined by modern understandings of the same (as exemplified in Pollock’s dependence on the concept of “progress” to measure any conceptual openness to social change in India’s premodernity). It would also require one to cultivate a view of religion that emphasizes not its interest in certainty, in its capacity to memorialize particular ways of act ing or models of knowing—be they models of “knowing that” or “knowing how”—but its interest in possibility. Cultivating such a new model (and thereby a new interpretation, even a new scholarly definition) of religion could, that is, nurture a view of religion that emphasizes its more active and dynamic, and malleable and practical, dimensions, the capacity of religious practitioners and authors themselves self-consciously to formulate systems of understand ing and to stake claims where any number of claims could have possibly been made. 

58 For example, Durkheim’s definition of religion reads as follows: “A religion is a unified sys tem of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden— beliefs and practices which unite in one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.” So too could it be said of a number of others, such as Melford Spiro’s famed and widely accepted definition of religion as “an institution consisting of culturally patterned interaction with culturally postulated superhuman beings.” These and other, similarly-oriented definitions all, if they do not demand it, implicitly lean on the notion that what can be true or significant is something similar to a singular ideal, rather than allowing for the sorts of nuanced and contextually situated notions of what counts that we can find in our Indian exemplar. 

59 I here follow Pollock in distinguishing between the “And” model offered in South Asia and the “Either/Or” model articulated elsewhere. See Pollock 2006, 574–580; cf. footnote 56.

This would, in short, require one to understand religion not primarily as the maps of systems and symbols and practices that are charted by religious agents, but instead in terms of the strategies they use to sketch their maps. Those who have crafted religious ideas and ideals, I think, were—and are—well aware of the fact that religions offer changing models of action and modes of reflection in the context of a changing world that is perennially met with novel problems, begging resolution. Those of us who read and theorize their practices should, in turn, seek to shape our reflections on religion in a manner that allows more nat urally for the innate flexibility, the freedom of possibility—of change—in idea and practice, with which religious agents developed and develop their models for action.

Appendix A: utsarga and apavāda as Exemplified in Aṣṭādhyāyī (A) 3.2.1 and 3.2.3 

3.2.1. karmaṇy aṇ. 

3.2.3. āto ’nupasarge kaḥ. 

1. The Pāṇinian example here offered is of a general rule, or utsarga, that is preempted by a special rule, or apavāda, in a particular circumstance. The general rule is offered at Aṣṭādhyāyī (A) 3.2.1; the special rule is sub sequently given at A 3.2.3. The rules here are used to generate what are referred to as upapadasamāsas. 

2. A principal purpose of the grammar, of course, is to allow one to gen erate the correct form of speech by the application of a series of rules that build, as it were, the correct form of speech in a series of operational steps. The point of the present example is that the general rule, A 3.2.1, regularly—indeed, always—applies,60 unless the parameters of the spe cial rule, A 3.2.3, apply, in which case the general rule is suspended. If the special conditions that trigger the special rule are not met, the general rule is reverted to as authoritative and is applied. 

3. A 3.2.1. states that the affix aṇ is added after a verbal root (dhātoḥ is to be read into A 3.2.1 by anuvṛtti, or ellipsis, from a preceding rule) when the object of the verb is in composition with it as an upapada. This yields, e.g., kumbhakāra (“potter”) and nagarakāra (“city-builder”); kāṇ ḍalāva (“branch-cutter”) and śaralāva (“reed-cutter”); and vedādhyāya (“the learning of the Veda”) and carcāpāṭha (“the reading of Carcā”). In each of these cases, the final “a” of each word is present because of the affixation of aṇ. (The a of aṇ is precisely this letter or akṣara, while the ṇ of aṇ is a “marker,” an anubandha or it, which is dropped out in the derivational process and does not appear in the final form of the given word or words being derived, though it does serve to trigger certain rules and operations in the grammar, and so has a meta-function in the deriva tional process.) 

4. On the other hand, the affix aṇ is not allowed to be added in cases where the special rule found in A 3.2.3 does apply. This rule states that the affix ka will come after a verbal root that ends in “ā,” if and only if the verbal root in question is not preceded by a preverb (upasarga), and only when 

60 Note that so much is made clear by the Kāśikāvṛtti ad A 3.2.1, which reads in part as follows: sarvatra karmaṇy upapade dhātor aṇpratyayo bhavati.

the object of the verb is in composition with it (karmaṇi here is extended from A 3.2.1 to the present rule by way of anuvṛtti or ellipsis). Examples of the application of this special rule are: goda (“giver of cows”) and kambal ada (“giver of a blanket”). In both of these examples, the final “a” of each word is present because of the affixation of ka. (The a of ka is precisely this akṣara, while the k of ka is again a “marker” or anubandha/it that is dropped out in the derivational process and does not appear in the final form of the word being derived.) 

5. If we were to have been able to use the affix aṇ instead of the affix ka in the present pair of examples, we would have been required to preserve the long ā in the verbal root dā, which is present in both examples (goda and kambalada), generating thereby the wrong forms. Using rule 3.2.1 instead of 3.2.3 (and thus using aṇ instead of ka) would give us the wrong forms *godā and *kambaladā in place of goda and kambalada. This would be bad! 

6. Similarly, in an instance where the verb employed does take an upasarga or preverb, we have an exception to the special rule, which prohibits the use of ka in place of aṇ precisely when there is a preverb affixed to the verb. Thus, even when the verbal root in question ends in long ā and is in composition with its object as an upapada, rule 3.2.3 cannot apply. A pair of examples is given with the verbal root dā + sam. The apavāda rule (A 3.2.3) is not allowed to take effect, and therefore ka is not appended to the verb. Thus, we derive gosaṃdāya (“who ceremoniously gives a cow”) and vaḍabasaṃdāya (“who ceremoniously gives a vaḍaba horse”), and here the final vowel (a) of each term is the product of aṇ and not ka. 

7. What is at stake in this last pair of examples (viz., those of gosaṃdāya and vaḍabasaṃdāya) is the status of the long vowel (ā) in the verbal root dā + sam. If the affix ka were used in the present examples, then the “marker” (anubandha, it) kwould have triggered another rule of the gram mar (A 6.4.64, see paragraph 10, below), one that deletes this long vowel. If this marker (k) is notin play, on the other hand, as it is not, for example, when the affix marked with the anubandha ṇ is used (as in aṇ of A 3.2.1.), then the rule in question that deletes the long ā does not apply. 

8. So, to review before concluding: we here have a general rule, A 3.2.1, which applies generally. It is the utsarga. We have a special rule or apavāda (A 3.2.3) that applies within what otherwise would have been the domain of this general rule, but which is commanded by the special rule under special circumstances, with the application of the special rule blocking the application of the general rule or utsarga. 
 

9. How does this figure in the present example? Well, A 3.2.3 should apply wherever we have the requisite special circumstances, namely whenever a verbal root ending in “ā” is in composition with its object as an upapada, as it did in the derivation of goda and kambalada. But the apavāda rule (A 3.2.3) does not apply in the derivations of gosaṃdāya and vaḍabasaṃ dāya, even though in both cases we have a verbal root that ends in ā and that is in composition with its object as an upapada. This is so, because in both cases the verbal root appears with a preverb (upasarga), and A 3.2.3 specifies that it can apply only in instances when there is no preverb (it reads: anupasarge). 

10. Because the examples gosaṃdāya and vaḍabasaṃdāya include a verbal root that appears with an upasarga (the verb is dā, the upasarga or pre verb is sam, of course), they are no longer to be marked by ka. This is significant because of what k does: according to A 6.4.64 (āto lopa iṭi ca), the final ā would have been elided, the rule effecting as much either because it appears before an ārdhadhātuka suffix (defined at A 3.4.114) augmented with iṭ, or when the affix begins (as would have been so in the present instance) with a vowel and has an indicatory marker (aun bandha or it) of k or ṅ (the affix a in ka begins with a vowel—a of course being a vowel and the first member of a single-lettered affix—this after taking into account that the k is a marker and not a part of the affix itself).61 

11. Thus, in these instances A 3.2.3 does not apply. And here is the key to understanding the present example of utsarga and apavāda: the utsarga or general rule (i.e., A 3.2.1) is thus again deemed operative and auto matically so, by default. This is so because it is understood always to apply, only excepting when an apavāda overrules or suspends it. What this means is that there is no need to write yet another rule to account for the derivation in instances where the rule of exception or apavāda is itself rendered inoperative by an exception; for upon the suspension of the apavāda rule, the utsarga is immediately and automatically understood once again to apply. As such—returning now to the pair of examples here reviewed—the final a of gosaṃdāya and vaḍabasaṃdāya results from aṇ being applied, not ka. One returns to the original rule by default, thus pro viding for the final letter a of both gosaṃdāya and vaḍabasaṃdāya. And the anubandha ṇ, unlike k, does not trigger A 6.4.64 and thus does not lead 

61 Note that the Kāśikāvṛtti ad A 6.4.64 reads in part as follows: iḍādāv ārdhadhātuke kṅiti cākārāntasyāṅgasya lopo bhavati.

to the elision of ā in the verbal root dā appearing in both compounded words. In a word, apavādas can only be written in contexts where an utsarga is always otherwise operative.

### 13 Toward a History of the Navarātra, the Autumnal Festival of the Goddess 

Bihani Sarkar 

In this essay, I wish to address the problems a historian encounters while explaining the function and origin of ancient rituals. One is particularly con fronted by these problems when dealing with a ritual such as the Navarātra. With regard to its function, the festival resists sharp distinctions between the sacred and the temporal because it simultaneously propitiates a deity and sol emnizes the authority of a ruler. It seems to be two things at the same time: a rite of religious power and a rite of political power. In fact, in the South ern Navarātra, for instance as celebrated in Vijayanagara, the worship of the Goddess would take place largely out of view in a private shrine, while all the individual rites of the festival appeared to publicly celebrate a cult of the king in the larger communal area: the Navarātra thus appeared, as it did to Portuguese and Persian visitors to the Vijayanagara court, to be a political festival with a minor religious dimension.1 While explaining its origins, we run into even greater difficulty as the earliest traces of the Navarātra are found in more than one distinctive religious tradition: the Vaiṣṇava, the Śaiva, the Purāṇic and even possibly in regional traditions of communities outside mainstream ‘Hindu’ tra ditions. Where it truly “originates” is therefore difficult to see, though for clar ity’s sake I have proposed here that the Vaiṣṇava domain was where a mature, theologically coherent2 conception of the rite evolved. On the whole the ritual appears to have been of a composite character at each stage of its manifesta tion. The overall impression is that we are looking at many permutations of dif ferent rites with different origins that attached themselves around the central figure of the Goddess, and through her, and the demon-slaying mythologies sur rounding her, acquired a structural and thematic unity. In the following, I shall

present and probe these ambiguities of function and origin through a scheme of the richly varied regional traditions of the Navarātra that emerged in the course of its history. 

Navarātra, the autumnal festival of the warrior goddess Caṇḍikā, is today one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the Hindu calendar. Built up over nine lunar days and culminating on a tenth, the festival fulfills several, appar ently disparate, purposes: it offers obligatory worship to the Goddess, without which her wrath could become implacable (so legends warn in dire tones); wards away omens from—and thereby symbolically cleanses and renews—a community of people; and bestows the ritual stamp of victory on the mili tary forces of a kingdom. What is particularly noteworthy even in the mod ern ceremony is the symbolic connection between the political, the martial, and the religious, manifested by a priest through a sequence of meaningfully choreographed rites and staged within a lavishly ornamented arena of worship publicly open to all. Facilitating this connection is the Goddess herself, who intertwines in her being an image of secular rulership and transcendent, or spiritual, sovereignty. Little, though, is understood about the historical reasons for the culmination of this overlap in the figure of Durgā and its ritualized real ization in the ceremony of the Navarātra. Doubtless, the Navarātra, given that it was dedicated to a war-goddess, played a significant role in preparations under taken by a medieval kingdom to wage war, and furthermore, to affirm social structure, as notable studies in the past by Alexis Sanderson (2007, 195–311), Shingo Einoo (1999, 33–70) and Ralph Nicholas (2013) have shown. The sea son of autumn, which in many cultural traditions, and also in classical India, was when armed campaigns would take place, must also have formed a rea son for the presence of military rituals such as the lustration of weapons and war-animals during Durgā’s Navarātra: following the monsoon, during which it is notoriously difficult to make journeys, the autumn, when the skies are clear and the weather cooler, formed the perfect season to venture forth on campaign.3 Doubtless there must also have been an association between social governance, its urban political locus, and the Goddess, as there is in the modern ceremony. But when did the autumnal festival acquire such a role in sanctify ing heroic endeavor, and in affirming roles and functions dispersed within the social organization? For in many Navarātras certain groups and lineages were traditionally associated with particular rituals: for example the priest’s duty, the

cutting of the head of the animal, the making of the effigy, or the provision of virgin girls for worship, etc. This still remains at the forefront of any basic inquiry into the nature of this ritual. 

However, answering this question presents certain methodological compli cations. Literature (primarily in Sanskrit) indicates that during the period the festival developed and was popularized throughout South Asia, viz. the 5th to 12th centuries CE, it grew into a locally diverse tradition. At present these regional traditions seem on the surface to be but tenuously interrelated, and in their diversity forestall our entertaining the possibility of there having been common templates of origination. 

Apart from the Navarātra’s multiplicity of form, other factors have pre vented, it would seem, a full history of the festival from being undertaken— apart from, it is important to note, Einoo’s (1999) pioneering study, “The Autumn Goddess Festival Described in the Purāṇas.” These factors are as fol lows: difficulty in interpreting and evaluating sources; confusion prompted by the presence of non-Brahmanical rituals within an outwardly Purāṇic-Brah manic ritual framework; and ambivalence in status because of the important roles played by people outside the caste-system in the ritual sequence. How ever, these difficulties, confusions and ambivalences are not insuperable, and do in fact point to an important characteristic of the ritual: that its position within either the Brahmanical or the non-Brahmanical realms was never very clear. Both sides claimed certain aspects of the ritual as theirs, and in fact operated in tandem within its domain. A political synergy between different power-groups was effected through the course of the festival, as indeed has been recently shown by Nicholas (2013) and which will grow even more evi dent through surveying the different traditions. 

However, if we look at a wide range of ritual descriptions in Sanskrit con tained in Purāṇas for which the conjectured dates seem reliable, in their reused forms in Dharmaśāstric compendia (nibandhas) and in ritual manuals (pad dhatis), together with ethnographic accounts of ceremonies, where available, a historical pattern begins to emerge. The full analysis of that pattern is treated in my recent book, Heroic Shāktism: the Cult of Durgā in Ancient Indian Kingship, including texts and translations from the relevant ritual descriptions.4 Since it may also be useful to offer a succinct overview of the historical pattern, here I offer a condensed summary of that larger narrative, presented in schematic form below. I also take the opportunity here to include three very early sources that I did not have the opportunity to consider for the arguments made in

my book: the Southern Cilapattikāram,5 and two passages from the Mahāb hārata and the Kādambarī. These offer fresh insights int0—if not the Navarātra proper—the ritual background of the Goddess: her worshippers, their prove nance and the purpose for which she may have been worshipped prior to the development of the liturgical materials on the Navarātra. The consideration of the Southern material in particular leads to re-conceiving the historical devel opment of the Goddess’s worship south of the Vindhya mountains. In the book, I had suggested that 

The Deccan seems to have followed in the wake of the eastern form of the Navarātra outlined in the Devī[purāṇa] and the Kālikā[purāṇa] until at least the early half of the 14th century [on the basis of passages from those works appearing in Deccan Dharmaśāstric nibandha-literature] … The gradual independence of the southern tradition and its advocacy by the 15th century of a Navarātra that was qualitatively different from the east ern tradition in that it celebrated Daśamī differently and eschewed rites that were Tantric in their tone are attested by the eyewitness accounts of the Navarātras of the Vijayanagara kingdom, of Mysore under the Wode yars, of Ramnad and Śivagaṅgai in Tamil Nadu. 

Sarkar 2017, 258–259 

On the other hand, the Cīlapattikāram suggests that already in the early cen turies of the common era, a local form of worshipping the Goddess for power in battle, like the Navarātra, was celebrated in the Tamil country, and that this included possession, trance and bacchanalia. On this basis, it is possible to sug gest, first, that long before descriptions of Durgā’s worship appeared in mate rials of an Eastern provenance, she was popular in the south and, second, that the direction of liturgical influence could have been the other way: the ritual of bacchanalian enjoyment offered to a goddess of battle could have entered into Eastern liturgies, in which they occupy a prominent place, from Southern prototypes. Moreover, all three textual examples are magnificently composed, and exemplify all that is most vivid and energetic in poetry about the Goddess. 

In some of our earliest sources, the rite did not begin in autumnal Āśvina, the month usually associated with the Navarātra. Rather it began in the monsoon month of Śrāvaṇa, and prior to that seems to have been a popular festival cel ebrated by everyone regardless of sectarian affiliation. It then came to replace a more established set of Brahmanical military traditions (such as the worship

of weapons and the lustration of the army) practised in Āśvina. Once these Vedic royal traditions were harmonized with the worship of the Goddess, they altered in character to become a goddess-centred heroic tradition, in which sanguinary rites to calm down Durgā’s fiery nature began to dominate. But fur ther alterations in the character of the ritual followed, as it was incorporated by other religious “specialisms.” One of the most critical transformations to have occurred in the structure of the Navarātra is the appearance of Tantric rituals in descriptions of the rite emerging from East India, notably from Orissa and the kingdom of Mithilā. Compared to the military festival of the earlier Vaiṣṇava and then the Vedicized formats, these rituals amplify the power-bestowing effi cacity of the ritual by including rituals that grant siddhis (powers). Moreover, there is no single goddess, but many, and of many forms, names and natures. In literature from Mithilā, the rite expands to nine days to include, apart from the worship of nine forms of Durgā of different colours, an array of Tantri cized rituals such as the purification of elements (bhūtaśuddhi), the worship of the sixty-four yoginīs, the installation of mantras in the body (nyāsa), self identification with the deity (a ritual that, although also found in pre-tantric materials, came to be associated with tantric practice6), rites bestowing pow ers (siddhi) held at midnight, and the heightening of the Goddess’s personality so that her ferocious properties are thought to take over. She is invoked as Kālī Lauhadaṇḍā (Kālī, goddess of the iron rod) in mantras in the mediaeval Bengali rite. In the Maithila rite she is even summoned as Cāmuṇḍā into a bel branch, which is then worshipped as the vehicle of her essence throughout the dura tion of the worship. In Orissa, as shown by Sanderson (2007), mantra elements from the Kashmirian Kālīkula were incorporated into the Mahānavamī tradi tions of Bhadrakālī. The effect of this Tantricization was the enhancement of the power-bestowing agency of the ritual, desirable no doubt for rulers eager to achieve victory in the battles they were about to undertake.

To the above sources, I would like to add a passage from the Mahābhārata (first noticed and pointed out to me by Sahiṣṇu Bhaṭṭācārya, Bardhaman, West Bengal in a personal communication), whose importance in regard to the wor ship of Nidrā, Durgā’s early form, requires emphasis. This passage appears in the Sauptikaparvan (Mahābhārata X, 8.64–68) and suggests that the Vaiṣṇava Nidrā, goddess of Sleep and Death, presided over and blessed battle as a dan gerous spirit (kṛtyā). Called Kālarātri, identified with apocalyptic destruction, adorned with a peacock feather (śikhaṇḍinīm) that evokes her alliance with her brother Kṛṣṇa, as prevalent in this period,13 she manifests herself when Aśvatthāman, the son of Droṇa, secretly enters the Pāṇdava camp and goes on a murderous rampage. Hers is a strange, menacing apparition:

Mahābhārata X, 8.64–68 

Good sir, they saw her, Kālarātri, standing, smiling, alone, blue-black in hue, with red mouth and eyes, garlands and unguents of crimson, red robes, a noose in one hand, a peacock feather [in her hair], binding men, horses and elephants with her horrifying fetters while she stood, captur ing many headless ghosts trapped in her noose, leading those asleep in their dreams to other Nights (rātriṣv14 anyāsu). And at all times the best soldiers saw the son of Droṇa slaughtering. From the time when the battle between the Kuru and Pāṇḍava armies began, they saw [both] that evil spirit (tām kṛtyām) and the son of Droṇa. The son of Droṇa later felled those who had first been struck by this divinity [Kālarātri], terrorizing all creatures while shouting out ferocious bellows. 

Towering over the nightmarish battlefield, a grinning image of Death, Kālarātri governs both sleep and death, ensuring the interceptor certain triumph during his secret raid. 

The Tantricization of Durgā’s worship must have been well established by 700CE, by which time it must have already been correlated with worship of Śiva, rather than Viṣṇu. Such is the impression created by a minutely detailed description of Durgā’s shrine and her worshipper in Bāṇa’s Kādambarī (pp. 224–22815). On his way from Hemakūṭa to Ujjayinī, the hero of the work, Candrāpīḍa, stops for shelter at a shrine of the Goddess that comes midway. The shrine is nestled in the midst of a densely wooded forest, and the narrative, through a telescoping of perspective from outside to inside the shrine, provides a leisurely description of its design, appearance and atmosphere. From afar Candrāpīḍa first sees a “crimson ensign,” “inscribing the sky with a gold trident, from which swung a terrifying bell making a raucous clanging (ghargharar ava) that dangled down from an iron chain attached to the tip, arranged with a yak-tail whisk as splendid as a lion’s mane” (dolāyitaśṛṅgasaṅgilohaśṛṅkhalā valambamānagharghararavaghoraghaṇṭayā ca ghaṭitakesarisaṭāruciracāma rayā kāñcanatriśūlikayā likhitanabhaḥsthalam … raktadhvajam; p. 224). Going ahead a little, he then sees that the Goddess Caṇḍikā “was enclosed by a door made from the ivory of wild elephants, as yellowish-white as fragments 

14 This appears to be a play with Rātri, another name for this goddess.

of ketakī filaments, and an iron architrave (toraṇa) bearing an ornamental garland of black iron mirrors surrounded by a row of red yak tail whisks resembling a garland of Śabara heads horrific with tawny hair” (ketakīsūcikha ṇḍapāṇḍureṇa vanadviradadantakapāṭena parivṛtāṃ lohatoraṇena ca raktacā maraparikarāṃ kālāyasadarpaṇamaṇḍamālāṃ śabaramukhamālām iva kapi lakeśabhīṣaṇāṃ bibhrāṇena … caṇḍikām; pp. 224–228). Then he notices the dvārapāla (guardian of the gate), about which it is said that “[Caṇḍikā] had protected her entrance with an iron buffalo installed in front, which, because of the fact that it had been marked by palms [dyed with] red-sandalwood, seemed to have been stamped by Yama’s hand-prints red with blood, the red eyes of which were being licked by jackals greedy for drops of blood” (sanāthīkṛta dvāradeśām abhimukhapratiṣṭhena ca vinihitaraktacandanahastakatayā rud hirāruṇayamakaratalāsphāliteneva śoṇitalavalobhalolaśivālihyamānalohitalo canena lohamahiṣeṇa; Kādambarī, p. 224). Then through the main entrance, the temple yard: “Her courtyard was adorned with thickets of red aśoka trees, the spaces between the branches of which were made gapless by flocks of perching red cockerels, [trees] which appeared to reveal unseasonal clusters of blooms in their fear” (śākhāntarālanirantaranilīnaraktakukkuṭakūlaiś ca bhayād akāladarśitakusumastabakair iva raktāśokaviṭapair vibhūṣitāṅgaṇāṃ; p. 225). (More in fact is said about the overflowing mass of flowers, trees and even lion cubs that populate her front courtyard, slippery with blood.) Then the portal to the sanctum sanctorum, a riot of colour and form: “She was being illuminated by the entrance, on which there were hanging cloths reddened by lamp-smoke, a row of bracelets made of peacock-throats festooned [over it], a garland of bells closely-set and pale with powdered flour-cakes, which sup ported two door-panels, [studded] with tin lion heads with thick, iron pins in their centres, barricaded with an ivory-rod bolt, carrying [what seemed to be] a necklace of sparkling bubbles that were mirrors oozing yellow, blue and red [light]” (avalambamānadīpadhūmaraktāṃśukena grathitaśikhigalavalayāva linā piṣṭapiṇḍapāṇḍuritaghanaghaṇṭāmālabhāriṇā trāpuṣasiṃhamukhama dhyasthitathūlalohakaṇṭakaṃ dattadantadaṇḍārgalaṃ galatpītanīlalohitadar paṇasphuritabudbudamālaṃ kapāṭapaṭṭadvayaṃ dadhānena garbhagṛhadvā radeśena dīpyamānāṃ; ibid.). 

Then follows the image of the Goddess, which in its association with the terrible, and in the predominance of the colour red, matches the concep tion of Kālarātri in the passage from the Mahābhārata: “She was installed on an altar of black stone” (adhyāsitāñjanaśilāvedikām, Kādambarī, p. 224). “Her feet were never bereft of cloths [dyed with] red lac thrown upon the mound of her seat [on the altar] as if they were the lives of all creatures arrived there for shelter; she resembled an inhabitant of the Underworld because of

A Draviḍa ascetic, portrayed as a comical figure, is said to be her priest; per haps Bāṇa was conscious in making the priest a Draviḍa, on account of the widespread worship of the goddess Koṛṛavai, later correlated with Durgā, in the South? There are apparently several Tantric rites that Bāṇa pejoratively as sociates with the priest: he, “the ageing Draviḍa religious man” “demeans Durgā with his prayers for the boon of sovereignty over the Southern lands” (dak ṣiṇāpatharājyavaraprārthanākadarthitadurgeṇa … jaraddraviḍadhārmikeṇa; p. 226); “he had copied a hymn to Durgā on a strip of cloth” (paṭṭikālikhitadur gāstotreṇa; ibid), “he had collected palm-leaf manuscripts of spells, Tantras and jugglery the letters of which were written in red lac and fumigated with

smoke” (dhūmaraktālakākṣaratālapattrakuhakatantramantrapustikāsaṃgra hiṇā; ibid); “he had written down the [work known as ] the ‘Doctrine of Mahā kāla’ instructed to him by a withered Mahāpāśupata mendicant” ( jīrṇamahā pāśupatopadeśalikhitamahākālamatena, pp. 226–227); “he was one in whom the disease of talking about [finding] treasure had arisen” (āvirbhūtanidhivā davyādhinā, p. 227); “in him the wind [disease] of alchemy had grown” (saṃ jātadhātuvādavāyunā, ibid.); “he entertained the deluded desire of becoming the lover of a Yakṣa maiden” (pravṛttayakṣakanyakākāmitvamanorathavyāmo hena, ibid.); “his collection of practices for mastering mantras for invisibil ity had grown” (vardhitāntardhānamantrasādhanasaṃgraheṇa, ibid.); “he was acquainted with a hundred tales about the marvels of the Śrīparvata mountain” (śrīparvatāścaryavārttāsahasrābhijñena, ibid.); “his ear-cavities were punched by those possessed by piśāca-demons, who had run to him when struck by white mustard seed he had empowered with mantras more than once” (asakṛd abhimantritasiddhārthakaprahitapradhāvitaiḥ piśācagṛhītakaiḥ karatalatāḍa nacipiṭīkṛtaśravaṇapuṭena ibid.); and “he had used magic powders for snaring women many times on aging mendicant ladies, who having arrived from other lands retired [there to rest]” (anyadeśāgatoṣitāsu jaratpravrajitāsu bahukṛtvaḥ saṃprayuktastrīvaśīkaraṇacūrṇena). 

While it would be imprudent to treat this example of poetic literature as a bald record of fact, it is possible to see Bāṇa’s extensive and richly crafted episode of this horrific, yet magnificent, temple as a reflection of social atti tudes to the Goddess and her worship. There is a mix of suspicion, fear and reverential awe underlying the image of the forbidding shrine tucked away in the wilds, with its Tāntrika priest who knows not how ‘appropriate’ worship should be conducted, and its blood-spattered, grisly interiors. The very opposite of this ambivalent attitude surfaces in Bāṇa’s unequivocally laudatory poem to Durgā, the Caṇḍīśataka—verse 8 of which is consciously alluded here in “she seemed to be scolding the wild buffalo who had offended by moving the trident-shaft by scratching his shoulders [on it]” (skandapīṭhakaṇḍūyanacalita triśūladaṇḍakṛtāparādhaṃ vanamahiṣam iva tarjayantīm; Kādambarī p. 226). The topos of Mahiṣa scratching his back on the post appears in Caṇḍīśataka 8 too,16 in which there is a mischievous pun with the word sthāṇu that means both “post” and “Śiva.” The saviour of Dharma in the Caṇḍīśataka contrasts with the menacing though beauteous figure here. One may suggest that the

wider context for this attitude of ambivalence is a historical transition: the God dess first imagined as we have seen as a kṛtyā in the Mahābhārata was being absorbed within mainstream devotional practices, through which her demonic attributes became ‘toned down,’ balanced by the benevolent and the charming, but nevertheless remained, at the stage of Bāṇa’s compositions, tinged with a degree of the terrible. The comic portrayal of the priest registers the fact that by Bāṇa’s time Durgā’s worship had acquired firm cultural associations with Śaiva tantric rites. There was also an association of her site of worship with wild envi ronments inhospitable to people, to flora and fauna in general (note that most of the ornaments in her shrine are of plants and flowers) and even, it seems, with a peculiarly Southern religious attitude. 

Regarding the Southern Navarātra, it is tempting to conjecture that the roots of worshiping the Goddess in Devagiri and Vijayanagara drew also upon the older cult of Koṛṛavai, the stag-borne goddess described in the old Tamil poem, the Cīlapattikāram.17 In fact many salient elements of Durgā’s rituals in gen eral (especially, though, in the East), such as the transactional nature of wor ship, trance, possession, ecstatic dancing, singing hymns, the important role of women, virgin-worship and heroic self-sacrifice involving blood are to be found even here, which suggest that among all elements of the Navarātra, these appear to be the earliest. In Canto XII Koṛṛavai is said to be worshipped by cattle-raiders for victory in their missions.18 The canto, called “Vēṭṭuvavari” (The Hunter’s Song), portrays the Eyinar community worshipping their pro tective goddess for victory before setting off on a raid. The chapter describes vividly the stages of pūjā at the shrine of Aiyai (Koṛṛavai), eulogized throughout the canto as Durgā, the slayer of Mahiṣa, the sister of Viṣṇu and the consort of Śiva. First, a respected Maravar lady Śālinī, an oracle, becomes possessed and dances, singing a hymn urging the hunters to offer tribute to the Goddess.19 In the hymn Śālinī rebukes the men for growing weak and no longer robbing passers-by,20 the implication being that the Goddess will re-invigorate them with heroic zeal. After the oracle performs, a virgin is selected from the Eyi nars, in what appears to be an early form of the kumārīpūjā, and treated with especial care as the Goddess. Dressed in tiger skin, with a snake of silver and a wild hog’s tooth in her matted hair, a necklace of tiger-tooth, a bow of wood and

seated on a stag, the kumārī is brought before the shrine of the Goddess, set in lush and verdant groves of fragrant and flowering trees.21 The women offer her various gifts of dolls, beautiful birds, paints, scents, food and flowers with much fanfare and the beating of drums.22 After worshipping the Goddess, the virgin goes into a trance, and speaks to the heroine of the poem Kaṇṇakī, introducing her to Koṛṛavai, who from this moment in the ritual, it is suggested, becomes a living presence.23 

Koṛṛavai appears. She bore a moon on her hair, a third eye on her forehead; her lips were red, her throat blue with poison like that of her consort Śiva. The snake Vāsukī was her girdle and she wore a bodice resembling snake-teeth, an elephant’s hide over her upper body and a tiger skin over her hips; she carried a trident. There are rich ornaments on her feet. Dark in hue as a sapphire,24 bejewelled, youthful, beautiful, ascendant on the head of the buffalo demon, she is called, among many names, the sister of Kṛṣṇa, Durgā, Gaurī, the giver of victory, worshipped by Viṣṇu and Brahmā,25 and also the defeater of Kaṃsa.26 The names and descriptions indicate that even at this early period, circa 450CE, when the poem is thought to have been composed,27 the Goddess, whose ini tial sectarian affiliation was with Kṛṣṇa, had already become associated with Śiva, and moreover had acquired an independent identity as a supreme divin ity, worshipped by all the gods. Another hymn is sung by a girl to the virgin dressed as the Goddess, in which the duality of Koṛṛavai-Durgā is emphasised in a series of rhetorical questions or paradoxical contrasts: she is worshipped by gods and is an exalted repository of Vedic knowledge, yet also stands on a buffalo head adorned with wild animal hides; standing as light above the trinity of Viṣṇu, Śiva and Brahmā, she stands also on a humble stag with twisted black horns, holding aloft, with hands adorned with delicate bangles, a cruel sword; she who is consort of Śiva with three eyes also has a fierce red-eyed lion and the Vaiṣṇava conch and the discus.28 She is also said to have danced the marakkāl,

a dance on wooden legs, to defeat demons. If anyone invokes her wearing a victory garland (veṭci) before setting forth to seize cattle, omens of defeat will appear in the enemy’s village, and the Goddess will accompany the hero on his quest before his bow.29 In the song, the plenitude of captured cattle is then praised, and the Goddess is asked to accept the raiders’ blood offered by cut ting their necks to her in thanks.30 This offering of flesh and blood is described as the Goddess’s price for the victory conferred on the warrior and outlines the transactional nature of the worship.31 The hymn becomes hypnotic at this cli mactic moment of blood-offering as in verse after verse the Goddess is asked to accept the blood. 

Four things illuminated by the description are worth pointing out. Koṛṛavai is already treated as an eclectic deity merged with Durgā, herself a cluster of Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva elements. From the context here it is tempting to specu late that Durgā as a deity of royal power and kingship may trace her roots from local warrior communities such as the Eyinār, who sustained themselves by periodic looting necessitating armed confrontation. In fact, the evidence of the old Tamil text prompts us to refine the schematic diagram, and suggest that the first phase of the ritual going back to the early centuries of the common era was widely practised in the South and, along with blood sacrifice, included ecstatic singing, dancing and deity-possession. When this archaic phase of worship is described in literature, Durgā has already ceased to be a peripheral deity, as I had assumed she still was at this time when I wrote my book, and is considered both the consort of Śiva and Kṛṣṇa’s sister, and empress of the gods. 

A historical survey of the Navarātra’s developmental pattern reveals that it acquired its characteristic shape from a confluence of two different tradi tions: first, a festival of the goddess Nidrā-Kālarātri on the ninth tithi of the dark half of a monsoon month, centred on sanguinary rites exhibiting heroism, and second, a military tradition celebrated in autumn centred on lustrating weapons and armies with fire to ward away ill omens. In this way, through a gradual process of coalescence and subsequent transformation, the Navarā tra acquired two of its hallmarks: the central place of the Goddess as the deity to whom all the rituals were dedicated, and the autumnal season as its most favourable and appropriate time. The phases by which this confluence occurred and then further developed show us how a relatively small single day civic festival, performed by Vaiṣṇavas as part of the celebrations of Janmā

ṣṭamī, gradually expanded into a much longer rite thought to safeguard soci ety and the political class, which then came to be performed in the month of Āśvina. This development paralleled the attenuation of the rite’s importance for the Vaiṣṇavas and its absorption, first by Śaivas, who would promote the worship of the Goddess on Navamī by fasting, in literature about rites for lay devotees,32 and then by the more widespread Purāṇic-Brahmanical tradition. These sectarian absorptions provided impetus to the popularity of the rite among rulers of upcoming kingdoms eager to cultivate the ritual apparatus of goddess-sanctified kingship. 

We can map out two broad regional traditions to have matured later in courts: an Eastern and a Deccan one. By and large these formed the basic blueprint for localized variations. As descriptions of Rajput rites of the śamī tree and the weapon-shooting on Daśamī from colonial ethnographic reports from the nineteenth century show, many of the Rajasthani royal rituals were extremely similar to the template of the Southern Navarātra.33 The most splen did Navarātras seem to have flowered in the ornately ritualized Tantricized environments of Eastern India, among which the kingdom of Mithilā provides us with the most detailed testimonia. These appear to have percolated (in as much as this is reflected through citations) into traditions as far afield as the Deccan. In Mithilā the ten-day structure seems to have matured, and the ferocious identity of the Goddess took a central place in the Tantric rites of Mahāṣṭamī and Mahānavamī. This North-Eastern tradition developed into the Eastern or Gauḍīya tradition—a trend evidenced by a fifteenth-century Ben gali work, the Durgāpūjātattva by Raghunandana, which incorporates rituals of a Bengali character, such as summoning goddesses and worshipping them in nine leaves from crops. A separate, even more markedly Tantric tradition, with elements borrowed from the Kubjikā cult, developed later in the Navarā tra or Dasain of Nepal, but for the time being this will remain excluded from the discussion. In the South, rituals of a Tantric character were largely eschewed. The Navarātra was choreographed around the public display of the king, his court, his weapons and war-animals and magnificent parades, while the wor ship of the Goddess, and indeed the summoning of the Goddess into the king, occurred privately. During these days the king would worship nine virgins con sidered vessels of nine forms of the Goddess (different from the Navadurgās of Mithilā and Nepal) for powers such as mastery over enemies, knowledge, riches 

32 The rituals of Navamī appear in the Śivadharma, and in a parallel in an early Śaiva scrip ture, the Niḥśvāsamukhatattva; these are treated in greater detail in Sarkar 2017, 72–76. 33 Report of Alexander Forbes, in Kinsley 1988, 106–107.

and an abundance of slaves and slave-girls, as described in ritual instructions in Sanskrit. The most resplendent examples of this version of the rite took place, it seems, in the Vijayanagara empire. 

In this way what we find are many rituals of a large-scale, communal, pub lic character clustering and growing according to differing political environ ments (as the Navarātra was chiefly promoted by the court) around the figure of Durgā. This process allowed a more sophisticated ritual interaction to develop between political agents (chiefly the ruler, then the army and the polis) and the Goddess (and her forms), who in the course of the Navarātra’s transformations cements her role as the deity who grants the goals of kingship (military victory; territorial protection) and protects communal areas such as fortresses, citadels and palaces. However, in spite of its proliferation one element remained the cornerstone of the rite: blood sacrifice. A key aspect of the nature of the ritual as a pact between the Goddess and solicitor of rewards, this remained constant throughout the development of the Navarātra and indeed even today is seen to be critical to its success. It is possible that before its appearance in Vaiṣṇava sources, the worship of Nidrā-Kālarātri in the monsoon was a widespread pop ular festival of heroism based on blood-sacrifice, including ecstatic communal bacchanalia, that could have formed part of a marauder’s cult, as in the worship of the stag-riding goddess Koṛṛavai. It was gradually absorbed into the influ ential sectarian traditions when goddess-cults came to be elevated during the Gupta period, as inscriptions from Valkhā, Madhya Pradesh, in the late Gupta period attest.34 

Recently, the historian Kunal Chakrabarti (2001) has suggested that the ori gins of the Navarātra lie in indigenous practice, and that its late emergence in Sanskritic literature is the culmination of a long process whereby the Goddess was gradually brought into the Sanskritic sphere. The Goddess, Chakrabarti argues, is a strategic means whereby peripheral and popular deities and tra ditions can be absorbed into the mainstream. Her festival was the time of the year when these popular traditions could be made public and shown to cohere around her. 

Indeed this was the case, and such is also made evident in the description in the Cīlapattikāram. The festival of the Goddess, unlike its Vedic autumnal ancestor, integrated rites of different affiliations. Apart from the Tantric, other rites, performed by indigenous groups, would regularly be incorporated into the ritual sequence. In the Cīlapattikāram we are shown that, while the main

community profiting from the worship are the Eyinār hunters, a representative of another group, the Maravars, plays a critical ritual role as the oracle. Cer tain social groups, for example, were authorized to carry through the animal sacrifice. In this sense the Navarātra united disparities within the social can vas in which it was embedded. The obligatory performance of rites that would involve everyone regardless of their caste represents a social inversion that the Navarātra set into motion during the classical period. It was at this time that the strict hierarchies enforced by the orthodox social order were overturned, albeit for a limited period, as the single day Śābarotsava attests. This leads us to question the long-held assumption that the Navarātra is a Purāṇic festival. Indeed, although in outward character it was, since it was taught in texts that were Purāṇic, and since it was further elaborated on by Sanskrit writers work ing to strengthen the Brahmanic order, it nevertheless was elusive in essence. I would argue that this lack of affiliation was one of the chief reasons why it grew into the most important ritual of political and communal affirmation. That it was one of the few rituals of elevated, that is to say Sanskritic status, that solid ified the status and place of outcaste groups, and publicly displayed subversive rites that would otherwise have been deemed suspicious by brāhmaṇas, such as the caste-dissolving, orgiastic śābarotsava (The Festival of Śabara-tribes) on Daśamī taught in the Kālikāpurāṇa and Dharmaśāstric literature, served to identify it as a ritualized act of cohesion.35 The Goddess herself was a metaphor of this cohesion, worshipped by both outcastes and people within the caste hierarchy. Indeed, literature, particularly classical kāvya, shows that her role as an outcaste deity preceded that of the Goddess of special importance to a kṣatriya. The importance for kṣatriyas is emphasized in the Devīmāhātmya, from perhaps the late-eighth century CE. Though images of the Goddess in the presence of warriors offering their blood to her appear from as early as the seventh century, it is in this work that we are first presented with what became a canonized narrative of the Goddess blessing a kṣatriya king and a vaiśya merchant, thereby being firmly associated with the power-model of the caste system. On the other hand, that the Goddess’s worship was meant for all varṇas and also heretics (pāṣaṇḍas), Tantric physicians (gāruḍikas) and Buddhists, is still registered by the slightly later Devīpurāṇa, in which an ecu menical devotee-base, including even women, is envisaged in such verses as 

35 Spring rites to Kāma were other orgiastic public celebrations of this kind discussed in brahminical prescriptive literature, but unlike the Navarātra, which survived, they con tinued in adapted form within Śaiva rituals as the festival of the damana plant (damanot sava): see Goodall forthcoming for this argument.

After the four teenth century, and the rise of the Rajput lineages in Rajasthan, she became, nonetheless, even more strictly connected with a specifically kṣatriya-ethos despite being, in practice, a non-sectarian deity in the earlier classical period.40 

One manner in which the Navarātra negotiated the boundary between dif ferent religious affiliations is through allowing optionality: nearly all manuals

Quoted from unpublished draft critical edition prepared by S. Hatley. This passage con cerns worship of the Seven Mothers, who are included in the worship of Durgā, even during the Navarātra, as her attendants. A translation, citing the working draft of Hat ley ( forthcoming), is as follows: “People desiring liberation worship the Mothers by way of the Vedas and the Śaiva Tantric revelation. They are also worshipped in accordance with the Gāruḍatantras, Bhūtatantras, and Bālatantras. Beneficent, they bring all endeavors to fruition, and are like wish-fulfilling jewels. Heretics of the future—[viz.] the Buddhist pro ponents of Gāruḍa Tantra—will worship them according to their own methods, devoted to their own ways, dear child. They give rewards that accord with any disposition wise people worship them with, whether they be Brahmins or even lowborn outcastes.” I am grateful to Dr. Hatley for sharing his draft translation and edition with me and indicating the need to include mention of the Devīpurāṇa.

One of the arguments therein is that prior to the Devīmāhātmya, the worship of the goddess seems to have been non-sectarian and open to all rulers regardless of their caste. It is from the fourteenth century that we find restrictions concerning who could worship the goddess and in what way in Dharmaśāstric literature such as the Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi, also treated in my book.

include options allowing the substitution of animals with vegetables, and if one was averse to cutting a human head, about which the Eastern manuals are quite direct, one could just as well manage with a pumpkin. The template was fluid and could be adapted to differing tastes and needs. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, I wish to take a step back and reflect on the ritual as a polit ical moment—which is what the Navarātra encapsulates in all its regional forms. The political ritual concentrates divine power in the king and simulta neously disperses it within the body politic, thereby integrating all its aspects within one divine body. Cycles of nature were renewed thereby, but so also were political cycles, such as the military year. Forces of nature and the divine that were held to be whimsical were placated, and crises—ill omens, disasters, and calamities—that could potentially damage entire kingdoms were averted. All this was effected within the controlled environment of the ceremony. The charismatic heart of this ceremony was the Goddess herself: elusive because she integrated the essences of other goddesses, and yet powerfully coherent. Her coherence came from a representation of death, and the ceremony became an enactment of her triumph over death. The buffalo, a vāhana of Yama, was a symbol of death. Durgā’s slaying the buffalo symbolized both her mastery over and her association with death and danger. In this respect, the character of the Goddess that came alive during the Navarātra was that of a capricious and fierce deity. If we study the most archaic layer of the buffalo-sacrifice, and the words used in the hymns accompanying the offering of the animal’s blood, we find an old conception of the Goddess to emerge. She is thought to stand at the centre of an essentially cruel natural universe that could only be coaxed into a truce through placatory worship, and through the establishment of a pact between man and deity. That pact, if regularly and respectfully maintained dur ing the Navarātra, generated the goodwill of divine power.

The goddess Śārikā belongs to a group of Kashmirian lineage deities (kuladevī or vaṃśadevī) who, like Bālā, Rājñī, and Jvālā, are identified with particular locations.1 Śārikā resides on the Pradyumna peak in Śrīnagar, also known as the “Śārikā peak,” and is worshipped there in the form of a large stone around which a temple has been constructed.If one wishes to identify the cult practiced there and locate it within the religious landscape of the valley, a visitor might start with the modern inscription shown in figure 14.1, which reads as follows: 

bindutrikoṇavasukoṇadaśārayugma 

manvaśranāgadalasaṃyutaṣoḍaśāram | 

vṛttatrayaṃ ca dharaṇīsadanatrayaṃ ca 

śrīcakrarājam uditaṃ paradevatāyāḥ || 

This verse describes the śrīcakra, the yantra of the “supreme deity” (parade vatā) commonly known as Tripurā, by merely listing in the first three pādas the geometrical elements of the yantra, for instance bindu (“dot”) and trikoṇa (“tri angle”). It is quoted often, with variations,2 and attributed to several scriptural sources in Tantric literature. 

What we are to understand here, one must suppose, is that in modern times Śārikā was understood or presented as a form of Tripurā, or as belonging to her cultic context. 

Unfortunately fieldwork of this kind does not disclose the history of the cult. We know that the first scriptures of the cult of Tripurā were written not before the eleventh century;3 needless to say, they make no mention of Śārikā. On the other hand, the local Kashmirian cult of Śārikā is at least as old as the Kathā saritsāgara (second half of the twelfth century),4 and it is rather doubtful that the two goddesses’ association is this old. 

1 See Sanderson 2009, 111. 

2 For instance, Lakṣmīdhara in his commentary on the Saundaryalaharī reads the third pāda as vṛttatribhūpurayutaṃ paritaś caturdvāḥ and in the fourth śrīcakram etad […]. 3 Sanderson 2015, 32. 

4 See 12.6.111: yena pradyumnaśikharaṃ śārikākūṭam ity api […], and 12.6.116: tatra snātvā vita stāyām arcayitvā vināyakam saṃpūjya śārikāṃ devīṃ digbandhādipuraḥsaram.

For finding out more about the cult of Śārikā, including her ritual and pos sibly doctrinal details, we have a single published source, the Devīrahasya,5 which contains passages on the cult of the Kashmirian lineage deities. In par ticular, the ritual texts appended to the edition of the Devīrahasya give the mantroddhāra, sahasranāma and other typical elements of the worship of these deities.In this text Śārikā is clearly identified as having the form of a stone (śilārūpā)6 on the Pradyumna hill. Her worship is said to remove the impurity (mala) stemming from such capital offences as the murder of a Brahmin or drinking alcohol, or eating what is forbidden.7 The details of the mantra are given, as are the Ṛṣi, etc., a dhyānaśloka, her yantra, and how to employ the mantra for the magic acts of immobilizing (stambhana) and so forth.8 This is followed by a Śārikāpūjāpaddhati (pp. 412–419).

Further sources are difficult to trace or remain unpublished. First is a so called Śārikāstrotra attributed to the Pradyumnāvatāra. This text is “a mālā mantra in prose with a dhyānaśloka in the beginning and two verses at the end.”9 Apart from its manuscript in the Bodleian, there are two more in the Lindenmuseum (Stuttgart),10 and one in Śrīnagar.11 Judging from the excerpts given in the Verzeichnis der orientalischen Handschriften in Deutschland (VOHD) catalogue, there are variations such as insertions of new names and additional phrases that cannot be reduced easily to a single critical text.12 In any case, for our purposes a transcript of the Śrīnagar manuscript (S) is suffi cient:

The Agnikāryapaddhati also transmits this verse.

From this stotra we can gather something about the iconography of the deity, for instance the attributes held in her eighteen arms,20 her names, the seven goddesses (amā etc.) that form her retinue and their symbolism. 

The main information on a deity for ritual purposes is of course her mantra. Here one unpublished source21 gives the mantra in a Vedic style by stating its Ṛṣi, metre, and deity, but augmented with the tantric elements bīja, śakti and kīlaka,22 and there is of course also a tantric Gāyatrī devoted to Śārikā.23 

So it seems the cult of Śārikā is fairly old, but it has been influenced by the cult of Tripurā or Śrīvidyā. One such influence must have been the Kashmirian Kauls, a clan that migrated to Kashmir not before the fifteenth century24 and brought their own cults with them, which were then fused with the local Kash mirian cults.25 The most important figure in this group, Sāhib Kaul, is credited with three ritual handbooks andfurthermorefused Advaita Vedāntic ideaswith the Kashmirian Pratyabhijñā.26 Sāhib Kaul has also composed a further text on the deity, a Śārikāstotra27 in eighteen verses which, as he says, gives the deriva tion of her Mantra.28

With true devotion I worship that divine and omnipresent Śārikā, who bears the crescent moon on her head, who grants liberation, destroys delusion everywhere, destroys the bad fear of meeting a wrong death. 

Since we have to suppose a Kashmirian pronounciation, which does not prop erly distinguish aspirated from non-aspirated stops, all four lines are real ized as an end rhyme. In this verse the goddess is adored as granting liber ation, removing29 confusion etc. One iconographical detail known from the other sources, that she bears the crescent moon on her head, is alluded to as well. 

After the introductory stanza the main topic of the stotra, the mantroddhāra explicitly mentioned in v. 17, commences: 

tāraṃ bījaṃ yo japed amba bhaktyā

O mother Śārikā, whoever devotedly recites your tāra-syllable, which car ries one across (tāraka) the ocean of transmigration, may, when his wis dom is ripened through the knowledge of the absolute, even put to shame the Lord of the Word (bṛhaspati). 

“Your bīja” means the (first) syllable of the mantra of Śārikā. Sāhib Kaul uses code words for the syllables that make up the mantra, a common practice 

29 In verse 1a the root dāṇ dāne(Dhātupāṭha 1.977) is used, while in 1b and 1c the root is dāp lavane(Dhātupāṭha 2.50).

which enables a writer to—as it were—speak of a mantra without actually pro nouncing it. Thus, to those uninitiated and ignorant of the codes, the true form of the mantra must have, at least in theory, remained unknown. 

tāra is a common code word for the syllable oṃ and poses no problems. The codes that follow are partly difficult to interpret and will be discussed below.

He who remembers your next syllable, which is īśa with abja, vahni, and padma, is remembered by goddesses in heaven, Nāga maidens in the netherworld, and women on earth confused by the arrows of Kāma.

One of pure mind who recites with complete devotion the lakṣmī-syllable, which is difficult for bad people to obtain, him the goddess of good for tune will always be eager to see, and although unsteady (by nature) she will remain at his doorstep out of devotion.

He who remembers your next syllable, which is īśa together with vak travṛtta and vahni, will have at his disposal “enjoyment”30 (bhukti), lib eration, the method of real vicāra,31 and devotion.

He who recites your syllable with pure heart and proper devotion, O Śārikā, which consists of abja and vaktravṛtta, in his mouth a fully devel oped32 voice stays, which has the beauty of unfolding through various good emotions.

8c bhuktvā] L1 O3; bhuktā B1 

He who recites your syllable, consisting of abja and vaktravṛtta, and called asthyātmā, O Śārikā, is liberated in life and, enjoying supreme bhogas,33 will later dissolve in your state, O Bhavānī. 

30 In context, this may mean the enjoyment of powers (siddhi). 

31 I understand the term in the sense of ātmavicāra as used in the Mokṣopāya (5.5.27), a text which Sāhib Kaul occasionally refers to. 

32 prauḍham is of course an adverb, but to translate “stays ripely” would not really capture the intended sense. 

33 This could again denote the siddhis, but in a less technical register the enjoyment of the pleasures of liberation.

Having attained the strength of true intelligence through Jñānasvāmin, I know what there is to know and everywhere contemplate my own self. I, Sāhib Kaula, have composed this hymn to the lineage deity Śārikā, which contains the construction of her Mantra. 

Sāhib Kaul’s Śārikāstava deals with some aspects of the worship of this deity; most importantly, as the author states in verse 17, it gives the mantroddhāra of the Śārikāmantra. The author’s teacher Jñānasvāmin, according to Madhusu dan Kaul,34 was his maternal uncle.

śārikā’s mantra 359 

This final stanza explains the idea behind this work. A person who is not ini tiated into the recitation of the mantra of Śārikā and may not even know how to decode the mantroddhāra can still benefit from this type of substitute recita tion. In this the work is similar in approach to the Sūryastutirahasya of Sāhib Kaul’s contemporary Ratnakaṇṭha, where the Vedic Gāyatrī-mantra is hidden within a hymn addressed to the sun as an acrostichon.35 

The aim in both cases is apparently to enable persons who lack proper adhikāra—for Vedic mantras, in the case of Ratnakaṇṭha, or Tantric mantras, in the case of Sāhib Kaul—to gain at least some kind of access to these restricted parts of the religion. This technique of “hiding” the actual form of the mantras in a stotra meant for religious recitation is not so much a way to conceal it from the outsider, but a method to enable him or her to use it without breaking reli gious rules, in other words a method to bypass religious and social restrictions. Theologically the matter is of course complicated, because Ratnakaṇṭha’s sto tra actually contains the sounds that make up the Gāyatrī, so in a sense by reciting the stotra one does recite the Gāyatrī. In the case of the Śārikāstava, since only code names are given, one does not utter the sounds that make up the mantra of Śārikā. 

Despite the fact that the stotra contains the mantroddhāra, it is quite diffi cult to decipher the mantra from Sāhib Kaul’s stotra alone, for the system of codes is not otherwise known. The most obvious place to search for a solution would be the mantroddhāra in the Devīrahasya, for this text deals in detail with the Kashmirian lineage goddesses, and according to Aithal,36 the Śrīvidyānitya pūjāpaddhati of Sāhib Kaul as available in the ms. Chandra Shum Shere c. 264 is roughly identical with the ritual manuals printed in the appendix to the Devī rahasya.37 This is the relevant verse:38 

tāraṃ parā-mā-taṭa-sindhurārṇāḥ 

khaṃ śarma tanmadhyagataṃ ca nāma | 

ante ’śmarī pārvati śārikāyās

The code words—parā for hrīṃ, aśmarī for namaḥ etc.—are explained in the edition of the Devīrahasya.39 Furthermore, in its second chapter the mantras are given also in plain language (spaṣṭam), as is the mantra of Śārikā: oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ hūṃ phrāṃ āṃ śāṃ śārikāyai namaḥ.40 We might thus conclude that all is well, and that since the wording of the mantra itself is not (and, the ologically speaking, should not) be in doubt, we have a good chance to under stand Sāhib Kaul’s mantroddhāra. Since these sets of codes cannot easily be corrupted in the course of transmission, no banal error should have crept in.41 

However, if we look at the definitions in Sāhib Kaul’s Śārikāstava, we find that not all can be brought into accord with this form of the mantra. Table 14.1 shows the expected bījas and their definitions in the verses. We may leave out verses 2, 4 and 9, because they do not use complicated codes: tāra usually means “oṃ,” lakṣmī stands for “śrī,” and the conclusion of the mantra (dative of the deity and namaḥ) is as expected. 

The problem arises when we try to decode the remainder as follows: (1) the element present in all definitions is abja and there is only one sound common to all five bījas, that is, ṃ. Apart from that nos. 6–8 have only one element in common, so vaktravṛtta standsfor ā. Taking now elements that occur only once, it follows that in 8 asthy- must signify ś, vāmakarṇa- in 5 means ū, and vahni

41 There is, of course, the counter-evidence of one manuscript of a Śārikāstavarāja (VOHD 2.2.116), which gives the mantra with the misspelling or wrong transcription of hrūṃ for hūṃ. 
 

śārikā’s mantra 361 

as expected stands for r. Now only īśa remains, which stands for h in 3 and 5, but—in view of our mantra—should stand for ph in 6. 

Let us now look at another source. The mantra is also given in the Dakṣiṇa mūrtyuddhārakośa, where we find the following definition:42 

tāraṃ māyāṃ śriyaṃ kūrcaṃ sindhuraṃ śūnyam eva ca | 

kalyāṇaṃ śārikādevyā bījaṁ saptākṣaraṃ smṛtam || 

According to the index of code words in the appendix and the “prakāśam” ver sion (ibid., 16) this translates into the seven bījas “oṃ hrīṃ śrīṃ hūṃ hrāṃ āṃ śāṃ.” The manuscripts reported have three other options for hrāṃ, one being phrāṃ, our reading from the Devīrahasya. 

Now, in the index of the edition of the Dakṣiṇamūrtyuddhārakośa the code word sindhura is given as hrāṃ,while according to the bījākṣarapāribhāṣikasūcī contained in the Devīrahasya (p. 21) it means phrāṃ.In other words we find two versions of the mantra in the available sources, unless the editors have misread their manuscripts. What we can say is that the evidence from Sāhib Kaul con firms the version of the Dakṣiṇamūrtyuddhārakośa.

### 15 The Kāmasiddhistuti of King Vatsarāja 

Diwakar Acharya 

This essay concerns a pūjāstuti1 that guides its reciter through the mental or actual worship of the goddess Nityā. The text is composed in the first person but the author does not name himself in the text. The text is named Vāmakeśvarī stuti and attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravartin Vatsarāja in the colophon of the sole palm-leaf manuscript of the text available to me. How ever, the last verse of the text calls it Kāmeśvarīstuti and describes it using two adjectives, kāmasiddhi and atimaṅgalakāmadhenu. It is not unnatural, I think, to name this stuti using its first adjective.2 

The manuscript containing this stuti text is preserved in the National Ar chives, Kathmandu. It bears accession number 1–1077 and can be found micro filmed under NGMPP reel number A 39/15. The same manuscript also contains a paddhati text called Aśeṣakulavallarī that dwells on the worship of the god dess Tripurā, but this text remains incomplete as the folios following the six teenth are absent. Our text begins on the verso of the first folio and ends in the third line of the recto of the fourth, with a colophon and a decorative sym bol. The other text immediately follows in the same hand with a salutation to the goddess Tripurā. The manuscript is written in a variety of North Indian script close to Newari with frequent use of pṛṣṭhamātrās. It is possible that this manuscript was copied by an immigrant or pilgrim in Kathmandu valley. It measures 33×4.5cm and has a binding hole to the left of the centre. It bears foliation in numerals in the left margin and in numbers in the right margin of verso folios. The text in the manuscript is dotted with scribal errors, but no secunda manus corrections are seen. On palaeographical grounds I place the manuscript in the late fourteenth century. 

This manuscript contains 46 verses of the stuti and one more verse (num bered here as 38a) can be retrieved from a citation.3 A little less than the half of the stuti covering the first 21 verses is in Anuṣṭubh metre and the rest in 

1 A number of pūjāstutis of the Tripurā traditon can be found in the appendix section of Dwivedi 1985. Aghoraśiva’s Pañcāvaraṇastava, published from Pondicherry (see Goodall et al. 2005), is a good example of a Siddhānta Śaiva pūjāstuti.

Vasantatilakā. Verses 31 and 32 form a yugalaka as the finite verb comes only in the second verse. The author plays now and again with syllabic rhyming (anuprāsa), and his language is beautiful, though sometimes elliptical. 

The stuti opens with a pair of verses invoking Paramaśiva and Nityā Śakti. These verses already tell us of the poet’s understanding of the nature of Nityā and inseparability of Paramaśiva and Śakti, a point highlighted in the second half of the text, particularly verses 31–32 and 42. In verse 3 the poet states that he approaches the temple of Mṛḍānī from the west gate (paścimadvāra).4 The next two verses invoke Gaṇeśa and Kṣetreśa. The latter, who has the form of Bhairava, can be identified as Baṭuka. Gaṇeśa and Baṭuka together are iden tified as the goddess’s sons in Śākta systems and serve as her doorkeepers.5 To our surprise, verse 6 invokes the Vaiṣṇava doorkeepers Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi, who bear the Vaiṣṇava emblems of the conch and lotus on their heads.6 Verses 7–9 invoke respectively three goddesses: Padmā, a Vaiṣṇava ver sion of Durgā carrying a conch and discus, and Bhāratī. Verses 10 and 11 invoke Manobhava, namely, the Indian love-god Kāmadeva, and describe him as the 

4 This should be the intended meaning, because one is supposed to enter a temple from the western or southern gate facing east or north. Therefore, many of the early Śaiva-Śākta tem ples, even though they face east, have an older western or southern entry. For more discus sions, see Goodall et al. 2005, 103–107 and Goodall et al. 2015, 366 (Niśvāsa, Uttarasūtra 3:8 and annotation thereon). Another possible interpretation of paścimadvāra is “the last door to resort to.” Perhaps, the poet is punning. 

5 For Gaṇeśa and Baṭuka as the Goddess’ sons, See, e.g., Jayaratha on Tantrāloka 1.6b. 6 Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi have strong associations with the cult of Yakṣas. In the Megha dūta, Kālidāsa’s Yakṣa tells the cloud-messenger that the marks of conch (śaṃkha) and lotus (padma) are painted on the sides of the gate of his house in the city of Alakā, as he pro vides a number of clues for the identification of his house. In the form of emblems as well as human forms, Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi are depicted in the Ajaṇṭā caves and are asso ciated with Yakṣa deities (cf. Bautze-Picron 2002, 225–231). Besides, the Buddhist Vasudhārā Dhāraṇī enjoins worship Śaṅkhanidhāna and Padmanidhāna with the goddess Vasudhārā encircled by a group of eight unspecified Yakṣiṇīs. Some other texts name Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi as male consorts of Vasudhārā and Vasumatī, respectively. Anyway, these two are adopted by the Vaiṣṇavas as doorkeepers or attendants of Viṣṇu along with the other pairs of Jaya and Vijaya, Caṇḍa and Pracaṇḍa, Nanda and Sunanda. They also feature in some compar atively late Tantric texts of other traditions, particularly those from the south. They are listed also among the twelve Vaiṣṇava nidhis found in some Puranic and Vaiṣṇava texts. Professor Dominic Goodall kindly informs me (personal communication of November 20, 2019) that what is now called the Kailāsanātha temple in Kancheepuram seems to have Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi framing the doorway. According to him, that temple now has an eastern entrance to the enclosure, but there is an older western entry, now blocked up. 

For an example of images of Śaṃkhanidhi and Padmanidhi from Anurādhapur, Sri Lanka, See Paranavitana 1955.

beloved husband of Rati and Prīti.7 Here we are told that the love-god forms the circular base of the Śrīcakra, the maṇḍala of the goddess Nityā Sundarī. With these verses the text enters the process of installation of various deities in the Śrīcakra. It does not specify where these deities are installed, but from the order of verses we know that we are starting from the periphery and mov ing towards the centre. Verses 12–14 respectively praise eightsiddhis, beginning with Aṇimā (in personified forms), eight mother-goddesses, and the deities of ten gestures of the goddess.8 Verses 15 and 16 venerate sixteen goddesses of attraction (ākarṣaṇa) and eight powers of the bodiless love-god (anaṅgaśakti), respectively, all in personified forms.9 We know from the Vāmakeśvaratantra and other Tripurā texts that these are installed on the petals of the sixteen- and eight-petalled lotuses. The next four verses, 17–20, respectively praise the set of fourteen goddesses/powers (śaktis) headed by Sarvasaṃkṣobhaṇī,10 ten Kula 

7 For Rati and Prīti as Kāmadeva’s wives, see, e.g. Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa III.44.33. A Śuṅga period teracotta plaque of Kāmadeva with Rati and Prīti is also preserved in the Mathura Musuem (accession no. 34–2552). 

8 It is possible that these three sets of deities are installed on the three lines forming the out ermost retinue of the rectangular boundary. The Vāmakeśvaratantra, also known as Nityā ṣoḍaśikārṇava, enjoins installing the eight mother-goddesses as well as the eight siddhis in the four directions and four sub-directions, and does not instruct one to worship the goddesses of the gestures. Bhāskararāya (p. 99), however, mentions that according to some other system the outermost boundary is made of three lines and these three sets of god desses are installed there. According to its commentators, the Vāmakeśvaratantra teaches that one should build the boundary with only two lines. Although the Vāmakeśvaratantra does not assign a place for the gestures (mudrā) in the maṇḍala, it does describe them and asks the worshipper to use them during the worship. As found in the third chapter of the Vāmakeśvaratantra, these ten gestures are trikhaṇḍā, kṣobhiṇī, vidrāviṇī, ākarṣiṇī, āveśakarī, unmādinī, mahāṅkuśā, khecarī, bīja, and yoni. 

As listed in many texts, including the Niśvāsaguhya (7.204–205), the eight siddhis are aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, īśitva, vaśitva, prāpti, prākāmya, and yatrakāmāvasāyitā. The Vāmakeśvaratantra (1.153–155) makes them ten by adding two more, bhukti and icchā, and prescribes worshipping them in ten directions. According to the latter (1.156–157), the eight mother-goddesses are Brahmāṇī, Māheśī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā, and Mahālakṣmī. 

9 These are not individually named in this text, but, as listed in the Vāmakeśvaratantra, the first set is made of Kāmākarṣiṇī, Budhyākarṣiṇī, Ahaṃkārākarṣiṇī, Śabdākarṣiṇī, Sparśā karṣiṇī, Rūpākarṣiṇī, Rasākarṣiṇī, Gandhākarṣiṇī, Cittākarṣiṇī, Dhairyākarṣiṇī, Smṛtyā karṣiṇī, Nāmākarṣiṇī, Bījākarṣiṇī, Ātmākarṣiṇī, Amṛtākarṣiṇī, and Śarīrākarṣiṇī (cf. 1.158– 161), and the second set is made of Anaṅgakusumā, Anaṅgamekhalā, Anaṅgamadanā, Madanāturā, Anaṅgarekhā, Anaṅgaveginī, Anaṅgāṅkuśā, and Anaṅgamālinī (cf. 1.163– 164). 

10 We know only the name of the first from this text but the rest can be known from the Vāmakeśvaratantra (1.165–168). They are: Sarvavidrāviṇī, Sarvākarṣiṇī, Sarvāhlādinī, Sarvasaṃmohinī, Sarvastambhanī, Sarvajambhanī, Sarvatovaśinī, Sarvarañjanī, Sarvon 
 

goddesses (kuleśvarī) headed by Sarvasiddhipradā,11 ten goddesses headed by Sarvajñā,12 and eight goddesses of speech, headed by Vaśinī.13 They are sta tioned in the four consecutive retinues of fourteen, ten, another ten, and eight triangles. All deities in a group (see verses 12–20) are visualised in the same way; for example, all mother-goddesses (mātṛ) have the same appearance.14 Verse 21 invokes and asks the deities of four weapons of the goddess for their permission. It is known from other sources that they are placed around the central triangle (cf., e.g., Vāmakeśvaratantra 1.179–180). The next three verses, 22–24, praise Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, and Bhagamālinī, and urge them to fulfill the reciter’s desires. Unlike previous ones, these verses also name the three cor ners of the central triangle as the homes of these goddesses. Verse 25 is in praise of Nityā Sundarī, the goddess in the centre. From here onward, until the second to last verse (45), the poet praises Nityā in various ways. He first invokes the god dess as Nityā (verse 25) and later as Śrīsundarī (verse 30), and describes her as “the felicitous banner of the Love-god.” Verses 25–28 describe the beauty of the goddess, and verses 29–45, with the exception of verse 33 (which describes the Śrīcakra made of 43 triangles as her abode), exalt her in various ways, identi fying her as the ultimate reality of the external as well as internal worlds. She is described as the primordial light (ādyamahas) and paramārthavidyā, which can be interpreted as the highest mantra, the mantra leading to the highest, or the ultimate gnosis. The last verse is a fine eulogy of the stuti itself, describing its reward and thus encouraging people to recite it. 

It has been already pointed out by Sanderson and also Golovkova that the mature cult of Tripurasundarī developed against the backdrop of the nityā cult, evidence for which is available in the Nityākaulatantra and the Siddhakhaṇḍa of the Manthānabhairavatantra. In those texts Tripurasundarī is accompa 

mādinī, Sarvārthasādhanī, Sarvasampattipūraṇī, Sarvamantramayī, and Sarvadvandva kṣayaṃkarī. 

11 Again, the list can be completed with the help of the Vāmakeśvaratantra, but these god desses are here simply called śaktis. The other nine following Sarvasiddhipradā are: Sar vasampatpradā, Sarvapriyaṃkarī, Sarvamaṅgalakāriṇī, Sarvakāmapradā, Sarvaduḥkha vimocinī, Sarvamṛtyupraśamanī, Sarvavighnanivāriṇī, Sarvāṅgasundarī, and Sarvasau bhāgyadāyinī (cf. 1.169–171). 

12 Sarvajñā is followed by Sarvaśakti, Sarvaiśvaryapradāyinī, Sarvajñānamayī, Sarvavyādhi vināśinī, Sarvādhārasvarūpā, Sarvapāpaharā, Sarvānandamayī, Sarvarakṣāsvarūpiṇī, and Sarvepsitaphalapradā (cf. Vāmakeśvaratantra 1.173–175). 

13 The names of these eight can be retrieved from the mantroddhāra section of the Vāma keśvaratantra (cf. 1.77–80). They are Vaśinī, Kāmeśvarī, Modinī, Vimalā, Aruṇā, Jayinī, Sarveśvarī, and Kaulinī. 

14 Neither the Vāmakeśvaratantra nor any of the paddhatis of that tradition give visualisa tions of these deities.

nied by a retinue of eleven and nine nityās, respectively, and worshipped with Kāmadeva.15 Our text identifies Kāmadeva as the husband of Rati and Prīti, places him on the base of the Śrīcakra (cf. verses 10–11), and installs Nityā Sun darī at the altar of worship in the centre of the maṇḍala without a consort, inde pendent and supreme. However, in verses 31–32 she is described as devamahiṣī, although it is said that their body is one and undifferentiated.In verse 2 the poet names the goddess Nityā and invokes her as the Śakti of Paramaśiva possessing all powers and carrying out the five tasks (pañcakṛtya) for him. In verse 34 the poet invokes her as Maheśvarī but states that some royal people in this world call her Lakṣmī and Parā Prakṛti. In verse 40 she is described as Atibhavā, high lighting her transcendent nature, and in verse 42 she is invoked again as Gaurī. It is thus clear that the poet of our text is a Śaiva devotee of goddess Nityā. It is important to note that in the system known to our poet there is only one Nityā, simply called Sundarī, and that the Śrīcakra is also already known. Our poet appears unaware of the sixteen nityās, who are worshipped in the tradi tion of the Vāmakeśvaratantra. It thus appears that the tradition this stuti text represents is different from both the cult of nityās and that of Tripurā. 

The inclusion of Śaṅkhanidhi and Padmanidhi (verse 6), Padmā (verse 7), and the Vaiṣṇava Durgā (verse 8) suggests that the goddess Nityā is somehow linked to the Vaiṣṇava tradition as well. In fact, in verse 34 the poet mentions that some people call her Lakṣmī and Parā Prakṛti, but we are not aware of sur vival of any Vaiṣṇava paddhati of Nityā. 

Now I come to the issue of the poet’s identity. The fact that he is a king and was perhaps somewhat distressed at the time of composition of the stuti can be known from the text itself (cf. verse 40). Furthermore, in the colophon the text is attributed to Mahārājādhirāja Vidyādharacakravarti Vatsarāja.16 Appar ently, the first epithet is royal—he is the king of great kings—while the second is mantric: he is sovereign among the vidyādharas, who are supposed to pos sess esoteric mantric knowledge and due to this have supernatural powers. Vatsarāja is his personal name. The most famous Vatsarāja, the mythical king of Ujjayinī, does not fit the context. Another is King Vatsarāja of the Gurjara Pratihāra dynasty (c. 775–805ce), the father of Mahārājādhirāja Nāgabhaṭa II (805–833ce). Vatsarāja is always called paramamāheśvara, but in the Pra tāpagaḍh Stone Inscription of Mahendrapāla II (dated Year 1003 = 946ce), 

15 cf. Sanderson 2009, 47–49; Golovkova 2012, 816–817. 

16 It is interesting to note that a fifteenth-century inscription from Vijayanagara remembers a king called Vatsarāja blessed by Tripurāmbā. As Sinopoli (2010, 22) cites, “ ‘As Vani blesses king Bhoka, Tripuramba king Vatsaraja, and Kali king Vikramarka, so does Pampa now bless Devaraya’ (trans. Rajasekhara 1992: 27).” 
 

the kāmasiddhistuti of king vatsarāja 369 

Nāgabhaṭa II is called paramabhagavatībhakta.17 It may be a coincidence, but the latter’s mother is named Sundarī. In any case, this Vatsarāja could be our poet.18 Our text represents an archaic tradition that does not even know the name Tripurasundarī, and thus this date in the early-ninth century ce fits it well.

I revere the Nityā Śakti of the Lord, i.e. Paramaśiva. She possesses all pow ers and carries out the five tasks [for him].21 She bestows grace upon all, is eternal, and is the motherly origin of all good. 

17 cf. Sircar 1983, 251. 

18 There is another poet of the same name who flourished in the second half of the twelfth and the first quarter of the thirteenth century ce (cf. Dalal 1918, vi–vii), but he is a minister, not a king. He served the Kālañjara King Paramardideva and wrote some dramatic pieces. Six of such pieces have been published in one volume under the title Rūpakaṣaṭkam (see Dalal 1918). He does not mention Nityā, Sundarī, or Tripurasundarī in his dramas. 

19 The manuscript begins with an invocation, ||oṃ namo gaṇapataye||, preceded by a siddhi sign. I do not think that this invocation is part of the text. 

20 The manuscript reads niḥśāmānanda- and I have emended it to niḥsīmānanda. I have found this compound used at least in one more text, the Adhikaraṇasārāvalī of Vedān tadeśika. 

21 The five tasks of Śiva include punishment (nigraha) and grace (anugraha), besides cre ation, maintenance, and destruction.

You are the stream [of consciousness or immortality] (dhārā),27 O ruler of worlds. Dwelling originally in the abode of Śiva, you multiply yourself sixfold and prepare the path of existence where you nurture wonderful and manifold creation with your own six forms. You shed moonlight on the path of Suṣumṇā that is charming due to the beautiful appearance of the six lotuses serving as [your] bases.

O goddess, though you are one and simple,28 you are [also] nine,29 you are ten, you are again ten, and again you are fourteen. Thus you, the benefac tor of poets, dwell in the sea of Śaktis marked with forty-three triangles. 

27 These two verses depict the goddess as the stream of consciousness or immortality in the human body, known widely as Kuṇḍalinī, originating from the brahmarandhra, the abode of Śiva, flowing through various channels and reaching to the six bases. It is in this light that these verses should be read. 

28 I have conjectured api in place of asi to provide a concessive tone. Perhaps this is not even necessary. In any case, on her own the goddess is singular and unembellished, but the poet appears to imply that all goddesses in different retinues of the Śrīcakra are her projections. 

29 The central triangle and the immediately following retinue of eight triangles are obviously counted together as nine.

However, according to a verse attributed to the Skandapurāṇa and cited in the Bhagavatsandarbha of Jīva Gosvāmin, Śrī is Parā Prakṛti, the consciousness associated with Viṣṇu (śrīḥ parā prakṛtiḥ proktā cetanā viṣṇusaṃśrayā |; Bhagavatsandarbha, p. 278).

poet is telling us about two different identifications: Nityā as Lakṣmī, the consort of Viṣṇu, and Nityā as Parā Prakṛti Vāsudeva, the supreme cause of both sentient and insentient beings. 

31 The underlying digit of the moon (antaścarī śaśikalā) in all likelihood is the sixteen inner most digit beyond the waning and waxing process. 

32 The late Pundit Vraja Vallabha Dwivedi (1985, 45) presents this verse in his preface (origi nally written in 1968) to the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava as cited in the Aruṇāmodinī commentary of the Saundaryalaharī and attributed to the Kāmasiddhistotra of Vatsarāja (cf. Śāstrī 1957, 221), and suggests that it should be located in the Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of the text (the same manuscript I am editing now). However, in 1983 in the Luptāga masaṃgraha, a collection of citations from lost Āgamic texts he prepared, he writes that the verse is not found in the palm-leaf manuscript and so must come from a different text (cf. Dwivedi 1983, 25). I think Dwivedi arrived at this conclusion without reading the implied name of the stuti. The author of the Aruṇāmodinī writes that it is a verse from the Kāmasiddhistotra of Vatsarāja, and the same name is alluded to in the last verse of our text. I conclude that the verse therefore belongs to this text even though it is not found in the palm-leaf manuscript. I assume that it was dropped in the process of transmission. It is thus just possible that there are still a few more verses missing from the latter part of the stuti.

### 16 padmamālā, śaktitantu in Brahmayāmala
The Lotus Garland (padmamālā) and Cord of Power (śaktitantu): The Brahmayāmala’s Integration of Inner and Outer Ritual 

Shaman Hatley 

The significance of the Brahmayāmala to the history of Śaivism was first iden tified by Alexis Sanderson (1988), who was gracious enough to read a section of this voluminous text with me at Oxford, in 2004, at an early stage of my doctoral research. This was a formative professional experience, and I remain touched by his generous hospitality towards me as an unknown visiting student. In the present essay, I revisit a particular thread which emerged from these reading sessions: the śaktitantu or śaktisūtra, the “thread” (tantu) or “cord” (sūtra) of divine power (śakti). This is a technical term of ritual distinctive to the Bra hmayāmala to which Professor Sanderson first drew my attention. Inquiry into the Cord of Power leads me to examine the ways in which the Brahmayāmala (hereafter BraYā) integrates meditational discipline with the somatic perfor mance of ritual, and to query its understanding of the category yoga. 

In chapter 15 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta invokes the authority of the BraYā concerning the inseparability of “external” (bāhya) and “inner” or “internal” (adhyātma) worship. The passage (15.43cd–44) reads as follows in the printed (Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies) edition: 

nādhyātmena vinā bāhyaṃ nādhyātmaṃ bāhyavarjitam ||43|| 

siddhyej jñānakriyābhyāṃ tad dvitīyaṃ saṃprakāśate| 

śrībrahmayāmale deva iti tena nyarūpayat ||44|| 

The fourth verse-quarter (44b) is problematic; following the commentator Jayaratha,1 the passage might be interpreted as meaning, 

“Not without the inner (adhyātma) would the outer succeed, nor the inner devoid of the outer. The second [i.e. the inner] manifests through 

1 Tantrālokaviveka ad 15.43c–44: tad dvitīyam iti adhyātmalakṣaṇam, “ ‘the second one’ means ‘characterized by being inner (adhyātma)’.”

both gnosis and ritual action”—the Lord has explained accordingly in the revered Brahmayāmala. 

Both the sense and syntax appear doubtful, however. On the grounds of coher ence, it seems significantly better in 44b to read tad dvitayaṃ (“that pair [of inner and outer]”) for tad dvitīyaṃ (“the second one”), an emendation sug gested by Harunaga Isaacson.2 In this case the passage might be interpreted as follows: 

“Notwithout the inner (adhyātma)would the outer succeed, nor the inner devoid of the outer. That pair [of inner and outer] manifests through gno sis and ritual action, [respectively]”—the Lord has explained accordingly in the revered Brahmayāmala. 

Thus it seems that Abhinavagupta places the dichotomy of outer (bāhya) and inner (adhyātma) worship in correlation with that of kriyā and jñāna: ritual action and gnosis, respectively. This accords with his remarks prefacing cita tion of the BraYā, which clarify that the performative acts of ritual are valuable only as ancillaries to śivābhimānatā, conviction of one’s identity with Śiva. This inner conviction alone, a form of knowledge, is the real means of liberation.3 

One need not follow Abhinavagupta entirely in reading the BraYā’s dichot omy between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ processes in terms of gnosis and ritual: his source scripture draws no such distinction overtly. Nonetheless, Abhinava gupta’s selection of the Brahmāyamala is by no means contrived, for in invok ing the text thus he highlights a premise central to its systems of practice: the integration of internal and external ritual processes, which mirror each other closely. 

Although many of Abhinavagupta’s citations of the BraYā may be identified precisely,4 in this case the passage he had in mind remains uncertain. BraYā 87.140 is perhaps the strongest candidate:

ādhyātmañ cintayed bāhyaṃ bāhyam adhyātmikāṃ tathā | 

cakre samānabhāvena tato vinyāsam ārabhet ||140|| 

One should meditate upon the internal [wheel/cakra] as external, and the external likewise as internal. Considering [these] to be identical, one should then commence installation [of the mantra-deities] on the cakra. 

The degree of correspondence is merely suggestive, and Abhinavagupta might have had in mind other BraYā passages. His language is actually somewhat closer to a verse from the Tantrasadbhāva, however, another early scripture of the Vidyāpīṭha division of Bhairavatantras. This is highly likely to postdate the BraYā and to reflect a degree of historical development vis-à-vis the latter.5 Tantrasadbhāva 6.218 may read as follows: 

adhyātmaṃ bāhyato dṛṣṭvā bāhyam adhyātmasaṃsthitam | 

yo jānāti sa siddhyeta tadbhāvabhāvabhāvitaḥ6 ||218|| 

After viewing the inner (adhyātma) externally, one who [also] knows the outer to be located internally will attain success, purified by contempla tion of their identity (?).7 

It is conceivable that Abhinavagupta has conflated these two sources, though he may instead have had in mind a verse of the Brahmayāmala not preserved in its oldest manuscript. More probably, he simply paraphrases his source with unusual freedom. 

Regardless of which passage Abhinavagupta had in mind, a point of signifi cant interest emerges from considering this question, namely that the Tantrā loka, Tantrasadbhāva, and Brahmayāmala all appear to mean something differ ent by the distinction between adhyātma,“inner/directed towards the self,” and bāhya, “external.” For the Tantrasadbhāva, the performative acts and parapher nalia of ritual have superior, inner (adhyātma) equivalents: the outer (bāhya) finds its true meaning in the inner processes of yoga. Thus, for instance, in the section of Tantrasadbhāva 6 quoted above in excerpt, the external rosary made

of conch (śaṃkha) has as its inner form the subtle śaṃkhā orśaṃkhiṇī channel (nāḍī) of the yogic anatomy, which extends into the crown of the head.8 The ‘outer’ thus finds true purpose in the ‘inner’ realities of yoga, which supersede the outer entirely. This principle applies to sacred geography as well, for the Tantrasadbhāva transposes into the yogic body a series of cremation grounds closely related to those of the BraYā.9 Access to these inner levels of meaning is a form of knowledge: the inner sacred geography is understood ( jñātavyaṃ) by those who know the self (viditātmanāṃ), while only “one who knows [the identity of inner and outer] attains success” ( yo jānāti sa siddhyeta). Knowl edge ( jñāna) thus transforms ritual into an inner process through which it

On śaṃkhāvartā as a nāḍī, see Amaraughaśāsana 60, which describes it as “having the mea sure of a lotus fibre” (mṛṇālasūtraparimāṇā). The more commonly attested name isśaṃkhiṇī. 9 See especially Tantrasadbhāva 15.62–67: 

prayāgā nābhisaṃsthā tu varuṇā hṛtpradeśata[ḥ] | 

kolagiryāṃ tu kaṇṭhasthaṃ bhīmanādaṃ tu tāluke||65|| 

bindusthāne jayantyāṃ tu nādākhye tu caritrakam |

guruvaktragataṃ proktaṃ koṭivarṣaṃ tathāṣṭamam | 

ete sthānā mayā proktā adhyātme pudgalāśrayāḥ ||67|| 

For those who know the Self, Prayāga should be understood as located in the [cakra of the] navel, Varuṇā [i.e. Vārāṇasī] in the heart region, Kolagiri in the throat, Bhīmanāda in the palate, Jayantī in the place of Bindu, Caritra in [the plexus] called Nāda, and Ekāmraka in [the plexus of] Śakti. The eighth, Koṭivarṣa, is likewise said to be in the Mouth of the Guru. These are the places I have declared to be present in the person internally (adhyātme). 

This list of eight pīṭhas overlaps with the nine śmaśānas or pīṭhas of the BraYā’s principal maṇḍala (as outlined in chapter 3; see Kiss 2015, 24); however, it corresponds more precisely to the eight delineated in BraYā 87 (see Hatley 2018, 134, table 1.16). Cf., also, Tantrasadbhāva 15.70: kulūttamoḍḍiyānaṃ ca eruḍī pulivallabham | tāny eva tu samastāni [em.; saman tāni mss.] svadehe saṃsthitāni tu ||.

ultimately achieves fruition—an orientation consonant with the Kaula turn towards interiority, which may presage aspects of Abhinavagupta’s gnostic nondualism. Yet in contrast to the latter, for the Tantrasadbhāva, the inner is nonetheless conceived of in terms of ‘doing’ (kriyā) rather than ‘knowing’ ( jñāna). The inner and outer, respectively, represent higher and lower arenas of activity, for the mental processes of meditation are also forms of action (kriyā). Chapter 26 of the Tantrasadbhāva colourfully proclaims this principle: 

kriyā tu phaladā10 puṃsāṃ na vijñānaṃ phalapradam11 ||19|| 

yathā strībhakṣyabhogajño na sukhī kriyayā vinā | 

kriyā tu dvividhā jñeyā bāhyā adhyātmikā smṛtā12 ||20|| 

adhyātmā dhyānayogena bāhyā13 pūjāvratādibhiḥ14 | 

Doing (kriyā) is what gives people results; knowledge does not produce results, just as a man knowledgable in the sexual enjoyment of women is not happy without doing it (kriyā). But doing should be understood as twofold: it is held to be outer and inner. Inner action (kriyā) is through yogic meditation, while outer action is through worship, ascetic obser vances, etc. … 

Knowledge is here conceptualized neither in processual nor gnostic terms: jñāna and kriyā represent a dichotomy along the lines of “theory” and “prac tice.” 

The BraYā likewise embraces the twofold division of kriyā into inner and outer—adhyātma and bāhya—which refer in its usage to subjective processes performed mentally and to the somatic performance of ritual, respectively. In contrast to the Tantrasadbhāva, the BraYā draws no overt hierarchy between the two. The inner does not represent a higher meaning or reality; the inner and outer rather represent complemetary arenas for the performance of ritual whose integration is essential. The inner and outer find their fullest integration in the performance of yāga or yajana, “pantheon worship,” the paradigmatic mode of ritual whose limitless possibilities for inflection account for much of the BraYā’s bulk. Yet the principle of their unity applies widely, extending to all

of the various practices encompassed by the terms kriyā and karman, includ ing fire ritual (homa), rites of installation (pratiṣṭhā), initiation (dīkṣā), dura tional observances (vrata), rites using deity images (pratimākarman) or two dimensional diagrams ( yantrakarman), and so forth.15 This integration of inner and outer practice makes a rigid distinction between “ritual” and “meditation” artificial: in the context of the BraYā, ritual—kriyā or karman—encompasses both outer and inner forms of action. These are remarkably parallel in structure and process, and aim at the unification of subjectivity, body, ritual space, para phernalia, and the hierarchy of ontic principles (tattva) which comprise the cosmos (adhvan). In this respect, despite its cultic affinity to later Kaula sys tems, the BraYā’s harmonious integration of the inner and outer seems largely congruent with classical Śaivasiddhānta ritualism. Arguably, such integration of inner and outer processes is characteristic of tantric ritual, broadly con ceived, as reflected in the ubiquitous dichotomy of antaryāga (“inner worship”) and bahiryāga (“external worship”). What is most distinctive to the BraYā is its unique manner of their integration: the“method of the lotus garlands” (padma mālāvidhi). 

1 Method of the Lotus Garlands (padmamālāvidhi) 

Patterning the processes of inner and outer ritual is the BraYā’s pantheon of mantra-deities, whose core comprises the Four Goddesses (devī) or Guhyakās, Four Consorts (dūtīs) or Handmaidens (kiṅkarī), and their lord, Kapālīśa bhairava. Secondary members of the pantheon are a sextet of Yoginīs and an octad of Mother-goddesses (mātṛ). These (see table 16.1) are the mantra-ele ments manipulated in all practice, both inner and outer, and their permuta tions are the principal ritual variables. Collectively, the deities comprise the Nine-Syllable Vidyā (navākṣarā vidyā), mantra of the supreme goddess, Caṇḍā Kāpālinī, as first identified by Sanderson (1988, 672) in his pioneering remarks on the BraYā. In syllabic terms, the vidyā is [oṃ] hūṃ caṇḍe kāpālini svāhā. 

15 Cf. BraYā 90.101: anena vidhinā devi japahomādikarmasu [corr.; karmaṣu ms.] | bāhyā dhyātmeva mantrajñaḥ pūjāṃ [em.; pūjyāṃ ms.] kurvan prasidhyati ||101|| (“Through this procedure, O goddess, in mantra incantation, fire sacrifice, and other rites, the knower of mantras achieves siddhi, practicing both external and internal worship”). In 101c, bāhyā dhyātmeva should be understood in the sense of bāhyādhyātmām eva—nominative for accusative, metri causa.

Virtually all ritual begins with the instruction to enter into a state of med itative concentration, called nirācāra, and to take on a body of śakti, called the avadhūtatanu.16 Śiva is the nirācārapada, “the state beyond regulated con duct,” while the Goddess is avadhūtā, “the stainless/unblemished one.”17 The avadhūta-body, the body of śakti, is a body of mantra (mantravigraha) engen dered by the placement of mantra-syllables in a series of bodily lotuses. The process of taking on the avadhūta-body culminates in assumption of one’s inner identity as Kapālīśabhairava at the heart of a maṇḍala of goddesses, all of whom collectively comprise the Nine-Syllable Vidyā. Although framed as a

preliminary to ritual action, this process of mantra-installation (nyāsa) is in fact the very template of ritual, both inner and outer; it has both elaborate and abbreviated forms, with numerous inflections. I here summarize one of several long descriptions of this process, the padmamālāvidhi (“method/procedure of the lotus garlands”) of BraYā, chapter 4 (vv. 497ff.): 

First one visualizes the avadhūtaṃ (i.e. the avadhūtā śakti), whose func tion in this application is analagous to the ādhāraśakti (“basal power”) of most Śaiva systems.18 This begins preparation of the practitioner’s body as locus for installation of the deities, from the crest (śikhā) of the head to the feet. A series of nine lotuses is visualized situated at points in the body called granthis (knots or joints). These are located at the crown of the head (śikhā), the forehead (lalāṭa), throat (kaṇṭha), navel (nābhi), knees ( jānu), mouth (vaktra), heart (hṛd), genitals (guhya), and feet (pāda), fol lowing the order of their sequence in nyāsa. The eight-petalled lotuses situated therein are loci for installation of the principal nine deities: Kapālīśabhairava, who is installed in the crown lotus, and two sets of four goddesses, the Devīs and the Dūtīs. In each lotus one prepares a mantric seat for the deity, whose complete mantra-forms are then installed, inclu sive of their ancillary mantras (aṅga).19 Each of the eight goddesses is installed in a lotus along with the mantra-body of Kapālīśabhairava, who is thus coupledwith each goddess.20 This series of nineforms the Brahma yāmala’s principal padmamālā, the garland of Devīs and Dūtīs, which is illustrated in figure 16.1. While one might associate bodily lotuses with the body seated in yogic meditation, here a standing position with the legs together is implied, for a single lotus presides over the two knees and likewise feet. 

Next is installed a second series of seven lotuses, the garland of Yoginīs (figure 16.2b).21 In contrast to the first lotus garland, these do not lie in a vertical axis. Three form a kind of girdle: one lotus is placed in the center

of the waist, on the back (kaṭipṛṣṭhe), while the other two lie on either side of the waist. The remaining four lotuses are situated on the sides of the knees and feet. Installed upon these lotuses are goddesses known as the Six Yoginīs, led by a male deity, Ādivīra (“Primordial Hero”), positioned in the lotus on the back of the waist (see figure 16.2b). 

A third series of lotuses serves as the locus for installation of the Eight Mother-goddesses (aṣṭa mātaraḥ), accompanied by the male deity Mātṛvīra (figure 16.2a).22 In this case as well the lotuses do not form a vertical axis, lying at various positions on the head and torso: the points between the eyebrows (bhrūmadhya) and between the eyes, the tip of the nose, and each ear. Next are a point between the throat and heart, another between the heart and navel, and an unspecified place on the back or spine,23 locus of the goddess Carcikā or Cāmuṇḍā. The eighth mātṛ, the supreme śakti, Paramā, also called Aghorī or Yogeśī, pervades the entire body, lacking a lotus base and being devoid of ancillary mantras.24 

In figure 16.2, the second and third lotus garlands are shown together, thus illus trating the empowerment of the upper and lower bodies by mantra. 

2 The Cord of Power (śaktitantu, śaktisūtra) 

What renders the lotuses into garlands (padmamālā) is the thread which binds them. The BraYā first introduces this idea in presenting the second garland (that of the Yoginīs), describing the lotuses as “bound together by the cord of śakti, like gems [strung] by a cord” (śaktitantunibaddhāni sūtreṇa maṇayo yathā, 4.526cd). The terms utilized are śaktitantu and śaktisūtra, meaning, respectively, a thread or a cord of śakti. This divine power binding the lotuses together is consubstantial with the supreme Goddess herself, the Nine-Syllable Vidyā whose being encompasses the deities of the maṇḍala. 

A concept seemingly unique to the BraYā, the śaktitantu or śaktisūtra re ceives minimal explication. References to it occur almost entirely in the con text of the “method of the lotus garlands” (padmamālāvidhi). In what manner the cord connects the lotuses of the three garlands is somewhat ambiguous. For the first garland, whose lotuses form a vertical series, the śaktitantu must

string them together vertically from crest to feet (figure 16.1). In the case of the third padmamālā, the śaktisūtra likely begins from the lotus between the eye brows (bhrūmadhya), the uppermost of this series and locus of the male deity Mātṛvīra, lord of the Mother-goddesses (mātṛ). The cord pierces (bhid-) and thus strings together eight lotuses (figure 16.2a).25 Unlike those of the first gar land, these do not form a vertical axis in the body, and it is unclear precisely how and in what sequence the śaktitantu links them together: does the cord form a garland-like closed circuit, or connect the lotuses like a strand? This śakti tantu extends through the body in three dimensions, for the seventh lotus is located on the back, forming the locus of Carcikā, i.e. Cāmuṇḍā.26 In the case of the second padmamālā, that of the yoginīs, the manner in which the śakti tantu connects the lotuses seems less ambiguous (figure 16.2b). The garland is threaded from a lotus on the back of the waist,27 extending outwards to lotuses on the sides of the waist, then downwards to lotuses on the sides of the knees and feet. Although this is not explicitly stated, the cord might connect the foot lotuses together in a garland-like manner, so forming a closed circuit. 

The principal series of nine lotuses spans the body’s axis from crest (śikhā) to feet, linked by the śaktitantu and thus forming a vertical strand (figure 16.1). This vertical sequence of bodily lotuses connected by a cord of śakti has obvi ous similarities with models of the yogic body in which suṣumnā nāḍī, the central channel, links together an ascending series of cakras or lotuses. This ubiquitous paradigm is exemplified by the system of seven cakras common to Śrīvidyā and Haṭhayoga, identified by Sanderson (1988, 687–688) as being first attested in the Kubjikāmata. Like the śaktitantu, the suṣumnā is closely iden tified with śakti, especially in the form of the bodily kuṇḍalinī. The suṣumnā of yoga and the BraYā’s śaktitantu both unite a vertical series of lotuses situ ated at particular “knots” (granthis) in the body, including such standard loca tions as the crest, forehead, throat, heart, navel, and genital region. While the suṣumnā came to be envisioned as a vertical channel extending upwards from the heart, navel region, or base of the torso,28 there is an old precedent for the idea that it extends, like the śaktitantu, to the feet: the Mataṅgapārameśvara, a comparatively early Siddhāntatantra, envisions the suṣumnā running from

the tips of the big toes to the crown of the head via the navel and heart.29 This archaic model of a central channel extending to the feet, linking together vari ous granthis, may underlie the BraYā’s conception of the śaktitantu. 

It should perhaps be emphasized that the BraYā’s series of lotuses do not in any simple sense represent “structures” of a subtle or “yogic” anatomy. The lotus-seats (āsana) of the mantra-deities are created through meditative visu alization: one actively engenders a divine body of mantra rather than reifying a subtle reality already latent in the body. More precisely, through the padma mālāvidhi, one imaginatively superimposes the mantric body (mantravigraha) of Bhairava upon one’s own corpus and psyche. That the deity-lotuses do not represent fixed structures of a subtle body is illustrated by variations in their sequence: chapter 21 provides an alternative order of the principal nine deities, placing Bhairava in the heart,30 while an inflection of the padmamālāvidhi in chapter 45 inverts their typical sequence, placing Bhairava in the lotus of the feet.31 An alternative version of the second garland has the lotuses of the Six Yoginīs encircle the waist like a girdle.32 

Nonetheless, while the BraYā does not treat the lotus garlands as fixtures of a subtle body, it does posit the existence of such structures: the body’s channels (nāḍī) and vital airs (vāyu, prāṇa), for instance, and more pertinently, points known as granthis (“knots” or “joints”). A particular series of nine granthis forms the locus for installing the nine lotuses of the primary padmamālā. That granthis were considered to be anatomical realities is suggested by their treat ment as points in the body rather than as objects to be placed/installed (nyas-) in the body or engendered through meditation (kalp-, cint-, etc.).33 Integral to the idea of the padmamālā is this correlation between a vertical sequence of

30 BraYā 21.125ab: hṛdaye bhairavo nyasya vaktranetrāṅgasaṃyutaṃ (understanding bhai ravo as accusative in sense). 

31 In BraYā 45.390–397, the sequence of installation (nyāsa) for inner worship is from feet (Bhairava) to head (Paramā Śakti). See the notes of Kiss (2015, 281–282).

33 The granthis are referred to solely by their locations in the body. Take for example BraYā 4.564c–565, which specifies the “knot of the throat” (kaṇṭhagranthi) as locus for the lotus of goddess Karālī: anenaiva vidhānena karālīṃ [em.; karālī ms.] vinyaset punaḥ || kaṇṭha granthigate [em.; °sate ms.] padme nātra kārya vicāraṇāt | nābhipadme [em.; °padmes ms.] tathaiveha caṇḍākṣīṃ [em.; °ākṣī ms.] vinyased budhaḥ ||. (Emendation of sate to gate is trivial, given the frequent confusion of śa and ga in the old manuscript, and the interchangability of śa and sa.) 
 

the lotus garland and cord of power 401 

lotuses and the body’s nine knots, which are repeatedly described as dividing the garland.34 In the case of the two secondary padmamālās, the lotuses’ posi tions in the body do not on the whole correlate with granthis. This supports the idea that the primary padmamālā is rooted in a model of the yogic body in which nine granthis are united by a central channel (nāḍī), which the BraYā reconceives of as the śaktitantu. This cord of śakti, unique to the BraYā, appears to combine what in later traditions would be differentiated as the suṣumnā nāḍī and the bodily (as opposed to cosmogonic) kuṇḍalinī.35 

Although archaic tantric conceptions of the yogic body may have inspired the BraYā’s lotus garlands and cord of power, the concept primarily describes the practitioner’s assumption of a divine body of mantra. This avadhūtatanu, “body of pure śakti,” is formed by lotuses of the three garlands and united by the śaktitantu, shown as whole in figure 16.3. This embodies the entire pantheon of deities as well as the hierarchy of ontic levels (tattvakrama), from the earth ele ment to paramaśiva.36 The avadhūtatanu taken on by the sādhaka mirrors, in part, the mantra-body of the deity as Sadāśiva; his divine form is composed of a garland of nine lotuses pierced by the cord of power, further augmented by a triad of cosmological powers—vāmā, raudrī, and jeṣṭhā.37 To assume the 

34 Note for instance BraYā 21.123c–124b: śaktitantunibaddhān tu padmamālāṃ [em.; mālā ms.] vicintayet ||123|| navagranthivibhāgena tato nyāsaṃ prakalpayet | (“One should visu alize the garland of lotuses as bound by the cord of śakti, then one should perform mantra-installation, according to the division of the nine knots [where are positioned the lotuses]”). 

35 Key to this issue is the question of whether and by what other names the BraYā conceives of a central channel (nāḍī). While the BraYā does attest the common nāḍī triad of iḍā, piṅgalā, and suṣumnā, the expression suṣumnā (which in most sources refers to the central channel) occurs only once (18.80) in the earlier stratum of the BraYā—its first fifty chap ters. Its meaning in later chapters, where it does occur several times, is ambiguous. It may not (always) be the middle channel: it is never specifically designated as such, and BraYā 85.138cd seemingly refers to an unmamed middle channel between iḍā and suṣumnā (iḍā suṣumnayor madhye muktimārggānusāriṇī). Concerning the early history of suṣumnā, see the preliminary remarks of Goodall et al. (2015, 33–34). 

36 Note e.g. BraYā 45.104ab: śaktitantu tato dhyātvā śivādyavanigocare. Similar expressions abound in the BraYā.

avadhūtatantu is, more specifically, to take on the mantra-body (mantravi graha) of Kapālīśabhairava, the deities of whose largely female maṇḍala per vade the lotus garlands. Strung together by the cord of śakti, the lotuses of all the goddesses are also simultaneously loci of Bhairava, whose seed-syllable hūṃ appears in each, paired with the presiding goddess.38 Thus it is that the BraYā’s opening benediction invokes the bhairavatattva as sporting in the form of the liṅgam in the lotuses of his consorts.39 

While the sādhaka seeks apotheosis as Bhairava, the divine body he takes on, the avadhūtatanu, in fact consists of a feminine power which ultimately tran scends the male deity. The “unblemished” or “pure” (avadhūtā) śakti is present not only as the cord which unites the lotus garlands: in mantric terms, she also pervades the garlands as hāṃ, the final syllable of the Nine-Syllable Vidyā (with the addition of anusvāra). In this form she is known as Paramā or Yogeśī, the eighth and highest Mother-goddess from whom the others emerge,40 and as Aghorī or Bhairavī, consort of Bhairava. Her simultaneous pervasion of the body and syllabic presence in each lotus are intimated in BraYā 4.595–596b:

padmāsanavihīnā tu vinyaset sādhakottamaḥ ||595||

The best of sādhakas should install the supreme sakti[hāṃ] on the entire body, without face, eye, or limb mantras, devoid of a lotus seat; one should [also] envision her in each lotus, conjoining/possessing the lotus gar lands.

the lotus garland and cord of power 403 

As holds true for the deity maṇḍala in all its forms, the supreme goddess has a transcendent, subtle presence, lacking a singular locus.43 Thus while Kapāl īśabhairava reigns from the uppermost lotus, the formless, all-encompassing reality to which the sādhaka aspires is “a feminine power which transcends the male-female dichotomy which patterns the lower revelations” (Sanderson1988, 672). 

3 Yoga and the Integration of Inner and Outer Ritual 

The “method of the lotus garlands” (padmamālāvidhi) has more and less elab orate forms and numerous inflections. At its simplest, one installs the seed syllables of the principal deities in nine lotuses.44 The procedure of the lotus garlands applies not only to the body, but to ritual involving external supports as well. Thus for the worship system ( yāga) taught in chapter 12, one begins by laying out nine lotuses in a square maṇḍala on a substrate, then visualizing the śaktitantu and installing the mantra-deities.45 After envisioning an elabo rate mantric throne for installation of Bhairava in the central lotus, one engages in the somatic performance of worship. Subsequently, the procedure is repli cated in full detail inwardly “by the path of yoga” ( yogamārgeṇa), seated in the lotus posture.46 ‘Outer’ ritual thus begins with meditative visualization and is followed by the rite’s recapitulation internally. 

While the padmamālāvidhi represents a basic template for ritual and the empowerment of the body, ritual may be patterned by divergent pantheons, especially the practitioner’s personal pantheon (svayāga), a configuration of the mantra-deities established through initiation. These personalized inflec tions of the root pantheon (the mūlayāga) are nine in number, based on the predominance of each of the nine major deities in turn.47 In the obligatory daily worship (nityakarman) and much other ritual, inner worship (hṛdyāga) of this specific pantheon forms the standard preliminary to bahirnyāsa, the act of 

43 See the discussion of Kiss (2015, 20–22), a section fittingly titled “Where is Caṇḍā Kāpā linī?” 

44 This minimal (svalpa) form of nyāsa is described in BraYā 18.75–79. 

45 BraYā 12.1–3: athātaḥ saṃpravakṣyāmi āsanaṃ pūrvvam eva hi | yāgaṃ caiva mahādevi sādhakānāṃ hitāya vai ||1|| pūrvvokte maṇḍale caiva gandhamaṇḍalake pi vā | puṣpa maṇḍalake vāpi śaktitantu vicintayet ||2||tasyādho praṇavaṃ dadyā kālāgnintatra vinyaset | kṣīrodaṃ tan tu vinyasya avadhūtaṃ tato nyaset ||3||.

47 Concerning the nine pantheons (navayāgāḥ), see the brief remarks in Kiss 2015,16–18, and the article navayāga in Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. III.

installing the mantra-syllables upon the body or another substratum, whether the fire pit, ritual vessel, or icon.48 Applications of mantra-deity pantheons not based upon the Nine-Syllable Vidyā also follow this alternating pattern of inner and outer ritual.While worship ( yāga, yajana) provides the essential paradigm for the BraYā’s integration of inner and outer ritual, the principle and prac tice of their integration applies more widely. This is abundantly evident in the domain of “magic,” including all manner of rites involving alphabetical wheels (cakra), images of the deities (pratimā), and two-dimensional figures ( yantra). These processes may entail, for example, the fusion of the channels of one’s own body with the spokes drawn in the lotus of a cakra—the term nāḍī refers to both—which may then be fused with the channels of the targeted victim (sādhya).49 

Given the integral unity of outer and inner ritual, of somatic acts and sub jective processes, the question arises as to whether and in what manner ‘yoga’ represents, for the BraYā, a domain of practice meaningfully distinct from ‘rit ual’ (kriyā or karman). The evidence is ambiguous, at least for what seems likely to be the core, early stratum of the text (chapters 1–50, more or less).50 Occurrences of the term yoga in the sense of meditational practice—often in the phrase yogamārgeṇa, “via the path of/by way of meditation”—generally seem synonymous with inner ritual (adhyātmakriyā). Chapter 12, for instance, describes the procedure of the inner padmamālā as “installation of the sakti” (śaktinyāsa) through “visualizing by way of yoga” ( yogamārgeṇa saṃciṃtya, 12.35cd).51 On the whole, meditational disciplines are so well integrated into 

48 E.g. BraYā 4.366c–367b: yāgasthānaṃ tato gatya hṛdyāgan tu prakalpayet ||366|| svayāgo tthena mārgeṇa bahi nyāsaṃ tathaiva ca |. A detailed description of inner worship (hṛd yāga) of one’s own pantheon (svayāga) appears in BraYā 38.24c–31, in this case as a pre liminary to fire ritual (agnikārya). 

49 To give an example, I quote from my remarks on parakāyapraveśa (“entry into the body of another”) in Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. III: “PBY(H) [Picumata-Brahmayāmala] 14.254– 263ab describes a practice in which one should fuse ( yojayet) the nāḍīs of the yogic body with those of a cakra of the kulavidyā-mantra of this system, inscribed on cloth, metal or wood (PBY(H) 14.240). In this case the purpose is the extraction of ‘nectars’: ‘The sād haka, thus exiting the body through the tip of the nose, should enter the body of another and perform the extraction of nectars, after fusing [his with the victim’s] nāḍīs; about this, there is no need for deliberation’ (evaṃ dehā[d] viniṣkramya nāsikāgreṇa sādhakaḥ || paradeham vi[ś]et mantrī amṛtākṛṣṭiñ ca kārayet | nāḍīsaṃdhānakaṃ kṛtvā nātra kārya vicāraṇāt, PBY(H) 14.259cd–260).”

the BraYā’s ritual systems that to treat these as a distinct domain of practice— whether or not designated yoga—seems artificial. However, three brief chap ters of the core text do focus on meditational practices which, exceptionally, seem virtually independent from somatic acts and external supports.52 More over, a passage in chapter 25 specifies that a sādhaka who aspires for libera tion (themumukṣu), rather than supernatural experiences and powers (bhoga), should devote himself to a simplified pantheon worship ( yāga), giving up all other rituals (karman) and “abiding by the path of yoga.”While not abandoned, outer ritual here assumes a simplified form, the emphasis shifting decidedly toward inner practice.53 Thus the degree to which meditational disciplines feature primarily as integral elements of ritual may simply reflect the BraYā’s emphasis on supernatural attainment (siddhi): the path of yoga, ultimately, is for seekers of liberation. 

The Brahmayāmala likely has two or more distinct textual strata,54 and yoga proves to be an area in which stark contrasts emerge between these: later chapters of the text introduce yogic practices and emphases seemingly unanticipated in the core fifty-odd chapters. These include systems of med itation focused on a series of inner voids and resonances,55 a yoga system based on internalization of visionary encounters with the goddesses ( yogin īmelaka),56 yogic practices for cheating death (a system which, in contrast

52 These are chapters 36 (nāḍīsañcārapaṭala), 41 (bindupaṭala), and 44 (krīḍākarmapaṭala). The latter, for instance, describes meditation upon the self in the lotus of the heart; merg ing with bindu, one gains the ability to traverse the universe in various forms. BraYā 44.2– 3, 8: hṛddeśe kamalaṃ dhyātvā vyomapaṅkajasaṃyutaṃ | bindumadhye nyase ’tmānaṃ [em.; nyasen mānaṃ ms.] viśvadeham ayaṃ śubhaṃ ||2|| śaktibhiḥ kiraṇopetaṃ tārā ṣṭakavibhūṣitaṃ | taṃ dhyāyet paramaṃ rūpaṃ bindulīnaṃ śivātmakaṃ ||3|| … antarīkṣe tathā bhūmau pātāleṣu ca dehiṣu | anya-m-anyeṣu rūpeṣu vicaren nātra saṃśayaḥ ||8||. For another example of the separation of meditation and ritual, BraYā 24.16c–17b speaks of meditative absorption (samādhi) as an activity one may engage in during interludes between the daily rites: japayukto kṣapen mantrī prāta[r]madhyāhṇikottaraṃ||16||śāstra saṅgena vā saṃstho atha vā samādhiṣu sthitaḥ [em.; sthitau ms.] |.

to the core chapters, attests the bodily kuṇḍalinī),57 and a kind of “yoga of absorption” (layayoga) based on the granthis of the principal padmamālā.58 While not embeded within critiques of outer ritual, these diverse yogas of the text’s later stratum tend to eschew external supports and somatic, performa tive acts. Far from being disciplines limited to the liberation seeker, these yogas offer the possibility of accomplishing the sādhaka’s aims through inner acts alone, potentially superceding outer ritual. This is particularly evident in chap ter 100, which teaches a “rite for mastery of the clans of goddesses through yoga” ( yogena kulasādhanam). Attainment of direct, power-bestowing encoun ters (melaka) with the goddesses is one of the BraYā’s dominant ritual aims, as illustrated by the “rite for the mastery of vetālas” (vetālasādhana, ch. 15), “rite of the great churning” (mahāmanthāna, ch. 46), “pavilion of power” (siddhi maṇḍapikā, ch. 47), and “worship in the pit [of power]” ([siddhi]garttāyāga, ch. 48). These virtuoso and macabre performances may culminate with the goddesses manifesting bodily before the sādhaka and granting boons. Belying this pattern, the yoga of chapter100 offers the possibility of accomplishing mas tery over the clans of goddesses through a process of inner realization alone.59 Similarly, the yoga of BraYā 99 (called vijñānapañcaka, “the five knowledges”) promises the ability to enter the bodies of others without recourse to external supports (cakra or yantra), through manipulation of a series of inner reso nances (rāva).60 Incorporation of such meditational disciplines into the text’s latter strata marks a trend towards increasing differentiation between medita tion and ‘ritual’—between yoga and kriyā—and the subversion of outer forms of ritual. The possibility of attaining all ritual aims through yoga alone brings the vulgate BraYā closer to the Tantrasadbhāva’s hierarchical dichotomy of the inner and outer, whereby the externalities of ritual are subsumed by inner real ities. It is thus possible in this literature to trace early steps in the direction of Abhinavagupta’s gnostic nondualism, which further overlays the dichotomy of jñāna and kriyā upon that of inner and outer ritual.

### 17 The Amṛtasiddhi: Haṭhayoga’s Tantric Buddhist Source Text 

James Mallinson 

Like many of the contributors to this volume, I had the great fortune to have Professor Sanderson as the supervisor of my doctoral thesis,whichwas a critical edition of an early text on haṭhayoga called the Khecarīvidyā. At the outset of my work on the text, and for several subsequent years, I expected that Sander son’s encyclopedic knowledge of the Śaiva corpus would enable us to find within it forerunners of khecarīmudrā, the haṭhayogic practice central to the Khecarīvidyā. However, notwithstanding a handful of instances of teachings on similar techniques, the fully-fledged practice does not appear to be taught in earlier Śaiva works. In subsequent years, as I read more broadly in the corpus of early texts on haṭhayoga (which, in comparison to the vast Śaiva corpus, is relatively small and thus may easily be read by one individual), I came to the realisation that almost all of the practices which distinguish haṭhayoga from other methods of yoga were unique to it at the time of their codification and are not to be found in the corpus of earlier Śaiva texts, despite repeated asser tions in secondary literature that haṭhayoga was a development from Śaivism (or “tantra” more broadly conceived). 

The texts of the haṭhayoga corpus do, however, couch their teachings in tantric language. The name of the haṭhayogic khecarīmudrā, for example, is also that of an earlier but different Śaiva practice. When I was invited to speak at the symposium in Professor Sanderson’s honour held in Toronto in 2015, I decided to try to articulate my rather inchoate thoughts on this subject by presenting a paper entitled “Haṭhayoga’s Śaiva Idiom.” The inadequacy of my theories was brought home to me some months after the symposium when I started to read, together with two other former students of Sanderson, Péter Dániel Szántó and Jason Birch,1 a twelfth-century manuscript of the Amṛtasid dhi (AS), the earliest text to teach many of the key principles and practices of

haṭhayoga.2 I had already read much of the text with Sanderson and others, but only from later manuscript sources. As we read the older manuscript it gradu ally became clear that the Amṛtasiddhi was composed in a Vajrayāna (tantric Buddhist) milieu. 

Thus my notion of haṭhayoga having a Śaiva idiom needed readdressing. One might perhaps talk instead of its“tantric idiom.” ButI shall leave reflections on that topic for a later date and in this short paper focus on the Amṛtasiddhi and, in particular, the features of it which make it clear that it was composed in a Vajrayāna milieu. I am currently preparing a critical edition and anno tated translation of the text with Dr Szántó; what follows here results from our work in progress. Despite our edition being incomplete, I am confident that the conclusion drawn here about the origins of the text is sound (and that further work on the text will provide additional and complementary evi dence) and I think it important enough to warrant preliminary publication. Subsequent publications will address this unique text’s many other remarkable features. 

1 The Amṛtasiddhi 

The importance of the Amṛtasiddhi was first brought to scholarly attention by Kurtis Schaeffer in an article published in 2002.3 Here I shall reprise as little of his rich and dense article as is necessary to provide the background to what follows. Schaeffer focuses on the twelfth-century4 manuscript of the text, pho 

2 I thank Professors Kurtis Schaeffer and Leonard van der Kuijp for sharing with me pho tographs of printouts from a microfilm copy of this manuscript. Schaeffer also kindly shared his draft edition of the Tibetan translation of the Amṛtasiddhi given in this witness. We read the manuscript together with a collation of other witnesses, including a transcription of the Grantha manuscript M2 prepared by Viswanath Gupta, whom I thank for his assistance. Con cerning manuscript sigla for the Amṛtasiddhi, please refer below to the section “Witnesses of the Amṛtasiddhi.” 

3 Prior to Schaeffer’s article, the only mention of the text of which I am aware (other than in manuscript catalogues) is Gode1954, 22, in which its citations in theYogacintāmaṇi are noted. 4 Schaeffer (2002, 517) says that the manuscript’s colophon gives a date which “may read 1159c.e.” The reading is clear:ekāśītijute[°juteis Newar scribal dialect for Sanskrit°yute]śāke sahāsraike tu phālgune | kṛṣṇāṣṭamyāṃ samāpto ’yaṃ kṛtvāmṛtasiddhir mayā || (f.37v). The eighth day of the dark fortnight of the lunar month of Phālguna in Śāka 1081 corresponds to March 2nd 1160ce (according to the calculator at http://www.cc.kyoto‑su.ac.jp/yanom/ pancanga/). It is possible that the colophon has been copied from an examplar and that the manuscript itself does not date to 1160. The mansucript’s Tibetan colophon says that the Tibetan translation is that of the “monk of the Bya [clan]” (Bya ban de) Pad ma ’od zer, who 
 

the amṛtasiddhi: haṭhayoga’s tantric buddhist source text 411 

tographs of printouts from a microfilm of which he and Leonard van der Kuijp have kindly shared with me. At the time that the microfilm was made, the manuscript was in Beijing, although Schaeffer believes that it has since been returned to Tibet. The manuscript is unique in that it is bilingual, with three registers: the Sanskrit text in a Nepali or east Indian script, a transliteration of the Sanskrit in Tibetan hand-printing script and a translation5 into Tibetan in the Tibetan cursive script. 

This manuscript is referred to in what follows by the siglum C. The other witnesses of the text which have been collated are considerably later than C (the oldest is perhaps the c. 17th-century K1). They present versions of the text in which redaction has removed or obscured some of the Buddhist features evident in C. These witnesses may be divided into two groups. The first is a sin gle Grantha manuscript from the Mysore Government Oriental Library (M2), the second seven north Indian and Nepali manuscripts, two from Jodhpur’s Maharaja Man Singh Pustak Prakash (J1 and J2 = J) and four from the Nepal German Manuscript Preservation Project (K1–K4 = K).6 

The text of the Amṛtasiddhi consists of 303 verses divided into 35 short vivekas.7 The first ten vivekas teach the constituents of the yogic body. Vivekas 11–13 teach three methods of manipulating those constituents (mahāmudrā, mahābandha and mahāvedha) and viveka 14 teaches the practice (abhyāsa), i.e. how the three methods are to be used together. Vivekas 15–18 teach the four grades of aspirant, 19–33 the four states (avasthās) of yoga, and 34–35 the final transformation of the body leading up to nirvāṇa.8 

worked towards the end of the eleventh century, which provides us with an earlier terminus ante quem for the text than the date of the manuscript itself. 

5 As noted in the manuscript’s Tibetan colophon, the translation is of a different recension of the Sanskrit text from that given in the manuscript. At some places, e.g. 7.10 and 7.26, the translation corresponds to the text as found in the other witnesses, but not that in C. 6 Full details of these witnesses are given at the end of this article. 

7 There are 35 vivekas in the Beijing ms and 38 in the others. All verse numbering given here corresponds to the order of verses in C (which does not itself give verse numbers). 8 Vivekas19–35 are interspersed with very short chapters on a variety of topics.In the first viveka (vv. 10–13) there is a list of the topics to be taught in the text. The list corresponds exactly to the vivekas up to viveka 19, but then goes awry. More analysis is needed to be sure, but it seems likely that at least some of the viveka divisions after 19 are later additions to the text. 
 

412 mallinson 2 The Amṛtasiddhi in the Haṭhayoga Tradition 

2.1 Citations and Borrowings 

The Amṛtasiddhi is a seminal work in the haṭhayoga textual tradition.9 Scha effer (2002, 518–519) mentions its citations in the Yogacintāmaṇi (c. 1600ce)10 and Haṭhapradīpikājyotsnā (1837ce).11In addition, several haṭhayoga texts bor row directly from the Amṛtasiddhi without attribution. The c. 13th-century Gorakṣaśataka shares three half-verses with it.12 The Vivekamārtaṇḍa, which is also likely to date to the 13th century redacts four of the Amṛtasiddhi’s verses into three.13 The c.14th-century Amaraughaprabodha shares six verses with the Amṛtasiddhi and paraphrases it extensively elsewhere.14 The Gorakṣayogaśās tra (15th century or earlier) borrows two and a half verses15 and extensively paraphrases other parts of the text. The c. 15th-century Śivasaṃhitā is much the biggest borrower from the Amṛtasiddhi, sharing 34 verses with it.16 The Haṭhapradīpikā shares five half-verses with the Amṛtasiddhi, but these may be borrowed from the Amaraughaprabodha since all the shared passages are also in that text.17 

2.2 Doctrinal Innovations 

Several of the Amṛtasiddhi’s teachings have no prior attestation and are central to teachings on haṭhayoga in later texts, where they are either reproduced ver 

9 Despite the compound haṭhayoga being found in earlier Vajrayāna works (Birch 2011, 535– 536) and its teachings being central to later haṭhayogic texts, the Amṛtasiddhi does not call its yoga method haṭha. This paradox will be addressed in subsequent publications.

batim, as noted above, or incorporated into new compositions. These may be summarised as follows. 

1. The Yogic Body 

a. The Amṛtasiddhi is the first text to relocate to the body the old tantric triad of sun, moon and fire.18 The idea of a moon in the skull dripping amṛta is found in many earlier tantric works, but that of the sun in the stomach consuming it is new, as is the conflation of the sun and fire.

(1) The sphere of the sun is at the base of the Central Chan 

nel, complete with twelve digits, shining with its rays. (2) 

The lord of creatures (Prajāpati), of intense appearance, 

travels upwards on the right. Staying in the pathways in the 

spaces (ākāśapatha)19 in the channels it pervades the entire 

body. (3) The sun consumes the lunar secretion, wanders 

in the sphere of the wind and burns up all the bodily con 

stituents in all bodies. 

iii. Fire 

kalābhir daśabhir yuktaḥ sūryamaṇḍalamadhyataḥ | 

vasati vastideśe ca vahnir annavipācakaḥ ||5.1|| 

18 This triad is mentioned at Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā Nayasūtra 4.147 and in many subsequent tantric works. 

19 This is a śleṣa: ākāśapatha can also mean the sun’s orbit in the sky.

b. The use of the word bindu for semen, bindu’s identification with the amṛta dripping from the moon, its preservation being essential for life and its division into male and female are all innovations of the Amṛtasiddhi which are widely adopted in later haṭhayoga texts.

the amṛtasiddhi: haṭhayoga’s tantric buddhist source text 415 

(8) Know bindu to be of two kinds, male and female. Semen 

(bīja) is said to be the male [bindu] and rajas (female gener 

ative fluid) is female. (9) As a result of their external union 

people are created. When they are united internally, then one 

is declared a yogi. (10) Bindu resides in Kāmarūpa in the hollow 

of the multi-storied palace (kūṭāgārasya).20 Through pleasur 

able contact at Pūrṇagiri it travels along the Central Channel. 

(11) Rajasresides in the great sacred field in the perineal region 

( yonimadhye). It is as red as a javā flower21 and is supported 

by the Goddess element (devītattvasamādhṛtam). (12) Know 

bindu to be made of the moon and rajas to be made of the 

sun. Their union is to be brought about in the very inaccessible 

multi-storeyed palace. 

c. A connection between the mind and breath is taught as early as the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (6.8.2). The Amṛtasiddhi is the first text to teach that mind, breath and bindu are connected, a notion found in many subsequent haṭhayoga texts.

17d tasyaiva ] CKYHJ; tasthyai∗ M2, tathaiva J 

It is taught that when the breath moves bindu moves; the mind of he whose bindu is moving is restless. 

d. The three granthis. 

The Amṛtasiddhi’s system of three granthis, brahma°, viṣṇu° and rudra°, which are situated along the central channel of the body and are to be pierced by the mahāvedha (13.10–11), is very common in subsequent haṭhayoga texts.22 

20 On the kūṭāgāra, see below, p. 418. 

21 The bright red javā flower (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.), popularly known as the China Rose, is common throughout south, southeast and east Asia. 

22 Granthis are mentioned in many earlier Śaiva texts, some of whose lists include brahma, viṣṇu and rudra granthis but not in the Amṛtasiddhi’s configuration. See e.g. Kubjikā 
 

416 mallinson 

2. The three practices, mahāmudrā, mahābandha, mahāvedha (vivekas 11– 13). 

These practices, which involve bodily postures and breath control, are used to make the breath enter the central channel and rise upwards. They are an innovation of the Amṛtasiddhi and are taught in all subsequent haṭhayoga texts, albeit sometimes with different names. 

3. The four avasthās 

The four avasthās, “states” or “stages” of yoga practice (ārambha, ghaṭa, paricaya, niṣpanna/niṣpatti) introduced in the Amṛtasiddhi (vivekas 19– 33), are taught in many Sanskrit haṭhayoga texts; they are also mentioned in the old Hindi Gorakhbāṇī (śabds 136–139). 

In addition to these innovations, in viveka 14 (abhyāsa, “practice”) the Amṛ tasiddhi describes, at a level of detail unparalleled in other texts, the internal processes brought about by its methods, in particular the movement of the breaths. 

3 Buddhist Features of the Amṛtasiddhi 

In Schaeffer’s analysis of the Amṛtasiddhi (2002, 521–524), he notes how it is unique amongst Tibetan Buddhist works because its teachings are said to bestow jīvanmukti, “liberation while living,” and make the yogi identical with Śiva. Despite these Śaiva features, however, close reading of manuscript C, the twelfth-century bilingual witness of the text, shows that the text was composed within a Vajrayāna milieu. Furthermore, it pits its teachings against those of other Vajrayāna schools, not Śaiva ones. 

As can be seen in the examples given below, manuscript C generally has the best readings of the text and presents its Buddhist teachings intact. In the other manuscripts the specifically Buddhist doctrines found in C are either unwit tingly included, misunderstood (and sometimes presented in corrupt forms as a result) or deliberately changed or omitted. 

Some of the text’s Buddhist features are ambiguous or obscure enough for them to have been preserved by the redactors of the text as presented in the later witnesses. Thus we find multiple examples of Vajrayāna (or more broadly Buddhist) terminology such as mahāmudrā (viveka 11 and 31), vajrapañjara (7.26d), jñānasaṃbhāra (6.9c, 20.2bc), śūnya (8.2a, 8.8d, 8.10d, 19.15a, 20.7b, 

matatantra 17.61–84, in which there are sixteen granthis and Netratantra 7.22–25, in which there are twelve. 
 

25.1c), niṣpanna (19.2c, 31.1c) and abhiṣeka (13.15a). Similarly, Amṛtasiddhi 7.4 mentions the very specifically Vajrayāna notion of the four blisses:23 

ānandā ye prakathyante viramāntāḥ śarīrataḥ | 

te ’pi bindūdbhavāḥ sarve jyotsnā candrabhavā yathā ||7.4|| 

4c °viramāntāḥ ] C; ciram antaś M2, viramāṃtā JK 

The [four] bodily blisses whose last is [the bliss of] cessation all arise from bindu, just as moonlight arises from the moon. 

Other Buddhist features of the text as found in C are deliberately omitted or altered in the later witnesses. Examples of these are listed below. This list is not exhaustive; further close reading of the text is likely to reveal more examples. 1. Chinnamastā 

Manuscript C opens with a sragdharā maṅgala verse in praise of the god dess Chinnamastā: 

nābhau śubhrāravindaṃ tadupari vimalaṃ maṇḍalaṃ caṇḍaraśmeḥ saṃsārasyaikasārā tribhuvanajananī dharmavartmodayā yā | 

tasmin madhye trimārge tritayatanudharā chinnamastā praśastā tāṃ vande jñānarūpāṃ maraṇabhayaharāṃ yoginīṃ yogamudrām ||

c tasmin ] C; tasyāṃ M2 ● tri° ] M2; tre° C ● chinnamastā praśastā ] C; cittahasthāṃ praśastāṃ M2 

d tāṃ vande jñānarūpāṃ ] C; vande jñānasvarūpāṃ M2 

At the navel is a white lotus. On top of that is the spotless orb of the sun. In the middle of that, at the triple pathway, is she who is the sole essence of samsara [and] the creator of the three worlds, who arises on the path of dharma, who has three bodies [and] who is lauded as Chinnamastā, “she whose head is cut.” I worship her, she who has the form of knowledge, who removes the danger of death, the yoginī, the seal of yoga. 

Until the 16th century, Chinnamastā is not mentioned in non-Buddhist texts (Bühnemann 2000, 37). Her Vajrayāna origins have been demon strated by Sanderson (2009, 240–241), who notes how the epithet dhar modayā, found in the Amṛtasiddhi as dharmavartmodayā, is “strictly Bud 

23 On the four blisses see Isaacson and Sferra 2014, passim. 
 

418 mallinson 

dhist.” One might argue that this maṅgala verse could be an addition to the text when it was redacted by a Vajrayāna tradition, but the verse is also found in the Grantha manuscript M2 in a corrupt form. Chin namastā’s name is given therein as Cittahasthā, but the epithets dhar mavartmodayā and tritayatanudharā are preserved. The Rajasthani and Nepali manuscripts omit the verse. 

2. chandoha 

At Amṛtasiddhi 1.16, manuscript C uses the specifically Buddhist term chandoha:24 

sāgarāḥ saritas tatra kṣetrāṇi kṣetrapālakāḥ | 

chandohāḥ puṇyatīrthāni pīṭhāni pīṭhadevatāḥ ||1.16|| 

16c chandohāḥ ]em.; chandohā C, saṃbhedāḥ M2JK 

There are oceans, rivers, regions [and] guardians of the regions; gath ering places (chandohāḥ), sacred sites, seats [of deities and] the deities of the seats 

In Śaiva texts chandoha is found as saṃdoha.25 That the manuscripts other than C read saṃbhedāḥ, which makes no sense, suggests that they may derive from an archetype that had saṃdohāḥ, which subsequent copyists did not understand. 

3. The four elements 

Amṛtasiddhi 6.2 refers to four physical elements: 

pṛthivyādīni catvāri vidhṛtāni pṛthak pṛthak ||6.2|| 

2a catvāri ] C; tattvāni cett. 

The four [elements] earth etc. are kept separate [by the breath]. 

In Śaiva and other Hindu traditions there are five primary physical ele ments. The later manuscripts therefore change catvāri, “four,” to tattvāni, “elements.” 

4. kūṭāgāra 

This is a common term in the Pali Canon, meaning “a building with a peaked roof or pinnacles, possibly gabled; or with an upper storey” (Rhys Davis and Stede 1921–1925, s.v. kūṭāgāra). It is also found in sev eral Vajrayāna texts, where it refers to a “multi-storeyed palace” in the middle of a maṇḍala (Reigle 2012, 442). It is not found in Śaiva texts

Bindu resides at Kāmarūpa,26 in the hollow of the multi-storeyed pal ace. 

5. trivajra 

8.21 in C mentions the three vajras, i.e. the common Vajrayāna triad of kāya, vāk and citta. In the other witnesses trivajrāṇāṃ is found as trivar gāṇāṃ. 

trivajrāṇāṃ samāveśas tadā vai jāyate dhruvam ||8.21|| 

21c trivajrāṇāṃ ] C; trivargāṇāṃ M2JK 

Then absorption into the three vajras is sure to arise. 

6. trikāya 

A reference to the Buddhist notion of the triple body is expunged in the later witnesses: 

sarvajñatvaṃ trikāyasya sarvajñānāvabodhakam | 

lakṣaṇaṃ siddhacittasya jñātavyaṃ jñānaśālibhiḥ ||29.2|| 

2a °kāyasya ] C; °kālasya M2, °kāryasya JK 

2b °bodhakam ] CM2; °bodhanam JK 2c siddhacittasya ] C; siddhivit tasya JK 

Omniscience, which brings about complete understanding of the triple body, should be known by the knowledgable to be the mark of he whose mind has been mastered. 

7. buddha 

Verses in which C has (or its archetype is likely to have had) buddha are reworked in the later witnesses. 

bindur buddhaḥ śivo bindur bindur viṣṇuḥ prajāpatiḥ | 

binduḥ sarvagato devo bindus trailokyadarpaṇaḥ ||7.15||

Bindu is Buddha, bindu is Śiva, bindu is Viṣṇu, the lord of creatures, bindu is the omnipresent god, bindu is the mirror of the three worlds.

3a buddho ] C; ∗ddho M2, ⊔dvo J1, siddho J2, vaddho K 

Even a Buddha, as long as [he remains] unperfected [by means of the practice taught in the Amṛtasiddhi ], is considered a worldly man. 8. svādhiṣṭhāna yoga 

In two places the Amṛtasiddhi mentions svādhiṣṭhāna yoga. This is a method of visualising oneself as a deity which is central to the teach ings of a wide variety of Vajrayāna texts (e.g. Guhyasamāja 7.2, where it is called svādhidaivatayoga, and the Pañcakrama, whose third krama is called the svādhiṣṭhānakrama). In the two verses from the Amṛtasiddhi given below, the methods of svādhiṣṭhāna yoga are said to be ineffective; to achieve the goals of yoga one must use the practice taught in the Amṛ tasiddhi. The later witnesses of the text do not understand the phrase svādhiṣṭhānena yogena and, presumably surmising svādhiṣṭhāna to refer to the second of the six cakras in a system taught in many haṭhayoga texts (but not in the Amṛtasiddhi, which makes no mention of cakras), they change yogena to mārgeṇa in an attempt to make the phrase refer to a pathway in the yogic body. 

svādhiṣṭhānena yogena yasya cittaṃ prasādhyate|

the amṛtasiddhi: haṭhayoga’s tantric buddhist source text 421 

The two [unwanted] guṇas [rajas and tamas] in men are not destroyed by self-established yoga. There is a mudrā especially [for that], born from the lotus-mouth of the guru. 

4 Conclusion 

The Amṛtasiddhi was composed in a Vajrayāna Buddhist milieu and its in tended audience was other Vajrayāna Buddhists.Its teachings are subsequently found in haṭhayoga texts from a wide range of non-Buddhist traditions. This does not mean, however, that haṭhayoga itself was a product of Vajrayāna Buddhists. I have argued elsewhere (e.g. Mallinson 2015) that some haṭhayoga techniques were current among ascetics long before their codification. The Amṛtasiddhi was the first text to codify many of haṭhayoga’s distinctive prin ciples and practices and was thus the first to assign names to them. As a result the Amaraughaprabodha, the first text to teach physical yoga methods under the name haṭha, includes among its techniques the Amṛtasiddhi’s mahāmudrā, mahābandha andmahāvedha (with slight variations in their methods).In addi tion to these physical techniques, the Amaraughaprabodha also adopts from the Amṛtasiddhi the more theoretical doctrine of the four avasthās or stages of yoga, showing that the Amṛtasiddhi’s influence was more than simply termino logical. 

Because they share traditions of 84 siddhas, several scholars have posited connections between Vajrayāna Buddhists and Nāth yogis,27 with whom the practice of haṭhayoga has long been associated. The Amṛtasiddhi’s Vajrayāna origins and its borrowings in subsequent haṭhayoga texts, some of which are products of Nāth traditions, provide the first known doctrinal basis for this con nection and a stimulus for its further investigation.28 

27 Although such usage is not found in pre-modern texts, to avoid confusion I use the word “Nāth” to refer to ascetics usually called yogīs or jogīs in texts and travellers’ reports and whose traditions, with some exceptions such as those which trace their lineages to Kā nhapa or Kṛṣṇācārya, came, by the sixteenth century at the latest, to be grouped together in twelve panths or lineages. On the Nāth Saṃpradāya, see Mallinson 2011. 

28 The historical context of this connection is explored in Mallinson 2019, in which the Konkan site of Kadri (in present-day Mangalore) is proposed as the location of the tran sition from Vajrayāna Buddhism to Nāth Śaivism evinced by the Amaraughaprabodha’s reworking of the teachings of the Amṛtasiddhi.

### 18 A Sexual Ritual with Māyā in 

Matsyendrasaṃhitā 40 

Csaba Kiss 

1 Introduction 

In this short article I revisit the Matsyendrasaṃhitā (hereafter MaSaṃ), a Kubjikā-Tripurā oriented tantric yoga text of the Ṣaḍanvayaśāmbhava tradition, probably from thirteenth-century South India, core chapters of which I edited and translated for my PhD studies under the supervision of Professor Alexis Sanderson. My purpose there was to demonstrate that this text provides evi dence for a transitional phase in the history of Śaiva Tantra, revealing aspects of a transition from Kaula practices to early Haṭhayoga. In the present essay I analyse, and partly edit, MaSaṃ chapter 40, in which a unique and somewhat ambiguous variant of a Śrīvidyā-type sexual ritual is described, and which Pro fessor Sanderson was kind enough to read with me in Oxford in 2005. I would like to dedicate this paper to him, offering new interpretations of some key ele ments, and thus updating my previous analysis (Kiss 2009, 66).1 

My approach is based on textual criticism: by restoring the text using four available manuscripts, I aim at giving an accurate translation and interpreta tion, which then enables me to draw some modest conclusions regarding the history of Śaivism around the thirteenth century.2 I would like to contribute to the contemporary research on Śaiva sexual rituals which focuses on their religio-historical importance. For although it is now generally acknowledged that sexual rituals are a distinctive feature of some of the Śaiva tantric tradi 

1 On the Ṣaḍanvayaśāmbhava tradition, see Sanderson 1988, 687; 2002, 2–3; 2014, 72–73, 76–77, 80. On details concerning the MaSaṃ, see Sanderson 2014, 80, Kiss 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2020 (forthcoming). All quotations from the MaSaṃ are either from Kiss 2020 (forthcoming) or from my draft edition of the text. 

2 I would definitely like to steer clear of some of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century, and contemporary approaches to the topic of tantric sexual rituals, which include, as White observes (2000, 4–5): (1) denial, (2) emphasis on the philosophical reinterpretation of these rites, “while generally denying the foundational importance of transgressivity or sexuality to the traditions themselves,” and (3) the commodification of New Age “Tantric Sex” as a com mercial product.

tions, much work remains to be done on this topic.3 Alongside Sanderson’sfind ings in many of his publications,4 as well as publications by Dupuche (2003), White (2003) and Biernacki (2007), Hatley’s work, especially on the asidhā rā̆vrata (Hatley 2018, 195–215), a sexual ritual attested in the Picumata/Brah mayāmala (BraYā), chapter 40, as well as in the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā and the Mataṅgapārameśvara, is fundamental and is a source of inspiration and in many respects a model for this essay. Mallinson’s exploration of the haṭhayogic techniques of khecarīmudrā, vajroli and amarolī is closely related to this field of research (Mallinson 2007, 221–223, notes 333–334 and 336–337). My own contri bution so far (Kiss 2015) comprises an analysis of the BraYā’s relevant teachings in BraYā 45 on sexual encounters that involve the gathering and magical use of sexual fluids. 

A detailed overview of the types of sexual ritual found in tantric and haṭha yogic texts is beyond the scope of this short essay,5 but a number of their dis tinctive features can be listed here. This list mainly concerns the variable nature of the female and male partners, and the nature of the sexual act. Note that cat egorisation of a phenomenon like this is greatly complicated by that fact that many features overlap: 

(1) sexual rituals involving restraint or celibacy;6 

(2) a sexual act at the end of which the practitioner applies the vajrolimu drā, “the practice of urethral suction […] to draw up the combined sexual fluids”;7 

(3) sexual rituals producing male and female sexual fluids, which are then used and consumed for magical purposes;8 

(4) sexual rituals with one’s own wife/partner vs. other partners;9 

3 As Shaman Hatley also remarks (2018, 195–196). 

4 E.g. Sanderson 2005a, 110–114, note 63; 2007, 284–287; 2009, 132ff., 294, note 699; and 2014, 57. 5 See a similarly non-comprehensive but more detailed list of types of tantric sexual rituals in Hatley 2018, 196–199. 

6 E.g. the asidhāravrata, “Razor’s Edge Observance,” as taught in BraYā 40, which involves sex ual contact with a beautiful woman without the sādhaka’s engaging in orgasm. (See Hatley 2018, 195–215.) See also BraYā 45.270–296ab, in which a sexual ritual involving“restraint” (ava graha) is taught (Kiss 2015, 49). 

7 See Mallinson (2007, 189 note 149). Vajroli is described e.g. in the Vaiṣṇava Dattātreyayogaśā stra, vv. 299–314. 

8 E.g. BraYā 45, where several variants of a basic type of sexual ritual are described (see Kiss 2015). 

9 See for example BraYā 24.32cd, where one’s mother, sister, daughter and wife are listed as pos sible partners (figuratively or otherwise): mātā ca bhaginī putrī bhāryā vai dūtayaḥ smṛtā[ḥ]. See also Jayaratha ad Tantrāloka 29.102 addressing the question after citing the line svapatnī bhaginī mātā duhitā vā śubhā sakhī: ityādyuktyā svapatny api atra kasmāt na parigaṇitā … (“In 
 

428 kiss 

(5) sexual rituals with one partner vs. several partners;10 

(6) sexual encounters with human or visionary Yoginīs, or other divine beings;11 

(7) highly æstheticized, philosophic descriptions of Śaiva sexual rituals;12 (8) sexual rituals involving the visualisation of a goddess or the mental pro jection of the image of a goddess onto the female partner,13 and so forth.14 The passages from MaSaṃ 40 analyzed and presented below seem to represent a variety of the last type listed above, but they are somewhat ambivalent: after mentioning sexual encounters with (human) Yoginīs (verses 38 and 40–41), the text focuses on a somewhat ambiguous sexual ritual which could be read either as involving an exclusively visualised goddess as partner or as prescribing the projection of an image of the goddess onto a human sexual partner. It also teaches the magical use of male sexual fluid (real or imaginary). MaSaṃ 40 is somewhat ambiguous in other aspects as well, and it seems that it is through the analysis of this ambiguity that we may gather clues concerning the his tory of late Śaiva traditions and the transition between Śaiva Tantra and early Haṭhayoga. 

2 Details and Ambiguities 

The beginning of the chapter in question, MaSaṃ 40.1–28, stands somewhat apart from the rest of the chapter and does not discuss sexual rituals. Never theless, a short analysis of it may be useful here. The text starts (1–6ab) with the proclamation of its topic: the rituals of Kula/Kaula conduct (kulācāravidhi) characterised by “the great non-dualist practice” (mahādvaita) and “freedom 

these kind of statements, why is one’s own wife not enumerated?”) See also Dupuche 2003, 249ff. 

10 E.g. BraYā 45.574cd–557ab, where sexual rituals with four to eight women are taught. See also Jayadrathayāmala, Ṣaṭka 4, National Archives, Kathmandu, MS 1–1468, ff. 206v3– 207v5 and Kṣemarāja’s Daśāvatāracarita 10.26. For these references, see Sanderson 2007, 284–287; and 2009, 294 note 699. 

11 E.g. the sādhaka engages in “great amusement” with Nāga girls and Āsurīs (demonesses) in BraYā 59.107cd (f. 254r): nāgakanyais mahākrīḍā āsurībhiś ca jāyate. 

12 E.g. Tantrāloka 29 (see Dupuche 2003). 

13 E.g. Nityotsava, p. 60: atha tāṃ devarūpāṃ vibhāvya … (“And visualising her [the sexual partner] in a godly form …”). 

14 This list could easily be expanded by using more variables, as Shaman Hatley has sug gested (personal communication): partners; place/space/circumstances; roles of mantra, visualization, accoutrements; kinds of meaning given to the practice; aims/goals; fluids; etc.

from conventional practices” (nirācāra), both familiar terms from earlier Śaiva tantras such as the BraYā.15 Verses 6cd–16 praise and recommend ritual bathing at a special śivatīrtha, in “Śiva’s water” or “water embodying Śiva” (śivamaye 

jale). In the context of the MaSaṃ, it is very probable that what is meant here is bathing in or with, and consuming, urine or other bodily fluids. Mallinson (2007, 221–223, notes 333–334, 336–337) has shown convincingly that the prac tice of bathing with urine was not unknown in Kāpālika and haṭhayogic tradi tions.16 On the other hand, in light of the second half of the chapter, it is not inconceivable that semen is what is hinted at here. In either case, the appli cation of this magical fluid involves transgression and thus should be carried out in a secret place (16cd). Verse 18 names the miraculous fluid as amarī, a term echoed in MaSaṃ 27.5 as amarīrasa. That chapter, MaSaṃ 27, teaches concoctions of herbs and physical secrations such as fæces, urine, menstrual blood, phlegm (?) and semen (?) (viṅ-mūtra-rajo-recaka-sārakāḥ) associated with Lokeśa, Keśava, Rudra, Īśa and Sadeśvara, respectively (27.2, see Mallinson [2007, 220 note 328]). In MaSaṃ 27.5a Sadāśiva (i.e. probably Sadeśvara, or rather the substance associated with him, probably semen) is said to be the best among them (sadāśivo varo jñeyas). This may indicate that the meaning of amarī (and sudhā, amṛta etc.) is flexible; it may refer not only to urine, but to other bodily fluids as well. Amarī should be drunk after reciting the appro priate mantra and should be massaged on one’s body (27.21–26ab), similarly to what is taught in MaSaṃ 40.64–65, where it is clearly semen. 

The second part of our chapter, MaSaṃ 40.29ff., commences to further describe kulācāra, and claims that sexual rituals should be performed either with Yoginīs or with Māyā-type women (verse 38). Here follows an edition and translation of verses 29–38: 

[kulācāranirṇayam]17 

ataḥ paraṃ śṛṇu śive kulācārasya nirṇayam | 

samprāpya siddhasaṃtānaṃ guruṃ daivaṃ sadā yajet ||40.29|| 

15 E.g. BraYā 3.227, 45.159 and Kubjikāmatatantra 2.107 etc. 

16 In a similar fashion, the BraYā (e.g. in 45.427 and 45.456) prescribes the praise of urine to be performed by the sādhaka. 

17 This edition of MaSaṃ 40.1–69 is based on four manuscripts: Ja, Jb, Jc, Well (see the bibli ography; Jd is not available for chapter 40). The transcription of the text of the MaSaṃ both in the textus acceptus and in reporting variants involves some inevitable falsifi cation, of which the most important are the following: I have not always attempted to report differences in readings between akṣaras that are usually interchangable in MSS (b-v,

[The exposition of Kula Conduct] 

After this, O Śivā, hear the exposition of the Kula Conduct (kulācāra). After he has joined the tradition of the Siddhas, he should worship his guru as divine. (40.29) 

The yogin who is engaged in the worship of his guru can obtain the highest Power (siddhi). The guru’s bedstead, his bedding, clothes, ornaments, sandals, parasol, antilope-skin, bowl or anything else: if he touches any of these with his feet, he should place them on his head and recite [mantras] eight times. (40.30–31) 

If he sees anybody who is abusing the guru, he should beat him or [at least] curse him. Or, if he is unable [to do so], he should leave the place. (40.32) 

He should not ridicule the worship of the [Yoginī] clans (kulapūjā), or despise yogins or yoginīs, women when they are intoxicated, or nour ished,18 or the wine-pot, or Śiva, or the guru. (40.33) 

Contempt [for these] will make him fall immediately here in this world and in the other world, O Pārvatī. He should not follow the path of the paśus [i.e. that of the uninitiated] and he should not long for the leftover of paśus. (40.34) 

He should strive for an encounter (melana) with the Yoginīs. He should not have sex (na seveta) with uninitiated women (paśustrī).19 He 

18 Perhaps: “pregnant.” Alternatively, some kind of sexual interpretation is needed here. 19 See 40.38. 
 

432 kiss 

should not give leftovers to the uninitiated (paśu). He should never abuse women. (40.35) 

He should treat [all phenomena] as one, not as separate.20 He should not drink [alcohol] or eat meat idly [with no ritual purpose]. 

(40.36) 

He should not drink wine without first purifying it [with mantras], and he should consume meat after he has purified it with that [wine]. He should not answer the call of nature, should not sip water, etc., while reciting mantras or in an assembly.21 If he does so out of folly, the 

curse of the Yoginīs will fall on him. (40.37) 

When ( yat) [the yogin] wants to enjoy (bhuñjīyāt) a woman, O Goddess, visualising himself as Śiva [and her as] Śakti,22 he should always have sex with a Yoginī or with a Māyā [type of woman], and never with a Pāśavī [i.e. a paśu-natured woman, or more precisely someone who has not been initiated]. (40.38) 

Noteworthy among the above are verse 31, which is more or less parallel with Kubjikāmatatantra 3.133cd–134ab, reconfirming that the cult of the MaSaṃ draws heavily on the Paścimāmnāya;23 verse 33, which warns against the abuse of women; and verse 35, which seems to mention only Yoginīs (recommended for sexual encounters) and uninitiated women (not recommended), and seems to be silent on any other category, in contrast to verse 38, inwhich the third type, Māyā, first appears. 

The subsequent verses, 40 and 41, define a Yoginī: she follows the Kula path, is initiated, uses alcohol in her rituals, and generally gives the impression of being a human female practitioner. Rather awkwardly, the text does not give any other detail, but goes on defining her antithesis, the Pāśavī: an uninitiated woman, who is hostile to Śaivism and who should be avoided (41cd–42). 

A sexual ritual with the third type, Māyā, is what the rest of the text focuses on. It is here that major ambiguities come into the picture. The key aspects mentioned in the description of the Māyā-type woman are: she has all the 

20 I suspect that here the principles of non-hesitation (nirvikalpa) and freedom from conven tional practices (nirācāra) are being reaffirmed: the practitioner should not distinguish between right and wrong, pure and impure etc. See 40.1–28. 

21 The interpretation of mantragoṣṭhīṣu is highly tentative. 

22 The compound śivaśaktyātmabhāvayā (conj.; °bhāvaya JaJc, °bhāvaye Jb, °bhāvayaṃWell) is rather unusual, and my conjecture is insecure. Perhaps °bhāvayā stands for bhāvanayā metri causa. The intended meaning seems to be clear, though.

auspicious characteristics required (sarvalakṣaṇasampannā), has neitherrūpa nor kula (kularūpavivarjitā),24 and is to be approached by bhāva (bhāvagamyā, 40.43).25 All of these terms remain rather ambiguous without the help of clar ification based upon other passages. Here follows the text and translation of this section:

24 That kula and rūpa are to be understood as a dvandva compound is confirmed in 40.44ab: yā māyā rūparahitā kulahīnā maheśvara. 

25 Elsewhere I have argued (Kiss 2009, 57–60) that while bhāva in the MaSaṃ is mostly to be interpreted as “visualisation,” which is a rather common meaning for this word, an additional specification may be required: bhāva refers to a particularly emotive process of creating mental images. I suspect that bhāva is preferred in the MaSaṃ to dhyāna (although dhyāna, dhyāyet etc. also abound) for its extremely wide range of meanings. One of the basic meanings of bhāva is “being, becoming.” Another is “emotion, sentiment” or even “passion, love.” I think that all these rather different senses of the word are con densed in the yogic key term of bhāva in the MaSaṃ. It is a creation of something in the mind by the yogin, towards which he should also create a feeling, an empathic attitude, perhaps passionate devotion, which will result in the ultimate condition, the desired state of mind: the union with the object, with the deity, with Śiva, or in our case, with a visu alised goddess.

[Yoginī, Māyā and Pāśavī] 

Devī spoke: 

O God, what kind of a woman is a Yoginī? Who is Māyā and who is Pāśavī? Tell me, O Bhairava, the pros and cons of having sex with them. (40.39) 

Bhairava spoke: 

A woman who is on the Kula Path [of the Yoginī clans] (kulamārga), who avoids the path of bound souls (paśumārga) [i.e. the path of the uninitiated], who is elevated by intoxication induced by liquor, and is free of the bonds that fetter the soul (paśupāśa), and whose mind is filled with the bliss of wine (madirā), is [called] a Yoginī in Śiva’s teaching. (40.40–41ab) 

[Pāśavī:] her mental attitude is dishonest, she is wicked, hostile to Kaula Practice (kulācāra). She tends to abuse Śiva, O Goddess, and to obstruct his worship. This [type], the Pāśavī, has been [now] 

taught by me. O Suvratā, hear the one that is called Māyā. (40.41cd– 42) 

A woman who possesses all favourable characteristics (lakṣaṇa) [but] has neither a [Yoginī] Clan/noble family (kula) nor a [human/mate rial] form/beauty (rūpa), and who is to be approached by empathic imagination (bhāva), O Maheśānī, is called Māyā. (40.43) 

The termrūpa in 43b may refer to“material form” and a lack of rūpawould then indicate that Māyā, the preferred sexual partner, is solely imaginary. In this case sarvalakṣaṇasampannā indicates that she is to be visualised as a divine being with great beauty. But how to interpret “devoid of kula” then? The term kula is 
 

a sexual ritual with māyā in matsyendrasaṃhitā 40 435 

often used in the sense of “a clan of Yoginīs.”26 Is she then not a member of any Yoginī clan? Does she transcend the clans of Yoginīs, being the supreme God dess?27 This interpretation is supported and at the same time refuted by MaSaṃ 22.24 (which in fact is a citation of Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava, alias Vāmakeśvarīmata, 4.14): 

kulayoṣit kulaṃ tyaktvā paraṃ puruṣam eti sā | 

nirlakṣyaṃ28 nirguṇaṃ caiva kularūpavivarjitam ||22.24||29 

That noble lady abandons her family (kula) and goes to the highest man, who is invisible, who lacks qualities, and is devoid of kula and form. 

Here, in the MaSaṃ as well as the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava, the supreme soul (paraṃ puruṣam) is described as having neither kula nor rūpa: as being imma terial and formless.30 But the word kula is used in a double sense in the case of the female subject of the sentence (kuṇḍalinī in fact): she leaves her/the body to unite with the Supreme Soul as a noble lady (kulayoṣit) leaves her family (kulaṃ tyaktvā) to unite with her husband. This does not make it eas ier to interpret MaSaṃ 40.43b (kularūpavivarjitā): the sexual partner might be a woman who was not born in an eminent family, i.e. is of low birth (kula vivarjitā), and who lacks beauty (rūpavivarjitā), “beauty” being a natural way 

26 See e.g. Sanderson (1988, 671–672): “All Yoginīs belong to the family (kula) or lineage (gotra) of one or other of a number of ‘higher’ maternal powers, and in any instance this parentage is ascribed on the evidence of certain physical and behavioural characteris tics. An adept in the cult of Yoginīs can identify members of as many as sixty-three of these occult sisterhoods, but is most vitally concerned with the eight major families of the Mothers (mātṛ) Brāhmī, Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Indrāṇī, Vārāhī, Cāmuṇḍā and Mahālakṣmī.” See also Hatley (2007, 13–23, 33, 392, etc.). 

27 Cf. Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, vol. I, sv. akula: “Dans les traditions (āmnāya*) du Kula, c’est la Réalité lumineuse suprême, l’absolu inconditionné: anuttaraṃ paraṃ dhāma tad evāku lam ucyate(Tantrāloka 3.143ab),” etc.

This is the meaning [of this verse].”) 
 

436 kiss 

of translating rūpa. In this case, sarvalakṣaṇasampannā (40.43a) refers to the form she assumes during the yogin’s visualisation, and bhāvagamyā (40.43) may suggest that a sexual ritual with her requires this visualisation. Alterna tively, the ideal sexual partner might be one who is immaterial and formless (kularūpavivarjitā): a visualised goddess, or, as a matter of fact, kuṇḍalinī. As we have seen, in the context of the yogin’s sexual rituals, first two, then three types of partners are enumerated: one, who is hostile to Śaivism, is to be avoided; initiated human Yoginīs are ideal, but are not dwelt upon in the text, perhaps because they were less and less available at the time of the composition of the MaSaṃ; and as a third alternative, the text either suggests pure visualisation or an uninitiated woman of low birth, without any particular charm, as the locus of visualisation of the Goddess. 

The text goes on to give instructions on visualisation needed for the sexual ritual. The yogin should visualise himself as Śiva in the form of Kāmeśvara, and his partner as a goddess:

[Sexual ritual with Māyā] 

The Goddess spoke: 

Tell me, O Maheśvara, how should the yogin sexually approach the one who is called Māyā, who has neither form/beauty (rūpa) nor a clan/noble family/body (kula)? (40.44) 

Bhairava spoke: 

Listen to me, O Goddess, I shall teach you the extraordinary intercourse (saṃga) with Māyā. It is fruitful, O Maheśānī, and difficult to learn 
 

by others and yogins without yogic Powers (siddhi), O Suranāyakī. (40.45–46ab)

[Visualisation of Parameśvara] 

In a hidden sanctuary, the mantra master should sit on a soft cushion31 and should visualise himself as having the body of Parameśvara, as if 

31 The element °parigrahaḥ in the compund mṛdvāsanaparigrahaḥ is suspicious. A word meaning “seated” would fit the context better. 
 

438 kiss 

[he were transformed into] Kāmeśvara,32 having no beginning and no end, shining like millions of suns. (40.46cd–47) 

He is adorned with nice anklets, armlets, rings and bracelets, and he shines with small toe rings (mudrikā),33 channahīras,34 etc., and 

diadems and a crown. (40.48) 

His face is gracious, beautiful, his lips are smeared with betel leaves. His mind is filled with the joy of wine,35 and his body is supreme bliss [itself]. (40.49) 

He is in the prime of his youth and has all the auspicious characteristics. He has the great Ajagava36 bow placed on his left side. (40.50) 

On his right, he has five glowing arrows. He is shining like a blue lotus. On his chest there is a glittering garland of blue lotuses. He is the Lord. (40.51) 

His heart is agitated with sexual desire. His lotus face displays a faint smile.37 This is how the yogin should visualise his body for a long time, as transformed into Śiva. (40.52) 

All his limbs are perfumed with sandal, aloe, camphor, musk38 and saf fron. He has a beautiful face. (40.53) 

He is surrounded by millions of gem islands, in a chamber on a fine bed.39 (40.54ab) 

32 Note that Kāmeśvara features as Śiva or the central deity in the pre-Śrīvidyā Dakṣiṇām nāya tradition, with which the MaSaṃ is clearly affiliated. See Sanderson (1988, 688), and Kiss (2009, 18 and 42–43). 

33 This is somewhat tentative. See mudrikā as an ornament in Brahmayāmala 21.63cd: mudrikām aṅguliś caiva pādau laktakarañjitau (Kiss 2015, 219). 

34 A channahīra, or rather a channavīra, is made up of two sacred threads ( yajñopavīta) worn over the two shoulders and across the chest. Bunce (1997) provides two definitions: “Channavira–(Ind.: channa-vīra) A Hindu iconographic object for bodily adornment. The term channavira refers to a chain worn by both male and female deities. It is made up of two chains crossed over the chest, a disc covers the front crossing” (Bunce 1997, 58). “The term chhannavira refers to two sacred cords similar to yajñopavita. One is placed over each shoulder, crossing on the chest and back and looping as low as the hips” (Bunce 1997, 63). See also Rao 1914, vol. 1.2, xxxi (Addenda), where it is defined as a double yajñopavīta. See channavīra mentioned in e.g. Rauravāgama, Kriyāpāda 10.52d. 

35 Note that here intoxication is something only to be visualised. 

36 Note that mahājagava is a rather insecure conjecture for mahadaikṣava and mahavai vakṣa. Other variants of the name of Śiva’s bow are ajakava and ajīkava. 

37 Note the slightly odd form īṣāsmita° metri causa for the standard īṣadasmita°. 38 I take kuraṅgajaya in the sense of “musk,” although I have not found any evidence for this compound being used instead of the well-known kuraṅganābhi. 

39 I am grateful to Harunaga Isaacson for his assistance with this passage.

[Visualisation of Śakti] 

On his left side, [he should visualise] Śakti, who infatuates the world. (40.54cd) 

She has all the auspicious characteristics. She is in the prime of her youth. She has bees longing for the garland tied in her black locks. (40.55) 

The tilaka-mark on her forehead is made with musk thickened with camphor. She has lotus-eyes. She is adorned with rings, armlets, 

anklets, necklaces etc. (40.56) 

Her beautiful lotus face resembles the spotless moon. Her mouth is filled with betel. Her breasts are like golden jars. (40.57) 
 

440 kiss 

She is anointed with divine ointments and she is dressed in divine clothes, with her loins exposed.40 Her thighs and shanks are beau tiful. Her body is the ultimate essence of gracefulness. (40.58) 

Her feet are embellished41 with anklets. She wears divine garlands and [has been anointed] with divine ointments. She is delighted by the wine she is enjoying. Her body is filled with passion. She is restless with wantonness. [This is how the yogin] should visualise his lover (kāntā) as Śakti, O Maheśvarī. (40.59–60ab) 

The appearance of Kāmeśvara and the mention of a gem-island (ratnadvīpa) in the above verses suggest an affiliation with the Śrīvidyā tradition and with love magic, perhaps with that of the pre-Śrīvidyā Dakṣiṇāmnāya tradition.42 Verse 46cd (“in a hidden sanctuary”) may also be revealing: if the whole ritual were purely imaginary, it would be less important to perform it in a secret place. 

Going further in our text, MaSaṃ 40.60cd–68 may also suggest that a real sexual encounter is being described by using words such as āśliṣya (“embrac ing”), samācaret (“he should perform”), bahiḥ (“outwardly”), kṣipet (“place [his hand]”), vimuñcati (“ejaculates”), by giving instructions in 40.61 to stimulate the partner, and also by avoiding words that would refer to visualisation, except dhyāne, probably hinting at the fact that the whole process is accompanied by a projection of the image of the Goddess onto the female partner. On the other hand, the formulation of verse 40.65 may cast some doubt upon the real-life presence of the female partner: the yogin should rub his semen on his body, and there is no mention of the female partner’s sexual fluids or her receiving or consuming any of the magical mixture, a common practice in Śaiva sexual rituals.43 Here follows the end of the chapter, describing the sexual ritual: 

40 Ex em. Compare Kauṇḍinya’s commentary ad Pāśupatasūtra 1.9 (p. 14): adhomukhenā daṃṣṭreṇa jaghanāntaracāriṇā | sarvaśāstrācikitsyena jagad daṣṭaṃ bhagāhinā ||, which is translated by Hara (1966, 196) as “The world is bitten by a snake whose mouth is below, toothless, who has crawled between the loins and whose poison can be cured by no sci ence. Its name is the vulva.” The passage can also interpreted as “The world is bitten by the snake of the vagina whose toothless mouth points downward, and who moves in the genital area, and for which there is no antidote.” 

41 I have translated añcita as “embellished,” suspecting that the word may need some emen dation (aṅkita/rañjita?). 

42 See Sanderson 1988, 688–689 and 2009, 47ff. 

43 See e.g. BraYā 45.201–202ab (Kiss 2015, 142, 258): upaviśyāpayet tatra cumbanādyāvagūha nam | kṛtvā kṣobhaṃ samārabhya pavitraṃ gṛhya sādhakaḥ || prāśayitvā tu tau hṛṣṭau yāgadravyāṇi prokṣayet |. “The Sādhaka should make [her] sit down there. He should start kissing and embracing her and stimulating her. He should collect the purifying [substance, i.e. the sexual fluids]. Overjoyed, they should consume [the fluids] …”

442 kiss [The intercourse] 

The yogin should embrace and kiss her, etc., properly. (40.60cd) 

[Then] he should have sex with her outwardly, very gently, while 

[performing] visualisation. He should apply the “elephant trunk” [method]44 on her divine love temple [i.e. her genitalia]. (40.61) 

The yogin should recall this mantra when he ejaculates: Bhautika [ai], Vyoman [h], […], tu verbatim and Bhautika [ai; i.e. hraiṃ tvaiṃ].45 (40.62) 

Moreover: Vahni [r] and Vāmākṣi [ī] with a Bindu [ṃ; i.e. rīṃ], O Mah eśvarī, the words cale and cala and immediately citre [citte?], (40.63) 

the word reto, muñca twice,46 and the previous seed-mantras back wards [rīṃ tvaiṃ hraiṃ]. The yogin who has had sex with Māyā should rub his semen mixed with gold, camphor and saffron on his own body: [his] beauty will become moon-like. (40.64–65) 

He should dry brahmamaṇḍūkī47 together with its roots in the shade. He should mix it with grape-juice, candied sugar and ghee. (40.66) He should have it three times [a day] for three months in portions mea suring a dice as food and drink and he should drink milk. His semen will not deteriorate in millions of years if he practises sex [with 

Māyā]. His [semen] will never ever wane. It is for the rejuvenation of the body, O Priyā. (40.67–68) 

This is the secret of alchemy. He should not reveal it to others. This secret of the Siddha tradition, which is difficult to obtain, has now been taught. It is to be revealed through the compassion of the guru. What else do you wish to hear? (40.69) 

Here ends the fortieth chapter of the Matsyendrasaṃhitā. 

44 See p. 443 below. 

45 If the decoding of this mantra in the marginalia in f. 64r of MS Ja (top, hraiṃ tvaiṃ rīṃ cate vata citte reto muñca 2 rīṃ klaiṃ hraiṃ) is more or less correct, the puzzling syllables lā aiṃḍi must stand for r. Note the slight differences between the code in the text and the mantra given in the marginalia. The reconstruction of the mantra is somewhat tentative. 

46 See Kaulāvalīnirṇaya 5.51: amukīṃ drāvaya svāhā vinyaset sādhakottamaḥ | vāmāyā[?] capalacitte reto muñcadvayaṃ paṭhet.

a sexual ritual with māyā in matsyendrasaṃhitā 40 443 

Rubbing one’s own semen on one’s body (verse 65) is an old custom, and was probably not considered a transgressive practice at all. Bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad 6.4.4–5 describe a practice to be followed in case one discharges semen: 

bahu vā idaṃ suptasya vā jāgrato vā retaḥ skandati || 6.4.4 || 

tad abhimṛśed anu vā mantrayeta—yan me ’dya retaḥ pṛthivīm 

askāntsīd yad oṣadhīr apy asarad yad apaḥ | idam ahaṃ tad reta 

ādade | punar mām aitu indriyaṃ punas tejaḥ punar bhagaḥ | punar agnir dhiṣṇyā yathāsthānaṃ kalpantām | ity anāmikāṅguṣṭhābhyām ādāyāntareṇa stanau vā bhruvau vā nimṛjyāt ||6.4.5|| 

In Hume’s translation (1921, 168–169): 

“[If] even this much semen is spilled, whether of one asleep or of one awake, [5] then he should touch it, or [without touching] repeat:— ‘What semen has of mine to earth been spilt now, 

Whate’er to herb has flowed, whate’er to water— 

Again to me let vigour come! 

Again, my strength; again, my glow! 

Again the altars and the fire 

Be found in their accustomed place!’ 

Having spoken thus, he should take it with ring-finger and thumb and rub it on between his breasts or his eye-brows.”48 

As can be seen from this passage, semen was probably never considered so impure as to forbid its magical application on the body, and this practice was recommended to regain strength—exactly as in MaSaṃ 40.68 (navatvāptyai tanoḥ). The question is inevitable: is the somewhat similar practice in MaSaṃ 40.65 recommended for a similar situation, namely for ejaculation in a state of mind comparable to sleep, i.e. visualisation? Does this similarity between the two instructions suggest the absence of the female partner in the MaSaṃ? 

To return to 40.61cd, where stimulation of the partner is probably hinted at: this gives the instruction to “cast an ‘elephant trunk’ on the partner’s divine love temple” (gajahastaṃ kṣipet tasyāḥ śrīmanmadanamandire). This again is ambiguous. Gajahasta could be a mudrā to be shown during the ritual,49 

48 I find Olivelle’s translation (1996, 88) slightly less accurate at this point, although the dif ferences are minor. 

49 See e.g. Kaulāvalīnirṇaya 17.133–135ab: eṣā tu paramā mudrā sarvasaṅkṣobhaṇī matā |

but could as well be the technique mentioned in Jaśodhara’s commentary ad Kāmasūtra 7.2.2: 

ratasyopakrame sambādhasya kareṇopamardanaṃ tasyā rasaprāptikāle ca ratayojanam iti rāgapratyānayanam | 

Commentary: ratasyeti | samprayogasya upakrama iti | ayam ārambhe, yady api mando rāgo rate pravartayati stabdhaliṅgatvāt, tathāpi pratha mataḥ sambādhasya bhagasya kareṇopamardanaṃ gajahastena kṣobha ṇaṃ kāryaṃ … 

[When you are] about to practise sex, [first you should] rub her genitalia with your hand, and when there is dampness, the sexual act can be com menced. This is the restoration of passion. 

Commentary: “about to practice sex”: at the beginning of the sexual act. This is at the start [of the sexual act]. Even if the passion is weak with regards to sex because the penis is inert, first “her genitalia,” i.e. her vulva, should be rubbed with his hand, should be stimulated with the “elephant trunk” [method] … 

The possible hint in MaSaṃ 40.61cd at a Kāmaśāstric technique again suggests that we are dealing with the description of a sexual ritual involving a human female partner. Or should this also be only visualised? 

3 Why All These Ambiguities? 

I think it is safe to say that the teaching of MaSaṃ 40 is ambiguous to an extent that makes it rather difficult to decide on one or another exclusive interpretation. The question to answer is rather: why is it so ambiguous? Is it deliberately so? Is it so due to bad writing, to sloppy composition? Are essen tial details left out because they were well-known to gurus and pupils at the time of composition of the text? Did revisions/insertions during the course of transmission cause the ambiguity (deliberately or accidentally)? Is the text 

kṣobhayed athavā mantrī gajahastākhyamudrayā || adhomukhaṃ dakṣapāṇiṃ nidhāyā ṅguṣṭhake same | niḥkṣiped aṅgulīḥ sarvā gajatuṇḍākṛtir yathā || gajahastā mahāmudrā kathitā siddhidāyikā |.

ambiguous because of the uncertainty of its redactors, i.e. they were rephras ing old teachings but were not sure of the details? Is this ambiguity the result of the redactors’ diffidence in expressing secret teachings on sexuality? Could this ambiguity be seen as indicative of some major change in the tradition? 

The first possibility, namely that the text is ambiguous deliberately, would imply that the author(s) or redactor(s) wanted to hide their secret teaching from unauthorised eyes. This is possible but not as typical as one would think. For instance, while they are difficult for the modern reader to decipher, the BraYā’s radical teachings on sexual ritual are relatively straightforward con cerning what is real and what is imaginary, and while there are technical terms which are not openly discussed in the text,50 and its language is far from being standard Pāṇinian Sanskrit, it is generally possible to understand how sexual rituals were supposed to be performed. 

The next possibility hinted at above, i.e. the effect of bad writing, is possible, but the MaSaṃ is far from being a very cryptic or confused text. It would have required minimal effort and ability on behalf of the redactors to clarify details that we miss: a few lines on how to acquire or invite a Māyā woman, similar to the BraYā’s instructions on finding a partner,51 a verse on her role and position during the ritual, or a clear remark stipulating the yogin’s solitude would have been enough. 

On the other hand, one should not forget that texts like the MaSaṃ were definitely not written with an outsider reader in mind who would try to under stand them several hundred years later. Essential details could have been left out because they were obvious to the redactors. 

As regards possible revisions and insertions, there are signs that MaSaṃ 40 is made up of at least three distinct parts. Verses 40.1–28 constitute a small chap ter in themselves with weak links to the rest of the chapter. What they have in common is the mention of “Kaula conduct” and bodily fluids. 40.29–37 and the rest of the chapter are more closely related. Both mention and discuss sex ual rituals, but the first section, while mentioning sex with Yoginīs, is silent on Māyā, the focus of the second part, i.e. verses 40.38–69, which seem as if they were an alternative and additional teaching. But this additional section may again be made up of passages drawn from various sources. The visualisation of Kāmeśvara and his partner (40.46cd–60ab) may come from a source dif ferent from that of the instructions on the sexual act itself, and this in itself would provide some explanation for discrepancies in the text. The text may 

50 E.g. the term avagraha (“restraint”) or pīṭha (“external genital organ of the female part ner”). See Kiss 2015, 49, 47–48.

446 kiss 

have originally described a sexual ritual with a human partner, but during the transmission of the text some passages teaching new ideas (such as a visualised partner) were inserted, thus making the text ambiguous. 

This may lead us to another possibility, namely that at some point the redac tors of the text became uncertain of the exact details of the ritual and when they tried to solve the problem they may have ended up obscuring it even further. Finally, the possibility of diffidence may also have played some role, especially if the female partner was meant to be purely imaginary, but other details of the ritual were not. 

It seems that a wider perspective may be required to see what this chapter of the MaSaṃ signifies. The ambiguity between actual sex and visualisation in chapter 40 may have its roots in the tension between sexuality and asceti cism which is clearly manifest in the frame story of the text (chapters 1 and 55). The frame story contains a unique version of the legend of Matsyendra and Gorakṣa: Matsyendra occupies the body of a dead king and indulges in sensual pleasures. It is Gorakṣa, his disciple, who “rescues” Matsyendra from the trap of sexuality and power, and leads him back to an ascetic life.52 Taking into account this wider context, it is possible to discover the same tension in the teaching of MaSaṃ 40 between a sexual ritual that may have originated in an earlier tantric strata of the cult, and its probably later haṭhayogic layers. 

As I suggest elsewhere,53 the MaSaṃ could provide clues about the transi tion of a tantric cult from Kaula practices, often involving transgressive ele ments, to early Haṭhayoga, often associated with brahmacārin practitioners. The text may be echoing or quoting old tantric texts with such descriptions of sexual rituals that aim at obtaining sexual fluids, but the redactors of the MaSaṃ were perhaps in a transition towards more ascetic or brahmacaryā oriented teachings, and as a result, they come up with a fairly obscure variant of the figure of the tantric Yoginī: Māyā, first described as only a phantom, resem bles the wholly mental visualisation of goddesses, but at the same time takes part in a human sexual ritual. The redactors may have had reservations about a sexual ritual with a low-caste woman, and tried to conceal this with instruc tions on visualisation to such an extent that even the presence of a human part ner is now doubtful. They may also have had kuṇḍalinī in their thoughts: the 

52 See Kiss 2009, 222–233 and 317–321. 

53 Kiss 2009, 9: “[…] the MaSaṃ provides some clues for, among other things, the under standing of the transition from the early Indian yoga traditions (Pātañjala and Śaiva) to the late and fully developed haṭha-yogic teachings as well as of the transition from the early Kula traditions to the later Kaula teachings associated with the figure of Matsyen dra.” 
 

text as it stands now could be a metaphor for meditation on her. The manner in which they reconcile two (or three) attitudes, in this case those of explicit sexu ality and of brahmacārin yogins’ mental worship of a goddess (or of kuṇḍalinī), is, as so often in tantric texts, less than convincing. But this imperfection, this ambiguity, is exactly the feature which seems to tell us something about the history of the cult, its transition from one phase to another.

### 19 Haṭhayoga’s Floruit on the Eve of Colonialism Jason Birch 

My doctoral thesis (Birch 2013), which was supervised by Alexis Sanderson at the University of Oxford, contained a survey of texts on Haṭha- and Rājayoga. One of the challenges of completing such a survey was that very few of the texts composed from the sixteenth to eighteenth century had been critically edited or studied academically. Inspired by several exemplary surveys of Śaiva litera ture in Sanderson’s articles (e.g. 2001, 2007 and 2014),I visited a large number of libraries in India in an effort to consult manuscripts of unpublished yoga texts. By the end of my doctorate, it was apparent to me that yoga texts composed on the eve of colonialism provided new insights into the history of yoga and, more specifically, are crucial for understanding how Haṭhayoga changed after it had been codified by Svātmārāma in the Haṭhapradīpikā (circa mid-fifteenth cen tury). In fact, after Svātmārāma had successfully transformed Haṭhayoga from an auxiliary practice into a complete soteriological system, there began what might be considered the floruit of Haṭhayoga, insofar as its literature flour ished, its systems of practice accumulated more techniques and it became, particularly in scholarly compendiums on yoga, almost synonymous with the auxiliaries of āsana and prāṇāyāma. 

Building on my doctoral research, this article aims to provide a framework for examining the textual sources of Haṭhayoga that were composed from the sixteenth to eighteenth century. After a brief summary of the early literature of Haṭhayoga, I shall discuss some of the salient features of the late literature by dividing the texts into two etic categories; ‘extended works’ and ‘compendi ums.’ The extended works expatiate on Haṭhayoga as it was formulated in the Haṭhapradīpikā, whereas the compendiums integrate teachings of Haṭhayoga within a discourse on yoga more broadly conceived. Both categories include scholarly and practical works which, when read together in this way, reveal sig nificant changes to both practical and theoretical conceptions of Haṭhayoga. Such a reading also illuminates several developments of this time that fore shadowed, and in some cases inspired, the transnational yogas of the twentieth century. The article concludes with a brief discussion on the regional extent of the literature on Haṭhayoga during this period and how the codification of its praxis and theory appears to have diverged in different regions.

452 birch 1 Conceptions of Haṭhayoga before the Haṭhapradīpikā 

The earliest references to the term haṭhayoga are found in some Buddhist Tantras, most notably the Guhyasamājatantra and the Kālacakratantra, which date to the eighth and eleventh centuries, respectively, and mention it as a method of last resort when the primary techniques of these traditions had failed (Birch 2011, 541–542). An eleventh-century commentary on the Kāla cakratantra, called theVimalaprabhā, explains the termhaṭhayoga as the name of a type of yoga that forces prāṇa (‘vitality’) into the central channel through a practice involving nāda (‘internal resonance’) and retention of bindu (‘gen erative fluids’). The earliest known Śaiva work to teach Haṭhayoga is the circa twelfth-century Amaraughaprabodha (Birch 2019). Its Haṭhayoga is somewhat consistent with that of the Kālacakra tradition insofar as both are auxiliary practices that induce nāda. Nonetheless, a much closer counterpart to the Amaraughaprabodha’s Haṭhayoga exists in an eleventh-century Vajrayāna work called the Amṛtasiddhi (Mallinson 2020). Both have similar accounts of three complex mudrās and a system of sounds (nāda), blisses (ānanda) and voids (śūnya). It is important to note that the author of the Amṛtasiddhi does not identify its yoga as Haṭhayoga. The reason for this is not stated in the text, but Haṭhayoga appears to have been a controversial practice among some Bud dhist exegetes,1 and it is also possible that Haṭhayoga, or at the very least some of its techniques of that time, had older associations with other religious tradi tions.2 

Unlike earlier Buddhist works, Haṭhayoga in the Amaraughaprabodha is embedded in a fourfold hierarchy in which Rājayoga is the principal yoga. Rājayoga is defined as the absence of mental activity,3 a meditative state that was known by this name in other Śaiva yoga texts of the same era.4 In this hierarchy, Haṭhayoga was not the sole means to Rājayoga, because the latter could also be achieved by Mantra- and Layayoga. Judging by later works, such 

1 On Maitreyanātha’s and Rāmapāla’s rejection of Haṭhayoga, see Isaacson and Sferra 2014, and Mallinson, forthcoming 2020. 

2 On the prehistory of certain techniques which were integrated into Haṭhayoga, see Mallinson 2016, 120–122. In the case of the three physical techniques taught in the Amṛtasiddhi and the Amaraughaprabodha, it seems possible to me that the Amaraughaprabodha may have bor rowed from a source that was older than the Amṛtasiddhi (Birch 2019, 964–966) and that the physical practices themselves were not the preserve of esoteric Buddhists. 

3 Amaraughaprabodha 3d ( yaś cittavṛttirahitaḥ sa tu rājayogaḥ). 

4 The earliest work to teach Rājayoga by name is the Amanaska, which can be dated to the eleventh or early twelfth century (Birch 2014, 406–409). In nearly all texts that teach Haṭhayoga, Rājayoga is mentioned as the goal of Haṭhayoga. 
 

haṭhayoga’s floruit 453 

as the Śivasaṃhitā (5.13–28), which explain the rationale behind this hierarchy, it appears that the characteristics of the student were the basis for determining which yoga was taught to an individual, and it seems likely that Mantra-, Laya and Haṭhayoga were superfluous to students of extraordinary capability who could achieve Rājayoga without an auxiliary practice.5 

The praxis common to both the yoga of the Amṛtasiddhi and the Haṭhayoga of the Amaraughaprabodha is three techniques called mahāmudrā, mahā bandha and mahāvedha. A repertoire larger than this rudimentary one appears in all systems of Haṭhayoga that followed, such as that of the Dattātreyayo gaśāstra (circa 13th-century), a Vaiṣṇava work in which a collection of ten mudrās, referred to as the Haṭhayoga of Kapila, was integrated with a Vai ṣṇava form of aṣṭāṅgayoga attributed to Yājñavalkya.6 Kapila’s collection of mudrās consists of khecarī, viparītakaraṇī, the three bandha (“locks”), and three variations of vajrolimudrā, in addition to mahāmudrā, mahābandha and mahāvedha. Combinations of some of these mudrās appear in contemporary Śaiva works, such as the Yogatārāvalī and the Yogabīja,7 which teach basic sys tems of Haṭhayoga. The latter text is known for its definition of Haṭhayoga as the union of the sun and moon, which are represented by the syllables ha and ṭha, respectively. This definition is absent from the earliest recension of the Yogabīja, which simply defined Haṭhayoga as forcefully consuming the gross elements of the body.8 

Some of the mudrās in the Dattātreyayogaśāstra also appear in systems of yoga of the same era that were not called Haṭhayoga as evinced, for example, 

5 The Dattātreyayogaśāstra (14) states that Mantrayoga is for the lowest type of practitioner, who has a weak intellect. This is why it is the lowest yoga of the hierarchy (alpabuddhir imaṃ yogaṃ sevate sādhakādhamaḥ | mantrayogo hy ayaṃ prokto yogānām adhamas smṛtaḥ ||). A passage in the long recension of the Amaraughaprabodha (17cd–24), which might postdate the Haṭhapradīpikā, explicitly connects each of the four types of student to one of these four yogas. Both this passage and the similar one in the Śivasaṃhitā, mentioned above, appear to have been inspired by the Amṛtasiddhi’s discourse (chapters 15–18) on the four types of student in relation to the four stages of yoga. 

6 This Vaiṣṇava form of aṣṭāṅgayoga is taught (without the Haṭhayogicmudrās) in theVasiṣṭha saṃhitā and Yogayājñavalkya, which were probably composed in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, respectively. 

7 Recent work on nineteen manuscripts of the Yogabīja by the Haṭha Yoga Project has revealed an early recension that does not teach these bandhas andmudrās. Nonetheless, it is likely that a section on four kumbhakas and the three bandhas was added to the text before the time of the Haṭhapradīpikā, in an attempt to explain the practice of śakticālana and Haṭhayoga. 

8 Yogabīja, ms. no. 29917, f. 11v, line 5 (haṭhena grasyate jāḍyaṃ haṭhayogaḥ sa ucyate). The “union of the sun and moon” definition was added to later recensions of the Yogabīja, one of which may still predate the Haṭhapradīpikā.

by two Śaiva works, the Vivekamārtaṇḍa and the Gorakṣaśataka.9 This suggests that from the twelfth to the fifteenth century the practice of these particular mudrās was more widespread than the use of the term haṭhayoga for designat ing a system of praxis. In fact, according to the available evidence, haṭhayoga is used in this sense in only four non-Buddhist Sanskrit yoga texts that are likely to predate the Haṭhapradīpikā, and two others whose dating is less certain.10 

Unlike the asceticism and yoga of esoteric traditions, the texts of Haṭhayoga do not mention the need for initiation (dīkṣā) for its practice, a characteristic that appears to reflect haṭhayoga’s role as an auxiliary practice for people of various religions and social status, including householders (Birch 2015, 8–10). Although some of the distinguishing mudrās of Haṭhayoga, such as inverting the body, may be similar to techniques of older traditions of asceticism (tapas), the mudrās had been adapted and repurposed by tantric Buddhist and Śaiva sects by the time texts such as the Amṛtasiddhi and the Amaraughaprabodha were composed. None of the early teachings on Haṭhayoga refer to tapas and, in contrast to the mortifying effects of extreme methods of tapas, the propo nents of Haṭhayoga claimed that this type of yoga would not afflict the body and would, in fact, bring about health and jīvanmukti (“liberation-in-life”) rel atively quickly. Nonetheless, in this period there were opponents to Haṭhayoga 

9 One might also include the Śivasaṃhitā as an example here. The fourth chapter of this work teaches āsanas, prāṇāyāma and ten mudrās, as well as yonimudrā, which became an integral part of the typology of the Haṭhapradīpikā. Chapters 1–4 of the Śivasaṃhitā, in which these techniques are taught, do not refer to Haṭhayoga, which is mentioned only briefly in the fifth chapter. The first four chapters may have been an original text that was combined with the fifth sometime before the seventeenth century (Birch 2018, 107 note 13). 

10 These are the Amaraughaprabodha, the Dattātreyayogaśāstra, the Yogabīja and the Yoga tārāvalī. The other two are the Śivasaṃhitā and the Aparokṣānubhūti, whose verses on Haṭhayoga may not predate the Haṭhapradīpikā. On the dating of the Śivasaṃhitā, see Birch 2018, 107, note 13. As far as I know, the date of the Aparokṣānubhūti is uncertain and it is possible that its verses on Haṭhayoga were added more recently (Birch 2011, 540, notes 98–100). A Sanskrit Vīraśaiva work called the Śaivaratnākara by Jyotirnātha men tions in passing the four yogas in the same order as the Yogabīja (i.e., Mantra, Haṭha-, Laya and Rājayoga). According to Elaine Fisher (personal communication, 10 March 2019), the Śaivaratnākara may have been composed in the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth century, which so happens to be the likely date of the early recension of the Yogabīja. A large Sanskrit compendium called the Śārṅgadharapaddhati, probably dated to 1363CE, mentions Haṭhayoga in a syncretic section on yoga that borrows from earlier yoga texts. I am also aware of a Marathi text on yoga that may predate the fifteenth century, namely, the Vivekadarpaṇa. This work defines but rejects Haṭhayoga in favour of a gnostic type of Rājayoga.

who considered it to be like hard asceticism insofar as it was a cause of suffering and unnecessary exertion. These opponents usually favoured effortless gnostic methods for attaining liberation.11 

The conception of Haṭhayoga in the Haṭhapradīpikā represents a turning point in its history. The author of this work Svātmārāma incorporated a larger repertoire of techniques than earlier works and synthesized diverse teachings of various yoga traditions into a cohesive system, which he called Haṭhayoga. Before Svātmārāma’s efforts, Haṭhayoga had been conceived as one of several auxiliaries in hierarchical models of yoga. In the Haṭhapradīpikā, Haṭhayoga is the sole means to Rājayoga and a complete soteriological system. The suc cess of Svātmārāma’s interpretation is attested by the fact that subsequent authors borrowed much of the structure and content of the Haṭhapradīpikā in creating more extensive works on Haṭhayoga. Also, the Haṭhapradīpikā was widely quoted as an authority on its subject, in particular by erudite authors of compendiums on yoga that were composed after the fifteenth century, and it appears to have spread throughout most of India. Recently published cat alogues indicate that nearly two hundred manuscripts of the Haṭhapradīpikā are held in libraries throughout India, from Kashmir to Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to West Bengal in various scripts, as well as a few vernacular commentaries. 

The Haṭhapradīpikā might be considered the culmination of a formative period in the development of Haṭhayoga as a system of praxis. In this sense, it marks the beginning of Haṭhayoga as a distinct method that combined both seated and non-seated āsanas, the eight kumbhakas and the ten mudrās. In keeping with the earlier literature, the main goal of these techniques was Rājayoga. However, in addition to the mudrās of Haṭhayoga, Svātmārāma also stipulated the practice of three other mudrās for Rājayoga, namely, śāmbhavī mudrā, khecarīmudrā12 and a simplified form of ṣaṇmukhīmudrā, which is not named as such, but is prescribed for “fusing the mind with the internal res onance” (nādānusandhāna).13 These “meditational” mudrās probably derive 

11 Early examples of texts that critique and reject Haṭhayoga and its methods include the Mokṣopāya/Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha and the Amanaska (Birch 2011, 531, 544–545). 

12 Khecarīmudrā is taught in chapters three and four of the Haṭhapradīpikā. In the fourth chapter, the practice of this mudrā consists of focusing the mind between the eyebrows, rather than the Haṭhayogic khecarīmudrā of inserting the tongue into the nasopharyngeal cavity, which is taught in the third chapter. 

13 The Haṭhapradīpikā (4.68) states that the ears, eyes, nostrils and mouth should be blocked in order to hear the internal resonance (nāda) in the suṣumnā channel. Brahmānanda’s Jyotsnā commentary on this verse adds that the senses are blocked by the fingers, and he calls this practice ṣaṇmukhīmudrā. A simpler technique is also mentioned at Haṭha pradīpikā 4.82ab, in which the yogin presses the ears with the hands to initiate nādānu

from older traditions of Rājayoga, one of which explicitly rejects the mudrās of Haṭhayoga.14 Their inclusion in the Haṭhapradīpikā reflects Svātmārāma’s efforts to bring together techniques of diverse traditions under the umbrella term haṭhayoga. 

After the fifteenth century, the composition of yoga texts which teach or integrate Haṭhayoga flourished. Although these texts reveal significant efforts at augmenting Haṭhayoga’s repertoire of techniques and synthesising it with other yogas, religions and philosophies, the schema of the Haṭhapradīpikā was most often the starting point and, in many cases, the prevailing paradigm for Haṭhayoga in both the scholarly and more praxis-orientated works that will be discussed below. 

2 Post Fifteenth-Century Literature of Haṭhayoga 

A notable change in the literature that followed the Haṭhapradīpikā was the composition of more comprehensive works on Haṭhayoga and large compendi ums on yoga that integrated Haṭhayoga. The early literature on Haṭhayoga con sists mainly of short pithy texts that provide skeletal systems of practice and rudimentary theoretical details. The later literature incorporates more tech niques and theory, as well as more elaborate systems of practice. The consider able growth in the length of the later works can be seen in Table 19.1. 

It should be noted that, on the whole, the early works were composed in a low register of Sanskrit and anuṣṭubh metre.15 They are prescriptive and ele mentary, which suggests that they were probably written for practitioners. In contrast to this, many of the later works, such as the Haṭhatattvakaumudī and theYogacintāmaṇi, are more scholarly and tend to be written in higher registers of Sanskrit. Their authors utilize more complex metres, compile their mate rial from a wider range of sources and often include commentary on the older sources, which are frequently cited with attribution. 

sandhāna (karṇau pidhāya hastābhyāṃ yaḥ śṛṇoti dhvaniṃ muniḥ). A similar technique is described in the Śivasvarodaya (383), the Rājayogāmṛtasāra of Ānandānandanātha (1.17– 18, f. 9r–9v), the Maṇḍalabrāhmaṇopaniṣat (2.2.2) and the Jogapradīpyakā (685–688), and it is depicted in an illustrated manuscript called “seven āsanas of yoga” at the National Museum of New Delhi, PCWA gallery. 

14 For example, one of the earliest yoga texts to teach a mudrā called śāmbhavī is the Amanaska, a text on Rājayoga that explicitly rejects prāṇāyāma and the mudrās and karaṇas associated with it (Birch 2014, 406–408). 

15 The exception is the Yogatārāvalī, which is composed in triṣṭubh and incorporates poetic images, etc.

c This is an approximate number of ślokas for the Haṭhatattvakaumudī, which has fifty-six chapters, ranging from 5 to 150 ślokas each. Most are around 20. So, I have taken an aver age of 30. The Haṭhatattvakaumudī is undoubtedly a large yoga text, and I have felt no the need to add up all of its ślokas to prove this point. 

d This estimate is given in a scribal comment at the end of a manuscript of the Yogacintāmaṇi held at the Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute (ms. No. 9785 p. 257, line 14). 

In order to discuss the salient characteristics of the late literature on Haṭha yoga, I shall divide the texts into two categories. The first consists of “extended works” on the topic of Haṭhayoga and the second, “compendiums” that borrow from Haṭha- and Rājayoga texts. There are some texts, such as the Haṭhasaṅke tacandrikā, which could be placed in either category. Nonetheless, the purpose of introducing these etic categories is to reveal particular stylistic features and content that are characteristic of the works in each group. 

2.1 Extended Works 

The extended works expatiate on the type of Haṭhayoga that was outlined in the Haṭhapradīpikā. Many of these works borrow verses from the Haṭhapradī pikā and their discourse centres on the praxis and theory of Haṭhayoga. Exam ples include:

Haṭharatnāvalī (17th c.)16 

Haṭhayogasaṃhitā (17th c.)17 

Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati (18th c.)18 

Haṭhayogamañjarī (18th c.?)19 

16 On the date of the Haṭharatnāvalī, see Birch 2018, 109 note 24. 

17 The Haṭhayogasaṃhitā is a compilation that borrows extensively from the Haṭhapradī pikā. The opening verses (1.2–3) acknowledge the seven sages, namely Mārkaṇḍeya, Bharadvāja, Marīci, Jaimini, Parāśara, Bhṛgu and Viśvāmitra, for spreading Haṭhayoga in the world. The stated aim of Haṭhayoga is to achieve purification (śodhanaṃ), firmness (dṛḍhatā), steadiness (sthairya), constancy (dhairya), lightness (lāghava), direct percep tion (pratyakṣa) and liberation (nirlipta) of the body (ghaṭa).Its Haṭhayoga has seven aux iliaries: the ṣaṭkarma, āsana, mudrā, pratyāhāra, prāṇasaṃyāma, dhyāna and samādhi. The Haṭhayogasaṃhitā appears to have been the basis of the Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā (eigh teenth century), which adds a new frame story (viz., a dialogue between the teacher Gheraṇḍa and a student Caṇḍakāpāli), several elaborate visualization practices and a six-fold Rājayoga. The Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā calls its yoga ghaṭasthayoga, omits the Haṭhayo gasaṃhitā’s teachings on vajrolī and redefines this mudrā as a handstand, thus revealing a reluctance to adopt the transgressive practices of Haṭhayoga. 

18 The terminus ad quemof the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati is the Śrītattvanidhi, which was a com pendium composed by Kṛṣṇarāja Waḍiyar III, the Mahārāja of Mysore, who was active in the mid-nineteenth century (Sjoman 1996, 40). The Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati was a source text of the Śrītattvanidhi (see Birch 2018, 131–134), and probably predates it by a hundred years or so (Birch and Singleton 2019, 14–16). 

19 Not much scholarly attention has been given to this work. Its name in the published edi tion is not entirely certain according to the colophons. The text begins with the heading Haṭhayogamañjarī. However, the second chapter’s colophon refers to the Jogī-cintāmaṇi of Śrīsahajānandanātha, the third chapter’s colophon to the Śrīsarvopaniṣat, and the final colophon to the Gorakhajogamañjarī. The text could be a composite work consisting of summaries or extracts of different texts. Nonetheless, the Haṭhayogamañjarī styles itself as a work on Haṭhayoga. The terms haṭhayoga and haṭhavidyā are used in each chap ter and it contains a description of the haṭhayogī (p. 32). Its opening verses (2–5) state that it is an explanation of the Haṭhapradīpikā in a vernacular language (bhāṣā). It cer tainly covers most of the content of the Haṭhapradīpikā, but also includes additional material on yama, niyama, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, etc. A significant difference is that much of the Haṭhapradīpikā’s discourse on Rājayoga has been omitted. Like other Brajbhāṣā texts, such as the Jogapradīpyakā (1737CE), the author of the Haṭhayogamañjarī equates vajrolīmudrā with Rājayoga. I am yet to consult a manuscript of this work or even find a reference to it in a manuscript catalogue or another yoga text. It may be the work referred to as the Jogamañjarī (acc. no. 6543, Rajasthan Pracya Vidya Pratisthan, Bikaner, Rajasthan) by Gharote et al. (2006a, lxvii). However, the librarian at this library in Bikaner was unable to locate this manuscript whenJames Mallinson andI visited on separate occa sions in 2018. The Haṭhayogamañjarī mentions devotion to Rāma (e.g., p. 10, v. 33 and p. 18, v. 25 and the last line) and was probably compiled in the same period and milieu as the Jogapradīpyakā.

Haṭhapradīpikā with ten chapters (18th c.)20 

Siddhāntamuktāvalī (18th c.),21 etc. 

In particular, the last two texts are literally extended versions of the Haṭha pradīpikā because their authors simply added more verses to the original work and created additional chapters on related topics.In fact, these“extended texts” enlarge on the Haṭhapradīpikā in two ways. Firstly, they integrate other types of yoga and various related topics. For example, the Haṭharatnāvalī combines the fourfold system of yoga (i.e., Mantra-, Laya-, Haṭha- and Rājayoga) of earlier works, such as the Amaraughaprabodha, with the aṣṭāṅga format. The author of the Haṭharatnāvalī borrowed over one hundred and thirty verses from the Haṭhapradīpikā and mentions Svātmārāma’s views on several specific matters (Gharote et al. 2002, xx). The Siddhāntamuktāvalī significantly extends the original Haṭhapradīpikā by adding sections on the purification of the channels (nāḍīśuddhi), meditation (dhyāna), cheating death (kālavañcana) and indiffer ence (audāsīnya). A similar array of topics is seen in the Yogamārgaprakāśikā (16–18th c.22), which adopts the fourfold system of yoga noted above. Its teach ings on Haṭhayoga follow for the most part the Haṭhapradīpikā. 

Secondly, the repertoire of techniques in most of the texts which follow the Haṭhapradīpikā became larger. As shown in Table 19.2, the number of āsanas increases most significantly.23 However, it is also the case that techniques were added to the standard collections of the ṣaṭkarmas andmudrās. The original six therapeutic interventions known as the ṣaṭkarma form the basis of a repertoire of twenty-one techniques in the Haṭhayogasaṃhitā. This work also adds fifteen mudrās to the usual ten that are taught in Haṭhayoga. Furthermore, these texts provide greater detail on many of the mudrās. For example, the Haṭhābhyās apaddhati contains the most elaborate teachings on vajroli, which is taught in great detail along with its preliminary practices and medical applications. In table 19.2 the number of kumbhakas remains almost the same but, generally speaking, these texts contain many more verses on prāṇāyāma.24 

20 On the date of the Haṭhapradīpikā with ten chapters, see Birch 2018a, 8 note 32. 21 On the date of the Siddhāntamuktāvalī, see Birch 2018, 127. 

22 On the date of the Yogamārgaprakāśikā, see Birch 2018a, 8 note 29. 

23 The Haṭharatnāvalī lists eighty-four āsanas but describes only thirty-six of them. Other examples from this period of yoga texts with the names and descriptions of large num bers of āsanas include the Siddhāntamuktāvalī (96 āsanas), the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati (112 āsanas), the Yogāsana (108 āsanas), the Yogāsanamālā (110 āsanas) and the Ujjain manuscript (No. 3537) of the Yogacintāmaṇi (54 āsanas described and two lists of over eighty names of āsanas). For further information on this, see Birch 2018. 

24 For example, the Haṭharatnāvalī has 97 verses in its chapter on prāṇāyāma whereas

The period in which these extended works arose was one in which physical practices were documented on an unprecedented scale. Monographic works were composed on particular techniques that had become, by this time, closely associated with Haṭhayoga. Examples include the following: 

Kumbhakapaddhati (17th c.)25 

Satkarmasaṅgraha (18th c.)26 

Yogāsanamālā (18th century)27 

Yogāsana (19th century),28 etc. 

The composition of such works indicates ongoing innovation and syncretisa tion in the practice of āsana, prāṇāyāma and the ṣaṭkarma that is also reflected in the extended Haṭhayoga texts mentioned above. The Kumbhakapaddhati describes over seventy varieties of breath retention (kumbhaka) and the Satkar masaṅgraha borrowed many of its additional therapeutic interventions from 

the Haṭhapradīpikā has 78. The Haṭhatattvakaumudī has five chapters on prāṇāyāma (9, 10, 12, 37–38), namely, the preliminary auxiliaries and rules of practice for prāṇāyāma (prāṇāyāmapūrvāṅgasādhanavidhi), an explanation of the names, nature and charac teristics of kumbhakas (kumbhakanāmasvarūpaguṇa), breathing methods for quelling suffering (kleśaghnavāyusādhana), necessary rules for prāṇāyāma (prāṇāyāmakartavya vidhi) and an explanation of prāṇāyāma (prāṇāyāmavivecana), which total more than 240 verses. The Siddhāntamuktāvalī (ff. 53r–86v), the Yogacintāmaṇi (pp. 161–220) and the Yuktabhavadeva (pp. 107–143) have large sections on prāṇāyāma as well.

2.2 Extended Works: Scholarly vs Praxis-Orientated 

Some of the extended works are the result of scholarly efforts to synthesise and elaborate on material from earlier works, whereas others appear to doc ument, perhaps for the first time, a practice that was in use at the time of writing. A good example of a more scholarly extended work is the Haṭharat nāvalī, which was composed by Śrīnivāsa. At the beginning of the first chap ter, he presents himself as a learned writer by informing the reader that he is an eminent astrologer who excels in the Vedas, Vedānta, the works of Patañ jali, Vyākaraṇa, Tantra, Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, as well as various other texts and philosophies.30 His remarks on the Haṭhapradīpikā indicate that he was responding to deficiencies which he perceived in that work.31 In par ticular, his list of eighty-four āsanas appears to have been the creation of a scholar who felt compelled to elaborate on references to this canonical number of postures in early works, such as the Dattātreyayogaśāstra and the Viveka mārtaṇḍa.32 In fact, Śrīnivāsa’s list of eighty-four names of postures is pre ceded and followed by verses of the Vivekamārtaṇḍa and the Haṭhapradīpikā, which state that Śiva taught eighty-four āsanas.33 The compilatory nature of his collection is revealed by explicit references to and tacit borrowings from the Haṭhapradīpikā, the Yogayājñavalkya, and the Dattātreyayogaśāstra in his descriptions of thirty-six āsanas.34 Also, Śrīnivāsa incorporated into the list at least twelve variations of certain basic postures, which further suggests that this list was a scholarly contrivance arising from his intention to expatiate on earlier textual references to eighty-four āsanas.35 

29 For further details on this, see Birch 2018a, 49–56. 

30 Haṭharatnāvalī 1.2 (vede vedāntaśāstre phaṇipatiracite śabdaśāstre svaśāstre tantre prā bhākarīye kaṇabhugabhihite nyāyaratnārṇavenduḥ |sāṅkhye sārasvatīye vividhamatimate tattvacintāmaṇijñaḥ śrīmajjyotirvid agre saravaratanujo rājate śrīnivāsaḥ ||). 

31 For example, see Śrīnivāsa’s commentary to Haṭharatnāvalī 1.27 and 2.86. 32 For references and translations of the relevant verses, see Birch 2018, 107–108. 33 Haṭharatnāvalī 3.7 (~ Vivekamārtaṇḍa 8–10) and 3.23 (= Haṭhapradīpikā 1.35). 34 In the Haṭharatnāvalī’s section on āsana, the Haṭhapradīpikā, the Yogayājñavalkya, and 

the Dattātreyayogaśāstra are cited by name at 3.23, 3.35 and 3.36, respectively. Haṭharat nāvalī 3.42–43, 51–54, 57–58, etc., are tacitly borrowed from the Haṭhapradīpikā. Also, Haṭharatñāvalī 3.77 is a rewriting of Vivekamārtaṇḍa 92. 

35 Six types of mayūrāsana are mentioned in Haṭharatnāvalī 3.10 and five are described at 3.42–47; three of matsyendrāsana are mentioned in 3.12 and described at 3.58–60; two of paścimatānāsana are mentioned in 3.13, and both are described at 3.66–68; and possibly five of kukkuṭāsana are mentioned in 3.17 (if one assumes that ākārita and bandhacūlī, 
 

462 birch 

The scholarly efforts of Śrīnivāsa in compiling a list of āsanas can be con trasted with what one might call “praxis-orientated works” in this category, such as the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati and the chapter on āsana in the Siddhānta muktāvalī. These works are composed in the same style as the early Haṭhayoga texts; they are prescriptive and focus on praxis rather than theory. Their col lections of āsanas do not appear to be a synthesis of earlier textual sources because their authors do not cite or allude to any sources, and a large propor tion of their āsanas is not attested in earlier texts. In the case of the Haṭhā bhyāsapaddhati, innovations seem apparent in the use of moving āsanas, sequencing, linking postures, counterposing and the use of props, such as ropes and walls (Birch 2018, 134–135). Therefore, it is likely that innovation played a significant role in the proliferation of techniques seen in these praxis orientated extended works which postdate the Haṭhapradīpikā. Although some of these complex postures may predate the fifteenth century, as revealed by iconography, the codification of large numbers of complex postures in texts specifically on Haṭhayoga, as well as works on yoga broadly conceived, such as the Jogapradīpyakā, appears to have emerged from the seventeenth century onwards. In fact, only a small portion of the aggregate number of these āsanas are anticipated by the earlier sculptural collections of the Mehudi gate, Brah manath temple and Hampi,36 which further suggests that a certain degree of innovation was probably at play during Haṭhayoga’s floruit. 

There is little evidence to indicate that scholarly extended works, such as the Haṭharatnāvalī, and the compendiums mentioned below were sources of information for Kṛṣṇamācārya, Swāmī Śivānanda and other gurus who popu larized physical yoga in the early twentieth century. These gurus deferred to the Pātañjalayogaśāstra and the Haṭhapradīpikā in their publications. Nonethe less, there is significant evidence that they surreptitiously adopted postures from traditions of āsana practice that were prevalent in certain regions of India in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The traces of these traditions are dis cernible through texts such as the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati, the Jogapradīpyakā and the Yogāsana,37 which preserve teachings on large distinct collections 

which are included among kukkuṭa,ekapādakakukkuṭa and pārśvakukkuṭa, are variations of the same posture). 

36 On large collections of āsanas at these locations, see Vijaya Sarde 2015 and 2017, and Seth Powell 2018. 

37 The āsanas of the Yogāsana, most of which correspond to untraced Sanskrit descrip tions quoted in a commentary on the Yogasūtra by Śrīkṛṣṇavallabhācārya (1939), were reproduced in several early twentieth-century publications, one of which was Swāmī Śivānanda’s book Yoga Asanas. This will be discussed at length in a forthcoming publi cation.

of complex āsanas (Birch, forthcoming). The growing emphasis on complex āsanas and mudrās in practical works such as the Siddhāntamuktāvalī also occurs for the first time in the literature of erudite Brahmins of the same era. I shall now turn my attention to these more scholarly works which integrated Haṭha- and Rājayoga into more orthodox conceptions of yoga. 

2.3 Yoga Compendiums 

A century or so after the Haṭhapradīpikā, a number of lengthy compendi ums on yoga were composed. Most of these compendiums do not focus on any particular type of yoga, but treat the subject more generally by combin ing many sources, including texts on Haṭhayoga. Generally speaking, these compendiums are scholarly works of literature, which incorporate philoso phy and metaphysics on a more ambitious scale than earlier texts, such as the Haṭhapradīpikā. In a sense, their authors produced a new discourse on yoga by combining the teachings of Haṭha- and Rājayoga with those of the Pātañ jalayogaśāstra and various Brahmanical texts, including the Bhagavadgītā, the Mahābhārata, early Upaniṣads, Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstras. In the early twentieth century, a synthesis of the same genres was favoured by Brahmin gurus such as Kṛṣṇamācārya, Swāmī Śivānanda and Swāmī Kuvalayānanda, who combined physical yoga techniques with concepts from Pātañjalayoga and Advaitavedānta, as well as metaphysics from tantric traditions, to teach yoga to an international audience.38 

The compendiums to which I am primarily referring are:39 

Yogacintāmaṇi of Godāvaramiśra (16th c.) 

Yogapañcāśikā (early 16th c.)40 

38 One should consult the work of Elizabeth de Michelis (2004) and Mark Singleton (2010) for the modern elements, such as neo-Vedānta and physical culture, that also shaped the teachings of these gurus. Some significant similarities in their teachings with the sources I am discussing include the use of the aṣṭāṅga format, the integration of bandhas and mudrās with āsana and prāṇāyāma, the importance of inverted āsanas, the identification of samādhi with Advaitavedānta concepts and, above all, the trans-sectarian approach to compiling their teachings. 

39 For dating, please refer to Birch 2018a, unless otherwise indicated. 

40 The Yogapañcāśikā might be the earliest attempt to integrate Haṭha- and Rājayoga with Pātañjalayoga. The text is cited by name in a Sanskrit work called theVivekamukura, which was composed by Nṛsimha Bhāratīya, according to its last verse (97). If this is the same author who wrote the commentary called the Subodhinī on the Vedāntasāra, as stated by Thangaswami (1980, 360–361), then Nṛsimha Bhāratī of Varanasi was active in the late sixteenth century. Unlike other compilations in this list, the Yogapañcāśikā is a short

Its yoga is not intended for those who deny the validity of scripture (nāstika), but for male life-long brahmacārins (nṛnaiṣṭhika). This text is unpublished and, as far as I am aware, preserved by only one manuscript, which has several small lacunae.

43 The Yogasārasaṅgraha undoubtedly postdates the Haṭhapradīpikā and the Śivayogapra dīpikā. The latter was probably composed in the late fifteenth century. However, the Yogasārasaṅgraha may post-date the Haṭharatnāvalī (seventeenth century), as it shares a verse on bhujaṅgīkaraṇa, a technique that is only taught in the Haṭharatnāvalī (2.31), as far as I am aware (cf. Yogasārasaṅgraha p. 28, lines 4–5). Also, there are other verses on Haṭhayoga that seem to follow the Haṭharatnāvalī rather than the Haṭhapradīpikā (e.g., Yogasārasaṅgraha p. 55, lines 8–14 ≈Haṭharatnāvalī 2.32–35). The Yogasārasaṅgraha’ster minus ad quem would probably be one of its manuscripts. Several appear to be reported in the New Catalogus Catalogorum (hereafter NCC), but I have not had the opportunity to consult any of them. 

44 These so-called Yoga Upaniṣads are part of a recent recension compiled in South India in the first half of the eighteenth century and commented on by Upaniṣadbrahmayo gin (See Bouy 1994). They include the Yogatattvopaniṣat, the Dhyānabindūpaniṣat, the Nādabindūpaniṣat, the Śāṇḍilyopaniṣat, theYogacūḍāmaṇyupaniṣat, theYogakuṇḍalinyu paniṣat, the Yogaśikhopaniṣat, the Darśanopaniṣat, the Maṇḍalabrāhmanopaniṣat, the Saubhāgyalakṣmyupaniṣat and the Varāhopaniṣat. 

45 The Rājatarala is a lengthy commentary on the Yogatārāvalī (circa 14th c.) that was com posed by Rāmasvāmipaṇḍita, who is described as a worshipper of Śaṅkarācārya’s feet (śrīśaṃkarācāryapādakiṃkara). He cites the Maṇḍalabrāhmaṇopaniṣat (ms. no. 72330, f. 29v), which means that the Rājatarala was composed after the corpus of one hundred and eight Upaniṣads, that is, the mid-eighteenth century (Bouy 1994, 6, 34, etc.). Also, a verse pays homage to a Dakṣiṇāmūrti in the city of Śrīśaila, near Kadalī, which appears to locate the work in Andhra Pradesh (Mahadevan 2018, 68). It is preserved by one undated palm-leaf manuscript (No. 72330) in Telugu script at the Adyar Library and Research Cen tre, Chennai, and an undated transcript (No. B378) in Devanagari (circa 20th century) at the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore.

Yogasandhyā (early 19th c.)46 

Gorakṣasiddhāntasaṅgraha (19th c.)47 

The authors of these compendiums often combined yoga teachings from differ ent traditions seamlessly. For example, in the Yogacintāmaṇi, Godāvaramiśra integrated the physical methods of Haṭhayoga with the auxiliaries of āsana and prāṇāyāma in Patañjali’s aṣṭāṅga system (see below). Similarly, in Śivānanda’s Yogacintāmaṇi and Bhavadeva’s Yuktabhavadeva, the meditative state of Rājayoga became the equivalent of Patañjali’s highest stage of samādhi, called asaṃprajñātasamādhi.48 Most authors of these works were inclined towards Vedānta. They cited the teachings of the Upaniṣads to express the gnostic insights that arise from samādhi. Also, they incorporated theistic teachings on yoga from the Purāṇas and Tantras, and were comfortable with defining yoga as meditation (i.e.,cittavṛttinirodha), on the one hand, and then as the union of the self with a deity, on the other hand. Likewise, their descriptions of dhāraṇā and dhyāna juxtapose Patañjali’s definition of “binding the mind to one place, etc.,” with tantric visualizations of the five elements and deities. 

2.4 Godāvaramiśra’s and Śivānanda’s Thought Gems on Yoga In theYogacintāmaṇi, Godāvaramiśra’s method of synthesising Haṭhayoga with other yogas is typical of this genre.49 Godāvaramiśra was a chief minister (mantrivara) and preceptor (rājaguru) to the Orissan king Pratāparudradeva, 

46 According to the final colophon, the Yogasandhyāwas composed by Śrīsadāśivanārāyaṇa brahmacāri, whose guru was Śrīmajjagannāthacaitanyabrahmacāri. They belonged to the tradition of the Śṛṅgerīmaṭha. The final verse mentions the date of composition in the bhūtasaṅkhyā system.If the termdharma represents the number eight, it would have been completed in VS 1861 (= 1804CE), when the sun was in the ninth nakṣatra (tapas) and the moon full. See Yogasandhyā, p. 203 (rākeśarasadharmorvvīsammite vaikrame ’bdake | tapasīne ca rākāyāṃ satkṛtiḥ pūrṇatāmitā). I would like to thank for their comments on this verse Somadeva Vasudeva, Péter Szántó, James Mallinson and, in particular, Chris Minkowski, who suggested that dharma could mean 4, 6 or 8. 

47 The date of the Gorakṣasiddhāntasaṅgraha is not certain, although it post-dates the Sid dhasiddhāntapaddhati, which might be as late as the eighteenth century (Mallinson 2014, 170–171). 

48 Śivānanda’sYogacintāmaṇi, p. 9 (natatra kiñ cid vedyaṃ saṃprajñāyata ity asaṃprajñātaḥ samādhiḥ | ayaṃ nirbīja iti nirvikalpa iti nirālamba iti rājayoga—iti cocyate) and Yuktab havadeva 1.33 ([…] sa eva nirvikalpaḥ samādhiḥ sadā savikalpakajñānābhāvāt || sa eva ca rājayogaḥ). 

49 This work survives in a single, incomplete manuscript, which is dated Wednesday, 16th November 1715CE. Yogacintāmaṇi (f. 132v, lines 7–8): saṃvat 1772 varṣe kārttika vadi mā vāsyā budhavāsare likhitaṃ.

who ruled in the early sixteenth century. In addition to yoga, Godāvaramiśra wrote works on various topics, including Advaitavedānta (the Advaitadar paṇa50), Tantra (the Tantracintāmaṇi) and an extensive treatise on politics and warfare (the Hariharacaturaṅga).51 His view of yoga was mainly shaped by the Pātañjalayogaśāstra. He acknowledges this at the beginning of his work: 

In this text, I summarise and examine Patañjali’s doctrine, which was explained by Vyāsa, Vācaspati and Bhojadeva and which is validated and [yet] overlooked elsewhere.52 

Although Godāvaramiśra discusses only some of the sūtras of the Pātañjalayo gaśāstra in an order that fits the design of his work, he begins with the first one (atha yogānuśāsanam) and, in his discussion of it, cites with attribution pas sages from the Gāruḍapurāṇa (sic), the Bhagavadgītā, the Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa and the Kūrmapurāṇa, as well as the sages Yājñavalkya (i.e., the Yājñavalkyasm ṛti) and Maharṣimataṅga.53 The first half of the Yogacintāmaṇi is concerned with general topics, such as definitions of yoga, the types of samādhi and so on. The latter half is structured on the eight auxiliaries (aṣṭāṅga) of Pātañ jalayoga, and it is in his discussions of āsana, diet and prāṇāyāma that he cites 

50 The Yogacintāmaṇi (f. 131v lines 7–8) of Godāvaramiśra states that he wrote the dvaitadar paṇa: “Now, they have been explained together by me in the Dvaitadarpaṇa” ([…] asmāb hir atha dvaitadarpaṇe yugapadanuvarṇitāḥ […]). However, it seems that atha dvaitadar paṇe is a scribal error for athādvaitadarpaṇe, because yugapadanuvarṇitāḥ refers back to two works: the Saṅkṣepaśārīrakavārttika, which was composed by his paternal grand father (pitāmahacaraṇa) and the Advaitacintāmaṇi by his father (pitṛcaraṇa). The NCC (vol. 6, 126) reports that Godāvaramiśra wrote the Advaitadarpaṇa because it is quoted in his Hariharacaturaṅga (p. 178, v. 22; p. 196, v. 502). This is affirmed in a summary of the Hariharacaturaṅga (Meulenbeld 2000, 562–563). 

51 For more information on Godāvaramiśra’s family and works, see the NCC vol. 6, 1971, 126 and Meulenbeld 2000, 562–563. 

52 Yogacintāmaṇi, f. 1v, lines 4–5 ( yad vyāsavācaspatibhojadevaiḥ pātañjalīyaṃ niraṇāyi tattvaṃ | anyatra siddhaṃ yad upekṣitaṃ catad atra saṅkṣipya nirūpayāmi ||3||) The codex reads upekṣitaṃ, but Gode (1953, 474) transcribes it as apekṣitaṃ. Whether he was tacitly emending upekṣitaṃ to apekṣitaṃ is not clear. He may have emended because the mean ing of apekṣita is more consistent with siddha, but it seems possible that upekṣita was intended to contrast with siddha, as I have translated. 

53 One would expect that the Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra is meant by this attribution. How ever, I have not found the cited verse in the published edition of this tantra. The verse in the Yogacintāmaṇi (f. 3v, lines 5–7) is agniṣṭomādikān yajñān vihāya dvijasattamaḥ yogāb hyāsarataḥ śāntaḥ paraṃ brahmādhigacchati || brāhmaṇakṣatriyaviśāṃ strīśūdrāṇāṃ ca pāvanaṃ śāntaye karmaṇām anyad yogān nāsti vimuktaye ||. This verse is found in the Viṣṇudharma (98.016). 
 

two works on Haṭhayoga: the Haṭhapradīpikā (haṭhayoge—f. 39v, l. 8) and the Dattātreyayogaśāstra (dattātreyaḥ—f. 36r, line 1; f. 40v, line 3). He also cites the Yogayājñavalkya ( yājñavalkyaḥ—f. 36r, line 6; f. 36v, line 6; f. 37v, line 7; f. 38v, line 7), which was a source text for the Haṭhapradīpikā. The other sources on these topics are the Dharmaputrikā, the Pavanayogasaṅgraha, the Āgneya purāṇa and the Mataṅgapārameśvaratantra. Therefore, on the topic of āsana, Godāvaramiśra created a seamless synthesis of haṭhayogic teachings with those of tantric and brahmanical sources. 

Godāvaramiśra’s work became the basis of an ambitious attempt by Śivānan dasarasvatī to integrate a more extensive and diverse array of Haṭhayoga texts with Pātañjalayoga and Brahmanical works. Śivānanda also named his compi lation theYogacintāmaṇi. He probably lived in the early-seventeenth century in Varanasi.54 At the end of this text, Śivānanda informs the reader of the material he has included and excluded. He says: 

Meditation along with the practices [ancillary to it] have been explained briefly by me according to scripture and my understanding. Listening to and contemplating [the teachings] which are seen in detail and at length only in the Upaniṣads, have not been discussed for fear of prolixity. I have revealed here all that which is secret in Haṭha- and Rājayoga for the delight of yogins. However, that Haṭhayoga which was practised by Uddālaka, Bhuśuṇḍa and others has not been mentioned by me, because it cannot be accomplished by contemporary [practitioners. Also], the pro cedures and so forth promoted by the kāpālikas have not been mentioned [because] they contravene the Vedas, Dharmaśāstras and Purāṇas.55 

54 The terminus a quo of Śivānanda’s Yogacintāmaṇi is Godāvaramiśra’s Yogacintāmaṇi (see above). The terminus ad quemis1630CE, based on two dated manuscripts of theYogacintā maṇi. The first is reported in the catalogue of yoga manuscripts by Kaivalyadhama (2005, 226–227), which gives the author (Śivānandasarasvatī), the library (the Asiatic Society in Mumbai), the manuscript number (1083) and the date (VS 1687 = 1630CE). The sec ond manuscript is held at the Panjab University Library and has been catalogued by the Woolner Project (Ms. no. 6922). After this manuscript’s final colophon, a scribal comment indicates that it was copied by Rāma on the 13th of the month, Kārttika, in Śāka 1552 (i.e., Sunday, 17 November 1630CE). The possibility that Śivānanda was a resident of Varanasi is supported by a reference to his devotion to Viśveśvara, a standard claim of Śaivas who resided there. I would like to thank Alexis Sanderson for pointing this out to me, and he also noted that similar references to Viśveśvara in works of Śaivas who resided in Varanasi can be found in Jñānaśiva’s Jñānaratnāvalī and Viśvanātha’s Siddhāntaśekhara, which are both Saiddhāntika Paddhatis (personal communication, 24 April 2013). 

55 The Yogacintāmaṇi pp. 281–282 (with verse numbers added for the clarity of the critical apparatus): nididhyāsanam etattu mayā sādhanasaṃyutam | yathāśāstraṃ yathābodhaṃ

Both Godāvaramiśra and Śivānanda excluded the Haṭha techniques of vaj rolī, amarolī and sahajolī, presumably because these are the kāpālika practices which would be unacceptable to his brahmanical audience.56 The main differ ence between Godāvaramiśra’s and Śivananda’s compilations is that the former focused on Pātañjalayoga and cited Haṭhayoga texts sparingly, whereas the lat ter discussed Haṭhayoga as forthrightly and comprehensively as the yogas of other traditions, and cited its texts profusely. This is also the case for similar compilations of the time, such as Bhavadevamiśra’s Yuktabhavadeva and Sun daradeva’s Haṭhasaṅketacandrikā. 

2.5 The Polymathy of Bhavadevamiśra 

The synthesis of various philosophies and genres of literature in the yoga com pendiums under consideration was created by well-educated Brahmins who were knowledgeable in a wide range of scholarly subjects. A good example of this is the seventeenth-century Bhavadevamiśra, whose Yuktabhavadeva is a digest (nibandha) that integrated teachings of Haṭha- and Rājayoga with those of the Pātañjalayogaśāstra and various Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Tantras, Dhar maśāstras and the Epics. Apart from the fact that Bhavadeva cited a wide range of Sanskrit works, the breadth of his learning is attested by the com mentaries attributed to him on various śāstras. Manuscript colophons state that he was a Brahmin from Mithila and that his father was Kṛṣṇadevamiśra, his elder brother Baladevamiśra and his teacher Bhavadeva Ṭhakkura. Based on this information, the Bhavadeva who wrote the Yuktabhavadeva also wrote commentaries on the Pātañjalayogaśāstra,57 the Brahmasūtra,58 the Kāvyapra

56 The Haṭhapradīpikā (3.96d) contains a verse that points to the Kāpālika origins of amarolī (…kāpālike khaṇḍamate ’marolī). Amarolī and sahajolī are generally considered to be vari ations of vajrolī (e.g., Dattātreyogayogaśāstra 31 and 158, Haṭhapradīpikā 3.92, etc.). 

57 This commentary is called the Pātañjalīyābhinavabhāṣya and several manuscripts of it are held in the Kathmandu National Archives. The chapter colophons of E 1819-9 and A 554- 522 affirm that Bhavadeva was the son of Kṛṣṇadeva and the favourite student (priyaśiṣya) of Ṭhakkuraśrībhavadeva. 

58 This commentary is called the Candrikā, and the NCC (vol. 15, 12) reports that it is by

kāśa59 and the Vājasaneyīsaṃhitā60 as well as a work on Dharmaśāstra called the Dānadharmaprakriyā61 and another on what appears to be Vaiśeṣika phi losophy, the Vaiśeṣikaratnamālā.62 Some manuscript catalogues also attribute to a “Bhavadeva” a commentary called the Abhinavabhāṣya on the Śāṇḍilya sūtra, also known as the Bhaktimīmāṃsāsūtra,63 and some other works,64 but the catalogues I have consulted do not provide enough biographic informa tion to prove that this was the same Bhavadeva who composed the Yukta bhavadeva. Nonetheless, it is clear that Bhavadeva was a scholar whose knowl edge extended far beyond the theory and practice of yoga traditions. 

Bhavadeva, who was the son of Sanmiśrasrīkṛṣṇadeva and the disciple of Ṭhakkura bhavadeva. 

59 This commentary is called the Līlā. The NCC (vol. 4, 98) reports that it is by Bhavadeva, son of Kṛṣṇadeva of Mithila and pupil of Bhavadeva Ṭhakkura. 

60 This commentary is called the Vyākhyānaratnamālā. The NCC (vol. 28, 60) reports that it is by Bhavadeva of Mithila, son of Kṛṣṇadeva and disciple of Bhavadeva Ṭhakkura. 61 Dānadharmaprakriyā was composed by Bhavadevabhaṭṭa, son of Kṛṣṇadevamiśra (NCC 

vol. 9, 6) at the request of Rudradāsaśreṣṭhin in 1636–1637CE (NCC, vol. 16, 172). Kane (1930 vol. 1, 560) points out that this work was by Bhavadeva, son of Kṛṣṇadeva of Mithila. In a latter volume (1962, vol. 5, part ii, 28), he attributes the Prāyaścittaprakaraṇa to Bhavadev abhaṭṭa. 

62 The NCC (vol. 32, 64) reports that the Vaiśeṣikaratnamālā was written by Bhavadeva Paṇ ḍita, son of Kṛṣṇadevamiśra and disciple of Bhavadeva Ṭhakkura. This appears to be based on a sole manuscript at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (123 of 1881–1882). 

63 In its entry on the commentary called the Abhinavabhāṣya on the Śāṇḍilyasūtra or Bhak timīmāṃsāsūtra (also called the Śatasūtī or Bhaktisūtra), the NCC (vol. 15, 152) reports that this work is found in the manuscript libraries of the Oriental Institute in Baroda, the Pra jñā Pāṭhaśālā Maṇḍala at Wai and the Sampūrṇānanda library in Varanasi. The catalogues of the first two do not give any biographic information for Bhavadeva and I have not been able to consult catalogues of the Sampūrṇānanda library (SB New DC XII 44408, 44416. ii. 107900. 107911). 

64 Other works attributed to a Bhavadeva in the NCC (vol. 16, 172) include the Yogasaṅ graha, the Vyāptivāda and commentaries on the Yogadarpaṇa, the Yogabindu, the Raghu vaṃśa (called the Subodhinī) and the Ṣaḍaṅgarudra. Karl Potter’s Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Bibliography (1983, vol. 1, 475) adds commentaries by a Bhavadeva (dated to 1650) on Bhavānanda’s Kārakacakra, Īśvarakṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhyakārikā and the Pañcalak ṣaṇa section of Gaṅgeśa’s Tattvacintāmaṇi, as well as a work on Nyāya called the Anu mānaprakaraṇavyākhyā.

3 The Regional Extent of Haṭhayoga’s Literature on the Eve of Colonialism 

The compendiums of Godāvaramiśra, Śivānanda, Bhavadevamiśra and Sunda radeva endorsed the teachings of Haṭhayoga.65 These works were part of a con certed effort among some erudite Brahmins to make Haṭhayoga’s physical prac tices an integral part of the Brahmanical view of yoga, much like the so-called “Yoga Upaniṣads” that were compiled in South India in the first half of the eigh teenth century. Christian Bouy’s work (1994) on these Upaniṣads informs us that the compiler liberally borrowed material from earlier Haṭha- and Rājayoga texts, often presenting the physical practice as a way of purifying the mind that would then lead to the realization of vedantic truths. As Bouy (1994, 72) notes, the prominence of Haṭhayoga teachings in these Upaniṣads indicates that this type of yoga had come into vogue in vedāntic milieus. He says that the inter est of vedāntists in Haṭhayoga may have started in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and then flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 

In addition to the Yoga Upaniṣads and the Upāsanāsārasaṅgraha, which were examined by Bouy, the Yogasandhyā and the Rājatarala are large exeget ical works composed in South India that weave together Pātañjalayoga and Haṭhayoga within a vedāntic framework. The other compendiums discussed in this article support Bouy’s observations and extend his hypothesis to the region of Northeast India. Godāvaramiśra lived in what is now Orissa, Bhavadeva in Mithila and both Śivānanda and Sundaradeva in Varanasi. The vedāntic overtones in the works of these authors include references to the Upaniṣads and an emphasis on achieving the liberating gnosis of Brahman. Also, various prosopographic details associate them with Advaitavedānta. Godāvaramiśra’s father Balabhadra wrote a text called the Advaitacintāmaṇi and he himself the Advaitadarpaṇa,66 Śivānanda mentions Ādiśaṅkara in his lineage67 and, according to manuscript catalogues, Bhavadeva wrote a commentary on the Brahmasūtra. Unlike the Yoga Upaniṣads, their works explicitly cite Haṭhayoga texts. 

65 For information on Sundaradeva and his works, see Birch 2018a, 58–61. 

66 Yogacintāmaṇi (ms. no. 220 of 1882–1883) f. 131v. 

67 Yogacintāmaṇi p. 2: “Having bowed to Śrīvyāsa, the ascetic Śaṅkara, the teacher of the world, [my] teacher Śrīrāmacandra, whose lotus feet are intense bliss, and all of the gods of yogins, the ascetic Śivānanda has written clearly the great Yogacintāmaṇi, which had fallen into an ocean of various texts and has the power to explain everything” (śrīvyāsaṃ yatiśaṅkaraṃ bhavaguruṃ śrīrāmacandraṃ guruṃ sāndrānandapadāmbujañ ca nikhi lān natvā hi yogīśvarān | nānāgranthapayodhimadhyapatitaṃ śrīyogacintāmaṇiṃ niḥ śeṣārthasamarthakaṃ yatiśivānandaḥ karoti sphuṭam ||). 
 

haṭhayoga’s floruit 471 

In contrast to this, I am yet to locate any such compendium in Northwest India. However, some of the extended works on Haṭhayoga can be traced to this region, such as the Siddhāntamuktāvalī, the Haṭhapradīpikā with ten chapters and the Haṭhayogamañjarī. These works, along with the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati in Maharashtra and Karnataka, are less scholarly and more likely influenced by practitioners of the time in which they were composed. 

4 Conclusion 

The flourishing of literature on Haṭhayoga in both North and South India from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries was concomitant with a growing perva siveness of references, over the same period, to Haṭhayoga in Sanskrit literature of various religions and philosophies.68 The findings of this paper suggest that Haṭhayoga became more prevalent in literature composed during this period and that the Haṭhapradīpikā was instrumental in defining the techniques and structure of practice for this type of yoga. Moreover, distinct physical tech niques that became closely associated with Haṭhayoga, such as non-seated āsanas and mudrās, had become integral to broader conceptions of yoga on the eve of colonialism. 

In the period following the Haṭhapradīpikā, it is possible to discern that the praxis and theory of Haṭhayoga developed in different ways as it became more widely disseminated. In scholarly circles of Northeast India, its codifi cation took on some of the characteristics of the philosophical yogas, as it 

68 Beyond the texts I have mentioned above, the following literature of the sixteenth to eigh teenth centuries also integrated haṭhayogic teachings. I mention here only a few exam ples without detailed references, which will appear in a forthcoming publication. Exam ples include the Puraścaraṇacandrikā (late-fifteenth century) and the Puraścaraṇārṇava (eighteenth century), two Śaiva ritual compilations that incorporated verses on āsanas, some of which occur only in the Haṭhapradīpikā; the Merutantra, a relatively recent Śaiva work, which mentions Haṭhayoga in relation to prāṇāyāma; Rāmatoṣaṇa Bhaṭṭācārya’s Prāṇatoṣiṇī (1820CE), which has numerous references to Haṭhayoga; Narāyānatīrtha’s Yogasiddhāntacandrikā, a commentary on the Pātañjala Yogasūtra, which integrates fif teen yogas with Patañjali’s aṣṭāṅga format and defines Haṭhayoga as the auxiliaries of āsana and prāṇāyama; Vijñānabhikṣu’s Sāṅkhyasāra, a philosophical treatise that men tions both Haṭha- and Rājayoga; Narahari’s Bodhasāra, a philosophical compendium that has sections on Mantra-, Laya-, Haṭha- and Rājayoga; the Bhāvanāpuruṣottama, a San skrit drama in which a Kāpālika mentions haṭhavidyā as a ladder ascending to Rājayoga (in terms similar to those of the Haṭhapradīpikā); and the Vāsiṣṭhamahārāmāyaṇatāt paryaprakāśa, a commentary on the Yogavāsiṣṭha, which mentions both Haṭha- and Rājayoga, etc.

was integrated with the Pātañjalayogaśāstra and Brahmanical sources. This development resulted in a more syncretic and sophisticated discourse around the physical techniques. The social background of the authors of these com pendiums was diverse. Some were sannyāsins, such as Śivānandasarasvatī and Śrīsadāśivanārāyaṇabrahmacāri, whereas others identified themselves accord ing to their professions, which included medicine, politics and astronomy (i.e., Sundaradeva, Godāvaramiśra and Śrīnivāsa, respectively). 

In contrast to the scholarly compendiums of the northeast, the extended works on Haṭhayoga that arose in the northwest of India retained the more praxis-orientated focus of the Haṭhapradīpikā, which they enlarged upon by adding more techniques and other auxiliaries, such as yama and niyama. Although not much is known of the authors of these works, renunciant tradi tions in this region seemed reasonably active in producing manuals on yoga, such as the Haṭhayogamañjarī and the Jogapradīpyakā, and monographic works, such as the Yogāsanamālā and the Yogāsana, whose content is related to the Haṭhapradīpikā and its extended texts. 

From the Amaraughaprabodha to the current day, Haṭhayoga has been dis tinguished by physical methods of practice.In the early period the practice cen tred on breath retentions with physical locks (mudrā), and it burgeoned over the centuries to include an array of complex postures, ṣaṭkarma and mudrās. Although these physical techniques were never particular to Haṭhayoga, the textual evidence suggests that after the sixteenth century Haṭhayoga became a dominant paradigm for the practice of physical yoga across most of the Indian subcontinent, and this paradigm was significantly shaped by the content of the Haṭhapradīpikā. As outlined in this article, the floruit of Haṭhayoga was a period in which its techniques proliferated, particularly in praxis-orientated manuals, and its literature diversified as authors of various backgrounds, most notably erudite Brahmins, attempted to expand and integrate it with other yogas and different religions. By the eighteenth century, this extensive liter ary activity appears to have peaked, but the momentum behind it carried the notion of Haṭhayoga into the royal courts of Mysore and Jodhpur in the nine teenth century,69 and placed it firmly at the centre of the revival of postural practice in the twentieth century.70 

69 In the mid-nineteenth century, the Mahārāja of Mysore, Mummaḍi Kṛṣṇarāja Woḍeyar III, commissioned a royal compendium called the Śrītattvanidhi, which had a chap ter on āsanas that was based on the Haṭhābhyāsapaddhati (Birch 2018, 131–132). In the early nineteenth century, the Mahārāja of Marwar had built two temples in Jodhpur (the Mahāmandir and the Udai Mandir) with murals of eighty-four Siddhas in complex āsanas, many of which correspond to those in the Jogapradīpyakā (Bühnemann 2007, 102).

### 20 The Early Śaiva Maṭha: Form and Function 

Libbie Mills 

We should begin by determining what we think a maṭha to be in the early Śaiva context. In the seventh and eighth centuries, maṭhas began to receive royal patronage. By the ninth and tenth centuries maṭhas collected taxes and agri cultural profits (Sears 2014, 6). In the later period and in the south, maṭhas come to be a place for pilgrims passing through, or an institution for profes sional adepts, a place one might abide in on a hereditary basis. There is a rise in endowments for maṭhas in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with the head of the maṭha perhaps being the rājaguru, the royal guru, of the dominion, hence a figure of political importance (Nandi 1987, 194–195). 

But the maṭha of the earlier Śaiva world is at base something simpler. It is a place for an initiate to stay in for an extended period for the purposes of study, as an āśramin. It is housing for initiated students, with a guru offering teaching. Brunner-Lachaux (1998, 380), describing the situation as given in the Somaśambhupaddhati, tells us:“Celui dont Somaśambhu parle (et qu’il nomme āśrama en SP1, p. 316) est d’abord un lieu où vivent des initiés de différents grades, sous la conduite matérielle et spirituelle d’un guru.” This was not a shel ter for itinerant ascetics, not a locus of political power, but both a residence and a school for initiates or, in Sanderson’s (1988, 681) terms, a lodge for cult lineage members. 

Next, let us look more closely at these maṭha residents. The residents are initiated āśramins assigned, as Brunner-Lachaux described, into four levels according to their type of initiation. The samayin has received the samaya dīkṣā, the initiation for the pledge-holder or neophyte, and is qualified to study the teachings. The putraka has received the nirvāṇa dīkṣā and will thus be lib erated at the moment of death. The ācārya has received the consecration for officiants (ācārya abhiṣeka) and is qualified to teach and give dīkṣā. And the sādhaka has received the sādhaka abhiṣeka and is qualified to practice rituals in order to obtain supernatural powers. 

As we see stated at Mohacūrottara 4.243, all these initiates, at whatever their level, are further regarded as being veritable liṅgas, “markers” or sacred images, of Śiva. They are mobile ( jaṅgama)liṅgas, as opposed to the fixed (ajaṅgama or sthāvara) liṅgas which are images installed permanently in a temple. To estab lish either is an act of great piety:

saṃsthāpya sthāvaraṃ liṅgaṃ prāsāde yad bhavet phalam 

tat phalaṃ labhate vidvān maṭhe saṃsthāpya jaṅgamam 243 

The reward that a wise man gains from establishing a mobile image ( jaṅgamam liṅgam) [i.e. an ascetic] in a maṭha is the same as the reward that he gains from establishing a fixed image (sthāvaraṃ liṅgam) in a tem ple. (243) 

Having found the residents to be initiates of different types, all considered to be mobile liṅgas, let us think about their initiation into that role, and why one might build a maṭha for them. 

If the adept is a mobile liṅga, is, then, his dīkṣā (initiation) equivalent to the pratiṣṭhā (installation) of an immobile liṅga, an image in a temple? The matter has been considered by, among others, Hikita (2005, 193), and Mori (2005, 232); the latter observes that pratiṣṭhā brings the deity into a fixed liṅga, while dīkṣā does the same thing into a mobile one. As Mori (2005, 202– 203) notes from the twelfth-century Vajrāvalī of Abhayākaragupta: “and [the ācārya] carries out also the installation of an image, etc., like the installation of a disciple (śiṣyapratiṣṭhām iva pratimādipratiṣṭhāṃ kuryāt).” Mori goes on to demonstrate that “in actuality there are many correspondences between the installation and consecration ceremonies.” Given that dīkṣā (initiation of an adept) and pratiṣṭhā (installation of an image) are parallel processes, the place of installation, the home for the initiate, is important, just as the temple, the shelter for a fixed image, is a place of consequence. 

If the place has consequence, then there should be a reward from its estab lishment. An immobile liṅga is installed in a private shrine for the benefit of the commissioning sādhaka.What of the installation of a mobile liṅga, an adept, in a maṭha? Who benefits from that? What is the incentive? As we saw above, the Mohacūrottara states at 4.243 that the installation of a mobile liṅga in a maṭha brings merit to the patron who commissions and funds it. So we here move on from the idea of installation of an immobile liṅga in the private shrine, for the benefit of the sādhaka patron, to something else, to a liṅga that can move about, but must still be installed and housed, bringing reward to the patron who houses it. 

In looking for accounts of this housing for adepts, I am drawing upon six early Śaiva records, the same six on which Professor Sanderson worked with me some two decades ago (for a study published recently as Mills 2019): the Kiraṇa, Devyāmata, Piṅgalāmata, Bṛhatkālottara, Mayasaṃgraha, and Mohacūrottara. I will go through what we can learn about the maṭha from these texts. We will find the most useful material in the Mohacūrottara (10th- or 11th-century) and 
 

the early śaiva maṭha 485 

Devyāmata (in which the prāsādalakṣaṇa material shows signs of being sub stantially earlier; see Mills 2019). 

1 Housing in General 

To begin, I should give a very brief outline of how these texts describe building plans for houses in general: normal housing, not maṭhas in particular. The texts give accounts of the elevation, the vertical design, that are easily followed. But descriptions of the plan, the horizontal design, rely on some basic background knowledge, which I now supply. 

Measurements are made in hastas, hands, a measure from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger of the patron. Those measurements are checked for their āya. The āyas are formulae used to test measurements, to ensure that they are suitable for use. A common presentation is of six sets of āyas: āya, vyaya, ṛkṣa, yoni, vāra, and tithi or aṃśa. There are 12 āyas in a list of items beginning with siddhi; 10 vyayas in a list of items beginning with śikhara; 27 ṛkṣas in a list of the nakṣatras; 8 yonis in the list of 8 that is dhvaja, etc.; 7 vāras in a list of the days of the week; 30 tithis in a list of the lunar days in a month; and 9 aṃśas in a list of items beginning with taskara. In each list, some members are regarded as auspicious, some as inauspicious. 

The measurement to be tested is multiplied by a set number. The product of that multiplication is then divided by the number of items in the āya set. The remainder is checked against the corresponding āya in the set to determine whether the measurement is suitable or not. Let me give an example: in the yoni āya list, the listed yonis are numbered from 1 to 8. Dhvaja (flag) is 1, dhūma (smoke) is 2,siṃha (lion) is 3,śvan (dog) is 4, vṛṣabha (bull) is 5, khara (donkey) is 6, gaja (elephant) is 7 and khaga (bird) is 8. The yonis with an odd number are regarded as auspicious. Those with an even number are considered inauspi cious. A measurement to be checked against the yoni āyas is multiplied by the number 3. The product is then divided by the number of yonis, 8. If the remain der is 1, the yoni āya for that measurement is dhvaja, which is auspicious; if it is 2, the yoni āya for that measurement is dhūma, which is inauspicious, and so on. Each yoni āya, from dhvaja onward, is associated with a planet, and also with the cardinal and intermediate directions from the east onwards in a clock wise direction, according to the positions assigned to those planets. Below, we will see these associations used to indicate directions in house construction. 

Moving now from measurements to design, the plan for the construction is always in the form of a square. That square is divided into a grid of cells (padas), with the same number of cells along each side. In the pattern that we

will see here, the pattern for the construction of housing, as opposed to tem ples or funerary grounds or other things, there are 9 cells along each side of the square, producing a grid of 81 cells in total. See figure 20.1 as an example from the Bṛhatkālottara of such a configuration. Once these padas have been laid out, deities are installed in them. In the most common pattern 45 deities are installed. 32 of those deities are placed in the 32 padas around the outer edges of the plan, and 13 deities are placed inside that framework, with Brahmā at

the very centre. When building houses, particular attention is paid to the con sequences of a doorway placed at any of the 32 padas around the periphery. See figure 20.2 for an example of an account of doorway consequences, again from the Bṛhatkālottara. 

This fundamental 9-by-9-part deity map is used as the basis for plans of greater or lesser complexity. For housing, we will see descriptions of three types of design. 

2 Type 1: The 9-by-9 pura 

The most involved, which I will call type 1, is the design for a 9-by-9-part pura, a residential complex for a community and its lead figure. That lead figure might be a king or a lesser noble, an important functionary such as a general, or a guru. Other members of the community and all the functions of community life are arranged on the 81 cells of the 9-by-9 plan just described, with careful specifications as to what should be placed in each cell of the periphery in par ticular. 

Here is an account of a type 1 complex from the Mayasaṃgraha, 5.156–159 and 181–187 (between verses 159 and 181, the text digresses to describe maṇḍa pas and column types):

This record lists a place for worship at Īśa; music at Parjanya; ritual bathing and offering at Jayanta; a gateway at Indra, Sūrya and Satya (marubhṛnmukhe traye); the kitchen at Bhṛśa, Antarikṣa and Agni (bhṛśāditritaye); eating vessels at Pūṣan; a water tank at Vitatha; a store room at Gṛhakṣata; a place for ascetics to achieve contemplation of the self (saṃyāmināṃ sthānam ātmālokanasid dhaye) at Yama; singers at Gandharva; a place for teaching the śāstras (vyākhyā nasaṃśrayaḥ) at Bhṛṅga; bathing at Mṛga; toilets at Pitṛ (koṇe); betel, etc., at Dauvārika; food storage at Sugrīva, Puṣpadanta and Pracetas; a room for visitors at Asura and Śoṣa; tools at Roga (ruji); perfumes at Vāyu (gandhavahe); flowers at Nāga, Mukhya and Bhalvāṭa (ahitraye); the treasury at Soma and Ṛgi (soma dvaye); and a school (vidyādhāma) at Aditi and Diti (aditidvaye). Within this framework, at Brahmā, etc., are a temple and maṇḍapa. At Gṛhakṣata, Yama, Gandharva and Bhṛṅga, a maṭha is introduced as an alternative at 184ab. 

3 Type 2: The 5-by-5 nandyāvarta / nandikāvarta 

A second design, somewhat less elaborate, is termed the nandyāvarta or nandi kāvarta. This serves as a simpler residence to house higher-ups—nobility, army generals, and gurus—and their households. In this case, laid over the funda mental 9-by-9-part deity map is a building design of 5 parts by 5 parts, with spacing between chambers that produces an array of nine chambers in total, or eight if the central position is left undesignated. Each of the eight or nine chambers is assigned a function. See figure 20.3 for some examples of these 5- by-5 designs.

This account lists the eight chambers of the nandikāvarta for a cumbaka as follows: the assembly chamber is in the east, the sleeping quarters are in the south, the dining hall in the west, the treasury in the north, the kitchen is in the southeast, the lavatory in the southwest, the granary in the northwest, and the shrine in the northeast. For each chamber, the correct āya proportion is assigned. 

4 Type 3: The house with four, three, two, or one rooms 

The third, lowest, level of complexity produces housing for normal citizens, graded according to either caste or initiation class. Here we see a design, again laid over the basic 9-by-9 deity map, for a residence with only four rooms, or three, two, or one, in descending order according to levels of caste or initia tion. 

An example of a type 3 presentation for different initiation levels is given at Piṅgalāmata 10.93–95 and 114c–128 (verses 96–114b cover the Nandikāvarta, as seen above):

In verse 10.95 we are told that the house for an ācārya has four rooms, that for a sādhaka has three, and that for a putraka has two, while the samayin has one room. The verses from 114cd onward describe the four-roomed, three-roomed, two-roomed and one-roomed house. In the case of the four-roomed one, rec ommended for the cumbaka when money is wanting, we are given an account of the rooms at 115cd–116ab. The shrine is in the east, the kitchen and bedroom are in the south, the vessel store and dining room are in the west, and the uten sils and treasury are in the north. In the case of the three-roomed house for the sādhaka, we are told that there may be a room lacking in the north or in the east, but not in the south or in the west. The house with no room in the north

is termed the hiraṇyanābha, while that without a room to the east is termed a suprabhāvartaka. In the case of the 2-roomed and 1-roomed house, the direc tion of the rooms is described in terms of the 8 āya direction associations, from dhvaja in the east onwards in a clockwise rotation. 

5 Maṭhas 

Having looked at accounts of construction of housing in general, in types 1, 2 and 3, we now are ready to look at what the texts have to say about maṭhas in particular. The Bṛhatkālottara and Kiraṇa give details on the design of tem ples and also on the construction of domestic buildings for different members of society, from kings down to ordinary caste members. But these texts do not refer to a maṭha or anything that could be understood as a maṭha. 

The Mayasaṃgraha mentions the maṭha, but quite briefly. As we saw above, Mayasaṃgraha 5.156–159 and 181–187 describes the pura on a 9-by-9-plan, list ing the uses to which each of the 32 padas around the outskirts of the plan is put: kitchen, storage areas, armories, meeting rooms, etc., in a type 1 design. On reaching those padas at the centre of the south side, the text tells us that: 

dhanuḥkhaḍgaśarādīni vidadhyāt tu gṛhakṣate 

yame saṃyamināṃ sthānam ātmālokanasiddhaye 182 

gandharve gāyakasthānaṃ bhṛṅge vyākhyānasaṃśrayaḥ 183ab 

… 

maṭhaṃ vā vipulaṃ kuryād gṛhakṣatacatuṣṭaye 184cd 

At Gṛhakṣata one should set up [a storeroom for] bows, arrows, swords, and other weapons. At Yama there should be a place for ascetics to achieve contemplation of the self (saṃyāmināṃ sthānam ātmālokanasid dhaye). Singers are stationed at Gandharva. At Bhṛṅga is a hall for the exposition [of the śāstras]. Or one may construct a large maṭha on the four [positions] which are Gṛhakṣata and [Yama, Gandharva and Bhṛṅga]. 

Here, the Mayasaṃgraha is giving the maṭha as an option, to be placed on the south edge of a pura, as an alternative to a combination of items: weapons, ascetics, singers, and a space for teaching. Why here, on the south side? Bakker (2004,118) has pointed out that the south, a direction associated with the inaus picious, with death, is also viewed as being the benign right side of the deity or guru as he faces east. Thus it is a suitable position for the initiate, at the right side of the deity or guru. 
 

the early śaiva maṭha 495 

The Piṅgalāmata, in chapter 10, verses 3–77, in describing a 9-by-9 type pura, lists the uses to which each of the 32 padas all around the outskirts of the plan are used. In verses 33–36 the Piṅgalāmata, like the Mayasaṃgraha, places the maṭha on the south side, at the padas of Yama and Gandharva. 

yame gandharvake kuryān maṭhaṃ bhūmitrayānvitam 33cd 

athavā dvayasārdhaṃ tu bhūmikaikāthavā priye 

uttamaṃ madhyamaṃ caiva kanyasaṃ ca yathākramam 34 

ācāryasya tad evoktaṃ nijaṃ śayanahetukam 

iṣṭāhnikaṃ jayaṃ dhyānaṃ yogābhyāsaṃ tu tatra vai 35 

vīrabhojyānnapānādyair vīraiḥ saha samācaret 36ab 

My dear, at Yama and Gandharva one should make a maṭha with three storeys, two [storeys] or one storey. [These are] the best, middling and least [maṭhas] in turn. That is the place for the ācārya to sleep, for [prog nostication of] auspicious days, triumph, meditation, and the practice of yoga. [There the teacher] may associate with vīras (vīraiḥ saha), sharing vīra food and drink, etc.33 

Altogether, so far, from the Piṅgalāmata and Mayasaṃgraha, we have learned that the maṭha is generally placed in the south. The Mohacūrottara and Devyā mata give more information on the nature of the construction itself. The Mohacūrottara uses the term maṭha. The Devyāmata does not. 

First let us look at what the Mohacūrottara has to say. At Mohacūrottara 4.234–243 we get a more detailed depiction of the maṭha: 

maṭhaś cāntakadigbhāge liṅgināṃ sthitaye hitaḥ 

yatas te dakṣiṇāśāyāṃ vaseyuḥ śivabhāvitāḥ 234 

prāsādavistaraṃ sūtraṃ tanmānaṃ jagatībahiḥ 

prākāraṃ kārayet tyaktvā tataś cāśramiṇāṃ gṛham 235 

maṭhāgre tatsamaṃ tyaktvā siṃhāyaṃ dakṣiṇe sthitam 

vṛṣāyaṃ34 paścime jñeyaṃ dhvajāyaṃ35 pūrvataḥ sthitam 236

33 Shaman Hatley notes that “Vīra likely refers to sādhakas: ‘heroic sādhakas’ might be a good rendering. Vīrapāna refers to impure liquids such as alcohol, used in rituals of the Bhairava- and Kulatantras.”

And a maṭha for ascetics to stay in (liṅgināṃ sthitaye) should be in the south. For they, as devotees of Śiva, should reside to the right [of Śiva]. (4.234) 

One should build a wall (prākāram) at a distance 1 temple-width beyond the temple base ( jagatī). At a distance from there (tyaktvā tataḥ) is the housing for ascetics (āśramiṇāṃ gṛhaṃ). (4.235) 

In front of the maṭha (maṭhāgre), leaving a distance of the same [size] (tatsamaṃ tyaktvā), [houses should be built that are sized according to] the siṃhāya in the south, the vṛṣāya in the west, and the dhvajāya in the east. (4.236) 

Or they may be made as large as the patron wishes. They are on a square site divided into five [parts along each side]. One should leave the intermediate spaces empty (madhyaṃ tyaktvā vilopayet). (4.237) 

The installation of the houses is according to the wishes [of the patron]. There should be a [door for] entry and exit to the north. [The houses] may have one, two, or three floors, or as is pleasing. (4.238) 

Externally, [the building] is surrounded by a long hall (śālā). In the eastern side of the building is the place for worship ( yāgālaya). One should install the kitchen and so forth as appropriate. (4.239) 

At a distance of 1½-times the previously given distance, and half that, as is suitable, is a single maṭhikā, in the form of a set of four (catuṣkikā) awnings (paṭṭaśālā). (4.240) 

36 240a sārdhaṃ ]em. Sanderson; sārdhaṃ Ātmārthapūjāpaddhati; cārddhaṃ FH 37 242c etad ] H; tad F 
 

The storeys (bhūmi) are as have already been taught. If money is lacking, a hut (kuṭī) is approved. (4.241ab) 

One should build the dwelling for ascetics with the same measurements and a good design, [and] performing the veneration of the site (vās tupūjā), out of a desire to attain great merit. I will now describe to you this great merit in full. (4.241cd–242) 

The reward gained from establishing a mobile image ( jaṅgamaṃ liṅgam) [i.e., an ascetic] in a maṭha is the same as the reward gained from establishing a fixed image (sthāvaraṃ liṅgam) in a temple. 

(4.243) 

So, here, we seem to have a maṭha housing complex to the south of the temple, bracketed to the east, south and west by actual residences. Verse 237 indicates that each individual residence is of the 5-by-5 type 2 variety. The term maṭhikā is introduced, referring to a set of 4 awnings, and a simple hut, kuṭī is given as a cheaper alternative. 

And, finally, in Devyāmata, chapter 105 we are given another account of the residencefor initiates. The terms usedfor the residence are gṛha (verses1,15,17), āśrama (verses 15, 17), and veśman (verse 41). The term maṭha is not used. The terms used for the residents of these domiciles are āśramin (verse 1), prāsādāś ramin (verse 82), dīkṣita (verses 16, 17), gṛhin, and gṛhamedhin (verse 72). In verses 15–19b is given an account of the residence (gṛha) for the initiate (dīk ṣita), outside the temple exterior wall and to the south of the temple: 

dakṣiṇāyāṃ diśi śastaṃ gṛham āyatanasya tu 

prākārasya bahiḥ kāryam āśramāyatanasya tu38 15

A residence (gṛham) is recommended to the south of the temple. The residence (āśramam) should be built beyond the outer wall of the temple. (15) 

38 Sanderson, by email communication, points out that the sense intended is certainly āśra mam āyatanasya tu.

It is to be dwelt in by initiates (dīkṣitaiḥ), their senses well-subordinated, who have come to (āśṛtya) the image (liṅgam). Or, in its absence (tadabhāve), [they should dwell in] another pleasant place (pradeśe sumanorame). (16) 

The residence (āśramam) for the initiates (dīkṣitātmanām) should be built not too far from water. Initiates (dīkṣitātmabhiḥ) should live in a fine, unpolluted place. (17) 

The residence (gṛham) should have one, two, or three rooms. Or a four roomed residence should be built, according to funding. (18) 

A pleasing hiraṇyanābha or sukṣetra39 may be built. (19ab) 

In verse 18, the housing described is of type 3. In verses 54–74b the conse quences of a doorway at each of the peripheral padas of the 9 by 9 deity map are given in some detail:

39 As recorded, for example, in Bṛhatkālottara, prāsādalakṣaṇapaṭala 223–224 and Kiraṇa 19.18–19, the hiraṇyanābha is a building with three rooms, in the east, west and south, and the sukṣetra is a building with three rooms, in the west, south and north. At Piṅgalāmata 10.118–119 (above), the building without a room in the north is termed a hiraṇyanābha, while that without a room to the east is termed a suprabhāvartaka.

Thus, in due sequence, the consequences (phalam) of doorways are given. [With a doorway] at Īśa, the householder will have the risk of fire; at Parjanya, harm from women. (54) 

At Jaya [the householder] is endowed with wealth. At Māhendra he is dear to the king. At Āditya there is anger. At Satya there is lawful con duct. (55) 

At Bhṛśa is awfulness. And at Ambara there is theft. At Agni there is a lack of sons. At Pūṣan is servitude. (56)

At Vitatha the householder comes to a lack of decorum, at Gṛhakṣata he gains wisdom. At Yama he attains savagery. At Gāndharva he acquires glory. (57) 

At Bhṛṅgarāja there is malady. At Mṛga one is oppressed by the king. The set of 8 doorways have been described to you, in the house facing south. (58) 

Next it will be specifically described for the house facing west. In the west, at the Pitṛdeva position, the householder will be oppressed by his sons. (59) 

There is an increase in the enemy and his knowledge at Dauvārika. At Sugrīva is always an increase of wealth for the householder. (60) 

At Puṣpadantaka is a gain in sons, wealth and power. At Vāruṇa is an increase in wealth. At Asura is danger from the king. (61) 

There is loss of wealth at Śoṣa and disease at Pāpayakṣman. Eight deities have been listed, in the house facing west. (62) 

Those facing north are listed next, in sequence, from the northwest (vāyavya) on. At Roga is bondage. At Nāga (Vāsuki) is an enemy. (63) At Mukhya is an increase in sons and wealth. At Bhalvāṭa is gain. At Soma is a gain in wealth. At Anantaka is heroism in sons. (64) 

At Aditi is trouble from women. At Diti is poverty. Specifically listed with their own deities are those doorways which are especially good. Listen with care. The third one, named Jaya, brings great power and wealth. (65–66) 

The fourth one, named Māhendra, fulfills every desire for the house holder. The fourth one in the house facing south, Gṛhakṣata, 

increases food, drink and sons for householders. The sixth one, called Gandhārva, brings glory, pleasures and contentment. (67–68) 

The second set of doorways has been declared, on the south side. On the west side, the third doorway (i.e., at Sugrīva) brings an increase in wealth. (69) 

The fourth, called Puṣpadanta, increases sons, power and strength. The fifth doorway, Vāruṇa, brings increased wealth for men. (70) 

The third set of doorways has been declared, on the west side. And on the north side, the doorway governed by Mukhya brings an increase in wealth, sons and property to householders. The fourth one, named Bhalvāṭa, gives men every desire. (71–72) 

The fifth one, whose deity is Soma, brings an increase in wealth. After learning the features of doorways as described, specifically, the wise man should carefully establish a doorway with ample good qualities. (73–74ab) 
 

the early śaiva maṭha 501 

One should note that, while these are the consequences for doorway posi tions in a residence for ascetics, the consequences do not fall on the ascetic residents themselves, but on the patron who commissions and funds the build ing of the residence, and who gains the benefit from it.48 So, the consequences are not in any way to be connected to the lives of the residents. None-the-less, it is worth noting that these are the same consequences that we see repeated over and again for domestic buildings of all sorts. The model that is being used is that for normal housing. 

The portion from 81 to 86 describes the layout of the residence (gṛha) for the prāsādāśramin: 

gṛhaṃ niṣpādayed yatnād yathokta49lakṣaṇānvitam 

antaradiśvibhāgaṃ ca gṛhaprāsādayos tataḥ 81 

uktaṃ yathākrameṇaiva prāsādāśramiṇāṃ gṛham

gṛhasyāvāhṛtaṃ kāryam avaśyakāraṇaṃ gṛham 

pūrveṇa vanaṣaṇḍaṃ tu tathā puṣpaphaladrumāḥ 86 

One should carefully arrange the residence (gṛham) in such a way that is has the characteristics that have been taught. Then [one should arrange] the area in between (antaradiśvibhāgam) the residence and temple. (81) 

The residence for those who come to the temple (prāsādāśrami ṇām) is described in due sequence. In the southeast is the kitchen (mahānasam). In the northeast is the space for worship ( yāgamaṇḍa pam). (82) 

Storage for gems, gold and cloths (ratnahiraṇyavastrāṇām) is recom mended in the east, and for water in the south and centre.51 (83) 

48 I thank Shaman Hatley for this observation.

Grain storage (dhānyānām) is recommended in the west. In the north west is storage for the mortar (udūkhalasya). (84) 

To the north is general storage (sarvavastuṣpadānām). Not too far away (nātidūram), nor adjoining (na cāsannam), is a secluded (pracchan nam), sheltered (parivāritam) (85) 

lavatory building (avaśyakāraṇaṃ gṛham), aside from the residence (gṛhasyāvāhṛtam). To the east (pūrveṇa) should be made a copse (vanaṣaṇḍam), and trees with flowers and fruit (puṣpaphaladrumāḥ). (86) 

This is an account of a type 2 nandikāvarta type of construction, with 8 rooms on a 5-by-5 plan. 

From verse 87 on we get a detailed description of the trees for the surround ing gardens. Then the chapter ends: 

kathitaṃ saviśeṣeṇa gṛham āśramiṇāṃ tava52 94cd 

antaraṃ diśvibhāgaṃ ca prāsādagṛhayor drumān 

prākāraḥ svapramāṇena prāsādānāṃ prakīrtitaḥ 95

gṛhād udyānaparyastaṃ prākāreṇa samanvitam 98 

tat sarvaṃ samudāyena kartavyaṃ samudāhṛtam 99ab 

iti gṛhavāstupaṭalaḥ 

The residence (gṛham) for the āśramins has been described to you in particular; (94cd) 

and [also] the intervening (antaram) area (diśvibhāgam) between the temple and residence (prāsādagṛhayoḥ), and trees. The surround ing wall (prākāraḥ), with its measurements, has been described for temples. (95) 

The pleasing garden (udyānam) beyond the surrounding wall has been described. The garden too is to be surrounded by a wall (prākāraveṣṭi tam). (96) 

find support in the fact that, in verse 22 of this chapter, we were informed that the water supply should be in the centre of the house (gṛhamadhye). 

52 94d tava]em.; bhavaḥ MW 
 

the early śaiva maṭha 503 

As before, the surrounding wall should be made straight, well erected and level. My dear, having established the subsidiary shrines (parivār ālayāḥ) beyond the wall, (97) 

everything should be made thus, complete, and in due sequence. Beyond the residence, it is surrounded by a garden and has a sur rounding wall. Everything to be done has been altogether declared. (98–99ab) 

Thus ends the chapter on the residence. 

Looking back over what we have seen, in the Bṛhatkālottara and Kiraṇawe saw no mention of a maṭha, but from the Mayasaṃgraha and Piṅgalāmata came the information that the maṭha should be on the south side. When it came to details of the maṭha design, we saw in the Mohacūrotttara and Devyāmata descriptions that looked very much like those for houses for any other person, in types 2 and 3, to the south of a type 1 complex. 

We have been looking at the building designs for clues as to what went on inside them, following the sensible line of thinking of Sears (2014, 76), who writes, “the architecture of the monastery indexes the concerns of its residen tial community.” But perhaps all we have learned from the building designs for the maṭha is that dorms are dorms, in the end. While the installation of a jaṅgama liṅga, an initiate, is equal in merit to the installation of an ajaṅgama liṅga, an image, there is by no means the same glamour in its housing. This proves to be a practical domestic establishment entirely like that of an alto gether ordinary person who is not initiated—not a jaṅgama liṅga. 

Acknowledgment 

My gratitude to Professor Sanderson is enormous. His guidance is invaluable in many ways, but I will point out just two. On the one hand there is his stern search for error in the material, on the other is his patient tolerance of error in the student—a tolerance that I put to some pretty severe testing, of course. None of this work would have been possible without it.

### 21 Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā
The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta and its Parallels in the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras 

Ryugen Tanemura 

1 Introduction 

Most people think that the prominent features of Tantric religions are their esoteric teachings. This might mislead us into supposing that these religions were limited to restricted communities. But in fact these religions extended over a much wider domain.We see this if we consider the fact that both Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism offered a wide range of public social rituals.1 Following 

1 Sanderson proposes that what kept Śaivism alive, and enabled it to exert its influence, was ritual for others, as the professional activity of officiants who operated outside the narrow confines of self-cultivation (Sanderson 2010, 12). 

Generally speaking, rituals for others, i.e. rituals performed for the benefit of donors, were formed through modification of rituals for personal salvation. In the case of Tantric Buddhism, the pratiṣṭhā ritual is a modification of the utpattikrama practice. See the fol lowing three quotations: Ratnākaraśānti’s Bhramahara: tasyānandina āsyena dvihoḥkāravi darbhitam | jvalad bījadvayaṃ rāgāt padmāntaḥ praviśad dravet || tato vajrī mahārāgād vilīya saha vidyayā |śaraccandradravanibhāṃ tiṣṭhen maṇḍalatāṃ gataḥ || athotthānāya taṃ devyaḥ sthitvā koṇāsanenduṣu | codayeyuś catasṛbhiś catasro vajragītibhiḥ || (Isaacson 2002, 162, lines 9–15); Vajrāvalī (abhiṣeka section): tais tathāgataiḥ prajñāsamāpannair mahārā geṇa dravībhūya vairocanadvāreṇāntarniviśya vajramārgeṇa nirgatya taddravair devīpadme mukhena praveśitaṃ śiṣyaṃ jhaṭiti śūnyatānantaraṃ hūṃvajrajātasaprajñākṣobhyarūpiṇaṃ jñānasattvābhinnam abhiṣicya punar bhujamukhādimūrtibhiḥ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtya gaganam āpūrya sthitair locanādividyāsahitaiś chatradhvajapatākāvastravāditragī tanṛtyapuṣpakuṅkumādivṛṣṭibhiḥ karakiśalayāvarjitabodhicittāmṛtapūrṇasitakalaśais taṃ śi ṣyaṃ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtam abhiṣicyamānaṃ … (EM §24.2, vol. 2, p. 341, lines 6–11); Vajrāvalī (pratiṣṭhā section): taiś ca tathāgataiḥ prajñāsamāpannair mahārāgeṇa dravībhūya svasya vairocanadvāreṇa praviśya vajramārgeṇa nirgatya taddravair devīpadme mukhena praveśitaṃ pratimādikam abhiṣicya punar bhujamukhādimūrtibhiḥ *padmān (corr.; padmāt EM) niḥsṛtya bahir ambaram āpūrya sthitair locanādividyāsahitaiś cchatrapatākānṛ tyagītavāditrakusumakuṅkumādivṛṣṭiparikaritakarakiśalayāvarjitabodhicittāmṛtapūrṇasita kalaśais tat pratimādikaṃ padmād bahir niḥsṛtam abhiṣicyamānaṃ … (EM §17.3, vol. 2, p. 416, line 17–p. 417, line 2). The first passage quoted from the Bhramahara teaches how the practi tioner should generate himself as Hevajra in the First Union (ādiyoga). The practitioner, who has the form of the seed syllables, should enter the womb of Nairātmyā, Hevajra’s consort, through Hevajra’s mouth, become liquid (i.e. the state of śūnyatā), be emitted outside the

Śaiva models, Tantric Buddhism offered various kinds of consecration cere monies (pratiṣṭhā).2 Śaivism produced Paddhatis and Pratiṣṭhātantras3 which teach the details of these public social rituals. Tantric Buddhism also produced a number of manuals which are closely comparable to Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras and Paddhatis. Of these, three manuals are particularly rich in information: the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta, the Vajrāvalī of Abhayākaragupta, and the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya of Jagaddarpaṇa or Darpaṇācārya, which incorporates much of the Vajrāvalī but adds some new materials (Sanderson 2009, 126–127, note 293). 

The purpose of this paper is to present a variety of Śaiva parallels in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, especially textual parallels between the Kriyāsaṃgra 

womb, and have the form of Hevajra. The second passage quoted from Vajrāvalī teaches how the master should visualise the initiand in the udakābhiṣeka. The master should visualise that the initiand is made to enter the womb of the goddess, becomes liquid (śūnyatā), and is emit ted outside the womb. This is a modification of the meditation in the utpattikrama practice. The third passage quoted from Vajrāvalī teaches how the officiant should visualise the deity of the image in the udakābhiṣeka of the pratiṣṭhā. The same method as the second passage is applied here. For the relationship between the utpattikrama practice and the pratiṣṭhā in Tantric Buddhism, see Tanemura 2004, 85–90. 

2 For the parallel repertoire of rituals between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism, see Sanderson 2009, 124–127. To add some more information about the manuals of the Tantric Buddhist funeral rite (given on p. 126, note 294), after the publication of Sanderson 2009, I published a critical edition of and notes on Śūnyasamādhivajra’s Mṛtasugatiniyojana (Tanemura 2013a), an annotated Japanese translation of the same text (Tanemura 2013b), and a preliminary edition and annotated Japanese translation of the Antasthitikarmoddeśa of Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā (Tanemura 2012). The visualisation taught in verses 12–13 of the Mṛtasuga tiniyojana is a modification of the mṛtasaṃjīvana practice elaborated in commentaries on the Guhyasamājatantra, which are classified as works of Jñānapāda school in the Tibetan canon. The utkrānti (intentional death of a yogin) is applied to the visualisations taught in verses 14–16. 

3 Sanderson proposes that the fundamental reason for Śaivism’s success was “that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key elements of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval period (Sander son 2009, 253).” With regard to the second element, the proliferation of land-owing tem ples, “[t]he Śaivas of the Mantramārga provided specialized officiants and rituals to estab lish these Śivas [= Liṅgas], developing in the course of time a secondary body of scriptural authorities, the Pratiṣṭhātantras, devoted exclusively to this domain, setting out the rituals of installation (pratiṣṭhā) and defining the norms for the form of the Liṅga, the iconogra phy of ancillary images, and the architectural design of the various temple types” (Sanderson 2009, 274; the word in square brackets is supplied by the present author). The characteris tics of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are very close to those of the Pratiṣṭhātantras mentioned above. With regard to the contents of the whole Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, see Tanemura 2004, 12–42.

hapañjikā and the Devyāmata, a Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra, as materials to consider concerning the relations between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

2 Rituals in the Public Domain 

First, I would like to present parallels at the scriptural level between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. Just as in Śaivism, where the Saiddhāntika religion, which non-Saiddhāntikas considered to be a fundamental but exoteric and lower Śaiva teaching, is involved in the rituals in the public domain,4 so too the ritual system of the consecration ceremonies prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgra hapañjikā is based on the Yogatantras (more precisely, the Vajradhātumaṇḍala system prescribed in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha, the principal scrip ture of the Yogatantra class), which was considered to be the Vajrayāna’s fun damental authority by the “higher,” more esoteric tantras, i.e. Yogottara- and Yoginītantras.5 

4 For this non-Saiddhāntika view on the Saiddhāntika religion, see, e.g., Sanderson 2007, 231. On the public character of the Saiddhāntika religion, see, e.g., Sanderson 2007, 238–239 and Sanderson 2014, 13. 

5 For instance, the Sūtaka(-melāpaka) (commonly known as “Caryāmelāpakapradīpa,” which is not attested in Sanskrit primary sources) calls the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha the “root tantra.” See Sūtakamelāpaka (chapter 3 Vāgviveka): vajragurur āha—sādhu sādhu mahāsatt va śrītattvasaṃgrahādau mūlatantre cottaratantre ca vāyutattvaṃ na vispaṣṭenoktam, saṃ dhyāyabhāṣitatvāt (EW p. 375, lines 13–15); vajragurur āha—sādhu sādhu mahāsattva mantra tattvaṃ nāma tattvasaṃgrahādau mūlatantre cottaratantre ca kevalaṃ mantramātram udī ritaṃ mantroddhāro na pradarśitaḥ (EW p. 378, lines 13–15). That the system of the Yogatantra is the Vajrayāna’s fundamental authority might also be implied by the following verse of the Saṃvarodayatantra (21.2):sāmānyayogatantrānāṃrahasyaṃ na vipañcitam|siddhīnāṃ paramā siddhir vratnānāṃ paramaṃ vratam || (ET p. 134). 

That the system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha is employed for rituals in the public domain is inferred from the fact that the fundamental system of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is the Vajradhātumaṇḍala (See the citation from the Kalaśādhivāsanā section of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā below). 

The verses quoted below from Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā suggest that the rituals prescribed in his manual, which are performed in public, are based on the Sarvatathā gatatattvasaṃgraha. See Padmaśrīmitra’s Maṇḍalopāyikā 2.39–41: ādāv arghavidhiḥ proktaḥ dvitīye bhūparigrahaḥ | tṛtīyaṃ *ṭippa(em.; tippa- Ms.)sūtraṃ tu jñānasūtraṃ caturthakam ||2.39|| pañcamo rajasāṃ pātaḥ ṣaṣṭhaṃ kalaśādhivāsanam | saptamaḥ kalaśanyāso maṇ ḍalasādhanam aṣṭamam ||2.40|| pratiṣṭhā navamī caiva daśamī homakriyā matā | ekādaśī visṛṣṭiḥ syād ity uktaṃ tattvasaṃgrahe ||2.41|| (2r7–8). The eleven rituals from the arghavidhi to the visṛṣṭi mentioned in the above-quoted verses are rituals related to the pratiṣṭhā (cf. the structure of the rituals prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, for which see Tanemura 2004, Introduction). The phrase “taught in the (Sarvatathāgata-)Tattvasaṃgraha” does not

The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā as a whole is a kind of construction manual for monasteries, and the author Kuladatta teaches details of various kinds of rituals within this framework.6 In chapter 2, having examined the site for a monastery and removed from the site extraneous substances that cause vari ous calamities, the officiant (ācārya) should visualise the site, which has been divided into eighty-one compartments, as the Vajradhātumaṇḍala. He should visualise Vairocana in the centre and the other deities in the rest of the com partments. In chapter 3, the officiant should prepare water jugs which are to be used in the ritual. These water jugs represent the deities of the Vajradhātumaṇ ḍala, and he should draw the symbols of the deities on them. In the pratiṣṭhā of images, although images (or rather the deities of images) go through the brah manical life cycle rites, they are sprinkled with water from the water jugs which represent the deities of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala. 

The fact that the system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala is fundamental is implied by the following remarks of Kuladatta.7 

(1) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Kalaśādhivāsanā in chapter 3: 

yasyācāryasya vajradhātau nādhimokṣas tasya sveṣṭadevatādhimokṣeṇa bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyanteṣu sarvakriyākaraṇam aviruddham.8 Tanemura 2004, 135 

necessarily mean that the scripture prescribes the eleven rituals listed in the verses, probably only that the mantra-visualisation system employed in those rituals is that of the Vajradhātu maṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha. (Cf. Kimiaki Tanaka’s understanding of the words from ādau to visṛṣṭiḥ syāt as being directly quoted by Padmaśrīmitra from the scripture; see Tanaka 2010, 562.) For instance, the samayawhich the officiant causes the deity of the images to listen to is “oṃ hūṃ trāḥ hrīḥ aḥ,” the syllables of the Five Buddhas of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala (9r9).

7 After the publication of Tanemura 2004, I was able to access the following two manuscripts of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. N2: Kaiser Library Access No. 109; N3: NGMPP E365/12 (private collection). I report on the readings of these manuscripts when I quote the texts from Tane mura 2004. With regard to N2, the first forty-five leaves, of which the material is paper, are a later addition to the original palm-leaf manuscript. The leaves before folio 35 of the origi nal palm-leaf manuscript have been lost. The original manuscript was copied in samvat 336. According to Petech, the date of copying is verified for Thursday, February 11th, 1216 (Petech 1984, 81).With regard to N2,I report only on the readings of the original palm-leaf manuscript. 

8 Mss. N2 and N3 read as follows. N2: yasyācāryyasya vajradhātau nāmādhimokṣaḥ tasya sveṣ ṭadevatādhi*mokṣeṇa(N2pc; mokṣauṇa N2ac) bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyyanteṣu sarvve kriyā karaṇam aviruddhaḥ || (30v1–2); N3: yasyācāryasya vajradhātau nādhimokṣaḥ tasya sveṣṭade vatādhimokṣeṇa bhūśodhanapratiṣṭhāparyanteṣu sarvvakriyākaraṇam aviruddhaṃ || (24v1– 2). 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 511 

If an ācārya does not have a strong conviction in the Vajradhātu, there is no obstacle to his doing all the rites from purification of the site to conse cration [of images etc.] with a strong conviction in his own chosen deity. 

The fact that the pratiṣṭhā prescribed in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is a public social ritual is implied in some parts in the text. 

(2) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, chapter 4: 

tato bhūpatiḥ sthapatikarmakaraprekṣakalokān yathārhaṃ kaṅkaṇāṅgu līyakavastrahiraṇyasrakpūgatāmbulādibhiḥ samyak paritoṣayet.9

Then the king should satisfy the architects, the assistants, and the specta tors with a bracelet, a finger-ring, a garment, gold, heap of chaplet, tām būla, or other [articles] according to [the donor’s] wealth. 

(3) Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Pratiṣṭhā in chapter 6: 

prekṣakajanāṃś ca tāmbūlādibhiḥ saṃtoṣya śreyase bhojanaṃ baliś ca deyaḥ.10 

Tanemura 2004, 162 

[The ācārya should] also entertain spectators with tāmbūla etc. [In addi tion,] food and a bali should be offered for [their] good fortune. 

(4) Cf. Vajrāvalī (Vihāragandhakūṭīcaityāvasathāśramārghavidhi) pūgasrakcandanaiḥ prekṣakalokān sampūjya 

EM §1.1.6, vol. 1, p. 58; A 4r1; B 3v4 

In the above-quoted passages from the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, it is envisaged that the ritual is performed in the presence of spectators. The same character istic of the ritual is also found in the above-quoted passage of the Vajrāvalī. It is also envisaged from the first quotation that the sponsor of the ritual is a king. I shall come back to this point later. 

9 The edition is based on the following witnesses (for sigla, see the bibliography): N 37v6, N2 39v5, N3 44v1–2, C1 33r5, C2 51v5, C3 43r5, T1 43v4, T2 40v2–3, T3 37v5. 

10 Mss. N2 and N3 read as follows. N2: prekṣakajanāṃś ca tāṃvūlādibhiḥ saṃtoṣya śreyase bhojanam valiś ca deyaḥ (150v3); N3: prekṣakajanāś catāmvūlādibhiḥ santoṣya śreyase bho janaṃ valiś ca deyaḥ (174r3–4).

From the passage quoted below, we see that people are not only passive spec tators but also active performers of the ritual.

When the wood [to be used for the construction of a monastery] or the stones [to be used for the construction of a caitya] are brought into the city, [the ācārya] should send a message [that these materials are being brought into the city] to the king or the citizens. He should make peo ple with joyful minds whose bodies quiver with excitement carry [these materials]. 

3 Royal Patronage 

The above-quoted passage (5) too implies not only that the pratiṣṭhā prescribed is a public social ritual, but also that the king might be envisaged as a donor. Royal patronage of the ritual is also implied by the following passage in the nimittokti section of chapter 3: 

śiraḥkaṇḍūyamānaṃ yady ācāryaśilpiyajamānatanniyogijanānāṃ ma dhye kaścit karoti tadaikapauruṣād adhaḥ śalyam asti.12

etc.], then there is an extraneous thing [that causes a calamity at a depth of] the full height of a man underground. 

While an ordinary donor might be present on his own, the king would never be seen without his retinue of officials. 

As already mentioned in footnote 3 in this paper, Sanderson proposes that the fundamental reason for Śaivism’s success was “that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key ele ments of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval period (Sanderson 2009, 253).”With regard to the second element, he states as follows: 

The second element of the early medieval process to which I have drawn attention is the proliferation of land-owning temples. All but the most ephemeral sovereigns during this period, both in the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, gave material form to the legitimacy and solidity of their power by building grand temples in which images of their chosen God were installed, animated, named after themselves (svanāmnā), and endowed with land and officiants to support their cult. As we have seen, the great majority of these temples enshrined Śiva [in theform of a Liṅga]. Sanderson 2009, 274 

The first line after the opening verses of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā might reflect similar activities done by royal patrons for tantric Buddhism. 

Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, Ācāryaparīkṣā in chapter 1: 

tatra vihārādikam abhidhātukāmo yajamāna ādāv ācāryaṃ parīkṣayet.13

514 tanemura 

The manuscripts are divided into two groups with regard to the reading of the third word. Mss. C1 C2 T3 read abhidhātukāmo, which is employed in the above quotation, and Mss. K T2 vidhātukāmo. (The reading of T1 is a corrup tion of vidhātukāmo, and that of C3 is a corruption of kartukāmo, which is a synonym of vidhātukāmo.14) I suspect that the author, Kuladatta, envisages a king as a donor of a monastery, which should be named after the king. The original reading of the third word is therefore abhidhātukāmo. The prescrip tions in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are applied to other rituals related to the construction of a temple. In some cases, objects of pratiṣṭhā are not named after the donor. This might have changed the reading abhidhātukāmo to vi dhātukāmo. Alternatively, it might be the case that the custom that monas teries, caityas, and other religious objects are named after the donor had died out or was dying out in Kathmandu in Kuladatta’s time. Sanderson points out that the Licchavis of Nepal supported Buddhism (Sanderson 2009, 74–77). According to the Gopālarājavaṃśāvalī, the earliest local chronicle, the follow ing monasteries and caitya were named after the donor: the Mānavihāra by Mānadeva, the Dharmadevacaitya by Dharmadeva, and the Devalavihāra by Devaladeva (Sanderson 2009, 74). The first one is confirmed by its mention in an undated inscription assigned to his reign (Sanderson 2009, 75). Several of the monasteries of the Kathmadu valley are attributed to kings of the period of the Ṭhākurī kings—most probably Kuladatta flourished in this period—in inscriptions, palm-leaf deeds, manuscript colophons, or their own tradition. But no monastery orcaitya named after a king is reported (Sanderson 2009, 77– 80). I am not able to draw a firm conclusion, but there might be factors which changed the reading abhidhātukāmo to vidhātukāmo.15 

4 Textual Parallels 

Next, I would like to present textual parallels between the Kriyāsaṃgraha pañjikā and Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras. The section which contains these Śaiva parallels is called the nimittokti. In chapter 3, the ācārya should divide the 

14 This kind of “unfaithful copy” is found in various places of Ms. C. See Tanemura 2004, 102. 15 I do not conclude that the prescriptions of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are merely ideal. Rather, as I have already pointed out, the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is practical in its char acter (Tanemura 2004, 104–111). For instance, the measurements of a monastery by calcu lation based on the prescriptions of the vāstunāga are very close to those of the plans of Cha Bahi and I Baha Bahi in the Kathmandu valley. See Tanemura 2002, 572, note 29. For the plans of Cha Bahi and I Baha Bahi, see the plates attached to Watanabe et al. 2009.

site into thirty-six compartments. He should drive ritual spikes (kīla) sym bolising the thirty-two wrathful deities into the compartments, excluding the four central ones, and worship the spikes. Then he should visualise himself as Vajrahūṃkāra in order to remove obstacles from the site. Then the ācārya should re-arrange the placement of the spikes in a proper way. After that, the ācārya should connect the pañcasūtras—the cords of Brahman, the root cords, the direction cords, and the side cords—to the spikes driven to the ground (sūtrapātana). The nimittokti explains various kinds of good and bad omens during the sūtrapātana. I have already shown parallels in the Piṅgalāmata, a Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra, the Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati, and some other sources (Tanemura 2004, 148–155), and I have found yet other parallels in the Devyā mata, another Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantra. 

4.1 The Nimittokti of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā and the 

Śalyoddhārapaṭala of the Devyāmata 

First I shall quote the relevant part of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā (abbreviated as KSP) from Tanemura 2004, 148–155. The corresponding verse numbers of the Devyāmata (DM) are indicated at the end of each section. For the convenience of readers, the corresponding section number of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are also indicated at the end of each section of the Devyāmata, both in the edition and in the translation.

Provisional translation 

Next, I shall, as told before, teach the characteristics of extraneous substances, which exist beneath the site (vāstumadhye) and cause calamities to people. (1) 

When the site, which has been made square, is being divided with cords, [the officiant] who has knowledge of divisions of the site (vāstudehavibhāga jñaḥ) should investigate extraneous substances by omens, etc. (2) When the division of [the sites for] a house and a shrine with cords has been commenced, the wise man [i.e. the officiant] should notice an omen and observe it correctly. (3) 

[The omens are] seeing [someone or something], announcing [a creature’s name], cries [of animals], and the actions of a donor. [The officiant] should carefully notice an extraneous substance as situated beneath the site. (4) 

If a heretic is seen, that brings an undesirable outcome to householders. If one hears someone hurt, wounded, or killed, or something broken, then [the offi ciant] should not divide the site with cords. (5) 

If there are persons who are not praised, undesirable, or blameworthy, then one should avoid seeing such persons, hearing [the names of] such persons announced, and hearing the voices of such persons. (6) 

If a cord is cut, there is death or deadly pain.32 (= KSP [1]) (7ab) 

[The officiant] who has knowledge of the ritual should perform the fire rite for quelling of calamities, if he becomes aware of such [omens]. (7cd) Since a levelled house brings every comfort and prosperity [to the residents], one should divide the site properly with cords and examine extraneous sub stances beneath the site (veśmani). (8) 

[The officiant] should carefully prognosticate the extraneous thing [under ground] by observing [a creature] step over a cord, seeing [an auspicious or inauspicious thing], announcing a [creature’s] name, or hearing [an aus picious or inauspicious sound]. If [a creature] steps over [a cord] or is seen, or if one [hears] a cry of [a creature] or announce a [creature’s] name, then [the officiant] should prognosticate the extraneous thing [related to] that creature according to the stepping over and other [omens]. (= KSP [0]) (9– 10) 

32 The second outcome, deadly pain, is not mentioned in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 525 

If a creature [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord], then [the officiant] should know that there is the body [of that creature, i.e. bones of that crea ture beneath the site]. He should prognosticate an extraneous substance beneath the site (vāstunaḥ) by the bad condition of the householder’s body. (11) 

If an omen is seen, or if [a creature] cries out, or if [someone] announces a [creature’s] name, then [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing [related to] that [creature]. (= KSP [5]) (12) 

… 

If a cat [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord] while a cord is being cast, it should be understood that there is the bone of an ass beneath that spot of the site.33 (= KSP [3](1)) (18) 

If a dog steps over a cord, [the officiant] should prognosticate the bone of a dog [beneath] the [spot of the site]. (= KSP [3](3)) (19ab) 

If a mouse passes [over a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate bones of goats and sheep [beneath the site].34 (= KSP [3](13)) (19cd) 

If rams or sheep [step over a cord], there is the bone of a cow [beneath the site].35 (= KSP [3](4)) (20a) 

If cows [step over a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate bones of a horse [beneath the site]. (20b) 

If a horse steps over [a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to a buffalo[, i.e. the bone of a buffalo beneath the ground].36 (= KSP [3](5)) (20cd) 

If a buffalo steps over [a cord], there is the bone of a jackal [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](8)) (21ab) 

If a jackal steps over [a cord], [the officiant] should prognosticate the bone of a boar [beneath the site]. (21cd) 

If a hog steps over [a cord], there is [the bone of] a tiger [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](11)) (22a) 

33 Although the Devyāmata does not mention the bone of a cat as an extraneous thing, it should also be prognosticated if we consider v. 10 of the Devyāmata above. 

34 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā mentions the bone of a mouse, which is not mentioned in the Devyāmata, as the extraneous thing in the case that a mouse passes over a cord. If we con sider v. 10 of the Devyāmata above, the bone of mouse should also be prognosticated in this case. 

35 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā mentions bones of rams and sheep, which are not mentioned in the Devyāmata as extraneous things. Probably, in this case too, the rule of v. 10 above should be applied. 

36 If the rule of v. 10 is applied, the bone of a horse should also be prognosticated in this case. The bone of a buffalo is not mentioned in the corresponding part of the Kriyāsaṃgraha pañjikā. 
 

526 tanemura 

If a tiger [steps over a cord], there is [the bone of] an elephant [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](12)) (22b) 

If an elephant steps over [a cord], [there is the bone of] a camel [beneath the site].37 (= KSP [3](6)) (22c) 

If an camel steps over [a cord], there is †aṅgārasa† [beneath the site]. (22d) If a man steps over [a cord], there is a human bone [beneath the site]. (23a) If an ass [intrudes into the site] stepping over [a cord], there is the bone of an ass [beneath the site]. (= KSP [3](2)) (23b) 

In this way, [the officiant] should examine extraneous substances by [the omens] such as stepping over and seeing. (23cd) 

… 

If a cow [which has entered the site] urinates or drops dung, there are pieces of silver or gold [beneath the site, respectively].38 (= KSP [6](1)) (32ab) If a cat urinates or drops dung, [the officiant] should prognosticate a piece of iron or an inauspicious thing (? aśam)39 [beneath the site,] respectively. (32cd) 

… 

If a bird sings sweetly in an auspicious direction, then [the officiant] should prognosticate a treasure there. (v. 34abc = KSP [5](4)) (34a–c) 

… 

If [someone] scratches his head, [the officiant] should remove an extraneous thing at a depth of the full height of a man (śirasi). On the other hand, it should be understood that the extraneous thing which is a bone exists [at a depth of] a half [of the height] of a man [underground].40 (= KSP [4](1)) (63c–64b) 

If [someone] touches his mouth (or face), there must be [an extraneous thing] which is a piece of wood or hair (? śirobhavaḥ) [at a depth of] two cubits underground.41 (= KSP [4](4)) (64c–65b) 

If [someone] touches his teeth, there is [an extraneous thing] which is a tooth (hanujam). [The officiant] should remove [it from a depth of] that measure ment [= up to the teeth].42 (= KSP [4](5)) (65cd) 

37 The Devyāmata does not mention the bone of an elephant, which is mentioned in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. Probably, in this case too, the rule of v. 10 should be applied. 38 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā does not mention the former omen, i.e. the urination of a cow. 39 There might be a corruption here. It is expected that the extraneous thing is a certain kind of metal in this case. 

40 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches only that there is an extraneous thing at a depth of the full height of a man in this case. 

41 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is three cubits in this case. 42 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is three cubits in this case. 
 

If [someone] touches a part of his body, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing (arthaṃ … śalyam) [at a depth] up to the part. (66ab) If [someone] touches his neck, they know that there is [an extraneous thing] which is an iron chain. It should be understood that that iron chain [exists at a depth of] three cubits [underground]. There is no doubt about it.43 (= KSP [4](7)) (66c–67b) 

If [someone] scratches a part of his body, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to the part (aṅgajam) at a depth up to the part (adhastāt tatpramāṇe). [The officiant] should remove the extraneous thing carefully. (67c–68b) 

If [someone] scratches his shoulder (?), [the officiant] should prognosticate an extraneous thing related to the shoulder (?), which is at a depth up to the [shoulder (?)]. If he knows it correctly, he should remove it.44 (68c–69b) 

If someone scratches his arm, there is armlet [at the depth] up to the arm.45 [That extraneous thing] exists [at a depth of] three and a half cubits [under ground].46 There is no doubt about it. (= KSP [4](10)) (69c–70b) 

If [someone] touches his [left?] hand, [the officiant] should prognosticate the leg of a couch [beneath the site]. If [someone] touches his finger (karajāṅ guli°), [the officiant] should know [that the extraneous thing] is situated at a depth up to the knee.47 (= KSP [4](12)) (70c–71b) 

Alternatively, if [someone] scratches his [right?] hand, it is understood that there is an extraneous thing, i.e. a skull or [a bowl] made of clay [at a depth] just up to the buttocks [underground]. The wise man [i.e. officiant] should remove it.48 (= KSP [4](11)) (71c–72b) 

If [someone] scratches his breast, there is the bone of an animal (paśuśalyam) or hair (aṅgajam)49 [at a depth of] one and a half cubits underground.50 

43 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā additionally mentions a necklace and skeleton of a cat as extraneous things in the case that someone touches his neck. 

44 I am not sure whatsphaṇa orsphaṇaka means. The preceding verse refers to the neck and the following the arm, so this word probably means shoulder. 

45 If we refer to the parallel in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, the extraneous thing to be prog nosticated is an ornament related to the arm. 

46 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is the measurement up to the neck. 47 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā limits the first condition to the left hand, but does not men tion the second condition, i.e. touching a finger. 

48 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā limits the condition to the right hand. The relevant part of the Devyāmata does not have a word corresponding to †pṛṣṭḥakapālam† in the Kriyāsaṃ grahapañjikā, i.e. the Devyāmata does not give a clue to solve the textual problem in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā. 

49 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā does not mention this second extraneous thing. 50 The Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that the depth is the measurement up to the buttocks in this case. 
 

528 tanemura 

[The officiant] should remove that extraneous thing carefully. (= KSP [4](14)) (72c–73b) 

If [someone] touches his heart, there is [an extraneous thing] related to it (tat mayam) at a depth up to the heart (hṛdaye … pramāṇena). (73cd) If [someone] touches his back, there is [an extraneous thing] arising from the back[, i.e. a back-bone at the depth up to the back]. If [someone touches] his belly, [there is an extraneous thing related to the belly] at the depth up to the [belly]. (= KSP [4](15)) (74ab) 

If [someone] touches his side, one should prognosticate that there is an extra neous thing arising from dust. The best knower of extraneous things [= the officiant] should remove that extraneous thing which exists [at a depth of] that measurement [= up to the side] [underground]. (= KSP [4](13)) (74c– 75b) 

If [someone] touches his buttocks, there is [an extraneous thing] arising from the buttocks[, i.e. coccyx?] or an iron nail at a depth of two cubits [under ground]. [The officiant] should remove that extraneous thing from there. (= KSP [4](16)) (75c–76b) 

If [someone] scratches his thigh, there is an extraneous thing related to the thigh or piece of wood at a depth of one and a half cubits. [The officiant] should remove it carefully. (76c–77b) 

If [someone] is seen to scratch his knee, there is an extraneous thing, i.e. a stump (sthāṇujam) or a knee bone ( jānujam) at a depth of one cubit. [The officiant] should remove it.51 (77c–78b) 

If [someone] touches his shank, [the officiant] should prognosticate a bone of the shank [at a depth of] eleven digits underground in that place. There is no doubt about this. (= KSP [4](18)) (78c–79b) 

If [someone] scratches his foot, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extrane ous thing related to an elephant[, i.e. a born of an elephant (kauñjaraṃ)].52 He should remove the extraneous thing, i.e. a thorn [at a depth of] twelve digits [underground]. (= KSP [4](20)) (79c–80b) 

If [someone] scratches his big toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate an extra neous thing, i.e. a piece of chalk. Alternatively, he should prognosticate a piece of iron mixed with various calxes of brass there. (80c–81b) 

51 I have not translated the corruption, nādhitopaskarasvāpi. 

52 An extraneous thing prescribed in the corresponding part of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā is a piece of silk-cotton wood (śālmalī). 
 

the kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of kuladatta 529 

If [someone] scratches his toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate a foot of a horse [beneath the site].53 It exists at a depth of one and a half vitastis. There is no doubt regarding this. (81c–82b) 

If [someone] scratches his little toe, [the officiant] should prognosticate a piece of bell-metal [beneath] the spot. That [extraneous thing] exists [at a depth of] eight digits [underground]. There is no doubt about it. (= KSP [4](21)) (82c–83b) 

If [someone] scratches his sole, [the officiant] should prognosticate an animal’s hide as the extraneous thing. There is the extraneous thing at a depth of eight digits. (83c–84b) 

… 

These are the rules for the removal of extraneous substances. 

5 Concluding Remarks 

Whereas Śaivism produced Pratiṣṭhātantras, scriptures which specialise in temple construction and installation, Buddhism did not produce a scripture in this domain.54 The author of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā was aware that there is no scriptural authority at least with regard to the nimittokti section. Thus he states that one should consider various omens based on the half stanza from Dīpaṅkarabhadra’s Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi. He also employs the word liṅga as a synonym of nimitta and uses this word not only for an aus picious or inauspicious sign or omen, but also as a term from logic (inferential sign). His intention is probably to state that the word nimitta in the half stanza quoted from the Guhyasamājamaṇḍalavidhi should be understood as a liṅga and, therefore, things caused by those liṅgas are correctly inferred (anumīyate) based on the liṅgaliṅgisaṃbandha. However, this might not necessarily mean that Kuladatta thinks his teachings are non-Buddhist. For in ritual manuals 

53 A foot of a horse (aśvapādaṃ) is supported by Ms. B and Ms. A reads aṣṭapādaṃ (a spi der). Since the omen is scratching the toe, an extraneous thing related to the foot might be better. 

54 The Śaivas of Mantramārga produced a secondary body of scriptural authorities, the Pratiṣṭhātantras, devoted exclusively to the domain of construction of royal temples. They also asserted the principle that the Śaiva sthāpaka, the specialist who performs the rit uals related to temple construction and installation, is competent not only for the Śaiva domain but also for all the levels that Śaivas ranked below this (Sanderson 2009, 274–275). Cf. Devyāmata: pāṣaṇḍidarśanaṃ neṣṭaṅ gṛhiṇām asukhāvahaṃ (Ms. A 91v1); Kriyāsaṃ grahapañjikā, nimittokti: vidvadbrāhmaṇabhikṣusādhujanānāṃ saṃdarśane dharmaḥ syāt (Tanemura 2004, 155). 
 

530 tanemura 

it is important that Buddhist mantra-visualisation systems are employed.55 In the case of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, the mantra-visualisation systems of the Yogatantra and the “higher” tantras are employed, and in this sense the rituals prescribed function as Buddhist. This syncretism of different classes of scrip tures is common to both Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

The nimittokti and other sections (e.g. bhūmiparīkṣā) in which close tex tual parallels to Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras and Paddhatis are found have little to do with Śaiva and Buddhist doctrines and those sections have close parallels to jyotiḥśāstras and śilpaśāstras.56 One might suppose that this is evidence of the fact that both Śaivism and Buddhism used this kind of literature as common sources and established their own respective ritual systems. This is probably not the case. Although the non-sectarian parallels are common to the Śaiva Pratiṣṭhātantras or Paddhatis and the Buddhist ritual manuals, and these two religions employ different mantra-visualisation systems, the struc tures or styles of the rituals prescribed are similar to each other. For example, while the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā teaches that in the preparation of water jugs the officiant should make the assistants recite Mahāyāna sūtras, the Somaśam bhupaddhati prescribes a preparation ritual for consecration of the Śivaliṅga in which mantras of the four Vedas are recited in the four directions (Tanemura 2004, 235, note 50). Considering the parallels on the scriptural level mentioned above, the parallel repertoire of rituals prescribed in Śaiva ritual texts and the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā, and the similarities of structures or styles of the rituals, it is not implausible that one religion, probably Buddhism, followed examples of the other. It is, of course, important to consider various parallels of the kinds presented in this paper in greater detail in order to understand the relationship between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. 

55 The sūtrapātanavidhi, in which the nimittokti section is included, is based on the mantra visualisation system of the Vajradhātumaṇḍala taught in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃ graha. See Tanemura 2004, 139–155, 237–250. 

56 For example, descriptions similar to those of the nimittokti of the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā are found in the Bṛhatsaṃihtā 53.105–110 (EB vol. 1, pp. 489–491). See also Tanemura 2004, 245–250.

Appendix: A Provisional Edition and Translation of the 

Bhūśalyasūtrapātananimittavidhi of the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya 

After I had finished writing a draft of this article, I found a small section of Jagaddarpaṇa’s Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya which teaches about extraneous things beneath the site for a maṇḍala or monastery, and the omens for those extrane ous things. Here I present a preliminary edition and provisional translation of the relevant section. This is written in verse, and the metre is śārdūlavikrīḍitā. Most probably the material is silently quoted from the work of a predeces sor; the section colophon of Ms. K states that the Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya is a compilation of various teachings (for this colophon, see the apparatus of this preliminary edition).

The excellent master [= officiant] in steady meditation, gazing upon the centre of the tip of his nose, should cast the cord on the surface of the site which has been levelled following the rules exactly. [The cord,] into which [the five threads of the five colours] are twined, has as its nature the five wisdoms and is purified. [It] does not have a knot, and is placed in the centre [of the site before casting]. (1a–c) 

Having praised [the cord] with the sounds of a bell, auspicious song, conch shell, and bamboo flute, the donor should offer guest water [to the cord] together with jewels, gold, and fragrant flowers, which are blooming and beautiful, and mixed with the juice extracted from the sprouts of the aira ndhrīkara. (1d–2b) 

[The officiant] should examine omens. If a cord is cut, the death of a master [will take place]. (= KSP [1]) If the cries of a jackal, a vulture and a heron [are heard], then the death of a lord [will] definitely [take place]. (= KSP [2]) (2cd) 

If a cord is stepped over by a specific kind of creature, then there must be a bone of that creature beneath the site (vāstuni) on which the cord is being cast (sūtrādhāre). (= KSP [3]) (3ab) 

If [some other man] who stands beside the donor announces a [creature’s] name while a cord is being cast, then there is an impure substance, i.e. a bone of the creature of the name beneath the site on which the donor is standing. (= KSP [5]) (3cd) 

If [someone] touches [a particular part of] his body and [the site] is quickly dug to a depth up to that [particular part of the body] according to the rules, then there is the [extraneous thing corresponding to the omen]. (= KSP [4]) (4a) 

[With regard to bodily sensations,] various omens of extraneous things [be neath the site] are taught. In this [short section], however, [the explanation is] just abridged. (4b) 

If a cow comes and drops dung, then there is the same amount of gold as the [dung beneath the site]. (= KSP [6](1)) Alternatively, if a young girl [comes and] urinates, then there must be the same amount of silver as [the urine beneath the site]. (= KSP [6](2)) (4cd)

### 22 Mañjuśrī as Ādibuddha: The Identity of an Eight armed Form of Mañjuśrī Found in Early Western Himalayan Buddhist Art in the Light of Three Nāmasaṃgīti-Related Texts 

Anthony Tribe 

In this article I suggest that an eight-armed Mañjuśrī found in early Western Himalayan Art be identified not as the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī but as the Ādibud dha.1 This figure is distinctive in that it holds four swords, one in each of its four right hands, andfour book volumes, one in each of itsfour left hands. Previously identified as a form of Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī,2 this image is found in three locations in the Western Himalayas. Two of these are in Ladakh: one at Alchi in the Sumtsek (Gsum-brtsegs, “Three-Storeyed”) Temple; the other at Mangyu, where there are two images, the first in the Two-armed Maitreya Chapel, the second in the Village Stūpa.3 These three images are murals. The third location is in Spiti, where there is a clay sculpture in the Golden Temple or Serkhang (Gser-khang) at Lalung.4 

1 The expression “Ādibuddha,” which may be rendered in English by “Original Buddha,” de notes, in the present context, a figure seen as the embodiment of the gnosis ( jñāna) under lying the state of Buddhahood. It is not surprising, perhaps, that Mañjuśrī, as the bodhisattva of wisdom par excellence, would be reconfigured to function additionally as the Ādibuddha. 

This article, which, as will become evident, very much represents work in progress, has its origins in research on Vilāsavajra’s Nāmasaṃgīti commentary, research that was supervised some twenty-five years ago by Professor Sanderson. I undertake this foray into the field of early Western Himalayan art with some trepidation: it is not an area in which I possess exper tise. I have tried not to go beyond the limits of what I feel confident in claiming; nonetheless, there are bound to be errors, both of omission and commission. I offer advance apologies! 

2 The Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala as described by Abhayākaragupta has an eight-armed form of Mañjuśrī, named Mañjughoṣa, as its central deity (Niṣpannayogāvalī—hereafter NYĀ—54). 

3 “Two-armed Maitreya Chapel” is the nomenclature of Luczanits 2004; van Ham 2011 uses “Maitreya Tower I.” With “Village Stūpa,” however, I follow van Ham’s (ibid.) terminology. Luczanits (ibid.) has“Four-image Chörten,”which is somewhat misleading, aswhile the build ing contains four clay images there are also mural images.

The Sumtsek figure, perhaps the best known of the three, is the central deity of a fifty-three deity maṇḍala on the top (i.e., the third) level of the temple (Figs. 22.1–2). 

Being on the highest level and also on the wall opposite the temple’s en trance, it occupies the place of greatest symbolic importance in the building. 

versy. While the eleventh and thirteenth centuries both have their advocates (see Levy and Fidler 2014), I am inclined to agree with Linrothe’s (2011) assessment of a mid-twelfth to early thirteenth century time frame. For the Two-armed Maitreya Chapel and the Village Stūpa at Mangyu, Luczanits (2004, 170, 173) has suggested circa 1225 as a date, and the second half of the twelfth century for the Lalung Serkhang (ibid., 106). The eight-armed Mañjuśrī under dis cussion is also present in the murals of the mid-fifteenth century “Great Stūpa,” or Kumbum (sKu ’bum), at Gyantse, Tibet (see Ricca and Lo Bue 1993, plates 5–9; and also Tribe 2016, 89– 90, for a brief discussion).

This position has been puzzling since one might expect to find a Buddha in such a location, not a bodhisattva. Emphasizing this apparent oddity is the plac ing of a maṇḍala of Vairocana on the side wall to Mañjuśrī’s (proper) right. As the cosmic Buddha, Vairocana has seemingly been demoted from a more appropriate position on the back wall.5 

5 For further photographs of the Sumtsek figure and the associated maṇḍala, see Goepper and Poncar 1996, 222–223, and van Ham 2019, 344–345, 354–355. Another mural of a multi-armed Mañjuśrī holding swords in the Sumtsek should be mentioned. To the proper right of the monumental clay figure of Maitreya on the ground floor, there is, close to the floor, a seated ten-armed, five-headed, white Mañjuśrī, with each hand holding a sword. Goepper and Pon car have just two views of this figure (1996, 127, 135), one very partial, the other small and indistinct: the location makes photography especially challenging. Van Ham (2019, 237) has a better image, which shows most of the figure clearly. Four of the left hands are not visi ble, occluded by part of the Maitreya statue. Both van Ham (ibid.) and Goepper and Poncar (1996, 132) make slips in their descriptions of the figure, however, the former describing it as eight-armed, the latter as six-headed. It is clearly five-headed and the five right hands, as well as single visible left hand of the photograph, each bear a sword (van Ham states that all the hands have swords). While neither Goepper and Poncar nor van Ham attempt to identify this unusual image, van Ham (ibid.) nicely demonstrates the stylistic affinity between it and the seated figure at Mangyu by placing photographs of the two figures on the same page.

At nearby Mangyu, the figure (Fig. 22.3) in the Two-armed Maitreya Chapel is found on the (proper) left panel of two narrow panels framing the halo of the large standing clay figure of Maitreya. It is one of a number of single figures stacked vertically, and is not surrounded by a maṇḍala. 

The second Mangyu figure (Fig. 22.4), in the Village Stūpa, is standing rather than seated, and is stylistically related to the seated figure. This form, which I have not seen elsewhere, appears to be a variant of the seated figures that were the initial and primary focus of this article.6

The figure in the Lalung Serkhang (Fig. 22.5) is a clay sculpture. It no longer holds any attributes. However, like those at Mangyu and Alchi, it does not dis play the dharmacakra-mudrā, the standard mudrā in early Western Himalayan art for the principal hands of figures of Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī.7 Each

of the eight hands of the Serkhang figure displays the same mudrā—the mid dle and ring fingers curled down, the middle finger touching the thumb, and the index and little fingers extended. Christian Luczanits (2004, 98–101) has convincingly argued that the Serkhang and Sumtsek figures are the same.8 

Chapel in Mangyu, the Translator’s Temple at Nako, and the main temple’s assembly hall at Tabo. This iconography reflects the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala as described by Abhayā karagupta (NYĀ 54). 

8 Luczanits (2004, 99) observes that the position of the principal right arm does not conform to his interpretation, but that there is evidence of repair work at the elbow that likely altered the arm’s position. Assuming Luczanits is referring here to the figure’s proper right arm, I take 
 

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 545 

Giving further support to the identification he notes that the Serkhang Mañ juśrī is flanked on each side by two columns of four further clay sculptures that form a surrounding maṇḍala of sixteen figures. The inner two columns are comprised of four goddesses9 and the four directional tathāgatas.10 These eight deities also form the first circle surrounding Mañjuśrī in the Sumtsek maṇḍala. 

In what follows I will first examine the identity of the central eight-armed figure of Mañjuśrī, after which I will turn to the question of the nature of the maṇḍalas surrounding the figures at Alchi and Lalung, as well as their lack around the Mangyu figures. The eight-armed figure, as has been noted, has previously been identified as Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī.11 This is pri marily in connection with the Sumtsek mural, and seems to be largely on the basis of the two figures having the same number of arms, and, in the case of the Sumtsek Mañjuśrī, also having the same number of heads and each being white in colour. Thus Snellgrove and Skorupski (1977, 64) suggested the Sum tsek Mañjuśrī corresponds to the central figure of the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī of maṇḍala no. 2 in the Alchi Assembly Hall (’Du-khang).12 The two 

him to be suggesting that the arm/hand is in an inappropriate position to hold a sword. While he identifies the Serkhang and Sumtsek figures as the same, Luczanits identifies them as an alternative form of Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī. 

9 Luczanits (2004, 100) suggests that these are Locanā, Māmakī, Pāṇḍaravāsinī, and Tārā. However, if it is right, as I will argue, that these eight-armed Mañjuśrī figures are pri marily associated with variants of the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala of the main yogatantra, the Tattvasaṃgraha, I think the four female figures are more likely to be the Vajradhātu maṇḍala’s four Perfections (pāramitā), known also as seals (mudrā) and Family-mothers (kulamātṛ). Locanā et al. are not witnessed as a group of four until later, in texts of the yogottara/mahāyoga Guhyasamāja cycle, and likely first appearing in chapter one of the Guhyasamājatantra. Tanaka Kimiaki (2018, 134–135) suggests the two groups were origi nally from different traditions, with the Guhyasamājatantra group evolving from a triad of kulamātṛs—Locanā, Māmakī and Pāṇḍarā—in the Susiddhikaratantra, and, as a result, bypassing the Tattvasaṃgraha. 

10 I.e., Akṣobhya (E), Ratnasaṃbhava (S), Amitābha (W), and Amoghasiddhi (N). 11 Snellgrove and Skorupski (1977, 64), Goepper and Poncar (1996, 223), Luczanits (2004, 98– 99). Snellgrove and Skorupski’s identification has, in lieu of alternatives, generally been accepted by subsequent writers. More recently however, given the obvious iconographical discrepancies between the Sumtsek Mañjuśrī (plusmaṇḍala) and the Dharmadhātuvāgīś vara-maṇḍala, the identifications have been made with increasing degrees of caution (see, for example, Goepper and Poncar ibid., notes 151 and 153). Linrothe (1996, 272) does not follow the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara identification, and although he does not offer a con crete alternative, he usefully explores reasons why Mañjuśrī was of significance not only in the Sumtsek and but in the Alchi complex as a whole. 

12 For a photograph of this figure and first circle of the surrounding maṇḍala see Pal and Fournier 1988, plate D 14; also van Ham 2019, 114–121, for the whole maṇḍala and details.

principal hands of the latter figure are in dharmacakra-mudrā. Of the remain ing six, the three on the (proper) right hold in turn a sword, an arrow, and a vajra, while those on the left grasp a book, a bow, and a bell. This is standard iconography for Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī.13 Yet, as far as I am aware, a description of him holding four swords and four book volumes is textually unattested. 

However, an eight-armed Mañjuśrī holding four swords and four books is described by Mañjuśrīmitra, Agrabodhi, and Vilāsavajra, all in works associ ated with the Nāmasaṃgīti (hereafter NS), “The Chanting of the Names.”14 The three works are Mañjuśrīmitra’s Ākāśavimala (D 2543, a NS maṇḍalavidhi), Agrabodhi’s *Sādhanaupayika15 (Sgrub pa’i thabs, D 2579, a NS sādhana), and Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī (NMAA) (D 2533, a NS commentary). They were most likely composed between the mid-eighth and early-ninth cen turies, and were each translated into Tibetan in the early part of the eleventh century.16 Only Vilāsavajra’s text is known to survive in Sanskrit. All three authors agree in identifying this eight-armed Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha. Thus understood, Mañjuśrī’s location in the position of highest status in the Sumtsek makes sense. As the Ādibuddha, Mañjuśrī becomes the source of all Buddhas, including Vairocana to his right, as well as Prajñāpāramitā, who is at the centre 

The maṇḍala numbering is that of Snellgrove and Skorupski (1977, 38). It should be noted that it is mistakenly numbered as “maṇḍala 1” (ibid., 64), which in their own number ing is a maṇḍala with Vairocana as its central figure. Snellgrove and Skorupski state that the Sumtsek Mañjuśrī is “not [in the location he is] simply in his own right however, but in terms of the Sarvavid (Vairocana) tradition, which controls all the Alchi iconography” (ibid.). They may here be tacitly acknowledging that the maṇḍala surrounding Mañjuśrī bears little resemblence to the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala in the ’Du-khang, and presumably suggesting that Mañjuśrī as Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara has been appropriated into a Sarvavid context. 

13 This matches the description given by Abhayākaragupta (NYĀ 54, l. 6–7). 14 Also known as the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti, the NS was translated into Tibetan by Rinchen Zangpo (Rinchen bzangpo, 958–1055ce), although it is likely that his was not the first translation. Rinchen Zangpo also translated the NS commentaries of Mañjuśrīmitra and Mañjuśrīkīrti (respectively D 2532 and D 2534), the latter being the source of the Dharma dhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala. For an English translation and edition of the Sanskrit text of the NSsee Davidson 1981. For a recent overview of the text and its contents see Tribe 2015. Very much on the right track, Linrothe (1996, 272) identified the NS as a crucial text in trying to understand the reason for the location of the eight-armed Mañjuśrī at the top of the Alchi Sumtsek.

of amaṇḍala to his (proper) left. Mañjuśrī should no longer, at least in this form, be seen as a bodhisattva.17 

The depictions of Mañjuśrī as Ādibuddha by Vilāsavajra, Mañjuśrīmitra, and Agrabodhi will be examined next. I will also comment on the relationship between the textual descriptions and the artistic depictions at Alchi, Mangyu and Lalung. 

1 Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī 

Of the three authors, Vilāsavajra’s description of the Ādibuddha is the most extensive. The NMAA interprets the Nāmasaṃgītiwithin the context of a tantric sādhana,18 one based on an expanded version of the Tattvasaṃgraha’s yoga tantra Vajradhātu-maṇḍala.19 The maṇḍala’s principal deity is a four-faced Mahāvairocana, and it is in his heart that Vilāsavajra locates the Ādibuddha, depicted with eight arms holding four swords and four book volumes. The Ādibuddha is not the terminus of the interiorization process in Vilāsavajra’s sādhana, however. At the Ādibuddha’s heart a prajñācakra (“wisdom wheel”) is visualised, on which mantras assosiated with the Nāmasaṃgīti are placed. At the centre of the prajñācakra a final form is generated, that of Mañjuśrī jñānasattva (“the gnosis-being Mañjuśrī”), who is seen as the embodiment of non-dual gnosis (advayajñāna). Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva is visualised as six-faced, and holding a blue lotus in each of his two hands. Each lotus is crowned with a volume of the Prajñāpāramitā. As a result, although the Ādibuddha is, in a sense, the cakreśa (“lord of the maṇḍala”) of Vilāsavajra’s Vajradhātu-maṇḍala, he is the intermediate figure of three forms, all of whom have, or share, that role. 

In the fourth chapter of the NMAA, Vilāsavajra’s description of the Ādibud dha directly follows that of Mahāvairocana: 

17 Mañjuśrī thus transitions from being the bodhisattva of wisdom (prajñā) to being the wis dom (now jñāna) that underlies, and is therefore conceptually prior to, Buddhahood. 18 For a critical edition and translation of the Sanskrit text of the first five chapters of the Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī that contains a more detailed analysis of Vilāsavajra’s sādhana, see Tribe 2016. A summary of it is also available in Tribe 1997. 

19 The Vajradhātu-maṇḍala is more accurately called the Vajradhātu-mahāmaṇḍala. For con venience I use the shorter and more familiar form. The Tattvasaṃgraha is known also by the more extended title, Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha. The shorter form is commonly found in Sanskrit sources, including the NMAA.

[The sādhaka,] on generating the conviction that he himself is Mahāvai rocana as [previously] described, via the yoga of the four Buddha-thrones, should visualise a moon-disc in his heart. Above that, transformed out of the syllable dhīḥ, [he should visualise] the lord, the Ādibuddha. [The Ādibuddha] has five faces (pañcānana > pañcamukha). [He also] has five crests (pañcaśikha)—in other words, five hair-braids. It is through tying up those [hair-braids that he] has a crown of five hair-braids (pañ cacīrakaśekhara). [His five faces] have five [different] colours: dark blue for the east [and forward-facing face], yellow for the south, red for the west, [and] green for the north. On the top, he has a white face, the face of [the deity] Paramāśva. He is tranquil, with the ornaments of a youth, in fine clothing, wearing about himself a many coloured garment. He has eight arms, holding at his heart with four hands the Śatasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā (“The Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines”) divided into four parts, [and] carrying, in each of the other four hands, a sword of wisdom in the gesture of striking. [All this is to be] put in place [i.e. visualised] via the yoga of the four Buddha-thrones.20 

This passage is not free from textual or interpretive problems but none of them materially affects the present discussion. Although Vilāsavajra’s figure corre sponds to the Alchi and Mangyu Mañjuśrī figures in holding the four swords and four text volumes, other aspects of the description do not completely match. Vilāsavajra’s Ādibuddha has five faces, differently coloured. The Sum

tsek figure has four faces, all white. The Lalung Serkhang Mañjuśrī has three faces visible, each painted golden.21 At Mangyu, both the seated and standing Mañjuśrī figures do have five faces, albeit arranged differently from the NMAA description. They likely also have the same colours,22 those of the four direc tions plus white for the main forward-looking face, matching their body colour. In addition, it is worth noting that in the NMMA the Ādibuddha is said to hold all four volumes of the Śatasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā to his heart. While the seated Mangyu figure holds one book to his heart, the standing Mangyu and the Sumtsek figures hold a sword to their hearts (and no book volumes), and the Serkhang figure has one (empty) left hand raised to heart level but just to the side of his torso.23 

A note of caution should perhaps be added here. It has been observed that the murals and clay sculptures of early Western Himalayan art reflect a process of Tibetan integration and adaptation of their Indian sources.24 This means that it may not always be feasible to pinpoint precise textual sources for iconog raphy. Elements of a maṇḍala’s or image’s iconography—number of heads, or colour of faces, for example—may be local adaptations, or inflections, of descriptions transmitted originally via Indian teachers and their Sanskrit texts. Bearing this proviso in mind, I hope to show that it does seem possible to rule some (broad) iconographic identifications in, and others out. 

21 Luczanits (2004, 99) suggests a fourth head may be hidden by the (cloth-draped) umbrella above the eight-armed figure’s three heads. It should be noted that the clay sculptures of early Western Himalayan art have generally been repainted, and not necessarily in their original colours. The Lalung Serkhang was completely repainted in the early 20th century Luczanits (ibid., 93–94). 

22 For discussion of the facial colours of the Mangyu figures see the section on below on Mañjuśrīmitra’s Ākāśavimala. While this description of the Ādibuddha does not specify whether the figure is seated or standing, I think it fairly certain that the former is pre supposed. Prior to the visualisations of Mahāvairocana and the Ādibuddha, the NMAA describes how the maṇḍala, as a residence, should be visualised. The description con cludes with an account of the thrones (āsana) of the deities, with a lion throne in the centre. 

23 The positions of the principal hands of the seated Mangyu and Sumtsek and standing Mangyu figures are exactly reversed: left hand to heart with book, right hand to hip with sword (seated Mangyu), and left hand to hip with book, right hand to heart with sword (Sumtsek and standing Mangyu). The seated figure at Mangyu with a book held to his heart is thus closer to Vilāsavajra’s description, as well as in alignment with Mañjuśrī’s primary association with wisdom. In this respect the Lalung figure appears (assuming an unchanged principal left arm position) to be more affiliated with the seated Mangyu iconography. 

24 See Luczanits (2004, 72) for some comments on this in relation to Tabo.

In the above description of the Ādibuddha by Vilāsavajra, the words in bold typeface reference NS 93 (pañcānanaḥ pañcaśikhaḥ pañcacīrakaśekharaḥ). When Vilāsavajra specifically comments on NS 93 later in the NMAA, unfor tunately he does not add anything, but simply refers the reader back to the present description: 

pañcānanaḥ pañcaśikhaḥ pañcacīrakaśekhara iti || ayam aparārdhaś cādibuddhasya gurūpadeśenādiyoge draṣṭavyaḥ | tatraiva vyākhyātatvāc ca punar iha nocyate ||

With five faces. With five crests [of hair]. With a crown of five hair braids. And this second half [of the verse] should be understood with reference to the Ādibuddha, via the teacher’s instruction on the begin ning yoga (ādiyoga) [phase of the sādhana]. And as it is explained there, it is not restated here. 

Ms. A’s marginal addition (whether scribal or a correction) somewhat super flously adds that the Ādibuddha is “in the heart of Mahāvairocana [as] stated in the “Method of Awakening according to the Māyājāla” [i.e., in NMAA ch. 4, where the Ādibuddha is described].” Although the presence of swords and book volumes makes it hard not to see Vilāsavajra’s Ādibuddha as a form of Mañjuśrī, he does not here explicitly say that he is. This is remedied later in his comment on the word ādibuddha (NS100ab: anādinidhano buddha ādibuddho niranvayaḥ): 

ādibuddha iti || ādāv eva buddha ādibuddhaḥ | sa ca pañcajñānātmakaḥ …25 evaṃ pañcajñānātmakaḥ pañcavarṇātmakaś cāsau bhagavān | sar 

25 This ellipsis contains a summary of the five jñānāni (gnoses) in terms of various master ies. Thus the ādarśajñānam(mirror-like gnosis) is associated with the five balāni(powers); samatājñānam (gnosis of equality), with the four vaiśāradyāni (confidences); pratyavekṣ aṇājñānam (discriminating gnosis), with the four pratisaṃvidaḥ (special knowledges); kṛtyānuṣṭhānajñānam (praxis gnosis), with friendliness (maitrī) and compassion (ka ruṇā); and suviśuddhadharmadhātujñānam (gnosis of the completely pure dharma sphere), with overlordship of everything (sarvādhipatya). These associations are refer enced to the Māyājālatantra in ms. A (alone).

Ādi-buddha: [the word] ādibuddha means [he who is] “awakened from the very beginning,” and that one has the five gnoses ( jñānāni) as his nature … So that one, who has the five gnoses as his nature and [also] the five colours as his nature, is the lord (bhagavān). And he should be understood to be Mañjuśrī, since as the equality of all dharmas he is the unique ground [of all phenonena]. For that very reason he is [described as] free from [causal] connection (niranvaya). 

To summarize, Vilāsavajra has clearly identified an eight-armed figure holding four swords and four books as the Ādibuddha, and has stated that the Ādibud dha is also Mañjuśrī. At the same time, there are some discrepences between Vilāsavajra’s description and the images at Alchi, Mangyu and Lalung. There is also some variance of appearance between each of the four (three mural and one clay) temple figures. 

The likelihood of Vilāsavajra’s text—or Agrabodhi’s, as we shall see—being of influence in the iconography of these figures is given support by the exis tence of a small clay figure directly above the eight-armed Mañjuśrī in the Lalung Serkhang (Fig. 22.6). The figure is two-armed, each hand holding a lotus stem. The two stems each rise to a flower base, one on each side of the figure a little above its shoulders.26 

If it is correct to identify the central eight-armed figure as the Ādibud dha, then I think the two-armed figure may be Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, who in 

26 This distinctive figure was noted by Tucci (1988, 118), who, having identified the Ādibud dha figure as “Vairocana or one of his emanations” (ibid., 117), on the basis that the central figure was surrounded by the four directional tathāgatas, briefly observed that the fig ure above was Sarvavid. More recently this image has been discussed at greater length by Luczanits (2004, 99–100, 208–209), who notes the figure’s unusual iconography and sug gests a possible link with the sun-god Sūrya, who holds two lotuses similarly. This in turn, he suggests, supports the hypothesis that the figure is a form of Vairocana given the word vairocana means “resplendent, exceeedingly bright.” In fact, the link between Vairocana and the sun is stronger than Luczanits perhaps realised: the literal Sanskrit meaning of vairocana is “coming from or belonging to the sun (virocana).” Also, Edgerton (1953 II, 512) suggests that in Buddhist contexts virocana, “the sun,” and its derivative vairocana, can be synonymous.

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 553 

[Next] he should visualise himself as the fortunate one, the gnosis-being [Mañjuśrī], born from the syllable a situated in the middle of that [wis dom-]wheel [situated in the heart of the Ādibuddha]. He has six faces, is radiant like the autumn moon, with the best of sapphires in his beauti ful hair, with a halo that has the brilliance of the orb of the newly risen sun, with all the tathāgatas as [head-]ornaments, immersed in medita tive concentration, seated on a variagated lotus throne, in tranquil mood, with a pair of books of the Prajñāpāramitā above blue lotuses held in his two hands. 

The figure in the Serkhang is missing the volumes of the Prajñāpāramitā, as is the eight-armed Mañjuśrī below him.27 There is also a discrepancy in the count of heads. Vilāsavajra has six for Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva (one more than the Ādibuddha, who in turn has one more than Mahāvairocana, the outermost figure of the central nested triad). Although the Serkhang figure has just four heads, the fourth is about a head’s distance above the tops of the first three heads. The result is that the figure looks distinctly odd, with one head float ing above the other three. It does not seem impossible (and it would certainly improve the aesthetics) that there were originally two further heads in between the bottom three and single top head, giving a pyramidal structure of three + two + one heads, i.e. six altogether, matching Vilāsavajra’s description. 

There is also a small figure in direct vertical alignment with the two-armed and eight-armed sculptures, immediately beneath the (let us assume) Ādibud dha’s lion throne. It is a mural of a white four-faced Mahāvairocana, two-armed and simply attired, with his hands in dharmacakra-mudrā (see Fig. 22.5).28 His location may be coincidental, but if not, he completes Vilāsavajra’s triad of Mahāvairocana, the Ādibuddha, and Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva. The location of Mahāvairocana beneath the other two figures is hard to explain unless he is somehow understood to be subordinate to them, which is precisely what Vilāsavajra is saying.29 

Vilāsavajra describes Mahāvairocana as follows: 

27 That the Ādibuddha lost the four volumes of the Prajñāpāramitā apparantly without dam aging the hand mudrās suggests that they were easily removable. The same detachability may have applied to the two-armed figure. 

28 Luczanits (2004, 93–94) notes that while the Serkhang murals were repainted crudely dur ing the early twentieth century, it appears that the repainting followed what was present before. 

29 Namely that Mahāvairocana (= all samādhis) has the Ādibuddha (= the pañcajñāna) as his nature, who in turn has Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva (= advayajñāna) as his nature. It is pos sible that the Mahāvairocana mural is not part of the clay sculpture maṇḍala at all, and

And then [the sādhaka should visualise] Mahāvairocana on the princi pal seat, generated by means of the syllable āḥ. [Why has he four faces?] Since consciousness—which is of the nature of the Dharma-Sphere since, by its nature, it lacks such forms as the grasped [i.e., the subject-object duality]—is four-faced. [This is] because the four liberation faces [/doors] (vimokṣamukha)—emptiness and the rest—are the cause of the origination of all meditative concentrations (samādhi), [and this in turn is] because their ground is the Dharma-Sphere. He is white in colour because he has the Dharma-Sphere as his nature. He has braids of hair [stacked up on his head] as a crown and is unadorned because he is one whose mind is tranquil. Since he has both wisdom and means as his nature he makes the bodhyagrī (“highest awakening”) hand gesture.30 

In contrast with Vilāsavajra’s description, the Serkhang Mahāvairocana is not “unadorned”. He has armlets, bracelets and two necklaces. Yet he is is still fairly simply adorned, with no clothes on his upper body and with his hair stacked behind a minimal crown.31 He is two-armed but with his hands in 

that the significance of his location should be understood just in relation to the two rows of deities that flank him to each side. However, this same vertical alignment of the three figures of Vilāsavajra’s NMAA is also found in a Tibetan thangka of unknown provenance, a photograph of which was kindly sent to me by Tanaka Kimiaki. In the thangka the cen tral figure is Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, however, with the eight-armed Ādibuddha above him, and a small four-headed Mahāvairocana beneath him; and as in the Serkhang, the three central figures are surrounded by the four directional tathāgatas and four kulamātṛs. 

30 bodhyagrī-mudrā. In this mudrā the extended and raised left forefinger is grasped and encircled by thefingers of the right hand, the hands being held at the heart. TheTattvasaṃ graha (89, 4–5) describes it as follows: “The raised left vajra-finger should be grasped with the right [hand]. Thismudrā, which bestows the awakening of the Buddhas, is called bodh yagrī” (vāmavajrāṅgulir grāhyā [em.; grāhya Ed.] dakṣineṇa samutthitā | bodhyagrī [em.; bodhāgrī Ed.] nāma mudreyaṃ buddhabodhipradāyikā). For discussion of variants of this mudrā and confusion surrounding its name, see Tribe 2016, 90–92.

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 555 

dharmacakra-mudrā rather than bodhyagrī-mudrā.32 Nevertheless, although Vilāsavajra’s description does not exactly match the Serkhang figure, its broad correspondence, and especially its location, is striking. 

Before discussing Mañjuśrīmitra’s and Agrabodhi’s texts, it is worth noting that Vilāsavarja makes a clear distinction between Mañjuśrī as jñānasattva and as bodhisattva: 

jñānasattva iti sarvatathāgatahṛdayavihāritvāt | mañjuśrīś cāsau jñāna sattvaś ceti mañjuśrījñānasattvaḥ | nāyaṃ daśabhūmīśvaro bodhisattvaḥ kiṃ tarhy advayajñānaṃ prajñāpāramitā saiva mañjuśrījñānasattvaḥ Tribe 2016, 236, ll. 215–218 

He is [described in NS10 as] the jñānasattva since he dwells in the heart of all the tathāgatas. The jñānasattva Mañjuśrī is not the bodhisattva that is the master of the ten [bodhisattva] stages. Rather, he is non-dual gnosis (advayajñāna), the perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) itself.33 

If Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva should not be identified with the bodhisattvaMañjuśrī, then by extension, this should equally apply to Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha. Understanding this helps makes sense of the iconographic programme of the Sumtsek (and by extension of the three figures in vertical alignment in the Lalung Serkhang). Tucci (1988, 117–118) proposed that the two clay figures in the Lalung Serkhang were manifestations or forms of Vairocana or Mahāvairocana. In the present reading the inverse is true: Mañjuśrī the Ādibuddha manifests Mahāvairocana. And by implication, he also manifests Mañjuśrī the bodhi sattva along with all the tathāgatas and other bodhisattvas. Thus at Lalung it is the jñānasattva Mañjuśrī, as the topmost figure, that can be read as mani festing, in turn, the Ādibuddha and Mahāvairocana. 

bum (see Ricca and Lo Bue 1993, plate 5). If jaṭāmakuṭa is analysed as a dvandva rather than a karmadhāraya compound it can be translated as “having a crown and stacked hair.” For a Mahāvairocana depicted in this way, also in the Kumbum, with a large crown in front of stacked hair see Ricca and Lo Bue ibid., plate 4. 

32 The Alchi ’Du-khang has a mural of four-faced, two-armed Mahāvairocana with his hands in bodhyagrī-mudrā (see Pal and Fournier 1988, plate D 5; van Ham 2019, 94–95). Like the Sumtsek eight-armed Ādibuddha, this figure has its fourth head stacked centrally above the others. In contrast, the Serkhang Mahāvairocana has all four heads on the same level, with two to the proper right of the front face, and one to the left. 

33 The karmadhāraya analysis of mañjuśrījñānasattva is omitted from the translation. 
 

556 tribe 2 Mañjuśrīmitra’s Ākāśavimala 

Mañjuśrīmitra, who may have been an older contemporary of Vilāsavajra, wrote extensively on the Nāmasaṃgīti.34In the Ākāśavimala, he describes both the Ādibuddha and Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, albeit more briefly than Vilāsavjara. First, the Ādibuddha: 

dang po’i sangs rgyas zhal lnga pa | phyag brgyad pa | g.yas bzhin shes rab kyi ral gri | g.yon bzhin shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa’i po ti yod pa | zhal bzhi phyogs dang mthun pa | dbus dmar ser ro | 

D 2543, 4r3–4 

The Ādibuddha has five faces and eight arms. In the right [arms] are sword[s] of wisdom; in the left volume[s] of the Prajñāpāramitā. The four faces correspond [in colour] to the directions. The central face is orange. 

Mañjuśrīmitra and Vilāsavajra agree on the key iconographical elements. There is one significant difference in that Vilāsavajra’s fifth face is white, Mañjuśrī mitra’s is orange. As noted earlier, the seated figure at Mangyu has five faces (unlike the four-faced Sumtsek figure), and the top and fifth face appears to be orange-brown. However, it is likely to have originally been green. If it were orange it would point to Mañjuśrīmitra as a possible textual source, although he does not describe a white face, which is the colour of the principal faces for both Mangyu figures. The likely explanation of the orange-brown colour of the top face of the seated Mangyu figure is that the original colour has faded over time. It is clear from the Sumtsek maṇḍala that while reds and blues preserve their colour fairly well over time, greens and yellows can fade; in the Sumtsek instance, they both faded to a pale reddish brown.35 The arrangement of heads in both the Mangyu figures (seated and standing) is the same: three heads at the same level (front, left and right facing), surmounted by two further heads, one above the other. The topmost face of the standing Mangyu figure is clearly green, in contrast to the orange-brown of the seated figure. The intermediate face colouring for both is similar: very pale brown for the seated figure and off white for the figure standing. The colours of the three horizontal lower faces are identical: white (to the front), flanked by blue (to the proper right) and red (to the left). If green is correct for the topmost face, and if it is assumed that an 

34 Davidson (1981, 5–6) dates Mañjuśrīmitra to the mid-eighth century and notes that Bu ston records a tradition that he may have been Vilāsavajra’s teacher.

original yellow of the intermediate faces has faded, then both figures have the same head arrangement and colouring. These colours are those described by Vilāsavajra. The head arrangement differs, however: Vilāsavajra has four heads (representing the four directional tathāgatas) at the same level, each facing one of the four directions, and the fifth central (principal) white head above the four. The Mangyu arrangement could be understood as an adaptation to the constraints of two dimensional mural painting.36 

Turning to Mañjuśrīmitra’s description of Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, it is also structurally parallel to that of Vilāsavajra and immediately follows his descrip tion of the Ādibuddha: 

de’i thugs kar shes rab kyi ’khor lo rtsibs drug pa la | gsang sngags rgyal po drug gis mtshan pa | de’i kyil du ’jam dpal ye shes sems dpa’ zhal drug phag gnyis pa | g.yas ral gris g.yon po ti ’dzin pa 

D 2543, 4r4 

In his (i.e. the Ādibuddha’s) heart is a wisdom wheel (prajñā-cakra), six spoked, ornamented with the six secret mantra kings. In its centre is Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, with six faces [and] two hands. The right [hand] carries a sword, the left a book. 

Again there is a significant difference between Mañjuśrīmitra and Vilāsavajra. Vilāsavajra’s Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva does not hold a sword and a book, but has a lotus stem in each hand, each topped with a book. If it is correct to identify the two-armed figure in the Lalung Serkhang above the Ādibuddha as Mañjuśrī jñānasattva, Vilāsavajra seems a more likely iconographical source than Mañ juśrīmitra. 

3 Agrabodhi’s *Sādhanaupayika 

Agrabodhi (Tib. Byang chub mchog) is described as Vilāsavajra’s maternal uncle in the NMAA’s colophon.37 This makes him a contemporary of both Mañjuśrī 

36 In the murals of these eight-armed Mañjuśrī figures at Mangyu and in the Sumtsek the principal face and body is white in each case, indicating their alignment with Mahāvairo cana, whose distinctive colour is also white, and who is so described by Vilāsavajra above: śuklavarṇaṃ dharmadhātusvabhāvatvāt, “He is white in colour because he has the Dharma-Sphere as his nature.” 

37 Byang chub mchog has been standardly reconstructed as *Varabodhi. For discussion of the NMAA’s colophon see Tribe 2016, 25–28 and Appendix 3.

mitra and Vilāsavajra, and probably the latter’s elder. In his Nāmasaṃgīti *Sā dhanaupayika Agrabodhi also describes the Ādibuddha and Mañjuśrī-jñāna sattva. Again, first the Ādibuddha:

D 2579, 62v7–63r1 

The Ādibuddha has five faces. He is adorned with the ornaments of youth, and [wears] garments [decorated] with various gems. He has eight hands. As for the attributes held by the hands: the four right hands in turn carry a sword of wisdom; similarly, the four left hands each carry a volume of the Prajñāpāramitā. 

The basic iconography of five faces and eight arms (with swords, and volumes of the Prajñāpāramitā) follows Vilāsavajra and Mañjuśrīmitra. Although the description is a little more elaborate than Mañjuśrīmitra’s, Agrabodhi omits colours for the Ādibuddha’s faces. Agrabodhi’s description of Mañjuśrī-jñāna sattva follows a half folio later: 

ye shes sems dpa’ zhal drug pa | | ston ka’i zla ba ltar gsal zhing | | indra nīla’i gtsug phud can | | nyi ma ’char ka’i ’od ’dras bskor | | zhi ba’i ngangtshul dang ldan zhing | | g.yas dang g.yon gyi phag gnyis kyis | | utpala dmar po g.yas pa ni | | g.yon pa na ni sngon po nyid | | utpala de gnyis steng nyid na | | shes rab po tis mdzes pa’o | | 

D 2579, 63v.2–3 

Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva has six faces. He is luminous like the autumn moon, with the choicest sapphire as a [head] crest. He is encircled as if by the light of the rising sun, and he has a peaceful disposition. With [his] two hands—right and left—[he holds] a red lotus in the right, a blue one in the left. Adorning the top of [each of] those two lotuses is a volume of Prajñā[paramitā]. 

All three authors agree, then, that Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva has six heads and two arms; and Agrabodhi and Vilāsavajra concur (against Mañjuśrīmitra) that he holds two lotuses topped with books. Agrabodhi and Vilāsavajra differ, 
 

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 559 

however, in the colour of the lotuses. Agrabodhi has one red and one blue; Vilāsavajra has them both be blue. As noted, the Serkhang scultpures have been repainted in the twentieth century38 and at present the Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva figure has two green lotuses. In conclusion, either Agrabodhi or Vilāsavajra or both could be a source for the Serkhang figures. All three authors also share the same core structure for their sādhanas, with the Ādibuddha in Mahāvairo cana’s heart, a wisdom-wheel within the Ādibuddha’s heart, and Mañjuśrī jñānasattva in the centre of the wisdom-wheel. And like Vilāsasvajra, both Mañjuśrīmitra and Agrabodhi describe Mahāvairocana with four heads, and with hands in bodhyagrī-mudrā.39 

4 Broader Iconographic Contexts 

Some remarks about the maṇḍalas surrounding the Mañjuśrī Ādibuddha fig ures at Alchi and Lalung, and the lack of any at Mangyu, follow. First, the Alchi Sumtsek. While I am not able to clearly identify either Mañjuśrīmitra, Vilāsa vajra or Agrabodhi as providing the textual source for the maṇḍala, one thing is clear: it is not a maṇḍala of Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara Mañjuśrī. This is the case irrespective of the identity of the central deity. 

The Sumtsek maṇḍala (Fig. 22.2) contains fifty-three figures in total, all con tained within a single four-gated square courtyard. Within the courtyard is another (ungated) square that contains two circles surrounding the central deity. The first of these circles contains eight figures, the second sixteen. In the first circle in the intermediate directions are the four family mothers (kula mātṛ), identifiable by the family symbols they hold (vajra, gem, lotus, viśva vajra). In the four cardinal directions are the four directional tathāgatas, indi cated by their mudrā, animal/mount (vāhana) and colour.40 The second circle may well contain the sixteen samādhi deities of the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala. Each

40 While Akṣobhya (blue) and Amitābha (red) have their colours, Ratnasambhava and Amoghasiddhi are a similar pale reddish brown. Their original colours have likely faded, both here and throughout the maṇḍala. The colour of the garment on the Ādibuddha’s legs is a similar, presumably faded, colour; it is possible to discern the remains of a floral pattern on the leg coverings. The high status of this figure is perhaps further reflected in the use of gold paint, not only for the slightly embossed circle that surrounds him and for the crowns on his heads, but also for the swords and book volumes. Close inspection also reveals that both ends of each sword and book volume are adorned with a terminus of vajra prongs.

figure is iconographically distinct, although with the exception of Vajrarāga (E), Vajraratna? (SE), Vajratejas/Vajrasūrya (SSE), Vajratīkṣṇa (S), and Vajrayakṣa (N) I have not been able to make clear identifications.41 In the corners between the second circle and the ungated square are four offering goddesses. 

Beyond the square, in the space between it and the main gated courtyard walls are the remaining figures, twenty-four altogether. The corners are occu pied by four further offering goddesses. This leaves five figures on each side. The members of each group of five have the same colour (that of their presid ing tathāgata) and hold the attribute definitive of their family (i.e. vajra, gem, lotus, or viśvavajra).42 It is tempting to identify sixteen of these figures as (non iconographically individuated) bodhisattvas. This would leave the remaining four as door guardians.43 

The Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala in the Alchi ’Du-khang that, accord ing to Snellgrove and Skorupski (1977, 64), corresponds to the Sumtsek maṇ ḍala also has eight figures in a circle surrounding the central deity. In this the two maṇḍalas are structurally alike. The figures in the ’Du-khang circle, how ever, are the eight uṣṇīṣa deities, iconographyically identical. Beyond this, and within the first of three gated courtyards are four eight-armed tathāgatas and four eight-armed goddesses.44 As the existence of three courtyards suggests, the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala is large, with over two hundred deities.45 The Sumtsek maṇḍala should, I believe, be identified instead as a Vajradhātu maṇḍala variant. If the sixteen putative bodhisattva figures are excluded, the maṇḍala is identical to the thirty-seven deity Vajradhātu-maṇḍala of the Tattvasaṃgraha. A set of sixteen bodhisattvas often supplements the deities of the Tattvasaṃgraha in later Vajradhātu-maṇḍala descriptions. These are gen erally the sixteen bodhisattvas of the present aeon (bhadrakalpa), as described for example in Abhayākaragupta’s Niṣpannayogāvalī Vajradhātu-maṇḍala.46 

41 Also, some of the directional locations of the identifiable figures are unusual: for example Vajratīkṣṇa, standardly associated with Amitābha and the west, is in the south. 42 As with their tathāgatas, the colours of the southern and northern deities appear to have faded. 

43 However, those that occupy the positions of door guardians are not iconographically dis tinct from their neighbours.

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 561 

In assessing possible textual sources for the Sumtsek and Lalung maṇḍalas, at present I am only able to comment on the maṇḍala elaborated by Vilāsa vajra around the triple central figure(s) of Mahāvairocana, the Ādibuddha and Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva.47It too is afifty-three deity (if the central triad is counted as one) Vajradhātu-maṇḍala variant. The deities are enumerated/emanated in the following order: four family mothers (kulamātṛ),48 four tathāgatas, six teen samādhi deities, eight offering goddesses (pūjādevī), four gate guardians (dvārapāla), and sixteen bodhisattvas. While Vilāsavajra elaborately connects these deities with doctrinal categories and Nāmasaṃgīti “names,” he gives no iconographical descriptions. Also, while the sixteen putative bodhisattva fig ures of the Sumtsek maṇḍala are not distinguished beyond their family affilia tion, the NMAA set is not the same as the bhadrakalpa group.49 Thus while the Sumtsek maṇḍala could be derived from Vilāsavajra’s NMAA, further investiga tion may reveal a more immediate source. 

Turning very briefly to the deities surrounding the Ādibuddha figure in the Lalung Serkhang, it was seen earlier that (again counting the central triad as one figure) they comprise a maṇḍala of seventeen figures, two columns of four figures positioned to each side of the Ādibuddha.It was also noted that Luczan its (2004, 98–101) identified the eight figures of the two inner columns as identi cal with the figures in the first circle surrounding the Ādibuddha in the Sumtsek 

47 Vilāsavajra enumerates the NMAA maṇḍala deities in chapter five (associating each with a “name” from the NS). 

48 Namely Sattvavajrī, Ratnavajrī, Dharmavajrī and Karmavajrī. Although the core thirty seven deities of Vilāsavajra’s maṇḍala (i.e., discounting the sixteen bodhisattvas) are iden tical in name and number with those of the Tattvasaṃgraha, the order of emanation of the four family mothers—also described in both texts as Perfections (pāramitā)—differs. In the Tattvasaṃgraha they appear after the sixteen samādhi deities (and before the eight offering goddesses and four door guardians). In the NMAA they comprise the initial mani festation of non-dual gnosis. Their more central position can perhaps be seen as reflecting the changing status—the increasing centrality—of the feminine within tantric Buddhism during this period. 

49 Maitreya and Amoghadarśin are the first two members of the sixteen bhadrakalpa bo dhisattvas (followed by Apāyañjaha, Sarvaśokatamonirghātamati, Gandhahastin, Suraṅ gama, Gaganagañja, Jñānaketu, Amṛtaprabha, Candraprabha, Bhadrapāla, Jālinīprabha, Vajragarbha, Akṣayamati, Pratibhānakūṭa, and Samantabhadra). The NMAA list is headed by Maitreya and Mañjuśrī (followed by Gandhahastin,Jñānaketu, Bhadrapāla, Sāgaramati, Akṣayamati, Pratibhānakūṭa, Mahāstāmaprāpta, Sarvāpāyañjaha, Sarvaśokatamonirghā tamati, Jālinīprabha, Candraprabha, Amitaprabha, Gaganagañja, and Sarvanivaraṇaviṣ kambhin). That Mañjuśrī is enumerated here underlines the notion that Vilāsavajra sees Mañjuśrī-as-jñānasattva emanating Mañjuśrī-as-bodhisattva. The NMAA set is also found in Abhayākaragupta’s forty-three deity Mañjuvajra-maṇḍala (Tricatvāriṃśadātmakamañ juvajra-maṇḍala: see NYĀ 50).

at Alchi. He also identified the outer eight figures as offering goddesses. This seventeen-figure maṇḍala could be derived from Vilāsavajra’s NMAA maṇḍala, as an abbreviated version. Alternatively, the two rows of mural figures painted below the Ādibuddha, which flank Mahāvairocana may be part of a larger maṇ ḍala.50 Whether the maṇḍala, larger or smaller, is described more precisely by Agrabodhi or Vilāsavajra requires further investigation. 

While the Alchi and Lalung figures each have a maṇḍala as their immedi ate iconographic context—a context that makes sense of, and supports, their identification as Mañjuśrī Ādibuddha—this is not the case for the two figures at Mangyu, neither of which is at the centre of a maṇḍala. In the Two-armed Maitreya Chapel the seated Ādibuddha figure has no especial prominence— being one among ten deities that flank the large two-armed clay statue of Maitreya, five on each side. The iconographic programme of these figures is unclear, as they do not appear to constitute a maṇḍala. Among them are also two additional Mañjuśrī figures, one of which is a six-headed, six-armed, white Mañjuśrī at the same level as the Ādibuddha figure, and on the other side of the Maitreya statue.51 The iconographic situation of the standing Ādibuddha figure in the Village Stūpa is not dissimilar. The stūpa contains three other standing mural figures, those of Prajñāpāramitā, Avalokiteśvara and Tārā. These four fig ures, each of the same size, flank, in two pairs, two clay statues placed on the main axis of the stūpa, one at each end. There are eight further murals on the side walls (that also flank two clay statues), each of which is half the size of the standing figure murals. The Mañjuśrī Ādibuddha figure is prominent, therefore, but not especially so. It appears to be of equivalent status to the other three standing figures depicted as murals. It is not clear how to read the apparent lack of high status accorded to these two Mañjuśrī figures at Mangyu. It seems possible that they were not understood as depictions of the Ādibuddha—and this despite their textual context, and in spite of their iconographic context in 

50 Study of these two rows of repainted figures might clarify whether they are part of the maṇḍala or not. A combination of sculptures and murals is found elsewhere: for exam ple, in the Translator’s Temple at Nako subsidiary deities of the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala are murals while the five tathāgatas are sculptures (Luczanits 2004, 79–80). 

51 This intriguing figure, which as far as I am aware has not been identified, has six arms: the principal pair in his lap in dhyāna-mudrā; an upper pair with an arrow (proper right) and bow (left), and a lower pair holding a lily (right) and a lotus flower (left). The six faces, in two rows of three, have two central white faces. The remaining four have the colours of the directions. The correspondence of the number of heads with the Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva as described by our commentators is suggestive. Could this be a Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva vari ant, or even an Ādibuddha variant, perhaps from another Nāmasaṃgīti commentarial tradition?

the Alchi Sumtsek and the Lalung Serkhang. Further work on the iconographic programmes at Mangyu might clarify their roles.52 

5 Addendum: The Relationship between Agrabodhi’s 

*Sādhanaupayika and Vilāsavajra’s Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī 

Agrabodhi’s description of Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva, using images of the moon, a sapphire and the sun (“He is luminous like the autumn moon, with the choicest sapphire as a [head] crest. He is encircled as if by the light of the rising sun.”), is very close to that of Vilāsavajra, close enough for one to be borrowed from the other. What makes the comparison more striking, and the likelihood of bor rowing more certain, is that the three descriptions are also allusions—more or less quotations—to three Nāmasaṃgīti verse quarters, which are taken in the same order by both authors, but which are not in the order of the Nāmasaṃgīti. 

The three pādas are śaraccandrāṃśusuprabhaḥ (NS 125b), indranīlāgrasac cīraḥ (NS 126a), and bālārkamaṇḍalacchāyaḥ (NS 125c). Vilāsavajra’s NMAA (see above) has śaracchaśāṅkaprabham indranīlāgrasaccīraṃ bālārkamaṇḍa lacchāyaprabhāmaṇḍalaṃ. The second description, except for the change in case ending, quotes NS126a. Both authors’ descriptions also immediately follow a statement that Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva is six-faced. If we compare Agrabodhi’s descriptions with the Tibetan translation of the NMAA their closeness becomes particularly clear: 

| | ston ka’i zla ba ltar gsal zhing | | indra nīla’i gtsug phud can | | nyi ma ’char ka’i ’od ’dras bskor | | 

Agrabodhi

Vilāsavajra. D 2533, 39r1 

52 Rather than exploring in any depth the iconography surrounding the two Mangyu figures, my goal in this paragraph has been to focus on the apparent oddness of their location, on the assumption, that is, that they should be identified as representations of Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha. Rather more has been published on the Village Stūpa than the Two-armed Maitreya Chapel. On the latter, see Luczanits 2004, 167–170; van Ham 2011, 42–55. On the former, see Linrothe 1994 and 1999, 173–174; Luczanits ibid., 170–174; van Ham ibid., 138– 158. Luczanits usefully comments that the square Village Stūpa has a main axis. Linrothe’s 1994 article unfortunately came to my attention too late for me to consult. 
 

564 tribe 

Alone, this passage does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a direc tion of borrowing. Either could be an expansion or contraction of the other. Vilāsavajra is the more descriptively elaborate of the two. Agrabodhi’s text is in a seven-syllable metrical form (which is the case for his descriptions of the Ādibuddha as well as Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva), suggesting that the original Sanskrit passage was likely in verse. Further comparison of Agrabodhi’s and Vilāsavajra’s texts is required. 

6 Conclusions 

In summary, the Nāmasaṃgīti-related texts of Vilāsavajra, Mañjuśrīmitra, and Agrabodhi indicate that the eight-armed Mañjuśrī[-like] figures at Alchi, Mangyu and Lalung be identified as the Ādibuddha. Such an identification explains why the Alchi figure occupies the most prominent location in the Sumtsek. It makes sense of the organization of the murals of the topmost storey, with the Ādibuddha representing the deeper nature of Vairocana to his (proper) right and Prajñāpāramitā to his left. It also makes sense of the vertical organization of the storeys of the back (and most important wall), with the Ādibuddha vertically above, and again representing the underlying nature of, both Śākyamuni (on the second storey) and Maitreya (the future Buddha, whose large clay figure faces the entrance to the Sumtsek on the first storey). However, only the five-headed Mangyu figures have the number of heads described by our authors. The Alchi mural figure has four, and the clay figure at Lalung just three (or possibly four). These variations, which may or may not reflect local adaptation, remain to be accounted for. 

Differences between the three textual descriptions examined both allow and disallow the possibility of differing influences. Thus, for the two figures at Mangyu, the colouring of their five faces points to a tradition associated with Vilāsavajra as a source, and not Mañjuśrīmitra: Agrabodhi, who does not describe the colours, is neither ruled in nor out. Also, the small clay figure above the Ādibuddha in the Lalung Serkhang is likely to be Mañjuśrī-jñānasattva as depicted by Agrabodhi or Vilāsavajra rather than Mañjuśrīmitra.53 Further, 

53 Both Vilāsavajra’s NMAA and Agrabodhi’s *Sādhanaupayika were translated into Tibetan in the early eleventh century by Smṛtijñānakīrti, who was working in eastern Tibet. It may seem unlikely that their tradition of NS interpretation could be the source for the Lalung Serkhang images. However, Luczanits (2004, 122) has argued that the sculptures in Cave 2 at nearby Dunkar reflect influence from north-east India (via Nepal and central Tibet), 
 

mañjuśrī as ādibuddha 565 

if the Mahāvairocana mural beneath the clay Ādibuddha in the Serkhang is part of the main maṇḍala, then together the three figures represent the tri adic and complex deity described in each of the three texts discussed, but here as inflected by those of Agrabodhi and Vilāsavajra. Additionally, the evi dence suggests that the maṇḍalas surrounding the Alchi and Lalung figures are related to the Vajradhātu-maṇḍala of the Tattvasaṃgraha rather than the Dharmadhātuvāgīśvara-maṇḍala. A remaining puzzle concerns the position ing of the two Mangyu figures: their respective iconographic contexts raise questions about whether they were intended as, or perceived to be, depictions of Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha. 

In wider perspective, the mid-eighth to early-ninth century Indian textual portrayal of Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha, and as the Jñānasattva, by Mañjuśrī mitra, Agrabodhi, and Vilāsavajra (to place them in their likely chronological order) reveals what is hard not to read as a concerted effort during this period to promote Mañjuśrī as the key tantric deity. While the effort ultimately failed, as a result of competing claims for the role of Ādibuddha (for example by sup porters of Vajrasattva, Vajradhara, and Samantabhadra) and by the increasing dominance of the newer yoginītantra traditions, it is nonetheless significant that this yogatantra-based vision of Mañjuśrī as the Ādibuddha still had cur rency some two to four hundred years later in the artistic portrayals found in early Western Himalayan Buddhist art. 

The findings of the present investigation also give clear support to the sug gestion, made by both Linrothe and Luczanits,54 of the importance of the Nāmasaṃgīti and its associated literature in understanding the role of Mañju śrī in Western Himalayan Buddhist art. 

and although he sees Lalung’s artistic origins as being in north-west India, perhaps some textual/iconographic influence may have come from the east.If the Lalung Serkhang dates from the second half of the twelfth century (see above, note 4) there would be ample time for transmission of a Vilāsavajra/Agrabodhi based iconographical tradition. In the case of Mañjuśrīmitra’s text there is no equivalent issue of geographical transmission. Rinchen Zangpo played a major role in the development of Buddhism in the Western Himalayas, becoming associated with many of its temples and monasteries, and although he did not translate the Ākāśavimala, he did translate both the NS and Mañjuśrīmitra’s NS commen tary (see note 14 above).

### 23 Life and Afterlife of Sādṛśya: Revisiting the Citrasūtra through the Nationalism-Naturalism Debate in Indian Art History 

Parul Dave-Mukherji 

This paper sets out to revisit the Citrasūtra, a seminal section on painting from the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa, in the light of key concerns around the cultural politics of art historiography, the śāstra-prayoga debate (Maxwell 1989, 5–15), and the related question of interpretative frameworks for studying early Indian art. The latter concern has lately come to the forefront in the context of post colonial studies and global art history. It is critical of intellectual parasitism (Dhareshwar 2015, 57–77) and pushes postcolonial thought to explore ‘native’ interpretative frames to study Indian art (Asher 2007, 12). 

This paper attempts to complicate the search for alternative frameworks by underlining gaps and slippages that surround the meaning of terms in a given text and their modern appropriations. To this end, it traces the genealogy of the term sādṛśya, from the śilpaśāstric lexicon through its twentieth-century reception in art-historical discourse. How does a term acquire an afterlife when it enters into the force field of reinterpretation steeped in cultural nationalism? How could a newly “discovered” Sanskrit text function in such a space?1 

In this paper, I also intend to address the larger question: what is the geneal ogy of the view of India’s cultural past, and specifically its “art,” as transcen dental/ idealistic/spiritual, which has translated itself into a belief? And why does this belief persist, although in different configurations? In more recent times, an ethnographic approach to the study of texts has emerged as a cor rective, which I will critically examine for its relevance for alternative inter pretative frames for the study of Indian art. In the end, I will conclude by relating Coomaraswamy’s transcendentalism to David Shulman’s recent dis

course around the ‘more than real’ (Shulman 2012), and the latter’s implication for interpretative frameworks for Indian art. 

1 The Discovery of the Citrasūtra 

It is around the first quarter of the twentieth century that some major textual sources, either complete or as fragments, were “discovered,” edited and trans lated. They began to acquire tremendous cultural significance as carriers of authentic meaning. One such text was the Citrasūtra of the Viṣṇudharmottara, which emerged on the stage of art history in India when it was first translated into English in 1924 by Stella Kramrisch, the pioneering historian of Indian art. This art historian from Vienna chanced upon this text soon after her arrival in India in 1919. The first printed text of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa, edited by Pandit Madhusudhan and Madhavaprasada Sarma and published by the Venkateshwar Press, Bombay in 1912, is the one that caught attention of Kram risch. It was her English translation (Kramrisch 1928 [1924]) which brought the text into the discourse of art history and Indology. 

It was almost a decade later that another pioneering art historian, A.K. Coo maraswamy, turned his attention to this text, singling out one of its chapters, adhyāya 41, for translation and commentary (Coomaraswamy 1933, 13–21). This chapter of the text deals with the classification of painting into four types— Satya, Vaiṇika, Nāgara and Miśra. According to Coomaraswamy, the first two types corresponded to the pictorial tradition of the Ajanta caves. 

By now, the two most eminent art historians of Indian art who played a semi nal role in establishing the discipline of art history in India were involved in the interpretation of the Citrasūtra. This, in turn, exalted the status of the text and transformed it into an Ur-text for a wide-ranging extrapolation aboutIndian art and aesthetics, which continued into the first decade of the 21st century (Nardi 2006). 

Almost twenty-five years separate Coomaraswamy’s commentary on the text and its first critical edition, brought out by a Sanskritist, Priyabala Shah in 1958 and 1961. Shah’s edition broke fresh grounds in textual criticism when she incorporated the readings from six new manuscripts. However, her attempt at theorization was restricted, interestingly, to the same chapter selected by Coomaraswamy, which dealt with the classification of paintings. She was far too involved with connecting the types of paintings with types of architectural styles to pay attention to whether Coomaraswamy’s metaphysical readings of the terminology were borne out by the edited text. Exactly two decades later, interest in this text was renewed when another art historian, C. Sivaramamurti 
 

dave-mukherji 571 

published a translation and commentary of all nine chapters of the Citrasūtra (1978). A Sanskritist and an art historian of post-independent India, Sivarama murti assigned a diametrically opposite significance to the text, one validating “Indian naturalism” as opposed to the manner in which Coomaraswamy used this text as a support for his claims of transcendentalism during the colonial period. 

2 The Citrasūtra Turn in Early Indian Art History 

The interpretation of the Citrasūtra is further complicated by the fact that it was “discovered” in colonial India; this implied that its interpretation would be caught in a comparative framework involving the art of the colonizer and that of the colonized. The central question around which the art of India and that of theWest were compared and judged was that of ‘naturalism,’ a term that was seen as intrinsic to the identity of western art. 

When the Citrasūtra came to light in the early decades of the twentieth century, cultural nationalism was at its height and art history as a discipline was being introduced into Indian universities. Naturalism supplied a key term, often as an antithesis to ornamentalism, around which debates on the worth of Indian art and craft were being carried out amidst the ascendency of cultural nationalism. Transcendentalism and naturalism are dialectically connected as part of a discourse largely constructed by A.K. Coomaraswamy to place Indian art on a morally higher plane. The former stands for Indian art and its spiritual interiority, defined in contrast to the naturalism ascribed to Western art. There prevailed a climate of contestation rife with orientalist binaries that pitted the ‘rational,’ ‘scientific’ West with the ‘mystical,’ ‘irrational’ India (Masson-Oursel 1925).2 If Indian art is believed to be the result of the artists’ power of medita tion, Western art is assumed to capture only the surface of nature or the visible world but never its inner essence. Hence the imbrication of the naturalism debate within nationalism. In the battle between the superiority of naturalism in art as a hallmark of Western control over representation and its rejection by 

2 Paul Masson-Oursel, a French Orientalist, exerted a strong influence on Coomaraswamy. It is to be noted that Coomaraswamy found strong support for his views in Masson-Oursel’s writings and in fact translated Masson’s 1925 article “Une connexion entre l’esthétique et la philosophie de l’Inde: la notion de pramâna” (Review des Arts Asiatique 2, 1: 6–9) into English as “A Connection between Indian Aesthetics and Philosophy in India” (Rupam 27 & 28 [1926]: 91–94). 
 

572 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

Indian nationalists for the higher civilizational ideal of transcendentalism, the latter won the day. Its victory placed Coomaraswamy at an advantageous posi tion, and today this discourse has come to assume truth value, constituting a common sensibility concerning Indian art (Dehejia 1996). 

For transcendentalism to emerge as an effective discourse to counter colo nial presuppositions aboutIndian art, such as the denial of the existence of fine arts in India, an alliance of Art History with Indology was the need of the day. Already by the middle of eighteenth century, the discipline of Indology had been founded, having as its main objective the study of Indian culture through texts. Indology, right from its inaugural moment, operated with the assump tion that it was ancient and classical Indian texts that were the most authentic means of recovering India’s past (Halbfass 1981). 

Around the early 1920s, art history came to be introduced in an Indian university when the Vienna-trained art historian, Stella Kramrisch, began to teach this discipline in Kalabhavana, Visvabharati University, Santiniketan, at Rabindranath Tagore’s behest. In other universities where it was taught, such as Calcutta University and Banaras Hindu University, it was as an adjunct to ancient Indian history. It was in 1950s that an independent department of Art History and Aesthetics came to be established in the Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda. This discipline was mobilized for the reconstruction of India’s past, part of the nationalist project to regain the lost essence of Indian-ness as a means of reclaiming subjectivity (Guha-Thakurta 1991). 

3 Coomaraswamy’s Reading of the Citrasūtra: A Founding Moment in Indian Art History 

So strong was Coomaraswamy’s commitment to transcendentalism that it im pelled him to interpret the traditionalśilpaśāstras through the same lens.I have discussed his negotiation with the anomaly posed by the śilpaśāstras elsewhere (Dave-Mukherji 2008, 132–134). Let us see how the term sādṛśya gets inflected by his translation. As a case in point, let us turn to Coomaraswamy’s transla tion of adhyāya 41 of the Citrasūtra, which primarily defines four categories of painting: Satya, Deśika, Nāgara and Miśra. He particularly focused on the first category, as it seemed to pose a challenge to his assumption that there is no place for naturalism in Indian art. In fact, the very term Satya may be translated as “real” or “naturalistic” in light of its definition—that any painting bearing resemblance to the world belongs to this category: 

yat kiñcil lokasādṛśyaṃ citraṃ tat satyam ucyate 
 

dave-mukherji 573 I have translated this as follows (Dave-Mukherji 2001, 159): 

Whichever painting that bears a similarity with the world [that painting] is called Satya (“Naturalistic”). 

This is in fact in wide variance with Coomaraswamy’s translation (1933, 13): 

Painting that represents any of the worlds (kiñcilloka-sādṛśya) … is called Pure or Sacred (satya). 

How satya comes to translated as “Pure or Sacred” is not a matter of willful mistranslation. Rather, we need to historicize this mode of interpretation and ask, under what conditions may satya be taken as “Pure or Sacred”? Satya could no longer be accepted as “True to life”, as interpreted by Kramrisch (1928, 51). Another term, which intensified this problem, wassādṛśya, which could not be allowed to retain its usual sense (Coomaraswamy 1933, 21): 

If we understood sādṛśya then to mean “illusion” or “realism,” verisimil itude of any crude or naive sort, we should be contradicting all that we know of the oriental conception of art. 

It was the co-existence of satya with sādṛśya (resemblance/likeness) which compounded Coomarsawamy’s problem of avoiding literal translation. Hence Coomaraswamy was compelled to connect yatkiñcilloka- with sādṛśyam, against the rules of Sanskrit syntax, in order to yield the meaning “any of the worlds” in place of “any painting.” His translation (Coomaraswamy 1933, 13) continues as follows: 

Painting that represents any of the worlds (yatkiñcillokasādṛśya), that is elongated and has ideal proportions … [emphasis added] 

In fact, the description of the painting as “elongated” (dīrghāṅgam) and hav ing “ideal proportion” (supramāṇam) belongs to the next category of painting, termed Deśika. By misreading in this manner, he could explain away the natu ralistic potential in the term sādṛśya and impose his view of idealism being the essential feature of Indian painting (Coomaraswamy 1933, 13): 

So also in verse 2 above, where kiñcilloka must include devaloka [“abode of the gods”], sādṛśya cannot be interpreted as “naturalistic.” 
 

574 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

Coomaraswamy’s departure from normal Sanskrit syntax and semantics did not go unnoticed, but invited ridicule from his contemporary, a well-respected Sanskrit scholar (Raghavan 1933, 905):3 

Satya cannot be interpreted as a Sattvika picture. One can as well derive it from Sat and say it is the picture of the Upanisadic Brahman. 

In response to Raghvan’s criticism, Coomaraswamy revised his translation of satya from“Pure or Sacred” to“intellectual and ideal” (Coomaraswamy1933, 26), and rejected its literal meaning, which was however subsequently reinstated by Priyabala Shah (1961, 120) in the first critical edition of this text: 

Whatever ( yatkiñcid) painting depicts semblance of the world (Loka sādṛśyam citram) is called Satya. 

Coomaraswamy evidently felt in need of more support for his elimination of the concept of resemblance than the Citrasūtra could provide. He began to look to the idealist schools of Upanisadic philosophy and epistemology (Coomaraswamy 1933, 26) to arrive at a metaphysical reworking of the term satya: 

Satya is “real”, “actual”, “intelligible”, “ideal”; nāmarūpa, “form” as distinct from the natural disorder (anṛta) of the sensible world (loka) (Bṛhadā raṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1, 6, 3: Taittiriya Upaniṣad, II, 6). 

In his recasting of sādṛśya, Coomaraswamy turned to a rather unexpected source for an alternative definition of imitation in art that could preserve the term, but be free of the unwanted association of naturalism. He found what he was looking for in western medieval sources.In my view, this detour to the west ern medieval sources was not fortuitous but compelled by Coomaraswamy’s confrontation with the Citrasūtra. This is confirmed by evidence of the period for his new interest, as given by his biographer, Roger Lipsey. According to Lipsey (1977, 73), the beginning of the1930’s marks the period of transformation for Coomaraswamy:“… it is just at this point that the relation to medieval Chris tian thought changed from an enthusiastic but transient acknowledgement of 

3 Raghavan further comments,“My impression on reading theViṣṇudharmottara is that even to its author the exact import of these names was not clear. The text seems to have been written after a cut in the flow of tradition of the artists who were using these words as paribhāṣās.” 
 

dave-mukherji 575 

the value of Meister Eckhart in particular to a permanent and scholarly inter est in the entire scholastic tradition from its origins in the St Augustine to its flowering in the thirteenth century.” 

For Coomaraswamy, medieval Christian thought best illuminated how to interpret sādṛśya without any ‘naturalistic’ connotations (1933, 26): 

Now as to Visnudharmottara, III, 41, 1 and 9, kimcit is not “any” but “some what”; loka not here “worlds” but the sensible (not alaukika) aspect of the world; sādṛśya is not “resemblance” but consonantia, adaequatio rei et intellectus, … 

Combining references to western medieval sources with the terms from Indian epistemology, Coomaraswamy (1933, 26) arrives at a new definition of the satya type of painting as 

… sāhitya, sādhārāṇya, all of which have reference to unity self-contained in art, and not to likeness (sādṛśatā) to a model. Kimcilloka-sādṛśya is then “the unity of which is only somewhat as to the world, …”. 

For Coomaraswamy, sādṛśya with its naturalistic implication and its coexis tence with satya, translated as “Pure,” was contradictory. Here, purity is taken as a “unity self-contained in art,” and for that reason the potential of referen tiality to the world outside implied by the term sādṛśya was viewed as posing a threat to his construct of art as the realm of the mind. In another instance, he qualified this term as “a consent (sādṛśya) of pictorial and formal elements in the substance (śarīra) and essence (ātman) of the work” (Coomaraswamy 1933, 27). While he conceded to some presence of pictorial realism in the other three types of painting, it is the first type or Satya through which the ethical notion of art as “Truth” could be admitted as that which had to be elevated beyond any reference to this realism (ibid.): 

… and this contrasts with vaiṇika and nāgara painting in which it is to be understood that the realistic, pictorial (sādṛśa) element is much greater, where accordingly an adaequatio (tadākāratā) rei et intellectus, sādṛśya, is only partially attainable. 

Notice a distinction created between sadṛśa (which allows an element of pic torial realism) and sādṛśya (a consent of pictorial and formal elements) was crucial for his interpretation to avoid contradicting “all that we know of the oriental conceptions of art.” Rather than unpacking “the oriental conceptions 
 

576 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

of art,” Coomaraswamy ended up congealing the old binaries between a ratio nal occident and a spiritual orient. His ‘cultural unconscious’ is betrayed in a footnote in which he claims to have captured the voice of tradition through his alleged fidelity to the textual sources (Coomaraswamy 1933, 27). 

What follows is derived from all these sources without the addition of any thought or phrase of my own. Verbal authority could be cited for any state ment. 

What relevance this kind of interrogation has for us today, this reaching back to the cultural politics of the early-twentieth century, also needs to be addressed. The transcendentalist claim made by Coomaraswamy on the basis of a “found” textual tradition can be explained as a political exigency for combating the colonial representation of Indian art. However, when such reliance on ‘scrip tural evidence’ is perpetuated in postcolonial times, its inbuilt essentialism can have serious implications today in an India that is witnessing an unprece dented obsession around nationalism. 

Foregrounding the claim that rejection of naturalism by Indian artists was intentional, Coomaraswamy effectively undercut the criticism that Indian art was deficient in naturalism. He suggested, instead, that it was never the inten tion of the Indian artists to imitate the visible world but to create a symbolic image based on a supramundane ideal which transcended the world of appear ance. The charge leveled against Indian art of crude execution and a lack of anatomical accuracy (Ruskin 1905, 347) in the rendering of human and animal form was answered not by questioning the criteria of execution and cultural knowledge of bodies, but by claiming that these so-called “deficiencies” were deliberate, a result of a “specialized technique of vision” (Coomaraswamy 1934, 166): 

Technical production is thus bound up with the psychological method known as yoga. In other words, the artist does not resort to models but uses a mental construction and this condition sufficiently explains the cerebral character of the art, … 

The vision of the classical Indian artist that emerges from Coomaraswamy’s early writings appears to be modelled upon the idea of sculpture of dhyāni Buddhas, with artistic activity relegated to the domain of pure mental contem plation (Coomaraswamy 1908). The eyes of the artist appear to be visualized as half-closed, focused more on the inward, contemplative space of the mind and less on the world “out there,” the domain of naturalism. With an ingenious 
 

reversal of binaries set up by the colonial critics, Coomaraswamy constructed a compelling counter-narrative, but in the process, he reproduced the very colo nialist logic he had set out to resist. 

Certainly, Coomaraswamy’s transcendentalist claims for Indian art and aes thetics did not remain uncontested, as demonstrated by V. Raghavan’s (1933) criticism of Coomaraswamy’s interpretation and by the translators of the Citra sūtra. However, such voices of dissent were relegated to the margins and rarely made an impact on the disciplinary framework of Indian art history, where Coomaraswamy’s theoretical framework has retained a canonical status. Most curiously, Kapila Vatsyayan, in her very Foreword to my edition of the Citra sūtra has cited the same verse that I have used to critique Coomarawamy’s transcendentalist standpoint in order to justify it. The tenacity of this view can be gauged by the manner in which Coomaraswamy’s misreading of pratyakṣa, direct perception, as the least important pramāṇa or source of knowledge in Indian epistemology, is ratified by Vatsyayan (Dave-Mukherji 2001, xiii–xiv). In fact, all the six classical darśanas of Indian philosophy consider pratyakṣa the most salient source of knowledge (Matilal 1986). 

4 The Citrasūtra in Postcolonial Art Historiography: 

C. Sivaramamurti 

The return of interest in the Citrasūtra in the work of C. Sivaramamurti in the late 1970s signals a re-appropriation of this text within his agenda of cul tural nationalism. Ostensibly, his turn to this text was to eradicate false read ings and restore it closer to its original state (Sivaramamurti 1978, xv). Under scoring his interpretation of the Citrasūtra was the claim that naturalism was accorded a positive role both in Indian art and in the text, which resonated with the stand taken by him more than four decades earlier (Sivaramamurti 1934, 189): 

Questions of perspective and foreshortening do not appear to have baf fled the old artists of our land as in evident from their talks on such tech nical details as kṣayavṛddhi and the actual conformance of the pictures to those rules so elaborately discussed in books on theory. 

It is largely the presence of terms such as sādṛśya and kṣayavṛddhi (literally “decrease and increase,” i.e. “foreshortening,” a technique used to show appar ent depth in naturalistic art) that indicated to Sivaramamurti that the tradi tional Indian artist was no less proficient in representing the world “naturalis 
 

578 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

tically” than his western counterpart. In a similar move, he looks beyond the context of the śilpaśāstras, examining classical Sanskrit literature, and finds further evidence of imitation in art, as for example, in the Mṛcchakaṭikā (Sivara mamurti 1934, 189): 

The tendency of imitation in an artist given in the Mṛchhakațikā is healthy sign of progress at a particular stage provided it is directed in the right direction. 

Thus by placing the śilpaśāstrasin this wider context, Sivaramamurti retrieved key terms such assādṛśya, anukṛti and kṣayavṛddhi from the framework of tran scendentalism. Sivaramamurti reinstated naturalism in post-colonial India as an index of ‘progress,’ as proof that India could measure up, and more, to the categories and standards of art set up in and by the West. Indeed, he writes naturalism back into the art-historiographical demands of post-colonial India, mapping the term powerfully onto nation building. 

For me, the rejection of naturalism in Indian art on grounds of its western identity is as problematic as its nativist retrieval in Sivaramamurti’s interpre tation of the Citrasūtra. Interestingly, Sivaramamurti’s espousal of an Indian naturalism met with deep skepticism from Stella Kramrisch, who was invited to write the foreword by the author (Sivaramamurti 1934, 10): 

If as the text shows and Dr. Sivaramamurti stresses, realism was a main consideration with the painters, their criteria of verisimilitude were, no doubt, met in practice, although no object painted in the murals of Ajan ta, which are roughly contemporary with the Chitrasūtra would strike a spectator today as being realistically painted. The realism is in the eye of the beholder and pious stories told, though not in the Chitrasūtra … 

Kramrisch almost poses as a paradox the gap between the ancient painters’ intentions to accomplish realism and their actual practice, and argues that the premodern criteria of representation do not match up with our modern expectations of verisimilitude. Today, it is possible to see an overlap between Kramrisch’s skepticism about Sivaramamurti’s literal reading of the mimetic terms in the Citrasūtra and David Shulman’s (2012) recent problematization of ‘the real’ in the context of his study of the South Indian models of mind. 

In his reading of a seventh-century playwright, Harṣadeva’s classical Sanskrit drama, Ratnāvalī, Shulman foregrounds the role of painting in the way the plot unfolds. About the question of verisimilitude, which emerges when the char acters recognize each other in their respective portraits, Shulman arrives at a 
 

dave-mukherji 579 

paradox similar to Kramrisch’s, but resolves it by stressing the realm of imagi nation (Shulman 2012, 28): 

Apparently, the painted image is recognized not so much by virtue of how it is painted but mostly as a prop for projection, … 

At one stroke, if Kramrisch evacuates realism/naturalism (taken interchange ably in this context) from both the walls of Ajanta and the text of the Citrasūtra, Shulman edges it from the painted surface to the space of literary imagination. Naturalism or ‘the real’ is discursively edged off to the realm of the mind via the “eyes of the beholder” and the physical entity of a painting reduced to a “prop for projection.” Despite her reservations about claims of verisimilitude in the Citrasūtra, Kramrisch had earlier accepted cultural specificity in visual representation. This view implicitly allowed for “Indian naturalism,” even if her example draws from Chinese and European naturalism (Kramrisch 1922, 25): 

The Chinese naturalism to the European eye appears as an idealistic abstraction, while the European naturalism strikes the Chinese as ugli ness. 

However, it is instructive to recognize the difference between Kramrisch and Shulman’s skepticism about the claims of the real. Kramrisch, to some extent, was able to accommodate naturalism as a culturally specific phenomenon that manifested in art theory, if not in practice, while Shulman relegates the ques tion of painterly resemblance solely to the domain of imagination. However, such a categorical dismissal of verisimilitude assumes a wide gap not only between discourse and practice but also between how the Indian mind thinks, how the Indian eyes see and how Indian bodies act; thinking, vision and agency are assumed to fall outside of any rational intentionality. 

What needs examination is the persistence of a belief that ancient Indian art willfully rejected any empirical interest in the world that surrounded the artists. In my view, the theoretical framework of what this belief (i.e. in tran scendentalism) was once a part of has faded into the background, turning the belief and the problematic produced by that theory into a widely-shared yet questionable sensibility concerning India’s past and art traditions. Rather than a simplistic retrieval of an “Indian naturalism,” as attempted by Sivaramamurti, the very semantic framework of the real operating in the śilpaśāstras and liter ary texts needs to be unpacked and thought through.

Since the inception of art history in India in the late eighteenth century, the core of the discipline came to be defined by a “detailed study of archeological evidence using a stylistic approach” (Maxwell 1989, 5). Despite the momen tous “discovery” of the śilpaśāstras inaugurated by the coming to light of the Mānasāra in 1834, and by subsequent work on the Citralakṣaṇa, Citrasūtra, Mānasollāsa and other sources around the early-twentieth century, these have still not been adequately explored for developing interpretative frameworks of art history in India. As pointed out by Tapati Guha Thakurta (1991, 170) in the context of Bengal, a sharp divide arose between history and aesthetics, as between archeology and the study of śilpa texts, when modern commentaries on ancient texts came to be written by the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries:4 

Art history and aesthetics, even as they grew out of the same institu tionalized scholarly sphere, would henceforth always be marked out as a discretely differentiated field. 

The separation of aesthetics and archeology got mapped onto the śāstra (the ory) and prayoga (practice) divide, and led to a division of labour in which the question of meaning and interpretation was seen as the realm of specialized Sankrit-based scholarship dissociated from the empirical study of artifacts, with the latter thought to lie in the domain of archeology. 

Reflecting on Indian intellectual history, Sheldon Pollock touches upon the imbrication of power in theIndian intellectual tradition around śāstra-prayoga (Pollock 1984, 499–519). Seldom has modern art history in India responded to the issue of the caste hierarchy that has existed between the Brahmin authors of the śilpaśāstras and the low caste śilpins or artisans who practiced art (Misra 1975). Kramrisch (1985, 61), in fact, was one of the first art historians to exam ine caste in the context of art practice and point out contradictory views about labour and caste often held by the Dharmaśāstras: 

4 Abanindranath Tagore, who spearheaded the Bengal School, wrote an article, “Shadangas or The Six Limbs of Painting” in 1915. It claimed to base its interpretation of Indian aesthetics on a verse culled from the Kāmasūtra of circa 500CE. This elicited a vehement critique from an archeologist, Akshay Kumar Maitreya, and illustrates the conflict between aesthetics and archeology, as pointed out by Guha-Thakurta (1991).

Manu says that the hand of a craftsman engaged in his work is always ritu ally pure. TheGautama Dharmaśāstra postulates that a Brahman may not accept food from an artisan. The law books thus distinguish the craftsman in his social position on one hand, and in his state of grace on the other— when he is engaged in his work, when he creates, and, thereby, gives effect to his being an embodiment of Viśvakarma. 

Despite Kramrisch’s attention to caste and its implication for the system of patronage and art practice, the model created by Coomaraswamy of the śilpī or an artist/artisan aligned with transcendentalism remained dominant. Even Kramrisch later began to follow this line of thought (1985, 57): 

As artists and magicians, the Indian craftsmen transmuted matter into form, vision into concrete shape, and man beyond his earthy competence … Charged with this power their work became concretely real, subtly effective, and transcendentally existent …. 

6 Reading Sādṛśya through Ethnography 

Since the time of the modern discovery of the śilpaśāstras and particularly with reference to texts on architecture, ethnography has emerged as a valid method of interpreting difficult terminology. As early as Ram Raz’s attempt to make sense of obsolete terminology around 1830s, recourse to extant practice was sought as a way of checking the extent to which śāstric terms had purchase with craftsmen. The question that I would like to raise here is the usefulness of ethnography in the interpretation of terms that deal with the ‘resemblance’ or ‘truthfulness’ of visual representation. Where are we placed today in terms of our understanding of this terminology, and to what extent is combining ethnography with the study of śilpa texts useful for shedding light on its slip pery semantics? 

Samuel Parker (2003, 5–34) has been at the forefront of embracing the ethnographic approach in the study of texts mainly on architecture. Can this method be equally illuminating in the study of the śilpaśāstras? Do critical terms that relate to visual representation—anukṛti (imitation or mimesis), sādṛśya (resemblance or verisimilitude), viddha (literally “pierced,” or captur ing resemblance), aviddha (that which lacks resemblance), etc.—hold reso nance for traditional idol makers? Here perhaps we need to distinguish be tween technical termsfor parts of a building and terms that deal with aesthetics (beauty) and visual representation. Terms that deal with complex semiotics 
 

582 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

such as sādṛśya, beauty, etc., are too culturally loaded for them to travel well across time. Perhaps in this regard it is instructive to turn to British art historian, Michael Baxandall (1972, 26), who has brought to our notice how some art ter minologies common in fifteenth-century Italy, which had made perfect sense to their contemporary public, resist easy comprehension for today’s audience. 

Ethnography, as employed by some Indologists, assumes continuity of meaning across time such that by recourse to extant practice by modern stha pati (traditional architects) the meanings of traditional treatises can be un locked. Terms such as sādṛśya are ensconced in a whole web of meanings and practices of viewing that make them intelligible, and in the absence of the lat ter, they often give rise to skepticism around śilpaśāstras—as if what they say fails to coincide with what they really mean. 

Besides, do terms like sādṛśya or satya, no doubt used in classification of paintings in terms of degrees of correspondence to the visibleworld asfar as the Citrasūtra is concerned, have the same valence as technical terms that classify a building? Or, as demonstrated by the survey of the historiography of textual interpretations, terms dealing with visual representation are seen by cultural nationalists as too invested in civilizational identity and the marking of cul tural difference to yield an ‘objective’ meaning. More recently, Isabella Nardi has ventured into this fraught zone and attempted to employ the ethnographic approach to analyze how a present-day traditional idol maker engages with visual representation and beauty. Nardi has interacted with local sculptors in Orissa and Rajasthan to explore the relevance of the śilpaśāstras to their cur rent practice (Nardi 2006, 58–63). 

In her conversation with a local sculptor, Ram Prasad Sharma, Nardi was struck by Sharma’s comparison of the sculpture of Lakshmi with a European Renaissance master, Giovanni Bellini’s Young Woman with a Mirror (painted in 1515), only to demonstrate the greater beauty of the former (2006, 60): 

Applying his rules and ideals, the sculptor explains that the major defects of this Renaissance figure are that the woman has a huge belly and very big arms. 

Likewise, Nardi (ibid.) attributes this sculptor’s failed attempt at copying Michelangelo’s sculptures to “different vocabulary and aesthetic ideals of the Indian sculptor and [the] Renaissance [sculptor].” Such an ethnographic exer cise, while shedding light on the gap between text and practice, serves to under line cultural difference and tends more towards truisms about how each cul tural practitioner responds to aesthetics through what is locally familiar than to clarify meanings embedded in texts.

7 “Mistranslation” of Sanskrit Terms: A Paradigm for Rethinking Visual Representation in Indian Art 

There is no simple, pure unproblematic naturalism in theIndian tradition wait ing to be recuperated. The very fact that there is no one-to-one translation possible in Sanskrit, for example, opens up an area of interrogation and also a paradigm for interpretation. Perhaps we have neither the words nor the con cepts to capture the domain of “naturalism.” 

Kapila Vatsyayan insightfully problematizes the question of naturalism in the context of premodern India thus (Dave-Mukherji 2001, xii): 

For a fuller examination, it would be necessary to reopen the question of what constitutes as Nature in the Indian mind-scape, more precisely, the mahābhūtas and prakṛti. This comprehension has to be clearly distin guished from the emergence of ‘naturalism’ as an art movement in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Of course, the absence of a single term does not signify that the concept does not exist. Rather, the absence itself can be seen as an important clue. Perhaps what we have is a much more complex experience which can be described by using a combination of sādṛśya, satya and anukṛti. In the same way, San skrit terms such as kṣayavṛddhi(literally, diminution and expansion) or vartanā need not be directly taken as equivalents of “foreshortening” or “shading.” The lack of a close fit between them and the gaps opening up as we attempt to map one set of Sanskrit terms on another set of English terms may itself signify a rich terrain to explore. 

Once it is acknowledged that that no mode of visual representation in any given culture in the West or elsewhere has a direct, unmediated and privileged access to the visible, it makes futile any defensive and anxious search for an “Indian naturalism.” In Art History, Norman Bryson (1983) has engaged with a post-structuralist critique of representation and argued against any unmedi ated access to the real, a view that helps us to complicate the issue of naturalism even in the context of premodern Indian art. 

In more recent times and a context closer to South Asia, the question of ‘the real’ has assumed new significance in the writings of David Shulman, who has added a more specific dimension to this inquiry through his focus on South Indian models of mind. I would conclude by juxtaposing Coomaraswamy’s anti-naturalism with Shulman’s evocation of the ‘more than real.’ At one level, one may discern a certain correspondence between Coomaraswamy’s rejection of naturalism as alien to the Indian sensibility, a construct created under the 
 

584 life and afterlife of sādṛśya 

sway of cultural nationalism, and Shulman’s recognition of a different model of mind for South Asia that allows for an interplay between the real and the imagined. At the same time, it is possible to recognize a distinction between their models. While Coomaraswamy’s view of naturalism arose out of a desire to defend Indian art from colonial denigration, Shulman—despite his focus on South India—complicates any simple binaries of the real and the imagi nary; this he does by refusing a separation between an observing subject and observed real, instead posing their mutual permeability. Notwithstanding the fact that Shulman arrives at this model through a close reading of literary texts, it has important implications for notions of visual representation. 

Once we overcome the defensive rejection of ‘the real’ and resituate the real at the cusp of the existing and the imaginary, the sāstric terminology can be accessed in new ways. The term vāyugati is a case in point. I would like to express my gratitude to Alexis Sanderson for pointing out the ‘literal’ mean ing of vāyugati when I was editing the Citrasūtra as his D.Phil. student in Oxford in the late 1980s. This term appears in the description of hallmarks of a skilled artist, the citravid, in the last adhyāya of the Citrasūtra, and sets up a high standard of verisimilitude for artistic practice: an expert must have an ability to depict parts of the body (or difficult transitional points) normally covered by ornaments like the neck, wrists, feet and ears; a body wounded by an arrow; an old person; he must create differentiation between a sleep ing and a dead body, and an illusion of an apparent undulation of a flat sur face. It is in this context of technical mastery over representation that vāyugati appears as a further marker of a skilled painter (Dave-Mukherji 2001, 250– 251): 

taraṅgāgniśikhādhūmaṃ vaijayantyāmbarādikam 

vāyugatyā likhed yas tu vijñeyaḥ sa tu citravit 

He who is able to paint waves, flames, smoke, flags and garments etc. with the speed of the wind (vāyugatyā) is considered to be an expert. 

Previous editors of the Citrasūtra, who include Stella Kramrisch, A.K. Cooma raswamy, C. Sivaramamurti and Priyabala Shah, have overlooked the performa tive dimension of vāyugati. They have considered its representational mean ing and connected it with the objects to be depicted, such as flames, banners and clothes that are windswept (vāyugati). Vāyugati can also connect with the agent of representation, i.e. the citravid or the expert in painting, who must paint flames, banners and clothes with the speed of the wind. If the first sense locates the objects to be drawn, such as flames, banners and clothes, in the lived 
 

dave-mukherji 585 

and observable world, the second meaning implies artistic labour and skill, and above all points to the temporality of execution as an index of mastery over rep resentation. Either way, it helps to recast the image of a traditional painter, not as creating images out of a meditative trance through half open eyes and dupli cating formula from the past, but as one who encounters the world with keen eyes, trained hands and a vibrant imagination.
