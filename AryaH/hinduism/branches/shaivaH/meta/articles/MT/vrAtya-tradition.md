The earliest expression shaiva-mata (not just the worship of rudra) is seen in the vrata of the vrAtya, a ritual widely recorded in vaidika tradition. 

> अथैते व्रात्यस्तोमाः । दिव्या वै व्रात्या; व्रात्याम् अधावयन् बुधेन स्थपतिना । त एते व्रात्या आर्चन्न् इमं वैव यो ऽयं पवत ईशानं वा देवम् । 
> 
> Now (we shall expound these vrātya songs. The vrātya-s were verily divine. With Budha as their leader they ran after the vrātya-s. They, i.e., these vrātya-s, worshiped him, indeed he who blows here or the god īśāna.

This is the opening of the vrata section of the sAmaveda as specified by the jaiminIya brAhmaNa. A key point to note is the verb pavate, which should be understood as 'blows'. This links him vAyu-vAta & explains why the non-Zoroastrian Iranic tradition worshipped vAyu-vAta as the rudra class deity. It also explains the continuity between the archaic Indian vrata & Iranic rudrian vAyavya tradition as part of a common vrata tradition that spanned domains. 

The shaivamata should be understood as having its foundation in this shared Indo-Iranian tradition -- in this case the continuity was maintained down to the destruction of the Iranian religion by the marupishAcha-s in Central Asia.
