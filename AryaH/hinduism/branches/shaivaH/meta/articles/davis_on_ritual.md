### Preface    
IN THIS ESSAY, I attempt to take seriously a simple postulate that seems to  me fundamental to the study of ritual: that those who compose and perform  the ritual are conscious and purposeful agents actively engaged in a world  they themselves constitute, in large measure, through their practices of  knowing and acting.  

The "world" in which Saiva ritual takes place is not the familiar world of  Western science or "common sense" that modern Westerners often believe  common to all people. Nor does it occur in some sociologically defined uni verse of a particular community or society, as social anthropology might  portray. Rather, Saiva liturgy is performed in a world that is ontologically  organized and constituted by Saiva siddhanta: a world that oscillates, that is  permeated by the presence of Siva, in which humans live in a condition of  bondage, and where the highest aim of the human soul is to attain liberation  from its fetters. Within that world, the Saiva worshiper acts with and upon  forces, objects, and categories that are defined for him by Saiva ontology,  and his goals in practicing ritual are based on the possibilities and purposes  of human attainment depicted in Saiva soteriology.  

My aim in this study is to explicate, insofar as I am able, both the world  envisioned in Saiva siddhanta and the way in which daily worship reflects  and acts within that world. This world is assuredly not the one we think we  live in, but nevertheless it is a world we can enter, partially and temporarily,  through a mental "reenactment," as R. G. Collingwood put it. The Saivas  themselves would call it bhavana, "imaginative re-creation." For the  Saivas, as for Collingwood, this reconstructive praxis is primarily intellec tual and rational, rather than simply a matter of empathy. By rethinking  ourselves the convictions and intentions a well-versed Saiva ritualist of the  twelfth century would have brought to his daily practice, we can mentally  place ourselves in his temple and reenact his worship of Siva.  

To enter that world, it will be necessary to attend to two different modes  of discourse in Saiva literature: the propositional discourse of philosophical  knowledge (jMna) and the practical discourse of ritual action (kriya). These  are, in the Saiva view, integral and necessary to one another. According to  the Saiva siddhanta tradition, a Saiva agama should have four sections or  "feet" (padas) to be a complete, self-standing treatise. One section, the  jhanapada, describes how the world is; it sets forth, in metaphysical and  theological terms, the fundamental order of the universe as envisioned by  Saiva siddhanta. A second section, the kriyapada, prescribes how one  should conduct oneself in that world, utilizing the most powerful and effica-χ · Preface    

cious forms of action. (The other two sections, dealing with yogic discipli nary practices [yogapada] and proper day-to-day conduct [carydpada], are  also necessary but clearly subordinate in importance to the first two.) And  just as jnanapada and kriyapada are equally necessary to a complete  agama, Saiva authors insist that an aspirant who wishes to advance within  the world of Siva must exert himself both to know that world and to act  properly and effectively within it.  

Unfortunately, the applicability of this principle to my own study was not  always so apparent to me. When I first began to study the Saiva agamas, I  was like a commentator whom Ramakantha criticizes. In his own commentary  on the Matangaparame&varagama, Ramakantha contrasts himself with this  other, unnamed commentator of the same text who ended his explication  after the jnanapada.  

A certain commentator who knew only philosophy completed an extensive exam ination of the knowledge section (Jnanapada), and altogether disregarded the  three practical sections concerning ritual action, yoga, and proper conduct.  Whereas I, honoring the Lord Siva, will here compose a lucid exposition of those  sections as well, because the types of action prescribed here conform (anuga)  completely with the meanings of the philosophical discourse.  

He was engaged only by philosophy; I was concerned solely with ritual. As  a historian interested in temple ritual and its relation to medieval Indian po litical formations, I wished to read only those practical portions of the  agamas dealing with kriya, and not waste time with what I considered spec ulative metaphysics. I believed I would be able to discern the significance  of medieval Saiva ritual texts directly by locating them in the context of the  social and political structures of medieval South India. I was certainly mis taken in this presumption.  

To be fair to myself, the commentator that Ramakanfha criticized and I are  not the only ones ever to have pursued such shaky, one-legged inquiries. In  fact, the large majority of scholarly studies dealing with Indian rituals make  no recourse to the philosophical foundations on which the rituals are based.  They characteristically present Indian rituals as instances of highly elaborate  routinized behavior either divorced from any formative consciousness or  based on severely flawed apprehensions of the world. On the other side, it  is only the rare study of an Indian philosophical school that makes any ex tended reference to such practical corollaries as modes of proper conduct or  ritual activity. Scholars most often portray Hindu theology as the exercise of  great intellectual ingenuity with little or no concern for practical conse quence. So in focusing my attention on only one limb of the body of thought  and action I wished to study, I was simply following the habitude of my  scholarly field. 

Preface · xi    

As I commenced reading the account of daily worship in Kamikagama,  however, I soon realized that I was missing something. At first I saw it as  a problem of terminology or technical language. What were the five kalas,  or the twelve kalas, or the thirty-eight kalas, to which the text kept refer 

ring? Who were the VidyeSvaras, the Man<Jale§varas, and numerous other su perhuman characters who periodically showed up in the ritual terrain? What  did it mean for the worshiper to "make his hand into Siva" (SivJkarana)? Why  should a bubhuksu and a mumuksu do things in reverse order? My Sanskrit  dictionaries were of little or no avail in tracking down the significance of  these, and many other, mystifying terms. With timely help from more expe 

rienced scholars in South India, however, I learned that many of the terms  I could not comprehend in the kriydpada were discussed in the jMnapada,  and so I began reading philosophical digests and commentaries in addition  to my ritual texts. Soon I was able to ferret out the meanings of most of the  bothersome terms and to gain a preliminary idea of what was going on in the  ritual.  

Yet clearing up perplexing terminology was only a first step. It slowly  dawned on me that the shared terminology of the two sections was not fortu itous. As the Saivas would put it, the fetter that was causing my ignorance  gradually "ripened," and its grip upon me loosened, enabling me finally to  see the principle of "conformity" (anuga) or connectedness of jfiana and  kriya to which Ramakantha so clearly refers. The two sections were meant to  be mutually explanatory; with good reason were they called two feet of the  same entity. Belatedly I started to follow a more conscious two-footed ap proach in my own reading and research, stepping back and forth between  ritual texts and philosophical texts, and found that each helped clarify and  explicate the other. The rituals served to illuminate and objectify Saiva  philosophical categories and topics, while philosophy helped me to under stand the purposes and strategies of Saiva ritual.  

More than that, I began to see that the Saiva texts envision a world—the  world, they would say—in which the capacities of humans to know about  that world and to act within it are two interrelated modalities of a unitary  power of consciousness. According to Saiva siddhanta, every animate  being, beginning with Siva, has a soul, whose principal characteristic is  "consciousness" (cit). Consciousness, in turn, manifests itself through two  primary powers: the power to know (Jnanasakti) and the power to act  (kriyasakti). Yet these two powers are not fundamentally distinct. Siva's  power, AghoraSiva tells us, is in essence a single power. However, because  of an "apparent" distinction (upddhi) between the spheres of knowing and  practical activity, this power seems to take on forms suitable to its tasks in  each domain (TPV 3). Similarly, what we humans experience as two sepa rate capacities, to know and to act, is, in the highest sense, the integral 

xii · Preface    

power of consciousness as it directs itself toward the seemingly distinct do mains of the knowable and the doable. From the highest point of view, the  powers of consciousness are one and the domains in which the powers act  are one; from our more limited human perspective, the unitary power ap pears divided and the single field for its exercise seems differentiated. The  conformity we observe now between the philosophical and ritual portions of  

the Saiva texts results, in the Saiva view, from this fundamental integrity.  The metaphysical unity of knowledge and action in Saiva siddhanta pro vides the underlying theme and the end point of this study. I will follow  an oscillating course throughout, back and forth between accounts of the  philosophically constructed world of Saiva jfiana and explication of Saiva  kriyd within that world, in an attempt to demonstrate and illustrate the inte gral relationship between these two modes of Saiva religious consciousness.  At the outset I can only point to the complex intertwining of knowing and  acting in Saiva siddhanta; in the course of the discussion to follow, it will  take on a more definite shape and texture. In the end I hope to indicate that  the "distinction" between philosophical knowledge and ritual action, while  useful and necessary as a starting point for the study of Saiva worship, be comes increasingly indistinct as we delve into it, much as the Saiva philoso phers themselves speak of the division between knowing and acting as only  an "apparent" dichotomy of a fundamentally unified human capacity of  consciousness.

AT THE COMMENCEMENT of daily worship, a Saiva ritualist constructs a  new "body of mantras" by superimposing onto himself a host of powers  greater than his own. He is then able to make use of that augmented body in  performing all subsequent acts of devotion. Writing this book has not ex actly been an act of puja, but I too have benefited from and relied on the  support and assistance of many powers beyond my own in the course of this  study. I would like to invoke each here with the appropriate namaskara.  

My initial research in India, the bija of all that follows, was facilitated  through the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute in Madras, the Sarasvati  Mahal Library in Thanjavur, and the Institut Frangais d'Indologie in Pon dicl^ry. I was very fortunate to read Saiva ritual texts with Dr. S. S. Janaki,  Director of the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, and philosophical  texts with T. R. Damodaran, formerly with the Sarasvati Mahal Library.  Both helped me in myriad ways during my stay in India, and I thank them  for their friendship. I wish also to thank Sn K. A. Sabharatna Sivacarya of  Madras, whose command of agama-based Saiva ritual, both practical and  textual, is of a kind rarely encountered among Saiva priests nowadays. His  demonstrations and explications helped immensely in making the mil lenium-old agama texts come alive for me. He was also kind enough to let  me photograph his enactment of rites of daily worship.  

Three scholars associated with the Institut Frangais d'Indologie deserve  special mention: N. R. Bhatt, Ηέΐέηε Brunner, and Bruno Dagens. Pandit  Bhatt generously went over my early translations of the Kamikagama, pa tiently answering my endless questions, and Dr. Brunner sent me a valuable  set of comments and suggestions on a Kriyakranuidyotika translation. Pro fessor Dagens perceptively discussed the project in its early stages and later  on made detailed suggestions on a written draft. More than this personal  assistance, however, their careful and painstaking work in the field of  saivdgama studies over the past twenty-five years, collecting, editing, and  translating, provides the foundation on which any future research rests. It  would not be possible for me to cite all the places in this study where I have  relied on their insights and authority.  

At the University of Chicago, where the project germinated as a disserta tion, I benefited greatly from day-to-day contact with a whole community of  South Asian scholars. In particular, I would like to thank the members of  my committee, A. K. Ramanujan and Bernard Cohn, for their support  

throughout. Ronald Inden, my adviser, has been especially important at  every stage of this manuscript. He initially pointed me toward the study of 

xiv * Acknowledgments    

$aiva siddhanta texts, and through numerous conversations he suggested  new paths to explore in the material when I saw none. It is his combination  of critical rigor and breadth of interest that I have sought, albeit imperfecdy,  to emulate in my study.  

The Department of Religious Studies at Yale University, where the proj ect made that difficult metamorphosis from dissertation to book, has pro vided a supportive and stimulating environment for research.  

Truly the mulamantra at the root of any research project in these times is  funding. Support for research in India was provided by the U.S. Department  of Education through a Fulbright-Hays fellowship. The USEF-I officers ad ministering the grant in Delhi and Madras were always helpful to me. For  writing up the dissertation, I enjoyed the support of the Mrs. Giles Whiting  Foundation and the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, University of  Chicago. Final preparations have been assisted through the grace of an  A. Whitney Griswold Faculty Research Grant, the Frederick W. Hilles  Fund, and the Morse Fellowship in the Humanities at Yale University.  

Hank Heifetz transmitted some esoteric WordPerfect mantras to me at a  crucial moment. Charles Bryan, a graphics student at the Yale School of  Art, transformed several of my initial drawings into finished form. Several  other persons read earlier versions of this study and helped remove many of  its lingering fetters: Charles Collins, Ginni Ishimatsu, Ralph Strohl, Cyn thia Talbot, and two anonymous readers at Princeton University Press. Finally, I want to thank Rita McCleary, whose careful editing and countless  suggestions are responsible for much of whatever clarity exists in this work.  Om ham sarvebhyo namah.

Ritual in an Oscillating Universe 

  



### INTRODUCTION    

Locating the Tradition  

THIS IS a study of the inner world of the Hindu temple: the world, that is,  constructed and acted upon by the priests who perform the liturgical rounds  that animate and maintain a temple as a living place of worship. To compre hend this world, we will reenact the central ritual of temple Hinduism, seek ing as we do to reconstruct as well the metaphysical setting within which  this ritual makes sense and from which it derives its efficacy for those who  perform it.  

"Daily worship" (p&jd, nityapuja) is the ubiquitous Hindu ritual form by  which devotees of a divinity regularly offer tokens of their respect and ado ration to that deity embodied in an image or icon. It is the most common and  recurrent ritual action of Hindu temples, and in many respects it is paradig matic for the entire system of temple ritual as it developed in medieval  India. As a general ritual pattern, pUja has myriad variations. Each Hindu  order articulates its own version of piija, suitable for the particular god or  goddess to whom it is directed and adapted to its own particular theological  convictions.1  

Here I will focus on the complex formulation of daily worship articulated  by the Saiva siddhanta school during the early medieval period, and re corded in a corpus of Saiva agama and paddhati texts compiled in roughly  the eighth through twelfth centuries.2 The Saiva siddhanta texts offer with out a doubt one of the most complete, detailed, and interesting descriptions  of medieval Hindu liturgical practice, and one that is to some extent still  authoritative today in South Indian temples.  

More specifically, I will draw principally on two fundamental texts of this  tradition: the Kamikagama, which provides a full discussion of public tem ple worship, and AghoraSiva's Knyakramadyotika, a twelfth-century pad dhati that gives the most influential Saiva siddhanta account of private wor ship.3 Concentrating on the ritual prescriptions (yidhi) for daily worship  contained in these two texts will enable us to comprehend much of the met aphysical world of Saiva siddhanta, for Saiva puja acts as a virtual precis of  Saiva siddhanta theology, a daily catechism in action for worshipers who  undertake it with diligence and mindfulness.  

Before we enter the inner world of the medieval Saiva masters and begin  this imaginative reenactment of nityapuja, however, it will be useful to lo cate the Saiva siddhanta order outwardly, as a historical religious commu nity that defined itself and formulated its theological and ritual system in a  

larger cosmopolitical setting. Saiva siddhanta is nowadays a significant4 • Introduction    

school of Hindu philosophy and religious practice prevalent only in the  South Indian state of Tamilnad. However, in the early medieval period with  which we will be primarily concerned, Saiva siddhanta was a school of Pan Indian scope enjoying close ties with the political order and often exercising  decisive control over the principal religious and social institutions of the  time. Let us begin not with the Saiva priests and adepts themselves, but with  one of the great patrons of medieval Saivism, the Cola king Rajaraja I.  

RAJARAJA'S GREAT TEMPLE  

In 985 C.E., when RajarSja I became king, the Cola kingdom was a modest  one. Under Rajaraja's great-grandfather ParaAtaka I, it had expanded rapidly  to include much of South India. But in 953 the Rastrakuta king Krsna ΙΠ  marched from the north against the upstart Colas and defeated them deci 

sively at the battle of Takkolam. Thirty-two years of retreat, dynastic confu sion, and gradual rebuilding followed for the Cola royalty. By the time of  Rajaraja's consecration, the Colas had reconsolidated their sovereignty in  the Kaveri River basin of Tamilnad and had acquired some territories be yond their traditional regional center.4  

Once he became king, Rajaraja began a series of military campaigns. As  he explained in his inscriptions, he became convinced, "in his life of blos soming strength," that "the great goddess Earth, as well as the goddess of  Fortune, had become his wife." Because of this conviction, he "graciously"  conquered kings in every direction, extending his sovereignty until he was  "so resplendent that he was worshiped everywhere."5 These campaigns  went on for nearly twenty years, until almost all of India south of the Tun 

gabhadra, as well as parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands, owed hom age to the Cola king. In his own terms, he accomplished a "conquest of the  quarters" (digvijaya) and made all kings into his tributaries; he then returned  to dwell in his own city, Thanjavur.  

In 1003, the nineteenth year of his reign and near the completion of these  military campaigns, Rajaraja began construction of an imperial temple in  the capital. By the time of its consecration six or so years later, the  RajarajeSvara stood as the most massive temple in India: a granite tower of  fourteen stories 190 feet high, with a base 96 feet square, set in a rectangu 

lar courtyard 500 feet by 250 feet. The primary icon of the temple was a  colossal Siva-linga, probably the largest such linga in existence. The octago nal dome at the top of the tower, directly above the central linga, was com posed of a single huge stone, weighing about eighty tons, that according to  tradition was conveyed to the top by means of a ramp four miles long. The  temple was sometimes called the "Dak§inameru," or World-Mountain of the  South, and indeed it must have towered above the Cola landscape like a  world-mountain.6  

The purpose of this monumental structure was to provide a home for the 

Locating the Tradition - S    

divinity that Rajaraja and his retinue considered the preeminent overlord of  the cosmos, so that the god would come to receive the homage and offerings  of devotion presented by the king, his family, and his kingdom. The god  was Siva, referred to in the inscriptions variously as RajarajeSvara ("Lord of  Rajaraja"), AiJavallan ("Master of Dance"), and Dak^inameravitaAkar ("Lord  of the Southern World-Mountain"). Siva typically dwells upon Mount Kai lasa, the Uttarameru or Northern World-Mountain. It is a measure of the  ambition embodied in this imperial act that Rajaraja could portray himself  as having offered Siva a new home in the south, equal to Siva's Himalayan  abode.  

To serve Siva and the other divine inhabitants of the temple, Rajaraja and  his royal entourage made extensive donations and endowments, many of  which are recorded on the stone walls of the temple.7 Rajaraja himself pre sented gold articles weighing almost five hundred pounds troy weight, silver  

objects of more than six hundred pounds troy, and myriad jewels. The  king's elder sister Kundavai, the second most generous donor, gave about  a hundred pounds of gold and almost two hundred pounds of silver and jew els. Rajaraja also gave land, making over the royal share of produce from  numerous villages throughout his dominion and as far afield as Sri Lanka.  These endowments yielded an annual income of roughly a quarter million  bushels of rice paddy. To supply ghee for cooking and for burning oil  lamps, livestock was donated to the temple. One inscription details 2,832  cows, 1,644 ewes, and 30 she-buffalos that were assigned to 366 cowherds,  who were in turn required to supply ghee to the temple at the rate of one  ulakku (roughly half a pint) per day for every 48 cows or 96 ewes. (An  ulakku of ghee per day will keep a "perpetual lamp" burning continuously.)  Arrangements were also made for the regular supply of such cooking ingre dients and condiments as fruit, pulse, pepper, tamarind, mustard, cumin,  sugar, curds, plantains, salt, greens, areca nut, and betel leaves. All of these  were necessary for the regular offerings of worship on a suitably grand  scale, and for the even grander special offerings made during the several  "great festivals" held annually.8  

A religious institution on such a scale of course required personnel as  well as endowments. As the temple inscriptions record it, the king arranged  for other temples throughout the realm to supply dancers, some four hun dred in all, to entertain Siva. Forty-eight musicians along with two drum mers were assigned to the regular recitation of the Tevaram hymns com posed by the Tamil Saiva saints. The assemblies of brahman settlements  (brahmadeyas) were required to furnish young students to act as temple ser vants and accountants. Other villages were called upon to send people for  carrying out such diverse services at the temple as holding the parasol  (eleven persons), lighting lamps (eight persons), and sprinkling water on the  deities (four persons); also required were potters, washermen, barbers, as trologers, tailors, jewel-stitchers, braziers, carpenters, and goldsmiths. 

6 • Introduction    

Priests (acaryas) were brought in from all parts of the subcontinent to  execute the liturgical program. One inscription details the provisions made  for them: each year roughly forty-five hundred bushels of paddy were to be  supplied for the head priest Sarvasivapandita, his worthy students, and his stu dents' students, who were natives of AryadeSa (North India), MadhyadeSa  (the Deccan), and GaudadeSa (Bengal).  

While Rajaraja's imperial temple is one of the most impressive and best documented medieval religious structures of South Asia, it is by no means  unique. Throughout the subcontinent during the half millennium between  700 and 1200 C.E., and longer in the south, Hindu kings sought to outdo one  another in the scale and lavishness of the temples they constructed. Ca lukyas, Pallavas, Rastrakutas, Pratiharas, Colas, Kalacuiis, Candellas—a  number of Hindu dynasties centered in various parts of the subcontinent  staked claims to imperial status at some point during the early medieval  period, and each sought to solidify and display its position through the con struction of appropriately commanding stone monuments.  

Even Rajaraja's son and successor, Rajendra I (1012-1044), performed a  second digvijaya, extending still further the domain owing homage to the  Cola crown, and then returned to construct thirty-five miles from Thanjavur  a wholly new capital city, named Gangaikondacolapuram ("the city of the  Cola king who took the Ganges"). In the midst of the new capital Rajendra  built yet another imperial-scale Saiva temple, to rival in its authoritative  presence the edifice of his father.  

TEMPLE HINDUISM  

The ideological setting for Rajaraja's and Rajendra's building programs was  a particular historical formation I will here simply call "temple Hinduism,"  which became the dominant religious and political order of South Asia in  the seventh and eighth centuries, and which remained so for five hundred  years.9 Temple Hinduism consisted of a number of distinct schools of  thought that nevertheless largely shared both a body of ideas about how the  cosmos was organized and a set of practices that enabled followers to act  most efficaciously in that cosmos. These practices not only sought to bring  the agent personally into relation with God and to transform his or her con dition, but they also collectively engendered the relations of community,  authority, and hierarchy within human society. Though it drew upon earlier  Indian formations such as the Vedic sacrificial system, temple Hinduism  clearly distinguished itself from Vedism in several fundamental respects.  

Temple Hinduism directs itself primarily toward two gods, Visnu and Siva.  Each is viewed by his votaries as the highest overlord of the cosmos, the  transcendent and encompassing divinity. The supreme character of the di vinity is repeatedly expressed in appellations such as Purusa ("cosmic Per son"), paramesvara ("the highest Lord"), and visvesvara ("Lord of every-

Locating the Tradition · 7    

thing")· Yet, transcendent as they are believed to be, these gods are also  fully immanent, pervasive throughout the cosmos, and capable of manifest ing themselves visibly in the world through incarnation (avatara), emana tion (vyiiha), or embodiment (murti) in order to enter into direct relations  with other divinities and lesser beings such as humans. Schools might differ  from one another as to which divinity is supreme, but they share the theo logical premise that, to be supreme, God must be both transcendent and  immanent.  

The other divinities who inhabit the universe recognize the superiority of  Vi§nu and Siva. Narratives in the purdnas, cosmogonic texts of temple Hindu ism, often recount the events by which lesser gods such as Indra and Agni,  who were paramount in the Vedas, have been brought to this recognition.  Likewise, Saiva purdnas also feature accounts where Siva's main contem porary competitors for supremacy, Visnu and Brahman, assent to Siva's pre 

eminence. Accordingly, subordinate deities appear most often as acolytes  and devotees, and occasionally as aspects, of the highest god.  Relations between the high gods and humans are, likewise and even more  so, asymmetrical and hierarchical, not reciprocal as in the Vedas. The  proper attitude for a person to take toward Vi§nu or Siva is that of bhakti:  recognition of the god's superiority, devoted attentiveness, and desire to  participate in his exalted domain. The god is in no way compelled by human  devotion, nor by any ritual action humans may undertake (as the Vedic exe getes claimed of sacrificial ritual), but he may freely choose to grant favor  (prasada) or grace (anugraha) to those humans who have properly recog nized and served him.  

Such acts of divine generosity of course have profound transformative  consequences for their recipients. They bring one worldly benefits (bhoga),  but much more important within this system of values, they lead one toward  liberation (moksa), the highest state to which a human may aspire. (The  Vedas, by contrast, may enable one to obtain worldly ends but do not envis 

age the superior goal of moksa, charge the advocates of temple Hinduism.)  Liberation is conceptualized in various ways by the different schools of  Hindu thought. Moksa always involves leaving behind the sufferings and  fetters that constitute our normal worldly existence, but it may lead one,  according to which school one follows, to a merging with the godhead, to  permanent service at the feet of the Lord, to autonomous and parallel divin ity, or to some other final and ultimate state. The character of liberation was  one of the major points of contention among the theological schools that  developed during this period.  

The internal attitude of bhakti is most visibly externalized in temple Hin duism through ritual action, of which pujd is the model. In this sense, piijd  replaces the Vedic sacrifice (yajna) as the paradigmatic ritual act of Indian  religiosity during this period. In puja, a worshiper invokes or invites the  deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and

symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offer ings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of  his praises, music, dance, and songs. Texts classify all these material and  performatoiy presentations to the deity as "services" (upacara). Vi§nu and  Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a vari ety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may  see them and make their offerings of homage.  

In many respects, Hindu puja carries on the central ritual concerns of  Vedic yajna. Both center on acts whereby humans offer food to the gods.  Both require that the human participants attain a personal state of purity or  godliness consonant with the solemnity of the ritual action, and both pro vide means through which divinities are summoned to be present at the rit 

ual terrain. Once invoked, the divinities are treated with all the respect due  them and presented with a repast of the finest order. In most cases the re mainders of the meal are subsequently distributed among the community of  human worshipers in a prescribed hierarchical order. Both, accordingly, in volve an enactment of proper relations between humans and deities, as these  are understood by each, and may articulate as well status relationships  within the human community.  

However, several fundamental features clearly distinguish puja from the  Vedic form of worship. Vedic deities when invoked remain invisible. In  puja deities are summoned to inhabit material embodiments and so make  their presence evident even to humans of limited vision. Sacrificial offerings  cannot be presented directly to the divinities; another deity, the fire god  Agni, is required to act as intermediary, conveying the offerings to the other  gods. Offerings of puja, by contrast, may be made directly to the highest  god in the central image and to other subsidiary deities also present in their  own individual embodiments. And as temple Hinduism seeks to render rela 

tions between humans and divinities more visible and direct, it also attempts  to instantiate them more permanently. While Vedic public sacrifices are per formed in temporary ritual settings constructed for the occasion, public puja  (pararthapuja) takes place in a durable structure, built to last out of stone or  brick and elegantly decorated by sculptors and painters. Such a temple  serves as an enduring home for the divine image and for the god himself  who dwells within it.  

During the early medieval period, the temple became the dominant reli gious institution of South Asia. Myriad temples of every scale were con structed and dedicated not only to the two primary divinities but also to the  many lesser divinities who (at least in the view of Vaisnavas and Saivas) occu pied lower rungs in the hierarchy of lordship. As the permanent residence of  the deity in a particular community, the temple became much more than  simply the site of puja offerings. It acted as host to a wide assortment of  both personal and communal activities, ritual and otherwise. It provided the  stage upon which performing and literary arts developed. As employer,

landholder, and moneylender, it was often the major economic institution of  the community. It occupied the social center of the community, and it was  a primary arena in which relationships of authority and rank were consti tuted, contested, and displayed.10  

To sponsor a temple was a central act of devotion. Because it made pos sible all subsequent offerings, it was considered a foundational and most  efficacious ritual action. As offering public sacrifices had been in an earlier  time, so during this period an essential act of rule was to sponsor and endow  temples within one's dominion. This was true not just for independent and  imperial kings, but also for subordinate regional chieftains and for local  headmen or assemblies who exercised authority within their smaller and en compassed domains. Of course, at different levels of organization the re sources available would also differ. Architectural texts gave directions for  the construction of temples ranging from modest single-story shrines to vast  towers of twelve or more stories, and liturgical texts like Kamikagama  prescribed nine different gradations of puja offerings, ranging from "low est of low" to "highest of high," that a temple should follow "according  to its capacity." The size and wealth of a temple, accordingly, often served  as the visible index not only of the degree of religious aspiration of its build ers, but also of the scale of polity responsible for its construction and  maintenance.  

Building a temple, then, became a highly visible political act as well as  one of devotion. For instance, only a "king of kings" whose kingdom in cluded within it smaller, subordinated kingdoms, such as Rajaraja's did,  was considered qualified to construct a "preeminent temple" (mukhyapra sada), which was said to include within itself the various types of smaller  temples.11 Rajaraja's imperial temple, in this light, was not simply a matter  of a warrior turning his attention from military to religious matters in his  dotage. He intended it rather as the completion of his "conquest of the quar ters," a highly visible proclamation and embodiment of his political  achievement, which at the same time located this earthly accomplishment in  relation to diva's sovereignty over the entire universe. King over other  kings, subject to no other human lord, Rajaraja yet proclaims his fealty to  Siva.  

THE AGAMAS  

A new genre of liturgical texts became prominent during the early medieval  period, explicitly non-Vedic in origin and directed primarily toward the  temple cults of Visnu and Siva. This genre comprises the Vaispava samhitas,  the Saiva agamas, and somewhat later, the Sakta tantras centered on the  Goddess. I will focus here on the Saiva agamas, but much of what I say  applies equally to the samhitas and tantras. Like so many others in the field  of Indian studies, this extensive body of literature was largely dismissed and 

10 * Introduction    

left unexplored by scholars until recently. Yet it is a rich and diverse corpus  of texts and offers one of the most important sources we have for under standing the formation and development of temple Hinduism.  

A Saiva agama consists, ideally, of four "feet," or portions: knowledge  (jMna), ritual action (kriya), proper conduct (carya), and discipline (yoga).  Together, these four parts constitute everything worth knowing from a spir itual point of view; the section on knowledge reveals how the cosmos is  organized, and the other three sections fully instruct one who adheres to that  view of the world in how to act in it. As the Vayusamhita, borrowing a trope  from the Mahabharata, puts it, "Whatever is said in the other treatises, one  finds that in the Saiva agamas; and that which one does not find in the Saiva  agamas, is not found anywhere else."12  

The primary focus of the texts, however, is clearly on religious practice.  The agamas spell out in detail the organization of the temple cult, from the  ritual procedures and architectural guidelines needed to construct and ani mate Saiva temples, through the regular program of daily worship and sub sidiary rites, to the much larger occasional festivals. Many of the texts elab orate a pattern as well for daily household ritual, which parallels the daily  temple cult. They set forth a sequence of transformative rituals—initiations  and consecrations—that progressively incorporate the subject into the Saiva  community, move him toward liberation, and empower him to act as a tem ple priest or adept. In this respect, the agamas provide liturgical compen diums for Saiva priests (dcdrya), for renunciatory adepts (sadhaka), and for  committed householders worshiping at home shrines. They are the primary  ritual texts of medieval Saivism.  

According to the lists contained in nearly every text, the canon of Saiva  agamas consists in 28 "root" treatises (mulagama) and some 197 "subsidi ary" treatises (upagama).13 Despite this profusion, the texts repeatedly tell  us that the system of knowledge (Sivajnana) they express is unitary. They  view themselves as a single textual coipus. As the Kamikagama has it, each  agama represents a part of the body that is the whole of the sivajndna: the  Kanukagama is its feet, the Yogajagama represents its ankles, and so on up  to the Kiranagama as its jewelry and Vatulagama as its garments (KA 1.93- 101).  

They are fundamentally united, they claim, because all agamas originate  from a single source, namely from the highest god, Siva. Initially, the texts  say, the knowledge embodied in the agamas exists not in any verbal formu lation, but as "undifferentiated sound" or "pure thought," which has not yet  assumed any apparent divisions, but which contains immanently all there is  to know. During the process of emission (srsti), by which all things become  differentiated, Siva divides this unitary and subtle knowledge into a number  of versions, and in so doing transforms it into an auditory form (sabdarupa)  accessible to lower categories of beings. He emits it, according to some 

LocatingtheTradition - 11    

texts, in a series of "streams" (srotas) that issue from the five faces of  Sadaiiva.14 These differentiated verbal versions of the originally unitary  jnana are then passed on to a number of divine auditors, who in turn pass  them on to others.  

Eventually the dgamas reach the ears of humans, a momentous event.  The first human auditors of the dgamas are always rj/s, sages portrayed as the  most highly accomplished of all humans. The instruction may take place at  diva's dwelling on Mount Kailasa or in a forest hermitage such as the fa 

mous Narayanasrama. The sages approach the god and, desiring to hear the  superior knowledge of a Saivagama^ humbly request the god to teach them.  Here, for instance, is the setting in which SrikaQtha, a manifest form of Siva,  narrates the Kamikagama to an eminent coterie of pupils.  

On the southern peak of marvelous Kailasa, veiled by the shade of full-grown fig  trees, on a seat sparkling with jewels, clothed in the skin of a tiger, the great god  Siikantha, lord of all, was attended by gods, demons, heavenly musicians, divine  magicians, demigods, and still others.  

KauSika, KaSyapa, Agastya, Gautama, and Narada, Sanatkumara, Sanaka,  Sanatana, and Sanandana, Bhrgu, Atri, Bharadvaj a, Vasi stha, and others—all  these great sages desired to know the highest knowledge. They looked up at Siva  and Sakti, bowed at his feet, and addressed the Lord, Protector of Uma:  

"Blessed One, you are the Lord of the Gods of Gods. You untie the fetters  that bind the soul. You are the cause of emission, preservation, veiling,  reabsorption, and grace. You instantaneously set in motion the great mSya,  made up of Ether and the other elements. You are joined with the highest  Sakti, whose very form is complete intelligence. You are free from direc 

tion, space, and time. You bring joy to living beings. We have been ordered  by you, O Lord of Gods, to perform the worship of Siva. Out of compassion  for your devotees, please deign to tell us, O Lord of Gods, the system of  knowledge which came from Siva's mouth, and its meaning in essence."  

Asked in this way by the sages, the Lord whose flag bears the bull and whose  crown bears the gleaming half-moon answered in a deep voice.  "You have asked well. So listen, you who have fulfilled your vows, to the  highest system, which was extracted from the great text called 'Kamika.'  This system first appeared on Mount Meru, and has been passed on by  Pranava and others. It is the most complete system, containing ritual action  (kriya) and proper conduct (carya) as well as discipline (yoga) and knowl edge (jMna)."  

The sages, addressed thus, fell to the ground and bowed. Having given them  a command, Siva now taught this unsurpassed text. (KA 1.1-14)  

Siva goes on to set forth his teachings with the serene authority of om niscience.  

Siva addresses his instruction to an audience of the converted: those gods, 

12 * Introduction    

sages, and human followers who already recognize and accept his pre eminence. As these teachings are handed down in distinct agama texts, they  remain the exclusive possession of Saiva priests and initiates; others are, in  fact, excluded from hearing them.  

If uninitiated members of the three twice-born classes, persons born in the SMra  class, persons born of mixed parentage such as the savarna group, architects (ii7- pin), artisans, and the like should study the Saiva treatises, the king and kingdom  will be quickly destroyed on account of that sin. So the king should prevent  them. (KA 1.111-12)  

For such a select audience there is little need for polemic directed at other  religious groups or doctrines. There is, however, great need for practical  instruction. Most of the contents of the agamas concern ritual activity. Siva  sets forth, most often in the optative mood, those actions best calculated to  lead his auditors to the highest states of attainment. Subsequent members of  the Saiva community have carefully guarded and preserved these instruc tions, regularly copying over the manuscripts and passing them on to new  priestly generations over many centuries.  

Because the agamas consider themselves human recensions of what was  originally uttered by Siva, they do not lend themselves to precise dating. As  divine revelations of a universal knowledge, the agamas eschew all refer ences that might tie them down to particular times and places. Further, their  own theory of origination, involving a gradual emanation and successive  transmission, implies an openness to textual emendation and accretion. As  the SivajMna, while remaining fundamentally one, has been differentiated  and emitted over time, so human redactors of the agamas have on occasion  felt it necessary to add new formulations of Saiva thought and practice inso far as they cohere with the basic unity of the teachings. The result, from a  historicist point of view, is a corpus of texts that is maddeningly diverse in  compositional chronology.  

Undoubtedly many agamas were in existence by 700 C.E. The Pallava  king Narasimhavarman Π (695-728) refers to himself as "one who has re moved all his impurity (mala) by following the path of Saiva siddhanta" in  his foundation inscription on the Siva Kailasanatha temple of Kancipuram,  the largest imperial edifice built by the Pallavas. Among his royal titles in scribed there, he styles himself a "follower of the agamas" and "one whose  means of knowledge is the agamas."15 The South Indian sage Tlrumular  mentions nine agamas by name in his work of perhaps the seventh century,  Tirumantiram. But the agamas available to Narasimhavarman and Tiru mular are not necessarily the agamas that have been passed down to us.  

One of the texts Iirumular refers to is the Kamikagama, often described  as the "first" or "primary" agama. This text is also mentioned by name in  the Sutasamhita, which may also date from the seventh century. No doubt 

Locating the Tradition · 13    

a Kamikagama existed at an early time. Yet most portions of the Kami kagama that we have undoubtedly reflect the much larger scale of temple  construction and liturgy that developed in later centuries in South India. Its  architectural portions, for instance, follow those of the Mayamata, which  correspond to the Cola architecture of the eleventh century.16 Ritual pre 

scriptions are, in several cases, parallel to the prescriptions given in the di gests of SomaSambhu (of the late eleventh century) and AghoraSiva (twelfth  century). (I speak here primarily of the Purva Kamikagama; the second di vision, the Uttara Kamikagama, is perhaps later still.)17  

We must assume that a highly esteemed text like the Kamikagama would  be subject to a complex process of revision, both reflecting and guiding  developments and changes in the knowledge and practice of the Saiva com munity. I would propose, as a tentative approximation, that the most signif icant recasting of the Kamikagama took place in Tamilnad during the elev enth century, in light of Cola-period temple culture, and under the strong  influence of the Saiva siddhanta school. Some of its contents are no doubt  older than this, and some have been added since, but the weight of the text  is grounded, it seems to me, in that period.  

With some other agamas we can be on surer chronological ground, at  least as to their tennini ad quem. The oldest extant agama manuscript, of  the Kiranagama, was transcribed in 924 C.E.18 The Mrgendragama was com mented upon by the Kashmiri Saiva siddhanta author NarayaQakaQtha in the  late tenth or early eleventh century, and his commentary in turn was glossed  by AghoraSiva in the mid-twelfth century.19 In cases such as these, we can  be certain that the texts we have correspond to versions available in the tenth  century, and perhaps earlier. Beyond this, however, scholars of the Saiva  agamas have only begun to develop the means of distinguishing different  chronological strata within the texts. Until such an internal archeology is  more fully established, efforts to trace the development of pre-tenth-centuiy  Saivism within the agamas are premature.  

As we have seen, the agamas assert an overall coherence while recogniz ing at the same time the differentiation within the genre. "Like the sparkling  gem Cintamani," says Kamikagama, "the Saiva teachings appear as both  one and many. Although they are unitary because of their speaker [Siva],  they are also multiple because they are divided into streams [as the gem,  while a single object, glistens with many beams]" (KA 1.103). Indeed,  within the agamas is a diversity of teachings. They present neither a single  philosophically consistent doctrine, nor a unified liturgical system; rather,  they offer us a variegated, multiple body of Saiva thought. On many basic  matters, the agamas appear in complete agreement. Yet within the corpus  one finds fundamental points of disagreement as well. Some agamas argue  a monist metaphysics, while others are decidedly dualist. Some claim that  ritual is the most efficacious means of religious attainment, while others14 - Introduction    

assert that knowledge is more important. They advance different lists of the  basic constituents of material being, the tattvasP0 Such differences in the  texts of course reflect the various "streams" of thought within a large and  geographically extensive Saiva community as it developed in the early  medieval period.  

If the agama corpus, like CintamaQi, was both one and many, the  "schools" of Saivism that formed themselves in the early medieval period  took it as their task to formulate from this diverse canon a coherent doctrine,  one that could hold up in philosophical debate. Yet, as it turned out, more  than one unity subsisted within the agamas. Different Saiva schools articu 

lated quite different philosophical viewpoints, yet each based its doctrines  on the authority of the agamas. The dualist Saiva siddhanta, the strict mo nist Kashmiri schools of Trika and Pratyabhijfia, and the VIraSaivas of Kar nataka, to name the most noteworthy, all claimed allegiance to the Saiva  

agamas.21 Of these, we are concerned here only with the Saiva siddhanta.  

ŚAIVA SIDDHANTA  

The temple of Rajaraja reflects the teachings of one particular agama-based  school of Saivism, the Saiva siddhanta. Indeed, there are many reasons to  suppose that this was the most prominent Hindu order in early medieval  Tamilnad. Even today, Saiva siddhanta is an important school of Hindu phi 

losophy in Tamilnad, and temples in the region most often claim allegiance  to Saiva siddhanta liturgical texts.  

It is difficult to be precise about the origins of Saiva siddhanta as a dis tinct order. Sometime around the ninth century, it seems, Saiva siddhanta  appeared as part of a division within the larger Saiva community. The works  of the monist theologian Saiikara and his successors provide a useful index  for this shift. Writing probably at the very beginning of the ninth century,  Sankara speaks in his commentary on BrahmasUtra 2.2.37 of a single order  of Saiva dualists, which he calls "MaheSvaras." The MaheSvaras are else 

where called PaSupatas. The mid-ninth-century commentaries of Vacaspati  MiSra and Bhaskaracarya, by contrast, distinguish four categories of Saivas:  the Saiva, PaSupata, Karunika, and Kapalika orders. For these ninth-century  observers, Saivism was changing from a single and undifferentiated reli 

gious community to a group composed of several distinct orders or schools  of thought. From the ninth century, it became conventional to speak of four  Saiva schools, though the names varied: most commonly they are called  Saiva siddhanta, PaSupata1 Kalamukha, and Kapalika.22  

Within this new quaternity of Saivism, Saiva siddhanta attempted to por tray itself as the "pure" (Juddha) Saivism, the "fully completed" (siddhanta)  Saivism, or more simply as Saivism par excellence. If Saiva siddhanta is  "auspicious" (Saiva), Aey claimed, the other so-called Saiva orders are "in auspicious" (raudra). Not surprisingly, Saiva siddhanta claimed to offer a 

Locating the Tradition · 15    

more compelling and more efficacious formulation of the iivajnana, partic ularly as regards human liberation, than the competing schools of Saiv ism.23 Yet we know very little about the actual doctrinal or practical dis putes that brought about the division in Saivism, nor do we know the  

context in which the division initially took place.  

While the earliest moment of Saiva siddhanta self-definition necessarily  remains vague, the picture becomes clearer around 900 C.E. From this time  on there exist a large number of dated inscriptions referring to Saiva sid dhanta priests and ascetics, furnishing much fuller information about their  affiliations and spiritual lineages. Followers of Saiva siddhanta turn up in  Madhya Pradesh (especially the Dahala region), in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Ma 

harashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnad, and even in Southeast Asia.  These epigraphical references coincide with the appearance of Saiva monas tic institutions (mathas), to which many of these Saivas were attached, and  with a heightened program of Saiva temple construction throughout the sub continent. The inscriptional and archeological evidence suggests that from  the tenth through twelfth centuries a broadly extended network of interre lated Saiva siddhanta lineages spread itself out over much of India, acting  frequently as spiritual preceptors to kings, constructing and presiding over  

temples and monasteries, and propagating the teachings of the agamas.74  Aghorasiva, the twelfth-century South Indian author of many Saiva  siddhanta works, serves as an apt exemplar of this "stem with many widely  spreading branches."25 At the conclusion of his Kriyakramadyotika, he  specifies his lineage of twelve Saiva preceptors reaching back to the legen dary sage Durvasas (MV pp. 424-27). Among his predecessors, he lists  Uttungasiva, a Gujarati living at Kalyananagari (perhaps the capital of the  later Calukyas, in Karnataka), and Brahmasiva, also hailing from Gujarat;  PiIrnaSiva and Vidyantaiiva, who served as royal preceptors in Varanasi;  Sarvatmasiva, who was "received hospitably" by the ruler of Great Puri, in  the Northern Konkan near present-day Bombay; and Snkanthasiva, "a bull  among the Bengalis." AghoraSiva's own preceptor also came from Bengal,  apparently traveling south to Tamilnad. Several others in the succession  lived and taught in the Cola dominions of South India.  

During this period, the earliest independent Saiva siddhanta treatises of  explicitly human authorship were composed. From the tenth century on,  Saiva authors writing in Sanskrit produced an array of agama commentaries  (vrm's), ritual manuals (paddhatis), and philosophical treatises. Here I will  refer to this entire body of texts as the "paddhati literature." Paddhatis tread  in the "footprints" of other texts, and this corpus of Saiva writings, both  ritual and philosophical, follows in the path set forth by the Saiva agamas.  And since these texts, unlike the agamas, do not profess to be the direct  words of Siva, the paddhati authors are not reticent about leaving clues that  allow us to locate them historically. Thus, Aghorasiva tells us in a colophon  to his Kriyakramadyotika that he completed this work in 1157 C.E. (MV 

16 * Introduction    

p. 433), and in his commentary to the Tattvatraytmirpaya he extols himself  as the guru ornamenting the Cola country (77TW 32).  

The primary task of the paddhatis, as their authors saw it, was to clarify  the views of the Saiva siddhanta school and to refute the wrong views of  others, all in order to enhance the spiritual welfare of their audience. In light  of the diverse teachings of the agamas, it was important first of all to make  the Saiva teachings easily comprehensible. One of the earliest paddhati au thors, Sadyojyoti says in the opening verse of Tattvasarpgraha, "I will ex plain the tattvas concisely, so that even those of simple minds may under 

stand" (TS 1). The agamas themselves are sometimes too prolix to allow  easy comprehension, but the paddhati authors claim to put matters simply,  concisely, and clearly by virtue of their own comprehensive study and their  lucidity. ISanaSiva tells us that he wrote his paddhati only after extensive  examination of the agama texts (IP 1.1), while the eleventh-century Para mara king and author Bhojadeva praises his own clarity of mind: "The king  Bhojadeva composed this matchless Tattvaprakaia, containing the meaning  of the saivagamas. In that lord's consciousness, the entire set of tattvas  gleam as clearly as myrobalan fruits held in the palm of the hand" (TP 76).  This effort at systematization of agama teachings no doubt often had effects  on the agamas themselves, as texts like Kamikagama were revised to accord  more closely with developing Saiva siddhanta doctrine and practice.  

The paddhati authors were inspired to set forth their system clearly and  forcefully by other competing systems of thought. When Vidyakantha in structs his pupil Narayanakantha to compose a commentary on the Mfgetidra gama, he explains the need for such a work: "Treatises are written time and  again by adherents of other schools, while up to now the seal on this school  has not been broken" (MrAV vidya 1.1). AghoraSiva gives a similar reason  for commenting on Bhojadeva's Tattvaprakaia: "I undertake this commen 

tary because the text has elsewhere been commented upon by others who are  filled with the tainted ideas of nondualism (advaita) and who lack the true  knowledge of siddhanta" (TPV 1). These other systems, they claim, have  led people astray. Confused by the welter of competing viewpoints, some  people abandon the superior Saiva view and follow other, inferior ones.  

Some have been won over by the Vedas, others by the views of Kaula, and still  others by the Nyaya school. The willful elephant (matanga) has abandoned the  path set out by Saiva siddhanta and celebrated by the best gurus, and has been led  on a bad route. Therefore, put to the test by these other scholars, we have sought  to refute the wrong views by striking them with the goad of this commentary, and  to return the elephant onto the correct path. (MPAV vidya 1.1)  

Consequently there is a greater polemical dimension to the paddhati liter ature than to the agamas upon which it was based. Sadyojyoti, for instance,  directs his NareSvarapariksa chiefly against the Buddhists for their denial of 

LocatingtheTradition · 17    

the soul and against the MTmamsakas, primary medieval proponents of the  Vedic tradition, for their denial of the category of the Lord. Here, as in  many paddhati texts, there is also a strong argument against nondualist po sitions such as those held by Kashmiri Saivas and Advaita Vedantins. A  later text, Sivagrayogin's Satvaparibhafa takes it upon itself to summarize  and refute the positions on mok$a held by Carvaka, Madhyamika, Yogacara1  Samkhya, Nyaya, Mlmamsa, Jainas, thepurdnas, and several competing Saiva  schools including the Mahavratins, PaSupatas1 and Kapalikas (SPbh pp.  335-52). Paddhati authors wrote consciously in a world of competing view 

points, attempting to distinguish the Saiva siddhanta route prominently from  the many paths prescribed by others.  

Their intellectual efforts, then, were directed at reestablishing a lost unity  among the dgama texts and at guiding back to the right path a community  of Saivas who had wandered off. Yet through their efforts the paddhati au thors created something as much new as old. They identified a central tradi tion within the more disparate corpus of the dgamas, articulated this tradi tion into a unified system of thought and action, and established it as the  basis for a new community of priests, monks, and lay followers. So success ful were the paddhati authors in this endeavor that they ended up nearly  eclipsing the dgamas themselves as guides to Saiva knowledge and prac tice.26 It is to paddhatis such as Aghorasiva's Kriydkramadyotika, rather  than to the dgamas upon which they are based, that later Saiva practitioners  have most often turned for ritual guidance.  

AghoraSiva stands at the culmination of this intellectual project, spanning  two and a half centuries and encompassing many parts of India, that aimed  at formulating from the Saiva dgamas a coherent and systematic school of  thought and practice.27 Writing in South India in the mid-twelfth century,  Aghorasiva was one of the most prolific of all Saiva siddhanta authors, com 

posing commentaries on dgamas, an extensive ritual digest, several philo sophical commentaries, and even a few works of belles lettres, unfortu nately no longer available. He relied not only on the dgamas themselves but  on the works of many other paddhati authors as well. He cited UttungaSiva,  Bhojadeva, and SomaSambhu as among his teachers and influences; he  wrote commentaries on the works of Sadyojyoti, Bhojadeva, RamakaQtha,  and Narayanakantha; and in his writings he quoted from the works of many  other Saiva authors also. It is no exaggeration to say that his works offer the  fullest, most cohesive articulation of the agama-based Saiva siddhanta sys tem integrating philosophy and ritual.28  

Within a century of AghoraSiva's lifetime, two major events transformed  the Saiva siddhanta order. With the establishment of the Delhi sultanate in  1206 under Qutb al-dTn Aybak, the balance of North Indian military power  decisively shifted away from the independent Hindu dynasties that had sup 

ported temple Hindu orders like Saiva siddhanta, and came to rest with 

18 • Introduction    

iconoclastic Turko-Afghan Muslims. In this altered climate, Saiva sid dhanta seems to have quickly disappeared as an identifiable school in north ern India. Compared with other, more ascetically oriented Saiva orders such  as the Kapalikas and Kalamukhas, Saiva siddhanta was primarily an institu tional school centered on temples and monastic networks, and consequently  dependent on continuing royal patronage. As a result, it was particularly  vulnerable to this transformation of the North Indian political order. When  Saivism did resurface as a public religion there several centuries later, re generating itself under more tolerant Tslamic regimes or within renegade  Hindu clans, it was quite different in character from the medieval Saiva  siddhanta order. Meanwhile, the more aniconic school of VTrasaivas be came the dominant form of Saivism in the Deccan. So from the thirteenth  century on, Saiva siddhanta has been largely a regional Hindu order of  South India, and especially of Tamilnad, where it was largely unaffected by  early Islamic attacks.  

The second event was literary, not political. Around 1221, MeykaQtar com posed the Civaruinapdtam, the first and most important exposition of Saiva  siddhanta theology in Tamil.29 This was soon followed by the extensive  Tamil works of Arulnanti, Manavacakam Katantar, and Umapati, elaborating  and extending Meykantar's core teachings. Even though these authors very  largely and explicitly based their writings on the Sanskrit agamas and the  paddhatis, and even though Umapati (as well as others) continued to com 

pose works in Sanskrit as well as Tamil, the dominant language for Saiva  siddhanta theology (though not for ritual) shifted from Sanskrit to Tamil.  With this shift in linguistic preference also some changes in doctrinal em phasis. Most notable among these, from the perspective of this study, Tamil  Saiva siddhanta authors decreased the role of ritual in religious attainment,  considering knowledge and devotion as sufficient for liberation.30 At the  same time, they sought to relate the teachings of Saiva siddhanta to the  earlier Tamil poetry of the nayanmar poet-saints, a regional tradition of  considerable popular bearing.31 In some matters, such as epistemology and  refutation of other schools, the Tamil authors clearly surpassed previous  exponents of Saiva siddhanta. However, the shift has also tended to cut off  the ritual prescriptions of the agamas and paddhatis (which are still to some  extent authoritative in South Indian temples) from the theological moorings  that the early medieval authors gave them.32 In spite of this change, though,  the Tamil version of Saiva siddhanta is best seen as a philosophical continu ation and extension of the earlier Sanskrit-based school.  

These two events have also had a powerful bearing on the way scholars  have characterized Saiva siddhanta as a school of Hinduism. The impor tance of the Saiva siddhanta order in Tamilnad and its relative or complete  absence from other parts of South Asia have led most Indianists to view  Saiva siddhSnta as solely a Tamil school, based on the Tamil-language texts 

Locating the Tradition · 19    

of Meykanfar and the other three "lineage founders." This tendency goes back  at least as far as one of the pioneers of Tamil studies, G. U. Pope, who  wrote:  

The Saiva siddhanta is the most elaborate, influential and undoubtedly the most  valuable of all the religions of India. It is peculiarly the Southern Indian and  Tamil religion and must be studied by everyone who hopes to understand and  influence the great South Indian peoples.33  

Yet considerable inscriptional and textual evidence points to the Pan-Indian  character of Saiva siddhanta from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, as I  have indicated. The task of drawing these materials together into a con nected historical account of Saiva siddhanta as a coherent, widespread me dieval Hindu order, however, remains to be accomplished.  

ŚAIVA SIDDHANTA AS A SYSTEM  

In this study, I take the notion of a Saiva siddhanta "system" seriously. The  texts themselves clearly envision the agamas and paddhati literature as  comprising a unity of thought and action, and accordingly I have chosen to  portray Saiva siddhanta as a coherent system of knowledge and practice.34  

The work of developing and articulating Saiva siddhanta as a ritual and  theological system was, as I have indicated, a collective and historical en deavor, beginning in an early stage that is now largely unrecoverable (and  will remain so until it is possible to establish a chronological segmenta tion of the agama texts), evolving within the context of temple Hinduism  as it became the dominant South Asian cosmopolitical formation, and re ceiving systematic treatment from Saiva siddhanta authors who sought to  derive from diverse agama sources a coherent Saiva dualism in knowledge  and practice. This system was the special preserve of initiated Saivites,  for whom it represented a detailed depiction of the cosmos and a program  for action within it. It was expressed more openly in the very public do main of the temple, for the participation of the larger community of Siva  worshipers.  

In this reenactment of daily worship and explication of the Saiva theolog ical world, I will present the Saiva siddhanta order, synchronically, at what  appears to be the high point of Saiva ritualism. The Kamikagama and  Kriyakramadyotika depict Saiva siddhanta ritual as it was formulated (and,  we can only presume, practiced by the most conscientious) in Tamilnad dur ing the eleventh and twelfth centuries.35 These two texts draw upon the  work of several generations of Saiva siddhanta paddhati authors as well as  the unknown transmitters of the dgamas, and they clearly reflect the large scale Saiva temple cult of Cola-period Tamilnad.  

In addition to these two basic treatises, I have found it necessary to use 

20 • Introduction    

other Saiva texts as well to supplement and contextualize the instructions of  Kamikagama and Kriydkramadyotika. In doing so I have tried to follow  Kamikagama's own directive concerning the use of primary and secondary  texts in constructing a temple and performing worship in it.  

One should perform [the ritual construction and consecration of a temple], begin ning with plowing and ending with establishment, according to a root treatise  (miildgama) only; if performed according to a subsidiary treatise (upagama),  builder and sponsor will both be destroyed And temple rituals from plow ing through worship itself should all be carried out according to the prescriptions  of the text with which one began, not according to some other treatise. One may  conduct a ritual according to the prescriptions of another treatise, however, if it  is not discussed in the primary text. (KA 1.104—7)  

The ritual reenactment here too follows the prescriptions of my two "root  treatises" insofar as possible. But as predominantly ritual in subject matter,  these two leave many matters implicit, particularly the theological back ground of the ritual. Such knowledge would have been tacitly supplied, of  course, by the well-trained Saiva initiate as he enacted the ritual, but we do  not share this internalized knowledge.  

Throughout this study, I make greatest use of dgamas and paddhatis that  are most closely related in outlook to the two primary texts: philosophical  treatises that AghoraSiva commented upon, the Mrgendrdgama, Somasam bhupaddhati, commentaries by Kashmiri Saiva siddhanta authors, Nirma lamani's commentary on the Kriyakramadyotika, and so on. Certain texts in  other genres of Sanskrit literature, such as puratms and iilpasdstras, reflect  a Saiva siddhanta viewpoint, and I use several of these also.36 With few  exceptions, I refer only to texts that adhere to an identifiably Saiva sid dhanta perspective. (The most important exception to this is the monist Ap payadik§ita's Sivarcanacandrikd, which provides an unusally detailed guide  to certain aspects of Saiva piijd.) Not only does this method enable us to  avoid the "destruction" that Kdmikdgama predicts for those too promiscu ous in their use of heterogeneous texts, but it also results in a portrait of  early medieval Saiva ritual and philosophy that is clear and systematic, just  as the paddhati authors sought to make it.  

There is of course a choice involved here, which should be noted at the  outset. As a Saiva order of priests and ascetics that developed over several  centuries and in many regions of the subcontinent, Saiva siddhanta was not  a completely unified phenomenon. There were important doctrinal and pro 

cedural differences within the school.37 For clarity of exposition, I choose  to present one formulation of Saiva siddhanta, one "stream" of the differen tiated SivajMna. Based as it is on several of the most esteemed and influen tial texts of the school, this version of Saiva siddhanta was no doubt an  authoritative one, especially in Tamilnad, in early medieval Kashmir, and 

Locating the Tradition * 21    

probably in other regions as well. But I do not wish to suggest that all  dgamas and Saiva siddhanta texts completely cohere with it. When I speak  of what "Saivas say" or what "the dgamas tell us," it should be understood  in this more particularized sense, as representing the views of an important,  even central, group of early medieval Saiva siddhanta masters who sought  to articulate a compelling and coherent Saiva worldview and to advance it  as the highest form of knowledge, the parajMna. 

## 1 Ritual and Human Powers  

ŚAIVA RITUAL is grounded in and grows out of the world that is known  metaphysically through Saiva siddhanta philosophy. It is within this world  that the worshiper acts ritually. Accordingly, we must begin our reenact ment of puja by comprehending in a preliminary manner how that world is  fashioned: its fundamental constituents, the situation of human beings  within it, the most important goals of human endeavor, and how purposeful  action such as ritual may enable one to gain these goals. This preliminary  description delineates a Saiva "theory" of ritual, or, to put it more accu rately, a matrix of propositions that constitute the world within which  Saivas conceptualize and practice ritual.  

Let us start, then, where the Saiva siddhantins themselves start, with the  three basic components of the world, as revealed by the agamas.  

THE THREE CATEGORIES  

For Saiva siddhanta philosophy, the entire universe is composed of three  fundamental ontological categories (padartha): pati (the Lord), pasu (bound  souls), and pasa (fetters). Although these three categories interact with one  another in countless complex ways to constitute phenomenal existence  (samsara), they remain ultimately separate and distinct. Together, they in 

clude all that there is. "No other category at all," emphasizes Narayanakantha,  "exists outside of pati, paiu, and pasa" (MrAV vidya 2.2).  Pati denotes Siva, Lord of the Universe. The term pati in general usage  refers to a relationship of lordship or mastery, in which one being com mands the allegiance of others within some defined domain. As a house holder (grhapati) is supposed to hold sway within his home, and a king  (bhiipati, narapati) exercises dominion over a portion of the earth and its  inhabitants, so too Siva, Lord of All Creatures (pafupati), is the master of  the created universe and all beings within it. The material worlds we live in  are emitted and reabsorbed through his command. We are maintained in  bondage and eventually granted grace by his activities.  

Other entities as well are included in the category of pati: the multifarious  Sakti, a group of eight VidyeSvaras, Mantresvaras, and assorted other di vine lords. According to Saiva theology, Siva shares his sovereignty with  these other beings. (I describe Siva's segmentary overlordship more fully in hapter 4.) One crucial difference, however, distinguishes Siva from all  other lords, both human and divine. Lesser patis rule over domains that are  limited and always encompassed within other, larger spheres of lordship,  and they are therefore subject to the commands of greater sovereigns. Siva,  by contrast, is completely autonomous (svatantra); there is no other sphere  beyond that ruled by Siva. Siva commands other lords, but there is no other  lord capable of commanding him. Siva is the highest of all lords, the ulti 

mate locus of all lordship. All movement in the cosmos takes place finally  under his all-pervading direction.  

Pasu designates the multiplicity of individual souls in their various states  of bondage. In common usage, the term paiu denotes cattle or similar teth ered domestic animals; it also refers to the victim of an animal sacrifice.  Like these other fettered beings, human paSus are considered by Saiva phi losophy to be creatures that are constrained by powerful forces restricting  their freedom and that depend ultimately upon the good graces of their mas ter, the Lord Siva. As with the animal chosen to be a sacrificial victim, the  culmination of the human soul's journey is to reach a divine state, freed of  all earthly fetters, through ritual action. But unlike domesticated animals, as  we will see below, the human pasu even in the state of bondage retains some  capacity to alter his circumstances through his own efforts, and to help ef fect his own liberation.  

Human pasus are bound by a variety of paSas, or "fetters." Paia gener ally denotes a chain or rope used to catch something or to tie it up. A  hunter's snare and a birdcatcher's net are both included in the semantic field  covered by pasa, as is the noose carried by Yama, god of death. According  to Saiva siddhanta, the human paSu is bound by fetters of a less obvious but  much more tenacious sort. The body, the mind, and the world in which the  body lives—in fact, the entire multifarious cosmos—all ensnare and im prison the soul in profound bondage. The fetters shackling a human soul are  persistent, often lasting over many lifetimes. Fortunately, however, it is  possible to remove or destroy them through human effort and divine grace.  

Two fundamental dualities underlie these three ontological categories.  First, everything that exists is either cit (consciousness) or jada (inanimate  substance). Cit denotes "consciousness" in the broadest sense, the principle  of animation that distinguishes living, conscious, active entities from the  inanimate and inert. Always inherent in cit, the Mrgendrdgama tells us, are  the two powers of knowing and acting (jMnakriyasakti).1 A conscious en 

tity, then, is able to exercise agency through the innate capacities of its  consciousness.  

Jada, on the other hand, signifies real, material substance. In common  usage, jada is an adjective connoting torpor, dullness, inertia, apathy, cold ness, stupidity. Saiva philosophy uses this term to characterize the entire24 - Chapter One    

physical world. In fact, the agamas include within the sphere of jada many  human faculties that we (with our very different, Cartesian-based ontology)  would generally characterize as immaterial and mental or psychological: the  ego (ahamkara), the synthesizing mind (memos), the intellect (buddhi), and  so on. In contrast to cit, jada is inert. Substances may be altered or trans formed by external forces, but they have no autonomous powers or initia 

tive. They require consciousness to act upon or through them.  According to Saiva philosophy, Siva is composed solely and eternally of  cit. The fetters, conversely, are entirely made up of inanimate substance.  The ontological composition of these two categories is constant. However,  the third category—the bound soul—is not so fixed. One constituent of the  paiu is the individual soul (atman), which like Siva consists in conscious ness. But unlike Siva, a human soul is not altogether free from fetters and  substance. The soul inhabits a body composed of substantive jada and lives  in a world that is substantive. Thus, the bound soul partakes of both cit and  jada, in an unstable and finally alterable mixture. This ambiguity and muta bility inherent in the human situation are at the center of all Saiva philoso phy and ritual action.  

The second basic dichotomy is between souls and Siva. Both the soul and  Siva are characterized as cit; that is, both are conscious entities. Siva exists  always in a single state; he is "liberated without beginning" (anadimukta).  The soul, in contrast, exists in one of two basic conditions. The normal  condition of the soul is bondage (bandhatva), the state of a pasu, in which  the soul is attached to fetters. In this condition, the fetters alienate the soul  from Siva. The other condition of the soul is liberation (muktatman), in  which all fetters are removed from the soul once and for all. In liberation,  the soul becomes equal to Siva in almost all respects. Yet even then, accord ing to Saiva siddhanta, the soul never merges or becomes united with Siva,  as nondualist Saiva schools would contend. The liberated soul is a separate,  autonomous Siva-like entity, but not one with Siva. So the separation of  souls and Siva is not, for this school, based solely on the contingent pres ence in the soul of ignorance, fetters, or other alienating forces that may  someday be overcome. Rather, it is a permanent and ontological distinction.  

FETTERS, POWERS, AND HUMAN EFFORT  

With this doubly dualistic metaphysical framework in mind, we can begin  to see how the Saivas understand the human condition and the possibilities  of human attainment.  

At the center of one's being lies the soul (atman). The soul, for Saiva sid dhanta, is the irreducible essence of the person; other constituents are con tingent and expendable. The soul animates and instigates all other ingre-

Ritual and Human Powers * 25    

dients making up the person; without the soul, these ingredients would  remain an inert, torpid mass of substance. Sadyojyoti compares the relation  of soul to other constituents with that of a king to his army.  

As a king commands his troops toward victory, so the soul (ami) commands the  intellect and other faculties toward their proper purposes of cognition and the  like. And so, while victory lies with the army, agency belongs to the king; here  also, while cognition and the like are located in the intellect and other faculties,  their agency belongs to the soul. (BhK SO-S1)  

The soul is eternal, while other parts of the person have a beginning and  an end. When its current body passes away, the soul transmigrates to an other one. Even when the entire world is reabsorbed during the cosmic dis solution, the soul remains, patiently awaiting the next creation. And when  final liberation is attained, it is the soul that attains it.  

The soul possesses consciousness. To put it more precisely, the innate  form (svariipa) of the soul is consciousness. Consciousness, we have seen,  entails the twin powers of knowing and acting, and so these powers too  inhere in the soul. As humans, we are empirically aware that we possess the  capacities to know things and to initiate action, of course, but that empirical  recognition gives us only a partial view of the true situation. In fact, say the  Saivas, the soul's powers of knowing and acting are potentially infinite,  amounting to omniscience and omnipotence, just like those of Siva.  

Unfortunately, in the ordinary human condition, our unlimited powers are  not available to us because they are constrained by fetters. As a tether im pedes a cow's power of movement, the fetters subdue the soul's own inher ent powers. The fetters are said to "cover over" (avarana) the soul's quali ties; they "suppress" (mdhana) its powers of knowledge and activity.  Bhojadeva compares one particular fetter, mala ("primordial stain"), to the  tarnish that blackens a copper pot (TP 18); AghoraSiva uses the analogy of  a cataract covering the eye to indicate the "blindness" caused by mala (TPV  9). In addition to mala, Saiva texts speak of two other types of fetters that  bind the soul: karman, the residue of past actions, and mdya, the constitu ents of the material cosmos. Together, these three impediments overpower  the soul's innate capacities, reducing it to its "normal" state of bondage.  

The intrinsic powers of the soul and the extrinsic fetters attached to it  therefore stand in opposition to one another. Each person is an arena of  struggle. The powers of knowing and acting tend toward their own fuller  expression, while the obdurate forces of the fetters aim to subdue them. It  is a contest not between good and evil, nor precisely between life and death,  but rather between empowerment and suppression, animation and torpor.  

The conflict of these forces in every living person accounts for the varia tions we observe in the capacities of different humans to know and to act. 

26 · Chapter One    

Some persons are evidently wise, while others are clearly foolish. Some are  powerful and others weak. The Saivas envision a vast hierarchy of beings,  divine as well as human, arranged on the basis of the relative distribution of  powers and fetters. At the highest level of this hierarchy stand Siva and  those souls who have attained liberation (muktatman)—beings whose pow ers of knowledge and action are entirely unimpeded by any fetters. Below  them is a group of divine beings classified as Vijnanakevala, which includes  the eight VidyeSvaras and the seventy million mantras. The Vijnanakevalas  have removed certain categories of fetters (karman and mdya) but continue  to be affected by one fetter, mala. Because of their relative freedom from  fetters, they enjoy vast—though not yet infinite—powers, and they use  these powers to carry out Siva's commands. Next comes another group of  divinities, the Pralayakevala, who are free from maya but not from karman  or mala. They too use their lesser but still immense powers to act as Siva's  lieutenants throughout the cosmos. Finally, at the bottom of this hierarchy,  are beings such as ourselves (termed sakalas), whose innate powers are  largely suppressed by all three types of fetters.

Among humans as well there are differences. As in any battle, the bal ance of the opposing forces may shift. While all humans are in thrall to all  three fetters, the degree of their hold over us can change. In some persons,  due to bewilderment and imprudent conduct, fetters gain the upper hand. As  a result, such a person becomes increasingly unable to understand the true  state of things, and his behavior becomes more and more controlled by fluc 

tuating desires and insatiable craving. Sivagrayogin classifies him as a  prdkrta, commenting that his thought, "like dream-knowledge," is a confus ing mixture of knowledge and ignorance, and that he is proud of his "self,"  which he mistakenly identifies with his body, senses, and other imperma nent derivatives of the material world (SPbh pp. 152-53). Fetters stifle the  

innate powers of his soul, and he spirals ever deeper into bondage.  In other persons, fetters "ripen" (paka) or are "consumed" (bhoga)  through a combination of well-directed human action and divine grace. As  a result, the grip of the fetters on such a person's soul loosens, and his in nate powers are able increasingly to emerge. The emergence of powers, in  turn, serves as the basis for further effort aimed at removing fetters, which  reciprocally allows the person still greater access to his own formerly sup-

Ritual and Human Powers · 27    

pressed powers. According to Sivagrayogin's classification, this is the path  followed by the vainayika, the one who is "purified in mind, speech, and  body" by following the Saiva teachings, and who becomes truly knowledge 

able both in worldly matters and in the Saiva system {$Pbh pp. 152-53).  The end point of his increasing empowerment, when the fetters are com pletely removed and the soul's capacities are fully manifest, is liberation  (moksa). This is the "victory" toward which the soul ought to direct all its  efforts. At this point, the soul recovers its inherent omniscience and om nipotence and becomes fully equal in its powers to Siva.2  Clearly, from the Saiva perspective it is desirable to tilt the scales in favor  of the soul's innate powers. But how is this to be done? In contrast to some  nontheistic Hindu schools, Saivas insist that it cannot be done entirely  through human agency. Nor does it happen of its own accord. As Aghora Siva puts it,  

Souls are not able to attain worldly pleasures or liberation themselves, since their  own powers are not free due to bondage, just as a bound animal (paiu) like a ram  cannot free itself. And fetters will neither act nor cease acting by themselves just  for the sake of the soul, because they are inanimate (jada), just as a rope or the like  will not untie itself. (TST 50-51)  

If neither pasu nor pasa can decisively shift the balance, the task must be  left to pati. Ultimately, it is only through Siva's grace (anugmha) that souls  may escape fetters and realize their full powers. In the Sivapumna, Vayu  uses the analogy of refining metal: 'This soul, which must be purified, is  purified only through contact with Siva. When a metal rod is placed in fire,  it is the fire alone, not the metal, that brings about the burning" (SPur  Vayaviya 1.31.46). AghoraSiva concludes, "So therefore, Siva himself is  the one who brings about worldly pleasures and liberation for souls" (TST  50-51).  

Nevertheless, the Saivas also grant an important role in this battle to  human effort. Strict adherence to a doctrine of divine grace could easily lead  to an attitude of quietism, while Saiva siddhanta texts always prescribe a  rigorously active program of study, proper conduct, yogic discipline, and  ritual action. One must, in Vayu's metaphor, manage to place oneself in  Siva's purifying fire, and that requires initiative. For instance, at the com 

pletion of his initiatory ceremony, the initiate is informed by his guru of his  new responsibilities as a member of the Saiva community. IsanaSiva ar ranges these under eight rubrics. Some of these responsibilities are simple  interdictions:  

This is the first rule: one should not revile Siva, the preceptor, or Siva's devotees.  Nor should one tread on the shadow of a temple, a preceptor, a liAga, or even a  cow marked with the Saiva insignia The third rule is this: one should not 

28 * Chapter One    

allow those who have not been initiated to copy or to hear the practices, the  common rules of conduct, or the texts of the Saiva school. (/P kriya 18; vol. 3,  pp. 185-86)  

Others involve regular ritual observances:  

The fourth rule is: one should eat only after first worshiping Siva and the precep tor twice, thrice, or at least once One should practice all the restraints and  duties prescribed by yoga. On the fourteenth and eighth days of the fortnight, the  conjunctions of planets, and other auspicious days, one should worship at a pure  shrine or the like following the rules for special occasions. One should make a  vow, and eat only once a day, either at night or during the day.  

In other texts, the obligation to develop one's knowledge through teaching  and study is also emphasized.  

Members of the Saiva community should get up at dawn. When they have com pleted their daily rites, they should bow to their preceptor and carry out the duties  that the guru orders. Those who live with the guru and depend on him should go  over their lessons and listen to the Saiva texts that he teaches, abandoning all  feelings of pride, jealousy, hypocrisy, and passion. (MrA carya 66-67)  

Clearly the Saiva texts do not disregard the usefulness of activity in attain ing human ends.  

The efficacy of human action derives ultimately from the opposition of  innate capacities and suppressing fetters. Precisely by exercising the powers  of consciousness in a clearly directed and appropriate manner, a person is  able to contribute to the removal of his bondage and thereby to his own  empowerment. For instance, by studying his lessons and listening to the  agamas taught by his guru, a Saiva neophyte helps eradicate many of the  erroneous notions he may have held concerning the true nature of things.  Increasing knowledge may persuade the aspirant to be more diligent in his  practice of ritual, which for Saivas is the most efficacious mode of action,  and will enable him to perform it with a deeper understanding of its meta 

physical foundations. Ritual, in turn, helps destroy fetters resulting from  prior action, thereby increasing his capacities both to know and to act,  which reciprocally informs his study of the sivajnana, and so on. (I will  trace out the path of increasing empowerment and final liberation in greater  detail in Chapter 3.)  

Human effort, then, is important and can accomplish real and significant  changes in a person's situation. One should not derive from this, however,  the arrogant conclusion that human effort alone suffices for the highest lev els of attainment. According to Saiva siddhanta, Siva's grace is the basis for  all truly efficacious human actions. But this grace acts through many chan nels. The agamas contain Siva's own teachings, emitted by him at the be-

Ritual and Human Powers * 29    

ginning of creation as an act of grace toward bound souls. Saiva rituals all  involve the employment of diva's own mantra powers, and in the most im portant liberating ritual in the Saiva system, Siva himself intervenes through  the intermediary of the initiating guru to destroy the initiate's fetters and to  help recover his long-suppressed innate powers, an act of supreme grace.  

KNOWING  

Just as human beings can be ranked according to their capacities to know,  so too various kinds of knowledge differ hierarchically. Bodies of knowl edge may be more or less comprehensive in scope and offer greater or lesser  illumination. Of the many systems of knowledge in the world, some, such  as the sciences of medicine and astrology, are adapted to useful but limited  worldly affairs, while others, such as Buddhism or Paiicaratra Vai§navism,  are aimed at comprehending the fundamental organization of the world and  enabling one to act in accord with this. Of all bodies of knowledge, how 

ever, the Saivas claim that the system emitted by Siva and collected in the  agamas is the highest, most complete form. The texts refer to it as para jnana, the "superior knowledge."  

Saivas give three main reasons why SivajMna is superior: its authorship,  its appropriate audience, and its illuminating power. First of all, the knowl edge contained in the agamas comes originally from the mouth of Siva, who  knows all. The agama texts as they exist today take pride in tracing their  own lineages back to an initial emission from Siva. By an act of grace, Siva  transmits the various agamas to appropriate divinities, who in turn allow the  most eminent human sages to hear the teachings, and these sages then pass  the agamas on to other human auditors. Saivas call this the tantrdvatara,  the "descent" of the agama texts from Siva to the Saiva community. More 

over, according to Kamikagama, it is Siva's highest, upraised face that  emits the agamas, while his other four, hierarchically inferior faces are re sponsible for other forms of knowledge like the Vedas (KA 1.17-27). Sys tems of knowledge like Buddhism that are created by human beings, who  are necessarily limited in their knowledge, can hardly compare with those  produced by Siva. Therefore the superiority of the Saiva system of knowl edge over all other systems results originally from the omniscience of its  source, Siva.3  

Siva intends the Saiva system for the most highly qualified persons, those  most capable of exercising the power of knowing. Otiier systems are proper  for those at lower levels of aptitude. As Mrgendragama says, "Siva ...  revealed this [iivajnana contained in the Mrgendragama] to those fit to re ceive it, for their attainment; to others [not fit to receive the Sivajfidna], he  revealed a teaching adapted [to their capacities]" (MrA vidya 1.26). Com menting on this passage, Narayanakantha explains that the ones fit to receive 

30 · Chapter One    

the highest knowledge are "those who wish to achieve the highest state, on  account of the ripened state of their impurity." On the other hand, "to those  who, because of the unripened state of their impurity, follow the systems of  bound souls," Siva has revealed teachings "congenial" to their inferior capa bilities and lesser aspirations (MfAV vidya 1.26). What one is capable of  knowing is a matter of one's degree of bondage. Inferior systems of knowl edge are suitable for those who are dominated by fetters and may offer them  some limited spiritual assistance. When a person's fetters become ripened  and his power of knowing begins to emerge more fully, however, the  SivajMna becomes the only appropriate system. Only that knowledge can  lead him to the highest levels of attainment.  

Because it is meant for an audience of those who are most accomplished  and aspire to the highest states, the content of the Saiva system is more  comprehensive and illuminating and covers a greater range of topics than  any other system.  

This knowledge is authoritative because, while it elucidates matters accessible to  other systems, it also enables the comprehension of matters to which these sys tems do not give access. As it is said, "[A science] which enables the comprehen sion of unknown things [as well] is authoritative."4  

While inferior systems like the Vedas elucidate the categories of soul and  fetters, according to the Kamikagama, the Saiva system alone adequately  clarifies the category of pati, the Lord Siva. The greater comprehensiveness  of the Saiva system results, as one would expect, from the greater compre 

hension of its author. "Because the authors [of other systems of knowledge]  were not omniscient, they do not describe clearly the totality of things....  But in the Saiva system all this is present in its most complete form" (MrA  vidya. 2.10-11). Since among authors only Siva knows everything, only the  knowledge spoken by him can claim to be truly complete.  

A system of knowledge is not simply a passive body of contents. In the  Saiva view, correct knowledge does something: it destroys ignorance  (ajMna, avidya) by illuminating the true nature of things. Siva himself re flects on this elucidating capacity of knowledge when he is about to emit the  agamas: "When the light consisting of the sound [of these texts] shines, no  longer will the worlds be covered in thick darkness and ignorance" (AA  1.33-35). Wthout SivajMna, the world is obscured by the darkness of ig 

norance. Siva's teachings in the agamas, however, dispel ignorance as sun light does the darkness of night, enabling one to see things as they are. The  Kamikagama uses a related image to describe the difference between the  Saiva system of knowledge and other systems: "One should consider the  distinction between superior and inferior systems of knowledge like the dif ference at night between the eyes of a cat and those of a man" (KA 1.16-17). 

RitualandHumanPowers · 31    

One who knows the SivajMna has the feline ability to see the true nature of  things even in a darkened world.  

Higher forms of knowledge disclose a previously hidden order of things.  Metaphors equating ignorance with darkness and emphasizing the ability of  knowledge to dispel or penetrate this obscurity remind us once again of the  limited human power of knowing without SivajMna. Fetters suppress our  capacity to recognize the truth, and we tend to mistake the impermanent for  the permanent, the impure for the pure, and sorrow for pleasure (TPV 39).  The Saiva system of knowledge communicated to us through the agamas  dispels such ignorance by revealing what is truly permanent and what is not.  It uncovers an underlying order to the world, more real, more permanent,  and—when translated into action—more effective in attaining the highest  goals.  

ACTING  

Purposeful action, like knowledge, is a basic capacity of the human soul,  and like knowledge, action takes many different forms in the world, some  superior to others. Some actions rely on limited worldly knowledge, use  instruments of limited efficacy, and aim at accomplishing limited, everyday  results. In contrast, other actions may be based on more comprehensive  knowledge of the world, make use of more powerful means, and aim at  attaining more far-reaching results. For instance, an Ayurvedic physician  attempting to recover the bodily health of his patient uses a system of  largely empirical knowledge concerning the human organism; he treats the  patient with dietary and medicinal concoctions that have a therapeutic effect  on the patient's body. For some maladies such action is entirely adequate,  while for others a more penetrating intervention may be necessary. A pa tient suffering from the bite of a poisonous snake, for example, requires  stronger treatment than Ayurveda can offer. She must quickly seek out a  healer adept in the use of the GARUPA mantra, who can employ this more  powerful method to cure snakebite and thereby effect a result not obtainable  through conventional medical treatments.5 (Here and throughout this study,  I adopt the convention of designating mantras by capital letters, serving to  set them apart from normal discourse, as they deserve.)6  

To treat the condition of the human soul in its profound bondage, action  of a much greater efficacy still is required. In this case, only Saiva ritual  action is able to make a significant impact.  

Ritual, in the Saiva view, is not different in kind from other forms of  practical activity. It is not, for instance, distinguished as "expressive" or  "symbolic" activity in contrast to "pragmatic," nor as "sacred" action in  contrast to "profane." The two terms most often used to denote "ritual ac-

32 · Chapter One    

tion" in the agamas, kriya and karman, both derive from the common San skrit root kr (to do, to make), and both signify "action" in the very broadest  sense. Like all intentional activity, ritual action is an expression of the  soul's power of consciousness, which directs instruments and forces toward  accomplishing some aim. However, Saivas do posit a hierarchical distinc tion between Saiva ritual and other modes of action. Among all forms of  human action, they say, Saiva ritual is preeminent in the scope of knowl edge upon which it is based, in the efficacy of the instruments it employs,  

and in the levels of attainment to which it allows access.  The superiority of Saiva ritual as a mode of action derives, not surpris ingly, from Siva. Ssdva ritual is a part of the HvajMna revealed by the Lord  who is both omniscient and omnipotent. Narayanakantha puts it this way:  

The superiority of the knowledge presented here [i.e., in the jiianapada] derives  from its author; it is taught by ParamaSiva who himself knows and accomplishes  all objects, who transcends bound souls and fetters, and who is himself unsur passed. So too all the practical methods such as initiation taught here are also  superior, because they concur with what is known. (MrAV vidya 2.11)  

Just as Siva's authorship insures the superiority of Saiva knowledge over  other systems of knowledge, so that same origin determines that Saiva ritual  will be superior to any other form of practical action.  

Further, as Narayanakantha's comment makes clear, Saiva ritual action  "concurs" with the highest philosophical knowledge. There exists an origi native "conformity" (anuga) between the sections in the agamas discussing  knowledge and those discussing action. Since the Sivajfiana discloses the  most fundamental order of things, actions that accord with this order are  bound to be more successful in accomplishing their ends. Superior, compre hensive knowledge leads to superior, efficacious action.  

All action, say the Saivas, necessarily involves the use of "instruments"  (karana). Animating consciousness (cit) cannot act in and through itself; it  must employ palpable objects or forces to cany out its intentions. Siva, for  instance, engages a host of self-arising energies or powers (saktis), mantras,  and subordinate deities acting as agents (adhikaritis) to fulfill his com 

mands. Souls embodied in human forms likewise depend on instruments to  perform their much more restricted actions. Conventionally, Saiva texts  speak of the primary human instrumentalities as those of "mind, speech,  and body." As humans, we carry out all our ordinary human actions using  one or more of these fundamental apparatuses.  

In ritual, one employs the same three instruments, but in a more focused  and powerful manner. Suryabhatia specifies that a worshiper should per form the acts of worship "with faith, and accompanied by activities of mind,  speech, and body, such as especially meditation, mantra repetitions, and  mudras" (§SPbh p. 37). Meditation (dhyana) is a particularly potent mental 

Ritual and Human Powers - 33    

activity, learned through the practice of yoga, by which the mind undistract edly centers itself on a visualized divine form or some nonvisual reality,  making that entity present to a high degree.7 Similarly, mudras are ritually  prescribed hand gestures, bodily activities with more far-reaching results  than normal movements or gestures of the body. The Kararfagama makes  clear the efficacy of such ritual gestures with an etymological definition: "It  gives delight (muda) to the gods and drives away (dravayati) the demons.  Because of its power to delight and to drive away, it is called a Saiva mu 

dra."s Normal bodily gestures and hand movements may affect material ob jects close at hand; only mudras have the power to influence gods and de mons beyond one's ordinary reach.9  

Of all instruments available to humans, however, the mantra is most sig nificant. Mantras more than anything else distinguish Saiva ritual from  everyday action.  

From the first plowing [to establish a temple], all rites are accomplished with  mantras. In consequence, since mantras are intended for ritual, [an action] is not  ritual without mantras. One establishes the deity with mantras, and one worships  him with mantras. One bathes him with mantras, and one offers him oblations  with mantras. Expiatory rites are done by mantras, and initiation through mantras  also. With mantras one acquires supernormal powers, and with mantras one at tains the place of Siva.10  

To begin with, mantras are speech acts; one speaks a mantra, just as one  speaks ordinary sentences. But mantras are not simply human utterances or  formulas. They are also, more fundamentally, powerful divine beings or  forces that exist independently of any human usage. The speech act is the  signifier (vacaka), the divine being is the signified (vacya); the mantra may  be thought of as the sign in which the two are intimately—and not arbi trarily—united.  

A mantra is recognized as having a dual form, resulting from a division of signi fied and signifier. The signifier has the form of speech, while the signified is the  referent (artha). However, it is also acknowledged that the signified and signifier  are essentially identical (tadatmya). (KA 2.3-4)  

The agamas speak of seventy million mantras that are emitted by Siva at  the beginning of creation and that Siva then commands to carry out his  lordly functions in various parts of the world. Thus, mantras are first and  foremost the instruments of Siva himself. By properly articulating the  "sonant form" of a mantra (as signifier), the Saiva ritualist is also able to  summon and to channel those same powers (as signified) into the sphere of  ritual, to accomplish his own ends. In Saiva ritual, one gains access to  Siva's own instrumentality by using Siva's mantras.11  

Since the knowledge on which it is based is more comprehensive, and the34 · Chapter One    

instruments it employs more powerful, Saiva ritual is bound to lead to supe rior results. But the rituals of other systems are useful, the Saivas concede,  at least for accomplishing lesser goals. "Those who are purified through  Vedic rituals like Agnihotra and Candrayana attain joy in the three worlds.  Those who offer a hundred sacrifices gain the abode of Indra." Joy and  heavenly abodes are, of course, legitimate and worthy aims for aspiration.  Yet such attainments pale before those of the Saiva devotee. "However, the  place attained by those devoted to Siva, even when [Saiva rituals] are im properly performed, cannot be achieved [by non-Saivas] even with a thou sand sacrifices" (MPA vidya 26.11). Vedic rituals, say the Saivas, at best  result in worldly enjoyments (bhoga); Saiva rituals yield such enjoyments  too but lead ultimately to liberation (moksa). And liberation, in the Saiva  

scale of values, is the highest possible human attainment.  Even the rituals of other systems that claim to lead to liberation in fact  take the aspirant only to an inferior level of mokfa. Narayaniakantha for one  speaks of these as "phantom" liberations: "The liberation in the Saiva sys tem is superior because it is beyond the purview of all other systems ...  since the liberation which other systems teach is only a phantom of libera tion" (MrAV vidya 2.11). He goes on to quote another text, which asserts that  those supposedly "liberated" according to methods other than the Saiva are  in fact released only from the three "attributes" (gunas), not from the three  fetters. Other Saiva authors of a more conciliatory bent distinguish between  incomplete, lower (apara) liberation and complete, higher (para) libera tion. "There are seven grades of moksa," asserts Vedajfiana, and of them  only one is subtle, transcendent, fully achieved, and completely autono mous; the other six leave one still heteronomous, subordinate to another  lord (SPM 7.34-35).12 Only Saiva ritual offers the highest form of release,  the paramoksa.  

KNOWING AND ACTING  

The Saivas, then, pugnaciously assert the superiority of their system over all  others. The revealed knowledge in the agamas is more comprehensive than  any other form of knowledge; the ritual action prescribed by the agamas is  more efficacious than any other mode of practical activity. But one might  still ask which of these is more important, knowledge or ritual action?  

One can find supporters of both positions within Saiva siddhanta. Some  texts clearly grant a greater role in the attainment of liberation to knowl edge. "Devotees gain liberation solely through knowledge," argues the  Ajitagama (18.3-4). "As for a ritual like worship, it gives only worldly re sults such as divine status (indrapada)." Others by contrast stress the neces sity of ritual action. AghoraSiva uses the analogy of a cataract covering the  eye to support this position. Because the cataract is a physical affliction, 

Ritual and Human Powers * 35    

recognition alone is not sufficient to remove it; physical action in the form  of medical treatment is required. So too the fetters that cover the soul are  substantive, and one must remove them through ritual activity, not through  knowledge alone (TPV15).  

The most common stance taken by Saiva siddhanta texts acknowledges  the necessity of both knowledge and action for attaining the highest goals.  Sivagrayogin (who himself emphasizes knowledge) quotes an unnamed text  to this effect:  

Knowledge devoid of activity is not the preeminent means of attainment (pra dhana), nor is activity devoid of understanding the preeminent means. There fore, successful attainment of liberation arises only through both of them to gether, just as a bird does not fly without two wings. ($Pbh pp. 311-14)  

Or, to use another analogy: "Like rice mixed with honey, or like honey  mixed with rice, ritual austerities and knowledge combined make an excel lent medicine" (,SPbh pp. 311-14). Whether it is a matter of rising like a  bird to a higher level of attainment or of medically treating the malady of  bondage, the Saiva aspirant needs to make full use of both his conscious  powers of knowing and acting. These are not two separate pathways leading  to the same end, but two interrelated and complementary constituents of a  single path.  

Even those texts that emphasize knowledge concede that ritual action is  also crucial, because it gives rise to knowledge. As the Ajitagama contin ues, "When Siva the Lord of All Gods is worshiped, he grants knowledge  and devotion" (AA 18.4). Without ritual practice, the requisite knowledge  might never arise. Conversely, those who focus on action recognize that  correct knowledge is required for the proper comprehension and practice of  ritual. While Narayanakanthaholds that the ritual of initiation (dik$a) is the sin gular key to liberation, he adds this proviso:  

It is not possible to perform initiation without knowledge, because knowledge  provides the means of determining the inherent form of bound souls, fetters, and  the Lord, indicates how to accomplish all paths of attainment, and reveals the  greatness of the Mantras, the Mantresvaras, and others. (MrAV yoga 1)  

Without correct knowledge, one's ritual practice will be shaky and finally  fruitless.  

The mutual implication and necessity of both knowledge and ritual action  as modes of religious praxis have for the Saivas an ontological basis, as we  have seen. The two powers of knowing and acting are ultimately unitary,  the integral power of consciousness directing itself toward what is to be  known (jneya) and what needs to be done (karya). So in the contest between  the soul's innate powers and the fetters, a Saiva aspirant must exercise both  powers if he is to alter his own condition of bondage to a significant degree. 

36 ' Chapter One    

THE ŚAIVA RITUAL SYSTEM  

Considering the importance Saivas grant to ritual action, it is not surprising  that the scope of the Saiva ritual system described in the agamas. is ex tremely broad. The agamas give detailed directions for rituals large and  small, public and private, optional and obligatory; for rituals one may per form directly and those that require the mediation of a Saiva priest; for ritu als performed with external actions and substances and those performed in ternally through meditation and visualization; and for rituals that confer  worldly benefits and those that lead to liberation.  

For instance, the published KSmiMgama discusses only Jfcriya—the other  three padas of this agama are fragmentary or lost—and requires some  twelve thousand verses to do so.13 In the course of this text, one finds exten sive instructions for the construction and ritual establishment of Saiva tem ples and other religious structures, beginning with the selection and prelim inary plowing of the site, up through the culminating consecration, which  transforms the man-made edifice into a divine habitation. The text also  specifies rituals for establishing (pratisfha) the central linga of a temple and  various divine icons, in order to render them suitable supports for the pres ence of Siva and other divinities. A temple once activated maintains a  schedule of celebrations on auspicious occasions ranging from special fort nightly bathings (snapana) of the linga to major annual calendrical festivals  (mahotsava) like DTpavali and Sivaratri; Kamikagama gives directions for a  complete round of such occasional rituals. Further, it describes a set of six teen major gift-giving ceremonies (mahadanas) such as the hiranyagarbha  (the "golden womb" ceremony) that a Saiva ruler or wealthy patron may  optionally choose to have performed.  

In addition to this temple-oriented ritual program, the Kamikagama also  specifies a sequence of what one might call "spiritual life-cycle" rituals ori ented toward the individual Saivite: first a series of three initiations (diksa)  that incorporate persons into the Saiva community and alter their spiritual  status, then several consecrations (abhiseka) that empower initiated Saivites  to act in special capacities such as priest or mantra-adept, and finally crema tion (antyesti) formulated as a final liberating ritual. There are discussions of  ritual austerities for expiating (prdyaicitta) previous acts of wrongdoing or  ritual omissions, and of ritual pacifications (έάηίΐ) employed to placate  threatening forces. The text also gives instructions for a sequence of daily  observances that every initiated Saivite concerned with his spiritual welfare  ought to perform regularly: morning ablutions (snana), worship of the sun,  daily worship of Siva, a fire oblation (homa), worship of Canda and others.  

Of all rituals in the Saiva system, the most recurrent and pervasive is  the daily worship (nityapuja) of Siva. Agamas speak glowingly of its far reaching effects. The Kamikagama tells us, simply, that daily worship 

Ritual and Human Powers * 37    

"yields the fruits of both worldly pleasure and liberation" (KA 4.1). More  extravagantly, the Suprabheddgama cites many results the worshiper may  accomplish through his worship:  

Now I will describe the order of rules for Saiva worship, which destroys every  sin, produces happiness in all the worlds, grants the benefits of all gifts and all  sacrifices, removes stains resulting from the murder of a brahman and all other  crimes, grants the benefits of the horse sacrifice, gives victory, creates prosper ity, expands one's territory, and destroys one's enemies. There has never been  merit equal to that of worshiping Siva, and never will be.14  

The texts advise all eligible members of the Saiva community to perform  nityapiija every day, without exception. The Kamikagama stresses this im perative with hyperbole:  

The one born in self-deception who fails to worship the Lord Siva will long sink  in an ocean of unhappiness in this world. It is better to stop breathing or even cut  off your head than to eat without worshiping the Three-eyed Lord. Recognizing  this, one should worship SadaSiva with perseverance. (KA 4.12-14)  

A diligent Saivite should offer such worship privately and on his own behalf  (atmartha), in a home shrine or some other auspicious place, one or more  times a day. In addition, daily worship is also performed in every Saiva  temple, by a duly consecrated Saiva priest, publicly and on behalf of others  (parartha).15 The benefits of public puja are not confined to the priest but  extend throughout the community.  

Worshiping in a village, town, or city, beside a river or on a mountain, at the  sixty-eight great holy sites or some other beautiful divine abode of Siva where  there is a linga—whether it be self-arising, divine, a linga-shaped stone, or one put  up by a sage, or at a linga established by humans—is regarded as worship on  behalf of others. Worship on behalf of others should be performed to increase the  longevity, health, victory, and prosperity of the ruler, and to make the villagers  and others thrive. (KA 4.3-6)  

Depending on their size and resources, temples may offer worship once,  twice, thrice, or up to eight times daily; quantities of food and other sub stances offered may range from rather meager amounts to large-scale feasts  requiring many bushels of rice. These daily offerings, however large or  small, form the liturgical backbone of all Saiva temples.  

In addition to its regular performance as an independent ritual, daily wor ship also figures frequently as an element in other, larger Saiva rituals. For  instance, a priest offers nityapiija intact at the commencement of the annual  offering of the expiatory pavitra. In initiation, the initiating guru makes  three offerings of daily worship at the outset. Moreover, important rites  from daily worship are employed as building blocks to construct more com-

38 · Chapter One    

plex rituals. The invocation used to summon Siva in daily worship, for in stance, is found repeatedly embedded within other rituals. When a text di rects the ritualist to "perform invocation," it generally means that he should  carry out invocation according to the method employed in daily worship.  Because of this paradigmatic quality, many agamas and paddhatis begin  their discussion of kriya with daily worship. Thus, one may view daily wor ship as a unity of constituent syntactic parts that, both as a whole and as  parts, are repeatedly embedded within other ritual compositions in the Saiva  system.16  

Looked at from another angle, daily worship contains a synopsis of the  entire Saiva system of ritual. Within this single ritual one finds condensed  enactments of many other Saiva rituals. The rite of self-purification in daily  worship, for instance, is a compressed version of liberating initiation. A  brief offering of the pavitra in daily worship is an abbreviated recapitulation  of the annual pavitrarohana. There are many more examples: vdstupiijd,  abhi?eka, nityotsava, and other rites enacted daily within puja replicate in  abbreviated form larger counterpart rituals. And just as Hindu puja histori 

cally replaced the Vedic sacrifice even while maintaining many of its central  concerns and features, Saiva worship includes within its regular liturgical  program a brief fire sacrifice (homa), subordinated to the more central act of  linga worship but nevertheless present. As daily worship pervades all other  Saiva rituals, so also all other rituals are immanent within daily worship.  

Because daily worship so permeates the ritual practice of Saiva sid dhanta, it offers a privileged point of entry into the Saiva world. We need  then to ask what makes it so important. Why do the Saivas make daily wor ship the paradigmatic ritual in their system of action? What happens in daily  worship that gives it such centrality?  

DAILY WORSHIP AND THE WORSHIPER  

The dominant scholarly viewpoint has regarded puja as an undifferentiated  ritual form. If you've seen one puja, according to this perspective, you've  seen them all. In this study, I take the opposite approach. It is in the very  specificity of the Saiva siddhanta formulation of puja that its primary signif 

icance lies.  

During the early medieval period, the various schools of temple Hindu ism formulated and reformulated their own versions of puja, appropriate  with suitable modifications for both public and domestic practice. Vaikha nasa, Pancaratra, and later Sri Vaisnava schools devoted to Visnu as supreme  god developed forms of daily worship suitable to the theological personality  of Visnu, while PaSupata and Saiva siddhanta groups addressed parallel rituals  of puja to Siva. Forms of puja were developed to reflect differing philo sophical propensities: monist and dualist pujas, idealist and realist pujas. 

Ritual and Human Powers * 39    

Some versions of puja emphasized the efficacy of devotion, while others  stressed knowledge, and still others ritual action itself. Pujd became a com mon ritual form in which contesting schools of thought could enact, display,  and (they each hoped) constitute the shared world of medieval India in ways  consonant with their own metaphysical premises and soteriological aims.  As a central ritual of temple Hinduism, puja acted as a ceremonial arena for  philosophical as well as ritual debate.  

In carefully elaborating puja as a distinctive Saiva siddhanta liturgy, the  Saivas attempted to present puja not simply as a set of ritual injunctions, but  as a condensed practical catechism of the world as it was known through  Saiva philosophy, and as an implicit argument for the superior comprehen 

siveness and efficacy of their system of knowledge and action.  In simplest outline, the daily worship of Siva consists in three main se quences of ritual actions. The first sequence is a set of preliminary rites,  termed the "five purifications" {pancasuddhi), in which the worshiper  makes himself, the ritual substances, the place of worship, the mantras, and  finally the linga suitable for the reception and service of Siva. The second  sequence, termed "invocation" (Svahana), summons Siva into the linga. The  worshiper constructs an elaborate throne and embodiment as a support for  Siva's presence in the ritual and then conveys Siva there. In the third se quence the ritualist offers a series of "services" (upacara) to Siva, as an  expression of his homage. Through his services, the worshiper treats his  chosen deity as a divine guest. After these services have been completed,  the worshiper allows Siva to depart from the linga and nityapuja ends.  Reduced in this way to a formal scheme, such an account gives little indi cation of the significance of Saiva worship. A similar pattern of worship,  with a few variations, can and does underlie the regular puja of Hindu  schools directed toward many Hindu divinities, and a similar pattern is em ployed by worshipers adhering to various philosophical persuasions. At this  level, we have perhaps located the least common denominator of puja as a  form of Hindu worship, but we have learned almost nothing of the particular  role daily worship plays within the Saiva siddhanta system, nor the meaning  it holds for Saiva adherents. As we look more closely, however, we find that  the Saiva texts expand on each element in this outline, developing from the  simple scheme a highly detailed set of prescriptions for daily performance.  Through these expansions, Saiva siddhanta distinguishes its own version of  Saiva puja from all other forms. Moreover, following the principle of con formity between jnana and kriyd, Saiva texts formulate this ritual action as  one fully imbued with Saiva knowledge.  

Within the course of nityapuja the worshiper puts into action all the major  categories and themes of Saiva siddhanta philosophy. In our reenactment of  Saiva puja, we will also explore each of these central Saiva topics. As we  have seen, Saiva metaphysics recognizes three fundamental and irreducible 

40 · Chapter One    

ontological categories: fetters (ράέα), souls (pasu), and Siva (pati). The  basic cosmological processes of the manifest cosmos (i.e., ράέα)—the cy clical emission (srsti) and reabsorption (samhSra) of the oscillating universe—  serve as an ordering principle for ritual procedures throughout daily wor ship. This organizing logic of emission and reabsorption is the focus of  Chapter 2. The soteriological passage of the soul (paiu) from bondage to  Siva-ness, a passage requiring many lifetimes of active endeavor, is re capitulated daily in the rite of self-purification (StmaSuddhi), by which the  worshiper purifies himself for piija. The process of becoming a Siva is the  subject of Chapter 3. Invoking Siva into the IiAga (SvShana), the worshiper  instantiates through his actions a portrait of Siva (pati) as he is known to  Saiva theology. In Chapter 4, we will also formulate a theological depiction  of Siva, based on philosophical description and the ritual procedures of in vocation. Finally, when offering purified substances and "services" (upa caras) to Siva embodied in the linga, the worshiper brings all three categories  of Saiva metaphysics into active relationship with one another. So too we  

will examine the interrelationship of the three categories in Chapter S.  Through his daily practice, the Saiva worshiper enacts the knowledge  of Saiva metaphysics, reviewing it regularly and making it present in  and through his mind, speech, and body. But who is this prototypical  worshiper?  

He is, first of all, an initiated member of the Saiva community, whether  householder, ascetic, or priest. To perform nityapuja, one must at the mini mum undergo samayadik$a, the "general initiation" that confers, according  to most accounts, the competence to perform worship on one's own behalf  (StmSrthapuja). For many Ssuva householders, this is sufficient. A temple  priest who is responsible for offering worship on behalf of others (pa rSrthapiijS), however, must undergo additional ritual preparation: a "lib erating initiation" (nirvanadikfa) and then a "priestly anointment" (acSryd bhifeka) that infuses him with the powers necessary to officiate in public  liturgy. Since the pattern of Saiva worship is largely the same for domestic  and temple worship, I will treat the two as a single ritual format in this  study, noting a few important deviations between them along the way.  

Second, he is a male. The performance of nityapuja, both public and pri vate, is in effect restricted to males because only males are eligible to re ceive the general initiation "with seed" (sablja) that enables one to offer  worship oneself. 'Tor men is performed initiation with seed, which binds  one to the common code of conduct (samayScara), while for those not capa ble [of receiving this initiation] is performed initiation without seed, which  does not confer the common code of conduct" (SP 3.1.9). Those "not capa ble" of receiving the more fruitful sablja initiation, specifies the Svatantra,  are "children, simpletons, elderly persons, women, hedonists, and disabled  persons."17 The participation of women in worshiping Siva, as these texts 

Ritual and Human Powers - 41    

prescribe it, always requires a mediating male, either an initiated husband  performing domestic piija or a consecrated priest administering temple wor ship. Accordingly, in this book, I will refer to our paradigmatic worshiper  throughout as a gender-specific "he."  

The worshiper may belong to any of the four classes (varnas). Unlike the  Vedas, which exclude Siidras from learning or participating in the sacrificial  program, the agamas insist that Sudras also are eligible to receive initiation  and thereby become "twice-borns" according to Saiva reckoning. As such,  they may—indeed, must—study the SivajMna and perform the round of  daily rituals prescribed as the common code of conduct for initiated Saivas.  The priesthood is more restricted. To become a Saiva priest, according to  the agamas, one must belong to one of the five adiSaiva clans of Saiva  brahmanas. The texts distinguish the Saiva brahmanas from other, "ordinary"  brahmans and specifically forbid ordinary brahmans, as well as those be longing to other classes, to perform temple worship.  

By performing ritual, such a worshiper participates actively and con sciously in the world that is revealed in the SivajMna, and in the process he  should come to know that world ever more fully. By following this proto typical Saiva worshiper in his daily piija, we too can aim to reconstitute in  our own minds that Saiva world within which he acts.18 

## 2 Oscillation in the Ritual Universe  

THE UNIVERSE oscillates. It comes and goes, emerges and disappears. This  is a basic cosmological tenet for many schools of Hindu thought: the uni verse as we know it undergoes an endless cycle of creations and destruc tions. Within each cycle, the cosmos begins as an undifferentiated "some thing" from which evolves, in orderly sequence, the multiplicity of creation  that we see all around us. In time the cosmos exhausts itself, and all this  multiplicity merges once again into its undifferentiated source. A period of  cessation or sleep follows, and then the cosmos begins its evolution again in  the next cycle. In this way, our universe oscillates between moments of  creation and destruction, evolution and involution, activity and quietude,  expansion and contraction.  

For Saivas, this pulsation does not confine itself to cosmogonic motion.  Rather, it is a ubiquitous principle of a dynamic universe, governing all  creation. Cyclical phenomena such as the alternation of day and night, the  recurring phases of the moon, and the annual succession of the seasons all  exemplify the cosmic pattern of oscillation. So too the sequence of bodily  births and deaths through which each human soul transmigrates forms part  of the larger cycle of creation and destruction that characterizes the Saiva  world.  

Saiva daily worship also echoes the rhythm of the oscillating universe.  The paired concepts of "emission" (srsti) and "reabsorption" (samhara), with  which Saivite cosmology describes the movements of the oscillating uni verse, are embedded as an organizing logic in the patterning of worship. As  I will show in this chapter, the Saiva worshiper repeatedly enacts in his  ritual performance the motions of emission and reabsorption, which are at  the same time the activities Siva himself performs to animate the cosmos.  

EMISSION AND REABSORPTION  

According to Saiva philosophy, Siva performs five fundamental activities  (pancakrtya) that shape and activate the universe. Of these, the two highest  activities relate primarily to the soul: he "veils" (Jirobhdva) the true nature  of things from bound souls, and he grants "grace" (anugraha) to souls when  they are ready for it, liberating them from their bondage. (I will focus on  these activities in the next chapter.) His other three activities—emission,  maintenance (sthiti), and reabsorption—bring about the complex evolutions

and involutions of the substantive worlds in which souls reside. Mainte nance denotes an activity of stabilization or stasis, whereby Siva enables  things to stay temporarily as they are. As such, it does not figure promi nently in the dynamic cosmology of Saiva siddhanta. Siva acts on substance  primarily through his paired activities of emission and reabsoiption, which  set in motion the oscillations of our ever-fluctuating world. Through these  interventions, Siva acts as the ultimate instrumental cause (nimitta)—  

though not as material cause (upadana)—of all cosmic movement.  diva's five fundamental activities are made most visibly apparent to a  human audience in the famous iconic form of Siva as the Dancing Lord  (nataraja), developed by South Indian artisans during the Cola period and  heavily patronized by Cola rulers.1 (Rajaraja made the Dancing Lord Siva  the central processional deity of his great temple in Thanjavur, for exam ple.) Here Siva elegantly dances within a flaming hoop, his matted hair  swirling outward as he crushes underfoot a demon and raises his other foot  aloft. (See Plate 1.) As Tamil exegetes have explained, the demon below is  Apasmara, ignorance, and Siva's raised foot grants grace. His right hand  extended in the gesture of "fear not" indicates his activity of maintenance or  protection. The circle with its flames represents the material cosmos, onto logically separate from the Lord, which Siva keeps in perpetual oscillating  motion with his two hands holding the drum of emission and the fire of  reabsorption.  

Movement brought about through emanation is said to follow the "path of  emission" {sr$timarga), while the converse movement follows the "path of  reabsorption" (samharamarga). Movement or transformation (parindma)  along these paths can be described by various terms. The path of emission  denotes a movement from unity to differentiation, from one to many, from  pervasiveness to increasing particularity. By contrast, the path of reabsorp tion reintegrates that which has become separated; it reinstates the unity lost  through differentiation.  

The notions of emission and reabsorption embody an ontological princi ple at the same time as they describe a cosmological process. The character  or inherent nature (svabhdva) of a thing is in an important sense determined  by its position within a path of emission. Within any domain, that which is  more proximate to the emitting source enjoys an ontological priority over  that which is further removed from it.  

This principle has several important ramifications. Emission indicates a  general movement from subtle (siiksma) and relatively intangible to gross  (StMla) and relatively tangible; reabsorption the reverse. Emission moves  from pure to impure, while reabsorption moves from impure to pure. Be 

cause of their relative subtlety and purity, less differentiated objects are su perior to highly differentiated ones. Emission follows a path of diminishing  rank, reabsorption the opposite.44 · Chapter Two    

Emission and reabsoiption relate as well to the disposition of things in  space. The path of emission is most often represented visually as a descend ing motion from high to low, or as a radiating movement proceeding out ward from a center toward peripheries. Reabsorption ascends or moves  inward toward a center. The representation of emission as centrifugal move ment and reabsorption as centripetal is a common convention in Indian vis ual arts, and as we will see, it is an important spatial principle in Saiva  ritual. Since emission involves a movement from what is pervasive to what  is particular, the center in such representations does not simply denote one  element among many. As the emitting source, it encompasses or includes  within it all peripheral elements; it represents the whole of which the periph eral elements are subsidiary parts.  

The notions of emission and reabsorption, then, govern a bundle of con trastive terms, interconnected by two converse paths of movement:  

unity differentiation  

integration disintegration  

subtle emission • gross  

pure impure  

superior inferior  

high reabsorption low  

center periphery  

encompassing encompassed  

The rhythm of the manifest universe is an oscillation back and forth between  these opposite poles, under the direction of Siva, the ultimate instrumental  cause of all transformation.  

The linked movements of emission and reabsorption are fundamental  processes of the cosmos, and we may observe them in many domains. Most  important, the emission and reabsorption of the tattvas (the "such-nesses" or  constituent units of manifest being) from and into their source-substances  maya and mahdmayd are the basic cosmological processes creating the man 

ifest worlds in which we live. For Saiva cosmology, maya is the material  cause of our world. It is real and substantive (vastuta), not illusory, and it  is ontologically separate from Siva. (In this respect, Saivas accept a  Samkhya-Iike dualism and reject the monism of schools like Advaita  Vedanta and Kashmiri Saivism.) At the outset of each creation, maya is  undifferentiated and pervasive. Siva then agitates maya with his appointed  powers and causes it to emit, in orderly sequence, the differentiated thirty one tattvas of the impure cosmos. (See Figure 1 for a mapping of the  tattvas' evolution.) While maya is subde, its derivative tattvas become in 

creasingly tangible until we reach the five material elements (bhuta), among  which Earth is the most highly differentiated and gross of all tattvas. These  differentiated tattvas enter into multiple combinations with one another, to-

Such an emission and reabsorption of constituents take place as well for 

46 · Chapter Two    

each individual soul, in life after life. Human creation occurs when a con catenation of substances forms itself into a human body and a soul enters  into that material substratum. The soul, which is the core of that human  person, inhabits the body—which itself undergoes a continuing fluctuation  of substance over time—until the moment of death. After that, the constitu ents of the body return to their sources through a ceremonial cremation. The  soulless body becomes, in ritual, a "Great Oblation" offered into the sacrifi cial fire Agni, identified by the Saivas as a form of Siva's destructive en ergy, and ceases to exist as an identifiable form.  

The agamas result from a parallel process of emission. From undifferenti ated sound (nada), they are first transformed into audible sound (sabda) and  then passed down from Siva in his highest form through a number of hier archically inferior, more differentiated forms of Siva and other deities, until  they are finally transmitted to a human audience. In the process, the unitary  sivajfiana is diversified into twenty-eight basic agamas, which further gen erate a host of subsidiary agamas and other ancillary works. Even the alpha bet that encodes the agamas derives from a process of emission, whereby  the differentiated letters emanate from undifferentiated nada?  

The movements of emission and reabsorption are relevant to still other  parts of the world. One example important to ritual performance is the dis tinction between bubhuksu ("one who desires worldly enjoyments") and  mumuksu ("one who desires liberation"). According to the agamas, humans  have two basic goals: worldly enjoyment (Jbhoga) and liberation (moksa).  The texts go on to divide members of the Saiva religious community into  two broad categories, according to the goal each hopes to achieve in this  lifetime through observance of rituals and proper conduct. The householder  (grhastha) pursues various worldly benefits, such as wealth, offspring, and  good crops, and so is described as bubhuksu. Although the householder may  also desire liberation, this goal, for him, is remote and secondary. The as 

cetic or renouncer has repudiated what the householder desires and instead  strives to achieve liberation as soon as possible. He is therefore called  mumuksu.  

The agamas frequently direct these two types of Saivites to follow diverg ing practices within ritual. The texts may require them, for instance, to  place mantras on parts of their body in a differing order, to face in different  directions when seated, or to cut their topknots to unequal lengths. Signifi cantly, the bubhuksu is consistently directed to follow a procedure that repre sents the path of emission, while the mumuksu must always follow the path  of reabsorption. Why should this be the case? Although the texts do not  explicitly tell us, it is not difficult to postulate a satisfying explanation. The  householder seeks worldly benefits, things that come about through the dif ferentiation of the cosmos. The renouncer pursues liberation through a pu rification of himself, a decreasing involvement with the material aspects of 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe * 47    

his being, and a reunification of his soul as similar to Siva. Thus the house holder and the renouncer mirror, by their own actions and the purposes with  which they undertake them, Siva's activities of emission and reabsorption,  respectively. So too in ritual their actions recapitulate these fundamental  

principles of the cosmos in accord with their own purposes.  The movements of emission and reabsorption appear throughout daily  worship, and all Saiva ritual, as basic organizing principles. They order ele ments and actions within the ritual, and in so doing they bring this ritual  order into accord with the fundamental order of the cosmos. As Siva causes  the constituents of the manifest world to be emitted and reabsorbed, the  worshiper himself, acting as a Siva, causes the elements of the ritual domain  to follow the same pattern of emission and reabsorption. Let us examine  how he does so.  

METAMORPHOSIS OF THE HANDS  

Near the beginning of daily worship, at the commencement of self-purifica tion (dtmasuddhi), the worshiper is directed to "impose mantras on his  hands" (karany&sa). This simple rite is an important preparation for the acts  that follow, many of which require use of the hands for their performance.  "Ritual actions such as imposing mantras are done with the hands," explains  Mrgendragama, "so the hands must be impregnated with mantras before hand" (MrA kriya 3.2). By imposing mantras on them, the ritualist "trans forms the hands into a Siva" (sivlkarana) or "permeates the entire hand with  Sakti." Karanyasa, then, is a rite of metamorphosis, by which the wor shiper temporarily transforms his hands from their normal state to a divine  one, a condition in which they are capable of performing all subsequent  rites.  

To metamorphose his hands, the worshiper must do two things: first  purify them, and then impose onto them a series of powerful mantras. He  purifies his hands by rubbing each hand and reciting the ASTRA ("weapon")  mantra, which (Nirmalamani tells us) with its fiery form burns off all impuri ties up to the wrists (KKDP p. 25). He next inundates them with the SAKTI  mantra. Once this purification is completed, the worshiper may begin to  reconstruct his hands as Siva-like instruments by imposing mantras.  

"Imposition" (nyasa) of mantras is one of the most basic and frequent  ritual actions in the Saiva system. One imposes a mantra onto some object  simply by touching that object and reciting the mantra. In some cases, the  texts also direct the worshiper to visualize (bhavana) the form of the deity  referred to by the mantra as he imposes it. The power of the mantra and of  the deity with which it is identical infuses the object, and the object is  thereby transformed.4  

In transforming his hands, as in many other ritual operations, the wor-

48 · Chapter Two    

shiper imposes two primary groups of mantras, the five brahmamantras and  the six aAgamantras. Because these two sets, along with the MOLA mantra,  are the most frequently employed and efficacious of all Saiva mantras, it is  necessary to consider briefly just what they are.  

When Siva performs the five fundamental activities, he employs the five  brahmamantras. In simplest form they are:  

Orp hom, I bow to Hana.  

Oip hem, I bow to Tatpura$a.  

Om huin, I bow to Aghora.  

Om hiiji, I bow to Vama.  

Om ham, I bow to Sadyojata.  

Each mantra effects a particular action: KANA grants grace, TATPURUSA veils,  AGHORA reabsorbs, VAMA stabilizes, and SADYOJATA emits. Since these  mantras are, in effect, the instruments with which Siva acts in the world,  they are said to constitute his "body." "Siva's body, beginning with the  head, is composed of the five mantras that are appropriate for the five activ 

ities: KANA1 TATPURUSA, AGHORA, VAMA, and SADYOJATA" (MrA vidya 3.8- 9). In a similar fashion, the five mantras make up the five faces of SadaSiva,  the most complete manifest form of the divinity. ΚΑΝΑ, in this case, is the  upraised face of Sadagiva, TATPURUSA the eastern face, and so on in a gener ally circumambulatory order.

In Saiva ritual, the performer most often imposes the five mantras as a hier archical set onto some entity to give that entity the powers of Siva, to enable  it to act as a Siva.5  

In his cosmic activities, Siva employs still other mantras, most important  of which are the six aAgamantras ("limb-mantras"). "Just as fire and the sun  are powerful because of their rays," Kamikagama tells us, "Siva is likewise  invincible and all-performing because of his limbs (aAga), which arise from  

his inherent nature" (KA 4.362-63). Siva's six limb-mantras are NETRA  (eye), HRD (heart), SIRAS (head), SIKHA (topknot), KAVACA (armor), and  ASTRA (weapon).6 The worshiper often uses these mantras individually to  effect particular ritual transformations: KAVACA, for instance, is particularly  suitable for protecting things, while HRD is the mantra appropriate for fill 

ing or pouring something into something else. The aAgamantras may also be  imposed as a set, granting still more of Siva's own mantra powers to the

recipient.7 So by imposing the brahmamantras and angamantras onto his  hands, the worshiper literally makes them similar to Siva.  The texts specify the fingers on which the brahmamantras are to be im posed. ISANA is to be on the thumbs, TATPURUSA on the index fingers,  AGHORA on the middle fingers, VAMA on the ring fingers, and SADYOJATA on  the little fingers. Similarly, the worshiper imposes the angamantras onto spe cific places, NETRA is placed on the palms, ASTRA on the thumbs, KAVACA  on the index fingers, SKHA on the middle fingers, SIRAS on the ring fingers,  and HRD on the little fingers. (See Figure 2 and also the photograph sequence  of karanyasa, Plate 2.) Once the connection between particular mantras and  fingers is established, it is maintained throughout the ritual. Whenever the  brahmamantras are imposed later in the ritual, the appropriate fingers are to  be used (AA 20.81-84).    

The locations of the mantras on the fingers do not vary. However, de pending on whether one is a householder or a renouncer, the order in which  they are to be placed does. The Kamikagama spells this out clearly:  

The householder should impose mantras on his hands according to the path of  emission. For forest-dwellers and ascetics [i.e., mumuksus], imposition according  to the path of reabsorption is recommended. Imposing the brahmamantras ISANA  through SADYOJATA on the five fingers beginning with the thumb and ending with  the litde finger, respectively, is termed imposition according to emission. Plac ing SADYOJATA to ISANA on the fingers beginning with the little finger and ending  with the thumb is called imposition according to reabsorption. (KA 4.43-43)  

The text then adds, as if to make sure we observe the connection: "The order  here is the same as the order of emission and reabsorption of the world."  

50 · Chapter Two    

Similarly, the angamantras are placed beginning with the thumbs in the case  of householders, and beginning with die little fingers for renouncers.  NETRA, the sixth aAgamantra, is placed on the palms. The hands of the ritual ist, now infused with mantras, can be diagrammed as follows:

Having establish a connection between the householder and the path of  emission, and between the renouncer and the path of reabsorption, one must  now ask why each is connected with parallel yet opposing sequences of fin gers and mantras. The logic to the choice of these two sequences can be  uncovered with a closer look.  

No intrinsic connection links the various fingers and the mantras placed  on them. Nothing about the index finger in itself, that is, makes it an appro priate location for TATPURUSA.8 We must attend instead to a series of associ ations between the two sets of mantras employed in this rite and other reali ties. As shown already, the five brahmamantras are connected with diva's  

five fundamental activities and with the five faces of SadaSiva. But the Saiva  texts do not stop there. Rather, they establish a whole series of associative  connections linking the brahmamantras to the five kalas, the five elements,  the thirty-six tattvas, the parts of the body, the worlds, and so on: in short,  to all basic constituents of the cosmos. In addition, the five brahmamantras  are related to the five angamantras used in this rite. This connection corre 

sponds to the way they are placed together on the fingers here. ISANA is  associated with ASTRA and both are imposed on the thumb, TATPURUSA and  KAVACA are on the index finger, and so on.  

The order of placement may become clearer by looking at two sets of  associated realities, the five material elements and five bodily parts, as they  are related to the brahmamantras and angamantras.

ISANA ASTRA Ether head  

TATPURUSA KAVACA Wind face

VAMA SIRAS Water genitals

The set of material elements certainly follows the path of emission as we  read the chart downwards—Ether is more subtle and pure than Wind, Wind  than Fire, and so on. Similarly, the parts of the body descend according to  the path of emission. And so too the two sets of mantras are arranged in an 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe 51    

order of ontological priority, with ISANA considered more subtle than  TATPURUSA, and so on.  

In no case are the elements of the sets directly linked in a chain of emis sion. Ether does not emit Wind, and the head does not emit the feet; nor  does KANA emit TATPURUSA. Rather, the elements of each set are positioned  toward one another according to criteria (purity, subtlety, etc.) that are  comprehended by the concepts of emission and reabsorption. Ether is to  Wind as KANA is to TATPURUSA—higher on the scale of emission. Thus, a  common principle—that of cosmic movement—relates multiple sets to one  another.  

This ranking of the five brahmamantras, identical with SadaSiva's faces,  is further supported by their association with the five activities. The ISana  face of SadaSiva undertakes the activity of grace, the highest of the five,  while the Sadyojata face performs emission, the lowest. In the view of  Kamikagama, it was the Isana face that emanated the saivagamas, while the  other faces produced inferior systems of knowledge. Similarly, in any cir cumambulation of a linga, ISana is honored first, then Tatpurusa, Aghora,  Vama, and Sadyojata, following their order of rank.  

We are now in a position to summarize the logic of die two converse  sequences of imposing mantras onto the hands. In transforming the hands so  that they are suitable for subsequent rites, the ritualist is directed to follow  one or another order of placement, according to whether he is a householder  or a renouncer. The order of placement corresponds to either the path of  emission or the path of reabsorption.  

The connection between SadaSiva's five faces and the parts of the body  reminds us that the logic of emission and reabsorption extends to the body  as well. The higher portions of the body correspond to the higher elements,  the superior faces of Sadasiva, and thus to the more subtle, pure, unified  range of things. The lower body portions similarly coincide with the less  subtle, more differentiated. Such a vaulation of the upright human body, in  which the head is superior and pure while the feet are inferior and impure,  will be familiar to all students of Indian culture; the $aivas have simply  adapted it to their own cosmological premises. As the Kamikagama summa rizes: "Beginning with the head is called the order of emission; beginning  with the feet would be the order of reabsorption" (KA 4.48). This correspon dence between movements within the body and the paths of cosmic move 

ment is crucial to the rite of self-purification.  

TRANSFORMATION OF THE BODY  

The body of the worshiper is one of the two material focal points of daily  worship. (The IiAga is the other.) Accordingly, procedures relating to the  worshiper's body within the ritual are quite complex, worthy of a separate  study in themselves. Like Siva, the god who encompasses apparent contra-

52 · Chapter Two    

dictions, the body must serve seemingly contrary purposes during worship.  The body is both actor and acted upon; it performs the myriad ritual actions  and is also the object of many of these actions. The disposition of the body  within the ritual space must always be taken into account, and yet the body  itself becomes a ritual terrain in "internal worship." The worshiper trans forms his body into a Siva-like form, invokes Siva into several locations in  his body, worships those manifestations of Siva within himself, and then  uses his Siva-body to perform services for a Siva apart from himself.  

The most important ritual process involving the worshiper's body is the  rite of self-purification (atmaiuddhi). Self-purification is one of the "five  purifications" {pancaSuddhi) necessary to transform the entire ritual domain  into a suitably pure condition: purification of self, of the place (sthana), of  the mantras, of the linga, and of the substances (dravya) to be offered. The  worshiper performs atmasuddhi early in puja in order to render his body fit  for subsequent parts of the ritual.  

"Only a Siva can worship Siva," say the texts. Yet in his normal condi tion the worshiper is unlike Siva in two fundamental respects: he is im mersed in impurities, and he lacks Siva's powers. Before he may worship  Siva, he must deal with both these deficiencies. First, with a set of purifica tory actions he empties his body of its impure material constituents; then he  superimposes mantras invoking Siva's powers onto all parts of his body. In  this way his body is made over into an unfettered "divine body," a pure  body composed of mantra powers. As Siva acts through mantras that consti tute his body, so the worshiper is now able to act in ritual with his body  reconstituted as a mantra-body.  

The relevance of emission and reabsorption to this rite may be stated very  briefly. Upward movements on or within the body follow the path of reab sorption, while descending movements follow the path of emission. Ritual  actions aimed at removing things from the body follow an ascending course,  and actions that impose or add things onto the body move downward. The  movement that the ritualist follows in transforming his body is therefore  cyclic: first ascending as he reabsorbs all bodily impurities, then descending  as he imposes mantras on it. In the process, he fundamentally alters the  constituents of his body, replacing impurities with the powers of mantras.  

Purification  

The worshiper removes the impurities from his body in two steps. He first  reabsorbs all the tattvas of his subtle body (sukfmaiarira), and then he col lapses and burns the elements of his gross body (sthHlasarira). These pro cesses result in a profound emptying out of the body, leaving it a kind of  tabula rasa to be filled subsequently with mantras. Although the texts offer  

a variety of methods for achieving this aim, I will focus here on the two  most common techniques, as described by AghoraSiva. 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe * S3    

The purification of the subtle body is an explicit application of the notion  of reabsorption. The subtle body, for the Saivas, is made up of the thirty-six  differentiated tattvas, dispersed throughout the body. In their differentiated  state, these tattvas are inherently impure. The Saivas do not view impurity  as a "pollution" that infects normally pure matter. There is no attempt here  to distinguish pure from impure tattvas, or to identify and counteract partic ular sources of impurity in the subtle body. Rather, everything in a state of  differentiation is impure. Accordingly, the entire constitution of the subtle  body—all the tattvas that form the manifest cosmos—must be reabsorbed  into the two undifferentiated source-substances, maya and mah&m&ya. Pu rity exists only in the state of integration, where all material constituents are  unified within their sources.  

The method of purification, therefore, follows the order of reabsorption.  Says AghoraSiva: "In order to purify the subtle body, the worshiper should  cause the tattvas to be dissolved (Iaya), each into its own source (karana), in  an inverse order [to that of their emission] ending with mahamaya" (KKD  p. 57). His commentator, Nirmalamani, glosses Iaya as "reabsorption" and  explains that each tattva "goes within" the source-substance that gave birth  to it. The worshiper carries out this reabsorption through internal visualiza tion. "Accordingly, he should visualize Earth reabsorbed into Odor, Water  into Taste, Fire into Form, Wind into Touch, Ether into Sound, and these  perceptible qualities (tanmatra) into the inert aspect of the ego (tama sahamkara)" (KKD p. 57). And so on, reversing the order of emission, until  the thirty-one tattvas of the impure domain (aiuddhadhvan) are unified in  maya and the five tattvas of the pure domain reintegrated within mahamaya.  (See Figure 1, reading the chart upward.) In this integral state, maya and  mahamaya are completely without impurity.  

By absorbing all the tattvas of the subtle body into their two sources, the  worshiper is able to remove a large part of the impurities that distinguish his  body from that of Siva. Yet other impurities still bind the worshiper's soul.  There are also impurities of the gross body, identified with the five material  elements (bhiitas), Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Ether.  

To purify the body of these elements, the worshiper must imagine each of  them as a "domain" (mandala). Then from each domain he expels all its attri butes or inherent perceptible qualities (tanmatra) with an expulsion of  breath and imagines each element to have assumed the form of its opposing  element. Once these elements have been collapsed into one another, the  worshiper uses an imagined fire to consume finally all impurities arising  from his body.  

I will consider two features of this rite in greater detail: the visualiza tion of the domains for each element, and the procedure for expelling the  attributes.  

Each material element has a domain, which the worshiper is required to  represent visually to himself. The texts describe the features of each domain54 · Chapter Two

succinctly, as an aid to visualization. Aghorasiva, for instance, lists the  color, character, form, insignia, governor (adhisthatr), seed-syllable, Kara neSvara, and kala of each domain.  

He should visualize the Earth mandala as yellow, firm, square, and decorated with  a thunderbolt; it is presided over by its governor Sadyojata; it is connected with  the seed-syllable of Earth, HLAM, and with Brahman as its Karanesvara, and it has  the form of nivrttikala; it extends from the feet up to the head. (KKD pp. 57-58)  

And so on, with each ascending domain.9  

Each domain is situated in a particular part of the body. Kamikagama  reports two differing traditions, one relating the domains to the parts of the  body, the other to the five "subtle centers" (granthi). Both locate the do mains in an ascending order of reabsorption. Each also relates them to dei ties that form a part of the visualization. Version one, illustrated in Figure  3, relates the regions to the five faces of Sadasiva, as described in the pre ceding section. Version two relates them to the locations of the subtle cen ters, presided over by the Karanesvaras.  

The KaraneSvaras are important because they govern the body's breath  channels, and these channels are crucial in the many ritual acts involving the  breath. The Saivas, as do other yogic schools of Hinduism, envision the  human organism as having a "subtle anatomy" of breath channels in addi-

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe · 55    

tion to its more evident, "gross" physique. The subtle anatomy is called into  play whenever controlled yogic breathing (pr&nay&ma) is employed in ritual,  for it describes the inner conduits along which the breath flows. (This "sub tle anatomy" is not directly related to the "subtle body" of the thirty-six  tattvas discussed above.)  

Aghorasiva describes it this way:  

The worshiper should then visualize the sufumna: it is a hollow tube, double from  the two big toes up as far as the abdomen, and single above that up to the brah marandhra, connected at the heart, throat, and other subtle centers with the ida  and pingala, and fastened [at each center] with upside-down lotus buds. (KKD  p. 56)  

The body contains three tubes or subtle channels (nadi) through which the  breath flows—the ida, pingala, and su^umna. These tubes are connected at five  subtle centers (granthis, literally "joint"), located at the heart, throat, pal ate, eyebrows, and brahmarandhra (the "divine aperture" at the top of the  head). The granthis are visualized as lotus buds that bind the tubes, often  restricting the breath's passage through them. Each granthi has a "lord"  

whose duty it is to preside over it. These lords are the KaraneSvaras: Brah man presides over the heart, Vi§nu the throat, Rudra the palate, Kvara the  eyebrows, and SadaSiva the brahmarandhra. As with the five parts of  Sadasiva, they are hierarchically ordered in the body, with Brahman the  

lowest and SadaSiva the highest. (See Figure 4.)  

Above the brahmarandhra the Saivas envision one more center still: the  dvadasanta, twelve thumb-widths above the worshiper's head. It is here,  outside the body and yet close by it, that Siva resides in his highest, form less aspect, as ParamaSiva (KKD p. 5). And because this is the ritual "loca tion" of ParamaSiva (who, as we will see, is pervasive and limitless), the  dvadasanta acts as an important target for many ritual operations.  

Each domain has a number of attributes, corresponding to the number of  perceptible qualities present in each material element. The element Earth  contains all five sensory qualities—Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, and Odor.  Water has four qualities (omitting Odor), Fire has three, and so on. Accord ingly the worshiper must expel all five attributes from the visualized Earth  domain, four attributes from Water, and so on for each domain. Each attri 

bute must be expelled by an individual "expulsion" (udghata).  

Beginning with an inhalation, he sets his breath in motion along the sufumna up  to dvadasanta, reciting: Om hlam hlam hlam hlam hlam, to nivrttikala, hah hum  phat" He returns his breath, and exhales it through the right channel. When he  has thus evicted the perceptible qualities Odor, Taste, Form, Touch, and Sound  with five such expulsions he should visualize the element Earth subdued by its  own opponent, Wind, and resembling it (KKD pp. 57-58)

(The mysterious nivrttikala appearing in the mantra here will be explained in  the next chapter.)  

The ejection that expels each attribute is a breath that ascends in the wor shiper's body, flowing along the susumna, the central channel, all the way to  the dvddaianta. (See photographs of udghata, Plate 4.) Several other ritual  procedures require that the breath be directed along the susumna in the same  way. For example, in order to protect the soul from the annihilating fire  

used in self-purification, the worshiper transports it along the susumna to the  dvadasanta, where it merges with Siva. He first uses a mantra to force open  the granthis; then,  

he casts his breath upward while giving the mudra of reabsorption (samha ramud.ro) and reciting, "Om hum ham ham ham hum, I bow to the soul," and  with one ejection discharging the KaraQeSvaras in order beginning with Brahman,  he joins his soul with Siva in the dvadaianta. (KKD p. 57)  

After he has purified the body, the worshiper leads the soul back into it with  an inhalation, "descending according to the order of emission" (KKD  p. 59). Similarly, the PRASADA mantra, used in purifying the mantras and in  the invocation of Siva, is directed along the susumna until it merges with  ParamaSiva in the dvadatenta, as I will describe in Chapter 4.  

In all these cases, one uses ascending movements of breath along the  su$umna to remove things from the body. They either expel impurities from  the body or transport more subtle things (such as the soul or mantras) to a  more pure location outside the body. The yoga-controlled breath follows the  path of reabsorption upward.  

When the worshiper has expelled the attributes of each elemental mandala  using the upward ejection of breath, he visualizes that each element has  taken on the form of, and been neutralized by, its contrary element. The  element Mnd subdues Earth, and is in turn subdued by it. Water conquers  and is conquered by Fire. Ether takes on the form of Highest Ether (pa 

ramdkdsa). Mth the obstructive forces of the elements thus curbed, the  worshiper is now able to annihilate them fully. "Then, with the fire arising  from his right big toe, and with the ASTRA mantra, he burns the impurities  of the elements located in the body, which is the product of karmcm whose  consequences have begun (prarabdha), and then inundates it" (KKD p. 58).  The imagined fire, following the path of reabsorption upward from his toe,  purifies his gross body, as the visualized reabsorption of tattvas into their  source-substances purified his subtle body. And so, with both aspects of his  material form suitably cleansed of all impurities, the worshiper pictures it to  himself as a pure, empty frame.  

Imagining it completely emptied of all that has the form of a fetter, the worshiper  should bathe his entire body, inside and out, with streams of nectar flowing from 

58 · Chapter Two    

the upside-down lotus at the top of his crown, penetrating the openings of every  capillary, using MOLA ending in VAUSAT. (KKD p. 59)  

All impurities that normally distinguish the worshiper's body from that of  Siva have now been ritually extirpated.10  

Reconstruction  

The purifications completely empty the worshiper's body of impurities. The  subsequent rite, which imposes mantras onto the body, reconstructs the  body. Since mantras replace the impure constituents that were removed  through purification, the worshiper's rebuilt body exists at a higher state of  being than before. The texts refer to it as a "divine body" and as a "body of  mantras," a Siva-like instrument that enables the transformed worshiper to  perform all the ritual operations of nityapuja to follow. (The body of man tras the worshiper imposes onto himself is exactly parallel to the divine  body he later imposes onto the linga, into which Siva is invoked.) And, as  purification follows the path of reabsorption, this reconstruction, which  adds powers to the body, follows the path of emission.  

A minimal reconstruction of the body requires only that the worshiper  impose five ahgamantras (omitting NETRA) onto suitable parts of the body.  AghoraSiva prescribes this method for worship on one's own behalf. The  worshiper begins by imposing the HRD ("heart") mantra, appropriately, onto  his heart, using his thumb and little finger, onto which HRD has previously  been imposed during karanydsa. Next he imposes SDRAS ("head") onto the  crown, using thumb and ring finger, and so on.

ASTRA palms two ring fingers  

While the order of placement here does not follow a clearly descending bod ily course, indicating the path of emission, it might be better characterized  as a movement from the center outward: beginning with the heart, the inner most bodily constituent, where the soul is sometimes localized, and ending  

with the external adjuncts of armor covering throat and chest and weapons  held in the hands. Emission, too, follows this route.  

The Kamikagama prescribes a much more elaborate method of recon struction for a priest performing puja on behalf of others. Not only must the  priest impose the angamantras onto his body; he should also impose the  brahmamantras, the thirty-eight kalas, the mantras of the fifty-one letters of 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe * 39    

the alphabet, the "limbs" of the alphabet, nine unspecified tattvas, and the  VYOMAVYAPIN ("space-pervading") mantra. Of these seven sets, five follow  a clearly descending bodily arrangement. The remaining two, the angaman tras and the alphabet angamantras, follow a course that moves from inside  out. Thus all, in this sense, are imposed onto the body according to the  order of emission.  

The priest begins his mantra impositions by placing the five brahmaman tras on five segments of the body, starting with ISANA on the head and con tinuing with TATPURUSA on the mouth, AGHORA on the heart, VAMA on the  genitals, and SADYOJATA on the feet. (See photograph sequence on brahma mantranyasa, Plate 3.) As with the placement of the angamantras, the wor shiper here uses for each imposition the finger onto which the corresponding  mantra has already been placed: the thumb, already impregnated with  KANA, imposes ISANA onto the head, and so on. The five brahmamantras  constitute the active body of Sadasiva, sometimes visualized as SadaSiva's  five faces. As an alternative, Kamikagama tells us, the worshiper may pre fer to impose the five brahmamantras onto his own five "faces": ISANA on  his upraised face (i.e., the top of his head), TATPURUSA on his easterly face  (his actual face, since he is facing east), and so on around his head in cir cumambulatory order. In either case, it is clear, the priest is invoking onto  his own body the most fundamental powers of Siva himself; he is recon structing his body as a SadaSiva.  

If the five faces of SadaSiva represent Siva's active power differentiated  into five fundamental activities, the thirty-eight kalas represent a further  particularization of Siva's power. The term kala in general usage denotes a  portion of some larger unity, such as the sixteen "digits" of the moon or the  interest accruing on the principal of a loan. Saivas use the term to refer to  several different partitioned wholes, as we will see in succeeding chapters.  Here, the thirty-eight kolas are saktis, portions of the unitaiy energy  whereby Sadasiva acts in the world, and they are grouped in sets pertaining  to each of his five faces.11 Thus, ISANA has five related kalas (SaSinT, AA gada, I§ta, Marici, and Jvalini), TATPURU$A has four, AGHORA eight, and so  on. After imposing the five brahmamantras, the worshiper may place the  thirty-eight kalamantras on appropriate parts of his body, again following  the order of emission. He begins with the five kalamantras of the ISANA  group, imposing them onto his five faces: SASINI on his upraised face,  ANGADA on his easterly face, and continuing in circumambulatory fashion.  The four kalamantras of TAIPURU$A are to be placed, again, on the four  mouths, omitting the upraised one; the eight kalas of AGHORA are imposed  onto the middle of the body, from neck to abdomen, where AGHORA has  already been placed; and so on to complete the full set. Each group of  kalamantras further empowers the portion of the worshiper's body where  the corresponding brahmamantra is located. 

60 · Chapter Two    

After several more sets of mantras, Kdmikagama tells us, the worshiper  should complete the construction of his divine body with the VYOMAVYAPIN  mantra: "Then he should impose VYOMAVYAPIN on his body from the head  to the toes" (Κά 4.176). This is the final mantra imposition in the process of  reconstruction. For the MataAgaparameivaragama, VYOMAVYAPIN is the  womb of all mantras (MPA kriya 1.60), a Sakti who is the veritable body of  Siva (MPAV vidya 7.31), a goddess of eighty-one words. In its eighty-one  parts are contained, according to this account, the five brahmamantras, the  angamantras, the eight mantras of the VidyeSvaras1 GAYATRI, SAVITRI, man tras pertaining to Can<Ja, the eight World Guardians, and others still. In other  words, it is a comprehensive mantra, a mantra that contains condensed  forms of a great many other mantras. In fact, according to ViSvanatha, the  mantra evokes the entire world of Siva.12 As with other sets of mantras,  VYOMAVYAPIN is reversible: one may recite it either according to the order  of emission or to that of reabsorption. Here, employing the mantra to help  empower his body for ritual, the worshiper imposes VYOMAVYAPIN accord ing to the order of emission and places its eighty-one portions from his head  down to his toes.  

So, covering his body repeatedly with groups of mantras, following the  path of emission for each group, the worshiper builds his divine body. After  a purificatory reabsorption of all worldly constituents, he imposes onto  every part of his frame mantras that instantiate the very powers with which  Siva acts, until he attains a "state of mantra" (mantratva). When the meta 

morphosis is complete, the worshiper has emitted for himself a body similar  to that of Siva, a divine body saturated with mantra powers. With this divine  body he also may act as a Siva within the sphere of ritual.  

CONSTRUCTION OF RITUAL SPACES  

Daily worship performed on behalf of others takes place in a temple. The  temple itself has been constructed in accord with agama prescription and  has been ritually constituted through a series of rites beginning with the ini tial plowing of the earth and ending with the final establishment (pratitfha) of  the central linga. The temple has its own geography, its own disposition of  structures, and its own organization of images. The priest performing puja  must move within and through this preexisting structure. Moreover, during  the course of temple worship, he is called upon to construct new ritual  spaces within the temple.  

Temple space, like the worshiper's body, is organized in Saiva ritual ac cording to cosmological principles. The primary organizing logic of each of  these structures—permanent temple and temporary ritual constructs—is that  of emission and reabsorption.  

In the preceding section, the primary visual point of reference was the  human body as a vertical axis. Actions following the path of emission took 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe * 61    

a descending course, and those following reabsorption an ascending one.  In considering ritual spaces, however, the most apt visual image is a two dimensional horizontal diagram with a distinct center. The diagram may  be a circle, a lotus design, a square, or a rectangle. What is important is  that it have a center and outer elements constituting its peripheries, arranged  as concentric "circuits" of locations. Objects and deities are located within  these spaces according to their relation to the emitting center of the space.  Movements within such spaces must participate in the same logic: move 

ment from the center outward follows the path of emission, while move ment from the peripheries inward toward the center follows the path of re absorption.  

Topography of the Temple  

The temple where one performs piija is, first of all, a place on earth where  a divinity may dwell. In this sense, it is homologous with human homes;  both are termed vastu, "dwelling sites." A Saiva temple is a dwelling for  Siva. Siva resides there in the linga, the lord (Jsvara) of the manor. But Siva  is not the only divinity to live there.  

As Lord of the Cosmos (visveivara) and Ruler over all other gods (de vadevesa), Siva is typically surrounded by hosts of gods and assorted other  spirits who act as his attendants, guardians, devotees, and agents. Saiva  texts often envision the Himalayan mountains, where Siva sits in state, as  the scene in which the various agamas were first taught.  

That most excellent mountain, the pleasing, sweet-caverned Mandara was fre quented by all the eighteen groups of beings: by gods, titans, celestial musicians,  demons, and troops of divine women, by Yak$as, fiends, snake-lords, spirits,  ghosts, and ghouls, by Mothers and dwarves, by sprites and eagles, by Vidya dharas as well as by centaurs and sages It was filled with various herds of  animals, such as rutting elephants, lions, bears, deer, and monkeys, all free of  hostility. And there the moon-crested lord Siva, husband of Uma and lord of all  the gods, sat on his divine throne made up of the four throne-powers beginning  with Dhanna. Brahman, Indra, Kubera, Suiya, Candra, Varuna, Yama, and  Vayu, the Vasus, the Adityas, and the Rudras—all the gods were honoring him.  Visnu approached him respectfully, and asked the Teacher of the World a question.  (AA 1.1-10)  

The discourse with which Siva answers Visnu's inquiry is the first revelation  of the teaching handed down to us as the Ajitagama.  

In such assemblies of Siva's court, deities who appear in the teachings of  other schools as independent high gods are incorporated and hierarchized.  They observe the etiquette of the subjugated: they bow, they wait with  folded hands, and they sing the praises of their superior. In Saiva agamas,  they are classified most generally as adhikdrins, "agents" whom Siva em-

62 · Chapter Two    

ploys to carry out his various lordly activities. Ten of them (including many  of those listed as auditors on Mandara Mountain) act, under Siva's order, as  "World Guardians" (Iokapala) protecting the world in all eight cardinal and  intermediate directions as well as above and below. In this way, these other  divinities participate in Siva's sovereignty, but in a subordinate and dutiful  fashion. Siva alone is autonomous; all other gods, lords of encompassed  domains, are dependent upon his command.  

As in these mountain scenes, gods throng the ritually constructed dwell ings of Siva, which are themselves often compared to Mandara, Kailasa,  and other preeminent mountains. From the very first, they live in the vastu mandala, a diagram employed as a ground plan when constructing the tem ple.13 They cover the outer walls of the temple. They inhabit their own  subsidiary shrines arrayed in the courtyards surrounding the main shrine  and its sivalinga. A Saiva temple complex is permeated not just by the pres ence of Siva, but by all the beings who accompany him and share in his  sovereignty.  

The gods do not dispose themselves randomly around the temple, like the  "wild mob" Western visitors to Indian temples have sometimes seen.14 In  the world of Siva, location is too important to leave to chance. The temple  complex forms a structure of hierarchically ordered spaces, and Saiva texts  carefully prescribe which divinities should occupy which positions. As in  the court of a human king, subordinates must arrange themselves around  their overlord in a definite and determinate order, expressive of their politi 

cal relations of respective inferiority and superiority. For this reason the  Saiva temple, viewed as a community of divinities, acts as a topography of  Siva's cosmic lordship.15  

At the emanating center of the temple complex is the linga, Siva's "mark"  (,IiAga), a smooth, cylindrical shaft set in a pedestal (pitha) identified with  Sakti. This is the primary icon of the temple, for Siva in his highest form  inhabits it. Significantly, the linga is nonpartite, undifferentiated (niskala) in  form, in contrast to anthropomorphic images, which are differentiated  (,sakala). Not only does this icon occupy the geographical center of the cen tral shrine, but it is also considered to be, in some sense, the generative  source of the entire temple complex. As the Ajitagama puts it, "During re 

absorption, all beings are reabsorbed (Iaya) into it, and [during emission]  they emanate out from it—for that reason it is called liii-ga. AVhen that linga  is worshiped, all the gods are worshiped" (AA kriya 3.17-18).  

The linga in its pedestal resides in the "womb-room" (garbhagrha), which  in turn is the innermost chamber of the "root-temple" (mHlaprasada), the  primary structure of the complex. This central shrine serves, in the architec tural prescriptions of the agamas and related texts, as the reference point for  all else. Other structures are located prescribed distances from this center  and are sized in proportion to it.  

From the central icon, the structure extends in the four directions and 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe - 63    

upward as well, creating the familiar pyramidal form of the Hindu temple.  On the outer walls of the shrine, manifest gods appear, as if emerging from  the walls in every direction. Here the worshiper may see Siva in his more  anthropomorphic aspects and other important divinities who are part of his  court.  

At each level of the temple, [the temple architect] should place divinities in the  cardinal directions, in due order. One should locate the two door-guardians Nan din and Mahakala to the east, Daksinamiirti [Siva as teacher] to the south, Visnu  or else the Lingodbhava form to the west, and Brahman to the north [on the first  level] One should place Indra or Skanda in the east, Vlirabhadra [an angry  emanation of Siva] would be in the south, the Man-lion incarnation of Visnu to the  west, and Brahman the creator or Kubera the giver of wealth on the second level.  On the third level is the host of Maruts. At every level one should place addi 

tional gods, siddhas, celestial musicians, and preeminent sages, such that there  be sixteen manifest images (pratima) at each. (MM 19.39-46)  

Mayamata's prescriptions for locating deities here correspond particularly  to the Cola-period Saiva temples of the late tenth and eleventh centuries.  One or as many as five courtyards and protecting walls (prakara) sur round and enclose the central shrine. The term prakara designates the wall,  and also by extension the interior space defined by that wall. According to  Mayamata, these outer courtyards and walls serve three functions: they pro tect the main temple, embellish it, and serve as dwelling places for Siva's  attendant divinities (parivaradevata) (MM 23.1). Throughout the court yards small shrines, mirroring the central one but on a diminished scale,  face the primary temple. And in them, occupying partite images, reside the  attendant deities who form Siva's outside entourages (bahyavarana) Or these  minions may be placed in the cloister against the prakara walls, so as to  face the main shrine.  

The number of attendants may vary according to the grandeur of the com plex. For Mayamata, "those who are knowledgeable in the Mstras say that  there should be eight attendants, or twelve, or sixteen, or even thirty-two  attendants" (MM 23.36-37), and the text goes on to state that one wall and  eight attendants only are recommended for modest temples. For larger  structures, Ajitagama specifies that the entourages increase in number as  they proceed outward: eight attendants in the "inner circle" (antarmandala),  sixteen in the "inner garland" (antarhara) or second enclosure, and thirty two in the "middle garland" (madhyahara), the third surround (AA 39.1-3).  As the groups become more differentiated, they decrease in stature. Among  Siva's inner circle of attendants are his family members (GaneSa, Skanda),  his most devoted followers (Nandin, Canda), and divinities who have their  own substantial followings (Brahman, Visnu, DurgS). In the second entou rage, the eight World Guardians—the once-powerful Vedic deities now em ployed to watch over the directions—are joined by a mixed group of eight64 · Chapter Two    

more attendants, including human sages, the consorts of Brahman and Vi§nu,  and others. The third courtyard contains four groups of eight divinities: the  eight Vasus, the eight Maruts, the eight Mahanagas, and the eight Pra mathas. While Ajitagama does give these lesser gods individual names,  it must be admitted that they are rather insignificant members of Siva's  assembly.16  

The topography of divinity established in the Saiva temple complex sug gests radiating projection, outward from a central undifferentiated unity,  gradually becoming more and more particularized as it extends toward the  periphery. From the nonpartite linga, anthropomorphic or partite images in  increasing numbers and decreasing importance seem to proceed. Yet despite  the appearance of emanation from a central point, it is important to remem ber, these attendant deities are not portrayed in Saiva siddhanta theology  merely as projections of Siva's being. Siva is not the material cause of these  other divinities, as monist schools might contend. Rather, they are distinct  beings who recognize Siva's overlordship and participate in his sovereignty  by acting as his agents. What emanates through the temple, in the siddhanta  view, is Siva's lordship (aiivarya); what brings these other deities to be  present in the Saiva temple is their shared, hierarchized participation in  his rule.  

Bathing Pots and diva's Entourages  

Daily worship does not call for an elaborate reconstitution of the temple, as  it calls for the worshiper to reconstruct his own body. The priest does offer  a brief vastupUja ("worship of the site") upon entering the temple, which  recapitulates in abbreviated form the much more elaborate vdstupuja per formed during the establishment of the temple. He must also purify the  place of worship (sthanaiuddhi) as one of the five purifications, but this too  is a relatively simple procedure aimed primarily at protecting the ritual ter 

rain from intruders. For the most part, the priest takes the temple as a given,  a structure within which he moves and acts.  

Yet there are other ritual spaces that the worshiper must create anew dur ing nityapiija. When he sets up pots of water for anointing the image  (iabhifeka) later, he carefully prepares a large flat surface, draws a diagram  on it, fills the diagram with water-pots in a specified order, and then invokes  a deity into each container. The resulting array of divinely infused pottery  is a temporary ritual construct, created and used by the worshiper in his  bathing of the deity. Similarly, when offering services to Siva, he builds  another temporary ritual structure, using visualization (bhavana) rather than  material substances. The worshiper visualizes five "entourages" (avarana) or  circles of deities around Siva and offers worship to each one. Siva is imag 

ined as the divine lord surrounded by a royal court of lesser divinities in  attendance on him 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe · 65  

The Kamikagama describes the consecration of pots in considerable de tail.17 In an auspicious part of the pillared hall, the priest clears a space,  smearing it with cow dung and other purifying substances and imposing  mantras onto the space. He then constructs a diagram, beginning with the  central square. The text relates methods of construction for diagrams con taining 5, 9, 25, 49, 108, 208, 508, and 1,008 spaces. The larger diagrams  are more appropriate for the more elaborate, occasional rituals; for daily  worship, 25 pots should be used, or as many as 108 pots if the temple is  offering the "highest among high" type of worship. The resulting diagrams  always appear as symmetrical projections from a center, expanding outward  in every direction. (See Figure 5.)18

The worshiper then places water-pots in the spaces of the diagram and  begins to fill them. First he fills the "Siva-pot" (Sivakumbha) in the central  square, using from four to forty quarts of water. He next fills the "Sakti-pot"  (vardhant) with half the amount used in the Siva-pot and places it in the  central square to the left of the Siva-pot. Then he proceeds outward, follow 

ing a circumambulatory order within each concentric circuit of squares, fill ing the remaining pots with one to four quarts of water. The priest must also  place a variety of substances in the pots, including jewels in the two central  ones, and properly dress the pots of Siva and Sakti.19  

When the pots have been prepared, he invokes deities into them. He be gins with the central Siva-pot and performs in condensed form the rite of  invocation that he will later use to bring Siva into the linga. He does the same  with the Sakti-pot, and then, proceeding outward again, he invokes deities  into all the peripheral pots.20  

The pots of Siva and Sakti must always be placed in the central space, as  the Siva linga and Sakti pedestal always occupy the conceptual center of the  temple. And as the surrounding deities of the temple, here too the other  deities are "agents" (adhikarin) of Siva, appointed by him to exercise all his  activities within some specific domain. Consequently, the lesser deities are  placed in the outer circuits surrounding Siva, their specific location indica 

tive of their inferior degree of competence and power. However, the identi ties of these lords are not entirely parallel to those of the divinities of the  temple.  

In the innermost circuit are placed most often the eight Vidyesvaras, pure  beings who are assigned by Siva to reign over the entire impure domain.  They are the first and most direct agents delegated to carry out Siva's com mands. In the next circuit are invoked groups of eight MurtTsvaras and eight  Rudras, manifest forms that Siva assumes from time to time to accomplish  particular purposes. Other groups, including Siva's family group (the Gane Svaras), occupy more peripheral positions. Proceeding outward from the  center, the deities become less pure, more limited in their dominion, and  lower in the order of emission. The resulting ritual structure again looks like  a map of Siva's dominion: an encompassing Siva in the center, and an in creasingly differentiated group of his agents near the periphery. This map ping differs from the topography of the temple in the identities of the lords,  but not in the principle by which they are arranged.  

As the worshiper invokes these deities into the pots, he enacts the emis sion of Siva's sovereignty. At every stage of the process—tracing the dia gram, placing the pots, filling them, and invoking deities into them—he  moves from the center outward. He treats the pots in accord with their  status, filling the central pots with the most water and the finest substances.  When he later uses these pots to bathe the linga, he follows the same order,  beginning with the pots of Siva and Sakti and continuing through each sue-

ceeding circuit of pots (RA 1 p. 96). He thereby inundates the linga with the  whole extent of Siva's sovereignty, embodied in the bathing pots.  Similarly in the rite of the entourages, the worshiper follows the pattern ing of temple topography. Here the worshiper must imagine 6iva seated at  the center of a royal court made up of one, three, or five groups of deities  in attendance. He visualizes each deity according to an appropriate medita tion verse, invokes the deity into this mentally constructed form, and then  worships it with all the proper offerings. If the deities in subsidiary shrines  outside the sanctum constitute diva's "exterior entourages," the envisioned  divinities here make up his "interior entourages" (antaravarana), the court  within. In both, the attending divinities are located in a series of concentric  circles facing the central linga.  

Once again, the entourages are located in an order of priority with respect  to the center. (See Figure 6.) In the innermost circle, termed the garbha vararia ("womb-entourage"), the worshiper visualizes the brahmamantras  and the angamantras, direct emanations of Siva's own body. The divinities  of this interior entourage, the Kamikagama tells us, "are to be drawn out 

68 • Chapter Two    

(finetavya) from Siva, [the brahmamantras] from his chest etc., and [the  angamantras] from his heart etc." (KA 4.456). The worshiper places the  VidyeSvaras in the second entourage. In the third are found the Ganesvaras,  "Lords of the Troops," a group of divinities best described as forming  Siva's household: his wife, Ambika; his sons, GapeSa and Skanda; his  mount, Vrsa; his favored devotees, Canda, Bhmgin, and Nandin; and his  primary guardian, Mahakala. Next he places the World Guardians  (Iokapdlas) in the fourth entourage: Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna,  Vayu, Kubera, and ISana. Assigned to the protection of the ten directions of  this world, the World Guardians are lower in rank than the VidyeSvaras,  whose domain extends over all the impure worlds. Finally, the outermost  entourage contains the weapons (ayudha) that the World Guardians bear:  Indra's thunderbolt stands in the east, Agni's spear in the southeast, and so  on. As in a human royal court, those whose duty it is to protect the atten dants of the court are stationed at its outer perimeter.  

As the worshiper moves out from the center, following the path of emis sion, the deities that he visualizes become more particularized, more indi viduated. Kamikagama gives a single description for visualizing all the  brahmamantras: they are "five-faced, ten-armed, wearing crowns adorned  with the moon, and carrying excellent weapons" (KA 4.450-51). Similarly,  a single composite description serves for all the angamantras, and another  for the VidyeSvaras. But in the third entourage, the worshiper must visual ize each of the GarteSvaras as an individual, distinctive deity. The World  Guardians and their weapons are also differentiated, each from the other,  and the worshiper visualizes each one distinctively. The deities also become  less like Siva away from the center. Brahmamantras and angamantras all  have five faces and ten arms as SadaSiva has. The VidyeSvaras have "ten  arms like Siva" but just four faces, and in the outer entourages deities tend  to have just one face and two arms. The GaneSvaras are distinguished from  the World Guardians by their third eyes; only ISvara (i.e., Siva) among the  World Guardians shares this Siva-like trait.  

After they have been invoked in this way, the entourages of Siva's court  must be treated with due hospitality. During the services of worship, the  worshiper feeds and makes other offerings to each of these deities, in proper  hierarchical order beginning with Siva at the center and proceeding out ward. And then, at the close of worship, the divine attendants must be dis 

missed. The worshiper, says K&mikagama, "makes the gods surrounding  the linga get up with ASTRA and the mudra of reabsorption, and joins them  such that they are united in the embodied form, using the MORTI mantra"  (KA 4.518-19). The entourages are once again reabsorbed into the central  figure of Siva.  

The rites of the bathing pots and of the entourages create spaces that are  geometrically distinct but conceptually parallel. In both, the worshiper con-

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe · 69    

structs ritual diagrams consisting of an array of deities located in concentric  order around Siva. They are arranged in an order of priority, with those who  are most like Siva (in purity, in domain of rule, in visible form, and so on)  placed closest to the center. The worshiper successively invokes the deities,  following the path of emission. The deities are, in fact, emissaries of the  encompassing lord Siva—subordinate sharers in his sovereignty and atten 

dants at his divine court. They are "drawn out" from Siva, and after enjoy ing a brief period of independent embodiment, they are rejoined into Siva.  The organization of the temple and its divinities serves as the paradigm  for these other, ritually created structures of divinity. Yet the priest during  puja does not simply re-create the map of Siva's lordship substantiated in  the stone and metal images of the temple complex. Rather, he creates new  topographies that involve the participation of other powers and divinities as  well. While the agents in each case differ, the logic of their placement does  not. Temple, bathing pots, and visualized court all portray Siva's sover eignty as an emanation outward from the center, creating a concentric hier archy of spaces that other sharers in Siva's lordship inhabit in accord with  their status and dominion.  

Ritual Movements in Space  

A priest must move physically within the temple during the course of wor ship, and the central deity in a sense does also. Their movements are in formed by the same logic of emission and reabsorption that governs the  more static dispositions of divinities stationed within the temple complex.  

The temple, as we have seen, is an emanated structure, unfolding from its  center, and space within the temple is organized as a concentric hierarchy,  with the most exalted areas located at or nearest the center. To approach the  preeminent deity in the linga, the worshiper necessarily begins outside the  temple walls and gradually approaches the inner sanctum, moving from the  periphery to the center of the ritual space. Hence he follows the order of  reabsorption. His movement within the temple goes contrary to the move ment by which the temple has been emitted, returning as it were to its  source.  

Not everyone can accomplish this approach. Only those persons who are  qualified, within the Saiva hierarchy of spiritual attainment, may enter the  most sacred precincts of the temple. The agamas make specific provisions  concerning who may and may not perform temple worship on behalf of  others. "Worship on behalf of others must always be done by a Saiva brahmana. A pious adiiaiva, best among the brahmans, does worship regu 

larly, but if others should perform worship other than for their own behalf  alone, the worshipers will be destroyed" (KA 4.6-7). One criterion is that of  birth: a priest must be born as a brahman, and moreover in one of the five 

70 · Chapter Two    

HdiSaiva ("primary Saiva") or Saiva-brahmana clans.21 Other brahmans are  disqualified.  

Those who are born from Brahman's mouth but without diva's emission [i.e.,  brahmans not of the five adiiaiva clans] are common brahmans. They are not  competent to offer worship for others. If by some mistake they do, king and  country will be destroyed. If those common brahmans worship Siva for hire, they  will be ruined within six months. Therefore one should avoid them. (KA 4.7-9)  

Not only must a priest be born in the proper brahmanic clan, but he must  also be qualified ritually. Only a member of the Saiva community who has  undergone both liberating initiation (nirvanadiksa) and a priestly anointment  (dcaryabhi§eka) may act suitably as temple priest, worshiping on behalf of  the community. "No stain attaches to worship undertaken for others' benefit  that is offered by an intelligent Saiva-brahmana who has received initiation  and anointment, since he will be obedient to the order of Siva" (KA 4.10).  The two rituals necessary to priestly competence, as I describe in the next  chapter, transform the condition of the initiate's soul so that it is similar to  Siva, and then imbue him with the lordly powers of Siva. In other words,  only one who has been made into a virtual Siva himself may approach Siva  in his highest form, embodied in the linga, to offer worship on behalf of  others.  

Other texts, such as the Suprabhedagama and Ramakantha's Jatinirnaya purvakalayapraveiavidhi, suggest a more far-reaching relationship of tem ple space to human access. A series of gradations of purity within the tem ple as an emanated space correspond to gradations of capacity to approach  

the center among various categories of Saiva worshipers.  

Saiva-brahmana priests worship in the garbhagrha. Initiated non-adiiaiva brah mans worship in the entry-passage (antamla). Common brahmans reciting the  Vedas worship in the fore-pavilion (ardhamandapa). Sacrificers, ascetics, and re nounces worship in the main pavilion (mukhamandapa). Kings [i.e., k$atriyas] and  vaiiya& worship in the door pavilion (dvaramandapa). Siidras who have received  liberating initiation worship in the outer pavilion. Siidras who have received  common initiation worship in the dance pavilion. And initiates of other castes  should worship at the door of the entry-tower (gopura).22  

And these limits on entry are not to be transgressed, Samakantha tells us, for  there are stiff consequences.  

The one who, out of perversity, leaves his own place and goes [too far into the  temple], although he has been told not to, will certainly go to hell, tossed there  by Siva. And even if one goes too far out of ignorance, there will nevertheless be  some disturbance in the kingdom.23  

Earlier I showed that the mumuksu, the seeker of liberation, characteristi cally follows the path of reabsorption in his guiding aim and in his ritual 

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe 71    

action, while the bubhuksu treads the path of emission in ritual and in every day aspiration. Here the distances that different Saivas have traversed on the  spiritual path of reabsorption reappear, indexed topographically by the ex tent to which they are judged suitable to approach the central icon of the  shrine, along the temple path of reabsorption.  

Corresponding to these hierarchies of spaces and persons, Ramakantha  points out, is a hierarchy of texts. The worship performed in the sanctum by  adiiaiva brahmans employs the Saiva agamas and their distinctive Saiva  mantras as primary text. Common brahmans reciting the Vedas and their  Vedic mantras are stationed farther out from the center, in the fore-pavilion.  And good siidras are authorized to recite the Tamil hymns (dravidastotra),  the devotional praise poems composed by the Tamil nayanmar saints, in the  great pavilion, still farther from the center that is Siva himself (JNP 29-35).  

Priestly qualifications alone are not sufficient to allow a worshiper to pen etrate into the central sanctum. As the priest moves from outside the temple  toward the central linga, he must also transform his own state of being. Be fore entering the temple, the worshiper first reaches a state of personal pu rity through performing his daily ablutions and bath. Such bathing, Mrgen dragama tells us, engenders the capacity to undertake auspicious rituals like  

pUja (MrA kriya 2.1). He then enters into its outer precincts, offering wor ship to the various deities who inhabit the door frame and protecting the  temple against "intruders" (yighna). Next he must transform himself with a  more thoroughgoing purification and the construction of a divine body, as  we have seen. Only then may the priest enter the central abode of the linga,  again worshiping the deities of the sanctum's door frame and protecting it  against intruders as he enters.  

The worshiper thus reaches the linga and also transforms his body into one  similar to Siva. But worship cannot take place until Siva is induced into  approaching and entering the linga. For Siva, this requires a descent into  form, from the unmanifest into manifestation. The worshiper visualizes an  elaborate throne for Siva and then prepares for him an "embodied form"  (miirti) to reside in. Finally he invokes Siva into this form, and the services  of worship may commence. (This procedure will be described in detail in  Chapter 4.)  

Two approaches from different directions meet in the act of worship. The  worshiper follows the path of reabsorption toward the center of the temple,  congruent with the transformation of his body. Siva follows the path of  emission by descending from his absolute state into the visualized form that  the worshiper has constructed for him. The temple is the ritual terrain upon  which both these approaches may occur, and the sanctum the place in which  they may meet.  

Even though only properly consecrated Saiva priests are eligible to enter  the sanctum in temple worship, others do gain access to Siva at one point  during worship. Extending his descent into form, Siva regularly ventures 

72 · Chapter TWo    

forth from the garbhagrha to tour the temple domain of which he is lord.  Siva makes such a "procession" (yatra) daily as part of a "daily festival"  (nityotsava), and much more dramatically during the occasional "great festi vals" (mahotsava) celebrated at prescribed times during the year. He does  so, says the Karanagama, to benefit all beings: "for those rogues, birds, and  

animals who are not initiated, as well as for initiates and devotees."24  To make his daily tour, Siva enters a special mobile image placed on an  ornamented palanquin. Temple attendants take the litter on their heads and  proceed out from the center. Siva takes along the accoutrements of his lord ship, such as canopy, parasol, and chowrey-fans, and he is accompanied on  his rounds by a processional throng of musicians, singers, dancers, priests,  and devotees. In larger processions, other deities of Siva's court might also  accompany him, each embodied in its own image and carried on its own  palanquin. Siva and his retinue typically make three circumambulations: the  first circling the main shrine, the second visiting each of the subordinate  deities of the exterior entourages, and the third going still farther afield to  circle the outer walls of the temple or even parade through the town. Then  they return from the peripheries to the sanctum, and Siva resumes his cus tomary position, where he is once again worshiped by the priest.  According to the Karanagama definition, the festival (utsava) of Siva's  procession is an "emission outward" (udbhutasrfti).25 Siva's movement here  follows the path of emission in several senses. In space he proceeds from  the center to the outer precincts of the ritual terrain. In form he transfers his  presence, most often, from the immobile, undifferentiated "root" linga to a  portable, differentiated image (pratima) representing Siva in manifest as pect. And, most important, as he visits those subordinate deities with whom  he shares lordship, he also emanates his lordship, extending his grace out ward to the larger community, for whom, due to birth or insufficient ritual  preparation, entry into the central shrine is proscribed.  

THE RITUAL WORLD AND THE "REAL" WORLD  

The Saiva cosmogonic vision of an oscillating universe finds itself reflected  in the patterned actions of ritual. The paired dynamics of emission and reab sorption govern everything, it would seem, from the disposition of divini ties in the temple complex to the order in which a worshiper should impose  mantras onto his fingers. The worshiper's hands, his body, his movements  in the temple, and even Siva's movements all follow a common logic,  which Saivas would claim is the basic organizing logic of the manifest cos mos itself.  

All this certainly evokes the notion, familiar to all historians of religion,  of interrelated macrocosmos and microcosmos. The Saiva worshiper's repe tition of certain cosmological principles, graphing them onto diverse por-

Oscillation in the Ritual Universe * 73    

tions of a ritual domain set apart from eveiyday life, suggests that Saiva  ritual is an attempt to construct a microcosm reflecting a particular macro cosmic conception of the way things are.  

While the use of such a model as a convenient shorthand to comprehend  Saiva ritual is not erroneous as such, it does suggest a misconception, at  least insofar as the Saiva self-understanding goes. It implies that the world  constructed and acted upon within ritual is a representation of a larger and  distinct world, and that the ritual world, as a symbolic construct or a reflec 

tion, exists at a lower order of ontological reality. To suppose that Saiva  ritual "mirrors" microcosmically a real world that exists apart from it, how ever, would seriously misconstrue the Saivas' basically realistic and integral  sense of what they are doing. Other metaphors of mimesis implying a sepa ration of real and ritual domains, such as "play," "theater," and the like, are  equally misleading. To put it as directly as possible: Saiva daily worship is  understood to be real action, employing real forces, directed at real recipi ents, and accomplishing real effects. Ritual is not a metaphor for Saiva cos mology, for it participates in that same world.  

Since Siva is all-pervading, it should not be surprising that the universe  revealed through Saiva knowledge and acted within during ritual appears  multiply embedded within itself, rather like the computer images generated  by fractal geometrists. Siva's determining activities of emission and reab sorption, as we have seen, reproduce themselves at various scales, so that  the worshiper's hand, his body, a pot diagram, a temple layout, and much  more all appear to be projections of the same universal dynamic.  

If anything, the ritual world holds a privileged ontological status for the  Saivas, in much the same way that the knowledge revealed in Saiva texts  promotes itself as a privileged episteme. As we have seen, Saiva knowledge  claims to reveal a normally hidden, and more fundamental, order of things  existing within the world, underlying and determining the phenomenal  world ordinarily accessible to our powers of knowing. These two types of  knowledge—Saiva knowledge and ordinary knowledge—are not directed at  distinct domains, but rather are two levels of apprehension of a single com plex world, the first more penetrating and encompassing than the other.  Saiva ritual bears an analogous relation to ordinary, worldly action: it is  efficacious action based on the underlying principles of organization of the  world, the axiomatic forces revealed by Saiva philosophical texts.  

For this reason, too, ritual discloses knowledge through action, in a con densed, reiterative, and compelling way. The ritual world is a synecdoche  by which one may be able to perceive more immediately, with less interfer ence, the fuller state of things. (So too, although Siva is all-pervasive, the  agamas assert that he becomes "specially present" in the ritual terrain dur ing daily worship.) The worshiper is called upon to focus, over and over,  day after day, on the primary principles of the Saiva world as he acts with74 · Chapter Two    

and through them in ritual. What he sees, directly, as they animate his own  actions, are the multiple projections—theoretically infinite, since perva sive—of the cosmological and theological foundations of the single world,  Siva's world.

## 3 Becoming a Siva  

THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL for the Saivite, as for adherents of many other  Hindu systems of thought, is to attain mok$a ("final liberation"), the highest  state of being that can be achieved by the human soul. For Saiva philoso phy, the central drama of the cosmos is that of the human soul, immersed in  a state of bondage, moving gradually toward moksa through diva's grace.  All else revolves around this. The entire oscillating universe, say the texts,  is emitted and reabsorbed just to facilitate the soul's progress toward libera tion. All of diva's five fundamental activities are oriented to enabling the  soul to attain liberation. As Mrgendragama asserts, "the soul is the reason  for everything" (MrA vidya 6.7).  

The Saivas define moksa precisely as the process or event by which the  soul is released from its bondage and becomes a Siva. When one attains  liberation, they say, the soul becomes completely equal to Siva. It acquires  a form identical to that of Siva. A liberated soul does not merge into the  divinity or become united with him, as some other systems of Hindu philos 

ophy assert. Nor does it enter again into the manifest cosmos. Rather, it  remains as an autonomous theomorphic entity, separate from Siva but with  all his powers and qualities. In this sense, the end point of the soul's "ca 

reer," its final and most desirable destination, is to become a Siva.  In the preceding chapter, I described how the worshiper "becomes a Siva"  within the ritual setting. The transformation that the ritualist performs on his  own body, reconstituting it as a "divine body" by means of atmasuddhi, is  a crucial part of daily worship. This "purification" is necessary to render the  worshiper fit for performing services to Siva, since "only a Siva can worship  Siva." In this chapter I relocate the bodily transformation that the ritualist  performs daily in his worship in a broader soteriological framework, that of  the soul's ultimate attainment of mok$a.  

This chapter is an account of the human soul's religious passage from its  beginning condition of bondage to the attainment of liberation, and of the  crucial role ritual action plays in this passage. Rituals such as initiation and  daily worship have significant effects on the person who performs them,  effects that contribute critically to the liberation of his soul. In fact, the  performance of these rituals, according to Saiva soteriology, is the most  direct means for the soul to gain liberation. At the same time, I will argue,  the worshiper enacts the movement to mok$a within these rituals. Becoming  a Siva temporarily in daily worship is identical in form to becoming a Siva  permanently through final liberation.84 · Chapter Three    

THE CAREER OF A SOUL  

The normal human condition is not, in the view of the Saivas, a happy one.  While Siva is teaching them the Kamikagama, the sages interrupt his dis course to state their opinion of worldly life: " Ό Lord, in this world living  creatures have weak natures and short lives; they are filled with greed, delu sion, conceit, passion, and hostility'" (KA 3.12-13). This pessimistic ob servation provides a starting place for an inquiry into the ultimate source of  and cure for the predicament in which most humans find themselves. If  these most eminent sages complain of their lot, how much more so should  the rest of us, living our lives outside Siva's grace.  

Bondage and Liberation  

Saiva texts describe the normal human condition as a state of bondage  (bandhatva). A human being is categorized as a pasu, a term used to desig nate the transmigrating soul (dtman) in the condition of bondage.  

It is important to remember that the subject of bondage here is the soul,  not the empirical human "person." Saiva philosophy maintains a sharp onto logical distinction between the soul and the other constituents that combine  with the soul to make up the person. The soul is the nonmaterial locus of a  person; it possesses consciousness (cit), which is the animating spirit of  every living entity. The material body, the organs of perception and action,  the ego, and the faculties of cognition and decision are considered inani 

mate substances (jada), requiring some animating force to act upon them.  The animate soul inhabits an inanimate body and with its powers of con sciousness directs all bodily activities. The soul is bound; all other constitu 

ents of the person are forms of bondage acting upon the soul.  This state of bondage, though it is the only human situation most of us  know, is not inevitable. To speak of bondage implies at least the possibility  of freedom. In fact, say the texts, the inherent condition of the soul is far  different from the plight in which we normally see it. The soul in its innate  form (svariipa) is like Siva himself; it is characterized by sivatva ("Siva ness"). Like Siva, each individual soul is endowed with consciousness, the  animating energy that distinguishes it from all that is inanimate. By virtue  of its consciousness the soul has vast powers of knowing and acting,  amounting to omniscience and omnipotence (sarvajMnakriyaiakti). The  soul is inherently pervading (vyapaka), eternal (nitya), and autonomous  (svatantrya). These characteristics make the soul fully equal to Siva—or  would make it so, that is, if not for the interference of the fetters. From its  very beginning, the human soul has been tethered by the snares of bondage,  which overcome its inherent powers.  

Because the condition of bondage is not intrinsic to the human soul, but  is imposed on it by extrinsic fetters, it is possible for the soul to gain libera-

Becoming a Siva - 85    

tion from its predicament. The soul itself cannot be altered, since it is im mutable. Nor would one wish to change it, since it is inherently like Siva.  Liberating the soul is a matter of transforming its condition or situation, not  its essence. To do so, one must uncover the soul's immanent Siva-ness by  eliminating all the fetters that cover it.1  

Accordingly, Saivas portray the passage from bondage to liberation in  terms of removal and emergence: removal of that which suppresses the soul,  and emergence of its immanent but concealed qualities. The fetters must  first be removed (apanita) or eliminated (nivrtta); their hold over the soul  must be loosened (vislisfa) or severed (chinna). Fetters are tenacious, but ulti mately they can be eliminated. When the soul has been extricated from its  fetters, its own inherent qualities are able to emerge (vyakti). "As soon as  the bondage caused by fetters such as ignorance ceases," comments  NarayanakanJha, "the Sivatva of the soul becomes manifest" {MrAVvidya 6.7).  The two events are linked: removing the fetters enables the soul's intrinsic  powers to emerge, just as the elimination of a disease allows the body to  recover its normal capabilities.  

The category of moksa as an end point to the religious striving of the  human soul is of course common to most schools of Indian philosophy. But,  as Narayanakantha avers, the Saiva conception of moksa as attainment of Siva ness differs conspicuously from the "so-called liberations" of other schools,  which may consist of a reabsorption of the soul into Brahman, as Advaita  Vedantins claim, or the discrimination of prakrti and puru$a, as the Samkhya  school contends (MrAV vidya 2.29). Even among the Saiva schools that ac 

cept equality with Siva as the highest goal, the Saiva siddhanta position is  distinct from others in postulating an inherent Siva-ness that is recovered at  the moment of liberation. Sivagrayogin terms this model of attaining libera tion "equality through manifestation" (vyakti). Among other Saiva schools,  he tells us, the Mahavratins hold that the soul's equality with Siva comes  

about through an origination (utpatti) at the time of liberation, the PaSupatas  view this equality as arising through a transfer (samkranti) from Siva, and  the Kapalikas argue that it occurs through possession (samdvesa) of the soul  by Siva (SPbh pp. 341-43).  

For Saiva siddhanta, the long-term career of a soul consists in its gradual  movement from a state of bondage, enmeshed in a multitude of fetters, to  one of liberation. A movement in the opposite direction, deeper into bond age, is of course possible, but is not much discussed by Saiva texts. They  assume that no right-thinking person would consciously pursue such a  course. In liberation a double transformation of the soul's condition takes  place: the fetters that constrain it are completely eliminated, and its inherent  "Siva-ness" fully emerges. This alteration constitutes "becoming a Siva" in  the broadest sense. Achieving final liberation means, precisely, that the soul  leaves behind its previous bondage and attains a permanent state parallel to  that of Siva. 

86 • Chapter Three    

Fetters and Their Ripening  

Clearly fetters and their removal are the crux of the matter of liberation.  Any progress on the path to mok$a must involve elimination of these binding  forces.  

According to Saiva siddhanta, the human soul is bound by three primary  categories of fetters: mala, karman, and maya? The Saivas understand  these three as distinct realities, each with its own individual effects on the  soul and its own characteristic pattern of evolution or "transformation"  (parinama).3  

Of the three fetters, the most ubiquitous and tenacious is mala, primordial  stain. Mala, identified with constraint and obscuration, is the fetter most  responsible for suppressing the soul's capacities. Synonyms for mala in clude "darkness," "stupor," "covering," "debility," and "night"—indicating  its general quality as a dark, oppressive fetter (MrA vidya 7.7). Arising con currently with the soul, mala is the first fetter to adhere to it and the last to  leave. In Bhojadeva's analogy, mala sticks to the soul from the soul's in ception as a husk develops simultaneously with a grain of rice, and as tar nish with a copper pot. However, comments AghoraSiva1 just as the husk is  broken off when the grain within has matured, and the tarnish may be wiped  off a pot using chemicals, so mala can be removed from the soul through  ripening and initiation (TPV 18).  

Mala evolves through a process of "ripening" (paka). The term paka in  common usage signifies processes in which the qualities of substances are  modified due to some "heating" agency external to that which is modified:  cooking, digesting of food, baking of bricks, ripening of fruits. Most often  this results in a softening or loosening of the substance heated, as with  boiled rice or ripened bananas. The texts do not specify exactly what is  meant by the ripening of mala, but paka does denote a process by which  mala's grasp on the soul is gradually loosened or weakened (ksina).4  

Among worldly beings, conditions of superiority and inferiority are recognized  as [indexes of] their mala. Just like rice that is first raw then cooked, so too mala  may be either raw or cooked, depending on the action of samsara. When mala is  raw, a man is inferior; when it is cooked, he is to that degree superior. (SPur  1.31.71-72)  

As mala ripens, its suppression of the soul's powers softens.  The term used for the second fetter, karman, means "action," though in  philosophical usage it covers a still broader field. Along with many other  schools of Indian thought, the Saivas accept an extended concept of causal ity. Every action undertaken by a person engenders a consequence. The  causal relationship between act and result is not simply physical, but moral  as well. A meritorious act gives rise to some beneficial result that sooner or 

Becoming a Siva - 87    

later accrues to the person; conversely, a wicked act produces subsequent  pain. The consequence may ensue immediately or only after several life times of lying dormant, but it is certain to occur eventually. Action and  consequence are linked together in a beginningless "stream" (pravdha), as  

seed and shoot successively and inevitably engender one another.  For Saivas, each action is connected to its results by a substantive "resi due" of the action, which adheres to the actor until it produces its conse quence. These residues, called bhogyakarman ("actions whose conse quences are still to be experienced"), are responsible for binding the soul.  In Saiva philosophy, the term karman denotes these residues as well as the  actions that produce them. The unfulfilled residues of past actions, whether  good or evil, constitute a fetter for the soul precisely because their results  have not yet been experienced.  

Karman is transformed only when one experiences or "consumes"  Cbhoga) the "fruits" (phala) of past acts. The term bhoga, used generally for  eating food or enjoying pleasurable things, here refers to consuming the  fruit that is bhogyakarman. When the soul experiences the consequences of  a past action, the residue is eliminated. Without that experience, however,  the inert residue remains attached to the soul indefinitely. Unconsumed kar 

man transmigrates from one body to the next along with the soul, awaiting  fruition. "Karman that is not consumed," says AghoraSiva, "does not di minish even in a hundred crore of eons" (TPV 36).  

The Saivas (as do other schools of thought) further distinguish three basic  types of karman, according to the time of its genesis and its consumption.5  Most immediate in its effects is prdrabdhakarman,"active karman." Prd rabdhakarman designates that portion of a soul's previously acquired kar man that has brought about its present embodiment and is destined to be  consumed during its present lifetime. The karman of this lifetime is already  activated, literally "karman whose effects have already begun." Less imme diate is sancitakarman, "accumulated karman." This denotes the soul's en tire collection of karman whose effects have not yet begun to manifest  themselves. For most souls, sancitakarman constitutes an enormous stock pile that will furnish the prdrabdhakarman for many lifetimes to come. The  third category of karman is termed dgamin, "future karman." Agamin des ignates karman that has not yet formed, and that is not yet a fetter, because  the action causing it has not yet taken place. The soul will acquire dgamin  in the future due to its future actions. Saivas employ this threefold classi fication of karman extensively in discussing the efficacy of rituals that con tribute to liberation.  

Saiva siddhanta defines mdyd, the third fetter, as the source-substance or  "seed" (Jbija) of the entire manifest cosmos. Narayanakantha defines mdyd  on the basis of its putative morphemes: "Since the entire world is contained  (mdti) there during reabsorption through powers, and it proceeds (ydti) into 

88 · Chapter Three    

manifestation from there during emission, it is called ma-ya" (MrAV vidya  2.7). Maya, according to the Saivas, is real and substantive (vastuta), not  illusory or ephemeral as some other schools contend. The recurring emis sions from and reabsorptions into maya produce the oscillating universe, as  we saw in the previous chapter. Properly speaking, undifferentiated maya  does not itself act as a fetter; rather, it is the thirty-one tattvas derived from  maya that truly bind the soul. When these derivative tattvas are emitted and  enter into combination with each other, they bring about the bodies that  souls inhabit and the worlds in which they live. These /mxya-constructed  bodies and worlds, in turn, provide the structures within which human  pafus experience their bondage.  

Caught up in the complicated fabric of creation, souls are easily led away  from their own best interests. Even though real, maya is nevertheless "de luding" (mohika) because it (or rather, its derivatives) leads the soul to false  ideas, such as considering something impermanent to be permanent, or mis takenly identifying something separate from the soul as integral to the soul  (TPV 39). These erroneous beliefs provide the basis for further misguided  actions, causing the soul to accumulate still more karman. Maya itself is  transformed through the cyclical process of emission, preservation, and re absorption. The delusion generated by maya must be dispelled by correct  knowledge, specifically the sivajnana contained in the agamas.  

The transformative processes of the three fetters are closely linked to one  another. The existence of karman is a precondition for the emission and  reabsorption of maya. If karman does not exist, no evolution of maya will  occur. The transformation of karman through consumption, in turn, de 

pends on the emission of maya. In order for the soul to consume its karman,  some means of experience must be present. Emission of the tattvas derived  from maya facilitates the consumption of karman by producing the bodies  and worlds through which experience takes place. The entire manifest cos 

mos, says Narayanakantha, is emitted just in order that souls can complete  the consumption of their karman (MrAV vidya 6.1).  

Similarly, the existence of mala is the precondition for karman. Mthout  mala there can be no karman. The ripening of mala, in turn, depends on the  consumption of karman. Although the Saivite texts do not spell out the dy namics of this relationship, they clearly suggest that the soul's consumption  of karman induces a ripening of its mala. "During the time of preservation,"  says Aghora£iva, "Siva causes the consumption of some ripened karman, in  order to ripen mala" (TTNV 19). The transformation of karman, that is,  brings about a change in mala as well.  

In this way, the three fetters develop in a connected series. Through the  recurring emissions and reabsorptions of the manifest cosmos out of and  back into maya, the soul is able to consume its karman. The consumption of  its karman causes the soul's mala to ripen. This linked process of evolution 

Becoming a Siva * 89    

does not itself eliminate the fetters. However, it does cause a gradual soften ing or loosening of the fetters' grip, which prepares the soul for subsequent  steps in the movement toward liberation.  

The ultimate agent in this process of fetter transformation is Siva himself.  The two most important of diva's five fundamental activities, concealment  (JirobMva) and grace (anugraha), are precisely directed toward the rela tionship between the human soul and its fetters. Siva sets the fetters in mo tion using his power of concealment. His instigation of the fetters, causing  each to perform its proper role in the scheme of things, acts as a suppressing  power (rodhasakti) on the souls. Through their actions, the fetters conceal  from the soul its own intrinsic qualities.  

At first glance this might seem a remarkably pernicious act for a god the  Saivas characterize as "giver of all grace." Yet in the long run Siva's con cealment is a form of grace to the soul, since it brings about the evolution  of the fetters. Without evolving, fetters could never be removed. Thus,  what might initially appear as an activity detrimental to the soul's welfare  turns out to be highly beneficial, in fact necessary to liberation. In Mfgen dragama, Siva's use of concealment is compared to the doctor's use of un palatable medicine: "A doctor, even though he causes the patient much pain  by administering bitter medicines and the like, is not considered to be the  cause of pain because, in the end, he brings about the desired result" (MrA  vidya 7.18). So Siva's animation of the fetters, which initially causes the  soul to suffer through many births and deaths, ultimately paves the way  toward liberation.  

LIBERATION THROUGH INITIATION  

The soul need not be simply passive in this process of evolving fetters. It  may act to alleviate its own state of bondage. Attending temple services,  listening to the teachings of one's preceptor, and observing proper everyday  conduct are signs that one's fetters have ripened, and they also contribute  significantly to further ripening. As fetters ripen, too, the soul becomes ca 

pable of exercising increasing agency in extricating itself from its predica ment, performing and undergoing increasingly efficacious ritual actions. Fi nally the process of ripening may lead to the most important moment in the  career of a soul: initiation.  

Saivas consider the ritual known as "liberating initiation" (nirvanadiksa)  to be the pivotal event in the soul's movement toward liberation, the ritual  through which the most far-reaching alterations in its condition take place.  Through initiation, the religious aspirant is placed on the only direct route  to achieving liberation during this lifetime. Without initiation, liberation  cannot be reached. "Initiation alone liberates one from the extensive bond 

age impeding the highest goal and leads one upward to Siva's abode" (SvaA 

90 · Chapter TTiree    

quoted in SRS 69). Initiation is Siva's most direct conferring of grace on the  human soul. In fact, so closely are the ritual of liberation and Siva's grace  associated with one another that Saiva texts use the two terms dlksd and  anugraha as synonyms.  

The Fall of Sakti  

Initiation cannot be conferred on all persons. For initiation to accomplish its  far-reaching effects, the subject of the ritual must be ready for it. If his  fetters have not evolved sufficiently and their hold on him therefore remains  too tenacious, then even this most powerful ritual act will be to no avail.  Only when the ripening of fetters has reached its fruition should a person be  given initiation. "When Siva sees that the soul's mala is ripened and ready  for removal," Aghorasiva states, "he prepares the instrument called initia tion, whose form is his own Sakti, in order to liberate that soul" (JTNV 21).  

For this reason, preparations and observation are necessary before undertak ing the ritual.  

Saiva texts often speak of the mysterious process by which a person be comes ready for initiation as the "falling of Sakti" (saktinipata).6 Siva's  own transforming power (sakti) of grace falls upon the novice, gradually or  abruptly as the case may be, altering his condition irrevocably. In order to  judge the readiness of a novice for initiation, the preceptor must watch care fully for indications that Siva's Sakti has indeed fallen upon him.  

Sivagrayogin sets out in detail the sequence of steps by which the fall of  Sakti works its gradual metamorphosis. The process gets underway when  the fetters have sufficiently ripened:  

When a brahman, k$atriya, vaiiya, pure siidra, or one of the anuloma castes such  as suvarna reaches a state where his karman is equable (samya) and his mala  ripened, then the highest Sakti first falls on him. A great faith in the highest  knowledge is then born in him, and he becomes detached (vairagya) by realizing  the faults inherent in attachment to sensory objects and the like. When such de 

tachment arises, he should approach the house of a teacher in order to learn the  highest knowledge. {&Pbh p. 287)  

Ripening leads to an initial falling of Sakti, which in turn brings about some  symptoms of a religious vocation. The pilgrim is well advised to place him self under the charge of an initiated Saiva guru, who will be best able to  evaluate his spiritual condition and capacities. "And from the teacher, who  judges his competence (adhikara) on the basis of his devotion, etc., the  aspirant should receive samayadiksa" (SPbh p. 287). If the pupil shows  the proper signs, the guru enables him to take the first ritual step on the path  

to Siva-hood by conferring on him samayadiksa, "common initiation."  Samayadiksa is the general initiation by which one becomes a member of  the Saiva community. In the central rite of samayadiksa, the preceptor con-

Becoming a Siva · 91    

ducts the blindfolded novice into a specially prepared sacrificial pavilion  and dramatically removes the blindfold so that the initiate is suddenly able  to see Siva's presence. The guru then gives the Saiva initiate a new name.7  Such rites point clearly to the primary effects wrought by samayadiksa: entry  into the world of Siva, awakening to the knowledge and vision of Siva's  presence, and a new identity in the community of Saiva devotees. It is in no  way comparable in transformative power to nirvdnadikfd, and the agamas do  not generally discuss the effects of samayadiksa on fetters. But it does confer  on the recipient the capacity to begin participating actively in Saiva reli gious activities.  

When he has received samayadiksa, he follows the codes of conduct of a common  member (samayin) of the Saiva community: watching after diva's garden, sweep ing Siva's house, gathering flowers and other articles suitable for worshiping  Siva, honoring Siva's devotees, smearing the body with ashes, placing the three  horizontal marks on the forehead, wearing rudraksa, and the like. ($Pbh p. 287)  

Many texts would also prescribe that a common Saiva's duties may also  include performing worship on his own behalf (atmarthapuja), but Siva grayogin reserves that for a later stage of initiation.8  

Through the initiate's performance of duties around the temple, the fall of  Sakti gradually gathers force.  

As he follows the common duties in this way, the fall of Sakti which was initially  very weak becomes less so, and an ardent desire to worship Siva, study the  agamas, and so on, arises in him. When the preceptor recognizes the ripening  indicated by such an ardent desire, he should immediately confer upon him  visesadtksa, which enables the pupil to study the agamas, worship Siva, and so on.  (SPbh p. 288)  

If samayadiksa is predominantly a rite of entry, visesadtksa ("special initia tion") is in essence a rite of rebirth. The initiating guru ritually removes the  initiate's soul from his body, places it in the womb of VagTsvaiT1 a form of  Sakti, installed in a sacrificial fire, and there subjects it to a series of life cycle rites (samskaras) replicating birth. When the soul is then returned to  

the novice's body, he has been reborn as a "son of Siva" (putraka).9  After completion of this initiation, the newborn son is able to worship  Siva on his own behalf, he is fit to conduct fire rites (homa), and he is eligi ble to study the Saiva texts. For most Saivas, this is as far along the path of  ritual transformation as they wish to proceed. Those seekers of worldly  benefits (Jbubhuksus) who intend to remain householders generally have no  reason to go beyond this stage. But some others, further along perhaps in  the ripeness of their fetters, do show signs that they are ready for more.  As such a person conducts his regular duties of worship and study, says  Sivagrayogin, "the fall of Sakti, which was previously mild, becomes in tense" (SPbh p. 288). New symptoms begin to appear: 

92 · Chapter Three    

An ardent aversion toward samsara, that ocean of suffering, arises; a strong de sire to see diva's lotus feet also is born. New thoughts arise: "When will I see the  Lord of Gods? When will I be released from my bonds? Who will show me  Siva?" (PA 4.39-41 in $RS 51)  

Such signs serve as an observable index of the inner state of the soul, of the  degree to which Sakti has indeed fallen. There is a shift, as Sakti falls, from  worldly concerns to a longing for liberation.  

Sakti falls without fail on the bodies of those who show these signs: yearning for  liberation and repugnance toward remaining in this world, devotion toward the  devotees of Siva, and faith in the teacher and in the rule of conduct taught by  Siva. (MrA vidya 5.4)  

According to AghoraMva, a novice should stay with the preceptor for at  least one year, time enough for the guru to examine carefully the condition  of the prospective initiate. Only after such preparation and observation can  the teacher be sure that nirvanadiksa will achieve its desired effect.  

Now, when the teacher recognizes that the pupil's mala has ripened and that  Sakti has fallen on him, and when he has been consecrated through the common  and special initiations and has remained with him for one year, then only the  eligible guru should perform nirvanadiksa. (KKD p. 264)  

The Efficacy of Initiation  

Nirvanadtksa is a very powerful ritual. Rauravagama compares the effects of  initiation on the soul to those of a flame on cotton: "As a heap of cotton  placed on a blazing fire is consumed completely, and never again is cotton,  so that best of men, the initiate who approaches the mandala and receives  the mantra of initiation, is never again born" (RA vidya 8.9-10). Initiation  annihilates fetters like a blazing fire and in so doing also allows the soul's  powers to emerge. SomaSambhu, for instance, defines initiation as "that by  which the fetters such as mala and maya are dissolved, and by which knowl 

edge is born in the pupil" (SP 3.1.2). AnantaSambhu relates this twofold  function of initiation to the morphemes supposed to comprise the word dikfa.  "The word 'diksa' has a double meaning. The morpheme dl denotes 'giving'  (dana); ksa denotes 'removal' (ksaya). 'Giving' is used because initiation  grants sivatva; 'removal' is used because it causes the destruction of the  three fetters" (SSV 57-58). The results accomplished by initiation, then, are  exactly the two alterations in the soul's condition that constitute liberation:  eliminating fetters and manifesting innate powers.  

Potent though it is, nirvanadik§a does not bring about immediate libera tion. In Kirandgama, Garuda asks the Lord about this. "If, through initiation,  the god completely removes the fetters, why should the body remain upon 

Becoming a Siva * 93    

completion of the ritual?" As Garuda knows full well, a soul without fetters  would have no further need of a body. Yet it is apparent that a new initiate,  unlike the incinerated cotton heap, does continue corporeal life after com pleting the initiatory ceremony. Siva answers this conundrum first with an  analogy. "This body remains after the consecration is accomplished, as a  potter's wheel continues to spin even when the pot has been completed."  Then he goes on to summarize tersely the effects of nirvartadiksa on the  different types of karman: "The many [accumulated] karman are burned  up like seeds by the 'atoms' [i.e., the mantras used in initiation], future  karman are suppressed, and the karman by which this [present body] exists  [are removed only] through consumption" (KirA vidya 6.17-19). In other  words, Siva answers that the soul remains embodied after initiation because  the ritual does not remove all fetters. If it completely destroyed them, the  novice, no longer requiring a body, would pass directly from the ritual to  liberation.  

Initiation acts directly and completely only on sancitakarman, the reposi tory of karman that otherwise would cause the soul to be reborn many times.  This constitutes by far the largest part of one's karman. By destroying this  stockpile destined to be consumed in future lives, initiation enables the soul  to forgo further rebirth. However, initiation does not fundamentally affect  the other two categories of karman. It does not eliminate prarabdhakarman;  this can be removed only by living out one's current life, consuming the  active karman "by which this present body exists" along the way. Nor does  initiation remove agamin. Since this karman does not yet exist, initiation  can at best prevent its occurrence. It must be dealt with later, as it comes  into being. These latter two categories are the ones that keep the potter's  wheel spinning, maintaining the initiate in his present body until his death.  

Although the main action of nirvanadiksa is the destruction of fetters, ini tiation rites are also devoted to the emergence of the soul's inherent Siva ness. These rites are necessary, says Nirmalamani, because Sivatva does not  automatically manifest itself when the fetters are removed. It is not like sim ply taking away a cloth so that a previously covered pot becomes visible. A  better analogy, he suggests, is Aghorasiva's eye doctor curing a case of  cataracts. Here, "the eyes do not regain their power of perception just  through the removal of the cataracts that have covered them." Rather, the  doctor must use some ointment as well, to aid the eyes in recuperating. The  initiation rites for the manifestation of sivatva are analogous to the doctor's  ointment: they assist the soul's powers, which have been "debilitated by  their beginningless bondage."  

The ritual efficacy of initiation in removing fetters and unleashing Siva like powers results from Siva's own action. Siva makes his most direct in tervention in the career of the soul during initiation, bestowing his "grace"  (anugraha) powerfully and irrevocably on the initiate. "As the sun illumi-94 · Chapter Three    

nates the worlds with its rays," says Rauravagama, "so Siva shines through  his powers (Sdkti) during the 'sacrifice of mantras'" (RA vidya 8.4). Siva  acts in nirvanadik^a by entering into the guru performing the ritual, who  thereby becomes Siva's "support" or embodiment during the course of the  ritual. All ritual actions performed by the guru are, in fact, the actions of  Siva; the initiating priest is simply Siva's appointed agent (adhikarin) in  carrying out this act of grace. The guru acts throughout with the "hand of  Siva." Thus the event most crucial to the soul's eventual liberation is also  the highest expression of Siva's grace.  

Rites of Removal and Emergence  

Initiation acts as an instrument through which the soul is brought toward  liberation, by removing fetters and assisting its inherent powers to emerge.  In a performance of nirvdnadiksa, the rites specifically directed to accom plish these two tasks are the central, operative actions of the ritual. The  pupil's fetters are removed through the construction and subsequent destruc tion of the paSasutra, the "cord of fetters," which serves as a "substitute  body" (pratikaya) for the initiate within the ritual. After his fetters have  been removed, the initiate's soul is united (yojanika) with Siva and his di vine qualities are brought forth (gundpddana) through the offering of a series  of oblations.  

Nirvanadiksd requires two days for its complete performance.10 The first  day is devoted to preparations. The most important object prepared is the  pasasutra, a cotton cord equal in length to the pupil's body. It is purified  with water and mantras and suspended from the pupil's topknot down to his  big toe. The initiating priest, the guru, then transfers out of the pupil's body  all its constituents and imposes them onto the cord.  

Here, as throughout the ritual, it is the priest who accomplishes the rite.  The novice remains passive. The priest has already invoked Siva into him self, and hence it is Siva who acts through him. As for the initiate, his in trinsic powers of knowledge and action are still suppressed by fetters, and  so he is not able to act for himself during the ritual. Only one who possesses  

unfettered powers can accomplish the great changes of initiation.  The method used by the guru to transport each of these realities is com plex.11 First the guru strikes the initiate with a flower, and with his own soul  he enters into the pupil's body along one of its subtle channels. Inside, he  gathers up the thing he wishes to transport, removes it from its place in the  novice's body, and carries it to his own heart. Then he transports it upward  and out of his own body and unites it with the cord. Once the constituent is  joined with the cord, the guru worships it, constrains it there, performs a  protective encirclement, and offers it three fire oblations. Each of these rit-

Becoming a Siva - 95    

ual actions is carried out with an appropriate mantra, and many require a  specific mudra as well. The guru repeats these steps each time he conveys  something from the body of the initiate onto the cord.  

The guru first transports the goddess $akti, then (according to Soma Sambhu) the three subtle channels of the body and the six "paths" (adhvan).  Next he transports the pupil's soul and the fetters. Finally he transports the  five kalas.  

Of all the constituents imposed onto the cord, the five kalas figure most  prominently in this ritual.12 Like the thirty-six tattvas, the five kalas ("por tions" of the cosmos) are cosmological entities. According to the Sivapu rana, $iva brings about the emission of the five kalas at the time of creation.  

Santyatita emanated from Sakti, then Santi was emitted in due order, then vidya,  and from that pratistha arose. Nivrtti came forth in due order from pratistha. Thus is  described fully the emission directed by Siva. These five kalas are emitted in  normal order (anulomya); reabsorption proceeds in the inverse direction (prati 

lomya). The highest creator animates the world from the five aforesaid entities,  and so the five kalas permeate this entire world. (&Pur 1.9.4-7)  

So too in nirvanadiksa the kalas provide an ontological framework within  which the entire manifest world is encompassed, differentiated, and ranked.  All realities are contained or "enwombed" (garbhita) within them. The  Kamikagama points to their all-inclusive character:  

Mantras, words, phonemes, tattvas, and worlds are encompassed (vyapya); the  bonds of karman, mala, and the derivatives of maya are encompassing  (vyapaka). But the bonds such as mala are also encompassed, and the kalas are  encompassing [in relation to them]. Therefore, when one grasps these kalas, one  appropriates (svikarana) all the others. Similarly, through their placements and  their purifications, everything is placed and purified. (UKA 23.31-34)  

Before transporting each kala, the guru must first visualize all that is in cluded within it: tattvas, mantras, words, phonemes, worlds, seed-sylla bles, subtle channels, bodily winds, sense objects^ qualities, and governing  lords—in short, all constituents of the manifest cosmos. By gathering up  and transporting these kalas, the guru also transports all the realities con tained in them.  

While the set of kalas contains all manifest realities, they also divide up  and rank the encompassed realities among themselves. In order of relative  purity or subtlety the kalas are: santyatita, santi, vidya, pratistha, and nivrtti.  Accordingly, the two purest, most subtle tattvas are included within  santyatita, the next three most subtle in santi, and so on down to the least  subtle, Earth, included in nivrtti. Similarly, the most subtle worlds are found  in the santyatita, and the least subtle in nivrtti. All other realities encom-

96 · Chapter Three    

passed within the kalds are also ranked according to the same scheme. Thus,  the kalds present five hierarchical planes or dimensions of being that, be tween them, encompass all that there is.13  

There is one important exception to the all-inclusive character of the  kalds. The kalds contain all the initiate's karman except prdrabdhakarman  and the karman arising as a consequence of that. This exception is necessary  since, if initiation were to remove his active karman, he would have no need  to remain embodied after completion of the ritual.  

When he transports the five kalds, the guru begins with Mntyatita and  proceeds according to the order of emission. This order is appropriate here  because the guru is ritually constructing the pdsasiitra. Each kald occupies  a portion of the pupil's body, with the most subtle kald located in the high 

est place, as one would expect. (See Figure 7.) The kalds are correspond ingly placed onto the suspended pdsasiitra. SdntyatIta is joined onto the  highest segment of the cord, then SdnH, and so on down to nivrtti, located on  the lowest portion. After all kalds have been joined onto the cord, the guru  marks it to indicate the location of each one, using colored powders to dye  each segment and tying knots at each boundary.  

Through this process of transferring constituents from body to cord, the  pdSasutra is impregnated with the pupil's complete makeup. It becomes a  virtual reembodiment of the initiate, body and soul. The guru removes the  cord, worships it, and places it near the Siva-pot, asking Siva to protect it  overnight.  

The following day the guru uses the pdSasHtra to perform a "purification  of the kalds" (kaldiuddhi). During this rite the soul of the initiate is sepa rated from the kalds, and the kalds are then destroyed together with the fet ters contained in them. As on the first day, each kald is treated separately,  in sequence. This time, however, the guru follows the order of reabsorp tion, beginning with nivrtti and ending with Sdntyatita, as is appropriate for  a rite of purification. In this description, I use nivrttikald as a model; each  subsequent kald follows the same procedure. j  

The guru begins by once again visualizing nivrttikald and'all the realities  included within it. As part of the visualization, the guru also imagines  wombs within the kald. The kalds contain all possible wombs into which a  soul might—as a result of previously acquired karman—be born. Like other  encompassed realities, the wombs are differentiated and ranked according  to the kalds in which they are found. In nivrtti, for instance, are found the  wombs of the fourteen lowest states of existence: wild animals, cattle,  birds, snakes, plants, humans, demons, titans, demigods, Gandharvas,  Indra1 Soma, PrajeSvara, and Brahman. Wombs in purer kalds are of higher  orders of beings.  

Once the guru has fully visualized nivrttikald, he detaches it from the cord

and transports it into the firepit. He invokes into the fire VagISvari and  VagTsvara and worships them appropriately. VagTsvari (the "goddess of  sound") here is considered a "universal mother" possessing all possible  wombs (MrA kriya 8.104). Within each kala, the goddess contains all the  wombs proper to that plane of being. She is a form of Sakti, as VagKvara  is of Siva. The guru now gathers up the pupil's soul. He transports it to his  own heart first and then, while conveying it toward the fire, he visualizes  Sakti and Siva copulating. He places the soul in all Sakti's wombs at once.  In each womb the soul is joined with an embryo resulting from the sexual  union of Sakti and Siva.  

The purpose in subjecting the initiate's soul to this multiple conception is  to accelerate the process of consuming karman. Only consumption can re move karman, and consumption takes place during the soul's embodiment.  Even ritual tactics cannot circumvent this principle of the cosmos, so in-

98 · Chapter Three    

stead one seeks to speed things up. By placing the pupil's soul in many  bodies simultaneously, the guru enables it to experience rapidly the accu mulated karman that—without this ritual help—would require many life times to consume. Each kala, then, provides an environment made up of  

many constituents, in which the soul can ritually pass through all the exis tences appropriate to that plane of being. Since the kalas together encom pass all possible wombs, in initiation the pupil is able to experience concep tion in every state of existence for which his karman might predestine him.  

And by ritually living through these potential incarnations, he can consume  all karman of these future lifetimes as well.  

The novice next summarily enacts the life cycles of his many embodi ments by undergoing a set of appropriate consecrations (samskdras). The  guru performs each consecration by making oblations into the fire, each ob lation accompanied by the proper mantra and visualization. After the pupil's  soul has procured its bodies (garbhddhana), these bodies are born (jatakar man) and acquire their proper aptitudes (adhikdra). All the soul's karman is  distributed among the bodies and then brought to fruition. The guru visual izes that the soul experiences and consumes (bhoga) all that is engendered  from the traces of actions past and future. He next performs the rite of "at tachment," which AghoraSiva defines as the "thorough pleasure" that the  soul feels toward that which it experiences {KKD p. 312). Finally the guru  performs a "complete removal" intended to "finish off all karman" (KKDP  p. 320). With this final removal, the initiate's soul completes the consump tion of all binding karman located in the nivrttikala. Thus, the need to be  reborn as a wild animal, cow, bird, snake, or in any of the fourteen wombs  of nivrttikala has been ritually obviated.  

The guru next attacks the fetters as a group. Using oblations, mantras,  and visualization, he first detaches the soul from maya, which is possible  now that consumption no longer exists. He then suppresses the effects of  mala and separates the soul from it. Finally he detaches the soul from kar 

man, "even though it has already been consumed" {KKD p. 313). With the  initiate's soul safely separated from the fetters, the guru now cuts off the  section of the pasasutra containing nivrttikala, smears it with cow dung,  rolls it into a ball, places it in the sacrificial ladle and mixes it with ghee,  and burns it completely in the fire. As the segment of cord is annihilated, so  are the fetters it contains. Much as the "heap of cotton" in the Raurava 

gama's analogy, the cotton cord is consumed completely in fire, allowing  the initiate's body to shed its fetters but remain alive. The paiasutra is the  necessary stand-in for his body, which could not be subjected to the same  treatment as the cord without it resulting in physical death.  

The pupil's soul has at this point experienced birth in every state of exis tence possible within nivrttikala and consumed all karman pertaining to it. It 

Becoming a Siva - 99    

has been carefully detached from all three fetters. Those fetters have been  destroyed in the fire along with the segment of cord on which they were  situated. The purification of nivrttikala is complete. The guru visualizes the  initiate's soul, "liberated from the net of nivrttikala, and resembling a pure  crystal gem" (KKD p. 313). Once again he grasps the soul and transports it  to the next-higher segment of the cord, where it awaits the purification of  the next-purer kala.  

Through the sequential purifications of all five kalas, containing all pos sible wombs and encompassing all fetters, the pupil's soul is liberated com pletely from its bondage and from the need for subsequent rebirth. Soma Sambhu compares it, as it is freed step by step, to the moon slowly emerging  

from the grasp of the eclipse, in the end appearing like "the autumn moon  fully arisen" (SP 3.3.215).  

When the initiate's fetters have been removed, the inherent powers of his  soul are free to manifest themselves. Unlike the autumn moon, however, the  soul's powers do not immediately shine of their own accord. Here again  rites are necessary. The soul's divine qualities (gum) are immanent, but they  have been debilitated by their bondage. As the eye doctor uses an ointment  to assist a patient in recovering his sight, in initiation the guru must unite  his pupil's soul with ParamaSiva and offer oblations to "produce" (άράάαηα)  or "animate" (uttejana) the attributes that make up its sivatva. The Svac chandatantra compares the production of these qualities to the royal  abhiseka. "When the king attains sovereignty, a priest anoints him with pots,  and bards proclaim his royal virtues throughout the land. In the same way,  when the initiate attains Sivatva, the wise priest will produce his divine qual ities" (SvaT 4.443-44). In both cases, immanent capacities are made fully  manifest through the efficacy of ritual action.  

The guru first asks for diva's permission to unite the soul with Siva. He  does several preparatory purifications and again requests of Siva, "Please  cause this soul's sivatva to become manifest." Offering oblations into the  fire, he performs the five life-cycle consecrations used previously, this time  in the sivatattva. At this point, of course, there is no more karman to be  consumed. These consecrations instead stimulate five qualities constituting  the soul's sivatva: entry into the sivatattva, emergence of the powers of  knowledge and action, complete sovereignty, self-arising joy, and the abil ity to identify with Siva. This manifestation of Siva-ness, however, is only  a preparation for the more fundamental one to follow.  

The guru prepares himself mentally by meditating on his identification  with Siva. He once again enters into the initiate's body, collects his soul,  removes it from that body, and returns with it to his own heart. There the  pupil's soul is united with his own. Then, reciting the PRASADA mantra,  Siva's own mantra, in an ascending order, the guru together with the pupil's 

100 · Chapter Three    

soul rises along his sufumna to the dvadaianta, where Siva resides in his  most complete form. (I will discuss PRASADA and the method of ascending  pronunciation in the following chapter.)  

The guru unites the initiate's soul with Parama^iva, "of whom highest  joy is the intrinsic form, who surpasses the mind's reach, who is empty  of qualities and yet the eternal source of qualities." Then he animates the  six divine qualities of the soul: omniscience, contentment, eternal enlight 

enment, independence, indestructible power, and infinite power. For each  of these attributes, the guru offers three oblations into the fire and recites  a mantra (using the seed-syllable of an angamantra) that invokes the qual ity. Liberated from the fetters that had long suppressed it, and now ani mated by oblations and mantras, the soul's inherent Sivatva is able to  emerge. The guru, with a divine glance, sees the soul of the novice "orna mented by its own emanating energies (tejas), like the disk of the sun"  (KKD p. 359). The initiate has fully become a Siva while temporarily united  with Paramasiva.  

To close the performance of nirvanadiksa, the guru returns the pupil's soul  to his body so that it may consume its remaining pmrabdhdkarman. As in dicated above, this category of karman was expressly omitted from inclu sion within the kalas, and consequently the initiation has not affected it. The  initiate's condition has been fundamentally altered by the ritual. All karman  that would otherwise engender future rebirths has been annihilated. Yet he  must remain living in his present body in order to complete gradually the  consumption of his residual karman and thereby gain final liberation. The  guru, with the initiated pupil beside him, prays to Siva: "'Taking on my  form, you have granted grace to this initiate. Therefore, O Lord, make his  devotion toward god, fire, and guru grow. By your favor, may he remain  firm in unbroken ritual. Let him not be guilty of any fault that would again  bind him'" (KKD pp. 360-61).  

In summary, initiation is the decisive event in the soul's passage from  bondage to liberation. The effects achieved by nirvdnadik$a are precisely  those two transformations in the soul's condition that characterize moksa it self: the removal of fetters that bind the soul, and the emergence of the  

soul's inherent powers. The initiate's fetters are removed through ritual ac tions centering on the pasasiitra. This cord becomes, by a series of trans fers, a reembodiment of the initiate. Using the cord as medium, the soul is  able first to consume its accumulated karman and then to be separated from  all its fetters. The fetters are destroyed in the sacrificial fire. Rites devoted  to the emergence of the soul's sivatva follow. The soul is transported to the  realm of the highest Siva and united with him there, where the divine quali ties it shares with Siva are animated by oblations and mantras. With its  powers thus manifested, it is returned to the novice's body so that it may  consume its remaining karman.u 

Becoming a Siva - 101    

COMPLETING THE PASSAGE  

The daily worship of Siva, says the Kamikagama, yields the fruits of both  worldly enjoyments and liberation (KA 4.1). Now that we have looked at the  philosophical model by which Saivas understand the soul's passage from  bondage to liberation, and followed the career of a soul through the ripening  of its fetters and the performance of initiation, we are in a much better posi tion to understand the role of daily worship in granting liberation.  

In daily worship, the primary rite directed toward liberation is that of  atmasuddhi. This rite, in which the ritualist "becomes a Siva" as a prepara tion for worshiping Siva, was described in the preceding chapter as a trans formation of the ritualist's body. More fundamentally, however, it should  be seen as a liberation of the soul. The body is an objectification of the  soul's bondage. By transforming his body, the worshiper alters the condi tion of his soul. He frees the soul from its most intimate fetters and replaces  them with a body made of mantras.  

Atmaiuddhi is a quotidian enactment in reduced form of the ritualist's  liberation. Like nirvdnadiksa, the "purification of the soul" in daily worship  puts into practice the double alteration in the soul's condition that consti tutes liberation: removal of the fetters and manifestation of the soul's  powers. This operation produces effects beyond the limits of the ritual it self. The performance of worship gradually diminishes the soul's remaining  fetters so that, at death, none remain to prevent it from attaining final libera tion. During atmasuddhi, the initiated "son of Siva" (putraka) daily exer cises his own capacities of self-transformation, both rehearsing his final lib eration and at the same time gradually bringing it about. Daily ritual is the  best means available to the soul to complete its passage to mokfa.  

Body and Soul  

Initiation, we have seen, brings about a radical alteration in the spiritual  condition of the initiate, but it does not engender immediate liberation. Ac cording to Saivism, the "fruit of initiation" that is ultimate liberation is ob tained only upon bodily death, when the soul's remaining prarabdhakarman  has also been fully consumed. This raises the issue of just what the initiated  Saiva should do in the meantime. How should he act for the rest of his life  to facilitate his own final moksal  

At the completion of initiation, the novice is like a potter's wheel, ac cording to Siva's analogy in the Kiranagama. Though the pot itself is fin ished, the wheel continues to revolve due to its own momentum. The initiate  has removed his accumulated karman in initiation, and thereby eliminated  his need to be reborn, but he must return to his present body under the im pulsion of karman whose effects are already in motion. 

102 · Chapter Three    

The potter's-wheel analogy is useful, but it oversimplifies the situation.  The wheel is inanimate (jada), therefore inert, and its rotation will automati cally cease due to friction unless the potter again sets it in motion. The pu traka, on the other hand, is an animate soul, with powers of knowledge and  

action. He is not able to wait passively until his body ceases its spinning. He  must continue to act in the world after his initiation, and these actions are  liable to engender new fetters, which could prevent his final liberation. In  the language of karman, he must be sure not to contract any dgamin, while  at the same time consuming his remaining prarabdhakarman.  

The best course of action for the potential Siva, according to Aghoragiva,  is to behave in accord with samayacara, the rules of conduct incumbent on  all initiated Saivites. All human activities pose the risk of creating karman.  Actions based on this code, however, do not give rise to new karman in the  way that others do. One who has undergone initiation must faithfully follow  samayacara, preventing karman, if he is to reach final liberation when his  prarabdhakarman is completed and his body passes away.  

One invariable rule of samayacara is that the initiated Saiva must regu larly perform daily worship. "You should offer worship to Siva, to the fire,  and to your guru until the end of your life," the priest instructs his pupil at  the completion of initiation (JSP 3.2.23). Failure to worship Siva entails a  fault, leading to more residues of karman. However, it is not simply to  avoid a transgression that the initiate should offer puja. Daily worship—and  more specifically Stmasuddhi—plays a continuing role in resisting and re moving fetters.  

Daily worship serves as a prophylactic, claims the Matangaparamesvara gama, counteracting the acquisition of any new fetters.  

Thus sin does not arise in the one who daily worships the Prime Cause with devo tion, as daikness is not born after the rising of the sun. When his body ends, he  does not reenter the world on account of his stock of karman. Therefore this daily  ordinary worship brings good results [(or) conveys the sunrise]. (MPA kriya  3.100-101)  

Initiation is the sunrise that removes the earth's darkness, while daily wor ship is the continuation of sunshine during the day, preventing its return. In  day-to-day life, the initiate is bound to make small transgressions of the  rules. Daily worship, acting like a recurring initiation, removes the effects  of these misdeeds as they arise.  

Going beyond this counteractive view of Matanga, AghoraSiva sees daily  worship as a ritual method of gradual removal, affecting existing fetters as  well as newly arisen ones: "During the period after initiation, one may ac complish a removal of the fetters whose effects have already begun, such  that they diminish daily, by following the common rules of conduct, begin ning with bathing and worship" (TST 39). Both regard daily worship as a 

Becoming a Siva - 103    

necessary, efficacious action instrumental in the attainment of moksa. It  takes up where initiation left off, removing any remnants of fetters not de stroyed during nirvanadiksa, and brings to completion the process initiated  by that ritual.15  

The rite within daily worship that causes this removal is atmasuddhi.  Through this rite, we have seen, the worshiper becomes a Siva in order to  worship Siva. "In this way the worshiper attains the form of Siva (Siva rupata), albeit separate from it, by first purifying his soul and his body and  then imposing a mantra-body onto his own form, and thereby he becomes fit  to offer worship to Siva" (&AC p. 29). At the same time as it fulfills this  function within the context of ritual, it also contributes to the larger project  of liberating the soul through the removal of fetters.  

In the preceding chapter, I described the rite of atmasuddhi as a transfor mation of the worshiper's body. There are good reasons to view it in this  light, not least of which are the terms used for its component procedures:  "purification of the subtle body," "purification of the gross body," and "im position of the mantra-body." Atmasuddhi does indeed ritually transform  the body. But more fundamentally it is a "purification of the soul," an enact ment of the soul's liberation. In fact, atmasuddhi purifies the soul precisely  through the metamorphosis of the worshiper's body. The body is treated as  the locus of the soul's bondage, and a ritual transformation of the body  brings about the soul's temporary liberation.  

The soul, as we have seen, is itself immutable. It cannot be altered; only  its condition or situation may be changed. The entire passage of the soul  toward liberation is regarded by the Saivites as a sequence of processes—  ripening, initiation, proper conduct, and so on—that gradually alter its con 

dition by loosening and removing the fetters that bind it.  The soul inhabits a body only because it has fetters. For the soul, the body  is a necessary means of experience. It allows the soul to consume karman  and thus instigates the ripening of the fetters. However, the body is also the  most intimate projection of the soul's state of bondage. The body is brought  into being solely because of karman, and it is composed of the derivative  tattvas of may ά. As an objectification of the soul's fetters, it also acts as an  instrument of this bondage. The body is a receptacle for the soul, which,  once contained, is also constrained by it. For this reason, the body is the  object that instantiates most concretely and most closely the soul's bound  condition.  

This essential relationship between the soul's fetters and the body it in habits provides the underlying motive of atmasuddhi. In atmasuddhi, the  worshiper's body is treated as a limited and highly concentrated manifesta tion of fetters. All the constituents of the body in its normal state are re garded as "impurities" that stain the soul. Consequently, the means of puri fying the soul—that is, of removing it from its condition of bondage—must104 · Chapter Three    

involve a transformation of the body. The impure constituents must be  somehow removed. In the process the ritualist's body is transformed from  an objectification of the soul's fetters into an instrument of the soul's intrin sic powers. No longer posing an obstacle to worship, the worshiper's body  empowers the soul to act in the ritual. This "body of powers"—parallel to  

diva's own body—is the means by which the worshiper is able to cany out  all subsequent ritual actions of worship.  

Rehearsals of Liberation  

As an enactment of the soul's liberation, atmasuddhi has many elements in  common with nirvanadiksa. Both act on the soul through the medium of the  body. Both achieve their effects by an equivalent two-phase process: first a  removal of fetters, then a manifestation of Siva-like powers. The purifica 

tion of the elements (of the gross body) in atmaSuddhi is particularly similar  to the purification of the kalas in initiation. The construction of the divine  body in atmasuddhi also suggests parallels with the production of divine  qualities in nirvanadik$a. Kamikagama supports this linking of the two ritu als, stating that a worshiper should employ the same method of purification  in daily worship as was used in his initiation (KA 4.60-61).  

In the following description I will emphasize the parallelism between the  worshiper's daily self-purification and the ceremony of initiation. However,  there are also some significant differences between the two. Atmasuddhi  is a regular, repeated action undertaken daily by the initiated Saivite; initia 

tion is a singular event in the career of a religious aspirant. Atmasuddhi is  a rite embedded within the larger ritual of daily worship, whereas liberating  initiation is itself an extensive, independent ritual unity. Most important,  atmasuddhi is a rite performed by the worshiper himself, while initiation is  accomplished on the initiate by Siva acting through the guru. Atmaiuddhi  does recapitulate many of the important features of nirvanadiksa, but I do not  wish to suggest that it is simply a repetition in miniature.  

The performance of atmaiuddhi, we have seen, takes place in two con verse sequences of actions. First comes a phase of removals, of purification,  intended to bring about the destruction of impure or binding constituents.  This phase may be further divided into two series, correlated to a differenti ation of the subtle body and the gross body. Second is performed a phase of  impositions, of construction, meant to build a new body of divine powers.  Before the purifying phase of atmasuddhi, which is highly destructive, it is  necessary to protect the soul and its remaining karman from annihilation.  The soul is gathered up from throughout the body and moved to a safe place,  twelve inches above the head, where it is temporarily absorbed into Siva.  After purification is completed, the soul is returned through a descending 

Becoming a Siva - 103    

movement, placing it on a lotus throne in the worshiper's heart. Thus,  atmaiuddhi may be sequentially outlined as follows:  

1. protection of the soul, removal from the body  

2. purification of the body  

a. purification of the subtle body  

b. purification of the gross body  

3. return of the soul to the body  

4. construction of a divine body  

The purpose of protecting the soul is succinctly stated by Kdmikagama:  "This joining [of the soul with Siva] is done by priests to protect their kar man remaining to be consumed This karmart is not destroyed [during  this rite] due to the Lord's command" (KA 4.54-55). The ritual method em ployed to purify the body is a harsh one and poses a threat to the soul's  prarabdhakarman. This karman should not be destroyed prematurely, and  so it must be removed from the body to a safer asylum. Accordingly, the  worshiper collects the consciousness pervading his body into the seed-sylla ble HOM, which he visualizes as a flame in the middle of his su$umna. With an  ascending breath, he transports this syllable upward, bursting open as it pro ceeds all the nodes (granthi) that might otherwise obstruct its path. He re turns his consciousness and absorbs it into his soul. Placing his soul now in  the syllable HAM, he expels his breath upward to the dvddasanta, where he  unites his soul with Siva.  

Mth the soul safely placed in the dvadaianta, the worshiper may now  purify his body. The overall purpose is to neutralize and destroy all impure  constituents of the body and to remove them as fetters from the soul. Nir malamani defines the purification of the body with the soul's liberation in  mind:  

Purification of the tattvas located in the gross and subtle bodies by visualizing  their reabsorption is done in order to stop their binding nature (bandhakatvani vrtti), as [a tan trie healer] visualizes himself as Garuda in order to stop the effects  of poison. (KKDP p. 68)  

The constituents of the body are fetters to the soul, and their "binding na ture" must be somehow terminated for the soul to be free of them.  AghoraSiva divides the procedures of purification into two parts, one di rected at purifying the subtle body, the other at purifying the gross body. As  described in the preceding chapter, the purification of the subde body con sists in a reabsorption of all thirty-six tattvas constituting the subde body  into their two source-substances maya and mahamaya. The worshiper visu alizes each tattva going within its source, according to the order of reab sorption, until only the two undifferentiated substances remain. Undifferen-

106 · Chapter Three    

tiated maya does not itself constitute a fetter. Rather, the thirty-one tattvas  of the impure domain emitted from mccya—referred to as mdyeya—are what  actually bind the soul. By causing all these derivative tattvas to be reab sorbed into undifferentiated maya, the worshiper is able to remove the bind ing character of maya. Purifying the subtle body effectively neutralizes  maya as a fetter.  

The second purification is directed against the impurities of the gross  body. In one sense, the gross body is easily understood as that composed of  the five material elements.  

The "gross body" denotes the body made of elements (bhutaiarlra), born in a  certain world, whose form is both general and particular (sadharanasadharana):  [general in that it is] the locus that causes notions such as "birth-community,"  "family," and so on, [particular in that it is] an aggregation of the elements Earth,  Water, Fire, Wind, and Ether. (JKKDP p. 67)  

The five elements indicated here are the five least subtle of the thirty-six  tattvas that constitute the cosmos. Together they form the substratum for the  five perceptible qualities, which inhere in them. Being gross elements, they  are of course considered impure, and the worshiper's body must be purified  of them in atmasuddhi.  

In another sense, however, the five elements appear as more than mere  elements. They are termed "cosmic supports" (dharana) and are linked  closely with the five all-inclusive kalas. Each element serves as the support  for a kala. At the beginning of its description of purification, Kamikagama  refers to this second sense of the elements as cosmic supports.  

When its faults have been entirely annihilated, the soul remains, without mala,  like gold whose impurities have been cleansed by fiie. Similarly, a person de stroys many sins and becomes pure by means of [this purification of] the cosmic  supports, and then returns to his bodily state to fulfill his assigned role (adhi hard). (KA 4.57-58)  

This connection of the elements with the kalas is reinforced by several sim ilarities between this portion of atmasuddhi and the rite of kalasuddhi.  When the five elements of the gross body are viewed in this sense, as the  supports of the entire cosmos, then the purification of the gross body takes  on a wider dimension. Not simply a purification of bodily elements, it be comes also a purification of the cosmos itself as a source of fetters. The  worshiper's body in its composition of five elements is at the same time a  concentrated embodiment of fetters. Its purification, like that of the kalas in  initiation, liberates the soul from fetters.  

The rite used to purify the gross body operates on both levels. (This dou ble level of reference is reinforced by the vacillation in terms used by the 

Becoming a Siva * 107    

texts; sometimes they refer to "gross body," sometimes to "elements," to  "cosmic supports," or to "kalds" as the object of purification.) First the wor shiper visualizes the domain of each element. Each element is specifically  "endowed with" or "connected to" a kala (KalA 8.6-7).  

bhiita kala  

Ether Mntyatita  

Wind Santi  

Fire vidya  

Water pratistha  

Earth nivrtti  

Their positions on the scale of emission are equivalent; most subtle element  is paired with most subtle kala. The domains are located in specified parts  of the body, just as the kalds are in initiation. (Compare Figures 3 and 7.)  Furthermore, the domains that the ritualist visualizes are in almost every  respect parallel to those of the kalas visualized in initiation. Thus, as the  kalds encompass all manifest realities in initiation, so here the domains of  the elements include all realities among them.  

If the visualization of domains suggests the cosmic level of reference, the  next procedure switches to the material. Each domain has a number of at tributes, which are the perceptible qualities inherent in each element.16  Earth contains all five perceptible qualities, Water contains four, and so on.  The relationships here between material elements and perceptible qualities  are clearly those of the tattvas. The worshiper expels these qualities, one by  one, using ascending expulsions of breath. After the attributes are ejected,  the worshiper absorbs each element into its "opponent," so that each comes  to resemble the other. In effect, he neutralizes the binding power of his bod 

ily elements.  

With the elements fully visualized and neutralized, the worshiper visual izes his own form in a liberated state. "He should imagine that he has liber ated his own form from impermanence, limitation, impurity, and so on, and  that it is now endowed with permanence, pervasiveness, purity, and such  qualities" (KKD p. 58). Next he destroys all bodily elements. "Then, with  the fire arising from his right big toe and with ASTRA, he burns the impurities  of the elements located in the body resulting from karman whose con sequences have begun (prdrabdha), and then inundates it" (KKD p. 58).  Here both levels of reference appear. AghoraSiva speaks first of visualizing  the Siva-like qualities of the liberated soul, then of a physical destruction by  fire of the body's five material elements. The gross body is purified at two  levels: as an aggregate of five material elements, and as the "support" for  the kalds.  

Like kaldsuddhi in initiation, this purification of the gross body begins 

108 · Chapter Three    

with visualizations of each individual element. There is no transporting of  these elements—as in kalaSuddhi—to a substitute body. In both purifica tions, a procedure is used to neutralize the elements, though kalasuddhi,  with its complicated sequence aimed at consuming accumulated karman, is  by far the more complex. Destruction by fire is the culminating operation in  each rite. Here the fire is an internal one, arising from the worshiper's toe;  in initiation it is an external fire into which Siva has been invoked. Here the  fire acts directly on the ritualist's actual body; in initiation it destroys the  stand-in body, the pasasUtra. In both, there is a complete removal of fetters  except for the soul's prarabdhakarman, whose consumption cannot be cir 

cumvented by ritual means. The two rites are closely linked, though not  exactly identical.  

The ritualist's body is now empty. Wthout impurities or fetters, it poses  no danger to the soul, which may safely be returned to its normal location  in the body. To do this, the worshiper first mentally constructs in his heart  a throne in the form of a lotus. Following the order of emission, he leads the  soul downward from the dvddasanta, where it has been united with Siva,  and places it on that throne. He unites the soul in the puryastaka, the condi 

tioned form of the body, establishes the soul there, and finally bathes it with  a stream of nectar.  

This procedure parallels that of invocation, by which Siva or any divinity  is brought into a prepared form. This is suitable since, as AghoraSiva tells  us, the soul is "located in the dvada&dnta in the form of bija, and is made  of Siva" (iivamaya)" (KKD p. 59). By its separation from fetters it has be come a Siva, and it must be treated as such. The soul is reinvoked into its  body much as Siva will be later invoked into the linga.  

The imposition of mantras onto the worshiper's purified body reconsti tutes it as a body of powers, a divine body appropriate to the soul that has  become a Siva. As indicated in the previous chapter, this successive imposi tion of mantras invokes the form and powers of Siva onto the body: most  important among these, the five brahmamantras invoke the five faces of  SadaSiva, identified with Siva's five fundamental activities, and the six anga mantras impose Siva's powers. At one level this rite constructs for the wor shiper a body like that of Siva, saturated with the same mantra powers, ca pable of carrying out the ritual actions to follow. At a second level, these  mantra powers may be seen as external forms of the soul's own intrinsic  powers, the realization of the soul's Siva-ness as a divine body.  

During initiation, six perfections—aspects of the soul's sivatva—are pro duced or animated while the novice's soul is united with Paramasiva. Here  the divine powers are imposed after the soul has been returned to its body.  In initiation the qualities appear to arise from the soul, animated by fire  oblations; here the powers are imposed from the outside onto the body, in voked through mantras. 

Becoming a Siva · 109    

Yet beneath these differences, the powers themselves appear to be the  same. At the least, there is a parallel between diva's six divine powers rep resented by the angamantras and the six perfections of the soul. The anga mantras are often described as embodying specific divine qualities of Siva,  as in this passage from Kamikagama.  

H$D is his existence, and SIRAS is his lofty pieeminence. SKHA is his independ ence. KAVACA would be his protective powers, ASTRA is the power by which he  annihilates, NETRA is his power of omniscience, which illuminates everything.  Thus the six perfections of the creator of the world, Siva, are stated here. (KA  4.363-65)  

The imposition of angamantras in atmaiuddhi invokes diva's powers onto  the worshiper. These powers are the same in character as the inherent  powers of his soul, the divine qualities animated during initiation. IsanaSiva  points to this connection when he speaks of the soul's perfections produced  in initiation as "limbs" (anga) that "belong to Siva" as well. "Meditating that  the pupil has become a Siva, the guru should produce the six perfections,  which are limbs, and which belong to Siva" (IP 3 p. 185). The divine qual 

ities of the soul, animated in initiation, are parallel to the powers of Siva  imposed onto the worshiper's body in atmasuddhi}1 Both make manifest  the soul's inherent sivatva, which is able to emerge when the fetters sup pressing it have been removed.  

Last Rites  

The soul's passage to final liberation, to becoming a Siva permanently, is  brought about by removing its fetters and enabling its inherent powers to  manifest themselves. It is a long process. A gradual evolution of the fetters  eventually brings the soul to a state where it is ready to undergo nirva 

nadiksa. Initiation effects an enormous alteration in the soul's condition, de stroying completely karman that otherwise would condemn the soul to many  future rebirths. Yet even after initiation the passage is still not complete.  Due to the remaining prarabdhakarman, the soul must remain in its body  until all karman already in motion has been consumed. During this period,  the daily performance of puja and particularly of atmasuddhi removes or  resists any fetters that might arise from day-to-day living. This regular re 

hearsing of the soul's liberation, performed every day from initiation to  death, gradually prepares the initiated Saiva to become a Siva permanently.  Even this is not enough. One final ritual remains to insure that the aspi rant attains final liberation: the cremation of the body upon death (antyesti).18  Saivas identify death as the moment when a person completes the con sumption of pmrabdhakarman, the karman conditioning the present life time. For the seeker of moksa who has undergone nirvanadik^a and who has 

110 · ChapterTliree    

diligently observed proper conduct thereafter, this completion should signal  the final extinction of all karman, and hence of all fetters. "And so, for one  on whom Siva's Sakti falls strongly due to the complete ripening of his  mala, and who has no deficiency in his initiation, and who does not trans 

gress the common rule of conduct—for him, moksa occurs immediately upon  bodily death" (TST 39). But it is difficult to be sure. There is a danger that  omissions or ritual oversights may have occurred.  

Saivas regard the ritual of cremation primarily as an "expiation" (praya scitta). It expiates any karman the subject may have contracted through  ritual errors, such as "deficiencies" in one's initiation or "transgressions" of  proper conduct thereafter. And by removing any lingering fetters the de ceased may have unintentionally or unknowingly gained, cremation be comes the final door to liberation. As the Rauravagama defines it, crema tion is the "sacrifice" (isti) that leads to the "final" (antya) state, the supreme  state of Siva-hood (RA 46.1-2).  

Cremation necessarily involves, first of all, the incineration of the corpse  (Savadaha) in a sacrificial fire. After suitable purifications and preparations,  the body of the deceased is placed on a funeral pyre. The sacrificial fire  Agni, identified as a form of Siva's power of reabsorption, then consumes  the body. In the conflagration, all the maya-derived elements that previ ously constituted the body are reabsorbed into their sources. The soul be comes free of its embodiment, which has acted as a force of bondage upon  it throughout its lifetime.  

More important, from the Saiva point of view, the ceremony of cremation  also provides an opportunity to reenact the nirvanadiksa of the deceased.  Since cremation is an expiation that removes finally any remaining fetters,  what better way to accomplish this than by repeating the most powerful lib 

erating ritual in the Saiva system right in the middle of the funeral rites. This  embedded initiation involves a condensed repetition of the most essential  ritual actions of the nirvanadiksa previously performed on the living initiate,  this time administered to his corpse.  

Just before the body is placed atop the funeral pyre, the officiating priest  begins the rites of crematory initiation by capturing the errant soul with the  "Great Net" mantra and restoring it to the corpse. Then, just as in nir vanadiksa, he transfers all constituents from the body of the deceased and  imposes them onto a cord of fetters. He follows exactly the same set of  purificatory actions as in kalasuddhi, consuming and destroying one by one  all the fetters in the Siva-Agni fire, until they are completely annihilated.  This time, the prarabdhakarman has also been extinguished. Then the guru  transports the soul of the deceased upward and unites it with ParamaSiva,  where its divine qualities may fully emerge. In crematory initiation, how 

ever, unlike in nirvanadiksa, there is no subsequent need to remove the soul  from the presence of Siva and return it to the body. Rather, the guru simply 

Becoming a Siva - 111    

leaves the soul where it is, in the state of Siva, and burns the corpse like a  heap of cotton.  

Through this final ritual recapitulation of initiation, all obstacles to libera tion are overcome. Every bit of the soul's karman has now been consumed;  the potter's wheel finally stops spinning. The soul is released, fully liberated  from all bondage, and attains permanently what it has repeatedly experi enced temporarily through ritual practice, the highest ontological state of  being a Siva. 

## 4 Summoning the Lord  

THE LORD SIVA is not limited the way we humans are. Theological de scriptions of Siva emphasize that the many limitations we experience as  embodied human beings in a state of bondage do not in any way affect  Siva. Human beings are limited in time; Siva is eternal, without beginning,  middle, or end. Our human bodies are confined in space; Siva is pervasive,  omnipresent. As paSus, we are constrained by fetters; Siva is eternally with out mala, liberated without beginning. Humans are characteristically agi tated by psychic disturbances, alternately attracted and repulsed by the  things of the world; Siva is completely calm. We humans are always de pendent on and subordinate to other beings; Siva is the one completely  independent, autonomous being. Humans possess finite capacities; Siva's  powers of knowledge and action are infinite. Ultimately, Siva is not  bounded even by our capacity to conceptualize him. Siva is the one "whose  domain surpasses our speech and mind."  

Such a transcendent god cannot, according to Saiva siddhanta, be wor shiped directly. He cannot be said to have a particular form, and it is not  possible for humans to meditate upon or offer worship to a completely form less being. According to a text quoted by Aghorasiva, "It is only to the  extent that You possess a visible form that one is able to approach You. The  intellect cannot approach something lacking any visible form."1 Yet for  Saiva worship to take place, it is absolutely necessary that Siva enter into  the ritual domain. He must be present to receive the offerings of his  worshiper.  

This is the problem at the heart of invocation (avahana): how does one  summon a divinity that is by definition limitless into a limited sphere of  ritual, so that a bound human of limited powers may offer him worship? The  problem is both theological and procedural, a concern for both knowledge  and action. And the solution Saiva siddhanta texts offer, likewise, provides  both a way of knowing Siva and of invoking his presence.  

THE THEOLOGY OF SIVA'S PRESENCE  

In its description of Siva's "inherent form," the Ajitagama pointedly pro claims that he is "not bound by space, time, or the like" and that "his  domain surpasses speech and mind" (AA 2.26-27). Similarly, the Svayam bhuvdgama describes Siva's "essence" (tattva) as "unfathomable, inde-

Summoning the Lord * 113    

scribable, incomparable, without defect, subtle, pervasive, eternal, firm,  imperishable, and lordly."2 As Sivagrayogin elaborates,  

Siva is unfathomable because he is without end; indescribable because he is not  to be characterized (alaksya); incomparable because there is nothing like him;  without defect because he has no mala; subtle because he is not perceivable  {anupalabhya)·, pervasive because ubiquitous; eternal because he is devoid of  cause; firm because unmoving; imperishable because he is complete; lordly be cause he is master of the world. ($Pbh p. 62)  

The emphasis that Saiva theology places on the unlimited qualities of  Siva raises a difficult question concerning human access to Siva. Character izations of Siva place him in a domain far beyond human powers of know ing and acting. If Siva is unfathomable, indescribable, incomparable, and  imperceivable, what means do we have to know him? How can we offer  worship to a god who is imperceivable, pervasive, unmoving, and com plete? How do humans of limited powers gain access to one who surpasses  all limits?  

Two Levels of Siva  

The only ultimate resolution of this enigma lies in the liberation of the soul.  When the soul attains mok$a, the limitations that normally inhibit its powers  are removed, and the soul is able to approach Siva fully, just as he is. (Yet  in liberation, the agamas remind us, one "does nothing" because "there is  nothing to be done."3 Offering piija, for instance, is an act appropriate to  bound souls, not to liberated ones.) Since we are not liberated, however, it  is necessary to address the quandary posed by Siva's unlimited nature and  our limited powers from the perspective of bondage. Human knowledge and  action presuppose limitation, yet it is nevertheless crucial for us to approxi 

mate the infinite as best we can.  

Saiva philosophers deal with the epistemological problem by first distin guishing two levels of Siva. The first level, said to be true in the highest  sense (paramarthika), is the limitless, transcendent ParamaSiva ("Highest  Siva") described in the passages above: a formless, undifferentiated Para ma£iva "without parts" (niskala). Positive knowledge of Siva at this level is  beyond human reach. Siva is said to be "unfathomable," the Vatulagama  tells us, "because he surpasses every human means of knowledge."4 The  Acintyagama elaborates, "Siva's highest nature cannot be known through  observation (adhyaksa), nor from its marks (IiAga), nor through verbal author ity (Sabda)."5 Descriptions of ParamaSiva are therefore essentially negative  ones, pointing to the absence of any limiting qualities.  

Similarly, worship of Siva at this level is impossible. "It is not possible,"  says AghoraSiva, "to meditate on or give worship and the like to an entity114 · ChapterFour    

without form" (TPV 6). Considered in his highest state, ParamaSiva sur passes the capacities of bound pasus.  

The second level of Siva, true only as a partial approximation or synec doche (upacara), is Siva as he is understood to manifest himself and act in  multiple ways upon the world: a differentiated Siva "with parts" (sakala).  The agamas stress the completeness of Siva's activities affecting the world  and everything in it. He is the "unique seed of the world," that is, the instru mental cause of all creation (TP 1), and the one who grants all grace. He  performs the five fundamental activities that set in motion the most essential  processes of the cosmos and of souls.  

It is through this active presence in the world that Siva becomes accessi ble to humans. Embodied souls do not generally perceive Siva's activities  directly, but we are able to observe the many effects resulting from his ac tivities and to relate these effects to particularized aspects of his character.  Siva's effects on the world are pervasive and multifarious, and we posit a  differentiated Siva composed of many parts to account for these. Hyposta tizing his activities, we may speak of the "powers" he uses to act and to  know, the "faces" with which he carries out the five fundamental activities,  the "limbs" whereby he acts upon the world.  

We know Siva, then, through synecdoche and through partial approxima tion. Bhojadeva summarizes the two levels of Siva in this way: "In an ulti mate sense, the entity we call Siva is one, inlaid with hundreds of various  powers. We postulate his divisions due to the diverse actions of his powers"  (TP 33). Commenting on this passage, AghoraSiva elaborates: "Due to the  diverse activities of Siva's powers, we postulate his divisions such as  SadaSiva and so on as a synecdoche, but this postulation (Mlpanika) is not  true in the highest sense (paramartha)" (TPV 33). Humans are able to know  and act toward this secondary, particularized Siva precisely because names  and forms are applied to partial facets of a single integrated divinity. In this  way Siva is given a metaphorical "body" that we are able to meditate upon  and worship.  

This epistemological division in our conceptualization of Siva's character  has no ultimate effect on Siva himself, of course. Siva's ontology encom passes both levels. The texts point out that Siva is not only both "without  parts" and "with parts," but also "both with and without parts" (sakala nifkala). With Siva, there can be no contradiction between transcendence  and activity, nor between states of integration and differentiation. The dis tinction we make between two levels is only an apparent one (upadhi)·, it is  not fundamental. Siva surpasses these conceptual categories as well.  

Siva's Multiple Forms  

Philosophical texts may caution us that the secondary Siva "with parts" is  not the highest aspect of Siva. Nevertheless, since it is through this aspect 

Summoning the Lord · IlS    

that humans are able to comprehend Siva and act toward him, this secondary  level is of intense interest. The agamas, in fact, speak of several different  forms by which we are able to approach Siva.  

The most comprehensive differentiated form of Siva is known as  SadaSiva, the "Eternal Siva." SadaSiva is virtually identical with Siva's five  fundamental activities. Siva accomplishes his most far-reaching effects on  the cosmos, we have seen, through five activities: emission, protection, re 

absorption, concealment, and grace. Yet it is not possible to act without a  "body" of some sort. Accordingly, even Siva must employ an instrument  (karana) to accomplish his purposes. For each fundamental activity, Siva  uses a corresponding mantra power: for emission the mantra is SADYOJATA,  for preservation it is VAMA, and so on. The five mantras through which  Siva carries out his most profound operations in the world, collectively  known as the five brahmamantras, constitute the five "faces" of Sadasiva.  Thus, SadaSiva represents Siva's most fundamental presence in the world,  the "body of mantras" with which Siva acts. "As the soul comes and goes  by means of the body, so one must acknowledge that Siva comes and goes  through his body of mantras" (KA 4.356). Or as Ramakantha succinctly puts  it, "Siva does everything using SadaSiva as his body" (KalAV 22.2-4).  

The SadaSiva body is emphatically not a body like those of humans. It is  made of mantras or of powers, and it is completely without bondage, which  is the determining feature of human bodies. In Sarvadarsanasamgraha, Ma dhava admirably summarizes the conception of SadaSiva in his discussion of  Saiva siddhanta philosophy:  

The body of Parame§vara is not a common (prakrta) one, since the net of fetters—  mala, karman, and the others—is absent from it. Rather, it is a body of powers  (Sakta), since its heads and other parts are composed of the five mantras begin ning with KANA, which have the forms of §aktis. As is generally known, Siva has  KANA as his heads, TATPURUSA for faces, AGHORA as heart, VAMA for genitals, and  SADYOJATA as feet. And his body, which is not like our bodies, is the instrument  fashioned by his own will with which he performs the five fundamental activi ties: grace, veiling, reabsorption, maintenance, and emission, in that order. (SDS  7.57-63)6  

As Madhava's description implies, it is not strictly accurate (though for us  it will be linguistically convenient) to refer to this body of powers as  "SadaSiva's body," as if SadaSiva were a distinct being possessing a body.  Rather, the mantra-constituted body is SadaSiva, and it is an instrumental  part of the larger, encompassing Siva that Madhava refers to as the "Highest  Lord" ParameSvara.  

Uncommon though it may be, this SadaSiva body is nevertheless accessi ble to humans; it can be visualized and worshiped. We can give specific  visual form to SadaSiva in meditation, impose this form onto some physical  support, and present offerings to it. As we will see, SadaSiva's body of 

116 * ChapterFour    

mantras, imposed onto the linga, serves as the embodiment that the highest,  inaccessible Siva comes to inhabit during daily worship. Sadasiva thereby  stands at the meeting point between ParamaSiva and his human worshipers  in Saiva ritual.  

While material representations of SadaSiva are comparatively rare in  Saiva temples, he does have a form (or forms) that humans may perceive  through a process of visualization (bhavana).1 SadaSiva is most often por trayed as a single divinity with five-faces and ten arms.  

One should meditate that SadaSiva has five faces, ten arms, and three eyes [in  each face]. Crystal in color and calm, he has a crescent moon as his crest, and his  hair is fastened with a snake. His seat is a lion-throne made of mantras, and he  sits atop a white lotus. Ornamented with bracelets, earrings, necklaces, the aus 

picious thread, waistbands, upper-arm bracelets, golden bracelets, and chest bands, he is a lovely, tranquil, smiling sixteen-year-old. In his right hands he  holds trident, axe, sword, thundeibolt, and fire; the mudra of security and the  noose, along with the bell, snake, and hook, are in his five left hands. (KA  4.329-34)  

Each of the five faces can be visualized individually, either as separate vis ages of a single body or as independent figures. In addition, each mantra  is associated with a portion of the body, arranged hierarchically: KANA is  located at the head, TATPURUSA at the mouth, and so on, as Madhava out lined.  

Siva's capacities for action in the world are also instantiated in his six  "limbs" (anga), corresponding to the six aAgamantras. These limbs, like the  rays of the sun, are intrinsic extensions of Siva's being by which he accom plishes his aims.8  

Just as fire and the sun are powerful because of their rays, Siva is likewise invin cible and all-performing because of his limbs, which arise from his inherent na ture (svabhava). The heart (HRD) is existence, and his head (SIRAS) is his lofty  preeminence. His topknot (SDCHA) is his autonomy. His armor (KAVACA) would  be his protective powers. His weapon (ASTRA) is the power by which he annihi lates. The eye (NETRA) is his power of omniscience, which illuminates every thing. Thus the six divine qualities of the creator of the world, Siva, are stated  here. (KA 4.362-65)  

When the body of SadaSiva is visualized and constructed in ritual, these  limbs are superimposed onto it as additional enhancements of his being.  SadaSiva's powers are also specified by the panoply of "weapons"  (ayudha) he carries. According to one typical list, SadaSiva holds in his five  right hands the trident, axe, sword, thunderbolt, and fire, and in his left  hands he holds the snake, noose, bell, mudra of security, and hook (KA  4.332-33). However, Nirmalamani warns us, we should not imagine these 

Summoning the Lord - 117    

to be everyday weapons of violence. Rather, these are weapons of grace;  Siva uses them to destroy the bonds that ensnare the soul (KKDP pp. 100- 101). When visualizing SadaSiva, the worshiper meditates on them not sim ply as physical weapons, but in their inherent form of being (bhutasvarupa),  as aspects of Siva's power.9  

His three-pronged trident is called the three qualities, and the axe is said to be  existence. The sword would be the radiance of his lordship. The thunderbolt is  his indivisibility. The fire is the power of reabsorption, which reduces fetters to  ashes and illuminates the tattvas which lie above mahamaya. Holding the snake  indicates his power to accomplish everything. His noose is the three fetters,  known as maya, karman, and mala. The bell represents undifferentiated sound  (tiada), denoting his mantra-body. The mudra of security is his power to protect  all creatures. His hook represents the rule by which the soul obtains the conse 

quences resulting from previous actions. (KA 4.335-39)  

SadaSiva is the form that, for Saiva theologians, most closely approxi mates the totality of Siva's active presence in the world. His several super imposed layers of mantras and powers successively manifest portions of  Siva's presence: the five faces accomplish the five fundamental activi ties, the six limbs extend his capacities, and the ten weapons enable him to  grant grace. Ultimately, even SadaSiva is a synecdoche for Siva's complete  nature, but it is the most comprehensive such form accessible to human  powers.  

SadaSiva is not the only form in which humans may perceive Siva. As  MaheSvara (the "Great Lord"), Siva takes on many aspects or embodiments  that are also manifest to humans. These aspects are distinct, individual  forms of Siva related to particular aspects of his being or to his specific  exploits in the world, and they are familiar to us through the iconic statu ary of Indian images and through the narrative descriptions of the puranas.10  The Rauravdgama, for instance, lists and describes thirteen typical forms  of MaheSvara: Sukhasana, SomeSa, Somaskanda, Vr§arQdha, Tripurari,  CandraSekhara, Kalahari, Kalyanasundara, Nrttamurti, Bhiksatana, Kankala,  Ardhanari, and Dak^inamQrti.11  

Where SadaSiva is a comprehensive body of Siva, the forms of Mahe Svara are partial embodiments or aspects of Siva's character. Of Mahe Svara's multiple forms, some specialize in emission, others in preservation,  and still others in reabsorption. "First Somaskanda, then Sukhasana, and  Kalyanasundara, CandraSekhara, Gangadhara—these five are called the 'emit ting embodiments' (sr^timiirti). Vr§abhavahana, Ardhanari, Kirafa, VtreSa,  and finally Bhiksatana are the five forms called 'preserving embodi ments.'"12 Forms in which Siva carries out his more destructive activi ties, such as Tripurari and KiQaluiri, represent his "reabsorptive embodi ment." Partial is always inferior to whole, so these individualized forms are 

118 · Chapter Four    

distinctly ancillary to SadaSiva. Forms of Mahesvara are not generally cen tral liturgical objects, but they do serve as iconic representations of Siva  within the scheme of any large Saiva temple. A collectivity of these partial  aspects of Siva's totality, situated at appropriate places within the temple  complex, further specifies his comprehensive character and makes it acces sible to his devotee.  

In addition to these particularized bodily forms by which Siva acts, he  also employs an energy or "instrument" (karcma) to accomplish his ends.  This instrument of unlimited efficacy is known as Sakti: "By means of that  instrument which is Sakti, Siva becomes powerful (sdkta), that is, capable  of accomplishing the five fundamental activities so that the souls may  achieve worldly pleasures and liberation" (TPV 3). Arising intrinsically  from Siva as heat arises from fire, Sakti is essentially one, undifferentiated  and without form. Like Siva, however, Sakti must perform many tasks in a  variegated creation, and to do so she assumes a plethora of appropriate  forms. When things are to be known (jneya), Siva's energy adopts the form  of JiianaSakti; when actions are to be undertaken (karya), it appears as  Kriyalakti. According to one common classification, Sakti has five princi pal, hierarchically ranked forms: ParaSakti, Adisakti, IcchaSakti, Jnana Sakti, and Kriyasakti. In accomplishing the five fundamental activities, the  five brahmamantras are said to have the "form of Saktis." Another group of  eight Saktis act as the governors of the Vidyesvaras, divine agents of Siva.  The thirty-eight kalas, or "portions" of SadaSiva, are Saktis that differenti ate and constitute the active body of Siva's highest manifest form. These  forms of Sakti and other, still more differentiated Saktis are particularized  aspects of a unitary Energy that adapts itself with infinite flexibility to the  many circumstances of its activities.  

This portrait of Siva's bodies and his powers still does not depict com pletely his active presence in the world, since Siva does not always carry out  his activities himself. He often acts through agents (adhikariri), whom he  instigates (prerana) to act on his behalf, as an imperial king assigns lesser  kings to perform the functions of sovereignty in smaller, encompassed por tions of the kingdom. These subordinate lords enact Siva's universal lord ship in specific domains or parts of the world.  

Siva's agents are separate beings, not aspects of Siva. They are distinct  souls whose fetters are almost completely removed, and whose powers of  knowledge and action have been activated or enhanced by their proximity to  liberation, enabling them to cany out the assignment (adhikdra) given them  by Siva. Most powerful among them are the eight Vidyesvaras. These  "lords of lords of kings of kings," as Mrgendragama calls them, and particu larly their leader, Ananta, act as Siva's agents over the entire impure do 

main. "In the pure domain, Siva is called creator; in the impure, Ananta is  the Lord" (KirA vidya 3.27). Each VidyeSvara is presided over or governed  (adhisthita) by one of Siva's eight Saktis. The VidyeSvaras in turn rule over 

Summoning the Lord · 119    

a variety of subordinate lords—MandaIeSvaras, MantreSvaras, Bhuvane svaras, World Guardians, and so on—who exercise sovereignty in more re stricted domains. One group of MandaleSvaras particularly important in ritual  is the group of five KaraneSvaras: Brahman, Vi§nu, Rudra, Mahelvara, and  SadaSiva. These lords govern the domains of the five kalas and appear wher ever the kalas are. diva's lordship is thus differentiated as it extends into  particularized parts of the world.  

Siva's Special Presence  

The specific purpose of invocation is to summon Siva to enter into a partic ular form for the duration of the ritual so that the worshiper may offer his  services. The analogy used most frequently in the dgamas to conceptualize  this process is that of a soul entering a human body. Siva, like the soul, is  essentially consciousness (cit), while the linga, like the body, is composed of  inanimate substance (jada). When properly invoked, Siva enters into the  

transformed linga as a soul penetrates a newly born human body.  Yet this very notion of entrance, implying that Siva might have previ ously been absent, raises a philosophical objection. It seems to contradict  Siva's pervasiveness. As the sages ask Siva in K&mikSgama, "How is it, O  Lord, that one can invoke Siva who is omnipresent? If one acknowledges  invocation, this would contradict his omnipresence" (KA 4.354). Is Siva not  already in the object into which he is summoned? If not, then he would not  be pervasive. But if he is already present, what is the point of invoking him?  How can Siva enter into an object when he is already there?  To solve this apparent dilemma, the dgamas distinguish two degrees of  Siva's presence. Siva is indeed present everywhere, but in some places he  is more present than in others. Invocation is a rite that enhances or manifests  (abhivyakti) Siva's presence in some particular location. It establishes a spe cial or "marked" presence (yiiifta samnidhana) of Siva, or makes him "evi dent" (Svirbhdva) in a linga (MPAVkriya 3.26-29, AA 20.179). It persuades  Siva to "face toward" or to "be favorable toward" (abhimukha, sammukha)  the worshiper. Though Siva is already in the object, invocation in some  sense alters the scope or intensity of his presence.  

To describe this alteration, many Saiva siddhanta texts cite an analogy  comparing invocation to kindling fire in wood.  

As fire, though present in a tree from its root to its tip, may become manifest in  one place, just so the manifestation of consciousness in one place does not con tradict its pervasiveness. Just as fire is made to arise in wood by rubbing it and  so on, Siva is manifested through the power of mantras and through devotion.  (KA 4.355, 352)  

Fire pervades wood in a latent or potential form. Kindling a flame through  friction alters the character of the fire already present from latent to active, 

120 · ChapterFour    

from immanent to manifest. Invocation likewise activates or manifests Siva,  who is already present in the linga as he is present everywhere.  A second analogy, given by the monist author Appayadiksita, concerns  embers whose glow is obscured by a covering of ash. "One may manifest a  heap of burning embers covered with ashes, even though the embers glow  by themselves" (SAC p. 65). Similarly, invocation brings about a change in  the palpability of diva's presence. Blowing away ashes to reveal the burn ing embers does not alter the character of the fire itself. Rather, it makes  the embers evident. It discloses the presence of a fire that was previously  hidden. Invocation likewise reveals to the worshiper the presence of Siva  where before he had been inaccessible to the worshiper's perception.  Invocation, then, is understood as a rite that makes Siva's presence  within the ritual domain "manifest" in two senses of that word. It alters  the character of his presence from latent to active, and it changes the  worshiper's awareness of Siva's presence, disclosing what was previously  concealed.  

Supportsfor Siva  

Considering Siva's all-pervading presence and unlimited potentiality, it is  not surprising that he can manifest his special presence in many different  material forms: not just in icons, but also in pots, flowers, human bodies,  chalk diagrams, fire, and still other objects as well. Kamikagama provides  one list of possible supports for Siva in puja. In addition to various types of  linga, it advises,  

A circular diagram, a painting on cloth, a sketch on a wall, a pedestal-shaped  stone consecrated by mantras, fire, water, guru, tree, and so on, a book on its  stand, in particular a naturally occurring linga-shaped stone or gem, a liftga formed  from sand or some such material, and other objects also are said to be suitable for  use as lingas. According to circumstances, one may prepare any of these individu 

ally in order to worship Siva. (KA 4.270-72)  

Similarly, in initiation Siva becomes present in five different supports. He  is simultaneously in the diagram on the central altar, in a full water-pot, in  the sacrificial fire, in the initiating guru, and finally he comes also to be  present in the initiate.13  

Yet not all supports are equal. Some texts, for instance, distinguish be tween "subtle" (sQksma) lingas, which are internal, mentally constructed  forms, and tangible, "gross" (sthula) ones, which are external and substan tive, evincing a clear preference for the more subtle.  

They say there are two types of lingas, exterior and interior. The exterior lifiga is  tangible, O excellent sages, while the interior one is subtle. Persons devoted to  external rituals and sacrifices, and those gratified by worshiping a tangible linga, 

Summoning the Lord - 121    

are themselves gross. The tangible form is only for those unable to visualize. The  inner linga is not perceptible to the dull-minded person who considers that exterior  reality is everything and that nothing else exists. The unstained, unchanging sub tle linga is just as evident to persons of knowledge, however, as a gross linga made  of some material like mud or wood is to those who are not practiced in yoga.  (.LPur 75.19-22)  

Subtle is always best in the Saiva siddhanta scheme of things. However,  such dismissive characterizations of gross worshipers, as we will see, fail to  take into account the careful yogic visualization and knowledge of Saiva  theology necessary to transform even the most tangible linga into a ritually  suitable embodiment of Siva. Gross may become subtle, Siva-like, through  proper ritual action.14  

The texts generally employ a threefold classification of the physical icons  most suitable for Siva's manifestation: undifferentiated (niskala), differenti ated (sakala), and mixed (sakalani$kala). "That which is undifferentiated is  called the 'linga.' That which is differentiated is termed 'image' (bera). The  linga with faces (mukhalmga) is a mixture of the two and resembles the linga in  height and form" (MM 33.1-2). An austere upright cylinder, the linga is  physically nonpartite.ls An image, by contrast, is an anthropomorphic form  with all the characteristic parts and marks of a body. Intermediate between  these two forms, the linga with faces is in its basic shape and dimensions a  linga, but with one or, more often, five faces partially emerging from the  central shaft in the four cardinal directions. The fifth, upward face is not  discernible to humans of limited visual acuity. The three categories of sup 

ports are ranked according to the now-familiar criteria of emission and reab sorption, whereby the undifferentiated Mga is considered superior and the  fully partite image is inferior.  

Moreover, the texts assert that these different types of icons parallel the  three levels or aspects of Siva's totality.16 The undifferentiated linga, appro priately, corresponds to Siva in his most encompassing, transcendent, and  undifferentiated aspect, Paramasiva. At the other end, the various human like images of Siva, depicting him iconographically as he has acted in the  world and appeared to his devotees, correspond to the level of embodiment  called MaheSvara. In between, where Siva is seen halfway between tran scendence and manifestation as it were, with five faces appearing from  the once-undifferentiated linga, the mukhalinga clearly parallels five-faced  SadaSiva.  

Yet the question of accessibility once again arises. While the agamas cer tainly prefer the undifferentiated linga as the support for Siva par excellence,  and a Saiva temple almost always contains a linga as its liturgical center,  Saiva theology tells us that the ParamaSiva represented by the linga is beyond  human powers of knowing and acting. Conversely, while Saiva puja ap pears to be particularly directed toward SadaSiva as the fullest form of Siva 

122 · Chapter Four    

niskala linga Paramasiva  mixed mukhalinga Sadasiva  

sakala image Mahesvara  Fig. 8. Siva's supports  

accessible to humans, it is quite rare to encounter a mukhalinga as a central  object of worship in a Saiva temple.  

This seeming disjuncture between theology and practice points us to a  central fact of puja as Saiva siddhanta formulates it. The Saiva worshiper  does not worship the object itself as Siva or as representing Siva; he directs  his worship toward it as the physical support for Siva's special presence.  And before any object can serve as proper support for Siva, it must be trans 

formed into a suitably divine, Siva-like state.  

Accordingly, the ritual work of summoning Siva into the linga requires  two main actions, the first constructive and the second more strictly invoca tory. First the worshiper must impose a series of mantras onto the linga and  its pedestal, reconstituting them in the process as a divine body seated atop  a divine throne. The undifferentiated linga is remade into Sadasiva, in effect.  Then and only then, the worshiper may approach Siva in his highest Pa 

rama&iva state, residing in the dvadasanta twelve inches above the wor shiper's crown, and summon him to enter into that ritually prepared em bodiment. Siva in his grace descends, infusing the accessible form of Sada siva with the animating energy of ParamaSiva, which normally lies beyond  our limited powers.  

INVOCATION OF SIVA  

After he has purified himself, the place of ritual, the substances to be of fered, and the mantras, the worshiper shifts his attention from the suitability  of the overall ritual environment to that of the linga, the receptacle of Siva's  presence during daily worship. He has now reached the point where he must  make ready to summon the Lord to the ritual domain.  

Invoking Siva into the linga depends on considerable preparation. Prior to  its use in any Saiva ritual, the linga must have been subjected to a detailed 

Summoning the Lord - 123    

ritual "establishment" (pratiftha) that activates it as a fit support for the divin ity.17 A proper stone is located and carefully examined, worked into the  appropriate form, and ritually infused with the being of Siva. A sequence of  eighteen distinct rites is required for the complete establishment of a linga.  This elaborate procedure transmutes the physical, fabricated object into an  icon worthy of receiving diva's presence, much as initiation enables the  initiate to offer worship directly to Siva. Only after this establishment has  been performed may the linga be used in worship. It must thereafter be phys 

ically purified during each ritual performance, to remove any impurities that  may have infected it since the preceding ritual.  

Yet establishment and purification of a linga are not sufficient in them selves. Before Siva may be summoned, both the linga and its pedestal must  be ritually transformed. During each performance of daily worship, the  worshiper superimposes a "construction" (kalpana.) of visualizations and  mantras onto the stone icon. Over the pedestal is imposed a "divine throne"  (divyasana), and the linga is infused with a "divine body" (divyadeha) com posed of mantras. These superimposed constructions enhance and perfect  the physical forms of pedestal and linga, transfiguring them into divine ones.  

In fashioning these divine forms, the worshiper articulates through his  actions a highly concentrated, differentiated, organized theophany of Siva.  Together the divine throne and the body of mantras embody the entire man ifest cosmos and the multiple aspects through which Siva pervades and ani mates it, compressed as it were onto the physical substratum of pedestal and  linga.  

A ritually constructed body encompassing within its parts the entire dif ferentiated cosmos, of course, hearkens back in India to the Vedic Puru§a,  the cosmic Being whose primordial dismemberment in sacrifice emanated  all the multifarious phenomena of the world. Saiva puranas repeatedly assert  that Siva is that Purusa, that he has usurped—or rather, has always held—the  totalizing role that the Vedic texts claim variously for Purusa, Prajapati, and  Brahman. It is no accident, therefore, that this Puru§a is ritually put back  together again, daily, in Saiva p«/a.18 Only such a comprehensive, divine  form can serve as the appropriate support of Siva's special presence during  daily worship.  

The Divine Throne  

Siva's divine throne is composed of five individual stages. To construct the  throne, the worshiper begins by visualizing, in ascending order, each of  these stages. Distributed hierarchically among the throne stages are the  thirty-one tattvas of the impure domain (aSuddhadhvan), from Earth up to  mdyd, as well as suddhavidya, the lowest constituent of the pure domain.19  The throne also includes within it other divisions of being: the five kalas,124 * Chapter Four    

the multiple worlds (bhuvanas), the letters of the alphabet, and so on.20 The  divine throne, much like the ritualist's body in the rites of initiation and  atmaiuddhi, is a condensed ritual instantiation of the manifest cosmos and  all its constituents.  

Each stage of the throne has one or more inhabiting powers who act as  presiding lords of that stage and all the constituent realities arrayed there.  The worshiper visualizes the form of each divinity and then imposes it onto  the pedestal, using that lord's proper mantra. Through this sequence of visu 

alizations and impositions of mantras, the pedestal is systematically trans formed into a much more comprehensive divine throne fit for the Lord of All  Creation.  

The worshiper himself ascends toward Siva as he prepares the divine  throne. Before he can honor Siva directly, he must first worship the differ entiated aspects of diva's power, the forms through which Siva acts upon  our cosmos. Following the order of reabsorption, which is always the route  to approach Siva, the ritualist passes through all levels of manifest reality  and does homage along the way to all manifestations of Siva's sovereignty.  As each upward stage of the divine throne is constructed, the worshiper  reaches closer to the place where the highest Lord can be summoned.  

The worshiper begins the construction of the divine throne at the floor  stone that supports the pedestal. The throne rests on a "tortoise stone" base,  and Adharasakti (the "Supporting Sakti") is visualized there, "spotless as a  moonbeam, gentle, with four faces and four arms, resembling the milk ocean" (KA 4.292).21 Atop the tortoise stone sits the throne of Ananta  (anantasana), the first stage of the divine throne. The worshiper should here  imagine- the VidyeSvara Ananta: "indigo-colored, crowned with many  hoods, with one face and four arms, hands respectfully folded at his chest,  like a lotus arising from the milk-ocean" (KA 4.293-94).22  

The next stage is the square lion throne (simhasana), with handsome leo nine forms stationed at each of its four corners. These lions embody the four  lordly powers of Ananta: dharma, jnana, vairagya (equanimity), and ai Svarya (dominion). The worshiper invokes each royal power onto the cor responding corner of the throne with its mantra. Also located on the lion  throne in the cardinal directions are four more lions, which represent the  contraries of these powers, adharma, ajnana, avairagya, and anaisvarya.  

The yoga throne (yogasana) surrounds the lion throne. This stage is fre quently omitted, however, and instead two coverings (chadana) are placed  atop the lion throne, at the boundary between pedestal and liiiga. Not coinci dentally, the coverings also serve to separate the impure and pure domains.  According to Kamikagama, these coverings are themselves Saktis, whose  purpose is to bind, liberate, and so on.  

Above the two coverings at the very base of the linga, the worshiper con structs the lotus throne (padmasana), imagined as a horizontally unfolded 

Summoning the Lord - 125    

lotus of eight petals. The petals, AghoraSiva tells us, are the eight Vidye Svaras, and the eight Saktis that govern the VidyeSvaras are situated atop the  petals in circumambulatory order.23 "They are brilliant as the rising sun,  with three eyes, four arms, and crowns of twisted locks adorned with the  crescent moon. With their lotus-hands they hold yak-tail fans, display the  mudras of granting boons and security, and cling to Siva" (KKD p. 89). The  Sakti Vama presides over Ananta on the eastern petal, the Sakti Jye§{ha pre 

sides over Siiksma in the southeast, and so on. Various other constituent  realities may also be imposed onto the petals: the eight yogic powers, the  five elements and three qualities. In the center of the lotus sits Manonmam,  the undifferentiated Sakti of SadaSiva.  

The fifth stage, the stainless throne (vimalasana), is superimposed atop  the lotus throne. The worshiper visualizes three concentric mandalas: the sun  mandala on the tips of the petals, the moon mandala on the stamen tips, and the  fire manda/aontheperimeterofthepericarp.ThesemaniiaZasareidentified with  the three categories of impure tattvas: atman, vidya, and Siva.24 He invokes  onto these mandalas their respective presiding deities, the Karane Svaras Brahman, Vi§nu, and Rudra. Again, the worshiper may also impose  onto the three mandalas other groups of three, such as the three qualities, the  three sacrificial fires, and the three Saktis Jnana, Kriya, and Iccha. Finally,  the worshiper imposes Sakti in her highest form in the middle of the stain 

less throne, completing the construction of the divine throne. "Thus," says  Kamikdgama, "ParamaSiva's throne begins with Sakti and ends with Sakti"  (4.313).

The divine throne, encompassing all constituents of the impure cosmos, be comes in this way suffused with the powers and agents through which Siva  exercises his sovereignty. The throne that supports him in ritual is imbued  with all the energies that support and enact his presence in the world.23  

Body of Mantras  

Only when the divine throne has been fashioned may a divine form sit upon  it. As he has transformed the pedestal, the worshiper now superimposes  onto the lihga a divine body, the body of mantras that is in fact SadaSiva, the  most complete form of Siva humans are able to comprehend and worship. 

126 · Chapter Four    

This body occupies the tattvas of the pure domain (Suddhadhvan), just as  Siva carries out his activities directly in that portion of the cosmos.  The divine body is composed of mantras, unlike the impure, fettered bod ies of humans. It does, however, mirror the divine body that the worshiper  has already imposed onto himself in atmasuddhi. Exactly the same mantras  transform the ritualist's body as enhance the linga. "He should impose man tras on the deity just as he has imposed them onto his own body," directs  Kamikagama (4.349). The resulting bodily parallelism of ritualist and Siva  reinforces the state of relative equality that the two come to share during  worship.  

The worshiper begins by visualizing SadaSiva.26 "When he has thus con structed Siva's throne, the priest with firm mind and restrained faculties  should fill his cupped hands with flowers, and visualize an embodiment"  (AA 20.158). Following meditation verses like the ones I quoted earlier to  describe SadaSiva, the worshiper imaginatively puts together, portion by  portion, a complete portrait of SadaSiva. He visualizes in order each of the  five faces, ten weapons, and so on, then consolidates these parts into a uni fied image. He next transports the visualization into the linga. "When he has  visualized the embodiment, the worshiper should then invoke it onto that  previously described throne of Siva, using the flowers in his cupped hands  and the MORTI mantra" (AA 20.164-65). The visualization is first transferred  into the flowers, which are then scattered atop the linga. The constructed  embodiment flows from the flowers downward into the linga. Simultaneously  reciting the mantra of embodiment, MORTI, the worshiper invokes into the  linga the full form that he has mentally constructed. The visualization infuses  the Mga, supplanting it in the mind of the worshiper. "He removes [the phys ical form of] the linga from his imagination, since the shape of the linga inter feres [with his visualization of Sadasiva]" (KKD p. 99). The physical linga  

has been transformed into the visualized form of Sadasiva.  The worshiper now imposes the five mantras of SadaSiva onto their  proper locations. On each section of the linga, now viewed as the body of  SadaSiva, he places one of the brahmamantras: KANA on the head,  TATPURU$A on the face, and so on in descending order. (See the photographs  of brahmamantranyasa onto the linga, Plate 5.) He next places the thirty eight kalamantras, which further articulate the body of Sadasiva. According  to some texts, he then imposes still more mantras: the angamantras, the man tras of the alphabet, VYOMAVYAPIN, and so on. Whatever mantras have been  placed on the ritualist's body in atmasuddhi should also be used here. Fi nally, the body of Sadaiiva is fully imbued with the powers of mantras, and  the worshiper imposes the VIDYADEHA mantra, the mantra that unifies and  completes this variegated construct.27  

The body of SadaSiva, according to Kamikagama and Kriyakramadyo tika, is made up of two aspects, much as a human body is composed of both 

Summoning the Lord · 127    

a subtle and a gross body. These two must be invoked separately into the  linga. First the worshiper visualizes the "subtle embodiment" (siiksmamurti):  "an embodiment shaped like a staff of emanating energy (tejas), not divided  into parts, pervading the highest bindu which is identical with the siva 

tattva" (KKD p. 95). Next the worshiper visualizes and invokes the body  of mantras known as vidyadeha (literally, "knowledge-body"), the super anthropomorphic body of SadaSiva with five faces and ten arms. "In the  middle of this embodiment, at the top of the ^iva-Iinga, the priest should  impose the vidyadeha that is SadaSiva. This Lord made of pure knowledge  is endowed with the thirty-eight kalas, and has a body formed from the  brahmamantras and the angamantras" (KA 4.326-27). These two aspects of  SadaSiva's embodiment represent two dimensions of diva's active presence.  The subtle embodiment corresponds to diva's undirected potentiality, the  vidyadeha to his active engagement in the world.  

Throughout the construction of diva's divine body, the worshiper follows  the order of emission. He invokes first the undifferentiated subtle embodi ment, then the differentiated vidyadeha. In constructing the vidyadeha, he  begins with ISANA and ends with SADYOJATA, following a descending path.  After placing the five brahmamantras, he imposes the still more differenti ated kaldmantras, again proceeding from the head down. As indicated ear lier, emission is the general order for rites of construction, since ritual con struction is a form of emission.  

The preparation of linga and pedestal for diva's presence reconstitutes  them as divine forms, which together substantiate an entire cosmos, concen trated within their physical support. Figure 9 summarizes the complex set of  impositions that brings this about. First, all tattvas that make up the mani fest world are distributed between the body and the throne. Second, the  forms are imbued with the mantras and powers that preside over these two

domains. Onto the divine throne, composed of the impure tattvas, the wor shiper invokes the multiple Saktis and agents that govern the lower domain.  The divine body is that of SadS£iva, the body of mantras with which Siva  acts directly in the pure domain.  

Ascent of the Mantra  

Complete as they are, the divine body and throne remain inanimate until  Siva himself enters. The central ritual act of invocation remains: to lead  Siva into form. Siva in his highest aspect as animating consciousness must  be summoned to inhabit and enliven his divine body.  

The divine body is a highly differentiated embodiment of Siva's active  powers. Yet in his highest state, Siva is undifferentiated. To enter into this  constructed form, Siva must be led from his undifferentiated realm into a  particularized body.  

When he has constructed this body of powers, the worshiper should make undif ferentiated Siva—the highest cause of this world, constant, eternal, consisting in  knowledge, joy, and pleasure, pervading every tattva, immeasurable and incom parable, free from signifier and signified, whose domain surpasses our powers of  

speech and cognition—specially manifest in a differentiated form, compelling  him there with the SIVA mantra accompanied by the mudras of invocation and so  on. (KA 4.349-51)  

Siva descends from his formless state in the dvadasanta into the differenti ated body superimposed onto the linga. It is a passage by which unknowable,  unworshipable Paramasiva unites with and infuses the more accessible  SadaSiva.  

To effect this passage requires two converse ritual movements: an ascent  by the worshiper to approach Siva, and a descent of Siva into the linga. First,  the worshiper recites Siva's own mantra, rising from his own miilMMra up  to the dvadaSanta. As he recites, the worshiper gradually reunifies the man 

tra and finally merges it into ParamaSiva. This first movement follows the  order of reabsorption traversing the worshiper's body: simultaneously as cending along the central breath channel, reintegrating the differentiated  mantra, and approaching Siva. Second, the worshiper leads Siva together  with the mantra from the dvddasanta back into the worshiper's body, and  from there into the linga. This follows the order of emission. Siva descends  from the dvadaHdnta into the linga and at the same time passes from an undif 

ferentiated state into a manifest form.  

The central mediator in all Saiva invocations is the mantra. Mantras are  effective for summoning divinities, the texts tell us, because of the inherent  connection of signified (vacya) and signifier (vacaka). A mantra is a signi fier, and the divinity to which it refers is its signified. The two are part of the 

Summoning the Lord - 129    

same reality; the mantra is often called the "form" or the sonant aspect of the  divinity that it signifies. Thus, reciting the mantra of a divinity can automat ically render that divinity present.  

When invoking Siva, the worshiper recites the MOLA ("root") mantra, "Om  haum, I bow to Siva." Also referred to as SIVA and PRASADA ("lofty"), this  mantra signifies Siva in his totality.28 For that reason it is the most important  and most powerful of all mantras.  

The worshiper employs the technique called "ascending pronunciation"  (ιuccarana) when reciting the ΜOLA mantra. The term uccarana generally  means "to raise up" and "to pronounce"; its specialized usage here combines  both meanings. This method of pronouncing mantras is used at various  points throughout this and other Saiva rituals, always to reintegrate differen 

tiated unities or to transport things to a higher level of being. In previous  chapters we have seen ascending pronunciation utilized to protect the soul  during atmasuddhi by transporting it upward to the dvadaSanta, and to  merge temporarily the soul of the initiate with ParamaSiva at the conclusion  of nirvanadtksa. It is used also to purify the mantras and to invoke Siva onto  the hands and body during self-purification. According to Appayadlkgita, the  worshiper employs it as well with each offering he makes in daily worship,  as will be discussed in the next chapter. In invocation, ascending pronun ciation enables the ritualist to reunify the mantra within his own body and  finally to merge the reintegrated mantra into the deity that it signifies,  ParamaSiva.  

Initially the MOLA mantra is spread out in twelve or sixteen "portions"  (kolas again) throughout the worshiper's body, distributed along the vertical  axis formed by the central breath channel, and divided by its nodes. Each  mantra portion has a name and a physical form or mark. Each extends a  particular length in the body, has a characteristic color for purposes of visu alization, and is presided over by one of the KaraneSvaras.29 The first mantra  portion, medhd, for instance, extends in the worshiper's body a distance of  twelve fingers between his navel and his heart. It consists in the sound A or  Au of the syllable HAUM (which is the seed-syllable of MOLA) and is the  color of a flaming fire. It is ruled by the lord Brahman. The next mantra  portion, rasa, situated between the heart and the throat, eight fingers in  extent, consists in the sound υ and is governed by Vi§pu. The portions of  the mantra reach all the way up to the dvadasanta, twelve fingers above the  worshiper's head, where ParamaSiva resides. Figure 10 summarizes the  twelve-λαάζ arrangement of the mantra.  

Once again, all constituent tattvas of the manifest cosmos are contained  within this differentiated unity, distributed among the mantra portions. As  usual, they are vertically arranged in hierarchical order. All tattvas of the  impure domain are situated in the three lowest portions, corresponding to  the audible portions of the mantra. The five higher tattvas of the pure do-

Fig. 11. Locations of the twelve kalas 

Summoning the Lord * 131    

main are located in subtler, inaudible mantra portions. According to An antaSambhu, the live kaliis are also contained within the parts of the mantra.  To perform the ascending pronunciation, the worshiper prepares himself  physically and mentally.  

He first makes his body firmly upright and restrains his mind and senses, request ing, "I wish to honor with mantras the Lord Isvara, who is immeasurable, !inde finable, without equal, without pain, subtle, ubiquitous, eternal, unchangeable,  and imperishable." He fills his body with wind via the Ufa and retains it. He places  his flower-filled hands in anjali at the level of his heart, firmly forming the mudrS  of invocation. (SAC p. 61)  

Then he begins to recite the seed-syllable of the mantra. He draws out the  initial H sound of HAUM from his mul&dhara and begins very gradually to  enunciate the portions of the mantra. At the navel, the sound H is united  with the sound A of the medha portion. At the heart, this HA is united into  the υ of rasa. At the throat, the sound M is added. Thus all the audible  sound components of the HAUM seed-syllable are reunited. As the mantra  continues upward, still other subtler, inaudible portions of the mantra are  reintegrated. Stage by stage, the portions of the differentiated mantra are  reabsorbed into their more fundamental unity.  

This ascending movement of reabsorption occurs simultaneously in sev eral dimensions. As the worshiper pronounces the mantra, he directs his  breath upward along the su$umna, dismissing in order the KaraneSvaras along  the way. He moves his hands filled with flowers upward, an outward corre late to the inward motion of the breath. He visualizes each mantra portion  as well: medha is the color of a flame of fire, rasa is like the sun and moon,  and so on. While joining together the portions of the mantra, then, the wor shiper must also unify his actions. Voice, breath, hand gesture, and mental  visualization ascend together. If worship overall requires "the activities of  mind, speech, and body," as Suryabhatta tells us (&SPbh p. 37), invocation  is a rite in which the ritualist must direct all these activities concurrently in  a single direction and toward a single end. (See photograph sequence on  avahana, Plate 6.)30  

The target of these ascending movements is the dvadaianta, the point of  reabsorption (Iaya). ParamaSiva resides there, twelve inches above the ritu alist's body as he is also beyond all limitations of form. When the ascending  pronunciation reaches the άνάάαέάηία, the fully reintegrated mantra is ab 

sorbed into ParamaSiva. The worshiper visualizes Paramasiva becoming  united with the mantra that signifies him. Just as the differentiated portions  of the mantra have been reabsorbed into a unity through ascending pronun ciation, here the mantra itself is reunited with its referent. The fundamental  unity of signifier and signified, mantra and divinity, is restored. 

132 * Chapter Four    

With the union of mantra and Siva, the ascending phase of invocation is  completed. The worshiper has used the MOLA mantra to approach Siva at the  highest level. Pronouncing the mantra upward, he has reunified the differen tiated portions of the mantra and then merged it into ParamaSiva. At the  same time he has fused all his own activities—of mind, speech, and body—  and directed them along the same path of reabsorption. The whole process,  requiring just a single long breath to perform, is itself a compressed meta 

phor of reintegration.  

Siva's Descent into Form  

When Siva and his mantra are reunited, the worshiper next leads Siva into  the form that has been constructed for him. As Narayanakantha puts it, "One  should convey Siva from the dvadaidnta, the place where the sound arising  from the ascending pronunciation of the mantra ceases, into the embodi ment according to the order of emission" (MrAV kriya 3.12). The worshiper  escorts Siva by means of the mantra.  

Siva's descent begins with the worshiper meditating on Paramaliva. "He  imagines Paramaliva: all-accomplishing, undifferentiated, omnipresent,  composed of knowledge and joy, intrinsically radiant" (KKD p. 101). Vis ual imaging of the deity is not possible at this level since ParamaSiva tran scends form; rather, the ritualist can only call to mind the unlimited qualities  of Siva in his highest state.  

Identifying the mantra and Siva, the worshiper leads Siva downward from  the dvadaianta to the forehead, reversing direction along the same path that  the mantra has just ascended. Once again he meditates on Siva, but now in  a more visual form, that of an exceedingly radiant orb. AghoraSiva tells us  that "Siva there resembles a crore of suns, whitening every direction with  pieces of nectar that issue forth" (KKD p. 102). Appayadlksita describes him  at this point as "a thousand flowing moons" (SAC p. 62). Midway between  the dvadaianta and the linga, Siva is neither fully niskala nor fully sakala.  He has a visual form that contrasts him with the formless Paramaliva. Yet  the form is a single, undifferentiated glowing circle, not the highly differen tiated bodily form of Sada&va.  

The worshiper next lowers his hands to the level of his heart and exhales.  Siva passes from the forehead along the breath channel and out of the wor shiper's body through the right nostril. He enters into the flowers held in the  worshiper's hands. Reciting the HRD mantra, the worshiper places the flowers  atop the linga, and Siva enters into the divine body constructed for him, de scending from the brahmarandhra of the embodiment to its heart. Siva is  now embodied as SadaSiva, in a differentiated divine body comprised of  mantras, yet infused too with the presence of Paramasiva. 

Summoning the Lord · 133    

Once Siva is fully present in the linga, the worshiper immediately acts to  keep him there. "He establishes him with the mudra of establishment,  makes him present with the mudra of presence, and restrains him with the  mudra of restraint He declares, 'Welcome to you, O Great God.' And he  imagines the reply of the lord, 'Greetings, my child'" {KKD pp. 103-4).  The worshiper then humbly requests that Siva stay: " Ό Lord, protector of  all the worlds, please remain present in this linga until worship is completed,  out of your love (sampriti)'" (KKD p. 104). Even after the elaborate invoca tory work he has performed, the Saiva worshiper still regards Siva's pres 

ence in the linga not as a matter of ritual compulsion, but as a manifestation  of benevolent disposition, of Siva's "love." He then offers Siva the ritually  prepared arghya water of hospitality, the first of many services he will per form for the manifest Lord before him  

Siva's Two Levels Reunited  

The particular task of invocation, we have seen, is to bring Siva, who is  described theologically as formless and without limit, into a limited form  through which the ritualist may worship him. This descent of Siva is possi ble because Siva has more than one level of being. In his highest state, Siva  is inaccessible to human powers. But Siva has a secondary level, through  which he engages in activities and by which he comes within the range of  our knowledge and action. Sadagiva, Siva's body of mantras, is the most  comprehensive form of Siva at this secondary level.  

The rite of invocation treats these two aspects of Siva's being as onto logically separate entities, then reunifies them within the linga. The first set  of ritual actions transforms the linga and pedestal, the physical supports  of Siva's presence, into divine forms appropriate to Siva. The worshiper  superimposes onto the linga a differentiated body of mantras, the precise  form of SadaSiva. This complete embodiment of Siva's secondary level  serves as the form or body that Siva will inhabit during worship. The second  set of rites summons Siva to enter into this form. The worshiper uses the  MOLA mantra, reintegrated and finally merged into Parama&va, to lead Siva  from his highest, undifferentiated state into the limited, particularized body  of mantras. Like a soul entering a body, Siva inhabits and animates the di 

vine body of mantras that the ritualist has constructed for him.  From Siva's point of view, this entry into form entails an apparent dimin ishment. Siva descends from his undifferentiated, all-pervading, formless  ParamaSiva state into a differentiated, limited embodiment as SadaSiva. The  diminishment is only apparent, however, since any subtraction from infinity  leaves infinity as its remainder. And from the perspective of the human wor shiper, Siva's descent enhances his presence. From an immanent but un-134 · Chapter Four    

knowable and unworshipable divinity, Siva becomes accessible to the wor shiper's powers of knowing and acting. It is this special presence of Siva in  the linga that makes possible all subsequent acts of worship. Siva is made  fully manifest, and the worshiper may now begin to offer his services of  devotion.  

COMMON GROUND  

Saiva daily worship consists, at its core, in a series of transactions between  a human worshiper and the god Siva. Yet in the normal course of things,  such transactions appear nearly impossible. The distance between human  and god seems insuperable. The human worshiper is a soul encrusted with  fetters that seriously impede his power of knowing and acting, and the soul  is bound within an impure body that is a kind of congealment of its fetters.  Siva, by contrast, is in his highest state utterly transcendent. Formless, not  constrained by any of the limitations that affect humans, Siva is beyond all  human capacities of knowledge and action.  

Fortunately, there exist ritual means to bridge this gap. In the two preced ing chapters, I have discussed the procedures through which Saiva daily  worship reduces the difference in status between the worshiper and Siva,  thereby enabling them to engage in direct relations with one another. These  processes are, strictly speaking, merely necessary preparations for the rites  of homage that follow. Yet in another sense they are central to the ritual.  They articulate and enact fundamental metaphysical propositions of Saiva  siddhanta, which organize the world of ritual as well as the world itself.  

In daily worship, two converging processes of transformation bring the  worshiper and Siva from their very divergent initial states to meet on an  equivalent plane of being. The worshiper first transfigures his own body,  through the rite of atmasuddhi, into a body of mantras like that of Sadasiva.  In the process, he enacts the passage by which his soul "becomes a Siva" in  liberation. After transforming himself, the ritualist summons Siva to enter  the linga prepared for him. He first superimposes onto the linga a body of  mantras mirroring his own, and then he uses the MULA mantra to lead Siva  from his highest, transcendent state into this body. The formless, inaccessi ble ParamaSiva becomes embodied as Sadasiva, a form of Siva that can be  meditated on and worshiped.  

These converging paths of transformation, as Figure 11 illustrates, corre spond to the orders of reabsorption and emission, respectively. The ritualist  moves from outside the temple into the central sanctum. As he does so, he  gradually attains a higher state of purity. In the rite of self-purification he  systematically reabsorbs all the impure constituents of his body into their  pure sources, a process that parallels the long-range passage of his soul  toward liberation through the gradual removal of fetters. While invoking

Siva, the worshiper again follows the path of reabsorption to approach Siva,  first in constructing the divine throne and then in the ascending pronuncia tion of the MOLA mantra. Siva, on the other hand, descends from the dvada Mnta into the linga according to the order of emission. In this descent, Siva    

passes from the undifferentiated niskala state to a particularized sakala one,  from formlessness to embodiment, from completely subtle to relatively  gross.  

Through these two procedures, the worshiper and Siva are able to en counter one another on common ground, in a temporary condition of rela tive equality. No mediator—animal, human, or divine—is necessary, since  the distance between the two parties has been ritually negated. In temple  

worship performed on behalf of others, the priest capable of such self-trans formation acts as mediator for those who wish to make offerings to the Lord  but who are not able (because not initiated) to engage in direct transactions  with Siva. The worshiper who performs p&ja on his own behalf meets with  and makes his offerings directly to Siva.  

This pattern of daily worship, by which the worshiper and Siva follow  converging paths to meet on a common ritual plane, parallels the modified  dualistic metaphysics of Saiva siddhanta and contrasts with both monist  schools such as Advaita Vedanta and more bhakti-onented dualist schools.  Ritual procedures do not negate the fundamental separateness of the wor shiper and Siva but do diminish the adventitious differences between them.  

As we have seen, Saivas presume an ontological separation between souls  and Siva, both before and after liberation. Even when the soul becomes an  autonomous Siva through moksa, it remains distinct from Siva. Similarly, 

136 · Chapter Four    

the ritual transformations of daily worship do not bring about any merging  or unification of worshiper and Siva, as monist worshipers suppose. Siva  and worshiper meet as separate beings in the domain of ritual.  

We have seen as well that bound souls are distinguished from Siva by the  fetters that constrain them. The passage of a soul to liberation gradually  removes these fetters, and in so doing it effaces the differences between the  soul and Siva. In liberation, the soul becomes equal in power and purity to  Siva. The transformations of soul and Siva performed in daily worship sim 

ilarly decrease the discrepancy that normally exists between the two. Puri fied Saiva worshiper and embodied god approach one another as separate  but relatively equal, unlike in the bhakti schools that presume and extol an  eternal and unbridgeable hierarchy between the two. (Saivas admit, how ever, that the condition of equality between soul and Siva can only be rela tive, never absolute, in ritual and in liberation.) The ritual transformations  effected through atmaSuddhi and invocation enable the soul and Siva to  meet face to face in worship as in liberation. 

## 5 Relations of Worship  

' T HE WORSHIP of Siva consists in delivering over to a Siva-Iinga or the like  purified substances according to one's own volition, with faith, and accom panied by activities of mind, speech, and body, such as particularly medita tions, mantra recitations, and mudrds, and accompanied also by the various  auxiliaries of worship preceding and following it" (§SPbh p. 37). As in  many Hindu schools of ritual, the Smva author Suryabhana defines piija by  its core action: the "delivering over" (samarpana) or "presentation" (dana)  of substances to the god. He regards other ritual actions such as self-purifi cation and invocation, which have occupied our attention in previous chap ters, as "auxiliaries" that establish the setting in which the transactions be tween human and god may take place. The central and irreducible act of  worship occurs only when the worshiper presents his "services" (upacara)  or tokens of homage to Siva.  

As with any gift, there are three main participants in the presentation of  piija: the giver, that which is given, and the recipient. The worshiper, as  donor, gives substances and services to Siva, the recipient. For Saiva  siddhanta philosophy, the three parties in the transaction here are, at the  same time, the three fundamental categories of the universe. The worshiper  who makes the gifts is an embodied soul (pasu), the substances given to  Siva are objects of the material cosmos (pasa), and the recipient is the Lord  Siva (pati), taking up temporary residence in the linga. When the worshiper  presents offerings to the linga, it is soul, substance, and Siva that are brought  into relation with one another.  

The transactions between the worshiper, the offerings, and Siva during  daily worship reflect and express the basic relationships between the three  categories of being. For Suryabhatta, the essential character (svabhava) of  each participant determines the role it assumes during worship. Siva is the  highest Lord, and therefore he is always "to be served" by other conscious  beings. So in piija, Siva receives the prestations of those dependent beings.  The worshiper is a bound soul, inferior and subservient to his Lord, and  consequently he should always remain "fixed in service" toward Siva. Even  though the rites of atmasuddhi and invocation have reduced the difference  between worshiper and god, their fundamental hierarchical relation persists.  In daily worship the worshiper instantiates in a whole series of offerings and  actions his attitude of respectful service. And the offerings themselves are  the impure, inanimate derivatives of maya, which "should be delivered over  to Siva's feet" (SSPbh p. 37). 

138 · Chapter Five    

In its simplest formulation, then, Saiva siddhanta portrays the transac tions of nityapuja as an enactment of the most fundamental relations of the  cosmos.  

THE THREE CATEGORIES, INTERRELATED  

While Sflryabhatta is basically correct in his summary, he oversimplifies both  the ontological relationships between the three categories of being and also  the transactions established between the three participants in worship. The  material world, of which worship offerings are a part, cannot simply be  "delivered over" to Siva. Siva is pure; the material world derived from maya  is impure. Siva's essential nature is cit; the material world is made up of  jada. The relationship between Siva and substance is too problematic to  allow a simple, unmediated delivery of one to the other. Nor can the wor shiper act solely and simply as a servant to Siva. As a bound soul partaking  of both consciousness and material fetters, his situation is too ambiguous to  allow him the passivity and simplicity of service; his relation to Siva is more  complex than that. In both cases, there are complications in the relations  between categories of Saiva metaphysics that we must examine more  closely, both as a theoretical concern of jMna and as a practical matter for  the krtya of daily worship.  

Siva and the Material World  

As I have described previously, Saiva metaphysics posits a firm ontological  separation between Siva and the material world. Siva, whose essential form  is consciousness (cit), is an animate being whose powers of agency are not  constrained by any obstruction. The material world, composed of inanimate  substance (jada), is inert stuff that acts only when acted upon by some force  or agency outside itself. Siva is essentially one, integral; the material world  is a multifarious combination of mixed constituents. Siva is eternal and tran quil; the material world restlessly oscillates between moments of emission  and reabsorption, creation and destruction. The two categories might appear  to have nothing in common. Yet they inhabit the same universe and neces sarily become involved with one another.  

Saiva philosophy displays two seemingly opposite views concerning the  relationship of Siva with the material world. On the one hand, the texts  frequently stress his aloofness from matter. Siva is, and always has been,  free from all blemishes. As the only being "liberated without beginning"  (anadimukta), Siva has never been contaminated by any of the fetters that  condemn other souls to lifetimes of bondage. Siva surpasses (atita) or tran 

scends the constituents of material being and thereby maintains his state of  utter purity. 

Relations of Worship · 139    

On the other hand, texts just as often point to diva's ubiquity and to his  all-performing agency. Siva pervades (vyapti) the cosmos; he is omnipres ent. If he is present everywhere, Siva could hardly remain outside all mate rial creation. Similarly, Siva is the agent (Jcartr) of all creation. Through his  activities of emission, preservation, and reabsorption, Siva sets the ele ments of the material cosmos in motion. Not simply present in creation,  Siva appears to be its most essential controlling agent, the instrumental  cause of the material world.  

By turns Siva is said to be aloof and pervasive, outside and within the  cosmos. He seems to take a hands-off approach to the created universe, and  yet also to involve himself intimately in its most basic processes. How can  Saiva siddhanta reconcile these two apparently contradictory depictions of  Siva's relation to the world of inanimate substance? Does he participate in  it, or does he not?  

The simplest answer to this apparent dilemma locates it as yet another  example of Siva's incomprehensibility to bound souls. Siva, after all, "sur passes the purview of speech and mind." It is a measure of his greatness that  he encompasses categories or attributes that we with our limited powers of  knowledge regard as antithetical. As his exploits narrated in the puranas also  attest, Siva MaheSvara can be simultaneously auspicious (ίινα) and fear some (raudra), ascetic and erotic, male and female, and so on. Both purity  and pervasion, separation and participation are true attributes of Siva; the  habits of thought by which we see these as incompatible with one another  result from our bondage. The problem, to put it most simply, lies in our  intellects, not in Siva's character.  

This answer does not fully satisfy the Saiva siddhantins, for they develop  in greater detail two other theological solutions to the problem of Siva's  participation in matter. These two solutions focus not on the epistemic limi tations of paSus, but rather on ontological differentiations within the two  categories of pati and pasa. In both cases, these differentiations play a me diating role; they introduce hierarchized gradations into otherwise distinct  categories and thereby enable Siva to participate and not participate in mat ter simultaneously.  

The first solution has to do with the emanating nature of Siva's lordship.  As discussed in the preceding chapter, Siva employs many instruments and  agencies to cany out his multifarious activities in the world. He makes use  to begin with of the seventy million mantras. To perform the five fundamen 

tal activities, for instance, he uses the five brahmamantras that together  constitute the five faces of Sadasiva. Sakti acts as his "instrument" (karana),  taking on many differing forms according to what needs to be done. Siva  also engages the assistance of other powerful beings—VidyeSvaras, Ka 

raneSvaras, World Guardians, and others of that ilk—to administer his com mands in other domains. This theological portrait of Siva's emanating lord-

140 · Chapter Five    

ship is best illustrated in the ritual spaces constructed by the worshiper in  rlityapiija. Siva sits at the center of these constructions, amidst concentric  circles of increasingly active, differentiated entourages. Siva is still; he acts  through these other agencies, which are "drawn out" from him.  

By postulating this heuristic distinction between Siva and the instrumen talities that emanate from him, Saiva siddhanta is able to describe Siva as  simultaneously "peaceful" (santa) and "all-accomplishing" (sarvakartr). In  himself Siva remains absolutely aloof from material creation, a transcendent  ParamaSiva. Yet to cany out his far-reaching actions in the world, he em ploys mediating powers and beings, through which he pervades and acts  upon every part of the material cosmos, a fully engaged immanent divinity.  

This first solution to the paradox of Siva's presence in the world is impor tant, as we have seen, in the rite of invocation, but it does not have major  consequences for the offering of worship. It is the second solution that has  greater bearing on the services.  

The second solution has to do with gradations of purity and impurity  within the material cosmos. Here we must begin with the principle of emis sion and reabsorption, as outlined in Chapter 2. Generally, we saw, the path  of emission moves in a direction of greater differentiation, less subtlety, and  greater impurity; the path of reabsorption leads toward integrity, subtlety,  and purity. This can be seen clearly in the case of the constituents of the  material cosmos, the tattvas. At one end of the scale, undifferentiated maya  is completely pure; at the other end, the five Elements (bhiitas) are ex 

tremely impure. The world is made up of a hierarchy of things of greater and  lesser purity.  

The notion of graduated purity reveals a possibility. If there are portions  or states of being within the created cosmos that are completely pure, then  Siva could participate there directly without compromising his own immac ulate nature. Saiva siddhanta, in fact, does envision such domains. For in stance, the agamas speak of two separate paths along which the thirty-six  tattvas are emitted: the "pure path" (Suddhadhvan) and the "impure path"  (aiuddhadhvan). The pure domain is made up of the source-substance  mahamaya and the five constituents emitted from that source; the impure  domain, in which our world is located, consists of the source-substance  maya and the thirty-one emitted tattvas. (See Figure 1.) In the pure domain,  say the texts, Siva acts directly, without intermediary. In the impure do main, however, Siva assigns the Vidyesvara Ananta and other agents to  carry out his lordly functions. Similarly, beings of greater powers and few  fetters such as the VijSanakevalas and Pralayakevalas, who generally oc cupy the pure domain, are said to receive initiation directly from the hand  of Siva, while we humans of many fetters and lowly powers, living in the  impure domain, receive only a mediated initiation from Siva. For the initia tion of humans, Siva uses the guru as his intermediary. 

Relations of Worship · 141    

While worship remains the action of a human being offering substances  and services derived from maya, the principle of hierarchized purity is  nonetheless crucial. If Siva participates more directly in domains of greater  purity, it follows that objects and services, when purified sufficiently, may  be offered to and received by Siva directly. Consequently, what appears  initially as an insurmountable ontological separation of Siva and matter may  be recast in ritual as a practical problem. Siva does not remain completely  aloof from all matter, only matter that is too impure. The worshiper's con cern, accordingly, is to make sure that all the material offerings he makes to  Siva are suitably pure. He must ritually transform them into amfta ("nec 

tar"), substances imbued with the quality of "Siva-ness." Then Siva may  "enjoy" them directly.  

Siva and Bound Souls  

At its most fundamental, the relationship between Siva and bound souls is  one of absolute hierarchy. Siva is the One, the absolute Lord, without a  second. Humans by contrast are beings of limited powers, veiled from a  correct apprehension of the nature of things. Siva is lord over all divinities;  how much more so is he master over bound souls.  

This hierarchical relationship determines a basic attitude of devotion and  subservience toward Siva on the part of humans. For Suryabhatta, these atti tudes are duties (viniyoga) deriving from the fundamental character of the  two categories pati and paSu. One should fix one's attention on Siva through  yogic concentration because Siva is "to be meditated upon" and the human  being is "to be meditator." One should make one's offerings of worship  because Siva is by nature "to be served" and the bound soul "should be  directed toward his service" (SSPbh p. 37). But our engagement with a fig 

ure so central to our destiny is necessarily more complex than Suryabha{ta's  emphasis on difference in rank would suggest.  

This becomes clear when one looks at stotras addressed to Siva. Stotras  are hymns of praise, originally the spontaneous poetry uttered by gods,  sages, and seers when in the manifest presence of Siva, and now employed  as regular, repeated panegyric during puja and other Saiva rituals. Because  these stotras exemplify the way humans should address Siva, they serve as  a good precis of the basic relationship between bound souls and Siva, which  underlies the services of daily worship.  

Consider the paradigmatic case of the great sage Matanga.1 Once his med itations were interrupted by the sweet hum of wind whistling across a hol low in a bamboo stalk, where a bee was making its home. Thinking that  Siva too might find the sound pleasing, he cut down the stalk and made it  into a flute, which he then played with great feeling. Matanga's desire to  please his lord does not appear motivated by any specific aim, at least not 

142 · Chapter Five    

initially. Suddenly Siva "displayed his own bodily form" to the amazed  flautist, much as Siva comes to inhabit a manifest form in piija. "Falling to  the earth like a stick, Matanga worshiped his feet, and overcome with a feel ing of devotion toward Siva, he sprinkled those feet with the pure water of  his own eyes. And then the sage began to praise Siva" (MPA vidya 1.13- 

14). Matanga's first response was a mixture of submissive homage, dutiful  hospitality, and devotional joy. Just as one should offer guests "foot-water"  (padya) to refresh them after a journey, he washed Siva's feet—but here  with foot-water from the tears of his own effusive happiness.  

Then Matanga expressed his praise to his lord in seven impromptu stotras  (MPA vidya 1.15-21). He begins by declaring Siva's superiority over all  other divinities: "O Blessed One, Lord over what has been and what is to be!  Ruler over Brahman, Vi$nu, and Indra! The divinities in the sky, filled with  the excellence they have received through your grace, sing your praise."  This common trope of Saiva panegyric relies on the human analogy of king 

ship: Siva is to other gods as a human king is to his subjects. As their lord,  Siva receives their praises and dispenses grace to the gods, just as he does  with us.  

Matanga goes on to acknowledge Siva's ubiquity: "You completely per vade the creatures of the world, both immobile and mobile." Though Siva  stands before him in a limited bodily form, Matanga does not forget the com pleteness of Siva's presence in the world and the limitless extent of his  agency. Similarly, the worshiper should look beyond Siva's synecdochic  presence in the linga to the full character of Siva revealed in the actions of  invocation.  

Finally Matanga speaks of Siva's penetrating benevolence.  

Merely by recalling the power of your lotus-feet, even sinners have all their sins  destroyed and come to enjoy success; how much more so wise sages whose minds  are fixed upon you, who have relinquished all sins, who are disciplined, whose  desires are extinguished, who are free from passion and from sorrow, and who  have passed beyond emotional agitations. And for that matter, men have also  obtained what they desired as boons.  

Siva is, of course, the one who grants all grace, and he may even favor—as  the commentator Ramakantha here points out—sinful demons like Andhaka  and Ravana (MPAV vidya 1.17). But often, as here, the praise is two-sided:  it both acknowledges Siva's generosity and seeks to persuade Siva to extend  that grace in the supplicant's direction. Matanga concludes by describing his  previous sorry state and pointing to the ripening of fetters already brought  about through Siva's grace, and he makes an earnest request for Siva's con 

tinued favor.  

I was one of small fortune, filled with sorrow and abandoned by happiness. My  own sin was great and hard as diamond, O Lord. But your powers are strong in 

Relations of Worship - 143    

rescuing souls from samsara; they have taken up my store of sin and made it soft  and light. So therefore, Lord, may you grant my wish.  

There was no compulsion in this request. But Siva was pleased by Matanga's  outpouring and allowed the sage to request a favor. Matanga requested  sivajnana, and Siva proceeded to deliver the discourse that has been handed  down by Saivas as the MataAgaparameivardgama.  

The worshiper should repeat these same seven verses, AghoraSiva tells  us, along with other stotras, near the end of daily piijd, when he too wishes  to praise Siva's greatness (KKD p. 123). As the model sage Matanga did, the  worshiper may, through his desire to please Siva, his submission, his hospi 

tality, his recognition of Siva's full nature, and his praise, persuade Siva to  look favorably on him. Through daily worship, one may even hope to re ceive the boon of SivajMna.  

THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCE  

The worshiper and Siva are not the only ones who must be prepared for the  transactions of worship. All participants in the ritual domain undergo a pro cess of purification and transformation. The agamas speak of "five purifica tions" the worshiper must perform prior to offering worship: purification of  

himself, of the place, of the mantras, of the linga, and of the substances. He  purifies and protects the place of worship by constructing fortifications with  mantras to keep away intruders. He purifies the mantras by reciting them in  an ascending manner (uccdrana), removing them from contact with impure  substances and transporting them to the higher level of pure tattvas.  

He must likewise prepare and purify the substances (dravyaiuddhi) to  be offered as services before they may be received by Siva. In their "natu ral" state, substances are considered highly impure and completely inappro priate for offering to Siva. It is necessary, therefore, to employ ritual means  to purify them, to remove them from their material origins and transform  them into "nectar" (amrta), the undying food of the gods. The worshiper  carefully selects only excellent specimens of each substance and submits  them to a complex ablution that metamorphoses them into nectar suitable  for Siva, imbued with the quality of Siva-ness. (As will be shown in the  discussion of pure remains, the substances are transmuted still again when  Siva consumes them.) To illustrate this transforming process, let us follow  one category of substance, flowers, as they are readied for presentation to  Siva. The same scheme applies, with some variations, to most substances  used as services.  

Kdmikagama provides detailed instructions for the initial selection and  collection of flowers for worship (KA 5.40-65). To begin, only flowers  from certain sources should be used. "One should worship with flowers  grown in one's own garden, or grown in the forest, or with flowers pur-144 · Chapter Rve    

chased for money, and not otherwise" (KA 5.65). Even among these, only  certain species are appropriate for ritual. The text lists thirty suitable types  of white flowers, thirteen red, eight yellow, and one species of blue flower;  it lists as well nine types to be avoided. The text also ranks the suitable  flowers, with the blue lotus considered the finest. Some types are particu 

larly appropriate for worship during the day, while others should be pre sented only at nighttime services.  

Of the proper species, only perfect specimens at the peak of their bloom  are acceptable.  

One should exclude all flowers that have been eaten by hair-lice, those which are  broken or wilted, flowers that have fallen by themselves, and those that are dam aged. One should not offer worship using unopened buds, nor should one present  immature flowers to the god. (KA 5.60-61)  

Fragrance is another important criterion, since flowers, consisting of Earth,  must please Siva's sense of smell. The worshiper should not select flowers  that lack scent or have an unpleasant odor, and he should not use flowers  that have been smelled previously. Finally, in gathering and carrying them,  he must not allow the flowers to be polluted by the touch of an unbathed  person or by an impure container.  

Given these rather strict guidelines, it may be impossible for the wor shiper to procure suitable flowers. He is then allowed to make substitutions.  

If flowers are unavailable, one may offer leaves. If leaves are also unavailable,  one may present fruits. If fruits are also unavailable, then grass, shrubs, and  herbs are acceptable. But if herbs as well are unavailable, the god may be wor shiped with devotion (bhakti) alone. (KA 5.61-63)  

Within the domain of maya, one should select the best available objects for  offering, but when only inferior substances are available, these are still pref erable to none at all.  

The ritualist has these most excellent flowers brought to the place of wor ship and placed with the other offerings. But no matter how "pure" sub stances may be in their natural state, they are not yet fit for offering to Siva.  Flowers, water, sandalwood paste, incense, and the rest are, after all, deriv atives of the source-substance maya and therefore inherently impure. Nir malamani puts it this way:  

Aren't substances like flowers, water, and the like pure in and of themselves?  They are not These substances are derivatives of maya arising in the impure  worlds, and they are not worthy for Siva's consumption because they do not have  Siva-ness (iivatva). Nor may it be argued that they do have Siva-ness because  they are connected with all-pervading Siva. Siva does not blend with substances,  as a drop of water does not merge with a lotus leaf. (KKDP p. 80) 

Relations of Worship * 145    

To raise his offerings out of their impure origins in the realm of mdya, the  worshiper must perform dravyasuddhi, a purification of the ritual sub stances that transforms them into nectar. This, says Mrgendragama, renders  

them suitable (yogyata) for Siva's consumption (AijrA kriya 3.32-33).  To carry out the purification, the worshiper first prepares a special ritual  concoction called arghya ("reception-water")· The term arghya literally  means "valuable," that which is to be honored, and it refers most commonly  to the water offered as a respectful reception to a guest. In Saiva ritual,  arghya is employed in a similar fashion: one presents reception-water as an  offering of hospitality to Siva and other divinities who come as "guests" to  one's temple or shrine. But arghya also has for the Saivas a special purify ing capacity, and therefore they use it to prepare other substances as well  that are to be presented to Siva.2  

The worshiper begins his preparation of arghya by first purifying the  arghya vessel with the ASTRA mantra. As the substance to be contained in it  will be highly pure, it is necessary that the container itself be without impu rity. AghoraSiva takes this concern one step further by directing that the  vessel should be made of gold or some other excellent material (KKD p.  79). ("Made of gold, silver, copper, or clay, free of flaws, and round," Nir malamani pragmatically specifies.) The worshiper then fills the pot with  pure water, reciting the HRD mantra.  

Water always has a certain capacity to cleanse, but here the addition of  other substances and mantras enhances its purifying power. The worshiper  first adds a set of substances, most often milk, tips of ku£a-grass, rice, flow ers, sesame, barley, and white mustard.3 Then he imposes onto the mixture  a sequence of mantras that follow the paradigm of invocation: ASANA  (throne), ΜΟΚΠ (embodiment), the five brahmamantras, VIDYADEHA (body  of mantras), NETRA (eye), MOLA, the six angamantras, then again MOLA,  brahmamantras, and angamantras. He recites here all the mantras that, else where, bring about Siva's presence in the linga or other support. The mantras  infuse the water with Siva's powers.  

Like all highly pure things in the world, the arghya must be protected  from the possibility of contamination. The worshiper protects it with ASTRA  (weapon) and surrounds it with KAVACA (armor). Finally he "pleases" it  with the cow mudrd, which finally transforms the arghya into the highest  nectar.  

With arghya ready at hand, the ritualist proceeds to purify the other sub stances. He first sprinkles a bit of arghya on his own head, restoring his own  state of purity, and then sprays the offerings with arghya, reciting the pro tective mantras ASTRA and KAVACA. Next he recites HRD, protects the offer ings once again with KAVACA, and then forms with his hands the cow mudra  (dhenumudrd). The cow mudrd, consistently employed when transforming  substances into nectar, imitates the udders of a cow; Nirmalamani suggests 

146 · Chapter Five    

it is like "nectar flowing from the forehead to the ten channels near the ten  fingers" (KKDP p. 79).4 At this moment, the worshiper has successfully  transformed the flowers and other substances into nectar, suitable for offer ing to Siva.  

Food destined for diva's consumption undergoes a somewhat different  purificatory procedure. Perhaps because Siva will ingest it, food receives a  more elaborate purification than materials meant for Siva's exterior use. As  with flowers, the worshiper must be careful in his choice and preparation of  the foodstuffs. The Kamikagama gives strict guidelines not only for procur 

ing the best possible ingredients, but also for the kinds of pots fit for cook ing Siva's meal and for mantras that should be recited during the cooking.  When the cooking is completed, however, it is not enough simply to sprin kle the food with arghya; instead, the worshiper must perform upon it a  "fourfold consecration" (catussamskara).  

As its name suggests, the fourfold consecration is a set of four purifying  rites, always deployed in the same order: "divine glance" (niriksana), "sprin kling upward" (proksana), "striking" (tadana), and "sprinkling downward"  (abhyuksana). One uses this consecration for a variety of purposes in Saiva  ritual, such as purifying the pots that are to hold Siva's bathwater, purifying  the fire pit when preparing for a fire oblation, and purifying the ghee that is  offered into the fire. Here the worshiper begins his consecration of the  cooked food by touching the thumb and ring finger of his right hand to his  eyes, pronouncing the MOLA mantra, and gazing at the food with the result ing "divine glance."5 He next sprinkles some arghya water upward, his  palm raised, and recites ASTRA; then he strikes the food with his index fin 

ger, again reciting ASTRA; and finally he sprinkles arghya downward, his  palm this time toward the ground, and recites the KAVACA mantra. To gether, the four consecrating acts turn the food into naivedya, food worthy  of offering to a divinity.  

One text provides an explanation of the metamorphosis effected by the  fourfold consecration in theological terms.  

One should know that the divine glance distinguishes between what is inert (Jada)  and what is animate (cit) through diva's own power of vision. Sprinkling upward  renders an object suitable [for offering to Siva] by separating it from jada. Striking  brings about the manifestation of cit in that object, as the striking of stones [man 

ifests sparks], and sprinkling downward nurtures these sparks still more.6  

The transformation of normal food into naivedya, then, requires that the  worshiper remove it from its normal status as inert matter and infuse into it  the animating energy of consciousness. This process instills "Siva-ness"  into the substance, since Siva's own nature is consciousness, and thereby  makes it suitable for intimate contact with Siva.  

There is yet one final stage in this transfiguration of worldly substance. At  the moment they are presented to Siva, some offerings need to be raised up 

Relations of Worship · 147    

to a still higher level. Here the worshiper employs the method of "ascending  pronunciation" (uccarana), which he has used previously in invoking Siva  into the linga. Taking the flowers, food, or other object in his hand, he recites  the MOLA mantra in a gradually rising manner, reabsorbing the constituent  parts of the mantra as he raises it. At the same time, he directs the breath  along the sufumna in an upward direction and correspondingly raises the ob ject in his hands. The movement follows the path of reabsorption, bringing  the offering toward a reintegration with Siva.  

According to Appayadiksita, for instance, the first four offerings presented  to Siva must each be transported upward to its own appropriate level. Be ginning from the miilMhara, the worshiper should raise foot-water (padya)  up to the level of the eyebrows (corresponding to the Iharatattva), sipping water (acamana) to the level of the aperture at the top of his head (which  corresponds to the sadasivatattva), and arghya all the way to the dv&da santa, twelve fingers above the crown (corresponding to the sivatattva).  Finally, says Appayadiksita, he raises flowers up to Siva, residing in the  dvadasanta, and imagines that this offering brings him into communion  with Siva (SAC p. 68). Just as the technique of ascending pronunciation  enables the worshiper to approach Siva and summon him into the linga dur ing invocation, here it allows him to transport offerings to the point where  Siva may partake of them.  

The route substance takes to become suitable for Siva's enjoyment, then,  is one of progressive purification and transfiguration. Starting with careful  selection of the materials to be offered, the worshiper purifies them with  arghya or the fourfold consecration, turning them into amrta, and finally  

raises them up to Siva with an ascending pronunciation of Siva's own man tra. In the process, objects that are initially inert substance attain the quality  of Siva-ness and are therefore eligible for presentation. In daily piija, the  worshiper ritually resolves the theological problem of Siva's participation in  matter by transforming matter into something akin to Siva himself.  

THE PATTERN OF SERVICES  

In daily worship Siva is a divine person, superior above all others, to whom  the worshiper must express his respect and subservience. He is a guest,  summoned to stay temporarily in the shrine, and must be treated to the finest  hospitality that his host, the ritualist, is able to provide. Siva is, moreover,  a lord ruling over the entire cosmos and must be served in ritual as one  would serve a human king. Siva is the granter of all grace, a beneficent  Lord, whom the worshiper may supplicate for favors. All these themes—  respect, subservience, hospitality, royal service, and petition—play a part  in the pattern of services that the worshiper now offers.7  

It is essential to realize, however, that the services of worship do not  simply imitate human prototypes, "playing at" or "reflecting" human hospi-

148 · Chapter Five    

tality or royal service. In the Saiva view, Siva is a person, a soul temporar ily inhabiting a body; he has made a journey from the dvadaianta to the  IiAga; he is a lord, a king over all other kings; and he is the source of all grace  to bound souls. The same principles of proper conduct that determine, for  instance, the way a host should receive a respected guest or the way one  should pay homage to a sovereign also govern die activities of the worshiper  here. The ritualist expresses and enacts through his services the actual rela 

tionship existing between himself and Siva.  

Incarnated through invocation in a body of mantras, Siva is refreshed,  bathed, clothed, adorned, entertained, fed, and praised during worship just  as any superior person might be. The agamas present various lists of ser vices that the worshiper must perform for Siva, ranging from a minimal list  of four upacaras up to sixteen or even more (KA 4.372-76).8 Further, each  service offered may vary quantitatively, according to the means of the wor 

shiper. The Kcimikagama (4.377-400) specifies nine ranked grades of wor ship, from "lowest of low" to "highest of high" forms, based on such crite ria as the quantity of rice served, the number of lamps lit, and the musical  instruments employed to serenade the Lord.  

food  

rank (in quarts) lamps instruments dancers  1. highest of high 280 500 50 216  2. middle of high 208 200 34 50  3. lowest of high 56 108 24 10-34  4. highest of middle 28 70 all —  5. middle of middle 14 24 — —  6. lowest of middle 8 12 — —  7. highest of low 6 8 — —  8. middle of low 4 4 — —  9. lowest of low 2 — — —  

One should make offerings "insofar as one is able" (yathaSakti), with larger  numbers of services and larger quantities of substances appropriate for  wealthy sponsors and well-endowed temples. But whatever the number of  services the worshiper employs and however munificent the substances of 

fered, the relationship established between the worshiper and Siva is in es sence the same.  

Receiving Siva as Guest  

When Siva has arrived in the linga, the worshiper first presents him with  refreshing waters, a suitable reception for one who has just completed a  journey. He gives Siva foot-water (padya) to rinse off his feet, sipping water (acamana) to cleanse his mouths, and arghya to sprinkle atop his  heads. Flowers and other soothing substances may also be showered upon 

Relations of Worship · 149    

his heads. Each offering is presented to the appropriate part of the linga,  following the ascending order of reabsorption.  

Next the worshiper bathes (sndna) Siva, and he may also give him an  anointment (abhi$eka). In private worship, diva's bath may consist of only  a single drop of special arghya accompanied by visualizations of the other  parts of bathing. In public rituals, by contrast, bathing the Lord is an elabo 

rate affair, involving repeated ablutions with various substances.  

[One bathes Siva], using bowls of various colors, with diamonds and other jew els, with cow dung [and the other products of the cow], with nicely prepared  powders, with black mustard seed and salt, with tepid water, sandal-water, and  herb-water, with milk, curd, ghee, honey, and jaggery.... If money permits  [one may also bathe Siva] with coconut milk or the juice of other succulent fruits,  with flowers and the like, with gold-water, with jewel-water, and with sandal 

water. (KA 4.405-9)  

After this bath of many colors, the ritualist anoints Siva, using the pots  that he has earlier prepared. While an ablution is appropriate for any person,  anointment is particularly suitable for kings, preceptors, and others who  have extensive powers and responsibilities. In a royal anointment, the cere 

mony constructs or constitutes the king's sovereignty by depositing mani fold powers, instantiated in the bathing pots, onto a single man. In the  anointment of a guru (acaryabhifeka), similarly, Siva's fundamental ener gies are infused into water-pots, and the contents of these pots are poured  over the preceptor-to-be, thereby transmitting to him the ritual powers nec essary to his new priestly status. Both these anointment rituals are substan tive and accretive in character: they add "lordly" qualities or powers to the  subject through an affusion with substances bearing or embodying those  qualities.  

The anointment of Siva during daily worship likewise involves the instan tiation of powers in pots and the pouring of their contents over a recipient.  As described in Chapter 2, the priest sets up anointment pots numbering  from S to 1,008 in a specified geometrical order, fills them with water and  an array of substances, and then invokes into each pot an aspect of Siva's  

kingship. He pours the contents of the pots over the linga, and with each  drenching the divine power of that pot is reabsorbed within the linga. What  distinguishes this abhiseka from those onto human subjects is that here the  recipient of powers is also the ultimate source of them. The powers and  divinities the worshiper infuses into the abhiseka pots are Siva's inherent  lordly powers and his delegated agents; by affusing the linga with them he  simply returns them to their proper fount. With each successive pot the wor shiper ritually reconstructs Siva embodied in the linga as the Lord of the Uni 

verse, adding onto him all the powers and agencies through which he per petually exercises his lordship over the cosmos.  

After these watery affairs, Siva must be newly dressed and ornamented. 

150 · Chapter Five    

(Parallel rites of investiture follow the inundations of the king and preceptor  in their abhi?ekas.) In private performance, the worshiper may dress and  decorate Siva through visualization, imagining that Siva puts on mentally  constructed decorations. In the public worship of temples, however, the  adornment of the linga should use the finest physical materials available.  

The priest should ornament the Mga with golden diadems, with crowns and leaves  made of gold, with golden shoots of durva-grass, with many golden Lak$ml me dallions, with a crescent moon, and with many golden flowers. He should orna ment it suitably with a triple string of pearls, an upper cloth, a waistband, a  golden skin and a golden garment, with other ornaments such as flowers, with a  covering made of gold, and also with various kinds of gems. (ΚΑ 4.428-31)9  

As throughout the services, one offers ornaments according to the principle  stated by Kamikagama: "one should offer small or large services in accord  with one's wealth" (KA 4.372). A greater quantity of offerings is of course  considered superior, and should be given if possible, but greater or smaller  amounts do not affect the fundamental relationships involved in worship.  

Pleasing Siva  

When the worshiper has attended to diva's outer needs by bathing, clothing,  and adorning him, he shows his hospitality with services meant to gratify  Siva's senses. He presents sweet-smelling flowers. He perfumes the sanc tum with incense while ringing a "handsome, deep-voiced bell." He pleases  Siva's eyes with "perpetual lamps, circular gateway lamps, trident lamps,  lamp garlands, and various other kinds of lamps" (KA 4.443). He decorates  the sanctum with hanging flower garlands.  

Further, the priest should present entertainments for the eye and ear.  Kamikagama suggests a veritable variety show for Siva, including songs  made of mantras, recitations from other sacred texts, songs in several lan guages, instrumental music, and dances from different regions.  

He should have songs consisting of mantras sung, or else vina music may be  played. After the offering of incense, there should be Vedic recitations or read ings from other sacred texts, and after that songs in the Gauda and other lan guages. Afterward he should have performed songs composed in the Dravidian  language, or in uncorrupt Sanskrit, joined with dance, or songs in the eighteen  languages using many tones. (KA 4.436-39)  

In the "highest of high" form of worship, 50 instruments supply the music  and 216 temple dancers perform.  

All these services aim to provide Siva with pleasurable sensory experi ences while he is embodied and present in the shrine. In fact, the worshiper  strives to please all of Siva's perceptual faculties (the five jnanendriyas) by 

RelationsofWorship · 151    

offering him the finest representatives of each category of matter (the five  bhOtas). According to one text, the worshiper honors Siva  

with sandal-paste, flowers, etc., consisting of Earth; with drinking water,  clothes, etc., consisting of Water; with jewels, lamps, ornaments, and the like  made of Hie; with yak-tail fans, incense, and so on made of Wind; and with  songs, music, and the like consisting of Ether. (SP 1 p. 199)  

The goal of the worshiper here is to be complete in his offerings: the ser vices he presents partake of all five material elements, they contain all five  perceptible qualities, and they engage all five sense organs of diva's embod iment. As Suryabhatta would have it, all matter is "to be delivered" to Siva.  

Every king has a court, and the Lord Siva is no exception. His court is  made up of the mantra powers and subordinate divinities who carry out his  commands. As described in Chapter 2, these agents of diva's lordship are  now drawn out from Siva, in the order of emission, so that the ritualist may  show his homage to them as well. The worshiper invokes from one to five  

entourages (Hvarana), concentric circles of diva's agency, onto thrones sur rounding Siva in a specified order, and offers to each divinity a set of eight  consecrations. Later he feeds them and pleases them with other services.  The arrangement of these subordinate lords around Siva follows a pre scribed order of priority. All particularized agencies are inferior to and en compassed within Siva's sovereignty, just as feudatory rulers are sub ordinated to the dominion of their overlord. Yet the services offered the  members of Siva's court indicate a second hierarchical relationship. The  worshiper expresses his homage not just to Siva, but also to the powers and  divinities who carry out Siva's command. By participating in Siva's sover eignty, albeit in an inferior station, each member of Siva's entourages be comes worthy of the ritualist's respect.  

Next it is time for Siva's meal. The services of worship follow a pattern  of increasing intimacy with respect to Siva's body. First concerned with the  outer surface of his lord's body, then gratifying his senses, the worshiper  now presents a food offering that not only pleases Siva's sense of taste, but  will also be "consumed" and incorporated by him. Carefully prepared, puri 

fied food is brought and placed before the linga. As we have seen, this meal  has been transformed through the fourfold consecration into a suitable state  of Siva-ness, so that Siva himself may consume it. According to ISanaSiva,  one last round of purifications remains to be performed, for safety's sake:  the worshiper "protects the food with ASTRA, encircles it with KAVACA, as perses it [with arghya] reciting 'BHOR, BHUVAR, SVAR,' and sprinkles all  around."10 Then he offers the food to each of Sadasiva's five faces and also  to the limbs of his divine body.  

The worshiper should express his hospitality to all attending divinities  comprehensively, yet in proper order. He first serves his preeminent guest, 

152 · Chapter Five    

Siva, and then proceeds outward, feeding all the members of Siva's entou rages, starting with the innermost circle. In temple worship, the priest must  leave the sanctum and feed as well the surrounding divinities (parivarade vata) who make up Siva's outer entourages (bahyavarana) outside the sanc tum, and he presents food to the lords guarding the doors (dvarapala). Last,  and least, he feeds—or gives "tribute" (bait) to—the lesser spirits (bhutas)  who have also managed to be present at the ceremony. The priest thus gives  offerings of sustenance to all, in order of rank and (correspondingly) in  

order of their proximity to the centermost divinity, Siva.  After the meal, naturally, come the after-dinner accompaniments. When  Siva has finished eating, the worshiper gratifies him by giving him sandal powder for washing his hands, sipping-water to rinse his mouth, mouth perfume for freshening the breath, and betel-leaf to aid his digestion. Then  he delights Siva with the sounds of a five-headed drum, with mirror, para sol, and yak-tail fan, and with more entertainment. At the completion of all  this hospitality, the worshiper finally meditates "that SadaSiva is happily  seated together with the goddess" (KA 4.501), or that "Siva is delighted by  the praises of Ananta and the other VidyeSvaras" (KKD p. 115). He has  achieved his goal, to please Siva through his generous offerings.  

Requesting Siva's Favor  

There remains one more major service for the worshiper to perform: the  recitations of mantras (japa). The focus shifts here from Siva to the ritualist  himself, for in offering recitations of mantras the worshiper seeks his own  ends more than Siva's pleasure. A new aspect of the relationship between  Siva and worshiper becomes apparent. Acting less the host than the suppli 

cant, the worshiper requests Siva's favor.  

Mantra recitations gain results for those who perform them. In Mrgen dragama's definition, mantra recitations "make the object of meditation fa vorable" to the reciter (MrA yoga 8). For this reason, japa is frequently used  for restitution, attainment of powers, and propitiation. When a Saiva trans gresses proper conduct, the most common expiation (prdyaScitta) consists  in repeating the purifying mantra AGHORA a specified number of times. For  instance, a Saivite who voluntarily fails to perform his daily worship should  perform one thousand recitations of AGHORA (SP 2.3.13-14); if one's per sonal Siva-Iinga is lost or destroyed, one should recite AGHORA one hundred  thousand times (SP 2.3.19-20); and so on. For an adept (sadhaka) who  seeks particular powers, recitations of a "mantra to be attained" (sadhya mantrd) form a major part of his discipline. An adept performing his mantra  vow, for instance, might recite his mantra a million times, accompanied by  one hundred thousand oblations (KirA carya 20.8—15). In daily worship as  well, one recites Siva's mantras in order to make Siva favorable. 

Relations of Worship • 153    

For the Saivas, the recitation of mantras is not merely an inward disci pline or verbal meditation. Mantras are, as we have seen, real external pow ers, and in this rite the worshiper seeks to direct these powers outward, pre senting them to Siva as a service. To do so, it is not enough simply to recite  

the mantras for diva's audition. Rather, the worshiper must first substantiate  the mantras in some material object before he can give them to Siva. As in  invocation, flowers serve here as the medium by which a subtle entity may  be objectified and transported. Nirmalamani explains that flowers are "the  place where the mantra recitations become manifest" (KKDP p. 116).  

The worshiper holds a flower and repeats the appropriate mantra a speci fied number of times. The mantra thereby becomes embodied in the flower.  Once embodied, the mantra flower must be carefully protected with an en closure (samputa) of other mantra powers. As AghoraSiva describes the  

method:  

Holding a flower in his hand, the worshiper should recite the MOLA mantra one  hundred and eight times, using a rosary which has been worshiped with HRD. He  emboxes [the flower] between ASTRA, KAVACA, and HRD mantras, then HRD,  KAVACA, and ASTRA mantras. Protecting the flower with ASTRA and encircling it  with KAVACA, he holds it in his right hand and, with his knee on the ground,  offers the recitation [substantiated in the flower] to Siva, accompanied by arghya  and the mudra of emission. (KKD p. 115)  

When the worshiper places the flowers on the linga, Siva receives the man tras that are manifested in them and looks favorably upon the one who has  presented them.  

The ritualist, however, gives more than just his recitations of mantras.  Reciting three verses directed to Siva, "the worshiper presents his mantra  recitations, his karman, and his soul, in order, to the boon-granting hand of  Siva" (KKD p. 116). From offering substances apart from himself, he has  now moved to giving his own inner constituents to Siva, ending with his  most essential part, the soul. In these offerings of an increasing intimacy,  the worshiper betokens a complete humbling before his Lord, a prostration  that is enacted physically a bit later when the worshiper "bows with all eight  limbs, like a stick" (KKD p. 123), in front of Siva.  

Yet the verses contain a request as well.  

'Ό Protector of the secret and the very secret, accept this recitation I have  made. [The recitation] remaining in you, may success come to me, by your  favor.  

"O Lord, consume and destroy all my karman, good and bad. I am at your feet,  O Beneficent One.  

"Siva is the donor; Siva is the one who consumes; Siva is this entire world. A  Siva worships everywhere. I am indeed that Siva." (KA 4.511-14)154 · Chapter Five    

As the prayers stress, Siva is a protector, a beneficent lord, one who grants  favor. Having pleased and honored Siva to the best of his ability, the wor shiper now makes his petition, asking that the undertaking be successful and  that his karman be consumed. The undertaking, if successful, will "increase  the longevity, health, victory, and prosperity of the ruler" and will "make  the villagers and others thrive" (KA 4.5). Removal of karman brings about  the liberation of the soul. Thus, the worshiper requests no less from Siva  than the two goals of human activity, worldly enjoyments (bhoga) and liber 

ation (moksa). If these all-encompassing requests are not enough, he may  also ask for more specific benefits by reciting optional (kamya) mantras after  the three verses.  

Finally the worshiper gladdens Siva with verses of praise (stotra). The  verses proclaim in words Siva's preeminent place in the universe, just as the  worshiper has proclaimed it in action through his services.11 Not coinciden tally, they also seek to remind Siva of his benevolent character, with the  implicit hope that some of Siva's favor may grace the worshiper.  

Siva is indeed "to be served" in the offerings of daily worship, and this  service takes many forms. The relationship between Siva and a human wor shiper is a multifaceted one, and accordingly the worshiper enacts a com plex relationship through his services to Siva. The worshiper receives Siva,  bathes him, clothes and decorates him, entertains him, does homage to his  court, feeds him, worships him with mantras, and praises him. He treats  Siva as a guest and a king, a superior and a benefactor; he seeks to please  him by offering substances of every category, gratifying all of Siva's  senses; he even offers his own inner constitution.  

THE PROBLEM OF PURE REMAINS  

We have seen how the worshiper collects and refines substances to a high  state of purity so that they are suitable for Siva's enjoyment, and how he  presents these substances as expressions of his homage, meant to gratify his  Lord. Yet the substances do not cease to exist when Siva consumes them.  Siva eats only the most subtle part of his meal, the portion that shares in his  sivatva. The material remains (ucchista) of the meal are left on his plate after  he has finished, as are the remains of all the flowers, unguents, and other  offerings used in worshiping him.  

It is a general principle of Hindu science that the use or enjoyment of  substances alters their condition. Among humans, the leftovers from one  person's meal become impure for most others, due to their contact with his  inner fluids such as saliva. Such polluted remains are fit only for consump 

tion by a social inferior.  

The situation is somewhat different with the meals of the gods. The con sumption of food by a god alters the leftovers not to a lower status, but to  a higher one, as far as humans are concerned. Since the highest gods are so 

RelationsofWorship • 155    

far superior to humans, even their remains—which may very well be impure  in relation to other gods—are highly pure and imbued with good qualities  with respect to humans. Contact with a god, even through his spittle, is  beneficial.  

For this reason many Hindu sects, including some Saiva ones, distribute  the material remains of the god's meal to worshipers and devotees for sec ondary consumption. The god eats the subtle portion; his human followers  eat the remaining "gross" portions. The leftovers are prasada, a form of  divine "favor" returned to humans, and vast powers are ascribed to it. For  instance, AppayacQksita extols diva's leftover bathwater:  

Water from Siva's feet and his leftovers should be used zealously by his devo tees; sins born of mind, voice, or body will not touch them The Prthiidaka,  the Mahatirtha, the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada, Sarayu, K§ipra, as well as  Godavan, are always present in Siva's bathwater, O sages. One should use the  water of Siva's bath, since it is made of all tlrthas. (SAC p. 119)  

Eating the remains of a divine meal likewise confers many benefits: it puri fies, destroys sin, cures cases of poisoning, and much more.  Saiva siddhantins agree that Siva's enjoyment of substances alters them  to a higher state. In fact, they argue, the contact of a substance with Siva so  transfigures it that it can no longer be used by humans at all. "Humans can not bear it, and should avoid it diligently," as Kamikagama (4.S27) suc cinctly puts the case. And consequently, there can be no distribution of  Siva's edible leftovers to human devotees in a Saiva siddhanta temple.  When Siva enjoys a substance, that substance becomes nirmalya.12 Ac cording to Nirmalamani's practical definition, the term refers particularly to  flower garlands: "Nirmalya denotes garlands (malya) that have been re moved (nirasta) [from the linga].... [Garlands] which first have mantras  recited upon them, are consumed by Siva, removed, and given to Lord Canda  are said to be nirmalya" (KKDP p. 132). From garlands, nirmalya is ex tended to cover all substances that undergo the same process of preparation,  consumption, and removal. Kamikagama gives a more philosophical def inition to the term. "It is called nirmalya because it has reached a state of  stainlessness (nirmalata)" (KA 6.86). Without mala, nirmalya is utterly  pure.  

The final transfiguration of substance through Siva's use is, in one sense,  another stage in the process begun with the worshiper's careful selection,  preparation, and purification of the substance before offering it. Ap payadiksita brings this point out by comparing the transformation with that  of a stone linga.  

A Siva-linga, which is at first only a particular form of a worldly piece of stone,  comes to partake of consciousness (cinmaya) by the consecration of establish ment (pratiffha), which removes its impure form resulting from mdya, and after 

156 · Chapter Five    

that the IiAga should not be touched by those who are not initiated. In the same  way the nirmalya [which is initially a worldly substance] also comes to partake  of consciousness by the group of four consecrations beginning with "divine  glance," after which it is considered suitable for diva's consumption, and then  becomes even more pure when consumed by Siva. Therefore it too should not be  touched by the uninitiated, φ AC p. 119)  

Substances already highly refined by the ritual actions of humans become  even more so when Siva consumes them.  

While human leftovers are unfit for subsequent use because they are im pure, diva's leftovers are unsuited for human enjoyment because they are  too pure. Contact with Siva has rendered the nirmdlya immaculate, yet  human worshipers continue to inhabit bodies infested with mala and so are  not able to bear contact with so much pureness. Says Siva in a purana, "A  foul person of impure soul who, out of greed, consumes that which I have  enjoyed and which is highly pure will be destroyed, like a siidra who studies  the Vedas."13 If one does imbibe some nirmalya through some ill fortune,  however, he may avert the ensuing destruction by performing a stiff expia 

tion. SomaSambhu prescribes that one recite the purifying mantra AGHORA  twenty-five thousand times (SP 2.3.58), roughly the same expiation as is  required for such grave transgressions as drooling on the lihga or touching it  with one's feet. Consuming nirmalya, like mistreating a linga, is a serious  infringement requiring serious restitution.  

These overly purified substances pose a practical problem: how should  one dispose of them? If humans cannot receive them, who can? Fortunately,  there is an apt recipient for Siva's pure, powerful leftovers right within the  temple complex: the Lord Canda.  

Canda is one of the GaneSvaras, a member of Siva's household entourage,  where he is stationed in the northeast direction.14 In Saiva temples of South  India, Canda most often occupies an independent shrine situated immediately  to the northeast of the main sanctum. The term canda means "fierce," "vio lent," "angry," and Kamikagama describes him accordingly, claiming that  Lord Canda is "an angry emanation (αιμία) of ParamaSiva" (KA 4.S25). Ifhis  meditation form is any indication, Cagda lives up to his name.  

Arising from Rudra's fire, and fierce (raudra), Cancla is the color of lampblack,  dreadful, carries trident and hatchet, and has four faces and four arms. He spits  great flames from his mouth, and has twelve red eyes. The crescent moon adorns  his matted locks, a snake is his bracelet, and another snake is his sacrificial  thread. He holds a rosary and an ascetic's water-pot, and sits on a white lotus  throne. He removes all pain from those who bow with devotion. (SP 1.5.2-4)  

One of the final acts of daily worship is to worship Lord Canda and to pre sent to him the leftover nirmdlya.15 "Whatever remains on the linga, ritual

platform, or sand-linga, and has been enjoyed and left by Siva is for Canda's  consumption" (KA 4.526-27). In contrast to humans, Canda is able to bear the  intense purity of nirmalya, presumably by virtue of his own ardent charac ter. Worshiping Canda has a second purpose as well. Not only does it pre sent the nirmalya to an appropriate recipient, it also removes any faults  (do$a) the priest may have committed while worshiping the linga (KKDP p.  132). Like Siva's own power of reabsorption, the fierce Cagda removes and  absorbs a host of things: the afflictions of his devotees, mistakes made in  worshiping Siva, and Siva's too-pure leftovers.  

The worship of Cancla is a relatively simple rite. The priest goes to Canda's  shrine northeast of the sanctum, ritually constructs an appropriate throne  and embodiment for Canda using CANPASANA and CANPAMORTI mantras,  visualizes Canda's form as described above, and invokes him with the  DHVANICAWESVARA, Canda's equivalent of Siva's MOLA mantra. The invo 

cation of Canda, then, follows the paradigm of Siva's invocation described in  the previous chapter, but it is considerably less complex. The worshiper  performs the proper consecrations, gives Canda arghya, and then presents to  him the nirmalya that has been collected from the linga and pedestal. As he  offers the leftovers, the priest repeats two verses that articulate the two main  purposes of Canda worship.  

"By order of Siva, I give to you what is licked, sucked, eaten, drunk, or other wise consumed, the betel leaf, garlands, unguents, and the food that is nirmalya.  "O Canda, whatever in the entire ritual I have done either deficiently or exces sively due to delusion, may that be perfected for me through your command."  CSP 1.5.7-8)  

Even after Canda's secondary consumption of the nirmalya, there are still  substantive remnants, and they are still not fit for humans. One final dis posal remains. At this point, says one agama, one should give it "to cattle  and elephants, or throw it in the water, or else burn it in fire, or bury it."16  And so ends the trajectory of substances used in worship. Perfect specimens  carefully prepared, refined into nectar, presented to Siva and consumed by  him, transmuted thereby into nirmalya, and offered to Canda, these substances  are finally disposed of among those universal recipients: cows, elephants,  Water, Fire, and Earth. Human worshipers at no point enjoy these offerings  themselves.  

DISMISSAL  

In addition to feeding Canda and disposing of the remains, other acts are nec essary to complete worship. Most important among these concluding rites,  the worshiper must "dismiss" (visarjana) Siva from his embodiment in the  linga. Though a much simpler rite, dismissal is in many respects the converse 

158 · Chapter Rve    

of invocation. Where invocation instantiates a "special presence" of Siva  in the linga, dismissal enables Siva to "turn his face away" (paranmukha)  from his worshipers, remaining in the Mga as a latent presence only. Where  invocation laigely follows the path of emission, dismissal is an act of re 

absorption.  

The worshiper begins the rite of dismissal by presenting to Siva pa rafmukMrghya, a special form of arghya that allows Siva to avert his face,  and by displaying the mahamudra. In the mahamudrS, one holds the two  hands together, outstretched, and moves them upward over some object,  from the feet to the head, in the order of reabsorption.17 Then the worshiper  merges the members of Siva's court back into Siva, from where they had  been drawn out, using the mudra of reabsorption.18 "He causes the divini ties surrounding the linga to get up with ASTRA and the mudra of reabsorp tion, and joins them so that they are united in Siva's embodiment, using the  MORTI mantra" (KA 4.518-19). Finally, he allows Siva to return from his  embodied state to that of undifferentiated Paramasiva.  

Reciting MULA followed by the HRD mantra, the worshiper visualizes Siva freed  from his limbs, liberated from all differentiated (sakala) attributes, and returned  to a state of nondifferentiation (niskalata) through the part of the iivatattva situ ated in the heart [of the embodiment]. (KA 4.519-20)  

By this means, Siva's special presence in the linga for the duration of wor ship comes to an end.  

One might expect that the worshiper too would undergo some sort of  "exit" rite at the completion of puja, removing himself from the high state  of Siva-ness he attained through self-purification. But there is no such rite.  As far as I am aware, Saiva authors do not consider this an omission worthy  of comment, and so we are left to postulate its significance. Of course, the  worshiper wishes ultimately to maintain a state of similarity to Siva; this is  the definition of moksa. If the rite of self-purification offers a quotidian taste  of this climactic status, why not let its effects linger as long as possible?  One will lose this unworldly purity soon enough anyway, through the im 

pact of nonritual activities. So there is neither motivation nor necessity for  the worshiper to undergo a rite counteracting the earlier effects of his self purification.  

Instead, after dismissing Siva from the linga, the worshiper does clean-up  duty. He washes the linga and pedestal and decorates them with flowers and  the like. He cleans the pots used for arghya, bathing water, drinking water,  and so on, and puts them back on their shelves. He wipes the floor with  three balls of cow dung. As well as cleansing these physical objects, the  worshiper must also "clear up" the ritual action he has just completed. Says  Kamikagama, "he should repeat the mantra collection [consisting of MULA, 

Relations of Worship · 159    

the brahmamantras, and the angamantras] in order to purify any deviations  or errors" he may have committed (KA 4.536). Then, the text continues,  "the priest rinses his hands and feet, sips water according to the rule, pros trates himself on the ground like a stick, and says, 'Forgive me'" (KA  4.537-38). With this final propitiation worship comes to a close.  

WORSHIP AND EXCHANGE  

In nityapuja, then, the worshiper gives the totality of matter, and finally  himself as well, to Siva. He supplicates Siva, requesting (according to his  aims in life) worldly pleasures or final liberation. The god Siva is present in  the linga to receive the offerings and may subsequently favor the worshiper  by granting his wishes.  

This recapitulation of the relations established in worship suggests a num ber of questions about the general significance of puja within the Saiva  world. Should daily worship be interpreted as a ritual of reciprocal ex change? What is the relationship between the services of worship and Siva's  bestowal of grace? Does the gift given in offering assure a return to the  giver? Are the presentation of services and Siva's boons causally linked to  one another? Scholars of Indian religions have often employed terms and  models drawn from human economic activity, such as "exchange," "recip rocity," and "redistribution," to explicate Hindu rituals, and so it is worth  reconsidering these questions here from a Saiva perspective.  

Earlier in this chapter, I stressed the absolute hierarchy existing between  Siva and the bound soul. A parallel, and related, hierarchy subsists between  a human's gift of worship and Siva's granting of favor. For the Saivas, these  are gifts of unequal motivation, proportion, and value.  

The worshiper is motivated to offer worship, as Suiyabhatta suggests, by  the very nature of his relationship to Siva. To perform nityapuja is part of  his "general code of conduct" (samayacara), incumbent on all members of  the Saiva community; not to do so constitutes a fault, a sin. Siva, by con 

trast, dispenses grace freely, without any compulsion. There cannot be any  obligation to Siva's favor, for that would contradict his autonomy. Rather,  he grants his boons out of his favorable disposition to the souls (though the  forms that benevolence takes may sometimes be difficult for us to compre hend), and with due regard for the propensities and capacities of those to  whom he shows favor.  

The agamas repeatedly direct the worshiper to give his offerings ya thasakti, that is, in proportion to his abilities, insofar as he is able. For him,  the giving over of material resources in worship represents a real and sub stantial "abandonment" (tydga). While there is no reason for a householder  

to impoverish himself making offerings, the services of puja should consti-

160 · Chapter Five    

tute a personal sacrifice, a significant voluntary giving up of worldly posses sions. And in his final supplications, the worshiper even gives up his own  self to Siva. Siva's exercise of grace, on the other hand, is but one of his  activities and does not diminish through his exercise of it. Siva suffers no  loss. There is no need for him to abandon anything else in favoring a partic ular soul, for he is omnipotent. Just as he is present in many temples and  shrines simultaneously, Siva can also favor many persons at the same time,  without any effect on his own store of grace.  

All that the worshiper gives to Siva does not in any way add to Siva, since  he is already complete. While the offerings may represent a real sacrifice for  the donor, they are without significant value for the recipient. Siva has no  need of such offerings. By contrast, the grace that Siva may give is a thing  of absolute value for the worshiper. Siva's boon can have a complete trans 

formative effect on the one who receives it. While bestowing grace does not  subtract from Siva at all, it may alter the human recipient totally.  The worshiper's gift and Siva's grace, then, cannot be considered com modities of equal and exchangeable value.  

Another way to consider the question of worship and exchange is to re trace the path of substantive offerings in nityapuja. As we have seen, the  worshiper selects the best specimens available of each article, prepares them  carefully, and subjects them to a purification that renders them suitable for  Siva's consumption. Finally he presents them to Siva, who enjoys the most  subtle portion of each offering. The substantive portion left over becomes  transfigured through contact with Siva into highly pure nirmalya.  

In many Hindu ritual schools, priests redistribute these substantive re mainders of the divine meal to other participants in the ritual for secondary  consumption as prasdda, the god's "favor." Such reuse suggests an auto matic distribution of divine grace in palatable form and may lead one to  

think of puja as a communal exchange with the divinity: the community of  worshipers gives offerings of purified food, and he gives in return transfig ured food to his devotees. Saiva siddhanta, however, denies the second  phase of this apparent exchange. Food transubstantiated through Siva's con 

sumption is unfit for subsequent reuse by humans, because it is too pure.  One cannot mechanically acquire Siva's grace by eating his leftovers. So  here too, the Saivas stress the hierarchical distinction between Siva and  bound souls, and in so doing they confute the view that sees worship as  reciprocal exchange between divinity and humanity.  

If the offerings of puja are entirely incommensurate with Siva's grace, if  Siva stands beyond any obligation or constraint, and if humans cannot even  touch the food left on Siva's plate, what does puja do? Does offering wor ship have any effect on Siva at all?  

While the Saiva formulation of nityapuja emphasizes the "otherness" of  Siva in many respects, it also envisions Siva's personalization, through in-

Relations of Worship · 161    

carnation in a mantra body. Siva allows himself to become embodied in a  material form, and with this embodiment it is possible for the worshiper to  enact a relationship analogous to certain human relations, such as that be tween host and guest, or between attendant and lord.  

Throughout their descriptions of daily worship, the agamas speak fre quently of the worshiper "pleasing" Siva. He invites Siva to inhabit a mate rial form as a guest in his home shrine or temple and presents to him the best  he can offer in order to "satisfy" (to$ana) and "refresh" (tarpana) him. He en tertains Siva as the king of a divine court and sings his praises in order to  

"delight" (abhinandana) and "stimulate" (pramcana) him. He supplicates  Siva in order to "make Siva favorably disposed" toward him. This notion  of pleasing Siva of course presupposes the personalization of the divinity  brought about through invocation. Pleasure is not a meaningful category  with respect to Paramasiva, since Siva in his highest state is beyond all such  dualities as pleasure and pain. However, when Siva becomes embodied as  Sadagiva and is viewed as a divine person, attempting to please this person 

age through one's ritual actions is eminently feasible.  

In considering the efficacy of worship, it is useful to keep in mind the  analogous human transactions. A host seeks to please and to satisfy the  wishes of a respected guest not in any expectation of a return from the guest,  but because it is dharma. The relationship itself compels the householder to  observe certain principles of hospitality, and his own feelings of respect  toward his visitor should reinforce the obligation. Similarly, one in atten dance upon a king should hope to serve and gratify his lord and master pre 

cisely because the other is lord. The attendant is in no position to enforce or  expect any return of favors, for he is in thrall to his king, but it is only  human for him to make some petition for his lord's recognition and aid.  

For the Saivas, puja follows a similar course. The worshiper aims,  through his services, to please Siva who has become present close at hand.  He does so not expecting an automatic recompense, but because service is  his natural mode of relating himself to his lord, Siva. Service to Siva is  dictated by the metaphysical relations persisting between categories of  pati and pasu, by the general rules for conduct of all initiated Saivites, and  also by the worshiper's own spontaneous sentiments of devotion toward  Siva. The return on any such offering is at best uncertain, for Siva operates  according to designs beyond our comprehension in granting his favors.  

The stress Saivas place on the hierarchy of the relationship between wor shiper and Siva, and on the contingency of any profit accruing from one's  donations, might lead one to regard puja as an uncertain and useless exer cise. This is not a fitting conclusion. Saiva texts obviously would not give  the ritual of nityapuja so much attention if it were simply uncertain, nor  would they emphasize its efficacy if they considered it ultimately ineffec tual. To view the full efficacy of the ritual, however, it is necessary to dis-

162 · Chapter Five    

sent from Suryabhatfa's definition of piija. Rather than identifying worship  primarily by its core transactions between god and human worshiper, we  must remember the relationship between the conscious powers of knowl edge and action and view it in terms of the worshiper's own gradual mastery  of a complex body of thought and practice, which does lead one ever closer  both to the Lord Siva and to attaining Siva-ness in oneself. 

## 6 CONCLUSION    

IN THE FINAL SECTION of the Sivapurana, after the wind-god Vayu has given  the eager sages of the Naimisa forest preliminary instruction in the siva jnana, he concludes his discourse with a statement about the character of  knowledge.  

Knowledge is said to be of two types, indirect (paroksa, literally "beyond one's  own sight") and direct. Indirect knowledge is unstable, they say, while direct  knowledge is very firm. Knowledge acquired through reasoning and instruction  is considered indirect knowledge; direct knowledge will arise through the most  excellent practice of ritual. Deciding that you cannot obtain moksa without direct  knowledge, you should exert yourselves assiduously to master this excellent  practice. ($Pur Vdyaviya 1.31.98-100)  

Vayu might seem here to undermine the authority of his own teachings.  After all, according to this dichotomy the mediated verbal instruction he has  just given the sages would be classified as indirect, unstable, and not lead ing to final liberation. But the sages are well-disposed to accept Vayu's  statement, since they have already been engaged in a sacrificial rite for a  thousand divine years in order to gain Vayu's presence in the first place.  Immediately understanding its implication, they ask to be tutored in the su 

perior ritual procedures so they can put them into practice themselves.  By now, we too should be able to assent to Vayu's claim, even if we do  not intend to follow his practical counsel. Saiva daily worship, one of those  most excellent ritual practices Vayu speaks of, has provided us with a privi leged entry point into the world as it was envisioned and acted upon by  medieval Saiva adepts and priests. By discursively reenacting Saiva piija  ourselves, we have seen how SivajMna is embedded in every detail of its  action and how this ritual engenders the direct, unmediated knowledge  Vayu declares is requisite to attaining liberation.  

Saiva nityapuja employs a series of synecdochic representations to offer  its practitioner a comprehensive vision of the Saiva world within a delimited  ritual terrain. Though by definition still fettered and limited in knowledge  and action, the worshiper can temporarily free himself from these limita 

tions within the sphere of puja. As he places mantras on his hands, removes  impurities from his body, or mentally constructs Siva's divine court, the  worshiper regularly employs the ordering principles of cosmic dynamism,  emission and reabsorption. As he reconstructs his body in self-purification,  he recapitulates the central passage of the soul from its condition of bondage  to liberation. When he imposes a variegated divine body onto the material164 * Conclusion    

linga and invokes Siva into it, he enacts a condensed theophany of the Lord  £iva, a ritual metonym of diva's variegated being. And when he offers sub stantive services, he brings the three ontological categories—Siva, bound  souls, and inanimate substance—into their proper and fundamental relation ship with one another.  

Through regular effort, as Vayu directs the sages, the worshiper could  "exert himself assiduously to master" this ritual, to complete in himself the  knowledge-in-action that would produce the highest fruits. For puja was not  just a vision of an imagined world, nor even of a reconstructed historical  world such as we have sought to enter, for the medieval Saiva siddhantins.  It was rather a way of seeing into the fundamental order of things, beyond  the human fetters that determine our partial viewpoint and our ignorance,  and of acting thereby with greater efficacy to higher ends, beyond the bonds  that normally suppress our active powers of consciousness. 

## Notes    

### INTRODUCTION  

LOCATING THE TRADITION  

1. The scholarly literature on puja is not large, considering its importance within  Hindu traditions. For descriptions of puja in various schools, see James Burgess,  "The Ritual of Ramesvaram," Indian Antiquary 12 (1883): 313-26; T. Goudriaan,  "Vaikhanasa Daily Worship according to the handbooks of Atri, Bhrgu, Kasyapa,  and Marici," Indo-Iranian Journal 12 (1970): 161-215; R. V. Joshi, Le ritual de la  devotion Krsnaite (Pondich6ry: Institut Fransais d'Indologie, 1959); K. Ranga chari, The Sii Vaisnava Brahmans (Madras: Government Press, 1931); and Mrs.  Sinclair Stevenson, The Rites of the Twice-Born (London: Oxford University Press,  1920), pp. 368-400. The most useful translations of puja texts are those of Ηέΐέηβ  Brunner-Lachaux, Somaiambhupaddhati, premiere partie (Pondichdry: Institut  Franiais d'Indologie, 1963), and T. Goudriaan, Kasyapa's Book of Wisdom (The  Hague: Mouton, 1965). Two notable ethnographic accounts are Paul B. Courtright,  "On This Holy Day in My Humble Way: Aspects of Puja," in J. P. Waghome and  N. Cutler (eds.), Gods of Flesh/Gods of Stone (Chambersburg, Pa.: Anima Publica tions, 1985), pp. 33-50; and Akos Ostor, The Play of the Gods (Chicago: Univer sity of Chicago Press, 1980).  

2. The best general overview of Saiva siddhanta literature is Jan Gonda, Medi eval Religious Literature in Sanskrit (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1977). While  our knowledge of this corpus of texts has been substantially augmented since Gonda  wrote, largely through the effort of scholars associated with the Institut Franfais  d'Indologie in Pondichdry, there has not yet been any synthetic account incorporat ing this new information. I attempt to cite in these notes a large portion of recent  scholarly work, so a diligent reader may follow up on topics of interest.  

3. I use the 1975 devanagari edition of Kamikagama edited by C. Swaminatha siva. This edition virtually repeats the 1909 grantha text edited by Mayilai Ala gappa Mudaliar, which in turn was based on seven separate manuscripts. I have also  consulted a high-quality manuscript of KA formerly belonging to Sri Swaminatha  Sivacarya of Tiruvatuturai matha, now held by the Institut Fran;ais d'Indologie at  Pondichdry (T.298A). I use alternate readings based on this manuscript in a few  cases where they seem clearly preferable. For Kriyakramadyotika, I follow the 1927  grantha edition (based on four manuscript sources) published by the Jfianasamband ham Press in Cidambaram, which includes Nirmalamani's commentary. The 1967  edition of the South Indian Archakas Association follows the 1927 edition generally  but contains numerous mistakes and adds many apocryphal passages. It is clear  from a comparison of the texts that the 1927 edition of KKD is much truer to the text  as it was available to Nirmalamani in the sixteenth century. A critical edition of this  central Saiva siddhanta ritual text, based on thirty manuscripts, is currently being  prepared under the direction of S. S. Janaki at the Kuppuswami Sastri Research  Institute, Madras.

A local tradition, first reported by Bumell in 1879, claims that the liturgy of  the RajaiSjeSvara temple followed the Mtdcufagama (the "crown" agama, one of the  twenty-eight mulagamas). See A. C. Burnell, A Classified Index to the Sanskrit  Mss. in the Palace of Tanjore (London: Trubner & Co., 1879). The published edi tion of Makufagama, however, is highly corrupt; a critical edition would be neces sary before a reasonable assessment of this claim could be made. See C. Svami natha Sivacarya (ed.), Makufagama, piirvabhaga (Madras: South Indian Archakas  Association, 1977).

Much of this brief depiction of "temple Hinduism" draws on the work of  Ronald Inden, through his published and unpublished writings, classes at the Uni versity of Chicago between 1978 and 1980, and many discussions since.

Inden, "The Ceremony of the Great Gift (Mahadana): Structure and His torical Context in Indian Ritual and Society," Asie du Sud, traditions et change ments, Colloques Internationaux du CNRS, no. 582 (Paris: Editions du Centre na tional de la recherche scientifique, 1979), pp. 131-36. Nicholas Dirks, "Political  Authority and Structural Change in Early South Indian History," Indian Economic  and Social History Review 13 (1976): 125-58, is also useful in specifying this trans formation. Other pertinent articles by Inden include "The Ceremonial Bath of the  Hindu King of Kings" and "Imperial Formations, Imperial Puranas" (both un published).

[Siva] instructed the sage, Durvasas, to revive the Saivagamic teaching. The sage  accordingly divided all the saivagamas into 3 classes according as they taught mo nism, dualism or monism-cum-dualism, imparted their knowledge to his 3 mind-bora  sons, Tryambaka, Amardaka, and Srinatha respectively, and charged each one of  them separately with the mission of spreading the knowledge of their respective  Agamas. Thus there came into existence three Saiva Tantric Schools, each known by  the name of the first earthly progenitor.

For Southeast Asia,  see K. Bhattacharya, Les religions brahmaniques dans I'Ancien Cambodge (Paris:  Ecole Franfaise d' Extreme-Orient, 1961).  

25. As a tenth-century inscription from Madhya Pradesh refers to one important  Saiva siddhanta branch, the Mattamayiira. See F. Kielhorn, "A Stone Inscription  from Ranod (Narod)," Epigraphia Indica 1 (1892): 351-61.  

26. As Brunner puts it, the paddhatis aim at "unification of the often contradic tory teachings of the agamas, and have performed their function so well that they  have ended up somewhat eclipsing the agamas themselves" ("Importance de la  litt&ature agamique," p. 110).  

27. On AghoraSiva's life, see Wayne Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites of Initi ation: "The DHc§avidhi' of AghoraSivacarya's 'Kriyakramadyotika'" (Ph.D. disserta tion, University of California, Berkeley, 1984), pp. xvi-xxi. AghoraSiva's known  works are listed in V. Raghavan, New Catalogus Catalogorum (Madras: University  of Madras, 1968), vol. 1, pp. 58-59.1 have attempted to summarize the intellectual  background of Aghorasiva in "Aghora&va's Background," in Dr. S. S. JanaM Sha shtyabdapurti Commemoration Volume (Madras: Kuppuswami Sastri Research In stitute, forthcoming).

Dunuwila, Saiva Siddhanta Theology: A Context  for Hindu-Christian Dialogue (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1985) (based primarily  on Bhojadeva's TP); and K. C. Pandey, An Outline of History of Saiva Philosophy  (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1986) (first printed in 1955 as Bhaskari, vol. 3). Jayan 

dra Soni, Philosophical Anthropology in Saiva Siddhanta (Delhi: Motilal Banar sidass, 1989), is based primarily on the works of the sixteenth-century Saiva author  Sivagrayogin.  

29. The best general account of the Tamil version of Saiva siddhanta is M. Dha-

Notes to Introduction · 169    

vamony. Love of God according to Saiva Siddheinta (Oxford: Clarendon Press,  1971). Also useful are the collected lectures of V. A. Devasenapathy, with the  excellent title Of Human Bondage and Divine Grace (Cidambaram: Annamalai  University, 1963), and the study of K. Sivaraman, Saivism in Philosophical Per 

spective (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1973). A primary agenda of most historical  scholarship on Tamil Saiva siddhanta works of the thirteenth century and later has  been to develop a genealogy relating these texts directly to the works of the Tamil  nayanmars of the sixth through ninth centuries. Such studies generally pay lip ser 

vice to the role of the agamas in the philosophical system of Meykantar and his fol lowers, but they do not seriously investigate the connections between the Sanskrit  dgama literature and the later Tamil works.  

30. The only critical work devoted to this, as far as I know, is the brief discus sion by Brunner, "Importance de la littirature agamique," pp. 118-19. For another  example of a Saiva author working in both Sanskrit and Tamil, see Bruno Dagens's  discussion of the sixteenth-century commentator Vedajfiana/Maiaifiagatecikar, in  "Introduction," SPM, pp. 5-15. I am indebted to Dagens for leading me to recon sider the relation of Sanskrit and Tamil Saiva siddhanta literature.  

31. On the poetry of the nayanmars, see especially the recent study and transla tions by Indira Peterson, Poems to Siva (Princeton: Princeton University Press,  1989).  

32. On the use of texts in contemporary temple practice, see Carl Gustav Diehl,  Instrument and Purpose: Studies on Rites and Rituals of South India (Lund: C.W.K.  Gleerup, 1956). For a portrait of a Saiva priestly community in theological disarray,  see Chris Fuller's fascinating ethnography on the Madurai Mmak§i-Sundare£varar  temple priests, Servants of the Goddess: The Priests of a South Indian Temple  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984).  

33. G. U. Pope (trans.), The nruvacagam, or "Sacred Utterances" of the Tamil  Poet, Saint, and Sage ManHckavacagar (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1900), p. lxxiv.  The same position turns up repeatedly in general works on Saivism and Hinduism.  For instances, see: M. Dhavamony, "Saivism: Saiva Siddhanta," in Mircea Eliade  (ed.), Encyclopedia of Religion (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1987), vol.  13, p. 11; and Thomas J. Hopkins, The Hindu Religious Tradition (Encino, Cal.:  Dickenson Publishing Co., 1971), p. 118.  

34. For a more skeptical discussion of the question of integration between jnana  and kriya, see Ηέΐέηβ Branner-Lachaux, "Introduction," MrA (Section des rites),  esp. pp. xlii-xliii.  

35. The texts set out an ideal program for worship that only the highly adept and  devout could follow completely. Yet they also recognize and allow for individual  variations and shortcuts in phrases repeated throughout, such as yathaiakti (in ac cord with one's capacity).  

36. Agnipurana (ch. 72-106), LiAgapurana, and Sivapurana (Vayaviyasamhita  ch. 16-20) clearly articulate siddhanta positions. (Brunner briefly discusses the pu ranic usage of agamic material in "Importance de la littirature agamique," pp. 117  and 121.) Silpaiastras such as MM also reflect Saiva siddhanta practice, but through  the eyes of the sthapati rather than the acarya.  

37. I mention in the notes some of the disputes and differing formulations within 

170 · Notes to Chapter One    

the Saiva siddhanta order. In her translation of SP, and particularly in vol. 3,  Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux presents a much more variegated portrait of Saiva sid dhanta literature, focusing repeatedly on doctrinal discussion within the order.  

CHAPTER ONE  

RITUAL AND HUMAN POWERS  

1. Some Saiva texts add "volition" (iccha) as a third inherent power of con sciousness.  

2. The agamas of course recognize that not everyone seeks mok$a in this lifetime;  the world includes bubhukfus ("seekers of worldly enjoyments") as well as mumukfus  ("seekers of liberation"). But worldly powers and liberation do not lie along radi cally differing courses of action. Both result from the removal of fetters and the  manifestation of inherent powers. Sadhakas (mantra-adepts), for instance, employ  Saiva ritual and knowledge to gain specific worldly powers. For a full discussion,  see Ηέΐέηε Brunner, "Le sadhaka, personnage oubli6 du Sivaisme du Sud," Journal  asiatique 263 (1975): 411-43.  

3. Contrary to what many modern advocates of Saiva siddhanta have held, the  igamas do not portray themselves as derived from or in any way subordinate to the  Vedas. On this matter, Ηέΐέηε Brunner's "Le Saiva-siddhanta, 'Essence' du Veda,"  Indologica Taurinensia 8 (1980-1981): 51-66, is a welcome statement. For a some 

what different formulation, see Richard Davis, "Cremation and Liberation: A Saiva  siddhanta Revision," History of Religions 28 (1988): 37-53. Wayne Surdam, "The  Vedicization of Saiva Ritual," in S. S. Janaki (ed.), Siva Temple and Temple Ritu als (Madras: Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, 1988), pp. 52-60, deals with  the relationship as it has changed over time.  

4. MrAVD vidya 1.20, from Michel Hulin's French translation.  5. Kamikagama refers to this useful technique as an analogy to the efficacy of  "interior worship":  

Visualizing with his mind, he should daily worship ParameSvara in this imagined  temple, using substances that are mentally constructed. As a guru meditates that  he is Garuda and obtains the result of removing [poison, even though done mentally],  so here also one obtains the desired benefits [resulting from worship], (KA 4.189- 90)  

6. This useful convention I owe to Ηέΐέηε Brunner-Lachaux, who has employed  it in her translations and studies of saivagama.  

7. Nirmalamam understands the Saiva form of meditation, in its concern to estab lish a relationship between meditator and divinity, to differ from Pataiijali yoga:  'Toga is the close connection (sambandha) during meditation with the object of  meditation; not, as in Patafijali, the condition of samadhr (KKDP, translated in  Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," p. lv, n. 102).  

8. KarA, cited by NirmaIamaQi in KKDP, and quoted in Janaki, ML p. 2.  9. For detailed discussion of mudras in Saiva ritual, see the series of six articles  by S. S. Janaki, "Saiva Mudras I-VI," Kalakshetra Quarterly 5-6 (1983-1984).  Photographs of the mudras may be found in those articles and also in SP 1, Plate 1,  "Mudra," and in Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," Appendix, pp. 276-313. In

10. V$A, from Brunner-Lachaux's French translation, SP 1 p. xxxi.  11. On the grammar of Saiva mantras, see Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux's brief dis cussion in SP 1 pp. xxxi-xxxii. Brunner-Lachaux also includes a list of the mantras  employed in nityapuja in SP 1, Appendix 3, "Mantras utilises pendant Ie culte de  Siva (d'apr&s Somasambhu)."  

12. Vedajfiana apparently quotes MPA here. Other authors construct similar  scales of forms: "Proponents of various schools describe the inherent form of the  highest mokfa in various ways, each in accord with its own views." With this pref ace, Sivagrayogin considers, and criticizes, a whole series of alleged mok$a& held by  other schools (&Pbh pp. 335-52), including the Sivasdmya views of AghoraSiva that  I take here as normative.  

13. This includes both purva and uttara portions of the text. For a summary of  the contents of KA, purvabhaga, see Bruno Dagens, "Analyse du Purvaka mikagama," Bulletin de I'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient 54 (1977): 1-38.  Dagens's rdsum6 is based on N. R. Bhatt's Sanskrit upodghata, in KA, purvabhaga,  pp. iii-xx. Two other agama r6sum6s are available: Ηέΐδηε Brunner, "Analyse du  Kiranagama," Journal asiatique 253 (1965): 309-28; and Brunner, "Analyse du Su prabhedagama," Journal asiatique 255 (1967): 31-60. These two dgamas cover a  more modest array of rituals but are noteworthy for containing all four padas of a  proper agama.  

14. SupA, quoted in SASS p. 58.  

15. The dgamas generally present atmartha and pardrtha as two variants of a  single scheme of piijd, and following their lead I will describe Saiva daily worship  in this study as a ritual unity. However, there are some practical differences be tween the two. Ηόΐέηε Brunner compares them in greater detail in "Atmarthapuja  versus Pararthapuja in the Saiva Tradition," in T. Goudriaan (ed.), The Sanskrit  Tradition and Tantrism (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1990), pp. 4—23. She argues that the  integral model of piijd assumed by later Saiva literature in fact results historically  from the combining of two originally distinct styles of worship, one an "old public  worship" of a rudimentary sort, and the other an inner-oriented "private worship"  maintained by yogic adepts.  

16. Frits Staal has discussed the "embedding" of ritual units within one another  to constitute larger ritual wholes in the Vedic system: "Ritual Syntax," in M. Naga tomi et al. (eds.), Sanskrit and Indian Studies: Essays in Honour of Daniel Η. H.  Ingalls (Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1980), pp. 119-42. As will be clear  throughout this study, I depart strongly from Staal's view that such embeddings are  the empty exercise of syntactic elements without discursive significance.  

17. Svatantra, quoted by Nirmalamani in KKDP p. 293, cited in SP 3 p. 9.  18. To assist those who wish to reenact Saiva piijd visually as well as mentally,  the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute has recently made available an excellent  videotape of K. A. Sabharatna Sivacarya performing an dgama-based worship of  Siva, with comentaiy in English or Tamil. Readers wishing to obtain a copy may  contact Ginni Ishimatsu, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, Univer sity of California, Berkeley, CA 94702, or Richard Davis, Department of Religious  Studies, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.

CHAPTER TWO  

OSCILLATION IN THE RITUAL UNIVERSE  

1. The classic 1918 essay by A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Dance of Shiva," in  The Dance of Shiva (New Delhi: Sagar Publications, 1969), pp. 66-78, remains the  best published account of the significance of Nafaraja as explicated by Tamil Saiva  siddhanta authors. On the origin of this iconic form, there is considerable scholarly  debate. Starting about 970 C.E. the dowager Cola queen Sembiyan MahadevI,  grandmother of Rajaraja, began placing Natarija in a prominent position on the exte 

rior walls of the temples she sponsored, and I would date the elevation of Nafaraja  to most-favored status among Cola images of Siva to her initiative.  2. The Saiva scheme of tattvas clearly draws upon the Samkhya model of emanat ing prakrti but surpasses it by adding additional tattvas and an entire domain, the  pure domain, not envisioned within Samkhya circles. See Dasgupta, History, Vol. 5:  Southern Schools, pp. 164—70, for some discussion of Saiva siddhanta in relation to  Samkhya.  

3. On the emission of language and the alphabet, see KA 2.4—7. Ramakantha gives  a more sophisticated treatment of language in the Saiva siddhanta universe in his  Nddakarika (with a commentary by AghoraSiva), included also in his KalAV (l.S).  See Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat, "Les Nadakarika de RamakaQfha," Bulletin de I'Ecole  Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient 73 (1984): 223-35, for a translation and informed ex 

plication.  

4. For a general study of nyasa as a ritual technique, see Andre Padoux, "Contri butions a l'6tude du mantraSastra," Bulletin de I'Ecole Frangaise d'Extreme-Orient  67 (1980): 59-102.  

5. Further aspects of the five mantras are set forth by Brunner-Lachaux in SP 1,  Appendix 6, 'Xjuelques correspondences entre les visages de SadaSiva et Ie Cosmos."  6. Some texts omit NETRA from the set of angamantras, which may account for its  distinctive treatment in karunyasa and elsewhere.  

7. A much more detailed treatment of Siva's angas may be found in Ηέΐέηβ Brun ner, "Les members de Siva," Asiatische Studien 40 (1986): 89-132.  8. Mj-A kriya 3.3 offers an exception. Here the weapon mantra ASTRA should be  placed on the index finger (tarjani, literally the "threatening finger") because ASTRA  is the mantra that "threatens intruders."  

9. See Brunner-Lachaux, SP 1, Appendix 5, "Purification du corps grassier: les  cinq mandala des 616ments," for a r6sum6 of the features of each domain.  10. A shorter alternative method of bodily purification described in both KKD  and KA involves visualizing the body as an upside-down tree and progressively de stroying it (KKD p. 59). See Brunner-Lachaux's translation of Aghorasiva's ac count in SP 1, Appendix 4, "Purification du corps grossier, autre methode."  11. On the thirty-eight kalas and the kalamantras, see N. R. Bhatt's summary in  RA 1 pp. 25-28 and the table, "Les noms des Kala dans les textes," opposite p. 28.  Hie mantras are derived from five Vedic mantras in Taittiriya Aranydui 10.43-47,  refracted and reformulated within a Saiva grammar of mantras.  12. See N. R. Bhatt, "Introduction," MPA 2 pp. xi-xvi; also Ηέΐέηε Brunner Lachaux, SP 3 p. 242 and Plate 8, "Distribution des mots du vyomavyapin entre les  cinq kala selon !'Adhvanyasa." 

Notes to Chapter Two · 173    

13. The classic secondary account of vastumandala is Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu  Temple, vol. 1, pp. 19-97. Kramrisch utilizes Saiva siddhanta texts, particularly  IP, as well as texts belonging to many other schools, for her synthetic description.  Some of the relevant chapters of IP are translated by Kramrisch in "ISanaSivagu 

rudevapaddhati Kriyapada Chs. xxvi, xxvn," Journal of the Indian Society of Ori ental Art 9 (1941): 151-93; and 'Temple, Door, Throne, Etc.," Journal of the In dian Society of Oriented Art 10 (1942): 210-52 (which translates IP kriya ch. 5, 7,  12, and 13).  

14. The phrase is from Mark Twain, Following the Equator (Hartford: American  Publishing Company, 1898), p. 504, quoted in Diana L. Eck, Banares: City of  Light (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982), p. 19.  

15. Compare the model of a royal court presented in the Aparajitaprccha by the  twelfth-century Gujarati author Bhuvanadeva and described in Ronald Inden, "Hi erarchies of Kings in Early Medieval India," in T. N. Madan (ed.), Way of Life:  King, Householder, Renouncer (Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de  1'Homme, 1982), pp. 99-125.  

16. The architectural prescriptions of AA are lucidly summarized in Bruno  Dagens, Les enseignements architecturaux de VAjitagama et du Rauravagama  (Pondichdry: Institut Fran^ais d'Indologie, 1977), translated into English as Archi tecture in the Ajitagama and the RauravSgama (New Delhi: Sitaram Bhartia Insti tute of Scientific Research, 1984). See Table 5, "Disposition des Assesseurs selon  YAjita" for a diagram of AA's model temple topography.  

17. KA 4.225-69. The UKA ch. 4 also describes these diagrams, in most but not  all cases congruent with the versions in the piuvabh&ga. A still more detailed ac count is found in RA 1 ch. 20-24.  

18. Compare the diagrams based on RA prescriptions, Plates 6-11, and those  based on AA, Plates 2-8.  

19. A fine photograph of well-dressed Hvakumbha and vardhani may be seen in  Bhatt (ed.), MrA, Plate 13, opposite p. 93.  

20. The procedure summarized here is based on "NavakalaSasnapanapaddhati,"  a manuscript belonging to J. Visvanatha Gurukkal of Melmangalam and quoted in  extenso by N. R. Bhatt in RA 1 pp. 92-93, n. 9.  

21. The adiiaivas constitute a special category of "original Saiva" brahmans,  made up of five gotras, who alone qualify to be priests in Saiva siddhanta temples.  For a full discussion, including intriguing remarks concerning their origin, see  Ηέΐέηε Brunner, "Les categories sociales v6diques dans Ie Sivaisme du sud," Jour

CHAPTER THREE  

BECOMING Λ SIVA  

1. V. A. Devasenapathy cites the pleasing analogy of a prince raised among  gypsies:  

The soul is like a prince kidnapped in his infancy by gipsies and brought up by them  in ignorance of his real identity. It is natural for the prince in such a state to behave in  gipsy ways mistaking these as natural to him. But when the king comes and reveals his  identity, the prince will give up his gipsy ways and conduct himself as befits a prince.  

V. A. Devasenapathy, OfHuman Bondage and Divine Grace (Cidambaram: Anna malai University, 1963), p. 48.1 have not been able to locate the textual source of  this simile.  

2. Saiva texts refer to two other categories of fetters: tirobhava (or rodhiakti)  and mahamaya. Tirobh&va, Siva's power of obscuration, is a fetter only in a secon dary sense, says AghoraSiva, while mahamaya affects only beings such as the  VidyeSvaras who dwell in the pure domain (^uddhadhvan) (TPV 17).  

3. The hierarchy of souls described in Chapter 1 is based on the presence or  absence of these three fetters. As bound souls, sakalas, we are affected by all three  categories of fetters (TP 8-15).  

4. The monist commentator Snkumara, discussing Bhojadeva's TP, claims that  the ripening of mala is brought about by the "fire of knowledge" (TPD 9), but  AghoraSiva firmly denies this (TPV 15).  

5. Ηέΐέηβ Brunner-Lachaux discusses the Saiva understanding of karman and its  three types in SP 3 pp. xxii-xxvi.  

6. Saiva authors differ from one another in their discussions of iaktinipata.  SomaSambhu, for instance, identifies saktinipata with the act of initiation, while  AghoraSiva and most subsequent authors view it as a necessary precursor to receiv ing initiation. For helpful discussions of this philosophically ambiguous phenome non, see Brunner-Lachaux, SP 3 p. viii, and Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites,"  pp. cxiv-cxxi.  

7. My descriptions of Saiva diksas are based largely on the SP and KKD. For  translations of samayadiksa procedures, see SP 3 pp. 2-110, and Surdam, "South  Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 1-97.  

8. On the several stages of initiation and corresponding ritual competencies, see  Brunner, "Le sadhaka," Journal asiatique 263 (1975): 411-43.  9. Translations of vi§e$adiks& procedures: SP 3 pp. 112-56, and Surdam, "South  Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 98-112. Brunner-Lachaux argues that samaya and visesa  were initially two phases of a single ritual and were separated into distinct rituals at  a fairly late date (SP 3 pp. xxx-xxxiii); these two in turn may have at an earlier date  been separated from nirvanadlksa, the originally unitary Saiva diksa. To gain an idea  of the variety of Saiva treatments of dikfa generally, see N. R. Bhatt, "Introduc tion," MPA 2 pp. xviii-xxiii.  

10. See SP 3 pp. 157—426, and Surdam, "South Indian Saiva Rites," pp. 113—  271. The amount of discussion SomaSambhu and AghoraSiva devote to each of the  three types of dik$a offer a good initial index of their importance in the Saiva scheme 

Notes to Chapter Four · 175    

of things: in Surdam's translation of KKD, samayadikja gets 96 pages, viiesadiksa 14  pages, and nirvanadlksd 1S8 pages.  

11. Texts refer to this method only as tadanadi, "the set of actions beginning with  striking." For a more detailed discussion of "transportation," see SP 3 pp. 118-25,  and Plates 1 and 2, "Transport de Yatman depuis Ie Coeur du disciple jusqu'k la  matrice de VagTsvan."  

12. The method described here, focusing on five kolas, is only one of six possi ble "paths" (adhvan) along which initiation may proceed: mantras, words, pho nemes, worlds, tattvas, and kalas. As the quotation from UKA below indicates,  however, Saiva siddhanta understands the kalas to encompass the constituents of  the other paths, and hence the method of kola purification offers a more comprehen sive means of dikja (at least from the time of SomaSambhu). On the sixfold path, see  Brunner-Lachaux, SP 3 pp. xiii-xxii.  

13. In SP 3, Brunner-Lachaux provides charts summarizing these englobements:  see Plate 5, "Englobement des rdalitds de TUniverse par Ies cinq kalS'\ Plate 6,  "Ripartition des tattva selon Ies cinq kalS'·, and Plates 7 A-E, displaying the worlds  encompassed within each of the five kalas.  

14. After nirvanadikjd, a Saiva initiate may undergo special additional consecra tions (abhifeku) that grant him particular capacities for action. Most common is the  "priestly consecration" (acaryabhiseka), enabling the recipient to act as priest in per forming rituals on behalf of others. Another consecration grants special mantra  

powers to the adept (sadhakabhiseka). For Soma£ambhu's account of these conse crations, see SP 3 pp. 455-524.  

15. Nirmalamani distinguishes the efficacy of atmaSuddhi according to the wor shiper's stage of initiation. For one who has undergone samayadiksa but not  nirvdnadiksa, atmaxuddhi destroys any obstructions that prevent mantras from  achieving their purposes; for those who have undergone nirvdnadiksa, by contrast, it  helps complete initiation by destroying all newly arisen karman (KKDP p. 60).  

16. See SP 1, Appendix 5, "Purification du corps grossier," for a chart of the  gunas located in each of the five bhutas.  

17. See Brunner-Lachaux's detailed discussion of this parallelism, in SP 3 pp.  396-405.  

18. SomaSambhu's prescriptions for antye$ti are translated in SP 3 pp. 567-618.  For a general discussion of this ritual in the Saiva system, see Davis, "Cremation  and Liberation."

He bases his de scription primarily on the MfA and Narayanakantha's commentary MfAV, on Bho jadeva's TP and AghoraSiva's TPV; he also employs KirA, PA, SP, and a very few  other texts. The passage here relies on MrAV 3.8. See Ηέΐέηβ Brunner's expert trans lation, "Un chapitre du Sarvadarianasanigraham. Le Saivadariana," in Michel Strick man (ed.), Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honour of R. A. Stein (Brussels: Institut  Beige des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1981), pp. 96-140.  

7. For general treatments of the lithic forms and iconographic representations of  SadaSiva, see Brijendra Nath Sharma, Iconography of SadMiva (Delhi: Abhinav  Publications, 1976), and Thomas S. Maxwell, "The Five Aspects of Siva (In The ory, Iconography and Architecture)," Arts International 25 (1982): 41-57.  

8. The list of angas is consistent, but the attributes vary somewhat from text to  text. Compare for instance the discussions in SP 1.3.72-74 and KKD pp. 108-9. As  noted in the previous chapter and implied in the passage quoted here, the angas are  closely related to Ihe six divine qualities (guna) of Siva, acquired also by the initiate  in dlkfd. See Brunner's two long footnotes on the subject, SP 3 pp. 396-405.  

9. The set of weapons held by Sadasiva varies slightly from text to text. KA  specifies two possible sets (4.332-34), while AghoraSiva gives three alternatives  (KKD pp. 98-99). SP 1, Plate 7, "Ayudha de SadaSiva," lists eight different sets of  SadaSiva's weapons attested in diverse agamas. However different, these sets gen erally encompass all the various weapons associated with Siva in his iconic  

(MaheSvara) forms.  

10. Retellings of Siva's puranic escapades are conveniently available in Wendy  Doniger O'Flaherty, Siva: The Erotic Ascetic (Oxford: Oxford University Press,  1973), and Stella Kramrisch, The Presence of Hiva (Princeton: Princeton University  Press, 1981).  

11. RA 2 ch. 35. In his "Preface," N. R. Bhatt concisely summarizes the  MaheSvara forms described in various agama texts (RA 2 pp. ix-xi). Also in this  volume may be found drawings of these forms based on agama prescription.  

12. VA 63.4-5, quoted in SPM 5.151-54. As Dagens notes, the passage  Vedajfiana cites does not include the expected pentad of samharanuirtis.  13. See for instance SP 3.1.27-28, where the guru identifies himself with all five  manifestations of Siva.  

14. For a further discussion of the relationship between "mental" and "concrete"  divine images in Saiva worship, see Ηέΐέηε Brunner, "L'Image Divine dans Ie  Culte Agamique de Siva: Rapport entre 1'image mentale et Ie support concrete du  culte," L'Image Divine. Culte et Meditation dans VHindomsme (Paris: Editions du  Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1990), pp. 9-29.  

15. This is not to say that all lingas are the same. MM goes on to describe a great  many categories of lingas, made of different substances and according to different  dimensions, appropriate for various types of worshipers (MM 33.72-92).

I  thank the author for sending me proofs of her essay at the time I was revising this  chapter. 

Notes to Chapter Four · 177    

17. See for instance KKD ^ivapratisthavidhi, p. 2. Similar sets of eighteen rites  are prescribed for the establishment of an image (pnuimapratiffha) (KA 68.1-6).  18. For a more detailed examination of the reuse of Puru§a imagery in an early  Vaisnava establishment ritual, see Shantanu Phukan, "From the Idol to the Icon:  The Transformation in the Pratima Prati§thana Ceremony" (unpublished).  19. The majority of agamas holds that the divine throne extends from Earth up  to fuddhavidya (KA 4.312, SP 1.3.S6, AA 20.157). Another school of thought, ad hered to by KirA and Narayanakantha, argues that the divine throne extends all the way  up to the Saktitattva (MrAV kriya 3.12).  

20. See Figure 9 here and the more detailed chart of throne stages in SP 1, Plate  5, "Asana-puja."  

21. The identity of this particular Sakti is not certain. She is variously assimi lated to Kurwjalinl, KriyaSakti, and IcchaSakti. (See Brunner's discussion, SP 1 p.  156.) What is never in dispute is that it must be a differentiated form of Sakti at the  base of the divine throne.  

22. The ndga-like description of Ananta in KA calls to mind another famous An anta: the cosmic snake who serves as the couch of Visnu-Narayana. Hie VidyeSvara  Ananta is never identified with Visnu's great servant, but the snake imagery is fre quent enough to suggest that the throne of Visnu has been incorporated into Siva's  more encompassing divine throne. (Brunner raises the question of Ananta's iden tity, in SP 1 pp. 158-60.)  

23. See Brunner's list of the Saktis and the VidyeSvaras, together with her dis cussion of the identity of these Saktis, SP 1 pp. 166-68. It is noteworthy that the  names of the Saktis "are the feminine equivalents of the divine names associated  with Vamadeva in the Taittiriya Aranyaka mantra, whose division served to form the  38 kola of SadaSiva."  

24. These three categories generally include the tattvas of the impure domain as  follows:  

iiva—maya  

vidya—six tattvas from kala to puru$a  

atman—twenty-four tattvas from prakrti to Earth  

These three tattvas also pervade the body: see SP 3, Plate 14, "Decoupage du corps  par Ies trois tattva."  

25. As an alternative method of visualizing the divine throne, Kamikagama de scribes it as a lotus that unfolds as the worshiper constructs it.  

The pedestal is fixed upon all paths (adhvan). Its great feet are the four ages of the  world. Its bulb is the element Earth. The upraised stalk constitutes the tattvas up to  Time. It is decorated with thorns which are the fifty kinds of emotions. Its main node  is the mayatattva. The broad lotus flower is iuddhavidya. The petals are the  VidyeSvaras. This lotus is ornamented with stamens which are the Saktis, and made  splendid by a pericarp and seed where the couple Siva and Sakti are located. (KA  4.316-19)  

Here again the form of the divine throne encompasses both all the constituents of the  impure domain (worlds, ages, tattvas, states of emotion) and the powers or agents  of Siva through which he governs (VidyeSvaras, eight Saktis, Siva and Sakti). 

178 · Notes to Chapter Five    

(Compare KirA kriya 2.19-22 and SSV 48.) Like the divine throne of five stages,  tbis lotus-form throne is a comprehensive ritual construction embodying diva's ac tive presence in the world.  

26. I follow here the account in AA, which differs somewhat from KA and KKD,  primarily because the description in AA seems to me clearer. The main difference  lies in the distinction between siik$mamiirti and vidyadeha.  

21. According to Appayadiksita, still other constituents of reality are contained in  the vidyadeha: the kolas, adhvans, bhuvanas, agamas, and so on ($AC pp. 56-59).  The vidyadeha is of course an inclusive body. Appaya's emphasis on this point  here, however, may relate to his monistic perspective. If Siva is considered the  material as well as instrumental cause of the world, then his SadaSiva form can and  should include all manifest realities as well as his instrumentalities.  

28. There are in fact several formulations of the MOLA mantra, according to the  Siddhantabodha, appropriate to different categories of worshipers. See Brunner Lachaux, "Introduction," SP 1 pp. xxxii-xxxiii. The name PRASADA for this mantra  suggests a homology between mantra and temple (also prasada). Brunner-Lachaux  points to this when describing the final dissolution of the mantra into ParamaSi va:  'This is the summit of the PRASADA: the temple, which is at the same time the tem ple of the body, the complete domain of manifestation, and the mantra that con structs it in ascending it" (SP 1 p. 186, n. 1).  

29. According to Anantasambhu, each portion of the mantra is characterized by  a name, a form, an illumination or color (abha), a pervasion, a location, a duration  of pronunciation (m&tra), a path, and a presiding lord (SSV 37). SP 1, Plate 6,  "Recitation du Prasada-mantra," gives a relatively complete depiction of the man 

tra portions. One may also compare the three additional diagrams of mantra por tions, based on three different texts, in SP 3, Plates 11-13.  

30. This point was emphasized to me by Sabharatna Sivacarya (depicted in these  photographs), who spoke of ascending pronunciation in invocation as the single  most difficult ritual procedure in daily worship. The coordination of simultaneous  actions requires much concentration and training.  

CHAPTER FIVE  

RELATIONS OF WORSHIP  

1. This episode is the frame-story of the MataAgaparameivaragama, the teach ings given by ParameSvara to MataAga: see MPA vidya 1.1-34.  2. There are two main types of arghya: common (samanyarghya) and special  (yiiefarghiya). Common arghya is used generally for rites directed toward subordi nate deities, while special arghya must be used in worshiping Siva. As Brunner Lachaux puts it, "The difference between these two arghya& resides in their com position, but particularly in the nature of the mantras that one recites over the  recipient" (SP 1 p. 138).  

3. KA 5.33-36 gives several alternative sets of substances for preparing arghya,  though the group of eight listed here is the most common set.  

4. Nirmalamani quotes Bhojadeva in describing the formation of the cow mudra:  "When the fingers are woven together by joining little finger with ring finger, and 

Notes to Chapter Five · 179    

middle finger with index finger, the cow mudra will resemble the udder of a cow"  CKKDP p. 46).  

5. The divyamudra employed in this divyadr$fi is described in ML pp. 19-20,  quoted in KKDP pp. 130-31. See the photograph of divyadrsti employed upon enter ing the temple, in ML p. 27.  

6. Attributed to KA by SASS p. 109. Cited in SP 1 p. 101.  

7. The themes may vary in proportion according to the situation of worship.  Texts like KKD that deal with atmartha worship in a private shrine generally stress  acts of hospitality, while KA and other texts prescribing public (parartha) temple  worship give greater emphasis to Siva's lordship. For a fuller account of these di 

vergences between atmartha and parartha, see Brunner, "Atmarthapfija versus  Panirthapfija," pp. 7-12.  

8. See also the lists of twelve, sixteen, and twenty-four upacaras given by KarA,  in SP 1, Appendix 7, "Upacara du culte de Siva."  

9. J. Filliozat and P. Z. Pattabinunin, Parures divines du Sud de Vbide (Pondi chiry: Institut Frangais d'Indologie, 1966), photographically documents the crowns  and ornaments used to decorate the IiAgas and images in South Indian temples.  10. IP p. 56, quoted in SP 1 p. 213.  

11. Some texts provide suitable panegyric. In KKD (pp. 121-23), for instance,  AghoraSiva quotes the stotra& from RA, KirA, KalA, and MPA.  12. Much of this discussion of nirmalya is based on $AC pp. 111-26. This was  repeated in NIlakantha's Kriyasara (assuming that §AC predates Kriyasara), which  Ηόΐέηε Brunner translates and discusses in her article "De la consommation du  nirmalya de Siva," Journal asiatique 256 (1969): 213-63.  

13. Unnamed purana, cited in SAC p. 120.  

14. Readers versed in the Tamil Saiva bhakti tradition will recognize Canda also as  one of the sixty-three Saiva nayanmars, whose story of devotion to Siva is narrated  by Cekkilar in chapter 20 of the Periyapuranam. Eric af Edholm considers more  fully the relation of the Tamil nayanmarCanta. and the agama deity Canda in "Canda and  the Sacrificial Remnants: A Contribution to Indian Gastrotheology," Indologica  Taurinensia 12 (1984): 75-91.  

15. Nirmalamani points out that candapuja is obligatory for the siddhanta wor shiper, while it is prohibited to followers of other Saiva schools (KKDP p. 132).  The significant role of Canda and the notion that nirmalya is too pure for human con sumption appear to be ritual features distinctive to Saiva siddhanta.  16. SupA, quoted in SAC p. 113.
