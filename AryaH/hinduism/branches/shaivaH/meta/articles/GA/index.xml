It&amp;rsquo;s something I have been wondering myself since there is no proper codified text as far as alaMkAra is concerned. As far as temples in TN are concerned, the Agama-s give very brief instructions and do not delve into details. For instance, one encyclopedia I have quotes the particular ratio in which flowers, cloth and jewels must cover the vigraha of deity. There are some basic guidelines that I have encountered.</description>

Felt like re-reading an old judgement: https://tinyurl.com/y9pzm28b¬†This judgement is not without problems &amp;amp; more than anything bears out the inherent flaws of the constitution. Nonetheless, it was a significant victory that was won for ALL Agamika temples by the Adishaiva priestsA remarkable feature of tamil shaivam and of the broader tamil bhakti movement for which I am yet to observe a parallel elsewhere is the veneration of the shaiva priesthood and the fact that this high veneration was given a canonical status.</description>

Regarding the worship of a book by the ‡§â‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Ä‡§∑‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä-s, even this meme, as most would know, has roots in ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Å-‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ. Nothing original. We see an example of that from the ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ of the ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡§Æ, going back to at least 500 years prior to the birth of the ‡§∂‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§•‡•Ä-s‚Äô founder.
There will be a centre for studies (‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡•Ä‡§†) in any of the temple‚Äôs 4 cardinal &amp;amp; 4 intermediate directions of the temple, or its inner circuit or, best, in the comforting presence of images of ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§-s.</description>

Intro by translator I have translated his 16-point essay in Tamizh on the qualifications &amp;amp; duties of an ideal ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§æ i.e. temple administrator. It may be interesting to take a look at this (now) historical document in the light of recent debates.
While several points are ‡§∂‡•à‡§µ-centric, you can read them mutatis mutandis (That is, you can rephrase the ‡§∂‡•à‡§µ points for yourself in another specific framework or a generic one).</description>

The SiddhƒÅnta is still very much dominant in TN. But yes, it did not spread much outside TN. Even UmƒÅpati ≈öivƒÅcƒÅrya did not propagate it outside TN. The decline of the SiddhƒÅnta has two historical phases:
   It was once very dominant in KƒÅ≈õmƒ´ra, Madhyaprade≈õa, Gau·∏ça &amp;amp; Utkala de≈õa-s. By 1000s-1100s, it was rapidly shrinking to the area of the southern states.    Post 1200s: We have evidence suggesting that the SiddhƒÅntƒÅgamas &amp;amp; A·π£·π≠aprakara·πáas (SiddhƒÅnta proper) were well known even in Kar·πáƒÅ·π≠aka though it was getting immensely diluted in Kƒìrala.</description>

The greatest gift of rituals is the reverence it instills in us; not just for the deity but for all beings, all communities. The Agamika tradition involved a number of rites where different individuals (even animals) were honored. Let us see some verses from the kAmikAgamaThe kAmikAgama does not simply concern itself with rituals at temple. After all, the prerequisite for temple worship is, well, a temple which has been built.</description>

      <description>In the ≈öaiva context, your Dharma is ≈öivatvam (≈öiva-Ness). To be omniscient, omnipresent &amp;amp; omnipotent is your true nature &amp;amp; therefore your Dharma. Again, Dharma here is not something you do but something you are. Karmas get done through the bodies, instruments, world &amp;amp; objects (tanu-kara·πáa-bhuvana-bhoga) supplied by MƒÅyƒÅ. The fruits of Karma are also consumed by means of tanu-kara·πáetyƒÅdi. As Karman is gradually burnt off by experience (whether happiness or suffering), your Karman attains pakvam (maturation) &amp;amp; that individual ≈öakti of mala acting on your particular soul, in conjunction with your Karman, will also get pakvatvam.</description>
