The Saiva Age  
— The Rise and Dominance of Saivism During the Early Medieval Period —  
Alexis SANDERSON 

The early medieval period, from about the fifth century to the thirteenth, saw a decline in the role of Srauta sacrifice in the religious ceremonies under- ´ taken by Indian rulers. But it was not that kings turned aside from the brahman ical tradition in a fundamental sense. They continued to uphold the brahmanical social order of the castes and disciplines (varn.¯a´sramadharmah.) and they were commonly commended in inscriptions from the fifth to the eighth centuries for having rigorously imposed it on their subjects. We see this in the case of the Maukhari Harivarman in the fifth century, the Mahar¯ aj¯ adhir ¯ aja Gopacandra of ¯ Vanga and the Parivr ˙ ajaka Mah ¯ ar¯ aja Sam ¯ . ks.obha of D. abhalar ¯ ajya in the sixth, ¯ the Pus.yabhuti Prabh ¯ akaravardhana of Kanyakubja, Bh ¯ askaravarman of Pr ¯ ag- ¯ jyotis.a, the Maitraka Kharagraha II Dharmaditya of Valabh ¯ ¯ı, the Gurjara Dadda ¯ III of Bharukaccha in the seventh, and the Licchavi Sivadeva of Nepal at the ´ turn of the seventh and eighth.1 The same claim is seen in the account of the

history of Kashmir before the advent of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty in the seventh cen tury given in the twelfth by the Kashmirian historian Kalhan. a. His chronology for this early phase of his country’s history is confused, but it is likely that we should assign to the fifth or sixth century the king Gopaditya whom he com- ¯ mends for having restored the first and perfect Age through his regard for the castes and brahmanical disciplines.2 He also reports a popular belief of his time that in order to promote the orthodox brahmanical social order the Hephthalite Mihirakula, who ruled Kashmir in the early sixth century, had settled natives of Aryade ¯ sa in his kingdom, which was then, we are told, devoid of the true religion ´ (dharmah.), being overrun by Dards and Tibetans.3 

Seeing these claims of the royal imposition of the varn.¯a´sramadharmah. one thinks of the non-geographical definition of territory fit for brahmanical rites (yaj ˜niyo de´sah.) formulated by Manu’s commentator Medhatithi during the ninth ¯ or tenth century, namely that it is any land in which a conquering brahmanical king settles the four caste-classes and imposes on the rest of the population the status of untouchables (can. d.¯alah.). This definition served, I propose, to accommo date the fact of the territorial expansion of brahmanical society into new regions that was one of salient features of the early medieval period.4

Thereafter he performed a terrible penance’. S ´ TEIN (1979, p. 46), no doubt faithfully reproducing the reading of the codex archetypus, gives pun. y ¯a c ¯arapravartanam rather than pun. y ¯ac ¯arapravartane and this leaves him no alter native other than to take not only d ¯arun. am.tapah. but also this as the object of the verb: “he performed a terrible penance, and re-established pious observances”. But the reading is unacceptable. For even if one can believe, as I cannot, that pun. y ¯ac ¯ara pravartanam. vyatanot is not too inelegant an expression for an author of Kalhan. a’s calibre, there remains the fact that it requires us to believe also that vyatanot gov erns two objects even though the conjunction necessary for this interpretation is lacking. I have therefore emended to pun. y ¯ac ¯arapravartane, which, taken as an instance of the use of the locative of purpose (nimittasaptam¯ı), yields an entirely appropriate meaning and supposes a scribal error that is readily explained by the ease with which readers of the Kashmirian script can mistake -e for -am., the com mon substitute for -am. Furthermore, STEIN’s rendering of ¯aryade´sy ¯an sam.sth ¯apya as “after killing the inhabitants of Aryade ¯ sa” is, in my view, much less probable ´ than the alternative adopted here, which is to take the verb form sam.sth ¯apya in its contextually more appropriate meaning, namely ‘having settled’.

Thus the first centuries of this period are presented in our sources as marked not by the decline of brahmanism but rather by its imposition, rein forcement, and expansion. Moreover, there is abundant epigraphical evidence of kings throughout this time bringing Vaidika brahmins into their kingdoms by making them grants of tax-exempt land,5thereby extending the penetration of brahmanical culture while facilitating the administration of their territories and promoting agricultural development.6 

Nonetheless, while kings continued to accept their role as the guardians of the brahmanical order (varn.¯a´sramaguruh.), their personal religious commitment generally took the form of Buddhism, Jainism, or, more commonly, devotion to Siva, Vis ´.n. u, the Sun-God (Surya/ ¯ Aditya), or the Goddess (Bhagavat ¯¯ı), the deities of the new initiatory religions, allegiances that were commonly declared in their inscriptions by the inclusion amid their royal titles of epithets that mean ‘entirely

By the same standard, if some king belonging to the Ks.atriya or other [suitable caste class] and of orthodox [brahmanical] observance were to conquer foreigners [in their lands], settle communities of the four caste-classes [there], and impose on those for eigners the status of untouchables, just as in the brahmanical heartland of India north of the Vindhyas (Ary ¯ avarta), then those territories too would be fit for the ¯ performance of [Vaidika] sacrifices’. 

5 On the duty of the king to donate [tax-free] land and other valuables to learned Vaidika brahmins (vipr ¯ah., ´srotriy ¯ah.) see, e.g., Y ¯aj ˜navalkyasmr.ti 1. 315–320; 1. 323: n ¯atah. parataro dharmo nr. p ¯an.¯am. yad ran.¯arjitam | viprebhyo d¯ıyate dravyam.. . . ‘There is no higher religious obligation for kings than that of bestowing the wealth they acquire through war on learned Vaidika brahmins . . . ’; Vis.n. usmr.ti 3.81–82: br ¯ahman.ebhya´s ca bhuvam. pratip ¯adayet . . . ‘He should bestow land on brah mins’. On the king’s duty not to tax learned Vaidikas see Manusmr.ti 7.133ab: mriyam ¯an. o ’py ¯adad¯ıta na r ¯aj ¯a ´srotriy ¯at karam ‘Even though dying [through poverty] a king may not levy a tax from a learned Vaidika’. The giving of land to learned brahmins is already advocated at length as the king’s religious duty in the Mah ¯abh ¯arata (Anu´s ¯asanaparvan, Adhy ¯aya 61); and that passage includes an injunction that it should be read to the king immediately after his consecration (13.61.36: abhis.icyaiva nr. patim.´sr ¯avayed imam ¯agamam).

For the same in the Far South in Pallava and Cola times see KARASHIMA 1984, especially pp. 3, 36–40, and 129; and STEIN 1994, especially pp. 63–89 and 141–172. The migration of groups of north-Indian Vaidika brahmins as recipients of royal grants is the subject of DATTA 1989.

devoted’ to the founder or deity of whichever of these religions they favoured. 

THE DOMINANCE OF SAIVISM ´ 

Among these alternatives devotion to Siva was the most commonly adopted. ´ During this period the epithet paramam ¯ahe´svarah.‘entirely devoted to Siva’ is ´ the most frequently encountered in declarations of the religious adherence of rulers;7 and of the many temples surviving or reported in inscriptions that were established by rulers and other notables from the late sixth century onwards in the subcontinent, the Khmer realm, the Cham kingdoms of Indo-China, and the kingdoms of Java and Bali, those dedicated to the worship of this god are much the most numerous.8 

The preponderance of Saivism during this period is also revealed by evidence ´ that all the other religious traditions competing for patronage were colonized or 

7 The royal epithet paramam ¯ahe´svarah. first appears in the epigraphical record in the fourth century in Andhra, in an inscription of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayana Mah ¯ ar¯ aja De- ¯ vavarman of Veng˙ ¯ıpura (EI 9:7, ll. 1–7), probably the earliest of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayanas ¯ in our records since this inscription alone is in Prakrit: sir¯ıvijayave ˙ng¯ıpur ¯a bha gavato cittarathas ¯amip ¯ad ¯anujjh ¯atassa bappabhat.t.¯arakap ¯adabhattasya parama m ¯ahessarassa s ¯ala ˙nk ¯ayanassa asamedhay ¯ajino mah ¯ar ¯ajasir¯ıvijayadevavammassa vayan.ena . . . ‘From victorious Veng˙ ¯ıpura: by the command of the S´ ala ¯ nk˙ ayana, ¯ who has performed the Asvamedha sacrifice, the venerable Mah ´ ar¯ aja Vijayadeva- ¯ varman, favoured by [his kuladevat ¯a, the Siva] Citrarathasv ´ amin, loyal to [his] ¯ venerable father, entirely devoted to Siva . . . ’. It is mostly found in inscriptions but ´ occasionally appears on coinage. Thus the coins of Kr.s.n. araja, the Kalacuri king ¯ of Mahis ¯ .mat¯ı, who ruled c. 550–575, have on their reverse, (with corrected ortho graphy): paramam ¯ahe´svara m ¯at ¯apitr. p ¯ad ¯anudhy ¯ata ´sr¯ıkr.s.n. ar ¯aja (MIRASHI, CII 4i p. clxxxi). This is the standard term, as is confirmed by its use in literary sources. But we also find the synonym atyantam ¯ahe´svarah.(e.g. CII 5:3, l. 8: Vak¯ at¯ .aka Pr.thiv¯ısena I, late fourth century), and, though very rarely and not to my knowledge in any inscription, parama´saivah.(PETECH 1984, pp. 57 and 61: the twelfth-century Nepalese kings Indradeva and Anandadeva in the colophons of manuscripts). That ¯ the Taddhita m ¯ahe´svarah.is to be understood as formed from the name Mahesvara ´ in the meaning ‘devoted to Mahesvara’ ( ´ mahe´svarabhaktah.), i.e. ‘devoted to Siva’, ´ is proved beyond doubt by the occurrence in inscriptions of analytic renderings of parallel terms. Thus where the affiliation is with Vis.n. u (/Bhagavat) we see not only paramabh ¯agavatah. but also param. bhagavadbhaktah. and in the case of the Sun-god (Surya/ ¯ Aditya) we see both ¯ paramasaurah. and param ¯adityabhaktah.. And there are some cases in which the name of the deity precludes any but the analytic form. Thus where the deity is the Goddess or Mahabhairava we see ¯ param. bha gavat¯ıbhaktah. and atyantasv ¯amimah ¯abhairavabhaktah.. For all these epithets see MIRASHI CII 3, pp. 253–254, n. 3. 

8 This can readily be observed by perusing the published volumes of EITA. On the pre-eminence of Saivism among the Khmers up to the fall of Angkor see S ´ ANDER SON 2005a, pp. 402–421. For the situation in Karnataka, where Saiva foundations ´ greatly outnumbered others throughout the perod from the fifth to fourteenth cen turies see p. 298.For Kashmir see p. 298, and for Andhra see p. 300.

profoundly influenced by it. In the first part of this study I shall present this evidence for each religion in turn, but with particular attention to Buddhism. In the second I shall attempt to explain the factors that enabled Saivism to attain ´ this dominant position. 

THE INCORPORATION OF S´ AKTISM ¯ 

The worship of the Goddess was progressively subsumed within Saivism, ´ being promoted by its adherents as a higher form of that religion.9 The Saiva ´ mainstream was, as one might expect, focused on Siva. This is so in the ´ earliest forms of the religion, which later Saivas would call the Atim ´ arga, ¯ practised by such Saiva ascetics as the P ´ a¯nc˜ arthikas, L ¯ akulas, and So- ¯ masiddhantins, and it continued to be so in the Siddh ¯ anta, the core tradition of ¯ the Mantramarga that emerged out of the Atim ¯ arga from about the fifth century ¯ onwards, first in the corpus of Ni´sv ¯asa scriptures10 and then in a number of others, notable among which are the P ¯arame´svara (Paus. karap ¯arame´svara), the Sv ¯ayambhuvas ¯utrasam. graha, the Rauravas ¯utrasam. graha, the Mata ˙nga p ¯arame´svara, the Sarvaj ˜n ¯anottara, the K ¯alottara in a number of redactions, the Kiran. a, the Par ¯akhya, the Mr. gendra, the Br.hatk ¯alottara, the Mayasam. graha, the Devy ¯amata, and the Mohac ¯ud. ottara, the last three representing a sub-corpus of texts of more restricted application concerned with the rituals of the installa tion of images and the consecration of temples, an area in which officiants of the Siddhanta were the dominant operatives. But as this Saiddh ¯ antika core grew ¯ it was progressively surrounded by a diverse array of related liturgical systems for the propitiation of various forms of the ferocious deity Bhairava, seen by his devotees as a higher, more esoteric manifestation of Siva, and of forms of ´ the Goddess seen as embodiments of Siva’s divine power ( ´´saktih.). The Saiva ´ scriptures devoted to the cult of Bhairava came to be known collectively as the Mantrap¯ıt.ha or Mantra Corpus, headed by the Svacchandatantra, which teaches the cult of Svacchandabhairava and his consort Aghoresvar ´ ¯ı, and the earlier among those devoted to cults of Goddesses as the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha or Vidya Corpus, ¯11

On the probable date of its earliest part see GOODALL and ISAACSON 2007. 11 For the use of the term p¯ıt.ham in this context in the meaning ‘corpus’ or ‘collec tion’ see Tantr ¯aloka 37.18c–19c1, quoting or paraphrasing the lost Ananda´s ¯astra ¯: ´sr¯ımad ¯ananda´s ¯astr ¯adau proktam. bhagavat ¯a kila k sam ¯uhah. p¯ıt.ham etac ca dvidh ¯a daks.in. av ¯amatah.| mantro vidyeti ‘The Lord has taught in such scriptures as the Ananda ¯ that p¯ıt.ham [here means] the corpus [of the non-Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva scrip- ´ tures].

headed by (1) the Jayadrathay ¯amala, also known as the Sira´scheda ´, consisting of four parts called hexads (s. at.kam) because each is approximately six thousand verses in length, which teaches the cult of Kalasam ¯ . kars.an.¯ı or Kal¯ ¯ı in the first and those of numerous goddesses worshipped as her esoteric embodiments in the remaining three parts, evidently added at a later date—closely related to parts of this huge corpus are the scriptures of the Kal¯ ¯ıkula, K ¯al¯ıkulakrama sadbh ¯ava, K ¯al¯ıkulapa ˜nca´sataka and others, that were the scriptural basis of the Kal¯ ¯ıkula Kal¯ ¯ı cult known as the Krama, Mahanaya, or Mah ¯ artha—, (2) the ¯ Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata, which teaches the cult of the goddesses Para, Par ¯ apar ¯ a, ¯ and Apara, to which the ¯ M ¯alin¯ıvijayottara is related, the scripture taken as the foundation of the Trika variant of S´ akta ¯ Saivism expounded in the ´ Tantr ¯aloka of the great Kashmirian Saiva Abhinavagupta ( ´ fl. c. 975–1025), (3) the Picumata or Brahmay ¯amala, which teaches the cult of the goddess Can. d. a K¯ ap¯ alin ¯ ¯ı and numerous related Kalpas, and (4) the texts of the v ¯amasrotah., of which only the V¯ın.¯a´sikha has come down to us intact, which teach the cult of the four goddesses Jaya, Vijay ¯ a, Jayant ¯ ¯ı/Ajita, and Apar ¯ ajit ¯ a, the sisters of the god Tumburu, ¯ venerated as an aspect of Siva. ´ 12 

Mantra[p¯ıt.ha] and the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha’. The terms ‘right’ and ‘left’ assigned to the two P¯ıt.has follow the common notion that these are the relative positions of the male/masculine and female/feminine, Mantras being masculine and the deities they embody male and Vidyas being feminine and their deities female. ¯ 

12 The distinction in terms of left and right between the two P¯ıt.has in the passage of the Ananda ¯ cited in the preceding footnote must not be confused with that between the right current (daks.in. asrotah.) and the left current (v ¯amasrotah.) of the Saiva scriptures, which derives from the fact that these are thought to have ´ emerged from the right and left faces of the five-faced composite Sada¯siva, those ´ of Aghora (Bhairava) and the feminine Vamadeva respectively. For of the texts of ¯ the two P¯ıt.has only those of the cult of the four sisters are assigned to the lat ter. The Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata and the Picumata are both assigned to the former, while according to itself the first S. at.ka of the Jayadrathay ¯amala is a hybrid of both (ubhay ¯atmakam); see SANDERSON 2002, pp. 1–2. Of the other three faces the front and rear, the faces of Tatpurus.a and Sadyojata, are seen as the source of the ¯ Garud ¯ . atantras and Bhutatantras, texts concerned respectively with procedures for ¯ the curing of the effects of poisons and demonic possession, while the upper face, that of ¯Is´ana, is seen as the source of the scriptures of the Siddh ¯ anta, revealing that ¯ this, unlike the distinction between the two P¯ıt.has, is a Siddhanta-centric system ¯ of classification. It is adapted by the non-Saiddhantika Abhinavagupta as the basis ¯ of his esoteric account of the nature of the Saiva canon in the ´ M ¯alin¯ıvijayav ¯artika but only by adding a sixth, upper-upper current (¯urdhvordhvasrotah.) above the Siddhanta as the source of the non-dualistic Kaula ( ¯ S´ akta) revelation that he takes ¯ to be the ultimate ground of the entire canon.

[[46]]

To these we may add the scriptures of two later S´ akta cults, those of the ¯ goddesses Kubjika and Tripurasundar ¯ ¯ı. The scriptures of the former, the Ku bjik ¯amata and related texts such as the S. at.s ¯ahasra, do not claim to be part of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha. But they are closely related to, and draw heavily on, the sub corpus of texts within the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha that is headed by the Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata and is asssociated with the S´ akta system that would be developed under the ¯ 

name of the Trika: the Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata itself, the [Trika]kularatnam ¯al ¯a, the Tantrasadbh ¯ava, the Devy ¯ay ¯amala, and the Tri´sirobhairava. Also allied in character is the Nity ¯as. od. a´sik ¯arn. ava or V ¯amake´svar¯ımata, the fundamental scripture of the cult of the goddess Tripurasundar¯ı. This, which became the most widely established of India’s S´ akta cults, has no direct antecedents in the ¯ 

Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha literature, but is rather an independent development out of an ear lier S´ akta tradition of the propitiation of goddesses known as the Nity ¯ as in which ¯ rites for success in love predominated.13 This early cult was eclipsed by its 

¯ı´s ¯anavaktraniry ¯at ¯at siddh ¯ant ¯ad bhedam ¯adi´sat ‘I shall return now to the matter in hand. The nondualistic upper-upper stream is present when the various modes of consciousness are [still] in the state of [primal] emission within the Goddess [Para]. ¯ From this [state of fusion] are created the Saurabharga´sikh ¯a and other such [nond ualistic (Kaula) scriptures]. And the Supreme Lord has spoken [to this effect] in the Bharga´sikh ¯a [itself], saying, “This knowledge, O beloved, is the supreme product of the upper face”. By using the word supreme [here] in reference to the nature of the consciousness that has arisen from this upper [face] he shows that he means some thing different from [and superior to] the Siddhanta, which has come forth from the ¯ face of ¯Is´ana’. ¯ 

13 The distinctness of this tradition is expressed in the Kum ¯ar¯ıkhan. d. a of the Manth ¯anabhairava in an account of the hierarchy of the various soteriolo gies. It places those who follow the scripture(s) of the Nityas above those of ¯ the Atimargic traditions (Mausula, Vaimala, L ¯ akula) and below those of the ¯ Bhairava corpus comprising the scriptures of the left and right currents. Above this it places six S´ akta Tantras ( ¯ par ¯as. at.kam): three of the Trika (S. ad. ardha [=M ¯alin¯ıvijayottara], Bhairava[kula], and V¯ır ¯aval¯ı, then the K ¯al¯ıkula [texts] of the Krama, and finally itself, in two scriptural levels. It is significant that it does not put the Nitya cult on the level of its ¯ S´ akta Tantras or even on ¯ that of the Bhairavatantras below them; see f. 213r3–7 (Muktisam. grahas ¯utra, vv. 108–114c): *musul ¯ayudhahast ¯an ¯am.(em. : mausul ¯ayudhahast ¯an ¯am.

much more successful successor. But nonetheless evidence of it has survived, attesting two forms. One is taught in the Nity ¯akaula, of which a single, in complete manuscript has come down to us in Nepal. Here the goddess Tripura¯ is surrounded by a circle of twelve deities comprising eleven Nitya goddesses ¯ and Kamadeva, the Indian Cupid. ¯14 The other has been preserved in the eclec 

tic Manth ¯anabhairava, whose Siddhakhan. d. a contains detailed manual-like in structions for a S´ akta cult of Tripur ¯ a and nine Nity ¯ as with K ¯ amadeva as her ¯ consort.15 The earlier prominence of the Nitya cult is indicated by the fact that ¯ a syncretistic text of the cult of Kubjika, the ¯ *Ci ˜ncin.¯ımatas ¯arasamuccaya, con tains a section drawn from the Nity ¯akaula, or from some lost text closely re lated to it, in which it sets out this cult as the ‘teaching of the southern or

For those ´ versed in the scriptural tradition of the Nine Nityas it is ¯ Sivatattva. Above that ´ is Bhairava, transcending [all] the five Causes: Brahma, Vis ¯ .n. u, Rudra, ¯Isvara, and ´ Sada¯siva]. This, eternal bliss, is the final destination of the T ´ antrikas of the Tantras ¯ of the eight [Bhairavas] [v. 132: the Nis. kala-Svacchandabhairava, the Sakala Svacchandabhairava, the Bahur ¯upabhairava, the Aghor¯ı´sabhairava, the Vy ¯adhi bhaks. abhairava, the Candragarbhabhairava, the Vij ˜n ¯anabhairava, the Tumburu bhairava (perhaps =the V¯ın ¯a´sikha), and the Amr.te´svarabhairava (=Netratantra)]. It is beyond the [universe] that culminates in Samana and is established in [the ¯ two divisions of the Bhairavatantras, those of] the left [current (v ¯amasrotah.)] and [those of] the right [daks.in. asrotah.]. The truth—there is no [room for] doubt in this matter—is that liberation is [attained in each these systems but] in the manner of ascending a ladder. Above that are the six ascending [divisions of the scrip tures] of Para. The first division is the ¯ S. ad. ardha (=M ¯alin¯ıvijaya, vv. 125a and 133cd), the second the Bhairava[kula] (=Klinn ¯anvayayoga, v. 134a), the third the V¯ır ¯aval¯ı (=V¯ır ¯aval¯ıkul ¯amn ¯aya, v. 134c), and the fourth the K ¯al¯ıkula [scriptures] (=K ¯alik ¯akrama, v. 134d). Above this is the Ady ¯avat ¯ara ¯[of the Pascim ´ amn ¯ aya], and ¯ above that the Anahata [revelation] called ¯ Kul ¯alik ¯a[mn ¯aya]’. It is striking that this passage omits the Saiddhantikas. It is therefore likely that the text has lost a line ¯ or verse here. This suspicion is strengthened by the verses that follow. For in these the order of systems is repeated with ´saivam, i.e. the Siddhanta’s scriptures, be- ¯ tween the p ¯a´supatam and the eight Bhairavatantras (v. 128bcd: tath ¯a p ¯a´supatam. mahat | saivam ´.tasya vi´ses. am.tu bhairav ¯as.t.akanirn. ayam). Since the passage also omits Sada¯sivatattva it is probable that it was this level that was assigned to the ´ Saiddhantika system in the lost line or verse. To assign the Saiddh ¯ antikas to ¯ Sada¯sivatattva would, of course, be to disdain their claim that their ´ param. padam is in fact Sivatattva. ´

der’ (daks.in. aghar ¯amn ¯ayah.), grouping it with the cult of Kubjika, the cult of ¯ Kal¯ ¯ı (Kal¯ ¯ıkula) in a form attested in the Jayadrathay ¯amala and the related cor pus of the scriptures of the Krama or Mahanaya, and a form of ¯ S´ akta worship ¯ agreeing closely with that found in the Trika, calling these the teachings of the western, northern, and eastern orders respectively (Pascimaghar ´ amn ¯ aya, Ut- ¯ taragharamn ¯ aya, and P ¯ urvaghar ¯ amn ¯ aya). ¯ 

The S´ aktism of this tetradic schema of the directional ¯ Amn ¯ ayas can be dis- ¯ tinguished broadly from the earlier S´ aktism of the Vidy ¯ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha by a marked ten dency to expurgate one of the most conspicuous features of the latter, namely its embeddedness in the intensely transgressive tradition of Kap¯ alika asceti- ¯ cism whose roots lie in the Somasiddhantin division of the Atim ¯ arga. Since the ¯ S´ aktism of the ¯ Amn ¯ ayas refers to itself as Kaula we may use this term to des- ¯ ignate these post-Kap¯ alika developments. However, like most terms applied to ¯ traditions subject to change through time it serves at best to indicate a tendency rather than an absolute distinction. For while the cults of Tripurasundar¯ı and Kubjika adhered to this mode of self-definition and the Trika that developed out ¯ of the Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata also came to do so,16 the cult of Kal¯ ¯ı that came to constitute the Kaulas’ Northern Teaching (uttar ¯amn ¯ayah.) remained both Kaula in its self-definition and firmly Kap¯ alika in its practise. ¯17 

16 On the anti-Kap¯ alika stance of the mature Trika see S ¯ ANDERSON 2005c, pp. 118– 119, fn. 74. 

17 For the Kap¯ alika/Mah ¯ avratin asceticism of practitioners of the Uttar ¯ amn ¯ aya, ¯ that is to say of the Kal¯ ¯ıkula and Krama/Mahanaya, see S ¯ ANDERSON 2007a, pp. 293–294 (Cakrabhanu, ¯¯Is´an¯ ¯ı, and Jaiyaka), 323 (Cakrapan¯ .inatha, author of ¯ the Bh ¯avopah ¯arastotra). Concerning the date of Cakrapan¯ .inatha I was able to ¯ say in 2007a (p. 417) only that he was earlier than his commentator Ramyadeva, who was later than Ks.emaraja, which is to say, next to nothing. However, ¯ since then I have read a Nepalese manuscript, NGMPP C114/22, which con tains his Bh ¯avopah ¯arastotra under the title Bh ¯avopah ¯arap ¯uj ¯a, and this enables us to include him among relatively early authors, since the manuscript is dated in 1158/9. To the Kashmirian exponents of the Krama identified as follow ers of the Kap¯ alika observance in 2007a I now propose to add one more. Ac- ¯ cording to a manuscript of the Chumm ¯asam. ketaprak ¯a´sa that I had not seen at that time, which contains the final verses of the work that are lacking in the one manuscript that I had seen then, the redactor of this text attributed to Nis.kriyananda was one Ananta ¯ sakti. He is described there as ´ mudr ¯adharah.(A, f. 11r7–9): sam.s ¯arasam. bhramacayapravibh ¯agabandhasam. bandhasam. ks. aya*gatir (em. : gater Cod.) avikalpam ¯urtih.| s ¯aks.¯ad an ¯abiladhiy ¯a laghuv ¯akkramen. a mudradharas ¯ tu vidadhe tad ananta´saktih.. This expression I take to have the same meaning as pa ˜ncamudr ¯adharah.‘wearer of the five sect marks [of the Kap¯ alika/Mah ¯ avratin]’; see, e.g., ¯ Sv ¯ayambhuvas ¯utrasam. graha, Pat.ala 14 (s. at.samayabhedah.), one of the chapters that is not part of the original work of this name, vv. 19–20: caturda´sapram ¯an.ena yuktam. k ¯ap ¯alam ucyate | k ¯ap ¯ale ca vratam. mukhyam.sarvap ¯apanikr.ntanam | tasmin vratam.cared yas tu s. an. m ¯as ¯an mu ktim ¯apnuy ¯at | pa ˜ncamudr ¯adharah.´s ¯antah.samay ¯ac ¯arap ¯alakah.; and Kubjik ¯amata [[49]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In general we may say that these non-Saiddhantika texts with their ¯ strongly S´ akta orientation emerged after the Siddh ¯ anta or at least after the ¯ emergence of its earliest scriptures. Thus, for example, it is clear in my view that the Svacchandatantra was redacted after the formation of the Saiddhantika ¯ Ni´sv ¯asa corpus, the Tantrasadbh ¯ava after the Svacchanda, the Kubjik ¯amata after the Tantrasadbh ¯ava,18 the first hexad of the Jayadrathay ¯amala after the Kubjik ¯amata,19 and the remaining three hexads after the first.20 However, I see no reason to conclude that all that is found in the non-Saiddhantika corpus is ¯ post-Saiddhantika and some grounds for thinking that some elements may be as ¯ old or older. This may be the case with the cult of the four sisters of Tumburu. For that is known to the Buddhist Dharmak¯ırti (fl. c. 550–650),21 and the first two folios of a post-scriptural text on this cult, the *Dev¯ıtantrasadbh ¯avas ¯ara, written in learned style in the Ary ¯ a metre, have survived among the Buddhist ¯ manuscripts uncovered in Gilgit in 1931. They may be assigned on palaeo graphical grounds to around the middle of the sixth century.22 A second area

He is probably one with the Anantasakti who wrote the published commentary on the Krama’s ´ V ¯at ¯ulan ¯athas ¯utra but probably not with the Anantasakti who has left us a com- ´ mentary (Vis. amapadasam. keta), as yet unpublished, on the Bahur ¯upagarbhastotra; see SANDERSON 2007a, p. 344.

22 No title appears in the surviving fragment of this text. The title assigned here is a guess based on the unknown author’s description of his work in verses 3 and 4. There he says that he is extracting the fundamentals (s ¯arah.) of the Essence of the Tantras (tantrasadbh ¯avah.) of the [four] Goddesses (dev¯ın ¯am) that had been received from Siva by a sage identified only as the ornament of the lin- ´ eage of Atri: 3 ¯atreyava ˙n´satilakenoktam.´sarv ¯ad av ¯apya yat p ¯urvam.| suramuni nar ¯asur ¯an.¯am. dev¯ın ¯am.tantrasadbh ¯avam.k 4 tasm ¯ad aham apy adhun ¯a vaks. ye sam. hr.tya s ¯aram ¯ary ¯abhih.| spas.t.atar ¯aks. arapa ˙nktibhir avi´s ¯aladhiy ¯am. *prabodh ¯aya (em. : pravodh ¯ata Cod.) ‘The Essence of the Tantras of the Goddesses was received of old from Siva by the ornament of the lineage of Atri and taught to the gods, sages, ´ men, and titans. I in turn have summarized its fundamentals and shall now declare them in Ary ¯ a verses whose lines of syllables will be completely clear in meaning, for ¯ the instruction of those of modest intellect’. The script is the stage of proto-S´ arad ¯ a¯ that Prof. Lore SANDER has called Gilgit/Bamiyan type 2 and also Sonderschrift 1. I stumbled upon the first folio (3221–3222) while searching the facsimiles of the Gilgit manuscripts for proto-Tantric Buddhist materials and communicated this un expected discovery to Somdev VASUDEVA, then my student, who promptly located the second folio (3340–3341) and presented convincing palaeographical arguments for the date of the manuscript proposed here (email of 7.12.2000), pointing to the presence of the archaic tripartite ya ligature, the occurrence of the old style of hr., and the Gupta style ru. The text teaches the Mantras of the four Dev¯ıs, who, it says, were made manifest at the beginning of creation so that men could attain supernat-

of the non-Saiddhantika canon that is likely to be very early in origin is that ¯ of the Yamalatantras assigned to the Vidy ¯ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha, represented in our surviving manuscripts by the 12000-verse Picumata, also called the Brahmay ¯amala. For the Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a, whose earliest surviving manuscript was completed in 810, lists seven Yamala texts, beginning with the ¯ Brahmay ¯amala, as Tantras of the Mother Goddesses (m ¯atr.tantr ¯an.i).23 The date of the text itself is still a matter of debate; but it is unlikely to have been composed later than the end of the seventh century or earlier than the sixth.24 It is certainly

HUM¯.-PHAT.- viniyuktam a ˙nku´sam etat). The V¯ın.¯a´sikha, our only complete surviving Tantra of the v ¯amasrotah., teaches the four Dev¯ıs (vv. 30c–32b), Tumburu (vv. 29c–30b), and the Anku ˙ sa (v. 41d etc.), but not the D ´ ut¯ ¯ıs or Kinkaras. For the fuller pantheon see, ˙ e.g., Devy ¯amata, f. 40r1: jay ¯a ca vijay ¯a caiva jayant¯ı c ¯apar ¯ajit ¯a | d ¯utibhih. ki ˙nkaraih. s ¯ardham.sam. vr.tas *tumburuh.(corr : tumburum.

The expression ˙ s ¯arthav ¯ahah.‘the [international] trader’ in v. 17b (v. 17ab: pran. avam.tum. burusahitam.s ¯arthav ¯ah ¯a +) no doubt refers to Tumburu, who is so described in the Buddhist version of this cult taught in the Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa (47.29b, 52a, 54c, p. 413, l. 12, etc.). According to that source the four sisters and Tumburu are to be depicted sailing in a ship with Tumburu at the helm (47.24: nauy ¯anasam ¯ar ¯ud. h ¯a<h. > sabhr ¯atr.sahapa ˜ncam ¯a<h. > | karn. adh ¯aro *’rthacit (tentative conj. : ’thacit Ed.) t ¯as ¯am. *tumburun ¯amasam.j ˜nitah.(em. : tum burur n ¯ama sam.j ˜nitah. Ed.). See also here p. 130. This depiction is also prescribed in the Saiva ´ Pi ˙ngal ¯amata, f. 28v5–6 (Citr ¯adhik ¯ara, v. 35): jay ¯ady ¯a´s cakrag ¯as tadvat pa ˙nktisth ¯a v ¯a likhet | kram ¯at n ¯av ¯ar ¯ud. h ¯a´s ca v ¯a likhy ¯as tumburuh. karn. adh ¯arakah. ‘He should depict Jaya[, Vijay ¯ a, Jayant ¯ ¯ı,] and [Aparajit ¯ a] forming a circle or in a ¯ line. Alternatively he may depict them on board a ship with Tumburu as the helms man’. For the early date of this cult see also here p. 129. 

23 See SANDERSON 2001, pp. 6–7, fn. 4 and here p. 229 (171.127–130b) and a discus sion of the titles it contains. The oldest manuscript is dated in the year 234. For this date and its equivalence to A.D. 810 see ADRIAENSEN, BAKKER and ISAAC SON 1994, p. 326. That the era of the date is that of the Licchavi Manadeva ¯ (=Am. suvarman) was first proposed by W ´ ITZEL (1986, p. 256, n. 9). The date of the commencement of this unnamed era which is seen in Nepalese inscriptions that begin during the reign of the Nepalese king Manadeva was determined to fall in ¯ A.D. 576 on the basis of Tibetan evidence by Luciano PETECH (1961). Previously it had been assumed that the era was that of Hars.a (A.D. 606). 

24 Yuko YOKOCHI has observed (1999a, pp. 81–82) that the icon of the goddess Mahis.asuramardin ¯ ¯ı seen in texts of the sixth and seventh centuries gives way to a new iconic type around the beginning of the eighth century and that this text be longs with the earlier sources in this regard. The same scholar has shown (1999b, pp. 68–75) that the description of Mahis.asuramardin ¯ ¯ı in 68.10–23 of the text cor responds most closely to the image of Mahis.asuramardin ¯ ¯ı from Siddhi-k¯ı-Gupha at ¯ Deogarh, an example of her Gupta subtype B2. She argues that this was carved in the middle of the sixth century or, at the latest, at its the end (pp. 74–75). So, she concludes, “the possibility that the text belongs to the same century can no longer

striking in this regard that it betrays no knowledge of the Siddhanta, its ¯ Saivism being Atim ´ argic, ¯25 a circumstance which supports the hypothesis that the polarity seen in the Mantramarga between ¯ Saivism and ´ S´ akta ¯ Saivism ´ was already present in some form when the former was still in the Atimarga ¯ stage.26 Royal devotion to Bhairava certainly goes back before the Siddhanta’s ¯ emergence, being attributed in Vak¯ at¯ .aka inscriptions to Rudrasena I, who ruled c. 335–c. 360,27 and a copperplate decree issued by Mahar¯ aja Bhulun ¯ . d. a in 376 from Bagh (Valkha) in Madhya Pradesh records a grant made to support the ¯ worship of the Mothers in a temple of those deities established by an officiant of the Atimarga, the P ¯ a¯supat ´ ac¯ arya Bhagavat Lokodadhi. ¯28 

In the light of this evidence that S´ aktism was extensively incorporated into ¯ and developed within Saivism it should not be surprising to discover that in spite ´ of the prevalence of the worship of the Goddess in early medieval India kings 

identified in inscriptions as devotees of the Goddess (bhagavat¯ıbhaktah.) rather than Siva are very rare. At present I am aware only of N ´ agabhat ¯ .a, Bhoja, and his successor Mah¯ıpala I in the ninth century among the G ¯ urjara-Prat ¯ ¯ıharas of ¯ Kanyakubja.29 

Royal devotion to a goddess, typically as a dynasty’s lineage deity (kuladev¯ı, vam.´sadev¯ı, gotradev¯ı), was very common during our period, and such deities are often declared in inscriptions to be the source of a king’s sovereignty and mar tial might.30 But this was not sufficient to mark out kings who worshipped such goddesses as S´ aktas. For such worship was common regardless of a king’s reli- ¯ 

be repudiated” (p. 75). The Gupta type, in one subtype or another, was popular from the 5th century to the 8th. 

25 The Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a is not a text of the Atimarga in the sense that ¯ it was written for initiates in one of its systems. For since it is a Puran¯ . a its target audience is the uninitiated laity. However, the Saivism that it draws on is P ´ a¯supata ´ rather than Mantramargic. This Atim ¯ argic background is conspicuous throughout ¯ the text; but see particularly Adhyayas 174–183. ¯ 

26 Hypothesis first proposed in SANDERSON 1988, p. 667.

The same for mula appears in all the other surviving copper-plates of this king that are complete at this point (CII 5:1, 4, 6–7, 10, 13–14, 18).

gious affiliation, and it was in any case inconstant, coming to the fore only on cer tain occasions, particularly during the autumnal Navaratra festival that inaugu- ¯ rates the season of military activity, when they and associated goddesses received large-scale animal sacrifices;31 and when this cult was particularly emphasized through the forging of connections with a higher domain of non-periodic, exclu sive devotion, then this domain was that of the esoteric goddesses of the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha.32 

THE ETIOLATION AND SUBSUMPTION OF THE CULT OF THE SUN-GOD 

As for the cult of the Sun, kings who have been declared in inscriptions to be devotees of this god (paramasaurah., param ¯adityabhaktah., and the like) are also few and they are mostly confined to the sixth and seventh cen turies. We have Dharmaraja of Padmakhol ¯ ¯ı in the Ganjam District of Orissa, Dharapat.t.a, the Maitraka of Valabh¯ı, Rajyavardhana, ¯ Adityavardhana, and ¯ Prabhakaravardhana, the three successive predecessors of King Hars ¯ .a of Kanyakubja, in the sixth century, and from c. 570 to c. 665 the Gurjara feuda- ¯ 

31 On Navaratra see S ¯ ANDERSON 2005a, p. 371 (fn. 64); 2005b, pp. 255–257; 2007b, pp. 263–277 and 294 (fn. 196). For an example of the scale of such annual sacrifices see p. 247 below. 

32 In general we may say that the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga holds itself aloof from ¯ the domain of calendrical religion, seeing the recurrent festivals of that domain as commemorations of mythic events and therefore as operating on a level of mun dane belief that initiates must transcend. That is the territory of Puran¯ .ic religion, which guarantees various rewards but not the liberation or supernatural effects and powers promised to observant initiates into the Mantramarga. ¯ Saiva initiates were ´ merely required to track the Puran¯ .ic calendar by intensifying their own regular cult on days when uninitiated devotees were celebrating Siva’s or the Goddess’ activi- ´ ties in the domain of myth-based devotion; see, e.g., Tantr ¯alokaviveka on 28.6d–7b. Nonetheless, we see a distinct tendency for the Mantramarga to seep downwards ¯ into this domain providing Saiva or ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva versions of the Pur ´ an¯ .ic rituals that mark such major annual festivals as Sivar ´ atri and Navar ¯ atra. A ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ procedure for the celebration of Sivar ´ atri was current in Kashmir, as can be seen ¯ from the prescriptions set out in the Nity ¯adisam. graha of Raj¯ anaka Taks ¯ .akavarta (ff. 71v–72v15) from the lost D ¯utid.¯amara and in the 31st chapter of the Haracar itacint ¯aman.i of Raj¯ anaka Jayadratha in the thirteenth century, drawing on this ¯ and the Anantabh ¯askara. The same can be seen in various regions in the case of the Navaratra, also known as the Durgotsava. Among the Newars of the Kathmandu ¯ valley, the goddess is worshipped in this festival in a Tantric form as Ugracan. d. a¯ in Paddhatis that incorporate her among such Mantramargic ¯ S´ akta deities as ¯ Siddhilaks.m¯ı and Kubjika; see the Newari ¯ Navar ¯atrap ¯uj ¯avidhi manuscripts A and B in the bibliography. For her Tantric worship in this context in the tradition of the Paippaladin Atharvavedins of Orissa see S ¯ ANDERSON 2007b, pp. 263–276. In Bengal, where Navaratra was and is much emphasized, we see a Sm ¯ arta procedure ¯ but one that has been strongly Tantricized in the Durg ¯ap ¯uj ¯aprayogatattva section of the Durg ¯ap ¯uj ¯atattva of Raghunandana in the 16th century.

tories of Bharukaccha (Broach). This is explicitly stated in the case of Dadda I (r. c. 570–595), and Dadda II (r. c. 620–645); and it is probable in the case of Jayabhat.a II (r. c. 645–665), since it is very likely that the temple of the Sun-god Jayaditya at Kot ¯ .ipura near Kav¯ ¯ı in the Broach District was founded by him with his name (Jaya-). It is also probable in the case of Jayabhat.a I (r. c. 595–620), since this was the religion not only of his predecessor and successor but also of his brother Ran. agraha. After Jayabhat.a II the next three kings of this dynasty, Dadda III (c. 665–690), Jayabhat.a III (c. 690–715), and Ahirola (c. 715– 720), turned to Saivism, declaring themselves ´ paramam ¯ahe´svarah.. In the ninth century we have royal devotees of the Sun in Ramabhadra, the immediate prede- ¯ cessor of the Gurjara-Prat ¯ ¯ıhara Bhojadeva I of Kanyakubja, and Vin ¯ ayakap ¯ ala, ¯ the latter’s grandson, and, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, in the Sena kings of Bengal Laks.man. asena and Visvar ´ upasena, though the former ¯ also appears in his inscriptions as a Vais.n. ava (paramavais.n. avah.) and, more specifically, as a devotee of Narasim. ha (paraman ¯arasim. hah.).33 

It appears that the Sauras, the initiated devotees of the Sun-god, possessed their own canon of scriptures, known, like those of the Saivas and the Vais ´.n. ava followers of the Pancar ˜ atra, as Sam ¯ . hitas. A list of eighty-five such texts is given ¯ in an account of brahmanical, Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika (Vais ¯ .n. ava), Saura, and Saiva scrip- ´ tural authorities, contained in the Saiva scripture ´ Sr¯ıkan ´.t.h¯ıyasam. hit ¯a.

A lightly edited transcript of the whole excerpt on the scriptural canons has been published as it appears in an apograph contained among the Stein manuscripts of Oxford’s Bodleian Library by Jurgen H ¨ ANNEDER (1998, pp. 237– 268). The verses on the Saura canon are 74–88 in his edition. On the date of the compilation of the Nity ¯adisam. graha see SANDERSON 2007a, p. 422.

Unfortunately, no manuscript of any one of these Saura scriptures has surfaced; and the decline of Saurism as a distinct tradition, of which this is the conse quence and evidence, is probably to be attributed, at least in part, to a failure to continue to attract patronage and so maintain its separate identity as Saivism ´ became more influential and encroached upon its territory. 

Thus a Saurasam. hit ¯a of our period sets out the procedure for the worship of the Sun and no doubt drew on the Saura tradition.35 But it assigns itself to the canon of the Saiva scripture ´ V ¯athula/K ¯alottara,36 a text on which it silently draws, gives a Saiva account of the place of the Sun in the birth of the uni- ´ verse, deriving it through emergence from Siva expressed in a phrase found ´ elsewhere in the Saiva scriptures, ´ 37 and insists that Siva and the Sun are in ´ essence a single deity.38 Moreover, the worship of the Sun taught in this text was included by the Saiddhantika ¯ Saivas as a compulsory preliminary ( ´ a ˙ngam) of the regular worship of Siva himself, appearing first in the sources known ´ to me in the Siddh ¯antas ¯arapaddhati of Mahar¯ aj¯ adhir ¯ aja Bhojadeva of Dh ¯ ar¯ a¯ (r. c. 1018–1060)39 and then soon afterwards, in dependence on that text, in the

S ¯ambapur ¯an. a, which teaches the worship of the Sun-god, is also a product, at least in its later portions, of a Saiva environment. ´ 41 

Traces of some form of the vanished tradition of the Sauras may have sur vived in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva literature. For Kashmirian sources know of a ´ S´ akta ¯ cult whose deity was the Sun under the name V¯ıra or V¯ıresvara accompanied ´ by the goddess Bhargasikh ´ a, citing as its scripture the Kaula ¯ Bharga´sikh ¯a, also called Saurabharga´sikh ¯a, a work for knowledge of whose content we now have only a few comments in the Kashmirian literature and a few verses quoted in the same, one of which has also been quoted by the east-Indian Buddhist Ramap ¯ ala ¯ in his Sekanirde´sapa ˜njik ¯a, a fact that demonstrates that this was not a merely a local, Kashmirian tradition.42 The probability that this cult reflects a non

Saiva tradition otherwise lost to us is made somewhat greater by the fact that ´ the names V¯ıresvara and Bharga ´ sikh ´ a are applied in Kashmirian sources, both ¯ Saiva and Sm ´ arta, to the Sun-god and his consort at M ¯ art ¯ an¯ . d. at¯ırtha (modern Mat.an), where King Lalitaditya built his majestic temple of the Sun in the mid- ¯ eighth century,43 a site that has been a major pilgrimage site with its own special rites for the dead, the Bhargasr´ addha and S ¯ uryabali, down to modern times. ¯44 However, it is possible that the application of these names merely reflects the pervasive influence of S´ akta ¯ Saiva esotericism in the wider Kashmirian commu- ´ nity in later times. 

There are also strong elements of a solar esotericism in the Kal¯ ¯ıkula of the Jayadrathay ¯amala and the Krama.45 It is possible that these too may have been 

na tan nobhayojjhitam | durvij ˜ney ¯a hi s ¯avasth ¯a kim apy etad anuttamam (the verse has been silently incorporated by Abhinavagupta as Tantr ¯aloka 2.28 [with anuttaram not anuttamam]): Jayaratha identifies this as a quotation from the Bharga´sikh ¯a in his commentary: ´sr¯ıbharga´sikh ¯am.sam. v ¯adayati (-viveka, vol. 1, Ahnika ¯ 2, p. 22).

The M ¯art ¯an. d. am ¯ah ¯atmya, the praise-text of this site, refers to Surya here as V ¯ ¯ıresvara ´ (Bhr.˙ng¯ı´sasam. hit ¯a, p. 15: es. a v¯ıre´svaro devah. parah. paramak ¯aran. am; p. 63: v¯ıre´s ¯aya namas tubhyam.; p. 66: namo v¯ır ¯adhiv¯ıre´sa) and makes Bhargasikh ´ a the ¯ first of his Saktis ( ´ibid., p. 12, listing Bhargasikh ´ a, Bh ¯ ¯ıma, Bh ¯ asvat ¯ ¯ı and Bhanav ¯ ¯ı). The Sun is also invoked as V¯ıresvara in the worship of the Grahas that occurs ´ among the preliminaries in Saiva rituals in Kashmir; see ´ Kal ¯ad¯ıks.¯apaddhati B f. 4v9–10: tadbahir grah ¯ah.. tatr ¯adau madhye s ¯uryah.

44 For the Paddhati of these rituals see Karmak ¯an. d. a, vol. 4, pp. 140–205. Here too the Sun is invoked as V¯ıra/V¯ıresvara (p. 196): ´ v¯ıra v¯ıre´sa deve´sa namas te ’stu tridh ¯atmaka | mah ¯am ¯artan. d. a varada sarv ¯abhayavaraprada . . . .

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

constructed on the basis of Saura notions. But it is also possible that they are an independent development internal to Saivism. In the absence of properly Saura ´ literature it is impossible to be sure. 

The cult of the Sun-god, then, appears to have survived in India after the rise of the Saivism only in heavily ´ Saivized Pur ´ an¯ .ic reflexes or subordinated in a Saivized form within the Saiddh ´ antika cult of ¯ Siva, and, perhaps, in some ele- ´ ments within the S´ akta ¯ Saiva tradition. Only in the Majapahit kingdom of East ´ Java do we hear of the survival of adherents of a distinct Saura denomination. There a royal charter of c. 1350 tells us that a board of six learned men appointed to adjudicate law suits included two adherents of this tradition.46

Royal preference for Vais.n. avism, expressed in inscriptions by the epithets atyantabhagavadbhaktah., paramabh ¯agavatah., or paramavais.n. avah., all mean ing ‘entirely devoted to Vis.n. u’, is mostly confined to the period from the fourth century to the seventh. The Bhagavata faith was adopted and promoted by ¯ the Guptas from the first half of the fourth century through to the end of the fifth,47 and it was probably under their influence that it gained a foothold in the fifth century among the Saiva V ´ ak¯ at¯ .aka rulers of Nandivardhana in east ern Vidarbha, through the marriage in the last decade of the fourth century of the Vak¯ at¯ .aka Rudrasena II to Prabhavat ¯ ¯ıgupta, the daughter of the ¯ parama bh ¯agavatah. Gupta emperor Candragupta II (c. 380–474).48 Gupta influence may also explain the appearance of the Bhagavata faith at the end of the fourth cen- ¯

were the later Maukharis.59 

After the seventh century royal Vais.navism is sporadic, with the prominent exception of the Karkot ¯ .as of Kashmir (c. 625–855/6). The conclusion that this dynasty was Vais.n. ava is not derived from our study of inscriptions, because extremely few have survived the centuries of Islamic rule in Kashmir, which began in 1339 and ended in 1819. It rests primarily on the testimony of the R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı of the Kashmirian historian Kalhan. a, who did have access to, and did utilize, the local epigraphic record of religious foundations and dynastic history.60 From this work we can see that when a king of this dynasty established and enshrined a deity, generally with his own name (svan ¯amn ¯a), it was always a Vis.n. u (-svamin, -ke ¯ sava), though sometimes images of the ´ Sun-god or the Buddha were enshrined in addition. These royal Vis.n. us are the Durlabhasvamin (4.6) of Durlabhavardhana (r. ¯ c. 626–662), the Tribhu vanasvamin (4.78) of Candr ¯ ap¯ ¯ıd. a (r. c. 712-720/1), the Muktasvamin (4.188) of ¯ Lalitaditya-Mukt ¯ ap¯ ¯ıd. a (725-761/2), his silver Parihasake ¯ sava at his new town ´ Parihasapura (4.195, 202), his golden Mukt ¯ ake ¯ sava (4.196, 201), and a Vis ´ .n. u at his new town Darpitapura (4.183), the Vipulakesava (4.484) of Jay ´ ap¯ ¯ıd. a (r. c. 773/4-804/5), and his Caturatmake ¯ sava and Ananta ´ sayana Vis ´ .n. u at his new town Jayapura (4.508), the Amr.takesava established after his death by his ´ mother Amr.taprabha to secure the rescue from hell that the sins of his later ¯ life had made his certain destiny (4.659), and the Vis.n. us established by each of the five uncles of Cippat.ajayap¯ ¯ıd. a, who ran the country for thirty-seven years during the reign of the puppet king Ajitap¯ ¯ıd. a (r. c. 813/4–850/1): Utpalasvamin ¯

Another lineage that may have been Vais.n. ava up to the early seventh century before turning to Saivism is that of the Varmans of ´ Pragjyotis ¯ .a. Bhutivarman of that line was ¯ paramabh ¯agavatah. according to his Bad. agang˙ a rock inscription of 553/4 ( ¯ EI 27:5, ll. 1–2): ´sr¯ı paramadaivataparama bh ¯agavatamah ¯ar ¯aj ¯adhir ¯aj ¯a´svamedhaj ¯ajin[ ¯am.] ´sr¯ıbh ¯utivarmadevap ¯ad ¯an ¯am.. But his great-great-grandson, Bhaskaravarman (r. ¯ c. 600–50), has been described in his Dub¯ ¯ı copper-plate inscription as having revived Saivism; see S ´IRCAR 1983a:1, ll. 109–110): laks. m¯ıh. ks.¯ıbavil ¯asa[n¯ıta]vidhin ¯a sam.skr.tya ca sv¯ıkr.t ¯a bh ¯uyo yena ma he´svar ¯a´srayanayah.sph ¯ayiprat ¯ap ¯arcis.¯a.

Kalhan. a reports only one Saiva foundation by a king of this dynasty, and this ´ is a special case. For it was not the creation of a new Siva with the king’s name, ´ 

but merely the building by Lalitaditya of a new stone temple to house the ancient ¯ Siva Jyes ´.t.hesvara at the site of ´ Siva Bh ´ ute ¯ svara (4.190) in the context of offer- ´ ings to clear his debt to the latter incurred when he had appropriated the wealth of this temple to finance his military campaigns (4.189). Devotion to Vis.n. u was also the preference of Avantivarman (r. 855/6–883), the first king of the next dy nasty, and in keeping with his personal faith he installed an Avantisvamin before ¯ his consecration. But thereafter he showed himself a Saiva in unison with the ´ faith of his powerful minister S´ura, establishing a ¯ Siva Avant ´¯ısvara and mak- ´ ing donations to the Sivas of the national ´ Siva-temples, confessing to ´ S´ura his ¯ long-hidden devotion to Vis.n. u only at death’s door (5.43, 123–125).61 

Vais.n. avism gained ground again only towards the end of our period, and in subsequent centuries.62 Before that happened, while it remained in the shadow of Saivism, it gave rise to a new literature of scriptural texts known collectively ´ as the Pancar ˜ atra, that was probably composed in and around Kashmir. A form ¯ of Vais.n. avism bearing this name is already mentioned in the Mah ¯abh ¯arata.63 It is very probable, therefore, that it was in existence well before the Saiva ´ 

Mantramarga. However, there is no evidence that this early Pa ¯ ncar ˜ atra had ¯ a Tantric ritual system of the kind that characterizes the Sam. hitas of the sur- ¯ viving corpus of Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika scripture. It is highly probable in my view that ¯ 

those texts are rather the product of a thorough reformation in which Vais.n. avas followed the example of the already flourishing Saiva Mantram ´ arga in order to ¯ 

provide themselves with a substantially new ritual system that would enable them to compete more effectively with their rivals. 64

62 Vais.n. avas who left their mark in the domains of the major S´ astras, belles-lettres, ¯ and literary theory are few during our centuries. The shift in the fortunes of Vais.n. avism is marked by the emergence of such influential religious leaders as Ram¯ anuja (d. 1137), Madhva (probably 1238–1317), Nimb ¯ arka (thirteenth cen- ¯ tury), Vis.n. usvamin (thirteenth century?), Vallabha, and Caitanya (both late fif- ¯ teenth century).

[[61]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

I am led to this conclusion by the convergence of various considerations. Firstly, the ritual system prescribed in the Pancar ˜ atra scriptures is remarkably ¯ close to that of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga in its repertoire, consisting principally ¯ of Man. d. ala initiation (d¯ıks.¯a), regular worship comprising Nyasa, P ¯ uj ¯ a, Japa ¯ and Homa, the periodic ritual of pavitr ¯aropan. am, special rites of Mantra propitiation (mantr ¯ar ¯adhanam), and image-installation (pratis.t.h ¯a); and this proximity extends into the minute details of the procedures of these rituals and even to the production of Vais.n. ava versions of such eminently Saiva rites as the ´ vet ¯alas ¯adhanam.65 

Secondly, I see no evidence that any of the surviving Pancar ˜ atra texts goes ¯ back as far the Saiva texts that they so closely resemble. Seven can be shown ´ to be relatively old because they have been cited by authors of the tenth cen tury or have come down to us in early Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts. These are the Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra, the Dev ¯amr.trapa ˜ncar ¯atra, the V ¯asudevakalpa of the Mah ¯alaks. m¯ısam. hit ¯a, the Jayottara, the Jay ¯akhya, the S ¯atvata, and the Paus. kara. Now, of these, three, namely the Jayottara, the Jay ¯akhya, and the S ¯atvata, are very unlikely to have been produced before the ninth century, that is to say, at a time when the Saiva Mantram ´ arga had been flourishing under ¯ widespread royal patronage for at least two centuries and had been existence in some form by a time no later than the middle of the sixth and perhaps as early as the middle of the fifth. For all three focus on the worship of a form of Vasudeva, ¯ called Vaikun.t.ha in the Jay ¯akhya and Jayottara and Sakty ´ atman or ¯ Sakt ´¯ısa in ´ the S ¯atvatasam. hit ¯a, in which the principal anthropomorphic face is flanked by the faces of Narasim. ha and Varaha, with a fourth face, that of the sage Kapila, ¯ at the rear.66 Surviving stone and bronze images of this deity are numerous, but they are three-faced, lacking the face of Kapila at the rear, until the ninth century.67 

Thirdly, these early Pancar ˜ atra texts show clear signs of having drawn on ¯ Saiva sources. This is particularly obvious in the ´ Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra, to which we have access in a single, incomplete Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript bearing a date of transcription that falls in A.D. 1026.68 The principal Mantra of

The Dev ¯amr.tapa ˜ncar ¯atra, which is closely related textually to the Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra and is probably dependent on it, survives in a sin gle, undated Nepalese manuscript, probably of the twelfth century.

[[63]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The Saiva prototypes are already found in the Atim ´ arga of the P ¯ a¯nc˜ arthika ¯ Pa¯supatas. Indeed they constitute the whole Mantra-system of that tradition. ´ However, it is clear that the Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra has drawn them from the later tradition of the Mantramarga, because it goes on to teach the imposition on ¯ to the worshipper’s body of the thirty-eight parts of these Mantras (kal ¯any ¯asah.), a Mantramargic feature, and under names specific to one Mantram ¯ argic tradi- ¯ tion, that of the Svacchandatantra, the principal scripture of the Mantrap¯ıt.ha.70 

The Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra survives only in this Nepalese manuscript. One might object, therefore, that it may be no more than a local oddity unrep resentative of the mainstream tradition. That it is not can be argued, of course, only through evidence that the text was more widely known in the form of ref erences to it, citations from it, or accounts of its contents in other works. This is a difficult test to apply in the case of the early Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika literature, since ¯ in stark contrast to the case of the Saiva scriptures, P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrika commentarial ¯ works in which we could seek such evidence are almost completely absent un til a much later period among the Sr´¯ıvais.n. avas of the South, when the range of relevant sources had changed greatly. The only exception is the Spandapra d¯ıpik ¯a of the Kashmirian Bhagavatotpala, probably of the tenth century. ¯71 But that, though it cites a number of early Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika scriptural sources, does not ¯ cite this. However, there is evidence in a Saiva source that this P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrika ¯ text was known and followed outside Nepal. For I propose that it is identi cal with the Svayambh ¯upa ˜ncar ¯atra that Somasambhu cites as his authority in ´ 

his account of the procedures for the installation of an image of Vis.n. u in the Kriy ¯ak ¯an. d. akram ¯aval¯ı,72 the highly influential work on the Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva ´

71 I am aware of no reference to the Spandaprad¯ıpik ¯a or its author in any dated work. It is not possible, therefore, to fix a date before which this work must have been written, at least not a date earlier than that of its manuscripts. However, the fact that it quotes extensively from the S´ akta ¯ Saiva literature current in Kashmir up to ´ and including the ¯I´svarapratyabhij ˜n ¯ak ¯arik ¯a of Utpaladeva (fl. c. 925–975) but not from any of the works of Abhinavagupta (fl. c. 975–1025) makes it unlikely that its author wrote after the latter.

rituals73 that he composed in the eleventh century, probably in 1073,74 while he held the office of abbot in the kingdom of the Kalacuris of Tripur¯ı at the illus trious Saiddhantika monastery of Golag ¯ ¯ı (golag¯ımat.hah.), in the Rewa District of Madhya Pradesh.75 

My conclusion that Somasambhu was referring to our ´ Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜nca r ¯atra does not rest solely on the synonymity of the titles, both meaning ‘The Pancar ˜ atra taught to Brahm ¯ a’, but also on the fact that the brief but detailed ¯ account of the ritual that Somasambhu attributes to the ´ Svayambh ¯upa ˜ncar ¯atra corresponds in its particulars to the coverage of the same topic found in the seventh Adhyaya of the text in our manuscript. I cannot demonstrate this ¯ in full detail here. But it should suffice to point out that the system that Somasambhu attributes to his ´ Svayambh ¯upa ˜ncar ¯atra features an unusual arrangement of three circuits of Mantra-deities that agrees exactly with that of our Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra manuscript: nine on a lotus with eight petals (one at the centre and one on each of the petals), twelve in a circle with that lotus at its centre, and eight forming a circuit enclosing the whole. The twelve are the Vis.n. umurtis, embodying each of the twelve syllables of the root-Mantra ¯ (m ¯ulamantrah.); the outer eight are the eight weapons (astr ¯an.i) held by the presiding deity; and the nine of the innermost circuit (garbh ¯avaran. am) are a set of ancillary Mantras: the Hr.daya at the centre surrounded by the Siras (E), ´ the Sikh ´ a (S), the Kavaca (W), the Astra (N), the G ¯ ayatr ¯ ¯ı (SE), the Savitr ¯ ¯ı (NE), the Netra (SW), and the Pingal ˙ astra (NW). ¯76 Since this arrangement is highly 

73 Of the various Paddhatis on the Saiddhantika rituals that have come down to us ¯ Somasambhu’s was probably the most influential. Its impact can be seen in the ´ major later works of this type, such as the Kriy ¯akramadyotik ¯a of Aghorasiva, the ´ J ˜n ¯anaratn ¯aval¯ı of Jn˜ana ¯ siva, and the ´ Siddh ¯anta´sekhara of Visvan ´ atha, and in the ¯ fact that manuscripts of the text have survived throughout the subcontinent, in Kashmir, Nepal, and the South. There is also the fact that it alone achieved the distinction of being stripped of its human authorship to be passed off as scripture. For it was incorporated almost in its entirety in the Agnipur ¯an. a (SANDERSON in BRUNNER 1998, p. lix, fn. 81); and much of it was taken over in the late south-Indian Saiddhantika scriptures ¯ Cintyavi´svas ¯ad ¯akhya and Uttarak ¯amika (BRUNNER 1998, p. lviii–lix).

unusual, especially in its set of nine ancillaries, it is extremely unlikely that Somasambhu’s ´ Svayambh ¯upa ˜ncar ¯atra is not the Sv ¯ayambhuvapa ˜ncar ¯atra of the Nepalese manuscript. Since Somasambhu was a major figure and writing ´ far from Nepal for a pan-Indian audience there are no grounds for considering this tradition to be a Nepalese aberration. 

Furthermore, while the ritual systems taught in the scriptures of the Pancar ˜ atra are generally coherent, no less so than those of the ¯ Saivas, the texts ´ retain elements that make sense in the Saiva world but not in the Vais ´.n. ava;

and in some cases we find a degree of awkwardness that is consistent only with a clumsy attempt to adapt Saiva materials to their new context. ´ A striking example of this can be seen in the Jay ¯akhya. When detailing the process of initation it describes the p ¯a´sas ¯utram, the cord which is ritually trans formed into a substitute of the subtle body of the candidate, containing all the reality-levels along its length, to be used in the process of rendering the past ac tions that bind his soul incapable of giving rise to future consequences at any of these levels. In the course of this description we find some elements alien to the Vais.n. ava tradition that derive, with minimal distortion, from the Saiva doctrinal ´ context. Thus it speaks of this cord as embodying kal ¯a, avidy ¯a, and r ¯agah., and, shortly afterwards, as coloured by r ¯agah., illuminated by avidy ¯a, circumscribed by k ¯alah., and rendered non-pervasive by niyatih..77 Now the first three of these factors (r ¯agah., avidy ¯a, and kal ¯a) are the Saiva Mantram ´ arga’s three ‘shrouds’ ¯ 

77 The only edition of the Jay ¯akhya (Ed.), that of KRISHNAMACHARYYA, was based on south-Indian manuscripts of relatively recent date. I re-edit the text of the passage to which I am referring, 16.128c–134 [numeration of Ed.], with the help of the testimony of a Nepalese paper manuscript of 1454/5 (N), ff. 35v7–36r4, and a lemma in a Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of 1187/8 of the J ˜n ¯analaks. m¯ı of Sadhaka Candradatta, pupil of Ek ¯ ayan ¯ ac¯ arya N ¯ ar¯ ayan ¯ . agarbha (C): susitam. s ¯utram ¯ad ¯aya l ¯aks.¯alaktakabh ¯avitam k 129 sam. mukham.cotthitam.´sis. yam. *samap ¯ada´sirodharam (corr.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

(ka ˜ncuk ¯ani), except that there the second is generally termed vidy ¯a rather than avidy ¯a; and the other two factors, k ¯alah. and niyatih.join these three to form the group of five reality-levels (tattv ¯ani) ranked immediately below m ¯ay ¯atattvam, the upper limit and source of the ‘impure cosmos’ (a´suddho ’dhv ¯a), and immedi ately above the individual soul (purus. ah.), constituting the factors that enable the soul to undergo embodiment in that impure world.78 Even the substitu tion of avidy ¯a for the Saivas’ ´ vidy ¯a does nothing to dilute the obviously Saiva ´ character of the set, since vidy ¯a in that context is indeed a form of nescience (avidy ¯a), being understood as the limited power of knowledge that characterizes bound souls, enabling them to cognize the objects presented by the faculties, as opposed to the pure, all-encompassing knowledge (´suddhavidy ¯a) that operates above m ¯ay ¯atattvam; and this understanding is maintained in the passage in the Jay ¯akhya, because it speaks of the bonds as being ‘illuminated’ by avidy ¯a. Indeed the line in which the bonds are said to be ‘coloured by r ¯agah. and illuminated by avidy ¯a’ unmistakeably echoes loci classici on the functions of r ¯agah. and vidy ¯a in the Mantramarga’s scriptures. ¯79 

The S ¯atvata and the Paus. kara are probably the latest of these early texts. They are certainly the most polished and the most sophisticated in language. Unsurprisingly, these more mature products of the tradition contain no glar ingly obvious examples that I can see of imperfectly assimilated Saiva material. ´ Nonetheless, there are parallels in which the Saiva version seems more likely ´ to have been the model of the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika than ¯ vice versa. Thus the nine teenth chapter of the Paus. kara teaches as the text’s major initiation Man. d. ala (mah ¯ay ¯agah.) an arrangement of eight lotuses around a central ninth, calling it the navap¯ıt.haman. d. alam, nav ¯abjaman. d. alam, or navan ¯abhaman. d. alam,80 and a 

78 For r ¯agah., vidy ¯a, and kal ¯a as the three ‘shrouds’ (ka ˜ncukatrayam) of the Saivas ´ see, e.g., Mata ˙ngap ¯arame´svara, Vidy ¯ap ¯ada 11.33: r ¯agavidy ¯akal ¯akhyena ka ˜ncu katritayena vai; and Rauravas ¯utrasam. graha 1.3–4: r ¯agavidy ¯akal ¯avyaktagun. a buddhisamudbhavam, where they are the three ‘shrouds’ (ka ˜ncuk ¯ani) of the bound soul. For the addition of k ¯alah. and niyatih.seen in the last verse of the Jay ¯akhya passage (16.134) see, e.g., Mata ˙ngap ¯arame´svara, Vidy ¯ap ¯ada 14.2: ka ˜ncukatritay ¯aviddham. k ¯alena kalitam.´sanaih.| niyaty ¯ali ˙ngitam. y ¯ati pum. bh ¯aven ¯atmavartin ¯a; and Tantr ¯aloka 9.204: m ¯ay ¯a kal ¯a r ¯agavidye k ¯alo niyatir eva ca | ka ˜ncuk ¯ani s. ad. ukt ¯ani.

long invocatory Mantra consisting of eighty-one units distributed one by one on the centre (n ¯abhih.) and eight petals of each of the nine lotuses. This arrange ment and correlation, which, to my knowledge, is found in the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika liter- ¯ ature only in the Paus. kara, is central to the Saiva tradition of the Mantram ´ arga, ¯ being the hallmark of a number of its earlier scriptures, where the Man. d. ala is taught under the same names,81 and the Mantra with which it is correlated is the well-known Saiva Vyomavy ´ apimantra of eighty-one units. In the ¯ Saiva case the ´ nine lotus-thrones (p¯ıt.hah.) of the Man. d. ala are equated with nine Tattvas: Siva, ´ Sada¯siva, ´¯Isvara, Vidy ´ a, M¯ ay¯ a, K ¯ ala, Niyati, Purus ¯ .a, and Avyakta (Prakr.ti). In the Paus. kara that element has been dropped, no Vais.n. ava set of nine Tattvas being available for this purpose and the Saiva set being unassimilable because it ´ includes unmistakeably Saiva elements such as Sad ´ a¯siva and ´¯Isvara. Nonethe- ´ less the text contains a sign that the redactor was after all working with a Saiva ´ exemplar. For he calls his fourth ‘the lotus of May¯ a’. ¯82 May¯ a is a ¯ Saiva not a ´ Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika Tattva. ¯ 

Furthermore, in the Paus. kara, the S ¯atvata, and the V ¯asudevakalpa of the Mah ¯alaks. m¯ısam. hit ¯a we find the term spandah.‘vibrancy’ in the sense it has in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ Jayadrathay ¯amala and the Spand ¯ak ¯arik ¯a of Kallat.a in the second half of the ninth century. However, I do not exclude the possibility that in this case it may be the Saiva sources that are indebted to the Vais ´.n. ava.83

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Nor was the influence of the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga confined to the ¯ formative period of the Tantric Pancar ˜ atra. For, as I have shown elsewhere, the ¯ Laks. m¯ıtantra and Ahirbudhnyasam. hit ¯a, works composed in the South, derive their distinctive doctrinal character from the assimilation of the dynamic non dualism of the works of the Kashmirian S´ akta ¯ Saivas from Utpaladeva (fl. ´ c. A.D. 925–975) to Ks.emaraja (fl. ¯ c. 1000–1050).84 

ROYAL PATRONAGE OF BUDDHISM 

Buddhism enjoyed widespread royal support during this period, notably from the Vis.n. ukun. d.is of Andhra in the fifth and sixth centuries, from the ¯ Maitrakas of Valabh¯ı in Sauras¯ .t.ra in the sixth and seventh, from the Karkot ¯ .as of Kashmir in the eighth, and throughout our period from the Licchavi and ‘T. hakur ¯ ¯ı’ kings of Nepal and various dynasties of eastern India, most notably the Palas (r. ¯ c. 750–1200). 

The Vis.n. ukun. d.is of Andhra ¯ 

Among the eight successive Vis.n. ukun. d.is (r. c. 375–612) known to us from in scriptions three of the last six are known to have been patrons of Buddhism: the third, Govindavarman I (r. c. 422–462), the fifth, Vikramendravarman I (r. c. 502– 527), and the seventh, Vikramendravarman II (r. c. 555–572). In the Tummala gud. em plates (Set I) issued by Mahar¯ aja Govindavarman I he is described as ¯ having beautified his kingdom with many temples and Buddhist monasteries, as having given generously to brahmins and Buddhist monks, as having resolved to attain the Great Awakening for the salvation of all living beings, and as having donated two villages—the charter’s object is to record this grant—to fund the

Of the land-grant documents of the Maitrakas of Valabh¯ı three quarters are records of grants to brahmins, but the remaining quarter report grants made by these kings to Buddhist institutions.88 Guhasena (r. c. 553–569) has the epithet paramop ¯asakah.‘devout lay Buddhist’;89 S´¯ıladitya I Dharm ¯ aditya (r. ¯ c. 595–612) is praised for his support of Buddhism in the east-Indian R ¯ajavy ¯akaran. a of the Buddhist Tantric Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa90 and by the Chinese Huili in his ac count of the Indian travels of Xuanzang;91 and the latter, who visited the king dom of Valabh¯ı in the 630s, when the Maitraka Dhruvasena II was on the throne, reports that the king had recently developed a sincere faith in Buddhism and be come a generous donor to the monastic community.92 Moreover, Valabh¯ı became a major centre of Mahayana Buddhist scholarship during this period, producing ¯ such eminent figures as Sthiramati (fl. c. 510–570), for whom a monastery was es tablished in Valabh¯ı during the reign of Guhasena.93 In their inscriptions, how

The K ¯arkot.as of Kashmir 

No inscriptions have survived from the reigns of the kings of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty of Kashmir. But from the account of this dynasty given by the Kashmi ran historian Kalhan. a we learn that although, as we have seen, the temples they established with their names were Vis.n. us,95 they or those closely associated with them also established several Buddhist foundations: the Anantabhavanavihara ¯ founded by the queen of Durlabhavardhana (r. c. 626–662); the Praka¯sik´ avih ¯ ara ¯ founded by Praka¯sadev ´ ¯ı, queen of Candrap¯ ¯ıd. a (r. c. 712–720/1); the Rajavih ¯ ara ¯ ‘The King’s Monastery’ founded and richly endowed by Lalitaditya (r. ¯ c. 725– 761/2) with a large Caitya and a huge Buddha image at his new capital Parihasapura; the Kayyavih ¯ ara, founded during the rule of the same by Kayya, ¯ a king of Lat¯ .a; a Vihara, a St ¯ upa, and golden Buddha images established at ¯ Parihasapura by Lalit ¯ aditya’s Central Asian chief minister Ca ¯ nkun ˙ . a; a Vihara ¯ and a Caitya established by the same in the capital; and a large monastery and three Buddha images established by Jayap¯ ¯ıd. a (r. c. 773/4–804/5) in his new capital Jayapura.96 

94 See, e.g., the Al¯ın. a copper-plate inscription of ¯ S´¯ıladitya VII of ¯ A.D. 766/7, CII:39. There all the kings listed are said to be paramam ¯ahe´svarah.: the general Bhat.arka, ¯ the founder of the dynasty, followed, after an unspecified number of generations, by Guhasena, Dharasena (II), S´¯ıladitya (I), Kharagraha (I), Dharasena (III), Dhru- ¯ vasena (II), Dharasena (IV), Dhruvasena (III), Kharagraha (II), S´¯ıladitya (II), ¯ S´¯ıladitya (III), ¯ S´¯ıladitya (IV), ¯ S´¯ıladitya (V), and ¯ S´¯ıladitya (VI). In the M ¯ aliy ¯ a¯ copper-plate inscription of Dharasena II, A.D. 571/2, we are given the names of the Maitrakas who ruled between the founder Bhat.arka and Dharasena II. They ¯ are Dharasena I, Dron. asim. ha, Dhruvasena I, and Dharapat.t.a. Of these the first two have the epithet paramam ¯ahe´svarah.; Dhruvasena is here a Vais.n. ava (param abh ¯agavatah.) rather than a Buddhist (paramop ¯asakah.); and Dharapat.t.a is a devo tee of the Sun-God (param ¯adityabhaktah.. It seems that in the later years of the Maitraka dynasty, when Saivism had become firmly established as the religion ´ of this dynasty, there was a desire to forget those early rulers, Dhruvasena and Dharapat.t.a, whose religious preference had deviated. This practice of beginning the account of lineage with Bhat.arka and then jumping to Guhasena and his suc- ¯ cessors, so that all the kings have the epithet paramam ¯ahe´svarah., is already seen in the Dana plates of Dhruvasena II issued in 634/5 (EI 42:15).

The Licchavis of Nepal 

In the Kathmandu valley the inscriptions of kings throughout our period show their devotion to Siva. But here too, where Buddhism and ´ Saivism ´ co-existed among the Newars down to the present, there is ample evidence of royal support for the former. The Licchavi Vr.s.adeva is described in an inscription of his eighth-century descendant Jayadeva as having inclined to wards Buddhism;97 a view confirmed by a local chronicle, which attributes to him the establishing of Buddhist images;98 and in the first half of the seventh century Xuanzang claims that the king of Nepal was a sincere believer.99 The Gop ¯alar ¯ajavam.´s ¯aval¯ı, the earliest of the local chronicles, compiled during the reign of Jayasthitimalla (1382–1395), 100 claims that the Caitya at Gum. vihara ¯ and a monastery, the Manavih ¯ ara, were established by M ¯ anadeva, the Caitya ¯ of the S¯ınagu-vihara (the Svayambh ¯ un¯ ath Caitya) by Vr ¯ .s.adeva,101 the Dhar madevacaitya (the Cabah ¯ ¯ıl Caitya) by Dharmadeva, a monastery and the Khasaucaitya (the Bodhnath Caitya) ¯102 by Sivadeva, the Phut ´.ovihara and a ¯ Caitya by Campadeva, the R ¯ ajavih ¯ ara by Am ¯ . suvarman, the Devalavih ´ ara by ¯ Devaladeva, and a monastery at Nandis´al¯ a by ¯ Sivadeva. To Narendradeva and ´ 

his Buddhist preceptor Bandhudatta it attributes the instituting of the annual chariot festival (y ¯atr ¯a) of the popular Newar Buddhist deity Bugmalokesvara ´

100 The Gop ¯alar ¯ajavam.´s ¯aval¯ı, preserved in a single, palm-leaf manuscript that has lost the first sixteen of its folios, consists of three originally separate parts. The first (ff. 17r–30v) covers the period down to 1386. Its coverage of the period before the reign of Anantamalla (1274–1307) (ff. 17r–26r) consists of little more than a list of kings, the lengths of their reigns, in some cases a record of their religious foundations and a few contemporary events such as plagues and famines and rituals undertaken to avert them. From f. 26v to f. 29r it is a little more forthcoming. The last event it records is dated in 1379. Up to this point the text is in a low register of Sanskrit. The remainder of the first part, f. 29v–30v, is written in Old Newari in a more annalistic style and extends the account down to 1386. The second text (ff. 30v–36r), in Old Newari mixed with Sanskrit, covers the years 1056/7 to 1275/6. It consists for the most part of chronological genealogy, giving dates of birth, length of reign, and age at death. The third (ff. 36v–63v + another f. 50), in Old Newari, is an annalistic chronicle whose main concern is to record religious foundations, with entries extending from 1258/9 to 1388/9. See PETECH 1984, p. 6. 

101 The manuscript gives the name Visvadeva here, but as the editors propose, this ´ is surely an error for Vr.s.adeva (f. 20r2–3): r ¯aj ¯a ´sr¯ıvi´svadeva vars. a 100 tena kr.ta s¯ınaguvih ¯ara caityabhat.t.¯arike pratis.t.hita sam. p ¯urn. a kr.tam. The identification of this with the famous Svayambhun¯ ath Caitya is evident from the name S ¯ ¯ınagu, which corresponds to Syangu, its modern Newari name. ˙ 

102 This identification follows from the fact that the Bodhnath Stupa is known as Khasa ¯ Caitya in Newari. On these early Nepalese Caityas—this term rather than Stupa ¯ is the normal uage in Nepal—see GUTSCHOW 1997, pp. 85–99.

Manadeva’s dated inscriptions range in date from 459 to 505/6, ¯105 and we know from his Ca¯ngun ˙ ar¯ ayan ¯ . a inscription that Vr.s.adeva was his great grandfather and Dharmadeva his father.106 The claim that he founded a monastery with his own name, the Manavih ¯ ara, is confirmed by its mention ¯ in an undated inscription assigned to his reign.107 The epigraphical dates of Sivadeva range from 590/1 to 604/5. ´ 108 There is another Licchavi with the same name, with inscriptions ranging from 694 to 705,109 but it is unlikely that it is the second that is intended, since grants of villages to the Sivadevavih ´ ara ¯ have been mentioned in two inscriptions dated in 679, during the reign of his predecessor.110 The inscriptions of Am. suvarman range from 593 to 615; ´111 and

An earlier inscription, dated in Vais´akha 381 (= ¯ A.D. 459), which came to light during renovation work at the Pasupati temple, has been published ´ (D. HAKAL¯ 1990). The earliest Licchavi dates are in the Saka era, which was used ´ until the time of Am. suvarman, the last recorded ´ Saka date being 526 ( ´ A.D. 604/5) in LKA 69 and 70.

the Rajavih ¯ ara arributed to him by the chronicle is mentioned in one of these, ¯ dated in 608. It also mentions the Manavih ¯ ara and the Gum ¯ . vihara, showing ¯ the accuracy of the report of the chronicle that these three monasteries are ancient Licchavi foundations. Moreover, it does so in a context that enables us to gauge their relative importance. For it fixes cash allowances from the court (r ¯ajakulam) to a large number of religious foundations and these are ranked into two groups. The upper comprises the temple of Bhagavat Pasupati, the national ´ Siva, to whom all Nepalese kings from the time of Am ´. suvarman onwards have ´ declared their allegiance,112 Dola¯sikharasv ´ amin (C ¯ a¯ngun ˙ ar¯ ayan ¯ . a), the principal Vis.n. u of Nepal, then these three Buddhist monasteries, and two others not mentioned by the chronicle, the Kharjurik ¯ avih ¯ ara and the Madhyamavih ¯ ara. All ¯ of these are to receive the same allowance; and this is twice that to be received by the institutions listed in the lower group. That comprises “the ordinary monasteries” and the temples of various other deities, most of whom are Sivas, ´ including Mane ¯ svara, evidently the temple of a Li ´ nga installed by M ˙ anadeva ¯ with his name.113 Narendra, whom the chronicle reports to have instituted the annual chariot festival of Bugmalokesvara, has dated inscriptions from 643 to ´ 679.114 The last two, issued in 679 and mentioned above for their reference to the Sivadevavih ´ ara, record the granting of villages to that monastery; and ¯ the Chinese envoy Wang Xuan-ce reported that when he had an audience with

Narendradeva in 643 the king’s belt was adorned with a Buddha.115 But here too we see that the support of Buddhism in Nepal as elsewhere was not a sign that a king had changed his religious allegiance in any radical sense. For in both of those inscriptions Narendradeva has the epithet paramam ¯ahe´svarah..116 

The T. h ¯akur¯ı Kings of Nepal 

Between the Licchavis, who last appear in the epigraphical record in 737, and the Malla kings, who ruled from 1200–1768, lies the relatively obscure period of the so-called T. hakur ¯ ¯ı kings. These too, though predominantly Saiva, ´ supported Buddhist institutions. Only one, Sim. hadeva (r. 1110–1126), has been declared paramasaugatah.;117 but several of the monasteries of the Kathmandu valley are attributed to kings of this period in inscriptions, palm-leaf deeds, manuscript colophons, or their own tradition: the Padmacakramahavih ¯ ara to ¯ Gun. akamadeva I, ¯118 the Jyotirmahavih ¯ ara (Jyo B ¯ ah¯ ah¯ .) and Dattamahavih ¯ ara ¯ 

115 The report of this encounter has been incorporated in chapter 221 of the Jiu Tang shu (Old History of the Tang Dynasty), covering the years 618–906 and compiled in 940–945. In a translation of this passage published by Sylvain LEVI ´ (1894, p. 67) we read “Leur roi Na-ling ti-po (Narendra Deva) . . . a . . . des breloques a sa ceinture, ` ornees d’un ´ Fou-tou (Buddha?)”. In a footnote he explains the question mark, say ing that the use of fou-tou for ‘Buddha’ in the seventh century is problematic. But when he re-published his translation (1905a, vol. 1, p. 164) he removed the question mark.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In this [city] was born Anandadeva, a jewel in the pearl-necklace of the lineage ¯ of Raghu, delighting the people like a gentle moon with its most charming rays. Being self-controlled and of indescribable greatness, though he had achieved the status of prince (kum ¯ara-) of great power (/though he had achieved the status [only] of Kumara who brandishes the javelin), he achieved when initiated by ¯ [Rudrasiva] the ultimate attainment of ´ Siva[hood]. Likewise Arjunadeva, Ar- ´ juna’s equal in martial valour and a lover of virtues, conceived as great a de votion to this [Rudrasiva] as to the gods, when he had seen his virtues. As for the ´ learned Vasantadeva, the wise Somesvara, and Ya ´ somalla, those princes too were ´ initiated by the same [Guru]. 

Neither Arjunadeva nor Yasomalla are otherwise known from this ill- ´ documented phase of Nepalese history. But we do have records of both a Vasantadeva, who was born in 1112 and died in 1163 but did not rule, and of a Somesvaradeva, who was born in 1119, died in 1182, and ruled from 1178 to ´ 1183/5.125 

The Bhauma-Karas of Orissa 

But it was in the region of the modern territories of Bihar, West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Orissa that Buddhism enjoyed its most spectacular success in these centuries. It is only there that we find dynasties whose commitment to Buddhism was such that it was commonly signalled in their inscriptions through the use of such epithets as paramasaugatah. and paramat ¯ath ¯agatah.‘entirely devoted to the Buddha’. Notable among these are the early Bhauma-Karas of Orissa (r. c. 825–950),126 the early Candras of southeast Bengal (r. c. 850–1050), and, above all, the Pala emperors of Gaud ¯ . a (r. c. 750–1199), who at the height of their power extended their authority throughout eastern India and beyond.127 

the Yuvaraja at the time of his initiation. ¯ 

125 See PETECH 1984, pp. 64–67 and 71–72, and the Genealogical Table A, p. 229. 126 The name Bhauma-Kara is Indological. The early inscriptions speak of these rulers as Bhaumas and the later as Karas, evidently after the -kara that ends most of their names. 

127 The Palas and their successors, the Senas, are regularly described as kings of Gaud ¯ . a (gaud.e´svarah., gaud.endrah., gaud. ar ¯ajah., gaud.¯adhipah., gaud. apatih., etc.); see, e.g., SIRCAR 1983a:26, l. 33 (Laks.man. asena); here pp. 108 (Nayapala) and 109 (Palap ¯ ala, ¯ Mah¯ıpala); ¯ Saduktikarn.¯amr.ta 1449, 1496. The name Gaud. a in its narrow sense refers to a territory covering parts of West Bengal, being distinguished from Mag adha, Vanga, and A ˙ nga. But with expansion of the power of its rulers it came to ˙ denote a much larger territory. Thus Campa in modern Bihar, the capital of ancient ¯ Anga, is described as the capital of Gaud ˙ . a in the Anarghar ¯aghava (Act 7, prose be fore v. 124: camp ¯a n ¯ama gaud.¯an ¯am.. . . r ¯ajadh ¯an¯ı), and Kaus´amb ¯ ¯ı, about 35 miles south-west of Allahabad, is said to be in it in the Hitopade´sa (Mitral ¯abha, Kath ¯a 5, p. 19: asti gaud. avis. aye kau´s ¯amb¯ı n ¯ama nagar¯ı). 

[[80]]

Of the early Bhauma-Kara kings of Orissa Ks.emankara, who probably ˙ reigned around the beginning of the ninth century, is described in inscriptions as a paramop ¯asakah.‘a dedicated lay Buddhist’, his son and successor Sivakara I as ´ paramat ¯ath ¯agatah., his son and successor Subh ´ akara I, as ¯ paramasaugatah. and paramop ¯asakah., his son and successor Sivakara II as ´´sr¯ısugat ¯a´srayah.‘having the venerable Buddha as his refuge’, and his son Subh ´ akaradeva II, who reigned ¯ after his father’s brother S´ antikara I ¯ alias Gayad¯ . a, as paramasaugatah..128 A copper-plate of Tribhuvanamahadev ¯ ¯ı, the Vais.n. ava (paramavais.n. av¯ı) wife of S´ antikara I, who occupied the throne as queen after the reign of her son ¯ Subh ´ akara III ¯ alias Kusumahara, records that ¯ Subh ´ akara (I), her husband’s ¯ father, built a lofty Buddhist monastery;129 another issued by her records that the earlier kings of her line had adorned the land with many Mat.has, Buddhist monasteries, and temples;130 and a third issued c. 980 by the para mam ¯ahe´svarah. Sivakara III ´ alias Lalitahara, the son of her grandson ¯ Sivakara ´ II, records the granting of a village in favour of a temple of the Buddha in Uttaratosal¯ı made through him by his vassal Ran¯ . aka Vin¯ıtatunga. ˙131

The religious affiliation of ¯ S´ antikara I and of five ¯ of the subsequent twelve rulers of this dynasty is not recorded. Among the remain der are two Saiva kings, ´ Subh ´ akara IV and his brother and successor ¯ Sivakara ´ III, two Vais.n. ava queens (paramavais.n. av¯ı), namely Tribhuvanamahadev ¯ ¯ı I, wife of S´ antikara I, and Tribhuvanamah ¯ adev ¯ ¯ı II, wife of Subh ´ akara IV, and three ¯ Saiva ´ queens (paramam ¯ahe´svar¯ı), Dan. d.imahadev ¯ ¯ı, daughter of of Gaur¯ımahadev ¯ ¯ı, wife and successor of Subh ´ akara V, Vakulamah ¯ adev ¯ ¯ı, another wife of Subh ´ akara V, and ¯ Dharmamahadev ¯ ¯ı, her successor and the wife of S´ antikara III. For the approximate ¯ dating of these rulers I follow D.C. SIRCAR’s position (1953; EI 29:26, pp. 183–184 and 189–191 [note 2]; SALOMON 1998, pp. 190–191) that the Bhauma-Kara era be gan c. 831. The Neulpur grant of Subh ´ akara I was issued in year 8 of this era ( ¯ EI 15:1, l. 30), i.e. c. 838, and the Terun. d.ia plate of ¯ Subh ´ akara II in year 100 ( ¯ EI 28:36, l. 22), i.e. c. 931. The last recorded date is 204 in the reign of Vakulamahadev ¯ ¯ı, i.e. c. 1035.

tronage of these kings that enabled Mahay¯ ana Buddhism to grow and prosper as ¯ it did in Orissa, with the Tantric forms of that religion coming to the fore from the eighth century.132 This efflorescence is attested by both archaeology and tex tual evidence. Excavations of the Ratnagirimahavih ¯ ara in the Cuttack district, ¯ not far from Guhesvarap ´ at¯ .aka, the Bhauma-Kara capital at or near the modern Jajpur, have revealed that this foundation underwent phenomenal expansion up ¯ to the twelfth century,133 and this is only the foremost of several Buddhist sites in Orissa in which Tantric Buddhism is evident in the surviving statuary.134 The extremely high quality of Ratnagiri’s stone-work renders it improbable that it was not a royal foundation. We have at least one Tantric text that reports that it was written here: the Sam. varoday ¯a n ¯ama Man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Bhuv¯ ac¯ arya, which ¯ survives in a Nepalese manuscript copied in 1050 in the Manadevamah ¯ avih ¯ ara ¯ (Chuka Bah¯ ah¯ .);135 and a manuscript of the Vimalaprabh ¯a, the great commen tary on the K ¯alacakratantra, penned in the early decades of the twelfth century, in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Harivarman, has a postscript in another hand added seven years later which locates the manuscript not far from Ratna giri near the Benga river.136 Indeed Ratnagiri had a particularly close associa tion with the propagation of that Tantra according to the Tibetan account of the 

132 MITRA 1981, pp. 20–21. Xuanzang reports in the early seventh century that Bud dhism was the principal faith of the region, with some 100 monasteries and 10,000 monks, all following the Mahay¯ ana; ¯ Xiyu ji, p. 204.

history of the transmission of its teachings maintained in the lineage that de scends from Rva chos rab in the early twelfth century. For that relates that the Vimalaprabh ¯a was transmitted by an emanation of Manju ˜ sr´ ¯ı to Pan. d.ita Cilu, a native of Orissa trained at the Ratnagiri monastery, and reached Rva chos rab after being passed on through five intermediaries in Bengal and Bihar.137 A tra dition that Cilu studied the K ¯alacakratantra in the Ratnagirimahavih ¯ ara before ¯ seeking the Vimalaprabh ¯a is recorded by Gzhon nu dpal.138 

The Candras of South-East Bengal 

As for the Candras, they used the wheel of the Buddha’s teaching (dharma cakram) as the seal-symbol on their charters; the Pascimbh ´ ag copper-plate grant ¯ of Sr´¯ıcandra I (r. c. 925–75) describes both this king and his predecessor Trailoky acandra as paramasaugatah.;139 and his Ramp ¯ al and Madanpur copper-plate ¯ grants describe Suvarn. acandra, the predecessor of Trailokyacandra (r. c. 900– 925), as a bauddhah.‘a follower of the Buddha’s teachings’.140 After Trailokya candra came Sr´¯ıcandra (II), Kalyan¯ . acandra, Lad. ahacandra, and Govindacandra. The Mainamat ¯ ¯ı plates of Lad. ahacandra and Govindacandra (r. c. 1000–1020 and c. 1020–1045) provide these names and reveal that the last two were parama saugatah..141

141 EI 38:35, no. 1, ll. 35–36; no. 2, ll. 6–7; no. 3, ll. 33–34. As for Purn ¯ . acandra (r. c. 850– 875), there is no explicit evidence of his religious persuasion. MAJUMDAR (1971, p. 201) argues that since it is said in the Ramp ¯ al copper-plate that Suvarn ¯ . acandra, his son, “became a follower of the Buddha” (EI 12:18, ll. 5–7) it is probable that before him the family was non-Buddhist. This is not accurate, since the text says not that he became a Buddhist but only that he was one: buddhasya yah.´sa´saka j ¯atakam a ˙nkasam.stham. bhakty ¯a bibharti k bhagav ¯an amr.t ¯akar ¯am.´suh.| candrasya tasya kulaj ¯ata it¯ıva bauddha[h.] putrah.´sruto jagati tasya suvarn. acandrah.‘His son was Suvarn. acandra, famed in the world, a Buddhist as though [simply] because he was born in the lineage of the Moon (/the Candra lineage), which out of devotion to the Buddha displays his incarnation as a hare in its markings’. The allusion here is to the story exemplifying the Buddhist Perfection of Generosity (d ¯anap ¯aramit ¯a) that the Buddha gave away his own body as food when he was a hare in a former life, the ´sa´saj ¯atakam. The immediately preceding verse, which is devoted to Purn ¯ . a candra, says nothing substantive about him but only that his name is found as that of the first of the kings of this dynasty in Prasastis and other inscriptions. ´

the early years of the eighth century. Though the inscriptions do not include the epithet paramasaugatah.they do speak of these rulers in equivalent terms. The first, Khad. godyama, is described in an inscription of his great-grandson Rajar ¯ aja ¯ as having conquered the earth after declaring his intense devotion to the Three Jewels: the Buddha, his teachings, and the Sangha. ˙142 The same inscription tells us that Rajar ¯ aja gave land to these three; ¯143 and another that Devakhad. ga, the father of Rajar ¯ aja, made a donation to the same for the longevity of his son. ¯144 We have no evidence of any support given to Saivism by these kings themselves. ´ But a pedestal inscription on an image of the Saiva Goddess records that it was ´ gilded out of devotion by Prabhavat ¯ ¯ı, Devakhad. ga’s queen.145 

The Candras of Arakan and Miscellaneous Other Buddhist Kings of Eastern In dia 

That there were Buddhists among the Candras of Arakan is evident from the Mrohaung pillar inscription of Anandacandra, which has been dated around the ¯ end of the third decade of the eighth century.146 This gives a list of the names and reign-durations of the kings who preceded him from c. 380 onwards with an interruption of unspecified length.

sequence a total of three hundred and fifty years. For most of his ancestors we are given no information other than their names and the lengths of their reigns, but the record is more forthcoming as it approaches the time of Anandacandra ¯ himself. Vajrasakti (r. ´ c. 649–665) is said to have died and gone to the world of the gods endowed with [the Buddhist perfections (p ¯aramit ¯ah.) of] generosity, morality and the rest, and his successor Dharmavijaya (665–701) is said to gone to the same, this time defined as the Buddhist Tus.ita heaven, as a result of his firm commitment to the Three Jewels.147 Two short inscriptions from Vesal¯ ¯ı of the time of his ancestors N¯ıticandra (r. c. 520–575) and V¯ıracandra (r. c. 575– 578) tell us that the wife of the former, queen Savit ¯ am¯ .-Candrasr´ ¯ı, was a lay Buddhist (paramop ¯asik ¯a) and that the latter established a hundred Stupas. ¯148 As for Anandacandra, he calls himself a lay Buddhist and devotes nine verses to ¯ detailing his works of Buddhist piety, which included building many monasteries with his own name, establishing precious images of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and such [Mahay¯ anist] goddesses as Cund ¯ a, having hundreds of Buddhist scriptures ¯ copied, and giving to many monks from various lands, which is to say, that he fulfilled to the best of his ability his duty to honour each of the Three Jewels.149 

Yet even this devoted patron of his faith did not neglect to extend his support to the followers of other religions in his realm. He tells us that although he is a Buddhist he desires the good of all beings, lest his cultivation of the Buddhist Per fection of Generosity (d ¯anap ¯aramit ¯a) be incomplete, and so has established four 

Mat.has for the housing of fifty brahmins, providing them with land and workers, and two others, the Anande ¯ svaramat ´ .ha and the Anandam ¯ adhavamat ¯ .ha, whose names reveal that they were associated with a Siva and a Vis ´.n. u established with his name.150 Moreover, a fragmentary copper-plate inscription (EI 37:13) from a

site near Mrohaung recording a donation by queen Kimmajuvdev ¯ ¯ı of a village to a Buddhist monastery founded by herself begins by relating six generations of the ascendants of her husband the king. Unfortunately the names of this king and his ancestors have been lost through the scissoring off of strips from the top and right hand side of the plate. However, what remains conveys the unexpected information that all these kings were paramam ¯ahe´svarah.. The editor of the in scription assigns it to the sixth century on the grounds of its close palaeographic similarity to the grants of N¯ıticandra and V¯ıracandra, and argues that if the first of the six kings was, as is likely, Dvencandra, the founder of the Candra dynasty, ˙ then the king in question was N¯ıticandra’s father Bhuticandra (r. ¯ c. 496–520).151 V¯ıracandra, he argues, is excluded by the fact that one of the two Vesal¯ ¯ı inscrip tions records his patronage of Buddhism. However, that a king should give to Buddhism and at the same time be declared a paramam ¯ahe´svarah.in documents issued by the royal chancellery is quite within the bounds of possibility, as we have seen. 

Other royals of eastern India who are identified as paramasaugatah.in our period—apart from the imperial Palas, to whom I shall turn presently—are ¯ Bhavadeva of Devaparvata in Samatat.a (r. c. 765–780), the founder of the Buddhist monastery Bhavadevamahavih ¯ ara at Pat ¯ .t.ikera, modern Mainamat ¯ ¯ı, Rajyap ¯ ala of the K ¯ amboja dynasty of Priya ¯ ngupura in the tenth, Madhusena, ˙ the Sena king of Gaud. a, in the thirteenth, and, in Orissa, Udayavaraha of ¯ the Mayuravam ¯ . sa at some time in the tenth to twelfth, the Nandodbhava ´ Dhruvananda of Jayapura, the successor of the ¯ paramam ¯ahe´svarah. Devananda ¯ II, in the late tenth, and Kantideva of Harikela in the ninth. ¯152 The inscription that tells us that the last was paramasaugatah. also conveys that Buddhism was the faith of his grandfather Bhadradatta. After a benedictory verse in praise of the Buddha it begins the eulogy of the donor’s forebears with this king, saying that his devotion to the Buddha had intensified his power and that he had [thereby] conquered all his enemies. His son Dhanadatta, the donor’s father, is

The P ¯ala Emperors and the Great Monasteries of Eastern India 

With the Pala emperors we come to what appears to be the most robustly ¯ Buddhist of all the dynasties of our period. Like the Candras of southeast Bengal they chose the wheel of the Buddha’s teaching (dharmacakram) as the seal symbol on their charters; they began their inscriptions with obseisance to the Buddha; and the following among them appear with the epithet paramasaugatah. in the lacunose record of inscriptions and manuscript colophons: Dharmapala ¯ (r. c. 775–812), Devapala (r. ¯ c. 812–850), Mahendrapala (850–865+), N ¯ ar¯ ayan ¯ . a pala (r. ¯ c. 865+–917), Vigrahapala II (r. ¯ c. 972–977), Mah¯ıpala I (r. ¯ c. 977–1027), Nayapala (r. ¯ c. 1027–1043), Vigrahapala III (r. ¯ c. 1043–1070), Ramap ¯ ala (r. ¯ c. 1072–1126), and Madanapala (r. ¯ c. 1143–1161).154

of Mahay¯ ana Buddhism in all its branches, particularly in the Tantric Way of ¯ Mantras (Mantranaya),155 which if not entirely the product of this region was very largely so; and this immense creativity, whose products formed in due course the basis of the Buddhism of Inner Asia, was nurtured and refined in a num ber of major monasteries, of which the most eminent were those of Naland ¯ a, ¯ Vikramas´¯ıla, Somapura, Trikat.uka, Uddan. d. apura, and Jagaddala.156 That the 

155 The Derge edition of the Tripit.aka contains 486 works (Toh. 360–845) in the ¯ section of the Kanjur devoted to scriptural Tantric works and 2606 (Toh. 1180– ¯ 3785) in the section of the Tenjur devoted to works of Tantric scholarship, com prising commentaries on the Buddhist Tantras and works setting out observances (Sadhana, Bali, Pratis ¯ .t.ha etc.) based on them. All claim to be translations of ¯ Sanskrit originals and this claim is true in the great majority of cases. In ad dition there are numerous works surviving whole or in citation in Sanskrit that appear not to have been translated into Tibetan; and some of these, such as the G ¯ud. hapad ¯a of Advayavajra, the Man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Padmasr´ ¯ımitra, the Va jrajv ¯aloday ¯a of Anandagarbha, the ¯ Vajrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ıkalpa, the Sarvadevasam ¯agama, and the Herukas ¯adhana of Kalyan¯ . agarbha, have been used in this study. 

156 The Naland ¯ amah ¯ avih ¯ ara was located in Bihar about 55 miles southeast of Patna, ¯ with the Uddan. d. apuramahavih ¯ ara close by. The Vikrama ¯ s´¯ılamahavih ¯ ara was very ¯ probably at Antichak in the Bhagalpur District of Bihar about 19 miles from ¯ Bhagalpur town. No evidence conclusively etablishes this. But the huge size of the ¯ monastery excavated at Antichak severely narrows the field of known possibilities; and there is suggestive archaeological evidence: a copper seal was uncovered in the ruins of the monastery with the legend vikramasya (IAR, 1973–4, p. 9) and a dam aged inscription on a Stupa there contains the syllables ¯ vikrama. . . (HUNTINGTON 1984, pp. 125–126). The use of Vikrama for Vikramas´¯ıla is seen in Anupamavajra’s Adikarmaprad¯ıpa ¯; see here p. 91. That the name of the monastery was Vikrama s´¯ıla rather than Vikramasil ´ a, as it appears in some secondary sources, is clear from, ¯ e.g., the scribal colophon of a manuscript of Vajragarbha’s Hevajratantrapin. d.¯artha t.¯ık ¯a that was penned there: ´sr¯ımadvikrama´s¯ılamah ¯avih ¯are lekh ¯apitam.. The Soma puramahavih ¯ ara was at P ¯ ah¯ ar¯ .pur about 29 miles northwest of Mahasth ¯ an (ancient ¯ Pun. d.ravardhana) in Varendr¯ı, the region of northern Bengal between the arms of the Ganges and Karatoya rivers ( ¯ R ¯amacarita 3.10ab: apy abhito ga ˙ng ¯akaratoy ¯a narghaprav ¯ahapun. yatam ¯am. The Jagaddalamahavih ¯ ara too was in this region; ¯ see R ¯amacarita 3.7: . . . jagaddalamah ¯avih ¯aracitar ¯ag ¯am | dadhat¯ım loke´sam api mahatt ¯arod¯ıritorumahim ¯anam ‘[the land (of Varendr¯ı)], whose beauty was height ened by the Jagaddalamahavih ¯ ara, which was home to Loke ¯ svara, its extensive ´ glory proclaimed by [a] great [image of] Tar¯ a’. Its site has beeen tentatively iden- ¯ tified as the mound at modern Jagdal in the Dhamoirhat Upazila of the Naogaon District of the Rajshahi Division of Bangladesh. A one-season, small-scale exca vation of this mound was undertaken by Bangladesh’s Department of Archaeology in the winter of 1996. Though it revealed evidence of the presence of a Buddhist monastery and unearthed a fine statue of Heruka and his consort, most of the site was left untouched and nothing has been reported that raises to certainty the high probability that this was the Jagaddalamahavih ¯ ara. See Z ¯ AKARIA 1994 and MIAH 1997/8. The location of the Trikat.ukavihara is as yet unknown, but T ¯ aran ¯ atha re- ¯ lates a myth that on instructions from Mahak¯ ala king Devap ¯ ala unearthed this ¯ monastery beneath a sand dune when he was crossing Rar¯ a (=R ¯ ad¯ .ha) ( ¯ HBI, p. 267; MAJUMDAR 1971, p. 525), the region of Bengal south of Varendr¯ı and west of the Bhag¯ırath¯ı river, divided into Uttararad¯ .ha, covering part of Birbhum District and ¯

Palas’ devotion to the Buddha was expressed, as we might expect, in the creation ¯ and support of these great monastic universities is shown by terracotta seals found amid their remains, and by the Rgya gar chos ’byung (‘The Arising of the Dharma in India’), a Tibetan account of the history of Indian Buddhism written in 1608. 

Taran ¯ atha, the author of this work, tells us that he wrote it on the basis ¯ of three Sanskrit sources that are now lost or inaccessible. The first is an un named work in 2,000 verses by a scholar of Magadha named Sa dbang bzang po, that is to say, Ks.mendrabhadra or a synonym such as Dharan.¯ındrabhadra. This covered the history of the religion up to the time of the Pala king R ¯ amap ¯ ala ¯ (r. c. 1072–1126). The second is the Buddhapur ¯an. a, a work by Dbang pos sbyin (Indradatta) in 1,200 verses, which went beyond Ramap ¯ ala to cover the succes- ¯ sor dynasty of the Senas of Gaud. a. It may therefore be supposed to have been composed in that part of India, like the work of Ks.mendrabhadra. The third is a work of similar length covering the succession of Ac¯ aryas and written by a ¯ 

brahmin scholar whom Taran ¯ atha calls Bhat ¯ .aghat ¯ .¯ı. This name is implausible as it stands. If, as is probable, it is is deformation of Vandyaghat.¯ıya, then it identifies him as a member of a well-known Rad¯ .h¯ıya brahmin lineage of Ben gal (> Bandyopadhy ¯ aya, Banerjee). ¯157 Taran ¯ atha claims to have relied primar- ¯ ily on the first of these three works, that is to say, for his account up to the time of Ramap ¯ ala, since that source went no further. ¯158 For the period of the Senas, who succeeded the Palas, he must have relied on Indradatta alone. As for ¯ Vandyaghat.¯ıya’s account of the succession of Ac¯ aryas, it is probable that it con- ¯ sisted of, or extended to, an account of the succession of the Tantric Ac¯ aryas of ¯ 

Vikramas´¯ıla from its foundation in the eighth century to its destruction around 

1200 by the forces of Muh. ammad Bakh ¯ tyar Kh ¯ alj¯ı. For he adds a section in the manner of a supplement on the Ac¯ aryas of Vikrama ¯ s´¯ıla after his treatment of 

the periods covered by his first two sources. His work, then, derives from Indian tradition, and while his sources were evidently inaccurate for the early history of Buddhism, we might expect them, particularly the work of Ks.mendrabhadra, 

the whole of Burdwan District, and Daks.in. arad¯ .ha, covering Bankura District and ¯ the non-coastal part of Midnapur District. 

157 In the eulogy of Bhat.t.a Bhavadeva, the learned minister of Harivarman (c. 1090+), in a stone inscription from Bhubaneswar, Bhavadeva’s mother Sangok ˙ a is said to be ¯ the daughter of a Vandyaghat.¯ıya brahmin (EI 6:17B, v. 13). Other Vandyaghat.¯ıyas are the Sarvananda who in 1159 wrote a commentary ¯ T.¯ık ¯asarvasva on the Li ˙ng ¯anu´s ¯asana of Amarasim. ha, the great 16th-century Dharmas´astrin Raghunan- ¯ dana, author of the Smr.titattva (PINGREE 1994, p. 341), Nar¯ ayan ¯ . a (fl. c. 1681), author of the Smr.tisarvasva or Smr.titattva (PINGREE 1994, p. 181), and Dvija Laks.man. a, who translated the Adik ¯an ¯. d. a of the Adhy ¯atmar ¯am ¯ayan. a into Bengali. 158 Rgya gar chos ’byung, pp. 215, l. 22–214, l.10; HBI, p. 350.

to be more reliable in their account of what for them was recent history.159 The Rgya gar chos ’byung therefore deserves close attention. 

Taran ¯ atha attributes to Dharmap ¯ ala the building of the monastery of ¯ Vikramas´¯ıla and to Devapala the building of the monasteries of Somapura and ¯ Trikat.uka.160 In this, however, he or his sources are confused. The claim that the monastery at Somapura was founded by Devapala is contradicted by a terracotta ¯ seal found at the site bearing the legend ´sr¯ısomapure ´sr¯ıdharmmap ¯aladeva mah ¯avih ¯are ‘in the Mahavih ¯ ara of Dharmap ¯ aladeva at Somapura’, ¯161 thereby indicating that it was founded not by Devapala but by his father Dharmap ¯ ala. ¯ Evidence also contradicts Taran ¯ atha’s claim that it was Devap ¯ ala that built the ¯ Trikat.uka monastery. For Haribhadra reports at the end of his Abhisamay ¯a lam. k ¯ar ¯aloka, his great commentary on the As.t.as ¯ahasrik ¯a Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯a, that he composed it in this monastery during the reign of Dharmapala and under his ¯ patronage.162 

159 After his account of the Tantric Ac¯ aryas who held office successively at Vikrama ¯ s´¯ıla Taran ¯ atha offers brief treatments of various topics not covered by these sources. ¯ Buddhism in mainland Southeast Asia and in maritime Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and the South is covered in ch. 39 and 40 respectively. On these topics, he says, he has seen no comprehensive work. Ch. 41 treats the spread of Buddhism in the Deccan following another lost work, the Flower-Garland, by a brahmin Manomati, which, he says, contained a brief account of this subject. Ch. 42 covers the divisions of the main Nikayas, evidently on the basis of such Indian treatments of the topic ¯ as the Samayabhedoparacanacakra of Vin¯ıtadeva; ch. 43 examines what he rightly considers to the muddled theories of the origin of the Mantranaya; and ch. 44 gives some notes on the various Indian schools of image-makers. This is followed by the account of his use of his sources. He notes that he has no written sources for the later events in his account that were not covered in those works. For these events he has relied on what he judged to be trustworthy oral reports.

In the case of the Somapura monastery it has been argued that we may salvage Taran ¯ atha’s credibility by concluding that Devap ¯ ala did found this ¯ monastery, as Taran ¯ atha claims, and that he gave it his father’s name rather ¯ than his own out of filial piety.163 This is indeed a practice of which there are other examples, its purpose being to transfer to the person named the religious merit generated by the creation and use of the foundation; but it is much more probable that Taran ¯ atha is in error here, as he clearly is in the case of the ¯ Trikat.uka monastery. For his history commits the fundamental error of revers ing the true sequence of the two reigns, placing that of Devapala before that of ¯ Dharmapala. ¯164 His attribution of the founding of Somapura and Trikat.uka to Devapala rather than Dharmap ¯ ala can, then, readily be explained as the result ¯ of this reversal. We may therefore suspect that his attribution of the founding of Vikramas´¯ıla to Dharmapala suffers from the same dislocation and that its ¯ true founder was his son Devapala. That this suspicion is correct is confirmed ¯ by the Adikarmaprad¯ıpa ¯ of Anupamavajra. For in its conclusion he tells us that he compiled the work following the instruction of Dharmakara, a monk ¯ whom he describes as “residing in the monastery called Vikrama constructed by king Devapala”. ¯165 Vikrama here is evidently a bh¯ımavat contraction for Vikramas´¯ıla.166 However, we may not conclude that everything that Taran ¯ atha ¯ attributes to Dharmapala was Devap ¯ ala’s doing, and ¯ vice versa. He reports, for 

of the swollen globes on the foreheads of the furious elephants [of his enemies], has attained his glorious success by virtue of the dedication produced by his repeated pious works’. For the use of sthitv ¯a here cf. the final verse of the Sam. varoday ¯a n ¯ama man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Bhuv¯ ac¯ arya cited here, p. 82. ¯

probability that this report is accurate is increased by the fact that he, unlike Taran ¯ atha, knew that Dharmap ¯ ala came before not after Devap ¯ ala. T ¯ aran ¯ atha ¯ assigns it to Devapala, probably in consequence of the aforesaid confusion, ¯ though he also reports a tradition that it was founded by Dharmapala’s father ¯ Gopala, the first of the P ¯ alas. ¯170 

Taran ¯ atha reports that Dharmap ¯ ala adopted two persons as his preceptors: ¯ Haribhadra and his pupil Buddhajn˜ana. While the former was a master of the ¯ Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯a, the latter was a renowned authority on the Tantric system taught in the Guhyasam ¯aja.171 We are told that he performed the rituals for the consecration of the Vikramas´¯ıla monastery and was appointed as its Vajrac¯ arya. ¯ We also learn that, having seen omens of the future ruin of the dynasty un der Dharmapala’s grandson, he persuaded the king to institute a regular fire- ¯ sacrifice (homah.) to be performed under his guidance by the Tantric officiants of this monastery with the purpose of ensuring that the dynasty would be long lived and consequently that Buddhism would be widely disseminated. It was performed, we are told, for many years at huge expense.172 Further evidence of 

it appears that it began as a small Sangh ˙ ar¯ ama donated by the fourth Gupta king, ¯ Kumaragupta ¯ Sakr ´ aditya, who reigned from 415 to 455. It then grew through the ¯ addition of further Viharas until by Xuanzang’s time it had become the foremost ¯ Buddhist structure in India, famed throughout Buddhist Asia as a centre of learn ing.

Dharmapala’s commitment to Buddhism is found in the Nesarik ¯ a grant of the ¯ Ras¯ .t.rakut¯ .a king Govinda III issued in 805, since that reveals that the ensign depicted on his war banner was the Buddhist goddess Tar¯ a. ¯173 

As for Gopala (r. ¯ c. 750–775), the father of Dharmapala, whom all our sources ¯ make the first of the Palas, there is no evidence in the inscriptions that he ¯ too was a Buddhist, unless it be his having been referred to in inscriptions of Nar¯ ayan ¯ . apala (r. ¯ c. 860–917) and Vigrahapala III (r. ¯ c. 1043–1070) as a second Buddha.174 However, the R ¯ajavy ¯akaran. a claims him for the faith, saying that af ter a dissolute youth he converted to Buddhism and constructed various monas teries, Caityas, and temples.175 Taran ¯ atha likewise claims that he served the ¯ cause of Buddhism by founding many monasteries, both in Bengal, which he ruled in the first part of his career, and Magadha, when he had added that great province to his kingdom through conquest.176 He also recounts a legend accord

And so [the king] had the fire-sacrifice done for many years by Vajradharas led by the Ac¯ arya [Buddhaj ¯ n˜anap ¯ ada], offer- ¯ ing substances worth 902,000 tolas of silver’; HBI, p. 278. The ritual was evidently a ´s ¯antihomah., a sacrifice for the averting of disaster. Such rituals are generic but they are made to serve the specific purposes of the patron by writing these into the formula of intention (sam. kalpah.) that must be recited at the opening of any such ritual; see SANDERSON 2005a, p. 357–358 and fn. 22 in a discussion of the Tantric Saiva ritual commissioned by the Khmer ruler Jayavarman II (r. 802– ´ c. 835) “in order that this land of Kambuja [Kambujadesa] should not continue to be a depen- ´ dency of Java and so that only one king should be univeral ruler [in this region]” (K. ¯ 235, Khmer, C ll. 71–75: vrah. p ¯ada parame´svara a ˜njen thve vidhi leha le ˙n kampi kamvujade´sa neh.¯ayatta ta jav ¯a ley le ˙n ¯ac ti kamrate ˙n phdai karom. mv ¯ay guh.ta j ¯a cakravartti).

In his account of Buddhism under the successors of Gopala, Dharmap ¯ ala, ¯ and Devapala, T ¯ aran ¯ atha gives us one more report of royal monastery building. ¯ But unfortunately his sources seem to have been so misinformed in their pre sentation of the order and identity of these subsequent kings that it is no easy task to discern the reign to which this building activity should be assigned. He tells us that Mahap¯ ala, whom he claims to have been the son and successor of ¯ Mah¯ıpala, built the Uruv ¯ asa monastery, described as a branch of the monastery ¯ at Uddan. d. apura, and founded Buddhist establishments at the monasteries of Naland ¯ a, Somapura, and Trikat ¯ .uka.179 Taran ¯ atha has his Mah ¯ ¯ıpala rule for ¯ 

first part of his life he governed Vang˙ ala. In the subsequent part he subjected Ma- ¯ gadha. Near Uddan. d. apura he built a monastery called Nalendra. By establishing ¯ many divisions of the Sangha [in monasteries] in these two large regions he greatly ˙ honoured the religion [of the Buddha]; HBI, p. 258.

Cunda, though she ¯ appears not have been a major constituent of learned Tantric Buddhism, seems to have been popular in the region. Two bronze statues of this goddess have been found in Pala territory, one from Kurkih ¯ ar cast in the reign of Mah ¯ ¯ıpala I, and the other ¯ from Naland ¯ a, assigned by H ¯ UNTINGTON on stylistic grounds to the ninth century (HUNTINGTON 1984, pp. 60–61, 226–227, and 144; figs. 61 and 169; wrongly giving the name as Cun. d. a); and there was a temple of Cund ¯ a in Pat ¯ .t.ikera (Mainamat ¯ ¯ı) near Comilla, which is illustrated in a manuscript of the As.t.as ¯ahasrik ¯a Praj ˜n ¯a p ¯aramit ¯a (ULC MS Add. 1643, copied in 1015), as one of eighty-five illustrations of Buddhist sacred sites, most in eastern India, with the legend pat.t.ikere cund ¯avara bhavane cund ¯a (MITRA 1971, p. 244).

fifty-two years and says that he died at about the same time as the Tibetan king Khri ral,180 that is to say, Khri gtsug lde brtsan also called Ral pa can, who ruled from about 815 to 836; and his son Mahap¯ ala is assigned a reign of 41 ¯ years,181 that is to say, up to about 900. Now, there are two Mah¯ıpalas known to ¯ us from the epigraphical record, both of whom were much later, the first ruling c. 977–1027 and the second c. 1070–1071; but there is no Mahap¯ ala. The similar- ¯ ity with the name of his father raises the suspicion that one king Mah¯ıpala, no ¯ doubt Mah¯ıpala I, the length of his reign agreeing closely with that attributed to ¯ Mah¯ıpala by T ¯ aran ¯ atha, has become Mah ¯ ¯ıpala and Mah ¯ ap¯ ala, and that the re- ¯ sulting two reigns, amounting implausibly to ninety-three years, served to bridge a gulf of ignorance of the period between the great founders of the Pala empire ¯ and Mah¯ıpala I, who restored the fortunes of the P ¯ alas after a period during ¯ which, following Devapala, they had lapsed into insignificance, losing control of ¯ Bengal and retreating into a core territory in Bihar around modern Patna.182 It is probable, then, that Taran ¯ atha’s attribution to Mah ¯ ap¯ ala of the expansion of ¯ Uddan. d. apura and the founding of Buddhist establishments at Naland ¯ a, Soma- ¯ pura, and Trikat.uka is a distortion of a record of the pious works of Mah¯ıpala I. ¯ The supposition is somewhat strengthened by the fact that Taran ¯ atha says that ¯ the K ¯alacakratantra was introduced during the latter half of Mah¯ıpala’s life and ¯ that it spread during the reign of Mahap¯ ala. ¯183 For it was during the reign of Mah¯ıpala I that this new Tantric system emerged. ¯184

After Mah¯ıpala the monastic universities already established continued to ¯ flourish, but Pala fortunes once again went into decline, and it is therefore not ¯ surprising that Taran ¯ atha has no major royal benefactions to report during this ¯ period. However, during the long reign of Ramap ¯ ala (r. ¯ c. 1072–1126), the last major ruler of this dynasty, the kingdom recovered, and we might expect this to be reflected in a renewal of material patronage. It is tempting therefore to accept the claim made by Hara Prasad SHASTRI in 1910185 and repeated by many since that time186 that the Jagaddalamahavih ¯ ara, ¯187 the one great monastery in the Pala domains whose founder has not yet been identified, was the creation of this ¯ monarch. But there is no evidence that supports this claim188 

Nor is there any that refutes it. In the introduction to the edition of the Subh ¯as.itaratnakos. a published by KOSAMBI and GOKHALE the former has asserted on the strength of evidence provided by the latter that Ramap ¯ ala’s ¯ coronation took place in this monastery,189 in which case, of course, it could not have been founded by him during his reign. But that too cannot be accepted. The evidence cited is GOKHALE’s rendering of the colophonic verse at the end of the *Bhagavaty ¯amny ¯ay ¯anus ¯arin.¯ı vy ¯akhy ¯a, a commentary on the As.t.as ¯ahasrik ¯a Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯a which survives in Tibetan translation (Toh. 3811): ¯190 “This vy ¯akhy ¯a was composed by Raja-jagaddala-niv ¯ as¯ ¯ı [which thus becomes the writer’s name] at the Jagaddala vihara, which was the place of R ¯ amap ¯ ala’s ¯ coronation”.191 But this rendering is wildly inaccurate. The meaning of the Tibetan is: “I, a resident of the venerable Rajajagaddala [monastery], have ¯ composed this commentary, a string of pearls (mukt ¯aval¯ı) [to be an adornment] of the land protected by King Ramap ¯ ala”. ¯192 This does at least convey the

valuable information that the monastery was a royal foundation, since the Tibetan of its name dpal ldan rgyal po dza ga ta la, is evidently a translation of ´sr¯ımadraja ¯ jagaddala-, a form of the name confirmed by its occurrence in Sanskrit at the end of Moks.akaragupta’s ¯ Tarkabh ¯as ¯a, in which he informs us that he too was a resident of this monastery (´sr¯ımadr ¯ajajagaddalavih ¯ar¯ıya-).193 But we remain ignorant of the king who founded it. We know that it existed in the time of Ramap ¯ ala, and it is not impossible that it was indeed the work of this ¯ last great king of the dynasty; but no evidence of which I am aware precludes its having been created by a predecessor. 

Some idea of the scale of the Great Monasteries in the Pala domains is pro- ¯ vided by Taran ¯ atha. He informs us that in the reign of R ¯ amap ¯ ala, even after ¯ the decline from the time of the early Palas, there were one hundred and sixty ¯ monks holding posts as Pan. d.itas at Vikramas´¯ıla, and that there were about a thousand monks permanently in residence, both there and at Uddan. d. apura, with many more assembling on the occasion of festivals.194 We also learn that when Vikramas´¯ıla was founded its design incorporated one hundred and eight shrines: a central temple housing a life-size statue of the Great Awakening (Mahabodhi) ¯195 surrounded by fifty-three small temples dedicated to the inner 

precedes—mi yi dbang po ‘king’, lit. ‘lord of men’, rendering Sanskrit nr. patih., narendrah., or a synonym—, the fact that r ¯a ma p ¯a las after it is instrumental not genitive, and the fact that the emphatic and separative particle ni that ends the larger phrase of which this is part and marks it out as the subject militates against its being taken as qualifying the monastery. The expression mu tig phreng ba describing the commentary figuratively as a string of pearls is probably also in tended to convey its title by paronomasia, i.e. Mukt ¯aval¯ı, a title found elsewhere in this literature, for example as the title of Ratnakara ¯ s´anti’s commentary on the ¯ Hevajratantra. The author remains anonymous. 

193 Tarkabh ¯as.¯a, p. 39. KAJIYAMA (1998, pp. 6–11) shows that Moks.akaragupta was ¯ active at some time after c. 1050 and before c. 1292.

deities of the Mantranaya (gsang sngags nang gi lha khang chung ngu) and fifty-four “common” temples (lha khang dkyus ma), that is to say, temples en shrining exoteric, non-Tantric images. The king, we are told, provided generous allowances for the food and clothing of one hundred and eight Pan. d.itas, three Vajrac¯ arya specialists to perform Bali offerings, rituals of image-installation, and ¯ fire-sacrifices respectively, and three officials. The first is the ‘Guardian of Duties’ (bya ba bsrung pa), perhaps an official appointed to ensure monks’ adherence to the various roles assigned to them in the running of the monastery. The second is termed mysteriously ‘Guardian of Doves’ (phug ron bsrung pa), and the third is the ‘Supervisor of the Monastery’s Subjects’ (lha ’bangs kyi gnyer byed pa), these being, perhaps, both the serfs or tenants that worked the monastery’s es tates and the servants within the monastery itself.196 Archaeological excavations have revealed that the cell-lined square court of Vikramas´¯ıla197 measured 1073 feet on each side, that the entire site was spread over an area of more than one hundred acres,198 and that Dharmapala’s monastery at Somapura (P ¯ ah¯ ar¯ .pur) was of similar design and plan and of only slightly smaller size,199 as was the monastery founded by Bhavadeva of Samatat.a at Pat.t.ikera (Mainamat ¯ ¯ı).200 We also have some information concerning the scale of the monastery at Naland ¯ a¯ during the early seventh century when the Chinese scholar Xuanzang was there. According to the account written by his pupil Huili there were as many 10,000

The massive central cruciform shrine-complex measures 386 by 352 feet. 

200 This monastery is probably that known as the Salban Vih ¯ ara, consisting like the ¯ monasteries of Vikramas´¯ıla and Somapura of a massive cruciform shrine within a square enclosure which though considerably smaller than that of those monasteries was nonetheless of great size, each side being 550 feet in length; see MITRA in EITA, vol. 2, pt. 2, pp. 402–403.

These royal monasteries are likely to have accumulated great wealth. The tax-exempt agricultural lands granted to them at the time of their foundation would have provided them with a substantial initial endowment: Huili reports that Naland ¯ a’s was the revenue of about 100 villages; ¯202 and the wealth from this source would no doubt have been augmented by subsequent land-grants203 and would certainly have been augmented by other votive donations, bequests from the estates of deceased laymen,204 and the profits of such non-religious activities as banking and the provision of irrigation and other agricultural facilities.205 

No doubt they would also have benefitted from the riches accumulated by individual monks in the form of the rewards (daks.in.¯a) that they earned by giving initiations, imparting instruction, installing images, consecrating monasteries and temples, reciting sacred texts, and performing rites for protection, funeral ceremonies, and the like.206 Tibetan sources record the very large amounts of gold which Indian and Tibetans required for such services. ’Brog mi agreed to give the Indian Gayadhara 100 gold srang, some 3,750 grams, each year for five years in return for the transmission of the esoteric Lam ’bras teachings;207 Zur po che sha kya ’byung nas offered ’Brog mi 100; ¯208 Rva lo tsa ba gave 100 ¯ srang to the Nepalese Guru Bha ro phyag rdum for the Yam ¯ari cycle instructions; Se

203 We have a record (EI 17:17: the Naland ¯ a copper-plate of Devap ¯ ala) of one such sub- ¯ sequent land-grant in the case of the monastery at Naland ¯ a. This records that in ¯ the 35th year of Devapala, ¯ c. 847, five villages were assigned for the support of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha of a new monastery ( ˙ vih ¯arah.) constructed at this site by Mahar¯ aja B ¯ alaputradeva, the ¯ Sailendra king of Suvarn ´. adv¯ıpa (Suma tra). That the regnal year is the 35th is the view of SIRCAR (1983, p. 79, note 38). Hirananda SHASTRI read the numerals as 39 (EI 17:17, l. 42). 

204 The M ¯ulasarv ¯astiv ¯adavinaya speaks of the validity of written wills in which wealthy laymen transfer their entire estate to the the Sangha; see ˙ Gilgit Manuscripts vol. 3, pt. 2, p. 140, l. 14–15, l. 1; and SCHOPEN 2004, p. 6. It also sets out rules obliging monks to accept permanent endowments of cash (aks. ayan¯ıv¯ı) (SCHOPEN, loc. cit.).

As for banking, the M ¯ulasarv ¯astiv ¯adavinaya requires the funds of per manent endowments (aks. ayan¯ıv¯ı) for the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha to ˙ be lent out on interest (vr.ddhih.) (SCHOPEN 2004, pp. 6–7, 47–49, 53).

tsha bsod nams rgyal mtshan gave 50 srang to the Nepalese Kaya ¯ sr´ ¯ı for the precepts of the Nam mkha’ skor gsum; Mar pa performed a rite to protect the sons of some wealthy men and charged 10 gold srang for each son;209 and the hagiographies of early Tibetans who travelled to India to acquire initiation and instruction abound in reports of the need to amass large quantities of gold for this purpose.210 

It would be rash to assume that the fortunes that were garnered in this way by Indian Ac¯ aryas were added directly to the resources of their monasteries. ¯ A passage in the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhitantra, a text produced in the sev enth century, at the beginning of the history of the Mantranaya as a fully-fledged path within the Mahay¯ ana, ¯211 suggests that this was the case:212 

After the [´s ¯antika]homah.the Mantrin should request from the disciples a fee (daks.in.¯a) of gold, silver, jewels, a stallion, an elephant, a mare, a cow, a bull, a buffalo, cloth, and whatever else is fitting. At that time the disciples should give the daks.in.¯a to the Guru, respectfully, with faith, generating joy in their minds. Or at any rate they should make the Guru entirely satisfied. After [the Mantrin, that is to say, the Guru] has done this he should do a rite of self-protection and then exhort the excellent disciples as follows: All the Buddhas teach that this is a field for [the sowing of] merit for the benefit of all living beings. Therefore give to the Sangha, [for it is] vast in its pure virtues. ˙ 

But it is striking that references to the Sangha are not found in this context in ˙ later texts, which only specify the goods that should be given.These are much the same as in the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, though D¯ıpankarabhadra, setting ˙ out the procedure for initiation with the Man. d. ala of the Guhyasam ¯aja, adds land

But H ¯ ODGE (2003, pp. 14–15) points out that Yijing’s Xiyuqiufaguosengzhuan (‘Record of Em inent Monks who Sought the Dharma in the West’) reports that the monk Wuxing, his contemporary in India, had died as he was setting out to return to China in 674, that texts he had collected were forwarded to China, and that three important Tantras are listed among these works: the Sub ¯ahuparipr.cch ¯a, the Susiddhikara, and the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi.

at the head of the list,213 and the scripture Laghu´sam. varatantra goes so far as in clude a r ¯as.t.ram, which I take to mean [the revenues of] ‘a district’ or ‘sub-district’ of a kingdom and therefore to be envisaging the gift of a monarch.214 Moreover, the M ¯ulasarv ¯astiv ¯adavinaya, which was the predominant code of monastic law in eastern India and was thence adopted in Tibet, recognizes that monks had private property and that there could be great differences of wealth owned by individuals within the Sangha. However, it also insists that such property does ˙ not go to the king when a monk dies, as brahmanical law required in the case of those who die without offspring, but remains within the monastic community to which he belongs.215 Of course, a wealthy Guru could also donate his wealth to

The use of the term r ¯as.t.ram for ‘a district’ or ‘sub-district’ is seen in in scriptions; see SIRCAR 1966, pp. 277–278. My translation of the passage follows the text and interpretation of the commentator Bhavabhat.t.a. The reading nirj ¯atyam., which he interprets as ‘most precious’, is suspect. The MS (Laghu´sam. vara, f. 4r2) reads the much more satisfactory niry ¯atya ‘having given’, as does the com mentator Kambalapada ( ¯ S ¯adhananidhi, f. 11v4); and this is also the reading seen in f. 54v3–5 of the Sam. varoday ¯a n ¯ama man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Bhuv¯ ac¯ arya of Ratna- ¯ giri in Orissa (see here p. 91), in the Nepalese codex unicus of 1056. See also Catus. p¯ıt.hatantra f. 60v1–2 (4.1.46–47), which includes a house, land with rights to mine, and grain: tato gurudaks.inam. dady ¯a ´sis. ya bh ¯avena nitya´sah.| ¯atmapatn¯ım. saputram. v ¯a b ¯andhavaih.saha cet.ikaih.| hasti a´sva gav ¯ad¯ın ¯am. gr. ha ks.etras ca go- ´ travan¯ k sauvarn. a rajata t ¯amram. vastr ¯adi vrıhidh ¯ anyakaih ¯.. The Vimalaprabh ¯a on K ¯alacakratantra, Abhis.ekapat.ala v. 198 explains that verse as meaning that the initiate should promise always to give to his Guru one sixth of all his inherited and self-acquired wealth in the form of gold, jewels, grains and the like, and a sixth of all his livestock. It adds that he is required to give his wife to the Guru five times each month (vol. 2, p. 144, ll. 17–22). 

215 The inheritance of the property of deceased monks is treated in the M ¯ulasarv ¯asti v ¯adavinaya in the C¯ıvaravastu (Gilgit Manuscripts vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 113–148). Par ticularly relevant in this context is its discussion of the case of the monk Upananda, who died leaving 300,000 in gold (pp. 117–121). King Prasenajit is persuaded that the estate does not belong to the crown and the Buddha rules that it should be

the monasteries during his lifetime by creating religious endowments. We have a striking example of this in the eleventh century. Rva Lo tsa ba, who had be- ¯ come extremely wealthy by charging for instruction in the Tantras—he is said to have established fixed rates for a wide range of texts—, sent 100 srangs of gold to Vikramas´¯ıla to fund the recitation in perpetuity of a copy of the Pa ˜nca vim.´satis ¯ahasrik ¯a Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯a written in gold, two golden copies of the As.t.a s ¯ahasrik ¯a Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯a, and 100 srangs of gold to fund the recitation in per petuity of eighty-four copies of the Praj ˜n ¯ap ¯aramit ¯asam.cayag ¯ath ¯a by eighty-four Pan. d.itas of the monastery.216 

How closely the Pala emperors and their bureaucracy were involved in the ¯ supervision of their Buddhist foundations cannot be determined from the avail able evidence. But it is almost certain that a Superintendent would have been appointed by the ruler to oversee their administration and that he would have required a substantial staff to enable him to do so. The Ratn ¯aval¯ı, a Mahay¯ anist ¯ work of uncertain authorship written before the sixth century,217 advises the un known king to whom it is addressed on the proper administration of his realm 

distributed among the monks of his monastery: bh ¯ajayata y ¯uyam. bhiks. ava upa nandasya bhiks. or mr.taparis. k ¯aram (p. 119, ll. 13–14). The main concern here is to ensure that the wealth of monks stays within the community, free of the state’s interferecee. For analysis of the treatment of these and related matters in the M ¯ulasarv ¯astiv ¯ada-vinaya see SCHOPEN 2004, pp. 3–6. The private property of a deceased monk was to be divided, directly or after sale, among the members of his community or, where this was not appropriate, as in the case of land, servants, and grain-stores, taken over for the use of the whole community (Gilgit Manuscripts, vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 141, l. 4–143, l. 1). But when the estate contained precious metals, worked or not, those were to be divided into three shares, one for each of the Three Jewels (Gilgit Manuscripts, vol. 3, pt. 2, p. 143, ll. 10–12: suvarnam.ca hiran. yam. ca yac c ¯anyac ca kr.t ¯akr.tam.trayo bh ¯ag ¯ah. kartavy ¯ah.| eko buddhasya | eko dhar masya tr.t¯ıyah.sa ˙nghasya). That for the Buddha should be used for repairs to the monastery’s Buddha shrine (gandhakut.¯ı) and relic Stupas, that for the Dharma ¯ should fund the copying or enthroning of the Buddha’s teachings, and that for the Sangha should be divided among the monks ( ˙ ibid., ll. 12–14). In the case of jewels other than pearls half should go to the Dharma and half to the Sangha ( ˙ ibid., ll. 1– 5). Manuscripts of Buddhist texts should be added to the monastery’s library and manuscripts of non-Buddhist texts should be sold and the proceeds shared (ibid., ll. 5–7).

217 The work is attributed to the Nag¯ arjuna of ¯ M ¯ul ¯amadhyamakak ¯arik ¯a fame. I con sider this attribution to be doubtful in spite the fact that it is made by such au thors of the sixth century and later as Bhavaviveka, Candrak ¯ ¯ırti, Haribhadra, Ka malas´¯ıla, and *Ajitamitra (Mi pham bshes gnyen), who wrote the only known com mentary on the text, which has come down to us in a Tibetan translation made by the Bande Dpal brtsegs with the Indian Vidyakaraprabha in the early ninth cen- ¯ tury. The Ratn ¯aval¯ı itself contains no evidence of its authorship and VETTER (1992) has cast doubt on the traditional attribution through an analysis of its metre and word frequency.

and begins by declaring: “Appoint for all religious foundations a Superinten dent of Religion (dharm ¯adhikr.tah.) who is energetic, without avarice, learned, and virtuous, who will not oppress them”.218 It goes on to advise him on the qualities he should look for in those whom he appoints as ministers (saciv ¯ah.), military commanders (dan. d. an ¯ayak ¯ah.), and superintendents (adhikr.t ¯ah.), telling the king: “Have them submit to you complete monthly accounts of revenues and outgoings and, after hearing these, personally conduct all business pertaining to religious foundations and the rest”.219 This, of course, is not evidence of what was done in the Pala realm. But as I read the passage it is the qualities and ¯ duties of these various officials that are the subject of injunction, not their exis tence; and there is certainly nothing exceptional in the office itself, since we have evidence that it was normal in kingdoms throughout the Indic world.220 Ab 

218 Ratn ¯aval¯ı 4.22: sarvadharm ¯adhik ¯ares.u dharm ¯adhikr.tam utthitam | alubdham. pan. d.itam. dharmyam. kuru tes.¯am ab ¯adhakam. The term dharm ¯adhik ¯arah., which elsewhere is used to refer to the office of the Superintendent, is clearly used here in the meaning ‘religious foundation’, as the Tibetan translation chos kyi gzhi agrees, and as it occurrence earlier in the same passage (4.18) confirms: dharm ¯adhik ¯ar ¯a ye c ¯anye p ¯urvar ¯ajapravartit ¯ah.| devadron. y ¯adayas te ’pi pravartyant ¯am. yath ¯a sthit ¯ah. ‘And you should ensure that temples and other religious foundations created by former kings should continue as they are’. This sense of the word is also found in Licchavi inscriptions; see LKA 71, ll. 12; and 81, l. 11–12: bhavis. yadbhir api bh ¯upatibhih. p ¯urvar ¯ajakr.tadharm ¯adhik ¯arap ¯alan ¯adr.tair bhavitavyam ‘Future kings too must take care to maintain religious foundations created by kings of the past’.

The fifth Da-¯ modarpur copper-plate inscription, of 533/4, recording a formal request for the pur chase of land in the Kot.ivars.a district to be given to a nearby temple, speaks of it being presented with the full knowledge of the Office of Religion (dharm ¯adhik ¯ara buddhy ¯a) (EI 15:7, p. 143). A banker Ralhan. a has the title dharmakarm ¯adhik ¯ar¯ı ‘the superintendent of religious activities’ in the Kharod inscription dated in 1181/2 of Ratnadeva III, the Kalacuri of Ratnapura (EI 21:26, l. 28: ´sres.t.hin ¯a ralhan.e n ¯atra dharmakarm ¯adhik ¯arin.¯a).

sence of thorough external control of the great monasteries seems all the more unlikely when one considers that apart from the fact that they were such large and wealthy establishments it was not the case that by building, equipping, and endowing a monastery a patron surrendered his ownership entirely. The patron continued to be the owner of the monastery and its contents (mah ¯avih ¯arasv ¯am¯ı, vih ¯arasv ¯am¯ı) in some sense and the monks were obliged to employ all these for the purposes for which they were designated, the return for the owner being the constantly augmenting merit that was generated for him by their repeated use (paribhog ¯anvayam. pun. yam). Only where there was no such use, as in the case of a Caitya, did a donor gain merit once and for all by the simple act of surrendering ownership (ty ¯ag ¯anvyayam. pun. yam).221 

Moreover, we know that monks who held senior teaching positions in the great monasteries did so by royal appointment,222 and that rituals for state pro 

of Kam¯ akhy ¯ a, near Gauhati in Assam, recording a grant of land by a king M ¯ adhava. ¯ The inscription opens with the information that the grant has the approval of this official: dharm ¯adhikr.ten ¯anumatam (SIRCAR 1979, p. 16, l. 1). Mpu Prapanca re- ˜ veals in his Old Javanese poem De´sawarn. ana that there were two Superintendents of Religion in the Majapahit kingdom of east Java, one for the Buddhists (dharm ¯a dhyaks. a kasogatan), and the other for the Saivas ( ´ dharm ¯adhyaks. a kashaiwan). Inscriptions from that kingdom reveal that there was also a board of subordinate religious officials known as the Assessors of Religion (dharmopapatti or dharm ¯adhi karan. a); see SANTIKO 1995, p. 56; cf. here p.119; for references see ZOETMULDER 1982, under dharm ¯adhyaks. a, dharmopapatti and dharm ¯adhikaran. a. 

221 On this crucial distinction between paribhog ¯anvayam. pun. yam and ty ¯ag ¯anvayam. pun. yam see Vasubandhu, Abhidharmako´sabh ¯as. ya on 4.121a (caitye ty ¯ag ¯anvayam. pun. yam ‘In the case of a Caitya there is merit that accrues from surrender’): caitye sar ¯agasy ¯atm ¯artham. d ¯anam ity uktam | tatr ¯asaty upabhoktari katham. pun. yam. bha vati | dvividham. pun. yam.ty ¯ag ¯anvayam.ty ¯ag ¯ad eva yad utpadyate paribhog ¯anvayam. ca deyadharmaparibhog ¯ad yad utpadyate | caitye tyag¯ anvayam ¯. pun.yam (4.121a) ‘It has been said that a gift to a Caitya made by one who is not free of attachment is for his own benefit. Since there is no enjoyer of the gift in such cases how can there be merit [generated by such a gift]? Merit is of two kinds: ty ¯ag ¯anvayam, which arises only from the surrender [of ownership of what is given], and parib hog ¯anvayam, which arises from the enjoyment of a pious gift [by the recipients]’. One should note that the restrictive particle eva is used here only after ty ¯ag ¯ad. Va subandhu does not state conversely in the case of paribhog ¯anvayam. pun. yam that this kind of merit arises only (eva) from the use of the donation. I infer that merit in such cases was understood to arise both from the act of surrendering possession and from subsequent use. This is confirmed by Candrak¯ırti, who in his Prasanna pad ¯a, commenting on paribhog ¯anvayam in Madhyamakak ¯arik ¯a 17.5a, speaks of the goods used as ‘surrendered’ (parityaktasya). See Abhidharmako´sabh ¯as. ya on 4.4ab addressing the conundrum of how the Buddha’s doctrine of moral action as intention (cetan ¯a) can be reconciled with this claim of the accretion of further merit (pun. yavr.ddhih.) whenever a recipient uses something donated whether or not the donor is aware of it; and SANDERSON 1995c, pp. 38–40.

These seven are not listed, but Taran ¯ atha does say which of the P ¯ alas were excluded from the list.

I take the term patra here (=patram, patrik ¯a) to mean an official document bestowing an office and hence by exten sion office or authority bestowed by this means; cf. patrik ¯a in Tantr ¯alokaviveka, vol. 3, p. 191, ll. 3–6, the commentary of the Kashmirian Mah ¯anayaprak ¯a´sa p. 115,8, and V ¯amake´svar¯ımatavivaran. a, p. 55 (on the theft of such documents by fraudulent Gurus); also the expressions t ¯amrapatram and ´s ¯asanapatram for a royal charter.

than autonomous, self-governing institutions. 

The P ¯alas’ Engagement with Saivism ´ 

The Palas were certainly the most liberal patrons of Buddhist institutions ¯ in early medieval India, and it was no doubt largely because of this that the religion was able to develop and flourish so remarkably in their realm. However, it should not be thought that the scale of these rulers’ support implies that they at least, unlike the other royal patrons of Buddhism that have been reviewed here, must have turned their backs on Saivism, starving it of patronage that it ´ might otherwise have received. For there is much evidence to the contrary. 

In the ninth century Devapala is praised in a charter of his son Mahen- ¯ drapala for having built two temples of outstanding beauty during his rule, ¯ one for the Buddha and the other for the consort of Siva; ´ 226 and Mahen drapala is reported to have established a temple for the emaciated goddess ¯ Carca (Carcik ¯ a/C¯ amun ¯ . d. a). ¯227 An eleventh-century Prasasti from B ´ an¯ . garh, ancient Kot.ivars.a in Varendr¯ı, also called Dev¯ıkot.a and Son ´.itapura, informs us that Nayapala had the Saiddh ¯ antika Sarva ¯ siva as his royal preceptor ´ 

(gaud. ar ¯ajaguruh.), and that when Sarvasiva retired he passed this office to ´ his brother Murti ¯ siva. This implies that Nayap ´ ala received ¯ Saiva initiation, ´ since to initiate the king is fundamental to the Saiva R ´ ajaguru’s role. It also ¯ tells us that at the site of this inscription Mah¯ıpala I, Nayap ¯ ala’s predecessor, ¯ had bestowed a Kailasa-like monastery on Sarva ¯ siva’s predecessor Indra ´ siva. ´ Mah¯ıpala is described here as a ‘knower of reality’ ( ¯ tattvavit), which suggests in this Saiva context that he too had received ´ Saiva initiation, which suggests ´ in turn that the gift of the monastery was his Guru’s daks.in.¯a. It is probable, therefore, that Indrasiva too, like his successors Sarva ´ siva and M ´ urti ¯ siva, ´

had held the office of royal preceptor.228 I know of no direct evidence that Mah¯ıpala’s successor Vigrahap ¯ ala III had a Saiddh ¯ antika R ¯ ajaguru, but it is ¯ likely that he did, since in his Am¯. gachi copper-plate inscription he is described ¯ as ‘devoted to Siva’s worship’, ´ 229 and there is evidence which strongly suggests 

that this tradition was still in place under his successor Ramap ¯ ala. For in the ¯ twelfth century the South-Indian Saiddhantika Trilocanasiva tells us that his ´ preceptorial line descends from a Dharmasambhu (Dharma ´ siva) who had held ´ office as the royal preceptor of “the king of Gaud. a”, a standard expression for the Pala rulers. ¯230 Since three preceptorial generations intervene in that account between Dharmasambhu and Trilocana ´ siva, it is probable that this king was ´ Ramap ¯ ala. ¯231

Similarly, the Bhagalpur copper-plate inscription of N ¯ ar¯ ayan ¯ . apala (r. ¯ c. 860– 917) records his establishing a Siva and granting a village to it and the associ- ´ 

ation of Pa¯supat ´ ac¯ aryas ( ¯ p ¯a´supat ¯ac ¯aryaparis. at.) attached to the foundation; and though it gives him the epithet paramasaugatah.it reports that he had been re sponsible for the building of a vast number of other temples for this deity.234 

We have even more striking evidence of this kind in the case of Nayapala. ¯ His Siyan stone slab inscription ( ¯ EI 39:7) devotes most of its sixty-five verses (21–63) to detailing an extensive program of royal temple building and image installation undertaken throughout the Pala realm. Damage to the inscription ¯ has removed the name of the king who was responsible for this program, but it is extremely unlikely that it was other than Nayapala, since the account follows ¯ immediately on that of his martial exploits, following those of his predecessors. These pious activities comprise the construction of a temple topped by golden lions and a finial, evidently therefore a Vad. abh¯ı temple for a goddess,235 with a temple of Siva and an attached two-storied monastery ( ´ mat.ho dvibh ¯umih.) for the accommodation of ascetics to its south (v. 24), a temple with a [golden] finial, 

memory of the author of the inscription, to the effect that during the austerities that Parvat ¯ ¯ı undertook to win the hand of Siva her face was just as charming with ´ her ascetic’s braids as it had been with her elegantly adorned coiffure; for, says Kalid ¯ asa: “The lotus is not beautiful only when when lines of bees hover about it ¯ but even when [strands of] duckweed cling to it” (na s. at.pada´sren.ibhir eva pa ˙nkajam. sasaival ´ asa ¯ ngam ˙ api prak ¯a´sate). However, this solution has the weakness that it is not open to any obvious explanation of how the error arose. Perhaps the per son who wrote the letters on the stone before they were engraved was thinking of Vamar ¯ a¯si’s official status in Benares. If that, as is very likely, was as the ab- ´ bot of a Saiva monastery, then the error ´- ¯adh¯ı´sam might be the result of the in trusion into his mind of an expression such as ´saiv ¯adh¯ı´sam, ´saivamat.h ¯adh¯ı´sam, or ´saiv ¯alay ¯adh¯ı´sam. For the expression mat.h ¯adh¯ı´sah.(=mat.h ¯adhipatih.) see, e.g., R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı 7.298ab: bhat.t.¯arakamat.hadh ¯ ı¯sah ´.s ¯adhur vyoma´sivo jat.¯ı; and the anonymous Kum ¯arap ¯aladevacarita v. 51a: tam. nimantrya mat.hadh ¯ ı¯sam´.(called mat.h ¯adhipatih.in v. 49b). But this would be more convincing if the reading corrupted were closer to ´saival ¯adh¯ı´sam in written appearance or pronunciation. Citraghan.t.a has her temple in Benares near that of ¯ Siva Citragupte ´ svara as one of ´ the Nine Durgas. The sense intended may be that he had [new] shrines built for all ¯ nine of these goddesses.

Buddhist Kings of Eastern India and their Commitment to Brahmanism 

Nor is it the case that royal devotion to the Buddha in eastern India dur ing this period weakened in this region the traditional commitment of Indian rulers to the imposition and preservation of the caste-based brahmanical social order in which Saivism was embedded. For in the Neulpur grant of the Bhauma- ´ Kara king Subh ´ akara I his grandfather Ks ¯ .emankara is described both as a Bud- ˙ dhist and as having ensured that the members of the caste-classes and disci plines observed their prescribed roles;251 in his Terun. d.ia copper-plate inscription ¯ Subh ´ akara II, the grandson of ¯ Subh ´ akara I, is given the epithet ¯ paramasaugatah. yet is also commended for having ‘propagated the system of uncommingled caste classes and disciplines proper to the [perfect] Kr.ta Age following the unexcelled [brahmanical] scriptures’;252 the Pala Dharmap ¯ ala is described in a grant of his ¯ son Devapala both as a ¯ paramasaugatah. and as taking measures to ensure that castes that erred were made to adhere to their respective duties, thereby dis charging his father’s debt to his deceased ancestors;253 and Vigrahapala III is ¯

described in his Am¯. gachi copper-plate as the support of the four caste-classes. ¯254 Moreover, most of the surviving inscriptions of the Palas, Candras, and Bhauma- ¯ Karas record grants which they made in favour of Brahmins. The Ramp ¯ al copper- ¯ plate grant of the Candra Sr´¯ıcandra strikingly exhibits the extent to which this double allegiance was unproblematic for such Buddhist donors. Following a prac tice widely attested in non-Buddhist donative inscriptions the gift of land is said to have been made over to its brahmin recipient after the pouring of water and the performance of a fire-sacrifice, in this case a kot.ihomah..255 This is simply adapted to the donor’s faith by dedicating the offerings to the Buddha rather than to Siva or Vis ´.n. u.256 

It seems, then, that royal patronage, reflecting no doubt the balance of alle giance in the wider population, ensured that Buddhism, for all the liberal sup port it received from the Palas, was in no position to oust or diminish ¯ Saivism, ´ even in this region. The monasteries themselves reflect this symbiosis. The excavations at Somapura revealed an abundance of non-Buddhist deities, par ticularly Siva, among the stone relief sculptures around the base of the central ´ temple and the very numerous terracotta plaques that decorated its walls.257

Joint Patronage of Buddhism and Saivism in the Kingdoms of the Khmers, ´ Chams, and Javanese 

Much the same phenomenon can be seen in Southeast Asia among the Khmers, the Chams, and the Javanese. Among the first the dominant religion was Saivism until the rise of the Therav ´ ada that accompanied the decline of ¯ Angkor, and Tantric Buddhism, even when it enjoyed short periods of promi nence through exceptionally determined royal patronage, found itself bound, as I have shown elsewhere, to accommodate its rival.259 

In the kingdoms of the Chams, speakers of an Austronesian language who inhabitated the plains along the coast of the South China Sea in what is now the central part of Vietnam, most of the inscriptions that have survived, in Sanskrit and Old Cham, ranging in time from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries, record acts of royal piety to Siva or to goddesses identified with his consort. There ´ are also a few from the ninth and tenth centuries that record the installation of Tantric Mahay¯ anist Loke ¯ svaras, the construction of associated Vih ´ aras, and ¯ land-grants to these. But as in eastern India we find in these that single donors supported both religions. Indeed the situation is more striking here because in all but one case each of these inscriptions records a person’s practising both kinds of patronage, Buddhist and Saiva. ´ 260 Thus in the Bakul stele of 829 a Buddhist 

monk Sthavira Buddhanirvan¯ . a records that his father Samanta has donated two Viharas to the Buddha and two temples to ¯ Siva. ´ 261 The Dong Duong stele of 875 

records that King Jayendavarman alias Laks.m¯ındra enshrined a Laks.m¯ındra lokesvara and an associated Vih ´ ara, yet the bulk of this long inscription is de- ¯ voted to the praise of the Siva Bhadre ´ svara, who, we are told, is the source of this ´ dynasty’s power and prosperity.262 The Nhan-bieu stele records that in 908 Pov

This co-ordination of the two faiths is also evident in eastern Java. The ‘Cal cutta’ stone inscription of Airlangga (c. 1010–1050), founder of the kingdom of Kahuripan, reports in its Old Javanese section that he was consecrated as the king in 1019/20 by Buddhist (Saugata), Saiva (M ´ ahe ¯ svara), and Mah ´ abr ¯ ahman ¯ . a dignitaries;265 and much evidence of the simultaneous royal support of both Saivism and Buddhism during the Singhasari and Majapahit periods (1222– ´ 1292, 1293–c. 1500) is present in the Old Javanese poem N ¯agarakr.t ¯agama, also called De´sawarn. ana, completed in 1365 by Mpu Prapanca during the reign of ˜ Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit, consecrated as R ¯ ajasanagara (1350–1389). We ¯ learn from this work that both Saiva and Buddhist priests participated in pe- ´ riodic ceremonies for the benefit of the realm within the great courtyard in side the royal gate of the palace compound,266 that the administrative heads

The term used here is the Sanskrit pr ¯aya´scittam (8.3d: pr ¯aya´scitta ri k ¯alaning *´srawan. a [conj. PIGEAUD : grahan. a Cod.] phalgun. a makaphala hay waning sabh ¯uwana). The function of the ceremony, therefore, was expiatory: to cancel the effects of any errors, omissions, or excesses in observances and con duct during the period since the last performance. KERN, accepting the reading

(dharm ¯adhyaks. a) of these two communities had official quarters in the east and west to the south of the royal compound,267 and that his sovereign was dedicated 

grahan. a phalgun. a, took the occasion to be an eclipse during the month Phalgun ¯ . a. As PIGEAUD saw, this is implausible. He therefore proposed that grahan. a is an error for ´srawan. a ‘the month Sr´ avan ¯ . a’, making this ceremony bi-annual and not ing that the resulting timing coincides with that of the two major festivals of the Majapahit court (1960–63, vol. 2, pp. 21–22). A trace of this co-functionality has survived into modern times on the island of Bali, where there are both Saiva and ´ Buddhist priests (padanda), with the latter now forming a small minority, about 1 in 10 and less than twenty in all (HOOYKAAS 1973, pp. 5 and 8), which sometimes had a role in state-sponsored rituals (STUART-FOX 2002, PP. 324 AND 326)). 

267 N ¯agarakr.t ¯agama 12.5; PIGEAUD 1960–1963, vol. 4, p. 25. For a map showing the location of these quarters within the palace compound (kraton) see HALL 1996, p. 99. PIGEAUD claims (ibid.) that both are regularly mentioned in the preambles of the royal charters of Majapahit. This is so in the Decree Jaya Song of c. 1350, the Ferry Charter of 1358, and the undated Charter of Batur (PIGEAUD 1960–1963, vol. 1, pp. 104–114 [edition]; vol. 3, pp. 151–164 [transla tion]). They are named in the first after the ministers: the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas ( ´ dharmmadhyaks. a ring ka´sewan), Rajapar ¯ akrama, ¯ alias Dharma raja, and the Dharm ¯ adhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists (dharmmadhyaks. a ring kaso gatan) Ary ¯ adhir ¯ aja Kanakamuni, described as a master of the Buddha’s teach- ¯ ings and grammar (boddha´s ¯astraway ¯akaran. aparisam ¯apta). In the second the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists has become Nadendra, described in the same ¯ way (boddhatarkkawy ¯akaran. a´s ¯astraparisam ¯apta) and we learn that the second name Dharmaraja of the Dharm ¯ adhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas is his ´ n ¯ama pus. pap ¯ata, that is to say, the name he acquired during his initiation through the casting of a flower (pus. pap ¯atah.) in accordance with standard Saiva procedure (e.g. ´ Svacchanda tantra 4.62cd: pus. pap ¯atava´s ¯an n ¯ama k ¯arayet s ¯adhakasya tu ‘He should name the Sadhaka in accordance with the casting of the flower’; ¯ Br.hatk ¯alottara f. 91v4 : pus. pap ¯at ¯anus ¯aren. a sam.j ˜n ¯a *tatp ¯urvato [em. : tatp ¯atrato Cod.] hit ¯a ‘The [ele ment of the] name before that [such as -siva which indicates the initiate’s caste] ´ should be [given] in accordance with the casting of the flower’). In the third the Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists is Ary ¯ adhir ¯ aja [Kanakamuni], as in the first, de- ¯ scribed as a master of grammar and the [Buddhist] Tantras (wyakaran. atantrapari sam ¯apta), and that of the Saivas is ´ Arya Hars ¯.araja, described as a master of logic ¯ and grammar (ny ¯ayawyakaran. a´s ¯astraparisam ¯apta). They are mentioned along with a number of other learned men, six in the first, seven in the second, and five in the third, referred to as “teachers of Law and settlers of law suits” (dharmmapra wakta wyawah ¯arawicchedaka) in the first and second and as “settlers of law suits as valid or not” (ny ¯ay ¯any ¯ayawyawah ¯arawicchedaka) in the third. They are no doubt the officials referred to elsewhere as the Dharmopapattis (see here p.105). In the first they are (1) Siwan ´ atha, (2) Marman ¯ atha, (3) Smaran ¯ atha, (4) Jayasmara, (5) ¯ Agreswara, and (6) Mun ´ ¯ındra. In the second they are (1) Siwan ´ atha, (2) Agre ¯ swara, ´ (3) Jayasmara, (4) Widyan¯ atha, (5) ¯ Siw´ adhipa, (6) ¯ Sr´¯ıghana, and (7) Samataj¯ n˜ana. ¯ In the third they are (1) Marmanatha, (2) Smaran ¯ atha, (3) Mah ¯ an¯ atha, (4) a second ¯ Smaranatha, and (5) Agre ¯ swara. Mun ´ ¯ındra in the first and Sr´¯ıghana and Samata-¯ jn˜ ana in the second were Buddhists, a fact already evident from their names but ¯ confirmed by the charters’ reports of their fields of expert knowledge. We learn from the first charter that Siwan ´ atha, Smaran ¯ atha, and Agre ¯ svara were adher- ´ ents of the Bhairava sect (bhairawapaks. a), that is to say, S´ akta ¯ Saivas, and that ´

to the support of both religions (81.1–2). Moreover, in the opening verse of his poem he pays homage to him as Siva-Buddha in human form. ´ 268 Particularly striking are passages that report the deity-images or temples in which the souls of deceased kings had been installed. Ranggah Rajasa (r. 1222– ¯ 1227), was enshrined in two temples, one Saiva and and the other Buddhist, in a ´ single temple complex at Kangen˘ engan; ˘269 and both Saiva and Buddhist priests ´ were seated beside king Rajasanagara when he sat in audience after worship- ¯ ping here.270 Anus¯ .apati (r. 1227–1248) was installed in a Siva image at Kid ´. al;271 Vis.n. uvardhana (r. 1248–1268) in a Siva image at Waleri and a Buddha image ´ 

Marmanatha and Jayasmara were adherents of the Saura sect ( ¯ sorapaks. a), that is to say, Surya worshippers (see here p.58). The second and third charters do not ¯ specify the sects of the judges listed, so that the affiliations of Widyan¯ atha, ¯ Siw´ a-¯ dhipa, one of the two Smaranathas, and Mah ¯ an¯ atha are unknown. It is striking ¯ that these judicial boards included no Vais.n. avas. The absence of a representative of the R.s.i sect, often grouped with those of the Saivas and Buddhists as one of the ´ three principal denominations in Java (e.g. Arjunawijaya 28.1c: r.s.i ´saiwa sogata; Ku ˜njarakarn. a 22.3c: sang boddha´saiw ¯ars.ipaks. a), is not surprising. For its fol lowers were forest-dwelling hermits. The Ku ˜njarakarn. a associates them with the worship of the [Pa¯supata] ´ pa ˜ncaku´sika; see 23.1d: lwi glar sogata pa ˜ncabuddha r.s.i pa ˜ncaku´sika wiku ´saiwapa ˜ncaka; and TEEUW and ROBSON 1981, p. 26. See also SANDERSON 2005a, pp. 374–376. The creation of the post of a Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Buddhists and the inclusion of Buddhists on the judicial board were perhaps re cent developments. For the Sarwadharma charter issued in 1269 during the reign of Kr.tanagara (PIGEAUD 1960–1963, vol. 1, pp. 99–103 [edition]; vol. 3, pp. 143– 150) mentions only a Dharmadhyaks ¯ .a of the Saivas ( ´ Ac¯ arya ¯ Siwan ´ atha Tanutama: ¯ mpungku dharmmadhyaks. a ri ka´sewan d. ang ¯ac ¯aryya ´siwan ¯atha mapa ˜nji tanu tama) together with a board of five other Ac¯ aryas, Dharmadewa, Smaradahana, ¯ Smaradewa, another Siwan ´ atha, and Agraja, not one of whom has an obviously ¯ Buddhist name (plate 2, recto, ll. 4–7).

The Lord of the Mountain (´sr¯ıparwwatan ¯atha) addressed in this verse has been understood, im plausibly, as Siva. I am entirely persuaded by the evidence presented by S ´ UPOMO (1972; 1977, pp. 69–82) that it is the king that is intended in this and the opening verse of Mpu Tantular’s Arjunawijaya, where the Lord of the Mountain, in this case called Parwwatarajadewa, is identified as the physical manifestation of the ultimate ¯ reality that is the Buddha (1.1b: sang s ¯aks.¯at param ¯arthabuddha).

His initiation-name appears in the forms Jn˜ana ¯ sivavajra and Vajraj ´ n˜ ana ¯ siva in the ´ Sanskrit inscription (KERN 1910) on the lotus-cushion of an image of him self in the form of the Mantranaya deity Mahaks ¯ .obhya installed at Simpang in Surabaya in 1289 (vv. 12–13: ´sr¯ıj ˜n ¯ana´sivavajr ¯akhya´s cittaratnavibh ¯us. an. ah.| j ˜n ¯anara´smivi´suddh ¯a ˙ngas sam. bodhij ˜n ¯anap ¯aragah.k subhakty ¯a tam. pratis.t.h ¯apya svayam. p ¯urvam. pratis.t.hitam | ´sma´s ¯ane vuraren ¯amni mah ¯aks. obhy ¯anur ¯upatah.; 19d: vajraj ˜n ¯ana´siv ¯a + +).

timate co-existence of the two traditions is also apparent in the intertextuality of religious texts in Java, as has been demonstrated for the Saiva ´ J ˜n ¯anasiddh ¯anta and the Tantric Buddhist Sang hyang Kamah ¯ay ¯anikan and Kalpabuddha.279 It is also seen in the great frequency with which the Mahay¯ ana-Buddhist concept of ¯ emptiness (´s ¯unyat ¯a) is incorporated in Javanese Saiva sources through the inclu- ´ sion of the terms ´s ¯unya and ´s ¯unyat ¯a among those used to characterize the high est reality,280 in the readiness of the redactors of Saiva liturgies to supplement ´ sets of Saiva elements with Buddhist elements when they needed to make up a ´ total for the sake of the numerical correspondence,281 and in the fact that the Ku ˜njarakarn. a of the Buddhist Mpu D. usun the supreme Buddhist deity Vairo

Inside is a beautiful ´ Siva image ´ and above an image of Aks.obhya as (on?) its crown. Of there is no doubt’. On the significance of the Saiva-Buddhist fusion seen in Kr ´.tanagara in both inscriptions and literary works see HUNTER 2007. 

279 See SOEBADIO 1971, pp. 12–19 and 55–57 for evidence of this intertextuality; also for a general treatment of the co-existence of the two traditions in Java ZOETMUL DER in STOHR ¨ and ZOETMULDER 1968, pp. 262–314.

I consider it highly probable that these Sanskrit works are Javanese creations. Some of the verses can be found in Indian Saiva ´ sources: Wr.haspatitattwa 53 and Gan. apatitattwa 3 < Rauravas ¯utrasam. graha 7.5; J ˜n ¯anasiddh ¯anta 19.5 and and Gan. apatitattwa 43 < Kiran. a 1.23; Wr.haspatitattwa 7–10 < Sv ¯ayambhuvas ¯utrasam. graha 4.3–6. But these are surprisingly few, and the works contain several doctrinal elements that are alien to known Indian tra ditions. Moreover, the deviations from strict Sanskrit usage found in them seem to me not to be characteristic of the registers of the language seen in Indian Saiva ´ scriptural texts. The same is true of the frequent deviations from the correct form of the Anus.t.ubh in the second and fourth Padas: e.g. ¯ Gan. apatitattwa 1d, 16d, 48d, 49b, 49d, 54b, 54d, 55b, 59b, 59d; Mah ¯aj ˜n ¯ana 11d, 37b, 38d, 42b, 61b, 73b, 74b, 78b, 78d, 80d; Wr.haspatitattwa 3b, 6b, 6d, 12b, 20d, 23b, 24b, 25b, 63b, 72d. This is extremely rare in Indian Saiva texts. ´

cana is made to equate the divine pentads of the Saiva and [P ´ a¯supata] R ´ .s.i sects with the five Tathagatas, teaching this in the context of an assertion that he is ¯ the ultimate reality that assumes the form both of the Buddha and of Siva, ´ 282 and that it is because the followers of the three sects fail to understand this un differentiated ground that they dispute with each other for the pre-eminence of their respective Gods.283 The same idea is seen in the works of the Buddhist Mpu Tantular. In his Arjunawijaya he has the priest of a Buddhist temple-complex (boddhadharma) explain to Arjuna that its central diety Vairocana is one with Sada¯siva, that its four ancillary deities, the directional Tath ´ agatas Aks ¯ .obhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi, are one with Rudra, Brahm ¯ a, ¯ Mahadeva, and Vis ¯ .n. u respectively,284 that there is no distinction between the Buddha and Siva, ´ 285 and that therefore it is the king’s duty to support all three sects, the Buddhists, the Saivas, and the R ´.s.is.286 Later, in his Sutasoma, Mpu Tantular states that the Buddha and Siva are “different but one” ( ´ bhinneka tu 

nggal ika), the famous formula that has been adopted as its official national motto by the modern state of Indonesia, as two manifestations of the ultimate reality of the former.287

In the same manner, the reality that is Jina and the reality that is Siva are one; they ´ are different yet they are one, for there is no duality in the dharma”.

This reading is an error in my view. It does not accord with context, which requires that the two be the realities of the Buddha (jinatwa) and Siva ( ´´siwatattwa) respectively. As I understand it, the passage is saying that the Lord Buddha is both the Buddha

THE DEVELOPMENT OF TANTRIC BUDDHISM THROUGH THE ADOPTION AND ADAPTATION OF S´ AIVA AND S´ AKTA ¯ S´ AIVA MODELS 

The Parallel Repertoire of Rituals 

Now, this co-existence of Buddhism and Saivism under royal patronage was ´ surely facilitated by the fact that the form of Buddhism adopted and developed was one that had equipped itself not only with a pantheon of ordered sets of deities that permitted such subsumptive equations but also with a repertoire of Tantric ceremonies that parallelled that of the Saivas and indeed had mod- ´ elled itself upon it, offering initiation by introduction before a Man. d. ala in which the central deity of the cult and its retinue of divine emanations have been in stalled, and a system of regular worship animated by the principle of identifi cation with the deity of initiation (devat ¯aham. k ¯arah., devat ¯agarvah.) through the use of Mantras, Mudras, visualization, and fire-sacrifice ( ¯ homah.); and this was presented not only as a new and more powerful means of attaining Buddha-hood but also, as in the Saiva case, as enabling the production of supernatural ef- ´ fects (siddhih.) such as the averting of danger (´s ¯antih.), the harming of enemies (abhic ¯arah.), and the control of the rain (vars.¯apan. am and ativr.s.t.idh ¯aran. am), through symbolically appropriate inflections of the constituents of these proce dures. The latter is particularly important from the point of view of Buddhism’s relations with its royal patrons, since such rituals enabled it to match the Saivas ´ by promising kings more tangible benefits than the mere accumulation of merit through the support of the Buddha, his teaching, and the Sangha. We have seen ˙ an example of such ritual for the protection of the state in Taran ¯ atha’s report ¯ of the programme of Tantric fire-sacrifices performed at Vikramas´¯ıla under the direction of Buddhajn˜ana during the reign of Dharmap ¯ ala (r. ¯ c. 775–812) to en sure the longevity of the Pala dynasty; ¯288 we have another example in the case of K¯ırtipan. d.ita, a Mahay¯ ana-Buddhist scholar and Tantric expert who according to ¯ the Vat Sithor stele inscription became the Guru of the Khmer king Jayavarman V (r. 968–1001) and was engaged by him to perform frequent fire-sacrifices in the palace for the protection of the kingdom;289 and the Javanese Prapanca tells ˜ us that the purpose of king Kr.tanagara’s adherence to Tantric Buddhism was 

and Siva, whereas S ´ UPOMO’s reading makes Mpu Tantular espouse a doctrine of absolute equality between the two religions within a reality beyond both. This is intrinsically implausible in a Buddhist work. My reading makes his view exactly that expressed by Mpu D. usun in 23.4bcd of the Ku ˜njarakarn. a cited and translated above: “‘I, Vairocana, am embodied both as the Buddha and as Siva”. ´

to increase his people’s prosperity and the stability of his realm, and that its reward was the undiminished and undivided sovereignty (ekachattra) of his de scendants.290 

The adoption of the Saiva practice of Man ´. d. ala initiation created a further line of access to patronage and was propagated vigorously, as it was by the Saivas, as a means of the recruiting of social ´ elites both in the subcontinent and ´ beyond.291 Among the Buddhist Tantras at least two major texts teach rituals of initiation, or consecration (abhis.ekah.) as it is called in these sources, in which it is kings in particular and royalty in general that are envisaged as the pri mary initiands. These are the Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa and the Sarvadurgatipari- ´sodhanatantra.292 In the former this is so for the principal Kalpa of the text. In the latter it is characteristic of initiation into the secondary Man. d. alas of the four Great Kings and the ten Guardians of the Directions taught in the Uttarakalpa. The sections dealing with these Man. d. alas specify the king as the principal con secrand, teach little or no required subsequent practice, and promise benefits that apply principally to him, namely the protection of himself and his kingdom and the destruction of the kingdoms of his enemies. The monarch is not men tioned in the treatments of initiation given in the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi and Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, the two great Tantras that were translated into Chinese in the early eighth century to form the basis of the Way of Mantras there and in the Japanese Shingon and Tendai sects. But the ninth-century In dian authority Anandagarbha brings this aspect of the religion to the fore in his ¯ Sarvavajrodaya, an influential manual that sets out detailed practical guidance for the performance of the initiation ritual taught in the second of those texts but draws heavily on the more detailed treatment in the first. For when he teaches the preparation of the Man. d. ala he prescribes a range of sizes beginning with that appropriate for the initiation of the monarch. In his case each of the sides should measure one hundred or fifty cubits (about 40 and 20 metres), in the case of a feudatory (s ¯amantah.) or major feudatory (mah ¯as ¯amantah.) fifty or twenty-five, in the case of a wealthy merchant (´sres.t.h¯ı) or international trader (s ¯arthav ¯ahah.) twenty-five or half of that, and in the case of an ordinary practitioner (s ¯adhakah.)

The Mantranaya also followed the example of the Saivas by devising Tantric ´ ceremonies for patrons in the public domain: for the consecration (pratis.t.h ¯a) of temple images (pratim ¯a), paintings of deities on cloth (pat.ah.), manuscripts of sacred texts (pustakam), monasteries (vih ¯arah.), shrines (gandhakut.¯ı), Caityas, reservoirs (pus. karin. y ¯adi), gardens and the like (¯ar ¯am ¯adi). It also adapted the Saiva procedures for funerary initiation to produce a Tantric Buddhist funeral ´

294 The details of this wide repertoire of the rituals that a Tantric Buddhist offi ciant (Vajrac¯ arya) was called on to perform are set out in a number of man- ¯ uals that are closely comparable to the Paddhatis of the Saivas, notably the ´ Kriy ¯asam. grahapa ˜njik ¯a of Kuladatta (TANEMURA 2004b), the Vajr ¯aval¯ı of the great Abhayakaragupta of Vikrama ¯ s´¯ıla (1064–1125 according to the chronologi cal tables of Sum pa mkhan po Yes shes dpal ’byor [1704–1788]; works dated in the twenty-fifth, thirtieth, and thirty-seventh years of the reign of Ramap ¯ ala ¯ [c. 1072–1126]; Vajr ¯aval¯ı written before the first of these; see BUHNEMANN ¨ and TACHIKAWA 1991, pp. xiv–xvi), which adds procedures for the consecration of reser voirs, gardens, and the like (A, f. 2r1 in the list of topics: pratim ¯adipratis.t.h ¯a | pus. karin. y ¯adipratis.t.h ¯a | ¯ar ¯am ¯adipratis.t.h ¯a), and the Ac ¯aryakriy ¯asamuccaya ¯ of Mahaman ¯ . d. alac¯ arya Jagaddarpan ¯ . a, which incorporates much of the Vajr ¯aval¯ı but adds some new material, notably a final section on the funeral ritual for a de ceased Vajrac¯ arya ( ¯ nirvr.tavajr ¯ac ¯ary ¯antyes.t.ilaks. an. avidhih.; B, ff. 240v7–244v4), which is an unacknowledged incorporation of the whole of the Mr.tasugatiniyojana of Pan. d.ita S´unyasam ¯ adhivajra (less its two colophonic verses). One other text giv- ¯ ing a Tantric funeral procedure survives in Sanskrit, the Antasthitikarmodde´sa, at the end (ff. 15r8–15v11) of the Guhyasam ¯aja-based Man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Man. d. alac¯ arya Padma ¯ sr´ ¯ımitra of the Khasarpan. a monastery (f. 15v10–11: sam ¯apt ¯a ca man. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a | kr.tir iyam. khasarpan.¯ıyaman. d. al ¯ac ¯aryapadma´sr¯ımitrasya). On these texts and the incorporation of the Mr.tasugatiniyojana by Jagaddarpan. a see TANEMURA 2004a and 2007. On the Saiva prototype of funerary initiation see ´ SANDERSON 1995a, pp. 31–33 and, for its adaptation, the Mr.toddh ¯arad¯ıks.¯a, in which a simulacrum is substituted for the body of the deceased, 2005b, pp. 264–267. A fourteenth-century Paddhati for this Mr.toddh ¯arad¯ıks.¯a survives in ff. 88v1–91r1 of the Gurupustik ¯a of the Kashmirian Raj¯ anaka ¯ Sitikan ´.t.ha. In an earlier publi cation (SANDERSON 2007a, p. 395, fn. 549) I proposed that this work, then known to me only indirectly from the R ¯aj ¯anakavam.´sapra´sam.s ¯a of his patrilineal descen dant Raj¯ anaka ¯ Ananda, who reports that it was composed at the request of [king] ¯ Sam. gramasim ¯ . ha, might be preserved in a S´ arad ¯ a manuscript listed with this ti- ¯ tle as belonging to the Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Central Library of the Banaras Hindu University (MS CN. 4115). I can now report that this is indeed a manuscript of that work and, as far as I am aware, its codex unicus.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, the Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa, and Buddhaguhya 

That this transformation of the Mahay¯ ana had been achieved by absorbing ¯ and adapting non-Buddhist practices was evident from the beginning. For the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, our first major Buddhist Tantra,298 later classified as the principal work of the Caryatantra class, was conscious that it would be ¯ accused of just this: 

O [Vajrapan¯ .i,] Lord of the Yaks.as, in time to come there will arise people of in ferior understanding and no faith who will not believe this teaching. They will dissent and have many doubts. They will hear it but they will not take it to heart and they will refuse to put it into practice. Being themselves unworthy they will bring others too to ruin. [For] they will say that this is not the teaching of the Buddhas but belongs to the outsiders.299

Then concentrating his mind he should cause the shin ing consciousness that he has installed in the heart [of the corpse] to be driven [up from the heart] by blazing wind-fanned Vajra-points and he should visualize it rising to liberation or a pure Buddha-field through the upper [aperture], like [a drop of] quick silver touched by tongues of fire’. The ‘upper’ is one of nine aper tures through which consciousness can leave the body at death (utkr ¯antih.). It is located at the top of the head and is called ‘the golden door’ (kanakadv ¯aram) by Bhavabhat.t.a in his commentary on the Catus. p¯ıt.hatantra (Catus. p¯ıt.hanibandha), f. 52r2: urdhve ¯ ti kanakadv ¯aren. a yad ¯a gacchati tad ¯a maran.¯ad ¯urdhvam.´s¯ıghram eva gater gatyantaram. vi´sis.t.am. gacchati. The point of exit depends upon the destiny of the deceased. This is the best. According to S´unyasam ¯ adhivajra consciousness that ¯ exits at death through this aperture goes to the Immaterial World (¯ar ¯upyadh ¯atuh.): ´siras ¯ar ¯upyam. gacchet (f. 3r4). This idea that consciousness may leave the body through various exits in accordance with its destiny is found widely in Brahmani cal sources. Early Buddhist sources speak rather of consciousness ceasing at death at these points in the body; see Abhidharmako´sabh ¯as. ya on 3.43abc. Vasubandhu says there that in the case of Arhats their consciousness disappears in the heart according to some and in the head according to others: arhantah.| tes.¯am api hr.daye vij ˜n ¯anam. nirudhyate | m ¯urdhn¯ıty apare.

The Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa, another early Buddhist Tantric text,300 assigned to the lowest class of Mantranaya texts, known as the Kriyatantras, is more ¯ explicit in this regard; and it has good reason to be so since it contains in its chapters 47–49 an assimilated version of the cult of Tumburu and his four sis ters, that is to say, the cult of the v ¯amasrotah. division of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha, describing the Mantras of these deities as the highest and most secret of all the non-Buddhist (laukika-) Mantras.301 Moreover, it teaches that any of the 

300 The date of this text is obscure. MATSUNAGA (1985) is of the opinion that the 9th chapter, on applications of the Ekaks ¯ .aramantra, was in existence before the Chinese translations T. 1181 of A.D. 702 and T. 1182 of A.D. 703. He also in forms us (ibid.) that the first ninety percent of the Chinese translation of the Garud. apat.alaparivarta (T. 1276), produced at some time between 746 and 774, is identical with the first sixty percent of the 41st chapter of the Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa as edited. The translation is attributed to Amoghavajra (705–774), but MAT SUNAGA observes (ibid.) that only the first part of the common text is in keeping with his other translations, the latter part containing elements such as human hair, beef, and skull-cups, which taken together are altogether alien to his Mantranaya. He strengthens the hypothesis that only the first part of this translation is by Amoghavajra with the evidence of the Go-sh¯orai mokuroku, a catalogue of the Bud dhist texts brought from China to Japan by Kukai in 806, which lists this text as oc- ¯ cupying three sheets, a third of the length of T. 1276. The prophetic history of Indian Buddhism, the R ¯ajavy ¯akaran. a, chapter 53 of the published Maju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa, cannot be earlier that the late eighth century since it knows of the Pala king Gop ¯ ala ¯ (r. c. 750–775) (53.628; and 53.816: tatah. paren. a *bh ¯up ¯alo gop ¯alo [em. : bh ¯up ¯al ¯a gop ¯al ¯a Ed.] d ¯asaj¯ıvinah.| bhavis. yati). Since it does not mention his successor Dharmapala it is unlikely to be later. ¯ 

301 Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa, introductory prose before 47.1: sarvalaukikamantr ¯an.¯am. s ¯arabh ¯utatamam. paramarahasyam.. The position within Saivism assigned by this ´ text to the cult of the four sisters suggests that, though later largely eclipsed by other traditions of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha, it was once pre-eminent; and this is also cir cumstantial evidence in favour of the hypothesis proposed above (p. 50) that this cult was one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest, of the esoteric Saiva systems. ´ There is certainly much other evidence of its early centrality. As we have seen, it was known to Dharmak¯ırti (here p. 50), and a 6th-century manuscript of one of its texts survives amid the otherwise Buddhist Gilgit manuscripts (here p. 50). The Vis.n. udharmottara shows knowledge of only two Saiva deity-systems in its ´ section on iconography: the Saiddhantika and this (3, ¯ Adhy ¯aya 66, teaches the iconography of Tumburu and his sisters). The Advaitin Sa´ nkara in his ˙ G¯ıt ¯abh ¯as. ya on Bhagavadg¯ıt ¯a 9.25, in which it is said that those who worship the Spirits (bh ¯utejy ¯ah.) reach the Spirits (bh ¯ut ¯ani y ¯anti) [when they die], glosses bh ¯ut ¯ani as vin ¯ayakam ¯atr. gan. acaturbhaginy ¯ad¯ıni ‘such as Vinayaka, the Mothers, and the Four ¯ Sisters’. On his date, probably eighth century, see HARIMOTO 2006. These deities were also incorporated in the traditions of Man. d. alas of the Nayas ¯utra and the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi that reached the Far East in the eighth century (see SANDERSON 2001, p. 8, fn. 5). Their cult was the basis of the Saiva ritual performed ´ to inaugurate the kingdom of Angkor at the beginning of the ninth century (ibid. and 2005a, pp. 355–358); and there too, where the Mantramarga was preserved in ¯ an early form, we see only the Siddhanta of its earliest texts and this cult. This ¯ co-existence is also evident in the Saiva liturgies of Java and Bali, which are of ´ Saiddhantika character but incorporate these deities (see G ¯ OUDRIAAN 1973 and

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Mantra-procedures taught in the Saiva and G ´ arud ¯ . a Tantras302 will be effec tive if applied by Buddhists in the Man. d. ala of these converted deities.303 Thus the Buddhists envisaged by this text have the whole array of Saiva Mantras ´ at their disposal; and this position, so surprising from the conventional Bud dhist standpoint, is justified by the claim that what people have come to refer to as the Saiva, G ´ arud ¯ . a, and indeed Vais.n. ava Tantras are in fact Buddhist, since they were first taught by Manju ˜ sr´ ¯ı in this “vast Kalpa”, that is to say, in the Ma ˜nju´sriyam ¯ulakalpa or, more probably, in a hypothetical proto-text of which the actual text was thought to be an abbreviated redaction:304 

I have taught this Mantra [of Siva] which together with the trident Mudr ´ a¯ destroys all demons, out of my desire to benefit living beings. Those living on the earth will say that its ancient Kalpa, that I taught in former times, was taught by Siva. [But] the various excellent extensive [Kalpas] in the ´ Saiva Tantras are ´ in fact my teachings. 

. . . 

The extensive Kalpas that have been related in the Vais.n. avas Tantras were taught by Manjughos ˜ .a for living beings who could only be trained by [this] device.305 

. . . 

All the extensive Kalpas taught in the Garud ¯ . a Tantras were taught by me in order to benefit living beings.306 

. . . 

It was I that first taught, in this vast Kalpa, everything that the inhabitants of earth without exception refer to as the teaching of Siva. It was only later ´ that others taught in the various texts [considered to be taught by him] the Kalpamantras of the wise Siva Tumburu the Trader. ´ 307

If this is so, then the text has disarmed criticism that the Mantra-procedures that are presented as properly Buddhist in this text bear a suspiciously close re semblance to the non-Buddhist in their liturgical morphology. For if the Omni scient has revealed all forms of religion in consideration of the differing mental dispositions of his manifold audiences, then there is no reason at all why he should not in his wisdom have taught Tantric practice for Buddhists as well as for outsiders. The strict division between the Buddhist and the non-Buddhist has dissolved within a higher Buddhist intertextual unity. Indeed this very ar gument is deployed by *Buddhaguhya in the late eighth century in his commen tary on the passage of the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi cited above.308 He argues that what those who attack this Tantra for containing elements proper to the non-Buddhist Tantras fail to realize is that those Tantras too were taught by the omniscient Buddha.309 So it follows that there nothing inherently un-Buddhist in

308 *Buddhaguhya’s teaching in the Kriya- and Cary ¯ a- divisions of the Tantras is said ¯ by Gzhon nu dpal (Blue Annals, p. 351) to have been pre-eminent in Tibet dur ing the first transmission of Esoteric Buddhism, from the latter half of the eighth century; and this is confirmed by the Tibetan inventory of Buddhist texts in trans lation compiled in the Ldan dkar palace in the early ninth century. Its small sec tion of Tantras (gsang sngags kyi rgyud: entries 316–328) consists of nine texts of this class together with commentaries on the last four, of which three are ascribed to our author, those on the Vairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, the Sarvadurgatipari´sodhana tejor ¯ajakalpa, and the Dhy ¯anottara. The entry on the fourth commentary, that on the Sub ¯ahu[paripr.cch ¯a], lacks the name of its author, but it is at least probable that it was from the same hand, since no other Indian commentary on this text is known. The loss of the Sanskrit originals of these and other works of early exegesis has left us without the means of confirming that his name, rendered Sangs rgyas gsang ba in Tibetan, was indeed Buddhaguhya, as modern scholarship has gener ally assumed. The evidence is inconclusive. For when the name appears in Tibetan sources in transcription rather than translation we find sometimes Buddhaguhya and sometimes Buddhagupta. We see the latter in the Ldan dkar inventory (LALOU 1953, p. 326: slob dpon Bu ddha gu pta) and both forms are found in the colophons of the translations of his works in the Tenjur (HODGE 1994, p. 70). The Tenjur con tains a letter (Toh. 4194) in which *Buddhaguhya addresses the Tibetan emperor ¯ Khri srong lde btsan, who ruled from c. 756 until c. 797 (DOTSON 2007) and offi cially adopted Buddhism c. 779. From it we learn that he was invited to Tibet by Khri srong lde btsan but declined the invitation on the grounds of failing strength, sending instead his commentary on the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Buddhist Tantric practice, however closely it may resemble the Saiva; and Bud- ´ dhists, therefore, once they have understood this fact, may devote themselves with full confidence to the rituals of the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi. 

The Sarvatath ¯agatattvasam. graha and the First Inroads of S ¯akta ´ Saivism: Pos- ´ session, Goddesses, and the Sacralization of Sex 

After the time of this text Tantric Buddhism did not, as one might expect, rest content with the degree of assimilation of Saivism it had already achieved, ´

[The Buddha] has taught [here] that the colour of the Man. d. alas should be the same as those of [their presiding] deities. But some will say that the Man. d. alas of ¯Isvara and of fire and the rest are ´ found in the mundane Tantras [of the outsiders] and not at all in the supramun dane Tantras [of Buddhism, that is to say,] in the Kriyatantras or Cary ¯ atantras, ¯ and that therefore they were not taught by the Buddha, [doing so] because they do not understand that the Blessed omniscient Buddha, in conformity with the various faiths of living beings, also taught [these] mundane Tantras’. This doc trine that all teaching is the Buddha’s, that he has taught variously in the appear ance of the Buddha, Siva, and others, is set out in the ´ Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi in a passage that survives in Sanskrit through its citation in the N ¯amamantr ¯a rth ¯avalokin¯ı, Vilasavajra’s eighth-century commentary on the ¯ N ¯amasam. g¯ıti, on verse 42, f. 31v1–32r2: tath ¯a coktam.´sr¯ıvairocan ¯abhisam. bodhitantre | bhaga vantas tath ¯agat ¯a arhantah.samyaksam. buddh ¯ah.sarvaj ˜naj ˜n ¯anam. pr ¯apya tat sarva j ˜naj ˜n ¯anam.sarvasattvebhyo vibhajya n ¯an ¯anayair n ¯an ¯abhipr ¯ayair n ¯anop ¯ayanayair dharmam. de´sayanti sma | kes.¯am.cit ´sr ¯avakay ¯ananayam. kes.¯am.cit pratyekabuddha y ¯ananayam. kes.¯am.cin mah ¯ay ¯ananayam. kes.¯am.cit pa ˜nc ¯abhij ˜naj ˜n ¯ananayam. kes.¯am. cid devopapattaye kes.¯am.cin manus. yopapattaye y ¯avan mahoragayaks. ar ¯aks. as ¯a suragandharvagarud. akinnar ¯adyupapattaye dharmam. de´sayanti sma | tatra ke cit sattv ¯a buddhavaineyik ¯a buddhar ¯upen. a pa´syanti. ke cic chr ¯avakar ¯upen. a ke cit pratyekabuddhar ¯upen. a ke cid bodhisattvar ¯upen. a ke cin mahe´svarar ¯upen. a ke cid brahmar ¯upen. a ke cin n ¯ar ¯ayan. ar ¯upen. a pa´syanti sma | ke cid vai´sravan. a r ¯upen. a y ¯avan mahoragamanus. y ¯amanus. yar ¯upen. a pa´syanti sma | svakasvakair vacanod ¯ah ¯aran. anayair vividhery ¯apatha<m. > vyavasthitam | tac ca sarvaj ˜naj ˜n ¯anam ekarasam. yad uta tathat ¯avinirmuktirasam ity ¯aha mah ¯avairocana iti. This is closely related to and probably derives from the vaineyadharmopade´sah., the eighth Prakaran. a of the second Nirvy ¯uha of the K ¯aran. d. avy ¯uha (pp. 268–269). The Sad dharmapun. d. ar¯ıka likewise teaches (pp. 251–252) that Avalokitesvara assumes all ´ kinds of forms, including that of Siva, in order to teach living beings in considera- ´ tion of their particular dispositions. STRICKMANN informs us (1996, p. 440, n. 28) that this passage is present in the Chinese translation completed by Dharmaraks.a in A.D. 286. It is probable that it is the model of the passage in the K ¯aran. d. avy ¯uha. The doctrine that the non-Buddhist teachers are a device (up ¯ayah.) of the Buddha is also taught in the fourth chapter of the Bodhisattvagocarop ¯ayavis. ayavikurvan. a nirde´sas ¯utra, which survives in two Chinese translations, the first by Gun. abhadra in the fifth century; see ZIMMERMANN 2000, p. 18.

working only to infuse the new liturgical system with ever more clearly Buddhist purpose and meaning. On the contrary, with the Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, the next major Tantra, which was considered to be the foundational text of the Yogatantra class, which follows the Caryatantras in the ascending hierarchy of ¯ the classification of the Mantranaya, and was in existence in a shorter version by the end of the seventh century and expanded in the course of the eighth,310 we find the beginning of a process of assimilation of S´ akta ¯ Saiva language, practices, ´ iconography, and concepts that would become ever more comprehensive through out the rest of the Mantranaya’s creativity. Here we find for the first time the requirement that candidates enter a state of possession (¯ave´sah.) at the time of their initiation. This feature, which is altogether alien to antecedent Buddhism, is the hallmark of initiation in the Saiva Kaula systems, setting them apart from ´ all others.311 The Vajrac¯ arya puts the candidate into a state of possession, has ¯ 

310 See MATSUNAGA 1978, pp. xvii–xvii. 

311 See, e.g., Tantr ¯aloka 29.186c–220; Tantr ¯alokaviveka introducing 29.201c–202b: sam ¯ave´sah.sarva´s ¯astres. v avig ¯anenoktah.; SANDERSON 1985, pp. 200–202; 1986, p. 169 and fn. 2; and WALLIS 2008. The centrality of possession in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva do- ´ main may derive from its Kap¯ alika antecedents, since the Saiddh ¯ antika ¯ Saivas re- ´ port that the Kap¯ alikas [of the Atim ¯ arga] defined liberation as arising from a state ¯ of possession (¯ave´sah.) by the qualities of the deity, analogous to the state of one who is possessed by a Bhuta ( ¯ bh ¯ut ¯avis.t.apurus. avat [Nare´svarapar¯ıks.¯aprak ¯a´sa on 1.61]); see, e.g., Paus. karabh ¯as. ya, p. 232: svayam ¯avi´syate siddhah. purus. as tu gra hair iva | ittham.caiva tu k ¯ap ¯al ¯as tat s ¯amyam. muktim ¯ucire; and Saivaparibh ¯as ´.¯a, p. 156, ll. 22-24: k ¯ap ¯alik ¯ah.sam ¯ave´sena s ¯amyam upagacchanti | tath ¯a hi yath ¯a grah ¯ah. purus. am ¯avi´santi tathe´svaragun.¯a muktes. v ¯avi´santi. They are distinguished in this context from the two other Atimargic traditions, those of the P ¯ a¯nc˜ arthika ¯ Pa¯supatas, who defined liberation as the transference of the state of equality with ´ Siva in the manner in which one lamp is lit from another ( ´ s ¯amyasam. kr ¯antiv ¯adah.), and the Lakulas, who defined it as the arising of this state ( ¯ s ¯amyotpattiv ¯adah.); see SANDERSON 2006, pp. 179–181. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that possession by the deity as the goal of practice is a marked feature of the Picumata and Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha, texts in which the perpetuation within the Mantramarga of the K ¯ ap¯ alika tradition of the Atim ¯ arga is particularly clear. Both ¯ describe the goal of their Kap¯ alika-style asceticism as the entry of the deity pro- ¯ pitiated into the person of the propitiator.

him cast a flower on to the Man. d. ala to determine from the section on which it falls the Mantra-deity from which he will obtain Siddhi, and then, while he is still in this state, removes his blindfold to reveal the Man. d. ala. He then conse crates him with scented water from a Mantra-empowered vase, places a Vajra in his hand, and gives him his initiation-name (vajran ¯ama).312 The immediate effects of the possession are described as follows:313 

As soon as he becomes possessed supernatural knowledge arises [in him]. Through this knowledge he understands the thoughts of others; he knows all matters past, future and present; his heart becomes firm in the teachings of the Tathagatas; all his sufferings cease; he is free from all dangers; no being ¯ can kill him; all the Tathagatas enter-and-empower him; all Siddhis approach ¯ him; unprecedented joys arise [in him], causing spontaneous delight, pleasure, and happiness. In some these joys give rise to meditation-states, in some to [the mastery of] Dharan ¯ .¯ıs, in some to the fulfilment of every hope, and in some to the state of identity with all the Tathagatas. ¯

The Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara requires any one who has gone through its initiation ceremony and then received consecra tion (abhis.ekah.) to adopt one of three forms of ascetic observance in order to gain mastery over the Vidya ( ¯ vidy ¯avratam): the Bhairavavrata, the Camun ¯ . d. avrata, or ¯ the Tris.as.t.ikulavrata, the observance of the sixty-three families [of the Mothers], which it also calls the Kap¯ alavrata, i.e. the K ¯ ap¯ alika.

and, after the bindfold has been removed:314 

As soon as he sees the Great Man. d. ala he is entered-and-empowered by all the Tathagatas and Vajrasattva dwells in his heart. He sees various visions of ¯ orbs of light and miraculous transformations. Because he has been entered and-empowered by all the Tathagatas sometimes the Lord Vajradhara or the ¯ Buddha appears to him in his true form. From that time forth he attains all his goals, every desire of his mind, all Siddhis, up to the state of Vajradhara or the Tathagatas. ¯ 

Anandagarbha gives a detailed account of the means by which the candidate ¯ is put into this state of possession in the Sarvavajrodaya, his manual on the rites of initiation into the Man. d. ala of this Tantra, and makes it clear that entering this state is, as in the Kaula parallel, an absolute requirement. If the candidate fails to enter it by the standard means, the Vajrac¯ arya is to perform a rite to remove ¯ the sins that are assumed to be the cause, and if the candidate still fails to enter the possession state, he may not proceed further:315 

If possession does not occur, because [the candidate] has committed [too] many sins, he should proceed to destroy those sins by repeatedly making the Sin Destruction Mudra. With concentrated mind he should kindle a fire with sticks ¯ of sweet wood and burn all his sins by casting into it oblations of sesame seeds with the Mantra OM. SARVAPAPADAHANAVAJR ¯ AYA SV ¯ AH¯ A¯. He should make a simulacrum of those sins with black sesame seeds on the palm of his right hand and visualizing the [wrathful] syllable HUM¯.in the centre he should offer it into the fire with his index finger and thumb. Then he should imagine that the sin is being incinerated in his body by Vajras wrapped in flames emerging from the fire-pit. [The candidate] will definitely become possessed. If possession does not occur even so, then he must not give him the consecration.316

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

It is certain that the possession intended is not nominal or figurative. For Anandagarbha tells us that once the Vajr ¯ ac¯ arya is sure that the candidate is in ¯ this state he should use him as an oracle:317 

Then when the Ac¯ arya has ascertained that [the candidate] is possessed he should ¯ form the Samayamudra of Vajrasattva and address him with [the Mantras] ¯ HE VAJRASATTVA HE VAJRARATNA HE VAJRADHARMA HE VAJRAKARMA and NR. TYA SATTVA NR. TYA VAJRA (DANCE, O SATTVA; DANCE, O VAJRA). If he is indeed possessed he will adopt the Vajrasattvamudra. Then the ¯ Ac¯ arya should show the ¯ 

Mudra of the Vajra Fist. By this means all the deities beginning with Vajrasattva ¯ make themselves present [in him]. Then he should ask him something that he wishes [to ascertain], with the following [procedure]. He should visualize a Vajra on the tongue of the possessed and say SPEAK, O VAJRA. [The candidate] then tells him everything [that he wishes to know].318 

means he should visualize him being burned both internally and externally by the Power [of the Mantra] taught above. By this means he will fall to the ground. If a person does not achieve [the state of possession] even by this means then in this [system] he must cast him aside like a stone’. Falling to the ground is commonly mentioned in Kaula texts as the consequence of initiatory possession; see, e.g., Matas ¯ara f. 39v2–3: y ¯avanm ¯atram. vihvalam.ca vedhayet p ¯a´sapa ˜njaram | p ¯a´sastobh ¯at pataty ¯a´su bh ¯utale n ¯atra sam.´sayah.; Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 4, bhairav ¯anan ¯avidhau bh ¯umik ¯apat.alah., f. 191v (v. 105ab): ´saktiks. obh ¯at tad ¯a yog¯ı viddho patati bh ¯utale; Dev¯ıdvyardha´satik ¯a f. 16v: 197 tatks. an.¯at patate bh ¯umau chinnam ¯ula iva drumah.; Chumm ¯asam. ketaprak ¯a´sa, first surviving verse: [ta]ddr. kp ¯atamahoday ¯at | bh ¯umau sampatitah. ks.ipr ¯ac chinnam ¯ula iva drumah.; Urmikaul ¯arn ¯. ava f. 9r3: *pa ˜nc ¯avasth ¯agatah.(em. : pa ˜nc ¯avasvagatah.

318 The inducing of possession in persons so that they may be used as oracles, is not restricted in Tantric Buddhism to the context of initiation. It is also seen as an independent procedure in which the medium is a young boy or girl. We find it in the Tantra Sub ¯ahuparipr.cch ¯a in a section partly translated and partly paraphrased from the Chinese by STRICKMANN (1996, pp. 222–226), a work that was translated 

[[136]]

into Chinese (T. 895) by Subh ´ akarasim ¯ . ha in 726 and was in the hands of the Chinese monk Wu-xing in 674 (HODGE 2003, p. 18). We also see it in the Su ji li yan mo xi shou luo dian shuo jia lu luo a wei she fa ‘The quickly effective method of possession (¯ave´sah.) taught by the god Mahesvara’ (T. 1277). This short scriptural text, whose ´ translation from the Sanskrit is assigned to Bukong (Amoghavajra) and to a date between 746 and 774, claims in its preamble that it is a teaching given by Siva ´ (Mahesvara) to N ´ ar¯ ayan ¯ . a on Mt. Gandhamadana in answer to the latter’s request. ¯ It sets forth a procedure to induce the messenger (Duta) of Mahe ¯ svara to possess a ´ young girl aged seven or eight so that he can then use her while she is in this state to answer any questions he has concerning the future. He should have her fast by eating nothing but pure foods for three or seven days. Then on an auspicious day he bathes her, anoints her with unguents, gives her clean clothes, puts camphor in her mouth, sits facing East, smears a low wooden platform with sandalwood-paste, has the girl stand on it, scatters flowers in front of her, sets up a vessel of Argha water, takes incense, empowers it seven times with the Mahamudr ¯ amantra, lights ¯ the incense and fumigates the girl’s hands with it, takes a red flower, empowers it, places it in her hands, and passes his hands over her face. Then, with his hand forming a Mudra he touches and thus empowers five parts of his own body and then ¯ with the same Mudra touches the girl’s head, her mouth, his heart, and his navel ¯ visualizing in these the symbols of fire, water, earth, and wind respectively. He then empowers his two legs, visualizes Garud. a, puts the armour-Mantra on the girl’s body, and visualizes himself as Mahesvara, three-eyed, with the digit of the moon ´ on his crown, blue-faced, eighteen-armed, and brandishing various weapons, with a snake as his sacred thread, wearing the bleeding hide of an elephant. He then protects her with recitation, empowers flowers, incense, and Argha water with the Mahamudr ¯ amantra, and seals the ten directions. Then facing the girl the S ¯ adhaka ¯ recites the Mantra of Mahesvara’s D ´ uta. The girl will start to tremble. This reveals ¯ to him that the Duta has entered her. He then snaps his fingers and recites the ¯ Mantra. If she does not fall into the possession trance he should recite a further Mantra to incite the Duta to enter her. By this means the result is certain. He then ¯ interrogates her about good and bad in the future and is told whatever he wishes to know. This account is based on an oral translation of the Chinese text very kindly provided by my colleague NOTAKE Miyako (Leipzig). A French translation of part of the text, without the visualizations, is given in H ¯ob¯ogirin, p. 7. 

Here too the model is Saiva, as the preamble and content of this text suggest. ´ Putting children into a possession-state is already present in the earliest liter ature of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga, where we find the use of Ks ¯ .atriya and brah min boys for this purpose; see Ni´sv ¯asatattvasam. hit ¯a f. 82v1–2 (Ni´sv ¯asaguhya 10.116–117b): ath ¯ave´sam. kartuk ¯a[mah.] + + ks. atrakum ¯arakam | sn ¯apayitv ¯a tam ekam.tu ´suddhadehah.sav ¯asakam k p ¯urv ¯amukham.sth ¯apayitv ¯a hy udaken ¯ave´sayet; f. 112v6 (Ni´sv ¯asaguhya 17.30): ath ¯ave´sam. kartuk ¯amo br ¯ahman. akum ¯ara[kam + u]dakena sn ¯apya tenaiva t ¯ad. yam ¯anam ¯ave´sayed v ¯acay ¯a moks. ah.. The ritual also appears in narrative literature. The Kath ¯asarits ¯agara (70.55–63) tells a story of an ash-smeared ascetic, a pupil of Suddhak ´¯ırti, who has mastered many Mantras and claims to have done this with a Ks.atriya boy (56cd: ´subhalaks. an. am ¯as ¯adya kam.cit ks. atrakum ¯arakam), who in his trance revealed the whereabouts of many miraculous herbs and elixirs (57: sa kum ¯arah.sam ¯avis.t.ah. pr.s.t.o n ¯an ¯avidh ¯an.i me | siddhaus. adhirasaks.etr ¯an. y ud¯ıryedam ath ¯abrav¯ıt), and, finally, a palace of the Nagas in a pollen-covered pond in the jungles of the Vindhya mountains, where, ¯ with the help of V¯ıras, he could obtain a sword that would make him lord of the Siddhas. The procedure is referred to there as a svasth ¯ave´sah.‘a [rite of caus-

[[138]]

the practioner must induce in himself in order to accomplish both his Siddhis and his enlightenment, typically in the compound vajr ¯ave´sah.‘possession by Vajra’. For example: 

For by means of possession by [Vajra]sattva enlightenment will quickly be at tained.319 

. . . 

When he has given rise to ¯ave´sah.in this way whatever form he meditates on as his own will automatically become Buddha in form.320 

. . . 

When vajr ¯ave´sah. has arisen he should visualize the water as an embodiment of the Vajra. Quickly achieving success he will be able to walk on [that] water.321 . . . 

Once he has generated vajr ¯ave´sah., if with concentrated mind he makes a slight clap with his palms in the Vajra¯njali [gesture] he can subject to his control even a ˜ mountain.322 

. . . 

Likewise, by virtue of the practice of ¯ave´sah., if he stretches out [his hands in] the Vajra gesture and strikes together the tips of his fingers he can kill a hundred families.323 

Two other features of this seminal text evidence the influence of S´ akta ¯ Saivism. The first is the fact that after teaching the Vajradh ´ atuman ¯ . d. ala in its opening section it goes on to teach the Vajraguhyaman. d. ala, in which the five Tathagatas are replaced by goddesses: Vairocana at the centre by Va- ¯ jradhatv ¯ ¯ısvar ´ ¯ı and, around her in the four directions, Aks.obhya by Vajravajrin.¯ı, Ratnasambhava by Ratnavajrin.¯ı, Amitayus by Dharmavajrin ¯ .¯ı, and Amogha siddhi by Karmavajrin.¯ı.324 In the preamble Vajrapan¯ .i makes the following joyous declaration (ud ¯anam):325 

Ah, how benevolent is the Bodhicitta to all beings! For the Buddhas take on even female form to accord with [the expectations of] their disciples (vineyava´s ¯at).

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The second is the incorporation of sexual intercourse into the activities of worship as a higher form of practice. This element is not conspicuous because it is not mentioned in the treatments of the principal Man. d. alas taught in the text and it was therefore easily pushed out of view when this text was propagated in China and thence in Japan. It is present nonetheless as an esoteric teach ing reiterated many times throughout the text in the form of passages teaching that the pleasure of sexual union and indeed other sensual delights are a means both of worshipping the Buddha and of attaining Siddhis when combined with meditation on one’s Buddha nature. For example: 

1: If after generating a firm intention to attain enlightenment he meditates on himself as the Buddha and worships himself [as the Buddha] with the pleasure of sexual intercourse he will obtain the joys of the Buddha himself. 

. . . 

2: He will quickly become equal to Vajrasattva if he presents the pleasures of em bracing the body of any [woman] as offerings to the Buddhas. He will be become equal to Vajraratna if he presents the pleasures of grasping [her] hair in intensely felt love as offerings to the Buddhas. He will become equal to Vajradharma if he presents the exquisite pleasures of kissing while immersed in intense sensual delight as offerings to the Buddhas. He will become the equal of Vajrakarma if during his worship he completely offers up to the Buddhas the pleasures of the union of the two sex organs. 

. . . 

3: He will attain success in the Man. d. ala by means of the union of the two sex or gans while meditating with fully concentrated mind on the meditation state that embodies all things. 

. . . 

4: Non-detachment from sensual pleasures: this is the greatest and purest rule of discipline [for an initiate] in the family of the Tathagatas. It may not be trans- ¯ gressed even by the Buddhas. 

. . . 

5: There is no religious duty purer than [the exercise of] sexual desire, the be stower of all joys. This, which brings about Siddhi, is the highest duty in the family of the Tathagatas. ¯ 

. . . 

6: During worship with the four prostrations he will quickly attain Siddhi if when exhausted from the exertion of love-making he offers [to the Buddhas] the plea sure which that love-making aroused. 

. . . 

7: He will attain Siddhi if while meditating with in-turned mind on the purity of lust he worships the Buddhas with the drops of his semen.326

The Guhyasam ¯aja: copulating deities, sexual initiation rites, and the sacraliza tion of impurity 

In the next phase of the Mantranaya, seen in the Guhyasam ¯aja, also a product of the eighth century, this esoteric eroticism has moved to the fore ground; and this is apparent from the very beginning of the text. For the place where the Buddha is said to have been residing at the time that he revealed this Tantra, which was expected to be stated in the preamble (nid ¯anav ¯akyam) of any scripture claiming to be Buddhist, is not one of the familiar sites of revelation such as Rajagr ¯ .ha, Dhanyakat ¯ .aka, or, as in the Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, the Akanis.t.ha heaven, but the vaginas of the goddesses Locana, M ¯ amak ¯ ¯ı, Pan¯ . d. aravasin ¯ ¯ı, and Tar¯ a, that is to say, a timeless, unlocated bliss: ¯327 

[I aver that] I once heard the following [teaching]. The Venerable Lord was re siding in the vaginas of the Vajra-women of the body, speech, and mind of all the Tathagatas . . . ¯ 

and this surprising relocation, no doubt provocatively shocking in its time, became standard in the subsequent literature of the Mantranaya, both in texts closely related to the Guhyasam ¯aja and in the next wave of texts, the Yogin¯ıtantras, in which the influence of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva tradition became much ´ more intense and pervasive.328

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In the Guhyasam ¯aja the male deities, now multi-faced and multi-armed in a fusion of Saiva and Buddhist iconography, are represented and visualized cop- ´ ulating with their consorts;329 and both initiation and subsequent practice now involve copulation with a female partner, as in the S´ aktism of the ¯ Saivas. ´ 330 A further borrowing from the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha is evident in the introduction of a cru cial element of what that tradition calls ‘non-dualistic practice’ (advait ¯ac ¯arah.) and both traditions call ‘practice free of inhibition’ (nih.´sa ˙nk ¯ac ¯arah.), namely the offering to the deities of such ‘impure’ substances as urine, faeces, semen, and blood, and their sacramental consumption.331

For the full iconog raphy of these pantheons see Nis. pannayog ¯aval¯ı A, pp. 1–7; B, pp. 1–12. The prin cipal difference between them is that in the Aks.obhyaman. d. ala only Aks.obhya, the central deity (cakre´svarah.) and the ten wrathful Krodharajas that form the outer ¯ protective circle are represented embracing consorts (sasv ¯abhapraj ˜n ¯ah.), whereas 

in the Manjuvajraman ˜ . d. ala this is also the case with the four Tathagatas (Vairo- ¯ cana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi) that occupy the four direc- ¯ tions around the central deity. All the deities in both Man. d. alas are three-faced and six-armed and all except the Krodharajas, who stand in the aggressive Praty ¯ alid ¯ .ha posture, are seated in the Vajraparyanka posture. None of the deities has any of the ˙ Kap¯ alika attributes that mark the iconography of the Yogin ¯ ¯ıtantras, namely the skull-bowl, skull-staff, bone-ornaments, and coating of ash. 

330 The Guhyasam ¯aja proper (chapters 1–17) gives little detail in its account of initia tion and makes no mention of the involvement of a consort, speaking of the neces sity of acquiring such a partner only in the context of the post-initiatory practice known as the vidy ¯avratam; see 16.93: s. od. a´s ¯abdik ¯am. gr.hya sarv ¯ala ˙nk ¯arabh ¯us.it ¯am | c ¯aruvaktr ¯am. vi´s ¯al ¯aks.¯ım. pr ¯apya vidy ¯avratam.caret ‘After obtaining a girl of six teen with a charming face and wide eyes, adorned with every adornment, he should practice the Vidyavrata [with her]’. The supplementary 18th chapter, however, the ¯ Sam ¯ajottara, gives an account of the initiation involving copulation in its vv. 113– 127.

[[143]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

That Tantric Buddhists possessed the specialized knowledge of the Saiva ´ Mantramarga that would enable them to draw at will on the ¯ Saiva Tantras in ´ this period is placed beyond doubt by an early exegetical work in the tradition of the Guhyasam ¯aja. For this, the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, written in all probability in the eighth century,332 assumes that any initiate in the practice of this Tantra is not only familiar with the Saiva scriptures but is able to enact ´ their rituals by assuming the role of a Saiva Guru, implying thereby that such ´ initiates were typically converts from the Mantramarga with experience both of ¯ its texts and of its practices. For it tells the adept of this tradition that in or der to acquire the female consort required for his post-initiatory observance he should enter the home of a family of untouchables who are observant devotees of Siva, reveal to them one of the Saiddh ´ antika scriptures—the text specifically ¯ mentions the K ¯alottara and the Ni´sv ¯asa—give them Man. d. ala initiation [follow ing this scripture], and then return to them the daks.in.¯a that they will give him, taking a girl from them in its place:333 

He should wander in other lands, in which he is known nowhere. With firm re solve the Sadhaka should enter among untouchables who are devotees of ¯ Siva ´ 

: mah ¯atmanah. Cod.). 

332 Portions of the Guhyasiddhi have been quoted in the Cary ¯amel ¯apakaprad¯ıpa of Aryadeva: ¯ Cary ¯amel ¯apakaprad¯ıpa, pp. 71–72 (imam ev ¯artham. dyotayann ¯aha ´sr¯ıguhyasiddhau:) = Guhyasiddhi 3.71–81, 17.38; p. 77 = 6.2–3; and p. 97 = 6.45– 49. TOMABECHI (2008, p. 175) has shown that Aryadeva’s work is likely to have ¯ been written in the early years of the ninth century.

I take dharmam. siddh ¯antap ¯urvakam.in 8.12c to mean ‘dharmam. preceded by [the word] siddh ¯anta- ’, i.e. siddh ¯antadharmam., an example of a not uncommon style of periphrasis.

and recognize no other deity as absolute, who are inspired by the Siddhanta, al- ¯ ways attached to [the rituals of] bathing and deity-worship, and dedicated to the doctrines of its scriptures through some slight degree of literacy. After entering among them in the guise of an untouchable votary (can. d.¯alagan. ah.), he should, while cultivating insight into the highest wisdom, instruct them in the religion of the Siddhanta established in such scriptures as the ¯ K ¯alottara, or the Ni´sv ¯asa;334 and in order to win their trust he should take as his disciples all those who are 

enjoined by the Tantra after [initiating them before] the Initiation Man. d. ala [of Siva]. Then he should give back to them all the goods and money that they will ´ 

previously have gathered and given him as their offering to their Guru and take [instead] a girl of theirs with a beautiful face and eyes. After acquainting her with the essence of the Mantras and making her adhere to the rules of an initiate that wise one should practice the Vidya observance [with her], after resolving to ¯ become a Buddha.335 

This is indeed troubling evidence for those who may be reluctant to accept that Buddhists would have had the familiarity with Tantric Saivism that my thesis ´ of the development of the Mantranaya presupposes.

With the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara, another product of this century,336 we see the beginning of the final phase of s´aktization. It is still ¯ rooted in the liturgical tradition of the Yogatantras,337 as can be seen in the 

334 Literally “that which has arisen from the outbreath (nih.´sv ¯asah./ni´sv ¯asah.) [of Siva]”. ´ Both forms of the name of this scripture, Ni´sv ¯asa and Nih.´sv ¯asa, are attested. 335 Padmavajra is elaborating on Guhyasam ¯aja 16.93: s. od. a´s ¯abdik ¯am. gr.hya sarv ¯ala ˙nk ¯arabh ¯us.it ¯am | c ¯aruvaktr ¯am. vi´s ¯al ¯aks.¯ım. pr ¯apya vidy ¯avratam.caret ‘He should take a girl of sixteen with a beautiful face and wide eyes, adorned with every ornament, and practice the Vidya observance with her’. ¯

Kong ¯o-ch¯o gy¯o yuga j ¯uhatte shiiki (T. 869) Key Points of the Eighteen Assemblies of the Yoga of the Vajra´sekharas ¯utra; see TOMABECHI 2007, p. 905. He composed this work in Chinese at some time between 746 and and his death in 774, but we can be sure that the text existed in some form, perhaps in an early stage of its development, by c. 740, since his knowledge of it must have been gained between 741 and 746, when he was in Ceylon and perhaps India gathering the Tantric literature whose analysis and translation into Chinese occupied the rest of his life. 

337 It is referred to by Aryadeva as a Mah ¯ ayogatantra in his ¯ Cary ¯amel ¯apakaprad¯ıpa, p. 82: adhun ¯a prapa ˜ncat ¯acary ¯a ´sr¯ısarvabuddhasam ¯agamayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara mah ¯ayogatantr ¯ad avat ¯aryate.

group it with the Guhyasam ¯aja and related texts, though which of the Yo gatantras in the broad sense qualified to be considered Mahayogatantras might ¯ be the subject of divergence of opinion. D¯ıpankara ˙ sr´ ¯ıjn˜ana defines this class ¯ (rnal ’byor chen po’i rgyud) as comprising the Guhyasam ¯aja and its explana tory Tantras (vy ¯akhy ¯atantr ¯an.i), which he lists as the Guhyendutilaka, the Kr.s.n. ayam ¯ari, the Param ¯adya, the Sarvadevasam ¯agama, the Sarvarahasya, the Vinay ¯amogha[siddhi], the Vajraj ˜n ¯anasamuccaya, the Vairocanam ¯ay ¯aj ¯ala, the Laghukhasama, the Advaya[samat ¯a]vijaya, and the Vajra´sekhara (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma dka’ ’grel, p. 286: de la rnal ’byor chen po’i rgyud ni dpal gsang ba ’dus par bshad rgyud dang bcas pa dang zla gsang thig le dang gshin rje’i gshed nag po dang mchog dang po dang lha thams cad ’dus pa dang thams cad gsang ba dang ’dul ba don yod pa dang ye shes rdo kun las btus pa dang rnam par snang mdzad sgyu ’phrul dang nam mkha’ dang mnyam pa chung ngu dang gnyis med pa rnam par rgyal ba’i rgyud dang rdo rje gtsug tor rgyud la sogs pa rgyud sde stong phrag bcu gnyis te rgyas par byas na grangs pa med do.) An alternative terminology distinguishes these more esoteric Yogatantras as Yogottaratantras, perhaps origi nally in the meaning ‘Supplementary Tantras (uttaratantr ¯an.i) of the Yoga [class]’, and refers to the Yogin¯ıtantras as Yoganiruttaratantras, giving the ascending series Kriyatantra, Cary ¯ atantra, Yogatantra, Yogottaratantra, and Yoginiruttaratantra; ¯ see, e.g., Ramap ¯ ala, ¯ Sekanirde´sapa ˜njik ¯a, introducing verse 1, describing his teacher Maitreyanatha (Advayavajra) as an unsurpassed master of all of these: ¯ iha mah ¯a pan. d.it ¯avadh ¯uta´sr¯ımaitreyan ¯athah. kriy ¯acary ¯ayogayogottarayoganiruttaratantres. v anuttaraguruh.; Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, ¯ Mukt ¯aval¯ı, p. 223, on Hevajra 2.8.10: sarvam iti pa ˜ncavidham: kriy ¯acary ¯ayoga*yogottarayoganiruttarabhedena (yogottara corr.

I have seen no occurrence in any Indian source of the term *Anuttarayoga, commonly encountered in secondary sources. It is ev idently an incorrect modern translation into Sanskrit of the ambiguous Tibetan rendering of Yoganiruttara (rnal ’byor bla na med). Early authors attest a less developed hierarchy. Vilasavajra, an author of the eighth century (T ¯ RIBE 1994, pp. 9–23) and the Guru of Buddhajn˜anap ¯ ada according to Gzhon nu dpal ( ¯ Blue Annals, p. 367), says that he writes his N ¯amamantr ¯arth ¯avalokin¯ı after study ing the Paramit ¯ anaya and the Kriy ¯ a-, Cary ¯ a-, and Yogatantras (A f. 1v1–2: ¯ yo gacary ¯akriy ¯atantram.tath ¯a p ¯aramit ¯anayam . . . vilokya), but the last evidently in cludes texts such as the Guhyasam ¯aja, Vajrabhairava, and Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga, since he quotes these and other related works. *Buddhaguhya (rNam par snang mdzad chen po mngon par byang chub pa’i rgyud chen po’i ’grel, ff. 64v7–65r6) speaks of Kriyatantras, which emphasize external ritual practice ( ¯ phyi’i spyod, b ¯ahyacary ¯a), giving as examples the Susiddhikara and the Vidy ¯adharapit.aka, and Yogatantras, which emphasize internal meditation (nang gi sbyor, adhy ¯atmayogah.), giving the example of the Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, and says that the Mah ¯a vairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, later classified as a Caryatantra, is a Yogatantra in as much ¯ as it emphasizes the practice of Method and Wisdom (thabs dang shes rab gtsor gyur sbyor ba’i rgyud), but may also be referred to as a Kriyatantra or as an Ub- ¯ hayatantra (bya ba’i rgyud dam gnyis ka’i rgyud), that is to say, as a Tantra of both (ubhaya-) classes, because it also teaches external practice for the benefit of those whose commitment is to this. In a parallel treatment in his Pin. d.¯artha commentary on the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi he gives the Vajrap ¯an. yabhis.eka among exam ples of Kriyatantras (see the translation in H ¯ ODGE 2003, p. 449).

use of that tradition’s system of the four types of Mudra (Mah ¯ amudr ¯ a, Samaya- ¯ mudra, Dharmamudr ¯ a, and Karmamudr ¯ a) in S ¯ adhana texts based on this ¯ Tantra, such as the Vajrajv ¯aloday ¯a of Anandagarbha and the ¯ Herukas ¯adhana of Kalyan¯ . agarbha.338 But it initiates a new direction that would be followed in the next and final phase of the Mantranaya’s development, that of the Yogin¯ıtantras.339 

considered to be a Caryatantra. The terms Kriy ¯ atantra and Yogatantra are seman- ¯ tically coherent, as Buddhaguhya indicates. But the choice of the term Caryatantra ¯ (‘Observance Tantra’) for the intermediate class is puzzling. It is conceivable that it was adopted artificially under the influence of the classification of the subject mat ter of the Tantras of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga into ¯ kriy ¯a, cary ¯a, yogah., and j ˜n ¯anam or vidy ¯a, perhaps with the notion that the fourth corresponds to the Paramit ¯ anaya. ¯ 

338 As far as I am aware, only one other Sadhana text of this Heruka has sur- ¯ vived in Sanskrit. This is the anonymous Herukas ¯adhana of S ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a 241. Anandagarbha’s, which appears not to have been translated into Tibetan, is much ¯ the most detailed of the three. Apart from these works the only other evidence of this cult in surviving Sanskrit sources of which I am aware is in the eclectic Yogin¯ıtantra Sam. put.odbhava, which in f. 80v5–81v2, in its eighth Kalpa, the Sar vakriy ¯asamudayakalpar ¯aja, includes the Mantras of this Heruka and his retinue of goddesses. There is also a chapter in the Abhidh ¯anottara of the Cakrasam. vara corpus (B ff. 121v5–129v1: Pat.ala 22) which teaches a hybrid pantheon in which the goddesses of this Heruka’s retinue have been incorporated into that of Heruka and Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı, the former taking on the appearance of the Heruka of the Sarvabud dhasam ¯ayoga, being four-faced and eight-armed. This poverty of surviving sources in Sanskrit is probably due to the eclipse of this Tantra after the propagation of the later Yogin¯ıtantras, both in India and in Tibet. A striking indication of this eclipse is the fact that its Man. d. ala was not included by Abhayakaragupta in his ¯ Vajr ¯aval¯ı and Nis. pannayog ¯aval¯ı in the first quarter of the eleventh century. For the position that the four Mudras are the distinctive fundamentals of the S ¯ adhana system of the ¯ Yogatantras see, e.g., Mkhas Grub rje’s rGyud spyi, pp. 228–248. 

339 It was accordingly classified in the Kanjur (Toh. 366–367) among the Yogin ¯ ¯ıtantras (Toh. 360–441). Likewise, Mkhas grub rje (1385–1438) in his ¯ rGyud spyi, p. 266: bde mchog kye rdor dus ’khor sgyu thod gdan *bzhi (em. : gsum Ed.) phyag chen thig le sangs rgyas mnyam sbyor sogs ma rgyud yin no ‘The Mother Tantras [=Yogin¯ıtantras] are such as the Sam´. vara, the Hevajra, the K ¯alacakra, the [Mah ¯a]m ¯ay ¯a, the [Buddha]kap ¯ala, the Catus. p¯ıt.ha, the Mah ¯amudr ¯atilaka, and the [Sarva]buddhasam ¯ayoga’. This recognition of the [proto-]Yogin¯ıtantric char acter of the text is not only Tibetan. It appears in the thirteenth chapter of the D.¯akin¯ıvajrapa ˜njara, where it is referred to in abbreviated form as the *Sarvabud dha- (Sangs rgyas kun) in a list of Yogin¯ıtantras that also includes the Vajrad.¯aka, Hevajra, Guhyako´sa, Vajr ¯amr.ta, and Cakrasam. vara: rdo rje mkha’ ’gro phan rgyud dang | *kye yi rdo rje (T : kye yi rdo rje dkyil ’khor D) sangs rgyas kun | gsang mdzod rdo rje bdud rtsi ’byung ba dang | ’khor lo sdom pa gur *gyi (T : dang D) ’byung gnas ni | rnal ’byor ma *rgyud ni (T : rgyud drug tu D) rab tu grags (mKha’ ’gro ma’i dra ba’i rdo rje gur rgyud, D f. 104v4–5; T p. 369, ll. 5–6), and in D¯ıpankara ˙ sr´ ¯ıjn˜ ana’s ¯ commentary on his Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma’i dka’ ’grel, where he refers to the texts of this class under their alternative title as Yoganiruttaratantras (rnal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud), p. 286: rnal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud ni dpal nam mkha’ dang mnyam pa ’bum pa chen po ’khor lo sdom pa dang rdo rje mkha’ ’gro dang rdo rje gdan bzhi pa dang ma h ¯a m ¯a y ¯a dang sangs rgyas mnyam sbyor

Thus, for example, we are told that ‘He-’ means ‘un caused’ (hetuvarjitam), ‘-ru-’ means ‘formless’ (ru¯ panirmuktam), and ‘-ka’ means ‘free of sense-faculties’ (karan. ojjhitam); see Vajrapan¯ .i, Laghutantrat.¯ık ¯a, p. 45; Bhavabhat.t.a, Cakrasam. varapa ˜njik ¯a, p. 5; and the Tibetans, who translated names if they were meaningful, either left this untranslated or substituted a description, namely Khrag ’thung ‘Blood-drinker’, a meaning that cannot be justified etymolog ically. So if the name was meaningful at some stage it appears that that meaning has left no trace in the surviving literature. The alternative is that it never was meaningful in this sense, being created on the basis of the unmeaning syllables HE HE RU RU KAM.that are found in Cakrasam. vara’s Mulamantra: ¯ OM. SR´ ¯IVAJRA HE HE RU RU KAM. HUM¯. HUM¯. PHAT. D. AKIN ¯ ¯IJALA ¯ SAM ´. VARAM. SVAH¯ A¯. Against this it may be said that the name appears without this doubling of the first two syllables in the earlier Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, section 794, in the Mantra for the tam ing of all the Mother goddesses: OM. HERUKA VAJRASAMAYA SARVADUS. T. ASAMAYA MUDRAPRABHA ¯ NJAKA H ˜ UM¯. PHAT.. It might seem more reasonable, then, to see HE HE RU RU KAM. as a spell-element built from an already existing name. However, it is striking that we find almost the same element in the Vidya of Par ¯ ap¯ ar¯ a, an im- ¯ portant Mantra of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha: OM. AGHORE HR¯IH. PARAMAGHORE HUM. GHORARUPE HAH ¯. GHORAMUKHI BH¯IMA BH¯IS. AN. E VAMA PIBA HE RU RU RA RA PHAT. HUM. HAH. PHAT.(Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata 3.23–39; M ¯alin¯ıvijayottara 3.42– 50; Tantr ¯aloka 30.20–24b; Tri´sirobhairava quoted by Jayaratha thereon) and its variant taught in Kubjik ¯amata 18.4-24: AIM. AGHORE HR¯IM. HSAH. PARAMAGHORE HUM¯. GHORARUPE HSAUM ¯. GHORAMUKHI BH¯IMA BH¯IS. AN. E VAMA VAMA PIBA HAH. HE RU RU RA RA HR¯IM. HUM¯. PHAT.. We may note that the name Hevajra, that of the second major deity of the Yogin¯ıtantras, appears to have a similar origin, having been conjured up from the Mantra HE VAJRA PASYA ´ ‘O Vajra[-being], behold!’ that is uttered when the blindfold is removed from the candidate’s eyes in the presence of the Man. d. ala (Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, section 230). The origin of the Herukas Rigi-arali and Vajra- ¯ arali of the Tantras of those names are also, it seems, ¯ the apparently unmeaning syllables of Mantras: OM. ARALI RIGI PHEM ¯. PHEM. PHEM. BHYO SVAH¯ A¯ (Ri gi ¯a ra li’i rgyud f. 187v2) and OM. VAJRA ARALI PHAT ¯.. . . PHEM. PHEM. SVAH¯ A¯ (Ri gi ¯a ra li’i rgyud f. 187v7). The name of the Heruka Buddhakapala ¯ of the Tantra of that name has likewise been conjured out of the feminine vocative BUDDHAKAPALINI ¯ /-KAP¯ ALINI ¯ that appears in its Mantras; see (Nis. pannayog ¯aval¯ı, p. 31: OM. BUDDHAKAPALINI ¯ AH¯. H¯I HAI HUM¯. PHAT.; Buddhakap ¯alatantra, e.g., f. 5r1: OM. BUDDHAKAP¯ ALIN ¯ ¯I MAT. A 2 AH¯. PHAT. SVAH¯ A¯ pus. panivedanamantrah.).

The six families, each with its own sub-Man. d. ala, are those Va jrasattva, Vairocana, Heruka, Padmanartesvara, Vajras ´ urya, and Param ¯ a¯sva. Two ´ Man. d. ala traditions deploy this pantheon. In one Vajrasattva occupies the cen tral sub-Man. d. ala and in the other Heruka. In each sub-Man. d. ala one of these six occupies the centre surrounded by twenty goddesses. The last twelve god desses are the same in each, namely Sus ´.ira, Nr ¯ .tya/V¯ ¯ın. a, Vitat ¯ a, and Ghan ¯ a,¯ followed by Pus.pa, Dh ¯ up¯ a,¯ Alok ¯ a, Gandh ¯ a, Turag ¯ a, Vajramukh ¯ ¯ı, Vajramamak ¯ ¯ı, and Bhasmapralayavetal¯ ¯ı, the first eight of these being, as their names reveal, offering-goddesses (p ¯uj ¯adevyah.), personifications of offerings, and the last four gate guardians, except that in the retinue of Heruka Capadh ¯ arin ¯ .¯ı, Khat.va¯ngadh ˙ arin ¯ .¯ı, Cakradharin ¯ .¯ı, and Citrapatak¯ adh ¯ arin ¯ .¯ı are substituted for the first four, the mu sical offering-goddesses Sus ´.ira, Nr ¯ .tya/V¯ ¯ın. a, Vitat ¯ a, and Ghan ¯ a. The first eight ¯ of the twenty, then, stand apart as the retinue specific to each Tathagata. The ¯ eight from Gaur¯ı to Herukasam. nives´a formed the basis of the retinue of Hevajra ¯ in the Yogin¯ıtantra Hevajra, with the difference that there we see Sabar ´¯ı rather than Pramoha and D ¯ . omb¯ı rather than Herukasam. nives´a. See T ¯ OMABECHI 2007, pp. 919–921 for a complete tabulation of all one hundred and twenty-six deities and their seed-syllables as given in the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga and the Param ¯adya.

According to Anandagarbha ¯ 346 Gaur¯ı (E) is fair in colour and tranquil-faced. 

See also TANAKA 1996, pp. 199–201 for the Tibetan names of all the goddesses (and their Mantras) in the six sub-Man. d. alas, and the listings of the names and posi tions of all the deities of the two six-family Man. d. alas in BSOD NAMS RGYA MTSHO 1991, pp. 106–113. In the Heruka-centred Man. d. ala set out there each of the six deities presiding over the sub-Man. d. alas has a consort: Heruka + ¯Isvar ´ ¯ı, Vairocana + Locana, Vajras ¯ urya + M ¯ amak ¯ ¯ı, Padmanartesvara + P ´ an¯ . d. aravasin ¯ ¯ı, Parama¯sva ´ + Tar¯ a, and Vajradhara + ¯ Sam ´. var¯ı; and the total of deities is 135, since two extra goddesses, counted as one, Citrapadma and Citravajr ¯ a, are found in front of the cen- ¯ tral deity in the sub-Man. d. ala of Parama¯sva, and there are eight additional deities ´ in the outer enclosure, since there too there are four offering goddesses within its corners and four animal-headed goddesses guarding its gateways. Theriocephalic female gate-guardians are a common feature in the Man. d. alas of the Yogin¯ıtantras; see, e.g., Sam. varodaya 13.29c–31b; Jayabhadra, Cakrasam. varapa ˜njik ¯a, p. 113 on 2.8 (Kak¯ asy ¯ a, Ul ¯ uk¯ asy ¯ a,¯ Sv´ an¯ asy ¯ a, S ¯ ukar ¯ asy ¯ a); ¯ Nis. pannayog ¯aval¯ı, p. 15 (Hayasy ¯ a,¯ Sukar ¯ asy ¯ a, ¯ Sv´ an¯ asy ¯ a, and Sim ¯ . hasy ¯ a in the 17-deity Man ¯ . d. ala of Hevajra) and p. 90 (Sukar ¯ asy ¯ a, Gr ¯ .dhrasy ¯ a, Jambuk ¯ asy ¯ a, Garud ¯ . asy ¯ a, Vy ¯ aghr ¯ asy ¯ a, Ul ¯ uk¯ asy ¯ a in the ¯ Man. d. ala of Kalacakra). ¯

Eight-armed, she cuts off each of the four heads of Brahma by simultaneously fir- ¯ ing arrows from four bows.347 Caur¯ı (S) is red and fierce-faced. Wearing a chap let of skulls she holds a goad-hook (a ˙nku´sah.) in her left hand at her heart with a skull-staff in the crook of her left arm resting on her left shoulder, and holds aloft an eight-spoked discuss with the middle finger of her right, pressing down on the three worlds with her left foot. Pramoha (W) is black and four-armed, with ¯ the face of Vis.n. u’s boar-incarnation (¯adivar ¯ahamukh ¯a). In her first left hand she holds a skull-bowl full of wine and in her first right a Vajra. With her other two hands she imitates the boar-incarnation by raising up the earth.348 Vetal¯ ¯ı (N) is white and joyful-faced. With her right hand she pours a stream of the nec tar of immortality from a transparent skull-cup and with her left shows the Va jra banner gesture. Pukkas¯ı [E] is multi-coloured (vi´svavarn.¯a) and dancing in a smoky cremation-ground full of strings of skulls and the like. In her right fist she clasps a five-pronged Vajra and in her left a wind-buffetted tendril from the wish granting tree of paradise (kalpavr. ks. alat ¯a). Can. d. al¯ ¯ı (S) is dark blue and riding on a whirlwind (v ¯ataman. d. alik ¯a). In her right fist she clenches a Vajra-topped trident and with her left releases a whirlwind against her victims. Ghasmar¯ı (W) is black and eating a corpse. In her left hand she holds a blazing sacrificial fire-vessel (agnikun. d. a-) and with her right grasps a sword. Herukasam. nibha¯ (N), black like Heruka, holds a skull-cup [to her heart] in her left hand, with a skull-staff resting on her left shoulder, and a five-pronged Vajra in her right. Capadh ¯ arin ¯ .¯ı (SE) is red and, holding a Vajra bow with her left hand, fires Vajra arrows by drawing back the bowstring with her right.

A complete but less detailed description of these eight can be seen in the Tibetan translation of the *Herukas ¯adhana of Hum¯ . karavajra, f. 204r4–7. The identity of ¯ the non-human heads of the gate-guardians is mentioned in these sources only in the case of the horse-headed Turangam ˙ a, by ¯ Anandagarbha and H ¯ um¯ . karavajra (f. ¯ 204r5: shar sgo rta mgrin ’phang mtho dkar | g.yas na rta gdong g.yon lcags kyu), and Vajramukh¯ı, by Hum¯ . karavajra, who names this goddess Phag gdong ‘Boar- ¯ face’ (Sukar ¯ asy ¯ a) (f. 204r6: ¯ lhor sgor phag gdong snon mo ste | g.yas pas mche ba g.yon zhags ’dzin). According to the tradition of the Ngor Man. d. alas, the last two door-guardians, Snang ba ma (Alok ¯ a) and Thal byed ma (*Bhasmak ¯ arin ¯ .¯ı [?]), are crow-faced and dog-faced (BSOD NAMS RGYA MTSHO 1991, p. 110). These animal headed guardians exemplify the character of this Tantra as transitional between the Yogatantras and the Yogin¯ıtantras. The animal-headedness is shared with such goddesses in the latter (see here p. 151), but the hand-attributes, namely the hook, noose, chain, and bell, are those of Vajra¯nku ˙ sa, Vajrap ´ a¯sa, Vajrasphot ´ .a, and Vajrave ¯ sa, the male gate-guardians of the Vajradh ´ atuman ¯ . d. ala of the Yogatantra Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha; see TANAKA 1996, p. 271. For those attributes see the *Herukas ¯adhana of Hum¯ . karavajra, f. 204r5–7 (I have restored the Mantras, ¯ which invoke the goddesses as the personifications of these attributes, to their cor rect Sanskrit form): OM. *VAJRA¯ NKU ˙ SE´ (corr.

tath ¯agattattvasam. graha,350 is very much in the Kap¯ alika style of the pantheons ¯ of Bhairavas and Yogin¯ıs taught in the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha. 

Second, it is in the tradition of this Tantra that we see for the first time in the Mantranaya the practice of the gan. aman. d. alam, orgiastic worship in an assembly consisting of a male and a group of female adepts (yogin¯ıgan. ah.) person ifying the deities of the cult, with a jargon of special terms and gestures known as chomm ¯ah.to be used in these gatherings.351 Both these features, collective orgiastic worship of deity-personifying Yogin¯ıs and the use of chomm ¯ah., are dis tinctive features of the S´ akta ¯ Saivism of the Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha.352 

Third, we see here for the first time the complete abandoning of the mixed prose and verse style inherited from the Mahay¯ anas ¯ utras in favour of one that ¯ resembles that of the Saiva scriptures in consisting entirely of Anus ´.t.ubh verse, barring the Mantras, and also the disappearance of the traditional Buddhist preamble maintained up to the time of the Guhyasam ¯aja, stating the occasion and place of the revelation.353 It is also in the Sarvakalpasamuccaya, the supple 

350 See Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, sections 165–176 and Nis. pannayog ¯aval¯ı, p. 46 (Vajradhup¯ a, Vajrapus ¯ .pa, Vajr ¯ alok ¯ a, and Vajragandh ¯ a). ¯ 

351 The practice and the jargon are outlined by Aryadeva in his ¯ Cary ¯amel ¯apakaprad¯ıpa (pp. 82–60: prapa ˜ncat ¯acary ¯a) on the authority of this Tantra. The Yogin¯ıs per sonified here are the twenty that form the retinue of Vajrasattva, the eight pecu liar to him being Sam´. var¯ı, Ahosukha, Prad ¯ ¯ıpa, ¯ Sis ´.ya, Buddhabodhi, Dharmacakr ¯ a,¯ Trailokya, and K ¯ amalat ¯ a.¯ 

352 On such worship in S´ akta ¯ Saivism see S ´ ANDERSON 2007a, pp. 280–288; and Tantr ¯aloka 28.6–111, 372c–385b (yogin¯ımelakah., cakray ¯agah., m ¯urtiy ¯agah.), 29.66, 78–79. On chomm ¯ah.in these traditions see SANDERSON 2007a, p. 333 and the sources quoted in footnotes 331–332. 

353 The Tantra begins as follows (Sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam par sbyor ba, f. 151r1–2: 1.1 sems dpa’ sangs rgyas kun gyi dngos | rdo rje sems dpa’ bde ba’i mchog | gsang ba mchog gi dgyes pa na | thams cad bdag nyid rtag tu gzhugs | 1.2 ’di ni rang byung bcos ldan ’das | gcig bu rab tu phye ba’i lha | sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam sbyor ba | mkha’ ’gro sgyu ma bde ba’i mchog (*rahasye parame ramye sarv ¯atmani sad ¯a sthitah.| sarvabuddhamayah.sattvo vajrasattvah. param.sukham k asau svayambh ¯ur bhagav ¯an eka ev ¯adhidaivatah.k sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varah.).

These verses are 1–2 of the Kalpa 6 of the Tantra, corresponding to the Tibetan, except that that seems to have had a different version of the first line (f. 159v4–5): de nas gzhan yang thams cad du | rnam pa sna tshogs mchog ’byung pa’i | sangs rgyas thams cad mnyam sbyor ba | mkha’ ’gro sgyu ma’i

mentary continuation (uttaratantra) of this Tantra, that we see the first appear ance in the Mantranaya of the Saiva method of teaching Mantras in encrypted ´ 

form to be decoded by the process known as mantroddh ¯arah.; and with this devel opment we encounter what is at present our earliest evidence of Buddhist-Saiva ´ 

intertextuality. A passage of seven verses that prescribes for this purpose the drawing of a square with forty-nine cells (kos.t.hak ¯ani) and the arranging of the forty-nine letters within them corresponds very closely to one in the V¯ın.¯a´sikha of the v ¯amasrotah. division of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha.354 

The intensification of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva character of the Mantranaya evident ´ in this text is accompanied by the implication that this Buddhism is one that has conquered that tradition, transforming it, as it were, from within into a ve hicle for Buddhist salvation. For while wrathful Heruka appears with Kap¯ alika ¯ iconography and a retinue of Yogin¯ıs he wears, as we have seen, the freshly flayed skin of Bhairava over his shoulders; and the Tantra relates that its deity in its commitment to purify all beings has violently overpowered Siva, Vis ´.n. u, Brahma, ¯ and Kamadeva, and taken their consorts by force for his own enjoyment. ¯355 This 

bde mchog bshad. For the requirement of a preamble see, e.g., the Mahay¯ anist ¯ Dharmasam. g¯ıtis ¯utra as quoted by Abhayakaragupta in the introduction to his ¯ Ab hayapaddhati f. 1v: k ¯alade´sade´sakapars. ats ¯amagr¯ı hi de´san ¯ay ¯a nid ¯anam en ¯am. vin ¯a de´san ¯anupapatteh.. tatra evam. mayeti mama dharmah.sam. g ¯atavyah.. . . ity uktam. bhagavat ¯a dharmasam. g¯ıtis ¯utre ‘For the preamble that establishes the au thenticity of a teaching [comprises] all these factors together, namely the time, place, teacher, and congregation, because without all those it cannot be [accepted as] a teaching. To this effect the Buddha has declared in the Dharmasam. g¯ıtis ¯utra . . . : ‘My teachings must be recited with [the opening phrase] “Thus I [. . . ]”’; and the unnamed S ¯utra quoted by Tathagataraks ¯ .ita on Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara 1.1: mayi parinirvr.te bhiks. ava evam. mayety ¯adikay ¯a mama dharmah.sam. g ¯atavyah.‘O monks, after I have been completely extinguished [by death] you should recite my teachings with the words “Thus I . . . ”’.

rhetoric of appropriation is reflected in the Mantras of Heruka’s Vajrad. akin ¯ ¯ıs. Pramoha, who, as we have seen, has the boar face of Vis ¯ .n. u’s Adivar ¯ aha incarna- ¯ tion, is invoked as Vajranar¯ ayan ¯ .¯ı, Caur¯ı as Vajracan. d. esvar ´ ¯ı, and Ghasmar¯ı as Vajramahe ¯ svar ´ ¯ı.356 Furthermore, Heruka’s first appearance in the Mantranaya 

is in the Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha, where his name appears in a Mantra for the drawing of all the [Saiva] Mother-goddesses into Buddhism, and it is ´ 

that, with the insertion of a single seed syllable, that is adopted as the Mantra of Heruka in the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara.357 The very title of the work alludes to this assimilation, since it is evidently calqued on those of two Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha scriptures, the Sarvav¯ırasam ¯ayoga and the Yogin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara.358

There are other examples of the assimilative transformation of non-Buddhist deities in the Mantranaya, marked, as here, by the prefixing of Vajra- to their names. For example, the deities Vajranar¯ ayan ¯ . a, [Vajra]can. d.¯ısvara, ´ and Vajrapadmodbhava, that is to say, Vajrayanist transformations of Vis ¯ .n. u, Rudra, and Brahma, together with their consorts Vajra ¯ sr´ ¯ı, Vajragaur¯ı, and Vajratar¯ a, join ¯ Ak¯ a¯sagarbha and Khavajrin ´ .¯ı to form the retinue of Vajrasattva in the central sec tion of the abridged Man. d. ala (bsdus pa’i dkyil ’khor) of the Yogatantra Param ¯adya, a text with which the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga is closely related (TOMABECHI 2007, p. 904; TANAKA 1996, pp. 271–272). That disposition of deities is taught (see TANAKA 1996, pp. 96–103) in the mChog dang po’i sngags kyi rtog pa’i dum bu (*Sr¯ıparam ¯adyamantrakalpakhan ´. d. a) (Toh. 488) according to ¯ Anandagarbha’s ¯ mChog dang po’i rgya cher bshad pa (*Param ¯adyat.¯ık ¯a) (Toh. 2512). ¯

The expression sarvav¯ırasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varam, without the substi tution of -buddha- for -v¯ıra-, is seen in the Yogin¯ıtantras of Cakrasam. vara. It ap pears in, e.g., Laghu´sam. varatantra, f. 8r3 (8.1) and f. 24v4 (31.13ef): tatah.sarva v¯ırasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varam; and Sam. varodaya 3.6cd: sarvav¯ırasam ¯ayoga d.¯akin¯ıj ¯alasatsukham. In the last satsukham is a tacit semantic analysis of ´sam. varah.. 

[[156]]

Laghu´sam. vara also called Cakrasam. vara and Heruk ¯abhidh ¯ana, the Heva jra, the Catus. p¯ıt.ha, the Vajr ¯amr.ta, the Buddhakap ¯ala, the Mah ¯am ¯ay ¯a, the Rigy ¯arali, the Vajr ¯arali, the Can. d. amah ¯aros. an. a, and the K ¯alacakra. Two of these texts, the Laghu´sam. vara of the Heruka called Sam ´. vara (bDe mchog) or Cakrasam. vara (’Khor lo sdom pa) and the Hevajra of the Heruka Hevajra held centre-stage, a position they later shared with the K ¯alacakra when that text was propagated towards the end of the tenth century, during the reign of Mah¯ıpala I (r. ¯ c. 977–1027).359 Their importance is reflected in the shere quantity of commentaries and other texts devoted to the cult of their deities. The Tenjur contains translations of eleven commentaries on the Hevajra and of eleven on the Laghu´sam. vara, and of about two hundred other explanatory texts related to each. Moreover, they both have a number of satellite Tantras, the Hevajra five and the Laghu´sam. vara over fifty.360 The principal among these, those that received commentaries, are for the Hevajra the D.¯akin¯ıvajrapa ˜njara and the Mah ¯amudr ¯atilaka, and for the Laghu´sam. vara the Heruk ¯abhyudaya, the Vajrad.¯aka, the Abhidh ¯anottara, the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara, the Sam. varodaya, and the D.¯ak ¯arn. ava. Another major Yogin¯ıtantra, the Sam. put.odbhava, on which we have an important commentary, the Amn ¯ayama ˜njar¯ı ¯, by Abhayakaragupta ¯ (1064–1125),361 pertains to both cycles.362 

359 On the date of the K ¯alacakra see here p. 96. On the establishing of this tradition and how it positioned itself in relation to earlier Tantric Buddhism see SFERRA 2005. 

360 This large total includes thirty-four texts (Toh. 383–416), forming a supplementary ¯ collection, as it were, of related opera minora, totalling less than 150 pages. Though included in the Kanjur they were classified by Bu ston (1290–1364) as supplemen tary Tantras whose authenticity, that is to say, Indian origin, was the subject of debate (rgyud yang dag yin min rtsod pa can). The great majority are claimed in their colophons to be translations prepared in the early eleventh century by ’Brog mi in collaboration with the Indian Gayadhara. On the lay Tantric Gayadhara, who is mentioned in no Indian source known to me but is the subject of many partly conflicting accounts in Tibet, where he was venerated as the Indian source of the Lam ’bras tradition and for having collaborated with several Tibetan translators, see STEARNS 2001, pp. 47–55. It is, however, certain that not all these opera mi nora are of suspect authenticity. For my pupil Peter-D ´ aniel Sz ´ ant ´ o has recently ´ identified the original Sanskrit of one, the An ¯avilatantra, among the contents of a palm-leaf codex preserved in the Tokyo University Library (verbal communication). 

361 These dates rest on Tibetan tradition and are consistent with the regnal years of Ramap ¯ ala that Abhay ¯ akaragupta has reported as the dates of composition at the ¯ end of some of his works; see here p. 126. 

362 Thus, though counted as an explanatory Tantra of the Cakrasam. vara cycle, it is grouped with the Hevajra and D.¯akin¯ıvajrapa ˜njara as one of the three Tantras of Hevajra (kye rdo rje rgyud gsum) in the Sa skya tradition of Tibet, and classified because of its mixed character as the Hevajra’s shared explanatory Tantra (thun mong bshad rgyud); see STEARNS 2001, pp. 173–174, n. 28. It also extends into the territories of the Catus. p¯ıt.ha, the Guhyasam ¯aja, the Vajrabhairava, and, as we

CHRONOLOGY AND PROVENANCE. All of these Tantras were translated into Tibetan, and all but the latest among them, the D.¯ak ¯arn. ava and the Sam. varodya, were translated in the first half of the eleventh century, during the opening phase of the later diffusion (phyi dar) of Indian Buddhism to Tibet, as were commen taries on the majority of those named here, most written during the course of the tenth and early eleventh centuries. 

The oldest is probably the commentary of Jayabhadra on the Laghu´sam. vara. In chapter 38 of his Rgya gar chos ’byung Taran ¯ atha includes five of our com- ¯ mentators on the Laghu´sam. vara, Jayabhadra, Bhavabhadra/Bhavabhat.t.a, Bhavyak¯ırti, Durjayacandra, and Tathagataraks ¯ .ita, among ten persons whom he holds to have occupied the office of chief Vajrac¯ arya at Vikrama ¯ s´¯ıla in rapid unbroken succession, and claims that Jayabhadra was the first of the ten (Jayabhadra, Sr´¯ıdhara, Bhavabhadra (/Bhavabhat.t.a), Bhavyak¯ırti, L¯ılavajra, ¯ Durjayacandra, Kr.s.n. asamayavajra, Tathagataraks ¯ .ita, Bodhibhadra, and Kamalaraks.ita). Moreover, comparison of the commentaries, the Tibetan trans lation, and the only manuscript of the Laghu´sam. vara accessible to me at present reveals two versions of the text. Taran ¯ atha’s claim that Jayabhadra preceded all ¯ the other commentators in his list gains support from the fact that Jayabhadra knew what is evidently the earlier of these two versions. It extends only to 50.19, ending with a passage on fire-sacrifices that may be performed if one wishes to subject another to one’s will (va´syahomah.). In the second, attested by all the other commentators except Bhavyak¯ırti,363 by the Tibetan translation, and by 

have seen, the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara. 

363 In Bhavyak¯ırti’s Cakrasam. varapa ˜njik ¯a the text of the Laghu´sam. vara ends exactly where it does in Jayabhadra’s. It is therefore likely to belong like Jayabhadra’s to the earliest phase of the exegesis of this Tantra. Jayabhadra’s appears to be the older of the two. In 41.8 Bhavyak¯ırti attests with the later witnesses the interpo lation (see here p.199) *od. d.iy ¯anaj ¯alandharapull¯ıramalay ¯adis.u (bDe mchog nyung ngu, f. 239r2: au d. ya na | dz ¯a la ndha ra dang pu li ra ma la ya sogs), since he comments here (f. 36v6): o d. y ¯a na du ni ’od ldan ma’o | dz ¯a la ndha rar ni gtum mig ma’o | pu ll¯ı ra ma la ya la sogs, whereas Jayabhadra says that Pull¯ıramalaya has not been mentioned but must nonetheless be understood to be intended (p. 137: pull¯ıramalayo na nirdis.t.ah.sarvap¯ıt.h ¯an ¯am. pradh ¯anatv ¯ad upade´s ¯ad v ¯avaseyah.). It seems probable, then, that Bhavyak¯ırti follows the reading of a subsequent redac tion in which this ‘omission’ had been rectified. 

At the beginning of the translation the name of Bhavyak¯ırti’s commentary is said to be S ¯uramanoj ˜n ¯a ´in Sanskrit and dpa’ bo’i yid du ’ong in Tibetan, i.e. ‘pleasing to heroes’. But the Sanskrit titles given in the Tenjur are so often inaccurate that we can conclude that they do not reach us from the Sanskrit works themselves but are reconstructions from the Tibetan added by the compilers of the Tenjur. The Sanskrit rendered by dPa’ bo’i yid du ’ong can now only be guessed, but its first element was surely V¯ıra- rather than S ¯ura- ´. The Mah ¯avyutpatti, composed to guide Tibetan translators and no doubt the dictionary used by the compilers of the Tenjur, gives dpa’ bo to render both v¯ıra- and ´s ¯ura-, both meaning ‘hero’; but though the two

the manuscript, the fiftieth chapter has eight verses after the last of the shorter text (50.20–27), followed by a fifty-first chapter of twenty-two verses. It is clear that the longer text is the later. For the alternative, that the shorter text arose after the longer by excision of the final thirty verses, is inconceivable, since these have the effect of greatly increasing the plausibility of the whole as a Buddhist work and were no doubt added because it was felt, quite rightly, that 1.1 to 50.19 were inadequate in this regard. The only element of Mahay¯ ana Buddhist ¯ doctrine contained in the text up to 50.19 comprises a section of four verses (10.1–4) stating that success in the pursuit of Siddhis depends on the Sadhaka’s ¯ identifying with the three Buddha bodies (Dharmakaya, Sam ¯ . bhogakaya, and ¯ Nirman¯ . akaya), all other Buddhist elements being little more than a handful of ¯ occurrences of the terms Buddha, Tathagata, and Bodhisattva, and the names ¯ of Vajrayanist deities. ¯ 

Now Taran ¯ atha claims that his ten successive Tantric ¯ Ac¯ aryas of ¯ Vikramas´¯ıla held their positions after the time of Buddhajn˜anap ¯ ada and ¯ D¯ıpankarabhadra, whom he places in the reign of Dharmap ˙ ala ( ¯ c. 775–812); and he reports that each did so for twelve years, implying thereby a form of limited tenure. Thereafter, he says, came the six “Door-keepers”. Among them was Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, who taught the Tibetan translator ’Brog mi ¯ S´ akya ye ¯ shes (993–1077?)364 and the Indian D¯ıpankara ˙ sr´ ¯ıjn˜ana ¯365 (982–1054), and was a slightly older contemporary of Jn˜ana ¯ sr´ ¯ımitra, who was active c. 980–1030. From this it would be a simple matter to determine the approximate date of Jayabhadra, the first of the ten, by counting the years from either end, were it not that Taran ¯ atha makes the collective tenure of the ten ¯ Ac¯ aryas 120 years, ¯ whereas the interval between D¯ıpankarabhadra and Ratn ˙ akara ¯ s´anti is almost ¯ two centuries. We might be inclined to count back from Ratnakara ¯ s´anti rather ¯ than forward from D¯ıpankarabhadra, thinking that a historian’s information ˙ is likely to be more reliable the closer he approaches his own time. In that case, if we trust Taran ¯ atha and set the end of the tenure of Kamalaraks ¯ .ita in 1000, as the immediate predecessor of the Door-keepers, we will conclude that Jayabhadra’s tenure ran from 880–892. 

words are synonymous in ordinary usage, in the tradition of the Yogin¯ıtantras it is the former alone that is used in the special sense evidently intended here, that is, as a technical term for the Tantric practitioner. As for the second element, the same dictionary gives manoj ˜na- for yid du ’ong. But the result is unattractive by the standards of Sanskrit authors, who generally sought, like authors everywhere, to give their works titles that appealed to the ear. V¯ıramanoram ¯a is synonymous and meets this requirement.

However, this chronology can be reconciled with other reports only at a great stretch, at least for the later teachers in Taran ¯ atha’s succession. Thus Dmar ¯ ston, pupil of Sa skya Pan. d.ita Kun dga’ rgyal mtshan (1182–1251) tells us366 that Durjayacandra, who by this calculation would have held office from 940 to 952, was the teacher of Prajnendraruci, also called V ˜ ¯ıravajra, and that the latter taught ’Brog mi S´ akya ye shes. Now ’Brog mi is said to have let Tibet ¯ for Nepal and India when Rin chen bzang po was nearly fifty years old,367 that is to say around 1007 if Rin chen bzang po was born in 958, as his biography claims and Gzhon nu dpal accepts,368 and then, after spending one year in Nepal with S´ antibhadra ¯369 and eight at Vikramas´¯ıla with Ratnakara ¯ s´anti, ¯370 to have studied with Prajnendraruci for three or four, ˜371 that is to say, therefore, c. 1016– 1020. If we accept that Durjayacandra is unlikely to have held such a senior post as that of the head Vajrac¯ arya of Vikrama ¯ s´¯ıla in his youth and assume for the sake of argument that he was fifty-five when he began his tenure, then if that tenure began in 940, he would have to have been continuing to teach long after his retirement at sixty-seven in 952, and Prajnendraruci, if we take 945 as ˜ the latest plausible year of his birth, would have been about seventy when he accepted ’Brog mi as his pupil. 

This scenario is not impossible; but neither is it comfortable. Nor is it helped by the fact that Prajnendraruci is reported to have collaborated with ’Brog mi ˜ on translations of texts pertaining to Hevajra and his consort Nairatmy ¯ a. This ¯ evidence is given in the colophons at the end of these translations372 and should be considered more reliable than that of hagiographical biographies. 

Even more difficult to reconcile is the report in the Chos ’byung of Pad ma dkar po (1527–1592) that Durjayacandra taught the Mantranaya at Vikramas´¯ıla to the translator Rin chen bzang po.373 For Rin chen bzang po is said to have left for India in 975, at the age of seventeen, and to have gone to Vikramas´¯ıla only after a period of some seven years of education in Kashmir, therefore around 982. At that time Durjayacandra would have been nearly a hundred if we hold to the assumption that he began his tenure in 940 when he was fifty-five years of age.374 It is probable, then, that while we are indeed closer to the truth if

we calculate back from the Door-keepers than forward from Buddhajn˜ana and ¯ D¯ıpankarabhadra, T ˙ aran ¯ atha has placed the later teachers from Durjayacandra ¯ onwards too early. 

This suspicion gains further support from what we know of the life of Tathagataraks ¯ .ita. If Taran ¯ atha’s report were accurate, provided that we ¯ calculate backwards from the six Door-keepers, then he would have held office at Vikramas´¯ıla c. 964–976. But we learn from the colophon of the Tibetan translation of his commentary on the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara that he translated the work himself with the help of the Tibetan Ba ri Lo tsa ba Rin chen grags. This places ¯ his activity well into the second half of the eleventh century. For Ba ri Rin chen grags is said by Gzhon nu dpal to have been born in 1040.375 

If Durjayacandra, as now seems probable, was active towards the end of the tenth century, and if Taran ¯ atha is correct that there were no intervals ¯ between the tenures of his predecessors Jayabhadra, Sr´¯ıdhara, Bhavabhadra, Bhavyak¯ırti, and L¯ılavajra, then we shall not be far from the truth if we assign ¯ them all these commentators on the Laghu´sam. vara to the tenth century. 

Beyond the terminus provided by this tentative dating of the earliest commentators we have no clear knowledge of the date of these Tantras. It has been claimed by DAVIDSON that the Laghu´sam. vara was already in ex istence in the eighth century since Vilasavajra cites it several times in his ¯ commentary on the Ma ˜nju´sr¯ın ¯amasam. g¯ıti;376 and this view has recently been repeated by GRAY.377 The latter recognized that most of the former’s claimed 

citations are actually not of the Laghu´sam. varatantra but of the Sarvabud dhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara, which Vilasavajra cites as the ¯ Sam´. varatantra, using the common abbreviation of this unwieldy title. But he argues that the date is established nonetheless by two places in the same commentary in which Vilasavajra cites a ¯ Cakrasam. varatantra or Cakra´sam. varatantra. This GRAY takes to be the Laghu´sam. vara under its commonly used alias. Both citations occur in a section of the commentary in which, explaining epithets found in the Ma ˜nju´sr¯ın ¯amasam. g¯ıti, Vilasavajra follows each with ¯ iti and the name of a Tantra in the locative, indicating that the epithet is also found in that source. The first citation, GRAY claims, is of Laghu´sam. vara 2.16c (f. 2v6: hasticarm ¯avaruddham.ca ‘and [his back] covered with the hide of an elephant’), and the second of 48.12a (f. 35r6: ka ˙nk ¯ala mah ¯aka ˙nk ¯ala). In fact the first passage does not cite Laghu´sam. vara 2.16c, the text quoted being gajacarmapat.¯ardradhr. k ‘wearing as his upper garment the moist hide of an

elephant’, to which Laghu´sam. vara 2.16c corresponds only in sense and then not exactly.378 As for the second citation,379 the word ka ˙nk ¯alah. does appear in the Laghu´sam. vara, as the name of one of the twenty-four V¯ıra consorts of the twenty-four D. akin ¯ ¯ıs,380 but as a single word its presence is not enough to es tablish the identity of Vilasavajra’s ¯ Cakrasam. vara with the Laghu´sam. vara. On the other hand, the fact that the first epithet attributed to the Cakrasam. vara does not occur in the Laghu´sam. vara is not sufficient to prove the opposing thesis, that Vilasavajra was referring to another work. For it is conceivable ¯ that he was citing the text not for the exact wording of Ma ˜nju´sr¯ın ¯amasam. g¯ıti 69d (gajacarmapat.¯ardradhr. k) but only for an expression close to it in meaning. But if this is true it establishes, of course, only that Vilasavajra may have been ¯ referring to Laghu´sam. vara 2.16c, not that he was. To continue to hold to the position that Vilasavajra must have been referring to our ¯ Laghu´sam. vara in spite of these considerations, one has to put one’s trust in the fact that the Laghu´sam. vara is also known as the Cakrasam. vara and the fact that no other work of this name is cited (unless it be here). One must also remain free of the suspicion that there might have been another, earlier work with this title among the numerous Tantras known in the eighth century that have failed to survive either in Sanskrit or in Tibetan translation.381 One must also overlook the evidence of the Laghu´sam. vara itself. For that refers to a Cakrasam. vara in a list of its own predecessors.382 I conclude, therefore, that there is no more than

a possibility that Vilasavajra knew the ¯ Laghu´sam. vara and, therefore, that the existence of this Tantra in the eighth century remains unproved. What we can say with confidence is that the Laghu´sam. vara came af ter the Param ¯adya, the Vajrabhairava, the Sarvatath ¯agatasam. graha, the Guhyasam ¯aja, and the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara, since it names these,383 and tacitly incorporates verses from the last three in its earliest accessible redaction.384 These borrowings do not rule out the possibility that the

Laghu´sam. vara was composed in that century, since none of the works is later than that time. But three considerations suggest a later date. (1) No text of the Cakrasam. vara corpus, or any other Yogin¯ıtantra, was translated into Tibetan during the earlier diffusion of Buddhism (snga dar) that occurred from the eighth century to the middle of the ninth, during Tibet’s imperial period: this new literature reached the Tibetans only during the later transmission (phyi dar), that began c. 1000. (2) Among the many surviving stone, metalwork, and painted Indian images of Sam ´. vara none is demonstrably earlier than the tenth century.385 Finally (3), there is, as we have seen, no evidence of commentatorial work on the Laghu´sam. vara before c. 900. Of course, none of these facts proves conclusively that the Laghu´sam. vara was not in existence at an earlier date. But they do incline one to consider a later date more probable. This is particularly so in the case of the absence of commentaries. The Laghu´sam. vara is so problematic text from the Buddhist point of view that it is hard to imagine that it could have survived for long without the support of learned exegesis. 

Whatever its date, the Laghu´sam. vara is likely to be a product of the first phase of the development of the Yogin¯ıtantras, if not the earliest of them all. This surmise rests on the assumption that Yogin¯ıtantras that are less sophis ticated in the sense that they show a less developed Mahay¯ ana Buddhist theo- ¯

385 A Kashmirian Sam ´. vara of leaded brass inlaid with copper and silver in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from the Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck Collection appears to have been assigned by PAL to c. 725 in his catalogue of the exhibition ‘The Arts of Kashmir’ (2007, p. 91, fig. 92). However, he has kindly informed me (personal communication, 1 March, 2008) that this surprisingly early date is not his own but that of the museum (for which see http://collectionsonline.lacma.org) recorded on the loan agreement form. The lending museum insisted on this date and it was substituted for his own without consulting him. He had assigned it to “ca. 9th century”. In an earlier publication (1975, p. 173, pls. 64a,b) he had proposed the tenth. REEDY (1997, p. 162, fig. K62) gives ‘9th–10th century’. LINROTHE (1999, p. 289, fig. 211) has found these dates too early and suggests the late tenth or early eleventh century. In the absence of a detailed art-historical demonstration of the date, which I suspect could in any case be no more than tentative given the small population of comparable pieces, I am inclined in the light of the other historical evidence to agree with LINROTHE. 

[[164]]

retical framework are likely to be earlier than those in which the level of the oretical assimilation is more advanced. By this criterion the Hevajra must be placed after the Laghu´sam. vara. This also assumes that the development of the Mantranaya was not unilinear throughout, since if it were we would have to place the Laghu´sam. vara before the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi, Sarvatath ¯a gatatattvasam. graha, Guhyasam ¯aja, and Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga. It assumes, then, that the Yogin¯ıtantras represent a new phase with its own humble begin ning, and that it was only later in this phase that the tradition got up to speed, as it were, by fully integrating the new world of practice whose entry marks its commencement by providing it with a thoroughly Buddhist encoding. While it is possible that this assimilation of the text began long after its first redaction it seems more probable in the absence of firm evidence to the contrary that if so problematic a creation were to have remained for long without the benefit of learned exegesis it would be likely to have disappeared without trace. 

As for the provenance of the Laghu´sam. vara, it was certainly eastern India, the region in which most of the Indian learned exegesis of this Tantric corpus was produced. The Tantra does not state this explicitly. Claiming the status of revelation it would have been averse to doing so. Nonetheless, it reveals its provenance in spite of itself by giving BA in its encoding of some of the syllables of Mantras where correct Sanskrit requires VA. This is evidently an effect of the fact that va is pronounced ba in the Indo-Aryan vernaculars of this region.386 Thus 5.4 yields BHAGABATE rather than BHAGAVATE: pa ˜ncamasya yac caturtham. prathamasya tr.t¯ıyam | trayovim.´sas tathaiva ca caturthasya yah. prathamam (f. 5r3–4) ‘the fourth of the fifth [class of consonants] (BHA), the third of the first (GA), the twenty-third (BA), and the first of the fourth (T-)’ ; and 30.20–21 yields BHAGABAM¯.rather than BHAGAVAM¯.(for BHAGAVAN¯ ): kos.t.hak ¯ad da´samam.caiva vilomena tu s ¯adhakah.| kos.t.hak ¯a ekonavim.´satimam.tath ¯a trayovim.´satikos.t.hak ¯ad | dvit¯ıyakos.t.hasam. yuktam. bindun ¯a ¯urdhvabh ¯us.itam.(f. 23v4–5) ‘The Sadhaka should select the tenth counting backwards from the ¯ compartment [of HA] (BHA), the nineteenth from that [of A] (GA), and the [letter] from the twenty-third box (B-) together with [the letter in] the second box adorned above with a dot (AM¯.)’. 

Variant readings giving the correct spellings in these cases are found. In 5.4 Jayabhadra and Bhavabhat.t.a read ekonnatrim.´sa- (sic) and ekonatrim.´sati ‘the twenty-ninth’ (VA) rather than the trayovim.´sa- ‘the twenty-third’ (BA) seen in the Baroda manuscript; and this reading is also found in the Tibetan translation (de bzhin nyi shu tsa dgu la [= ekonatrim.´sam.tathaiva ca]) and the redaction 

386 This is so in Bihar¯ ¯ı, Maithil¯ı, Bengali, Kumaun ¯ ¯ı, Nepali, Assamese, and Or ¯ .iya.¯ [[165]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

of this passage in Pat.ala 54 of the Abhidh ¯anottara (A f. 166r3: ekonnatrin´sam. tathaiva ca). Likewise in 30.21 we find Jayabhadra giving ekonatrim.´sati- (VA) in place of the reading trayovim.´sati (BA) attested by the manuscript, but here the ‘incorrect’ reading is also supported by the Tibetan translation and the commen tary of Bhavabhat.t.a. There can be little doubt that the non-standard readings giving BA rather than VA are original. For it is not surprising there should have been attempts to correct an original BA to VA, whereas it would be most unlikely that any redactor would have made the effort to rewrite a reading that gave VA in order to yield BA.387 

Also indicative of the east-Indian provenance and development of this cor pus are the form cham. doha- in place of sam. doha-,388 and the pervasive promis cuity of the forms -sam´ . vara- and -sam. vara- in the names of its deity, in the title of the primary Tantra, and in the compound in which this form is pre ceded by d.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala- or yogin¯ıj ¯ala-. I use the forms Sam ´. vara and Cakrasam. vara. Laghu´sam. vara and Cakrasam. vara here in keeping with the usual Tibetan trans lations, namely bDe mchog and ’Khor lo sdom pa; and this accords with se mantic analyses of these names and titles in the Sanskrit commentators. Thus Bhavabhat.t.a explains the second element of the second in the sense ‘he who re strains’ from the the verb sam. vr.-, and construes the whole to mean ‘he who by means of the wheel (cakra-) [of the Dharma] restrains [the minds of living be ings from the wrong path] (-sam. varah.)’ (*cakren. a sam. vr.not¯ıti cakrasam. varah.), telling us further that the name is extended to the Tantra because this de ity is its subject.389 As for the form Sam ´. vara, that too is widely supported. 

387 It is not probable that the Laghu´sam. vara was alone among the Yogin¯ıtantras in being of east-Indian origin. We see the same tell-tale B- for V- in 1.4.27–28 of the Catus. p¯ıt.ha, the Mantra syllables VAD. AVE being encoded there as BAD. ABE. More over, it is probable that the Apabhram. sa seen in some verses of the ´ Hevajra is of the eastern variety. This is suggesred by the nom. sg. endings -aho and -aha in kibid. aho in 2.4.6 and hut ¯asanaha in 2.4.67; see TAGARE 1987, p. 110–111. An investigation of the language of the Apabhram. sa verses that are found in such Yogin ´ ¯ıtantras as the Hevajra, Khasama, Catus. p¯ıt.ha, and D.¯ak ¯arn. ava, in comparison with that of the Doh ¯a collections of Kan¯ . ha and Saraha, may be expected to shed more light on this question of provenance.

[by keeping it free of all defects]’.391 This line of analysis, which applies a meaning of ´sam that is well-attested in non-sectarian lexicography,392 is not the invention of these commentators. They draw on the authority of the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga, which refers to its deity Vajrasattva as Sam ´. vara and explains that name as meaning ‘[he who has/is the] Highest Bliss’.393 That the -sam´ . vara form is not only old but also original is established

by evidence outside the Buddhist corpus. For Yogin¯ıjala ¯ sam´ . vara is found as the name of a Bhairava in one of the secondary Kalpas taught in the S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ Picumata,394 which, as we shall see, was a major unacknowledged source for the redactor of the Laghu´sam. vara. That the form intended there is -sam´ . vara rather than -sam. vara- is certain, because the text provides a semantic analysis that takes the first syllable to mean bliss (sukham).395 

However, these are not the only views. Jayabhadra, commenting on 1.2 of the Laghu´sam. vara, takes the same expression to be D.¯akin¯ıj ¯alasam. vara, un derstanding it to refer to the Laghu´sam. vara itself and explaining it as ‘The Concealment of the Array of D. akin ¯ ¯ıs’, deriving the last element of the com pound from sam. vr.- ‘to envelop’;396 and while the Tibetans usually render the 

The first Pada is also supported by Bhavabhat ¯ .t.a, who quotes it without attribu tion, when explaining d.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varam in Laghu´sam. vara 1.2: ´sam.sukham iti c ¯akhy ¯atam iti vacan ¯at. 

394 Yogin¯ıjala ¯ sam´ . vara in this text is a form of Bhairava and the term refers by extension to his Mantra and the associated system of practice (vratam). See Picumata f. 251r5–v1 (56.4c–6b): ´sr.n. u devi pravaks. y ¯ami sarvayogipras ¯adhanam | y ¯agamantrasamopetam. yogin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varam | yena vij ˜n ¯atam ¯atren. a trailokye khe car¯ıpadam | ¯as ¯adya kr¯ıd. ate mantr¯ı kulasiddhisamanvitah.‘Listen, O Dev¯ı. I shall teach you about Yogin¯ıjala ¯ sam´ . vara together with the deities with whom he is to be worshipped (y ¯aga-) and his Mantra, as the means of propitiating the Yogin¯ıs. As soon as the Mantra adept has mastered this he will reach the domain of the Khe car¯ıs and move freely through the triple universe, possessing [all] the supernatural powers of the [Yogin¯ı] clans’.

The ´sam. of -sam´ . vara means ‘bliss’ (sukham). The Yogin¯ıjala ¯ sam´ . vara[mantra] is so named because it is the bestower (-vara) of that bliss, [-vara- being formed as an agent noun from the verb vr.- ‘to give’]. It is the granter of this bliss to the Yogin¯ıjala in as much as it is located in the inner state ¯ of *the Yoga of the Yogesvar ´ ¯ıs, the plurality of these being intended in the sense of their totality (conj.). The Mantra of Bhairava [that bears this name] is infinite [in its power]’.

Cakra- name ’Khor lo sdom pa and so support the form Cakrasam. vara, we also find ’Khor lo bde mchog in their translations, which supports the alternative Cakrasam´ . vara.397 

The reason for this inconstancy is evidently that ´sa and sa are both pro nounced as ´sa in Bengali, as they were in the Magadh ¯ ¯ı Prakrit of the drama tists.398 Consequently, instead of attempting to decide which form is correct we should recognize that for the east-Indian followers of this tradition there was in effect only one word here (´sam. vara/sam. vara), which could be understood either as ‘the highest (-vara- [Tib. mchog]) bliss (´sam [Tib. bde])’ or as ‘fusion’ and the like by derivation from the verbal root vr. preceded by the preverb sam. That this was the case is demonstrated by a passage in the Sam. varodaya in which the two semantic analyses, explaining ´sam. vara- and sam. vara- respectively, are given for one and the same word.399 

S´ AM. VARA/VAJRARUDRA AND VAJRAVAR¯ AH¯ ¯I: THE TRANSFORMATION OF BHAIRAVA AND HIS CONSORT. What marks the new start seen in the Yogin¯ı tantras is a far more comprehensive adoption of the practices of the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha texts, to the extent that there is little in the observances of these texts that does not draw on that source. Heruka is now paired with a lustful consort (Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı in the Cakrasam. vara texts and Nairatmy ¯ a in those of ¯ Hevajra), and in the case of the Cakrasam. vara tradition, so are the principal Yogin¯ıs of his retinue, a feature that matches the practice of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha’s Picumata (Brahmay ¯amala). Moreover, in the case of the tradition elaborated on 

the basis of the Laghu´sam. vara the icon of Heruka has several blatantly obvious features of the iconography of Siva (/Bhairava) in addition to those manifest in ´ 

in the three circuits [of the Man. d. ala of Cakrasam. vara], sam. varah. being derived from the verb sam. vr.- ‘to conceal’ in the sense of the action of concealing’. 397 In the DT ’khor lo sdom pa (cakrasam. vara-) occurs about 250 times and ’khor lo bde mchog (cakra´sam. vara-) about 100; see, e.g., DT, Rgyud ’grel, vol. cha, f. 242v3 (’khor lo bde mchog gi gzugs can); vol. ja, f. 58v7 (’khor lo bde mchog gi rgyud), and f. 102r7 (’khor lo bde mchog gi sngags). 

398 See, for Magadh ¯ ¯ı, Vararuci, Pr ¯akr.taprak ¯a´sa 11.2: s. asoh.´sah.‘´s is used in place of both s. and s’. Generally in Middle and New Indo-Aryan the three Sanskrit sibilants have been reduced to s. It has been reported that in the Tantric Buddhist Doh ¯a texts, composed in what has been called Eastern Apabhram. sa, ´ ´s has been preserved in derivatives of words that have it in Sanskrit (TAGARE 1987, p. 77). It is true that a few such forms are found in the manuscripts (SHAHIDULLAH 1928, p. 37), but there are many cases in which ´s does not appear, such as sun. n. a for Skr. ´s ¯unya. It is likely that the occasional distinction between ´s and s was learned window-dressing and that both consonants were pronounced ´s.

the Heruka of the Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga. He is black-bodied, and has twelve arms and four faces, with three eyes in each. He stands in the warrior pose with a Vajra and a Vajra-topped bell in his two principal hands, holding the bleeding hide of a flayed elephant over his back with his two uppermost hands, and in the remaining eight a rattle-drum (d. amaruh.), a battle-axe, a chopping knife, and a trident, a skull-topped staff (khat.v ¯a ˙ngah.), a skull-bowl (kap ¯alam) filled with blood, a lasso (p ¯a´sah.), and the severed head of the god Brahma, ¯ wearing a long garland of fifty bleeding human heads around his neck, adorned with five ornaments of human bone and the ash of cremation-pyres smeared over his limbs—these, the bone ornaments and ash, are the Six Mudras of the ¯ Kap¯ alikas—, with a tiger skin around his waist, a brahmanical cord in the ¯ form of a snake (n ¯agayaj ˜nopav¯ıtah.), and a chaplet of skulls (kap ¯alam ¯al ¯a) above his forehead, his hair arranged in a high crown-like mass of ascetic’s braids (jat.¯amukut.ah.) adorned at the front with two crossed Vajras (vi´svavajram) and the new moon. His consort Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı stands before him in sexual union, with Heruka holding her to his chest with the hands that hold the Vajra and the Vajra-bell crossed at the wrists behind her back. She is red, one-faced, and two-armed, naked but for a filigree of fragments of human bone adorning her hips (asthimekhal ¯a), her right arm raised aloft holding a chopping-knife, with her index finger extended in a gesture of threatening the wicked, and her left arm, wrapped around Heruka’s neck, holding to their mouths a skull bowl full of human blood and entrails, wearing a garland of fifty desiccated heads and the five Kap¯ alika bone-ornaments, laughing, and intoxicated by lust. They are sur- ¯ rounded by a retinue of thirty-six goddesses termed Yogin¯ıs, D. akin ¯ ¯ıs, V¯ıresvar ´ ¯ıs, or V¯ırin.¯ıs visualized in the same Kap¯ alika style, in concentric circuits of four, ¯ twenty-four, and eight, the twenty-four embracing V¯ıra consorts and worshipped as residing in twenty-four sacred sites covering the whole subcontinent, from Ud. d.iyana in the north to R ¯ ame ¯ svara at India’s southern tip, from Sindhu in ´ the west to Dev¯ıkot.t.a in the east. The whole is surrounded by a ring of eight cremation grounds.400 

The features of Siva’s iconography evident here are the trident, the third ´ eye, the new moon on the piled up braids, the tiger-skin lower garment, the multiple faces and arms, the skull-bowl, the skull-staff, the bleeding elephant hide, the severed head of Brahma, the snake as brahmanical thread, the sharp ¯ fangs, the chaplet of skulls, his dwelling in the cremation grounds, and the ashes

Siva’s trident appears on seals ´ and intaglios during the Kus.an¯ . a and Kus.an¯ . o-Sassanian periods in Gandhara ¯ and Afghanistan.401 The third eye appears in sculptures of Siva from Mathur ´ a¯ 

around the beginning of the third century; and the ascetic’s piled braids and the new moon upon them appear there and elsewhere from the beginning of the fifth;402 and all these characteristics, the trident in his hand, the third eye, the ascetic’s braids, and the new moon, are mentioned in the Mah ¯abh ¯arata,403 as are his tiger-skin, his multiple faces and arms, his skull-bowl, his skull-staff, his brahmanical thread in the form of a snake, his sharp fangs, his garland of skulls, and his living in the cremation grounds smeared with ashes from its funeral pyres.404 His wearing a bleeding elephant hide is also a commonplace by that time, being mentioned along with his crematorial characteristics in the works of the poet Kalid ¯ asa. ¯405 As for the severed head of Brahma, this too derives from ¯ a well-known Saiva myth which though not found in the ´ Mah ¯abh ¯arata in the text common to all the regional versions,406 does appear in the Skandapur ¯an. a

Ambik ¯akhan. d. a,407 probably composed in the sixth or perhaps the first half of the seventh century.408 Other features in addition to these, namely the garland of severed or desiccated heads, the chopping knife, the rattle-drum, the Kap¯ alika ¯ bone-ornaments, the consort, the skull-bowl full of blood and entrails, the retinue of Yogin¯ıs, their pairing with V¯ıra consorts, the sacred sites, the theriocephalic gate-guardians, and the encircling cremation grounds, are commonplaces of the iconography of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha texts. Only the Vajras place a Buddhist seal on the icon. 

The image, then, has every appearance of representing a Buddhist trans formation of Siva himself in his Bhairava aspect. Indeed in his commentary on ´ 

the Laghu´sam. vara Jayabhadra refers to this Heruka as Vajrarudra, that is to say, as Siva/Bhairava converted and liberated by assimilation into the essence of ´ Buddha-hood,409 thereby definitively surrendering and transcending his Saiva ´ identity. In clear expression of this transcendence Heruka/Vajrarudra and Va jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı are depicted and visualized standing on the sprawling, terrified bodies of a black Bhairava and a red, emaciated Kalar ¯ atri, their own pre-Buddhist iden- ¯ tities as the principal deities of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha.410

Vajrarudra’s is the sentiment of ter- ´ ror (bhay ¯anakarasah.) and it is probable therefore that we should understand Vajra rudra to be Heruka.

THE RISE OF THE GODDESS TO INDEPENDENCE. Here Heruka’s consort is visibly his dependent: while he has four faces and twelve arms she has only one and two. But in the subsequent development of this tradition we find a strongly S´ akta tendency to elevate her to equality with Heruka and eventually to superi- ¯ ority, just as occurred in the development of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha.411 Thus in certain other Kalpas in which Heruka is united with Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı at the centre of the Man. d. ala her status is raised by endowing her with four faces and four or more arms. This is the case in the Kalpa of the sixth Pat.ala of the Abhidh ¯anottara, which teaches what it calls the ekav¯ıravidh ¯anam, the procedure in which the two deities alone are worshipped as ‘solitary heroes’ (ekav¯ıra-), that is to say, without the the retinue of the thirty-six Yogin¯ıs and twenty-four V¯ıras. Here Heruka has twelve arms and Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı four, holding a blood-filled skull-bowl, a chopping knife raised aloft with the gesture of threat, a rattle-drum, and a skull-staff. But both have four faces.412 In the seventh Pat.ala a two-faced, six-armed Vajrasattva transforms into a six-faced, twelve-armed Heruka Manjuvajramah ˜ asukha ac- ¯ companied by a Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı who has the same number of faces and arms and holds the same attributes in her hands. Brahma’s severed head is absent here, ¯ but Brahma himself is not: his flayed skin takes the place of the elephant hide; ¯ and in place of a tiger skin we see that of Bhairava.413 We see the same equality in the tenth Pat.ala, where both Heruka and Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı are five-faced and ten

The literature also teaches Kalpas in which Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı is worshipped in her own right in the centre of a circuit or circuits of Yogin¯ıs. She may be one-faced and two-armed, as when she is worshipped as Heruka’s consort, standing in the warrior pose at the centre of the circle of the eight cremation grounds, naked, red and menstruating, her face contorted with anger, with large fangs, three red eyes, wearing a chaplet of five skulls framed by two rows of Vajras, with crossed Vajras on her unbound hair, wearing a garland of fifty heads, which are not desiccated, as they are when she is Heruka’s consort, but, like his, freshly severed and dripping blood. She holds aloft a red Vajra in her left hand with her index extended, a skull-bowl full of blood in her right, and a long white skull staff resting in the crook of her left arm, She may possess, as before, only the first five of the six Mudras; but some emphasized her pre-eminence by requiring that ¯ since she is now the central deity of the Man. d. ala she should also be smeared with ashes. She is surrounded by the thirty-six Yogin¯ıs, disposed as in the Man. d. ala of Heruka, but with the difference that the Yogin¯ıs, like her, wear garlands of freshly severed heads,417 or by only the inner circuit of four, or with no retinue

There are other forms of this kind, among which one is particulary worthy of note because it shows her four-faced and twelve-armed like Heruka himself, his equal as it were or, rather, the fusion of both within her, since her fanged face is divided down the middle into a male half on her right and a female half on her left (ardhan ¯ar¯ı´svaramukh ¯a), a S´ akta reflex of the well-known Ardhan ¯ ar¯ ¯ısvara ´ image of Siva. She has the same hand-attributes as the twelve-armed Heruka ´ except that the battle-axe and trident have gone, an elephant-goad has taken the latter’s place. The hand that held the skull-staff now holds the skull-bowl, the skull-staff rests in the crook of that arm, and the two hands that are now free form the flame gesture (jv ¯al ¯amudr ¯a) on her forehead. The place of the elephant hide is taken by the flayed skin of a man. She holds the Vajra and bell in her crossed principal hands and turns them over each other in the gesture known as the revolving lotus (kamal ¯avartah.). She is red, naked, and intoxicated with pas sion, adorned with all six Mudras, the new moon and crossed Vajras on her hair, ¯ a chaplet of skulls above her forehead, and the bone-filigree around her hips. She dances wildly in the centre of her retinue, visualized at the moment that she stands with her left leg on the ground flexed at the knee and her right foot raised and placed on the inside of her left thigh with the right knee turned out. She is surrounded by the thirty-six Yogin¯ıs with the addition of the four goddesses Mamak ¯ ¯ı, Locana, T ¯ ar¯ a, and P ¯ an¯ . d. aravasin of the ¯ Guhyasam ¯aja Yogottara sys tem. The four innermost goddesses have the heads of a lion, sow, elephant, and horse, and hold in their four hands the skull-bowl, skull-staff, head of Brahma, ¯ and chopping-knife. Outside them are the four Yogottara goddesses, each at the centre of a lotus with six petals, six-armed and adorned with the six Mudras. ¯ They hold in one of their two principal hands the symbol of the Tathagata-family ¯ to which each belongs (a Vajra, a wheel, two crossed Vajras, and a lotus respec tively) and in the other a bell, turning them over each other. In the other hands they hold a skull-bowl, the head of Brahma, and a rattle-drum, with a skull-staff ¯ in the crook of the principal left arm. The twenty-four Yogin¯ıs of the sacred sites are placed in groups of six on the petals of these lotuses. They are four-armed, and hold the symbol of the Tathagata-family of the Yogottara goddess on whose ¯ lotus they are placed, a skull-bowl, a skull-staff, and a rattle-drum. They wear chaplets of skulls and show only five of the six seals. Like the central goddess they are half male and half female (ardhan ¯ar¯ı´svaryah.). All the goddesses in the Man. d. ala up to this point are naked and dancing. Outside them is the final circuit of eight Yogin¯ıs. The four in the four doors of the Man. d. ala, with the heads of a

crow, owl, dog, and sow, stand naked in the warrior-pose, dwarfish, with squint ing eyes. The four in the corners have the heads of a buffalo, an ass, a camel, and a horse, and like all but the door-guardians, are visualized in the dance posture. All eight of these outer Yogin¯ıs have the five Mudras and chaplets of skulls, and ¯ are four-armed, holding a skull-bowl, the head of Brahma in their left hands, and ¯ a chopping-knife and rattle-drum in their right. 419 

The cult of the independent goddess (Bhagavat¯ı) appears to have been a particularly vigorous development, to judge from the exceptionally large number of variant forms that emerged.420 Within the earlier scriptural lit erature the Abhidh ¯anottara contains several sections devoted to Sadhanas of ¯ Vajravar¯ ahi; ¯421 in the Heruk ¯abhyudaya eleven of its forty-four chapters are devoted to her Mantras and their procedures;422 and the section of the Tenjur devoted to the Cakrasam. vara cycle (Toh. 1403–1606) contains over sixty texts ¯ devoted to the varieties of her cult as Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı or Vajrayogin¯ı (Toh. 1541– ¯ 1606). S´ akyaraks ¯ .ita, a pupil of Abhayakaragupta (1064–1125), after detailing ¯ the Sadhana of several of her forms in his ¯ Abhisamayama ˜njar¯ı,423 adds that these are but a few of the many that were current in his time:424 

So it should be understood that in accordance with the various mentalities of those requiring to be trained there are countless traditions of the Goddess such as this, transmitted through the generations from teacher to pupil in accordance with the [founding] instruction of various Siddhas. What I have shown here is no more than an indicative fraction of the whole. 

This S´ akta trend is also evidenced in the practice of the Newars of the Kath- ¯ mandu valley down modern times. For their ceremony of initiation before the Man. d. ala of Cakrasam. vara is followed on the final day by initiation before 

419 This form is taught in Abhidh ¯anottara ff. 63v1–70r4 (Pat.ala 9 in the enumera tion of this manuscript), from which it entered the V ¯ar ¯ahyabhyudaya. A lightly adjusted version of this Kalpa is found in the collection of Sadhanas of Va- ¯ jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı/Vajrayogin¯ı that came to bear the title Guhyasamayas ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a in the colophons of later manuscripts; see ENGLISH 2002, pp. 54–59. 

420 See ENGLISH 2002 for an illustrated survey of these variants. 

421 Pat.ala 12/9: Var¯ ah¯ ¯ı Vajrayogin¯ı (4-faced, 12-armed; ardhan ¯ar¯ı´svar¯ımukh ¯a); 22/19: Mr.tasam.j¯ıvan¯ı (4-faced or 8-faced, 16-armed); 36/33: Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı (3-faced and 6-armed or 6-faced and 12-armed, surrounded by Guhyottama etc.); 37/34: Va- ¯ jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı surrounded by Yamin ¯ ¯ı etc.

the Man. d. ala of Vajradev¯ı (Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı).425 Nor was this confined to the sub continent. In Tibet too Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı/Vajrayogin¯ı rose to a position of special honour, notably in the bKa’ brgyud and Sa skya traditions, but also in later times among the dGe lug pas, rNying ma pas, and Bon pos.426 

There are other compilations, scriptural and secondary, that survive in Nepalese manuscripts but did not reach Tibet, which attest her prominence in the last phase of the Mantranaya: the Vajrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ıkalpa, of about three thousand verses, which interweaves the D.¯ak ¯arn. ava and the Sam. varodaya, and incorporates thirteen non-scriptural Sadhana texts of Vajrav ¯ ar¯ ah¯ ¯ı and one of Nairatmy ¯ a, the consort of Hevajra; ¯427 the closely related Yogin¯ıj ¯ala, of about one thousand verses; and the collection of forty-six Sadhanas of ¯ Vajrayogin¯ı known as the Guhyasamayas ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a.428 Moreover, two texts devoted to the cult of this goddess were added to the canon of scripture re ceived by the Tibetans. The first is the V ¯ar ¯ahyabhyudayatantra, a short work of three hundred verses counted among the explanatory Tantras of the Laghu´sam. vara but consisting almost entirely of passages lifted from the Sam. put.odbhava, the Abhidh ¯anottara, and the Sam. varodaya;429 and the second 

425 GELLNER 1992, pp. 273–279. His account of the ceremonies is based upon what he was told by the late Asha Kaji Vajracharya (ibid., p. 273). That the Cakrasam. vara initiation is followed by a separate Vajradev¯ı initiation is confirmed by the evidence of the D¯ıks.¯avidhi, the manual in the Newari language that guides these rituals. 

426 See ENGLISH 2002, pp. xxii–xxvii. 

427 I have not yet undertaken a thorough analysis of the whole text. The interweav ing that I report is of D.¯ak ¯arn. ava, Pat.ala 2–3 and Sam. varodaya 2–3 in the first 3 Pat.alas. The nid ¯anav ¯akyam of the Sam. varodaya is borrowed with the substitution of v ¯ar ¯ah¯ıbhages.u for the Sam. varodaya’s yogin¯ıbhages.u. I have noted the incorpo ration of the following Sadhana texts (identified here with the numbers ascribed ¯ in BHATTACHARYA’s composite S ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a): 217–218 in Pat.ala 36, 219–225 in Pat.ala 37, 226–228 and 231 in Pat.ala 38. 

428 This is the title under which the work has been catalogued in TSUKAMOTO et al. 1989, p. 285. It is based, I surmise, on the colophon of the last Sadhana in the ¯ collection, the D.¯akin¯ıguhyasamayas ¯adhana of Anangayogin. ˙

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

is the Vidy ¯adhar¯ıkramavajrayogin¯ıs ¯adhana, which appears in the Kanjur (Toh. ¯ 380) between the major Tantras of the Cakrasam. vara cycle and those of con tested authenticity,430 included perhaps, in spite of its genre, because it states in its opening words that it is part of the otherwise unattested Mah ¯am ¯ay ¯aj ¯alo rdhvajat.ottaratantra, which, it claims, was extracted from the Trilaks. a, that it to say, from the vast mythical Ur-text of this cycle, the Trilaks.¯abhidh ¯ana.431 

Further evidence of this S´ akta trend is seen in the views of the tradition ¯ concerning the nature of the revelation of this Ur-text, which, it was claimed, contained the required Buddhist preamble (nid ¯anav ¯akyam) that is lacking in the Laghu´sam. vara itself. Bhavabhat.t.a, taking care not to claim direct access to that mythical source, saying only that his knowledge of its nid ¯anav ¯akyam has reached him through the lineage of his teachers (guruparampar ¯a),432 asserts that it reveals that the teacher of the Tantra was Bhagavan Mah ¯ avajradhara, ¯ the requester his consort Bhagavat¯ı Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı, and the reciter Vajrapan¯ .i. These then, it follows for Bhavabhat.t.a, are the dramatis personae of the Laghu´sam. vara too. But he reports a contrary view that Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı was the teacher and Mahavajradhara her pupil. ¯433 The imposition on the text of the claim that it is a dialogue between the deity and his goddess-consort brings it into line with the Saiva scriptural literature of the Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha. For there the Tantras take the form of Bhairava’s teachings in answer to the questions of the Goddess (Dev¯ı/Bhairav¯ı). In the explanatory Tantras of the Cakrasam. vara cycle this model is made explicit in the Vajrad.¯aka, where Vajrasattva/Vajrad. aka ¯ teaches in response to the questions of Dev¯ı, and in the D.¯ak ¯arn. ava and Va jrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ıkalpa, where V¯ıresvara responds to the questions of V ´ ¯ıresvar ´ ¯ı. But in the Caturyogin¯ısam. put.a, another of the satellite Tantras of this cycle, the goddess Vajrin.¯ı (Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı) is the teacher and Vajrin (Heruka) the ques tioner.434 That this inversion seen in the view reported by Bhavabhat.t.a and

Buddhist Sadhakas now carry the skull-bowl ( ¯ kap ¯alam) and skull-staff (khat.v ¯a ˙ngah.), and put on the Mudras of human bone and a brahmanical thread ¯ (yaj ˜nopav¯ıtam) made of the twisted hair of corpses or human sinew, and dust their bodies with ash.435

The pan-Indian topography of the S´ akta ¯ Saivas’ sacred sites, their P ´¯ıt.has, Ks.etras, Upaks.etras, Sam. dohas/Chandohas,436 and the like, is also adopted. Two lists of such sites are found: one in the Vajrad.¯aka and the other in the Laghu´sam. vara.437 Also adopted is the practice of visiting these sacred sites (p¯ıt.habhraman. am)438 in search of meetings with the Yogin¯ıs/D. akin ¯ ¯ıs that are

This followed in Y by a second verse: kap ¯alam atha khat.v ¯a ˙ngam upamudre prak¯ırtite | ¯abhir mudritadehas tu na bh ¯uya iha j ¯ayate ‘The skull-bowl and skull staff are called the sub-Mudras.

The six Mudras minus the ashes, that is to say, the ¯ five of the Buddhist lists, are defined, but not numbered, in Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 1, f. 139r1–3 (23.33–36b), in the order earrings, bracelets, hair-jewel, sa cred thread of human hair, and necklace: v¯ır ¯an.¯am. nr. pa´s ¯ard ¯ula tantre ’smin bhairav ¯arcite | ´subhra´sa ˙nkhe prakartavye dvya ˙ngule karn.ike ´subhe | *rucake (em. : caruke Cod.) dvya ˙ngule ´saste tury ¯a ˙ngus.t.h. ah.´sikh ¯aman.ih.| trivr.nnarakacotpannas tripa ˜ncasarikah.samah.| kan.t.h ¯aj jaghanasam.spar´s¯ı (*ja corr. : ja ˙n Cod.) ´sastah. pa ˜ncavat.o ’pi ca k suvr.ttaman.isam. gh ¯a*ta(corr. : tah.

The 80th chap ter of the Picumata describes, but does not number, (1) the hair-jewel, (2) earrings, (3) a necklace (kan.t.hamudr ¯a), (4) the sacred thread, and (5) ornaments of bone on hands, arms and hips. The last takes the place of the bracelets (rucake) listed elsewhere and in Vajrayanist texts ( ¯ Picumata ff. 311v-312r): c ¯ud.¯aman.ikap ¯alena ´sikh ¯ay ¯am. yo nive´sitah.| ¯ı´svaras tatra vij ˜neyo adhidevo var ¯anane | j ˜n ¯ana´saktih. kriy ¯akhy ¯a ca karn.ike parik¯ırtite | kan.t.he sthit ¯a tu y ¯a mudr ¯a aham.tatr ¯adhidevatam | rudro m ¯atr. gan. aih.s ¯ardham.j ˜n ¯atavyas tu var ¯anane | anant ¯a hy upav¯ıte tu ´saktih. sarv ¯adhvag ¯a par ¯a | hastab ¯ahukat.isthai´s ca vis.n. ur j ˜neyo ’dhidevatam | ´saktayo vividh ¯ak ¯ar ¯a jat.¯an ¯am adhidevatam | etan mah ¯arthadam. devi yo vij ¯an ¯ati tattvatah.| ´sivavat sa tu boddhavyo viruddh ¯acaran. o ’pi yah.. 

436 The Saiva term ´ sam. dohah.for one class of site consistently appears in Buddhist treatments in the form chandohah.(e.g. Laghu´sam. vara 50.22 and Hevajra 1.6.10). This substitution of initial ch- for s-/´s- is probably an east-Indianism; cf. Oriya cha ˜ncib ¯a < Skt. sam.cayati; Bengali ch ¯atu < Skt. saktuh.; Oriya ch ¯ac, chac ¯a < Skt. satya-; Bengali chut, Bengali and Oriya chut ¯a < Skt. s ¯utram; Oriya chan. a < Skt. ´san. ah.; Bengali ch ¯adl ¯a < Skt. ´s ¯advalam; and Bengali chikal, chikli < Skt. ´sr.˙nkhala-, ´sr.˙nkhalik ¯a.

means of assisting the dying and the dead—we have seen a ritualized realiza tion of this in the Mantranaya’s funeral ceremony taught by Padmasr´ ¯ımitra and S´unyasam ¯ adhi ¯446—; and the practice of transferring one’s consciousness out of one’s body to pass into and animate a corpse (parak ¯ayaprave´sah.).447 

Nor is the adoption of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha’s practices restricted to externals. It also extended into the domain of Yoga. For one of the most striking features that distinguish the Yogin¯ıtantras from the Yogatantras and indeed from all that pre ceded them in the history of Buddhism is that they based their inner practice on the theory that the body is pervaded and sustained by a network of energy channels (n ¯ad.¯ı), variously numbered, with three pre-eminent: two vertical lat eral channels, lalan ¯a and rasan ¯a, and a hidden third extending between up the centre of the body to the head, called avadh ¯ut¯ı or can. d.¯al¯ı, with Cakras located along its course, which was to be awakened and perceived as the means of access to the bliss (sahaj ¯anandah., mah ¯asukham) of enlightened awareness. This Yoga of meditation on the channels of the vital energy and the Cakras is not found in the transitional Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga448 nor indeed in the Laghu´sam. vara,

For Tsong kha pa’s detailed treatment of this practice of ascent from the body see MULLIN 1996, pp. 209–215. His sources are those Tantras listed here: the Catus. p¯ıt.ha (and Bhavabhat.t.a’s com mentary), the Vajrad.¯aka, the Sam. put.a (= Sam. put.odbhava), and the Sam. varodaya. MULLIN translates the Tibetan rendering of these titles into English. He identifies his ‘Mystic Kiss Tantra’ as the Caturyogin¯ısam. put.a. It is in fact the Sam. put.a, the work that also appears in this translation as the Sambhuta Tantra, reproducing a faulty Tibetan transcription of the same title. Tsong kha pa notes that this prac tice of ascent from one’s body (utkr ¯antih.) is a unique feature of the highest (bla na med) Buddhist Tantra class (MULLIN 1996, p. 209). That is so within the Buddhist Tantras; but the source of the practice is the Saiva tradition, whose texts have al- ´ ways placed a great emphasis on it both in the Atimarga and in the Mantram ¯ arga; ¯ see P ¯a´supatas ¯utra 5.30–40; Pamp ¯am ¯ah ¯atmya 11.54–71 (explaining that pas sage); Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a, Adhy ¯aya 182; Rauravas ¯utrasam. graha, Pat.ala 9; S ¯ardhatri´satik ¯alottara 11.13–19b; Dvi´satika-K ¯alottara ff. 2v9–3r6; Tray oda´sa´satika-K ¯alottara ff. 30r9–31r7; Kiran. a, Pat.ala 59; Mata ˙ngap ¯arame´svara, Cary ¯ap ¯ada, Pat.ala 9; Picumata, Pat.ala 100; M ¯alin¯ıvijayottara 17.25–33; Tantrasadbh ¯ava f. 36r11–v10 (9.294–321); Tantr ¯aloka 28.292–302; and, in Java/Bali, J ˜n ¯anasiddh ¯anta, chapters 3, 5–7, and 20.

but it is much developed in the latter’s ancillary scriptures such as the Vajrad.¯aka and Sam. varodaya, and elsewhere in the Yogin¯ıtantras, notably in the Hevajra, the Sam. put.odbhava, the Mah ¯amudr ¯atilaka, and the K ¯alacakra.449 

The elements of this model are ‘purifed through equation’ (vi´suddha-) with Buddhist soteriological factors, either newly acquired, such as the twenty-four sacred sites or long established in the Mahay¯ ana, such as the three bodies of ¯ a Buddha (nirm ¯an. ak ¯ayah., sam. bhogak ¯ayah., and dharmak ¯ayah.), equated with the three principal channels, and Means (up ¯ayah.) and Wisdom (praj ˜n ¯a), whose co-functioning (yuganaddhav ¯ahit ¯a) is the way to liberation, equated with the lateral pair.450 But the basic conception is derived from the Yoga of the Saivas in ´ general and the S´ akta ¯ Saivas in particular. ´ 

THE INCORPORATION OF TEXT-PASSAGES FROM THE VIDYAP¯ ¯IT. HA. In the light of this evidence of the pervasive similarities between the Yogin¯ıtantras and the Saivism of the Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha, and considering the fact that these similarities set the Yogin¯ıtantras apart from all earlier forms of Buddhism, the reader will not be surprised to know that there is also evidence that this tradition incorporated 

449 That the Yoga of the energy channels was one of the principal features that distin guished the Yogin¯ıtantras was asserted by the learned of the Mantranaya itself; see Sraddh ´ akaravarman cited here on p.239; also Mkhas grub rje, ¯ rGyud spyi, p. 256, ll. 6–7: phung khams skye mched kyi rnam dag gtso bor ston pa’s rgyud yin na pha rgyud | rtsa’i rnam dag gtso bor ston pa ma rgyud ‘If a Tantra principally teaches the purification of the Skandhas, Dhatus, and ¯ Ayatanas it is a Father Tantra. A Mother ¯ Tantra principally teaches the purification of the energy channels’. In this pas sage the distinction is between the esoteric Yogatantras (Mahayogatantras, Yogot- ¯ taratantras) headed by the Guhyasam ¯aja and the Yogin¯ıtantras or Yoganiruttara tantras exemplified by the Tantras of Sam ´. vara and Hevajra, the two divisions of what the Tibetans called bla med kyi rgyud ‘the unsurpassed Tantra [class]’. Mkhas grub rje’s tradition rejects this criterion for distinguishing between the two divi sions on the grounds that there are Yogin¯ıtantras (Mother Tantras) that also teach the purification of the Skandhas and the rest. That is true. We find this, for exam ple, in the Hevajra (1.7.12; 1.9.6–9, 13–14; 2.2.31–36) and the Abhidh ¯anottara (e.g. B ff. 20v5–21r1; f. 26r3; f. 36r3–v6; f. 51r3–4; ff. 69v2–70r1). But that is because the second-wave Yogin¯ıtantras sought to encompass the tradition of the Guhyasam ¯aja by incorporating many of its elements. He does not, we may note, support his argu ment by pointing to the presence of the purification of the energy channels in any Father Tantra. From the historian’s point of view the distinction that he rejects remains accurate in spite of his objections. VAN SCHAIK (2008, p. 50) has noted the absence of material on the manipulation of the internal energies in the Dunhuang manuscripts, which represent Tantric Buddhism up to about the middle of the ninth century. 

450 For a comprehensive listing of ‘purifying equations’ for the principal channels and four Cakras (the Nirman¯ . acakra at the root of the navel, the Dharmacakra in the heart, the Sam. bhogacakra in the throat, and the Mahasukhacakra in the head) see ¯ J ˜n ¯anodayatantra, p. 6, ll. 1–14 (the four Cakras), and p. 6, l. 20–p. 7, l. 9 (the three channels).

and adapted much textual material from the Saiva scriptures in the process of ´ producing its own. 

This is particularly evident in the case of the Laghu´sam. vara and its satellites. I have reported and tabulated elsewhere correspondences with passages in five Saiva scriptures: (1) the ´ Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara of the third S. at.ka of the Jayadrathay ¯amala,451 (2) the short redaction of the Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata— a much longer redaction, known to Abhinavagupta, has not come down to us—, (3) the Tantrasadbh ¯ava, (4) the Picumata (/Brahmay ¯amala), and (5) the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara, all of which are texts of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha. There are also a few correspondences with earlier texts of the Buddhist Mantranaya;452 but unlike those the Laghu´sam. vara’s parallels with the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha are not short passages of one or two verses but detailed and continuous expositions that run in two cases over several chapters, amounting in all to some 200 verses out of a total of 

451 The Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara, though it comes to us as part of the Jayadrathay ¯amala, has very probably been incorporated from another source. This is evident from the reg ister of its Sanskrit, from its style, and from its content. This source may be a text closely related to the lost Yogin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara. For it claims at its beginning to be about to explain what has already been taught in that Tantra. Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 3, f. 169r8 (Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara 1.1–6b): devy uv ¯aca k pur ¯a tu sam´.vare tantre yad uktam. parame´svara | *tan na (em. : tatra Cod.) j ˜n ¯atam. may ¯a deva guhyatantrasya vistar ¯at k 2 katham.sa bhairavo dehas tvayi deva mah ¯abalah.| katham. devyo yajanty enam. kul ¯as t ¯as ¯am. kati smr.t ¯ah.k 3 katham. kramam. mah ¯ag ¯ud. ha<m. > c ¯aram.t ¯as ¯am. katham. vibho | carusiddhih. katham.t ¯as ¯am etan me br ¯uhi vistaram k 4 evam ¯akarn. ya deve´sy ¯avadan ¯amburuhacyutam | vacomr.tam. mah ¯adevo bh ¯uyo vacanam abrav¯ıt k 5 s ¯adhu s ¯adhu mah ¯abhage sarvaj ˜n ¯an ¯arthabh ¯ajane | mah ¯arahasyam atulam. yo gin¯ıc ¯aram uttamam k 6 pravaks. y ¯ami sam ¯asena ´sr.n. us. v’ ek ¯agram ¯anas ¯a ‘The goddess said: Paramesvara, I have not understood the teaching that you gave of old in the ´ Sam´.varatantra, because of the great length of [that] esoteric text.

about 700 with some prose equivalent in length to about 80 more. They teach the characteristics by which the initiate may recognize women as belonging to various classes of Yogin¯ı, D. akin ¯ ¯ı, and Lam¯ a, and vocabularies of special ¯ words and gestures (chomm ¯ah.) for communicating with them when encountered (Pat.alas 15–24), the rules (samay ¯ah.) that bind initiates as they engage in post-initiatory cary ¯a (Pat.alas 26–29), the system of P¯ıt.has and other sacred pilgrimage centres for wandering ascetics engaged in this practice (Pat.ala 41), and the characteristics of the ideal sacrificial victim known as a sapt ¯avartah. or saptajanm ¯a (Pat.ala 49).453 

These parallels demonstrate a high degree of overlap with the Saiva ´ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha in the parts of the text and its satellites that deal with the religious discipline (samay ¯ac ¯arah.) of the adherents of this form of Buddhism. Still lacking, however, was evidence of textual dependence in those parts that deal with that discipline’s ritual core. But that gap can now be closed. For since publishing those results I have located further evidence in what survives of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha’s scriptures that this corpus was also the source of substantial parts of the Laghu´sam. vara’s instruction in this domain. The areas of prescription in which this textual dependence has emerged are (1) the daily worship of the ‘Kulika’ prescribed in the first chapter of the ¯ Laghu´sam. vara, (2) the ceremony of initiation before the Man. d. ala through which a candidate becomes qualified and obliged to practice the Tantra’s rites and observance, which is taught from the end of the first chapter to the beginning of the fourth; and (3) the ritual procedures for supernatural effects, mostly hostile sorcery, that form a considerable part of the work and take the form of fire-sacrifices (homah.), and the use of the Mantras and the name of the target (s ¯adhyan ¯ama) to empower substances in various ways and combinations to bring about these results. These new parallels are as follows: 

1. The worship of the Kulika: ¯ Laghu´sam. vara 1.4–7b (< Heruk ¯abhyudaya 15.6–10) < Picumata 84.9c–16. 

2. The initiation ceremony: Laghu´sam. vara 1.15–4.1 < 8.3–28 of the Yo gin¯ısam.c ¯ara. 

3. The ritual procedures for supernatural effects: 

（a）Laghu´sam. vara, Pat.ala 34 < Picumata 41.1–3, 49.3c–4c, 41.4–7b, 41.12abc, and 41.15d. 

（b）Laghu´sam. vara, Pat.ala 35 < Picumata 26.1–2b, 26.41c–44.

（c）Laghu´sam. vara, Pat.ala 36 < Picumata 26.45c–48b. 

（d）Laghu´sam. vara, Pat.ala 37 < Picumata 29.1ab, 30.1, 29.35, 29.38–48b, 29.50 [cf. 20.56–57], 29.61ab.

Comparison of the textual parallels reveals that it is the Cakrasam. vara cor pus that has adopted and adapted the Saiva sources rather than the other way ´ 

round. For the Buddhist versions abound in instances in which it can be seen that Saiva material has been misunderstood, crudely, artificially, and incom- ´ pletely modified, or rendered contextually incongruous. The Saiva versions, on ´ the other hand, seem to me to be entirely free of signs of textual dependence on Buddhist originals. 

Before proceeding to demonstrate this through the presentation and analy sis of examples I wish first to address an objection that has been raised against my conclusion.454 I do so before my analysis because that objection, if it were valid, would block in advance the force of all my evidence, being based not on contrary analyses of particular parallels but on a perceived characteristic of all the materials I have identified. This characteristic is that the Buddhist versions are less clear in meaning, less grammatically correct. By concluding that the direction of redaction is from Saiva materials to the Buddhist in spite of this ´ characteristic I am held to have overlooked or violated the textual critic’s maxim lectio difficilior potior ‘The more difficult reading is to be preferred’. This maxim means that when one is confronted by two readings, both of which are plausible, one should prefer that which is less easily explained as the result of the alter ation, accidental or deliberate, of the other, provided there is a clearly established line of transmission between the sources of the divergent readings. Thus, it is implied, the less clear and more incorrect Buddhist versions should be judged to have preceded the clearer and more correct Saiva versions on the grounds that it ´ is conceivable that a Saiva redactor revised a deficient Buddhist version but not ´ that a Buddhist spoiled a superior Saiva version. ´ 455 

What exactly the concept of lack of clarity is thought to cover in this argu 

454 DAVIDSON 2002, p. 386, n. 105; and GRAY 2005, p. 8, n. 19. 

455 In fact it is not clear whether these authors think that the application of this princi ple means that the Buddhist versions cannot be secondary or only that it less likely that they are. The second alternative alone would accord with a more fundamental principle of textual criticism, namely that there are no hard-and-fast rules because every textual problem must be regarded as possibly unique (HOUSMAN 1921, pp. 68–69). 

[[189]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

ment is unclear; but I assume that the authors had in mind not merely gram matical deviations from the Paninian standard of high scholarship, since those are seldom difficult to understand, being characteristic of a particular register of the language, but also and principally lack of clarity in meaning caused by syntactical incoherence and the like, which is indeed a conspicuous defect in the Buddhist versions. Indeed they are sometimes barely intelligible, as is revealed by fact that the commentators confronted by these passages offer widely diver gent but equally arbitary interpretations.456 

Now, the objection that a version which is less clear in this sense must have preceded one that is freer of these defects, proceeds from a serious misunder standing of how the rule of the lectio difficilior is to be applied. Firstly, like all other ‘rules’ of textual criticism, it should never be put to work mechanically and in advance, without the application of thought to the weighing of probabilities in each case; and secondly, it should never be invoked to give precedence to readings that are grammatically defective, incoherent, or contextually awkward.457 Lack of clarity is hardly likely to the fault of the original framers of the text-passages, who, after all, probably knew what they wanted to say in whatever register of Sanskrit they chose to adopt. It is much more likely to be the result of incompe tence and/or carelessness on the part of Buddhist redactors who had difficulty in understanding the Saiva texts they were cannibalizing. ´ 

The secondary status of the Buddhist versions is also apparent in another deficiency: their greater metrical irregularity. In principle that might be ex plained either as the result of the Saivas’ having polished the Buddhist versions ´ or as the result of indifference to the preservation of metrical form on the part of Buddhist redactors as they adapted metrically correct Saiva materials. But the ´ latter explanation is much to be preferred. For, as we shall see, metrical irreg ularity is particularly noticeable in the Buddhist versions at those places where the imprint of Buddhism is apparent.458 

Let us assume, however, that there are indeed readings in the Buddhist ver sions which do not derive from the Saiva parallels that I have identified. Would ´ these not refute my conclusion that the Buddhist versions are secondary? No. For 

456 See here p. 216. 

457 This point has been made against DAVIDSON and GRAY by SZANT ´ O´ (2008b, p. 218). On the principle invoked here, that a ‘more difficult reading’ must be plausible, see WEST 1973, p. 51: “When we choose the ‘more difficult reading’ . . . we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more difficult reading and a more unlikely reading”; CHADWICK 1957, p. 255: “The principle lectio difficilior potior does not extend to nonsense, . . . ”. 

458 See here p. 207. 

[[190]]

the inference that they would rests on the assumption that I consider that the Saiva text-passages redacted into the Buddhist versions were ´ exactly those seen in these parallels. In fact I hold that the collation of these parallels with the Bud dhist passages demonstrates that the former are, in most cases at least, closely related variants of the passages on which the Buddhist redactors drew, and that these passages were accessed in what were probably earlier and less elaborate redactions of the works in which I have found the parallels, or else in texts of the same corpus which are now out of reach, such as the Yogin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara, the Sarvav¯ırasam ¯ayoga, the long version of the Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata, and the Pa ˜nc ¯amr.ta.459 For what survives in the manuscript collections of India and Nepal is only a part of what once existed, as we learn both from citations of other texts in the works of learned Saiva commentators and from the surviv- ´ ing scriptural redactions themselves, which, when listing the canon of texts to which they belong, mention many works, such as those mentioned above, which have not survived or await discovery.460 My argument, then, is not that these Saiva parallels are the direct sources of the Buddhist versions but only that the ´ Saiva parallels are close enough to the Buddhist versions to reveal the direction ´ 

459 On these sources see SANDERSON 2007, pp. 234–237, footnotes 15–16, and 21–22. 460 See, for example, the list of Tantras ‘venerated by the circle of Yogin¯ıs’ given in the first chapter of the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara as sources on the matters it covers (Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 3, ff.

of dependence. It is possible, therefore, that any ‘more difficult readings’ were in herited from this earlier stratum in the development of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha; and this mere possibility is sufficient to invalidate the inference of the priority of the Bud dhist versions. If I am mistaken in my conclusion that the Buddhist versions are secondary that will have to be demonstrated by presenting a persuasive contrary analysis of the relationship between the Saiva and Buddhist versions based on a ´ detailed examination of the particulars I have identified. General arguments of this kind, which attempt to settle the matter in advance without engaging with the specifics of the parallels, will not suffice.461 

Having dealt with this objection I can now turn to the evidence. In advance of a more thoroughgoing demonstration I consider a few passages here that re veal that the Buddhist redactors were using Saiva materials and enable us to ´ see how they did so. 

I have mentioned the entry into the Cakrasam. vara corpus of two lists of S´ akta sacred sites. That found in the ¯ Vajrad.¯aka, ff. 42r1–43v3 (18.10–60) cor responds very closely in the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha to Ni´sisam.c ¯ara, ff. 16v–19v (4.6b–5.11), both in content and wording. The passage lists twenty-four sacred sites and identifies for each its presiding goddess, the high Tantric goddess to whose family she is assigned, her weapon (¯ayudham), the site’s sacred tree, and a guardian Bhairava (ks.etrap ¯alah.).462 The version in the Vajrad.¯aka leaves 

461 The same applies to a line of defence that objects to my conclusion in a manner that renders even a non-specific engagement with the parallels unnecessary. Confronted with the information that such parallels have been claimed some are inclined to respond with the question “Why would Buddhists have drawn on Saiva sources?” ´ The question is purely rhetorical and somewhat plaintive, implying that since the authors of these texts were Buddhists they would surely not have drawn on non Buddhist scriptures. The inference has no force at all, because it invokes a notion of the nature of Buddhism and consequently of what Buddhists can or cannot have done that is derived from texts other than those of this corpus. No amount of evi dence that other Buddhist scriptures were free of dependence on non-Buddhist texts can counter evidence that these Buddhist scriptures were not. 

462 Closely related to the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara text is a version seen in Kubjik ¯amata 22.23– 46, which lacks one of its elements, namely the specification of the high Tantric goddesses to whose families these local goddesses belong. Another, somewhat di vergent and giving the sites alone and the points on the body that should be empowered by them through ny ¯asah., appears in the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha’s M ¯adhavakula (Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 4, f. 124r1–5 [K ¯alik ¯akule p ¯uj ¯anirn. ayah., vv. 16–22 (fol lowed in Tantr ¯aloka 29.59–63 (TA): parts of a Kashmirian redaction of the text ¯ are cited in Tantr ¯alokaviveka on these verses (TAV)]; the procedure of the ¯ ny ¯asah. is put in Paddhati form in K ¯al¯ıkulakram ¯arcana, f. 22r5–v5 [KKK]): at.t.ah ¯asam. ´sikh ¯asth ¯ane caritram.ca karandhrake | *kulagiryam.(corr. : kullagirye Cod.) priye *karn.e (corr. : karn. n. am.

this Saiva pantheon and its ancillaries intact, the only major deviation being ´ that it has four sites that differ from those in the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara. Particularly striking in the Vajrad.¯aka’s version is not only the fact that it transmits all the details of this distinctively Saiva religious map, which includes such well-known ´ deities as Mahalaks ¯ .m¯ı of Kollagiri (Kolhapur), Hetuka[bhairava] of Dev ¯ ¯ıkot.t.a, and Vettad¯ . a/Vet ¯ al¯ a of Nagara (P ¯ at¯ .aliputra/Kusumapura),463 but also that it preserves the classification of the goddesses of these sites as belonging to one or other of the families of Rakta, Kar ¯ al¯ ¯ı, Can. d. aks ¯ .¯ı, Mahocchus.ma, Kar ¯ al¯ a, ¯ Dantura, Bh ¯ ¯ımavakta, and Mah ¯ abal ¯ a, information that is revelant only in the ¯ Saiva context, since these are the four Guhyak ´ as and their attendants that form ¯ the inner retinue of Kapal¯ ¯ısabhairava and Can ´ . d. a K¯ ap¯ alin ¯ ¯ı in the Picumata of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha464 and are not encountered to my knowledge in any Buddhist

463 The name of the goddess of this city is Vettavasin ¯ ¯ı in the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara (f. 17v [4.43]; em. : vet.t.av ¯asin¯ı Cod.) Vetrakacchanivas¯ a in the ¯ Kubjik ¯amata (22.37c; em. [MSS E and K] : cetrakacchaniv ¯as ¯a BCDJG : caitrakacchaniv ¯as ¯a Ed.), and Vetra¯ in the K ¯alik ¯akulakram ¯arcana (em. : vatr ¯a Cod.). In the Buddhist version we see Vettad¯ . a in the ¯ Vajrad.¯aka (em. : vettaheti Cod.) and Vetad¯ . a in the ¯ D.¯ak ¯arn. ava. The V ¯asavadatt ¯a of Subandhu (p. 16, l. 2 to p. 17, l. 4) independently identifies her as ‘the Katy ¯ ayayan ¯ ¯ı called Vetal¯ a’: ¯ kusumapuram.. . . yatra . . . k ¯aty ¯ayan¯ı vet ¯al ¯abhidh ¯a. We therefore have two phonetically related but semantically unrelated names, one meaning the goddess ‘who dwells in the thicket of reeds (vetra-)’ and the other ‘the female Vetala’, ¯ vett ¯ad. a- and vet ¯ad. a- being well-attested variant forms of vet ¯ala-. I propose that the latter evolved from the former through a vernacular synonym *Vettal¯ a corresponding to Sanskrit Vetr ¯ alay ¯ a. Cf. Panj ¯ ab¯ ¯ı and Hind¯ı ¯al ¯a from Skt. ¯alayah.; Panjab¯ ¯ı ´siv ¯al ¯a, Maithil¯ı and Hind¯ı siw ¯al ¯a from Skt. ´siv ¯alayah.; and Panjab¯ ¯ı dew ¯al ¯a from Skt. dev ¯alayah.. The Mahay¯ anist ¯ Mah ¯asam. nip ¯atas ¯utra’s Candragarb has ¯utra, preserved only in a Chinese translation made by Narendrayasas in 566, ´ gives in its 18th chapter (Mah ¯asam. nip ¯atas ¯utra, chapter 55) a listing of the pre siding deities of 55 places extending from India through Central Asia to China (55a–58a [prose]; 59a–60a [verse resume]). The name of the guardian goddess of ´ Pat¯ .aliputra is said there to be Bi-lu-chi or Bi-lu-tuo (LEVI ´ 1905b, p. 265). It is tempting to see this as a deformation of the same name caused by an inadvertent inversion of the last two syllables. But I am not qualified to judge the matter.

Kar ¯ al¯ a, Dantur ¯ a, Bh ¯ ¯ımavaktra, and Mah ¯ abal ¯ a:¯ these are respectively their attendant servants’. The Ucchus. matantra is the Picumata itself (f. 185r4: ity ucchus. matantre picumate n ¯ad.¯ısam.c ¯arapat.alah.s. at.- trim.´satimah.). The four secondary goddesses that attend the Guhyakas are also ¯ called their Dut¯ ¯ıs.

465 Both the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara and the Vajrad.¯aka read parvat ¯agrasam ¯a´srit ¯a (rDo rje mkha’ ’gro f. 49r7: ri yi rtse mor brten te gnas) ‘on a hilltop’ here. This is surpris ing because what we expect is a reference to the site’s sacred tree, as in the parallel expression nimbavr. ks. asam ¯a´srit ¯a ‘by a Nimba tree’ in the next verse. It is tempting to emend, therefore to parpat.¯agrasam ¯a´srit ¯a ‘in front of a Box [tree]’, since this is so close to the transmitted reading. However, two consid erations oppose this: (1) in a passage on Kollagiri in the ¯ Picumata (f. 7r3–4 [3.84–87]), which agrees in giving Mahalaks ¯ .m¯ı as the goddess, Agnika as the Ks.etrapala, and ¯ dan. d. ah. as the weapon, the sacred tree of the site is said to be a Vaibh¯ıtaka (84 daks.in.ena likhen mantr¯ı mah ¯aghoram. bhay ¯avaham | mah ¯araudram. ´sma´s ¯anam.tu n ¯amn ¯a kollagir¯ı tath ¯a k 85 tatra dan. d. am.sam ¯alikhya madhye vaibhıtakadrumam ¯ | n ¯an ¯avr. ks. asam ¯ak¯ırn. am. koll ¯agiryoparis tath ¯a k 86 citibhih. prajvalant¯ıbhih.samant ¯at pariv ¯aritam | diks.u´s caiva vidiks.u´s ca bahis tasya mah ¯aya´se k 87 tasy ¯adhast ¯al likhet padmam as.t.apatram.sakarn.ikam | agnikam. ks.etrap ¯alam.tu mahalaks ¯. mı¯bhay ¯avaham); and (2) in the Kubjik ¯amata’s parallel version of this material Mahalaks ¯ .m¯ı is described as ‘residing on a hill’ (22.25: ag-

Moreover, this Buddhist parallel provides additional evidence of the direc tion of redaction through the state of verse 14. For it lacks the first quarter, which contained information vital to the coherence of the passage, namely the name of the site over which the goddess Jval¯ amukh ¯ ¯ı presides and the goddess of the Picumata to whose family she is assigned. As a result of this error, commit ted either by a Buddhist redactor or inherited from a defective Saiva manuscript, ´ what was originally the second quarter has become the first. Aware that the met rical cadences required at the end of first and second quarters of a verse in this metre are different the redactor has removed the resulting metrical blemish by substituting the synonym vikhy ¯at ¯a for vi´srut ¯a. But this was not enough, since to mend the unmetrical mess that resulted from the omission he would have had also to recast the quarters that follow. This was evidently beyond his competence or required more effort than he thought necessary. The result is a verse with five quarters (a, a, b, a, b) or one and a half verses of which the first half verse consists of a prior quarter without the posterior quarter required to complete it. 

As for the four sites found in the Vajrad.¯aka’s version but not in the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara, namely Ud. d.iyana, J ¯ alandhara, Tibet, and M ¯ alava, there can be ¯ little doubt that the presence of the third is the work of a Buddhist redactor, since Tibet had no religious significance for the Saivas but much for the Bud- ´ dhists from the eight century onwards. As for the other three, their presence might be explained by assuming that the direct source of the Vajrad.¯aka’s passage was not the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara as we find it in its single surviving Nepalese manuscript but rather a closely related redaction either within another version of the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara, such as we find in the paraphrases and citations of a work of this name in the Tantr ¯aloka of Abhinavagupta and Jayaratha’s commentary,466 

nikena samopet ¯am. dan. d. ahast ¯am. nagaukasam¯ | kol ¯agirye mah ¯alaks. m¯ım. naumi laks. m¯ıvivardhan¯ım). The hypermetrical reading kar ¯alar ¯up ¯a in 12c, which was also that of the Tibetan translation (rDo rje mkha’ ’gro f. 49r6: gtsigs pa’i gzugs can), is no doubt an error for k ¯alar ¯up ¯a, echoing kar ¯al ¯a in the preceding quarter. 

466 See the paraphrase of the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara’s treatment of these twenty-four S´ akta ¯ sacred sites in Tantr ¯aloka 15.88–97b and the direct citations in Jayaratha’s commentary on these verses. These show a list that differs somewhat from that found in the Nepalese manuscripts. The latter has At.t.ahasa, Caritra, ¯ 

[[195]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

or within some other Saiva source. However, this is improbable in the light ´ of the Vajrad.¯aka’s treatments of all four of these sites. For what they have in common is that they deviate from the pattern of the rest of the passage in that their presiding goddesses, Mahadev ¯ ¯ı of Ud. d.iyana, Can ¯ . d. alin ¯ ¯ı of Jalandhara, ¯ Sahaja of Tibet, and Sek ¯ a of M ¯ alava, are not assigned to one or other of the ¯ eight goddesses of the Picumata. Instead, in the case of the first three the redactor has filled in the text at these points by assigning them to the families of Guhya ( ¯ guhy ¯akhy ¯ayonisam. bhav ¯a), Soma (somasam. bhava), and Svayambhu¯ (svayambhuyonisambhav ¯a), and in the case of the fourth omitting to assign her to any deity.467 Why he chose these names is unknown to me. Only one is a goddess and not one of them is of any significance in Tantric Buddhism, unless the Svayambhu intended is that of the famous Svayambh ¯ ucaitya of Kathmandu. ¯ It seems likely that he supplied these names at random in order to maintain the compositional structure. In any case, since it would have been an easy task to insert names from among those of the eight goddesses that structure his Saiva ´ source, it is evident that they meant nothing to him. 

The other list of sacred places appears in Laghu´sam. vara 41.6–15. The verses first list these places (6–8b) and then state the classes of Yogin¯ıs and other female supernaturals said to be present in them, though without covering them all.468 The Saiva source, or rather a later redactional variant of it, is seen ´ in the following passage in the Tantrasadbh ¯ava: 

Kolagiri, Jayant ¯ ¯ı, Ujjayin¯ı, Prayaga, Varan ¯ . a, and Kot ¯ ¯ıvars.a (/Dev¯ıkot.t.a) (the eight Ks.etras); Viraja, Erud.¯ı, Hatapura, Elapura, Gokarn ¯ . a, Marukesvara, Na- ´ gara (Pat¯ .aliputra), and Pun. d.ravardhana (the eight Sam. dohas); and Parast¯ıra, Pr.s.t.hapura, Kun. d.¯ı, Chos.mara, Ks ¯ .¯ırika, May¯ apur ¯ ¯ı, Amr ¯ atike ¯ svara, and R ´ ajagr ¯ .ha (the eight Upaks.etras). The list in the redaction known to Abhinavagupta and Jayaratha has Prayaga, Varan ¯ . a, At ¯ .t.ahasa, Jayant ¯ ¯ı, Var¯ an¯ . as¯ı, Kalinga, Kul ˙ ut¯ a,¯ and Lahul ¯ a (the eight Ks ¯ .etras); Viraja, Erud ¯ .¯ı, Hal¯ a, El ¯ apura, Ks ¯ .¯ırapur¯ı, Na gara, May¯ apur ¯ ¯ı, and Marudesa (the eight Sam ´ . dohas); and Jalandhara, Nep ¯ ala, ¯ Kasm´ ¯ıra, Gargika, Hara, Mlecchadigdv ¯ aravr ¯ .tti, Kuruks.etra, and Khet.aka (the eight Upasam. dohas). It is striking that this introduces a number of Himalayan re gions, namely Kulut¯ a (Kulu), L ¯ ahul ¯ a (Lahul), Nep ¯ ala, Ka ¯ sm´ ¯ıra, and also Gargika,¯ if that refers to Garhwal. Mlecchadigdvaravr ¯ .tti ‘the pass (?) to the region of the barbarians’ is also likely to refer to a location in the Himalaya or Hindu Kush. 

467 Vajrad.¯aka f. 43r1–2 (18.43): *od. y ¯ayane *mah ¯adev¯ı (corr. : mah ¯adevi Cod.) guhy ¯akhy ¯ayonisam. bhav ¯a | vajra´sr.˙nkhaladhar ¯a devy ¯a sughor ¯a divyar ¯upin.¯ı; f. 43r2–3 (18.45): j ¯alandhare tu can. d.¯alin¯ı j ˜ney ¯a mudra kat.t.¯arikodyat ¯a | soma sambhava mah ¯adevi sarvai´svarya*prad ¯ayik ¯a (em. : d ¯ayik ¯a Cod.); f. 43r7–v1 (18.55): bhot.avis. aye sahaj ¯akhy ¯a makaradhvajadh ¯arin.¯ı | svayambhuyonisambhav ¯a saumy ¯asy ¯a divyar ¯upin.¯ı; f. 43v1–2 (18.57): m ¯alave tu tath ¯a sek ¯a mudr ¯amud gara*dh ¯arin.¯ı (corr. : dh ¯aran.¯ı Cod.) | s ¯adhak ¯an ¯am. *priy ¯a (corr. : pray ¯a Cod.) nityam. †jasasvini pras ¯asy ¯ah.†syuh.. 

468 A related system of thirty-two sacred sites is taught in Hevajra 1.6.10–19, and, with some differences, in Mah ¯amudr ¯atilaka, Pat.ala 10 (ff. 17v1–20v5).

The corresponding passage of the Laghu´sam. vara is not present in the in complete Sanskrit manuscript accessible to me, since the folios that contained it, covering 38.13c to the end of Pat.ala 44, are among those it lacks. But it can be restored with some confidence, except in the matter of the presence or absence of a few particles, by combining the evidence of the Tibetan translation,470 the 

469 The fact that the text of 69ab and 126 are contiguous in the Buddhist version indi cates that the Saiva text on which it drew was not the ´ Tantrasadbh ¯ava, at least not in its surviving redaction, but an earlier source to which 69c–125, which contain a further, much longer list of Sthanayogin ¯ ¯ıs and their classification as belonging to the families of one or other of the seven Mothers (sapta m ¯atr. kul ¯ani), have been added. The alternative, that the Buddhist redactor removed this section because he had no use for this list and its scheme of classification, is not impossible. However, it seems unlikely that in that case he would have taken the special trouble of re taining 126. It is not needed to complete the sense and proved awkward to integrate because he had it in what was evidently an already corrupted form.

In the Buddhist version the total of twenty-one sites has been raised by the addition of Od. d.iyana, J ¯ alandhara, and Pull ¯ ¯ıramalaya at the end of the first sec tion (8cd). The reason for the addition is not made explicit in the Laghu´sam. vara itself; but the fourth Pat.ala had listed twenty-four Yogin¯ıs from Mahav¯ ¯ırya to ¯ Pracan. d. a; ¯472 and in the ritual system followed by the commentators and the

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

corpus of explanatory Tantras the sacred sites, as we have seen, are likewise twenty-four because each is the location of one of these Yogin¯ıs. We have evi dence of two stages in the modification of the text that produced this result. For the earlier redaction, attested by Jayabhadra, states that Pull¯ıramalaya is not mentioned in this passage but must be understood to be included.473 It is clear 

then that his text mentioned only Od. d.iyana and J ¯ alandhara in addition to the ¯ twenty-one of the Saiva source. Jayabhadra does not cite the actual wording ´ 

of the insertion, and no other indications allow us to establish it. However, it is unlikely that the redactor took the trouble of stretching his interpolation of 

´saun. d.in¯ı khan. d. aroh ¯a cakraveg ¯a khag ¯anan ¯a k 2 haya*karn.¯a (corr. : varn. n.¯a Cod.) subhadr ¯a ca *´sy ¯am ¯adev¯ı (corr. : sy ¯am ¯athav¯ı Cod.) tathaiva ca | sur ¯abhaks.¯ı v ¯ayuveg ¯a tath ¯a mah ¯abhairav ¯a k 3 air ¯avat¯ı drumacch ¯ay ¯a la ˙nke´svar¯ı kharvar¯ı tath ¯a | v¯ıramat¯ı mah ¯an ¯as ¯a prabh ¯avat¯ı caiva can. d.¯aks.¯ı pracan. d.¯a ca s ¯adhakah.k 4 et ¯ah.siddh ¯as tu vai p ¯urvam.caturvim.´sati d.¯akinyah.. This list too has parallels in the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha, though I have found only partial matches. Thus the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara of Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 3, gives the following list of twenty-four Yogin¯ıs whose names when ut tered draw in the Sma ´ s´anabh ¯ utas (f. 202r5–7 [9.58–61]): ¯ ´sarabh ¯an<an>¯a suvır¯ a¯ ca vajribh ¯a *r ¯asabh ¯a (conj. : r ¯asibh ¯a Cod.) tath ¯a | *cakravartı¯ (corr. : cakravarti Cod.) ca *saun ´. d.ı¯ (em. : paun. d.¯ı Cod.) ca khad. gakarn.¯a mah ¯atap ¯a k 59 cakravega¯ mah ¯ay ¯amy ¯a subhadra¯ gajakarn.ik ¯a | car ¯a vai somadev¯ı ca gav ¯aks.¯ı vayuvegag ¯ a¯ k 60 airavat ¯ ı mah ¯ an¯ as¯ a¯ dam.s.t.r ¯al¯ı ca sukarka´s ¯a | vedhan¯ı ca tath ¯a bhat.t.¯a dron.¯a k ¯akenak ¯a tath ¯a k 61 yatra n ¯am ¯ani yog¯ın ¯am ucc ¯aryante mah ¯atape | tatra ´sma´s ¯anabh ¯ut ¯a´s ca s ¯am. nidhyam. y ¯a<n>ti tatks. an.¯at. The eight names in bold char acters are those that are among the twenty-four of the Laghu´sam. vara. Compare also the names Sarabh ´ anan ¯ a, Khad ¯ . gakarn. a, Gajakarn ¯ .ika, and Somadev ¯ ¯ı with the Laghu´sam. vara’s Khaganan ¯ a, Hayakarn ¯ . a, and ¯ Sy´ am¯ adev ¯ ¯ı. The names of four of the Laghu´sam. vara’s D. akin ¯ ¯ıs are found among the fourteen inner goddesses of the Picumata, i.e., the four Guhyakas, their four D ¯ utis, and the six Yogin ¯ ¯ıs, namely Can. d. aks ¯ .¯ı (the third Guhyaka), Mah ¯ abal ¯ a (the fourth D ¯ ut¯ ¯ı), and Cakravega and ¯ Mahan¯ as¯ a (the fifth and sixth Yogin ¯ ¯ıs). For the first eight see 4.254c–256 cited here p. 193. For the six Yogin¯ıs see f. 19r3 (4.257): kros.t.uk¯ı vijay ¯a caiva gajakarn.¯a mah ¯amukh¯ı | cakravega mah ¯ an¯ as¯ a¯ s. ad. yoginyah. prak¯ırtit ¯ah.. Suvır¯ a¯ appears in Kubjik ¯amata 21.45c and Matas ¯ara f. 138r1, Khaganan ¯ a¯ as one of the eight S´ aktasiddh ¯ as of the K ¯ al¯ ¯ıkula/Krama, Lanke ˙ svar ´ ı¯ in Matas ¯ara f. 81r1 as one of eight Yogin¯ıs in a variant of the inner retinue of the Picumata, and Prabhavat ¯ ı¯ in Kubjik ¯amata 11.115a and 12.23b. 

473 See here p.158. Kan¯ . ha, Yogaratnam ¯al ¯a on Hevajra 1.7.12, identifies Pull¯ıramalaya with Purn ¯ . agiri and that appears in its place in listings of these sacred places in later texts of the Cakrasam. vara cycle, as in Sam. varodaya 9.14. In the treatment of the thirty-two sacred sites of the Hevajra system in the tenth Pat.ala of the Mah ¯amudr ¯atilaka we find Purn ¯ . agiri and Pull¯ıra denoting the same place (f. 17r5– v1: od.iy ¯anam. p¯ıt.ham ¯akhy ¯atam. p¯ıt.ham.j ¯alandharam.smr.tam | p¯ıt.ham. purn ¯. agiris´ caiva k ¯amar ¯upam.tathaiva ca . . . f. 18r1–2: ´sirasi sthitam. vajrap¯ıt.ham.´sikh ¯ay ¯am. j ¯adisam.j ˜nitam | pullıram ¯. mastake j ˜neyam. bhr ¯umadhye k ¯amar ¯upakam). On the location of Purn ¯ . agiri, in the Deccan, see SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 298–299. In S´ akta ¯ Saiva sources it is one of the principal P ´¯ıt.has and is often referred to, but never under the name Pull¯ıramalaya/Pull¯ıra. 

[[200]]

the names of these two places to fill a whole line (8cd).474 The later reading, od. d.iy ¯anaj ¯alandharapull¯ıramay ¯adis.u, attested by the Tibetan translation and by the lemmata in the commentaries of Bhavyak¯ırti and Bhavabhat.t.a, supplies the missing Pull¯ıramalaya and, incidentally, is an almost metrical half-verse: its first half (od. d.iy ¯anaj ¯alandhara) is unmetrical, but the second is not, and together they provide the required total of sixteen syllables. As for the meaning of the in sertion, ordinary usage suggests that it is ‘Od. d.iyana, J ¯ alandhara, Pull ¯ ¯ıramalaya, and others’. But that would not sit well with the closed list of twenty-four Yo gin¯ıs to which the sacred places were required to correspond. Thus it has been interpreted by Bhavabhat.t.a to mean ‘beginning with Od. d.iyana, J ¯ alandhara, and ¯ Pull¯ıramalaya’, this compound with its locative plural ending being read as qual ifying the twenty-one sites, each listed in the common text with actual or virtual locative singular endings. Thus we have twenty-four Yogin¯ıs in twenty-four sites. All that was needed to make this fit the system known to the commentators was to claim that the Laghu´sam. vara is deliberately concealing the true order of the items, both the names of the Yogin¯ıs in Pat.ala 4475 and the names of the sacred sites in Pat.ala 41. For in their system that order is not Od. d.iyana, J ¯ alandhara, ¯ and Pull¯ıramalaya followed by the twenty-one from Kuluta to Arbuda, as the ¯ Laghu´sam. vara itself indicates, but the added three in reverse order followed by the twenty-one in reverse order, with the order of the Yogin¯ıs also reversed, so that the true sequence is from Pracan. d. a in Pull ¯ ¯ıramalaya to Mahav¯ ¯ırya in Ar- ¯ buda.476 

474 The frequent deviations from correct metrical form in this corpus create the im pression that the redactors were largely indifferent to this aspect of composition, happily inserting and deleting without feeling the need to rewrite the result to con form to the rules of the Anus.t.ubh metre. The alternative, that they lacked not the inclination but the ability to do so, seems to me less likely. In the texts of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha, even when the Sanskrit is of a register well below that of the learned, the metrical structure is generally sound. Indeed since we find forms from both learned and scriptural (Aisa) registers used in the same texts it seems that by ´ drawing on both the redactors were not only asserting that their compositions were divine rather than human utterances but also making the task of metrical compo sition easier for themselves by using an Aisa form that fitted the metre when the ´ Paninian would not, as, for example, in the case of the not infrequent use of Aisa´ genitives plural in - ¯am in place of the Paninian - ¯an ¯am.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Most of the few other differences between the version in Laghu´sam. vara 41 and that seen in the Saiva source are of little significance. But there is ´ 

one that is more revealing. The Tantrasadbh ¯ava has Sthala between Kosala and Trisakuni (16.62c–63b: ´ k ¯a ˜ncy ¯am.lamp ¯akavis. aye kali ˙nge kau´sale sthale | tri´sakunis tath ¯a caud.re k ¯amar ¯upe ca m ¯alave), whereas the Laghu´sam. vara lacks it (41.7: k ¯a ˜ncy ¯am.lamp ¯akavis. aye kali ˙nge c[aiva] kosale | tri´sakunis tath ¯a od.re k ¯amar ¯upe [ca] m ¯alave), and instead between Sauras¯ .t.ra and Pre tapur¯ı has Gr.hadevata (41.6: ¯ kulat ¯ay ¯am. aran. ye ca sindhude´se nagare´svare | suvarn. adv¯ıpe saur ¯as.t.re tatha ca gr ¯. hadevata¯ pretapury ¯am. him ¯alaye), which the Tantrasadbh ¯ava lacks (16.61c–62b: kul ¯ut ¯ay ¯am aran. ye´se sindhude´se nage´svare | samudrakuks. y ¯am.saur ¯as.t.re pretapury ¯am. him ¯alaye). Two features are immediately obvious here. The first is that the additional words tath ¯a ca gr.hadevat ¯a have been added to an otherwise metrically correct verse with the result that it has five Padas rather than the required four, with the fourth and ¯ fifth both with the cadence restricted to the second and fourth Padas of the ¯ Anus.t.ubh, thus crudely violating the required metrical alternation of evenly and unevenly numbered Padas that is hallmark of this metre. The second is that ¯ Gr.hadevata, meaning ‘household deity’ is a most implausible place name. The ¯ key to the mistake, which became a permanent part of the ritual system of the Cakrasam. vara cycle, is in the second part of the passage in the version of the Tantrasadbh ¯ava, which tells the reader the classes of supernaturals that are present in the sacred sites. For there gr.hadevat ¯ah.‘household deities’ are said to be present in Sauras¯ .t.ra in a verse in which the items Sauras¯ .t.ra, gr.hadevat ¯ah., and Pretapur¯ı are stated in that order (16.66c–67b: samudrakuks. y ¯am. k ¯ampilyas sauras¯.t.re gr. hadevatah¯.| pretapuryam¯. mah ¯ak ¯alyo r ¯upin. yo himavadgirau ‘In Samudrakuks.¯ı Kampil ¯ ¯ıs, in Sauras¯ .t.ra Gr.hadevatas, in Pretapur ¯ ¯ı Mahak¯ al¯ ¯ıs, in Himalaya R ¯ upin ¯ .¯ıs’). Evidently the redactor has read the sequence saur ¯as.t.re gr.hadevat ¯ah. pretapury ¯am. as though these were three sites rather than one site followed by its resident supernaturals and another site. Probably his manuscript read gr.hadevat ¯a rather than gr.hadevat ¯ah. and he took it as a stem-form to be un derstood as locative, a licence of kind seen elsewhere in both the Laghu´sam. vara and its Saiva sources, as, apparently, in the unmetrical insertion that this ´ 

error prompted: suvarn. adv¯ıpe saur ¯as.t.re tath ¯a ca gr. hadevata¯ pretapury ¯am. him ¯alaye. Bhavabhat.t.a duly comments on the occurrence of gr.hadevat ¯a in that

The direction of redaction is also unmistakeable in the passage of the 

Laghu´sam. vara (1.15–4.1) (B) that prescribes the ritual of initiation. This has evidently been redacted on the basis a Saiva source of which an expanded variant ´ 

is seen in 8.3–28 of the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara (A) redacted in the Jayadrathay ¯amala:

Here we see several tell-tale signs. In the Buddhist version the disciples undergoing the initiation are referred to as putrak ¯ah.(3.4ab: sam.cch ¯adya pat.avastren. a mukham.tes.¯am.tu putrak ¯am.‘Having covered the faces of those disciples with a piece of cloth’), a term that is standard in this technical sense in the Saiva literature but to my knowledge appears with it nowhere else in ´ Buddhist Tantric sources. 

In 2.15 the installation of the main deity in the centre of the initiation Man. d. ala is described as follows: karn.ik ¯ay ¯am. nyased v¯ıram. mah ¯abhairava bh¯ıs. an. am ‘On the pericarp [at the centre of the lotus diagram] he should install the terrifying V¯ıra Mahabhairava’. The ¯ Saiva version (8.10cd) has ´tasya madhye 

nyased devi bhairavam. bh¯ımavikramam ‘O Dev¯ı, in the centre of that [lotus] he should install Bhairava of terrible might’. But for this parallel we might have been tempted to read the Buddhist version not as mah ¯abhairava bh¯ıs. an. am., with mah ¯abhairava as a stem-form substituted for the accusative mah ¯abhairavam. for metrical convenience, a common licence in this register of the language, but as mah ¯abhairavabh¯ıs. an. am, preferring a pleonasm ‘most frightening [and] terrible’ to a reading that shows the name of the deity of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha, a clear sign of incomplete assimilation. 

The Saiva text follows this with ´tasy ¯agratah.sthit ¯am. dev¯ım aghor ¯am. ghoravikram ¯am | bhairav ¯abhimukh¯ım. kruddh ¯am.raudrar ¯up ¯am. nyaset tatah. ‘Then he should install the goddess Aghora of frightening might standing before ¯ him, facing Bhairava, furious and of terrible aspect’. The Buddhist version first inserts a description of some of the male deity’s iconographic features and then returns to redact its Saiva exemplar as follows: ´tasy ¯agratah.sthit ¯am. dev¯ım. vajrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ım.sughor ¯am | mah ¯abhairav ¯abhimukh ¯am. kr.tv ¯a tu trinetr¯ım. raudrar ¯upin.¯ım ‘[and] the most frightening goddess Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı standing be fore him, three-eyed, of terrible aspect, making her face Mahabhairava’. The ¯ Buddhist name of Heruka’s consort has been inserted but the redactor has not troubled to do the same for Heruka, leaving the Saiva name unchanged. The ´ accessible Sanskrit manuscript does give the name of Heruka here, reading ´sr¯ıheruk ¯abhimukh ¯am. kr.tv ¯a tu, and this reading is supported by the commenta tors Bhavabhat.t.a (´sr¯ıheruk ¯abhimukh ¯am. kr.tv ¯a) and Indrabhuti ( ¯ he ru ka dpal ye shes phyogs ni [*´sr¯ıherukaj ˜n ¯an ¯abhimukha-]), and the Tibetan translation (he ru ka dpal che la phyogs [*mah ¯a´sr¯ıheruk ¯abhimukha-]). But it is certain that this is a later improvement, because mah ¯abhairav ¯abhimukh ¯am. kr.tv ¯a tu is what we find in the older redaction attested in Jayabhadra’s commentary, and in the text as incorporated in the Abhidh ¯anottara (mah ¯abhairav ¯abhimukh¯ım.). It is also supported by the commentary on the later form of the Laghu´sam. vara by V¯ıravajra, who gives rab ’jigs byed che la phyogs ‘facing Mahabhairava’ here. ¯

Further, in most places where a Buddhist imprint is visible the text be comes unmetrical. This is most economically explained by the hypothesis stated above477 that what we are seeing is a Saiva source after its redaction by a Bud- ´ dhist with little concern for metrical accuracy.478 

Finally, the Laghu´sam. vara’s account of initiation is remarkably un Buddhist in its content. This is not so much because it adheres so closely to the structure and detail of the ceremony outlined in the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara, including such distinctive details as the pitching of the lines of the Man. d. ala with a cord soaked with human blood and made from the hair or sinews of a corpse (2.11), the use of such substances as the five nectars of the body (pa ˜nc ¯amr.tam) and the ash and powdered charcoal of cremation pyres on the ground of the Man. d. ala (2.1–3),479 the beating of a drum in its worship (3.2–3), and the marking of the 

477 See here p. 190. 

478 See 2.4ab: samyagj ˜n ¯anatantraj ˜nah.´sr¯ıherukamantraj ˜nah.; 2.13d: yajed d.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. varam; and 3.7a: ´sr¯ıheruk ¯adip¯ıt.ha dar´sayet. The reading mah ¯abhairav ¯abhimukh ¯am. kr.tv ¯a tu (2.18a) probably represents a first attempt to differentiate the Buddhist version from its metrical Saiva prototype by adding ´ mah ¯a-. 

479 This substitution of inauspicious and dangerous substances in the preparation of the Man. d. ala is a marked feature of accounts of initiation found in Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha texts. See, e.g., Picumata f. 5v1 (3.12ab), concerning the Aghor¯ıman. d. ala): asthi c ¯urn. atada ˙ng ¯araih. mantraj ˜no ¯alikhet puram ‘The mantra-master should draw the Man. d. ala with powdered bone and charred bone’; f. 5v6 (3.31ab): ´sma´s ¯anotthena s ¯utren. a s ¯utrak ¯aryam.tu k ¯arayet ‘He should do the outlining with a cord from the cremation ground’; f. 10r2–3 (3.184–185): ´sma´s ¯anotth ¯ani bh ¯an. d.¯ani vas tras ¯utr ¯adik ¯ani tu | vastrai<r> dhvaj ¯a tu kartavy ¯a s ¯utren. a karan.¯ı tath ¯a k ke´sair darbh ¯a<n> yath ¯any ¯ayam *acchinn ¯agr ¯an (corr. : acchinn ¯agr ¯ah. Cod.) prakalpayet | ves.t.ayen man. d. alam.tais tu astrajaptaih.samantatah.‘The vases, cloths and cords should be made with what has come from cremation grounds. With [funeral] shrouds he should make the banners and with threads [therefrom] the pitch ing cord. With the hair [of corpses] he should provide the uncut-ended stems of [protective] Darbha grass. After empowering them with the weapon[-mantra] he should surround the man. d. ala with them’; Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 4, f. 65v7 (R ¯avin.¯ıy ¯agapat.ala, [concerning the Man. d. ala of Ravin ¯ .¯ı in the K ¯al¯ıkula section of the Jayadrathay ¯amalatantra], v. 101cd: ´savas ¯utren. a sam.s ¯utrya asthic ¯urn.¯adibhir likhet ‘He should colour [the Man. d. ala] with powdered [human] bone and the like after pitching its lines with a corpse-cord’; Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 3, f. 200r5– 6: s ¯utrayed rudhir ¯aktena *´savas ¯utren. a (corr. : s. avas ¯utren. a Cod.) ‘He should outline the Man. d. ala with a corpse-cord smeared with blood’. The nature of this cord is indicated by Ks.emaraja on ¯ Svacchandatantra 13.21b: mr.tas ¯utren. a vaks. yam ¯an. acchummak ¯ayukty ¯a mr.tasn ¯ayun ¯a ‘The expression ‘with a corpse-thread’ means ‘with the sinew of a corpse’ in accordance with the secret vocabulary to be taught below’. He refers here to Svacchandatantra 15.5: sn ¯ayuh.s ¯utram. prak¯ırtitam ‘The word cord means sinew’. This understanding is also seen in Bud dhist Tantric literature. In his commentary (-pin. d.¯arthat.¯ık ¯a) on the Hevajratantra Vajragarbha glosses ´sma´s ¯anas ¯utren. a ‘cremation ground cord’ as ro’i rgyus pa rnams kyis byas pa’i srang bus ‘a cord made from the sinews of a [human] corpse’ (SNELL GROVE 1959, Pt. 1, p. 51, n.1, who mistranslates this to refer to ‘a thread made 

[[208]]

foreheads of the candidates with human blood (3.8).480 It is more because the redactor has not added what from the time of the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi onwards had been the most marked characteristic of the Mantranaya’s adap tation of Saiva Man ´. d. ala initiation, namely the series of consecrations known as abhis.ekah.. The commentators evidently could not accept that this crucial Buddhist signature might be absent. For they have resorted to strained exegesis in order to impose it. Jayabhadra claims that the terse injunction to worship the Mudra in 3.7 alludes to the ¯ guhy ¯abhis.ekah., in which the Guru unites with a consort (mudr ¯a) and the candidate swallows the semen. Then avoiding the difficult task of reading in allusions to any of the six consecrations that normally preceded this climactic act in his time he simply asserts that they should be done following the procedure familiar from other Tantras.481 Bhavabhat.t.a, however, adopts a more bold and imaginative strategy, finding all seven con 

from the guts of a corpse’). We also read of the use of the hair of corpses for this purpose: Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 3, f. 181r4: ¯alikhen man. d. alavaram.tato raudren. a bhasman ¯a | prathamam.s ¯utrayitv ¯a tu ´savam ¯urdhajarajjun ¯a ‘He should draw the excellent Man. d. ala with human ash after first pitching its lines with a cord of corpse-hair’; Siddhayoge´svar¯ımata 8.8: narake´sasamutthena karp ¯as ¯adimayena v ¯a | s ¯utrayen man. d. alam. divyam.sarvasiddhiphalodayam ‘He should trace the ex cellent Man. d. ala, which bestows the reward of all the Siddhis, with [a cord] made from human hair or from fibres such as cotton’. This option is no doubt fixed: cremation-ground substances for ascetics and conventional substances for house holders; see, e.g., Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 2 f. 9v2 (V ¯ame´svar¯ıy ¯agapat.ala, vv. 48c–49): v ¯am ¯amr.t ¯adibhir lipya tatra man. d. alam ¯alikhet k rajobhir *v¯ıram ¯argastha´s (em. : v¯ıram ¯argasthai´s Cod.) *citya ˙ng ¯ar ¯adibhasmabhih.(citya ˙ng ¯ar ¯adi conj. : city ¯a ˙ng ¯ar ¯adi Codac : cit ¯a ˙ng ¯ar ¯adi Codpc) | ratn ¯adi´s ¯alij ¯atai´s ca gr.hastha´s c ¯alikhet tatah.‘Having smeared [the ground] with wine and the like he should draw the Man. d. ala upon it with powders such as the charcoal and ash of funeral pyres, if he follows the path of Heroes, and with [ground] precious stones or rice flour [etc.], if he is a housholder’. 

480 Both versions say only that this is to be done ‘with blood’ (raktena). But a variant specifying human blood (mah ¯araktena) is attested by the Tibetan translation (mt shal chen gsum lan bzlas pa yis [mah ¯araktena trijaptena]) and the commentators Durjayacandra (mtshal chen lan gsum brzlas pa yis), V¯ıravajra (id.), and Indrabhuti ¯ (mtshal chen ni). 

481 Jayabhadra, Cakrasam. varapa ˜njik ¯a, p. 114, ll. 9–11: kulam.tasya vinirdi´sed (3.6) itiparyantam.sukaram eva | tadanantaram.tantr ¯anantaraprasiddhena vidhin ¯a sar vam abhis.ekam. nivartyed ¯an¯ım. guhy ¯abhis.ekavidhipradh ¯anatv ¯at p ¯ujayen mudr ¯am (3.7) ity ¯adin ¯a guhy ¯abhis.ekam.s ¯ucayati ‘The text up to ‘he should indicate his Fam ily’ is easy. He now alludes to the guhy ¯abhis.ekah. with the words beginning ‘he should worship the Mudra’. He does so because this is the most important [of the ¯ consecrations]. [It is should be understood that] ‘he should worship the Mudra [i.e. ¯ the consort] after he has completed the whole consecration [process that should be performed] immediately after that [determining of the candidate’s Family by cast ing the flower] following the procedure that is well known from other Tantras’. The expression ‘the whole consecration’, though singular, should be understood to refer to the whole sequence of the consecrations that precede the guhy ¯abhis.ekah..

He should also laugh wildly’. He asks us to accept that the ringing of the bell refers to the consecration of [the giving of] the bell (ghant.¯abhis.ekah.)482 and, more astonishingly, that the wild laughter enjoined, literally ‘the sound h ¯a h ¯a’, is the consecration of [the giving of the initiatory] name (n ¯am ¯abhis.ekah.).483 Having conjured up these two consecrations he then asserts that the three that precede them are therefore implicitly intended, namely the consecration with water (udak ¯abhis.ekah.), the consecration with the crown (makut.¯abhis.ekah.), and the consecration with the Vajra (vajr ¯adhipatyabhis.ekah.).484 He then subjects this same passage to a second reading in order to force it to refer also to the two consecrations that follow these five: the ¯ac ¯ary ¯abhis.ekah., which qualifies the initiate to officiate as a Vajrac¯ arya, and the consecration of the secret ( ¯ guhy ¯abhis.ekah.). He claims that in this second reading the resonance of the bell, the ringing of the bell, and the beating of the drum refer to the Guru’s uniting for the purpose of the second of these consecrations with a girl of twenty-five, twelve, or sixteen respectively.485

Having made the text refer to the guhy ¯abhis.ekah., he finds the ¯ac ¯ary ¯abhis.ekah. by using the same argument that he had employed to arrive at the full sequence of the five consecrations that precede it, namely that its presence is entailed by the supposed reference to the guhy ¯abhis.ekah., because that requires it as its antecedent.486 He finds a reference to the final consecration that he needed to discover here, that of wisdom (praj ˜n ¯abhis.ekah.), in the statement in 3.7 that Jayabhadra had taken to allude to the preceding guhy ¯abhis.ekah.: tatah. p ¯ujayen mudr ¯am ¯ac ¯aryah.susam ¯ahitah.‘Then the Ac¯ arya, fully concentrated, should ¯ worship the Mudra’. If, as is highly probable, the consecration understood by ¯ Bhavabhat.t.a here was the praj ˜n ¯aj ˜n ¯an ¯abhis.ekah. of the initiation manuals, then there would appear to a problem, because the active agent in that consecration was not the Ac¯ arya but the candidate, who now unites with the consort himself. ¯ 

Bhavabhat.t.a is very terse at this point but it is likely that he was attempting to remove this difficulty when he wrote that the text refers to the agent as Ac¯ arya ¯ 

here because he is endowed with such qualities as self-control. I take him to mean that it is indeed the candidate rather than the officiant that is the agent here and that he is referred as an officiant only figuratively, because he has all the qualities that are required of an officiant.487 These readings are, of course, 

bell is [a women of] the Vajra Family, the bell [one of] the Jewel Family, the drum [one of] the Lotus Family, and the wild laughter [one of] the Tathagata Family. The ¯ word ‘and’ [in ‘and he should laugh wildly’ indicates [one of] the other [Family, that of Action]. The officiant should have intercourse with one or other of these women of whom the first is ‘the resonance of the bell’. The meaning is [also] that the Sadhaka, ¯ [that is to say,] the candidate, should make, that is to say, utter, ‘the resonance of the bell’, that is to say, the Mantra AHO SUKHA [‘Oh, Bliss’]. He [also] tells us that after which [he should utter this Mantra] in the passage [of this Tantra] that begins with an ¯am ¯a-. At this point one must read in the following verse (1.12c–13a) ‘The master of Yoga should always lick [it, taking it] with the tips of his ring finger and thumb. Having relished it as though it were a draught of Soma he attains eternal success’. So there is another sense of this [verse], namely that the officiant should make the candidate take into his mouth [lit. ‘lick’] the product of his sexual union with the aforesaid consort with the tips of his ring finger and thumb; and that can didate, having relished it like a draught of Soma attains Siddhi. This, then, is the guhy ¯abhis.ekah.’.

The word tatah.(‘next’) means directly after the guhy ¯abhis.ekah.. He is termed the officiant [here] because he has such qualities as self-control’. Bhavabhat.t.a is probably alluding to the qual ities of the good Ac¯ arya as stated in vv. 8–9 of the ¯ Gurupa ˜nc ¯a´sik ¯a: dh¯ıro vin¯ıto matim ¯an ks. am ¯av ¯an ¯arjavo ’´sat.hah.| . . . .

artificial and could be imposed on the text only because Bhavabhat.t.a, like Jayabhadra, could not accept the possibility that there might be no reference to the consecrations in a Buddhist Tantra’s treatment of initiation. 

Further exemplification of the direction of redaction can be seen in the first of the new parallels listed above, that on the subject of the regular rite of wor shipping the Kulika (as the ¯ Laghu´sam. vara has it).

The related passage in the Heruk ¯abhyudaya is accessible only in its Tibetan translation. I give that here with a reconstruction of the Sanskrit of the parts 

488 I propose this emendation for two reasons. The first is that the reading contradicts information given later in this chapter. According to that there are three grades of flesh for use in the preparation of the sacrament (caruh.): goat, cow, and human. The first is said to be inferior (adhama-), the second intermediate (madhyama-), and the third superior (uttama-): adhamam.cch ¯agam ity uktam. madhyamam. gobhavam. bhavet | purus. ottamam. mah ¯adevi tridh ¯a tu caravah.smr.t ¯ah.(f. 320r5–v1 [84.36c– 37b]). Consequently without this emendation we have nonsense: ‘with the inferior [i.e. goat], the superior [i.e. human], and goat’. With it we have a statement that is consistent with this classification: ‘with the intermediate [i.e. cow], the superior [i.e. human] and [the inferior, i.e.] goat. The second reason is that the emendation has the support of the Buddhist parallels, which, as we shall see, read madhyamot toma´sv ¯asena or madhyamottamocchv ¯asena here.

The Heruk ¯abhyudaya, then, shows a version that is closer than the [[213]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Laghu´sam. vara to the text of the Picumata in some details and covers more of it. It is particularly striking that it preserves the Picumata’s vat.ik ¯am. pr ¯a´sayet pr ¯aj ˜nah. p ¯uj ¯ak ¯ale vi´ses. atah.(84.12ab), reading rtag tu ril bu bza’ par bya | mchod pa’i dus kyi bye brag la ‘Let him always swallow the sacramental pellet, especially at the time of worship’, diverging from the Picumata only in having nityam (rtag tu) and p ¯uj ¯ak ¯alavi´ses. atah. where that has pr ¯aj ˜nah. and p ¯uj ¯ak ¯ale vi´ses. atah.. That the Sanskrit read vat.ik ¯am.is shown by the gloss vat.ik ¯am. pr ¯a´sya in the Heruk ¯abhyudayapa ˜njik ¯a (f. 3v6). 

Even so it shows signs of having had difficulty in understanding some of the Saiva proto-text’s technical terms and of having dealt with this difficulty by ´ resorting to rewriting. Thus in 15.10 me tog gcig dang yang dag ldan ‘together with a single flower’ corresponds to bukapus. pasamanvitam ‘together with the Buka flower’ in Picumata 84.16, so that the Sanskrit may be restored from the Tibetan with some confidence as ekapus. pasamanvitam. The context is a listing of impure ingredients to be consumed at the time of practice. Now, ‘a single flower’ yields no appropriate sense in this context, whereas ‘Buka flower’ (bukapus. pam) does. For the Picumata tells us that in its secret vocabulary bukam means ‘the impurity of the male organ’ (84.38a: buko li ˙ngamalo j ˜neyas; 87.196d: bukam.li ˙ngamalam.smr.tam), and the Kubjik ¯amata tells us that bukapus. pam has the same meaning (25.226ab: bukapus. pa kan.¯akhyam.ca li ˙ngapa ˙nkamalam.tath ¯a). It is probable that the Buddhist redactor, failing to understand this obscure term, modified the text to produce something that had at least the appearance of sense. Kumaracandra confirms the reading ¯ ekapus. pa in his Heruk ¯abhyudayapa ˜njik ¯a and ventures to explain it as ‘the blood of a [woman’s] first menstruation’: ekapus. pam. prathamam.rajah. vajrapadm ¯abhy ¯am. s ¯adhyam ¯anam. kap ¯alastham.(p. 156) ‘[After putting it] in a skull-bowl [he should swallow] the ‘one flower’, i.e. the first menses, produced by the penis and vagina’. But this gloss is not only strained: it also leads the text into an implausible repetition, since the blood of first menstruation has just been mentioned in 15.10a, in the term rang byung me tog (= svayambhukusumam). He also seems not to have understood the expression kun. d. agolodbhava- seen in Picumata 84.15c (kun. d. agolodbhavenaiva), another ‘secret’ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha term, referring to the mingled ejaculates. He resolves his quandary by substituting the name of his deity, the Tibetan dpal ldan he ru ka las byung (15.9d) evidently rendering ´sr¯ıherukodbhavam. 

In the abbreviated version seen in the Laghu´sam. vara we have kulik ¯am. p ¯ujayen nityam.‘let him constantly worship the Kulika’ in place of the reading ¯ vat.ik ¯am. pr ¯a´sayen nityam seen in the Heruk ¯abhyudaya and in the Saiva proto- ´ text. This is evidently the result of a corruption of a redaction which read not 

[[214]]

vat.ik ¯am. but the exact synonym gulik ¯am.;489 and this hypothesis is confirmed by the Abhidh ¯anottara, which in its own first chapter preserves gulik ¯am.in a pas sage modelled on these verses of the Laghu´sam. vara, thus bearing witness to a stage of the redaction of this text that is earlier even than that known to our ear liest commentator, since Jayabhadra accords with all later witnesses in reading kulik ¯am. here:

The otherwise unattested kulik ¯am. was then construed by force to mean yogin¯ım. ‘a/the Yogin¯ı’, and the verb pr ¯a´sayet ‘let him swallow’, since it now made no sense, altered to p ¯ujayet ‘let him worship’.491 

489 For gulik ¯a (variant forms: gut.ik ¯a and gud.ik ¯a) see here p. 217. 

490 The reading of 11c is further supported by the Tibetan translation: mkhas pas dril bur byas nas ni. Note that dh¯ım ¯an (mkhas pas) here is synonymous with pr ¯aj ˜nah. found at the corresponding point in the version seen in the Picumata (vat.ik ¯am. pr ¯a´sayet pr ¯aj ˜nah.). This, then, has probably survived from the Saiva source on ´ which the first Buddhist version drew.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

That the Buddhist versions arose from Saiva prototypes is clear from the ´ detailed analysis of these and many other parallels. Other features reinforce this conclusion. In all cases the Saiva passages fit neatly into the contexts in ´ which they occur, without ragged edges, as it were, at their beginning and end, whereas this is often not so with the parallels in the Buddhist texts, a circum stance that fits well with a scenario in which the latter where constructed by a rather careless process of extraction, insertion, and superficial editing. 

The same is suggested by the high degree of divergence between the various Buddhist commentators in their attempts to tell us what these new texts mean. They were caught out, as it were, by new materials that lacked roots in the Buddhist textual corpus in which they were trained. They did their best to make sense of what were in many cases barely intelligible passages; but without much guidance from existing Buddhist sources and with no central authority to impose consistency on their efforts they were bound to diverge. 

We have a good example of this in the passage just discussed, in the words madhyamottama´sv ¯asena gandhodakasahitena tu . . . . The meaning of the Saiva ´ prototype as seen in the version of the Picumata, namely madhyamottamacch ¯a gena gandhodasahitena tu | vat.ik ¯am. pr ¯a´sayet pr ¯aj ˜nah., is perfectly clear to any one who has read the whole chapter of which it is part. It means ‘The wise [initiate] should swallow a pellet made from beef, human flesh, or goat mixed with scented water’.492 The case is very different with the Buddhist versions. Their madhyamottama´sv ¯asena surely began life as a copyist’s corruption; for it yields no sense in either Saiva or Buddhist terms in the context of this rite of ´ the pellet or, indeed, in any other. Kumaracandra, therefore, in his commen- ¯ tary on the passage as it appears in the Heruk ¯abhyudaya, could only guess at the meaning on the basis of the one part of the sentence that made undoubted sense, namely the injunction to swallow a pellet. Knowing that such pellets were made in practice from the five meats and the five body nectars he tells us that madhyamottama´sv ¯asah.‘the intermediate and upper breath’ means those meats and that the gandhodakam ‘scented water’ with which this ‘breath’ is to be mixed 

iti | yath ¯a sam.tos. o j ¯ayate tath ¯a karan.¯ıyam ity arthah.‘The word kulik ¯am.is used in [this] Tantra following [its own special] convention. It refers to the physical woman [who is the practitioner’s consort, when she is perceived as] identical with Va jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı. He should worship her, which means that he should do whatever is neces sary to satisfy her’. In his K ¯alacakra-influenced commentary on the Laghu´sam. vara (Laghutantrat.¯ık ¯a) Vajrapan¯ .i interprets kulik ¯a more esoterically as referring to Va jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı as the non-conceptual central energy-channel: kulik ¯am. p ¯ujayen nityam iti | iha kulik ¯a madhyam ¯avadh ¯ut¯ı vajrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ı nir ¯avaran.¯a gr ¯ahyagr ¯ahakavarjit ¯a (p. 59). 

492 See the footnote on my emendation madhyamottamacch ¯agena on p. 212. [[216]]

means those nectars.493 

Jayabhadra and Bhavabhat.t.a commenting on the same expression when it occurs in the Laghu´sam. vara, where the second part of the sentence has emerged through further confusion as kulik ¯am. p ¯ujayet, impose quite different but equally arbitrary interpretations, which are based not on the text itself but, in the ab sence of evident meaning, on their own notions of what the text ought to be saying here. Thus Jayabhadra, who has the variant madhyamottamocchv ¯asena, makes madhyama- mean ‘vagina’, uttamocchv ¯asah.‘the placing of the tongue’, and gandhodakam ‘semen’, interpreting the sentence to mean that the adept should worship the Kulika, that is to say, his female consort identified with ¯ Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı, by placing his tongue (uttamocchv ¯asena) together with his semen (gandhodakasahitena) in her vagina (madhyama-).494

[[217]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

In Bhavabhat.t.a’s commentary we find an entirely different understanding. According to him madhyamottama´sv ¯asena gandhodakasahitena tu | kulik ¯am. p ¯ujayet means ‘he should worship the Yogin¯ı with the place or time (-´sv ¯asena) of fire (madhyama-) and earth (-uttama-) together with wind (gandha-) and water (udaka-)’. The purpose of this invention, which the Sanskrit entirely fails to support, is to find a reference (1) to the symbols of the four elements as constituting the thrones of the various groups of Yogin¯ıs in the Man. d. ala and (2) to various time periods considered to be governed by these elements as the occa sions for the successful performance of rituals for hostile purposes (abhic ¯arah.), re-invigoration (paus.t.ikam), expulsion (ucc ¯at.anam), and the averting of danger (´s ¯antikam) respectively. That Bhavabhat.t.a has decided what he would like to find here and then imposed it is clear from the extreme artificiality of the glosses that bend the text to his will: ‘the intermediate’ (madhyama-) is fire (vahnih.) because it is falls in the middle of the list of the four elements (actually in the penultimate position); the ‘highest’ (-uttama-) is that of Mahendra, the presiding deity of the symbol of earth (pr.thiv¯ı), because he is the king of the gods; gandhah. means not ‘fragrance’, its lexical meaning, but ‘that which possesses fragrance’, namely the wind (v ¯ayuh.), since that is the bearer of fragrance; udaka- is not udakam ‘water’ but an unattested udakah. meaning Varun. a, literally ‘he who possesses the waters’, since Varun. a is the presiding deity of the symbol of water (udakam); and ´sv ¯asah. means not ‘breath’ but ‘that in which X breathes’, that is to say, by an entirely unwarranted leap, the locus or time of X’s operation.495 

[i.e. his semen]. The word kulik ¯a is a term specific to the esoteric jargon of this Tantra. It denotes the physical woman [as] identical with Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı. By saying that one should ‘worship’ her the text means that one must do what is necessary to satisfy her’.

The ´sv ¯asah., then, is the locus of these or their time-period. The madhyamah.‘intermediate’ is ‘fire’, because it arises in the middle, in accordance with the text ‘earth, water, fire, and wind’; and the uttamah. ‘highest’ is the [symbol] of Mahendra[, the presiding deity of the earth symbol], be cause he is the king of the gods.

Since these confused and barely comprehensible verses are found in the opening chapter of the Laghu´sam. vara the redactor has made a greater effort than usual to assimilate them to their new Buddhist milieu. But he has not done this by rewriting them in such a way that Buddhists would recognize and understand them as formulated within their own established discourse. His ap proach is rather that of montage or bricolage, in which bits and pieces of various texts have been clumsily combined. Instead of rewriting the verses he has sand wiched them between others derived from well-known Buddhist sources. Thus the opening verses of the work (1.1–3), which immediately precede this pas sage, are a version of the opening of the Buddhist Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayoga;496 and the verses (1.7c–13b) that follow it contain awkwardly collocated variants of verses found in that text and the Buddhist Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha and Guhyasam ¯aja.497 

But this attempt to lend the compilation a Buddhist character by embedding the passage from the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha between verses that Buddhist Tantrics would immediately recognize as Buddhist is mostly restricted to this first sec tion. The rest of the work up to the point at which the redaction known to Jaya 

pound of the type in which an intermediate word is dropped, as when one says ‘a pot of ghee’ (ghr.taghat.ah.) when what one means is ‘a pot full of ghee’. The other two are gandhah. and udakah.. The first is a primary derivative of gandhah.‘fra grance’ in the meaning ‘that which has fragrance’ and refers to the wind, because that is the bearer of fragrance. The second is [likewise] a primary derivative of udakam ‘water’ in the meaning ‘that which has water’, i.e. Varun. a[, the God of Wa ter]’. The application of this explanation then follows. One is instructed to meditate on the Yogin¯ıs one by one in a fixed order of rotation tied to the passage of time. Thus on the first Tithi of the lunar fortnight one meditates on the first eight Yo gin¯ıs during the day-time, each for one eighth of the day, the second eight during the eight half Praharas of the night, the third eight during the day of the second Tithi, the fourth eight during the night, and so on. Bhavabhat.t.a explains there that the three eights that make up the 24 Yogin¯ıs associated with the sacred sites must have the symbols of fire, water, and earth as their thrones (pp. 21–22: dev¯ın ¯am ¯asanam. vahniman. d. alam iti dinabh ¯agah.; dev¯ın ¯am ¯asanam. v ¯arun. aman. d. alam iti r ¯atribh ¯agah.; dev¯ın ¯am. m ¯ahendraman. d. alam ¯asanam iti dinabh ¯agah.). This, evi dently, is what he means by ´sv ¯asah.in the sense of ‘place’. He explains its sec ond meaning as ‘time’ in the following: agny ¯adiyogo ’py abhic ¯ar ¯adau tathaiva j ˜neyah.| yath ¯abhic ¯are cittacakrasya vahniks. an.e ´s ¯antike v ¯akcakrasya varun. aks. an.e paus.t.ike k ¯ayacakrasya m ¯ahendraks. an.e ucc ¯at.ane ´sma´s ¯anacakrasya v ¯ayuks. an.e yo gin¯ın ¯am anyatam ¯a bh ¯avy ¯a ‘This application of fire and the others should also be understood in the case of hostile rites and the like. Thus in a hostile rite one should meditate on one of the Yogin¯ıs of the Circuit of Mind (the first eight) at a fire mo ment, on one of those of the Circuit of Speech (the second eight) at a Varun. a moment in a rite to avert danger, on one of those of the Circuit of the Body (the third eight) at a Mahendra moment in a rite of re-invigoration, and on one of those of the Circuit of ¯ the Cremation Grounds (the fourth eight) at a wind moment in a rite of expulsion’. 496 See here p. 154.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

bhadra and Bhavyak¯ırti ends consists almost entirely of (1) sections for which I have found close Saiva parallels, (2) sections for which I have not found such ´ parallels but which are of the same type, and (3) sections devoted to giving the Mantras. These, of course, have not been lifted directly from Saiva sources, be- ´ cause the Mantras so taught are peculiar to this and related Tantras. However, the Mantras themselves are Saiva in style; and the method of teaching them by ´ 

giving them letter by letter in encoded form (mantroddh ¯arah.) has been adopted in imitation of Saiva scriptural practice, appearing first, as we have seen, in the ´ 

Sarvakalpasamuccaya that supplements the proto-Yogin¯ıtantra Sarvabuddha sam ¯ayoga.498 In the light of this one readily understands why the redactor of the version known to Bhavabhat.t.a and the other later commentators and seen in the one accessible manuscript and the Tibetan translation felt the need to add explicitly Buddhist material at the end of the work, thus accomplishing for the whole an unambiguously Buddhist frame, which in the earlier redaction had been present only in the first chapter.499 

CONVERTING THE OUTSIDERS. The textual dependence of these Buddhist 

Yogin¯ıtantras on the scriptural corpus of the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha would surely have been obvious to any learned S´ akta ¯ Saiva who examined them; and there is evidence ´ that it was indeed noticed. We do not find this evidence in the Tantric Saiva ´ literature, since the only historical data that intrude there are the spiritual ge nealogies of its teachers. For the rest it is concerned purely with what it sees as the timeless realities of fact and injunction, and it is interested in relations between its own and other traditions only to the extent that it establishes a hi erarchy among these traditions by ranking their various goals along an ascent that culminates in its own. If awareness of this textual dependence was to find expression in Saiva literature then it could only be in the distorting mirror of ´ mythology, where the specifics of the tensions between sects could be translated 

498 See here p. 154. 

499 The special character of the added, 51st chapter is indicated in the spiritual biogra phy (rnam thar) of Tilopa ascribed to Marpa (Mar pa chos kyi blo gros). For there ¯ the Jn˜anad ¯ . akin ¯ ¯ı and her retinue are said to have taught it to Tilopa together with ¯ the oral transmission (TORRICELLI and NAGA 1995, p. 12): gsungs nas rtsa rgyud le’u nga gcig pa bshad rgyud dang bcas pa dang snyan rgyud gnang ngo. The ex tended Tantra was already current when at least some of the Vyakhy ¯ atantras were ¯ redacted. The Adhidh ¯anottara contains 50.20c–51.12b. It is possible that the text was extended first only to this point. Parts of the 50th chapter after this point are seen in the Sam. put.odbhava: 50.21–23b and 24ab > Sam. put.odbhava 5.1.16–19b; and 50.25 > Sam. put.odbhava 5.1.19cd. Verses from the remainder of the longer text, from 51.12c to the end, are found in the Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara and the Sam. varodaya: 51.7ab > Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara 17.10ab; 51.13c–16b > Yogin¯ısam.c ¯ara 17.21c-24b; 51.18–19 > Sam. varodaya 32.29c–30b; and 51.21d > Sam. varodaya 32.31d.

into accounts of the interaction of the gods with demons and men. Thus we find our evidence in a variant of the famous narrative of Siva’s burning of the celestial ´ 

cities of the three demons (tripuradahanam) given in the Haracaritacint ¯aman.i, a collection of Saiva myths for the instruction of the laity compiled in the thir- ´ teenth century by the Kashmirian S´ akta ¯ Saiva Jayadratha. ´ 500 

According to that account Br.haspati, the ingenious Guru of the gods, puts an end to the invincibility of these demons, the reward of their devotion to Siva, ´ by fooling them into abandoning the worship of that deity. He composes and in troduces to them various texts for the visualization of Buddhist deities in which Siva and other ´ Saiva deities are portrayed as their inferiors. Then, once they ´ have become used to these, he adds Mantras by adapting those of the Saiva ´ Tantras and composes passages giving instruction in Tantric ritual procedures by cobbling together various excerpts from the same sources. Finally, he com poses Buddhist treatises which supplement this Tantric corpus with reasoned arguments designed to undermine the demons’ commitment to their rites and belief in God:501 

500 Jayadratha was the brother of Jayaratha, author of the Tantr ¯alokaviveka, on whose date see SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 418–419. That Jayadratha shared his brother’s S´ akta ¯ Saiva adherence, in keeping with the family’s long-established tradition, is ´ evident throughout his work, but particularly in the opening verses of each chap ter, in which he gives a metaphysical reading of the myth that follows. Thus in 13.1, introducing this narrative of the destruction of the three cities, whose point is to glorify the Kashmirian sacred site of the volcanic fire-Linga ( ˙ jv ¯al ¯ali ˙ngam) at Suyam (Svayambhu) (on which see S ¯ TEIN 1900, vol. 2, pp. 484–485), he equates the three cities with the cognizer, cognition, and the cognized differentiated in contracted consciousness, and the fire that destroys them with the all-inclusive nonduality whose emergence bestows liberation: etad vedakavedyavedanamayam. dagdhv ¯a pur ¯an.¯am.trayam. p ¯urn.¯advairahut ¯a´sanena ´samayan m ¯ay ¯amayopadravam | jv ¯al ¯ali ˙ngatay ¯a *sphura ˜n (A : sphuraj Ed.) jagadanugr ¯ah¯ı svayambh ¯ur asau devah. sam. prati bh ¯asat ¯am. mama par ¯am ull ¯asayan nirvr.tim ‘May that god Svayambhu¯ blaze forth for me now, revealing the highest bliss, he who has favoured the world by manifesting himself as the fire-Linga after burning these three cities that are ˙ the cognizer, the cognized, and cognition, putting an end to the torment of bound existence with the fire of all-inclusive nonduality’. This is exactly in the conceptual mode of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva nondualism of Kashmir. ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

[Br.haspati:] “The root cause of the victory of our enemies is their devotion to Siva. ´ We must think carefully what will cause that to fade. I have already thought in general terms of a means of accomplishing that. But how[, I wonder,] will it suc ceed while [their Guru] Sukra is with them? For he exerts himself day after day ´ to strengthen their devotion to the Lord in order to *secure (conj.) their welfare. [But] although they are genuinely devoted [to Siva] they are proud of their power ´ and of low intelligence. It should therefore be easy to lead them astray”. When he had said this Indra eagerly asked him to explain the stratagem that would put an end to their worship of the Linga. Having heard this he replied and said: “Behold. ˙ All persons usually assign their devotion on the basis of their understanding of an ascending hierarchy. Who but Siva is at the summit [of this hierarchy], surpass- ´ ing all [others]? Nonetheless I shall use my imagination and tell [them] that there is a being above even him. In this way I shall give them false instruction of my own invention. I shall also use my wits to compose and show them some learned writing [in support of my teaching]. I shall deceitfully write visualization-texts of deities in relation to whom this Siva will be placed in a position of inferiority, ´ and I shall tell them that these show that there is another being who is greater even than him, so that they may give up their worship of the Linga and so be de- ˙ stroyed. However, these false teachings will have no effect while Sukra is present. ´

[For] he, through intuition and reason, is fully conversant with ultimate reality”. Thus said the Atharvavedic priest [of the gods]. Then Indra respectfully asked him to explain the stratagem more fully. After some reflection Br.haspati said to Indra: “It is entirely inappropriate that it should be you that has to divert [these demons] from the worship of Siva’s Li ´ nga. [So I shall take on this task myself.] ˙ My way of destroying their understanding will be this. I shall call this teaching Buddhist, [appropriately enough] since it will be born of [nothing more than] my intellect (buddhih.). The well-known Buddha will be conceived therein as the sole lord of the gods. Even the greatest deities will be portrayed as his chowry-bearers. 

Gods that I shall call Buddhist will be depicted positioned on top of Gan. apati and others of the highest Saiva deities. When the demons see these falsely conceived ´ 

visualization-texts they will certainly make the mistake of thinking that these gods are greater than Siva. Once these texts have been established and I have ´ accustomed the demons to them I shall introduce Mantras modelled on [those of] the Saiva Tantras ( ´´saivatantr ¯anuv ¯adena) and by redacting various passages from these same scriptures (uddhr.tya ´siva´s ¯astrebhyah. khan. d.¯an khan. d.¯an) I shall add a worthless, concocted system of [Tantric] observances involving Mantras, ritual, and the rest. The learned [Buddhist] literature that I shall compose to define bondage and liberation will be nourished by higher reasoning of an exceptional degree of rigour. It will explain, of course, that of these two bondage includes such activities as worshipping the Linga; and liberation will be [defined as] a voidness ˙ [of self] that [once accepted] will subvert [their commitment to their] religious duties. Their sacrifices and other rituals will be opposed there; and coming to be lieve [though this teaching] that there is no soul they will denigrate Siva himself ´ [for teaching otherwise]. Indra, when I have composed learned teachings of this kind I shall insinuate them into their hearts and so put an end to their devotion to Siva. For the plan to succeed we have only to wait until ´ Sukra is absent”. ´ 

Br.haspati’s plan works. The demons’ Saiva Guru leaves for a year to attend a ´ sacrifice. Br.haspati takes on his appearance and thus disguised sets about con verting them to Tantric Buddhism. They become so anti-Saiva that they can no ´ longer bear even to mention the Sivali ´ nga, let alone worship it, ˙502 thus making it possible for Siva to destroy them. ´ 

Evidently the Buddhist Tantric scriptures that Br.haspati is represented here as having concocted are the Yogin¯ıtantras as typified by the Laghu´sam. vara and its satellites;503 and the fact that this understanding of the nature of the 

502 Haracaritacint ¯aman.i 13.127c–128b: *tatah. prabhr.ti (A : tad ¯aprabhr.ti Ed. B) te daity ¯ah.´sivabhaktipar ¯a ˙nmukh ¯ah.| asahanta na li ˙ngasya n ¯am ¯api kim ut ¯arcanam. 503 That this is the Buddhism envisaged here is in keeping with another anti-Buddhist myth in this collection (Haracaritacint ¯aman.i, chapter 17 and SANDERSON 1995b, p. 94 for a summary). For there the adherents of Buddhism are said to be led by three demons: Heruka, Sam ´. vara (the two Vajrad. akas), and ¯ Adibuddha (K ¯ alacakra). ¯ 

[[223]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

genesis of these texts appears in a work of this kind suggests that it was com 

mon knowledge. For the Haracaritacint ¯aman.i, being concerned with the cults of Siva at sacred sites, is not addressed to the narrow community of the initiated ´ but to the widest possible audience for a Saiva text in Sanskrit, that is to say, ´ the uninitiated Saiva laity. Nor can this text be seen in spite of this as reflecting ´ the knowledge of a learned minority at the time of its composition. For between the opening and closing verses of each chapter the text is written in a rather unpolished style that is so similar to that of the anonymous Puran¯ .ic tracts in praise of sacred sites that it should not be seen as a composition in the full sense of that term but rather as a compilation in which Jayadratha has lightly edited pre-existent materials of this popular genre.504 

The redactional relation between the Yogin¯ıtantras and Saiva Tantras of the ´ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha may not, of course, have been so obvious to learned Buddhists once these texts had been propagated and the work of commentary undertaken, let 

17.4: m ¯ay ¯a´sambariko n ¯amn ¯a heruk ¯akhya´s ca d ¯arun. ah.| ¯adibuddh ¯abhidh ¯ana´s cety asur ¯as traya ¯asate; 17.9: vajrad.¯ak ¯av iti khy ¯atau tad ¯a heruka´sambarau | ¯adibuddhena sahitau sur ¯an.¯am.cakratur bhayam. Heruka here is evidently Heva jra, since he is described as eight-headed, four-legged, sixteen-armed, and em braced by Nairatmy ¯ a (17.5). He leads the Buddhists in their war against the gods. ¯ He is surrounded by an army of Madhyamikas ( ¯ madhyaman ¯am ¯anah.), followers of the Mantranaya (mantranay ¯atmak ¯ah.), bhramamoh ¯atmak ¯ah., mithy ¯aj ˜n ¯an ¯atmak ¯ah., Sr´ avakas ( ¯ ´sr ¯avak ¯atm ¯anah.), and Buddhas copulating with their consorts (17.7–8). The meaning of the terms bhramamoh ¯atmak ¯ah. and mithy ¯aj ˜n ¯an ¯atmak ¯ah.is not immediately obvious. Since it is clear from the context that they refer to dis tinct groups among the Buddhists (bhramamoh ¯atmak ¯ah. kecin mithy ¯aj ˜n ¯an ¯atmak ¯ah. pare) I take them to mean ‘those who are devoted to the delusion of [the ob jective existence of] non-objective cognitions’) and ‘those who are devoted to the view that [belief in this reality of] cognitions [containing the appearance of their objects] is false’, understanding these expressions to refer to the two kinds of Yogac¯ aras, those who hold mind-only with form and mind-only with- ¯ out form respectively to be ultimately real, that is to say Sak¯ aravij ¯ n˜ anav ¯ adins ¯ and Nirak¯ aravij ¯ n˜anav ¯ adins. Classifying Mah ¯ ay¯ ana Buddhists into M ¯ adhyamikas ¯ and these two kinds of Yogac¯ aras and the classification of all these into those ¯ who follow the Mantranaya and those who do not, that is to say, those who follow the non-Tantric Paramit ¯ anaya, is a commonplace in the doxographical ¯ tradition of late Indian Buddhism; see, e.g., Advayavajra, Tattvaratn ¯aval¯ı, pp. 4–8; Sahajavajra, Sthitisam ¯asa ff. 4v1–6r2 (nir ¯ak ¯arayog ¯ac ¯arasthitisam ¯asah.), ff. 6r2–7r1 (s ¯ak ¯arayog ¯ac ¯arasthitisam ¯asah.), ff. 7r1–11r3 (madhyam ¯asthitisam ¯asah.), and ff. 11r3–18v5 (Mantranaya); Vag¯ ¯ısvarak ´ ¯ırti, Tattvaratn ¯avalokavivaran. a, pp. 141–142 (mantranaye ca vij ˜n ¯anav ¯adamadhyamakamatayor eva pradh ¯anatv ¯at . . . ); Moks.akaragupta, ¯ Tarkabh ¯as.¯a, pp. 107–110; and KAJIYAMA 1998, pp. 148–151, 154–158. 

504 Consider Jayadratha’s own statement at the beginning of the work (1.5): de´se ´sr¯ıvijaye´sasya nivasan preran.¯at tayoh.| caritr ¯an.i trinetrasya ´s ¯astradr.s.t.¯ani gumphaye ‘While living in the land of Siva Vijaye ´ svara I shall string together the ´ deeds of the Three-Eyed [God] as I have seen them in the sacred texts, at the insti gation of these two [teachers]’.

alone to the ordinary lay devotee of the Buddha. But the iconographical reper toire, the retinue types, the style of worship and Kap¯ alika observance, and the ¯ growing autonomy and diversification of the goddess, are so closely parallel to what we see among the S´ akta ¯ Saivas that it is hard to believe that any Indian, ´ learned or not, could have seen these deities and observed the practices of those 

that propitiated them without being aware of this fact. 

This must have been especially so in east India. For the S´ akta tradition was ¯ particularly strong there, as it still is, and had deep roots in the domain of pop ular religion, as is evident from such Puran¯ . as of the region as the Dev¯ıpur ¯an. a, Br.hann ¯arad¯ıyapur ¯an. a, Br.haddharmapur ¯an. a, and K ¯alik ¯apur ¯an. a,505 from non eastern testimony,506 from the fact that east-Indian locations are conspicuous in early lists of the S´ akta sacred sites, ¯507 and from the inscriptions and other his

torical records of this period. Thus when Devapala is eulogized in an inscription ¯ of his son Mahendrapala it is for two achievements: his martial success and, as ¯ we have seen, his building of two exceptional temples, one of the Buddha and the other of the Saiva Goddess; ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva deities figure strongly, as we have seen, ´ in the various pious works of Nayapala detailed in the Siy ¯ an inscription: several ¯ Vad. abh¯ı temples for goddesses, one of them for a hill-top Carcika installed by his ¯ predecessor Mahendrapala, temples for the Nine Durg ¯ as, and temples for the ¯ [Bhairava] Hetukesvara and a Bhairava accompanied by a retinue of sixty-four ´ Mothers;508 and Madanapala, the patron of Sam ¯ . dhyakaranandin, is described in ¯ that poet’s R ¯amacarita as having attained his success in war through the favour of Can. d.¯ı.509 Even the Saiddhantika Pra ¯ sasti from B ´ an¯ . garh has a S´ akta context, ¯ its immediate purpose being to report the building by the Rajaguru M ¯ urti ¯ siva of ´ a Vad. abh¯ı temple for Carcika. ¯510 

[Murti ¯ siva], being devoted to pious works, has constructed this Vad ´ . abh¯ı temple which seems to embody his two halves miraculously transformed in a mountain of snow and a mountain of gold. I fancy that Indra’s elephant, now that he can see the wondrous reflection of the lions [on its roof] in the waters of the heavenly Ganges, will recoil [in fear] and no longer drink its waters. 

That the temple is described as a Vad. abh¯ı surmounted by lions establishes that it is a temple of a goddess.511 The inscription does not state explicitly that this goddess is a Carcika: it did not need to do so since the inscription was not doubt ¯ in situ. But we can infer that she was from the fact that the inscription begins with obeisance to her followed by two benedictory verses in her praise:512

In the version of that text known to Abhinavagupta and his com mentator Jayaratha the three P¯ıt.has are Kamar ¯ upa (Assam), P ¯ urn ¯ . agiri (in the Dec can), and Ud. d.iyana (Swat).

Obeisance to Carcika.¯ 

May the world be protected by the dust from the feet of Carcika, worshipped by ¯ the creator of the universe, fragrant powder for the heads of all the gods and demons. 

May Carcika protect the world, who at the aeon’s end, garlanded with human ¯ skulls, with her body becoming desiccated out of anxiety at the poverty of her fare, thinks: “What shall I eat? If I devour this universe in a single bite, it will be no more than a fragment that will lodge between my teeth. What shall I drink? The water of [all] the seven oceans is insufficient to be visible in the hollow of my palm.513 

That a Saiddhantika Guru should have built a temple for a fearsome goddess ¯ of this kind is compelling evidence of the strength of S´ aktism in the P ¯ ala realm. ¯ For there is nothing in the Siddhanta itself to prompt such a construction, that ¯ tradition generally marking itself off from the cults of such deities with their gruesome iconography and their ecstatic and transgressive rites. 

Indeed, as this anomalous foundation suggests, the cult of the emaciated Carcika seems to have been particularly well-established in the region. There ¯ are numerous surviving images of this goddess at or from sites in Bihar, West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Orissa, dating from the ninth century to the four teenth;514 she figures prominently in the east-Indian S´ akta ¯ Dev¯ıpur ¯an. a;515 and

in early canonical treatments of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva sacred sites this goddess is said ´ to preside at Dev¯ıkot.a,516 Pun. d.ravardhana,517 both in Varendr¯ı, and Ekamra ¯ (Bhubaneswar) in Orissa.518 In the first she has the name Karn. amot.¯ı,519 accord ing to the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara, Picumata, and Kubjik ¯amata, and Bahumam¯ . sa according ¯ to the Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯ak ¯an. d. a.520 In the other two she is called Camun ¯ . d. a. ¯

Of these sites Dev¯ıkot.a appears to have been of special importance from early times. The M ¯adhavakula refers to it simply as Sr´¯ıp¯ıt.ha, that is to say, as the Seat [of the Goddess];521 and the Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a describes it522 as a city originally fashioned by Brahma where this goddess and the other ¯ Mothers who accompany her were created by Siva and the other gods from ´ their own bodies in order to destroy the demons who had seized it. After the city has been freed Siva declares that henceforth it will be the Mothers’ sacred ´ abode,523 that he will reside here with them as Hetukesvara, ´524 and that they will be worshipped following ritual procedures taught in Tantras that will be composed for this purpose by the grateful gods. The titles of these Tantras of the Mothers (m ¯atr.tantr ¯an.i), which are listed in the narrative, reveal them to be Yamalatantras, headed by the ¯ Brahmay ¯amala.525

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Moreover, it is probable that some at least of the surviving east-Indian im ages of the emaciated goddess reproduce the iconography of this important local form. An image of Carcika from the Dinajpur District of Bangladesh, in which ¯ Dev¯ıkot.a was located, shows the goddess seated beneath a banyan tree;526 and we see the same in an image from an unrecorded site in West Bengal.527 In both images severed human heads are attached by their hair to the tree’s branches, in dicating that the site of this tree is a cremation ground, since cremation grounds were also places of execution.528 Now, in the tradition of the Picumata and the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara each of the major S´ akta sites is a cremation ground with its ¯ own distinctive sacred tree; and in the case of Kot.ivars.a/Dev¯ıkot.a this is in 

may ¯amala, the Svayambh ¯uy ¯amala, the Skanday ¯amala, the S ¯arasvatay ¯amala, the G ¯andh ¯aray ¯amala, the ¯I´s ¯anay ¯amala, and the Nandiy ¯amala: you shall have these Tantras and others in thousands, and with them men will sacrifice to you in devo tion. You will grant boons to men who sacrifice to you. Being goddesses of celestial power you will bestow celestial Siddhis. And women who sacrifice to you regularly with the secret [rites] will become Yogesvar ´ ¯ıs, women of celestial might’. On the list of Yamalatantras in this passage and its relation to lists of such texts in the ¯ Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha see SANDERSON 2001, pp. 6–7, fn. 4. The Brahmay ¯amala, also called Picumata, teaches the worship of Bhairava as Hetuka surrounded with the God dess by eight V¯ıras and twenty-four Yogin¯ıs in its eightieth chapter (f. 306r2–3; 80.32–33): hetukam. devadeve´sam. kap ¯alakr.tabh ¯us. an. am | v¯ır ¯as.t.akayutam. madhye devadevam. parodayam.k k ¯al ¯agniv ¯ayusam. yuktam adhordhvakr.tasam. gatim.| nyaset svar ¯upabh ¯asvantam.tato yogigan. am. nyaset. It is striking that this reference to Hetuka, presumably the Bhairava of Dev¯ıkot.a, is found in a chapter which is dis tinguished by being one of the very few passages in the Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha that departs from the Tantric norm by containing material of the Puran¯ .ic type, the subject which gives it its title being a myth of the origin of the skull-bowl and skull-staff (kap ¯alakhat.v ¯a ˙ngotpattih.).

deed the banyan (vat.avr. ks. ah.).529 This strongly suggests that the local Carcika¯ of Dev¯ıkot.a may have been multiplied in the manner of the Nat.araja of the Tamil ¯ country, which though originally the deity of Cidambaram was established in sec ondary forms in temples throughout the region. We may note also that most of the surviving east-Indian Carcikas hold the trident, often as the most conspic- ¯ uous of their held attributes. Both the Picumata and the Ni´sisam.c ¯ara specify this as the weapon distinctive of the Karn. amot.¯ı of Dev¯ıkot.a, and the Skanda pur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a says that it is because the goddess of this place slew the demons with her trident here that the site contains a sacred bathing-place called S´ulakun ¯ . d. a ‘the pond of the trident’ and that anyone who drinks its water (´s ¯ulodakam) after doing obeisance to her will be safe from all harmful beings (171.124–125). The Picumata too refers to this Kun. d. a.530 

Finally, the pre-eminence of the emaciated goddess in the S´ aktism of eastern ¯ India during this period is strongly underlined by the fact it is she that the Bud 

dhists of the cult of Cakrasam. vara chose to represent supine beneath the right foot of Sam ´. vara and Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı as the female representative of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ tradition. 

In textual references to that Buddhist icon she is generally called Kalar ¯ atri. ¯ But there can be no doubt about her identity. For (1) she is called Carcika¯ in the Vajrav ¯ar ¯ah¯ıs ¯adhana of the Siddha Luy¯ ¯ı,531 and Camun ¯ . d. a in a Kalpa of ¯ the Abhidh ¯anottara and in the anonymous Trayoda´s ¯atmakavajrad.¯akin¯ıvajra v ¯ar ¯ah¯ıs ¯adhana, which is based upon it;532 (2) Carcika is called K ¯ alar ¯ atri in a ¯ 

529 See here p. 112. That the sacred sites are the cremation grounds (´sma´s ¯anam) of the places listed is clear from the context in the Picumata, that (3.8–127) being a description of the nine cremation grounds that must be installed in the initiation Man. d. ala (mah ¯aman. d. alam), one at the centre (Prayaga) and eight ¯ around the periphery (Var¯ an¯ . as¯ı, Viraja [Jajpur in Orissa], Kollagiri [Kolh ¯ apur ¯ in Karn. at¯ .aka], Prabhasa [in Kathiawar], Ujjayin ¯ ¯ı [in Malwa], Bhute ¯ svara [in ´ Mathura?], Ek ¯ amraka [Bhubaneswar in Orissa], and Kot ¯ .ivars.a). It is also clear from the account of Kot.ivars.a given in the Skandapur ¯an. a-Ambik ¯akhan. d. a, since that prophesies that the site will become a great cremation ground (171.133c–134b): kot.¯ıvars. am idam.sth ¯anam. m ¯at¯r.n.¯am. priyam uttamam k ´sma´s ¯anam. pravaram. divyam. bhavis. yati sukhapradam.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

verse by the east-Indian poet Bhasoka; ¯533 and (3) the goddess beneath the foot of Sam ´. vara/Vajravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı is depicted as emaciated, with sunken eyes and withered breasts, holding a skull-bowl and chopping knife in her two hands.534 The ema ciated Carcikas of our surviving images have four, six, eight, or ten arms, but the ¯ skull-bowl (kap ¯alam) and chopping knife (kartrik ¯a) are indeed among their four primary attributes, the other two being the trident and a severed head.535 The goddess beneath the right foot is, as it were, the east-Indian Carcika reduced to ¯ essentials: the emaciated body, the red colour, and only two arms, brandishing what were felt to be her two most basic attributes. 

It is inconceivable, therefore, that east-Indians, for whom S´ akta ¯ Saivism was ´ so central, then as now, would not have been conscious of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva guise ´ of this new Buddhism; and it is equally inconceivable that they would have been blind to the fact that the humilated goddess supine beneath Sam ´. vara’s and Va jravar¯ ah¯ ¯ı’s feet was the pre-eminent goddess of the east-Indian S´ akta tradition. ¯ 

Clearly the east-Indian Buddhists who developed this iconography chose this goddess precisely because she occupied so prominent a position in that tradition and therefore would be instantly recognized. 

In explanation of why this profound transformation of Buddhism occurred, we might be tempted to say that Buddhism was simply yielding ever more com pletely to the S´ akta ¯ Saiva religious tradition then dominant in the region, failing, ´ as it were, to maintain its original purity in the face of this external pressure and the concomitant expectations of its patrons. This was perhaps how the matter would have been represented by the Sr´ avakay ¯ anists; and no doubt there is some ¯ truth in this assessment, since it is extremely unlikely that east-Indian Bud dhists would have chosen to develop this new manifestation of their religion if S´ akta ¯ Saivism had not become the pre-eminent religious idiom of the region. But ´

the iconography of the humiliation of Carcika and Bhairava and the extensive ¯ learned literature that developed around the kernel of the Yogin¯ıtantras alert us to the fact that those who created and refined this tradition saw the matter in an entirely different light. In their view they were not succumbing passively to an alien influence. Fully conscious that they were assimilating the dominant S´ akta ¯ Saiva idiom of the region, they justified their doing so as a means of converting ´ non-Buddhists, taking their practices and encoding them with Buddhist mean ing so that outsiders could rise effortlessly through what was familiar to them to what would save them, a view exactly reflected in Jayadratha’s myth of the com pilation of anti-Saiva iconography, ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva liturgy, Mantras, and Buddhist ´ doctrine as a means of luring devout Saivas away from their faith. ´ 

For while the learned literature of Tantric Buddhism claims with sincere conviction that its special methods are designed for exceptionally able aspirants within the Buddhist fold,536 its point of entry, namely initiatory introduction be fore the Man. d. ala, was designed to facilitate the recruitment of those outside it and to this end access was rendered as easy as possible. Thus in the seventh century the Mah ¯avairocan ¯abhisam. bodhi sets out a number of qualities to be sought in candidates but states that if even only one of these is present there is no need to investigate further;537 and in the eight century the Sarvatath ¯agata 

536 See, for example, the doctrine of the four points of superiority of the Tantric form of the Mahay¯ ana, the Mantranaya, over the non-Tantric Way of the Perfections ¯ (p ¯aramit ¯anayah.) asserted in the *Nayatrayaprad¯ıpa by an author whose name ap pears in the Tenjur as Tripit.akamala, an implausible name, perhaps an error for Tripit.akamalla (Tshul gsum gyi sgron ma, f. 16v3: de yang pha rol tu phyin pa’i theg pa chen po dang don gcig pa las de’i khyad par gang dag yod pa de brjod par bya’o | don gcig nyid ’ang ma rmongs dang | thabs mang dka’ ba med phyir dang | dbang po rnon po’i dbang byas pas | sngags kyi bstan bcos khyad par ’phags ‘More over, although there may be no difference in the goal [of the Mantramahay¯ ana] ¯ from that of the Paramit ¯ amah ¯ ay¯ ana the points that distinguish [the former] should ¯ be stated[. This has been done done in the following verse]: “Though the goal is one and the same the Mantras´astra is superior (1) because it is free of delusion ¯ [on the path], (2) because it offers many methods [for reaching the goal], (3) be cause it is free of difficulties, and (4) because only those with the highest capacity are qualified [to undertake it]”’. The Sanskrit of the verse is preserved through citation (without attribution) in the Tattvaratn ¯aval¯ı of Advayavajra (p. 8) (A), the Sthitisam ¯asa of his disciple Sahajavajra (f. 11v2 [6.5]) (B), and the anonymous Subh ¯as.itasam. graha (part 2, p. 31) (C): ek ¯arthatve ’py asam. moh ¯ad *bah ¯up ¯ay ¯ad (AB Tib.

It has also been cited by Ka ro pa (Karop ¯ a?), wrongly ¯ attributing it to a *Prad¯ıpoddyotanatantra (sgron ma gsal ba’i rgyud), in his com mentary on the Caturmudr ¯anvaya (MATHES 2008, p. 96). According to the view of some, as reported by Gzhon nu dpal, Ka ro pa was another disciple of Advayavajra (Blue Annals, pp. 842–843, 847–849, reported by MATHES [2008, p. 89] as saying that he was a disciple of Advayavajra’s disciple Vajrapan¯ .i).

According to the Zhen Yuan Catalogue ¯ of A.D. 800 (T. 2157–935a:26) the Chinese translation of this text (T. 1007) was pre pared by an unknown translator of the Liang dynasty (503–557).

540 This is the practice otherwise known as p ¯urvasev ¯a. It consists of a high number of repetitions of a Mantra along with ascetic restraints by means of which the practitioner qualifies himself to undertake procedures that require its use.

[Only] then can the rituals be undertaken.’ This, barring the specifically Buddhist vows, is exactly as prescribed in the Saiva ´ Mantramarga, where, as here, the terms ¯ p ¯urvasev ¯a and pura´scaran. am/pura´scary ¯a are standard and synonymous.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

hopes fulfilled in accordance with their desires. Venerable [Tathagatas], there are ¯ (3) people who cannot grasp the nature of the understanding of the Mahay¯ ana of ¯ all the Tathagatas because they are attached to dancing, singing, joking, amuse- ¯ ments, and the pleasures of eating, and [so] take initiation before the Man. d. alas of other[, non-Buddhist] families of deities. Being afraid of the moral regulations [of Buddhism] they do not enter the Man. d. alas of the family of all the Buddhas, which comprise the fulfilment of all aspirations, which bestow the highest happiness, de light, and joy. It is for these too, who are inclined to enter the way of Man. d. alas that lead to bad rebirths, that this entry into the Man. d. ala of Vajradhatu is ap- ¯ propriate, so that they may experience every happiness and delight, the highest Siddhi, joy, and contentment and be turned aside from the path that leads them to enter all [Man. d. alas that result in] bad rebirths. Venerable [Tathagatas], there ¯ are also (4) pious persons, who seek the Buddhas’ enlightenment by means of the morality (´s¯ılam), concentrations (sam ¯adhih.), and wisdom (praj ˜n ¯a) of all the Tathagatas but who experience hardship as they strive to attain the levels of the ¯ meditations (dhy ¯anam), liberations (vimoks. ah.), and the other [states on the path taught in the Paramit ¯ anaya]. They will easily attain All-Buddha-hood without ¯ difficulty in this very life (atraiva), all the more so other Siddhis, simply by enter ing this Man. d. ala of Vajradhatu. ¯ 

Thus the text offered Man. d. ala initiation not only to Buddhists, and in par ticular to those who had found themselves unable to progress on the exacting path of the Paramit ¯ anaya, but also to sinners and sensualists regardless of their ¯ religion, and, most important in the present context, to outsiders who had al ready taken a non-Buddhist Tantric initiation or might otherwise be expected do so. 

The Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha does not tell us whether it has particu lar kinds of non-Buddhist Tantrics in mind. We can only guess from the character of the initiation ceremony, with its emphasis on possession, and the cult to which initiation leads, with its erotic and sensual elements, that S´ akta ¯ Saivas must ´ have been intended. Later sources, however, do make clear that it is indeed the non-Buddhist followers of the kinds of practice being adapted by the Buddhists that are in mind. Thus Anandagarbha, the period of whose activity, though not ¯ yet narrowly determined, may be assigned to the ninth century,541 attempting 

541 The dating of Anandagarbha in the ninth century seems probable solely on the ¯ grounds of the range of his exegesis, which covers the Yogatantra systems of the Sarvatath ¯agataattvasam. graha (his Sarvavajrodaya, his commentaries on the Sarvatath ¯agatatattvasam. graha [Toh. 2511]), the ¯ Param ¯adya (his commentary [Toh. 2512]), the ¯ M ¯ay ¯aj ¯ala (his commentary [Toh. 2513]), ¯ Guhyasam ¯aja (his com mentary [Toh. 1917]), and the ¯ Sarvabuddhasam ¯ayogad.¯akin¯ıj ¯ala´sam. vara (his com mentary on the Sarvakalpasamuccaya [Toh. 1662]). In the last of these Tantric ¯ systems we also have in Sanskrit but not in Tibetan translation his Vajrajv ¯aloday ¯a n ¯ama ´sr¯ıherukas ¯adhanopayik ¯a in a codex photographed by Rahula S ¯ a¯nkr ˙ .tyayana ¯ 

[[236]]

in his commentary on the Guhyasam ¯ajatantra to explain the extraordinary fact that the place where the Buddha is said to have been residing at the time that he revealed this Tantra is the vaginas of the goddesses, declares:542 

If it is asked why he was residing in their private parts, the answer is [that this is] in order to bring it about that those devoted to the Tantras of Vis.n. u and the other [gods], who have not yet abandoned [their attachment to] the objects of the senses, may come through desire itself to delight in the abandoning of desire. For they seek to attain the Siddhis of such [gods] as Vis.n. u by resorting to women, and using such [offerings] as beef and urine. Those engaged in the quest for the Siddhis taught by these [gods do indeed] copulate with women [for this purpose]. For [it is said in their texts]: “Vis.n. u is Bhagavan [‘the possessor of ¯ bhaga-’] in that he resides in the genitals (bhaga-) of women. He is called Nar¯ ayan ¯ . a [for the same reason,] because [by residing there] he gives pleasure to men”.543 

in the Ngor monastery in Tibet which comprises apart from this work forty-one items pertaining to the cult of Hevajra (ISAACSON 1999). The dating is supported by the tradition (Blue Annals, p. 373) that he was a pupil of D¯ıpankarabhadra, who ˙ was a pupil of Buddhajn˜ana, a contemporary of king Dharmap ¯ ala (r. ¯ c. 775–812) (see here p. 93).

When this is not thought to be adequately revealed through ordinary grammatical analysis one may resort to an analysis in which the meaning sought is discovered by deriving one or more of a word’s syl lables from a verbal root that resembles it in sound. See the analysis of Yaska’s ¯ statement of this principle in KAHRS 1998, pp. 35–39. In this case the name is made to mean ‘he who gives pleasure to men’. The first component in this analy sis of n ¯ar ¯ayan. ah. was evidently n ¯ara-, understood as either as ‘sons of man’ (nara-) by As.t.¯adhy ¯ay¯ı 4.3.120 (tasyedam; cf. Manusmr.ti 1.10ab in another nirvacanam of n ¯ar ¯ayan. ah.: ¯apo n ¯ar ¯a iti prokt ¯a ¯apo vai naras ¯unavah.), or as ‘men’ (nara-) by ap plication of As.t.¯adhy ¯ay¯ı 6.3.136 (anyes.¯am api dr.´syate) to account for non-standard lengthening of the first vowel. For these two alternatives see Kulluka on ¯ Manusmr.ti 1.10ab and Medhatithi on the same for the second. Since ¯ aya- can mean ‘good for tune’, I speculate that the author found his meaning by deriving the last syllable, -na, from √n¯ı- ‘to lead [to]’, arriving by this artifice at ‘he who leads men to good fortune, i.e. happiness’ (n ¯ar ¯an ayam.sukham. nayat¯ıti n ¯ar ¯ayan. ah.), the substitu tion of n.for n being caused by the preceding r. The artificial derivation of -na from √n¯ı- is seen in the semantic analysis of sam ¯anah.for the fourth of the five vi tal energies implicit in, e.g., Ni´sv ¯asanaya 4.124ab (Ni´sv ¯asatattvasam. hit ¯a f. 40r3) (> Svacchandatantra 7.308d): sam ¯anah.samat ¯am. nayet, and S ¯ardhatri´satik ¯alottara

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

It comes as a surprise that Anandagarbha attributes the extreme Tantric ¯ practices that he details here to Vais.n. avas, since nothing of this kind has been noted in their known literature. Because of this and because the use of female consorts, cow-flesh, urine and other products of the male and female body in the propitiation of deities for the attaining of supernatural powers or effects appears in our sources to be the hallmark of the Saiva Vidy ´ ap¯ ¯ıt.ha, and of the Picumata in particular,544 it is tempting to propose that Anandagarbha has made a mistake ¯ 

and that had he been better informed or less careless he would have attributed these practices to those whom we know to have adopted them. But this cannot easily be accepted in the light of the fact that he backs up his attribution by citing a verse that supports it. I conclude, therefore, that his claim is rather evi dence that some Vais.n. avas had assimilated the transgressive, S´ akta ¯ Saiva style ´ of observance, just as the Buddhists had. In any case, whatever the accuracy of this attribution, it is extremely unlikely that Anandagarbha did not also have ¯ the S´ akta ¯ Saivas in mind when he referred to “those devoted to the Tantras of ´ Vis.n. u and other [gods]”. 

Similarly Sraddh ´ akaravarman, one of the Indian teachers of the Ti- ¯ betan translator Rin chen bzang po (958–1055), says in his *Yoganiruttara 

10.10cd: samam. nayati g ¯atres.u sam ¯ano n ¯ama m ¯arutah..

tantr ¯arth ¯avat ¯arasam. graha, referring to the Yogatantras as the Tantras of Method (Upayatantras) and to the Yogin ¯ ¯ıtantras as the Tantras of Wisdom (Prajn˜atantras): ¯545 

A Method Tantra is one in which the Man. d. ala shows mainly male deities in order to train (vin¯ı-) men and insiders (svay ¯uthya-), whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one in which, in order to train women and non-Buddhist outsiders (b ¯ahyat¯ırthika-), the Man. d. ala shows mainly female deities, deities, that is, who are appropriate for these.546 A Method Tantra is one that exhibits deities that purify the outer and inner aggregates of personality (skandh ¯ah.), the elements (dh ¯atavah.), and the faculties and their objects (¯ayatan ¯ani), whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one that exhibits deities that purify the outer and inner channels of the vital energy (n ¯ad.¯ı) and the Bodhicitta [semen]. A Method Tantra is one that exhibits deities [whose appearance and conduct are] in conformity with the [norms of] the world, whereas a Wisdom Tantra is one that exhibits deities [whose appearance is] contrary to [these norms of] the world. 

Since Sraddh ´ akaravarman states here that the predominance of female deities ¯ is designed to recruit non-Buddhists he can mean only the followers of S´ akta ¯ Saivism, since there is no other known group to whom this feature would have ´ been particularly appealing. As for the other features that he identifies as dis tinctive of the Yogin¯ıtantras, he does not state explicitly that they were intro duced with the same purpose in mind; but it seems to me probable that he means this to be understood, since the transgressive character of these deities, his third distinctive feature, is indeed a fundamental characteristic of the goddesses wor shipped by these outsiders. 

The Buddhism sponsored by the Palas had come a long way: too far, in fact, ¯ for those conservative Buddhist monks at Vajrasana who adhered to the ancient ¯

THE REFLUX OF BUDDHIST S´ AKTISM INTO THE ¯ S´ AKTISM OF ¯ BENGAL. In deed, Buddhism had assimilated the S´ akta ¯ Saiva style of religion so thoroughly ´ that some of its creations went on to be adopted into the later S´ akta ¯ Saivism of ´ eastern India with little or no revision. This is the case with the goddesses Chin namasta and Ugrat ¯ ar¯ a. The Buddhist origin of Chinnamast ¯ a is certain, since ¯ her S´ akta Mantra is ¯ SR´ ¯IM. HR¯IM. KL¯IM. AIM. VAJRAVAIROCAN¯IYE HUM¯. HUM¯. PHAT. SVAH¯ A¯, and the two companions that flank her are D. akin ¯ ¯ı and Varn.in¯ı.548 In the Buddhist prototype the flanking goddesses are Vajravarn. an¯ı and Vajravairocan¯ı, and the Mantra for recitation (j ¯apamantrah.) is OM.

It is probable that Sarvanandan ¯ atha, who wrote his ¯ work in Senhati in what is now Bangladesh, was born around the beginning of the fifteenth century.553 It is tempting to assume that the Phetk ¯arin.¯ı was written at a time closer to S´ a¯svatavajra’s than to Sarv ´ anandan ¯ atha’s, that is to ¯ 

namasta shining like ten million suns, holding her own [severed] head in her left ¯ hand, fearsome, with the mouth [of her severed head] open wide, with the tip of her tongue licking greedily, drinking the stream of blood that gushes from her neck, her hair loosened, adorned with various flowers, holding a chopping-knife in her right hand, adorned with a garland of heads, naked, most terrible, standing in the Pratyal¯ ¯ıd.ha posture, with a necklace of bones and a snake as her sacred thread, standing on Kama and Rati’. ¯

His B ¯ahyap ¯uj ¯avidhi (= S ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a 252), Hastap ¯uj ¯avidhi (= S ¯adhanam ¯al ¯a 253), and Cakrasam. varabalividhi are found in the series of ritual texts published in FINOT 1934 from a manuscript brought to China in 1057 by the Dhyana master Baocang on his return from India. His ¯ S ¯adhana of Ugratar¯ a is found in the * ¯ S ¯adhana´sataka (a facsimile of an undated Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscript from Tibet has been published in BUHNEMANN ¨ 1994 = Toh. 3306 ff.) and was translated into Tibetan by the Indian Pan ¯ . d.ita *Amogha vajra and the Tibetan monk Bari Rin chen grags of Khams (Toh. 3373; DT, Rgyud, ¯ Mu, f. 49v1, colophon: rgya nag po’i rim pa’i sgrol ma’i sgrub thabs slob dpon rtag pa’i rdo rjes mdzad brjogs so | pa n. d.i ta don yod rdo rje dang khams pa lo ts ¯a ba dge slong ba ris bsgyur cing zhus so).

say, when the Buddhist Mantranaya was still at its height in eastern India, be fore the destruction of the great monasteries around 1200. But this destruction did not eliminate Tantric Buddhism and its literature from the region at a sin gle stroke. For it was still alive in the early fifteenth century, when Vanaratna (1384–1468) travelled to Tibet in 1426, 1433, and 1453, gave various Tantric ini tiations, notably in the K ¯alacakra according to the system of Anupamaraks.ita, and assisted in the translation of Tantric texts, as is attested in the biography of this extraordinary figure given by Gzhon nu dpal (1392–1481), 554 who col laborated with him in a translation of the *Trayoda´s ¯atmaka´sr¯ıcakrasam. vara man. d. alavidhi (Toh. 1489). We also have the ¯ Vanaratnastotrasaptaka, a San skrit hymn in praise of Vanaratna composed during his lifetime by a devout lay Buddhist Aditya, whom both the Sanskrit and Tibetan colophons say was ¯ a native of Magadha;555 and we have a manuscript of the Mahay¯ ana classic ¯ Bod hicary ¯avat ¯ara copied by a lay Buddhist in Bengali characters at Ven. ugrama in ¯ 1436.556 

After her incorporation from the Mantranaya Tar¯ a became with Daks ¯ .inakal¯ ¯ı and Tripurasundar¯ı one of the three principal deities in the east-Indian S´ akta ¯ 

system of the ten Mahavidy ¯ as, which soon became widely disseminated through- ¯ out the subcontinent. Thus in a passage cited from the scripture J ˜n ¯anadv¯ıpa in 

the Sarvoll ¯asatantra (3.1–29) the ten Mahavidy ¯ as are said to be [Daks ¯ .in. a]kal¯ ¯ı (Sy´ am¯ a), T ¯ ar¯ a, and Tripurasundar ¯ ¯ı (S. od. as´¯ı), with the third dividing into eight: herself and the seven others that make up the total of ten, namely Bhuvanesvar ´ ¯ı, Bhairav¯ı, Chinnamasta, Dh ¯ um¯ avat ¯ ¯ı, Bagalamukh ¯ ¯ı, Mata ¯ ng˙ ¯ı, and Kamala. The ¯ centrality of these three goddesses is reflected in the corpus of east-Indian S´ akta ¯ scriptures. The Tod. alatantra teaches the rites of these three alone, and the Br.hann¯ılatantra follows the same model but adds Kam¯ akhy ¯ a, the great goddess ¯ of Assam. Their centrality is also evident among the Paippaladin Atharvavedins ¯ of Orissa; for when they absorbed the influence of the S´ aktism of Bengal in the ¯ latest stratum of their diverse A ˙ngirasakalpa ¯ corpus it was principally the rites of Daks.in. akal¯ ¯ı and Tar¯ a that they adopted. ¯557

THE JAINS’ ADAPTATION OF THE S´ AIVA MANTRAS´ ASTRA ¯ 

Jainism too enjoyed royal support during this period, notably in western India under the Caulukyas and in Karn. ataka among the Ga ¯ ngas of Tal ˙ .akad¯ ., the Ras¯ .t.rakut¯ .as, and Hoysal.as;558 and it too developed a Tantric ritual culture along Saiva lines for the propitiation ( ´¯ar ¯adhan ¯a) of Mantra-goddesses for mun 

dane benefits using Mudras, Japa, and offerings into fire ( ¯ homah.). Among god desses worshipped in Jaina rites for such purposes are Laks.m¯ı and Vag¯ ¯ısvar ´ ¯ı (Sarasvat¯ı) belonging to the higher world, the Vidyadev ¯ ¯ıs belonging to the mid dle,559 and, most important, in the lower world the Yaks.¯ı attendants of the T¯ırthankaras, associated with major Jaina pilgrimage sites, notably Ambik ˙ a¯ 

(/Kus¯ .man¯ . d.in¯ı), the attendant of Neminatha at Girn ¯ ar, Cakre ¯ svar ´ ¯ı, the attendant of R.s.abha at Satru ´ njaya, Padm ˜ avat ¯ ¯ı, the attendant of Par¯ svan ´ atha at ¯ Sravan ´. a Bel.gol.a, and Jval¯ am¯ alin ¯ ¯ı, the attendant of Candraprabha.560 That these deities were developed on the basis of the Saiva tradition ´ 

is more transparently obvious here than in Buddhism. Thus the Bhairava padm ¯avat¯ıkalpa, the Digambara Mallis.en. a’s Paddhati on the propitiation of Padmavat ¯ ¯ı, written in 1057 equates her with Totala, Tvarit ¯ a, Nity ¯ a, Tripur ¯ a, ¯ and Tripurabhairav¯ı, all well-known Mantra-goddesses of the S´ akta ¯ Saivas. ´ 561 

558 See STEIN 1998, especially pp. 147–152. 

559 In the classical listing these are the following eighteen: Rohin.¯ı, Prajnapti, ˜ Vajrasr´.nkhal ˙ a, Vajr ¯ a¯nku ˙ s´a, Apraticakr ¯ a, Purus ¯ .adatta, K ¯ al¯ ¯ı, Mahak¯ al¯ ¯ı, Gaur¯ı, Gandh ¯ ar¯ ¯ı, Sarvastramah ¯ ajv ¯ al¯ a, M ¯ anav ¯ ¯ı, Vairot.ya, Acchupt ¯ a, M ¯ anas ¯ ¯ı, and Maham¯ anas ¯ ¯ı.

[[243]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Unlike Saivism, Pa ´ ncar ˜ atra, and Tantric Buddhism in its mature form, ¯ Jaina Tantrism did not claim to offer Jainas a new path to liberation. It remained entirely focused on mundane benefits. Nonetheless it was not the preserve of the laity. Monks produced the manuals and monks were held to perform these propitiations. Thus Yasobhadras ´ uri and other Mantra-adepts ¯ (m ¯antrik ¯ah.) use the power that they have obtained by propitiating the goddess Kurukulla to unblock the throat of Dev ¯ ac¯ arya when on the sixteenth day of a ¯ debate in the court of the Caulukya Siddharaja between him and the Digambara ¯ Kumudacandra the latter had used his supernatural power to silence him by causing him to choke;562 the Jaina Guru of king Ajayapala undertakes a ¯ two-month propitiation of Ambika on the Raivataka mountain at Girn ¯ ar in ¯ order to gain for himself the boon of equality with the renowned Svet ´ ambara ¯ Hemacandra and for his patron that of equality with Kumarap ¯ ala, the great ¯ Caulukya king of Gujarat.563 Hemacandra, Devendrasuri, and Malayagiris ¯ uri ¯ go to the same mountain at night to undertake the propitiation of the Siddha cakramantra, after first performing preliminary rites to summon the presiding goddess Ambika into their presence; ¯564 and Hemacandra propitiates the spell goddess Tribhuvanasvamin ¯ ¯ı in An. ahillapattana, the Caulukya capital, in order to ask her about the previous birth of his pupil Kumarap ¯ ala. ¯565 

As in the non-Jaina tradition the goddesses were put to work to serve the interests of rulers.

are said to have invoked Aparajit ¯ a to secure the king victory in battle; ¯567 and these powers are fully confirmed by the manuals for these rites. According to the unpublished Jv ¯al ¯am ¯alin¯ıkalpa, composed by the Digambara Indranandin in Karn. at¯ .aka in 939, the benefits that can be attained by propitiating Jval¯ am¯ alin ¯ ¯ı include the splitting open of the gates of enemy forts; and the Bhairava padm ¯avat¯ıkalpa teaches a spell (vidy ¯a) for making one’s enemies fall asleep and magical receipts both for causing dissension among them (vidves. an. am) and causing their death (m ¯aran. am). Moreover, Padmavat ¯ ¯ı was the lineage goddess (kuladev¯ı) of a number of Jaina ruling houses in Karn. at¯ .aka568 and functioned in this capacity much as she would have done if they had not been converted. Thus she appears in a local manifestation as the Padmavat ¯ ¯ı of Sa´ sakapura (Sosav ´ uru) ¯ in a Jaina myth of the origin of the name of the Hoysal.a (/Poysal.a) dynasty related in an inscription of 1133.569 When a Jaina ascetic Yogin was trying to subjugate this goddess with a Mantra and a tiger sprang out to break its power the ascetic commanded king Sal.a, saying “Strike [it], O Sal.a” (poy sal.a).570 The king then worshipped the goddess under the name Vasantik ¯ a. Since this story ¯ introduces an account of the conquests of the dynasty it is probable that the goddess is seen here in the manner of the martial lineage goddesses of the S´ akta ¯ Saiva type venerated by non-Jaina kings during the early medieval period as ´ the source of their sovereignty and military might. 

In one important respect, however, Jaina lineage goddesses were bound to differ from their non-Jaina counterparts. Since Jainas are the strictest of vege tarians and are rigorously opposed to the harming of any living creature, their goddesses, like those of the Buddhists, had to renounce the animal sacrifices that were so conspicuous a part of their cult in non-Jaina lineages.571 Thus the Osval¯

My pupil Peter-D ´ aniel Sz ´ ant ´ o has kindly informed me (personal communi- ´ cation, 4 March, 2009) that the verses that immediately precede that Mantra in this manuscript, containing the reference to sanguinary offerings, are not part of the original Catus. p¯ıt.ha but have been added from the Catus. p¯ıt.haman. d. alop ¯ayik ¯a of Caryavratip ¯ ada (19.30–33 [f. 20r]).

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Jainas of Rajasthan and Saurashtra hold that their lineage deity Saccika or Sac- ¯ ciya adopted her present non-violence only when she and they were converted ¯ to Jainism by the monk Ratnaprabhasuri, probably in the twelfth century, ¯572 in consequence of his having miraculously cured a boy of snake-bite when he had already been thought dead and prepared for cremation. They claim that be fore their conversion they had been Rajput warriors—a claim also found among other Jain castes—573 and she a fierce Camun ¯ . d. a whom they propitiated with the ¯ Tantric rites of the Vamam ¯ arga. Her pre-Jaina past is still visible in her tem- ¯ ple at Osian near Jodhpur, the Osv ¯ als’ original home. For the outer wall of her ¯ innermost shrine shows images of Camun ¯ . d. a, Mahis ¯ .asuramardin ¯ ¯ı, S´¯ıtala, and a ¯ naked Bhairava.574 

We have another story of the conversion of a lineage goddess in Jaina accounts of the life of the Caulukya king Kumarap ¯ ala of Gujarat (r. 1143– ¯ 1174), who converted from Saivism to Jainism under the influence of the ´ illustrious Svet ´ ambara scholar monk Hemacandra. According to these accounts ¯ Kan.t.hesvar ´ ¯ı, the lineage goddess of the Caulukyas, and the other goddesses associated with her had always been placated during the nine days of the annual

For photographs of the Camun ¯ . d. a and ¯ Mahis.asuramardin ¯ ¯ı see AIISPL, Accession numbers 59386 and 59388. An account of the conversion of Saccika is found in a chronicle, the ¯ Upake´sagacchapat.t.¯aval¯ı, of the monastic community followed by the Osval laity, which ends with the in- ¯ stallation of Siddhasuri in [Vikrama] 1655. See pp. 237–238 of the translation by ¯ HOERNLE (1890), who does not provide the original, for which see AGRAWALA 1954. Ratnaprabhasuri describes Saccik ¯ a in that account as follows (H ¯ OERNLE’s transla tion, p. 237), addressing her former devotees: ‘O ye faithful, ye should not go to the temple of Sachchika-dev ¯ ¯ı; she is merciless, and incessantly delights in hearing the sound of the breaking of bones and the killing of buffaloes, goats, and other animals; the floor of her temple is stained with blood, and it is hung about with festoons of fresh skins; the teachers of her devotion, rites, and service, are cruel men; she is altogether disgusting and horrible’. The text continues: ‘Hearing these words of the Ach ¯arya ¯, they replied,— “What you say, O Lord, is quite true; but if we do not go to worship that cruel Dev¯ı, she will slay us and our families.” The Ach ¯arya ¯, however, promised to protect them; whereupon they ceased to go any longer to the temple of the Dev¯ı’. Ratnaprabhasuri then goes on to convert the goddess, a tradition also ¯ asserted in an inscription of 1598 (CORT 1987, p. 244). Thereafter, it is said, she would accept no sanguinary offerings and not even red flowers, because they resem ble such offerings.

Navaratra festival by the sacrifice of thousands of goats and buffaloes. ¯575 But this stops when Kumarap ¯ ala, now a convert to Jainism, declares a fourteen-year ¯ ban on the taking of life. Kan.t.hesvar ´ ¯ı appears before the king and demands to know why she and the other goddesses have been denied their usual sacrifices. When he explains that he cannot sacrifice to her now that he is a Jaina she is enraged and strikes him on the head with her trident, causing leprous sores to break out on his body. Hemacandra miraculously cures his affliction, tries to persuade the goddess to accept in future offerings of vegetarian food of equal value, and when this fails binds her with a Mantra. Thoroughly humbled, she begs the king to free her, promising that if she is released she will give up her ways and work instead to police his ban on the slaughter of animals throughout his realm. With Hemacandra’s permission he releases her and she takes to her new role as the king’s informer with all the zeal of the convert.576 She reports a vassal king in Sauras¯ .t.ra for secretly butchering goats in his home: Kumarap ¯ ala ¯ sends his minister Udayana at the head of an army to punish him.577 She reports a merchant for plucking a louse from his wife’s head and crushing it: his entire property is seized and the money used to fund the building of a Jaina monastery, named accordingly the Monastery of the Louse (Yuk¯ avih ¯ ara). ¯578 

575 Three thousand seven hundred goats and thirty-seven buffaloes were to be sac rificed: a hundred goats and one buffalo on the first day, two hundred goats and two buffaloes on the second, three hundred goats and three buffaloes on the third, and so on, so that nine hundred goats and nine buffaloes were sacrificed on the ninth (Mahanavam ¯ ¯ı).

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Thus, while drawing heavily on the S´ akta ¯ Saiva tradition of the propitia- ´ tion of Mantra-goddesses, the Jain Mantravada, was bound to keep itself free of ¯ the sanguinary aspects of those cults and, also, one would assume, of all other transgressive elements that would conflict with the ascetic character of the Jaina path, notably the use of flesh and alcohol, and the employment of female consorts. However, that exclusion was not as complete as one would expect in respect of the last of these elements. This is apparent in the accounts of two of the pro pitiations mentioned above. We are told that when Hemacandra, Devendrasuri, ¯ and Malayagirisuri undertook the propitiation of the Siddhacakramantra on the ¯ Raivataka mountain they did so with a Padmin¯ı in the person of the wife of a vil lage headman as their Tantric assistant (uttaras ¯adhakatvena).579 How the wife of the village headman assisted in the propitiation is not stated. But the story of Hemacandra’s propitiation of Tribhuvanasvamin ¯ ¯ı is more explicit. Again he has the assistance of a Padmin¯ı. The daughter-in-law of a farmer is brought to the city for this purpose and the goddess shows her favour after Hemacandra has 

air from An. ahillapattana to Bhr.gupura (Bhr.gukaccha, Bharukaccha, modern Bharuch/Broach) and attempt to tame the Tantric goddess Saindhava, who had ¯ possessed the minister Ambad ¯. a. She shows her contempt for Hemacandra by stick ing out her tongue. Yasa´ scandra punishes her by pounding some grains of rice in ´ a mortar. The first blow causes her temple to quake, and the second and third cause her image to shudder and then be dislodged. She falls at Hemacandra’s feet begging for his protection. See Somatilakasuri’s ¯ Kum ¯arap ¯aladevacarita, vv. 76–85 and Kum ¯arap ¯alaprabodhaprabandha §87. Saindhava is no doubt the Sindhav ¯ a¯¯ı Ma whose temple is located outside the walls of Broach to the north, not far from ¯ the temple of N¯ılakan.t.ha. She was receiving goat sacrifices on Mahanavam ¯ ¯ı up to the 1940s (DESAI 1993, p. 48). According to Somatilakasuri, she was the principal ¯ of the non-Jaina deities of the city. Sindhava¯¯ı Ma also has temples in Ahmedabad, ¯ near Bilimora, and Kayavarohana, Vadodara.

repeated the Mantra for three days on the Padmin¯ı’s vulva (tasy ¯a yonau).580 The text tells us that Hemacandra’s mind remained undisturbed during this prac tice, no doubt wishing to stress that he was not compromising the monastic rule of celibacy. Indeed there is no evidence of which I am aware that the Jaina Mantravada, unlike ¯ Saivism and Tantric Buddhism in its later phases, created ´ two levels of discipline, one for ordinary practitioners and one for an elite that ´ transcended the rules that apply to the first. Nonetheless, we see from this story that it had gone surprisingly far in this direction, too far for some, one suspects, who would have preferred monks to avoid any practice in which they could be suspected of departing from the straight and narrow Jain path of purification. 

S´ AIVISM IN THE BRAHMANICAL SUBSTRATE 

As for the long-established brahmanical tradition, the Saivas saw it as sub- ´ sumed within their own, accepting it as the only valid source of authority in what they saw as the lesser domain of mundane religion (laukiko dharmah.). This per ception is much emphasised in their literature,581 and it is expressed through the

The treasurer said: “Give me the wife of your youngest son”. [The farmer] said: “Is this an order?”. He replied that it was but that he should not be concerned.

The venerable Hemasuri did the Mantra-recitation on her ¯ vulva for three days, intent on eating param ¯annam, with his mind undisturbed [by lust]’. The goddess was pleased’. The food param ¯annam is, I presume, the dish of rice, milk, and sugar or jaggery otherwise known as p ¯ayasam and considered the ideal food for offering to a vegetarian deity.

It ´ was also influenced by them. During this period we find an ever-growing cor pus of traditions that while claiming to be on the brahmanical side of the divide derive from the Saiva, both ´ Saiva devotional literature assigned to the Pur ´ an¯ . as and a form of worship that followed Saiva models. In Pur ´ an¯ .ic texts such as the Uttarabh ¯aga of the Li ˙ngapur ¯an. a,583 the K ¯alik ¯apur ¯an. a, the Dev¯ıpur ¯an. a, and the Agnipur ¯an. a,584 the boundary between the Smarta and Tantric domains has ¯ almost completely dissolved, prompting the conservative brahmanical author Ballalasena, the twelfth-century Sena king of Gaud ¯ . a, to reject them as invalid as sources of the knowledge of religious duty, objecting particularly to their con taining instruction on such matters as Saiva initiation and idol consecration. ´ 585 In reality there was no reasonable hope of turning the tide by this period, as had to be conceded even by so conservative an authority as the Nibandha on the Y ¯aj ˜navalkyasmr.ti compiled by or under Aparaditya, the ¯ Sil ´ ah¯ ara king ¯ of Konkan ˙ . a in the last quarter of the twelfth century. While firmly denying in general the validity of the practices taught in the Saiva scriptures, it admits a ´ 

partial exception in the case of the Sthapaka, the priest who consecrates idols ¯ and shrines. It is admitted that he may draw on these texts to supplement the 

He should remain in the discipline in which he was when he was initiated into the Saiva religion and [at the same time] maintain the ordinances of ´ Siva’; see S ´ ANDER SON 1988, p. 662 (= 1990, p. 139); 1995, p. 23; 2005a, p. 389; 2007a, pp. 231–232. The Saivas’ understanding of how the relation between the general, Vaidika ordi- ´ nances and those of the Saiva scriptures should be perceived is explored at length ´ in SANDERSON forthcoming b. 

582 We see this combination in the case of the Pan¯ . d.uvam. sins/P ´ an¯ . d. avas of Mekala in ¯ the fifth century (SHASTRI 1995, nos. II: I–II), the Sailodbhava M ´ adhavar ¯ aja of ¯ Kongod ˙ . a in the seventh (EI 6:14), the Pallavas Paramesvaravarman I ( ´ c. 669–690) and Narasim. havarman II (c. 690–728/9) (MAHALINGAM 1988, nos. 45, 53) around the turn of the seventh and eighth, the Bhanja Net ˜ .t.abhanja of Orissa in the eighth ˜ (EI 28:41, ll. 16–17), the descendants of King Nimbara of Kartikeyapura in Hi- ¯ machal Pradesh in the ninth and tenth (EI 31:38), and the Eastern Calukyas in ¯ the eleventh (EI 6:35; EI 6:36).

ritual of consecration when installing a Siva, and likewise on the other appropri- ´ ate bodies of non-Vedic scripture when consecrating images of the Goddess and the like, provided that his Vedic procedure needs to be supplemented, provided that the imported auxiliary does not offend the Vedic procedure in any way, and provided that he does not take the initiations (d¯ıks.¯a) which those scriptures re quire.586 In other words it had to be conceded that a hybrid of Tantric and Vedic rituals procedures was already an institutional reality; and that this was so is confirmed by a Saiva source, which protests against their existence, insisting ´ that patrons should engage only initiated Saiva officiants of full conviction, who ´ would perform Saiva rituals of consecration uncontaminated by such hybridiza- ´ tion.587 

586 This position is established at length in the course of the commentary on Y ¯aj ˜navalkyasmr.ti 1.7, which lists the valid sources of knowledge of religious duty (dharmam ¯ulam), namely Sruti, Smr ´.ti, and observation of the practice of exemplary brahmins, supplemented by personal judgement and preference where the other sources of knowledge leave scope for them. Aparaditya consid- ¯ ers at length and rejects the proposition that the scriptures of the Pa¯supatas, ´ Saivas, P ´ a¯ncar ˜ atrikas, and others not rooted in the Veda ( ¯ vedam ¯ula-) should be added to the list (vol. 1, p. 10, l. 6 ff.).

The same should be understood to apply in the case of initiation. For in the initiation established in the Puran¯ . as the [objectionable Saiva] rite of the elim- ´ ination of [the initiand’s] caste is lacking. . . . Equally, in the case of rituals for the installation [of the image of a deity and the like only the procedure taught in Puran¯ . as and [related texts] may be adopted, since the Bhavis. yatpur ¯an. a acknowl edges none but these as sources of valid knowedge of hybrid religious duty’. By ‘hybrid’ (vy ¯ami´sra-) Aparaditya means procedures that incorporate auxiliary ele- ¯ ments from the Tantras. The issue of this hybrid installation rituals is taken up in detail on pp. 16, l. 1–19, l. 12. 

587 This source is the Saiddhantika scripture ¯ Devy ¯amata. It devotes several verses to distinguishing types of Sthapaka and to exhorting patrons to avoid all but one, ¯ who is described as learned both in the general Saiva scriptures and in the special- ´ ized Tantras of Installation, as content with the teaching of Siva, focused wholely ´ upon it, strictly adhering to the discipline of the initiated (samay ¯ac ¯arah.), with out any inclination towards the scriptures of the uninitiated (pa´su´s ¯astram), tak ing no pleasure in the mundane religion, but delighting in the religion of Siva ´ alone: (2.16cd, 17ab, 19ab, 20ab): ¯ac ¯aryah.´siva´s ¯astraj ˜nah. pratis.t.h ¯atantrap ¯aragah.k . . . 17 ´siva´s ¯astr ¯arthasam.tus.t.ah.samay ¯ac ¯arap ¯alakah.| . . . 19ab ´siva´s ¯astraikacitt ¯atm ¯a pa´su´s ¯astrapar ¯a ˙nmukhah.| . . . 20 virakto laukike dharme ´sivadharm ¯anura ˜njitah.. Sthapakas to be avoided are those who are Vaidika in their religious commit- ¯ ment and learning. Some of these have no more than a partial knowledge of the Tantras of Installation; but they should be avoided even if they mastered both the Tantras of Installation and the general Saiva scriptures (2.7–8b and 2.13–14): ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Instances of incorporation of Saiva ritual in the Sm ´ arta domain can be ad- ¯ duced from most regions and periods;588 but perhaps the most striking because it was so widely disseminated and accepted by those who considered themselves to be on the Smarta side of the divide is represented by the ¯ Prapa ˜ncas ¯ara attributed to Sa´ nkar ˙ ac¯ arya and the closely related ¯ S ¯arad ¯atilaka ´ of Laks.man. adesika. These ´ two texts, which, I have argued, were composed in Orissa or on the basis of Oris san tradition, most probably in the twelfth century,589 present a system of ritual that differs from the properly Tantric only in its catholic character—in Smarta ¯ fashion it includes rituals of propitiation for all the main deities—, its avoidance of all the elements of ‘impure’ practice that the Smartas castigated in the ¯ Saiva ´ cults of Bhairava and the Goddess, and its expurgation of doctrines that were contrary to what could be found in acceptably brahmanical sources, notably the doctrine of the thirty-six levels of reality (tattv ¯ani). 

THE CAUSES OF THE DOMINANCE OF SAIVISM ´ 

Saivism, then, was undoutedly the most successful among the religious sys- ´ tems that received royal patronage during the early medieval period. It was the most commonly adopted. Of the others some were absorbed by it and the rest while flourishing independently beside it came to remodel themselves along Saiva lines. ´ 

No doubt there were many factors that led to Saivism’s rise to dominance ´ within this complex environment, and no doubt many of these will remain in visible to us, since they could be discerned and weighed only if we had access to much more detailed evidence of the activities and motivations of individuals and institutions, both religious and political. Nonetheless, I venture a general explanation. 

THE EARLY MEDIEVAL PROCESS 

On the basis of the epigraphical record of acts of patronage, and consider ing evidence of changes over time within the Saivas’ prescriptive literature, I ´

propose that the fundamental reason for the religion’s success, underlying and structuring the mass of particulars now lost to view, was that it greatly increased its appeal to royal patrons by extending and adapting its repertoire to contain a body of rituals and theory that legitimated, empowered, or promoted key ele ments of the social, political and economic process that characterizes the early medieval period. 

These elements were: 

1. the spread of the monarchical model of government through the emergence of numerous new dynasties at subregional, regional, and supraregional levels; 

2. the multiplication of land-owning temples, both royal temples in nuclear areas and lesser temples in peripheral zones, often established by subor dinate local lords, thus promoting the rural economy and the progressive penetration of the authority of the centre into new territories; 

3. the proliferation of new urban centres, both commercial centres that grew from below through a process of agglomeration, and planned settlements, growths from above, founded by rulers; 

4. the expansion of the agrarian base through the creation of villages, land reclamation, and the construction of water-reservoirs, wells, and other means of irrigation, with the steady growth in population that these de velopments imply; and 

5. the cultural and religious assimilation of the growing population of com munities caught up in this expansion.590 

At the same time it took steps to integrate itself with the brahmanical sub 

590 For this positive characterization of the period I am indebted to the work of a num ber of historians who in recent decades have shown the invalidity of the widespread view that it was a time of decline, de-urbanization, fragmentation, and general im poverishment in the aftermath of a glorious classical age that culminated under the Gupta kings and ended with their demise. I acknowledge in particular the research, conclusions, and hypotheses of Noboru KARASHIMA (1984), R. CHAMPAKALAKSHMI (1986), Hermann KULKE (1990, 1995a, b), Brajadulal CHATTOPADHYAYA (1994), Upinder SINGH (1994), Burton STEIN (1994, 1998), James HEITZMAN (1995), and Cynthia TALBOT (2001). That judgement, which owes more, one suspects, to the concept of the European Dark Ages after the collapse of the Roman empire than to unbiased analysis of India’s epigraphical and archaeological record, has its coun terpart in the not uncommon assessment that these centuries also witnessed a pro gressive degeneration of Sanskritic literary, intellectual, and religious culture. It is refreshing to see that the work of those historians who are engaging vigorously with the epigraphical and archaeological evidence of the age has brought forth a view that is more consonant with the abundant literary evidence of intellectual and aesthetic vigour.

strate in ways that rendered it accessible and acceptable to a far wider con stituency and therefore all the more appealing to rulers in their role as the guardians of the brahmanical social order. 

S´ AIVISM AND MONARCHY 

Saivism’s engagement with the first and most crucial of these elements is ´ apparent in the fact that from the seventh century onwards inscriptions and pre scriptive religious texts reveal that Saiva brahmin Gurus were holding the posi- ´ tion of royal preceptor (r ¯ajaguruh.) in numerous new kingdoms both on the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia and in this capacity empowering and legiti mating the monarch’s rule by granting him Saiva initiation ( ´´sivaman. d. alad¯ıks.¯a). It might be thought that this would have been an unappealing step for any but the most reclusive and ineffectual of kings, since after initiation Saivas were ´ obliged to adhere to a complex and time-consuming program of daily and oc casional rituals. However, early in the development of the Mantramarga, the ¯ Saivas, no doubt in order to extend their recruitment and hence their influence, ´ admitted a category of initiates who in consideration of the fact that they were in capable of taking on these onerous duties were exonerated from doing so.591 The king was considered to qualify for this less arduous route to liberation by reason of his royal obligations. He was therefore required to adhere only to the obli gations of an uninitiated devotee of Siva taught in the texts of the ´ Sivadharma ´ corpus, which in his case were principally to support the religion and its institu tions and to sponsor and appear in conspicuous ceremonies in the civic domain. 

Moreover, according to prescriptive sources the king’s initiation was to be followed by a Saiva modification of the brahmanical royal consecration ceremony ´ (r ¯ajy ¯abhis.ekah.), bestowed both on the king and his chief consort, and also given to the heir apparent at the time that he was consecrated to succeed to his father’s 

591 The distinction between these two categories of initiate, those who receive initi ation with post-initiatory duties (sab¯ıj ¯a d¯ıks.¯a ‘initiation with seed’ ) and those who receive it without (nirb¯ıj ¯a d¯ıks.¯a ‘initiation without seed’), is not present in the earliest Saiddhantika scriptures, namely the corpus of ¯ Ni´sv ¯asa texts found in the Ni´sv ¯asatattvasam. hit ¯a codex, the earliest of which, the M ¯ulas ¯utra, was probably composed at some time between 450 and 550, for which dating see the conclusions of a recent workshop on this text summarized in the newsletter of the Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project (GOODALL and ISAACSON 2007). On the relatively archaic character of the Ni´sv ¯asa corpus see SANDERSON 2001, pp. 22–31 (archaic features listed in fn. 32, pp. 29–31), and SANDERSON 2006. The category of exon erated initiates appears later in the Kiran. a, the P ¯arame´svara, and the Svaccha nda, and, following the latter, in the Paddhatis. The textual evidence is given in SANDERSON forthcoming a.

throne (yuvar ¯aj ¯abhis.ekah.).592 

This new ceremony was added to the purely Saiva consecrations recognized ´ by the core tradition, through which a Saiva Guru empowered an initiate to take ´ office as a Sadhaka ( ¯ s ¯adhak ¯abhis.ekah.), a specialist in Mantra-rituals for super natural effects (siddhih.), and that through which a retiring Guru (¯ac ¯aryah.) con secrated his chosen successor (¯ac ¯ary ¯abhis.ekah.), passing on to him his duties. In this way the monarch was incorporated as a third kind of Saiva initiate, who ´ 

differed from the Sadhaka and the Guru not in the character of the initiation ¯ itself but in the consecration ceremony that followed it: while they were to be consecrated for purely Saiva functions, the king was to be consecrated to take ´ up office as the “head of [the brahmanical social order of] the caste-classes and religious disciplines” (varn.¯a´sramaguruh.),593 the role already assigned to him by brahmanical prescription.594 

As the function of the Saiva consecration is modified in this case, so its form, ´ though in general Saiva, incorporates distinctive non- ´ Saiva elements appropri- ´ ate to its mundane and brahmanical aspects, such as the inclusion of the royal

Just as this brahmanical rite is subsumed within the Saiva process of initia- ´ tion and consecration, so its outcome, the king’s entitlement to rule as guardian of the brahmanical social order now entails the additional requirement or, one might say, compensation to the Saivas for this descent into the mundane, that ´ he should ensure that the authority of brahmanical prescription be subsumed within, and subordinate to, that of the Saiva scriptures, an injunction supported ´ by the promise that by enforcing this hierarchical relationship he will secure the stability of his rule and kingdom, implying that by neglecting to do so he will bring about their collapse.599

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The Saivas also adapted the theory of their ritual practice to enable them to ´ claim that those rulers who underwent their ceremonies would be empowered in their efforts to maintain their supremacy and extend it through conquest. The ceremony of initiation had been conceived as the means of obtaining liberation and was always presented in these terms in theoretical texts. But a fifteenth century Kashmirian scholar can proclaim in a eulogy of his patriline that by receiving initiation from one of his ancestors kings had expelled their enemies and long enjoyed distinguished reigns.600 Similarly, an inscription of the twelfth or thirteenth century from Hariyan¯ . a tells us that the effect of the initiation of King Surap ¯ ala was to give him power beyond that of all his rivals. ¯601 It adds that if his Guru Murtigan ¯ . a initiated a brahmin, a king, or his minister he thereby made them [respectively] the repository of knowledge, the master of all the earth, and the foremost of men.602 In the Malkapuram inscription of ¯ A.D. 1261 we are told that the effect of the initiation given by Visve ´ svara ´ siva to the K ´ akat ¯ ¯ıya prince Rudradeva was to make the might of his [right] arm, that is to say his valour in battle, shine more brilliantly.603 The same notion is apparent in the great Mebon inscription of A.D. 953 of the Khmer monarch Rajendravarman. ¯ 

[one non-Saiva and the other ´ Saiva] and the question of which is valid arises one ´ must privilege the teaching of Siva. The two should be reconciled, as respectively ´ dependent and independent [in their validity], by means of implication and other exegetical tools, *[on the evidence of] the texts [themselves in which those state ments occur], related texts, and commentary (?). Having understood this, Indra, achieve the highest bliss. Provided that the king adheres to religion in this manner, his kingdom will always prosper’.

In a passage describing his marching forth to war it speaks of the ceremony of [Saiva] Man ´. d. ala initiation as intensifying his brilliance, a statement that in the context must be taken to refer to his power to conquer his enemies.604 

Nor was it only the theory that was adjusted to suit their patrons. According to the Br.hatk ¯alottara the Saiva Guru was to close the initiation ceremony by ´ giving abhis.ekah.to the horses, elephants, chariots, and soldiers of the army by sprinkling them with the water from the vase of the Weapon-Mantra (astra 

kala´sah.), one of the two main vases prepared in the course of the ceremony, “in order to remove all obstacles and to ensure victory in battle”.605 The Saivas also ´ 

created a double of their ritual of post-initiatory consecration (abhis.ekah.) to be performed for the king before he entered the fray.606 A much elaborated form of this ‘consecration for victory’ (jay ¯abhis.ekah.), involving S´ akta ¯ Saiva rather than ´ Saiva Mantra-deities and one thousand vases, is taught in the 248 verses of the ´ 

27th chapter of the Uttarabh ¯aga of the Li ˙ngapur ¯an. a. 

They also offered a wealth of apotropaic, invigorative, and hostile Mantra rites that could be performed on demand for the benefit of the realm, to promote the success of royal patrons, and to frustrate their enemies. The evidence for such

rituals in the scriptural literature of the Saivas, especially in its ´ S´ akta ¯ Saiva ´ texts, is pervasive.607 There is also historical evidence of specific performances. For example, an inscription of the fifth year of the reign of the Cola Raj¯ adhir ¯ aja ¯ II (r. 1163–1179 or 1166–1182) from the Tiruval¯ ¯ısvara temple at ´ Arpp ¯ akkam ¯ near Ka¯nc˜ ¯ıpuram608 tells us that when an army from Sri Lanka had invaded 

the Pan¯ . d. ya country, plundered the treasury of the temple of Rame ¯ svaram, and ´ interrupted the cult of Siva there, the emperor, fearing that the war might spread ´ 

approached a certain Jn˜ ana ¯ sivadeva of Gaud ´ . a, who can be seen from his name to have been a Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva Guru, to free the country from this menace ´ by ritual means. The Guru, we are told, then worshipped Siva for this purpose ´ for twenty-eight days continuously, and it was reported subsequently that these ‘attackers of Siva’ ( ´´sivadroh¯ı) had indeed been defeated. The Badaun inscription ¯ of Lakhan. apala praises the R ¯ ajaguru M ¯ urtigan ¯ . a for his expertise in “the great rites of subjection and attraction” (l. 13: va´sy ¯akr.s.t.imah ¯avidh ¯ananipun. ah.); and Hrasvanatha, a Kashmirian Guru of the K ¯ al¯ ¯ıkula who also held office as the minister of peace and war under Yasaskara (r. 939–948), performed a ritual to ´ kill his king and other rituals to cause dissension and immobilize, presumably directed against an invading army.609 

Just as the Guru imbued the king through the ceremonies of initiation and consecration with the numinous power of Sivahood in the exercise of his ´ sovereignty, so the Saiva rites by which the Guru assumed his office ensured ´ that he, as Siva’s agent among men, was imbued with the numen of royalty. As ´ in the brahmanical consecration of a king, in which the royal astrologer was to provide him with the royal elephant, horse, throne, parasol, fly-whisk, sword, bow, and jewels,610 so at the time of a Guru’s consecration he received from his predecessor the non-martial symbols of sovereignty (r ¯aj ¯a ˙ng ¯ani, r ¯ajacihn ¯ani), such as the turban, crown, parasol, sandals, fly-whisk, elephant, horse, and palanquin.611 To these we may add the throne supported by sculpted lions

Furthermore, according to the prescriptions of the Saiva scriptures the ´ residence to be built for the Guru by his royal disciple was in many respects similar in its layout to the royal palace. It included, for example, an arsenal for the storage of weapons of war.616 That Gurus should have needed the

612 For an image of such a throne see, e.g., the eighth-century metal Tar¯ a from Sirpur ¯ (Sr´¯ıpura) in HUNTINGTON 1985, plate 30. The notion that the throne is the very embodiment of sovereignty and imparts its power to the enthroned is already found in the Vedic literature, in the Satapathabr ¯ahman ´. a (12.8.3.4) (GONDA 1966: 45–46): ¯asandy ¯am abhis.i ˜ncati | ¯asand¯ı sad vai s ¯am.r ¯ajyam.s ¯amr ¯ajyenaivainam.s ¯amr ¯ajyam. gamayati ‘He consecrates him by affusion on the throne.

means of warfare may surprise. But a fragmentary inscription of the late tenth century from Kadwah¯ a in the Guna District of Madhya Pradesh relates that ¯ when hostile forces had invaded the region and the king had been slain, the Saiva ascetic Dharma ´ siva, abbot of the Aran ´ .ipadra monastery, went into battle and routed the enemy through his skill as an archer, at the cost of his own life.617 Nor is this an isolated instance. From the Jubbulpore stone inscription of Vimalasiva, R ´ ajaguru of the Kalacuri kings Jayasim ¯ . ha (r. c. 1163–1188) and Vijayasim. ha (r. c. 1188–1210), we learn that the activities of his predecessor K¯ırtisiva, R ´ ajaguru of Narasim ¯ . ha (r. 1153–1163), extended beyond the spiritual to those of a military commander who expanded his monarch’s realm and added to his own through the appropriation of temples in the territories gained.618

617 EI 37:20, ll. 10–16. The inscription is fragmentary, but this much of its meaning is clear: while the ascetic Dharmasiva was in the monastery at Aran ´ .ipada (elsewhere called Aran.ipadra) performing austerities (ten ¯aran.ipadam. n ¯ama kr.tam. padam ani nditam.. . . dattv ¯aran.ipade . . .tasya dharma´siva ity abhavaj jit ¯atm ¯a ´sis. yah.. . .tasy ¯a- ´srame vardhayatas tap ¯am.si [ll. 10–12]) a ruler called Gobhat.a came there with a force of elephants (tatr ¯ajag ¯amonmadasindhur ¯an.¯am. balena bh ¯upah. kila gobhat.¯a khyah.[l. 12]). Someone, perhaps the local ruler, was killed by this king ([nr.]pen. a par ¯agat ¯asuh.sahas ¯a pap ¯ata [ll. 12–13]); and he, evidently Dharmasiva, wept with ´ compassion for a while when he heard the news (tasy ¯avagamya sa kath ¯am. karun.¯a vimuktab ¯as. pah. ks. an. am.[l. 13]), then, flying into a rage (tad anu kopavip ¯at.a[l ¯aks. ah.] [l. 13]), went into battle, a veritable Siva on earth, armed with a bow *that had come ´ [down to him] from Prabhava[ ¯ siva?] (?) ( ´ atha prabh ¯av ¯agatak ¯armuken. a b ¯an. ai´s ca d¯ıptah.sa dhar ¯avr.s.¯a ˙nkah.[l. 14]), and, like Siva in his Tripur ´ antaka embodiment, ¯ routed the whole army of the enemy before ascending to the incomparable world [above] in a shower of flowers scattered by Indra’s celestial nymphs (¯atta[sva]l¯ılas tripur ¯antakasya . . . sakalam api sa jitv ¯a ´s ¯atravam.´sarvakalpah.| surapatiraman.¯ı n ¯am. pus. pavr.s.t.y ¯avak¯ırn. ah. puram anupam[am.] . . . [l. 15]). The poet refers here to the reward conventionally attributed to a warrior who dies bravely when fighting to protect his country; see, e.g., Mah ¯abh ¯arata 8, supplementary passage 14, ll. 31–34; 13, supplementary passage 15, ll.1358–1361.

Kings rewarded their Gurus with the donation or construction of monas teries (mat.hah.) and with grants of revenue from designated lands with which they themselves constructed and endowed such institutions. Thus in the first half of the ninth century the Rajaguru Purandara founded two monasteries ¯ in Gwalior, one at Mattamayura and a second at Aran ¯ .ipadra, using the funds he had received from king Avantivarman as the daks.in.¯a for performing the king’s Saiva initiation, for which purpose he had been persuaded to move to ´ 

Mattamayura, probably from M ¯ alava. The wealth received is described in ¯ the inscription that records these events as “[the revenue of] the most valu able portion of his kingdom”.619 Similarly, when the Kalacuri Yuvarajadeva ¯

Avantivarman then went to [Purandara], who was practising austerities in Upendrapura, and having striven to win his favour suc ceeded in bringing him back to sanctify his kingdom. Then, having served him with devotion he duly received Saiva initiation [from him].

district bore the name of Upendra, the first of the Paramara kings according to the ¯ genealogy given by the poet Padmagupta in 11.76 of his Navas ¯ahas ¯a ˙nkacarita. 620 In all secondary sources, including SANDERSON 2007a (p. 274), the name of this monastery (mat.hah.) appears as Golak¯ı-. That spelling is well attested, but only in manuscripts and inscriptions from the Dravidian South, where the scribes, speak ing languages in which voiced and unvoiced consonants are not distinguished, are liable to substitute k for g. We also find kolak¯ı there. I now correct to Golag¯ı- be cause this is what I find in the earliest testimony, which comes from regions whose vernacular languages do distinguish these consonants, namely Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts of the Kriy ¯ak ¯an. d. akram ¯aval¯ı and the Ban¯ . garh Prasasti of the time ´ of Nayapala (r. ¯ c. 1027–1043) (SIRCAR 1983b, v. 6: golagy ¯as sa mah ¯amat.hah.). The name appears as Golagg¯ı in the Chandrehe inscription (caran. ap ¯utagolaggikah.). I identify Golag¯ı with modern Gurgi (244◦ 310 N, 81◦ 270 E), about 12 miles due east of Rewa Town, in the north of the Kalacuri kingdom. This is the site of once vast Saiva ´ ruins (CUNNINGHAM 1885, pp. 149–154; MEYER et al. 1908-1931, vol. 21, pp. 282– 283; BANERJI 1931, pp. 41–45). A full account of my reasons for proposing this location and for rejecting as groundless the widespread view that the monastery was in the south of the kingdom at Bher.agh ¯ at¯ . on the Narmada river, close to the ¯ Kalacuri capital Tripur¯ı, must be set out elsewhere.

M ¯ IRASHI (CII 4i, p. clviii) interprets the words gr ¯am ¯an.¯am. bhiks.¯am.trilaks.¯ım.‘a 300,000 endowment of villages’ to mean that 300,000 villages were given to Prabhava ¯ siva and points out that if the ´ report is correct it indicates that “the king assigned to him one third of the total revenue of his home province of D. ahala, which, according to tradition, comprised ¯ nine lakhs of villages”. This would indeed be a vast endowment, so vast indeed that I find it hard to accept his interpretation. The Gurgi inscription mentions only about twenty villages and a town and the Malkapuram inscription need ¯ mean only that the endowment [consisting of the revenue capacity of these places] was valued at 300,000 of some unspecified monetary unit. This alternative was already considered by PANTULU, the first editor of the Malkapuram inscription. ¯ For though he proposed the interpretation later adopted by MIRASHI, he saw the difficulty it entails (1930, p. 52): “The founder of the monastery was one Sadbhava ¯ Sambhu who obtained a gift of three lacks [ ´ sic] of villages (or was it a villages [sic] fetching an income of Nishkas (coins)?) from the Kalachuri king Yuvarajadeva and ¯ gave away those villages to the Mat.ha as an endowment”. In favour of this more realistic reading is a parallel expression seen in an inscription of the sixth century from a site near Mrohaung in Arakan. There we learn of the gift to a Buddhist monastery of a tris ¯ahasriko gr ¯amah.(EI 37:13, l. 13: de ˙nguttan ¯am ¯a ttris ¯ahasriko gr ¯amo nisr.s.t.o), which can only mean ‘a village which has [a revenue yield of] 3000’. As the editor, D.C. SIRCAR points out (p. 63), this refers “apparently to the revenue income in the standard coin”.

Gurus as venerated by a plurality of kings is common, even a commonplace.631 The wealth accumulated by these Gurus enabled them behave like royal patrons themselves, not only founding new monasteries but also bestowing land grants on brahmins, rewarding poets, founding temples and new settlements, and providing the means of irrigation. The Badaun inscription reports that ¯ the Rajaguru M ¯ urtigan ¯ . a “honoured brahmins in abundance with many gifts of land that he had received due to the devotion of his royal disciple”;632 the Malkapuram inscription says concerning the R ¯ ajaguru Vi ¯ sve ´ svara ´ siva, a na- ´ tive of Gaud. a in eastern India: “Who can count the Gaud. a [brahmins] whose wishes he has granted, the ascetics who have received rich endowments [from him], the leading poets who have been delighted [with the rewards he has be stowed]?”;633 and the Ban¯ . garh Prasasti relates that Sarva ´ siva, the R ´ ajaguru of ¯ the Pala Nayap ¯ ala, gave [to brahmins] all the Great Gifts ( ¯ mah ¯ad ¯an ¯ani) of the Puran¯ .ic tradition, including the tul ¯apurus. ad ¯anam in which the donor gives away his weight in gold, an activity that increasingly became emblematic of exemplary kings during the second half of the first millenium.634 His brother Murti ¯ siva, to ´

The exalted status and king-like behaviour of these Gurus is reflected in the fact that we have inscriptions in which they have been given royal, even impe rial titles. This is so with Vamadeva, also called V ¯ ama ¯ sambhu, the R ´ ajaguru of ¯ a Kalacuri of Tripur¯ı who was probably Ga¯ngeyadeva (r. ˙ c. 1015–1041), on whom that king is said to have transferred his status as the monarch (nijar ¯ajalaks. m¯ı) as payment for his service as his Guru (gurudaks.in.¯a) when he set out on a cam

paign of world conquest. Beginning with the inscriptions of his son and succes sor Karn. a (r. c. 1041–1071) the Kalacuri rulers of this kingdom are described as meditating on the feet of this Vamadeva, to whose name are prefixed the impe- ¯ rial epithets paramabhat.t.¯arakamah ¯ar ¯aj ¯adhir ¯ajaparame´svaraparamam ¯ahe´sva ra´sr¯ı-. A variant of these titles, samadhigatapa ˜ncamah ¯a´sabdaparamabhat.t.¯a rakamah ¯ar ¯aj ¯adhir ¯ajaparame´svara-, is found in Nol.ambavad¯ .i records attached to the names of two other Saiddhantika Gurus, namely Brahma ¯ siva in an in- ´ scription of c. 870 and Varun. asiva in one of 936. Similarly, but more modestly, ´ an inscription of 1331 on a step-well in the vicinity of the Acalesvara temple ´ on Mt. Abu tells us that it was constructed during the victorious reign of the great ascetic r ¯aja´sr¯ı-Sarvesvara during the victorious reign of the ruler ´ r ¯aja´sr¯ı Tejah. sim. ha of Candravat ¯ ¯ı.649 

649 For these imperial and royal titles attached to the names of Saiva Gurus see D.C. ´ SIRCAR in EI 30:10, pp. 46–51. There he refutes the claims expressed by V.V. MI RASHI in EI 27:29. These are (1) that Vamadeva is a king V ¯ amar ¯ ajadeva [seen by ¯ him alone] in the Saugor inscription of Sa´ nkaragan ˙ . a, which has been assigned on palaeographic grounds to the eight century, (2) that this king should be assigned to the second half of the seventh century, and (3) that the references in inscrip tions of the later Kalacuris to these king’s devotion to [the memory] of Vamadeva, ¯ should be referred to this much earlier monarch as the founder of their dynasty. SIRCAR removes Vamadeva from the Saugor inscription, reading ¯ -v ¯avar ¯aja- rather than -v ¯amar ¯aja- and citing other examples of v ¯ava- or b ¯ava- in inscriptions, and then cites these examples of imperial or royal epithets bestowed on Saiva Gurus to ´ counter MIRASHI’s argument that their being prefixed to the name of Vamadeva ¯ proves that he was a king not a Guru. I side with SIRCAR. His view has the great strength that it accords (1) with the testimony of the Malkapuram inscription ¯ of 1261/2, which, referring to Vama ¯ sambhu as the third Guru in succession after ´ Sadbhava ¯ sambhu, the first pontiff of the Mat ´ .ha at Golag¯ı, reports that the Kalacuri kings were being praised (pra´sam.syante) [in their Prasastis] up to the present as ´ worshippers of his feet (PANTULU 1930, v. 28: atha nr. pa´sekharam ¯al ¯al ¯alitap ¯ado ’tra v ¯ama´sambhur abh ¯ut | ady ¯api kalacur¯ı´s ¯a yaccaran.¯ar ¯adhak ¯ah. pra´sam.syante)— in the inscriptions of the Kalacuris of Tripur¯ı from Karn. a onwards they are said to be -v ¯amadevap ¯ad ¯anudhy ¯ata-—, (2) with the fact that there is no reference to a king Vamadeva in any of the inscriptions of those kings, and (3) with the fact ¯ that the source which reports the Kalacuri king’s bestowing his r ¯ajalaks. m¯ı on Vamadeva refers to the latter as an ascetic ( ¯ s ¯ahasikas tapasvine v ¯amadevan ¯amne nijar ¯ajalaks. m¯ım. gurudaks.in.¯ayai dattv ¯a sarv ¯am. bh ¯umim.jetum. prasthitav ¯an). SIR CAR convincingly identifies the Kalacuri king here called Sahasika as G ¯ a¯ngeyadeva ˙ on the grounds that the latter was both an illustrious conqueror and known as Sahas ¯ a¯nka ‘he who has the cognomen S ˙ ahasa’. This source, cited by S ¯ IRCAR (EI 30:10, p. 50), is a paraphrase in Jonaraja’s commentary on the ¯ Pr.thiv¯ır ¯ajavijaya of Jayanaka of a verse of that work now lost in a lacuna. ¯ 

The inscription referring to Brahmasiva is ´ EC 10, Sr´¯ınivasapura taluk, ¯ no. 27 (p. 346). SIRCAR (EI 30:10, p. 49) wrongly gives the name as Bhramarasiva and the page reference as 376. The relevant part ´ of the inscription is: svasti samadhigatapa ˜ncamah ¯a´sabda pallav ¯anvaya ´sr¯ıpr.thiv¯ıvallava pallav ¯anvayakulatilakam ´sr¯ımat-nol.amb ¯adhir ¯ajar pr.thiv¯ır ¯ajya 

[[272]]

Clearly the Saiva R ´ ajaguru had become a far grander figure than the king’s ¯ brahmanical chaplain, the Rajapurohita, who was tied to the service of a single ¯ king and was unambiguously his subordinate. Yet, it appears that the Saivas did ´ not rest with this but also sought to encroach on the territory of that lesser office. For the Netratantra shows the existence of a further class of Saiva officiants who ´ were to function in almost all the areas traditionally reserved for that officiant: the performance of the king’s recurrent duties to worship the various deities on the days assigned to them, to celebrate the major annual royal festivals of the Indrotsava and Mahanavam ¯ ¯ı, to protect the royal family through rites to ward off ills, to restore them to health after illness, to ward off or counter the assaults of dangerous supernaturals, to empower through lustration (n¯ır ¯ajanam) the king’s elephants, horses and weapons of war, and to protect the king with apotropaic rites before he eats, sleeps, and engages in his regular practice of martial skills.650 

We see here one of several instances in which the Saivas used their author- ´ ity to colonize downwards, producing modifications of their ritual procedures for this purpose. These adapations inevitably entailed loss of status for those that implemented them, but we should understand that this did not affect those at the summit of the clerical hierarchy, the king-like Rajagurus, but only the hum- ¯ bler clones that extended their authority into domains that those Gurus would not deign to enter.

The inscription referring to Varun. asiva (Varun ´ . asivabhat ´ .ara) is ¯ SII 9, 1:24 (ARE 759 of 1916) from Gu nimorabagalu in the Anantapur District. It speaks of him as the pon tiff of the Non. ambesvarara temple, as the ruler of Pal ´ .ivalub ¯ al¯.u, and as the Mahas¯ amant ¯ adhipati, that is to say, as a feudatory of the highest rank, of king ¯ B¯ıran. olamba An. n. ayyadeva of the Nol.amba-Pallava dynasty (= An. n.iga, r. c. 932– 940). The Non. ambesvarara is probably the imposing temple at Hem ´ avat ¯ ¯ı now known as Dod. d. esvara (C ´ OHEN 1989, p. 50, and p. 63, note 36). He is also men tioned in an inscription on the Man. d. apa of the Dod. d. esvara temple, which gives ´ the information that he was the disciple of Rudrasiv ´ ac¯ arya. On Varun ¯ . asiva see ´ COHEN 1998, pp. 24, 35, and 41–42, who plausibly concludes that he was An. n.iga’s Rajaguru. The initiation-names Brahma ¯ siva, Varun ´ . asiva, and Rudra ´ siva reveal ´ that these Gurus were Saiddhantikas. The relevant portion of the inscription from ¯ Mt. Abu has been published by SIRCAR within this discussion (EI 30:10, p. 48).

[[273]]Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

S´ AIVISM AND THE ROYAL TEMPLE 

The second element of the early medieval process to which I have drawn attention is the proliferation of land-owning temples. All but the most ephemeral sovereigns during this period, both in the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, gave material form to the legitimacy and solidity of their power by building grand temples in which images of their chosen God were installed, animated, named after themselves (svan ¯amn ¯a), and endowed with land and officiants to support their cult. As we have seen, the great majority of these temples enshrined Siva ´ [in the form of a Linga]. ˙ 

The Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga provided specialized officiants and rituals ¯ to establish these Sivas, developing in course of time a secondary body of scrip- ´ tural authorities, the Pratis.t.hatantras, devoted exclusively to this domain, set- ¯ ting out the rituals of installation (pratis.t.h ¯a) and defining the norms for the form of the Linga, the iconography of ancillary images, and the architectural design ˙ of the various temple types.651 Moroever, they asserted the principle that the Saiva Sth ´ apaka, the specialist who performs these rituals, is competent not only ¯ in the Saiva domain but also on all the levels that the ´ Saivas ranked below it. ´ Thus they claimed that he is empowered to officiate in the construction and con secration of non-Saiva deities such as Vis ´.n. u following the Pancar ˜ atra. ¯652 This 

651 None of the early works of this class have been published. Those known to learned authors before the end of the eleventh century and surviving in manuscripts are the Mayasam. graha, not to be confused with the published Maya mata, a later south-Indian work, the Pi ˙ngal ¯amata, the Mohac ¯ud. ottara, and the Devy ¯amata, which declares itself the pratis.t.h ¯atantram of the Ni´sv ¯asa. Four other works of this type, not known to have survived, are cited by the Kashmirian Vidyakan ¯ .t.ha around the beginning of the eleventh century in his commentary on the Mayasam. graha: the Pratis.t.h ¯ap ¯arame´svara, the Nandike´svaramata, the Pait ¯amaha, and the Pratis.t.h ¯asamuccaya, the last of which was probably a Paddhati rather than a scripture. On all these texts see SANDERSON 2005a, pp. 440–442.

universalization of their authority, which is backed by learned theory of the re lation of the Saiva with the other bodies of scriptural injunction, seems not have ´ been merely theoretical. For the Saiva Paddhati literature contains instructions ´ for the consecration of Vis.n. us, as we have seen in the case of the Paddhati of Somasambhu, ´653 and Vais.n. ava sources protest at this encroachment, insisting that images of Vis.n. u installed by Saivas should be reconsecrated. ´ 654

[Such] Saiva[ ´ brahmin]s perform initiations and the like, the installation of images, and so forth [in these other systems], because the teaching of Siva is superior [to all others] and ´ because the mouth [of Purus.a] has been glorified [in the Purus. as ¯ukta as the part of his body from which the brahmins, as the highest caste-class, were created]. [The Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . a] is competent to act in all [systems], but not others in the teaching of Siva. Therefore the ´ Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . a [alone] may worship and install [images] both for others and himself. Others may act only for themselves. If out of greed [anyone other than a Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . a] performs rituals for the benefit of others[, thus usurp ing the exclusive right of the Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as], then without doubt both the king and his kingdom will swiftly be destroyed’. 

653 See Soma´sambhupaddhati vol. 4, pp. 294–311 (vis.n. usth ¯apanavidhih.). 654 In his Pa ˜ncar ¯atraraks.¯a (pp. 26–27) Vedantade ¯ sika, the influential ´ Sr´¯ıvais.n. ava of the fourteenth century (EI 13, p. 222), quotes a passage from the Saiva ´ K ¯aran. atantra that is more or less identical with 1.121c–124 of the passage of the K ¯amika, P ¯urvabh ¯aga cited above, and after asserting that it is inadmissi ble as evidence because all Saiva Tantras are condemned by Vedic authorities ´ quotes a passage from the south-Indian Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika ¯ P ¯admasam. hit ¯a (Cary ¯ap ¯ada 19.128b–130) to the effect that if a Vis.n. u has been installed with the system of the Saivas it must be re-installed following the system of the Pa ´ ncar ˜ atra and pu- ¯ rified by bathing with a thousand vases.

[[275]]

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

The involvement of the Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga in the temple cult ¯ covered in early Saiva scriptural sources and all the early Paddhatis up to at ´ least the twelfth century does not extend beyond the performing of the rituals necessary to initiate the cult by consecrating the images and the temples that house them. The texts are silent on the nature of the worship that would be performed before those images once the Saiva Guru had completed his task. It ´ would appear, therefore, that the temple worship was in the hands of officiants of a different kind. However, the texts lagged behind reality in this regard. For at some point, well before the Saiva literature was prepared to register this fact, ´ there were Saivas of the Mantram ´ arga working as the priests that performed ¯ the regular rituals in the Saiva temples. The new practice is first attested in ´ the Far South in the late seventh century. We learn from a grant of the Pallava Paramesvaravarman I (r. ´ c. 655–960) that a certain Anantasiv ´ ac¯ arya, whose ¯ name makes it very probable that he was an initiated Saiddhantika officiant, ¯655 was appointed as the priest with hereditary rights to perform the ritual of worship (devakarma) in the temple of Siva Vidy ´ avin ¯ ¯ıtapallavaparamesvara ´ established with his name by the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman I ´ alias Vidyavin ¯ ¯ıta.656 

The persistent disjunction during this period between what was prescribed for Saivas and what was being done by some of them is due, I propose, to the ´ fact that functioning as a priest in a temple, and therefore living off the endow ment of the deity in return for one’s work, carried a loss of status with which the older tradition was unwilling to be associated. According to brahmanical sources any brahmin who persists in such work for three years is considered to 

in keeping with the mildly disparaging south-Indian Vais.n. ava practice of referring to Siva as Rudra. Cf. the expression ´ rudrak ¯alyupaj¯ıvakah.cited here, p. 278 and the rule of the S ¯an ´. d.ilyasmr.ti quoted by Vedantade ¯ sika in his ´ Pa ˜ncar ¯atraraks.¯a (p. 62) that Vais.n. avas should keep far away from temples of Buddha, Rudra, and the like (buddharudr ¯adivasatim.´sma´s ¯anam.´savam eva ca | at.avim.r ¯ajadh ¯an¯ım.ca d ¯uratah. parivarjayet). 

655 Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva initiated brahmins have initiation-names ( ´ d¯ıks.¯an ¯ama) that end in -siva (with - ´ sambhu or, less commonly, - ´ ¯ısvara/- ´ ¯ısa or - ´ sa´ nkara as synonyms) ˙ as the second of their two components, and those of these who have been conse crated to officiate by receiving the ¯ac ¯ary ¯abhis.ekah. are referred to as N-siv ´ ac¯ arya, a ¯ practice that has continued into modern times. Other Anantasiv ´ ac¯ aryas are the ¯ author of the Siddh ¯antas ¯ar ¯aval¯ıvy ¯akhy ¯a, one of the Siv ´ ac¯ aryas, probably 95 in ¯ all, among 108 12th-century labelled images at Dar¯ a¯suram in Tamiln ´ ad¯ .u (SRINI VASAN 1987, vol. 1:17, no. 60), and one mentioned in an inscription of 1571 at the Vat.aran ¯ . yesvara temple at Tiruv ´ ala ¯ ng˙ ad¯ .u (ARE 497 of 1906 [Appendix B: stone in scriptions copied in 1905]) as a disciple of Ponnambala Dharmasiv ´ ac¯ arya and Guru ¯ of Immad.i Dharmasiv ´ ac¯ arya. ¯

have lost his brahmin status and is then known as a Devalaka.657 He is de scribed as an upabr ¯ahman. ah.‘a sub-brahmin’ or, even more disparagingly, as a br ¯ahman. acan. d.¯alah.‘a brahmin untouchable’;658 and this loss of status is con firmed in modern times in the way that the Smartha brahmins, the dominant ¯ community in Tamilad¯ .u have viewed the Adi ¯ saiva community that provides the ´ priests who after undergoing Saiddhantika ¯ Saiva initiation ( ´ d¯ıks.¯a) and consecra tion as Ac¯ aryas ( ¯ ¯ac ¯ary ¯abhis.ekah.) perform the worship in the Siva temples of the ´ region. They were forbidden to live in brahmin streets and the Smarthas would ¯ not intermarry or interdine with them.659 The Adi ¯ saivas, as one might expect, re- ´ sisted this condemnation, arguing in their scriptural productions and in learned exegesis that it applies only to brahmins other than members of their endoga mous community, more precisely that the three-year rule applies to Saiva initi- ´ ates other than themselves. Strengthening the brahmanical position they held that Siva has ruled that ordinary, uninitiated brahmins who work as temple- ´ priests will forfeit their status after only six months.660 As modern practice

reveals, this counterargument had no effect on the Smartha majority; and, in- ¯ deed, it is obvious that its real purpose was rather to defend their professional rights against encroachment by others, rights that they took care to write into their scriptures.661 For, no doubt in consequence of the efflorescence of the Saiva ´ temple cult under the Col.a emperors, we find a new wave of Saiva scriptures ´ appearing in the South, in which the ceremonial life of the temple and the duties and rights of its priests are regulated, and, indeed, form their principal subject matter.

If an initiated brahmin [who is not an Adi ¯ saiva] performs ´ the worship [of Siva] in a fixed Li ´ nga for a living for three years[, that is to say, as ˙ a priest serving in a temple,] then he [too] will become a Devalaka’. In the older, north-Indian literature the Pr ¯aya´scittapat.ala of the Dv ¯ada´sas ¯ahasra Svacchanda, quoted by Hr.dayasiva in his ´ Pr ¯aya´scittasamuccaya, f. 92v3–4, defines Devalakas when considering the matter of contamination by them, as those who as priests (bhojak ¯ah.) live off the Moon-god, Brahma, the Sun-god, Skanda, Vis ¯ .n. u, the God dess, or the Mothers: somabrahmaraviskandavis.n. udevya´s ca m ¯atarah.| upaj¯ıvanti ye devi p ¯ujayitv ¯a tu bhojak ¯ah.| te vai devalak ¯as tes.¯am pr ¯aya´scittam. vad ¯amy aham. The omission of Siva from this list implies that it is only the priests of other gods ´ that fall from caste. Likewise, defending the Pa¯ncar ˜ atrika priests of Vis ¯ .n. u’s tem ples against the same consequence, Yamuna argued, citing Vy ¯ asa, that it is only ¯ those who earn their live off Rudra (i.e. Siva) and K ´ al¯ ¯ı by serving as their priests that become Devalakas (bhaved devalako yo vai rudrak ¯alyupaj¯ıvakah.): Vais.n. ava temple-priests do not become Devalakas, because they have been consecrated for their work by initiation. See Yamuna, ¯ Agamapr ¯am ¯an ¯. ya, pp. 15–17 (the accusation), and pp. 156–157 (the rebuttal).

of the sixteenth century.662 But some others are already being cited in the thir teenth, and one in the twelfth.663 

Here too, of course, the royal connection is maintained and carefully nur tured. Thus the ceremonial repertoire of these temples included special rituals for the king’s protection (r ¯ajaraks.¯a);664 and temple festivals (utsavah.) were often timed to coincide with the day of his natal asterism or of that of a member of his family.665 Indeed the texts place a great emphasis on the connection between the temple and the welfare of the ruler and his kingdom, warning repeatedly that while the proper maintenance of the temple and its ceremonies will bene fit both, deviations or neglect will have dire consequences for them. This duty to maintain the status quo naturally included that of recognizing the exclusive hereditary rights of the members of this priestly community.666 

The Adi ¯ saivas are the only endogamous community of Saiddh ´ antika ¯ Saiva ´ temple-priests for which we have evidence and they seem not to have operated beyond south India. But it seems likely that there were parallel developments in other parts of the subcontinent, evidence of which has been lost or not yet come 

662 These scriptures that first appear in the works of Vedajn˜ anaguru are the ¯ Am.´sumat, the Ajita, the K ¯a´sm¯ıratantra, the Cintyavi´sva/Cintyavi´svas ¯ad ¯akhya, the D¯ıpta, the Dev¯ık ¯alottara, the Bh¯ıma, the Makut.a, the Mukhabimba, the Yogaja, the Raurava, the Vijaya (/Vijayottara), the Vidves. an. a, the V¯ıra, the Sam.t ¯ana, the Sahasra, the Siddha, the S ¯uks. ma, and the Skandak ¯alottara. The works of Vedajn˜anaguru in ¯ which they are cited are the Atm ¯arthap ¯uj ¯apaddhati ¯, D¯ıks.¯adar´sa, and Saiv ¯agama- ´ paribh ¯as.¯ama ˜njar¯ı. For his date see DAGENS 1979, pp. 6–7. 

663 The extant K ¯amika is perhaps the first work of this kind to be cited in a date able work. Substantial passages found in it are quoted without attribution in the J ˜n ¯anaratn ¯aval¯ı of Jn˜ana ¯ siva, a teacher of Trilocana ´ siva and therefore a near ´ contemporary of Aghorasiva, who completed his ´ Kriy ¯akramadyotik ¯a in 1157. The next earliest known work in which there are citations from such scriptures is the Sivap ¯uj ¯astavavy ¯akhy ¯a ´ composed by a nameless author in the thirteenth century, probably in its second half. This date follows from the fact that he identifies himself as the great-great-grandson of the same Trilocanasiva. He cites the ´ K ¯aran. a, the Acintya, the Suprabheda, the south-Indian Paus. kara, and the V ¯atula´suddh ¯akhya. I derive this information concerning the citations in the Sivap ¯uj ¯astavavy ¯akhy ¯a ´ and Jn˜ ana ¯ siva’s unattributed citations of the ´ K ¯amika from a lecture given by Dr. Do minic Goodall in the Early Tantra Workshop held in Kathmandu in September 2008. For the relationships between Aghorasiva, J ´ n˜ana ¯ siva, and Trilocana ´ siva see ´ GOODALL 2000 and for confirmation of the date of Aghorasiva’s ´ Kriy ¯akramadyotik ¯a see GOODALL 1998, pp. xiii–xvii, fn. 24. No Sanskrit Saiddhantika works have yet ¯ been identified which can be dated within the period of three centuries between the author of the Sivap ¯uj ¯astavavy ¯akhy ¯a ´ and Vedajn˜anaguru II. ¯ 

664 Chapters devoted to this protective temple ritual for the king are found in such south-Indian Saiva texts as the ´ S ¯uks. m ¯agama (pp. 290–297: r ¯ajaraks.¯avidhih.), and the D¯ıpt ¯agama (pp. 211–215: r ¯ajaraks.¯avidhipat.alah.).

S´ AIVISM AND NEW SETTLEMENTS 

The early Saiva Pratis ´.t.hatantras show that the authority of the ¯ Saiva ´ Sthapaka was to extend to the creation of the palaces of their kings. Among the ¯ early Pratis.t.hatantras the ¯ Mayasam. graha, Mohac ¯ud. ottara, and Pi ˙ngal ¯amata, 

667 Against the view that the Adi ¯ saiva caste is peculiar to Tamil Nadu one might ´ cite the fact that the Adi ¯ saivas are mentioned the ´ Soma´sambhupaddhati, a work composed in the eleventh century far to the north (at the end of the Pavitr ¯a rohan. avidhi): pa ˜ncayojanasam.sthe ’pi pavitram. gurusam. nidhau | kurv¯ıta vidhi n ¯anena labhate v ¯a ˜nchitam. phalam | sarvam. vai tv adi ¯ saiv ´ an¯ am¯. d¯ıks.it ¯an ¯am. ´sivoditam | paropak ¯ara´s¯ılena ´sr¯ımat ¯a soma´sambhun ¯a | kriy ¯ak ¯an. d. akram ¯avaly ¯am. pavitrakavidhih. kr.tah.. However, the line is not in the edition based on Kash mirian manuscripts (see Karmak ¯an. d. akram ¯aval¯ı vv. 494c–496b: pa ˜ncayojana sam.sthe ’pi pavitram. gurusam. nidhau k kurv¯ıta vidhin ¯anena labhate v ¯a ˜nchitam. phalam | adh¯ıta´siva´s ¯astren. a kr.to ’yam.soma´sambhun ¯a k karmak ¯an. d. akram ¯avaly ¯am. pavitrakavidhih.sphut.ah.) nor in the Nepalese transmission (see Kriy ¯ak ¯an. d. akram ¯a val¯ı f. 22v4–5: pa ˜ncayojanasam.stho ’pi pavitram. gurusam. nidhau | kurv¯ıta vidhin ¯a nena labhate v ¯a ˜nchitam. phalam | paropak ¯ara´s¯ılena ´sr¯ımat ¯a soma´sambhun ¯a | kriy ¯a k ¯an. d. akram ¯avaly ¯am. pavitrakavidhih. kr.tah.). It is found only in BRUNNER’s edition and the Devakot.t.ai edition, which her edition reproduces here. It rests, therefore, exclusively on the evidence of Grantha manuscripts from the south. Evidently, then, one must suspect that the line has been interpolated in Tamil Nadu by a redactor in the Adi ¯ saiva community. Its lack of intelligible connection with what precedes and ´ follows strengthens this suspicion. 

I have not seen the term Adi ¯ saiva in any inscription. There the officiants of ´ the Siva temples are always termed ´´sivabr ¯ahman. ah. or ´sivadvijah.. That term first occurs to my knowledge c. A.D. 863 in an inscription of Pallava Nandivar man III, from Tiruvallam in North Arcot (MAHALINGAM 1988:132). Concerning a grant to the temple of Paramesvara at T ´ ¯ıkkalivallam it specifies that 500 k ¯ ad¯ .i of paddy are for the Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as who offer worship and services in the sanc tum (¯ar[ ¯a]di[t]t-up ¯a´sarikkum [´siva]br ¯ahman. arkku) (ll. 25–26). Thereafter the term is commonplace. But it is clear that it is the group known as the Adi ¯ saivas that ´ is intended, because in these inscriptions when Sivabr ´ ahman ¯ . as are named their Gotras are sometimes given and these are those of the Adi ¯ saivas as attested both ´ by their prescriptive texts and among their modern descendants, namely Kausika, ´ Ka¯syapa, Bh ´ aradv ¯ aja, Gautama, ¯ Atreya, ¯ Agastya, and P ¯ ar¯ a¯sara. See, e.g., ´ SII 3:41 (Ka¯syapa), 55 (Kau ´ sika), 58 (Kau ´ sika), 209 (Kau ´ sika, K ´ a¯syapa, Kau ´ sika); ´ SII 12:197 (Agastya); ¯ SII 17:152 (Bharadv ¯ aja), 157 (Bh ¯ aradv ¯ aja), 160 and 161 ¯ (Gautama), 162 and 163 (Bharadv ¯ aja), 165 (Gautama, Par ¯ a¯sara), 203 ( ´ Atreya, ¯ Bharadv ¯ aja), and 730 (K ¯ a¯syapa); ´ EC 3, Sr:44 (Gautama); EC 10, Kl:106a (Kausika), ´ 106d (Gautama), 107 (Kausika), 187 (Kau ´ sika, K ´ a¯syapa); ´ EC 10, Bp:29, 32, 35a, and 37a (all Gautama, Bharadv ¯ aja). Six of the seven, minus ¯ Agastya, are listed in ¯ the Sam.t ¯ana as cited in the Atm ¯arthap ¯uj ¯apaddhati ¯ A, p. 125. Five of them, lacking Atreya and Par ¯ a¯sara, are listed in ´ Sv ¯ayambhuva, p. 14 (Ac ¯aryalaks ¯. an. apat.ala 94c– 95b). This evidence accords with contemporary testimony. According to the data collected by FULLER (1984, p. 28) the Adi ¯ saiva priests of the M ´ ¯ınaks ¯ .¯ısundaresvara ´ temple in Madurai belong to the Ka¯syapa, Kau ´ sika, Bh ´ aradv ¯ aja, Gautama, and ¯ Atreya Gotras. ¯

all prescribe the layout of the royal palace in detail, the latter two distinguishing between different classes, the highest being that of a paramount sovereign or Mahar¯ aj¯ adhir ¯ aja; ¯668 and in the first two works the design prescribed in cludes a section of the palace reserved for teachers of the Saiva Mantram ´ arga ¯ (mantrin. ah., mantram ¯argopade´sinah.).669 But the layout of the palace taught in these Pratis.t.hatantras is only part of the layout for an urban settlement ¯ to be established by the king around the palace, complete with markets and segregated areas for the dwellings of the various castes and artisans, with instructions for the size and plan of these dwellings determined by caste sta tus.670 The founding of such royal towns is not explicitly enjoined in the Saivas’ ´ ritual manuals. That is to say that no ritual of nagarapratis.t.h ¯a was envisaged. The Sthapaka was engaged, it seems, only for the choice and consecration of the ¯ site (v ¯astup ¯uj ¯a) and his instructions followed for the layout of the buildings to be constructed upon it. Nonetheless, we see the Saivas involving themselves in one ´ aspect of the third of the elements of medieval process that I have listed, namely the creation of new urban settlements from above. The epigraphical record and Kalhan. a’s history of Kashmir demonstrate that any king of substance felt it encumbent on him to demonstrate his sovereignty not only by the building of temples but also by the creation of new urban settlements (puram), which, like the deities he established, were generally named after him.671 

One of the early Pratis.t.hatantras, the ¯ Devy ¯amata, devotes its 66th chapter 

668 The layout of the royal palace is prescribed in Mayasam. graha ff. 33v–34r (5.188–199), Mohac ¯ud. ottara ff. 20v–22r (4.245c–281), and Pi ˙ngal ¯amata ff. 74r–75v (10.126–180).

671 This practice was followed both throughout the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia, as the following examples demonstrate: in Kashmir Pravarasena II’s Pravara pura (Sr´¯ınagar), Durlabhaka-Pratap¯ aditya II’s Prat ¯ apapura, Jay ¯ ap¯ ¯ıd. a’s Jayapura, Lalitaditya’s Lalitapura, Avantivarman’s Avantipura, ¯ Sa´ nkaravarman’s ˙ Sa´ nkara- ˙ pura, and Didda’s Didd ¯ apura, in eastern India R ¯ am¯ avat ¯ ¯ı (Ramauti) (of R ¯ amap ¯ ala), ¯ Vijayapura of Vijayasena, and Laks.man. avat ¯ ¯ı (Lakhnauti) (of Laks.man. asena), in the south Gangaikon ˙ . d. acolapura, Parakesaripura, Parantakapura, R ¯ ajakesari- ¯ pura, Rajar ¯ ajapura, R ¯ aj¯ adityapura, R ¯ aj¯ a¯srayapura, R ´ ajendracolapura, Vikrama- ¯ colapura, Vikramapan¯ . d. yapura, Vikramasim. hapura, V¯ırarajendracolapura, V ¯ ¯ıra rajendrapura, and, among the Khmers ¯¯Is´anapura, Bhavapura, Ya ¯ sodharapura, ´ Rajendrapura, and Jayendranagar ¯ ¯ı.

to the layout to be followed not only in new towns but also in new villages, with an emphasis on the positioning of the various deities within the plan and the directions in which they should face. The regulations imposed show us Saiva of- ´ ficiants on a purely civic level. There is nothing specifically Saiva in the layout. ´ The Devy ¯amata’s chapter on iconography shows further evidence of the involve ment of the Saivas in both urban and rural planning. Differentiating various ´ forms of Siva in accordance with mood and number of arms it tells the Sth ´ apaka ¯ which are appropriate where.672 The same concern can be seen in the Pratis.t.ha¯ sections of the South-Indian Yamalatantra texts with regard to the positioning ¯ and iconography of the images of Bhadrakal¯ ¯ı whose installation and cult are their concern.673 

S´ AIVISM AND IRRIGATION 

The creation of new settlements and the concomitant extension of agricul ture required the provision of the means of irrigation. Rituals for the conse cration (pratis.t.h ¯a) of wells (k ¯upah.), step-wells (v ¯ap¯ı), and reservoirs (pus. karin.¯ı, tad.¯agah.) were already provided by the brahmanical tradition. A Vaidika proce dure of the Gr.hya type is outlined or touched upon in a number of sources;674 a more elaborate, Pauran¯ .ika form of the ritual, taking five days and requiring twenty-four priests in addition to the Sthapaka, is set out at length in the ¯ Mat syapur ¯an. a (58.4–56);675 and the currency of this form is evident from the fact that it became the basis of further elaboration.676 There is no trace of irriga

On these south-Indian Yamala texts, the cult they teach, and their ¯ 

non-brahmin priests see SANDERSON 2007b, pp. 277–278 with footnotes 140–143. 674 See EINOO 2002 for the details of these sources. 

675 A procedure of the Pauran¯ .ika type is also taught in A´sval ¯ayan¯ıyagr ¯.hyapari´sis.t.a 4.9 and Hiran. yake´sigr.hya´ses. as ¯utra 1.7.1. (EINOO 2002, pp. 713–714). 

676 We find procedures based on the prescriptions of the Matsyapur ¯an. a in the rit- [[282]]

tion rituals in the early Saiva scriptures, including the Pratis ´.t.hatantras. But in ¯ due course Saiva officiants, seeking to add this important domain to their ritual ´ 

repertoire, produced their own version. It first surfaces in our surviving evidence towards the end of the eleventh century, in the Paddhati of Somasambhu, ´677 and from that source entered both later Paddhatis such as the Siddh ¯anta´sekhara and the Atm ¯arthap ¯uj ¯apaddhati ¯ and the second wave of Saiva scriptural literature ´ produced in southern India.678 In spite of the Saivized character of these new ´ rituals the underlying model is still recognizably that of the brahmanical tradi tion. The Saiva elements are little more than a veneer on what it essentially a ´ brahmanical procedure, marked by such distinctive features as the erecting of a Naga pole ( ¯ n ¯agayas.t.ih.) at the centre of the excavation, the casting of metal images of aquatic creatures into the water, the crossing of the excavation by a cow followed by the patron of the rite, the making of offerings to Varun. a, and the giving of the cow to the officiant.679 Nor is there any attempt to attribute to 

ual literature of the priests of the Kashmirian brahmins; see *V ¯apy ¯adiprati s.t.h ¯a, ff. 893r14–905v16 (Varun. apratis.t.h ¯a); ff. 906r1–907v9 (the Varun. apratis.t.h ¯a of J¯ıvana); 910r1–v1 (Adityapur ¯an ¯.e N ¯alakapratis.t.h ¯a); 929v7–931r8 (Tad.¯akapratis.t.h ¯a and N ¯alakapratis.t.h ¯a); and 931r9–931v23 (Chandogapratis.t.h ¯atah. K ¯upapratis.t.h ¯a). These treatments do not appear to be distinctively Kashmirian. On the subject of the giving of wells and reservoirs and the Smarta/Paur ¯ an¯ .ika procedures for conse crating them see also Caturvargacint ¯aman.i, vol. 1 (D ¯anakhan. d. a), pp. 1001–1029. 

677 See Soma´sambhupaddhati, BRUNNER 1998, pp. 392–403 and pp. 406–411. The first passage sets out the ritual for the consecration of a pus. karin.¯ı, but adds at its end that it applies also for the consecration of a v ¯ap¯ı or tat.¯akah.. The second passage gives the ritual for the consecration of a k ¯upah.. A k ¯upah.is a simple well, whereas a v ¯ap¯ı is a step-well, a well with a flight of steps leading down to it on one of more sides (k ¯upo ’dv ¯arako gartavi´ses. ah. baddhasop ¯anako ’yam. v ¯ap¯ıti dvaitanirn. ayah.: Raghunandana cited in KANE 2ii, p. 893). Such step-wells survive from the early medieval period, notably in Gujarat. The most splendid is no doubt the Ran¯ .¯ı k¯ı Vav at Patan (An ¯ . ahillapattana), the old Caulukya capital. Both a pus. karin.¯ı and a tat.¯akah.(/tad.¯agah.) are water reservoirs. The difference appears to be one of scale alone, the latter being larger than the former. KANE (loc. cit.) reports the view expressed by Raghunandana in his Jal ¯a´sayotsargatattva that a pus. karin.¯ı is from 100 to 200 cubits in length, and a tad.¯agah.is from 200 to 800, and the view of the Vasis.t.hasam. hit ¯a as quoted by Raghunandana that a pus. karin.¯ı is up to 400 cubits in length and a tad.¯agah. up to 2000.

That Saiva officiants were engaged to perform the consecration of irrigation ´ works undertaken by their royal patrons seems very likely. No inscription known to me records any such ritual, but then no inscription to my knowledge conveys information about any religious ceremonies that accompanied the inauguration of reservoirs and other such works. It is even more probable that the Saiva ver- ´ sion of the ritual would have been performed when Saiva Gurus undertook such ´ constructions in their own right. We have seen above that inscriptions record the creation of reservoirs by Vimalasiva, M ´ urti ¯ siva, Prabodha ´ siva, Pata ´ nga ˙ siva, and ´ Tribhuvanakartaradeva. 

S´ AIVISM AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION 

The fifth and last respect in which Saivism can be seen to have played an ´ active role is that of the assimilation of the communities that were caught up in the extension of the reach of the state that characterizes this period. For the Saiddhantikas opened initiation to candidates from all four caste-classes, ¯680 in cluding the S´udras or at least the Sacch ¯ udras or ‘Pure ¯ S´udras’, those, that is, who ¯ had already succumbed to the values of brahmanical society to the extent that they had abjured alcohol,681 a move that both promoted the penetration of these

values and enabled the integration of the landowning agriculturalists, classed as Sacchudras, that were dominant in the countryside both within and beyond ¯ the core territories of these expanding states. It thus provided a means of artic ulating a social unity that transcended the rigid exclusions of the brahmanical social order. Nor did it allow non-brahmins only to be initiated. More crucially it sanctioned their appointment as Ac¯ aryas, restricting this licence only by re- ¯ quiring that persons could officiate for persons of none but their own or inferior caste-classes. Thus a brahmin could teach, initiate, and perform ceremonies of installation only for brahmins, Ks.atriyas, Vaisyas and ´ S´udras, a Ks ¯ .atriya only for Ks.atriyas, Vaisyas and ´ S´udras, a Vai ¯ sya only for Vai ´ syas and ´ S´udras, and a ¯ S´udra only for others of his caste-class. ¯682 The key groups here appear to have 

been the first and the last. For there is little evidence of the presence of Vaisya ´ traders in Saivism, and though, as we have seen, Ks ´.atriya rulers were commonly Saiva initiates, their social status and function were obviously incompatible with ´ 

pontifical office. The core social structure here is one of brahmin Gurus initiat 

ing other brahmins, Ks.atriyas rulers, and perhaps on occasion members of lower castes, and of S´udra Gurus initiating both other ¯ S´udras and the powerful in their ¯ communities, who though ks.atriya-like in their local authority683 were nonethe less formally of the same caste-class as their initiators.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

of the full set of possibilities, in which members of any caste-class are said to be able to initiate only their equals and inferiors, serves, I suggest, not as a record that all these possibilities were enacted but rather as an abstraction that adds authority to the more restricted common practice by presenting it as following a universally valid principle upheld in the brahmanical social system, seen, for example in the rule that a man may marry a woman born of parents of his own caste or one below it but never a woman from a community ranked above him.684 Indeed Saiddhantika texts that discuss who may receive initiation and consecra- ¯ tion and who may not include the offspring of such forbidden marriages in the latter category.685 

Evidence of the existence of such self-contained S´udra Saiddh ¯ antika lin- ¯ eages is abundant in the Tamil country at the end of our period and after it down 

to modern times. There members of the Sacchudra Vel ¯ .l.al¯.a community such as Meykan.t.ar, and ¯ N˜ an¯ acampantar played a significant part in the development of the canon of the Tamil Saiva Siddh ´ anta, and a good number of powerful Mat ¯ .has emerged, such as those at Tarumapuram (Dharmapuram) and Tiruvad¯ .uturai, in which the presiding ascetics were and have continued to be members of this upwardly mobile Sacchudra caste. ¯686 

684 See, e.g., Y ¯aj ˜navalkyasmr.ti, Ac ¯ar ¯adhy ¯aya ¯ 57, 91–95.

And in the K ¯amika: “The four beginning with the brahmin and the [six] Anulomas”’. The term Anuloma here is a synonym of anulomajah.‘born of a union that is in the natural direction’, that is to say, hypergamous. The six Anulomas are (1) from a brahmin man and Ks.atriya woman (Murdh ¯ avasikta), (2) from a brahmin ¯ man and Vaisya woman (Ambas ´ .t.ha), (3) from a brahmin man and S´udra woman ¯ (Para ¯ sava); (4) from a Ks ´ .atriya man and a Vaisya woman (M ´ ahis ¯ .ya/Madgu), (5) from a Ks.atriya man and a S´udra woman (Ugra), and (6) from a Vai ¯ sya man and a ´ S´udra woman (Karan ¯ . a).

686 ARE 1909, p. 105; STEIN 1994, pp. 235–241; GHOSE 1996, pp. 222, 253–282. STEIN hypothesizes (1994, pp. 237–239) that this rise of the Vel.l.al¯.as was the cause of the fact that from the thirteenth century onwards independent shrines of the Goddess (k ¯amakos.t.ham) began to be built in the Tamil area alongside those of Siva and to ´ be enclosed with the latter in a single architectural complex. He takes this to be evidence of “the assimilation of folk conceptions of deity”. See also GHOSE 1996, pp. 221–222. There is certainly widespread evidence of S´ aktization in the later ¯ south-Indian Saiva literature. In the south-Indian Saiddh ´ antika scriptures ¯ Rau rava, Cintya, Makut.a, and S ¯uks. ma all the male deities in the circuits surrounding 

[[286]]

It might be suspected that this is an isolated development pecular to the Far South; and I must say that I am not yet aware of historical evidence of parallel developments elsewhere in India at this time or before it. However, it is ex tremely improbable that we would have found unambiguous statements in early texts that are very unlikely to have emanated from that region to the effect that S´udras may receive consecration as ¯ Ac¯ aryas, initiate others of their caste and ¯ pass on their office within it, if this was not indeed a widespread practice. This is all the more certain in the light of the fact that the same early corpus provides specific instructions on how such initiates should be named, how they should dress their hair, mark themselves with ash, and the like.687 

Siva in temple worship, from the first of the Brahmas to the last of the Weapons ´ have been provided with a personal Sakti; see ´ Raurava, Kriy ¯ap ¯ada, Pat.ala 59, and N.R. BHATT’s introduction to his edition of the S ¯ardhatri´satik ¯alottara, pp. xviii-xix (Cintya and Makut.a) and pp. lxviii-lxix (Cintya, Makut.a, and S ¯uks. ma). There is striking evidence of a related development in the Tamil Saiva literature in the ´ Tirumantiram of Tirumular. That text has been assigned to the fifth, sixth, and ¯ seventh centuries. But it weaves together the Tamil Saiva Siddh ´ anta, the Ved ¯ anta, ¯ a S´ akta tradition that features ¯ kun. d. alin¯ıyogah. and the cult of Tripura, and the cult ¯ of Nat.araja. This is a combination which is unlikely to predate the twelfth century ¯ (see also GOODALL 2004, pp. xxix–xxx).

As for those below the Pure S´udras, that is to say, members of ¯ S´udra castes ¯ not considered pure and, below even them, members of the various more or less untouchable communities defined as the lowest-born (antyaj ¯ah.), these too were drawn by the Saiddhantikas within the reach of the religion. Texts of this tradi- ¯ tion declare that a Guru is forbidden to give them initiation in the full sacrificial 

form (hautr¯ı d¯ıks.¯a). But if he sees that they are inspired by sincere devotion to Siva he is required to perform for them a simplified form of initiation that avoids ´ 

direct contact. This is to be accomplished mentally (m ¯anas¯ı d¯ıks.¯a) or in the form of a gaze believed to transmit Siva’s liberating power ( ´ c ¯aks.us.¯ı d¯ıks.¯a), or by allow ing them to drink the water with which his feet have been washed, an extension of the common devotional practice of drinking the water that gathers at the foot of an image in the course of its worship.688

Orthodox brahmanical practice denied all S´udras access through Up- ¯ anayana to the Veda and the rituals that are animated by its Mantras and excluded even more radically the various groups it ranked below these as ‘the lowest born’ (antyajah., antyaj ¯atih.). The texts of the Saivas justified their liber- ´ ating inroads into the mass of humanity beyond these brahmanical boundaries by boldly declaring that the system of the separation of the castes (j ¯atibhedah.) is a fabrication without basis in reality, a cultural epiphenomenon rather than a deep fact of nature,689 pointing to its absence among human beings outside of India.690 Only mentality matters; and consequently all devotees of Siva ´ form a single community regardless of birth,691 one whose only true internal 

he should eliminate their bonds by such means as giving them the water from his feet. As for those who are born of inter-caste marriages in which the father’s caste is higher or *if they are connected with brahmins (?) he may do [for them the full ritual procedure] that begins with the elimination of the paths as appropriate to the [caste of the] family [in which they have been born]’. The term sam. karaj ¯atih., which I have translated literally as ‘of the mixed castes’ refers to offspring of such unions as that between a Mahis ¯ .ya (born of a Ks.atriya man and Vaisya woman) and ´ Karan. a woman (born of a Vaisya man and ´ S´udra woman; see, e.g., ¯ Mit ¯aks. ar ¯a on Y ¯aj ˜navalkyasmr.ti, Ac ¯ar ¯adhy ¯aya ¯ 95.

hierarchy is that created by the four levels of empowerment through initiation and consecration.692 

However, it should not be imagined that because they insisted that the divi sions of the castes are ultimately groundless when explaining the inclusiveness of their recruitment they rejected these divisions in practice. It is one thing to extend one’s recuitment into lower social strata and quite another to reject the di visions between them in practice. Thus in spite of their rhetoric of the underlying unity of man they required that caste divisions be respected not only in relations between initiates and the wider society in matters such as marriage but also in relations between fellow-initiates. As we have seen, they denied impure S´udras ¯ and untouchables the full ceremonial form of initiation, they refused to transmit the office of Ac¯ arya to the offspring of unions between a man of a lower caste ¯ and a women of a higher, and they would not countenance an Ac¯ arya’s initiating ¯ his caste superior, in effect a S´udra’s initiating a brahmin. They also required, ¯ for example, that when initiates of different caste-classes gathered they should sit apart, each in a separate line;693 the penances (pr ¯aya´scittam) that they pre-

from the mixed castes are eating together in a single line’. 

694 See Trilocanasiva, ´ Pr ¯aya´scittasamuccaya p. 25. Similar differentiation accord ing to caste applies to the penances for eating the leavings of another’s food (ucchis.t.abhojanam), illicit sexual intercourse, and the taking of human life; see ibid., pp. 32, 35, 48, and 52–53. How the hierarchy of caste was perceived in rela tion to that between the initiated and the uninitiated can be seen in the rules for the penances needed to restore purity if one’s food has been contaminated through contact with an ucchis.t.ah., a person who has eaten but has not yet purified himself. The rules for initiated brahmins will suffice to illustrate this. If a brahmin initiate’s food is contaminated by another brahmin initiate the penance is 100 repetitions of the Tatpurus.a, the Mantra that is the Lord of his Caste (j ¯at¯ı´sah.). It is doubled if the contaminator is an uninitiated brahmin or an initiated Ks.atriya. One day of fasting is added to the repetitions if the contaminator is an uninitiated Ks.atriya, two if the contaminator is an initiated Vaisya, three if an initiated ´ S´udra, four if an ¯ uninitiated Vaisya, and six if an uninitiated ´ S´udra (ibid., p. 31). Here we see traces ¯ of a view that the status bestowed by Saiva initiation should prevail over that of ´ caste. In its pure form this would entail that a Saiva brahmin should consider con- ´ tamination by an initiated S´udra one degree less severe than that by an uninitiated ¯ brahmin, two degrees less severe than that by an uninitiated Ks.atriya, and so on. But the Saiddhantikas have preferred to limit the application of this view to the ¯ lowest two castes, where it was of least consequence, allowing an initiated S´udra to ¯ be less contaminating than an uninitiated Vaisya, but not a initiated Vai ´ sya to out- ´ rank an uninitiated Ks.atriya or an initiated Ks.atriya an ordinary brahmin. In other words the primary distinctions here are (1) that between brahmins and Ks.atriyas on the one hand and Vaisyas and ´ S´udras on the other, and (2) that between brah- ¯ mins and Ks.atriyas. So while a S´udra will be purer than a Vai ¯ sya if he has been ´ initiated, a Ks.atriya, in effect the king or a member of his family, will never be less pure than a Vaisya, nor a brahmin less pure than a non-brahmin. In this regard ´ the benefit of initiation in the case of the Ks.atriya is limited to an acceptance that he is no more contaminating than an uninitiated brahmin. But this is already a major concession in terms of caste and articulates the view seen elsewhere in the literature that the prosperity of society requires an alliance between the brahmins led by the Saivas and a monarch who has received initiation from the ´ Saiva Guru. ´ This view is underlined by the fact that penance is without fasting in the case of contamination by brahmins or an initiated Ks.atriya but with fasting in all other cases. 

695 I am aware of five different rulings in this matter. (1) names in -siva, etc. for brah- ´ mins only, in -gan. a for Ks.atriyas, Vaisyas, and ´ S´udras, and in - ¯ sakti for women; ´ see Kiran. a 37.11–12b: ks. atriy ¯aditrayasyoktam <m>antran ¯ama gan.¯a ˙nkitam k 12 vipr ¯an.¯am. *mantrap ¯urvam.(conj. : m ¯atup ¯urvvan Cod) tu sagotr ¯antam bhaved iha ‘In the case of the three [castes] beginning with the Ks.atriya it should be the name of one of the Mantras distinguished by [the addition of] -gan. a.

However, the non-Saiddhantika traditions of the worship of Bhairava and ¯ the Goddess in the Mantrap¯ıt.ha and Vidyap¯ ¯ıt.ha have shown themselves much less willing to tolerate such compromises, seeing them as a contamination of the true Saiva tradition and appropriate only for those, namely the Saiddh ´ antikas, ¯ whose degree of illumination by Siva is insuffficient to enable them to appreciate ´ and enact his higher teachings.696 Distinction on the basis of caste is generally

allowed to intrude only at the point of entry, to determine the length of the pe riod during which a Guru should examine a candidate to determine his or her fitness for initiation, or in the Mah ¯alaks. m¯ımata that ends the fourth S. at.ka of the Jayadrathay ¯amala to enable a Guru to select the impure substance that the candidate will be given to swallow without inhibition before receiving consecra tion (abhis.ekah.):697 

Although there is no division of castes in this great Tantra, it is found nonetheless, O beautiful-eyed, in the commencement of initiation. [For only] when people have gone through initiation do they have no caste at all. [Or rather only then] do they become members of the one ‘caste’ of Siva. For this reason, in the Vises ´.ad¯ıks.a¯ [the Ac¯ arya] must do what I shall now explain. Slender-waisted one, he should ¯ 

initiate brahmins by making them drink wine, Ks.atriyas by [making them drink] urine, Vaisyas by making them drink semen, ´ S´udras by [making them swallow] ¯ 

faeces, and women by making them embrace the body of an initiate. 

We find accordingly a stronger rejection of caste in ceremonial contexts, a conviction that pride of caste is one of the factors that hold souls in bondage, and prohibitions against ever mentioning the birth-caste of a fellow initiate. Thus in the Svacchandatantra of the Mantrap¯ıt.ha we read:698 

O fair-faced one, all those who have been initiated by this ritual are of equal nature, whether they be brahmins, Ks.atriyas, Vaisyas, ´ S´udras, or others [of lower ¯ castes]. [For] they have been brought into a state of fusion with the nature of Siva. All are said to be [ ´ Sivas,] wearers of [his] braids, their bodies dusted [like ´ his] with ash. All Samayins should sit in a single row. Putrakas, Sadhakas, ¯ 

it teaches the nature of the ultimately real, observance of such [distinctions] as [those of] caste is not taught’.

and Cumbakas [Ac¯ aryas] should do the same. They may not sit according to the ¯ divisions of their former castes. [For] they are said to form but a single caste of Bhairava, auspicious and eternal. Once a person has taken up this Tantric system he may never mention his former caste. If any [initiate] mentions the former caste of any Putraka, Sadhaka, or Samayin he will have sinned and will ¯ be roasted in hell for three days of the life of Rudra, five of the life of Vis.n. u, and fifteen of the life of Brahma. So, if he aspires to the highest Siddhi he must make ¯ no [such] discriminatory distinctions. O Empress of the Gods, it is [only] through [this] freedom from discimination that one will certainly attain both Siddhi and liberation. 

Rituals involving the participation of people of all castes, especially those consid ered untouchable, is a marked feature here;699 and while the Saiddhantikas were ¯ 

699 See, for example, SANDERSON 2007a, pp. 282–287 for a detailed ac count of the orgiastic cakrakr¯ıd.¯a/v¯ıramel ¯apah. given in the v¯ırat ¯an. d. avavidhi pat.alah. of the Jayadrathay ¯amala’s fourth S. at.ka and by Vimalaprabodha in his K ¯al¯ıkulakram ¯arcana. The participation of women of the following castes/professions, in addition to those of the four Varn. as, is prescribed in those sources: Pukkasa, liquor-seller (dhvajin¯ı), Antyaja, potter (cakrin.¯ı), dyer (chippin.¯ı), butcher (saunak¯ı), Mata ¯ nga, tanner ( ˙ carmak ¯ar¯ı), fisherman (dh¯ıvar¯ı), prosti tute (ve´sy ¯a), washerman (dh ¯avak¯ı), and dancer (nartak¯ı). The M ¯adhavakula (Jayadrathay ¯amala, S. at.ka 4, f. 128r7 [A]; paraphrased in Tantr ¯aloka 29.66 and quoted by Jayaratha thereon [B]) lists nine such woman in this context. They are the wives of a Mata ¯ nga, a D ˙ . omba, a butcher, a confectioner (kandukah.) (kam. duk¯ı A : k ¯armuk¯ı B), a tanner, a liquor-seller, a cremation-ground worker (k ¯ap ¯alikah.), a fisherman, and a potter. The words k ¯ap ¯alikah. and kandukah. have not been registered in our dictionaries in the meanings attested here. The use of the former in the meaning ‘cremation-ground worker’—see also Narmam ¯al ¯a 2.24cd, R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı 7.44ab and 8.995, and Lokaprak ¯a´sa, p. 6, l. 3 (k ¯ap ¯alakah.in a list of serving castes)—survives in the Kashmiri derivative k ¯awoju/k ¯awuju (GRI ERSON 1915 and 1932, p. 495b41–46). For kandukah.in the meaning ‘confec tioner’ see Prakrit kam. d. ua- and kam. daviya-. Such caste-promiscuous orgiastic rites are also attested by Kashmirian critics of Tantric practice. Ks.emendra at tacks them in Da´s ¯avat ¯aracarita 10.26 as a symptom of the degeneration of society that will herald the descent of Kalkin, Vis.n. u’s tenth Avatara: ¯ cakrasthitau rajaka v ¯ayakacarmak ¯arak ¯ap ¯alikapramukha´silpibhir ekap ¯atre | p ¯anena muktim avikalpa ratotsavena vr.ttena cotsavavat ¯a guravo vadanti ‘[At that time] the Gurus teach that liberation is attained in a Cakra gathering by drinking [wine] from a single vessel with dyers of cloth, weavers, tanners, cremation-ground attendants, and other such persons of the service-castes (´silpibhih.), and through ecstatic orgies of indiscrimi nate love-making’; and he gives a vivid description of such a S´ akta ritual in ¯ Nar mam ¯al ¯a 3.1–85 (84cd: nirvibh ¯ago ’bhavat tes.¯am.raticakramahotsavah.). A tanner, a butcher, a potter, a fisherman, and a weaver are mentioned among the participants in 3.13–14. The Kashmirian historian Kalhan. a tells us that king Kalasa (r. 1063– ´ 1089) fell under the corrupting influence of various Tantric teachers, one of whom he describes as a merchant who had become a Guru of dyers and other workers (R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı 7.283: rajak ¯ad¯ın ¯am.´silpin ¯am. gurut ¯am ag ¯at) and was giving initia tion to Bhairava-worshiping S´ akta brahmins ( ¯ bhat.t.ap ¯ad ¯ah.) (7.283). Evidently the term ´silp¯ı used in this context by Ks.emendra has a wider sense than that of ‘artisan’ 

[[294]]

in general prepared to descend in the giving of full initiation only as far as mem bers of those communities classed as Sacchudra, the ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saivas had no such ´ reservations, opening such initiation even to those that brahmanism considered untouchable. As evidence that such initiations were not merely prescribed, for such prescriptions might be more rhetorical than intended to support actual com mon practice, we have the testimony of Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha in his commentary on the Saiddhantika ¯ S ¯ardhatri´satik ¯alottara, addressing a verse in that scripture that might but for his learned intervention be taken to mean that Saiddhantikas ¯ like himself are wrong to draw the line at the Sacchudras. Indeed his ¯ S´ akta ¯ Saiva near-contemporary and fellow Kashmirian Abhinavagupta cites this verse ´ as compelling evidence that Siva has allowed elements of the non-dualistic, caste- ´ transcending view of the S´ aktas to shine through even in this dualistic stratum ¯ of his revelation:700 

It is for this reason that even in these [dualistic scriptures] the Kaula doctrine is present for those who have perceived the [highest state of] resorption, as exem plified in such [texts] as the K ¯alap ¯ada [in the statement] “He may initiate even untouchables”. 

The passage to which Abhinavagupta refers is this:701 

The [transcendent] S´ antyat ¯ ¯ıta [Kal ¯ a] is the supreme, inactive, eternal void. When ¯ [a Guru] has gained knowledge of that, Skanda, he may initiate even untouch ables. 

Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha argues, as one would expect, that it is purely rhetorical in intention, but he introduces into his argument a report that the S´ aktas ¯ 

were citing it in support of their practice of actually initiating such persons. Saiddhantikas, he insists, must not follow their example. ¯702

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

Examples of the initiation of untouchables, indeed of anyone other than brahmins and kings, are naturally hard to find. Nonetheless they are not en tirely absent. Thus the Picumata, when giving an account of its own redactional history in its opening chapter, lists fourteen disciples of a certain Padmabhairava of Orissa, stating their castes, in most cases their places of birth, and, for those who were brahmins, also their Veda and, in the case of Yajurvedins, their S´ akh ¯ a. ¯ They include two untouchables.703 The account lacks the artificiality that might 

kul ¯ac ¯aryair iva bal ¯at kartavyam iti ‘The words ´svapac ¯an api d¯ıks. ayet convey the superiority [of such Gurus rhetorically]. For there is no possibility of [this opta tive’s] being injunctive, because [Pan¯ .ini’s rule As.t.¯adhy ¯ay¯ı 3.3.154 teaches us that] when a verb [in the optative] is qualified by api [before it] the intention is [only] to express the superior capacity [of the agent], as in [the standard example of the grammarians] api parvatam.´siras ¯a bhindy ¯at “He will be able, I fancy, to break a mountain with his head”. So it is right to explain that in this case likewise [the reference to] the initiating of foreigners, untouchables, and the like *is to be un derstood (conj.) in the manner the breaking of a mountain with the head [in that example] and should not be forced to mean, as it is by the Kaula Gurus, that these persons should actually be initiated’. Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha is basing his analysis of api d¯ıks. ayet on As.t.¯adhy ¯ay¯ı 3.3.154 (sam. bh ¯avane ’lam iti cet siddh ¯aprayoge). The example api parvatam.´siras ¯a bhindy ¯at is given in the K ¯a´sik ¯avr.tti thereon. The cru cial point in this rule for Ramakan ¯ .t.ha is that an optative can be used to express the supposition that someone has the ability to do something, provided that the action envisaged does not actually take place (siddh ¯aprayoge). His interpretation is forced, because api is more naturally taken with the noun that precedes it than with the verb that follows.

suggest that it is a pure fabrication, and even if it were fabricated it would nonetheless reveal that this tradition wished to signal to its followers that the initiation of untouchables has a venerable precedent. Similar evidence is to be found in the literature of the S´ akta cult of the goddess Kubjik ¯ a in its accounts of ¯ the nine and sixteen Nathas that initiates include in their worship. Among these ¯ too there are untouchables.704 

Nor is it the case that all Gurus of the Siddhanta would have agreed with ¯ Bhat.t.a Ramakan ¯ .t.ha that the statement in the K ¯alottara is merely rhetorical. This may be inferred from the passage of the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra cited above.705 For that tells the Buddhist adept to acquire a girl for his observance from a family of untouchables as payment for his giving them Saiddhantika ¯ Man. d. ala initiation, which reveals not only that an intimate knowledge of the rit uals of the Siddhanta could be taken for granted among these Tantric Buddhists, ¯ but also that to give Saiva initiation to such people was not out of the question. ´

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

For if it had been, this Buddhist strategy could not have been recommended. Our sources reveal, then, that the Saivas extended their recuitment be- ´ yond the high-caste circles from which most of our evidence of the religion de rives. But, of course, they do not readily reveal the extent to which it was adopted outside these elites. The epigraphical evidence is almost entirely re- ´ stricted in this regard to records of the pious activities of rulers and brahmins, and the Saiva sources, being largely prescriptive in their concerns, tell us much ´ about what should or could be done by or for various categories of person but give us no sense of how widely these prescribed activities were adopted or sup ported. One of the tasks of future research, then, should be to gather data that will improve our ability to address this question. At present I have lit tle to offer in this direction. But I can at least point to evidence that the for tunes of Saivism were not as dependent on the favour of ruling dynasties as ´ most of the data presented here might lead one to assume, enjoying at least in some regions such widespread acceptance that changes in the allegiance of a dynasty had little effect on its popularity. Research into recorded temple con struction in the period 450–1050 in South and North Karnataka, that is to say, in the Tungabhadr ˙ a-K¯ aver ¯ ¯ı and Tungabhadr ˙ a-Bh ¯ ¯ıma zones, has counted 164 ¯ Saiva temples as against 30 Vais ´.n. ava in the former and 199 Saiva as against ´ 32 Vais.n. ava in the latter. This great preponderance of Saiva foundations might ´ be attributed solely to the predilection of the region’s kings, were it not for the evidence of the next three centuries, when the region passed under the rule of the Hoysal.as (c. 1047–c. 1345), who favoured Vais.n. avism over Saivism. For we ´ see a far smaller shift in the preponderance of Saiva temples than the theory of ´ 

dependence on royal patronage would lead us to expect. 293 Vais.n. ava temples were established. But the total of new Saiva foundations remains very high, at ´ about 1,030.706 This suggests the hypothesis that rulers who invested in Saivism ´ the wealth they acquired through conquest and revenue were also reflecting the deeply rooted preference of the majority of their subjects. 

Similarly, in Kashmir the rule of the Vais.n. ava Karkot ¯ .as (c. 626–855) was marked by the founding of many royal Vis.n. us, but it would seem that Saivism, ´ which predominates in the record of religious foundations in earler times, had merely moved out of the limelight.707 For immediately after the demise of that 

706 For all these data see SETTAR 1992, p. 43 and 54. I have added to the Saiva totals ´ those of the much less numerous S´ akta temples. ¯ 

707 For knowledge of non-Buddhist religious foundations in Kashmir during the cen turies before the advent of the Karkot ¯ .a dynasty we depend almost entirely on the account of Kalhan. a’s R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı. It is highly unreliable for this period, being wildly inaccurate in its chronology, and, in the case of the Hunnic Hephthalite kings that reigned from the time of Mihirakula to the advent of the Karkot ¯ .as, that is to 

[[298]]

dynasty it burst forth into its golden age.708 The humbler religious landscape of small-scale religious devotion tells the same story. For among the very nu merous pilgrimage sites of the region those sacred to Siva, Bhairavas, and ´ Saiva ´ goddesses are overwhelmingly in the majority. We see this in an abundant lo cal literature of Mah¯ atmyas, texts in Sanskrit promoting these sites; and we see ¯ it in what survives in manuscript of the K ¯a´sm¯ırat¯ırthasam. graha, a collection of abstracts of materials gathered without sectarian bias by the local Sanskrit scholar Sahibr ¯ am (d. 1872) with the help of a staff of Pan ¯ . d.its for an extensive 

say, c. 530–626, it is evident from numismatic data that it also disordered. But it is significant nonetheless that almost all the early foundations that Kalhan. a records other than Buddhist monasteries and brahmin settlements (Agraharas) are ¯ Saiva. ´ Asoka, evidently the emperor A ´ soka of Buddhist fame, erects a stone enclosure for ´ the national Siva Vijaye ´ svara and two A ´ soke ´ svaras within that enclosure (1.105– ´ 106). His son Jalauka establishes Jyes.t.harudra in the capital (1.124), and builds a stone temple for Bhute ¯ svara at the Nandiks ´ .etra (1.148). His wife ¯Is´anadev ¯ ¯ı es tablishes circles of the Mothers (m ¯atr.cakram) at the points of access to the valley (1.122). Ravan ¯ . a worships Vat.esvara, builds a Mat ´ .ha around it, and dedicates the country to its maintenance (1.195–196). The Hephthalite Huns, with whom his chronicle reaches kings known to us from other sources, are reported to have es tablished Sivas, and, given that they were of Central Asian origin, this no doubt re- ´ flects the fact that Saivism was the dominant tradition of their new subjects, though ´ the Vais.n. avism that would come to the fore under the Karkot ¯ .as begins to over lay the Saiva substrate during and after the interregnum of the non-Kashmirian ´ Matr ¯ .gupta. Mihirakula establishes a Mihiresvara in the capital (1.306). Baka es- ´ tablishes a Bakesvara (1.329), Gop ´ aditya a Jyes ¯ .t.hesvara (1.341), and Khi ´ nkhila ˙ Narendraditya shrines of Bh ¯ ute ¯ svara (1.347). Tu ´ nj ˜ ¯ına I, son of Jalaukas (proba bly this is the Jalauka, founder of Jyes.t.harudra, whom Kalhan. a makes the son of Asoka), establishes a Tu ´ nge ˙ svara (2.14) and Sandhimat founds a Sandh ´ ¯ısvara, an ´ ¯Ise´ svara with the name of his ´ Saiva Guru ´ ¯Is[´ an]a, and many other Li ¯ ngas (2.131– ˙ 134). Tunj ˜ ¯ına Pravarasena I builds the temple of his Siva Pravare ´ svara together ´ with a circle of the Mothers (3.97). The short-reigned non-Kashmirian Matr ¯ .gupta establishes a Vis.n. u Matr ¯ .guptasvamin (3.263). Pravarasena II (probably the succes- ¯ sor of Mihirakula, and identical with Pravarasena I), represented by Kalhan. a as a supremely devout Saiva, intends accordingly to install a Pravare ´ svara in the capital ´ that he has founded with his name (Pravarapura), but a Vis.n. u miraculously takes its place, which the king names Jayasvamin after the architect of the temple (3.350– ¯ 351). But he installs Sadbhava ¯ sr´ ¯ı and four other [Saiva] goddesses (3.353) in the ´ capital. Lah. khan. a Narendraditya, identified by S ¯ TEIN (1900, vol. 1, p. 106) with the Lah. khan. a Udayaditya whose name appears on a Kashmirian silver coin, es- ¯ tablishes Vis.n. u Narendrasvamin (3.383). His brother Tu ¯ nj ˜ ¯ına Ran. aditya prepares ¯ to install two Ran. esvaras in two new temples but Vis ´ .n. u Ran. asvamin miraculously ¯ takes the place of one through the influence of his wife Ran. arambh ¯ a (3.439–455). ¯ The couple establish a Vis.n. u Ran. arambhasv ¯ amin, a ¯ Siva Ran ´. arambhe ¯ svara, and a ´ Mat.ha for Pa¯supatas (3.460). The king establishes the Sun-God Ran ´ . apurasvamin ¯ (3.462), and Amr.taprabha, another wife of his, an Amr ¯ .tesvara (3.463). His son ´ Vikramaditya establishes a Vikrame ¯ svara (3.474) and his wife Bimb ´ a a Bimbe ¯ svara ´ (3.482). On the later Hephthalites in Kashmir see DANI 1996.

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

descriptive survey of these sites and their traditions commissioned by Mahar¯ aja ¯ Ran. b¯ır Singh (r. 1868–1885).709 We also see it in the information on the sacred sites of Kashmir, probably compiled around the seventh century, that is found in the Kashmirian N¯ılamatapur ¯an. a,710 and in the list of the major shrines of the valley given by Kalhan. a in the twelfth century in the preamble of his history of the country.711 

Relevant evidence of another kind is available for Andhra and the Far South, since there, where culturally hostile invaders made fewer and less damaging in roads, there remains intact a much larger body of epigraphical evidence record ing pious donations, engraved on the walls of the temples of the deities to which they were made. A survey of temple building and donation in Andhra during the thirteenth century under the Kakat ¯ ¯ıyas of Warangal has shown that the great majority of endowed deities mentioned in the epigraphical corpus were Saiva. ´ 247 Siva temples constitute 67 per cent of the total and Vais ´.n. ava temples only 19 per cent, and the latter are mostly south of the Krishna river, increasing in frequency the further south they are, no doubt under the influence of the 

resurgence of Vais.n. avism in the Tamil region after Ram¯ anuja (d. 1137). From ¯ the record of those who made donations to these Saiva temples, particularly to ´ 

long-established, major temples such as those of Draks ¯ .ar¯ ama and Tripur ¯ antaka, ¯ we can see that they were far from being restricted to the circles of royalty or the landed gentry. A high proportion of the donations are from herders, women, and traders.712 Likewise in the Tamil country we find in Cola times (850–1279) a number of records of donations to Siva temples made by members ´ of the Sacchudra Vel ¯ .l.al¯.a caste, the dominant cultivators of the region.713 

709 On the Kashmirian Mah¯ atmya literature and the ¯ K ¯a´sm¯ırat¯ırthasam. graha of Sahibr ¯ am see S ¯ TEIN 1900, vol. 2, pp. 383–385. 

710 See TOKUNAGA 1994. 

711 R ¯ajatara ˙ngin.¯ı 1.29–38. Here he mentions the following as the principal deities of the region: Gaur¯ı in the form of the river Vitasta, the N ¯ agas ¯ “Sa´ nkha, Padma, and others”, P ˙ apas ¯ udana (the ¯ Siva Kapat ´.esvara), the goddess ´ Sam. dhya (Sam ¯ . dhyabhat ¯ .t.arik ¯ a), Svayambh ¯ u (a ¯ Siva), Bhed ´. adev ¯ ¯ı, [the Sivas of the] ´ Nandiks.etra (Bhute ¯ svara and Jyes ´ .t.hesvara), ´ S´ arad ¯ adev ¯ ¯ı, Cakradhara (Vis.n. u), and Vijayesvara ( ´ Siva). ´ 

712 This evidence is derived from the work of TALBOT (2001, pp. 87–125), who provides detailed statistics and on their basis presents a cogent analysis of the patterns of temple patronage in this region and period. 

713 For Vel.l.al¯.as who gave to Saiva temples, most commonly cattle or cash to provide ´ an income to fund a perpetual lamp, see, e.g., SII 3:17 of A.D. 1014; SII 3:116 of A.D. 991; SII 13:34 (ARE 312 of 1906) of A.D. 941; SII 13:44 (ARE 227 of 1911); SII 13:56 (ARE 542 of 1920); SII 13:62 (ARE 618 of 1920); SII 13:66 (ARE 238 of 1923); SII 13:112 (ARE 126 of 1914); SII 13:189 (ARE 332 of 1927); SII 13:300 (ARE 5 of 1907) of A.D. 871-907; SII 13:47 (ARE 216 of 1932-1933); SII 14:47 (ARE 216 of 1932-33); SII 14:131 (ARE 213 of 1932-33); SII 14:135 (ARE 416 of 1929-30); SII

There is another manner in which Saivism is likely to have played a sig- ´ nificant part in the process of social integration during this period, one which I wish to touch on only briefly and tentatively at this stage. This was in the incorporation of the many local deity-cults of the regions being drawn into the orbit of the state and its patronage of religion. In this it seems that it was the non-Saiddhantika traditions of the worship of Bhairavas, goddesses, and Yogin ¯ ¯ıs, with their indifference to caste-status and brahmanical criteria of purity and their cults of possession that are likely to have provided the avenue of assimi lation.714 It seems likely, though difficult to prove, that much of the character of these traditions resulted from this process of incorporation on the frontier be tween the brahmanical and the not yet brahmanized. 

THE S´ AIVA-BRAHMANICAL ORDER 

While extending its influence far beyond the confines of the orthodox brah manical world the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga sought to guard itself against ¯ dissociation from that world. It elaborated an inclusivist model of revelation that ranked other religious systems as stages of an ascent to liberation in Saivism, ´ 715

Genesis and Development of Tantrism 

the religion of the king manifest in his initiation, his consecration, and his royal temples, thus mirroring and validating the incorporative structure of the state’s power. But though it thereby asserted, especially in its S´ akta forms, the limited ¯ nature of the brahmanical observance that formed the lowest level and broad base of this hierarchy, it was careful to insist not only that the brahmanical scriptures that govern this observance are exclusively valid in their own domain but also that their injunctions are as binding on Saivas after their initiation as ´ they were before it if they remained in that domain as active members of society. Saiva ascetics were allowed a degree of choice in this matter, at least in theory, ´ but householders were not.716 The religion of the Saivas, then, was not ´ Saivism ´ alone but rather Saivism and Brahmanism, a fact born out not only by their lit- ´ erature but also by biographical data and the epigraphic record of the activities of Saiva kings. ´ 

Moreover, the determination of the Saivism of the Mantram ´ arga to be fully ¯ embedded in the brahmanical tradition is manifest not only in this rule that ini tiates should maintain their brahmanical obligations but also in the fact that they extended their own ritual repertoire in order to bring it into greater congru ence with the brahmanical. To this end they created a Saiva ritual of cremation ´ and a series of rituals to mirror the numerous brahmanical postmortuary rituals in which the deceased receives offerings first as a hungry ghost (pretakriy ¯a) and then in Sr´ addha rituals as an ancestor, after his incorporation with the immedi- ¯ ate ascendants of his patriline (sapin. d.¯ıkaran. am). It is clear that the creators of these additions were motivated by nothing but the desire to be seen to conform to the norms of brahmanical society once the Saivas had moved to extend recruit- ´ ment beyond the inevitably restricted circle of ascetics into the more numerous ranks of married householders. For these rituals and especially the Sr´ addhas ¯ make no sense in srictly Saiva terms, since initiates are held to attain liberation ´ as soon as they leave their bodies and therefore should require no ceremonies designed to ensure their well-being after death.717 This accommodation of Brah 

716 The Saivas’ doctrines of the relationship between their scriptures and those of the ´ brahmanical tradition with respect both to householders and ascetics are examined in detail together with epigraphical evidence in SANDERSON forthcoming b. 

717 For a more detailed examination of the Saiva postmortuary rituals and their ra- ´ tionale see SANDERSON 1995a, pp. 31–38. They are not found in the preceding Pa¯supata tradition of the Atim ´ arga, in which the dead were buried, nor indeed in ¯ the earliest stage of the Mantramarga represented by the substantial ¯ Ni´sv ¯asa cor pus, which in this and numerous other respects remained close to its Atimargic ¯ antecedents, appearing only in the D¯ıks. ottara, which was added to that corpus at a later date, and in several other later scriptures of the Siddhanta, most notably ¯ in the Kiran. a, whose treatment of the Sr´ addha rituals became the basis for that ¯ found in the Paddhati of Somasambhu and the later Paddhatis that followed its ´

manism no doubt gave Saivism a distinct advantage over those religions that ´ denied outright the authority of the brahmanical scriptures and there can be lit tle doubt that this would greatly have increased its acceptability in the eyes of kings, who could thus draw on the power of the new religion to sanctify their rule and enhance their might—the former predominantly through the Siddhanta, the ¯ latter predominantly through the S´ akta ¯ Saiva systems—while at the same time ´ maintaining their legitimacy in their ancient role as the protectors of the brah manical social order. 

As Saivism advanced by developing the strategies explored in this study it ´ achieved a transregional organization and a consequent standardization of its rituals and doctrines; and this transregional uniformity, I propose, would have heightened its appeal to kings by enabling it more easily to be perceived as a transcendent means of legitimation, empowerment, and the integration of re gional traditions, as an essential part of a pan-Indian socio-religious order that each kingdom sought to exemplify. It was by virtue of its great success in at tracting royal patronage that it came to exert such a pervasive influence on the religions around it; and it was also on the basis of this success that it could con struct the impressive edifice of a literature that is almost entirely silent about these vital but less elevated aspects of its life. 

lead. An intermediate stage in this development is probably to be recognized in the Sarvaj ˜n ¯anottara and the Sv ¯ayambhuvas ¯utrasam. graha, which teach a cremation ritual for initiates but make no mention of Sr´ addha rituals. I say that the ¯ Sr´ addhas ¯ make less sense in strictly Saiva terms, because some attempt was made to justify ´ cremation. To create their cremation ritual the Saivas adapted their ritual of initia- ´ tion. The soul of the deceased is to be drawn back into the corpse before it is burned on the pyre in order to undergo initiation, just as it did in life. Since the function of initiation is to liberate the soul by destroying all that impedes its liberation this re-initiation of the deceased was justified as a means of eliminating any obstacles that might still be present as a result of the initiate’s failure to expiate breaches of discipline that had not been expiated during his lifetime.

CONVENTIONS IN THE FOOTNOTES 

Where I have rejected the reading of a text-edition, inscription, or manu script, I have substituted my proposed reading and marked the point at which it begins with a superscript asterisk. Its end is indicated by the beginning of the parenthesis that follows. In that I first state whether I judge the proposed read ing to be a simple correction (corr.), an emendation (em.), a conjecture (conj.), or, in one case, a diagnostic conjecture (diagn. conj.). By the last I mean a conjecture that restores what I take to be the intended meaning of the author while recog nizing that an alternative wording is possible. I maintain no clear-cut distinction between corrections, emendations, and conjectures. I intend thereby only to dis tinguish approximately between three levels of decreasing obviousness. Where the reading adopted is my own proposal no further information is added. Where it has been proposed by another I have given the surname of the proposer af ter the abbreviation (e.g. em. MIRASHI). These abbeviations, or abbreviations followed by a name, are followed by a single space, a colon, and a single space, after which I have given the reading that I have rejected. That is followed by an 

[[348]]

abbreviation that indicates whether the source is the edition of the text (Ed.) or inscription (Ep.) listed in the bibliography, or the manuscript (Cod.) listed in the same. Where more than one manuscript has been cited, they are distinguished by the sigla assigned in the same. When I have given a translation of a passage in which I have rejected a reading or readings I indicate this in the translation only in the case of what I have classified as conjectures, e.g. ‘*Vidyesvaras on ´ the northern altar (conj.)’. Any testimonium is given in square brackets after the reading that it supports. In a few cases in which I have judged a word to have been lost I have inserted it between angle brackets (e.g. <ca>) and where I have judged that insertion to be less than certain I have followed it with a question mark (e.g. <svadharma?>). In my translations I have marked the cor responding words in the same way. Where I can offer no cure but judge that the intended meaning can be deduced from the context I have given that meaning in my translation enclosed between a superscript asterisk and a question mark in parenthesis. Where I judge a reading to be corrupt but can offer no cure even on the level of meaning alone I have marked the beginning of the reading with a superscript asterisk followed by a question mark in parenthesis, and marked the corresponding place in my translation with a superscript asterisk followed by three dots and a question mark in parentheses. In general I have standard ized the Sandhi and orthography of the Sanskrit in all citations, whether from texts or inscriptions. All translations of the text-passages that I have cited are my own.
