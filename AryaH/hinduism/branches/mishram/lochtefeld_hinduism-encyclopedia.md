vIntroduction
As you drive through the cornfields of northern Illinois, just north of the town of
Aurora, you may see a massive brick building that seems out of place. It stands three
or four stories high with an elaborate facade depicting pillars and cornices. Topped by
towering spires with flapping banners, it looks as if it belongs to another world. In a
sense it does—the architectural style comes from southern India, and the building
itself is a Hindu temple.
I was there late on a Sunday morning, and the parking lot was about half full.
There were cars from as far away as Michigan. The building’s main entrance was a little
below ground level, and as is common with Hindu temples outside of India, the low-
est level had a lobby, a kitchen, and a large meeting room that was comparable to the
“church basements” of its Christian counterparts. The lobby was furnished austerely,
with folding tables and chairs. There were a few people sitting near the kitchen, drink-
ing tea and chatting informally.
By the staircases leading upstairs to the temple room were rows of simple shelves,
fronted by low benches. I removed my shoes, as is customary before entering a temple,
both to preserve the temple and to signify that one is walking on holy ground. The
staircase marked the threshold between two regions, the outer and the inner world.
Upstairs, the temple was richly decorated. The presiding deity was Venkateshvara, a
form of the god Vishnu, whose image was placed in the center of the temple, the most
important space. Yet, as in most Hindu temples, there were images of deities from
throughout the pantheon: Ganesh, Shiva, Subrahmanya, other forms of Vishnu, dif-
ferent forms of the Goddess, and various subsidiary deities. Most of the images were
carved from black South Indian granite and polished to a mirrorlike finish. Many were
housed in small shrines built out of white marble. The primary function of a Hindu
temple is to serve as the home for the deities it contains, and it was clear that the
people who had commissioned the temple had spared no efforts. The temple had
been lovingly built and has been carefully maintained.
The worshipers in the temple took little notice of me, and I was allowed to roam
as I wished. Even though Venkateshvara was the temple’s presiding deity, the primary
activity while I was there took place in front of one of the subsidiary shrines, an image
of the Goddess in the form of Kumari (“virgin”). Seated around the image were about
twenty members of an extended family. The young girls, who were clearly the focus of
the rite, sat directly in front of the shrine. Brahmin priests took various offerings from
the older women: plastic gallon jugs of milk, Ziploc bags of sugar, and Tupperware
containers of yogurt and honey. Each offering was poured over the image in turn. A
pitcher of water was poured over the image between each offering to wash it clean.
The temple priests performing the rite were dressed traditionally, with white dhotis
(garments worn around the waist, extending below the knees), bare chests, and the
sacred thread over their left shoulders. They bore crisp red tilaks (sectarian identifying
marks) on their foreheads, and intoned the rite in rapid-fire Sanskrit.
Although a Christian visitor might find the languages, deities, and rites completely
alien, many of the other elements of the day would be soothingly familiar: a group of
families coming for worship on a Sunday morning, dressed in their “Sunday best,”
with others chatting over coffee and sweets in the “church basement.” Except for a few
sari-clad older women, the people there were dressed no differently than anyone one
might encounter on the street—the men in suits and jackets, the girls and women in
long, flowing dresses.
Just as the Hindu temple in rural Illinois had introduced Indian customs to the
local community, it was clear that the influence of American culture had set this
temple apart from its traditional counterparts in India. Unlike in India, where temples
serve mainly as places of worship, Hindu temples in America often serve as cultural
centers for the Hindu community, sponsoring events such as dance, music, and
drama performances, along with language study programs and festival celebrations.
viIn many cases, the membership of Hindu temples in America cuts across the tradi-
tional barriers that divide Indian society—social status, regional background, sectar-
ian loyalty—giving these Hindu temples far more inclusive constituencies.
The cultural landscape of the United States has changed dramatically in recent
years. Today it possesses a plurality of cultures that my grandparents and their gener-
ation probably would have found inconceivable. The Hindu temple outside of Aurora,
Illinois, is but one small sign of the increasing visibility of Asian cultures in American
society. Another sign of this pluralism is the growing number of ways that Americans
are coming into contact with traditional Hindu culture—whether through practicing
yoga, through alternative medical systems such as ayurvedic medicine, or through the
piquant delights of Indian cuisine.
Despite the growing interchange between Indian and American cultures,
Hinduism is still often stereotyped and misunderstood. On one hand are the remnants
of an antiquated point of view that refuses to see the United States as anything but a
Christian nation. Those holding this view either dismiss Hinduism as an alien or exotic
set of rituals and beliefs or actively condemn it as idolatrous. On the other hand are
people searching for an alternative spirituality who idealize Asian cultures as founts of
ancient wisdom. At the very least, such an uncritical embrace ignores these cultures’
genuine tensions, problems, and inequities; at the extreme it can result in a “designer
religion,” in which beliefs and practices from various religious traditions are selec-
tively adopted, wrenching each of these elements from its roots in a living culture.
Outright condemnation and idealized acceptance overlook the richness and com-
plexity of India’s religious and cultural traditions. To gain a genuine understanding, it
is important that we discern the cultural context behind Hindu beliefs, practices, and
history. In learning about this context, one quickly encounters familiar ideas: hard
work, thrift, education, and the importance of the family. Along with these general
similarities to American cultural values, one finds equally profound differences. To
examine the nuances of Hindu culture is to enter into a rich and complex world with
its own inner logic and consistency. Encountering and understanding a different
world view can throw one’s own into sharper perspective, enriching it with new depth
and understanding.
What Is Hinduism?
The very word Hinduism is misleading. The word was coined by the British as an
umbrella term, referring to any and all forms of religion in India, many of which share
few if any common features. It was used to describe all sorts of beliefs and practices,
from simple nature worship to the most highly sophisticated ritual and philosophical
systems.
Hinduism is a vast religious tradition, encompassing various and contradictory
strands and ideas. It has usually defied all the usual strategies for categorization and
classification. There is no founder, no definitive scripture, no centralized authority, no
single supreme god, no creed of essential beliefs, and no heresy. Thus, it would be
more accurate to think of the religion as Hinduisms rather than Hinduism, since this
would reflect the rich diversity one encounters.
India is a land of contrasts and cultural variety. The subcontinent contains almost
every type of environmental ecosystem, the inhabitants of each possessing their own
local and regional culture. There are over a dozen distinct languages, each of which
establishes and nourishes a regional identity that many Indians maintain with great
care wherever they live. The combinations of language, regional identity, sectarian
affiliation, and social status have given rise to overwhelming variation. For Hindus,
diversity is a basic trait of Hindu life, and thus one person’s practice may be very dif-
ferent from another’s. This has given Hinduism little in the way of centralized
doctrine or dogma, but its grounding in everyday life has made it extraordinarily
resilient and adaptable.
viiBasic Beliefs
Hinduism is first and foremost a way of life. This means that Hinduism has tended to
be orthoprax (stressing correct behavior) rather than orthodox (stressing correct
belief). It tends to be woven through the differing elements of everyday life, rather
than only performed as practices or rituals for certain days and times. Hindu religious
expression is conveyed through every facet of society: music, dance, art and architec-
ture, philosophy, politics, literature, and social life.
Some of the most important aspects of everyday life in the Hindu tradition are a
person’s family and social affiliations. Despite the incredible variety of Hindu belief
and practice, each family and local community is tightly and carefully organized.
Every individual, as a member of a particular family, has a well-defined role and an
obligation to fulfill specific duties. As in any culture, one’s individual identity is
strongly shaped by the linguistic, regional, or sectarian characteristics of his or her
family. This familial influence persists whether the family lives in its ancestral home or
moves to a different region of India or a foreign country.
Families, of course, are members of a larger community. These communities share
certain beliefs about a person’s proper role in society based on status, age, and gender.
Traditional Indian society was sharply hierarchical. According to the traditional social
groupings, there should be four status groups: the brahmins, who are scholars and
religious technicians; the kshatriyas, who are warriors and rulers; the vaishyas, who
are artisans and farmers; and the shudras, who serve the others. Each person is born
as a permanent member of a particular group. Society is seen as an organic whole, in
which some parts have higher status than others, but every part is necessary for the
whole to function smoothly. A common metaphor for social organization is the
human body, which has many different parts performing many different functions, all
of which are necessary for the body’s maintenance and well-being. In actual practice,
the picture was far more complex. Each of these four groups was split into hundreds
of subgroups known as jatis. Jatis were most often identified with a certain hereditary
occupation, and a jati’s status in a particular place was subject to all kinds of local vari-
ables. These variables could include whether or not members of a jati owned land or
the degree to which a jati’s occupation was economically vital to its community.
These beliefs about social status are becoming less important in modern India,
and have even less importance for Hindus who live abroad. In modern India, society
is still functionally divided into four groups: brahmins; “forward castes,” which tend to
control land, money, or power; “backward castes,” which have historically had very
little influence, although the situation is changing rapidly; and Dalits (“oppressed”).
Once called “untouchables,” many Dalits live in poverty and oppressive social condi-
tions. Except for the brahmins, these social divisions bear little relationship to the four
groups in the earlier model.
Reincarnation is still a pervasive belief within Hinduism, as it is in other Indian
religions such as Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. Almost all Hindus have generally
accepted that although our bodies are transient, our souls are immortal. After the
death of a particular body, the soul will inhabit a different body. The nature of one’s
incarnation in a future life is determined by the quantity and quality of one’s karma.
Karma literally means “action,” but it also can be generated by words or even thoughts.
It is not produced only by the things one does or says, but also by one’s underlying
motives. An individual’s good karma will bring a favorable rebirth in heaven as a god
or on earth as a wealthy or high-caste human being. Bad karma will bring an unfavor-
able rebirth. A person’s current social status reveals how properly he or she lived in the
previous life. The notion of karmic rewards and punishments is a central justification
for the traditional social hierarchy in India.
Karma is thought of as a purely physical process, like gravity, operating without
any need for a divine overseer. An action one performs, for good or for ill, is seen as
viiithe cause, with the future reward or punishment as the effect. Some of these con-
sequences occur in this life, while others occur in future lives. Since karma reflects
the overall tone of one’s life, it is comparable to the notion of a person’s “character”:
Both are formed over a long period of time, both are measures of the whole person,
and both reflect how our habitual ways of feeling, thinking, and acting tend to
shape who we are.
It is tempting to envision reincarnation as an opportunity to rectify past mistakes
or to learn lessons still unlearned. For Hindus, as for Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains, noth-
ing could be further from the truth; reincarnation is never seen as an opportunity, but
invariably as a burden. This is because all states of being, both good and bad, are ulti-
mately impermanent and thus provide no sure refuge. Even the gods, who are enjoy-
ing the rewards of their past actions, will be born elsewhere when their stored merit is
exhausted. Others are enduring punishment for their sins, but when this is done they
will be reborn elsewhere.
Although most Hindus would grant that liberation from reincarnation (moksha) is
the ultimate goal, traditional Hindu culture has sanctioned three other goals, all of
which are more compatible with a normal life in society: the search for pleasure
(kama); the quest for wealth, fame, and power (artha); and, above all, the search for a
righteous, balanced life (dharma). This stress on multiple goals reflects the flexibility
of Hindu religious life. Each person can pursue different goals according to his or her
inclinations, although certain goals are considered to be more appropriate for partic-
ular stages of life. In this way a person is free to express his or her individual religious
identity, although that identity is inevitably shaped by forces arising from a larger
familial, social, and cultural context.
The Roots of Hinduism
The influences and developments of Hinduism are as expansive as the roots and
branches of a banyan tree. A banyan tree is unusual in that in addition to the tree’s
upward spreading branches, it also has branches that grow down, take root, and
become trunks in their own right. An old banyan tree can be hundreds of feet in diam-
eter, and it is often difficult to discern which is the original trunk. In the same way, the
religion that we call Hinduism is constantly evolving. New religious forms arise from
the older ones, while many of the older ones continue to exist. Despite Hinduism’s
complex origins, its religious history can be roughly divided into six periods, corre-
sponding to the development of varying religious tendencies and ideas.
The earliest and most mysterious of these is the period of the Indus Valley
Civilization, named for the large ruined cities found throughout the Indus Valley and
beyond. The ruins of prominently placed storage granaries indicate that the civiliza-
tion’s economic base was agricultural, and the striking uniformity of the ruins of these
cities leads one to believe that the people were bound by some strong central author-
ity. Archaeologists have recovered a wealth of physical artifacts, revealing a great deal
about the layout of the cities, what the inhabitants ate and wore, and the animals they
domesticated. At the same time, nothing is certain about the religious life of these
people, although certain artifacts have raised intriguing speculations. It is not even
known whether the religion and culture of the Indus Valley Civilization have contin-
ued to affect Indian culture, although some scholars have been more inclined to infer
this than others.
This culture seemed to lose its vitality sometime around 2000 B.C.E. Within a few
centuries it had largely disappeared from the Indus Valley, although it remained vital
for much longer in outlying regions, particularly Gujarat. According to some theories,
its decline was the result of a prolonged drought. The latter part of its decline was
marked by the arrival of the Aryans. This brought Hinduism into its second period of
religious history. The Aryans were a nomadic cattle-herding people whose earliest reli-
gious text, the Rg Veda, is believed to have been preserved unchanged for almost four
ixthousand years. The later strata of the Vedas were composed as the Aryans moved
through the Punjab into the Ganges basin. These later parts of the Vedas included the
Brahmana literature, which stressed the importance of sacrifice, and the later
Aranyakas and Upanishads, which tended to focus on more speculative and philo-
sophical questions. During the period in which the Aranyakas and Upanishads were
composed, asceticism became an increasingly important element of Hinduism.
Asceticism denotes the use of physical discipline and deprivation as a way to attain
religious insight and liberate the soul from the cycle of reincarnation. Part of the rea-
son for asceticism’s prominence was the growth of competing groups, such as the Jains
and the Buddhists, whose monks lived an ascetic life. Asceticism has had an important
place in Indian religious life since that time.
The period after the composition of the Vedic literature is sometimes called the
Epic period. Between roughly 300 B.C.E. and 500 C.E., many of the ideas most impor-
tant to classical Hinduism were developed and codified. This time was marked by the
initial composition of the two great Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, although their final revisions came centuries later. The early part of
this period also saw the composition of the religious literature known as the Kalpa
Sutras. In theory, each Kalpa Sutra had three parts: a shrauta sutra, a grhya sutra, and
a dharma sutra, but this neat ordering is belied by the scarcity of complete three-part
collections, and the abundance of one or another of these sections without its corre-
sponding parts. Shrauta sutras are manuals for Vedic sacrifice, which had become so
complex that additional reference material was needed. The shrauta sutra is the only
element of the three that has not retained great importance in modern Hindu life.
The grhya sutras are manuals for domestic sacrifices, which include the life-cycle
rites known as samskaras. Some elements of the grhya sutras still remain vital and
vibrant parts of modern Hindu religious life, probably because of their connection
with the central transitions in human life: birth, marriage, and death. The dharma
sutras provide prescriptions for an organized and stable society by means of a rigid
social hierarchy. The prescriptions in the dharma sutras were later expanded in the
dharma shastras, which are the theoretical basis of the Hindu social structure.
Aside from the epics and the Kalpa Sutras, this period was also notable for the
development of the six classical philosophical schools: the Nyaya, Vaisheshika,
Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta (although the defining figure in the Vedanta
school, Shankaracharya, is generally dated in the early ninth century). The philo-
sophical system developed by each of these six schools had a common goal: liberat-
ing the soul from the bondage of reincarnation. Each of the schools believed that the
soul could be liberated by avoiding conceptual errors and apprehending universal
truths, although there was considerable disagreement about the nature of these uni-
versal truths. The foundational texts for each of these schools laid out their basic
philosophical position; in some cases, these texts buttressed their position by
appealing to authoritative religious texts such as the Vedas. Over the following cen-
turies these foundational texts received further elaboration through multiple layers
of commentaries, which in some cases have continued to be written almost up until
contemporary times.
This period is also marked by the rise in importance of the deities Shiva, Vishnu,
and the Goddess, who are still the primary deities worshiped in modern Hinduism.
These deities had a central place in the sectarian literature known as the puranas,
another of the important types of text composed in this period. The puranas’ most
notable feature is their sectarian character, as they often exalt one particular deity over
the others. They also include information on many other aspects of religious life,
including sacred places, sacred times, instructions for various religious rites, and even
descriptions of the heavens and hells. The final type of religious text first composed in
this period were the tantras, which laid out esoteric and often hidden ritual traditions.
xIn later times, both the puranas and the tantras have been the subject of extensive
commentaries. In addition, this period saw the development of new artistic and archi-
tectural styles. Many of the forces manifested or formed in this period remain integral
parts of contemporary Hindu life.
The period following this was marked by the growth and flowering of the devo-
tional (bhakti) tradition, which for more than a millennium has been one of the most
powerful religious forces in Hindu culture. Bhakti stresses the necessity of a direct and
personal relationship with God, in whatever form that deity is conceived. Its propo-
nents tended to be contemptuous of the neatly constructed social order detailed in
the dharma shastras, which stressed birth rather than devotional capacity as the most
important criterion. Much of medieval Hindu thought was formed out of the tension
between these two competing ideals, dharma and bhakti, and there was often no easy
resolution of the conflict between their differing perspectives.
The growing presence of Europeans in India marked the next period in
Hinduism’s history. Although there had been a European presence in India since the
mid-1500s, when the Portuguese colonized Goa, the introduction of British colonists
presented the greatest challenge to Indian society. In the early 1600s, the British East
India Company gained its first foothold with a trading station at Surat in modern
Gujarat and gradually put down additional roots in Bombay, Madras, and the Bengal
region. With the effective collapse of the Moghul empire in the mid-1700s, the nobil-
ity that ruled peripheral regions such as Bengal began to function independently. This
allowed the British to displace the indigenous rulers as the political authorities and
the recipients of land revenue. The East India Company was a commercial venture,
and its primary goal was to make money for its shareholders. Yet the Indian body
politic was so fragmented that the company encountered little effective resistance
and aggressively expanded its sphere of influence from Bengal up the Ganges River
valley and into central India. In some cases the company would simply absorb small
kingdoms under the pretense of protecting law and order, especially when the leader-
ship had no clear line of succession. In other cases it would make agreements with
local nobility to create small princely states, some of which survived until Indian inde-
pendence in 1947. General discontent with the company’s aggressive expansion
finally exploded in the rebellion of 1857–58, after which India was governed as part of
the British Empire.
The company was primarily driven by economic motives, but it justified its pater-
nal presence by portraying the Indians as unable to govern themselves effectively.
Although the company’s policy was not to interfere with its subjects’ religious lives,
since any such tensions would be bad for business, the company’s board of directors
in England was under strong domestic pressure to open up their dominions to
Christian missionary activity. Contemporary missionary polemics against Hinduism
usually stressed repugnant practices such as sati (the burning of a widow on her hus-
band’s funeral pyre), child marriage, the pitiable plight of many widows, or Hindu
“idolatry.” Such political and religious critiques assumed the implicit superiority of
European Christian culture and provided the moral sanction for colonialism that
Rudyard Kipling described as the “white man’s burden.”
Hindus responded to these critiques in several ways. The most violent response
came in the rebellion of 1857–58, in which popular discontent led various groups to
try to drive the British out of India. Although there was widespread opposition to
British rule, it was never unified, allowing the British to defeat their adversaries one by
one. A far more effective response came in religious terms, as progressive Hindus
attempted to respond to the missionary critiques. One result of this was the formation
of various societies, such as the Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, and Arya Samaj. The
first two of these attempted to reform Hindu religious life by removing certain offen-
sive practices in response to criticism from outsiders. These practices included the
xicaste system, child marriage, and the ban on widow remarriage. The Arya Samaj was
formed to regenerate and revitalize Hinduism, with the explicit position that
Hinduism was far superior to Christianity and Islam.
The end of the nineteenth century was also marked by the gradual establishment
of Hinduism as a viable religious tradition in the West, as Hindu teachers arrived in
Europe and America. Some of the early figures were Swami Vivekananda and
Paramahamsa Yogananda, and the more recent ones are Prabhupada, Muktananda,
Yogi Bhajan, Guru Maharaj Ji, Krishnamurti, and Shri Chinmoy. This recent group of
teachers had an explicit missionary goal, aiming to gain followers among native-born
Europeans and Americans.
The most recent period in the development of Hindu religious traditions is
marked by the emigration of Indians to America. Many Indians have settled abroad
seeking education or to pursue specialized careers. They have established centers of
Hindu worship, like the temple Aurora, to serve the needs of the Indian community,
including the need to pass on a sense of Hindu identity to their children. Yet despite
their efforts to preserve their traditions and culture, their very presence in a different
society is causing changes in their religious lives. American society has made certain
traditions more difficult to preserve. For example, the community often celebrates
religious festivals on the weekend following the traditional festival day, since this is
when people have more spare time. Life in American society and the influence of
American values have also made it difficult to conform to certain traditional patterns.
The traditional requirement that Hindus marry within their jati has been assailed both
by the American emphasis on the importance of a “love marriage” and by the poten-
tial shortage of suitable partners. In the same way, certain dietary restrictions become
harder to maintain but have greater complexity. A Hindu in America must decide not
only if he or she should simply avoid eating beef but also whether to avoid any place
where beef is served.
In India, the twentieth century has been marked by the development of an
assertive and militant Hindu nationalism. Hindu nationalism’s “founding father” was
V. D. Savarkar, but the most important body promoting this idea in the recent past has
been the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS is the mother organization for
many different affiliates, ranging from labor unions to student organizations to social
relief bodies. Its two most important affiliates for promoting Hindu nationalism are
the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a religious organization, and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP), a mass-based political party. In the early 1990s, both organizations were
instrumental in radical Hindu politics, particularly in the destruction of a mosque
alleged to have been built on the site of the god Rama’s birthplace in the North Indian
city of Ayodhya. Since that time, the VHP has retained its radical edge, but the BJP has
not. The BJP has put greater distance between itself and the VHP, seeking to move
toward the political center and thus expand its reach in electoral politics. It has begun
stressing issues that are vital to a broader spectrum of Hindu voters, such as corrup-
tion and the rising cost of living.
This encyclopedia offers the student of religion a place to begin exploring the key
elements of Hindu religious culture and practice. I hope that the entries will be a
springboard for further study of this great, living religious tradition.

Note on Dates
In many cases, determining dates for the lives of Indian figures is problematic
because there are not good records for many figures, even in comparatively modern
times. The most definite dates tend to be from inscriptions, and thus this evidence is
best for kings and others who were able to commission inscriptions. Philosophers,
devotional poets, and writers often could not. In this book, a question mark follows
dates that scholars have determined by inference (for example, based on internal
evidence in texts, such as references to historical events) but are not backed up by
documentary evidence.

xxixAbhijnanashakuntala
## A
Abhang
(“unbroken”) Poetic form characteristi-
cally used by the saint-poets of the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba. Each abhang is usu-
ally made up of four lines, with an abbc
rhyme scheme. Although each abhang is
a complete poem in its own right, they
are often strung together in groups, to
create either a longer narrative poem (in
which each abhang stands as one
segment) or a group of poems devoted
to a common theme. Such versatility
made it one of the dominant poetic
forms in the Marathi language, just as
the doha form is ubiquitous to medieval
and modern Hindi.
Abhava
(“[knowledge from] absence”) Abhava is
one of the two means of valid knowledge
(pramana) unique to the Purva
Mimamsa school of philosophy, the
other being presumption (arthapatti). All
Indian philosophical schools concern
themselves with codifying pramanas,
that is, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate knowl-
edge. Behind this concern lies the basic
Hindu religious goal of learning to live,
act, and think in a way that leads to the
final liberation of the soul from the cycle
of reincarnation (samsara). Almost all
schools accept perception (pratyaksha),
inference (anumana), and authoritative
testimony (shabda) as pramanas. The
Purva Mimamsa school claims that
abhava, or perception of the absence of
something (“there is no jug in this room”),
is a means of knowledge that cannot be
accounted for by the other pramanas.
Abhaya Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta) in which
the hand is held with the palm facing
out, with the fingers together and point-
ing upward. The word abhaya means
“without fear,” and the gesture is meant
to reassure the viewer that all will be
well. This hand gesture can be found in
most depictions of the Hindu gods and
goddesses, particularly when the deity
in question has multiple hands.
Abhijnanashakuntala
(“Recognition of Shakuntala”) Drama
written by Kalidasa (5th c. C.E.), who is
widely considered the greatest classical
Sanskrit poet. The Abhijnanashakuntala
describes the trials and troubles of the
mythical heroine Shakuntala and is con-
sidered Kalidasa’s greatest drama. In the
story, Shakuntala, the daughter of the
sage Vishvamitra and the celestial
nymph Menaka, attracts the eye of
King Dushyanta while he is away from
his kingdom on a hunting trip.
Shakuntala and Dushyanta marry by
mutual consent, in what is known as a
gandharva marriage. After their mar-
riage, Dushyanta returns to his king-
dom. Shakuntala remains at her home
and has the misfortune to irritate the
sage Durvasas, who curses her to be
forgotten by her beloved. Shakuntala
pleads with Durvasas, who is moved to
mitigate the curse such that
Dushyanta will remember everything
if Shakuntala can show Dushyanta a
sign of their union. Dushyanta had
given Shakuntala his signet ring, but
she loses it before she can see him.
Denied by Dushyanta, Shakuntala
endures numerous trials until she
finds the ring in the belly of a fish.
When Dushyanta sees the ring, he
immediately recognizes Shakuntala
(hence the play’s name), and they live
happily ever after.
The Abhijnanashakuntala has two
features that characterize most classical
Sanskrit plays. One is the preference for
a happy ending, although this resolution
[[1]]
Abhimanyu
Dancers performing in the Kathak style. Most Kathak performances include dances in the abhinaya genre,
in which performers use dance to act out a story from religious literature.
is usually preceded by trial and tribula-
tion. The other is that the drama’s
dialogue is in two different languages.
Characters from the higher classes
speak Sanskrit, the language of high,
learned culture. Characters from the
lower classes (including many of the
women) speak in Prakrit, an umbrella
term for the grammatically simpler
vernacular languages that developed
from Sanskrit through natural linguistic
change. This difference in dialogue
doubtless reflected the social realities of
the time in which the play was written,
when Sanskrit would have been the elite
language but was always learned as a
second language after learning one’s
[[2]]

“natural” language. The play has been
translated into English by Michael
Coulson and published in an anthology
titled Three Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Abhimanyu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Abhimanyu is one of
Arjuna’s sons by his wife, Subhadra.
Abhimanyu is known as a great warrior
who fights with valor in the
Mahabharata war. As he fights in battle,
he enters the enemy’s chakravyuha
formation, a battle array that is widely
believed to be virtually impenetrable.
According to tradition, Arjuna is one of
the few people who knows how toAbortion
counter the chakravyuha. While
Abhimanyu was in his mother’s womb,
he heard his father describe how to
penetrate it. Once Abhimanyu is in,
however, he realizes that he does not
know how to get out, and although he
kills a great number of the enemy, he is
eventually slain.
Abhinavagupta
(10th c. C.E.) Kashmiri writer famous
for his works on poetics and aesthet-
ics. Abhinavagupta was a pivotal figure
in the development of Trika Shaivism,
a particular religious community
devoted to the god Shiva. The writer’s
most famous religious work is the
Tantraloka, a twelve-volume work elu-
cidating the metaphysics and ritual of
Trika Shaivism. His Dhvanyaloka gives
similar attention to aesthetics and
poetics. See also Kashmir and Shaiva.
Abhinaya
(“bringing near”) In Indian drama, the
general name given to acting. Its ulti-
mate purpose is to convey an emotion
through a look or gesture and thus
“bring” it to the audience. In Indian
dance, this term refers to a piece in
which the dancer acts out a story, with
the aim to convey to the viewers the
emotions of her character. Particularly
with Indian dance, this sort of acting is
not mere artistry, however refined, but
carries explicit religious meaning. Not
only is the story’s content often drawn
from religious literature, but most
Indian dance forms were first per-
formed in temples as entertainment
for the resident deity.
Abhira
Sanskrit term for Ahir. See Ahir.
Abhisheka
(“anointing”) Ritual bathing (snana) or
anointing with water, particularly of
the image of a deity during worship. In
earlier times this term referred to the
ritual anointing of a king at his corona-
tion (rajabhiseka). In modern times
the term can also apply to anointing or
sprinkling individuals with water dur-
ing religious or life cycle rituals, partic-
ularly rites of initiation (diksha)
involving a change of status for the ini-
tiate—such as the shift from house-
holder to initiated ascetic or in the
ritual tradition known as tantra, an
initiation bestowing certain ritual and
religious qualifications (adhikara). In
both cases the anointing is intended to
honor the initiate, to evoke images of
royal coronation, and to suggest the
importance of the occasion.
Abortion
Hindu views toward abortion have
varied widely over the course of time.
It is unequivocally condemned in the
dharma literature, which prescribes
loss of caste for a person procuring an
abortion or for a woman having one.
This prescription may have been
based on the use of abortion to con-
ceal illegitimate births, but it may well
have been condemned because it
entailed the loss of a potential son.
In modern times attitudes have
changed somewhat, in part because of
family planning initiatives and in
more recent times because of the
technology available for sex determi-
nation. Abortion facilities are now
more widely available in India due to
the government’s emphasis on family
planning and population control, and
there is less social stigma associated
with the procedure. However, tradi-
tional proscriptions remain. With the
advent of methods for prenatal sex
determination, couples began selec-
tively aborting female fetuses because
sons are more highly valued in Hindu
society. This practice was widespread
and generated such concern that it
was outlawed in 1995, although the
law has reportedly only succeeded in
driving this practice underground.
[[3]]
Achala Ekadashi
Achala Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half of
the lunar month of Jyeshth
(May–June). As are all of the eleventh-
day observances, this is dedicated to
the worship of the god Vishnu. The
name Achala means “immovable”;
another name for this ekadashi is
apara, meaning “matchless.” The
name refers to the religious merit gen-
erated by observing this festival,
which, according to tradition, cannot
be nullified or overturned. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites,
usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance.
Individual observance varies depend-
ing on a person’s piety and inclina-
tions. Fasting, for instance, can vary
from abstaining only from certain
foods to refraining from all foods dur-
ing the day. Individuals may go to tem-
ples for worship, or they may worship
in their homes. Faithfully observing
this festival is believed to absolve one
of the evil effects of one’s past deeds,
particularly deeds that would result in
birth as a pret, or unquiet spirit, and
also to increase one’s fame, wealth,
and religious merit.
Achamana
(“sipping”) The act of sipping water that
has been poured or scooped into one’s
right hand. This is performed as a rite of
purification. Achamana is a symbolic
action that has been incorporated into
many religious rituals. It is also part of
the required early morning ablutions,
the purpose of which is to remove any
impurity (ashaucha) encountered while
sleeping. In the Hindu tradition, human
beings are considered impure upon
waking for a number of reasons. Since
sleep entails loss of consciousness, one
may not know whether one has come
into contact with impurity. Further, bod-
ily functions that may occur while sleep-
ing cause impurity. In addition, it is
popularly believed that one’s soul
[[4]]

(atman) leaves the body during sleep
and then reenters it before the body
awakens. While the soul is gone, the
body is believed to be a corpse, which is
an impurity that must be cleansed.
Achamaniya
(“to be sipped”) The fifth of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the god as an hon-
ored guest. In this upachara, the deity is
offered water for rinsing and cleaning
the mouth. The actual act of offering can
be done in various ways and often
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.
In some cases the water vessel will sim-
ply be presented before the deity’s
image, with the understanding that the
water has been taken, whereas in other
cases the devotee (bhakta) will actually
rinse the image’s mouth. In either case
the underlying motive is to show love for
the deity and to minister to its needs.
Achara
(“conduct”) Appropriate or approved
behavior according to customary law,
which is established in the dharma lit-
erature. The dharma assumes that soci-
ety is made up of different social
subgroups known as jatis, which are
usually defined (and hierarchically
arranged) by the group’s hereditary
occupation. Each jati had its own cus-
tomary code of appropriate behavior,
and there were often sharp differences
between them. For example, it was often
acceptable for members of lower-status
jatis to eat meat and drink liquor,
whereas these practices were forbidden
to higher-status groups. Aside from the
customary rules of one’s social group or
subgroup, notions of appropriate
behavior for a particular person would
also be shaped by age and gender con-
siderations: A young and sexually fertile
woman would be subject to far greater
restrictions than a postmenopausal
woman, since any sexual scandal (or
even the hint of it) could ruin a youngAct of Truth
woman’s opportunities for a good mar-
riage or produce an illegitimate child.
Acharya
Traditional term of respect for a
religious leader or a spiritual teacher;
the word connotes great learning as
well as a religious life. The term
literally means someone who knows
or teaches about achara, the
traditionally accepted way of life
prescribed in the dharma literature.
As a title in modern Hindu life, it indi-
cates the respect and social standing
conveyed by the English word doctor.
Achintyabhedabheda
(“inconceivable identity and differ-
ence”) Key philosophical concept of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava school, which was
founded by the Bengali saint Chaitanya
(d. 1533) and is devoted to the worship
of Krishna as the Supreme Being. The
concept was first enunciated by
Chaitanya’s disciple Jiva Goswami (late
[[16]]
th c.) and explains the relationship
between God (Krishna) and the human
soul, and between God and his divine
powers. In both cases these relation-
ships are described as simultaneously
involving sameness and difference. On
one hand, human souls are clearly dif-
ferent from God, as shown by their
imperfections and their susceptibility
to the action of karma, both of which
contrast with God’s utter transcen-
dence and perfection. Yet since it is
possible for human souls to gain ulti-
mate liberation (moksha) from the
action of karma, they must also share
some part of God’s nature, since liber-
ation would be impossible if human
souls were completely different. Even
though human souls partake in the
divine nature, their distinctness is
upheld even after liberation, when the
human soul does not merge with
Krishna but remains separate.
This same concept is used to
describe the second relationship,
between God and his divine powers.
The divine powers are often conceived
not just as attributes (e.g., the ability
to create, preserve, and destroy the
universe) but as actual embodied
deities, particularly in the form of
goddesses. These powers are both the
same as God, since they come from
Him, but also different since each of
the embodied powers does not con-
tain the glory of the whole. In both
cases the precise nature of this simul-
taneous identity and difference is
“inconceivable,” which here carries a
mystical sense. For further informa-
tion see Sushil Kumar De, Early History
of the Vaishnava Faith and Movement
in Bengal, from Sanskrit and Bengali
Sources, 1961.
Achyuta
(“imperishable”) Epithet of Vishnu,
referring to the devotees’ (bhakta)
beliefs that nothing can stand against
Vishnu and that his power will never
wane. Hindu deities often have many
names that sometimes denote unique
form of the deity and at other times
denote a special quality of the deity.
No two deities will ever share the same
epithet. The proliferation of names for
deities may be related in part to the
characteristics of the Sanskrit lan-
guage, which is rich with synonyms.
This allows words to fit into various
poetic meters. See Vishnu.
Act of Truth
In Hindu mythology, a ritual action that
is described as being able to neutralize
poison, bring rain, make a river flow
backward, or even compel the gods to
grant one’s wishes. The act of truth
draws its effectiveness from the power
of truth and is usually performed as a
last resort when all other avenues have
been blocked. The act of truth is a con-
ditional statement: the first part is a true
statement about one’s past behavior, the
second part a request for some specific
result (“If I have always given to those
who begged from me, may this fire not
[[5]]
Adharma
burn me”). The rite’s success stems from
the truthfulness of the first condition—
that the power of truth in the condition
actually causes the second part to come
true. One example of the act of truth
being used to compel the gods to grant a
wish occurs in the story of the lovers
Nala and Damayanti. Damayanti
intends to choose Nala as her husband
but finds that four of the gods have
taken Nala’s form, in an effort to foil her.
Damayanti’s act of truth affirms that she
had chosen Nala as her husband and
has never wavered in this choice, and it
then directs the gods to take their true
forms again. The gods take their true
forms, and Nala and Damayanti are
married.
As Sanskritist and Indologist W.
Norman Brown observes, in cases
where the act of truth is successful, the
people making the act of truth have
perfectly fulfilled their social roles,
and this perfection allows them to
make the conditional affirmation so
central to the act of truth. Successful
men have been either great kings,
ascetics, or householders; successful
women have usually been absolutely
faithful to their husbands (fulfilling
one idealized women’s role). One story
tells of a prostitute who affirmed that she
had serviced all of her clients without par-
tiality, thus perfectly fulfilling her particu-
lar social role. In any of these cases,
perfection of one’s role is believed to bring
spiritual merit as well as the ability to
unleash it by performing the act of truth.

Act,” in Mélanges D'Indianisme à la

Adharma
In the dharma literature, this term
designates the absolute opposite of
dharma, the fundamental values that
serve to uphold society. Although adhar-
ma can denote a particular unrighteous
action, it more widely implies a state of
affairs in which society has been com-
pletely corrupted; the values that
[[6]]

uphold society have been subverted,
overturned, or ignored and hence such
particular unrighteous actions become
possible, even likely.

Adhikara
(“qualification”) In any sort of Hindu
worship, but particularly in tantra,
adhikara indicates that one has the reli-
gious qualifications to perform certain
ritual actions. This refers partly to know-
ing how to perform the ritual, and thus
being “qualified” in that sense of the
word. More importantly, it refers to hav-
ing gained the ritual status that entitles
one to perform the ritual. This status is
usually conferred by some sort of formal
initiation or initiations given by one’s
teacher, who decides what type of and
how much adhikara to transmit based
on an assessment of the student’s abili-
ties, temperament, and desire to learn.
Adhiratha
The foster father of Karna in the great
Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Karna is
born when his mother, Kunti, uses a
special mantra given to her by the sage
Durvasas, which gives a woman the
power to conceive and bear children by
the gods. Kunti impulsively uses the
mantra to invoke the Sun, by whom she
conceives and bears Karna. In her panic
at unexpectedly becoming a mother—
she is still unmarried, and concerned
about what people might think—she
puts the child in a box and abandons him
in the Ganges. When Adhiratha goes to
the Ganges to bathe (snana), he finds the
child, and since he and his wife are child-
less, they raise the boy as their own.
There are a number of interesting
aspects to the story of Adhiratha.
Although he is not of high status, he
becomes the king of the country. He
comes from a social group whose tra-
ditional occupation is driving chariots.Adhyasa
The Shri Channakeshara temple in Somnathpur, India. A traditional feature of Hindu temple
architecture is the adhishthana, a raised base upon which the temple is built.
One can read this dissonance in the
epic’s recognition that the hierarchical,
occupationally based social model is an
idealized projection and not always the
reality. It can also be argued that since
Adhiratha is not fulfilling his particular
religious duty (dharma) but has
usurped that of the ruling class, both he
and the country are destined for ruin.
The reality of his family’s lowly status
and the uncertainty about his birth
trouble Karna for most of his life.
Adhishthana
(“foundation”) In Hindu temple archi-
tecture, the raised base on which a tem-
ple was built. These are particularly high
in the temples at Khajuraho, and their
height accentuates the upward thrust of
these temples. Whether high or low, the
adhishthana is important as the temple’s
foundation, the stable base on which all
else rests.
Adhvaryum
A type of sacrificial priest described in
the Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands of the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire—and the care and attention
devoted to detailing these sacrifices,
which leads to the inference that these
were the primary religious acts. These
rites were so complex that they
required specialized ritual techni-
cians: the adhvaryum, the hotr, the
udgatr, and the brahman. The
adhvaryum was the sacrificial priest
who chanted the hymns from the
Yajur Veda that were used in the sacri-
fice. He was also responsible for
preparing the sacred altar, assembling
the sacrificial materials, kindling and
feeding the sacred fire, and actually
offering the sacrificial animals.
Adhyasa
(“superimposition”) In Advaita Vedanta,
one of the six schools of classical Indian
philosophy, this is a key concept used to
explain the ultimate unreality of the
world around us, despite its apparent
[[7]]
Adi
reality. For the Advaita Vedanta school,
there is ultimately only one real idea in
the universe, namely Brahman. All
things are in fact that one thing, and this
never changes. Since Brahman is the
all in all, it can never actually be an
object of perception (pratyaksha). What
the Advaitins then have to explain
is how things in the world apparently
change, or seem diverse and different.
This is explained as stemming from
our mistaken perception and under-
standing. They call this notion
adhyasa, which is rooted in the human
tendency to “construct” a picture of
world. According to this explanation,
human beings superimpose a false
understanding (that reality is diverse
and differentiated) on top of the correct
understanding (that all reality is nothing
but
undifferentiated
Brahman).
According to the Advaitins, the world is
real because Brahman is real. What is
not real is the world as most unenlight-
ened people perceive it.
Advaitins illustrate this concept by
two well-known errors in judgment: the
case of a rope that one briefly mistakes
for a snake, or a post that one imagines
is a man. Although these judgments are
erroneous—as one quickly discovers—
they are not made up out of nothing. In
each case, one is perceiving something
real—the rope and post both actually
exist—but “superimposing” a different
and mistaken identity on these things,
and thus “transforming” them into
something they are not. In the same
way, it is argued, human consciousness
begins with the Supreme Reality
(Brahman), which is actually there, but
superimposes onto it something which
is not (the judgment of a diverse world).
According to the Advaitins, the real
problem is epistemological, that is, how
human beings come to know things,
rather than in the nature of the things
themselves. One comes to a true
understanding not when the things
themselves change—to refer back to the
example, the rope always was and
always will be a rope—but with the
destruction of the mistaken notions that
[[8]]

led to the initial error, and their
replacement by true understanding.
For the Advaitins, adhyasa is a
manifestation of avidya (lack of true
knowledge); this avidya is reinforced
and upheld by the karmic power of
one’s mistaken thoughts and actions.
Adhyasa immediately disappears at the
moment true understanding is gained,
when one comprehends that the world
(and oneself ) are both nothing but
Brahman. This moment of realization
brings ultimate wisdom that can never
be lost, just as that once one has
recognized the piece of rope, it can
never again become a snake. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara and
His Pupils, 1981; and Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore
(eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Adi
Fourth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Karkata (the zodiacal
sign of Cancer), which usually falls
within July and August. The existence of
several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Adigranth
(“Primal Book”) One of the names for
the Sikh scripture, most often used by
people outside the tradition. Sikhs
themselves are more likely to use the
honorific title Shri Guru Granth Sahib,
which reflects the scripture’s status as
the spiritual leader (guru) of the Sikh
community. This status was conferred
by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh
(d. 1708), who proclaimed that after hisAditi
death the community would have no
more human leaders, but only their
scripture to guide them. The book’s reli-
gious authority can be seen in the way
that the Sikhs treat it. They accord the
Adigranth the status of a living person.
In Sikh temples the Adigranth is cere-
monially put to bed at night and woken
up in the morning. It is enshrined under
a canopy (a sign of royalty) for worship,
is fanned during hot weather and
warmed during cold, and if it has to be
taken anywhere, is carried on the bear-
er’s head, considered the purest part of
the body. In according this respectful
treatment to a physical book, the Sikhs
were probably influenced by Muslim
practice with regard to the Qur’an, since
in general Hindus pay little heed to a
book itself, however important the text
may be.
The Adigranth plays a central role in
Sikh life: Children are named by opening
the book at random and taking the first
consonant on the upper-left-hand page
as the first letter of the child’s name; Sikh
couples are married by circling the
book, as Hindu couples circle the
sacred fire (agnipradakshinam), and a
commonly performed death rite is an
unbroken reading (akhand path) of the
entire text.
The text itself was compiled in
[[1603]]
–1604 by Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh
guru. According to tradition he com-
piled the book in response to certain
rivals contesting his authority, some of
whom had compiled and were circulat-
ing books purporting to be the teachings
of Guru Nanak, the Sikhs’ founder and
first guru. There may be some truth in
this tradition, but it is now well estab-
lished that Arjan himself was working
from a compilation made a generation
before. The text’s opening verses are
known as the mul mantra, which gives a
collection of attributes and qualities
ascribed to the Supreme Being. After
this opening, the Adigranth has
three main parts. The first is the Japji,
a sequence of thirty-eight poems
written by Guru Nanak that is
considered the essence of the Sikh faith,
and which is recited by the faithful as
the morning prayer.
The second section contains the
hymns of the Sikh gurus, arranged by
raga, or melodic mode. Within each raga
the hymns are arranged according to
poetic meter, and within each meter the
hymns are arranged sequentially accord-
ing to which of the gurus composed
them. Since the Sikh tradition holds that
all ten gurus contained the same divine
spirit, they all identified themselves as
“Nanak.” But introductions to the songs
differentiate between them by calling
them Mahala (literally “house,” but figu-
ratively “body”) followed by a number—
from Mahala 1 for Guru Nanak to Mahala
[[5]]
 for Guru Arjan.
The final section of the Adigranth
contains hymns by various other devo-
tees (bhakta), both Hindu and Muslim,
whom the Sikh gurus believed to
be propounding the essential Sikh
message of monotheism and the need
to serve God. Among the Hindu
devotional (bhakti) poets whose works
can be found in this section are
Trilochan, Jayadeva, Pipa, Ramananda,
Sen, Namdev, Kabir, and Ravidas, with
significant collections for the last three.
Even for those not interested in the
Sikhs, this last section makes the
Adigranth an extremely important
document. Not only does this section
provide manuscript tradition that can
be precisely and accurately dated, but
the sacred status of the text has ensured
that it has remained unchanged since
the beginning of the seventeenth cen-
tury. Many other manuscript sources
for these poets are far more recent and
are made problematic by textual cor-
ruption and pseudonymous additions.

Aditi
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
the sage Kashyapa, who also married
[[9]]
Aditya
Adivasi man going to the market. The Adivasis consist of different tribal groups that are
settled throughout the forest and hill regions of India.
Aditi’s twelve sisters and through them
begat all living creatures. Aditi is first
mentioned in the Rg Veda, where she is
one of the few female figures, although a
minor one. The epic Mahabharata
describes her as giving birth to twelve
divine sons, the Adityas: Dhata,
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (Indra), Varuna,
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (Surya),
Pushan, Savitr (Surya), Tvashtr, and
Vishnu. Both Hindu epics, the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, also
describe how Aditi gave birth to the
Vamana avatar, that is, the “divine
descent” of the god Vishnu, in his form
as a dwarf.
Aditya
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, a
group of twelve divine sons born to the
sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, from
whom these sons get their collective
name. The twelve are named Dhata,
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (Indra), Varuna,
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (Surya),
Pushan, Savitr, Tvashtr, and Vishnu.
Several of these deities are important
figures in the religious scriptures known
[[10]]

as the Vedas, and Vishnu later gained
prominence as one of the primary
Hindu gods. On one hand, the Adityas
illustrate the Hindu concept that the
divine beings (devas) have many simi-
larities to humans, although they are
more powerful and live in a different
world, the heavens. On the other hand,
they also demonstrate how the Hindu
tradition changes over time. Among the
Adityas, Vishnu is one of a number of
divine beings who are all subject to
birth, death, and the operation of
karma, whereas in his later aspect as the
Supreme Being, he is considered not
only to be beyond all these forces, but to
wield control over them.
The twelve Adityas are the sun in
the twelve months of the year. In at
least one of the Puranas these twelve
Adityas are each connected with a
particular sign of the zodiac.
Adivasi
(“first inhabitant”) General term for
different groups of tribal peoples.
They are usually associated with
forests and other less developedAdultery
areas, often making their living by
hunting, woodcutting, gathering
honey and medicinal plants, and
through subsistence agriculture. The
largest concentrations are in Orissa,
Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar, on both
sides of the Vindhya Mountains sep-
arating northern and southern India,
but they are also found in regions
such as the Nilgiri Hills in southern
India. Adivasis are still largely unas-
similated into caste Hinduism. Many
are illiterate and desperately poor,
despite programs giving them reser-
vations for higher education and gov-
ernment employment. In recent years
they have been the focus of intense
missionary activity by both Christians
and Hindu missionaries sponsored by
the Vishva Hindu Parishad.
Adoption
One of the most important requirements
for every Hindu male is to have at least
one son, so that the funeral rites for him-
self and for his ancestors will be correctly
performed and maintained. These rites
are considered central for the well-being
of the dead, particularly the recently
departed. Even in modern times, only
men are allowed to perform funeral rites.
Given the importance of these cere-
monies, men with no biological sons
adopt a son to guarantee the performance
of the ceremony. The ideal candidate is a
blood relative, such as a brother’s son, who
is of equal social status with the adoptive
father. Through adoption the boy
becomes a member of another family, but
the legal texts disagree on his continuing
relationship with his natal family. Many
sources claim that an adopted son has no
right to the inheritance of his natal family
and no entitlement to offer funeral rites
for those ancestors, since by adoption he
has become part of another family. Other
texts speak of special arrangements by
which an adopted son is considered to
have two fathers, one biological, one
adopted. He inherits from, and performs
ancestral rites for both fathers.
Adultery
Given the traditional Hindu belief that
women are the vessels and guardians of
family status, rules about adultery out-
lined in the dharma literature are
mostly concerned with the conduct of
women, although these texts do pre-
scribe a penance (prayashchitta) for a
man who commits adultery with
another man’s wife. As outlined in the
dharma literature, adultery is much
more serious for women. It is notable
that in most cases the dharma does not
recommend the woman be driven from
her home. An adulterous woman is to
perform a rigorous penance until her
next menstrual period—sleeping on the
ground, wearing dirty clothes, and get-
ting very little food; during this time she
also loses her status as a lady of the
house and whatever domestic authority
she may have wielded. According to the
dharma literature, all of this is to end
with a bath at the end of her menstrual
period, after which she is accepted back
at her former status. Women who con-
ceive as a result of adulterous liaisons
are to be abandoned. In practice this
often means being secluded and cut off
from the family, although she still
receives food. Abandonment is also rec-
ommended in certain other cases: in
adulterous liaisons with a man’s student
or his guru, if a woman attempts to kill
her husband, or if she kills her fetus. The
reluctance to completely cast a woman
away, and the willingness to bring her
back to her former status after doing
penance, both reflect the importance of
marriage and family life in Hindu cul-
ture, as well as women’s importance in
the family.
Although these prescriptions in the
dharma literature seem relatively
humane, often there has been a consid-
erable difference between these pre-
scriptions and a particular group’s
actual practice. In general, the higher
the group’s social status (or the more a
group is trying to improve its social sta-
tus), the more harshly it treats such
infractions, since these infractions
[[11]]
Advaita Vedanta
injure its social standing. At present this
disjunction is also affected by the differ-
ing attitudes toward sexuality between
rural and urban contexts, with the latter
tending to be more permissive and the
former far more restrictive. These differ-
ences are illustrated by occasional
reports of adulterous women being
killed to restore the family’s honor; this
far exceeds even the harshest penalty
prescribed in the dharma literature.
Advaita Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the Vedas.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality lies behind all things. Advaita
proponents believe that reality is non-
dual (advaita)—that is, that everything
in the world is actually the formless,
unqualified Brahman, despite the
appearance of difference and diversity.
To support this claim, the Advaitins pro-
vide a convincing explanation for the
world one perceives to have many sepa-
rate and diverse things.
Advaitans account for this apparent
diversity by using the concept of
adhyasa (superimposition), in which a
false, mistaken understanding is pro-
jected upon a real object—in the classi-
cal Advaita example, seeing a rope in the
twilight and mistaking it for a snake. For
the Advaitins, the “snake” is not com-
pletely unreal, since it depends on the
rope for its existence—one cannot see
the snake unless the rope is there. At the
same time, the “snake” is clearly not real
since one does not persist in this error,
and once the illusion of the snake has
been dispelled, one can no longer see it.
In the same way, the Advaitins
believe that our idea of the phenomenal
everyday world is projected upon the
one thing in the universe that is truly
real—Brahman. Like the snake, the
world is unreal as it is perceived but real
insofar as it depends on Brahman. For
[[12]]

the Advaitins, the roots of adhyasa are
epistemological, that is, related to how
human beings come to know things, but
the results of adhyasa are both epistemo-
logical and ontological (related to how
things actually are). On one hand,
adhyasa obscures the Ultimate Reality
and prevents one from accurately per-
ceiving it, and on the other, its projective
character creates our notions of the
world. For the Advaitins, the source of all
this confusion is ultimately rooted in
avidya, or primal ignorance, under the
influence of which one forms mistaken
ideas about the world. The operation of
this ignorance is said to have no begin-
ning, but one of the things that keeps it
going is one’s karma, based on the con-
tinuing actions caused by this mistaken
understanding. Another source of this
ignorance is the power of illusion (maya)
wielded by God (Ishvara), which bewil-
ders human beings. For the Advaita
Vedantin, God is identified as a qualified
(saguna) form of Brahman—thus below
the highest unqualified (nirguna)
Brahman, and himself a product of
superimposition.
Since the Advaita school believes that
the source of bondage to karma results
from mistaken understanding, the only
way to destroy bondage is to gain the cor-
rect understanding. Although the
Advaitans say that people must perform
obligatory religious actions (nitya
karma) as a matter of duty, actions can
never bring about the understanding that
is necessary for salvation, although they
may aid the process by removing some of
the karmic obstacles. To support this
understanding, the Advaitins begin their
analysis with an appeal to the knowing
subject as the one thing that can never be
doubted, and claim that this self-con-
sciousness is evidence for the existence
of the inner Self, or atman. Aside from
this appeal to experience, they depend
heavily on the authority of the sacred
texts, particularly the Upanishads, to
uphold their key doctrines: that Brahman
is the source of all things; that the human
soul is ultimately identical to Brahman,
although hampered by obstructionsAgastya
based on past karma; and that gaining
true knowledge is the basis of liberation.
The first and greatest Advaita thinker
was the philosopher Shankaracharya;
other significant figures were his two dis-
ciples, Sureshvara and Padmapada, as
well as Mandana Mishra and Vachaspati
Mishra. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to
Samkara and His Pupils, 1981; and

A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Advani, Lal Krishna
(b. 1927) Modern Indian politician as well
as past president and leader of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a party
often considered the political wing of the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Advani joined the RSS as a young man and
was encouraged by the RSS to become
active in politics, first in the Jana Sangh
and later in the BJP. In the fall of 1990,
Advani embarked on a tour of northern
India to raise public support for building
a Rama temple in Ayodhya, on a site
which at the time was occupied by a
Muslim mosque. The public response to
this rath yatra (“chariot journey”) was
positive and brought great political bene-
fits to the BJP; the BJP has since run the
state governments in some of India’s
most important states and has become
the largest opposition party in
Parliament. During the 1990s the BJP’s
influence waxed and waned, but for
much of this time, Advani has been one of
the leading figures in the party. In the
spring of 1996, however, he was one of
many Indian political figures whose name
was connected with a major bribery scan-
dal. He immediately resigned his seat in
Parliament and promised that he would
not seek office until his name had been
cleared. The allegation was found to be
completely baseless, and Advani was
reelected to Parliament in March, 1998.
During the thirteen months of BJP govern-
ment rule in 1998–99, Advani served as
Home Minister (the Cabinet officer
responsible for all domestic affairs) and
has continued in this position during the
BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.
Aerial Cars
One of the standard images in Hindu
mythology. The most famous of the
cars is the Pushpak Viman, which is
originally owned by Kubera, a minor
deity associated with mountains and
their mineral wealth. The Pushpak Viman
is commandeered and stolen by Ravana,
the demon-king of Lanka. In modern
times, mythological references to
such aerial cars are often cited as
evidence that ancient Indians possessed
the technology for flying machines,
an assertion for which there is no
historical evidence.
Aesthetics
See Rasa.
Agama
In its most general meaning, this refers
to any authoritative text. In a philo-
sophical context, this word designates
one of the pramanas, the means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge. As a pramana, the
agama denotes testimony from a reli-
able source, particularly from scrip-
tures such as the Veda. Within specific
sectarian communities, such as the
devotees (bhakta) of the gods Shiva
(Shaivas) and Vishnu (Vaishnavas), the
word also commonly designates the
particular texts deemed most authori-
tative by that community.
Agastya
In Hindu mythology, Agastya is one of
the rishis (sages) of ancient India and
is attributed with various supernormal
powers. As with many of the rishis,
Agastya is marked as different even by
his birth, which is far outside the nor-
mal manner. According to the story,
Agastya is conceived when the semen
of the deities Mitra and Varuna is
placed in a pot and develops there into
[[13]]
Aghori
a baby boy. Agastya is described as pre-
ferring a detached, ascetic lifestyle, but
he compromises in deference to his
ancestors. The ancestors appear
to Agastya in a vision, imploring him
to marry and have children, so that
his sons can continue performing the
ancestral offerings; this is one of the
three debts that every Hindu man
must pay. Agastya consents and
marries Lopamudra.
Agastya’s ascetic lifestyle is said to
have generated immense powers,
which he demonstrates by performing
many marvelous deeds. According to
some accounts, he curses king
Nahusha to become a giant serpent, in
retribution for the insults Nahusha has
heaped upon him. Agastya also curses
King Indradyumna to become an ele-
phant, and the gandharva named
Huhu to become a crocodile; the two
are released many years later through
the god Vishnu’s divine grace.
Not all of his exploits stem from his
readiness to curse—a trait found in
many of the sages—and some are per-
formed for the benefit of human
beings. He is reported to have humbled
the Vindhya Mountains (here personi-
fied), which through envy of Mount
Meru have grown so tall that the sun
and moon are unable to get around
them. Agastya does this by asking
Vindhya to bow down to let him get
through on his journey to southern
India. Agastya promises that Vindhya
can stand up again when he returns,
which has yet to happen. In other cases
Agastya is reported to have used his
powers to help get rid of demons. On
one occasion, when a group of demons
is hiding in the sea by day and coming
out to pillage at night, Agastya exposes
them by drinking up the ocean and thus
taking away their place of refuge. On
another occasion he foils a demon who
has been taking the form of a goat to be
cooked and eaten by unsuspecting din-
ers. The demon has been killing the din-
ers by exploding out of their stomachs.
Agastya eats the demon as usual, but it is
then completely destroyed by Agastya’s
[[14]]

prodigious digestive powers. See also
Gajendramoksha.
Aghori
In one context this term refers to one of
the two loosely organized groups of the
Jogi ascetics, the other being the
Nathpanthis. There are three major
groups of ascetics devoted to the god
Shiva; they are the Aghoris, Nathpanthis,
and Dashanami Sanyasis. The difference
between these is that the Dashanamis are
said to have been founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, while the
Aghoris and Nathpanthis are believed to
be descended from earlier Shaiva ascetic
orders, particularly the Kapalikas,
Kalamukhas, and Pashupatas. The term
aghori also refers to ascetics whose
reputed practices make them both
respected and feared by the general pop-
ulation. The Aghoris draw their name
from one of the names of the god Shiva,
Aghora, which despite its literal meaning
(“not terrifying”), designates one of the
most frightful and powerful forms of
Shiva. As devotees (bhakta) of this form
of Shiva, the Aghoris are famous for their
disregard of all social conventions and
boundaries. They often eat from a vessel
made of a human skull and are popularly
reputed to eat anything, including dung
and human flesh. Such behavior gener-
ates fascination and sometimes respect
among the larger Hindu populace, but
also considerable fear; Aghoris are so far
outside the normal social boundaries
that most people would rather avoid
interaction with them.
Agni
(“fire,” cognate with Latin ignis) Hindu
deity present in every fire. Agni is also
one of the eight dikpalas, or Guardians
of the Directions, with responsibility for
the southeast quarter. As fire, Agni is
also one of the five elements in classical
Hindu cosmology.
Agni is important in the samhitas
(hymns) of the Rg Veda and in the
Brahmanas, a later strand of Vedic liter-Agni Akhara
Ceremonies often have a part in which
offerings (often of clarified butter) are
ladled into a sacrificial fire. Fire plays an
important role in many rituals, particu-
larly that of arati, in which lamps are
waved before the image of a divinity as
an offering of light. Agni also serves as
the divine witness to the single action
widely believed to seal a marriage. This
is agnipradakshinam, in which the
bride and groom make seven revolu-
tions around a lamp or fire. Even on the
most prosaic level, fire is still essential to
daily life since most Indians continue to
cook over an open flame—whether coal,
wood, dung, or bottled gas. This every-
day utility, combined with his abiding
ritual presence, have assured Agni a
continuing presence in Hindu life.

ature emphasizing sacrificial rites. The
Rg Veda opens with a hymn to Agni and
describes him as “the household priest,
the god and officiant of the sacrifice,
[and]. . .the giver of blessings.” Agni
remained important in the Brahmanas
since, as the sacrificial fire, he was
essential to all ritual. Agni’s importance
in these texts stems from his presence in
all three levels of the Vedic universe—on
the earth as fire, in the middle atmos-
pheric realm (antariksha) as lightning,
and in the sky as the sun. This ability to
move between these levels made Agni
the intermediary between the gods and
human beings. From above, Agni served
as the messenger of the gods, while as
the sacrificial fire on earth, Agni not only
consumed the offerings but conveyed
them in the smoke to the gods above.
Because of his role in bringing about the
sacrifice, another epithet for Agni is the
“mouth of the gods.”
Unlike many of the other Vedic
deities, Agni has retained a certain
prominence even in the present day.
Although Vedic sacrifices are uncom-
mon, sacrificial motifs have been incor-
porated into many contemporary rites.
Agni Akhara
The name of a particular subgroup of
the Naga class of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, a particular type of renunciant
ascetic. The Dashanami Nagas are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, orga-
nized into different akharas or
regiments on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers, although
they also had substantial trading inter-
ests; both of these occupations have
largely disappeared in contemporary
times. The Agni akhara is a subunit of
the Juna akhara, one of the largest and
oldest of the Naga akharas.
The Agni akhara’s membership is
very different from that of the other
established akharas. Whereas the other
Naga Sanyasi akharas will accept men
from all levels of society—in some cases
even the lowest status group, the shu-
dras—the Agni akhara admits only
unmarried brahmins who have been
lifelong celibates. Perhaps as a conse-
quence of their more exclusive member-
ship criteria, the Agni akhara is the only
Dashanami Naga akhara that has no
naked (naga) ascetics. All of its members
remain fully clothed during the proces-
sion for their bath at the Kumbha Mela.
[[15]]
Agnihotra
The Agni akhara was first established in
Benares, and this remains their most
important site. All of the akharas have
particular features that define their
organizational identity, including
specific patron deities; the Agni akhara’s
patron deity is the goddess Gayatri,
considered the embodiment of the
Gayatri Mantra.
Agnihotra
(“fire sacrifice”) Religious rite in
which offerings are made to the
sacred fire, considered to be the god
Agni in material form. The term can
also refer to the maintenance and care
of the sacred fire itself. The roots of
worship based on a sacrificial fire go
back to the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu sacred texts. This
type of worship is still present in mod-
ern times, although much diminished
in emphasis.
Agnikula
(“fire lineage”) A collective name for
the four main clans of Rajputs
(warrior princes): the Pariharas,
Chauhans, Solankis, and Pawars.
According to tradition, this collective
name refers to the Rajputs’ descent
from
a
single
mythical
king
who had arisen from a sacrificial fire
pit at Mount Abu in the state
of
Rajasthan.
Although
their
historical origin is unclear, these
four clans ruled over much of
northwestern
India,
either
as
independent kings or feudal vassals,
after their appearance at the end
of the first millennium. The Pariharas
ruled southern Rajasthan. The
Chauhans ruled the region around
Delhi. The Solankis ruled in Gujarat.
The Pawars ruled in western Madhya
Pradesh. Although their days as
warrior princes have passed, they
remain influential in politics, both
as politicians and as constituent
communities.
[[16]]

Agnipradakshinam
(“circling the fire”) A common rite in
many modern Hindu marriage cere-
monies, usually performed as part of
the saptapadi, in which the bride and
groom take seven steps to definitively
seal their marriage. The saptapadi and
the agnipradakshinam are combined so
that the bride and groom make seven
revolutions around a small fire. As the
god Agni, the fire is the divine witness to
the marriage bond between bride and
groom, a bond often symbolized by
tying the end of the groom’s turban to
the fringe of the bride’s sari. The fire is
also a sign that the celebration of mar-
riage is a yajna, or sacrificial rite.
Agnipravesha
(“entering fire”) Death by fire, which
could occur in several different contexts.
This was often used to refer to the
practice of sati, in which a widow would
be burned on her husband’s funeral pyre.
Death by fire was also one of the man-
dated forms of religious suicide; this
could be done either as a means of relief
for someone afflicted by an incurable
disease, or as part of certain rites of
sacrifice such as the sarvasvara, which
was performed to send the sacrificer
to heaven. By the beginning of the
eighteenth century, religious suicide had
been condemned and had fallen into
disuse. In the nineteenth century, British
horror at the practice of sati led them to
ban it wherever they were able to do so.
Agnishtoma
Particular rite of sacrifice prescribed
in the later strands of the Vedas, the
earliest Hindu sacred texts. The
agnishtoma was most often performed
in the early spring and was dedicated
to the Vedic god Agni (fire). The rite’s
two central elements were the press-
ing and consumption of the mysteri-
ous sacrificial drink called soma (seen
as a material form of the Vedic god
Soma), and the slaughter of sacrificial
animals, which were burned on theAhamkar
sacrificial fire (the god Agni in material
form). A final chant during the sacrifice
was addressed to Agni. During the
Vedic period, this rite became largely
the province of kings since they were
the only people who could command
the necessary resources for it. With the
later reaction against animal sacrifice,
the rite fell out of favor, although it is
still performed occasionally in a modi-
fied fashion without sacrifice.
Agrahara
A brahmin residential enclave, usually
established by a land grant from a
wealthy land owner or royalty to a par-
ticular brahmin. Brahmins had the
highest status in traditional Hindu
society, based on the belief that they
had higher ritual purity. The purpose
of the agrahara was to protect this rit-
ual purity since it could be compro-
mised fairly easily. Agraharas were
most common in southern India,
where brahmins formed an extremely
small percentage of the general popu-
lation—on average, about four per-
cent. As a small minority, southern
Indian brahmins could maintain a
more controlled environment, thereby
reducing the possibility of having their
purity tainted. In northern India,
brahmins formed a significant part of
the population and tended to live
within the towns and cities, although
they often inhabited particular sec-
tions of these places.
Ahalya
In Hindu mythology, Ahalya is the wife
of the sage Gautama. She is turned into
stone by Gautama’s curse and later
restored to life by being touched by the
foot of the god Rama. Gautama’s curse is
brought on by the actions of the god
Indra, who lusts for Ahalya. One day,
when Gautama has gone to the river to
bathe (snana), Indra takes Gautama’s
form and goes to Ahalya in a bid to make
love to her. Accounts differ on whether
Ahalya is aware of her lover’s identity—in
some she is flattered by Indra’s attention,
in others she is genuinely deceived.
When Gautama discovers what has hap-
pened, he curses Ahalya to become a
stone and Indra to have a thousand vagi-
nas on his body, as a punishment for his
lust. Gautama is later mollified into mod-
ifying the curses, so that Ahalya will
remain a stone until she is touched by
Rama’s foot, and Indra will be covered
instead with a thousand eyes. This story
primarily illustrates the power of the
sages to curse even the gods, but the dif-
ferent versions also reveal varying
assumptions about the nature of women.
Aham Brahmasmi
(“I am Brahman.”) In the Hindu philo-
sophical tradition, this is one of the four
“great
utterances”
(mahavakyas)
expressing an ultimate truth. The
truth expressed in this utterance is the
idea that atman (the individual Self )
and Brahman (Ultimate Reality) are
one and the same—identical; this
truth is at the heart of the speculative
texts called the Upanishads. The four
mahavakyas, aside from their philo-
sophical importance as capsulizing
fundamental truths, were also appro-
priated by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics as iden-
tifying symbols. Each division had a
different mahavakya, just as each had
a different Veda, a different primary
sacred center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Aham
Brahmasmi is the mahavakya associat-
ed with the Bhuriwara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.
Ahamkar
(“I-making”) In the Samkhya school of
Hindu philosophy, ahamkar is one of
the stages in the evolution of prakrti
(primal matter) away from its initial
undifferentiated unity toward differen-
tiation of the Self and other things.
The final result of this degradation
is the world that we see around us,
in which human souls are subject to
[[17]]
Ahimsa

reincarnation (samsara). Prakrti evolves
first into mahat (“the great one”) and
then into ahamkar, which is the
first stage in which there is a sense
of
self
and
subjectivity.
This
sense of subjectivity colors the entire
devolution after that. Ahamkar
then evolves further, forming the
basis for both the subjective and
objectice world: on one hand, the
individual’s
organs
of
sense
(jnanendriya) and organs of action
(karmendriya) develop, and on the
other
hand,
the
five
subtle
elements (tanmatras), which are
the basis of the gross material
elements, evolve. In colloquial speech,
ahamkar is used to mean “self-pride,”
invariably in a pejorative sense.
Ahimsa
(“refraining from harm”) Ahimsa refers
to the conscious commitment to
refrain from harming other living
beings, either directly or indirectly. The
emphasis on ahimsa originated with
the Jains, for whom all actions carry
karmic consequences, but who also
believe that the karmic consequences
[[18]]

generated by intentional evil acts are
far more severe than those from unin-
tentional ones. Jain and Buddhist com-
mitment to ahimsa brought it further
into Indian society, and it has been an
important feature of Hindu practice for
well over two thousand years. In the
Yoga Sutras, Patanjali mentions ahim-
sa as one of the restraints (yama) and
thus recommends it as one of the basic
foundations for religious life. This
commitment to ahimsa is believed to
be one of the major forces responsible
for the decline of animal sacrifice,
which was one of the most important
types of religious practice as described
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scrip-
tures. Far more recently, in the twenti-
eth century, ahimsa was one of the
guiding principles of Mohandas
Gandhi during the struggle for Indian
independence. Although Gandhi did
not rule out the use of violence in prin-
ciple, his commitment to ahimsa
reflected his judgment that means and
ends are karmically linked, and that
the means one employs will determine
both the nature and tone of one’s ends.

Ahir
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (birth). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status largely determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group had a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Ahiras were
a jati whose hereditary occupation was
herding and selling milk.
Aihole
Historical site in the state of Karnataka,
just south of the modern city of Bijapur.
Aihole was an important city during the
Chalukya dynasty (4th–8th c. C.E.), and its
surviving buildings are some of the oldest
standing Hindu temples. These temples
represent an early stage in the evolution of
Hindu architecture from earlier architec-
tural forms, such as the rock-cut cave tem-
ple (chaitya) or enclosed courtyard
(vihara). One of the earliest temples (ca.
[[450]]
 C.E.) is a simple square pavilion (man-
dapa) with a tower (shikhara) over the
main image of the deity, one of the hall-
marks of later Hindu temples. A temple to
Durga built about a century later has the
general plan of a chaitya, but a shikhara
was also added. Although the temples at
Aihole are related to the earlier forms, they
also prefigure the mature development of
medieval Hindu architecture.
Aims of Life
(purushartha) Four general goals that
Hindu society has accepted as legitimate
ends for all human beings: artha (wealth
and power), kama (desire, especially sex-
ual desire), dharma (righteousness or
religious duty), and moksha (final libera-
tion of the soul from the cycle of reincar-
nation). Hindus have affirmed that all of
these are worthy ends, but have generally
accepted that the last goal is qualitatively
different from the other three, which are
more strongly interrelated. There is noth-
ing wrong with seeking money or plea-
sure, and Hindu culture affirms both of
these aims with the understanding that
their pursuit and enjoyment should
ultimately be regulated by a commitment
to dharma. Although there are paths to
moksha that allow one to remain in the
world, it is generally accepted that a per-
son pursuing moksha will be less atten-
tive to worldly desires because they are
incompatible with this ultimate goal.
Aippasi
Seventh month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Tula (the zodiacal sign
of Libra), which according to the Indian
calendar usually falls within October and
November. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the con-
tinuing importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradition.
See also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Airavata
In Hindu mythology, the divine ele-
phant who is the vehicle of Indra, king
of the gods. The only significant role
Airavata plays in any myth is as the ulti-
mate cause for why the gods have to
churn the Ocean of Milk. One day the
powerful and irascible sage Durvasas
gives a garland to Indra. Indra places the
garland on Airavata, who throws it on
the ground. The reasons for this differ—
in one account Airavata is plagued by
the bees gathering on it, and in another
he is intoxicated by the scent of the flow-
ers. Durvasas understands this as an
insult and, in his anger, curses the gods
to be subject to old age and death. The
only way the gods can escape the effects
of the curse is to obtain the nectar of
immortality, which is done by churning
the Ocean of Milk. See also Tortoise avatar.
Aiteraya Brahmana
Along with the Shatapatha Brahmana,
the two most important texts in the
[[19]]
Aiyanar
Aiyappa
A shrine to Aiyanar, a regional deity in southern
India who is the protector of villages.
Brahmana stratum of Vedic literature.
The Brahmanas are primarily manuals
describing the correct performance of
Vedic ritual sacrifices. Because they were
composed later than the actual Vedas,
each Brahmana is connected in theory
with one of the Vedas, to give it authority
as a sacred Vedic text. According to tradi-
tion, the Aiteraya Brahmana is associated
with the earliest of the Vedas, the Rg Veda.
Aiyanar
Southern Indian regional deity. In the state
of Tamil Nadu Aiyanar is an important vil-
lage deity, generally considered to be the
guardian of the village tank, bringer of rain,
and protector of the village. It is likely that
he is an indigenous deity who has been
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon.
Aiyanar is sometimes identified with
Aiyappa, although there are some discrep-
ancies between the two—Aiyanar is a deity
associated with the protection of villages,
whereas Aiyappa is associated with the
hills, the jungle, and the hunt. For further
information see Louis Dumont, “A Folk
Deity of Tamil Nad: Aiyanar, the Lord,” in T.
N. Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
[[20]]

Hilltop deity of the southern Indian
state of Kerala, who at the local level is
often identified with Aiyanar, the Tamil
village deity. The most important of
Aiyappa’s shrines is at Shabari Malai in
the hills of central Kerala, to which there
is an important pilgrimage each winter
in December and January. Aiyappa’s
strong associations with the hills and
the hunt make it likely that he was origi-
nally a local deity of the hills of Kerala,
but in more recent times he has been
assimilated into the larger Hindu pan-
theon as the son of Shiva and Vishnu.
Although both of these gods are male,
Aiyappa’s conception is said to happen
when Vishnu takes the form of the
female enchantress Mohini, to beguile
the demons into parting with the
nectar of immortality. Because of his
parentage, Aiyappa is also called
Hariharaputra, “the son (putra) of Hari
(Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).”
Due to his unusual conception,
Aiyappa is fated to kill a particularly
troubling buffalo demoness, Mahishi,
who has been given the boon that she
cannot be killed by anyone born from
the union of male and female. After his
birth the infant Aiyappa is abandoned
by a riverbank, and adopted by King
Rajashekhara, who names him
Manikanta. Manikanta’s stepmother is
very jealous of her stepson and wishes
to clear the path to the throne for her
own child. When Manikanta is twelve his
stepmother feigns an illness that she
says only tiger’s milk can cure. Everyone
is understandably reluctant to try to get
the tiger’s milk, but Manikanta finally
agrees to do so.
On his way to get the tiger’s milk,
Manikanta is met by messengers of
Shiva, who remind him that his life’s
ultimate purpose is to kill Mahishi. After
a long struggle, Manikanta dispatches
the demon, but while he is dancing on
the she-buffalo’s body, another female
figure rises out of it. She identifies her-
self as Lila, and wants to marry
Manikanta, but as a celibate student he
does not desire this. He appeases LilaAjatashatru
with the conditional vow that he will
marry her the year that a celibate pil-
grim does not come to visit him on
Shabari Malai—a vow that will never
come true since celibacy is the single
most important requirement for the
Shabari Malai pilgrimage. Manikanta
then placates Lila by establishing a tem-
ple for her on a neighboring hilltop.
Returning to his original task of
retrieving the tiger’s milk, Aiyappa then
bids Shiva to take the form of a tiger,
upon which he rides back to his steppar-
ents, inviting them to milk the tiger to
their heart’s content. This image of the
young boy returning astride the tiger is
one of the most common Aiyappa
images. For further information see

Aja Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). As are all of the
eleventh-day observances, this is ded-
icated to the worship of Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. The most important
requirement for this festival is to pass
the night in worship; taking part is
believed to free one from all evil. The
name Aja means “unborn” and is one
of the epithets of Vishnu.
Ajamila
In Hindu mythology Ajamila is an exam-
ple of a completely corrupted sinner,
who is saved from Death by the bound-
less power of God’s grace. Ajamila is a
fallen brahmin who does all the things
forbidden to brahmins—he eats meat,
drinks liquor, takes a low caste woman as
his mistress, and ignores all the purity
laws which brahmins are supposed to
keep. His only redeeming feature is his
love for his son Narayana, which is also
one of the names of Vishnu. As he lies
dying, Ajamila sees the minions of Death
coming for him, whose terrible forms
portend a dire fate. In his terror at this
vision and his longing for his son, Ajamila
calls out “Narayana” with his dying
breath, and because of this Vishnu sends
his minions to rescue Ajamila. Ajamila is
brought to Vaikuntha, Vishnu’s dwelling
place, where he lives happily.
Ajatashatru
(“[he whose] enemy is unborn,” 5th c.
B.C.E.) King in the Magadha region in the
modern state of Bihar. Ajatashatru
deposed and murdered his father,
Bimbisara, around 494 B.C.E., then
expanded his father’s territorial gains.
Ajatashatru first annexed the area
around the city of Benares and then
conquered the city of Vaishali, capital of
the kingdom of the Vrjjis. Ajatashatru
and his father both aimed at building an
empire in the Ganges River basin, and
they were among the first Indian kings
to conceive of a far-flung empire.
Ajatashatru
(2) In the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, a
great sage who was also the king of
Benares. Ajatashatru is notable for
instructing Gargya, a brahmin priest, on
the nature of Brahman, even though this
was inappropriate by contemporary
standards since Ajatashatru was a ksha-
triya warrior king and thus should have
been receiving instruction from Gargya.
The Upanishads have several episodes in
which, contrary to the norm, kshatriyas
instruct brahmins. Such episodes reveal
the nature of wisdom as conceived in the
Upanishads—it is achieved by individual
striving and realization and not con-
ferred by birth or social position.
[[21]]
Ajita Keshakambalin
Ajita KeshakambalinAjna Chakra
In classical Indian philosophy, the
reputed founder of a materialist
philosophical school and whose name
reflects his usual garb—a hair blanket
(kesha-kambal). Ajita was a contem-
porary of the Buddha, and informa-
tion about him comes from the
Buddhist scriptures. Ajita’s materialist
philosophy was that human beings are
composed of four elements, that these
elements disperse after death, and
that the individual then ceases to
exist. Given this philosophy, Ajita
believed that one should enjoy life
while one could, taking pleasure in the
good and accepting the bad, and that
all religious observances were a waste
of time and a futile hope. Ajita was the
first in a long tradition of materialists,
and one finds evidence of this materi-
alist perspective as late as the eighth
century of the common era.In many schools of yoga and in the esoteric
ritual tradition known as tantra, the ajna
chakra is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) thought to be in the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate physiologi-
cal system, believed to exist on a different
plane of existence than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the mate-
rial body. The subtle body is comprised of
a set of six chakras, which are visualized as
multipetaled lotus flowers running rough-
ly along the course of the spine, connected
by three vertical channels. Each chakra has
important symbolic associations—with
differing human capacities, different sub-
tle elements (tanmatras), and different
seed syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sound. Above and
below the chakras are the bodily abodes of
Shiva (awareness) and Shakti (power), the
two divine principles through which the
entire universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this con-
cept of the subtle body is thus the homolo-
gy of macrocosm and microcosm, an
essential Hindu idea since the time of the
mystical texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated from the bottom up, and the
ajna chakra is the sixth and highest of
these. It is visualized as a two-petaled
lotus located in the forehead just above
the top of the nose. Its petals contain the
bijaksharas Ham and Ksam, formed
from the last two letters of the Sanskrit
alphabet. The ajna chakra is associated
with the capacity for thought, consid-
ered a distinctively human capacity and
thus the most important human faculty.

Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and
Shakta, 1978; and Philip S. Rawson, The
Art of Tantra, 1973.
Ajivika
Ancient philosophical school tradi-
tionally believed to have been founded
by Gosala Maskariputra, a contempo-
rary of the Buddha. The Ajivikas were
fatalists who believed that all things
are inexorably predetermined by des-
tiny (niyati). Since, according to this
philosophy, all things are preor-
dained, religious practice has no effect
on one’s future lives, and in doing such
things people are only doing what they
are already predetermined to do. The
Ajivikas compared the process of rein-
carnation (samsara) to a ball of string,
which would unroll until it was done
and then go no further. The Ajivikas
shunned clothing and lived a strict
ascetic lifestyle, believing that this was
the lifestyle preordained for them. The
school had a significant presence in
southern India well into the common
era but finally disappeared around the
fourteenth century. For further infor-
mation see Arthur Llewellyn Basham,
History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas, a
Vanished Indian Religion, 1981.

Akasha
(“space”) One of the five elements in
traditional Indian cosmology, the oth-
ers being earth, fire, water, and wind. In
some philosophical schools, each of theAkhara

elements is paired with one of the five
senses; akasha is associated with hear-
ing since it is believed to convey sound
from place to place.
Akbar
(r. 1555–1605) Third and greatest ruler in
the Moghul dynasty, a Muslim dynasty
that controlled large parts of India
between 1525 and 1707, existing in
reduced form until 1857. Akbar’s long
reign was marked by generally good
relations with his Hindu subjects, many
of whom were put into positions of
authority and for whom he seems to
have had genuine sympathy and under-
standing. One of his most important
gestures was to repeal a poll tax on non-
Muslims, which had been customary
but was highly unpopular among
Hindus. Although more orthodox
Muslims insinuated that Akbar was a
closet Hindu, the goodwill and coopera-
tion that he fostered helped keep things
peaceful throughout his reign.
Akhand Path
(“unbroken recitation”) The unbroken
recitation of an entire religious text,
which is believed to bring religious ben-
efits; individuals may perform such
recitations for their own benefit, or they
may hire another person to perform the
recitation for them. The benefits of this
action are believed to come from the
perceived power of the sacred text itself.
The recitation may be done as a pious
act, simply for the merit in sponsoring
it, or as part of a festival observance; it
may also be a last resort in times of dire
emergencies or a religious act per-
formed after a death in the family. One
of the texts often recited without a break
is the Ramcharitmanas, a retelling of
the Ramayana by the sixteenth-century
poet-saint Tulsidas; in the Sikh com-
munity, the Adigranth is recited.
Akhara
In its most basic meaning, an akhara
is a “wrestling ground,” a place in the
village or city where young men come
to train, tone, and compete. Such
practices at an akhara are not merely
physical exercise but also a form of
religious practice, since wrestlers
often begin by worshiping Hanuman,
a deity associated with strength and
power. Among the Naga class of the
[[23]]
Akhyati
Dashanami Sanyasis, the word
akhara means something closer to
“regiment.” The Dashanami Nagas
were ascetics devoted to the god
Shiva and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary sol-
diers. These Nagas were organized
into different akharas based on the
model of an army, and here the word
primarily marks group affiliation,
although it can also refer to the build-
ings in which the group lives. The Nagas
are divided into seven main akharas—the
Juna or Bhairava, Agni, Avahana,
Niranjani, Ananda, Mahanirvani, and
Atala. Among the Bairagi Naga
ascetics—militant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu—
the largest division of forces is into anis
(“armies”), which are then subdivided
into akharas.
Akhyati
(“nondiscrimination”) Theory of error
propounded by Prabhakara, a member of
the Purva Mimamsa philosophical
school, who lived in the seventh or eighth
century C.E. All the theories of error aim to
explain why people make errors in judg-
ment, such as the stock example of mis-
taking the silvery flash of a seashell for a
piece of silver. Prabhakara explains this
error as rooted in the inability to make
sharp distinctions. The person uncritically
connects two simple judgments, “that
object is silvery” and “silver is silvery.” By
themselves, both of these statements are
true; what is false is their combination into
the complex judgment, “that object is sil-
ver.” According to Prabhakara, the prob-
lem lies not with the simple impressions
given by perception (pratyaksha) or
memory—both of which are true—but
with their uncritical connection, in which
the mind fails to recognize that other
judgments are possible. For further infor-
mation see Bijayananda Kar, The Theories
of Error in Indian Philosophy, 1978; and
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.

Akkadevi
Sister of King Jayasimha II (1015–1042
C.E.), a monarch in the Chalukya
dynasty that ruled large parts of the
Deccan peninsula. Akkadevi was impor-
tant not only through her family con-
nections but also because she served as
a provincial governor in her brother’s
kingdom. Her example shows that
women in powerful families have often
been able to overcome the seeming
social disadvantages imposed by their
gender, a maxim proven most recently
by Sonia Gandhi.
Akrura
In Hindu mythology Akrura is most
famous as the envoy from the royal
court at Mathura, who takes the god
Krishna away from Krishna’s childhood
home in Braj, never to return. Krishna’s
wicked uncle, King Kamsa, instructs
Akrura to lure Krishna and his brother
Balarama to a festival, where they will
be killed in a “friendly” bout with some
wrestlers. Akrura sees through the plot
and warns Krishna about it, but he
remains indelibly associated with
Krishna’s departure from Braj, which for
his devotees (bhakta) is the bitterest
moment in all of Krishna’s mythology.
For a moving, dramatic account of this
incident, see John Stratton Hawley, At
Play with Krishna, 1981.
Akshakumara
In the Hindu epic the Ramayana, this
is one of the sons of Ravana by his wife
Mandodari. Akshakumara fights
bravely and valiantly in the war
against Rama’s army but is eventually
killed by Rama’s servant, the monkey-
deity, Hanuman.
Akshamala
A string of beads used to keep count
when reciting prayers or mantras,
sometimes translated by the accessi-
ble but misleading term “rosary.” An
akshamala is one of the most common
religious articles, and the materialsAkshaya Vata
from which it is made can often reveal
sectarian affiliations. Shiva is often
depicted wearing beads made of the
seeds of the Elaeocarpus ganitrus tree,
which are known as rudraksha (“eye of
Rudra”). Devotees (bhakta) of Shiva
emulate this practice. Devotees of the
god Vishnu often carry beads made of
wood from the tulsi plant, which is
considered a form of Vishnu’s wife
Lakshmi. Other commonly used mate-
rials are sandalwood and crystal, but
akshamalas can also be made from
expensive materials such as coral and
amber. In Hindu iconography the
akshamala is one of the items com-
monly held by the goddess Saraswati,
in keeping with her identity as the
patron deity of learning and, by impli-
cation, sacred sound. The akshamala
is also one of the items commonly held
by the god Brahma, but in his case it
has less specific significance.
Akshar Purushottam Samstha
One of the prominent branches of the
Swaminarayan sect, which split off
from its parent body in 1906. The
Swaminarayan movement is based on
the teachings of Sahajananda Swami
(1781–1830), an ascetic who was a devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
Sahajananda’s followers eventually
revered him as a manifestation of
Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu),
based on the idea that avatars of Vishnu
appear on earth in times of extreme
trouble. This same reverence is given to
Sahajananda Swami’s ascetic succes-
sors, who are known by the title
Pramukh Swami (“President Swami”).
At present the Akshar Purushottam
Samstha has several million lay devotees
(bhakta) who are mainly Gujarati mer-
chants; their affluence has helped make
the movement financially strong. The
most important figures in the movement
are the small number of ascetics who
serve as teachers and spiritual advisers,
headed by the Pramukh Swami. For fur-
ther information see Raymond Brady
Williams, A New Face of Hinduism, 1984.
Akshaya Trtiya
(also called Akha Teej) Festival
celebrated on the third day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Baisakh (April–May). The
festival’s name reflects the belief that
the religious merit from rites per-
formed on this day is indestructible
(akshaya). This is thought to be the day
on which the Treta Yuga (a previous
cosmic age) began, and as a transition-
al day is believed to be highly
auspicious. This day is marked by wor-
ship of Vishnu and his consort
Lakshmi; it is also believed to be the
birthday of Vishnu’s sixth incarnation,
Parashuram avatar. Consistent both
with the worship of Vishnu and
the belief that this is a transitional
day, on Akshaya Trtiya the temple
doors are opened at the Four
Himalayan Dhams (the holy towns
of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath,
and Badrinath) after having been
closed all winter, and worship in
those places is resumed until after the
festival of Diwali in the fall. See also
Four Dhams.
Akshaya Vata
(“indestructible banyan tree”) In Hindu
mythology, a particular banyan tree that
existed before the creation of the uni-
verse and will be the only thing to sur-
vive the cosmic dissolution (pralaya) at
the end of the cosmic cycle. According to
one mythic account, the sage
Markandeya saw a vision of pralaya in
which the only thing remaining was this
single tree, under which lay the god
Krishna in infant form, sucking on his
toes. The akshaya vata is identified with
a particular banyan tree in Allahabad at
the junction of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers, where it is now enclosed within
the fort built by the Moghul emperor
Akbar. Earlier writers report an
enormous tree on the site, but in mod-
ern times the tree is quite small. In some
stories it was cut down by one of Akbar’s
successors. According to the seventh-
century Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang,
[[25]]
Alakananda River
The Alakananda River near Badrinath Garhwal.
As a tributary of the Ganges, its waters are considered sacred.
one of the preferred methods for
committing religious suicide was to
jump from the branches of the vata
tree; this practice is also mentioned
four centuries later by the Islamic
scholar Alberuni.
Alakananda River
The longest and largest Himalayan tribu-
tary of the Ganges River; the Ganges forms
at Devaprayag, where the Alakananda
unites with a second major tributary, the
Bhagirathi River. As with all the Himalayan
tributaries of the Ganges, the Alakananda
River is considered sacred. Important pil-
grimage places (tirtha) along the river
include the temple town of Badrinath near
its headwaters, its junction with the
Pindara River at Karnaprayag, its junction
with the Mandakini River at Rudraprayag,
and Devaprayag.

Alakhiya Akhara
The name of one subgroup of ascetics
within the Naga class of the Dashanami
order of Sanyasis. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akharas
or regiments that follow the model of an
army. Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas’ primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these occupations
have largely disappeared in contempo-
rary times. The Alakhiya akhara is a
subunit of the Juna akhara, one of the
largest and oldest of the Naga akharas.
The name Alakhiya comes from the
word alakh (“without characteristics,” a
name for the Supreme Being), which
many Shaiva ascetics utter when beg-
ging for alms.Alandi
Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas were fight-
ing ascetics, drawn largely from the
ranks of the shudras, the lowest Hindu
varna. According to tradition, these
fighting ascetics were recruited to pro-
tect the learned ascetics who, because
they were saintly and scholarly men,
could not protect themselves. The
Nagas also had substantial trading
interests. Two and three hundred years
ago, these akharas were very powerful,
especially in parts of the country
where the centralized government had
broken down. The Naga akharas sold
their services as mercenaries, lent
money at interest, engaged in trade,
and often owned large amounts of
property. The one place where the
divisions and subdivisions of the
akharas are still quite important is at
the celebration of the Kumbha Mela, a
bathing (snana) festival. There is a
strict order for bathing, and individu-
als get a place in line based on their
affiliation. Two hundred years ago,
being first in line signified political,
economic, and/or military domi-
nance. The present bathing order
reflects each group's relative impor-
tance from that time.
Alamkara
(“ornamentation”) A term for figures of
speech in Sanskrit poetry, of which there
are more than one hundred types. Many
of these are the same as those used in
English poetics, such as metaphor, simile,
contrast, hyperbole, alliteration, and
puns. The Sanskrit literati distinguished
these figures of speech even further into
more specific types, such as a simile
expressing wonder, a simile expressed by
doubt, and poetic error, which is the
inverse of a metaphor (“that’s not the
moon, but her face . . .”). Other forms are
unique to Indian poetry, such as respec-
tive enumeration, an extended compari-
son in which one line mentions several
referents and the following lines
describe their attributes, always in the
same order as the first line. Another
form unique to Indian poetry is denial in
which the speaker’s real intent is
expressed by denial, but is accompanied
by enough suggestion to indicate the
true meaning. The use of alamkara
marked all kinds of Sanskrit poetry, both
religious and nonreligious, and many of
these forms were brought into the later
devotional poetry in the vernacular
Indian languages. For further informa-
tion on Sanskrit poetics, see Daniel H. H.
Ingalls, Sanskrit Poetry, 1968.
Alambhusha
In Hindu mythology, a celestial woman
who was the daughter of the sage
Kashyapa. As with many of the celestial
women, she was often sent by Indra,
the king of the gods, to seduce sages
whose spiritual merit was great enough
to pose a threat to Indra’s lordship. The
assumption behind this is that celibacy
builds spiritual power, through which
one can become a rival to the gods
themselves. Sexual activity quickly
drains this accumulated power,
although the release of such power usu-
ally has positive consequences.
Alambhusha is best known for her dal-
liance with the sage Dadhichi, by
whom she had a son named Saraswat.
Alandi
Maharashtra village famous as the
home of the poet-saint Jnaneshvar and
the site of his samadhi (burial) shrine.
Jnaneshvar was the first great figure in
the Varkari Panth, a religious commu-
nity centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba. Varkari religious
practice centers primarily around two
annual pilgrimages, in which all the
participants arrive in Pandharpur in the
modern state of Maharashtra on the
same day. Despite having been dead for
over 700 years, Jnaneshvar still symboli-
cally travels from Alandi to Pandharpur
twice each year; a palanquin (palkhi)
carrying his sandals is at the head of the
procession bearing his name.
[[27]]
Alberuni
Alberuni
(973–ca.1050 C.E.) Anglicized version
of the name of Abu Rayhan Biruni, a
central Asian scholar-scientist who
was one of the greatest intellectual fig-
ures of his time. Alberuni was a mem-
ber of the court of King Mahmud of
Ghazni—by most accounts, quite
reluctantly—and was forced to accom-
pany Mahmud on some of his pillag-
ing raids in India. Alberuni used this
involuntary “fieldwork” as an opportu-
nity to study Hindu life, culture, and
sciences, and his work shows him to
be a perceptive, careful, and dispas-
sionate observer. In 1030 C.E. he pub-
lished his findings in his Tahqiq ma
li’l-Hind, which was translated in 1888
by Edward Sachau as Alberuni’s India.
An abridged edition edited by Ainslee
Embree was published in 1971.
Alchemy
Esoteric tradition that seeks to trans-
form, transmute, and perfect the
body through the use of various
chemicals, with the ultimate goal of
rendering the body immortal. Both
Hindus and Buddhists have alchemical
schools. The reported difference
between the Buddhist rasayana school
and the Hindu dhatuvada school is
that the latter is solely materially
based, whereas the former stresses
meditation to gain final enlighten-
ment. These two schools agree on
many basic points of alchemy.
Hindu alchemists view the world as
a series of bipolar opposites in tension
with one another, and they are con-
vinced that unifying these opposing
forces brings spiritual progress and
the end of reincarnation (samsara).
Hindu alchemy shares this model of
uniting or transcending opposing
forces with Hindu tantra, an esoteric,
ritually based system of religious prac-
tice, and with hatha yoga, which is
based on a series of physical exercises
that are also believed to affect the sub-
tle body. Although all three traditions
[[28]]

share a common assumption, they
prescribe different forms of practice to
effect the final goal: in tantra, ritual; in
hatha yoga, physical exercises; and in
alchemy, physical consumption of var-
ious substances.
In the alchemical tradition, the
governing metaphor for this combina-
tion of opposites is the union of sun
and moon. In Hindu tradition the sun
and moon are connected to other
opposing principles through an elabo-
rate series of associations. The sun is
identified with heat, drying power,
fire, Shakti, and menstrual blood; the
moon with coolness, healing power,
water, Shiva, and semen. In alchemi-
cal practice the two essential chemical
elements are mercury and sulfur—the
former identified with Shiva’s semen
and the latter with Shakti’s uterine
blood. By properly mixing and con-
suming these elements, the aspirant’s
body is purified and refined, eventually
rendering it immortal. Modern descrip-
tions of this practice invariably warn
that it should only be carried out
under the direction of one’s guru (spir-
itual teacher), since otherwise these
combinations will be harmful. This
warning is not surprising since mer-
cury is a deadly poison. For further
information see Shashibhushan B.
Dasgupta, Obscure Religious Cults,
[[1962]]
; and David Gordon White, The
Alchemical Body, 1996.
Alidhasana
(“shooting posture”) Bodily posture
(asana) characteristic of certain
images in Hindu iconography. This
position is like that of an archer draw-
ing a bow, in which one knee is thrown
forward, the other leg pushed back,
and the trunk twisted in the direction
of the front leg. The god Shiva in his
manifestation as Tripurari, “the
destroyer of the Triple City,” is often
shown in this posture. The god Rama is
also portrayed in his warrior pose.Alvar
Allahabad
(“City of Allah”) City at the junction of
the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. The city
was named Allahabad by the Moghul
emperor Akbar, who built a fort there in
[[1583]]
 to signify Moghul control of the
region. Traditionally, the place where the
rivers meet is considered a sacred
bathing (snana) place, and the city was
called Prayaga (“place of sacrifice”) by
the Hindus. This name is still used to
distinguish the sacred site (tirtha) from
the city surrounding it. Another name
for the junction is Triveni (“triple
stream”), reflecting the traditional belief
that the two visible rivers are joined at
the confluence by a third underground
river, the Saraswati. Near the bathing
place is a banyan tree believed to be the
akshaya vata (“indestructible banyan
tree”), which despite its powerful name
is at present very small.
As with all places where the Ganges
makes some natural transition—here
its confluence with another sacred
river—Prayaga is considered especially
holy, and bathing there is believed to
confer even greater religious merit
than a normal Ganges bath. This sanc-
tity can be further amplified by
bathing during particularly auspi-
cious times in the calendar. For
example, the annual Magh Mela is a
bathing festival held during the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February).
The holiest time for bathing is during
a festival called Kumbha Mela, which
is held approximately every twelve
years when Jupiter is in Taurus. The
Kumbha Mela is followed six years
later by the Ardha (“half”) Kumbha
Mela, which carries less sanctity than
the “full” Kumbha Mela but is still
considered a highly propitious event.
Allahabad’s Kumbha Mela in 1989 was
the largest religious festival on earth,
attended by an estimated fifteen mil-
lion people on a single day.
Allama Prabhu
(12th c. C . E .) Poet-saint and religious
leader in the Lingayat community, a
bhakti (devotional) community that
worships Shiva as the single supreme
god and rejects all caste regulations.
The Lingayats formed in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka, where they
still have a considerable presence,
and the collections of poetry that
form their most important religious
texts are composed in the Kannada
language. According to legend,
Allama was Shiva himself on earth,
and the honorific title “Master”
(Prabhu) indicates the respect that
his Lingayat contemporaries granted
him. In his poetry, Allama spoke from
the perspective of one who had
gained final liberation and had com-
pletely transcended all ritual and
worldly ties. For further information
see A. K. Ramanujan (trans.), Speaking
of Siva, 1973.
Alvar
Collective name for twelve poet-saints
devoted to the god Vishnu who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. In conjunction
with the Nayanars, who were devoted
to the god Shiva, the Alvars spear-
headed the revitalization of Hindu
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and
the Jains. Both the Alvars and the
Nayanars stressed passionate devo-
tion (bhakti) to a personal god and
conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
The earliest Alvars were a group of
three seventh-century contempo-
raries: Poygai, Pey, and Bhutam,
whose propitious meeting on a rainy
night is described as sparking the
devotional flame. The next group:
Tiruppan, Tirumalisai, Tondaradippodi,
Kulashekhara, Periyalvar, Andal, and
Tirumangai, are believed to have lived
in the ninth century. They were followed
by Nammalvar and his disciple
Mathurakavi, who can be reasonably
placed in the beginning of the tenth
century, as can Nathamuni, who col-
lected all of the Alvars’ hymns in the
Nalayira Prabandham. Although the
[[29]]
Amalaka
Alvars described themselves only as
human devotees (bhakta), by the tenth
century they were revered by the
Shrivaishnava religious community as
anshavatars, or incarnations of Vishnu’s
attributes or companions. Their collected
hymns were (and are) popularly known as
the Tamil Veda and became a vital part of
later Vaishnava piety in southern India.
This is particularly true for the
Shrivaishnava tradition, in which one of
the major figures was Nathamuni himself.
Amalaka
In the Nagara style of Hindu temple
architecture, the amalaka is a stone
disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that
sits on top of the temple’s main tower.
According to one interpretation, the
amalaka represents a lotus and is thus
the symbolic seat for the deity wor-
shiped below. Another interpretation is
that it symbolizes the sun and is thus the
gateway to the heavenly world. The
amalaka itself is crowned with a kalasha
(finial), from which a temple banner is
often hung. See also heavens.
Amalaki Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March). As are all of the
eleventh-day observances, this is dedi-
cated to the worship of Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance. On
this day, one should worship the amvala
tree since this is one of the places in
which Vishnu is believed to reside.
Amarkantak
Sacred site (tirtha) at the headwaters of
the Narmada River, in the Vindhya
mountains in the state of Madhya
Pradesh. As with all the junctions of
India’s sacred rivers, Amarkantak is
held to be an especially holy place for
[[30]]

religious actions. Most pilgrims go there
to perform common pilgrimage rites
such as snana (bathing) and shraddha
(memorial rites), but Amarkantak is also
one of the places mentioned in Sanskrit
texts as a site for religious suicide.
Amarnath
(“The Undying Lord”) Sacred site
(tirtha) and pilgrimage place located
high in the mountains of Kashmir, ded-
icated to the god Shiva in the form of
Amarnath (The Undying Lord). The
focus of the site is a limestone cave,
where each year melting snow trickling
through the limestone fissures naturally
forms a pillar of ice. At its largest, this
pillar can be more than seven feet tall,
but this can vary significantly from year
to year depending on the weather. The
most common aniconic image of Shiva
is the linga, a cylindrical form imper-
fectly described as a “phallic symbol.”
Hindus believe that the ice pillar in the
Amarnath cave is a svayambhu, or “self-
manifested,” linga of Shiva. Such lingas
are not made by human beings but are
places where Shiva decides to reveal
himself, out of love for his devotees
(bhakta). Any svayambhu image is
believed to be particularly holy because
Shiva is thought to be uniquely present.
These sites are often seen as places
where prayers and worship are particu-
larly efficacious.
The Amarnath cave is in a remote
spot that is inaccessible for most of the
year due to snow. The pilgrimage takes
place during the month of Shravan
( July–August), with travelers timing
their trip to arrive on the day
of the full moon. The pilgrimage
officially begins at the Dashanami
Sanyasi akhara in Shrinagar and is led
by the akhara’s leader (mahant), who
carries a silver mace as an emblem of his
authority. This preeminence is given to
ascetics because they are living symbols
of Shiva himself, who is the perfect
ascetic. Most pilgrims start their journey
at the town of Pahalgam. From there
they walk almost thirty miles toAmaru
The outside entrance of the limestone caves at Amarnath.
This is a sacred site in which the god Shiva is believed to reside.
Amarnath, crossing two mountain
ranges on the way. Although the region
is thinly settled for most of the year, dur-
ing the pilgrimage season, camps and
businesses spring up along the route;
many are run by local Kashmiri
Muslims, for whom this is a major
source of livelihood. The offerings at the
shrine are evenly split between the
mahant, the local pandas (Hindu
pilgrimage priests), and a group of
Muslims from a village near Pahalgam
who traditionally maintained the road,
although the state has done this since
India has gained independence. During
the early 1990s, parts of Kashmir were a
war zone between Indian government
forces and a variety of Kashmiri Muslim
groups, some of which pressed for
greater self-determination and others
for unification with Pakistan. These
problems have affected the pilgrimage,
which passes through some of the most
contested areas. In 1994 there were sev-
eral attacks on travelers, reportedly
prompted by pilgrims chanting anti-
Muslim slogans, and in 1995 the pil-
grimage took place under heavy security
provided by the Indian army. The 1996
pilgrimage had no political turmoil, but
several hundred people died of
hypothermia caused by a sudden unsea-
sonable snowstorm.
Amaru
(7th c.?) Sanskrit poet traditionally
thought to be the author of the
Amarushatakam (“Amaru’s Hundred”),
a collection of poems on the theme of
erotic love. The text’s name is doubly
misleading since present editions con-
tain almost 200 poems, and there is
strong evidence that it was compiled
from several earlier collections, making
its authorship uncertain. Although
Amaru’s poetry explores the joys of car-
nal love and is thus not explicitly reli-
gious, the themes of lover/beloved
and union/separation treated in this
poetry later became standard themes in
bhakti (devotional) poetry. In the
Shankaradigvijaya,
a
legendary
biography
of
the
philosopher
[[31]]
Amaruka
Shankaracharya, Amaru is described as
a king who becomes mythically con-
nected with the great sage. In response
to the challenge that he knows nothing
about sexuality, Shankaracharya uses
his yogic powers to animate Amaru’s
body immediately after the latter’s
death. In this form Shankaracharya
experiences this facet of human life,
although reportedly without desire on
his part. Shankaracharya has sexual
relations with Amaru’s wives, enjoys
the fruits of passion, and pens the
Amarushatakam to record his deeds.
Although this claim is highly doubtful,
it helps to illustrate some important
thematic connections between reli-
gious and erotic poetry. For further
information see Lee Siegel, Fires of
Love—Waters of Peace, 1983.
Amaruka
Another name for the legendary poet
Amaru. See Amaru.
Amarushatakam
(“Amaru’s Hundred”) Collection of
poems on the theme of erotic love, tra-
ditionally ascribed to the seventh-cen-
tury poet Amaru. The text’s name is
doubly misleading since present edi-
tions contain almost 200 poems, and
there is strong evidence that it was com-
piled from several earlier collections,
making its authorship uncertain.
Although the poetry explores the joys of
carnal love and is thus not explicitly reli-
gious, the themes of lover/beloved and
union/separation treated in this poetry
later became standard genres of bhakti
(devotional) poetry.
Amba
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata,
Amba is the elder sister of Ambika and
Ambalika. In the story she is abducted
with her sisters by Bhishma, to be mar-
ried to his stepbrother Vichitravirya.
Ambika and Ambalika happily marry
Vichitravirya, but when Amba confides
[[32]]

that she has already given her heart to
King Salva, Bhishma releases her to go to
him. When Amba returns to Salva, he
rejects her on the grounds that her vir-
ginity is suspect because she has been
abducted by another man. Amba
returns to Bhishma and demands that
he marry her, since he is responsible for
her plight. Bhishma refuses to do so
because he has promised his father,
King Shantanu, that he will never marry,
to ensure that his stepbrothers will have
no rivals for the throne. His refusal
leaves Amba with no source of support,
and she vows to get revenge. She is later
reborn as the man-woman Shikhandi,
behind whom Arjuna hides to shoot the
arrows that eventually kill Bhishma.
Ambakeshvar
Another name for Tryambakeshvar, the
presiding deity of a sacred site (tirtha) at
Trimbak, in the Nasik district of the state of
Maharashtra. Tryambakeshvar is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, the “lingas of light”
that are considered especially sacred to
Shiva. See Tryambakeshvar.
Ambalika
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata,
Ambalika is the daughter of the king of
Kashi and one of the wives of King
Vichitravirya. When Vichitravirya dies
childless, his mother, Satyavati, calls
upon her eldest son, Vyasa, to sleep with
Ambalika and her sister Ambika in the
hope that the women will conceive and
continue the family line. According to
tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa
appears in her bed. Ambalika turns pale,
causing her son Pandu to be born with
an unnaturally pale complexion, and
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind.
Ambarisha
In Hindu mythology, a king of the
Ikshvaku dynasty about whom various
sources paint very differing pictures. In
the Ramayana, the earlier of the twoAmmonite
great Hindu epics, he is portrayed as a
man who is willing to sacrifice a boy,
Sunassepha, in place of a sacrificial cow
that Indra has stolen. At the moment of
the sacrifice, Sunassepha prays to the
gods, and Indra appears to bless both
Ambarisha and Sunassepha. In another
story, from the Bhagavata Purana,
Ambarisha is portrayed as a fervent
devotee (bhakta) of Vishnu. When the
sage Durvasas tries to disrupt
Ambarisha’s ekadashi (“eleventh day”)
observances, Ambarisha calls for help
from
Vishnu’s
discus
weapon,
Sudarshana. At Ambarisha’s prayer, the
discus pursues Durvasas throughout the
universe and gives him no place of
refuge. In the end, a humbled Durvasas
is forced to beg Ambarisha’s forgiveness,
and the latter informs Durvasas of the
powers of ekadashi observance.
Ambedkar, Dr. Bhim Rao
(1891–1956) Thinker, writer, and
social activist whose worldview always
reflected his birth as a Mahar, a caste of
untouchables in the state of
Maharashtra. Ambedkar’s father had
joined the British army, which brought
the family enough social mobility for
Bhim Rao to get an education: a B.A. in
Bombay, an M.A. and Ph.D. from
Columbia University in New York City,
and a D.Sc. from London University. He
also passed the British bar exam.
Ambedkar spent his life fighting for the
rights of the untouchable classes,
through both political lobbying and
social action. In 1932, through his
efforts, untouchables were given a sepa-
rate electorate as a minority group.
Mohandas Gandhi was bitterly opposed
to removing untouchables from the
larger Hindu body politic and began a
fast unto death. In the end Ambedkar
relented, but for the rest of his life he
maintained that Gandhi had used the
untouchables as pawns in India’s politi-
cal struggles with Britain. Ambedkar
claimed that for untouchables there was
no material difference between
Gandhi’s practices and traditional caste
Hinduism, because rather than having
any real political power, the untouch-
ables had to continue relying on the
“goodwill” of Hindus to look after their
needs. Ambedkar played an important
role in the formation of the Republic of
India, including being called upon to
author its constitution, but social
inequality continued to rankle him. In
[[1956]]
 he and many of his followers for-
mally converted to Buddhism as a way
to leave the caste system behind. These
“neo-Buddhists” still exist, and despite
their relatively small numbers, their mil-
itancy makes them an important group.
Ambika
(“mother”) Epithet of the Goddess. In
many cases it refers specifically to
Shiva’s wife Parvati, but it is also used
as the name of a powerful female deity
in the Devimahatmya, the earliest text
in which a female divinity is presented
as the Ultimate Reality in the universe.
Ambika
(2) In one of the great Hindu epics, the
Mahabharata, Ambika is the daughter
of the king of Kashi and the wife of King
Vichitravirya. When Vichitravirya dies
childless, his mother, Satyavati, calls
upon her oldest son, Vyasa, to have sex
with Ambika and her sister Ambalika in
the hope that the women will conceive
and continue the family line. According
to tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa
appears in her bed. Ambika covers her
eyes, causing her son Dhrtarashtra to
be born blind, and Ambalika turns pale,
causing her son Pandu to have an
unnaturally pale complexion.
Ammonite
Spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehis-
toric sea creature. The black stones in
which these fossil shells are embedded
are known as shalagrams and are
found in great numbers in the Kali
Gandaki River in Nepal. The name
ammonite comes from the Latin
[[33]]
Amritanandamayi
expression meaning “horn of Ammon,”
which refers to a form of the god
Jupiter that bears rams’ horns. In India
the ammonite’s circular form is under-
stood as a symbol of Vishnu’s discus
(chakra), and thus the shalagram is
considered a svayambhu “self-mani-
fested” image of Vishnu himself. As
with all svayambhu forms of a deity,
the shalagram is considered to be
extraordinarily holy and is usually kept
as an object of worship.
Amritanandamayi
(b. 1953, as Sudhamani) Modern Hindu
teacher and religious leader, whose
devotees (bhakta) worship her as an
incarnation of the Goddess. She was
born the daughter of a poor fisherman,
and from her earliest childhood she
focused on religious life. Her teachings
stress the importance of devotion
(bhakti), particularly to one’s spiritual
teacher (guru), and her devotees credit
her with healing and spiritual awaken-
ing. The Mata Amritanandamayi Math,
located in the city of Quilon in the state
of Kerala, was formed to spread her
teachings in India and abroad.
Amrta
(“imperishable”) In Hindu mythology
this is the nectar of immortality, which is
churned from the Ocean of Milk through
the combined efforts of the gods and the
demons. The word is also used
metaphorically to describe anything
believed to be especially purifying and
powerful, such as charanamrta (“foot
nectar”). Charanamrta are the liquids
(milk, water, etc.) given to devotees
(bhakta) to drink, which are often the
fluids in which their guru’s feet or the
image of a deity have been bathed. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Anahata Chakra
In many schools of yoga and in the
esoteric ritual tradition known as
tantra, the anahata chakra is one of
the six psychic centers (chakras)
[[34]]

believed to exist in the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system, thought to be on
a different plane of existence than
gross matter but with certain corre-
spondences to the material body. It
is comprised of a set of six psychic
centers, which are envisioned as
multi-petaled lotus flowers running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three vertical channels.
Each of these chakras has important
symbolic associations—with differing
human capacities, different subtle ele-
ments (tanmatras), and different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet,
thus encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are,
respectively, Shiva (embodying aware-
ness) and Shakti (embodying power),
the two divine principles through
which the entire universe has come
into being. The underlying assump-
tion behind this concept of the subtle
body is thus the harmony of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mys-
tical texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally
listed from the bottom up, and the
anahata chakra is the fourth. It is visu-
alized as a twelve-petaled lotus locat-
ed in the region of the heart. These
petals each contain a seed syllable
formed from a letter of the Sanskrit
alphabet, in this case the first twelve
consonants. On a symbolic level, the
anahata chakra is associated with the
circulation of blood throughout the
body. It is also identified as the bodily
seat for the subtle element of wind,
the action of which (through the opera-
tion of the five vital winds known as
pranas) is believed to be responsible for
circulating things through the body. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,

Tantra, 1973.Anandamath
Analogy
In certain schools of Indian philosophy,
analogy is considered to be one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge. See upamana.
Ananda
(“bliss”) One of the three traditional
attributes of the Supreme Reality
(Brahman), usually described as being-
consciousness-bliss (sacchidananda).
Ananda, or bliss, is heavily stressed in
certain forms of tantra, an esoteric ritu-
al tradition. In tantra, ananda is both an
aspect of mundane physical enjoyment
and a way of describing the ultimate
realization. In this understanding, even
ordinary pleasures are reflections of ulti-
mate bliss. Ultimate bliss differs from
ordinary pleasure both because it is per-
manent, and because you lose your
sense of self and are aware only of bliss.
emphasizes yoga and meditation, which
are intended to set its practitioners on
the path (marga) to bliss (ananda). The
movement is the strongest in the state of
West Bengal, and has been dogged by
controversy in India, particularly after
Anandamurti was indicted for the mur-
der of two of his disciples. In the end he
was acquitted of all charges, but the
organization’s legal troubles made its
members withdraw from society. Many
Indians view them with suspicion, if not
outright hostility, and the movement is
associated with ritual murder and black
magic. In recent times, it has even been
suspected of terrorism, after a large
shipment of black-market arms was
mysteriously parachuted into a nearby
region in early 1995. Although it has
never been proved that the arms were
for the Society, this incident is one more
element in the surrounding cloud of
secrecy and suspicion.
Anandamath
Ananda Akhara
The name of a specific group of the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis, a par-
ticular type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, organized into six dif-
ferent akharas or regiments on the
model of an army. Until the beginning of
the nineteenth century, the Nagas’ pri-
mary occupation was as mercenary sol-
diers, although they also had substantial
trading interests; both of these occupa-
tions have largely disappeared in con-
temporary times.
For organizational purposes, the
Ananda akhara is considered a sub-
sidiary of the powerful Niranjani
akhara, one of the other seven akharas.
All of the groups have particular
features that define their organizational
identity, especially specific tutelary
deities; the tutelary deity of the Ananda
akhara is fire.
Ananda Marga Yoga Society
Modern Hindu organization founded
by Shri Anandamurti. The Society
Novel by the Bengali nationalist
author Bankim Chandra Chatterjee
(1838–1894). It is set in eighteenth-
century Bengal during the so-called
Sanyasi Rebellion, which invloved
bands of Hindu and Muslim militant
ascetics. Both groups fought with the
British East India Company for con-
trol over the region.
Historical inquiry suggests that the
roots of this conflict lay in the extreme
social tensions in Bengali society,
particularly changes in land ownership
patterns and the havoc wreaked by
the great famine of 1770–1771.
Chatterjee was an ardent Indian nation-
alist and portrayed the Sanyasi
Rebellion as a struggle by Mother India’s
loyal children to expel the parasitic
British invaders from her shores.
Although the novel was set in an earlier
era to avoid problems with the British
authorities, Anandamath is clearly alle-
gorical and nationalistic, and it is viewed
by contemporary critics as Chatterjee’s
way to symbolize the need for continuing
the struggle against British imperialism in
the mid-nineteenth century.
[[35]]
Anandamayi Ma
Anandamayi Ma
(1896–1982) Hindu mystic and saint,
who during her lifetime gained a wide
following in all parts of Hindu society
as a manifestation of the Mother
Goddess. She was born in Dhaka in
modern Bangladesh and from a very
young age showed strong spiritual ten-
dencies. These intensified after her
marriage, when she would slip into
blissful meditation, oblivious to her
surroundings and the passage of time.
The marriage was never consummated
and her husband became one of her
primary disciples. For some time she
lived in an ashram in the city of
Benares, which is famous as a sacred
site (tirtha). Later she built an ashram
just outside the city of Haridwar,
where her samadhi (“burial”) shrine
can be found.
associations: with one of the four Vedas,
with a particular quarter of the Indian
subcontinent, with one of the “great
utterances” (mahavakyas) expressing
ultimate truth, with a specific ascetic
quality, and with several of the ten
Dashanami divisions.
The Anandawara group is affiliated
with the Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath and is thus connected
with the northern quarter of India. Their
Veda is the Atharva Veda, their
mahavakya is Ayamatma Brahman
(“This Self is Brahman”), and their
ascetic quality is to be satisfied with
whatever food they get without begging,
since they are not attached to worldly
pleasures. The particular Dashanami
divisions associated with this group are
Giri, Parvata, and Sagara.
Ananga
Anandapala
The last great king in the Pratihara
dynasty, which ruled large sections of the
northwestern part of the Indian subcon-
tinent between the eighth and eleventh
centuries. In 1001 C.E., Anandapala
assembled a coalition of Hindu princes
to do battle with Mahmud of Ghazni in a
desperate attempt to halt the latter’s
expansion. Anandapala and his allies
were annihilated in a battle near
Peshawar in modern Pakistan, and the
Pratihara dynasty’s power was completely
destroyed. With this powerful dynasty
out of the way, there was no political
force in northern India strong enough to
stop Mahmud. He began making annual
raids into India.
Anandawara
One of the four major groups of the
Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; the other three divisions
are
Kitawara,
Bhuriwara,
and
Bhogawara. Each of these groups has its
headquarters in one of the four monastic
centers (maths) supposedly established
by the philosopher Shankaracharya.
Each group also has particular religious
[[36]]

(“bodyless”) Epithet of Kama, a deity
who is the personification of desire.
Kama was given the name Ananga
because his body was destroyed by the
fire from Shiva’s third eye. See Kama.
Ananta
(“endless”) Epithet of Shesha, the god
Vishnu’s serpent couch. See Shesha.
Anantadas
(late 16th c.) Poet and hagiographer
who wrote “introductions” (parchais)
for some of the best-known northern
Indian devotional (bhakti) poet-saints,
among them Ravidas, Kabir, Namdev,
Trilochan, Angada, and Pipa. His era
can be fixed with reasonable assurance
since Anantadas himself gives 1588 C.E.
as the date of composition for his
Namdev Parchai. Anantadas was con-
temporary with another famous
hagiographer,
Nabhadas,
whom
Anantadas names as a “guru brother”
to his own guru, making Nabhadas a
“spiritual uncle” of Anantadas.
Although both hagiographers provide
valuable information, the descriptionsAndal
Anasuya
by Nabhadas are quite brief, whereas
Anantadas gives extended information
about his subjects. Anantadas’s works
are by far the earliest detailed accounts
of these literary figures, although the
marvelous events included in the
introductions render them suspect as
historical sources. Because his collect-
ed works have never been published,
he remains virtually unknown. For fur-
ther information see David Lorenzen,
Kabir Legends and Ananta-Das’s Kabir
Parachai, 1991; and Winand Callewaert
and Peter G. Friedlander (trans.), The
Life and Works of Raidas, 1992.In Hindu mythology Anasuya is the wife
of the sage Atri. On one occasion
Anasuya is begged by the gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva to help them. A
woman named Silavati has cursed the
sun not to rise, and the creatures on
earth are very distressed. Anasuya suc-
ceeds in persuading Silavati to recall her
curse, and in their gratitude the three
gods tell her she can ask for whatever she
wants. Anasuya requests that each be
born as one of her sons, and this is granted:
Vishnu is born as Dattatreya, Shiva as
Durvasas, and Brahma as Chandra.
Anant ChaturdashiAncestral Spirit
Festival falling on the fourteenth day
(chaturdashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). This festival falls
during the four-month period when the
deity Vishnu is believed to be sleeping
on Shesha, his serpent couch, while his
wife Lakshmi massages his feet. The
festival itself is named after Shesha, one
of whose epithets is Anant (“endless”).
On this day, devotees (bhakta) of Vishnu
should worship and meditate on this
particular image of Vishnu, with Shesha
and Lakshmi.
Before beginning worship, devotees tie
onto their forearm a string dipped in
turmeric, an eastern Indian spice, in
which fourteen knots have been made.
Each of these elements is symbolic: The
string is a symbol of Shesha, the color yel-
low is associated with Vishnu, and the
fourteen knots signify the fourteenth day.
Aside from worshiping Vishnu,
devotees should also fast (upavasa)
on this day. Carefully observing the
requirements for this festival is believed to
ensure prosperity and freedom from exile.
According to mythic tradition, keeping
this vow enables the five Pandava
brothers, the heroes of the epic
Mahabharata, to escape from exile and
regain their kingdom.(pitr) This term is a translation of the
word that literally means “fathers”;
these ancestral spirits are seen as a col-
lective group to whom every man has
duties. One of these duties is to perform
certain memorial rites for them, such as
the rite of sapindikarana. Like most
funerary rites (antyeshthi samskara),
the major objective is to transform the
recently deceased and potentially
malevolent spirit into a benign and
helpful ancestor. Another duty is to pro-
create sons, so that the rites may be
performed without interruption. Both
of these are weighty responsibilities,
and Hindu mythology is replete with
tales of lifelong ascetics, such as
Jaratkaru, who are rebuked by their
ancestral spirits for shirking their duty
to procreate. By virtue of their stable
ancestral status, these spirits are also
well-defined and generally benevolent.
Andal
(9th c.) The only woman among the
Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between
the seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu, and their stress on pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god, conveyed through hymns sung in
the Tamil language, transformed and
revitalized Hindu religious life.
[[37]]
Andhaka
Temple of Venkateshvara in the town of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.
As with many female bhakti figures,
Andal had a particularly passionate rela-
tionship with her chosen deity, whom
she considered her betrothed husband.
This deity was Ranganatha, a particular
form of Vishnu resident at the temple of
Shrirangam in the state of Tamil Nadu.
According to legend, Andal was an
earthly manifestation of Vishnu’s wife
Bhudevi (“Earth Goddess”) and
appeared as an abandoned baby to her
foster father, Periyalvar, another of the
Alvars. When she came of age, she was
adamant that she would have no human
husband and merged into the image of
Ranganatha at Shrirangam.
Although many of the details about
her life are uncertain, Andal did
compose two collections of poetry,
the Tirruppava i and the Nacciyar
Tirumoli, both of which are dedicated
to Vishnu in his form as Krishna. For
further information see Vidya Dehejia
(trans.), Antal and Her Path of Love, 1990.
Andhaka
(“blind”) In Hindu mythology, a
demon born from the darkness that
arises when the goddess Parvati play-
[[38]]

fully covers her husband Shiva’s
eyes with her hands. Shiva names
him Andhaka because he arises from
darkness. Andhaka lusts after Parvati
and continues to pursue her, despite
repeated
remonstrances
that
approaching another man’s wife is
improper. Eventually he goes all the
way to Shiva’s home on Mount Kailas,
where the god kills him.
Andhra
Brahmin subcommunity that is one of
the five southern brahmin communi-
ties (Pancha Dravida). As their name
would indicate, the core region for the
Andhra brahmins is located in the
modern state of Andhra Pradesh.
Andhra Pradesh
Modern southern Indian state. Andhra
Pradesh is one of the so-called linguistic
states formed after independence to
unite people with a common language
and culture (in this case, Telegu) under
one state government.
In the case of Andhra Pradesh, this
was done by combining the princelyAngada
state of Hyderabad with the Telegu-
speaking provinces of the former state
of Madras. This merger did not hap-
pen without some drama; when inde-
pendence arrived, the Nizam of
Hyderabad, a Muslim ruler whose
subjects were mainly Hindus, was ini-
tially reluctant to join the Indian
union, although he acceded after
troops were deployed by the Indian
government. The state capital has
remained at Hyderabad, which is the
largest and most important city.
Andhra Pradesh is overwhelmingly
agricultural, with fertile land in the
Krishna and Godavari river deltas, but
it is relatively undeveloped, and there
is still a great disparity between the
rich and the poor. In recent years it has
become the home of an important
regional political party, the Telegu
Desam, as well as a base for the
Marxist revolutionary group known as
Naxalites, who are carrying on an
armed struggle against the landlords.
Andhra is also home to India’s
richest temple, the temple of
Venkateshvara at Tirupati, and to
Mallikarjuna, one of the twelve jyotir-
lingas, a group of sites especially
sacred to Shiva. For general informa-
tion about Andhra Pradesh and all the
regions of India, an accessible refer-
ence is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Anekantavada
One of the three causal models in
Indian philosophy, along with
asatkaryavada and satkaryavada. All
three models seek to explain the work-
ings of causality in the everyday world,
particularly the relationship between
causes and their effects, which has
profound implications for religious
life. Philosophical theory assumes
that if one understands the causal
process correctly and can manipulate
it through one’s conscious actions, it
is possible to gain final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Disagreements
over differing causal models are
grounded in varying assumptions
about the nature of things.
The asatkaryavada model assumes
that effects do not preexist in their
causes; the satkaryavada model
assumes that they do. The third model,
Anekantavada (“the view that things
are not single”), seeks to occupy the
middle ground between these two.
Anekantavada stresses how one
looks at things and the way that this
can color a judgment. In viewing the
transformation of milk to curds, butter,
and clarified butter, an anekantavada
proponent would claim that the
substances in question were contained
in the causes (supporting the
satkaryavada notion), but that the
qualities each of these substances pos-
sessed were newly created each time
(supporting the asatkaryavada notion).
Thus, causes and effects are simul-
taneously both the same and different,
depending on the lens through which
one looks at them. This theory is an
attempt to find a middle ground
between the other two causal models
by showing that each is possible, but it
runs the risk of being seen as not taking
any position at all. The major propo-
nents of this position are the Jains, who
are outside the scope of the present
work. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Anga
The traditional name for the region
and people of the border area in east-
ern India shared by the modern states
of West Bengal and Bihar.
Angada
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Angada is the son of
the monkey-king Bali and his wife Tara.
Even though Rama, the seventh incar-
nation of Vishnu, has killed his father
under questionable circumstances,
Angada is one of Rama’s loyal allies.
Angada takes part in the search for Sita,
and then in the battle in Lanka to free

Angiras
her, in which his major contribution is
combat with Ravana’s son Meghanada
(an epithet of Indrajit).
After the conquest of Lanka, Rama
appoints Angada as the crown prince
of Kishkindha, a forest in southern
India. Many of the characters in the
Ramayana are paradigms for Indian
cultural values. Angada exhibits
bravery, loyalty, and sincere devotion
to Rama, all of which bring their
eventual rewards.
Angiras
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts are enough to bring
them into being. The others are Marichi,
Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
important and at the time of the Kumbha
Mela take precedence over the others.
Ani
(2) In the region of Tamil, which lies at
the southern tip of the subcontinent on
the Bay of Bengal, the month of Ani is
the third month of the solar year. It cor-
responds to the northern Indian solar
month of Mithuna (the zodiacal sign of
Gemini), which usually falls within June
and July. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the
continuing importance of regional cul-
tural patterns. One way that the Tamils
retain their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Angkor
Temple complex built in northwestern
Cambodia by the Khmer ruler
Suryavarman II (1112–1153 C.E.). The
Khmer people were indigenous to
Kampuchea, but the temples at Angkor
were dedicated to Hindu gods. This
reflects the prodigious influence of
Hindu culture, which by the end of the
first millennium C.E. had been spread
throughout Southeast Asia by Indian
(primarily southern Indian) merchants
and traders.Aniconic Image
Ani(“minuteness”) One of the eight super-
human powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred as a result of
high spiritual attainment. This particu-
lar power gives one the ability to
become as small as an atom.
(according to tradition, a shortened form
of the Sanskrit word anika, meaning
“army”) A major organizational division
of the Bairagi Nagas, ascetic traders and
mercenary soldiers who were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. At present
there are three Bairagi anis: the
Digambara, Nirmohi, and Nirvani. In
earlier times these anis were actual
fighting units, but in modern times these
distinctions are mainly important
to determine bathing (snana) order
in the bathing processions at the
Kumbha Mela. Of the three anis,
the Digambaras are by far the most
[[40]]

A symbol that is meant to represent a
deity. Although it is more common for
human or animal likenesses to stand for
deities, some deities are represented by
symbols or non-pictorial images.
Examples of this would be the linga or
the shalagram, both of which are well-
known symbolic forms of particular
deities—Shiva and Vishnu, respectively.
Anima
Animals
In the Hindu religion, it is believed
that some human beings can be
reincarnated as animals. According to
generally held notions about karma,
being born as an animal is an
unfavorable rebirth in punishment for a
previous grave sin. One is born as an
animal to expiate, or atone for, one’s evilAniruddha
deeds through suffering, in many cases
by being born as a particular type of
animal thousands of consecutive times.
Unlike the Jains, who see all matter
(even stones) as possessing souls, most
Hindus would consider this possible
only for sentient, or fully aware, beings,
including animal life. The conviction
that animals have souls is one of the rea-
sons why many Hindus are vegetarian,
since this diet does the least harm to
other living things.
For Hindus, the animal realm is con-
sidered a place of punishment. From a
karmic perspective, being born as an
animal is an unenviable state, since ani-
mal behavior is run entirely by instinct,
and thus as animals they can make no
conscious effort to better themselves.
From a more concrete perspective, ani-
mals in India often lead very difficult
lives—including, in many cases, the
“sacred” cow.
As with all other unfavorable karmic
states, one’s animal life will eventually
end, but only after one’s sins have been
fully expiated. This suffering and lack of
control over one’s destiny makes birth as
an animal a state to be avoided.
Animal Sacrifice
The practice of animal sacrifice can be
found in two different strands of the
Hindu tradition. The first, and by far the
earliest, is in the cult of sacrifice described
in the later strata of the Vedas, particularly
in the Brahmana literature. The cost of
these rites virtually ensured that they
could only be performed by royalty and
nobility, since some entailed the slaughter
of hundreds of animals.
Perhaps the most famous of these rites
was the horse sacrifice (ashvamedha),
which served to prove a king’s great power.
In the early centuries before the common
era, these sacrifices grew less frequent—a
trend often connected to the stress on
ahimsa by the Buddhists and Jains, two
groups that opposed the slaughter of any
life—and by the early centuries of the
common era, even Hindu commentators
denounced the Vedic sacrifices because
they entailed animal slaughter. In modern
times, these rites have largely fallen into
disuse, and even when they have been
revived and re-created, they usually do not
involve animal slaughter but substitutions
of some sort, such as vegetables or fruits.
The other context in which animal sac-
rifice can be found, and is still performed
quite regularly, is in the worship of village
deities, or certain powerful and terrifying
forms of the Goddess. In this worship the
animals (usually goats) are decapitated,
and the blood is offered to the deity, often
by smearing some of it on a post outside of
the temple.
In Hindu culture, blood is considered
a “hot” substance—highly impure,
extremely powerful, and readily contami-
nating other things. Any deity that
requires sacrifice is also “hot”—powerful
enough to grant favors to their devotees
(bhakta), but also marginal, potentially
dangerous, and requiring frequent animal
sacrifice to maintain their power.
The most extreme example is at the
temple of the goddess Kamakhya in
modern Assam, a region located in
northeastern India. This is one of the few
reported instances of human sacrifice,
although the custom was halted by the
British in 1832. When Kamakhya’s present
temple was consecrated in 1565, she was
supposedly offered the heads of 140 men,
all of whom had volunteered themselves
as offerings.
Although such blood-drinking deities
are often very powerful, many Hindus do
not approve of the impurity (ashaucha)
and slaughter connected with animal sac-
rifice. For this reason, one of the first ways
to make a particular deity acceptable to a
more cultured public is often to make the
sacrifices vegetarian, by substituting a
gourd or cucumber in place of the sacrifi-
cial animal.
Aniruddha
(“unobstructed”) In Hindu mythology,

Anirvachaniyakhyati
Anirvachaniyakhyati
(“indescribable discrimination”) This
is a particular theory of error that
aims to explain why people make
errors in judgment, such as the stock
example of mistaking the silvery flash
of a seashell for a piece of silver. This
theory was advanced by the philo-
sophical school of Advaita Vedanta, a
group that would consider this judg-
ment to be a false one; they would also
believe, however, that until one real-
izes that the object is just a shell, one
actually sees the silver there.
The Advaita theory of error is based
on the fundamental concept of super-
imposition (adhyasa), in which one
perceives something that is actually
there (in this case, the shell). This
real object is the basis for the illusory
perception (the silver), which is a
mistaken projection. The Advaitins
claim that the “silver” is real insofar
as it is based on the shell, and false
insofar as one believes it to be
precious metal.
Of course, according to the
Advaitins, the shell and all the other
“real” things of the world are them-
selves ultimately illusory since they
are superimposed on Brahman, the
only thing in the universe that is truly
real. For further information see
Bijayananda Kar, The Theories of Error
in Indian Philosophy, 1990; and Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Anjali Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
the anjali hasta is a particular hand
gesture (hasta) in which the palms of the
two hands are joined together with the
fingers pointing upward, often with the
base of the thumbs resting against the
chest. This gesture conveys respect and
prayerful devotion.
In modern India this is also the
most common gesture of greeting and
salutation. Since traditional Indian society
was (and to some extent, remains) so
[[42]]

intensely conscious of purity, it is not
surprising that this greeting can convey
respect without requiring one to touch
another person, which could transmit
impurity (ashaucha) from one person
to another.
Anjana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Anjana is the
mother of the monkey-deity Hanuman.
In her previous birth, Anjana was a
goddess, but as the result of a curse, she
is born as a monkey. With the birth of
Hanuman (fathered by Vayu, the god of
wind), the curse was lifted and she
returned to heaven.
Ankusha
(“elephant goad”) This is a weapon with
a wooden or metal handle, with a point
and a sharp hook that real elephant han-
dlers use to coax and goad elephants—
sometimes by poking them with the
hook, sometimes by hitting them with
the butt of the handle.
The ankusha is an important symbol
in Hindu iconography and is primarily
associated with the god Ganesh—per-
haps partly because of his elephant head.
This weapon also corresponds with
Ganesh’s stature as the Lord of Obstacles,
since he can use the ankusha to poke
and prod them out of the way.
Aside from Ganesh, the ankusha is
also a symbol associated with certain
powerful forms of the Goddess. This
may originate with the myth that
describes her as being formed from the
collected radiance of all the gods, and
receiving duplicates of their weapons
from them.
Annakut
(“Mountain of food”) Northern Indian
festival celebrated on the day after the
festival of Diwali (October–November).
This festival is more popularly known as
Govardhan Puja.Annaprashana (“food-eating”) Samskara
A woman displays the anjali hasta hand gesture.
This gesture conveys respect and is a common greeting and salutation.
Annaprashana
(“food-eating”) Samskara
Traditionally, this is the seventh of the
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras) in
which the young child is first given
solid food. In many of the traditional
texts on dharma, the Dharma Shastras,
parents are directed to feed the child
animal flesh. In modern times children
are more commonly fed rice; as the
most popular grain in much of
India, rice can be considered a symbol
for food in general.
[[43]]
Anrta
As in any society, the introduction of
solid food marks a major transition in
the infant’s young life, even though the
infant may not wean for some time after
that. Unlike many of the traditional
samskaras, this is still an important
childhood rite in modern India.
Anrta
In the Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures
that are still the most authoritative reli-
gious texts, anrta is characterized as the
opposite of rta, the cosmic order. Anrta is
particularly associated with falsehood and
untruth, and it involves acts of deliberate
perversions of speech. Hindus believe that
these mistruths undermine the estab-
lished order of the cosmos.
such cases the king’s first wife would gen-
erally have higher status, since this mar-
riage would often be used to cement a
political alliance.
Antarala
(“intermediate space”) The antarala
was a transitional space between a
temple’s main hall and the inner sanc-
tum (garbhagrha), where the image of
the temple’s primary deity would be
housed. The antarala is characteristic
of Nagara architecture, which is one
of three primary styles of Hindu tem-
ples. This space was found only in the
largest temples and in many smaller
ones was omitted entirely.
Antariksha
Anshavatar
A “partial” (amsha) incarnation of a divin-
ity, which is believed to have only part of
the divine power. See also avatar.
Anshuman
In Hindu mythology, the grandson of King
Sagar. After the death of his sixty thou-
sand uncles, who because of their disre-
spect were killed by the sage Kapila,
Anshuman was the sole surviving mem-
ber of the royal line. Anshuman and Dilip,
his son, labored mightily to bring the
Ganges (the earthly embodiment of the
goddess Ganga) from heaven down to
earth, so that by her touch the souls of
their relatives might find peace. Their
efforts were unsuccessful, but Dilip’s son
Bhagirath was finally able to bring the
Ganges to earth.
Antahpura
(“inner city”) In classical times, the name
for the women’s quarters of the palace, so
designated because they were the most
stringently protected. Although most
Hindus had only one wife, in earlier times
it was not uncommon for kings to have a
number of wives and concubines, who
would be housed in the antahpura. In
[[44]]

In the cosmology found in the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu scripture, the antarik-
sha is the middle region of the sky
between the earth and fixed stars; it cor-
responds to what might now be called
the atmosphere. This region is consid-
ered the theater of activity for Indra, god
of the storm and the most important
Vedic deity; it is also home to one mani-
festation of the Vedic god Agni (fire), in
his form as lightning.
Antaryaga
(“internal sacrifice”) In Hindu worship,
but especially in the secret ritual tradi-
tion known as tantra, antaryaga refers
to the internalization of worship. In this
process, worship involving external
actions is replaced by worship based on
mental acts.
This is a later phase of the initiate’s
spiritual path, and is attempted only
after the initiate has mastered the exter-
nal forms of worship. The process of
internalization becomes progressively
more subtle and sophisticated. This step
also demonstrates that the initiate has
achieved more highly developed reli-
gious capacities, in which external
objects are no longer needed.Antyeshthi (“last rites”) Samskara
A woman prepares a deceased man for cremation.
This ritual is one stage of the antyeshthi samskara, the traditional Hindu funerary rites.
Antinomianism
This word has its origins in the convic-
tions of an early Christian sect, whose
members believed that the only thing
needed for salvation was faith, and
not obedience to moral rules. In an
extended sense, this term describes
an attitude in which people ignore
accepted social rules.
In Indian society (as in all societies)
most people uphold the accepted
behavioral norms, but certain groups—
particularly renunciant ascetics and
practitioners of tantra, a secret ritual
tradition—emphasize the breaking of
society’s normally held rules. For the
ascetics, such intentional disregard was
(and is) a symbol of their separateness
from conventional society; they believe
that such rules no longer apply to them.
As a class, ascetics are well-known for
their unpredictable and sometimes
uncontrolled behavior.
The process is more controlled for
practitioners of tantra and most often
takes place in a formal ritual setting.
The stereotypical pattern is to partake
of the “five forbidden things”
(panchamakara), thus consciously
breaking societal norms by consuming
intoxicants and nonvegetarian foods, as
well as practicing illicit sexuality.
Although
tantric
antinomianism
deliberately breaks social taboos, in
theory it is an attempt to make sacred
what is normally forbidden. By doing this,
tantric practitioners destroy embedded
dualistic ideas that are exemplified by
notions such as pure and impure.
From a tantric perspective, the entire
universe is one principle—often the
activity of a particular deity—which
means that one must reject all concepts
based on dualistic thinking. Such
practices are also seen as proof that
tantra is superior to other sorts of
religious activities, since it uses things
that are normally forbidden. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,

of the Three Cities, 1990.
Antyeshthi (“last rites”) Samskara
The sixteenth and last of the traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras),
comprising what can be described as
[[45]]
Anulepana
funerary rites. These rites are not a sin-
gle action, but a series: deathbed rites
for the dying person, cremation for the
corpse, asthi-sanchayana (gathering
the ashes), sapindikarana (assimilation
to the ancestors), various memorial rites
known as shraddhas, and asthi-
visarjana (immersing the ashes in
a sacred river).
These rites have a twofold purpose.
The first is to get rid of the corpse,
which is a source of contagion and
impurity (ashaucha), and thus to pro-
tect the living from the dead. The sec-
ond is to ease the passage of the dead
person’s spirit into the next world.
Aside from these functions, perform-
ing familiar and ceremonial rites for
the dead undoubtedly gives psycho-
logical relief to the living and aids in
the process of grieving. What follows is
merely an overview of these rites; for
more detailed information see the
individual entries.
Ritual activities are the most con-
centrated during the first ten days
after death, which is believed to be the
period
of
greatest
impurity.
Cremation usually takes place on the
day of death, not only to prevent
decay and disease in a hot climate but
also to destroy the body so it will not
be reanimated by a wandering spirit.
Gathering the ashes (asthi-san-
chayana) is done on the second or
third day. In earlier times they would
have been kept in a safe place, some-
times for years, until a relative visiting
a sacred river could perform asthi-vis-
arjana (immersing the ashes); with the
advent of modern transportation, this
is generally performed a few days
after death.
During this ten-day period, the
spirit is given symbolic nourishment to
help build a “new” body. On the
eleventh day, the family performs the
first of the memorial ceremonies
known as shraddhas; in this case an
ekoddishta shraddha is performed in
which brahmin guests, considered
surrogates for the ancestors, are fed.
On the twelfth day after death, the
[[46]]

family
performs
the
rite
of
sapindikarana, through which the
deceased is incorporated into the
ranks of the ancestral spirits (pitr) and
is thus no longer considered a restless
spirit. This is followed by anniversary
shraddhas at regular intervals during
the first year; after this period there is
an annual shraddha once a year during
the Pitrpaksha (“fortnight of the
ancestors”), the waning moon period
in the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September), which is solely
devoted to such memorials. For further

Grodzins Gold, Fruitful Journeys, 1988.
Anulepana
(“smearing”) The ninth of the sixteen
traditional upacharas offered to a deity
as part of worship, which are meant to
treat the deity as an honored guest. In
this offering, the deity is presented
scented unguents, or ointments, such as
sandalwood paste. These ointments are
not only used for their fragrance but are
also believed to be good for the skin.
Anuloma
(“with the hair”) See hypergamous
marriage.
Anumana
(“measuring after”) In Indian philoso-
phy this is the term for an inference,
which is generally accepted as one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate knowl-
edge. The word’s literal meaning reflects
the Indian conviction that any inferenceAnyathakhyati
must be grounded in perception
(pratyaksha), the most direct means of
knowledge, and must ultimately appeal
to perception for evidence.
A classic inference includes three
terms: a hypothesis (pratijna), a rea-
son (hetu), and examples (drshtanta),
each of which is made up of parts.
One part of the hypothesis is the idea
to be proved (sadhya), which is predi-
cated on a certain class of objects,
called the paksha. In the statement
“there is fire on this mountain,” the
sadhya is the assertion that there is
fire, and the paksha is the particular
mountain. The object mentioned in
the paksha must also appear in the
second term, the hetu, along with the
stated reason. In the example cited
above, the hetu could be “because
there is smoke on this mountain.”
As proof, it was necessary to cite pos-
itive and negative examples, known as
the sapaksha and vipaksha, respectively.
An appropriate sapaksha could be “like
kitchen,” since ancient kitchens had
both fire and smoke; a vipaksha could be
“unlike lake,” since lakes contain neither
of these.
This general form of an inference
is subject to numerous tests for
validity; one of the most important of
these is vyapti, the requirement that
the reason given must account for
all cases of the idea to be proved. For
further information see Karl H. Potter
(ed.),

Philosophies, 1972.
Anushtubh
By far the most widely used meter in
Sanskrit poetry, composed of two
lines of sixteen syllables each with
eight syllables per half line. The metric
pattern for each half line is based on
the distinction between “heavy” and
“light” syllables. A heavy syllable is any
syllable with a long vowel or conso-
nant cluster; all other syllables are
light. According to the prescribed pat-
tern, the fifth syllable of each half line
should be light, the sixth heavy, and
the seventh alternately heavy and
light. The anushtubh’s simplicity
makes it the meter of choice for many
religious texts, including much of the
Bhagavad Gita.
Anyathakhyati
(“discrimination of something else”)
A theory of error that aims to explain
why people make errors in judgment,
such as the stock example of mistak-
ing the flash of a seashell for a piece
of silver. This particular theory of
error originated with the Naiyayika
philosophical school. Like the Purva
Mimamsa philosopher Prabhakara,
the Naiyayikas believe that the simple
judgments “that object is silvery” and
“silver is silvery” are both true and
indisputable. Whereas Prabhakara
explains the error as an error of omis-
sion, in which one fails to notice the
non-relationship between these judg-
ments, the Naiyayikas explain this as
an error of commission, by projecting
something that actually is not there.
In Naiyayikan metaphysics all
objects and their attributes are con-
nected by a dependent relationship
known as inherence (samavaya),
which in this case connects a silvery
color with two different objects: ele-
mental silver, and a shell. They believe
that the perceiver is projecting a wrong
inherence relationship (silver) onto the
perceived object (shell).
The Naiyayikas can claim this
projection is real because they
accept the reality of nonexistent
things (e.g., the nonexistence of
a crocodile in my bathtub). For
the Naiyayikas all such projections
are rooted in karmic dispositions
stemming from avidya, or primal
ignorance, specifically the greed
for silver that prompts people to
look for such items of value. For

Philosophy; 1978 and Karl H. Potter

Apabhramsha
(ed.), Presuppositions
Philosophies, 1972.
of
India’s
Apabhramsha
(“fallen away”) An important northern
Indian Prakrit, one of the vernacular
languages that developed naturally
from Sanskrit. Apabhramsha was the
latest addition to the Middle Indo-
Aryan languages and is considered a
direct precursor of early modern Hindi,
which was becoming established as
early as the twelfth century. Although
Apabhramsha has lesser status than
Sanskrit, it was nevertheless an impor-
tant regional literary language.
Apaddharma
Religious protocol that comes into effect
in times of distress, disturbance, natural
disaster, or social deterioration. The
practical effect of apaddharma is to sus-
pend most of the normal social rules,
particularly those governing interaction
and commensality between different
social subgroups (jatis). In ordinary cir-
cumstances these rules are affected by
concepts of purity, impurity (ashaucha),
and relative social status.
The underlying message here is
that the preservation of life is more
important than such rules, and that
they can be broken to save a life—as in
the case of escaping a fire or flood, in
which the usual concerns about phys-
ical contact with lower-status people
are suspended.
Apana
One of the five bodily “winds” consid-
ered to be responsible for basic bodily
functions, the others being prana,
vyana, udana, and samana. The apana
wind is believed to exist in the region of
the anus and is associated with dis-
charging material out of the body: urine,
feces, gas, semen, menstrual discharges,
and the birth of children.
[[48]]

Apastamba
(4th c. B. C . E .?) Sage, writer, and
commentator. Apastamba is known for
his influential work with the Kalpa
Sutra form, a type of text that consists
of three essential elements: instruc-
tions for Vedic rituals (Shrauta
Sutras), for domestic rites (Grhya
Sutras), and for suitable human
behavior (Dharma Sutras).
He is one of three authors, along
with Baudhayana and Hiranyakeshin,
who wrote complete Kalpa Sutras with
all three parts. All three of these
men belonged to the same school,
the Taittiriya school of the Black
Yajur Veda.
Apastamba’s Dharma Sutra is
extremely significant, for it is consid-
ered one of the major sources for the
law code attributed to Manu. This
code was an important legal docu-
ment even in the early twentieth cen-
tury, since India’s British rulers
considered it a source of “traditional”
Hindu law.
Appar
(7th c. C.E.) One of the earliest of the
Nayanars, a group of southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. The Nayanars helped
to revitalize the Hindu religion through
their passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language.
Historians believe that Appar was born
into a Shaivite family but became a Jain
ascetic in his youth. The turning point
came when he suffered a serious illness.
Discouraged when Jain medicines were
unable to cure his illness, he prayed to
Shiva for help and was cured.
Along with his younger contemporary
Sambandar, Appar actively confronted
and opposed the heterodox sects of the
times, particularly the Jains, with open
defiance, debates, and miracles. His great-
est achievement is reported to have been
the conversion of King Mahendravarman
(r. 600–630 C.E.), one of the greatest kingsAranya Dashanami
in the Pallava dynasty, from Jainism
to Shaivism.
The collected hymns of the three most
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,
and Sundaramurtti—comprise the
Devaram, the most sacred of the Tamil
Shaivite texts.
Appaya Dikshita
Sixteenth-century writer and commenta-
tor in the Bhamati branch of the Advaita
Vedanta philosophical school.
Aprashasta
(“reprehensible”) Marriages
According to the texts on religious duty
(dharma) known as the Dharma
Shastras, these are the four forms of
marriage subject to disapproval: the
asura marriage, gandharva marriage,
rakshasa marriage, and paishacha
marriage. Although all of these are
considered reprehensible, this disap-
proval comes in differing measures:
the asura (paying money for a bride)
and gandharva (betrothal by mutual
consent) marriages are tolerated,
while the rakshasa (forcible abduction)
and paishacha (taking advantage
of an insentient woman) forms
are forbidden.
Despite such harsh condemnation,
all of these marriages are held to be
legally valid. It is generally agreed that
this position was intended not to legiti-
matize unconscionable actions but to
give the woman the legal rights of a wife,
whatever the circumstances of her mar-
riage. The asura marriage is the only one
of these forms still practiced in modern
times, although it is done only by people
who are either very poor or of very low
social status.
become too powerful. Because ascetics
practice celibacy, and it is assumed
that celibacy builds spiritual power,
successful ascetics can become rivals
to the gods themselves. Sexual activity
will quickly exhaust the ascetic’s power,
although it can often bring other bene-
fits to the world, including the birth of
children, which always results from
such intimate encounters.
The apsaras are sent on their mis-
sions by Indra, the king of heaven,
since any ascetic who gains too much
power will be able to claim Indra’s
divine throne. One famous apsara is
Menaka, whose seduction of the
sage Vishvamitra results in the birth
of Shakuntala. Another is Urvashi,
who is renowned for her dalliance with
King Pururavas.
Apurva
According to the Purva Mimamsa
philosophical school, apurva is an
unseen force created by action—par-
ticularly ritual action. This unseen
force exists from the beginning of the
action to the result of that action, and
it invariably brings the intended result
into being. This doctrine was devel-
oped to connect actions with their
results, particularly when the result
came some time after the initial action,
and is especially relevant to karma.
The Mimamsas developed the concept
of the apurva because they wanted to sup-
port information found in the Vedas,
which in many cases specifies that certain
actions will eventually produce specific
results. For further information see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A.
Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Aranya Dashanami

In Hindu mythology, a class of celestial
nymphs renowned for their beauty,
grace, and irresistible attractiveness.
One of their main mythic functions is

One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetics who
are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The

lished by the ninth-century philoso-
pher Shankaracharya in an effort to

create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case,
aranya (“forest”). Upon initiation,
new members are given this name
as a surname to their new ascetic
names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are
divided into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquar-
ters in one of the four monastic
centers (maths) also established
by Shankaracharya. The Aranya
Dashanamis belong to the Bhogawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri,
on the Bay of Bengal.
[[50]]

Aranyaka
(“Forest books”) General designation for
a type of literature contained in the
sacred texts known as the Vedas. The
Aranyakas are transitional in nature; in
their content they move away from the
focus on ritual and sacrifice found in
the Brahmana literature and foreshad-
ow the later, more speculative texts
known as the Upanishads.
Because of their name, the
Aranyakas are widely believed to have
been composed in the forests, perhaps
by ascetics who had left formal soci-
ety. The tone in these texts is question-
ing and speculative, and in stylistic
terms there is no clear break between
the Aranyakas and the Upanishads:
one of the earliest upanishads is
named
Brhadaranyaka
(“Great
Forest-Book”) Upanishad, which rein-
forces the connection.Architecture
Arati
The act of waving a lighted lamp before
a deity. The deity may be present
in many forms, such as a picture,
statue, symbol (svayambhu image)
such as the shalagram, or even a
natural phenomenon such as a river, as
in the case of the Ganges.
The arati lamp usually is a shallow
vessel holding a cotton wick soaked in
oil or clarified butter, with a ring-shaped
handle to protect one’s hands. This is
one of the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas) presented to a deity as part
of worship. This particular act is the
offering of light.
Arati is arguably the single most
common act of Hindu worship, per-
formed daily in Hindu homes and
temples throughout the world. Because
of this fact, the word arati is sometimes
used to refer to any act of worship,
even singing panegyric hymns during
worship. Before electric lights were
invented, when the temples were much
darker, arati also served to give the
devotees (bhakta) in the temples a
better view of the deity, which was
very important.
Aravalli Hills
A range of hills running diagonally from
the southwestern to the northeastern
corner of Rajasthan. They are important
for their physical characteristics, which
have a profound effect on the environ-
ment. On the northern side of the hills,
the land slopes gently into the Thar
desert and is arid and thinly settled. On
the southern side, the hills provide
more protection. As a result the land is
greener and comparatively richer than
on the northern side.
Sacred sites (tirthas) in the Aravallis
include the town of Pushkar, with its
holy lake, as well as the temple devoted
to Balaji, which is located in the village
of Mehndipur.
Archana
(“salutation”) Rites of welcome and
reverence, usually performed during
formal worship of a deity in a temple. In
a larger sense, this word can also refer to
those rites of reverence and salutation
performed for one’s elders, superiors, or
any honored guest.
Architecture
Hindu temple architecture in India has
developed over time into several dis-
tinct, mature styles. The earliest phases
are based on early Buddhist architectur-
al forms, such as the rock-cut cave tem-
ple (chaitya) or enclosed courtyard
(vihara). Some of these early Hindu
rock-cut temples include those at Ellora
and Elephanta; others are free-standing
but based on this form, as at Aihole.
Later Hindu architecture has three
basic styles: Nagara, Dravida, and
Veshara, of which the first two are the
most important. Each of these styles is
found in a certain area of India: the
Nagara in the north and east, the Dravida
in the south, and the Veshara in the west
and in Deccan. The basic differences
between them can be simplified to the
different styles of the temple towers.
The Nagara style emphasizes verti-
cality, with the whole temple building
culminating in a single highest point.
Different emphases in the ways of
treating the tower led to different
substyles: In the temples at Khajuraho,
the entire structure gradually leads up
to the central tower, whereas the
Orissa style stresses a single enormous
tower surrounded by much smaller
subsidiary parts.
In the Dravida style, the towers tend
to be composed of horizontal tiers, with
the visual emphasis on horizontal rather
than vertical. In the later Dravida
temples, the tallest structures are the
gopurams, the central gateways in
the walls enclosing the temples. A
Dravida-style temple may have a fairly
modest tower over the central shrine, but
the area covered by the temple is often
enormous, and many of them are cities in
their own right.
The Veshara style has a barrel roof
over the sanctuary, an architectural

Ardha (“Half”) Kumbha Mela
advanced halfway through the zodiac
toward the next full Kumbha Mela. It is
generally celebrated only at Allahabad
and Haridwar, marking the greater
importance of these two sites.
Although the full Kumbha Mela is
deemed more auspicious and gets
much larger attendance, the Ardha
Kumbha Mela is still attended by mil-
lions of pilgrims.
Ardhamandapa
(“half pavilion”) In the later Nagara style
of temple architecture, the ardhaman-
dapa was the entrance porch of the tem-
ple, which formed a transitional area
between the outside world and the
mandapa, or hall.

feature with roots in the Buddhist
chaityas (rock-cut cave temples). This
architectural style is midway between the
Nagara towers and the Dravida tiers.
Ardha (“Half”) Kumbha Mela
A religious celebration secondary to
the Kumbha Mela. The Kumbha Mela
is a gigantic religious festival that
entails bathing (snana) in sacred
rivers. It is celebrated at four sacred
sites (tirthas): Haridwar, Allahabad,
Ujjain, and Nasik. It occurs approxi-
mately every twelve years, based on
the position of the planet Jupiter in
the zodiac.
The Ardha Kumbha Mela is cele-
brated six years after the full (purna)
Kumbha Mela, when Jupiter has

(“the deity who is half woman”)
Particular form of the god Shiva, in
which the left side of the image has
female form, dress, and ornamentation,
and the right side has male characteris-
tics and dress.
The image has several possible inter-
pretations. As a divinity one of Shiva’s
attributes is his ability to transcend all
duality, and this half-woman, half-man
image symbolizes that power over even
the most basic human difference, sexual
identity. In the context of the esoteric
ritual tradition known as tantra, which
describes the universe as the product of
the interaction between the divine prin-
ciples of awareness (Shiva) and power
(Shakti), this image symbolizes not only
the radically different natures of these
two principles, but also their insepara-
bility in action.
The Ardhanarishvara is sometimes
referred to as the androgyne; this term
seems inappropriate, however, since
the image does not show the loss
of sexual characteristics associated
with androgyny but rather the full
development of each on their respec-
tive sides.Arjuna
Arghya
The fourth of the sixteen traditional
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a deity
as a part of worship. The upacharas are
based on the model of treating the deity
as an honored guest. The word arghya
literally means “to be respected”; in this
offering the image is given a drink of
water or some other beverage as a sign
of respect.
The actual act of offering can be
done in various ways and often depends
on the worshiper’s preferences. In some
cases the water vessel will simply be pre-
sented before the deity’s image, with the
understanding that the deity has taken
it, whereas in other cases the devotee
(bhakta) will actually give some water to
the image. In either case the underlying
motive is to show love for the deity and
to minister to its needs.
Arjuna
The third of the five Pandava brothers in
the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics. Arjuna is born when
his mother, Kunti, uses a powerful
mantra to have a son by Indra, the king
of the gods.
Arjuna is the prototypical kshatriya
warrior-king. He is described as peerless
in battle, a hero ever ready to defend the
truth, and a person always faithful to his
word—but at times arrogant, egocen-
tric, quick to anger, and inclined to use
force to settle disputes.
Arjuna is most famous as an archer,
as which he has no equal. When he and
his brothers are studying archery with
their teacher Drona, Arjuna outshines
them all with his dedication and ability,
but his spiteful side can be seen in the
story of Ekalavya. Ekalavya is a tribal
boy who wants to learn archery from
Drona, the royal archery teacher, but is
refused because of his low birth.
Undaunted, Ekalavya makes a clay
image of Drona, treats it as his teacher
(guru), and through his assiduous prac-
tice and his devotion to his guru
becomes the most skilled archer on
earth. When Arjuna discovers this, he
becomes jealous and complains to
Drona, since the teacher has promised
Arjuna that no one will surpass him as
an archer. Drona asks Ekalavya how he
has become so skillful, and when he
learns that Ekalavya has worshiped
Drona’s image as his guru, Drona notes
that he is entitled to a preceptor’s fee
(dakshina). As his fee he requests
Ekalavya’s right thumb, a gift that will
considerably diminish Ekalavya’s
shooting abilities since its loss will
impair his ability to draw a bow.
Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish without
hesitation but from that day on he is no
longer better than Arjuna.
Another instance of Arjuna’s narrow-
mindedness comes in his claim that
another great rival, Karna, cannot com-
pete in a royal shooting competition
because Karna is a foundling, and his
lineage is thus unknown. Karna is a
close companion of Arjuna’s cousin
Duryodhana, and because of this insult
the relations begin to deteriorate
between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the two branches of this
extended family. The final result is the
fratricidal civil war that is the climax of
the epic.
Throughout the Mahabharata,
Arjuna is associated with numerous
heroic exploits. To fulfill a promise given
to his teacher Drona, Arjuna defeats
King Drupada, who has earlier insulted
Drona. Through a feat of archery, he
wins the hand of Draupadi by drawing a
bow that others cannot even lift and
then hits a target suspended in the air.
He aids the fire god, Agni, in the burning
of the Khandava forest. He shields Agni
from the rain by creating a tent of arrows
that keeps the forest covered. During the
year that the Pandavas spend incognito,
after twelve years of exile in the forest,
Arjuna takes the guise of the eunuch
Brhannala and in this guise wins a great
battle against the Kauravas.
His greatest exploits occur during the
epic’s climactic eighteen-day war, in
which he defeats the Kaurava armies,
fights all their major figures, and finally
[[53]]
Arranged Marriage
kills his long-standing adversary Karna,
who is actually his own half brother.
After destroying the Kauravas in
the Mahabharata war, Arjuna serves
his elder brother, Yudhishthira,
who becomes king; after the conflict,
however, the need for such a warrior
has passed.
Arjuna is also known as a listener. At
the moment when the great war is about
to begin, Arjuna has sudden doubts
about the propriety of killing his friends
and relatives, even during a just war. To
allay his doubts and to help him regain
his resolve, his charioteer Krishna
recites the Bhagavad Gita, one of the
single most influential Hindu religious
texts. The Gita’s advice on the nature of
Self, struggle, and the search for God has
served to counsel those fighting literal
and metaphorical battles, most notably
Mohandas K. Gandhi during the struggle
for Indian independence.
Arranged Marriage
A marriage that is arranged by the
parents of the bride and groom,
although it has become fairly common
for the prospective couple to meet
beforehand to assess whether or not
they are compatible.
Although this practice seems strange
by mainstream American standards,
proponents of arranged marriages see
them as better and longer lasting than
love marriages. It is assumed that with
arranged marriages parents will be able
to take a more detached and rational
perspective. They will usually choose
spouses who come from similar social
and economic backgrounds, in many
cases from the same jati, or social sub-
group. Parents may compare their chil-
dren’s horoscopes for clues, and they
may also try to match people with com-
patible personalities. Ideally, all of this is
done with great care and with the
understanding that their highest priori-
ty will be their children’s long-term wel-
fare. Marriage is widely seen as the most
important event in a person’s life since it
is the basis of family life, and the family
[[54]]

is the foundation of society. Part of the
marriage negotiations between the two
sides includes whether or not the bride
will have a dowry, and if she will, what
this will be.
One of the assumptions with
arranged marriages is that men and
women will play fairly traditional roles.
This gives the couple some idea of what
to expect and what is expected of them,
but it can also be confining for people
who do not wish to fulfill such roles. At
least in northern India, the adjustments
often fall much more heavily on the new
bride, since she will become part of her
husband’s family.
Arranged marriages are still extremely
popular among modern Hindu families,
and many young people would not
dream of fixing their own marriages. A
practical consideration supporting the
popularity of arranged marriages is that
it is often difficult for young people to
meet and develop the friendships that
could lead to love marriages. Indian
society is still very sex segregated. Social
interaction between unrelated single
men and women is still uncommon in
villages and smaller towns, although this
pattern is breaking down in larger cities
since more women are working outside
the home.
In both contexts the biggest mixing
place tends to be the college or
university, but even there women and
men tend to associate in groups
rather than as individuals. In a society
in which contact is limited, and formal
dating even more unusual, an arranged
marriage is often the best way to find
a compatible spouse.
Arsha Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform
a marriage recognized in the Dharma
Shastras, the treatises on religious
duty (dharma). In an arsha marriage,
the bride’s father receives a pair of cattle
from the bridegroom with the under-
standing that the cattle are to be used
for sacrifice.Arthashastra
This was regarded as one of the four
approved forms of marriage (prashasta
marriages) but fell out of favor because
of the stigma of accepting any sort of gift
for the bride, even one explicitly desig-
nated for sacrifice. The form was named
after the rishis (sages) because of the
implicit sacrificial rites. See also mar-
riage, eight classical forms.
Artha
In Indian philosophy this is one of the
four purusharthas, or aims of life, with
the others being kama (desire), dharma
(religious duty), and moksha (final liber-
ation of the soul). The word artha has dif-
ferent shades of meaning in various
contexts, but all of these meanings center
on the definitions “aim,” “goal,” or “end.”
The word can thus refer to any goal of
human life, but as one of these
purusharthas, artha refers to riches,
power, and worldly prosperity. These are
the material things that allow one to ful-
fill one’s temporal goals, and unless one
gains them in some measure, any sort of
worldly happiness becomes problematic.
Hindu culture has traditionally sanc-
tioned wealth and power as a legitimate
human goal, although this endeavor
must be governed by a commitment to
dharma. When controlled by an overall
orientation to righteous action, the
quest for wealth is part of an integrated
life. Without this commitment the drive
for wealth becomes an all-consuming
desire that ultimately destroys a person.
Arthapatti
(“presumption”) All Indian philosophical
schools concern themselves with codify-
ing the pramanas, that is, the means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge. Almost all schools
consider perception (pratyaksha), infer-
ence (anumana), and authoritative testi-
mony (shabda) as pramanas; the Purva
Mimamsa school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, posited
two others: abhava (“knowledge from
absence”) and arthapatti.
Arthapatti is an inference from cir-
cumstance in which a judgment is
made about one case based solely on
similarities to related cases. An
example would be when a traveler is
presumed to have reached her destina-
tion, since the train’s arrival time has
passed. According to Indian philoso-
phy, this is not a true inference since
the judgment must always be con-
firmed by direct perception, in this
case that the train had actually
reached its destination. The Purva
Mimamsas justified this new pramana
by arguing that this knowledge could
not be accounted for by any of the
existing pramanas and thus required
this new one to explain it. The other
schools were not inclined to accept it,
since its presumptive nature could
often lead to error.
Arthashastra
(“Treatise on Power”) Text on power and
politics attributed to Kautilya, the
Machiavellian prime minister said to
have orchestrated the rise to power of
Chandragupta Maurya (r. 321–297
B.C.E.), the founder of the Maurya
dynasty. The Arthashastra was intended
as a guidebook for the king, to help him
control both the people in his kingdom
and the surrounding states.
The Arthashastra’s fundamental
assumption was that the king wanted to
remain in power and should do whatev-
er it took to retain it.
Within the kingdom, Kautilya advo-
cated a strict and authoritarian govern-
ment aided by an extensive network of
spies to gather intelligence and assess
the popular mood. These spies included
men posing as wandering ascetics, who
could move about without suspicion.
The book also advised the king to assign
special spies to his closest advisers
to monitor their ambition, and to
have these spies report only to the
king himself.
In regard to neighboring countries,
the Arthashastra assumed that each
king wanted to increase his kingdom at
[[55]]
Arundhati
the expense of his neighbors. Weaker
neighbors were to be conquered and
assimilated, whereas stronger ones
were to be pacified or stalled with the
eventual hope that these stronger
states could be countered by making
other alliances.
Although the Arthashastra was
never the “Bible” of any ruling Indian
dynasty, it detailed political philosophy
and practices that existed in ancient
and medieval India and can even
be
discerned
in
contemporary
parliamentary politics.
Arundhati
The wife of the sage Vasishtha. In Hindu
mythology Arundhati is a model of
devotion to her husband, and during
contemporary marriage ceremonies,
she is invoked by the groom as a model
of wifely fidelity. Arundhati is also per-
sonified as the minor star Alcor in the
constellation known as the Big Dipper
(known in India as the Seven Sages
because of its seven main stars); here
she accompanies the star personifying
her husband.
Aryabhatta
Ancient astronomer and mathemati-
cian, whose major work was composed
in 499 C.E. Among Aryabhatta’s accom-
plishments were his theories that the
earth was a sphere that rotated on its
axis, and that eclipses were caused by
the shadow of the moon. He also calcu-
lated the value of pi to four decimal
places and the length of the year to
seven decimal places. Both these feats
show not only great facility with mathe-
matics but also the use of the zero.
Although Aryabhatta is celebrated as
a scientist, in the ancient world there was
no differentiation between astronomer
and astrologer. Given the assumption
that the heavenly bodies influenced
human affairs, his astronomical conclu-
sions would have also been used in the
field of astrology.
[[56]]

Aryan
This word is derived from the Sanskrit
word arya (“noble”), which is used in the
earliest Hindu sacred literature, the
Vedas, to describe a certain group of
people that believed the Vedas were
sacred. In the beginning this word sim-
ply designated “our group” from “other
people,” whom the Veda names Dasyus
(“slaves”). These provide a description of
the slaves as having flat noses and curly
hair. Throughout history Hindu writers
have often described themselves as
“Arya,” although it is important to note
that this need not be understood as a
racial designation, since it could merely
be intended to mean “noble.”
Who were these Aryans? Nineteenth-
century
European
philological
research discovered structural rela-
tionships between Sanskrit and
classical European languages and
speculated that all these languages
came from a common parent. Based
on further analysis, these researchers
hypothesized that people speaking
this parent language originated in
Central Asia, somewhere near the
Caspian Sea. From there, some went
west to Europe, some went southwest
to Turkey, and some went south
toward Iran and later to India. The
conclusion that these Indian pilgrims
came from Iran is based on compar-
isons between the Avesta and the
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious
texts. These texts show broad linguis-
tic similarities and indicate that the
people speaking the languages were
closely related. This entire theory is
thus based solely on the observed
similarities between languages and on
how they changed.
For the nineteenth-century philolo-
gists, “Aryan” was a linguistic category
used to designate people speaking
certain languages and involved no
assumptions about the speakers’
racial identity. Despite this fact,
the word quickly assumed a racial
connotation in European discourse,
with terrible consequences.Arya Samaj
The Aryan movement was once
described as an “invasion,” but in recent
years it has become more common to
describe it as a “migration.” According to
the accounts in the Vedas, the Aryans
were a pastoral people, and although
some Vedic passages mention war
chariots, the majority describe herds of
cattle. Given this picture of nomads fol-
lowing their cattle to pasture, the image
of an invading army seems improbable.
The Aryan migration theory
accounts for the dissemination of vari-
ous languages but is not universally
accepted. Many modern Indians
subscribe to the Indigenous Aryan (IA)
theory, which maintains that the Aryans
are the original inhabitants of India and
as proof points to the artifacts found in
the Indus Valley civilization. Some of
the people that believe the IA theory may
be reacting against the Aryan migration
theory’s perceived colonialist bias, since
the theory was developed by Europeans
and assumes that the dominant groups
in modern India must have come from
outside. Other supporters are the propo-
nents of Hindutva, who claim that all
Indians are “really” Hindus and thus one
social group, whatever their particular
religious beliefs.
This assertion has profound political
implications in modern India, where
Christians and Muslims are not only
religious communities but social and
political ones as well. By connecting
Hindu identity with good Indian
citizenship, Hindutva proponents are
marginalizing Christians and Muslims
as outsiders.
Arya Samaj
Reformist Hindu organization formed in
[[1875]]
 by Swami Dayanand Saraswati.
The Arya Samaj was formed in an era of
sweeping social, economic, and reli-
gious change—the last particularly
caused by Christian missionary evange-
lism—and represented an authentic
Hindu response to these changes.
For some time, more traditional
Hindus perceived this organization as a
genuine religious threat. Swami
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption
was that ultimate religious authority lay
only in the ancient scriptures called the
Vedas. This stance allowed him to attack
many of the “social evils” plaguing nine-
teenth-century Hinduism, such as child
marriages, sati, image worship, the
caste system, and a ban on widow
remarriage. He contended that these
practices were corrupt and illegitimate
since they could not be found in the
Veda, and the Arya Samaj worked cease-
lessly to get rid of such practices.
Unlike the Brahmo Samaj, an
earlier reformist organization, the ideas
of the Arya Samaj showed no
Christian influence. It certainly addressed
many concerns raised by Christian
reformers, but the Arya Samaj was
militantly
anti-Christian.
It
was
equally opposed to the “corruption”
of contemporary Hinduism.
Although the Aryas claimed that they
were simply getting back to the Veda, the
ultimate aim was not to reclaim that
long-gone era but to develop a form of
Hindu religious life more compatible
with “modern” times. The Aryas
replaced image worship with a fire sac-
rifice based on the rituals in the Veda.
The Arya Samaj was also notable for
promoting the ceremony of “purifica-
tion” (shuddhi), through which Hindus
who had become members of other reli-
gious communities were received back
into the Hindu community.
Dayanand and his followers were
quite militant in espousing such reforms
and saw themselves as developing the
leadership for the future of Hinduism.
To accomplish this the Arya Samaj
strongly emphasized education, and
one of its most lasting achievements has
been establishing schools and colleges
to educate its women and men.
Although the Arya Samaj was highly
controversial for its first sixty years, by
the late 1930s its revolutionary spirit had
somewhat cooled; at present the Aryas
have become a sectarian group more or
less assimilated into larger Hindu

Asamanjasa
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, the only men-
tion of Asamanjasa describes how he
throws children into the Sarayu River
and then laughs as they drown.
Fortunately for the Solar Line, which is
one of the two great lineages,
Asamanjasa’s son Anshuman is very
virtuous, and the line continues both
unbroken and uncorrupted.

A man practices the fetus position.
This asana, or bodily posture,
is one of many that are used in yoga.

Asamanjasa
In Hindu mythology, the son of the
celebrated King Sagar and his wife
Keshini. Keshini has received a boon
that she will bear a single son through
whom the royal lineage will continue,
whereas her co-wife Sumati will bear
sixty thousand sons who will all die
before they are married. Asamanjasa is
that single son, but his character is so
bad that his lineage, the Solar Line,
seems to be in grave danger.
[[58]]

(“bodily posture”) In the ashtanga
(“eight-part”) yoga first codified by
Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), asana is the
third of the eight elements of yoga
practice and involves different body
postures. In his text, Patanjali asserts
that one’s physical position should be
stable and comfortable, since the
ultimate end of these postures is to
enable one to concentrate without
physical distractions. A series of posi-
tions for developing and training the
body evolved from this text. The most
familiar of these is the lotus posture
(padmasana).
These physical exercises are the
best-known feature of yoga and are
often confused with the larger prac-
tice of yoga itself. Although these
postures have definite physical bene-
fits, such as increased bodily flexibil-
ity, their ultimate purpose is to
enable one to sit for long periods in
meditation without physical distrac-
tions. As such, they are a necessary
element for progress on the spiritual
path but should not be confused with
the end goal.
In a more general context, the word
asana can refer to various ways of sit-
ting, and by extension to the thing
upon which one sits. In general the
object upon which one sits—particu-
larly for meditation or any sort of reli-
gious practice—is believed to be
charged with power because of its
association with spirituality. Many of
these objects, especially animal skins,
are believed to confer certain powers
and thus have symbolic meaning as well.Ascetic
In the context of worship, asana is
the second of the sixteen upacharas
(“offerings”) given to a deity as a way
of treating the god as an honored
guest. In this case asana refers to offer-
ing the deity a place to sit, one of the
most basic acts of human hospitality.
Asat
This word denotes a general category
in Indian speculative thought and is
often translated as “nonbeing.” It is
the absolute opposite of sat and is
formed by the addition of the negative
prefix. If sat is “that which (really and
truly) exists,” then its opposite is “that
which does not exist.” Since the word
sat also carries connotations of
Truth—that things that exist are both
“real” and “true”—asat carries conno-
tations of falseness.
Asatkaryavada
One of the three basic causal models in
classical Indian philosophy, along
with satkaryavada and anekantavada.
All three models seek to explain the
workings of causality in the everyday
world, particularly the relationship
between causes and their effects,
which has profound implications for
religious life. All of the philosophical
schools assume that if one under-
stands the causal process correctly
and can manipulate it through one’s
conscious actions, it is possible to gain
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
Thus disagreements over differing
causal models are not merely
academic disputes but are grounded
in varying assumptions about the
nature of things.
The asatkaryavada model assumes
that effects do not preexist in their
causes; that is, they are completely
and utterly distinct from them. In
the classic examples for this model,
one can create a clay pot by putting
together the two halves of the pot, or
one can weave a cloth from many
strands of thread. Each of these acts
creates a new object that did not previ-
ously exist, which came into being
through certain material and instru-
mental causes.
Since each act of creation brings a
new thing into being, this causal model
tends to multiply the number of objects
in the universe. It also admits that
human efforts and actions are part of the
causes influencing these effects, making
it theoretically possible to act in a way
that brings final liberation to the soul.
The disadvantage of this model
is that it can lead to philosophical
skepticism. As the world gets fragmented
into more and more causes—most of
which one cannot control—one can
easily believe that one’s actions will
have no discernible effect, even over
time. To counter this danger of
skepticism, asatkaryavada proponents
stress the conditions that govern
the causal process and gear people’s
efforts accordingly.
This model is espoused by the Nyaya
Vaisheshikas and the Prabhakara
school of Purva Mimamsa, as well as by
the Buddhists. For further information
see Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions
of India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Ascetic
In the most general sense, this word
denotes a person who has renounced
regular society and conventional social
life in a quest to seek religious
insight and to gain final liberation of the
soul (moksha). Such spiritual seekers
sometimes emphasize asceticism or
physical discipline, but this is not a
necessary element.
Ascetics can be organized into
different subgroups based upon
organizational affiliation or the
particular Hindu deity that they
worship. The Bairagis, Dashanami
Sanyasis, and Nathpanthis are all
well-defined ascetic organizations
into which one must undertake formal
initiation; the Bairagis are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and the
other two are devotees of Shiva.
[[59]]
Asceticism
The sadhu (“straight”) is the other
major type of ascetic and the most diffi-
cult to define. Most sadhus are unaffili-
ated with any religious organization,
have undertaken no formal ascetic initi-
ation, and fall outside the other groups’
sectarian boundaries. A sadhu is a soli-
tary religious seeker, driven to attain
religious goals by doing whatever seems
best to him (or more rarely, to her).
Asceticism
In the most general sense, this word
denotes physical discipline, most often
the renunciation of regular society and
conventional social life in a quest to
seek religious insight and to gain final
liberation of the soul (moksha).
Historically, ascetic practice has
stressed several constant themes. One of
the most common has been celibacy,
for a variety of reasons. Not only does
sexual enjoyment use the senses to trap
a person, but the attachments caused by
home and family are seen as a distrac-
tion to serious spiritual life. Yet the
emphasis on celibacy is also motivated
by the belief that semen is a man’s con-
centrated essence, and thus it is some-
thing to be carefully hoarded. Although
semen must be expended for procre-
ation, it should not be spilled casually
since this drains away a man’s vitality. It
is believed that energy gained from
celibacy leads to greater spiritual
accomplishment.
Another hallmark has been the prac-
tice of tapas, or physical asceticism,
under the assumption that enduring
physical hardship not only builds char-
acter but also generates spiritual power.
At times tapas can assume grotesque
forms of self-mutilation and mortifica-
tion. At other times it may be a milder
physical discipline, such as a form of
hatha yoga, to train the body and mind
for extended practice.
In general, ascetic spiritual develop-
ment can proceed along a variety of dif-
ferent paths, which often reflect the
abilities and inclinations of the ascetics
following them. Some paths have
[[60]]

stressed the importance of traditional
learning, some have stressed worship
and devotion, some have stressed phys-
ical asceticism, and some have stressed
meditation and individual realization.
In almost all cases, this spiritual training
takes place under the direction of a reli-
gious preceptor (guru), who takes
responsibility for the spiritual develop-
ment of his disciples.
Asceticism in India has a long and
venerable history, although there is
considerable disagreement regarding
how long and how venerable. The most
ambitious claim is that the Indian
ascetic tradition comes from the
religion of the Indus Valley civilization.
This claim is based on one of the Indus
Valley seals, an ancient artifact that
shows a figure sitting cross-legged as if
in meditation.
Whether or not one accepts this
claim, there is ample evidence of
asceticism in the Vedas, the earliest
Hindu scriptures. The Vedas mention
renunciant figures, such as the vratya,
yati, and muni, and also refer to
ascetics living in the forest. Indeed,
the very name of one stratum of the
Veda, the Aranyakas or “Forest
Books,” suggests that it was composed
by such ascetics. Buddhist and Jain lit-
erature clearly shows that ascetic life
was well established by the fifth centu-
ry B.C.E., as do some of the later upan-
ishads. All of these ascetics, whether
Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain, were desig-
nated under the umbrella term shra-
mana, a word whose basic meaning is
“to strive.” It is generally accepted that
there was religious tension between
the two dominant religious paradigms,
the Brahmana ideal connected with
Vedic religion and the shramana ideal
associated with asceticism. The
Brahmana ideal was based on sacri-
fice, mastery of complex sacred texts,
and hereditary priesthood; further-
more, it was so expensive that it virtu-
ally required royal patrons—all of
these factors rendering it the “estab-
lishment religion.” These concepts
clashed with the shramana ideal,Ashadh
which was renunciant, individualist,
and stressed inner experience.
By the time of the Dharma
Shastras (treatises on religious duty),
this tension had been somewhat
resolved; asceticism had been relegat-
ed to the last of the four ashramas
(stages of life), that of the Sanyasi. Yet
even here the tension remains, since
according to these texts, a twice-born
man cannot become a Sanyasi until he
has seen his children’s children, which
would make him well advanced in
years. These texts restrict asceticism to
twice-born men who have fulfilled
their obligations as householders, but
they deny it to women and low-caste
men. Needless to say, the actual pic-
ture has never been quite as neat as
the idealized society found in the
Dharma Shastras.
Organizationally, initiated Hindu
ascetics can be divided into several
major groups. One division is based on
the ascetics’ patron deity; the Shaiva
are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, and the
Vaishnava worship Vishnu.
The Kapalikas, Kalamukhas, and
Pashupatas are Shaiva ascetic groups
that have disappeared; the two Shaiva
groups that still survive are the
Dashanamis and the Nathpanthis. The
Dashanamis are the most prestigious of
all ascetics. They were supposedly orga-
nized by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya and have traditionally
emphasized learning. The Nathpanthis
trace their origin to Gorakhnath, a mir-
acle-working yogi about whom little
is definitely known. The Nathpanthis
are known for their stress on the
transformation of the physical body
through yoga.
Vaishnava ascetics are more recently
organized, and in northern India they
are broken into four groups (chatuh-
sampradayi Nagas), named after each
group’s reported founder: Ramananda
for the Ramanandis, Nimbarka for the
Nimbarkis, Chaitanya for the Madhva
Gaudiyas (Brahma Sampraday), and
Vishnuswami for the Vishnuswamis.
From at least the sixteenth century,
and perhaps much earlier, both the
Dashanamis and the Vaishnava ascetics
organized bands of fighters known as
Nagas (“naked”). These soldier-ascetics
were commissioned to protect the other
ascetics, but they also served as long-
distance traders and mercenary
soldiers. These Naga orders still exist
today, although they are no longer
prepared for battle. Another important
sect is the Udasis, who worship the
panchayatana (“five-fold”), a collection
of five Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu,
Durga, Ganesh, and Surya. Religiously
speaking, the Udasis thus fall between
the Shaivas and Vaishnavas.
In the past few centuries, reform-
minded ascetics have organized their
own ascetic bands, a process that still
continues today. For further informa-
tion see G. S. Ghurye, Indian Sadhus,

der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988. See also

Ashadh
According to the lunar calendar, by which
most Hindu religious festivals are cele-
brated, Ashadh is the fourth month in the
lunar year, usually falling within June and
July. In northern India, this is usually the
hottest month of the year.
The major holidays celebrated in
Ashadh are Yogini Ekadashi, the Rath
Yatra, Devshayani Ekadashi, and Guru
Purnima. Devshayani Ekadashi also
marks the beginning of the Chaturmas Vrat.
This is a four-month (lunar) period
generally coinciding with the rainy
season. During this time the god
Vishnu is believed to be “sleeping,”
and because of this the period is con-
sidered inauspicious.
[[61]]
Ashaucha
Men wash the body of a deceased man to prepare it for cremation.
A dead body is considered to be a potent source of ashaucha, or impurity.
Ashaucha
(“impurity”) Name for the ritual impurity
caused by contact with any source of pol-
lution; these sources come in many dif-
ferent guises, both physical and social.
Purity and impurity are religious
categories and thus fundamentally dif-
ferent from cleanliness and dirtiness,
which are hygienic categories. For
example, cow dung is considered a
pure substance in traditional Hindu
society and is smeared on patches of
ground to purify it. It is also important
to realize that impurity is a natural part
of life—as just one example, everyone
goes to the bathroom every day—and
that becoming impure carries no sense
of moral imperfection or lapse.
Most bodily fluids are considered pol-
luting; one becomes impure through any
activity involving them, such as urination,
defecation, sexual activity, giving birth, or
being born. One can become polluted
through contact with people or things
deemed impure, such as people of lower
social status, animals, any sort of ordinary
filth, or even the dust from the road.
[[62]]

Impurity can also be caused by social con-
nections. The impurity from childbirth
(sutakashaucha) obviously affects the
mother and child because of the bodily
fluids involved, but it also affects all other
members of the immediate family.
If a person has come into contact
with something polluting, the solution
is to remove the source of impurity. The
most common means of purification is
to bathe in running water, which
removes less virulent impurities by car-
rying them away with the water’s flow.
The purifying power of bathing (snana)
makes it a prelude to many religious
rituals, in which one of the general pre-
conditions is scrupulous purity, both
for the person performing the ritual
and the place where it is performed.
The most polluting substance of all
is a corpse, which is one reason why
bodies are destroyed by cremation on
the day of death. The impurity from
death (maranashaucha) is the most
violent impurity of all, and contact with
a corpse affects the entire family for ten
days after the death.Ashoka Tree

Kolenda, “Purity and Pollution,” in T. N.
Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Ashirvad
(“benedictory formula”) General term
used to denote words of blessing,
whether formal or informal. One of
the basic assumptions of Hindu reli-
gious life is that certain spiritually
powerful
people—in
particular,
ascetics and learned brahmins—can
confer blessings and curses at will.
Both the blessings and curses are
believed to take effect immediately
and without fail, which is why a pru-
dent person will always treat ascetics
and learned brahmins with the
respect that they deserve.
Ashoka
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.) The greatest ruler in
the Maurya dynasty, who reigned over a
kingdom stretching from Afghanistan to
southern India from his capital at
Pataliputra. Ashoka’s father, Bindusara,
and his grandfather, Chandragupta
Maurya, had created a centralized
empire. Aside from the far south, the
only area outside its influence was the
region known as Kalinga (modern state
of Orissa).
Early in his reign, Ashoka’s armies
conquered Kalinga in a bloody cam-
paign, killing hundreds of thousands of
people; the carnage had a profound
effect on the young Ashoka. Several
years later Ashoka formally adopted
Buddhism and embraced the principle
of nonviolence (ahimsa). As a result he
formally renounced war as a means
of conquest.
Early historians believed that
Ashoka used his royal power to make
Buddhism the state religion, but this
position appears to misread the evi-
dence. Ashoka did seem to be attracted
to Buddhism, but his public pro-
nouncements on “Dhamma,” earlier
identified with Buddhist teaching, seem
to have been aimed at creating a cli-
mate of social responsibility, tolerance,
nonviolence, and harmony. These were
qualities that most reasonable people
would endorse, and some historians
have suggested that such vague guide-
lines indicate an attempt to unify a reli-
giously diverse empire.
Ashoka is by far the best-known figure
of his era, largely because he set up public
inscriptions all over his kingdom. Rock
edicts tended to be carved on rock faces
close to the empire’s borders, while pillar
edicts were inscribed on pillars erected
on the main roads.
The writing used for these inscrip-
tions varied in different regions of the
empire, although the language for all
was a Prakrit, one of the grammatically
simple vernacular languages that devel-
oped from Sanskrit. These inscriptions
are the earliest written Indian docu-
ments of any historical significance;
they reveal a great deal about Ashoka’s
public persona, his exhortations to his
subjects, and even something about the
man himself.
In modern India, Ashoka is the model
for the enlightened ruler, and the
Ashokan pillar capped with four lions has
been adopted as the emblem of the mod-
ern republic of India.
Ashoka Tree
(Jonesia ashoka) Flowering tree tradi-
tionally associated with love and fertili-
ty. When in bloom, the Ashoka tree is
covered with red flowers—a color typi-
cally associated with passion—that con-
trast with its green foliage. According to
tradition, the ashoka tree will not bloom
until it has been kicked by a young
woman’s foot, implying the transfer of
her fertile energy to the tree.
The Ashoka tree is also famous in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. When Sita is kidnapped by
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, she
is imprisoned in a grove of Ashoka trees,
where she pines away waiting to be res-
cued by her husband Rama.
[[63]]
Ashram
Religious leader at an ashram in Puri.
Ashram
The abode of an ascetic or religious renun-
ciant. The word is derived from a form of
the verb “to strive” and has several different
meanings: On one hand, an ashram is also
a place where one gives up one’s conven-
tional worldly striving; on the other hand,
it is a place at which one can seriously
strive for spiritual goals that are often less
emphasized in the material world.
In modern Hinduism (both in India
and abroad) the word can refer to a full
spectrum of living arrangements, from
a simple hut or cave inhabited by one
person to magnificent building com-
pounds that can house thousands of
people at a time.
Ashrama
(“stages, abodes”) See stages of life.
Ashrama Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics who are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Shiva. The Dashanamis
were supposedly established by the ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life. Each of
the divisions is designated by a different
[[64]]

name—in this case, ashrama (“hermitage”).
Upon initiation, new members are given
this name as a surname to their new
ascetic names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths) sup-
posedly established by Shankaracharya,
as well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Ashrama Dashanamis belong
to the Kitawara group, which is affiliated
with the Sharada Math in the city of
Dwaraka, located near the Arabian Sea.
The Ashrama division is considered
an elite group because it is one of the few
that will initiate only brahmins (the
other such divisions are the Saraswati
Dashanamis, Tirtha Dashanamis, and
part of the Bharati Dashanamis.)
Ashtachap
(“eight seals”) A group of eight northern
Indian bhakti (devotional) poets:
Surdas, Krishnadas, Parmananddas,
Kumbhadas, Nanddas, Chaturbhujdas,
Chitswami, and Govindswami.
In the sectarian literature of the
Pushti Marg, a Vaishnava community
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of Krishna, all eight of these poets are
named as members of the sect and asso-
ciates of the Pushti Marg’s early leaders.
Surdas, Krishnadas, Parmananddas, and
Kumbhadas are connected with the
Pushti Marg’s founder, Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531); Nanddas, Chaturbhujdas,
Chitswami, and Govindswami are asso-
ciated with Vallabha’s son and successor,
Vitthalnath (r. 1566–1585). Evidence of
their membership can be found in their
poetry, which confirms this claim for
many of the poets; for Surdas, however,
this claim seems highly unlikely.
Ashtadhyayi
(“Eight Sections”) Text composed by the
Sanskrit grammarian Panini (ca. 4th c.
B.C.E.); the text’s name stems from theAshtanga (“eight-limbed”) Yoga
eight sections it contains. Panini wrote
the Ashtadhyayi as a descriptive account
of contemporary Sanskrit, but in later
generations the text was transformed
into the prescriptive norm for the lan-
guage. Each of the Ashtadhyayi’s eight
sections is composed of a series of brief
aphorisms (sutras), which are usually
only a few words long, and refers to a
specific facet of Sanskrit grammar. Each
sutra in a given section builds upon all
the preceding sutras, and in turn pro-
vides the foundation and background
for understanding those coming after it.
This sequential description means that
Panini began with Sanskrit’s most
general linguistic features and moved
from there to more specific ones. This
method allowed Panini to provide a
complete account of the Sanskrit
language as briefly as possible, and the
text’s condensed form facilitated memo-
rization. As with most sutra texts, the
Ashtadhyayi’s terseness of expression
presupposes a commentary, since the
sutras themselves are so short and pithy
that they are simply cryptic to the unini-
tiated. The Ashtadhyayi’s most famous
commentary is the Mahabhashya,
written by the grammarian Patanjali in
the second century B.C.E.
Ashtalakshmi
Eight different forms of the goddess
named Lakshmi, representing her dif-
ferent aspects as the source of wealth
and prosperity. The eight are often por-
trayed as a set, although one may also
encounter them separately: Vijaya (“vic-
tory”) Lakshmi, Jaya (“conquest”)
Lakshmi, Dhana (“wealth”) Lakshmi,
Dhanya (“grain”) Lakshmi, Gaja (“ele-
phant”) Lakshmi, Aishvarya (“divine
power”) Lakshmi, Vina (a musical
instrument) Lakshmi, and Raja (“royal”)
Lakshmi.
Ashtanga (“eight-limbed”) Yoga
System of yoga (religious discipline) tra-
ditionally ascribed to Patanjali (1st c.
C.E.?). This author is believed to be dif-
ferent than the grammarian Patanjali,
who wrote the Mahabhashya commen-
tary on Panini’s Sanskrit grammar.
Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are the basis
for the Yoga school of Indian philoso-
phy, one of the six schools. By the early
centuries of the common era (approxi-
mately 100–300 C.E.), the Yoga school
had become paired with the Samkhya
school. In this pairing, Samkhya provid-
ed the theoretical and metaphysical
explanations for the bondage and liber-
ation of the soul, while Yoga laid out the
concrete path for ending bondage and
gaining liberation.
Ashtanga yoga is made up of eight
parts, known as “limbs” (anga):
restraints (yama), observances (niyama),
bodily postures (asana), restraint of
breath (pranayama), withdrawal of the
senses (pratyahara), concentration
(dharana), meditation (dhyana), and
trance (samadhi).
Patanjali’s system is an eight-step
program for self-transformation, which
begins by cultivating certain whole-
some behavioral patterns (yama and
niyama). From there one progresses to
development and control of the mind,
which is considered a more subtle and
internalized practice. It culminates in a
mystic insight that brings liberation,
which in its original articulation is
described as yogic aloneness (kaivalya)
because Samkhya is atheistic.
Patanjali’s path shows general simi-
larities to another well-known program
for self-transformation, the Buddha’s
eightfold path. Although both Patanjali
and the Buddha are credited with origi-
nating their particular paths, it is likely
that they both drew from an existing
yogic tradition and shaped it to fit their
own assumptions.
Although Samkhya metaphysics
have long been discredited, the tech-
niques of the Yoga school are still vitally
important in modern Hindu religious
life. Many modern Hindu movements
stress yoga practice as a means of spiri-
tual discipline, purification, and self-
awareness. For further information see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles

Ashtavakra
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Ashtavakra
(“eight bends”) In the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics,
Ashtavakra is a sage who is the son of
Khagodara. According to tradition,
Ashtavakra is an exceptionally preco-
cious child, and this gets him into seri-
ous trouble. While he is still in his
mother’s womb, Ashtavakra corrects his
father’s pronunciation of a certain
mantra. In response his father curses
him to be bent, and when the child is
born he has eight bends in his body.
Despite his unusual appearance,
Ashtavakra becomes a learned sage and
is widely believed to be the author of the
Ashtavakragita (“Song of Ashtavakra”).
This text describes the philosophical
concept of monism, which is the belief
that a single Supreme Reality (named
Brahman) lies behind the entire uni-
verse, and that all things are merely dif-
fering manifestations of this reality.
Ashutosh
(“quickly satisfied”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. This name reflects Shiva’s rela-
tionship with his devotees (bhakta), as
well as his ultimate nature. When his
devotees approach him with sincerity,
he demands neither expensive offerings
nor prolonged worship, and he extends
his favor immediately. See Shiva.
Ashvalayana
Sage and author of one of the Grhya
Sutras, the manuals of domestic rites.
Ashvalayana’s work is one of the earliest to
mention the various life-cycle ceremonies
(samskaras) and is thus an important
source on these rites.
Ashvamedha
(“horse sacrifice”) Vedic sacrifice per-
formed to display and prove royal power.
In this sacrifice a specially consecrated
[[66]]

horse was released to roam as it wished,
followed by an armed band of the king’s
servants. When the horse wandered into a
neighboring ruler’s territory, that king had
two choices: He could either acknowledge
subordinate status to the king who
had released it, or he could attempt to
steal the horse, and do battle with the
king’s servants.
After one year of wandering, the horse
was brought back to the royal capital and
killed by suffocation or strangulation, so
that its blood would not be shed. After the
horse had been killed, the chief queen
would lie down next to it and simulate sex-
ual intercourse. When the instructions for
this ritual were first translated in the nine-
teenth century, this simulated intercourse
generated considerable horrified interest
among European scholars, even though it
was clearly a subsidiary part of the ritual.
The rite’s major emphasis was a cele-
bration of royal power, since the king per-
forming it was able to control the territory
covered in a year by a free-roaming horse.
The queen’s role, in contrast, seems aimed
at symbolically assuring the fertility of the
land. Historical records indicate that the
ashvamedha was performed until the
tenth century C.E. As with all other cases of
animal sacrifice, concerns about the
karmic consequences of slaughtering a
living being has been an important factor
in its discontinuation. See also karma.
Ashvattha
The sacred fig tree, Ficus religiosa, which
in modern times is more commonly
known as the pipal. The ashvattha is
especially noted for its aerial roots,
which extend downward from some of
the limbs until they touch the ground, at
which point they take root themselves.
Because their roots can become sub-
sidiary trunks, ashvattha trees can
grow to be enormous. They have tradi-
tionally been favored as places for
ascetics to dwell, in part because of their
sacred associations and in part because
their dense foliage provides shelter from
the elements.Assam
Their unusual structure is noted in
chapter fifteen of the Bhagavad Gita, in
which the ashvattha is described as the
tree of life. The ashvattha is also believed
to be the type of tree under which the
Buddha attained enlightenment.
Ashvatthama
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Ashvatthama is the
son of Drona. When Drona becomes the
archery teacher to the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the epic’s two central royal
families, Ashvatthama also receives
instruction along with the young
princes. He absorbs his father’s teaching
well and masters the use of terrifying
magical
weapons.
During
the
Mahabharata’s climactic civil war, he
fights on the side of the Kauravas and
kills many of the Pandava allies; this
includes Dhrshtadyumna, who has ear-
lier killed his father, Drona. After the war
is over, Ashvatthama retires to the forest
with the sage Vyasa.
Ashvin
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Ashvin is the seventh
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within September and October. In
Ashvin the monsoon rains usually
taper off, and the weather becomes a
bit cooler.
The dark (waning) half of this month
is the Pitrpaksha, one of the most
inauspicious times of the year. The
bright (waxing) half contains one of
the most important festivals of the year,
the fall Navaratri, culminating in
Dussehra or Vijaya Dashami. Other
festivals during this month are Indira
Ekadashi, Papankusha Ekadashi, and
Valmiki Jayanti.
Ashvins
Twin deities named Satya and Dasya,
who are sons of the god Surya (the Sun)
and the physicians to the gods. In the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, the Ashvins are the divine
fathers of the Pandava twins, Nakula
and Sahadeva. Nakula and Sahadeva are
born when their mother, Madri, uses a
powerful mantra enabling a woman to
have a child by any one of the gods;
as the sons of the divine physicians,
the epic portrays these twins as having
their fathers’ ability to heal. In the
Hindu lunar calendar, the month of
Ashvin (October–November) is devoted
to them.
Assam
Before Indian independence in 1947,
this name designated the entire territory
east of Bengal province in northeastern
India; in the time since independence, it
was divided into seven different admin-
istrative regions, one of which is the
contemporary state of Assam.
Like all other states in the northeast-
ern corner, much of modern Assam is
culturally distinct from the rest of India.
One marker of this cultural divide is lan-
guage: whereas most Indians speak lan-
guages from the Indo-Aryan or
Dravidian language families, many
tribal people in Assam speak Tibeto-
Burman languages. The bulk of modern
Assam is in the Brahmaputra River val-
ley, which is where most of the Hindus
in the northeast reside.
Despite its remoteness from the rest
of India, Assam does have one very
important sacred place, the temple of
the goddess Kamakhya just outside the
capital of Gauhati. This is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites con-
nected with the worship of the Mother
Goddess that were established at places
where it is believed that body parts of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth.
Kamakhya is considered the most power-
ful of all the Shakti Pithas since it is
believed to be where Sati’s vulva (a highly
charged female body part) fell to earth.
[[67]]
Asthi-Sanchayana
In the asthi-visarjana funeral ceremony, after cremation
the remains of a body are gathered and immersed in sacred water.
Asthi-Sanchayana
(“gathering the bones”) Name for a par-
ticular ceremony performed as one of
the last rites (antyeshthi samskara) con-
nected with death. Asthi-sanchayana is
usually performed on the second or third
day after cremation. In this rite, some of
the remains of the deceased—bits of
bone and ash—are gathered from the
site of the cremation pyre. These remains
are collected and kept in a safe place
until their final dispersal in the last of the
death rites, asthi-visarjana.
Asthi-Visarjana
(“scattering the bones”) Name for a partic-
ular ceremony performed as one of the last
rites (antyeshthi samskara) connected
with death. In this ritual, bits of bone and
ash collected from the cremation site in
the rite of asthi-sanchayana are immersed
in the waters of the Ganges or some other
sacred river. This is the final ceremony
for the dead, since in earlier times the
collected remains might be kept for years
before a family member was able to bring
them to a pilgrimage place (tirtha) to per-
form this rite. Modern transportation has
changed this pattern somewhat, making it
more common for asthi-visarjana to be
[[68]]

carried out immediately after death but
before the sapindikarana ceremony on
the twelfth day.
This rite is still widely performed in
modern India and remains important for
at least two reasons: On one hand, there is
the symbolism of redemption for the dead
through consigning their ashes to the
sacred waters, and on the other, providing
definitive ritual closure for the living.

Asura Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the Dharma Shastras,
the treatises on religious duty (dharma).
It is named after the asuras, a class of
powerful divine beings whose interests
are often at odds with those of the
gods (deva); thus, the name carries an
unfavorable connotation.
An asura marriage takes place when a
man gives money to the bride’s family and
the bride herself. This is one of the fourAtman
reprehensible (aprashasta) forms of mar-
riage because of the connotation that the
bride is being sold, yet like all the other
reprehensible forms, it is deemed to create
a valid marriage.
Despite this general disapproval, it is
one of the two classical forms that is still
practiced (the other being the Brahma
marriage), although because of the
stigma attached to the implication of
selling one’s child, it is only done by
people who are either very poor or of very
low social status. See also marriage, eight
classical forms.
Atala Akhara
The name of a subgroup of the Naga class
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, a particular
type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, organized into different
akharas, or regiments, based on the
model of an army. Until the beginning
of the nineteenth century, the Nagas
were known as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trading
interests; both of these occupations have
largely disappeared in contemporary
times. The Atala Akhara has traditionally
been considered a subsidiary of the
Mahanirvani akhara, at least for their
marching order in the bathing (snana)
processions for the Kumbha Mela. During
the 1998 Haridwar Kumbha Mela, the
Atala akhara demanded to be separated
from the Mahanirvanis and to be allowed
to march in their own procession; when
this request was turned down, the Atala
akhara boycotted the bathing processions
in protest. The Atala akhara is one of
the seven main Dashanami Naga
akharas, although it is now the smallest
and least important. All of the akharas
have particular features that define their
organizational identity, especially specific
guardian deities; the guardian deity of the
Atala akara is the god Ganesh.
Atharva Veda
The Atharva Veda is the last of the four
Vedas, which are the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts. In
many ways the Atharva Veda is the
most unusual. Whereas the other
three—Rg Veda, Sama Veda, and Yajur
Veda—focus mainly on sacrificial ritu-
als, the Atharva Veda is largely a collec-
tion of spells and incantations that can
be used to counter or correct misfor-
tune, and also to bring about one’s
desired result. Its unusual contents
make it very different from the other
three, and since some early sources
mention only the first three Vedas, it
apparently gained authority as a Veda
sometime later.
Atikaya
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Atikaya is one the sons
of the great demon Ravana by his wife
Mandodari. Like his father, Atikaya is
described as a great devotee (bhakta)
of Shiva and, because of his constant
devotion, he gains many wondrous
weapons and powers. Atikaya fights
bravely and valiantly in the war with
Rama’s army but is eventually killed by
Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
Atita
(“gone beyond”) In its most general
usage, this term denotes an ascetic
who has completely renounced all
things and thus “gone beyond” all the
social boundaries that enmesh normal
people. It is also the name of a partic-
ular low-caste community, some of
whom are ascetics and some of whom
are householders.
Atman
Reflexive pronoun in Sanskrit gram-
mar, that can be used for all three per-
sons in the singular and that carries
the sense of “self” or “oneself.” From
the time of the mystical texts known as
the Upanishads, the word atman has
also been used to designate each
human being’s inner essence—which
is eternal, unchanging, gives one

Atranji KheraAurangzeb
Architectural site near the city of
Aligarh that is located in the modern
state of Uttar Pradesh. Excavations at
Atranji Khera have revealed an ancient
urban center dating back to the sec-
ond millennium B.C.E. The settlements
here were not as developed as those in
the Indus Valley civilization, although
they are believed to be distinct from it
and thus another potential source for
ancient Indian culture.(r. 1658–1707) The last of the great
emperors in the Moghul dynasty, after
whose reign the empire, which at its

the “bad” Moghul emperor, as opposed
to his great-grandfather Akbar, the
“good” Moghul emperor. Aurangzeb
unquestionably ordered several notable
acts of iconoclasm, the most renowned
being the destruction of the Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares; however,
the records from his reign also include
orders that the Hindus of that city
should not be hindered from practicing
their religion.
One possible theory that reconciles
these contradictions is that the destruc-
tion of the Vishvanath temple and other
acts of iconoclasm were done for politi-
cal rather than religious reasons, to pun-
ish local populations for rebellion and
noncooperation. One piece of evidence
for this theory is that the year before the
destruction of the Vishvanath temple,
the Mahanirvani akhara in Benares took
part in a battle with Aurangzeb’s soldiers.
Atri
In Hindu mythology, Atri is one of the
six sons of Brahma, all of whom
become great sages. All are “mind-
born,” meaning that Brahma’s
thoughts are enough to bring them
into being. The others are Marichi,
Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
Atri is also cited as one of the seven
sages; the others are Kashyapa,
Bhrgu,
Vasishtha,
Gautama,
Bharadvaja, and Vishvamitra. All
brahmins are believed to be descended
from these seven sages, with each
family taking the name of its progeni-
tor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra
divisions are still important, since
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
After her marriage the new bride
adopts her husband’s gotra as part
of her new identity. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Aughar
Name given to a novice in the ascetic
community known as the Naths, who
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
An aughar has been initiated as a mem-
ber of the Naths and has taken up their
ascetic way of life, but he has not yet
received his final initiation. In this final

Aurobindo Ghose
(1872–1950) Freedom fighter, philoso-
pher, and ascetic yogi. He is perceived
as a modern example of the concern for
ultimate truth that always runs beneath
the surface of Hindu life.
Until he was twenty, Aurobindo
lived much of his life in England, to
fulfill his father’s desire to see his son
get a “proper” English education.
Upon his return to India, Aurobindo
was more interested in politics than in
working, and after a few years quit his
job to take part in the political struggleAvahana Akhara
against the British government. His
political career lasted only four years,
but his intellect and energy soon made
him a leader in the Bengali language
and national politics.
His life was transformed again by a
stay in prison, during which he
remembered the advice of an ascetic
who had told him to focus on his inner
self. Aurobindo later had a vision of
Swami Vivekananda, who guided his
yoga practice, and after he was
released from prison, Aurobindo with-
drew from political life. In 1910 he
moved to the French enclave of
Pondicherry in southern India, where
he lived until his death in 1950.
Aurobindo spent these years develop-
ing his spiritual life, and in his later
years he was known as Shri Aurobindo.
His teachings focus on the insights
found in the Upanishads, and stress
the development of true knowledge,
which leads to self-realization.
Auspiciousness
This is the general term for events or
conditions that cause or promote life,
prosperity, and overall well-being.
Along with purity and impurity
(ashaucha), auspiciousness and
inauspiciousness are fundamental
concepts in Hindu life.
The life-giving qualities connected
with auspiciousness make it a state
that Hindus pursue—whether through
performing rituals, scheduling impor-
tant events such as marriage cere-
monies for astrologically favorable
times, or avoiding people and things
deemed to be inauspicious. For exten-
sive information of auspiciousness
and its importance in Hindu life, see
Frederique Apffel Marglin, Wives of
the God-King, 1985.
Avadhi
Avadhi is a language known in two dif-
ferent contexts. In a literary context,
Avadhi is a dialect of medieval Hindi
(and a sister language of Braj Bhasha)
found in the eastern part of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, in the region sur-
rounding Ayodhya (Avadh). It is recog-
nized as the language in which the
poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?)
wrote his vernacular retelling of the
Ramayana, the Ramcharitmanas.
In a linguistic context, Avadhi is
one of the dialects of modern standard
Hindi spoken throughout the same
region. Although it shows similarities
to the language of Tulsidas, it has
evolved from that version.
Avadhuta
(“one who has cast away [all attach-
ments]”) In its most general sense,
an avadhuta is an ascetic who does
not adhere to any social or religious
rules but his (or far more rarely,
her) own. Needless to say, their
behavior is often unpredictable, seem-
ingly capricious, and sometimes
intentionally shocking.
As a more technical title, avadhuta
is a term of respect for the senior
members of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and who formerly
made their living as traders and
mercenary soldiers.
Avahana
(“summoning”) The first of the sixteen
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a
deity as part of worship, which is done
to treat the deity as an honored guest.
Although the literal translation of this
word (“summoning”) seems inappro-
priate for interacting with a god, the
true sense of the word is inviting the
deity to become present for worship,
just as one would invite a guest into
one’s house for hospitality.
Avahana Akhara
The name of a particular group of the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
which is comprised of renunciant

ascetics. The Dashanami Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into akharas, or regiments,
on the model of an army. Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century, the
Nagas’ primary occupation was as mer-
cenary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these occupations have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times.
The Avahana akhara is one of the
seven main Dashanami Naga akharas,
but for organizational purposes it is
considered a subsidiary of the Juna
akhara. Its name, which means “sum-
mons,” supposedly comes from its sta-
tus as the first organized ascetic group,
formed in response to the call from the
philosopher Shankaracharya to revital-
ize Hindu society.

Avani
Fifth month of the Tamil solar year,
which usually falls within August and
September. This month corresponds to
[[72]]

the northern Indian solar month of
Simha (the zodiacal sign of Leo). The
existence of several different calendars
is one clear sign of the continuing
importance of regional cultural pat-
terns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Avatar
(“descent”) In Hindu mythology, the
descent (of a deity), but more colloqui-
ally the incarnation, of a deity on earth.
The concept of avatars has been best
developed by the devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, who perceive him as
taking a specific form to help the world.
Examples of avatars can be found for
other divinities as well.
Hindus draw a distinction between
full avatars, which have the complete
power of the deity, and partial incarna-
tions, or anshavatars. Vishnu has ten
full avatars, each of whom has appeared
to restore the cosmic balance when theAvimukta
world has fallen out of equilibrium. The
root cause of such disequilibrium is usu-
ally a demon (asura) who has grown too
strong and uses that power to oppress
others. This imbalance prompts Vishnu
to take form as an avatar, destroy the
evildoers, and definitively restore the
cosmic balance.
Although there is some variation in
the list of Vishnu’s avatars, the generally
accepted list is as follows: Fish, Tortoise,
Boar, Man-Lion, Vamana (dwarf ),
Parashuram, Rama, Krishna, Buddha,
and Kalki. This list of avatars follows an
“evolutionary” sequence—the first three
are animals, the fourth a hybrid man-
animal, and the ones after that mythic
heroes and sages; the exception is the
Buddha, a real person who has been
incorporated into the Hindu pantheon.
The tenth form, Kalki avatar, is yet to
come, and his coming will herald the
end of the age. Vishnu’s partial avatars—
as sages, saints, and gods—are countless
and potentially limitless, providing a
ready-made way for new Hindu move-
ments to ascribe divine authority to
their founders.
Although the avatar concept is most
commonly associated with Vishnu, it
has been applied to other Hindu gods as
well. One example of partial avatars can
be seen in the Mahabharata, the later of
the two great Hindu epics, in which all
five of the Pandava brothers are partial
incarnations of various gods. In addi-
tion, devotees of the god Shiva have
developed a list of his twenty-one
avatars, who are saints, sages, and minor
deities. This list was probably developed
in response to the Vaishnava doctrine of
avatars, but Shiva’s forms are far less
important than Vishnu’s; Vishnu’s
avatars include Rama and Krishna,
who are major objects of worship in
their own right.
For the Vaishnavas, the avatar
doctrine is generally seen as a way
to assimilate existing cults into
the pantheon by claiming that
various deities are merely different
manifestations of Vishnu. The Shaiva
avatars were developed much later,
essentially so that Shiva would also
have these forms. See also Jagannath
and Balarama.
Avidya
(“lack of [true] knowledge”) Avidya is
the absence of true understanding
and is the fundamental problem in
almost all Hindu philosophical and
religious thought. The presence of
avidya leads people to misperceive the
true nature of reality and to act based on
these misperceptions.
The most fundamental of these false
perceptions is to identify the eternal Self
(atman) with the body. As a result of this
misidentification, egoism leads one to
try to protect and advance the Self (in its
particular embodied state) and incites
feelings and actions of greed, lust, and
hatred. These feelings create bondage
for the soul and entrap it in samsara, the
cycle of rebirth.
In most Hindu philosophical
schools, the avidya tends to be con-
ceived in epistemological rather than
metaphysical terms—that is, it is not an
actual thing in its own right but exists
as a function of how one comes to
know things, insofar as that knowledge
is inaccurate or incomplete. Once one’s
deficient awareness has been corrected,
the cause of bondage is removed,
resulting in the final liberation of the
soul (moksha).
Avimukta
(“unforsaken”) The word Avimukta
carries two shades of meaning: in a
more general sense, it is a name for the
city of Benares; in a more specific sense,
it refers to the part of Benares consid-
ered to be the sacred heart of the city, in
the region centered around the
Vishvanath Temple.
Avimukta gets its name from the
belief that Shiva never leaves this
place, and because of this its proponents
claim that it is the holiest spot on earth.
See Benares.

Avvaiyar
Avvaiyar
Poet whose compositions appear in
the Sangam literature, which are col-
lections of Tamil poems written and
compiled in the early centuries of the
common era (approximately 100–300
C.E.). Avvaiyar is notable as a female
poet, indicating that certain women at
that time took an equal part in cul-
tured and intellectual society. See also
Tamil language.
Ayamatma Brahman
(“This Self is Brahman”) In the Hindu
philosophical tradition, one of the
“great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth. The truth
here is the identity of atman (the indi-
vidual Self ) and Brahman (Ultimate
Reality); this identity is the heart of the
mystical texts called the Upanishads.
Aside from their importance in a
philosophical context as fundamental
truths, four mahavakyas were also
appropriated as symbols by the four
divisions of the Dashanami Sanyasi
ascetics. Each division had its own
mahavakya, just as each had a differ-
ent Veda, a different primary sacred
center, and a different ascetic quality.
Ayamatma Brahman is the mahavakya
associated with the Anandawara divi-
sion of the Dashanami Sanyasis.
Ayana
(“going”) In the estimation of the
Hindu calendar, the word ayana refers
to the movement of the sun during its
yearly course, which is divided accord-
ing to the direction of the sun’s move-
ment. The six months that the sun
moves in a northerly direction is called
the uttarayana, and its southward
movement in the following six months
is the dakshinayana. The transition
points at which the sun changes direc-
tion do not fall on the solstices, as fig-
ured in the Gregorian calendar, but
about three weeks later on Makara
Sankranti (around January 14) and
Karka Sankranti (around July 14).
[[74]]

The sun’s northward journey is
considered a more auspicious time
than the southward journey, although
many other factors can influence the
judgment of a particular day.
Ayodhya
(“unassailable”) Sacred city (tirtha) on
the Sarayu River, in the Faizabad dis-
trict of the state of Uttar Pradesh, and
one of India’s seven sacred cities.
Ayodhya is famous as the setting for
much of the Ramayana, the later of
the two great Hindu epics, whose prin-
cipal character is the god Rama. In the
Ramayana, Ayodhya is the capital city
of Rama’s father, King Dasharatha, the
birthplace and childhood home of
Rama and his brothers, and the city to
which Rama returns in triumph after
his exile is over.
Although historians have raised
doubts about the Ramayana’s histori-
cal veracity and the reality of the
events described there, Rama’s devo-
tees (bhakta) entertain no such
doubts. For them the cult of Rama is
deeply entrenched in Ayodhya, and
various places in the city are associated
with events in the epic that are
believed to have actually occurred.
In most cases this has had no ill
effects, with the exception of the Ram
Janam Bhumi, the site identified as
Rama’s birthplace. Until 1992, this site
was occupied by the Babri Masjid, a
Muslim mosque supposedly built after
the existing temple was demolished.
On December 6 of that year, the
mosque was destroyed by teams of
activists from the Vishva Hindu
Parishad, who tore it down in just over
six hours. The destruction sparked
Hindu-Muslim riots all over India, in
which thousands of people were killed.

Ayudhapurusha
An ayudhapurusha is the personified
form of a divine weapon or emblem,
which is conceived as either mascu-
line, feminine, or neuter according to
the gender of the Sanskrit word. For
example, the words shakti (“spear”)
and gada (“club”) are portrayed as
feminine, chakra (“discus”) as neuter,
and khadga (“sword”) and trishul
(“trident”) as male.
Ayurveda
(“knowledge of life”) Ayurveda is
the best known of the indigenous
Indian medical systems and is
primarily based on the two Sanskrit
medical texts: the Charaka Samhita
(1st c. C.E.) and the Sushruta Samhita
(4th c. C.E.).
The underlying assumption in both
of these texts and in ayurveda is the
theory of the three bodily humors—
vata (wind), pitta (bile), and kapha
(phlegm). Each of these is composed
of different elements, and although
everyone has all three humors, their
relative proportions are used to
explain varying body types, metabolic
dispositions, and personalities.
People in whom vata predominates
are said to have quick minds, slender
bodies, and to be full of energy, but
they are also said to get run down
more easily than others. Pitta-domi-
nant people are said to be strong-
willed and good leaders but also
hot-tempered and bothered by heat.
Kapha-dominant people are strong,
healthy, and stable but also have ten-
dencies toward lassitude and inertia.
Each of these humors can thus
have both wholesome and unwhole-
some manifestations, but when the
humors are in relative balance, the five
bodily winds (prana) that are consid-
ered responsible for basic bodily func-
tions will work effectively, and the
person will be healthy.
According to ayurveda, disease is
caused by an imbalance of these
humors that usually has perceivable
environmental roots. One possible
cause is environmental circum-
stances, such as the stresses that the
differing seasons (hot, cold, damp,
etc.) put on varying constitutions.
The other possible cause for an
imbalance is the person’s own
behavior—improper diet, poor sleep
habits, deficient or inappropriate
bodily exertion, and other habitual
stresses on the body.
In ayurveda, people are conceived
as beings in interaction with their
environment, and ayurveda’s propo-
nents recognize that many ailments
may have multiple causes. The ulti-
mate aim of any treatment, whether
diet, exercise, or medicine, is to restore
this lost equilibrium. The equilibrium
being sought will be different for
everyone, since it will necessarily
reflect each person’s individual make-
up. For further information see Gopi
Warrier, The Complete Illustrated
Guide to Ayurveda, 1997; and Judith
Morrison, The Book of Ayurveda, 1995.

Baba
## B
Baba
In its literal meaning, an affectionate
term of address meaning “father.”
Although this can be used to address
any older man, it is most commonly
applied to ascetics, either in speaking of
them as a class or as a respectful way to
address a particular one.
Babar’s Mosque
See Babri Masjid.
Babri Masjid
(“Babar’s Mosque”) Mosque built in
[[1528]]
 on the outskirts of the city of
Ayodhya, which was constructed at the
order of Mir Baqi, a general of the
Moghul emperor Babar (1483–1530).
The site has long been a source of con-
troversy between the Hindu and Muslim
communities, and British sources
recorded conflicts there in 1855 and
[[1934]]
. Local tradition holds that the
mosque was built on the birthplace of
the Hindu deity Rama, and that it was
constructed only after demolishing the
Hindu temple there, although there is
little hard evidence for the latter claim. A
few months after India gained indepen-
dence in 1947, several local Hindus sur-
reptitiously installed images of the child
Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother
Lakshmana; they spread the tale that
the images had miraculously appeared
in a ball of light. The government had
only recently quieted the Hindu-Muslim
massacres that accompanied the divi-
sion of British India into India and
Pakistan, and it was reluctant to rein-
flame religious passions. Its solution was
to padlock the compound’s gates and
[[76]]

send the case to the courts for resolu-
tion, where it languished for almost
forty years.
The early 1980s saw renewed contro-
versy over the site, when the Hindu reli-
gious organization Vishva Hindu
Parishad (VHP) first began calling for its
“liberation” and proclaiming that the
existing structure was an insult to all
Hindus. This campaign portrayed the
mosque as a symbol of Muslim icono-
clasm. Moreover, it depicted govern-
ment efforts to protect the mosque as an
attempt to appease the Muslim commu-
nity and retain their votes. In 1986 the
VHP’s drive to liberate the site was aided
by the national government headed by
Rajiv Gandhi, which in a patent attempt
to claim Hindu support, unlocked the
compound’s gates so that Hindus could
worship on the site.
The pressure intensified as the
decade progressed, culminating in a
series of campaigns to begin construct-
ing a Hindu temple on the site. Many of
these campaigns coincided with national
elections, and the emotion they generat-
ed helped benefit the electoral fortunes
of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a political
party with close ties to the VHP.
Eventually, on December 6, 1992, the
mosque was demolished. The whole
operation was carefully planned; the
demolition teams were highly trained,
and the first thing they did was to
destroy all the television cameras there
to prevent any media coverage by out-
siders. It was carried out with the bless-
ing of the state government, which
made no attempt to protect the build-
ing. The demolition was followed by
riots, particularly in the state of
Maharashtra, in which over three
thousand people were killed, most of
them Muslims.
Even after the destruction of the
Babri Masjid, the site remained a bone
of contention. Immediately following
the demolition, Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao promised to rebuild the
mosque on the same spot, but he did
nothing to accomplish this during his
time in office. Various Hindu groups,Badrinath

including traditional religious leaders
such as the Shankaracharyas, have
been calling for the construction of the
Ram Janam Bhumi temple at the site.
Anticipating nothing but trouble ahead,
the government again has sent the mat-
ter to the courts for resolution, where it
remains to this day and may remain for
four more decades. For further informa-
tion see Sarvepalli Gopal, Anatomy of a

are particularly concerned with the
ideas about the Supreme Reality known
as Brahman, they are also called the
Brahma Sutras. The brevity of the indi-
vidual sutras—many are only a few
words—presupposes
commentary,
which was later provided by various
writers. Badarayana himself considered
the Upanishads the ultimate source for
his teachings, although his text was
judged equally authoritative by later
Vedanta writers.
BadarayanaBadrinath
(ca. 400–200 B.C.E.) Philosopher tradi-
tionally cited as the author of the
Vedanta Sutras. This collection of 555
brief sutras, or aphorisms, is the basis of
the philosophical school known as
Vedanta, so named because it claims to
reveal the ultimate meaning of the reli-
gious scriptures known as the Vedas.
The sutras attempt to summarize and
systematize the philosophic and reli-
gious ideas in the Upanishads, the spec-
ulative texts that form the latest stratum(“Lord of Badri”) Sacred site (tirtha) in
the Himalayan area of Chamoli district
in the state of Uttar Pradesh, near the
headwaters of the Alakananda River,
the largest tributary of the Ganges.
Badrinath is high in the mountains at an
altitude of over 10,000 feet. It is connected
to Tibet by the Mana Pass, one of the tra-
ditional land routes by which Chinese
goods have come into India. Badrinath’s
high altitude also means that it is only
accessible between late April and
[[77]]
Bahi
October, after which it is closed for the
winter months; this pattern is echoed at
Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath,
the three major Himalayan pilgrimage
sites. The town’s name comes from its
presiding deity, Vishnu, whose temple
is the reason for the site’s existence. The
main image in the temple is claimed to
have miraculously emerged full-formed
from a shalagram, a particular type of
black stone containing fossilized
ammonite, which is itself considered a
“self-manifested” form of Vishnu.
Badrinath has a long history as a ven-
erable sacred site. Scholars believe that
it was occupied by a Buddhist temple
until several centuries into the present
millennium, based on the architecture
of some of the temple’s older parts. Local
tradition reports that until the middle of
the twentieth century when the Chinese
sealed the Tibetan border, Buddhists
came from Tibet for the temple’s closing
rites in the fall, bringing a hand-woven
blanket to drape around the image. In
Hinduism, Badrinath is one of the four
dhams (“divine abodes”) connected
with the philosopher Shankaracharya.
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one
Hindu sacred center in each corner of
the subcontinent to combat the spread
of Buddhism and revitalize Hindu reli-
gion. At each center he established a
Dashanami Sanyasi monastic center
(math) to train learned monks.
Badrinath is associated with the sacred
center Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath, forty miles south.
Each winter, the image at Badrinath is
symbolically transported to the
Narasimha temple in Joshimath.
According to Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years tem-
ple worship was performed by the
Dandi Sanyasis; they were a group of
ascetics devoted to the god Shiva who
were also Nambudiri brahmins, the
same caste into which Shankaracharya
is supposed to have been born. When
the last of these ascetics died without a
successor in 1776, the local king who
served as the protector of the shrine
invited a non-ascetic Nambudiri brahmin
[[78]]

to serve as the temple’s priest. In defer-
ence to his ascetic predecessors, this
priest was given the title rawal
(“deputy”), and his extended family has
run the shrine since then. The rawal is
the only person allowed to touch the
image, and as a consequence he is
required to remain a bachelor, lest the
ritual impurity (ashaucha) arising from
the birth of a child (sutakashaucha)
render him unable to attend to his
duties. For a long time, the rawals had
sole rights to the offerings given at the
shrine, but since 1939 the temple has
been managed by a committee, and the
rawal has been restricted to ritual duties.
Bahi
(“account book”) Name for the pilgrim
registers maintained by hereditary pil-
grimage priests (pandas). Each panda
family in any sacred site (tirtha) has the
right to serve pilgrims whose ancestral
homes are in a particular place, whether
or not the pilgrims still reside there. For
example, a family from the Marwar
region of the state of Rajasthan will
always be served by the Marwari panda,
even if the family has not lived in
Marwar for generations. Pilgrims make
an entry in their panda’s pilgrim register
during each visit, in which they write
down the date, the names of those who
visited, and the reason or reasons for
which they have come. These details are
noted on a thick sheet of paper about
ten inches wide and three feet long, and
there may be multiple entries on a page.
One of the page’s narrow sides has holes
punched in it, and a string can be
threaded through these holes to tie a
number of such sheets together. This
allows the panda to compile registers for
a particular village or specific family,
and when not in use these bahis are
rolled into a circle and tied.
These registers provide not only a
record of pilgrim visits, but are also the
unassailable evidence of the hereditary
connection between a panda and a pil-
grim family. Most pilgrims will demand
to see the entries for their ancestors asBahula Chauth
proof that a particular priest is their
hereditary panda. This usually happens
when many years have elapsed between
visits, and the pilgrims may never have
met their panda in person. A panda’s
bahis are thus the sole proof of his rights
to a particular pilgrim group, which
makes these registers extremely valu-
able documents. Most pandas zealously
safeguard their bahis, since anyone with
a copy can claim the pilgrims therein.
The bahis’ importance also gives them a
high market value. They may be used as
collateral to gain a loan and can even be
sold outright. This latter course is
extremely unusual, since for working
pandas their bahis are not only the
source of their livelihood, but also their
family inheritance.
Bahina Bai
(1628–1700) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Bahina Bai ran counter to
contemporary assumptions not only
because she was a female religious fig-
ure, but also because she was a brahmin
disciple of the shudra poet-saint
Tukaram, an association that inverted
the usual patterns of social status. This is
because a brahmin is someone of high
social standing while a shudra is of the
lowest and least influential class in
Hindu society. According to tradition,
Tukaram initiated Bahina as his disciple
in a dream because Bahina’s husband—
a learned brahmin who was highly con-
scious
of
brahmin
status—had
forbidden her to meet with him. Aside
from her devotional poetry, Bahina also
wrote an autobiography, whose content
was heavily influenced by her religious
beliefs. Bahina is notable as one of the
only women bhakti (devotional) figures
who was able to reconcile the demands
of her marriage with her commitment to
God, although these issues were not
resolved without considerable trouble
and heartache. For further information
see Justin E. Abbott (trans.), Bahina Bai,
[[1985]]
; and Anne Feldhaus, “Bahina Bai:
Wife and Saint,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 50, 1982.
Bahiryaga
(“external sacrifice”) In Hindu worship,
especially in esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, bahiryaga refers to any
type of religious practice involving
actions, words, or the manipulation of
concrete objects. This is the only kind of
worship that most people perform. The
ultimate goal in tantra, however, is to
internalize these acts through repeated
practice and to transform them into
antaryaga (“internal sacrifice”), in
which all external actions have been
replaced by mental acts.
Bahudaka
(“having much water”) The name for
one of four particular types of Hindu
ascetics. Each of these four types
reflects the ascetic’s supposed means of
livelihood, which in practice has been
much less important for ascetic identity
than organizational affiliation. The
Bahudaka is an ascetic who begs for his
food at sacred bathing places. The other
three types are the Kutichaka, which
has lower status than the Bahudaka, and
the Hamsa and Paramahamsa, which
have higher status.
Bahula Chauth
Religious festival celebrated on the
fourth day (chauth) of the dark, or wan-
ing, half of the lunar month of
Bhadrapada, the sixth month of the
lunar year, which usually falls within
August and September. On this day
mothers perform duties for the welfare
of their sons. They should refrain from
all activity and from eating wheat or rice
(the staple food grains). As a symbolic
indication of allowing mothers to care
for their children, on this day cows are
not milked, and their calves are allowed
to suckle as much as they want.
[[79]]
Baiga
A baiga, or healer, uses spiritual techniques to remedy a person’s physical or emotional troubles.
Such motherly concern for their sons
reflects not only normal maternal
instincts but the importance of male
children in traditional Hindu life.
According to the customary pattern, at
least in northern India, daughters leave
their natal homes to live with their
husbands’ families, whereas sons bring
their brides into the family home. One’s
sons thus ensure the continuity of
the family, in addition to taking care of
the parents in their old age. Sons are
also important because only they can
perform the annual shraddhas, or
memorial rites to the ancestors,
although couples without any natural
sons can satisfy this requirement
through adoption.
Baiga
[[80]]

(probably a corruption of the word
vaidaga, or “healer”) A sorcerer, healer,
and ritual technician connected with
spirits at the lower levels of the pan-
theon; a baiga sometimes acts as a
medium for village deities and at other
times as an exorcist for witches, bhuts,
and prets. A baiga’s power is based on
his command of mantras, sacred
sounds either acquired from a relative as
his hereditary birthright or bought from
a knowledgeable person. Baigas minis-
ter to people’s immediate troubles,
whether caused by illness, misfortune,
accident, or alleged possession. This
pervasive connection with people’s
everyday concerns makes them impor-
tant figures in urban as well as rural
India. The most successful baigas are
those who radiate the greatest air of
authority, and thus instill in their
patients the confidence that the baiga
can and will alleviate their distress. For a
short account of the baiga’s work, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; for a more developed perspective
on Indian healers and healing, see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Baijnath
Sacred site (tirtha) and archeological
area in the Himalayan foothills of the
state of Uttar Pradesh, about forty-Baithak
five miles north and west of the town of
Almora. Baijnath contains a temple
complex believed to date from the thir-
teenth century C.E. Many of the temples
are quite well-preserved, although only
one is still used as a place of worship.
Although the name of the site is a ver-
nacular form of Vaidyanath, a form of
the god Shiva, the presiding deity in the
temple is Shiva’s wife Parvati. Her main
image is over four feet tall and is a mag-
nificent work of art, carved from a piece
of rose-colored granite. Smaller figures
carved into the image itself illustrate the
mythic story of Shiva’s wife Sati, her
rebirth as Parvati, and Parvati’s remar-
riage to Shiva. The statue is clearly the
work of a master sculptor, and it far
exceeds the quality of the artwork one
normally finds in such isolated places.
Another temple in a nearby village has a
statue of Vishnu made from a similar
type of stone and carved in a similar
style. The simplest explanation for this
correspondence is that a single
sculptor was commissioned to create
both images.
Bairagi
(“dispassionate”) This is the general
name for any ascetic whose patron deity
is Vishnu, but it is particularly applied to
the fighting ascetics known as Nagas. See
also Chatuh-Sampradayi Nagas.
Baisakh
According to the lunar calendar by
which most Hindu religious festivals
are determined, Baisakh is the second
month of the lunar year, usually falling
within April and May. This is estab-
lished as one of the months of spring,
but in northern India the weather is
beginning to get quite warm at this
time, especially in the middle of the
day. The major holidays in Baisakh are
Shitalashtami, Baruthani Ekadashi,
Parashuram Jayanti, Narasimha
Jayanti, Baisakhi, Mohini Ekadashi,
and Buddha Purnima.
Baisakhi
Annual festival taking place in the
lunar month of Baisakh (April–May),
for which it is named. Baisakhi marks
the sun’s transition into Aries, which
according to the Indian estimation
occurs around April 14. This festival
marks the beginning of the solar year
on the traditional calendar. Baisakhi
is celebrated mainly in the north, par-
ticularly in the state of Punjab and its
surrounding regions. In the days when
pilgrims still traveled through the
Himalayas on foot, this festival
marked the beginning of the
Himalayan pilgrimage season; during
the eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies, Baisakhi was the occasion for
a great trading festival in the town of
Haridwar, the gateway to the
Himalayan shrines. Although this fair
has long been eclipsed, Baisakhi is
still the climactic bathing (snana)
day for the Haridwar Kumbha Mela
and Ardha Kumbha Mela, each of
which is a bathing festival that occurs
about every twelve years when
Jupiter is in the sign of Aquarius (for
the Kumbha Mela) or Leo (for the
Ardha Kumbha Mela).
Baithak
(“seat”) In the Vaishnava sect
known as the Pushti Marg, a reli-
gious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Krishna, the baithaks are a group of
[[108]]
 sacred sites (tirthas). Each site
is somehow associated with the life
and activities of the philosopher
Vallabhacharya, the Pushti Marg’s
founder. Most of these baithaks are
in well-established sacred areas that
were considered holy long before
Vallabhacharya’s time, but the char-
ter story for each baithak records
some activity of the philosopher in
that particular place, to further
sanctify it for his followers. These
baithaks create a sectarian network
within the existing pilgrimage
[[81]]
Bajrang Dal
places and imbue each one with
additional significance for the
Pushti Marg.
Bajrang Dal
(“Hanuman’s Host”) The Bajrang Dal
is a modern Hindu organization that
has strong connections with the Hindu
nationalist Vishva Hindu Parishad
( VHP ), although both are nominally
independent. The Bajrang Dal is
sometimes characterized as the VHP’s
“youth wing,” and its primary function
is to aid the VHP in carrying out its reli-
gious, political, and social campaigns,
particularly by supplying members to
build a crowd. The god Hanuman is
best noted for his prodigious strength,
and it is this quality that the Bajrang
Dal seems to have emphasized in
choosing him as their symbol.
Membership is open to young men
from all social strata, but the organiza-
tion reportedly draws much of its fol-
lowers from lower-caste groups.
Although local chapters of the Bajrang
Dal often perform social services and
philanthropic activities (as one might
find with any organized group), as a
whole the organization is widely seen
as an instrument of the VHP, to be used
when the situation calls for producing
a crowd, intimidation, or violence.
Baka
In Hindu mythology, a demon killed by
the god Krishna during Krishna’s
childhood in Braj. Baka is one of the
demon assassins sent by Krishna’s
wicked uncle, Kamsa, to try to get rid
of the god. He comes to Braj in the
form of a giant crane (baka) and swal-
lows Krishna and his companions, but
he is killed when Krishna expands to
such a giant size in Baka’s stomach that
the demon explodes.
Bakasur
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Bakasur is a fero-
[[82]]

cious man-eating demon. To preserve
their lives, the local villagers send
Bakasur a daily sacrificial victim who
is chosen by lot, along with a wag-
onload of food that the demon also
eats. One day the lot falls to the brah-
min who is hosting the Pandavas, the
five heroic brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. When the brothers’
common wife, Draupadi, discovers
what has happened, she asks one of
the brothers, Bhima, to deliver the
food in the brahmin’s place. Bhima
drives the wagon to the cave, goads
the demon into battle by eating the
food in front of him, and then slays
Bakasur with one mighty blow.
Baksheesh
(from the Persian word bakhshidan,
meaning “to give”) A gift, usually of
money, given to facilitate service. This
is usually paid in advance but can also
be given after the fact. In some cases
this is unabashed bribery, but most
often it is simply a way to ensure con-
tinuing service and attention, or a gra-
tuity for services already rendered.
Balabhadra
Epithet of the mythic hero Balarama,
the god Krishna’s older brother.
Although he is a fairly minor mythic
figure, he is important for his connec-
tion with the temple of Jagannath in
the city of Puri. The temple’s presid-
ing deity is Jagannath (“Lord of the
World”), a tribal god who has been
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon
as a form of Krishna. The image of
Jagannath appears together with two
other images, Balabhadra and their
sister Subhadra, and the three deities
invariably appear as a group.
The poet Jayadeva, in his list of the
ten avatars (“divine incarnations”)
typically associated with the god
Vishnu, named Balabhadra as the
eighth avatar, the place normally
occupied by Krishna. According to
Jayadeva, Jagannath/Krishna is not aBalarama
form of Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality
from whom all the avatars spring.
Balaji
Popular epithet of the god Venkateshvara,
the presiding deity of the temple of the
same name at Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh. See Venkateshvara.
Balaji
(2) Presiding deity of the Balaji temple
in Mehndipur village, Rajasthan, who
is considered a form of the monkey-
god, Hanuman. As an infant, Hanuman
is continually hungry, and one day he
attempts to eat the sun. Indra, the king
of the gods and ruler of heaven, is
incensed at Hanuman’s action and
strikes him with a thunderbolt, break-
ing his jaw (hanu). The wind-god, who
is Vayu, Hanuman’s father, goes on
strike to protest this punishment. Since
in traditional Indian physiology, winds
are considered responsible for all inter-
nal functions, including digestion, res-
piration, and elimination, Vayu’s strike
means that no one can live a normal
life. After a short time, the gods realize
their predicament and beg Vayu for for-
giveness; the deity is placated when
each of the gods promises to give
Hanuman a divine gift. By virtue of
these gifts, Hanuman gains great
power; not only is he immensely
strong, but he is an expert healer,
through both his skill in using herbs
and natural medicines and his magical
abilities to protect people from malev-
olent supernatural beings.
These powers and healing qualities
make Hanuman a strong protective
deity, and he is often worshiped on days
and at times deemed inauspicious or
unfavorable. These protective attributes
have made him enormously important
in contemporary Hindu life despite
his theoretically intermediate place in
the divine pantheon, and these qualities
are especially evident in his form as
Balaji. His temple has gained regional
prominence as a healing center for
people possessed by malevolent spirits
known as bhuts and prets. The
exorcisms proceed in a quasi-judicial
fashion, with the spirits being hauled
into the divine court, tried, and
banished from the sufferer with the
underlying assumption that these rites
succeed through Balaji’s irresistible
healing powers. As Sudhir Kakar has
masterfully shown, the language associ-
ated with possession and exorcism,
when understood in the context of tradi-
tional Hindu culture, can be seen as
a way of describing what modern
psychiatrists might call the diagnosis
and treatment of mental illness. See
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Balakrishna
Figure of Krishna in the form of a child
(bala). Devotees (bhakta) who worship
this form of Krishna are partaking in the
devotional relationship known as
vatsalya bhava, which parallels the
connection between parent and child.
The unusual twist is that the devotee
takes the role of the parent, lavishing
love and care on the deity in its child
form in a warm, protective, and
intimate relationship.
Balarama
Krishna’s older brother. According to
most estimations, Balarama is a partial
avatar, or incarnation, of Shesha, a ser-
pent upon whom the god Vishnu
reclines as on a couch. Shesha takes
human form as Balarama, and Vishnu
takes human form as Krishna, to destroy
the evil king Kamsa. Kamsa has impris-
oned their parents, Vasudeva and
Devaki, because on their wedding day a
disembodied voice has foretold that
Devaki’s eighth child will kill Kamsa.
Kamsa kills Devaki’s first six children at
birth by flinging them onto stones, but
Balarama is saved when the embryo in
Devaki’s womb is magically transplant-
ed into the womb of Vasudeva’s second
wife, Rohini. Because of the unusual

Hinduism was introduced to Bali by merchants and traders,
where it was transformed by the influence of both Buddhist and indigenous religious beliefs.
circumstances surrounding his develop-
ment in utero, Balarama is also known
as Sankarshana (“dragging away”).
Balarama is raised with Krishna in
Nanda and Yashoda’s household and
takes part in many of Krishna’s adven-
tures, including the slaying of Kamsa.
Balarama is usually portrayed as hav-
ing a fair complexion, whereas Krishna
is dark. According to one story, when the
gods approach Vishnu to take form on
earth, he plucks both a white hair and a
black hair from his head. The former is
born to Rohini as Balarama, the latter to
Devaki as Krishna.
Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda presents a
different picture of Balarama. Jayadeva
is closely linked to the Jagannath tem-
ple in Puri, whose presiding deity
(Jagannath) has been assimilated into
the pantheon as Krishna. For Jayadeva,
Jagannath/Krishna is not a form of
Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality from
whom all the avatars spring. Jayadeva
incorporates Balarama into the pan-
theon as the eighth avatar, to fill the
[[84]]

place left by Krishna’s promotion to
supreme god.
Bali
In Hindu mythology Bali is a demon
who is tricked by Vishnu into granting
the god three paces of land of his own.
Bali does this with little thought because
Vishnu has come in the form of a dwarf
(vamana), but when the gift has been
given, Vishnu grows immensely large
and claims the whole universe, relegat-
ing Bali to the Patala underworld. See
also Vamana avatar.
Bali
(2) In Hindu mythology, a monkey-king
in the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics. Bali and Sugriva are
brothers who together rule the kingdom
of Kishkindha, but enmity develops
between them, and Bali drives away his
brother and takes Sugriva’s wife. After
the abduction of the god Rama’s wife
Sita, Sugriva meets with Rama and theBania
god’s brother Lakshmana, and they
agree that Rama will help Sugriva regain
his wife and kingdom if Sugriva and his
monkey-subjects will help to search for
Sita. Sugriva challenges Bali to battle but
cannot compete with his superior
strength. Although Rama has agreed to
shoot Bali with an arrow, he is unable to
tell which of the monkeys he is. In a sec-
ond battle, when Sugriva is marked by a
garland, Rama shoots Bali with an arrow
from behind and kills him.
Bali
(3) Island in Indonesia that has the last
surviving remnant of the Hindu-
Buddhist culture that pervaded the
region after the early centuries of the
common era. Indian beliefs were first
brought by traders and merchants, and
inscriptions reveal that the Balinese
kings patronized a variety of sects, both
Hindu and Buddhist. In time, Indian
sacred geography was transferred and
transposed to Bali, native deities were
gradually assimilated into the pantheon,
and all the competing sects finally were
fused into the new entity known as
Balinese religion.
Bana
(“arrow”) One of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography, which is
associated with various deities—the
Goddess, Shiva, and Vishnu—and is
thus emblematic of no particular one. It
is often found in images in which the
figure carries a bow (dhanus).
Bana
(2) (7th c. C.E.) Poet and author who was
a contemporary of the northern Indian
emperor Harsha (r. 606–647), and one of
the leading members of Harsha’s court.
Bana is widely acclaimed as one of the
great Sanskrit writers, based on his two
best works: the Harshacharita, a pane-
gyric narrative of Harsha’s deeds, and
Kadambari, a romance left unfinished
at his death. He is also famous for his
Chandishataka, a collection of one

hundred poems dedicated to the
differing forms of the Goddess.
Bana Linga
An egg-shaped stone considered a
svayambhu (“self-manifested”) form of
the god Shiva. As with all svayambhu
images, the bana linga is considered to
be extraordinary, since in it the god has
spontaneously revealed himself. Bana
lingas are only found in certain places,
particularly on the banks of the
Chambal River in the state of Madhya
Pradesh, where they can be found in
large numbers. They come in a wide
spectrum of colors and can be several
feet in width, although most are smaller.
The smaller ones are movable and may
even be carried by wandering ascetics as
portable objects of worship. The larger
ones are usually found only in temples,
not only because of the limits on motion
imposed by their greater size, but also
because they are believed to be so pow-
erful that they should be kept in a care-
fully maintained place.
Bania
(variant of Baniya) In traditional north-
ern Indian society, a merchant or shop-
keeper often but not exclusively
belonging to the vaishya varna, which is
the third of four social classes in Hindu
culture. Aside from their merchant
activities, the more prosperous ones
often engaged in moneylending, some-
times at prodigious rates of interest, as a
way to further increase their capital. In
[[85]]
Banjara
traditional lore, banias are invariably
painted as greedy and avaricious people
who care about nothing but money.
Although they were often stereotyped as
parasites, banias were a necessary part
of the traditional agricultural economy,
because they gave farmers goods on
credit to be repaid after the harvest.
They also lent farmers money to get
started again after a bad harvest. Both
groups thus depended on one another—
the farmers for capital, the banias for
continuing consumption and patron-
age. For a masterful reconstruction of
the ethos in the northern Indian mer-
chant family, in which Hindu piety was
an important element, see C. A. Bayly,
Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars, 1983.
Banjara
The model for traditional Indian society
was a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation. In traditional northern
Indian society, the Banjaras were a jati
whose hereditary occupation was dri-
ving pack animals, either as peddlers
selling retail goods to people in more
remote places or as transporters
conveying commodities from one seller
to another. They appear in poems by
some of the bhakti (devotional) poets,
particularly by Ravidas, as a symbol of
human heedlessness or as a person who
never stops moving to reflect on where
he has been.
Banking
In traditional Hindu culture, banking
was often an extension of a merchant
family’s economic life, particularly in
times and places in which centralized
banking did not exist. In most cases
these families transacted their business
using letters of credit known as hundis,
which enabled them to conduct busi-
ness over large distances without the
risk of transporting gold and silver bul-
lion. By the early 1800s, these hundis
[[86]]

functioned as virtual currency in much
of India, since in some cases they were
used in twenty or thirty transactions
before eventually being returned to the
issuing family for cashing. This system
made a merchant family’s creditworthi-
ness its most valuable asset. Once this
was lost, the family’s hundis were no
longer honored, and they were unable to
conduct business. Since the evaluation
of a family’s credit was often tied to
judgments about its character, mer-
chant families strove to cultivate the
image of seriousness, dependability,
and thrift. In this ethos the only accept-
able forum for lavish expenditures was
for religious endowments, since these
reinforced the family’s pious image and
thus enhanced their creditworthiness.
With part of their surplus capital, these
families would usually engage in
moneylending as one way to increase
their wealth; the largest families
routinely lent money to royalty, which
provided them with even greater status.
For a masterful picture of the merchant
family ethos in northern India, see
C. A. Bayly, Rulers, Townsmen, and
Bazaars, 1983.
Barahmasa
(“twelve months”) Poetic genre in which
each of the poem’s verses, or stanzas, is
devoted to one month of the year, with
the months treated in chronological
order. This is a purely vernacular genre
for which there are no known instances
in Sanskrit. Barahmasa poems often
reveal a great deal about everyday life
and can be subdivided into several basic
categories: an enumerative type, which
describes appropriate activities for each
month such as farming or religious
practice; a narrative form, which
recounts a woman’s longing (viraha) for
her absent lover; and a type describing a
young wife’s trial of chastity as she with-
stands various temptations during an
extended separation from her husband.
For further information see Charlotte
Vaudeville, Barahmasa in Indian
Literature, 1986.Basavanna
Barat
One of the common elements in a
modern northern Indian marriage
ceremony, in which the groom is
brought in a procession to the wed-
ding site, escorted by his (mostly
male) relatives and friends. The barat
evokes the symbolism of a royal pro-
cession in which the groom is the king,
at least for the day. The groom most
commonly rides a gaily decorated
white mare, although any means of
transportation
representing
his
importance is acceptable—from an
elephant to a horse-drawn carriage to
an automobile strung with garlands.
In keeping with the royal imagery, the
groom often wears a crown or orna-
ments made of tinsel. The entire pro-
cession is usually accompanied by a
marching band, in the role of the her-
alds who march before the royal pres-
ence; the band will often stop along
the way to play, at which time the par-
ticipants will dance around them.
Although the groom usually remains
reserved throughout the barat—in
keeping with the gravity of the occa-
sion—for the rest of his companions, it
is a time for joking, laughing, dancing,
and celebration immediately before
the wedding. The barat may also
involve the consumption of liquor,
although many more conservative
Hindus frown upon this element.
Barsana
A village in the Braj region of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, which is most famous as
the birthplace of the god Krishna’s lov-
ing companion, Radha.
Baruthani Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark, or waning, half
of the lunar month of Baisakh, which
takes place within April and May. The
festival is dedicated to the worship of
Vishnu, especially in his Vamana
avatar, which is his fifth incarnation.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites, usually involving fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those observing this rit-
ual should abstain from anger and
backbiting and eat food that is pre-
pared without salt or oil. The name
Baruthani means “armored” or “pro-
tected,” and faithfully observing this
festival is believed to protect one from
all evil and grant enormous good for-
tune. In the charter myth, an ascetic
whose foot has been chewed off by a
wild beast regains the limb by per-
forming this ritual.
Basavanna
(1106–67/68) Poet-saint and religious
leader in the Lingayat community, a
bhakti (devotional) group that wor-
ships Shiva as the single supreme God
and rejects all caste regulations. The
Lingayats were formed in the south-
ern Indian state of Karnataka where
they still have a considerable pres-
ence, and the collections of poetry
that form their most important reli-
gious texts are composed in the
Kannada language. According to tra-
dition, from his youth Basavanna was
a great devotee (bhakta) of Shiva,
whose piety was so intense that he
rejected all notions of ritual and caste.
After spending much of his youth as a
religious seeker, Basavanna became
minister to a king named Bijjala.
Basavanna used his position’s wealth
and influence to care for Shiva’s wan-
dering devotees (jangama), and
Bijjala’s court became a magnet for
many important figures, including the
poet and religious leader Allama
Prabhu. Basavanna’s patronage was
vital in forming the Lingayat commu-
nity, and as a token of his importance,
the suffix anna (“elder brother”) was
attached to his name, Basava. As the
Lingayat community grew stronger,
their public opposition to ritual wor-
ship and caste distinctions generated
intense hostility from more tradition-
al groups. This conflict finally came to
[[87]]
Basohli
a violent head when the fledgling
Lingayat community apparently arranged
a marriage between an untouchable boy
and a brahmin girl. Traditionalists
became so enraged that they executed the
bride and groom’s fathers. The Lingayat
community
was
dispersed,
and
Basavanna died soon afterward. For fur-
ther information see A. K. Ramanujan
(trans.), Speaking of Siva, 1973.
Basohli
A town west of Jammu in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir, close to the bor-
der of Himachal Pradesh. Although it is
an insignificant place in modern times,
in the seventeenth century, Basohli was
the capital of a small kingdom in the
Shiwalik Hills. It was in Basohli that the
Pahari style of miniature painting first
appeared. The Basohli version of that
style is characterized by highly defined
profiles, sharply flattened perspective,
and broad bands of a single intense
color for backgrounds. It serves as a
transitional style between the so-called
Rajasthani and the more developed
techniques of the Pahari schools.
Bathing
See snana.
Baudhayana
(6th–3rd c. B.C.E.) Sage, writer, and com-
mentator. Baudhayana is the author of
one of the three surviving religious texts
known as the Kalpa Sutras. Apastamba
and Hiranyakeshin wrote the other two
Kalpa Sutras. Each of the surviving
works contains the three elements dic-
tated for a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for
Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras), prescrip-
tions for domestic rites (Grhya Sutras),
and prescriptions for appropriate
human behavior (Dharma Sutras). All
three of the authors belonged to the
same school, the Taittiriya school of the
Black Yajur Veda. According to tradition,
Baudhayana was the oldest, Apastamba
was his disciple, and Hiranyakeshin was
Apastamba’s disciple. This relative
chronology is supported by the texts
themselves, since Baudhayana’s work is
much less organized than the others, his
language is more archaic, and he is often
less strict in his opinions. His texts gain
their primary importance as a source for
his successors.
Bath, Mohenjo-Daro
One of the most striking structures exca-
vated at Mohenjo-Daro, the first city of
the Indus Valley civilization to be dis-
covered. This bath is an oblong pool,
thirty-nine by twenty-three feet in area
and eight feet deep. It is built of brick
and sealed with pitch. The tank could be
drained through an opening in one cor-
ner, and it was surrounded on all four
sides by small rooms reminiscent of
changing rooms. The Indus Valley cities
gave great attention to plumbing, sani-
tation, and sewers, suggesting that
bathing (snana) may have been con-
nected with ritual purity as in modern
Hindu life. With this in mind, the bath
was probably not a swimming pool but
rather had some deeper connection
with religious life. For further informa-
tion see Walter Ashlin Fairservis, The
Roots of Ancient India, 1975.
[[88]]

Begampura
Fictional city named in one of the
poems written by the poet-saint
Ravidas (ca. 1500). The word begam can
mean either “queen” or “without pain.”
The poem clearly shows the city as an
idealized place far from the tribulations
of ordinary human life, such as pain,
sorrow, taxes, wrongdoing, and to a
lesser extent, class distinctions.
Although Ravidas was born a tanner
(chamar), an occupation that was
looked down upon, this is one of his
only poems that speaks about social
issues, however indirectly.
Begging

hood in traditional Hindu society that is

desperately poor, disabled, or unable to
provide for themselves and their fami-
lies and who must depend upon gifts
(dana) to survive. Such beggars have
extremely low social status, although
they may make a fairly decent living,
particularly if they live in a favorable
environment such as a pilgrimage place
(tirtha), where giving gifts is a common
religious act. Aside from all of the obvi-
ous disadvantages—low social status, an
uncertain income, and having to endure
scorn and verbal abuse—these beggars
also suffer the stigma of living on
charity, rather than earning an income.
This is karmically undesirable since
giving gifts is one of the methods by
which people get rid of inauspiciousness,
which is transferred to the receiver
along with the gift. In many cases such a
beggar is considered nothing more
than an instrument to be used, and the
most common word for such a person is
patra (“vessel”).
Some ascetics also make their living
by begging but fall into a completely dif-
ferent category. In the ideal case, these
are people who have given up all visible
means of support as part of an effort to
renounce the world; this differentiates
them from the poor, who are part of
ordinary society, albeit at the lowest
level. There is general social approval for
supporting ascetics, at least the ones
who are considered genuine spiritual
seekers, and doing so is widely seen as a
source of religious merit. Although it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish poorer
ascetics from ordinary beggars, in the
case of the most respected ascetics the
distinction is very clear. Such respected
ascetics confer status on people by
accepting their gifts, and consequently
they tend to screen the donors and their
motives very carefully to protect their
reputations. See also karma.

Afghanistan.
Excavations there have revealed arti-
facts from Kushana culture, primarily

Bel
BelBelur Math
Another name for the bilva tree.
See bilva.World headquarters of the Ramakrishna
Mission, a modern religious organiza-
tion. The Ramakrishna Mission was
founded
in
[[1897]]

by
Swami
Vivekananda, the most famous disciple
of the nineteenth-century Bengali
mystic Ramakrishna. The Mission is
equally dedicated to both social service
and spiritual uplift, based on
Vivekananda’s realization that India
needed concrete development as much
as religious teaching. Belur Math was
constructed in 1899, two years after
the Ramakrishna Mission was founded.
It is located just north of Calcutta on
the west side of the Hugli River, quite
close to the Dakshineshwar temple
where Ramakrishna lived for most of
his adult life.
Belagave
Village in the Shimoga district of the
state of Karnataka. Belagave was the
most important center for the
Kalamukhas, which was an ascetic sect
of devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
The Kalamukhas had an important his-
torical role in southern India between
the tenth and thirteenth centuries,
but they disappeared some time after
that. Their ritual center in Belagave
was the temple of Kedareshvara, which
was Shiva in his form as the lord of
Kedara. Although the Kalamukhas
have disappeared, their presence and
prominence in the region are confirmed
by the inscriptions at this and
numerous other temples.
Belur
Town in the state of Karnataka, about
sixty miles northwest of the modern city
of Mysore. As at its sister site, Halebid,
Belur is known for a magnificent collec-
tion of temples built by the Hoysala
dynasty, which ruled western Karnataka
from the eleventh to thirteenth cen-
turies C.E. At both sites the temples were
built from a particular type of stone—
variously described as chlorite schist,
steatite, or soapstone—that was quite
soft when newly quarried but gradually
hardened with exposure to the air. This
initial malleability made the stone easy
to carve and facilitated the lush detail
characteristic of Hoysala temples.
Architecturally speaking, these temples
have certain unique features: a central
hall connecting three star-shaped sanc-
tuaries, and temple towers (shikharas)
composed of well-defined horizontal
tiers rather than the continuous upward
sweep characteristic of the northern
Indian Nagara architectural style.
[[90]]

Benares
City and sacred center (tirtha) on the
banks of the Ganges in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Benares is an anglicized form
of Varanasi, one of the traditional Hindu
names for the city, as well as Kashi and
Avimukta. All three of these names are
used to designate the entire city, but in a
more specific context, they denote con-
centric sacred zones surrounding the
Vishvanath temple; Avimukta is the
smallest, then Varanasi, and finally
Kashi. As with all other pilgrimage
places on the Ganges, Benares is consid-
ered sacred because of its proximity to
the river, particularly because at Benares
the Ganges flows in a northerly direc-
tion, which is considered auspicious.
The Ganges is an integral part of the
identity of Benares, and much of the
city’s religious life centers around it.
The most important sacred presence
in the city, however, is the god Shiva.
Benares is the city of Shiva, his dwelling
place on earth, and the site he never
leaves, hence the name Avimukta
(“never forsaken”). Temples to Shiva are
scattered throughout the city—some
old, some new, some nearly forgotten—
but the most important is the
Vishvanath (“Lord of the Universe”)Betel
temple. Vishvanath is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sites deemed
particularly sacred to Shiva. The original
Vishvanath temple was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, who built
a mosque on the site; the present
Vishvanath temple was rebuilt next to
the original location. Shiva’s eternal
presence makes Benares one of the
seven sacred cities, in which death
brings liberation of the soul (moksha).
At the moment of death, Shiva is
believed to come to the dying person
and impart his salvific wisdom. Shiva’s
presence is also evident at the crema-
tion ground at the sacred site
Manikarnika Ghat, which is in the very
heart of the city rather than at the mar-
gin as in most other places. Here too
Shiva teaches human beings a lesson;
specifically, Shiva reminds them of their
imminent death. This is not to distress
or depress them, but to spur them on to
serious religious life.
The presence of the Ganges and
Shiva make Benares an ideal place to
die, or to immerse oneself in spiritual
life; what is often overlooked is that
Benares is also an unusually vibrant
place to live. It has a long history as a
trading center and market town, and it
remains so today even though the creak-
ing wooden boats traversing the Ganges
have been supplemented by other
means of transport. Benares is famous
for its artisans, particularly weavers and
metalworkers, many of whom are
Muslim. It has also been renowned as a
cultural center for at least a thousand
years. Benares is still one of the most
important centers in India for all
branches of traditional Sanskritic learn-
ing, from grammar to astrology to med-
icine. It is likewise a center for music,
dance, and all of the arts and has been
home to a galaxy of Indian religious fig-
ures, including the poet-saints Tulsidas,
Ravidas, and Kabir. For a detailed expo-
sition of the city and its life, see Diana
Eck, Banaras, 1999.
Benares Hindu University
Indian educational institution founded
in 1916 by the nationalist figure Madan
Mohan Malviya (1861–1946). The World
War I era marked a more activist orien-
tation to the Indian independence
movement. One of the ways this
activism manifested itself was in found-
ing educational institutions, which gave
Indians greater control over the univer-
sities’ mission, tone, and curriculum.
Benares Hindu University was founded
to uphold Hindu cultural and philo-
sophical traditions, but also to educate
its students in the sciences and thus pre-
pare them for the modern world. This
mission reflected the modernist think-
ing of its founders as well as their pas-
sionate commitment to traditional
Hindu culture. It is still one of the finest
universities in India, particularly for the
study of classical Indian culture.
Bengali
Modern Indian language in the Indo-
European language family, spoken in
the region of modern Bengal, for which
it is named. Like many of India’s region-
al tongues, Bengali has a long history as
a literary language in its own right. In
the nineteenth century, Calcutta was the
most important cultural center in India
as well as a hotbed of resistance to
British rule. As the vernacular tongue,
Bengali was used in that era’s revolu-
tionary politics, particularly by Bankim
Chandra Chatterjee and Aurobindo
Ghose; it was also the language used by
religious figures such as Ramprasad
and Ramakrishna.
Betel
Common name for the small, hard nut
from the areca palm tree, which is con-
sumed by mixing slices of the nut with
lime, tobacco, and spices and wrapping
the whole thing up in a betel leaf. This is
not eaten but lodged against the cheek
and slowly chewed, to let the juices flow.
This method of gradually absorbing the
juice may be the reason for its most

dried, wrapped in betel leaves, and chewed to aid digestion.
common name, pan (“drinking”). The
nut turns the saliva a bright red color,
which is the reason for the distinctive
crimson smears adorning many Indian
buildings. Chewing betel is widely
believed to be good for the digestive
tract, a genuine concern in a country
where intestinal upsets are still quite
common. Chewing betel is such a
deeply embedded part of sophisticated
Indian cultural life that it even has its
own aesthetic, and folding betel is one
of the sixty-four arts mentioned in the
Kama Sutra .
Bhadrakali
(from bhadra, meaning “blessed” in
Sanskrit) In Hindu mythology, the epithet
of a powerful and terrifying form of the
Goddess. According to one version of the
story, Bhadrakali’s birth is associated with
the death of Shiva’s first wife, Sati. Sati goes
to a great sacrifice sponsored by her father,
Daksha. When Daksha intentionally and
publicly insults her husband Shiva, in her
anger and shame, Sati immolates herself in
the sacrificial fire. When Shiva learns of
Sati’s death, he is so enraged that he plucks
two matted locks (jata) from his head and
[[92]]

dashes them to the ground. The first takes
form as Virabhadra, a wrathful and terrify-
ing form of Shiva, and the second takes
form as Bhadrakali. Just as Virabhadra
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,
Bhadrakali symbolizes the ferocious and
dangerous side of the Goddess, in contrast
with the gentle and loyal Sati. Shiva orders
the two to destroy Daksha’s sacrifice, which
they do with great abandon.
Bhadrakali also appears in the stories
connected with the birth of the god
Krishna. While Krishna is developing in
his mother, Devaki’s, womb, Bhadrakali
enters the womb of Krishna’s foster
mother, Yashoda. The two children are
born on the same night, and under cover
of darkness they are switched with one
another. The next morning the baby girl is
snatched from Devaki by her stepbrother,
Kamsa, the wicked king of Mathura, who
dashes out the child’s brains on a rock;
this is just as he has done with Devaki’s six
other children because it has been fore-
told that one of them will kill him. From
the infant’s corpse arises an eight-armed
figure of the Goddess, who taunts Kamsa
that his destroyer has already escaped
and then disappears.Bhagavad Gita
Bhadrapada
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Bhadrapada is the sixth
month of the lunar year, usually falling
within August and September. This is
one of the months associated with the
monsoon rains. The major festivals in
Bhadrapada are Kajari Teej (Teej),
Bahula
Chauth,
Janmashtami,
Radhashtami, Aja Ekadashi, Hartalika
Teej
(Teej),
Ganesh Chaturthi,
Rishi Panchami, Parivartini Ekadashi,
Anant Chaturdashi, and in southern
India, Onam.
Bhadrasana
(“decent posture”) In yoga practice this
is one of the sitting postures (asana)
described in commentaries to the Yoga
Sutras. In this position the legs are
crossed with the feet tucked under the
thighs so that the crossed heels form a
cavity around the scrotum. This is called
the “decent posture” because the
cupped hands are placed over the cavity
made by the heels, covering the private
parts. In Hindu iconography this is one
of the common postures in which
images of the deities are portrayed.
Bhagabhadra
Monarch in the Sunga dynasty, which
was centered in the Malwa region in the
western part of the state of Madhya
Pradesh, in the centuries following the
decline of the Maurya dynasty just
before the turn of the common era.
Despite the fragmentation of the
Maurya state, rulers seem to have main-
tained contact with the Greek-speaking
kingdoms to the west, since a pillar
inscription records that Bhagabhadra
received an ambassador named
Heliodorus from the king of Takshasila,
in modern Pakistan.
Bhagavad Gita
One of the best-known Hindu scrip-
tures, which is itself a section in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. The parts of the epic before
the Bhagavad Gita chronicle the growing
strife between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the two branches of a royal
family who are the epic’s main charac-
ters. The parts following the Bhagavad
Gita detail the battle that ultimately
destroys the entire family. The Bhagavad
Gita itself is set in that moment of calm
just before the battle begins, and it is
written as a dialogue between the
Pandava prince Arjuna and the
supreme divinity Krishna, here dis-
guised as Arjuna’s charioteer. Arjuna is
the world’s greatest archer and can dec-
imate his enemies with ease. But as he
looks at the faces of the enemy, he real-
izes that the people he is about to fight
and kill are his relatives, teachers, and
friends. Not surprisingly, the prospect
leaves him cold, and it is up to Krishna
to give him divine guidance.
The Gita’s second chapter opens with
Krishna trying to shame Arjuna into
fighting (in essence, saying “everyone
will think you were afraid and make fun
of you”), but when this tactic fails,
Krishna has to give more substantive
advice, which makes up the rest of the
text. Different parts of the Bhagavad
Gita invoke all three of the generally
accepted paths to liberation of the
soul (moksha): the path of wisdom
(jnanamarga), the path of action
(karmamarga), and the path of
devotion (bhaktimarga).
The path of wisdom is rooted in the
teachings of the speculative texts known
as the Upanishads. This path stresses
the realization of one’s essential nature
as the eternal Self (atman). The atman is
identical with the universal reality
known as Brahman; once one has
accepted this, all dualistic ideas and
false knowledge disappear. The path of
action stresses acting without selfish
desire—performing one’s duty as duty,
but without attachment to the ultimate
outcome. This path thus upholds and
reinforces the rigid social structure pro-
pounded in the dharma literature. As a
warrior in that social system, Arjuna’s
[[93]]
Bhagavan
job is to kill people. At the same time,
the path of action provides a way to
transform socially sanctioned duty into
religious practice. The path of devotion
entails surrendering all one’s actions to
God and performing one’s role as an
instrument of divine will.
The Bhagavad Gita shows no clear
preference for any of these paths, which
implies that different writers reworked
the text over time. Professor Arthur
Llewellyn Basham has speculated that
the “original” Bhagavad Gita ended with
verse 2.38, after a section establishing
the morality of fighting in a just war,
thus giving Arjuna his rationale to fight.
It is believed that this “original” text was
then reworked by a philosopher of
the upanishadic type, who conceived
of the Ultimate Reality as the imper-
sonal Brahman and of liberation in
terms of mystical realization. The
final sections were most likely added
by a passionate devotee (bhakta) of
Vishnu, particularly in his form as
Krishna. According to Basham, this
last author not only inserted verses in
some of the earlier books but also
added some completely new ones.
One of these, Arjuna’s vision of
Krishna’s cosmic form in the Gita’s
eleventh chapter, is considered
among the most brilliant religious
texts ever written. Although some
scholars might take issue with
specific points, Professor Basham’s
theory seems the most convincing
explanation for a highly varied text.
In the roughly two thousand years
since the Bhagavad Gita was com-
piled, different commentators have
interpreted its message according to
their own proclivities. The ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya
saw it as sanctioning the path of wis-
dom, while the eleventh-century
philosopher Ramanuja was con-
vinced that it stressed devotion. The
most recent pivotal interpreter,
Mohandas Gandhi, understood the
text as commanding action. He saw in
Arjuna’s struggle a blueprint for his
own time and work, urging him to
[[94]]

labor for Indian independence but to
do so without attachment or hope for
personal gain. The text has become
even more important as a “scripture”
during the past two centuries, largely
because of pressure from Christian
missionaries. One sign of this is that
in modern Indian courtrooms, the
Gita is the text upon which Hindus
take the oath of truthfulness when
being called to take the stand. For an
accessible translation of the text
itself, see Barbara Stoller Miller
(trans.), The Bhagavad-Gita, 1991; for
Dr. Basham’s analysis of the text, see
Arthur Llewellyn Basham, The Origins
and
Development
of
Classical
Hinduism, 1991.
Bhagavan
(“Blessed One”) Name denoting both
respect and reverence. In different con-
texts this name can be used as an epi-
thet of either the god Krishna (as in the
Bhagavad Gita) or the god Shiva. In
modern usage, at least in northern
India, it is also the word that comes clos-
est to expressing the notion of abstract
divinity, much like the word “God” in
English. It is often used to denote God
by Hindus who are religious but who do
not worship particular deities.
Bhagavata
(“devotees of the Blessed One”) General
name for the earliest devotees (bhakta)
of Vishnu, particularly the devotees of
Krishna-Gopala, a deified cowherd hero
who later became identified with
Vishnu. Until the development of
sectarian Vaishnavism in around
the eleventh century C.E., the word
bhagavata was a blanket term for all
Vaishnavas except the Pancharatrikas,
who were followers of the secret ritual
tradition known as Pancharatra.
Bhagavata Purana
Sectarian religious text that is by far the
most important text for the worship ofBhagirathi
the god Krishna as the single Supreme
Being. Internal evidence hints that it was
written in southern India in the ninth or
tenth century, making it much later than
many of the other puranas. The bulk of
the text focuses on Krishna’s early life in
the village of Brindavan—infancy, child-
hood, and adolescence—but gives little
attention to his later exploits as a king
and hero. This purana’s best-known sec-
tion is the tenth book, which describes
Krishna’s amorous exploits with the local
herd girls (gopis) as they pass the nights
in a circle dance (ras lila) on the shores of
the Yamuna River. The image of Krishna
throughout the text is that of a god in
constant play with the world. For
Krishna’s devotees (bhakta), the supreme
felicity comes with the opportunity to
take part in that divine play (lila).
Bhagirath
In Hindu mythology, the single person
most responsible for bringing the celes-
tial Ganges down to earth. The river
Ganges and the goddess Ganges are the
same, hence the river is considered holy.
Bhagirath is the great-great-grandson of
King Sagar, whose 60,000 sons have
been burned to ash by the sage Kapila’s
magic power when they erroneously
accuse Kapila of being a thief. The sage
later tells Anshuman, King Sagar’s
grandson and sole surviving descen-
dant, that the only way to bring peace to
their souls is to bring the Ganges from
heaven down to earth. Anshuman
strives to do this for the rest of his life, as
does his son Dilip after him, but both
are unsuccessful. Dilip’s son Bhagirath
takes their efforts to heart and retires to
the Himalayas, where he performs
asceticism until the gods finally agree to
send the Ganges down to earth. Yet
Bhagirath’s efforts are not over. He next
has to appease the god Shiva so that the
deity will agree to take the shock of the
falling river on his head, since its force
will otherwise destroy the earth. When
all is finally in place, the Ganges falls to
earth onto the head of Shiva. From there
Bhagirath leads the river out of the
As a tributary of the Ganges, the waters of the
Bhagirathi River are considered sacred and its
banks contain several pilgrimage sites.
mountains to the sea, where she touches
his ancestors’ ashes, after which they
find peace at last.
Bhagirathi
Epithet for the Ganges as both river and
goddess. The word Bhagirathi is derived
from the name Bhagirath, the single
person most responsible for bringing
the Ganges to earth. Bhagirathi is also
the name for a Himalayan tributary of
the river; the Ganges itself is formed
when the Bhagirathi unites with the
Alakananda River at Devaprayag.
Although the Alakananda is longer and
wider, the Bhagirathi flows through
Gangotri, the sacred site (tirtha) cele-
brated as the source of the Ganges. As
with all the Himalayan tributaries of the
Ganges, the Bhagirathi is considered
[[95]]
Bhairava
sacred. Important pilgrimage places
along this tributary include Gangotri
near its headwaters, Uttarkashi, and
Devaprayag.
Bhairava
(“terrible”) A wrathful and powerful
divine attendant of the god Shiva who is
often identified as a form of Shiva him-
self. According to the Shiva Purana, a
sectarian scripture, Bhairava is produced
when the god Brahma insults Shiva, and
Shiva’s rage takes concrete form as
Bhairava. After his birth, Bhairava’s first
act is to cut off one of Brahma’s heads—
the one whose mouth has uttered the
insult—thus leaving the god with four
remaining heads. Since Brahma is con-
sidered a brahmin priest, this act makes
Bhairava guilty of brahmin murder, the
most serious of the four great crimes
(mahapataka). As a sign of the enormity
of his act, Brahma’s severed head sticks
to Bhairava’s hand; as penance
(prayashchitta) Bhairava has to wander
the countryside as a beggar, displaying
Brahma’s severed head as a continual
advertisement of his crime. In his travels
Bhairava visits many pilgrimage places
(tirtha), but none of them have the
power to cleanse him from the sin of
brahmin murder. He finally obtains a
pardon in the city of Benares, at a site
named Kapalamochana (“releasing the
skull”). As soon as Bhairava bathes there,
Brahma’s head falls from his hand into
the Ganges—a sign that his crime had
been expiated.
Although often seen as Shiva’s atten-
dant, Bhairava is important in several
different contexts. He is often portrayed
as the consort of powerful, independent
goddesses such as Durga and Kali,
although he is subordinate to them,
befitting their status as supreme deities.
Bhairava’s associations with wrath and
power have made him popular with
practitioners of the secret ritual tradition
known as tantra, who may invoke him
for magic powers or other favors.
Bhairava is also popular with the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetic
[[96]]

devotees (bhakta) of Shiva who formerly
made their living as traders and merce-
nary soldiers; this group sees him as a
divine image of themselves. Some of the
ambivalence associated with Bhairava is
symbolized by his animal vehicle, the
dog, which in Hindu culture is almost
invariably a scavenger and considered
highly impure.
Bhairava Akhara
Another name for the Juna akhara, a
particular subgroup of the Naga class
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. See
Juna akhara.
Bhairava Jayanti
Annual festival on the eighth day of
the dark, or waning, half of the
lunar
month
of
Margashirsha
(November–December), which is cele-
brated as the birthday of Bhairava.
Bhairava is a wrathful and powerful form
of the god Shiva and is actually the god’s
anger personified. He emerges from
Shiva’s forehead after Shiva has been
insulted by the god Brahma, and
Bhairava’s first act is to cut off the head of
Brahma that has uttered the insult, leav-
ing the god with four heads. Bhairava’s
wrath gives him an aura of danger but
also the power to help his devotees
(bhakta), who worship him to attain
success, remove obstacles, and recover
from disease. On this festival people
worship Bhairava, Shiva, and Shiva’s
wife, Parvati, as well as Bhairava’s ani-
mal vehicle, the dog. People are encour-
aged to worship through the night and to
pass this time by telling mythic stories of
Bhairava, Shiva, and Parvati.
Bhairavaprakasha
(“brilliance of Bhairava”) Name given to
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of
the Mahanirvani akhara, a particular
group of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and are organized into differentBhakta
akharas, or regiments, much like an
army. Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas’ primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial
trading interests; both of these have
occupations largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have particular features, including this
spear, which signify their organiza-
tional identity.
Bhairavi
Feminine form of Bhairava and an
epithet of the Goddess. Bhairavi is one
of the ten Mahavidyas, a group of
goddesses who are both extremely
powerful and potentially dangerous.
Bhaiya Duj
Annual festival falling on the second
day (duj) of the bright, or waxing, half
of the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). This festival is cel-
ebrated to emphasize the bond between
a brother (bhaiya) and sister. During
Bhaiya Duj, married women invite their
brothers into their homes, apply tika
marks on their brothers’ foreheads as a
sign of respect, and feed them sweets
and a hearty meal. Sisters also tie a string
around their brothers’ right wrists to
symbolize the emotional bond between
them and the brother’s obligation to pro-
tect his sister throughout her lifetime.
Unmarried women host their brothers in
the same way in their natal homes. In
either case, on this day women should
pray that their brothers have long lives
and that they themselves be happily
married. The brothers, in turn, give pre-
sents to their sisters.
Aside from reaffirming the normal
family love between brother and sister,
this festival also emphasizes the protec-
tive role that brothers play in their sis-
ters’ lives, particularly after women are
married. The traditional pattern in
northern India is for married women to
live with their husbands’ families. Since
women generally outlive their fathers,
for most of her life a woman’s primary
protectors will be her brothers. A woman
without brothers is in a position of
relative weakness. If nothing else, these
yearly visits give brothers the chance to
assess their sister’s happiness and the
state of affairs in her married home.
Such visits also notify the husband’s
family that they are still concerned with
her welfare.
Bhajan
(“sharing”) General name for a religious
or devotional hymn, which is almost
always sung in a vernacular language. As
an expression of personal devotion, bha-
jans have no prescribed forms and in
contemporary times are often set to the
melodies of film songs. As a genre, bha-
jans can have any or all of the following
themes: detailing the deeds of a particu-
lar deity, praising the deity, addressing
the god in a tone of complaint or humble
supplication (vinaya), reminding the
deity of the speaker’s difficulties from
internal or external sources, or warning
the listeners to examine and reform their
lives. Singing and listening to such
hymns was, and remains, a major form
of religious activity in the bhakti (devo-
tional) movement. During these
sessions, devotees (bhakta) “share”
their songs and experiences with one
another. Although one can find bhajans
dedicated to all the gods in the
pantheon, from a historical perspective
this singing tradition has been strongest
among the devotees of Vishnu.
Vaishnava devotional literature is full
of tales of Vishnu coming in disguise to
take part in bhajan sessions, since the
company of his devotees is said to be
heaven on earth.
Bhakta
(“sharer”) In Hinduism, this word
denotes a devotee of any particular
deity. The word’s literal meaning,
“sharer,” has a twofold sense. On one
hand, the devotee shares in the deity’s
grace by virtue of his or her piety. On the

other hand, since most Hindu devotion-
alism involves a community of
worshipers, the devotee also gets to
share in the company and community of
like-minded people.
(“Triumph of [God’s] Devotees”) Text
written by Mahipati, an eighteenth-cen-
tury writer and hagiographer of the
devotional (bhakti) poet-saints. The sto-
ries in the Bhaktavijaya focus mainly
on the saints connected with the
Varkari Panth, a religious group
centered around the worship of the god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur.
This focus is understandable since
Mahipati himself was a Varkari. In
keeping with the trend toward unifica-
tion often promoted by the devotional
movement, he also included tales of
other great devotees (bhakta), most
notably Kabir, Namdev, Jnaneshvar,
and Narsi Mehta. The stories in the
Bhaktavijaya present each of these
saints as a paradigm of devotion and
stress the power of piety to overcome all
obstacles. This theme also marks
Mahipati’s other major work, the
Bhaktililamrta. The Bhaktavijaya has
been translated by Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole as Stories of Indian
Saints, 1988.
Bhaktamal
(“Garland of Devotees”) Text written by
Nabhadas (ca. 1600) in which he gives
short (six-line) biographical accounts of
over two hundred bhakti (devotional)
figures. Although Nabhadas himself was
a Ramanandi, and thus a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama, his work not
only includes devotees of all sectarian
persuasions but is generally considered
unbiased. The text is notably free of
astonishing and miraculous events.
Instead, the main emphasis is on the
devotee’s personal qualities, which serve
as a model for others. In many cases the
Bhaktamal gives the earliest reliable
account of these figures, which makes it
an extremely important source for
northern Indian literary and religious
history. It is all the more interesting that
the text cannot be definitively dated,
[[98]]

Bhakti
(“sharing”) The most common word
denoting devotion to God. This is one of
the three traditional paths to gain final
liberation of the soul (moksha), and it
has been the most widespread type of
religious practice for well over a thou-
sand years. The word’s literal meaning
conveys the sense of relationship. On
one hand, it refers to an intense and pas-
sionate love between devotee (bhakta)
and deity, and on the other, it refers to
separate communities of people bound
together by their common love of God.
Although references to bhakti can be
found in such early texts as the
Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the
Bhagavad Gita, the bhakti propounded
here is radically different from laterBhaktililamrta
usages. In both these texts, bhakti is pre-
sented as a form of yoga in which one
contemplates God as part of a con-
trolled and disciplined practice. This is a
far cry from the abandonment and pas-
sionate involvement in later times.
The beginnings of this latter sort of
bhakti arose in the Tamil country of
deep southern India between the sixth
and ninth centuries B.C.E. It had an
intensity that was radically different
from earlier notions, a devotional “heat”
as opposed to the “coolness” of yoga.
Tamil bhakti expressed, and continues
to express, its devotion through songs
sung in vernacular languages, convey-
ing an intimate relationship with a per-
sonal god.
These characteristics basically held
throughout history. The use of vernacu-
lar speech was especially significant,
for this was the language of ordinary
life and marked the egalitarianism that
was one of the hallmarks of bhakti
devotion. Bhakti devotees were men and
women from all strata of society, from
the highest to the lowest; here was an
opportunity for religious life based
solely on the depth and sincerity of one’s
devotion rather than on one’s birth.
Despite this religious egalitarianism,
devotees rarely tried to restructure
their hierarchical societies. The idea was
that religious equality was supposed
to transcend rather than reform
human society.
Aside from egalitarianism and per-
sonal experience, bhakti worship also
stressed community, based on the inter-
connections between devotees. Though
each devotee was an individual (and
indeed, bhakti poets had real personali-
ties, as the many hagiographies bear
witness), they also fell into “families,” all
of which were connected with each
other. Many of the bhakti saints fell into
recognizable groups: Some were cen-
tered around a particular sacred place,
such as the temple at Pandharpur in the
state of Maharashtra; some were con-
nected as teachers and students, such as
Nammalvar
and
his
disciple
Nathamuni; and some had long-term
associations, as with the Lingayat com-
munity. In all cases these devotees were
keenly aware of those who had preceded
them and their connections with one
another. Such communities were both
formed and reinforced through satsang,
the “company of good people” whose
influence over time was believed to have
the power to transform. This was a type
of “sharing” that bound devotees to
each other and to their teacher, and
through these two vehicles carried them
to God.
These are general characteristics,
and bhakti’s regional manifestations
often take on a distinct flavor marked by,
if nothing else, the differing languages.
The Padma Purana speaks of bhakti
(a feminine noun) as a maiden who
was born in southern India, attained
maturity in the state of Maharashtra,
and was rejuvenated in northern
India. Although this is a metaphor, it
accurately charts the historical diffusion
of bhakti devotion, as well as its changes
as it moved north. All forms of
bhakti are shaped by specific times,
places, and circumstances.
Bhaktililamrta
(“Nectar of the Play of Devotion”) Text
written by Mahipati, an eighteenth-
century writer and hagiographer of the
devotional
(bhakti)
poet-saints.
Mahipati belonged to the Varkari
Panth, a religious group centered
around the worship of the god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur. The
Bhaktililamrta gives extended accounts
of Varkari saints, such as Eknath,
Tukaram, Ramdas, and Bhanudas. The
text presents each of these saints as a
paradigm of devotion and stresses the
power of worship to overcome all obsta-
cles. This theme also marks his other
major work, the Bhaktavijaya. Parts of
the Bhaktililamrta have been translated
by Justin E. Abbott as The Life of Eknath,
[[1981]]
; and The Life of Tukaram, 1980.
[[99]]
Bhaktimarga
Bhaktimarga
(“path of devotion”) Along with the path
of action (karmamarga) and the path of
wisdom (jnanamarga), this is one of
Hinduism’s three generally accepted
ways to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The bhaktimarga seeks
release of the soul through bhakti, or
passionate devotion to God.
Bhaktirasabodhini
(“Awakening the Delight in Devotion”)
Name of a commentary on the
Bhaktamal of Nabhadas; this commen-
tary was written by Priyadas in 1712. In
the Bhaktamal, Nabhadas had given
brief six-line biographies of over two
hundred contemporary bhakti (devo-
tional) figures. These biographies are
notably free of astonishing and miracu-
lous events and usually stress the devo-
tee’s personal qualities, to serve as a
model
for
others.
In
the
Bhaktirasabodhini, Priyadas gave great-
ly expanded accounts for each devotee
mentioned by Nabhadas, often narrat-
ing amazing stories to which Nabhadas
made no reference. In his biography of
the poet-saint Ravidas, Nabhadas drew
from the texts written by the biographer
Anantadas, but in other cases his
sources are not clear. The accounts in
the Bhaktirasabodhini are suspect as
genuine biographies of these saints,
given Priyadas’s penchant for miracu-
lous events and his chronological dis-
tance from his subjects. Still, the text is
extremely valuable as a mirror of his
time, and careful analysis can reveal
much about contemporary religious
tensions and issues.
Bhamati Advaita
A later branch of the Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school. The Advaita
school upholds a position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things
and that everything is merely a differing
form of that reality. Advaita proponents
believe that reality is nondual (advaita),
[[100]]

that is, that all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman despite
the appearance of diversity. For the
Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is
a fundamental misunderstanding of the
ultimate nature of things, or avidya.
Although often translated as “igno-
rance,” avidya is better understood as
a lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage,
reincarnation (samsara), and suffering.
Bhamati Advaita is based on the
ideas of Mandana Mishra, although the
school takes its name from a commen-
tary written by Mandana’s disciple
Vachaspati Mishra. Mandana was a
contemporary of the philosopher
Shankaracharya, Advaita Vedanta’s
greatest exponent, and took definitive
stands on several philosophical points
on which Shankaracharya had remained
silent. One such point was the location
of avidya, which Mandana claimed must
be each individual Self because it was
absurd to conceive of Brahman as sub-
ject to ignorance. For Mandana there
were clearly multiple, separate selves,
since one person’s liberation did not
bring liberation for all.
Mandana’s comments presupposed
the existence of a common, if illusory,
world, which his followers explained as
the activity of one primal ignorance;
however, they also had to explain how a
single primal ignorance could simulta-
neously affect multiple souls. This was
done using philosophical models known
as limitationism and reflectionism,
although it is the former that has been
more commonly associated with the
Bhamati school. Limitationism assumes
that there are some things (i.e., the color
red) that we do not conceive of as
divided, even when different red colors
appear in different places. In the same
way, the Bhamati school argued, avidya
can be found in multiple souls at
the same time but is complete and
undivided
in
each
of
them.
Reflectionism is based on the idea of a
mirror’s image, which is different from
the original but made from it. ThereforeBhang
the avidya found in any particular soul is
a “reflection” of the original avidya. For
further information see Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Bhandara
(“storehouse”) A banquet given for large
numbers of people—either by special
invitation, restricted to certain classes of
people (such as ascetics), or open to the
general public. Sponsoring such a ban-
quet is believed to generate consider-
able religious merit, but this is also a
conspicuous opportunity for both the
donor and attendees to enhance their
status. Issues of status are also marked
among the attendees. The most honored
guests confer status on the donor simply
by deigning to come, and accordingly
such guests will be treated differently
from the common lot. The rest of the
guests generally get no such special
treatment. They give status to the host
by eating the food he (or she) has had
prepared, but they get little in return
other than the meal itself, which is usu-
ally of poor quality since the food is pre-
pared in large quantities.
Based on these considerations,
ascetics with sufficient resources of their
own will usually avoid such banquets
because of both the quality of the food
and the concerns over status. To eat at a
bhandara is not only to confer prestige
on the donor, but to lower one’s own
status by appearing as though one
needs to do this to survive. The main
exception is when one has been invited
as an honored guest, but even in these
cases it is not unusual for such guests to
eat little or nothing, thereby giving
status by their presence but losing none
through consumption.
Bhandarkar, R. G.
(1837–1925) Sanskrit scholar and intel-
lectual who was the first Indian to serve
as professor of Sanskrit at Deccan
College, in Poona. Bhandarkar was one
of the first Indian academics to combine
the traditional mastery of Sanskrit texts
with critical and objective research, a
project that until then had been con-
fined to European scholars. Bhandarkar
is emblematic of Indian intellectuals in
the late nineteenth century, who began
by learning from the Europeans but
were then able to work with the best of
them. Bhandarkar authored two
Sanskrit workbooks and numerous
scholarly texts, but his most significant
legacy is the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute; it was founded in
[[1917]]
 by his students, friends, and admir-
ers and is still a highly respected
research institution.
Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute
(BORI) Research institute founded in
[[1917]]
 and named after the great scholar
R. G. Bhandarkar (1837–1925). The
Institute is devoted to the study and
preservation of traditional Indian cul-
ture, and it is respected in scholarly cir-
cles throughout the world. Its two most
important publications have been P. V.
Kane’s History of Dharmasastra and a
multivolume critical edition of the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. Aside from its publications,
the Institute is also noted for its vast col-
lection of Sanskrit manuscripts, which
makes it one of the finest research
establishments in all of India.
Bhang
Paste or dough made from crushed mar-
ijuana (Cannabis sativa), which is often
mixed with spices or other flavorings
before being formed into a ball. It is
taken as an intoxicant, either eaten, or
mixed into a “cooling” milk-based drink
called thandai. In general, eating bhang
is disapproved of by respectable people,
although it is fairly common in certain
circles, particularly among ascetics.
Despite this basic disapproval, bhang is
widely consumed as part of the festival
celebrations for Shivaratri and Holi,
even by people who avoid it the rest of
[[101]]
Bhanita
the year. The former festival is dedicated
to Shiva, who is famous for his love of
the drug, whereas Holi is associated
with overturning social boundaries, giv-
ing greater license to do things normally
proscribed. Aside from being consumed
during certain celebrations, it can also
be taken in special places, particularly
when on a pilgrimage. Several of the
most famous Hindu sacred sites
(tirthas)—among them Benares, Puri,
and Haridwar—have government-run
bhang stands where pilgrims can fulfill
their needs.
Bhanita
In poetry, particularly the vernacular
form of the bhakti poets, a signature
line in which the author is identified by
name. This line has two major functions:
to identify the poet and to provide a
summation of the poem’s message. The
word bhanita comes from a verb mean-
ing “to speak,” and by adding a signature
line the poet is stamping his or her
authorship on the poem. Of course,
there is nothing to prevent others from
doing this as well. In a performance con-
text, the poet’s name comes at the
beginning of the final line and alerts the
audience to pay special attention to that
line, which often sums up the entire
poem’s message.
Bharadvaja
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Bharadvaja is an
important ascetic and sage. His ashram,
or abode, is at Chitrakut; this is now a
town in the southeastern area of the
state of Uttar Pradesh, but the epic
describes the place as a forest her-
mitage. When Rama, his wife Sita, and
his brother Lakshmana are beginning
their fourteen years of exile, they come
to Bharadvaja to seek his blessings
(ashirvad). In a broader mythological
context, Bharadvaja is one of the seven
sages whose names mark exogamous
gotra (“lineages”); the others are
Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Vasishtha, Gautama,
[[102]]

Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brahmins are
believed to be descended from these
seven sages, with each family taking the
name of its progenitor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra divisions
are still important, since marriage with-
in the lineage is forbidden. After her
marriage the bride adopts her husband’s
gotra as part of her new identity. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Bharadvaja
(2) (5th c. B.C.E.?) Religious scholar
named as the author of a Shrauta Sutra
(manual on prescriptions for Vedic ritu-
als) and a Grhya Sutra (manual on
domestic rites). The period during
which he flourished is uncertain but
must precede Panini, since this gram-
marian mentions Bharadvaja in the
Ashtadhyayi. Given their interest in
strengthening the authority of their
sacred texts, many Hindus identify this
author with the legendary sage
Bharadvaja, although there is no hard
evidence for this claim.
Bharata
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Dushyanta and the maiden Shakuntala;
Bharata is considered a partial incarna-
tion of the god Vishnu. Dushyanta and
Shakuntala are married in secret in a
gandharva marriage executed by their
mutual consent. Dushyanta must return
to his capital and leaves Shakuntala at
her home. While he is gone, she is cursed
by the sage Durvasas that her lover will
forget her. In time, Bharata is born and
Shakuntala goes off to search for her
beloved. She has to endure many trials
before the curse is broken. Since
Shakuntala and Dushyanta have been
married in secret, it takes some time
before Bharata is accepted as
Dushyanta’s legitimate son, and thus heir
to the throne. When Bharata finally
ascends the throne, he reigns for a long
time. After his reign the land of India
becomes traditionally known as Bharata.Bharatanatyam
Bharata
(2) In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Bharata is the
son of King Dasharatha by his wife
Kaikeyi and the righteous younger
brother of the god Rama, the epic’s pro-
tagonist. Bharata’s loyalty to his family
has to endure several tests. The strictest
one comes early in the epic when,
through Kaikeyi’s treachery, Rama is
sent into exile in the forest for fourteen
years, and Bharata is named king in his
place. Despite the obvious temptations
of wealth and power, Bharata refuses to
assume the throne in place of his
brother, curses his mother for her
deceit, and sets off to live in exile with
Rama. Rama commands Bharata to
return to Ayodhya and rule during
his exile, on the premise that the people
will suffer without a king. Bharata
reluctantly agrees to act as a temporary
king, but with two symbolic adjust-
ments: He moves the court from the
capital city of Ayodhya to the village
of Nandigrama as a symbol of Rama’s
exile, and throughout his rule sits at
the foot of the royal throne; a pair of
Rama’s sandals are placed upon the
throne as a symbol of the rightful king.
Many characters in the Ramayana
are paradigms for Indian cultural values,
and Bharata stands for the ideal younger
brother. In the traditional joint house-
hold the brothers are the heart of the
family, since it is they who remain at
home their entire lives, whereas their
sisters live with their husbands’ families
after they are married. The eldest brother
in every generation eventually becomes
the head of the joint family after the
older members have passed away. He
carries primary authority and responsi-
bility for the family as a whole but can-
not succeed without the cooperation of
his younger brothers, who must
acknowledge and support his authority.
By refusing to usurp his elder brother’s
rightful leadership, Bharata is a para-
digm for the ideal younger brother, who
puts aside his own desires and opportu-
nities to uphold and promote the wel-
fare of the family as a whole.
A dancer performs in the classical
Bharatanatyam form. She assumes the pose of
Nataraja, the “Lord of the Dance.”
Bharatanatyam
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Kathak,
Orissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Chau,
and Manipuri. Bharatanatyam has its
home in the temple towns of the state of
Tamil Nadu, particularly Tanjore city’s
Brhadeshvar temple. This temple is
dedicated to the god Shiva, whose most
famous form is Nataraja, the “Lord of
the Dance.” According to tradition the
name bharata comes not from the sage
Bharata, the reputed author of the text
on dance called the Natyashastra , but
from an acronym of the dance’s three
most important elements: “bha” from
bhava (“feeling”), “ra” from raga
(“melodic mood”), and “ta” from tala
(“rhythm”). The second word in the
name, natyam, simply means “dance.”
Bharatanatyam’s historical roots are
uncertain. The existence of dance can
be dated to the early centuries C.E. since
[[103]]
Bharati Dashanami
it is mentioned in the two Tamil epic
poems,
Shilappadigaram
and
Manimegalai. Carvings at the Shiva
temple in Kanchipuram suggest that
this dance was well developed in the
Pallava dynasty (6th–9th c. C.E.), but
hard evidence for structured temple
dance, including the hereditary dancers
known as devadasis, did not appear
until the Chola dynasty (9th–14th c. C.E.).
Although royal patronage was an impor-
tant
factor
in
its
survival,
Bharatanatyam was performed primari-
ly in the temples until the twentieth cen-
tury, when the dance began to be
performed on stage.
As an artistic form, the dance’s pre-
sent technique was codified in the early
nineteenth century by four brothers in
the service of Raja Serfoji II of Tanjore.
Stylistically, Bharatanatyam presents a
sharply geometric line. The most char-
acteristic posture has a stiff upper torso,
with the knees flexed outward in line
with the rest of the body, and the feet
spread gently outward. This posture is a
recurring motif in any performance. As
in all the Indian dances, Bharatanatyam
has a well-developed vocabulary of ges-
ture and expression, which makes it
possible for the dancer to tell complex
stories. Like most other Indian dance
forms, Bharatanatyam has been influ-
enced by the shift from temple to
stage as its primary theater. Although its
roots lie in worship and devotion, the
move to the stage has inevitably disrupt-
ed some of these religious connections.
For further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Bharati Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century
philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
[[104]]

different name—in this case, bharati
(“Indian”). Upon initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten divisions are divided into four
larger organizational groups. Each
group has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya, as
well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Bharati Dashanamis belong
to the Bhuriwara group, which is affili-
ated with the Shringeri Math in the
southern Indian town of Shringeri. The
Bharati division is elite because it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins. Other such divisions are the
Saraswati
Dashanamis,
Tirtha
Dashanamis, and Ashrama Dashanamis.
The Bharatis are unusual, however,
since only part of the division is
restricted to brahmins.
Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) Modern Indian political party with
a strong Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)
orientation. The party was formed as the
political wing of the Hindu nationalist
organization known as Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and many of
the BJP’s leaders have been RSS members
for decades. The BJP was formed in 1980
after the dissolution of its predecessor
organization, the Jana Sangh. The latter
was an RSS affiliate as well, several of the
whose leaders, notably Lal Krishna
Advani and Atal Behari Vajpayee, have
also led the BJP. At first the BJP took a
moderate political stance and fared
quite poorly, winning only two seats in
the 1984 elections. In the later 1980s it
took a far more militant tone, stressing
as its focal issue the campaign to build
the Ram Janam Bhumi temple in
Ayodhya. As the Indian electorate grew
more religiously polarized, the BJP
climbed to eighty-six seats in 1989 and
[[120]]
 seats in 1991. In the 1996 elections it
won 160 seats, becoming the largest sin-
gle party in India’s 535-seat Parliament.Bharatmilap
The president of India invited the BJP to
form a government, but this failed when
it was unable to gain enough support
from other parties to muster a majority
of votes in Parliament.
The BJP’s traditional constituency has
been brahmins and members of the
trading communities, both of whom
tend to be religiously conservative and
supportive of the Hindutva message. In
the mid-1990s the BJP muted its Hindu
nationalist rhetoric in an attempt to
reach beyond these traditional con-
stituencies and to gain more widespread
support by moving closer to the political
center. Despite these changes, many of
the established secular parties still view
the BJP with suspicion and have refused
to ally themselves with the organization.
The BJP’s inability to mobilize such sup-
port among the larger body politic was a
major factor behind the collapse of its
short-lived government in 1996. The
country was then run by a coalition of
thirteen secular political parties, whose
single binding commitment is their
opposition to the BJP. However, since
[[1998]]
 the BJP has succeeded in building
coalitions to form a government. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; and
Christophe Jaffrelot, The Hindu
Nationalist Movement in India, 1996.
Bharat Mata
(“Mother India”) Modern Hindu “deity”
whose primary image is a map of the
subcontinent,
often
prominently
marked with the network of India’s
sacred sites (tirthas). The presupposi-
tion behind most of these particular
sacred sites is that the land itself is holy,
but the idea of Bharat Mata takes this
idea to a more abstract level, sanctifying
the whole subcontinent. Although this
map and its image of Mother India are
usually not actual objects of worship,
they carry important symbolic mes-
sages. In an abstract way, the holiness of
Mother India unites all Hindus regard-
less of their sectarian affiliation.
Moreover, it suggests that India is one
unified culture despite its striking
regional diversity. These ideas can be
found in specific areas, particularly in
the networks of tirthas knitting the
country together, yet in contemporary
times this image’s underlying purpose is
often political rather than religious.
At times it simply represents
national pride, but at other times it has
a more sinister hidden agenda. This
identification of Indian culture with the
motherland can be used as a way to
marginalize religious minorities—pri-
marily Muslims and Christians, whose
holy places lie in other countries—as
“foreigners,” and people whose patrio-
tism and connection to the Indian
nation are potentially suspect.
Bharatmilap
(“Meeting Bharata”) A particular scene
in the dramas known as the Ram Lila,
which are reenactments of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. This scene records the
meeting between the god Rama and his
brother Bharata, which takes place after
Rama has been in exile for fourteen
years, during which Bharata has faith-
fully served as ruler in his brother’s
place. According to connoisseurs of the
Ram Lila, this brief scene is filled with
some of the most rapturous emotion in
the play. Certainly there is the exaltation
that the time of separation has ended,
but the scene’s popularity also comes
from the way it reflects certain basic cul-
tural values. The brothers are consid-
ered the heart of the traditional Indian
joint family since they remain at home
their entire lives, whereas their sisters
become part of their marital families.
The eldest brother in every generation
eventually becomes the head of the joint
household, but he cannot succeed with-
out the support and cooperation of his
younger brothers. Rama and Bharata are
thus models for the brothers in a tradi-
tional joint family: Rama for treating his
younger brother with love and care, and
Bharata for obediently carrying out his

older brother’s wishes for the good of the
family as a whole.
(“Three Hundred”), a three-part collec-
tion of poems on political life, love, and
renunciation. According to legend,
Bhartrhari was born the son of the brah-
min Vidyasagara and his shudra wife,
Mandakini. Vidyasagara was the adviser
to the king of Kalinga and was given the
kingdom upon the ruler’s death; after
Vidyasagara’s death Bhartrhari’s brothers
designated him as king. Bhartrhari was
very happy until he realized that his wife
was being unfaithful to him. When her
secret was discovered she tried to poi-
son him. Completely disillusioned,
Bhartrhari renounced the world to live
as an ascetic, during which time he
reputedly composed his poetry.
Although this is a good story, since
many of these poems stress the degra-
dation inherent in courtly life,
Bhartrhari was most likely a courtier. His
poetry treats all of the conventional pur-
poses of life. The first two sections are
about power (artha), sensual desire
(kama), and righteous action (dharma),
whereas the final section is concerned
with the ultimate end, or liberation of
the soul (moksha). For further informa-
tion see Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.),
The Hermit and the Love-Thief, 1978.
Bharavi
(6th c. C.E.) Sanskrit dramatist who is
best known as the author of the drama
Kiratarjuniya. This play describes the
meeting between the god Shiva, dis-
guised as the tribal hunter Kirata, and
the warrior-hero Arjuna. Arjuna is one
of the five Pandava brothers, who are
the heroes of the epic Mahabharata. In
Hindu mythology, Arjuna is the world’s
greatest warrior, but he is also afflicted
with pride. The play describes how the
arrogant Arjuna becomes humbled at
the hands of this tribal hunter, who in
contemporary terms would be of very
low social status. In the end, however,
Shiva reveals his true form to Arjuna and
blesses him for his valor.

first exponent of the Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) philosophical
school. The period during which
Bhartrprapancha flourished is uncer-
tain, but he precedes the eighth-century
Bhedabhada commentator Bhaskara.
The Bhedabhada position identified
three levels of being: the Ultimate
Reality known as Brahman, the “wit-
ness” consciousness (sakshin) in the
human being, and the world. This
school paradoxically asserted that these
three levels were identical, yet different.
Thus the world is identical to Brahman
but subject to change and decay, unlike
Brahman. In the same way, while each
human soul is identical to Brahman, it is
also subject to bondage and reincarna-
tion (samsara), unlike Brahman. TheBhaskara
bondage of the soul was caused by the
primal ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination of
action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosophi-
cal problem for Bhartrprapancha
and his followers came from their belief
that Brahman was actually transformed
into both the world and the Self, a
philosophical outlook known as parina-
mavada. Since they believed that
Brahman underwent real changes, it
was subject to bondage and ignorance.
This position was untenable and unac-
ceptable from a religious perspective
because Brahman was deemed to be
perfect and unchanging. This difficulty
may account for the school’s relatively
short life.The need for commentary was presup-
posed in most texts on Hindu philoso-
phy as well as in the secret ritual
tradition known as tantra. Philosophical
works were often nothing more than
collections of brief aphorisms, which
were intentionally kept short to
facilitate memorization but which
clearly needed further explanation. In
the case of tantra, commentary was
essential because the texts were written
using coded language to conceal their
contents from the uninitiated. This
may have been in the form known as
sandhabhasha, which often uses
erotic language to indicate religious
practice, or it may simply have been
a technical language in which
everyday words had contextual meanings.
BharudBhaskara
The name for a specific genre of bhakti
(devotional) poetry, found particularly
among the Varkari Panth, a religious
community centered around the wor-
ship of the Hindu god Vithoba at his
temple at Pandharpur, in the modern
state of Maharashtra. The bharud is
essentially a dramatic poem in which
the speaker takes on one or more roles
to convey the message of devotion to
God. It was especially favored by the
poet-saint Eknath, who used the genre
to adopt the personae of women,
untouchables, Muslims, and other mar-
ginal people. In modern times these
bharuds have become the basis for pop-
ular dramas, usually performed during
the biannual Varkari pilgrimage to
Pandharpur. While singing the songs of
the earlier saints during a pilgrimage is
an important religious act, these mod-
ern renditions are mainly for entertain-
ment. The actors playing the roles in
these bharuds frequently add in their
own words and actions, which are often
quite bawdy.In Indian philosophy, an eighth-cen-
tury proponent of the Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) school. The
Bhedabhada position identified three
levels of being: the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman, the “witness”
consciousness (sakshin) in the
human being, and the world. They
paradoxically asserted that these three
levels were identical, yet different.
Thus the world is identical to Brahman
but subject to change and decay,
unlike Brahman. In the same way,
while each human soul is identical
to Brahman, it is also subject to
bondage and reincarnation (samsara),
unlike Brahman. The bondage of the
soul was caused by the primal
ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination
of action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosoph-
ical problem for the Bhedabhada
school was that because they believed
that Brahman was actually trans-
formed into the world and the Self
(parinamavada), it followed that
Brahman was subject to bondage and
ignorance. This idea was difficult to
defend, since the transcendence of
Brahman was well established by
Bhashya
(“commentary”) Any commentary,
whether on a text or an oral teaching.
[[107]]
Bhasmasur
sacred texts such as the Upanishads,
and this problem may account for the
school’s relatively short life.
Bhasmasur
In Hindu mythology, a demon with great
power but limited intelligence.
According to tradition, the god Shiva
has given Bhasmasur the power to
change anyone to ash (bhasma) simply
by placing his hand on that person’s
head. Bhasmasur falls in love with
Shiva’s wife Parvati and attempts to
place his hand on Shiva’s head, and the
god has to flee. Bhasmasur is destroyed
when the god Vishnu tricks him into
putting his hand on top of his own head,
which instantly transforms him into ash.
In metaphorical usage, the term
Bhasmasur denotes any problem that
has grown out of hand through lack
of foresight.
Bhava
(“being”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
Bhavabhuti
(early 8th c. C.E.) Sanskrit dramatist and
playwright noted for his ability to
express and transmit emotions through
language. His best-known play, the
romance Malatimadhava , is famous
not only in its own right, but because the
primary villain is an evil ascetic believed
to be a member of the defunct ascetic
group known as Kapalikas. The
Kapalikas were devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva, and their reputed practices emu-
lated Shiva in his wrathful form as
Bhairava. They wore their hair long and
matted, smeared their bodies with ash
(preferably from the cremation
ground), and carried a club and a skull
bowl (kapala). According to some
sources, they also indulged in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs, per-
forming human sacrifice, and orgiastic
sexuality—which caused them to be
avoided and feared. Bhavabhuti’s
[[108]]

description of this evil ascetic and his
disciples is one of the earliest datable
references to the Shaiva form of asceti-
cism, and therefore important from a
historical perspective.
Bhavani
(feminine form of Bhava) Epithet of the
god Shiva’s wife, Parvati. See Parvati.
Bhavas
(“states”) In Indian aesthetics the
bhavas are a set of nine states consid-
ered the most basic unadulterated emo-
tions: sexual excitement, laughter, grief,
anger, energy, fear, loathing, wonder,
and peace. To these nine bhavas corre-
spond the nine rasas (“tastes”), or
moods transmitted by various types of
artistic expression: the erotic, comic,
compassionate, cruel, heroic, terrifying,
loathsome, marvelous, and peaceful.
Although these bhavas and rasas clearly
correspond to one another, there is an
important difference between them. A
person’s emotive states come and go in
response to circumstances that are often
beyond one’s control. Because such nat-
urally occurring emotions usually can-
not be sustained, they are generally not
objects of aesthetic satisfaction. This is
not true in the case of rasa, since mood
can be artificially generated by an artis-
tic endeavor. Any particular rasa can
thus be sustained and satisfying. The
single most dominant aim in all the
Indian arts, therefore, is to create such a
mood or moods for the audience.
Bhave, Vinobha
(1895–1982) Social and religious
reformer whose basic principles reflected
his long association with Mohandas K.
Gandhi, to whom Bhave came as a disci-
ple in 1916. Bhave was one of Gandhi’s
close associates in the struggle for inde-
pendence and was particularly
absorbed with Gandhi’s idea of village
self-sufficiency. In the years after inde-
pendence, he traveled around India on
foot to meet the people. It was on oneBhima
such tour that he started the Bhoodan
(“land gift”) movement, the purpose of
which was to obtain donations of land
for the poor. Much of Bhave’s life after
independence was devoted to village
development, in particular through a
movement called Sarvodaya (“welfare of
all”), which sought to solve problems
through collective involvement and ser-
vice to one another.
Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) Philosophical
school whose best-known figures were
Bhartrprapancha and Bhaskara. The
Bhedabhada position identified three
levels of being: the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman, the “witness” con-
sciousness (sakshin) in the human
being, and the world. The school para-
doxically asserted that these three levels
are identical, yet different. Thus the
world is identical to Brahman but is sub-
ject to change and decay, unlike
Brahman. In the same way, while each
human soul is identical to Brahman, it is
also subject to bondage and reincarna-
tion (samsara), unlike Brahman. The
bondage of the soul was caused by the
primal ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination of
action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosophi-
cal problem for Bhartrprapancha and
his followers was that because they
believed that Brahman was actually
transformed into the world and the Self
(parinamavada), it followed that
Brahman was subject to bondage and
ignorance. Thus, if one must destroy
avidya to gain liberation, one must also
destroy part of Brahman. These were
difficult ideas to defend since the tran-
scendence of Brahman was well estab-
lished by sacred texts such as the
Upanishads, and this problem may
account for the school’s relatively
short life.
Bhil
The name of a tribal (adivasi) group
found in greatest numbers in the
Vindhya Mountains, in the eastern part
of the state of Madhya Pradesh. They
are historically associated with the for-
est, particularly with hunting and gath-
ering honey. As with many tribal groups,
their homeland is often in marginal
lands, and most of them are quite poor.
Bhima
The third of the five Pandava brothers
who
are
the
heroes
in
the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. Bhima is born when his
mother, Kunti, uses a powerful mantra
(sacred sound) to have a son by the
wind-god, Vayu. Of all the Pandavas,
Bhima is the largest and strongest, and
his favorite weapon is the club, which
requires great physical strength. This
strength is one of the sources of enmity
between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas (cousins of the Pandavas),
since during their adolescent training,
Bhima can always draw on his superior
power to outdo his cousins. His earthy
and untamed nature is evident through
his consumption of strange foods as well
as from his liaison with the rakshasi
(female demon) Hidambi, by whom he
has a son, Ghatotkacha. Bhima’s notable
deeds tend to be feats of strength. In
many cases this involves killing demons,
such as Bakasur or Hidamba in hand-to-
hand combat; but Bhima is also a major
figure in the Mahabharata war, in which
he uses his club to kill great masses of the
Kaurava army.
Besides his strength and unusual
appetites, which make him a figure sub-
ject to caricature, Bhima is also
absolutely devoted to his brothers and
to their common wife, Draupadi.
Whenever her honor is at stake, Bhima is
the person to whom she turns. When
Draupadi is molested by Kichaka during
the year that the Pandavas spend incog-
nito at the court of King Virata, Bhima
disguises himself as Draupadi, goes to
meet Kichaka, and kills him. It is also
Bhima who vows to kill the two
Kaurava brothers, Duhshasana and
Duryodhana, because of their behavior
toward Draupadi after Bhima’s brother
[[109]]
Bhima River
western ghats and meeting with the
Krishna in the state of Karnataka. At the
Bhima’s headwaters can be found
Bhimashankar, which is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a group of sacred
sites (tirthas) deemed especially holy
to the god Shiva. Aside from
Bhimashankar, another important reli-
gious site on the Bhima is the temple of
Vithoba at Pandharpur.
Bhimashankar
Bhima River at Pandharpur,
in the state of Maharashtra.
Yudhishthira loses an important game
of dice. Duhshasana drags Draupadi
into the hall by her hair, her garments
stained with menstrual blood, and
Duryodhana bares his thigh (a
euphemism for the genitals) toward
Draupadi and directs her to sit on his
lap. Bhima vows that to avenge these
insults he will rip open Duhshasana’s
chest so that Draupadi can wash her
hair in his blood, and smash
Duryodhana’s thigh with his club.
Although it takes thirteen years before
he carries out these promises, in the end
he avenges Draupadi’s honor. After the
Mahabharata war, Bhima aids his
brother Yudhishthira in reigning as king.
After Yudhishthira abdicates the throne,
Bhima travels with him and their other
brothers on a great journey to the
Himalayas, where Bhima eventually
dies of exposure.
Bhima River
A central Indian tributary of the
Krishna River, rising in the state of
Maharashtra, on the inland side of the
[[110]]

(“Bhima’s Shiva”) One of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sacred sites
(tirthas) deemed especially holy to the
god Shiva. Bhimashankar is the name of
both the place and the presiding deity. It
is located in Maharashtra’s Pune district
at the source of the Bhima River, hence
its name. Unlike many of the other
jyotirlingas, Bhimashankar is visited little
during the year since it is far from urban
centers and relatively inaccessible. The
major pilgrim traffic comes on the festi-
val of Shivaratri, which usually falls
within February and March.
Bhishma
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Bhishma is the son of
King Shantanu and an uncle and coun-
selor to both warring factions, the
Pandavas and the Kauravas. His name
as a child is Devavrata; he receives the
name Bhishma (“terrible”) as an
acknowledgment of his extremely diffi-
cult vow. King Shantanu has fallen in
love with the maiden Satyavati, who
agrees to marry him on the condition
that her sons will rule instead of
Devavrata, who has already been
anointed the heir apparent. Bhishma
not only agrees to give up the throne but
takes the solemn vow that he will never
marry, so that there will be no claimants
from his lineage to compete for the
throne. When Bhishma takes his dread-
ful vow, he is also given the option of
choosing the time of his death.
Bhishma faithfully keeps this vow,
and his adherence to it eventually costsBhogawara
him his life. It is Bhishma who abducts
Amba, Ambika, and Ambalika, the
daughters of the king of Kashi, to
be married to his stepbrother
Vichitravirya. Ambika and Ambalika
happily marry Vichitravirya, but when
Amba confides that she has already
given her heart to King Salva, Bhishma
releases her to go to him. Salva rejects
Amba on the grounds that her virgin-
ity is suspect, since she has been
abducted by another man. Amba
returns to Bhishma and demands that
he marry her since he is responsible
for her plight, and when Bhishma
refuses to break his vow, Amba is
determined to get revenge. She is
reborn as the man-woman Shikhandi,
behind whom the Pandava prince
Arjuna hides to shoot the arrows that
eventually kill Bhishma.
Bhishma is a great man who is
respected by all. His skill with arms
makes him one of the finest warriors of
his time, but he is most famous as a wise
and generous counselor to both the
Pandavas and the Kauravas. Although
he ultimately sides with the Kaurava
prince Duryodhana in the war
between the two groups, before its
outbreak Bhishma repeatedly advises
Duryodhana to make peace with the
Pandavas and share the kingdom with
them. He fights valiantly in the
Mahabharata war and destroys a large
part of the Pandava armies, but finally
he is hit by so many of Arjuna’s arrows
that he lays upon them like a bed.
Although Bhishma is mortally wounded
by Arjuna, he delays his death (through
the boon given by his vow) until the sun
resumes its more auspicious northern
path (uttarayana). During this time he
gives the victorious Pandavas copious
instruction on state affairs and related
topics. Bhishma’s unswerving commit-
ment to a vow that deprives him of the
joys of family life, and his inability to
avert the fratricidal conflict between his
nephews, through which the family is
ultimately destroyed, make him a lonely,
somewhat tragic figure.
Bhishma Ashtami
Festival celebrated on the eighth day
(ashtami) of the light, or waxing, half of
the lunar month called Magh
(January–February), marking the death
of Bhishma. Bhishma is an uncle to
both the Kauravas and the Pandavas,
warring factions in the Hindu epic
Mahabharata. He is well known for his
bravery, continence, and truthfulness.
He also has the power to choose the
time of his death. Although he is mortal-
ly wounded in the great Mahabharata
war, he remains alive until weeks later
(delivering discourses and advice to the
victorious Pandavas the entire time),
delaying his death until the sun has
resumed
its
northward
course
(uttarayana). On this day parents give
offerings of food and water in
Bhishma’s name in the hope that their
sons may have his good qualities.
Bhogamandapa
(“food pavilion”) The outermost
entrance hall in the style of architecture
found in the largest temples in Orissa.
At the temple of Jagannath in Puri, the
term bhogamandapa specifically refers
to the area where the food offered to
Jagannath as prasad (“favor”) is cooked.
Jagannath’s temple is unusual in that the
normal restrictions regarding commen-
sality are suspended. Everyone eats
together rather than being segregated by
caste, signifying Jagannath’s ultimate
lordship over all beings. The promi-
nence of this particular rite makes the
bhogamandapa all the more important.
Bhogawara
One of the four major organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva; the other
three groups are Kitawara, Bhuriwara,
and Anandawara. Each of these divi-
sions has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each group also has
[[111]]
Bhoja
certain religious associations: with one
of the four Vedas, with a particular quar-
ter of the Indian subcontinent, with one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth, with a
specific ascetic quality, and with several
of the ten Dashanami divisions. The
Bhogawara group is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri on
the Bay of Bengal, and it is therefore
connected with the eastern quarter of
India. Their Veda is the Rg Veda, their
mahavakya is Prajnanam Brahman
(“Knowledge is Brahman”), and their
ascetic quality is to remain indifferent to
worldly pleasures. The particular
divisions associated with this group
are the Aranya Dashanamis and
Vana Dashanamis.
Bhoja
(r. 918–955 C.E.) Medieval Hindu king in
the Malwa region of the modern state of
Uttar Pradesh. Bhoja was famous both
as a scholar and as a dam builder who
created lakes for irrigation.
Bholanath
(“simple lord”) Common epithet of the
god Shiva. In ordinary usage the word
bhola carries a negative connotation:
“simple,” “guileless,” and even “foolish.”
Yet in using this word to designate Shiva,
his devotees (bhakta) are not intention-
ally insulting him but celebrating his
boundless generosity to those with
whom he is pleased. Shiva’s devotees
can give the simplest offerings (such as
leaves, fruit, and water) and in turn ask
for wealth, success, and power. Shiva’s
nature is considered “simple” because
he willingly participates in such unequal
exchanges, providing sharp contrast to
the world economy, which demands
equal value.
Bhramargit
(“songs to the bee”) Poetic genre in the
devotional poetry of the god Krishna,
which is set in the time after Krishna has
gone to claim his kingdom in Mathura,
[[112]]

never to return. The story tells how
Krishna sends his companion Uddhava
back to Braj with a message for the
gopis, the cowherd women who are
Krishna’s dear companions, and who are
virtually insane with longing because of
his absence. Uddhava tries to reassure
the gopis by telling them not to dwell on
Krishna’s physical absence. Uddhava
further reminds them that since Krishna
is the all-pervading divinity, he will
always be with them even though he
might not be visible. In the bhramargit
poems, the gopis scornfully reject
Uddhava’s notions, asserting that this
view of Krishna is abstract, lifeless, and
suitable only for those who have never
known Krishna in his embodied form.
The genre’s name comes from this
story’s earliest appearance, in the
Bhagavata Purana. Here the gopis
address their complaints about
Krishna’s absence to a large black bee,
which in their passion and loneliness
they mistake for Krishna.
Bhramari
(“circling”) Powerful form of the
Goddess. Bhramari takes form to
oppose the demon Aruna, who in his
hubris is trying to compromise the
chastity of the gods’ wives. They implore
the Goddess to help them, and in her
form as Bhramari, she kills the demon
and removes the threat. Bhramari is
worshiped on the eighth night of
Navaratri, a nine-day festival in which
one goddess is appeased every night.
Bhrgu
In Hindu mythology, one of the sons of
Brahma and one of the seven sages
whose names mark exogamous clan
“lineages” (gotra); the others are
Kashyapa, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Gautama, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All
brahmins are believed to be descended
from these seven sages, with each
family taking the name of its progenitor
as its gotra name. In modern times these
divisions are still important sinceBhushundi
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
After her marriage the bride adopts
her husband’s gotra as part of her
new identity.
Bhrgu is most famous for testing the
three major Hindu gods, which results
in Vishnu being declared the greatest of
the three. Bhrgu first goes to Brahma’s
house where the god does not pay Bhrgu
appropriate respect, and in revenge
Bhrgu curses Brahma to receive no wor-
ship. Next he goes to see Shiva, who
refuses to meet with him because he is
making love to his wife Parvati at the
time. In turn, Bhrgu curses Shiva to be
worshiped as the linga, the pillar-
shaped symbol that has undeniable
phallic associations. Lastly he visits
Vishnu and, finding him asleep, gives
him a sound kick in the chest. Vishnu
wakes up, but shows no anger at this dis-
respect. Instead he massages Bhrgu’s
foot, gently inquires whether it has been
hurt, and promises to retain its mark on
his chest forever, where it appears as the
shrivatsa. Vishnu’s magnanimous
behavior leads Bhrgu to proclaim him
the best of all the gods. Not surprisingly,
this version of the tale appears only in
Vaishnava sectarian literature. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Bhubaneshvar
Capital city of the modern Indian state
of Orissa. Bhubaneshvar reportedly has
over 500 temples, of which the most
prominent is the Lingaraja Temple. It is
dedicated to Shiva in his form as
Tribhuvaneshvar (“Lord of the Triple
World”), from which the city also gets
its name.
Bhudevi
See earth.
Bhujangavalaya
(“snake bracelet”) In Hindu iconogra-
phy, the name of a particular ornament
worn by the god Shiva. The bhujan-
gavalaya is a bracelet shaped in the form
of a snake. In Hindu mythology Shiva is
famous for wearing serpents, especially
cobras, as ornaments around his
arms and torso. This is just one of the
attributes that marks him as different,
powerful, and potentially dangerous.
The prescriptive canons for the creation
of Hindu images have followed up on
this tradition, and Shiva is invariably
shown wearing these bracelets.
Bhuriwara
One of the four major organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva; the other
three groups are Kitawara, Bhogawara,
and Anandawara. Each of these groups
has its headquarters in one of the four
monastic centers (maths) supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each division also has
certain religious associations: with one
of the four Vedas, with a particular quar-
ter of the Indian subcontinent, with one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth, with a partic-
ular ascetic quality, and with several of
the ten Dashanami divisions. The
Bhuriwara group is affiliated with the
Shringeri Math in the southern Indian
town of Shringeri and is thus connected
with the southern quarter of India. Their
Veda is the Yajur Veda, their mahavakya
is Aham Brahmasmi (“I am Brahman”),
and their ascetic quality is to renounce
all wealth and to live on food growing
wild in the jungles. The specific divi-
sions associated with this group are
Saraswati
Dashanami,
Bharati
Dashanami, and Puri Dashanami.
Bhushundi
A character in the Ramcharitmanas,
the version of the Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?).
Bhushundi is a crow who symbolizes the
power of devotion to God to redeem
even the lowest of creatures. One of the
most pronounced differences between
the original Valmiki Ramayana and the
Tulsidas Ramayana is that Tulsidas puts
[[113]]
Bhut
Women praying at a shrine in Bihar. This northern Indian state is home to many sacred sites.
far greater stress on devotion to Rama,
of which Bhushundi is a perfect exam-
ple. In Indian culture, crows are consid-
ered unclean birds since they are
scavengers who will eat anything. Yet in
one of the narrative levels of the
Ramcharitmanas, it is the “unclean”
crow Bhushundi who narrates the story
to the “sacred” eagle Garuda—the vehi-
cle of the god Vishnu. As part of his
account in the Ramayana, Bhushundi
relates the terrifying experience of being
given an unmediated vision of Rama in
all his majesty, and how he (as did the
sage Markandeya) went into Rama’s
mouth and perceived the entire uni-
verse inside.
Bhut
(“[someone who] was”) The spirit of a
person who has recently died, which is
still inappropriately connected to the
world of the living. This is often a trou-
bling or malevolent presence, either to
the departed’s family or the general pop-
ulation. Bhuts and other malignant spir-
its, such as prets or churails, have
generally either suffered an untimely or
[[114]]

violent death or died with certain unful-
filled desires, particularly relating
to marriage and family life. In cases
where both these factors are present, the
likelihood of the departed becoming a
bhut is deemed much greater. Bhuts
make themselves known to the living
through either dreams or possession. In
some cases they have specific requests
and can be placated by worship and
offerings. In such cases the dreams and
possession are methods of communi-
cating with the living, who can perform
the necessary actions. Some bhuts
resort to possession as an attempt to
realize their unfulfilled desires by
directly using a living person’s body.
These spirits are far more malevolent,
and the only way to remove them is
through exorcism. For further informa-
tion on the care of restless family spirits,
see Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988; for a masterful psycho-
logical interpretation of spirits, posses-
sion, and healing, see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.Bihar
BhutaBhutayajna
Epithet of the god Shiva. See Shiva.(“elemental lingas”) A network of five
southern Indian sacred sites (tirthas),
four in the state of Tamil Nadu and one
in Andhra Pradesh, all dedicated to the
god Shiva. In each of these centers, the
most sacred object is the linga, a pillar-
shaped form representing Shiva. What
makes these sites unique is that the
linga is supposedly composed of one of
the five primordial elements. Thus the
linga in Tiruvannamalai is formed from
fire; the linga in Jambukeshvar is
formed from water; the one in
Kanchipuram is made from earth; that
in Kalahasti, the sacred site in Andhra
Pradesh, is formed from air; and the
linga in Chidambaram is made from
space. Between them, these five sites
comprise a symbolic cosmology that
encompasses all created things.(“sacrifice to creatures”) One of the five
great sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
that is prescribed in the texts on reli-
gious duty (Dharma Shastras). These
five great sacrifices are daily religious
observances for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder born into
one of the three “twice-born” groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya,
and vaishya—who is eligible to receive
the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” Each sacri-
fice (yajna) is directed toward a different
class of beings, from the Ultimate
Reality down to animals, and is satisfied
by specific actions. The bhutayajna is
directed toward animals and outcasts
(and in some understandings, ghosts),
and it is satisfied by putting out food for
them to eat. In the time since the
Dharma Shastras were composed,
Hindu life has undergone significant
changes, and this particular sacrifice is
rarely performed today.
BhutamBidhai Samaroh
Bhutalingas
(7th c. C.E.) With Pey and Poygai, one of
the first three Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. Their stress
on passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, trans-
formed and revitalized Hindu religious
life. According to tradition, the three
men were caught in a torrential storm,
and one by one they took shelter in a
small dry spot, with each making room
for the next. As they stood together they
felt a fourth presence, which was
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy
was sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s mani-
festation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,
the three burst into song, which formed
the first of their compositions. For fur-
ther information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975.
(“farewell celebration”) In northern
India, the formal departure of a new
bride for her marital home. This is a
momentous event for several different
reasons. A marriage is the start of a fam-
ily, and through her marriage a young
woman gets the opportunity to become
a wife and mother; these roles are still
seen as a woman’s highest fulfillment
and happiness. Yet according to the tra-
ditional model of the Indian joint family,
after marriage a woman goes to live with
and becomes part of her husband’s fam-
ily. Thus the act of seeing off a new bride
carries bittersweet feelings—happiness
for her marriage and hopes for her good
fortune, but also the sense that things
have irreversibly changed.
Bihar
One of the states in modern northern
India, sandwiched between Uttar
Pradesh and West Bengal, with Nepal
on its northern border. Bihar has an
[[115]]
Bijak
incredibly rich history; it was the ances-
tral homeland of the Maurya dynasty,
which ruled over much of the Indian
subcontinent between the fourth and
third centuries before the common era.
The capital city was at Pataliputra, iden-
tified with modern Patna. Bihar also
contains the town of Bodh Gaya, where
the Buddha attained enlightenment,
in addition to many other places
associated with events in his life.
Despite this lush past, modern Bihar
is an extremely difficult place to live;
illiteracy and infant mortality rates are
very high, life expectancy is fairly low,
and social conditions can best be
described as feudal. Most of its citizens
can barely make a living and do so
through agriculture, while a small per-
centage are fabulously wealthy. Bihar is
also a textbook example of what modern
Indians call the “criminalization of poli-
tics,” in which known criminals are
either agents for politicians or are them-
selves holding political office. Although
Bihar has abundant mineral resources,
its pervasive corruption virtually ensures
that their benefits will reach only a few.
Despite all of these disadvantages, Bihar
does have well-known sacred sites
(tirthas). One of these is the town of
Gaya, famous as a place to perform
funerary rites (antyeshthi samskara).
Another sacred place is the temple at
Vaidyanath, which is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sites especially
sacred to the god Shiva. For general
information about Bihar and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference
is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed.,
Lonely Planet, 1998.
Bijak
(“inventory”) One of the three main col-
lections of verse ascribed to the poet-
saint Kabir (mid-15th c.?); the other two
are found in the Adigranth and the
manuscripts of the religious organiza-
tion Dadupanth. Kabir is the best
known of the sants, an umbrella term
for a group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who share several
[[116]]

concepts: stress on individualized, inte-
rior religion leading to a personal expe-
rience of the divine; disdain for external
ritual, particularly image worship; faith
in the power of the divine Name; and a
tendency to ignore conventional caste
distinctions. Of all the sants, Kabir is the
most iconoclastic with regard to estab-
lished religious practices and authori-
ties. He invariably emphasizes the need
for individual searching and realization.
Given the content of Kabir’s message,
it is notable that the Bijak is the scrip-
ture of the Kabirpanth, a religious com-
munity claiming to be his followers.
Certainly Kabir himself would have con-
demned the notion of making him the
founder of anything, or of his verses
gaining the authority of a scripture. In
content, the Bijak contains verses of
varying types: short epigrams that have
become proverbial wisdom, longer stan-
zas in the chaupai form, and shorter
two-line verse (doha). Linguistic fea-
tures identify the Bijak as belonging to
the eastern part of the Hindi language
region, hence its common name as the
“eastern” recension. For translations of
the text itself, see Linda Hess and
Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak of
Kabir, 1983.
Bijakshara
(“seed syllable”) In the esoteric ritual
tradition known as tantra, a bijakshara
is a particular set of syllabic utterances
that is believed to have an intimate con-
nection with a deity—either as a way of
gaining access to the god’s power or as
the subtlest form of the deity itself.
These syllables are usually meaningless
sounds (for example, aum, hrim, klim),
although at times they may contain
actual words. Bijaksharas are important
not for their meaning but for the power
inherent in the sounds themselves. The
transmission of such seed syllables and
the entitlement (adhikara) to use them
is an important feature of tantric initia-
tion (diksha). For further information
see Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and DouglasBirth

Cities, 1990.
Bilva
The wood-apple tree (Aegle marmelos).
Although this tree is known for its deli-
cious fruit, its primary religious impor-
tance is its leaves. These are used in the
worship of Shiva and are usually placed
as an offering on the god’s image or
linga (pillar-shaped symbol). These
leaves are believed to be dearer to him
than any other offering. In everyday lan-
guage this tree is also commonly known
as the bel.
Bimbisara
(d. 494 B.C.E.) King of Magadha, the
region corresponding to modern Bihar,
whose reign ended shortly before the
traditionally accepted date for the death
of the Buddha. Bimbisara was an ener-
getic administrator who had designs on
ruling a much larger empire. To this end,
he tried to conquer and control large
parts of the Ganges basin. Bimbisara is
believed to have been the first king to
conceive of ruling a large empire,
although he was deposed and murdered
by his son Ajatashatru before he saw it
become a reality.
Bindu
(“drop”) In the Shrividya school, a par-
ticular branch of the esoteric ritual tra-
dition known as tantra, the bindu is the
name for the dot in the very center of the
shrichakra, which is a Shrividya sym-
bolic diagram (yantra) used in worship.
The shrichakra is composed of nine
interlocking triangles—four pointing up
and five pointing down—surrounded by
a double series of lotus petals and exte-
rior circular and angular walls. The
bindu symbolizes the ultimate unity of
the divine principles, Shiva and Shakti,
and by extension the unity of all reality.

Bindusara
(3rd c. B.C.E.) Son of Chandragupta
Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan
empire, and father of Ashoka, the
empire’s greatest figure. At Bindusara’s
accession the Mauryans controlled the
Indus and Ganges river basins.
Bindusara not only consolidated his
father’s gains, but also expanded
Mauryan control into the Deccan
region as far south as Mysore. He was
reportedly a man of universal tastes,
since tradition holds that he asked
Antiochus I, the Seleucid ruler of Syria,
for sweet wine, dried figs, and a sophist.
Antiochus apparently sent the first two
items but declared that Greek philoso-
phers were not for export. See also
Maurya dynasty.
Birla, Ghanshyamdas
(1894–1983) Patriarch of the Birla indus-
trial family. The Birlas made a fortune in
opium in the early decades of the twen-
tieth century and then diversified into a
variety of other industrial ventures.
Ghanshyamdas was a close friend of
Mohandas K. Gandhi and the major
financial supporter for Gandhi’s politi-
cal organization, the Indian National
Congress, to which Birla had given an
estimated 100 million rupees by the
time of independence. In his later years,
he devoted considerable money and
attention to building temples, sponsor-
ing religious and charitable trusts, and
performing other honorable deeds.
Birth
At its most basic level, birth is a biologi-
cal event, but it becomes a cultural
event by virtue of the rites performed for
and significance given to it. Different
Hindu communities show considerable
regional and sectarian variation in the
ways that they mark a birth, but several
themes remain fairly constant. Although
the birth of a child is a highly auspicious
occasion, it is also considered impure
because of the various bodily tissues
and fluids coming with it (blood,
[[117]]
Black Yajur Veda
amulets, is also quite common. For fur-
ther information see Lawrence Babb,
The Divine Hierarchy, 1975; and

and Redpainted Feet: Hindu Childbirth

and Rita M. Gross (eds.), Unspoken

Western Cultures, 2000.
Black Yajur Veda

of a boar to combat a demon.
membranes, amniotic fluid, placenta,
etc.). Thus, birth rituals usually include
rites of purification for both mother and
child, to remove this birth impurity
(sutakashaucha). For the mother this is
fairly simple: a bath after the birth fol-
lowed by baths during a period of seclu-
sion (7–10 days). The final rite for the
child, the head shaving known as the
chudakarana samskara, may not come
for years after the birth.
Aside from impurity (ashaucha),
another constant theme is the threat of
potential danger. Immediately after
birth, both mother and child are seen as
highly vulnerable, not only from envi-
ronmental stresses such as cold, fatigue,
or infection, but from ills brought on by
witchcraft or the evil eye (nazar). Given
this concern, it is not surprising that the
placenta and all other childbirth
byproducts are carefully collected and
disposed of, lest they be used for spells.
The period of seclusion after the birth is
intended both to prevent contact with
such malevolent forces and to ward
them off through rites of protection.
The mother is usually given massages
and fed strengthening foods to bolster
her resistance. The use of charms, or

Along with the White Yajur Veda, one of
the two major forms of the Yajur Veda,
one of the oldest Hindu religious texts.
The major difference between these two
forms is in the placement of explanatory
notes on the Vedic mantras (sacred
sounds) and their significance. The four
recensions of the Black Yajur Veda
include these notes in the text itself. In
contrast, the one recension of the White
Yajur Veda gathers these notes into an
appendix known as a Brahmana, which
gives its name to the second major stra-
tum of Vedic texts.

Blood
As with all bodily fluids, blood is consid-
ered ritually impure and a source of pol-
lution upon contact. Blood is also
deemed a “hot” and powerful substance,
not only by virtue of its impurity
(ashaucha), but also because of its con-
nection with life. Witches are popularly
seen as deriving their nourishment from
human blood. This highlights both their
malevolent character, since they can only
live by destroying others, and also their
marginal, antisocial quality, since they
feed on a substance considered violently
impure. In another context, blood from
animal sacrifice is often offered to vil-
lage deities or to certain powerful and
terrifying forms of the Goddess. Any
deities taking blood sacrifice are consid-
ered “hot,” meaning that they are power-
ful enough to grant favors to devotees but
also marginal, potentially dangerous,Brahma
and requiring continual infusions of life-
sustaining blood to maintain their pow-
ers. See also witchcraft.
Boar Avatar
The third avatar, or “incarnation,” of the
god Vishnu. Vishnu takes this form at
the beginning of one of the cosmic ages,
when the process of creation has been
interrupted by the disappearance of the
Earth. The source of this problem is the
demon-king Hiranyaksha, who has
kidnapped the Earth and hidden her in
the depths of the cosmic ocean. Taking
the form of a giant boar, Vishnu dives to
the bottom of the ocean, where he slays
Hiranyaksha, places the Earth on the tip
of his tusk, and lifts her from the waters.
With the reappearance of the Earth, the
process of creation resumes.
It is generally accepted that the
avatar doctrine provided a way to assim-
ilate smaller regional deities into the
larger pantheon by designating them as
forms of Vishnu. This inference is
supported by the Boar avatar, which
seems to have absorbed an ancient cult
in central India by making the boar an
incarnation of Vishnu. In modern times
the Boar avatar is worshiped little,
although it had a significant following
in the past, particularly in central
India. This is partly supported by the
sculptural record; the caves at Ellora
and Udayagiri have particularly
fine sculptural renditions of this
avatar. For further information see
Arthur Llewellyn Basham, The Wonder
That Was India, 1968.
Bose, Subhash Chandra
(1896–1945) Bengali politician and free-
dom fighter. Before World War II, Bose
had unsuccessfully contested with
Mohandas K. Gandhi for the leadership
of the Congress Party. Bose was more
impatient than Gandhi for the British to
leave, and he was more willing to expel
them by force. During World War II, Bose
used Japanese patronage to form the
Indian National Army (INA), whose
objective was to expel the British from
India by armed force. Starting in
Singapore the INA marched 5,000 miles
through Southeast Asia, but they were
ultimately defeated by the British army
at the city of Kohima in eastern India.
Although there is eyewitness testimony
that Bose died from burns stemming
from a plane crash in the final days of
the Pacific war, even today many
Bengalis believe that he is still alive and
living incognito.
Brahma
Brahma is the first member of the
Trimurti, the “three forms” of divinity
made up of the dominant male deities
in the Hindu pantheon: Brahma as the
creator of the universe, Vishnu as the
preserver or sustainer, and Shiva as the
destroyer. Brahma is usually portrayed
with four heads (the fifth having been
cut off by Bhairava, a wrathful form of
Shiva), and his animal vehicle is the
hamsa, or Indian goose.
According to one widely held myth,
during the time of cosmic dissolution
between world cycles, Vishnu floats in
the middle of the cosmic ocean, lying
on the giant serpent Shesha. When the
time for creation comes, a lotus
sprouts from Vishnu’s navel and opens
to reveal Brahma inside. Brahma takes
up the work of creation, and at the end
of the world cycle, Brahma returns to
the lotus, which is reabsorbed into
Vishnu. Because of his spontaneous
appearance at the beginning of every
cosmic age, one of the names for
Brahma is Svayambhu (“self-born”).
Unlike the Judeo-Christian belief, the
world is not created from nothing.
Brahma merely arranges the existing
elements of the universe into a coher-
ent and ordered cosmos.
Brahma is a major figure in the pan-
theon and is prominent in many
episodes in Hindu mythology. His myth-
ic presence often obscures the fact that
he is never worshiped as a primary
deity. In fact, he has only one temple
devoted to him in all of India, in
[[119]]
Brahmacharin
Pushkar. Some Hindus have attributed
this lack of worship to his status as the
creator. After all, since creation has been
completed, why should one bother with
Brahma, whose work is done? In the
puranas, texts on Hindu mythology, this
lack of worship is usually ascribed to a
curse—sometimes by the god Shiva but
in other stories by the sage Bhrgu.
Brahmacharin
(“seeker of Brahman”) A term with sev-
eral possible meanings depending on
the context. In the dharma literature,
which gives instruction on religious
duties, a brahmacharin is a person in a
period of religious study. This period is
the first of the four ashramas (“stages of
life”) of a twice-born man, that is, a man
born into one of three groups in Indian
society: brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya.
Such men are eligible to receive the ado-
lescent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” According to the ideal,
after his initiation and adornment with
the sacred thread—the most visible sign
of a twice-born man—the brah-
macharin shall live in his guru’s house-
hold and study the Veda, the oldest
Hindu religious text, in addition to per-
forming other religious acts. Since brah-
macharins are focused on gaining
religious knowledge, this is supposed to
be a very austere time of life marked by
strict celibacy, hard work, service to the
teacher, meticulous observance of all
religious rites, and avoidance of luxuries
such as beds, cosmetics, and bodily
ornaments. Once this period of study is
over, the student will marry and enter
the second ashrama, that of the house-
holder. The system described in the
dharma literature is an idealized model,
and one cannot be sure that it was ever
strictly followed. Although many con-
temporary brahmin boys still undergo
the “second birth,” other elements—
such as the ascetic lifestyle and empha-
sis on the study of the Veda—are largely
ignored in contemporary times.
Some of the term’s original mean-
ing remains in an ascetic context.
[[120]]

Brahmacharin can also be defined as a
novice or junior monk, whose duty is to
serve and learn from the senior monks,
or as the name of two particular ascetic
groups. One of these groups is the pres-
tigious Swaminarayan sect, whose
members are recruited solely from the
caste of brahmins. The other is an orga-
nization called the Brahmachari
Sanyasis, devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva who are distinct from the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Brahmachari
Sanyasis have an ashram on Mount
Girnar and in the bathing (snana)
festival known as the Kumbha Mela,
the Brahmachari Naga (fighting)
Sanyasis have a recognized place
among the other Naga groups. For
further information see G. S. Ghurye,
Indian Sadhus, 1964.
Brahmacharya
(“going after Brahman”) In its most tra-
ditional sense, this word refers to the
lifestyle of a young man belonging to a
particular class during his life as a stu-
dent (brahmacharin). This period is the
first of the four ashramas (“stages of
life”) of a twice-born man, that is, a
man born into one of three groups in
Indian society: brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya. Such men are eligible to
receive the adolescent religious initia-
tion known as the “second birth.” His
life as a student will then commence,
and he will move into his guru’s house-
hold and study the sacred texts, the
Vedas. This is conceived as a period of
intense study, religious practice, and an
austere lifestyle marked by the restraint
of desires, for which the hallmark is
celibacy. Although the model of the
four ashramas is largely archaic in mod-
ern times, the word brahmacharya still
connotes this sort of austere religious
lifestyle, and it is often used as a syn-
onym for celibacy.
Brahmahatya
(“brahmin murder”) In the dharma lit-
erature, which gives instruction on reli-
gious duties, brahmahatya is one of theBrahma Marriage
four great crimes that makes one an
outcast from society. This crime’s seri-
ousness stems from notions of brahmin
sanctity and status; with the exception
of self-defense, the deliberate murder of
a brahmin holds serious repercussions.
Even the gods are subject to this act’s
negative karmic consequences. Hindu
mythology records that the god
Bhairava wanders the earth for years
after cutting off one of the heads of the
god Brahma. The skull sticks to his
hand as a visible sign of his crime until it
finally falls off at Kapalamochana. In
the more lenient prescriptions in the
dharma literature, the punishment for a
brahmin murderer is parallel to that of
Bhairava. The murderer has to carry the
skull of the dead man for twelve years,
wearing only a rough garment to cover
his loins, and during that period he has
to live on alms, begging at no more
than seven houses per day. After twelve
years he is deemed pure, unless the
murder was intentional, in which case
the term of punishment is doubled.
According to several commentators,
however, when a brahmin is intention-
ally murdered by a kshatriya, vaishya,
or shudra, the only possible expiation
(prayashchitta) is death.
Brahma Kumaris
Modern Hindu religious organization
founded in the 1930s by a Sindhi jeweler
named Dada Lekhraj. In 1947, after the
partition of British India into India and
Pakistan, the organization relocated its
headquarters from Sindh (in modern
Pakistan) to Mount Abu in the Indian
state of Rajasthan. Although the sect
has only about 100,000 members—
minuscule by Hindu standards—it is
noteworthy for several reasons. Unlike
most Hindus, the Brahma Kumaris
aggressively seeks out and converts new
members, and thus it has a much higher
profile than other religious sects. The
organization preaches a doctrine fore-
telling the imminent end of the world,
which must be prepared for by radical
asceticism. It is also noteworthy that
since its beginning, the majority of its
adherents have been women.
The movement began following a
series of apocalyptic visions by Dada
Lekhraj. These visions not only con-
vinced him of the coming tribulation
but also reinforced his conviction that a
human being’s real identity lay not in
the body but in the soul. This latter real-
ization resulted in the organization’s
adoption of complete celibacy. When
this ideal was adopted by some of his
young women followers, it initially led to
a tremendous uproar, because they
renounced their primary traditional
roles as wives and mothers. The move-
ment persisted despite these troubles,
which bound the followers together
even more tightly. By the time Dada
Lekhraj died in 1969, the movement had
developed a strong missionary bent. All
of these factors make it unusual and, in
the eyes of many ordinary Hindus, mar-
ginal and suspicious. For further infor-
mation see Lawrence Babb, Redemptive
Encounters, 1987.
Brahma Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a
marriage according to the Dharma
Shastras, the treatises on religious
duty (dharma). In a Brahma marriage
the bride’s father gives away his
daughter, along with any ornaments
he can afford, to a learned man of
good character. This man is respect-
fully invited to accept her with
absolutely no conditions or fees. This
form is considered the most suitable
for Brahmans because it is free from
lust or any sort of financial induce-
ments, hence the name Brahma mar-
riage. For these reasons it is also
deemed the best of the four approved
(prashasta) forms of marriage.
The Brahma marriage is one of the
two forms practiced in modern India. It
is by far the more socially respectable,
since the asura marriage—in which the
groom gives money to the bride and her
family—carries the connotation of sell-
ing the bride. Yet even with the Brahma
[[121]]
Brahma Muhurta
After death, a liberated person’s soul is believed to escape through an opening in the skull
called the brahmarandhra. This is thought to correspond to the fontanel,
an opening in an infant’s skull (right) that closes in adulthood (left).
marriage, there has been significant
divergence from the classically mandat-
ed form. In many modern Indian
weddings, it has become common for
the bride’s family to give the groom’s
family a dowry as a condition for
the marriage, which can easily be
interpreted as selling the groom. See
also marriage, eight classical forms,
and prashasta marriages.
Brahma Muhurta
(“time of Brahma”) The forty-eight-
minute period (muhurta) immediately
before sunrise, which is thought to be
the most auspicious time of the day.
This auspiciousness makes it the
best time for worship, meditation, or
any type of religious practice; serious
spiritual aspirants rise before it begins
so that they may take full advantage
of the time.
Brahman
In its first appearances in the Rg Veda,
the earliest text in the sacred literature
[[122]]

known as the Vedas, the term Brahman
both denotes the power inherent in, and
gives potency to, the sacred word. In the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the Vedas, brahman was the
name for one of the four types of priests
who officiated at a sacrifice (the others
being hotr, udgatr, and adhvaryum). In
the Upanishads and afterward,
Brahman is the generally accepted term
for the highest reality in the universe,
which is both the material cause and the
final cause of all that exists. In the world-
view of the Upanishads, the speculative
and most recent texts in the Vedas,
Brahman is the single binding unity
behind the world’s apparent diversity.
These texts also affirm Brahman’s iden-
tity with atman, the individual soul, and
thus the identity of the essence of
macrocosm and microcosm. As
described in many of the Upanishads
and later systematized by the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya (9th c.), the ulti-
mate form of Brahman is without
qualities (nirguna), formless, nameless,
indefinable, and grammatically a neuterBrahma Sampraday
noun. In contrast, particular deities are
seen as lower, provisional, qualified
(saguna) forms of Brahman. This under-
standing was modified by the influence
of later devotional trends, in which ideas
of the highest Brahman became identi-
fied with a particular deity, who was
seen as the ultimate source of all things.
Brahmana
General name for the second literary
stratum in the Vedas, the earliest and
most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Although the composition of
these differing parts of the Veda is not
completely linear, the Brahmanas gen-
erally come after the hymns of praise to
the gods known as samhitas and pre-
cede the speculative texts known as the
Aranyakas and the Upanishads. In the-
ory, each Veda has a Brahmana as an
appendix, which is intended to give fur-
ther explanation of the Vedic rituals.
Although the Yajur Veda is the only one
for which this is actually true, this
understanding gives the Brahmanas
the authority of revealed scripture
(shruti) and thus makes them unques-
tionable. There are several different
Brahmanas, of which the most impor-
tant are the Aiteraya Brahmana and
the Shatapatha Brahmana; the latter’s
tone and contents (including the Isha
Upanishad) clearly mark it as the most
recent of the Brahmanas.
The Brahmanas are primarily ritual
manuals, and they give exacting,
painstaking instructions for performing
these Vedic rituals. These texts indicate a
fundamental shift in religious practice,
from the earlier emphasis on sacrifice
as a means of invoking and pleasing the
Vedic gods to an importance on the
power of ritual itself. This new emphasis
makes the sacrificial priests the most
powerful people of all, since even the
gods themselves are subject to the ritu-
als. The power of correctly performed
ritual paves the way for the Aranyakas
and the Upanishads, which asks more
speculative questions about the rituals
themselves. At times these differing
religious genres are juxtaposed—as in
the Shatapatha Brahmana, in which the
Isha Upanishad is embedded. Such jux-
tapositions indicate that although the
stress varied in differing types of texts,
there was some overlap during the time
they were composed.
Brahmanda
See cosmic egg.
Brahmarandhra
(“aperture of Brahman”) In traditional
mystical physiology, an opening in the
crown of the head—perhaps corre-
sponding to the fontanel in young chil-
dren. Although this hole usually closes
up, it is widely believed that if at the time
of death the departing soul can be chan-
neled through this aperture, it will bring
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
The earliest mention of this idea can be
found in Katha Upanishad 6.16, and
exercises to facilitate this practice are
stressed in certain varieties of yoga. The
desire to open this aperture is the reason
behind one of the actions sometimes
performed during cremation. In many
cases the pyre’s heat will itself split the
skull, but when it does not, a long pole is
used to break it open in an effort to
release the soul.
Brahma Sampraday
One of the four branches of the Bairagi
Naga class of ascetics. The Bairagi Nagas
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, organized in military fashion
into different anis, or “armies.” Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century,
their primary occupation was as merce-
nary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these occupations have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times. The
Brahma Sampraday traces its immedi-
ate spiritual lineage through the
Gaudiya Vaishnava sect, founded by the
Bengali devotee Chaitanya, but claims
ultimate descent from the southern
Indian philosopher Madhva. This latter
[[123]]
Brahmasutra Bhashya
claim seems highly suspect, in part
because the guardian deities of the two
sects are different; Chaitanya and his
followers worship the gods Krishna and
Radha, whereas Madhva and his follow-
ers worship Lakshmi-Narayan. There
are also differences in their observances.
Although the Madhva ascetics have a
long history in southern India, they have
virtually no presence in the north, where
the Chaitanyite ascetics are well repre-
sented. Ghurye speculates that this
claim is based on the desire of the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas to establish ties to
an ancient lineage; this would give them
an unassailable identity and thus a place
in the bathing (snana) procession at
religious festival Kumbha Mela. See
G. S. Ghurye, Indian Sadhus, 1964.
Brahmasutra Bhashya
A commentary (bhashya) written by the
philosopher
Shankaracharya
on
Badarayana’s Brahma Sutras, a collec-
tion of 555 brief aphorisms (sutras) that
form the basis for the philosophical
school known as Vedanta. This com-
mentary is the defining text for the
Advaita Vedanta school of Indian phi-
losophy. Shankaracharya begins his
investigation by establishing the Self as
the basis of all knowledge, since the one
thing that can never be doubted is the
reality of the one who knows. He identi-
fies this knowing consciousness as the
eternal Self, or atman, which never
changes over time despite the vicissi-
tudes of the physical bodies it inhabits.
According to Shankaracharya, the per-
ceivable world is clearly subject to
change and thus is not the Absolute
Reality, which the philosopher identi-
fies as the unqualified, unchanging
Brahman. Following the Upanishads,
Shankaracharya identifies atman as
identical to Brahman. He states that for
human beings the reason for both
unhappiness and the bondage of the
soul is the ignorance of this relationship,
which causes one to mistake this per-
ceivable reality for the Ultimate Reality.
With the destruction of this mistaken
[[124]]

understanding, all bonds are broken,
and the person attains final liberation.
Brahma Sutras
Variant name for Badarayana’s Vedanta
Sutras, which date from the third to the
fifth century B.C.E. This collection of 555
brief aphorisms (sutras) is the basis for
the philosophical school known as
Vedanta, so named because it claims to
reveal the ultimate meaning of the reli-
gious scriptures known as the Vedas.
They are given the name Brahma Sutras
because they attempt to summarize and
systematize the philosophic and reli-
gious ideas in the speculative texts
known as the Upanishads, particularly
the ideas about the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman. The sutras are so
brief that they presuppose commentary,
of which the most famous is the
Brahmasutra Bhashya, written by the
philosopher Shankaracharya.
Brahmayajna
(“sacrifice to Brahman”) One of the five
great sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the texts on religious duty
(Dharma Shastras). These five great
sacrifices are prescribed daily religious
observances for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder who has
been born into one of three groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya. Such men are eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” Each of the five sacri-
fices (yajna) is directed toward a differ-
ent class of beings, from the Ultimate
Reality down to animals, and is satisfied
by different actions. The brahmayajna is
directed toward the Ultimate Reality
(Brahman) and is satisfied by teaching
and studying the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts. In the time since
the Dharma Shastras were composed,
Hindu life has undergone significant
change, but many brahmins still study
the Veda—if not daily, at some point in
their youth.Brahmo Samaj
Brahmi
The most commonly used script in the
inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka (r.
[[269]]
–232 B.C.E.), the greatest figure in the
Maurya dynasty. Ashoka’s empire
encompassed all of the subcontinent
except the deepest parts of southern
India and went west into modern
Afghanistan. Brahmi script was used in
all regions of the Mauryan empire
except in the northwest, where the
Kharoshthi script was used. Ashoka’s
rock edicts and pillar edicts are the ear-
liest significant Indian written docu-
ments and give invaluable information
about contemporary social, political,
and religious life. Brahmi is the ancestor
of the modern Indian scripts, including
Devanagari. It is also the ultimate
source for all indigenous southeast
Asian alphabets, which developed from
trade with southern India in the early
medieval period. Over the course
of time, Brahmi was replaced by
later scripts, was forgotten, and
became unreadable. Although Ashoka’s
inscriptions ensured that Europeans
were aware of Brahmi, their content was
a mystery until 1837, when James
Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi
alphabet by working backward from
later, known scripts.
Brahmin
In the traditional Hindu theory of the
four major social groups (varnas), the
brahmins are the group with the high-
est status, based on the belief that they
are purer than all others. This belief is
based on the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta, in which the brah-
mins are created from the Primeval
Man’s mouth. The mouth is part of the
head and thus the highest part of the
body, and it is also associated with
speech, one of the definitively human
faculties. From the earliest Hindu
recorded history, brahmins have been
associated with speech and the sacred
word; they were the scholars, priests, rit-
ual technicians, and protectors of sacred
learning. This is still true in modern
times, although there are also many
brahmins who have other occupa-
tions, such as trade, business, and
government service.
Aside from their traditional associa-
tion with sacred learning, their other
source of social status is their ritual
purity, which is believed to be greater
than that of all other human beings. This
ritual purity is inherent, conferred by
birth. According to tradition, even an
uneducated brahmin should be consid-
ered a “god on earth,” whereas a learned
brahmin is more sacred still. This ritual
purity makes brahmins preferable for
service to many of the gods of the Hindu
pantheon, since they are considered
the best intermediaries to “insulate”
the deities from ordinary people.
Although brahmins as a whole have the
highest status, within the brahmin com-
munity there are highly defined sub-
groups (jatis), which are often defined
by region of origin.
Brahmo Samaj
The earliest of the Hindu reform groups,
founded in Calcutta in the early nine-
teenth century by Ram Mohan Roy
(1774–1833). His purpose was to purge
contemporary Hinduism of its “corrupt”
practices, such as sati (widow burning),
the ban on widow remarriage, image
worship, and caste. In his effort to find a
traditional authority for such reforms,
he chose the Upanishads as his key reli-
gious texts. After his death the move-
ment was eventually headed by
Debendranath Tagore (father of the
Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore)
and later by Keshub Chander Sen; dis-
agreements over ritual matters split the
movement under both leaders. By the
late 1800s the Samaj’s influence had
largely passed, although in an interest-
ing twist, it became the vehicle through
which the mystic Ramakrishna met
many of his disciples.
The Brahmo Samaj’s social program
reflected and responded to contempo-
rary European critiques of popular
Hinduism, some levied by Christian
[[125]]
Braj
missionaries and others based on
the rationalist emphasis of the
Enlightenment. The Brahmo Samaj’s
openness put it at the forefront of legal
reform—in particular, influencing the
[[1829]]
 law banning sati. But at the same
time, its members were mostly
Westernized urban intellectuals, far
removed from the life and religious
concerns of Hindus. For further
information see Spencer Lavan, “The
Brahmo Samaj: India’s First Movement
for Religious Reform,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Braj
Northern Indian region on the Yamuna
River, south of the modern city of Delhi.
According to Hindu tradition, Braj is the
land where the god Krishna lived during
his time on earth. The Braj region does
not have clearly defined boundaries,
and the name has never referred to an
official administrative area. Instead it
has been defined by popular piety.
Krishna’s devotees (bhakta) place great
emphasis on visualizing his exploits as a
way to attain communion with him, and
thus places throughout the Braj region
are associated with very specific inci-
dents in Krishna’s life. As it now stands,
the southern and eastern borders of the
region are just over five miles southeast
of the city of Mathura, and its northern
and western boundaries are nearly five
times that distance. For extensive infor-
mation on Braj and its culture, see A. W.
Entwistle, Braj, 1987.
Braj Bhasha
The “language of Braj”; a dialect of
medieval Hindi primarily spoken in the
Braj region, south of the modern city of
Delhi. Braj is the land associated with
the god Krishna, and the devotion that
flourished there between the fifteenth
and eighteenth centuries made Braj
Bhasha a major literary language. Aside
from being the language of Krishna wor-
shipers, it also functioned as a lingua
franca—a common language used by
[[126]]

diverse peoples—for religious devotees
(bhakta) in a much larger area of northern
India, although it varied at the borders.
Brhadaranyaka (“Great Forest
Book”) Upanishad
By general consensus, the oldest of the
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the most recent stratum
of the Vedas. The Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad’s chronological priority is
supported by at least four pieces of evi-
dence: its length, its lack of organiza-
tion, its archaic language, and its
relationship to earlier Vedic texts. The
opening passage gives an extended
comparison between the world and the
sacrificial horse, showing clear parallels
with the earlier Brahmana literature.
Moreover, by its very name (“great forest
book”), the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad
clearly points to a transition from the
Aranyaka (“forest books”) literature,
which followed Brahmana literature.
This upanishad first addresses many of
the questions raised in later texts and is
therefore an important source for the
development of the tradition. Unlike
most of the later Upanishads, it is writ-
ten in prose rather than poetry, with the
instruction often in the form of dialogue
between various speakers.
Brhadeshvar
Temple built in the southern Indian city
of Tanjore around the year 1000 B.C.E. by
the Chola king Raja Raja (r. 985–1014).
The temple is dedicated to the god Shiva
in his form as Brhadeshvar (the “great
lord”). It was built in the Dravida style
characteristic of southern Indian tem-
ples, in which the buildings are of mod-
est height but cover an immense area
and are surrounded by a boundary wall
with massive towers (gopurams) over
each wall’s central gateway. The
Brhadeshvar temple is famous as a cen-
ter for traditional arts and culture, par-
ticularly as a home for the dance style
known as Bharatanatyam. It also con-
tains some exceptional murals, anBronzes
extremely unusual feature in Indian
temples. See also Chola dynasty.
Brhannala
This was the identity assumed by
Arjuna, one of the five Pandava princes,
during the year they lived incognito
after twelve years of forest exile. The
Pandavas are the heroes of the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, which details the struggle
for power between the Pandavas and
their cousins the Kauravas. At one point
in their struggle, Arjuna’s older brother,
Yudhishthira, has lost all the brothers’
freedom and possessions to the Kauravas
in a game of dice. As a penalty for this
loss, the Pandavas have to go into exile
for twelve years and spend the thirteenth
year back in society, unrecognized. It is
understood that if the brothers are dis-
covered during that year, they will be
banished again. Arjuna, the epic’s most
heroic warrior, disguises himself as a
eunuch named Brhannala, knowing that
no one will suspect him in such guise. He
spends the year living in the women’s
quarters of the palace, singing and danc-
ing as a eunuch. At the end of the year,
still in his eunuch’s garb, Arjuna takes
part in a great battle in which he defeats
the troops of the Kauravas.
This form of marriage is considered
aprashasta (“reprehensible”) because of
the implication of selling one’s children.
Even though it does take place in mod-
ern India, communities practicing this
form have very low social status. In
modern times, giving brideprice is an
admission that the bride’s family
deserves compensation for the loss of a
wage earner, implying that her labor is
necessary for the family. In contrast, the
higher-status type of marriage, the
Brahma marriage, transfers both the
bride and wealth (in the form of a
dowry) to the groom’s family with the
understanding that both families have
enough money that her paid labor
is unnecessary.
Brindavan
In Hindu mythology, Brhaspati is a sage
chosen by the deities (devas) as their
guru, or spiritual teacher. Brhaspati is
also one of the names used to designate
the planet Jupiter, since in Hindu astrol-
ogy this planet is the most significant,
and thus the symbolic “guru” among
the planets.(“tulsi forest”) Small town in the
Mathura district of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, which is the town in which the
god Krishna is supposed to have lived
during his childhood. Although every
place in Brindavan is associated with the
life of Krishna and is full of temples ded-
icated to him, one particularly important
place is the Chir Ghat, at which Krishna
stole the gopis’ clothes as they were
bathing (snana) in the Yamuna River.
(The gopis were female cowherds who
were companions to Krishna during his
youth.) An interesting architectural site
is the Gobind Deo Mandir, built in 1590,
which has a vaulted ceiling. This latter
temple is also notable for its lack of exte-
rior ornamentation, perhaps to avoid
antagonizing the nearby Moghuls. For a
description of the sacred life in
Brindavan, see John Stratton Hawley, At
Play with Krishna, 1981. See also
Moghul dynasty.
BridepriceBronzes
Brhaspati
The money the groom’s family gives to
the bride’s family as a condition for mar-
riage. This exchange of money for the
bride is the defining feature of the asura
marriage, one of eight recognized forms
of marriage in the Dharma Shastras, the
treatises on religious duty (dharma).
For most of Indian history, stone has
been the preferred medium for creating
images of the Hindu deities for worship.
One of the significant exceptions to this
trend can be found in southern India,
primarily under the Chola dynasty
[[127]]
Buddha Avatar
Depiction of the god Vishnu’s Buddha avatar.
Some Hindus claim that the Buddha was
actually an incarnation of Vishnu.
(9th–14th c.), in which another impor-
tant medium was bronze. The images
were made using lost wax casting,
which allows for great detail. They were
cast in bronze with a high copper con-
tent, which tended to give them a green-
ish tinge as the metal oxidized. Some of
the images are only a few inches high,
albeit with exquisite detail, whereas the
largest are over four feet tall and even
today are the primary images worshiped
in temples. These images were subject
to the same established rules of con-
struction (shilpa shastra) as stone
sculptures. Despite this strict form,
many of the bronzes are masterful works
of art with a presence rarely found in the
stone sculptures. Although images were
made of all of the deities in the pan-
theon, among the best known bronzes
are figures of the god Shiva as Nataraja,
“the Lord of the Dance.”
Buddha Avatar
The ninth avatar, or “incarnation,” of
the god Vishnu. As the only attested his-
torical figure (and one who clearly dif-
fered with the Hindu orthodoxy of his
time), the Buddha avatar shows how the
avatar doctrine was used to envelop and
assimilate existing religious figures.
Although this designation as an avatar
was an attempt to appropriate a signifi-
cant religious figure by projecting him as
an incarnation of Vishnu, this attempt’s
[[128]]

transparency can be seen in the differ-
ing opinions over this avatar. In the
opening chapter of his Gitagovinda, the
poet Jayadeva claims that Vishnu incar-
nated as the Buddha to condemn the
animal sacrifices prevalent in Vedic
times. Other accounts portray him as
misleading the wicked by instructing
them to deny the authority of the Vedas
(which the historical Buddha explicitly
denied) and drive themselves into
hell. Despite being named as one of
the avatars, the Buddha was never
worshiped
by
Vaishnavas,
and
Buddhists themselves have certainly
never accepted this assertion.
Buddha Purnima
The full moon in the lunar month of
Baisakh
(April–May).
Buddhists
throughout the world celebrate this full
moon as the anniversary of the Buddha’s
birth, enlightenment, and death.
Although many Hindus respect the
Buddha as a sage and religious teacher,
he is not central to Hindu religion.
Therefore, this is not a major festival,
although this particular full moon is still
named for him. More recently, the day of
this full moon has been described as the
best day of the year for bathing (snana)
in sacred rivers, a practice that the
Buddha
would
certainly
have
denounced. Given the auspiciousness
connected with every full moon, this
may be an effort to “take back” the day
as a Hindu holiday by emphasizing a
distinctively Hindu practice.
Buddhi
This word refers to the mental faculty
often translated as “intellect,” but it car-
ries connotations beyond mere knowl-
edge. The buddhi is the intellectual
capability for awareness, mental per-
ception, and decision-making, and as
such it is the basis for all cognitive
thought. In the account of evolution
found in the Samkhya philosophical
school, buddhi is one stage in the evolu-
tion of the human personality and the
external world. In the Samkhya account,Busti
buddhi is the first faculty to emerge
from prakrti, or “primal matter,” and is
also known by the name mahat (the
“great one”). The mental processes facil-
itated by buddhi spur the development
of the next stage of evolution, ahamkar,
or “subjective consciousness.” In more
colloquial language, buddhi describes
the overall quality of a person’s mind,
whether it is wholesome or unwhole-
some, sound or unsound.
Bull
Although the cow is the Hindu symbol
for motherhood, with all of the
emotional baggage that accompanies it,
the associations connected with bulls are
not nearly so important. In a religious
context, the bull is associated with the
god Shiva because his animal vehicle is
the bull Nandi, who can invariably be
found guarding the door at Shiva’s
temples. In pre-modern times, of course,
adult bulls were a relatively small
percentage of the total cattle population,
since most young bulls were routinely
castrated to become the oxen that were
essential agricultural work animals.
Bundi
City and district in the southeastern part
of the state Rajasthan, about 100 miles
south of the state capital, Jaipur. Before
[[1947]]
, when India gained independence,
Bundi was a small kingdom. In the late
seventeenth century, Bundi became a
center for the Rajasthani style of minia-
ture painting, perhaps by attracting
artists from the Moghul court who were
seeking outside patronage. Aside from
the portraits and court groups character-
izing this genre under the Moghuls,
Rajasthani miniature painters portrayed
Hindu religious themes, particularly inci-
dents in the life of the god Krishna.
Whereas some styles have flat, mono-
chromatic backgrounds, the Bundi style
shows an intense focus on nature, such
as detailed depiction of the trees (usually
banana trees) surrounding the subjects,
in addition to flowers, birds, and lotus-
filled ponds. For further information see
W. G. Archer, Indian Painting, 1957; or his
Indian Painting in Bundi and Kotah,
[[1959]]
. See also Moghul dynasty.
Burial
Although cremation is the most com-
mon means by which Hindus dispose of
corpses, occasionally bodies are buried.
One such case is with the bodies of very
young children, as if it is recognized that
they never developed into real individu-
als. The only other people usually buried
are ascetics, for which there are varying
interpretations. One idea is that they are
not actually dead but in a state of deep
meditation (samadhi). In such cases the
ascetic is often buried in a sitting posture
because he is considered still present.
Another reason for burying ascetics may
reflect the general assumption that
renouncing the world had made them
“dead” to it, making further ceremonies
unnecessary. Indeed, one part of some
ascetic initiations is to perform one’s
own funeral rites. Burial is often reserved
for ascetics with disciples who will keep
their graves as shrines. Those who are not
buried are usually weighted down with
rocks and thrown into bodies of water.
Busti
(“settlement”) In its literal meaning, any-
where people live—a settlement, village,
or community. In modern usage it has
come to denote an illegal settlement,
such as one built by squatters who have
put up dwellings on vacant land using
whatever materials are available, from
brick to cardboard to plastic. At first, such
settlements have no civic amenities such
as water, power, roads, or sewers, and in
most cases the living conditions are
abysmal. In many cases such “slums”
become people’s hereditary homes, par-
ticularly in Bombay, where real estate is
exorbitantly expensive. These residents
have usually gained access to electricity
and water, typically via illegal hookups.
In rarer cases squatters have gained title
to the land through exerting political
pressure, after which conditions have
generally improved.
[[129]]
Calendar
## C
Calendar
One of the most fundamental Hindu
religious beliefs is that different times
carry different qualities. Whereas some
times are considered more auspicious
and propitious, others are more inauspi-
cious and dangerous. These judgments
may either describe the general qualities
of specific times or determine the prop-
er time for carrying out particular activ-
ities. Thus Hindus have given
considerable attention to organizing
time and predicting auspicious
moments. Many modern Hindus simul-
taneously use several different calen-
dars, although they may use them for
different purposes. To begin with, every-
day timekeeping is done with the
Gregorian calendar of the common era,
which may reflect the influence of the
British empire or, more simply, the influ-
ence of modern commerce and commu-
nications. It is notable that the only
holidays celebrated according to this
calendar are national holidays such as
Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti,
and Republic Day—all of which are
fixed on particular days. Beyond this
there are many other methods of mea-
suring time, some of which overlap with
each other and some of which are found
only in certain regions of the country.
Several of these systems are based on
the movement of the sun. The most
basic unit, of course, is the solar day,
which traditionally begins and ends not
by the clock but by the rising of the sun.
The week contains seven solar days. The
movement of the sun divides the year
into halves, with the uttarayana period
occurring when the sun is moving
northward and the dakshinayana period
taking place when the sun is moving
[[130]]

southward. There are also two separate
versions of the solar year, each of which
has twelve solar months. In northern
India these months correspond to the
twelve signs of the zodiac and mark the
sun’s passage through them. In southern
India one finds an identical calendar,
the Tamil solar year, in which the names
of the months are drawn from the
names of certain nakshatras, or signs of
the lunar zodiac.
Whereas the solar calendar is usually
used for astrological purposes, the lunar
calendar is important for religious life.
The lunar calendar is used to measure
the two eras still used for dating history:
the Vikram era (fifty-six or fifty-seven
years later than the common era) and
the Shaka era (seventy-eight years earlier
than the common era). The lunar year is
made up of twelve lunar months, each
of which has thirty lunar days. Since the
cycle of the moon is only about twenty-
eight solar days, a lunar day is slightly
shorter than a solar day. The lunar
month is divided into two halves of fif-
teen days each: the “dark” (krishna pak-
sha) half, when the moon is waning and
that ends with the new moon; and the
“light” (shukla paksha) half when the
moon is waxing and that culminates in
the full moon. In northern India the
lunar month begins with the moon’s
dark half, and ends on the full moon,
whereas in the south the reverse is often
true. Since the solar year has about 365
days and the lunar year about 354, if left
uncorrected each lunar year would
begin eleven solar days earlier than the
previous one. To correct this discrepancy,
an intercalary month is added about
every two and a half years. This helps to
keep the lunar months falling at around
the same time every year, although the
celebration of a particular festival can
vary by several weeks from one year to
the next.
Almost all Hindu festivals are
celebrated according to the lunar
calendar. Some festivals’ celebrations
are associated with certain lunar days
and thus occur twenty-four times in a
twelve-month lunar year: The eleventhCaste
day (ekadashi) of each half of the lunar
month is sacred to the god Vishnu; the
eighth day (ashtami) is devoted to the
Goddess, particularly in her form as
Durga; the evening of the thirteenth day
(trayodashi) and the fourteenth day
(chaturdashi) are sacred to the god
Shiva; and the fourth day (chaturthi) is
dedicated to the god Ganesh. The time
for celebrating annual religious festivals
is set according to the lunar month, the
half of the moon, and the particular
lunar day. For example, the god
Krishna’s birthday is celebrated on
Bhadrapada Krishna eight, the eighth
day of the dark (waning) half of the lunar
month of Bhadrapada. The birthdays of
many important historical religious fig-
ures such as Guru Nanak, the founder of
the Sikh community; the Buddha, and
the devotional poet-saints are also cele-
brated according to the lunar calendar.
These overlapping calendars mean
that any particular day can be designat-
ed by several different markers: the day
of the week and the day in the common
era (as in many societies), the day
according to the traditional solar calen-
dar, and the day according to the lunar
calendar. Depending on the context—
business, astrological, or festival—any
one of these may be given preference.
See also auspiciousness, inauspicious-
ness, and Tamil months.
Campantar
Tamil form of the name for the poet-
saint Sambandar. See Sambandar.
Caste
The best-known term to denote the tra-
ditional Hindu social structure in which
groups are arranged in a hierarchy of
status, usually based on the perceived
purity of each group’s traditional occu-
pation. The word “caste” is actually
derived from the Portuguese word for
“chaste.” The Portuguese observed that
different groups in Indian society kept
themselves separate from each other, par-
ticularly when eating and in marriage.
They used the term “caste” to describe
this social phenomenon.
Among Hindus themselves the most
important concept for social ordering is
known as the jati (“birth”). One
becomes a member of a jati by being
born into it. The jatis were usually divided
according to traditional occupation,
which (in theory) would be performed
by that jati alone. A jati’s social status
generally stemmed from the status of its
occupation, and jatis such as latrine
cleaners and tanners were thought to be
defiled by their trade. Society as a whole
was conceived on the model of the body,
with the different jatis comparable to
different body parts. While each part
had a differing status and role, every one
was necessary for the whole to function
smoothly. These differences in status
were marked and reinforced by strict
rules to keep each group distinct from
the others. The strictest regulations were
in regard to marriage, and in earlier
times members of a jati would marry
only within that group. It was almost as
if the jatis were seen as separate
“species” of human beings that had to
be kept apart. Marrying within one’s jati
is still the ideal, although there is now
considerably more intermarriage than
in the past.
The best-known model for ordering
Indian society is that of the four major
social groups (varna) described in the
dharma literature: brahmin (priest),
kshatriya (warrior-king), vaishya (mer-
chant), and shudra (servant). However,
the number of different jati groups
makes the social hierarchy far more
complex. A small village might have
dozens of jatis, all performing certain
tasks, whereas a city might have hun-
dreds of jatis, some highly specialized.
Even within the brahmin varna, there
are different brahmin jatis (for example,
Saraswat, Chitpavan, Kanyakubja, and
Kanaujia). For other varnas the picture
is even more complex. For instance,
some jati groups fall between the
vaishya and shudra varnas, and jati
groups of humble status who have
achieved political success may claim
[[131]]
Castration
kshatriya lineage. The same jati’s social
position can vary from region to region,
depending on if they comprise a major-
ity or a minority of the population or
have status as a land-holding community.
As in most of Hindu life, a group’s status
is usually influenced by local factors; in
the past fifty years, such status determi-
nations have also been affected by
changes in Indian society, which have
tended to relax social distinctions. For
further information see McKim Marriot,
“Hindu Transactions: Diversity Without
Dualism,” in Bruce Kapferer (ed.),
Transaction and Meaning, 1976.
Castration
Castration of human beings has been
almost completely absent in Indian his-
tory, with the notable exception of the
hijras. Hijras are male cross-dressers
who dress and behave as women and
have usually undergone self-castration
as a ritual renunciation of their sexuality.
Hijras are often homosexual prostitutes,
and they are an established part of the
decadent underside of most Indian
cities. Their most important ritual func-
tion is to sing and dance at the houses in
which a male child has been born, but
they may also be called to perform on
other auspicious occasions. Despite the
hijras’ associations with certain auspi-
cious occasions, they are marginal to
society and have very low social status.
For a reliable study of the hijras, see
Serena Nanda, Neither Man Nor Woman,
[[1999]]
. See also auspiciousness.
Causal Chains
The underlying ultimate concern in all
Indian philosophical schools is to
uncover and understand the causal
forces that keep human beings
enmeshed in samsara, the continual
cycle of reincarnation. One of the ways
that Indian philosophers attempted to
do this was to formulate various chains
of cause and effect detailing the process
through which human beings become
subject to the bondage of karma. By
[[132]]

understanding this process, they hope
to be able to manipulate it, ultimately
leading to the final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The oldest causal chains were
formulated by the Buddha and the Jains.
In each of these theories, avidya, or lack
of genuine understanding, starts the
causal chain. In the Buddhist and Jain
traditions, these causal chains can be
broken by a religious discipline that
begins with moral action and at more
advanced levels involves meditation
and wisdom.
Causal chains in Hindu philosophy
have much in common with these
beliefs, particularly the notion that
avidya is the basic problem. In the
Nyaya Sutras, the Nyaya philosopher
Gautama propounded a five-fold causal
chain: pain, birth, activity, defect, and
wrong notion. Each of these elements
is caused by the one succeeding it
and is eliminated with the destruction
of its cause. The Vaisheshika school,
which was traditionally paired with
the Nyayas, also used this model. The
causal chain in the Samkhya philosoph-
ical school, as described by its founder,
Ishvarakrishna, ascribes bondage to
the process of evolution, stemming
from the confusion between purusha
(conscious spirit) and prakrti (primal
matter). According to Samkhya,
these two first principles are always
separate from one another, but humans
can confuse them. The Yoga school,
traditionally paired with the Samkhya,
used this model as well. The philosopher
Ramanuja, founder of the Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta school, proposes an evolution-
ary scheme similar to the Samkhya
model, although instead of Samkhya’s
dualism, all things evolve from a single
source, Brahman.
The only major Hindu philosophical
school without a causal chain is Advaita
Vedanta. All of the other schools explain
the relationship between the Ultimate
Reality (in most cases, Brahman) and
the perceivable world with the doctrine
of parinamavada. This philosophical
perspective accepts the reality of the
world as it is perceived and also assumesCauvery
that the changes in the material world
involve the genuine transformation
(parinama) of one thing into another,
which can be explained by cause and
effect. The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,
which are merely differing forms of that
reality. For the Advaitins, this single real-
ity is the formless, unqualified
Brahman. Advaitins explain the appear-
ance of difference and diversity in the
everyday world as an illusory rather
than a genuine transformation of
Brahman, a philosophical outlook
known as vivartavada. This illusory
transformation is caused by a quality of
the human mind, which leads to the
mental superimposition (adhyasa) of a
mistaken understanding in place of the
real one. For the Advaitins, as for all of
the other schools, the ultimate problem
is still avidya, or mistaken understand-
ing, which must be replaced by correct
understanding. Whereas all of the other
schools give some importance to
actions, the Advaitins believe that avidya
is the sole cause and its removal the sole
solution. For further information see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Causal Models
In Indian philosophy, there are three
different models describing the relation-
ships between cause and effect:
satkaryavada, asatkaryavada, and
anekantavada. The first model,
satkaryavada, assumes that effects pre-
exist in their causes. Effects are thus
transformations (real or apparent) of
these causes. The classic example is the
transformation of milk to curds, butter,
and clarified butter. According to
satkaryavada’s proponents, each of
these effects was already present in the
cause and emerges from it through a
natural transformation of that cause.
The second model, asatkaryavada,
assumes that effects do not preexist
in their causes—they are completely
distinct. In the classic examples for this
model, one creates a clay pot by putting
together the two halves of the pot, or
one weaves a cloth from strands of
thread. According to asatkaryavada’s
proponents, with each of these acts, cer-
tain material and instrumental causes
create an entirely new object.
The third model, anekantavada (“the
view that things are not single”), seeks to
occupy the middle ground between the
other two models. Anekantavada stresses
the importance of one’s perspective and
the way it can color a judgment. In view-
ing the transformation of milk to curds,
butter, and clarified butter, an anekan-
tavada proponent would claim that
these substances were contained in the
causes (supporting the satkaryavada
notion) but that the qualities of these
substances were newly created each
time (supporting the asatkaryavada
notion). Thus causes and effects are
simultaneously both the same and dif-
ferent, depending on the way one looks
at them.
All of these philosophical schools
believe that if one understands the
causal process correctly and can manip-
ulate it through one’s conscious actions,
it is possible to gain final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Each of these causal
models thus has profound implications
on religious life. Satkaryavada believes
that causal relations are strong, but they
may be so strong that humans cannot
affect the causal chain; the asatkaryavada
believes that causal relations are weak,
with the danger that human action is
too unreliable to bring about a desired
effect; anekantavada purports to find a
middle ground but can be construed as
inconsistent or self-contradictory. For
further information see Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Cauvery
Southern Indian river rising at the base
of the western ghats in the state of
Karnataka, then flowing east through
the state of Tamil Nadu before entering
[[133]]
Caves, Artificial
The Kailasanatha Temple in the state of Maharashtra is surrounded by artificial caves sculpted into solid rock.
the Bay of Bengal. It is traditionally
considered one of India’s seven sacred
rivers along with the Ganges, Godavari,
Indus, Narmada, Saraswati, and Yamuna.
Important sacred sites (tirthas) on the
Cauvery include Shrirangapatnam
and Tiruchirappalli as well as the
Cauvery Delta in Tamil Nadu’s Tanjore
district, which is filled with temple
towns. Since 1947, when India gained
independence, the rights to the
Cauvery’s water have become a major
dispute between Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka. Farmers in Tamil Nadu have
been demanding a more significant
share of the waters impounded in reser-
voirs in Karnataka.
Caves, Artificial
This was a common architectural form
in the western part of the state of
Maharashtra, particularly in the early
centuries of the common era. The earli-
est form was the chaitya or rock-cut
cave temple, which is specifically associ-
ated with Buddhist architectural sites. A
chaitya typically had a large chamber
sculpted into the side of a hill, usually
[[134]]

with a Buddha image at the far end and
a window above the entrance to admit
more light. These caves were excavated
and sculpted from the top down so that
no scaffolding was necessary. The sides
and central pillars were carved to mimic
wooden construction. Early Hindu
architecture adapted the chaitya form
but eventually moved beyond it to con-
struct free-standing temples. The most
impressive Hindu rock-cut temples are
the caves at Ellora, particularly the
Kailasanatha temple (late 8th c.), dedi-
cated to the god Shiva in his form as the
Lord of Mount Kailas. The Kailasanatha
temple was sculpted out of solid rock
but carved to look as if it were built of
masonry. This temple marked the
height of the artificial cave as an archi-
tectural type, although the temples at
Elephanta were done later. After this
period, the emphasis tended to be on
free-standing temples.
Cekkilar
(12th c. C.E.) Author of the Periya
Puranam, a hagiographical account of
the sixty-three Nayanars. The NayanarsChaitanya
were a group of sixty-three Shaiva poet-
saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and ninth cen-
turies. Along with their Vaishnava coun-
terparts, the Alvars, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu
religion in opposition to the Buddhists
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the
Alvars stressed passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god—Shiva for
the Nayanars, Vishnu for the Alvars—
and conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
According to tradition, Cekkilar was a
minister at the court of the Chola
dynasty’s
king
Kullottunga
II
(r. 1130–1150 C.E.). Cekkilar was dis-
tressed by the king’s admiration for a
Jain epic poem and composed his own
text to distract the king. His text portrays
the Nayanars as models of devotion to
Shiva, although they are sometimes
extreme in their actions. Yet in every
case, the love between devotee (bhakta)
and deity manifests itself in the circum-
stances of everyday life, leading the
saints to final liberation.
Celibacy
In traditional Indian culture, celibacy
was widely seen not only as a sign of
sanctity but also as a source of power.
On one hand, since sexual desire is often
the symbol for all types of desire, renun-
ciation of sexual activity is thus a sign for
the renunciation of the world in general.
On a more literal level, retention of
semen through celibacy is believed to
prevent the loss of a man’s vital energy.
In traditional Indian physiology, semen
is believed to be distilled from blood
and is therefore the concentrated
essence of a man’s vitality. Although
semen can and must be expended for
procreation, all other losses should be
carefully weighed. Thus there are strong
taboos on masturbation. This vital energy,
stored and conserved through celibacy,
can then be used for spiritual advance-
ment. The paradigm for the celibate
ascetic is the god Shiva, one of whose
symbols is the linga, a pillar-shaped
image with clear phallic associations.
Shiva is the model husband and the
consummate ascetic. The linga repre-
sents his stored celibate energy, as the
product of his tapas (ascetic practices).
In the same way, celibacy is a way for
human men to conserve their vital ener-
gies, whether one is a lifetime celibate
(naisthika), a student (brahmacharin),
or—as in many cases—a married man
who has already had children.
Chaitanya
(1486–1533 C.E.) Bengali saint, devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna, and the
founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava reli-
gious community. Chaitanya was such a
pivotal figure that there are many tradi-
tional sources for his life, although their
hagiographic character makes them his-
torically unreliable. According to one of
these traditions, Chaitanya embodied
Krishna himself. Krishna became
Chaitanya to experience the longing of
Radha, his beloved consort whom
Chaitanya imagined himself to be. Thus,
for his followers Chaitanya was con-
ceived as Krishna and Radha in the
same body.
Chaitanya was born in the town of
Navadvip in the state of West Bengal
and given the name Vishvambar.
Traditional sources portray the young
man as a gifted teacher but with no
inclination toward Krishna. In 1508 he
went to Gaya, a sacred site (tirtha) asso-
ciated with rites for the dead, to perform
rites for his dead father. In Gaya,
Vishvambar met his teacher, Ishvara
Puri, and something profound hap-
pened there, for he returned to
Navadvip a passionate devotee of
Krishna. On his return, Vishvambar
began to hold the public kirtan (devo-
tional chanting) that has become the
hallmark of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
school. Devotees sang and danced in the
streets and wept uncontrollably.
Through this ecstatic emotional wor-
ship, they sought to regain the devotional
atmosphere associated with the gopis,
Krishna’s cowherd women, and thus
[[135]]
Chaitanya-Charitramrta
share in the gopis’ intimate relationship
with Krishna.
In 1510 Vishvambar formally became
an ascetic, taking the name Krishna
Chaitanya, and for the rest of his life
propagated the worship of Krishna. For
much of that time, he resided in the
sacred city of Puri. This was reportedly
in deference to his mother, since she felt
that Krishna’s childhood home,
Brindavan, was too far away. Despite his
mother’s wishes, Chaitanya did take sev-
eral lengthy trips: a two-year tour of the
holy places in southern India between
[[1510]]
 and 1512, and in 1514, a trip to
Brindavan, in which Chaitanya had fre-
quent mystical experiences. After his
return to Puri, he met the brothers Rupa
and Sanatana Goswami. Chaitanya
directed them to settle in Brindavan and
re-establish the holy sites associated
with Krishna’s life. Driven by Chaitanya’s
charisma and ecstatic devotion, Rupa,
Sanatana, and their nephew Jiva
Goswami became pivotal figures in the
development of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
school. While Chaitanya was absorbed
in his devotion to Krishna until his
death, Rupa, Santana, and Jiva Goswami
gave this devotion a systematic organi-
zation. For further information see
Sushil Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal,
[[1961]]
;
and
Janardana
Chakravarti, Bengal Vaishnavism and Sri
Chaitanya, 1975.
Chaitanya-Charitramrta
(“nectar of Chaitanya’s deeds”) A name
shared by at least three separate texts, all
devoted to recounting the life of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533).
The earliest was written by Murari
Gupta, an associate of Chaitanya. Most
of this text focuses on Chaitanya’s early
life up to his southern Indian pilgrimage
ending in 1513, but it also briefly men-
tions his pilgrimage to the town of
Brindavan in 1514 and his final return
to the sacred city of Puri, in which he
lived until his death. The second
account was written nine years after
[[136]]

Chaitanya’s death by Kavikarnapura,
who freely acknowledged his debt to
Murari Gupta. The final account was
written by Krishnadas Kaviraj about
ninety years after Chaitanya’s death.
Kaviraj’s account focuses mainly on
Chaitanya’s later life, particularly his
time in Brindavan. This last version is
marked by the philosophical influ-
ence of Chaitanya’s most important
disciples, the Goswamis (Rupa Goswami,
Sanatana Goswami, and Jiva Goswami),
whose ideas were a major influence
in shaping the Gaudiya Vaishnava
religious community. None of these
texts gives an “objective” biography;
the works are hagiographies written
by passionate devotees (bhakta). See
also philosophy.
Chaitra
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Chaitra is the month in
which the lunar year both begins (dur-
ing the two weeks of the bright or wax-
ing, half of the moon) and ends (during
the two weeks of the dark, or waning,
half of the moon, which precedes the
bright half). Thus, the waning half of
Chaitra ends one lunar year, while the
waxing half that follows it begins the
next lunar year. This month usually falls
within March and April. This is one of
the months of spring, and in northern
India the weather is warm and pleasant
at this time. The major festivals in
Chaitra are Papamochani Ekadashi, the
spring Navaratri, Ram Navami,
Kamada Ekadashi, Hanuman Jayanti,
and in Tamil Nadu, the Chittirai festival.
Chaitya
(“place of worship”) A rock-cut cave
temple. This architectural form is closely
associated with Indian Buddhism but
was also used in early Hindu temple
architecture. The earliest chaityas were
simple caves, but these grew more elab-
orate as the form developed. In its later
stages, the builders would not only cutChakra
out the side of the hill to make a cave;
they would also sculpt pillars and
other architectural details that
mimicked free-standing construction.
Another characteristic architectural
feature was a ceiling carved into the
shape of an arch. The true arch, built
from the bottom up and used in
Roman architecture, was not used in
ancient India. A third common feature
was a large window opening over the
doorway to let in additional light.
During the construction, the builders
began removing stone at the top of the
structure and worked their way down;
this eliminated the need for any scaf-
folding during the building process,
but it also meant that the builders had
to work carefully to avoid mistakes.
This construction method creates
structures considered gigantic sculp-
tures rather than buildings. The earliest
examples are Buddhist caves carved
into the side of the western ghats in
Maharashtra. The form was later used
to create Hindu temples, specifically
at Ellora (in which the oldest caves
are Buddhist) and on the island
of Elephanta.
Chakora
The red partridge (Perdrix rufa).
According to popular belief, the chakora
bird eats nothing but moonbeams. It is
thus happy and content during the
night but tormented by hunger during
the day. In court poetry the chakora bird
often symbolized a cultured and dis-
criminating person who appreciates the
finer things in life. In bhakti (devotion-
al) poetry the chakora is often a symbol
for a devotee (bhakta), since the chakora
bird is said to be in love with the moon.
Thus it is joyful when the moon is out
but pines for it during the day, just as a
devotee is blissful in the deity’s pres-
ence and in its absence is consumed
with longing.
Chakra
(“wheel”) In Hindu iconography the
chakra is the discus-weapon carried by
several of the Hindu deities. It is often
associated with the god Vishnu and is
one of the four objects he invariably
carries, along with the club (gada), lotus
(padma), and conch shell (shankha).
The discus was an actual weapon in the
Indian military arsenal, and its sharp
edges made it fearsome in close com-
bat. Vishnu’s discus (named Sudarshana)
is even more fearsome in its power.
According to tradition it was fashioned
by the divine craftsman, Vishvakarma,
from pieces trimmed off of the sun;
thus it carries the power of the sun’s
blazing energy. The discus is also carried
by certain powerful forms of the
Goddess. In her charter myth, she was
formed from the collected radiance of
all the gods and received duplicates of
all their weapons.
In the esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, a chakra is a psychic
center in the subtle body. The subtle
body is an alternate physiological sys-
tem that corresponds to the material
body but is believed to reside on a dif-
ferent plane of existence. The subtle
body is visualized as a set of chakras,
or psychic centers, that are arranged
in a column from the base of the spine
to the top of the head and connected
by three vertical channels. Each
chakra is pictured as a multipetaled
lotus flower. All tantric traditions
speak of six chakras: muladhara, svad-
hishthana, manipura, anahata, vishud-
dha, and ajna; some traditions name
additional ones. Each of these chakras
has important symbolic associations—
with a different human physiological
capacity, subtle element (tanmatra),
and with differing seed syllables (bijak-
shara) formed from the letters of the
Sanskrit alphabet, together encompass-
ing all sacred sounds. For further infor-
mation see Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973.
[[137]]
Chakravyuha
A shoemaker in Agra. Shoemaking and leather tanning are traditional occupations of the Chamar social group.
Chakravyuha
(“circular phalanx”) A circular military
formation described in the Mahabharata,
one of the two great Hindu epics (along
with the Ramayana). The Chakravyuha
was widely believed to be unconquer-
able because each person in the forma-
tion was protected by those behind
him. During a battle in the Mahabharata
war, Abhimanyu becomes trapped in
the chakravyuha by his enemy. Because
his father, Arjuna, is the only person
who knows how to get out, Abhimanyu
is killed.
Chalukya Dynasty
(7th–8th c. C.E.) Central Indian dynasty
whose capital was at Badami, in
the Deccan plateau in modern
Karnataka. The greatest Chalukya ruler
was Pulakeshin II, who defeated the
northern Indian emperor Harsha, stop-
ping his southern advance. He also
killed the Pallava dynasty ruler
Mahendravarman, setting off a series of
wars between the Chalukyas and the
Pallavas in which each dynasty was able
to defeat the other in battle, but neither
was strong enough to retain control of
the other’s empire. Aside from the
[[138]]

Chalukya dynasty based at Badami,
there were two other smaller dynasties
by the same name, both of which flour-
ished between the tenth and thirteenth
centuries. One of these later dynasties
was in the Gujarat region, and the other
was in the Karnataka region.
Chamar
In traditional northern Indian society,
the chamars were a jati (“birth”) whose
hereditary occupation was tanning
leather and making shoes. The jatis
were subgroups of traditional Indian
society whose social status was deter-
mined by their hereditary occupation.
The chamars were traditionally consid-
ered among the lowest of the untouch-
ables since their work brought them in
continual contact with dead animals
and their skins, which are considered
extremely impure. The most famous
chamar is the poet-saint Ravidas, whose
poetry focuses on the difference
between worldly status and devotion.
Champaran
Region in the northern part of the state
of Bihar, between the Gandaki RiverChanda
and the border of Nepal. Now it is com-
posed of two provinces, eastern
Champaran and western Champaran.
The Champaran region is famous as the
place where Mohandas K. Gandhi engi-
neered the first successful satyagraha
(nonviolent resistance campaign)
against British rule. At the time, the
province was largely agricultural, as it
remains today, and most of the inhabi-
tants were very poor. The farmers had
traditionally designated a portion of
their land for growing indigo to give to
the landlords as rent. This arrangement
was disrupted by the invention of a
much cheaper synthetic indigo. The
landlords responded by ordering the
tenants to stop growing indigo but pro-
ceeded to raise the rent on their land,
based on the traditional agreement that
allowed them to do so if a tenant grew
no indigo. The trouble began in 1912,
but Gandhi did not arrive until 1917.
After a campaign lasting nearly a year,
the tenants won concessions from the
landlords guaranteeing no further rent
increases and a 25 percent rebate on the
previous increases. For further informa-
tion see Mohandas K. Gandhi, An
Autobiography, 1993; a more readable,
though highly partial, account can be
found in Louis Fischer, Gandhi, 1954.
Chamunda
Presiding deity of the Chamunda Devi
shrine on the banks of the Bana Ganga
in the state of Himachal Pradesh, and
one of the nine goddesses whose shrines
are scattered through the Shiwalik Hills.
Although each of these goddesses has a
separate identity, they are all ultimately
seen as differing manifestations of a sin-
gle Goddess. Chamunda’s charter myth
is drawn from events in the
Devimahatmya, a Sanskrit text that
describes the Goddess’s several different
forms and is the earliest and most
important mythic source for the cult of
the Goddess. The Devimahatmya’s sev-
enth book tells how the goddess
Ambika’s anger takes material form as
the terrifying goddess Kali, who
advances into battle against the demon
generals Chanda and Munda, whom
she eventually beheads. Since the shrine
on the Bana Ganga marks the place
where both Chanda and Munda were
destroyed, the goddess is worshiped
here as Chamunda.
The name Chamunda designates a
fierce and dangerous goddess who has
often been identified with the goddess
Kali. In the poet Bhavabhuti’s eighth-
century drama Malatimadhava , the
heroine, Malati, is kidnapped by devo-
tees (bhakta) of the goddess Chamunda
to be offered as a human sacrifice to
her. The events in the drama reflect the
ambivalence with which such powerful
goddesses—and their devotees—have
been seen. For further information see
David R. Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986;
and Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993.
Chanakya
According to tradition, the chief minis-
ter of the founder of the Maurya
dynasty,
Chandragupta
Maurya
(r. 321–297 B.C.E.). As the king’s counsel,
Chanakya became famous for his skill
in statecraft, and is believed to have
been instrumental in establishing the
dynasty. Under the name Kautilya,
Chanakya is also celebrated as
the author of the Arthashastra , the
classic Indian treatise on the strategies
and mechanics of ruthlessly efficient
central government.
Chanda
A demon general killed by the Goddess
in the Devimahatmya, the Sanskrit text
that is the earliest and most important
mythic source for the cult of the
Goddess. This text describes the
Goddess in several different manifesta-
tions. The seventh book tells how the
goddess Ambika’s anger takes form as
the terrifying goddess Kali. Kali attacks
the demon armies commanded by
Chanda and his companion Munda,
and after destroying the armies she
[[139]]
Chandas
beheads the two generals. As a memorial
of this mythic deed, one of the names
under which the Goddess is worshiped
is Chamunda, as the slayer of Chanda
and Munda.
Chandas
One of the six Vedangas. These were the
auxiliary branches of knowledge intended
to facilitate the use of the Vedas, the
oldest Hindu religious texts. Chandas
was concerned with the study of metri-
cal forms and verse, which were central
to the composition of the Vedas. One
indication of the importance of meter is
that in many sources (such as in Panini’s
grammar, the Ashtadhyayi) the word
chandas is used to designate the Vedas
themselves. Aside from chandas, the
other Vedangas are shiksha (correct pro-
nunciation), vyakarana (Sanskrit gram-
mar), kalpa (ritual instructions),
nirukta (etymology), and jyotisha (aus-
picious times for sacrifices).
Chandella Dynasty
(10th–14th c. C.E.) Northern Indian
dynasty that in its heyday controlled
much of the Ganges River valley and
northern Madhya Pradesh. The
Chandellas are famous for the magnifi-
cent temples that they built in the village
of Khajuraho, largely between the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. These
temples have survived to the present,
perhaps due to their remote and inac-
cessible location. They are excellent
examples of the developed form of the
Nagara architectural style and are
world-famous for their astounding dis-
play of erotic sculptures.
Chandi
(“fierce”) Epithet used for the fierce and
powerful goddesses Durga and Kali. A
variant form of the name Chandi is
Chandika, and under this name Chandi
is identified as one of the Navadurgas,
the “nine [forms of the goddess] Durga”
worshiped during the nine nights of the
Navaratri festival. Chandika is the goddess
[[140]]

worshiped on the festival’s ninth and
final night and is thus the most powerful
of these divine forms.
Chandidas
(15th c. C.E.) Bengali poet and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna. In his
poems Chandidas uses the conventions
of Sanskrit love poetry to express devo-
tion to Krishna, most often through the
figure of Radha as Krishna’s favored
devotee and lover. His poems are still
recited in Bengal and according to tradi-
tion were admired by Chaitanya, the
Bengali devotee who was the founder of
the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious com-
munity. Despite his poetry’s continuing
acclaim, little is known about the life of
Chandidas himself. This same name was
used by a Bengali poet of the Sahajiya
sect, who wrote several centuries later
than the original Chandidas and whose
poetry is clearly distinguished by doctri-
nal differences. For selections from the
poetry of Chandidas, see Edward C.
Dimock Jr. and Denise Levertov (trans.),
In Praise of Krishna, 1981.
Chandika
A variant of the name Chandi, which
designates a powerful and terrifying
form of the Goddess. Chandika is one of
the Navadurgas, the “nine [forms of the
goddess] Durga” worshiped during the
nine nights of the Navaratri festival.
Chandika is the goddess worshiped
on the festival’s ninth and final night
and is thus the most powerful of these
divine forms.
Chandiprakasha
(“effulgence of Chandi”) Name given to
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of
the Atala akhara, a particular group
within the Naga class of Dashanami
Sanyasis. The Dashanami Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into different akharas, or reg-
iments, on the model of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the Nagas’ primary occupation was asChandragupta Maurya
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests. These
functions have largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have certain symbols that signify
their organizational identity, and the
Atala akhara is represented by this
particular spear.
Chandogya Upanishad
Along with the Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad, one of the two earliest
upanishads, the religious texts that form
the most recent stratum of the Vedas.
Internal textual factors indicate that
the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is the
older of the two, and since large sections
of both texts are the same, the
Chandogya Upanishad is thought to
be dependent on the Brhadaranyaka.
Both texts are also much larger than the
other upanishads and much less
organized, rambling from topic to topic
without an apparent focus. Both
are written in prose rather than poetry,
with the text itself often presented as
a dialogue between various speakers.
Their profoundly speculative discus-
sions about the nature of the
universe became important sources for
the later upanishads.
Chandra Gupta I
(r. 320–35 C.E.) Founder of the Gupta
dynasty, which like the Maurya dynasty
had its capital in Pataliputra, identified
with the modern city of Patna in the
state of Bihar. The Gupta capital was
later moved to Allahabad. At the height
of the dynasty, under Chandra Gupta II
(r. 376–415), the Guptas controlled all of
northern India and modern Pakistan, as
well as the Coromandel Coast all the
way to modern Madras. The Gupta
dynasty flourished between about 350
and 550 C.E., and its reign is associated
with the development of Indian culture
and a revival of Hinduism in northern
India. Both were accomplished through

culture and ardent devotees (bhakta)
of Shiva.
Chandra Gupta II
(r. 376–415 C.E.) Third in the line of great
monarchs in the Gupta dynasty, after
his father, Samudra Gupta, and his
grandfather, Chandra Gupta I. The
Gupta dynasty reached its territorial
peak under Chandra Gupta II. During
his reign the Shaka kingdom of the
Malwa region was finally conquered,
after which the Guptas controlled by
conquest or tribute all of northern India
and modern Pakistan, as well as the
Coromandel Coast all the way to mod-
ern Madras. The Gupta dynasty flour-
ished between about 350 and 550 C.E.,
and its reign is associated with the
development of Indian culture and a
revival of Hinduism in northern India.
Both were accomplished through the
patronage of the Gupta kings, who are
remembered both as patrons of high
culture and ardent devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. This is especially true of Chandra
Gupta II, since one of the major figures
associated with his court is Kalidasa,
considered the greatest of the Sanskrit
poets. See also Shaka era.
Chandragupta Maurya
(r. 321–297 B.C.E.) The founder of the
Maurya
dynasty.
The
young
Chandragupta began his empire by
[[141]]
Chandramati
overthrowing the last member of the
Nanda dynasty and occupying the capi-
tal in Pataliputra, identified with the
modern city of Patna in the state of
Bihar. From there he took control of the
Ganges River basin, moved south into
the region of the Narmada River, and
then turned his attention to northwest-
ern India, taking advantage of the power
vacuum left by the recent incursion of
Alexander the Great. In 303 B.C.E. he
defeated Alexander’s general Seleucus
Nicator in battle, then agreed to a treaty
in which he received large parts of mod-
ern Afghanistan. Despite the battle, rela-
tions seem to have been friendly
between the two, for Seleucus Nicator
sent an ambassador to Pataliputra,
Megasthenes, who lived there for many
years. Chandragupta was reportedly
advised by a brilliant brahmin minister,
variously called Kautilya or Chanakya,
who is considered the author of the
Arthashastra . According to legend,
Chandragupta renounced his throne to
become a Jain monk and eventually died
through ritual starvation.
Chandramati
In Hindu mythology, the long-suffering
wife of King Harishchandra. Harish-
chandra is famous for his truthfulness
and integrity; in modern Hindu culture
he is also the paradigm for a person
who patiently endures undeserved suf-
fering. Harishchandra’s suffering grows
out of the competition between the
sages Vasishtha and Vishvamitra. As his
family priest, Vasishtha praises Harish-
chandra’s virtue. Vishvamitra is deter-
mined to prove Vasishtha wrong and
subjects Harishchandra to a series of
trials in which he loses his kingdom, his
possessions, and has to sell himself and
his family into slavery. Through all of
the trials he and Chandramati have to
suffer, Harishchandra retains his integrity.
After enduring many hardships, includ-
ing the death of their only son, they are
eventually restored to their original
happy state, including the resuscitation
of their son.

Chandrayana
(“moon’s path”) Penitential rite
(prayashchitta) lasting for one lunar
month in which the penitent’s food con-
sumption mirrors the monthly course of
the moon. A person observing this rite
begins by eating fourteen mouthfuls of
food on the first day of the waning
moon, then one less mouthful on each
successive day until the new moon day,
when a complete fast (upavasa) is
observed. On each successive day dur-
ing the waxing moon, the penitent eats
one more mouthful, finishing at fifteen
on the day of the full moon. This is a
fairly severe penance, given the scant
amount of food allowed in the middle of
the month. In the dharma literature,
this penance was prescribed as an
atonement for certain sorts of sexual
misconduct: sexual intercourse with a
woman belonging to the same gotra
(mythic lineage), marrying a woman
belonging to one’s maternal grandfa-
ther’s gotra, or marrying the daughter of
one’s maternal uncle or paternal aunt.
Charaka
(1st–2nd c. C.E.?) The attributed author
of the Charaka Samhita, which along
with the slightly later Sushruta
Samhita, is one of the two major
sources for ayurveda, a traditional
school of Indian medicine. According to
tradition, Charaka was the physician at
the royal court in the city of Takshashila,
in modern Pakistan.
Charaka Samhita
Along with the later Sushruta Samhita,
one of the two major sources for the tra-
ditional Indian medical school known as
ayurveda. Although its authorship is
attributed to Charaka, it is more likely a
compendium from earlier sources,
given its reference to several different
medical systems and approaches. The
underlying medical framework of
ayurveda is the theory of the three bodily
humors—vata (wind), pitta (bile), and
kapha (phlegm). Although everyone hasCharvaka
all three humors, each of these is com-
posed of different elements whose vary-
ing proportions are used to explain
individual body types, metabolic dispo-
sitions, and personalities. Diseases
result from an imbalance of these
humors—caused by one’s environment
or personal habits—whereas equilibri-
um is the state of health. The Charaka
Samhita has been edited and translated
into various languages and has served as
a source for secondary studies, such as
Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Science
and Society in Ancient India, 1977.
Charanadas
(“slave of [God’s] feet”; 1733–1782 C.E.)
Founder of the Charanadasis, an ascetic
religious community. Charanadas was
born in the town of Dehra in the prince-
ly state of Alwar (in the modern state of
Rajasthan). The Charanadasis are also
known as the Shuka Sampraday because,
according to tradition, Charanadas
received initiation from the puranic
sage Shuka. Charanadas formed his
community in protest against the cor-
ruption and worldliness of the Pushti
Marg, the religious community founded
by Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 C.E.),
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Krishna. Like the Pushti
Marg, the Charanadasis are Vaishnavas,
but their patron deity is not Krishna
alone but also his consort, Radha.
Charanadas countered the Pushti Marg
by stressing upright and appropriate
behavior and an insistence on learning.
His disciples translated and wrote com-
mentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the
Bhagavata Purana, both important
Vaishnava texts.
devotees (bhakta) of the god Krishna.
Like the Pushti Marg, the Charanadasis
are Vaishnavas, but their patron deity is
not Krishna alone, but also his consort,
Radha. The Charanadasis have stressed
both learning and an upright way of
life. Their main center is in Delhi, as is
the samadhi shrine of Charanadas,
their founder.
Charanamrta
(“foot nectar”) Literally, the water (or
other liquid) in which the feet of one’s
guru or images of a deity are bathed.
The disciple or devotee (bhakta) con-
sumes it as a sign of subordinate status
and as a way to receive grace and bless-
ings. By extension, the word can refer to
any liquid for devotees to consume as a
symbol of the deity’s grace, whether or
not it has been used for bathing (snana).
Charas
Name for hashish. This is usually mixed
with tobacco and smoked in a straight
pipe called a chillum. Smoking hashish
is typical in certain segments of the
ascetic community. For many ascetics,
smoking is a social activity and a rite of
hospitality as well as a religious act that
emulates the god Shiva, whose love for
the drug is well known. In their travels
many ascetics process the marijuana
that grows wild throughout the
Himalayas into hashish to use and sell.
Drug use is forbidden for most people,
but among ascetics—who are deliber-
ately marginal members of society—it is
a fairly common and tolerated behavior.
Charity

Charanadasi
Vaishnava ascetic sect founded by the
reformer-saint Charanadas (1733–1782
C.E.). Charanadas formed his own com-
munity as a protest against the corrup-
tion of the Pushti Marg, the religious
community founded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531 C.E.) whose members are
Charvaka
One of the traditional names given to
the materialist philosophical school.
Its primary assertion was that a person
is identical to his or her physical body
and is destroyed with the body’s
demise. See materialist.
[[143]]
Chataka
Vishnu sleeping on a serpent couch. According to Hindu tradition, during the four months that Vishnu
sleeps, the world is denied his protective powers and the Chaturmas Vrat is observed during this time.
Chataka
In Sanskrit poetry and literature, the
name for the cuckoo bird, usually
invoked as a symbol of longing.
Chatterjee, Bankim Chandra
(1838–1894) Bengali writer and Indian
nationalist who was one of the major
figures in the nineteenth-century
revival of Bengali literature and in
making the area a hotbed of opposition
to British rule. As a young man,
Chatterjee perceived how the influence
of English language and culture was
superseding that of Indian culture
among educated Indians. He sought to
reverse this through his writing and
political activism by encouraging
Indian intellectuals to rediscover their
classical culture. He became a seminal
figure in both literature and politics,
paving the way for the poet Rabin-
dranath Tagore and political activists
Aurobindo Ghose and Subhash Chandra
Bose. Chatterjee’s most famous novel,
Anandamath , focused on the late
eighteenth-century Sanyasi Rebellion,
[[144]]

in which bands of militant ascetics,
both Hindu and Muslim, fought with
the British East India Company for
control of Bengal. Although historical
inquiry attributes this conflict to social
and economic tensions in contempo-
rary Bengal, Chatterjee portrays it alle-
gorically as a struggle by Mother India’s
loyal children to expel the British
invaders. Chatterjee also wrote the
words to “Vande Mataram” (“Homage to
Mother [India]”), a patriotic song often
described as the unofficial Indian
national anthem.
Chatti
A pilgrim shelter, particularly in the
Himalayas. The word chatti is a variant
form of the word for “umbrella” and was
used because these shelters were often
simply roofs supported by pillars, to
keep the pilgrims dry in case of rain. Up
until the middle of the twentieth
century, many Himalayan pilgrims still
traveled on foot and used a network of
chattis along the pilgrimage routes.
These chattis were eight to twelve milesChaturmas Vrat
apart, an easy day’s walk for younger pil-
grims, yet manageable for the elderly.
Each chatti was maintained by a nearby
family, which would sell the pilgrims
wood and food grains and provide them
with cooking utensils. This arrangement
brought income to mountain families
during the pilgrimage season and freed
pilgrims to carry only their personal
belongings. The advent of paved roads
and bus transportation has largely ren-
dered this network obsolete, although it
survives in certain place names, such as
Janaki Chatti and Hanuman Chatti.
Chatuh-Sampradayi Nagas
Collective name for four groups (sam-
praday) of militant (Naga) ascetics who
are all devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. They all trace their spiritual lin-
eage to a different Vaishnava religious
community, each of which is connected
with a major Vaishnava figure. By far the
most populous and powerful of these
groups is the Shri sampraday of the
Ramanandi ascetics, which traces its
descent through the poet-saint
Ramananda to the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, whom they
claim as Ramananda’s guru. The Sanaka
sampraday of the Nimbarki ascetics
traces its spiritual lineage to the philoso-
pher Nimbarka. The Rudra sampraday
of the Vishnuswami ascetics traces its
lineage through the philosopher
Vallabhacharya to an earlier figure,
Vishnuswami. Finally, the Brahma sam-
praday of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
ascetics traces its spiritual line through
the Bengali saint Chaitanya to the
southern Indian philosopher Madhva.
Each of these sampradays is differentiated
not only by its founder but also by its
patron deity or deities. The Ramanandis
worship the god Rama, whereas the
others worship the god Krishna and, to
different extents, his consort, Radha.
Scholars doubt that these groups
were ever actually connected to the peo-
ple whom they claim as their founders.
The distinctions among the sampradays
appear to be largely academic. Given
that the overwhelming majority of these
ascetics are Ramanandis, the others
seem important only for representing
the other great Vaishnava religious fig-
ures. The distinctions between groups
are only significant during the bathing
(snana) festival known as the Kumbha
Mela, at which they determine the order
of certain groups in the bathing proces-
sions. For more information see Peter
van der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988.
Chaturbhujdas
(late 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
named as members of the community
and as associates of either its founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor,
Vitthalnath. Chaturbhujdas is claimed
as an associate of Vitthalnath—an idea
supported by references in his poetry—
and is also said to be the son of
Kumbhadas, one of the earlier ash-
tachap poets. In his poetry Chatur-
bhujdas presents himself as a companion
to Krishna and his consort, Radha, giv-
ing latter-day devotees a picture of their
daily routine.
Chaturmas Vrat
A period of time spanning four lunar
months, beginning on the festival of
Devshayani Ekadashi (June–July) and
ending on the festival of Devotthayan
Ekadashi (October–November). The
four months in between these festivals
are considered ritually inauspicious,
since during that time the god Vishnu is
considered to be sleeping, and the pro-
tective power in the universe is less
attentive. Thus people generally do not
perform auspicious life cycle rites such
as weddings during this period. This
time also coincides with the coming of
the monsoon, which is essential for
[[145]]
Chau
helping crops to grow but also brings
danger from waterborne infections and
venomous snakes. Chaturmas Vrat’s
inauspicious qualities and the difficulty
of travel caused by the monsoon make
this a time when wandering ascetics
should stay in one place. Religious wor-
ship during this period tends to stress
rites of protection, to shield one from
these ritual and physical dangers. See
also inauspiciousness.
Chau
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Bhara-
tanatyam, Kathak, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Different
forms of Chau are found in the border
areas shared by the states of Orissa,
Bihar, and West Bengal. In all three
regions, the dancers wear masks (chau),
making this type different from other
classical dance forms. The expressions
on the masks set a mood and conceal
the dancers’ faces. Consequently, Chau
performers use their bodies and ges-
tures to develop the moods established
by their masks. The prevailing themes in
Chau dance are drawn from the mythi-
cal adventures of gods and heroes, par-
ticularly the mythology of the god Shiva.

Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Chaupai
(“four-footed”) Poetic form in northern
Indian poetry. As its name suggests, the
chaupai is made up of four lines. The
rhyme scheme is aabb, which has led
some to consider it a compound of two
two-line segments. Based on the dis-
tinction between “heavy” and “light”
syllables, each line contains sixteen
metric beats arranged in a pattern of
[[6]]
 + 4 + 4 + 2. A heavy syllable contains a
long vowel or a consonant cluster and is
counted as two metric beats; all other
syllables are light and count as one beat.
The chaupai is one of the most impor-
tant meters in medieval Hindi literature,
[[146]]

particularly for longer narrative works,
and it is a significant meter in bhakti
(devotional) poetry. Its most famous
use appears in the Ramcharitmanas,
the Ramayana retold by the poet-
saint Tulsidas.
Chaurasi Vaishnavan Ki Varta
(“account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”)
Sectarian hagiography supposedly com-
posed by Gokulnath, the third guru of
the Pushti Marg, a religious community
of Krishna devotees (bhakta) founded
by the philosopher Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531). It is more likely that the
text was written by Gokulnath’s disciple
Hariray, who also wrote a commentary
on the work. The text describes the lives
of eighty-four paradigmatic Vaishnavas,
all of whom were allegedly associated
with the sect’s first two gurus,
Vallabhacharya and Vitthalnath. The
text’s primary purpose is to illustrate
the importance of the Pushti Marg,
particularly the importance of the
Pushti Marg’s leaders on these eighty-
four religious figures. This makes it an
interesting sectarian work, but it is not
historically reliable.
Chauri
A small whisk used to brush off flies and
insects. The name is derived from the
word for the long tail hairs of a yak
(chamara), from which it was originally
made. In ancient India the chauri was
an emblem of royalty, and thus it is also
often seen in statues of religious figures
such as the Didarganj Yakshi.
Chayagrahi
(“shadow grabber”) A demoness in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. Chayagrahi lives in the
ocean and catches birds flying overhead
by grasping their shadows in the water
and pulling the helpless creatures down
to her waiting jaws. This method brings
her a steady food supply, but her big
mistake is trying to capture the monkey-
god, Hanuman, in this way. HanumanChildhood Rites
tries to leap over the ocean to Lanka, the
capital of the demon-king Ravana, to
search for his abducted mistress, Sita.
Chayagrahi grabs him and drags him
down, but he quickly kills her and con-
tinues on his way.
Chera Dynasty
Hindu dynasty that ruled much of the
modern state of Kerala from the second
century B.C.E. to the eighth century C.E.
The Cheras were in continual conflict
with the Pandyas and the Cholas, the
two other dynasties in the deep south,
and were eventually absorbed when the
Cholas gained control in the ninth cen-
tury C.E. See also Chola dynasty.
Chidambaram
(“clothed in thought”) Temple town in
the South Arcot district of the state of
Tamil Nadu, about 125 miles south of
Madras. The town of Chidambaram is
famous for the temple of the same
name, dedicated to the god Shiva in his
form as Nataraja, the lord of the dance.
This temple is also renowned as con-
taining the subtlest of the five elemental
lingas (bhutalingas), the linga made
from space. The temple is built in the
classical Dravida style, with temple tow-
ers (gopurams) rising in each of the car-
dinal directions, and the walls enclosing
the temple between them. The present
temple was erected in the tenth century
C.E., when Chidambaram was the capital
of the Chola dynasty, and is reputed to
be one of the oldest temples in southern
India. As lord of the dance, Nataraja
symbolizes the connection between
religion and the arts. Nataraja is the pri-
mal dancer whose dance encompasses
creation, destruction, and all things in
between. Human dancers imitate him
literally, by performing the dance posi-
tions he codified, and figuratively, by
participating in a creative activity. The
temple’s eastern wall has relief carvings
of the 108 basic dance positions
(karanas) that are still central to classi-
cal Indian dance, particularly to the
Bharatanatyam school, which is the
major dance form in Tamil Nadu.
Nataraja also has a group of hereditary
servants, the Dikshitars. According
to their tradition, the Dikshitars
were members of Shiva’s heavenly host
(gana) and accompanied him down
from heaven when he took up residence
in Chidambaram.
Chidvilasananda
(b. Malti Shetty, 1955) Modern Hindu
teacher and successor to Swami
Muktananda. Muktananda taught a
type of spiritual discipline called siddha
yoga, the “discipline of the adepts,”
which stresses chanting, meditation,
learning, and above all, devotion to
one’s spiritual master. Chidvilasananda
is the current leader and preceptor of
SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham America), the
organization founded by her teacher.
During her childhood, her parents and
other members of her family were
Muktananda’s disciples, and she spent
much of her life in his service, eventual-
ly serving as his translator during his vis-
its to America. She and her brother,
Subhash (who later took the name
Nityananda), were both designated
by Muktananda as his successors, but
her brother left the organization a
few years after Muktananda’s death.
Chidvilasananda continues to travel
between an ashram in Ganeshpuri, near
Bombay, and ashrams and centers
around the world.
Childhood Rites
A collective name for the samskaras of
early childhood, as specified in the
Dharma Shastras, or treatises on reli-
gious duty (dharma). These rites include
the jatakarma (birth ceremonies),
namakarana (naming), nishkramana
(first outing), annaprashana (first feed-
ing), chudakarana (tonsure), and kar-
navedha (piercing the ears). Virtually
all Hindu communities have cere-
monies for ritually marking births and
childhood, but few people perform
[[147]]
Child Marriages
the rites prescribed by the Dharma
Shastras other than brahmins. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The
former is encyclopedic and the latter
more accessible; despite their age they
remain the best sources for traditional
Hindu rites.
Child Marriages
Until well into the twentieth century, in
many families it was traditional to marry
off their children before the onset of
puberty. An early marriage was deemed
particularly important for women, lest
they come of age before they were mar-
ried. Some apologists claim that this
practice evolved as a way to preserve the
honor of Hindu girls against the depre-
dations of Muslim raiders. Though this
may have been partially true, such
depredations were not widespread
enough to evolve such a well-accepted
social practice. Traditional Indian cul-
ture ascribes a much stronger sex drive
to women than to men, and an early
marriage would ensure that they did not
disgrace the family under the influence
of their irresistible urges. These mar-
riages were possible because arranged
marriages were the norm, as they
remain to this day.
Many of the Hindu reformist move-
ments that began in the late nine-
teenth century considered child
marriages one of the “corruptions” of
contemporary Hindu life and lobbied
vigorously to forbid it. Modern Indian
law sets the minimum age for marriage
at sixteen for women and eighteen for
men. These guidelines are often flout-
ed, particularly in rural areas, where
one still hears of marriages between
infants. Although child marriages still
occur, it is a very low-status practice in
modern Indian society, associated with
poverty, backwardness, and a lack of
education. In contrast, men and
women from the upper classes often
do not marry until their late twenties,
[[148]]

after pursuing advanced degrees. See
also marriage ceremonies.
Child Widows
This term refers to girls who had been
married as children and whose hus-
bands (whether older men or boys their
own age) died before the girls reached
puberty and the marriage had been con-
summated. Although the lives of such
child widows varied according to the
status of their families, their lives were
often quite grim, given the traditional
prohibitions on widow remarriage and
the strict behavioral codes mandated for
widows. Reformers in the nineteenth
century, such as Ram Mohan Roy,
championed the drive to promote
societal acceptance of second marriages
for child widows. Due to the sharp
decline in the frequency of child mar-
riages, child widows are extremely
uncommon in modern times. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Chillum
Implement used for smoking. The
chillum is a graduated cylinder of baked
clay that is usually about six inches long,
which is about an inch in diameter at
the top and half that at the bottom. A
pyramid-shaped piece of clay is wedged
point-down in the cylinder to cut down
on the airflow. The top part of the cylin-
der is filled with tobacco, cannabis, or a
mixture of tobacco and hashish (cha-
ras). Smoking is a communal activity in
which the chillum is passed from one
person to another. The bottom of the
chillum is covered with a cloth called a
safai, which is sometimes changed from
person to person and is often dipped in
water to mellow the smoke. Chillum eti-
quette holds that one should not place
one’s mouth directly on the bottom of
the implement, which would render it
impure. Because of this, the chillum is
generally held between one’s fingers,
often in highly elaborate and symbolic
ways. Among many ascetics, smoking
the chillum is a part of daily life, aChintapurni
congregational exercise, and also the act
of emulating the god Shiva, the paradig-
matic ascetic, whose love for drugs is
well known.
Chinmayanand, Swami
(b. Balakrishna Menon, 1915–1993)
Modern Hindu ascetic and teacher.
Chinmayanand became an ascetic under
the influence of Swami Shivananda,
whose articles Chinmayanand had first
read while serving a prison sentence for
his involvement in the independence
movement. For several years he devoted
himself to the study of ancient texts and
became one of the leading authorities of
the Vedas. Part of his legacy is the
Chinmayanand Mission, which carried
the abstract, intellectual, and peaceful
message of the Vedanta philosophical
school to the world. Another part of his
legacy is the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a
modern militant Hindu organization.
He was one of its founding members in
[[1964]]
, and for some years he was the only
ascetic on its governing council.
Chinmoy, Shri
(b. 1931) Modern Hindu teacher and
missionary, who since 1964 has spent
much of his life addressing Western
audiences. His teachings are largely
drawn from classical ideas on yoga and
stress the importance of vegetarianism,
discipline, and service to one’s guru. His
own lifestyle is austere and largely unos-
tentatious, as an example to his follow-
ers. On one hand he is notable for his
attention to the arts—painting, poetry,
and music, particularly the bamboo
flute—and on the other for performing
prodigious feats of strength to demon-
strate the power of mind over matter. He
is based in New York City, although like
many modern Hindu teachers, he trav-
els throughout the world.
Chin (“consciousness”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra) in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the
hand gesture used to signify explana-
tion or exposition. For this reason it is
also known as the vyakhyana (“teach-
ing”) mudra and the sandarshana
(“expository”) mudra.
Chinnamasta
(“She whose head [masta] has been cut
off [chinna]”) Particular manifestation
of the Goddess, one of the Mahavidyas
(a group of ten powerful goddesses), and
an important deity in the esoteric ritual
tradition known as tantra. The image of
Chinnamasta is one of the most striking
in Hindu iconography: a naked headless
woman often seated on a copulating
couple, holding her head on a platter
and gushing three streams of blood
from her neck—two into the mouths of
Chinnamasta’s attendant deities and
one into the lips of her own severed
head. The story behind this figure is that
Chinnamasta severs her own head to
satisfy the demands of her attendants
because they have not drunk their fill of
blood in battle. This image graphically
portrays the interconnections between
nourishment, sex, and death and the
power of the Goddess over all of
these things. Although Chinnamasta is
powerful, she does not have many
temples dedicated to her. One of the
most important is the temple of the
goddess Chintapurni, identified as a
form of Chinnamasta in the Shiwalik
Hills. For further information see
David R. Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986;
and Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993.
Chintapurni
(“She who fulfills one’s wishes”)
Presiding goddess of a temple in a vil-
lage by the same name in the state of
Himachal Pradesh. Chintapurni is one
of the Shiwalik goddesses, a group of
local deities in the Shiwalik Hills who
are all considered to be manifestations
[[149]]
Chir Ghat
Depiction of Krishna having stolen the gopis’ clothes while they were bathing.
This episode from Hindu mythology is believed to have taken place at Chir Ghat.
[[150]]

of a single feminine divine energy.
Chintapurni is considered to be a form
of the goddess Chinnamasta, and this
temple is one of the few dedicated
exclusively to her.tree from which Krishna humbled the
gopis. As pilgrims recall the story, they
tie strips of cloth to the tree to relieve the
gopis’ embarrassment and share in their
feeling of communion.
Chir GhatChitpavan
(“Clothing Ghat”) A bathing (snana)
place on the Yamuna River in the town
of Brindavan, which is identified as the
site for one of the most famous stories
about Krishna. The story tells how the
gopis, Krishna’s female companions,
have taken a religious vow to bathe each
morning in the Yamuna during the cold
months and dedicate the religious merit
from this vow toward gaining Krishna as
their beloved. Although their austerity is
laudable, they are also bathing naked,
which is taboo in Hindu culture. Krishna
spies them in the water and climbs up in
a tree with their clothes. He then refuses
to return the clothes until the mortified
women come out of the water to ask for
them, symbolically demonstrating the
nakedness of the soul before God and
humans’ inability to control the divine.
A gigantic tree still stands by the Chir
Ghat, which is believed to be the sameA brahmin jati that is a subset of the
Maharashtri brahmins, who were them-
selves one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida). Jatis
were endogamous subgroups of tradi-
tional Indian society whose status was
determined by the group’s hereditary
occupation. This sort of differentiation
applied even to brahmins, whose role
has been to serve as priests, scholars,
and teachers. The core region for the
Chitpavan brahmins is in western
Maharashtra, particularly the coastline
and the region around Poona. Although
never very numerous, they were histori-
cally significant both as the chief minis-
ters (peshwas) to the Maratha kings and
also for producing some of the great figures
in the struggle for independence: M. G.
Ranade, G. K. Gokhale, B. G. Tilak, and
V. D. Savarkar. Because this group of
brahmins was largely located on theChokamela
Konkan coastline, they are also known
as Konkanastha.
Chitrakut
City in the Banda district of Uttar
Pradesh, about sixty miles south and
west of the city of Allahabad. In the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics, Chitrakut is the place in
which Rama, the epic’s hero, his wife
Sita, and his brother Lakshmana live
during the early part of their exile. It
is here as well that Rama instructs
another brother, Bharata, to rule as
regent until the fourteen years of Rama’s
exile have ended.
Chitswami
(late 16th c. C.E.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
also named as members of the commu-
nity and as associates of either the com-
munity’s founder, Vallabhacharya, or
his successor, Vitthalnath. Chitswami is
traditionally associated with Vitthalnath,
a link confirmed by his poems written in
praise of this guru. Aside from such
explicitly sectarian compositions,
Chitswami also wrote poetry in praise of
Krishna, which tends to be more
elaborate and uses more Sanskrit than
his contemporaries. To date, his works
have not been translated, perhaps
because interest in them is limited to
a small sect.
Chittirai
First month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Mesha (the zodiacal sign of
Aries, which by the Indian solar calendar
usually falls within April and May). This
name is a modification of Chitra, the four-
teenth of the twenty-seven nakshatras in
the lunar zodiac. See also Tamil months.
Chittirai
(2) Ten-day festival celebrated in the
southern Indian city of Madurai during
the Tamil month of Chittirai
(March–April). Madurai is famous for its
gigantic temple dedicated to the god-
dess Minakshi, and the Chittirai festival
celebrates Minakshi’s marriage to the
god Shiva in his form as Sundareshvara.
According to mythology, Minakshi is a
fierce goddess who vows that she will
marry only a man who bests her in bat-
tle. She fights and conquers all of the
kings of the earth, but when she
approaches Shiva, she is suddenly and
spontaneously stricken with modesty.
The powerful warrior is transformed
into a shy and bashful girl, and she
becomes his wife.
Although the wedding of a goddess
normally marks her domestication and
subordination to her spouse, in this case
Minakshi remains the more powerful
deity. She is the patron of Madurai, with
a temple dedicated to her, whereas
Shiva is merely her consort. The wed-
ding is celebrated with great festivity
throughout the city, and one of the high
points is the public procession of the
deities around the city in the temple
chariots. For further information see
Dean David Shulman, Tamil Temple
Myths, 1980; the festival is also the
subject of a film, The Wedding of
the Goddess, produced by the South
Asia Center of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.
Chokamela
(d. 1338 C.E.) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Chokamela was born an
untouchable Mahar, and he is the only
untouchable among the Varkari saints.
Despite Chokamela’s deep devotion to
Vithoba, his low social status prohibited
him from ever entering the god’s temple,
since his very presence would have ren-
dered it impure. The hagiographical
[[151]]
Chola Dynasty
literature tells many tales where Vithoba
comes outside to meet him. Chokamela’s
memorial shrine is at the steps of the
temple, the same steps that marked
his boundary during his life. It seems
that Chokamela accepted the restric-
tions that came with his social status,
but some of his poetry expresses
social protest. For further information
see G. A. Deleury, The Cult of Vithoba,
[[1960]]
; and Eleanor Zelliot, “Chokamela
and Eknath: Two Bhakti Modes of
Legitimacy for Modern Change,” in
Journal of Asian and African Studies, Vol.
[[15]]
, Nos. 1–2, 1980.
Chola Dynasty
(9th–13th c. C.E.) Southern Indian
dynasty whose ancestral homeland
was the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu.
The earliest Chola capital was in the city
of Tanjore itself, but was later moved
to Gangaikondacholapuran under
Rajendra I (r. 1014–1042 C.E.). The
Tanjore district is in the Cauvery River
delta and is extremely fertile rice-grow-
ing land. The Chola monarchs used this
agricultural strength as the foundation
for their empire. The Cholas were origi-
nally vassals of the Pallava dynasty but
became independent late in the ninth
century. In the tenth and eleventh cen-
turies, the Cholas were the dominant
power in southern India, controlling
much of peninsular India and Sri Lanka
and sending naval expeditions as far as
Malaysia. The Cholas were noted for
their public works, particularly the con-
struction of massive temples in the
Tanjore district and other parts of Tamil
Nadu; one of the most impressive was
the Brhadeshvar temple built by Raja
Raja (r. 985–1014 C.E.). On a smaller
scale, the Chola dynasty also patronized
exquisite sculptures, especially bronzes.
This dynasty’s rapid rise was marked
by an equally swift demise. By the
middle of the thirteenth century, they
had been attacked several times by
the Pandya dynasty and were finally
conquered in 1279.
[[152]]

Chudakarana
(“tonsure”) Samskara
The eighth of the traditional life cycle
ceremonies (samskaras). In the chu-
dakarana samskara, the hair is shaved
off of the child’s head, although fre-
quently a tuft of hair (chuda) is left. This
is the last of the childhood samskaras,
marking the ritual end of infancy, and it
is still often performed in modern India,
particularly by brahmin families. The
timing for this rite is usually determined
by family custom (kulachara), although
in many cases it is performed when the
child’s age is an odd number (most com-
monly at one, three, or five years old).
Since most Indian babies are born with
hair, and hair is commonly believed to
trap impurities, the chudakarana is seen
as a rite of purification where the last of
the residual impurities from childbirth
are removed. As in many other cultures,
this cut-off hair is believed to retain a
powerful connection with the child.
Traditional belief holds that in the
wrong hands, this hair could be used to
work black magic against the child.
Given this concern, the hair is usually
carefully gathered and disposed of, most
often by putting it into running water.
Chunar
Sandstone quarry about twenty-five
miles south of modern Benares. This
quarry is notable as the source of the
stone for the pillars erected by the
Mauryan king Ashoka. The pillars were
set up on the major trade routes within
his empire and were inscribed with royal
proclamations known as the pillar
edicts. See also Maurya dynasty.
Churail
(perhaps from the Sanskrit word cur,
meaning “to steal”) Feminine malignant
spirit believed to be the ghost of a
woman who dies childless, in childbirth,
or with her desires somehow unsatis-
fied. These frustrated desires lead such
spirits to seek revenge by harming others,Conch Shell
particularly children, to destroy the hap-
piness they were denied. For further
information about churails and other
unquiet spirits of the dead, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988; and Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Cinnabar
Common name for mercuric sulfide,
which takes the form of red crystals or
clumps. Cinnabar is important in Indian
alchemy, particularly that of the mercu-
rial (dhatuvada) school because it is a
chemical union of the two elements rep-
resenting the god Shiva (mercury) and
his consort, Shakti (sulfur). According
to Hindu alchemy, the world is a series
of bipolar opposites in tension with one
another. By unifying these opposing
forces, one may achieve spiritual
progress and the end of reincarnation
(samsara). In Hindu alchemy this is
done by physically consuming various
substances. In this case, mercury is said
to be Shiva’s semen and sulfur Shakti’s
uterine blood; their combination and
consumption is believed to spur the
aspirant’s progress.
Collyrium
A salve for the eyes, traditionally made
from soot, camphor, beeswax, and
various fragrances. Part of its function
is cosmetic—it is used to outline and
define the eyes. It is also widely believed
to have medicinal qualities that improve
one’s vision and heal various minor
eye ailments.
Commensality
This word refers to patterns of social
exchange, particularly those associated
with eating. In traditional Hindu society,
the hierarchical status distinctions
between different social groups were
both marked and maintained by strict
rules on exchanges and sharing.
Traditional marriage customs illustrate
the role of social groups, in which people
married those who belonged to their
own particular jati (“birth”), or social
subgroup. Another arena in which these
concerns were quite visible was that of
food. Cooked food is believed to be
extremely susceptible to ritual impurity
(ashaucha) and can transmit impurities
to the person eating it. To shield
themselves from this source of impurity,
groups with higher social status
would not accept cooked foods from
groups with lower social status. In
contrast, lower-status groups would
accept cooked foods from groups with
higher status.
These concerns over maintaining
social status set up certain eating pat-
terns whose influence is still evident.
Higher-status groups, particularly brah-
mins, would generally eat with mem-
bers of their own community and only
when a brahmin had cooked the food.
For groups highly concerned with ritual
purity, the best meal is one cooked at
home by a family member, because this
ensures the food’s purity. Even in mod-
ern times, the most orthodox brahmins
will eat food cooked outside the home
only when it cannot be avoided. It is
always considered preferable to eat food
brought from home, whether one is on a
long journey or merely at lunch in the
office. Although in earlier times, the
groups with the highest status would
generally not eat with others, this cus-
tom has changed. Thus brahmin office
workers may eat lunch with colleagues
from many different communities, but
they would never think of inviting them
for a meal at their homes. For further
information on the way that exchanges
reveal status differences, see McKim
Marriot, “Hindu Transactions: Diversity
Without Dualism,” in Bruce Kapferer
(ed.), Transaction and Meaning, 1976.
Conch Shell
With the end of its spiral removed, this
was used as both a musical instrument
and a weapon of war, since the sound of
certain conch shells was believed to
strike terror into people’s hearts. This is
[[153]]
Consecration
Coomaraswamy was largely responsible
for publicizing Hindu miniature paint-
ing as a genre distinct from the contem-
porary Muslim court painting. Due to
the strength of this and other interpre-
tive scholarly works, he became curator
of Indian and Muslim art at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston. He held this post
from 1917 to 1931, and his catalog of the
museum’s collection shows painstaking
and objective scholarship. In his later
years, he began to publish works on aes-
thetics, myth, religion, and culture,
focusing not only on India but also on
traditional Europe.
Corbelling
The architectural technique of corbelling was
used to form the arched entrance to the
Mukteshvar Temple in Bhubaneshvar.
one of the four objects invariably carried
by the god Vishnu and thus one of his
identifying markers. See shankha.
Consecration
This term can refer to two different rites
performed in the creation of Hindu
images. One of these is devapratishtha,
or “establishing the deity,” the rites by
which an image of a deity is constructed
and established as an object of worship.
The word consecration can also be used
to refer to pranapratishtha, the more
important ritual, in which the image is
infused with the breath of life and
becomes the seat for the deity.
Coomaraswamy, Ananda
(1877–1947) Intellectual and art histori-
an who was one of the first Indian schol-
ars to address a predominantly Western
audience. He was born in modern Sri
Lanka, the son of a Hindu father and an
English mother. Although he was
trained as a geologist, by 1910 he had
found his true vocation, the study of art.
[[154]]

In the realm of architecture this term
refers to the creation of a dome or arch
through overlapping masonry courses.
This technique was widely used in
Indian temples, particularly those con-
structed in the Nagara style of architec-
ture in Orissa and the rest of northern
India. Corbelling was the prevailing
method of creating the shape of an arch,
since the true arch—in which each
part is supported in tension with the
others—was unknown in classical
Hindu architecture.
Coromandel
Traditional name for the southern
Indian coastal region bordering the Bay
of Bengal, in the modern states of Tamil
Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
Corpse
In the Hindu worldview, a corpse is the
source of the most virulent possible rit-
ual impurity (ashaucha). Although
Hindus accept death as an inevitable
part of life, the dangers caused by a
corpse cannot be ignored. The dead
body must be appropriately handled,
both to protect the living from danger
and to help the deceased make a
smooth transition to the next life. For
this reason the last rites (antyeshthi
samskara) are begun on the day of
death itself. Among the earliest of theseCosmic Time
rites is the cremation of the dead body,
since the impurity will continue to affect
those around the body until it has been
consumed by fire. A second reason for
immediate cremation is to get rid of a
potential host for wandering spirits,
who according to popular fears, can
reanimate a corpse.
Coryat, Thomas
(1577–1617) English traveler in India
popularly known as the English faqir.
Coryat came to India from Persia and
spent several years traveling around the
Moghul empire in northern India as well
as residing in the Moghul court at Agra.
Although at times his need for patron-
age made him play the role of a buffoon
and flatterer, Coryat was a careful
observer who was full of curiosity. He is
believed to have been the first European
traveler to visit the pilgrimage city of
Haridwar, and he was impressed with
the rites performed there. He is also
believed to have gone into the Shiwalik
Hills all the way to the temple at
Jwalamukhi. Unfortunately, Coryat
died of dysentery before he could
record these observations, and the only
available references to these later
journeys come from his companion,
the Reverend Edward Terry. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Cosmic Egg
(brahmanda) One of the traditional
cosmological metaphors, which first
appears in the Markandeya Purana.
This text describes a single swollen
egg floating on the waters of the sea
of pralaya, or cosmic dissolution.
When this egg is broken open by
Brahma, its constituent parts (yolk,
white, shell, and various membranes)
form both the material universe and all
the creatures in it. Although this account
is clearly symbolic, it vividly expresses
the Hindu conviction that all things
have come from a single source,
and thus the entire cosmos is an
organic whole. For further elaboration see
Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A. B. van Buitenen
(eds. and trans.), Classical Hindu
Mythology, 1978.
Cosmic Time
In traditional Indian cosmology, time
has neither beginning nor end. Instead
it proceeds in unceasing cyclic alterna-
tions between creation and activity, fol-
lowed by cessation and quietude. The
universe thus has neither an ultimate
beginning nor an ultimate end—cre-
ation will always be followed by destruc-
tion and then destruction by a new
creation. Within the confines of this
assumption, there are several different
and sometimes competing systems for
measuring cosmic time.
The largest generally accepted
measure of time, spanning 4.32 billion
years, is the kalpa, or day of Brahma.
This is the ultimate limit for the
existence of the created world, although
within this period the universe
undergoes periodic renewals. At the
conclusion of the day of Brahma comes
the universal dissolution (pralaya), in
which the universe is completely
destroyed and reabsorbed into the god
Vishnu. The day of Brahma is followed
by a night of equal length, during which
the only living thing is Vishnu; the god
sleeps on the back of his serpent couch,
Shesha, which floats on the surface of
the cosmic ocean. When the night of
Brahma is ended, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel. This lotus opens to
reveal the god Brahma, who takes up
the work of creation, and the cycle of
activity begins anew. Because of his
spontaneous appearance at the begin-
ning of every cosmic age, one of the
names for Brahma is Svayambhu (“self-
born”). Unlike the Judeo-Christian con-
cept of creation, Brahma does not create
the world from nothing but merely
arranges and fashions existing elements
into a coherent and ordered cosmos.
The day of Brahma is broken up into
smaller units according to various sys-
tems. By far the most common system is
that of the four yugas, or cosmic ages.
According to this idea, the day of
[[155]]
Cosmology
Brahma is made up of one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas, named the Krta
yuga, Treta yuga, Dvapara yuga, and
Kali yuga. Each of these is shorter than
its predecessor and ushers in an era
more degenerate and depraved. The
passage of the four yugas begins with a
time of sudden and dramatic renewal at
the onset of the krta yuga, followed by a
steady and persistent decline. Although
the kali yuga is the shortest of the four
ages, it is also the time of the greatest
wickedness and depravity, in which any
evil is possible. It is also, not surprisingly,
considered to be the period in which we
are now living. By the end of the kali
yuga, things have gotten so bad that the
only solution is the destruction and
recreation of the earth, at which time
the next krta era begins. Even though
the kali yuga is the shortest age, it still
lasts for 432,000 years, and the preced-
ing yugas are two, three, and four times
the length of the kali age. The increasing
degeneracy of each of the four yugas is
symbolized by the metals associated
with them: gold (krta), silver (dvapara),
bronze (treta) and iron (kali). Another
indication is the status of human beings,
who are said to become shorter, more
wicked, and shorter-lived in each suc-
ceeding age. The paradigm of the four
yugas leaves little room in traditional
Hinduism for the notion of progress,
since according to this system, things
will never be better than they
have already been. It idealizes a lost
and unattainable past rather than a
utopian future.
An alternate system of measuring
cosmic time connects the human and
the divine calendars, with one human
year equal to a single day for the gods.
The six months when the sun travels
toward the north (uttarayana) is the
divine day, whereas the six months
when it travels south (dakshinayana) is
the divine night. Since an Indian solar
year is 360 solar days, a divine year
would thus last for 360 human years.
[[156]]

The life span of Brahma is one hundred
divine years and thus 36,000 human
years, after which the world is destroyed
and created anew.
A third system is that of the
Manvantaras, or ages of Manu. This sys-
tem divides the day of Brahma into
fourteen equal ages, with each one last-
ing a little less than 309,000 years. Each
age is identified by the particular divine
sovereign (manu) who rules during that
age. None of these three systems corre-
spond to one another, and there is no
real effort to reconcile them. This lack of
correspondence indicates that their
function was primarily mythic, to
establish a coherent cosmic chronology
and pattern rather than to describe
actual events.
Cosmology
Hindu culture has no single cosmology
but rather several different systems,
each of which is well established in its
own right. The oldest model appears in
the Rg Veda (10.90), the oldest Hindu
religious text, and is known as the
Purusha Sukta (“Hymn to the Primeval
Man”). This hymn describes the cre-
ation of the world and all living beings
as the result of the sacrifice of the
primeval man (purusha). Different parts
of his body become different parts of the
physical universe and the traditional
social groups. Another Vedic metaphor
is that of the Golden Embryo, which is
the only existing thing until it develops
into Prajapati, the creator of the uni-
verse. A third version, that of the Cosmic
Egg, is found in the later religious texts
known as the puranas, which are com-
pilations of mythology and lore.
According to this image, the entire uni-
verse is originally contained in the
Cosmic Egg. Once it is broken, the egg’s
constituent parts (shell, white, yolk, and
membranes) become all of the things of
the earth. The final cosmological image
from the puranas, and perhaps the most
common, begins with the god Vishnu
floating in the sea of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya), lying on the back of his serpentCow
couch, Shesha. When the time for cre-
ation comes, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal the
god Brahma, who begins the process of
creation. This process reverses at the
onset of the cosmic dissolution, with
Brahma being reabsorbed into Vishnu’s
body. Despite their differing symbols, all
of these models share the conviction
that the universe has come from a single
source and thus that the entire cosmos
is an organic whole.
Although there are many models for
the origin of the cosmos, there is wider
agreement about its geography. The uni-
verse is generally considered to have
three tiers, and each of these tiers can
have multiple levels. The visible world is
considered the middle tier, sandwiched
between the heavens of the upper world
(often numbered as seven) and the
realms of the underworld. Some of the
latter are hells, whereas some of these
lower worlds are simply considered to
be alternate realms of existence. The vis-
ible world is often described as a series
of concentric landmasses (dvipas) sepa-
rated from each other by seven oceans
(the saptasindhu), each composed of a
different substance. The innermost of
these landmasses is Jambudvipa, whose
center is the mythical Mount Meru,
often identified with Mount Kailas in
the Himalayas. In traditional cosmology
Mount Meru stands at the center of the
universe and is compared to the central
calyx of a lotus. Mount Meru is sur-
rounded by mountain ranges, with a dif-
ferent region in each of the cardinal
directions. The region south of Mount
Meru is the land known as Bharata, the
traditional name for the Indian subcon-
tinent. Bharata is said to be superior to
the other three regions of Jambudvipa
because only in Bharata are religious rit-
uals correctly performed. In its mythic
geography, therefore, India is consid-
ered the center of the universe and the
best possible place to live to pursue reli-
gious life. For further information see

Buitenen, Classical Hindu Mythology,

Cow
Animal revered by almost all modern
Hindus, although there is one small
Hindu community in the state of Kerala
that eats beef. Aside from this anomaly,
reverence for the cow is one of the few
unifying beliefs for almost all Hindu
communities. Demands for a complete
ban on cow slaughter have become a
time-honored way for political groups to
generate support from the orthodox
Hindu community, although these
demands carry far more weight in
northern India, where a significant
Muslim minority has few scruples
about slaughtering and eating beef.
Organized calls for such a ban began as
early as the 1880s with the growth of
tension between the Hindu and Muslim
communities. This sentiment, generally
called the Cow Protection Movement,
has continued to the present day.
Demands for a complete ban on cow
slaughter have regularly surfaced since
[[1947]]
, when India gained independence,
and this is one of the loaded causes of
Indian political life. Reverence for the
cow goes to such lengths that one of the
charitable acts performed by pious
Hindus is to contribute to goshalas,
institutions for old and infirm cows.
There is considerable speculation
and some disagreement about the
source of these feelings about the cow.
Some arguments have stressed the cow’s
value in an agricultural society, as a
source of both draft animals and repro-
ducible wealth. Other arguments have
stressed the cow’s ability to transform
agricultural waste into milk products
and dung, a common fuel in much of
northern India. Still others have noted
the way that feelings about the cow are
imbued with the symbolism of mother-
hood, since both are said to provide
milk for a child’s nourishment. This last
point is probably the most important,
since it is very clear that conservative
Hindu feelings for the cow are based pri-
marily on high emotional content rather
than on rational considerations of costs
and benefits.
[[157]]
Cow Dung
Girls carry dried cow dung mixed with straw to be used as fuel.
Cow Dung
This is considered both ritually pure and
purifying, perhaps because of its origin
in the sacred cow. A piece of ground can
be purified (as when preparing a site for
a ritual) by smearing it with cow dung.
Cow dung is one of the ingredients in
the “five products of the cow” (pancha-
gavya), which is drunk as a means of
purification from sin. In addition to its
spiritual significance, cattle dung is very
important for daily life in the villages of
India. When mixed with clay it forms a
hard, dustless, and easily cleaned sur-
face that is preferable to an earthen
floor. It is also a reliable source of fuel
available to even the poorest people.
Cow Protection Movement
General term for a grassroots conserva-
tive Hindu effort to ban the slaughter of
cattle, particularly the cow. The tradi-
tional Hindu devotion to the cow has
been articulated in calls for a ban on
cow slaughter for more than a century.
The call was first raised in 1875 by
Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the
founder of the reformist Arya Samaj. It
[[158]]

continued to be a basic demand of later
conservative Hindu-oriented groups,
including the Hindu Mahasabha,
the Ram Rajya Parishad, and the
Vishva Hindu Parishad. The call for this
ban occasionally surfaces even in
contemporary times, since it carries
strong support from many religiously
conservative Hindus.
The cow protection demand contin-
ues to have profound political implica-
tions. Swami Dayanand Saraswati’s
work in the late nineteenth century
coincided with the awakening of Indian
political consciousness and the begin-
nings of the struggle to regain power
from British imperial rule. Under British
power, overt political dissent was subject
to heavy government restrictions, and
outright rebellion was impossible. Since
the British did not generally interfere
with “religious” issues, the demand for a
ban on cow slaughter was a way for
Hindus to assert and define their identity
and by implication affirm that India was
a Hindu land.
The Cow Protection Movement also
caused friction between the Hindu and
Muslim communities, since HindusCreation Hymn
worship cows, whereas Muslims eat
them. Hindus saw Muslim beef con-
sumption as a flagrant violation of their
religious sensibilities, and Muslims saw
the demand for a ban on cow slaughter
as a thinly veiled attempt to reinforce
Muslim status as second-class citizens.
Communal relations were often particu-
larly volatile around the annual Muslim
festival of Id, at which it is traditional for
each family to sacrifice an animal and
in which many of the more affluent
Muslim families would sacrifice cattle.
As the relationship between these two
communities deteriorated in the 1930s,
cow slaughter (or rumor thereof) was
often cited as the spark for communal
riots in which hundreds of people
were killed.
This tension persists in modern
India, although it has rarely erupted into
violence since the partition of the sub-
continent in 1947. Modern India was
founded as a secular state where the
government does not favor any particu-
lar religious community. This founding
ethos has made the Indian government
reluctant to pass legislation banning
cattle slaughter, despite continued calls
from traditional Hindus. The Indian
Muslim community, facing the reality of
its minority status in a Hindu majority
state, has had to be far more discreet
about when and how such cow slaugh-
ter takes place.
Cow Slaughter
A complete ban on cow slaughter has
been one of the more durable issues
taken up by Hindu interest groups, from
before India gained independence in
[[1947]]
 all the way up to the present day.
Although debate on this issue has con-
tinuously emerged and faded, it remains
a reliable hot button for stirring Hindu
passions. This issue has predictably car-
ried far more weight in northern India,
where there is a significant Muslim
minority with no religious objection to
slaughtering and eating beef. The first
widespread demand for such a ban
came during the Cow Protection
Movement in the 1930s. This movement
aggravated tense communal relations
between the Hindu and Muslim com-
munities, resulting in significant blood-
shed. Since independence it has been a
perennial demand by religious leaders
and ascetics, and it has been an issue in
the platform of Hindu political organi-
zations such as the Jana Sangh, Shiv
Sena, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), and
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the past,
such demands had little effect since the
proponents did not have the power to
implement them. As the BJP and the Shiv
Sena have gained control of state and
local governments, they have tried to
implement this policy. In late 1995 the
VHP initiated a national drive to ban cow
slaughter completely. Like many of the
VHP’s campaigns, this was undertaken
just before upcoming elections, in this
case at the national level. This campaign
was seen as an attempt to polarize the
Hindu electorate in an effort to influ-
ence the national election.
Creation
See cosmology and cosmic time.
Creation Hymn
Popular name for a hymn in the Rg Veda
(10.129), which is one of the most
unusual hymns in the Vedas. The four
Vedas are the oldest Hindu religious
texts, and based on its style and content,
the Rg Veda is the oldest of these. Most
of the hymns in the Rg Veda are invoca-
tions addressed to various divinities.
These hymns are sung to invoke and
propitiate these divinities so that
human beings may enjoy the good
things in life. In marked contrast to the
confidence and optimism found in the
earlier hymns, the Creation Hymn takes
a far more speculative tone. In the
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by
imagining a time before the existence of
Being and Nonbeing, and he speculates
on the origin of the world. In the end the
poet ascribes all creation to a single
impersonal agent, “That One” (Tad

dispose of a corpse, the relatively high cost of wood makes this difficult for poorer families.
Ekam). However, the poem concludes
with the thought that even That One
may not know the secrets of the cosmos.
In its speculative tone and its admission
that the ultimate answer may be
unknown, it foreshadows the final
stratum of the Vedic literature,
the Upanishads.
Cremation
For most Hindus cremation is the
approved method for disposing of a
dead body, although one finds burials in
certain circumstances and subcommu-
nities. The body is usually cremated on
the day of death, often only a few hours
after the person has expired. Although
one could see this as a hygienic measure
in a hot climate, for many Hindus the
religious reasons are even more com-
pelling. First, a corpse is considered to
be a source of violent impurity
(ashaucha) that is removed by destroy-
ing the body by fire. A second reason for
immediate cremation is to get rid of a
potential vehicle for wandering spirits,
who according to popular fears, can
reanimate a corpse.
The rites leading to cremation begin
immediately after death. As for all Hindu
[[160]]

rituals, there is great variation in differ-
ent regions and communities, but the
following description gives a general
picture of these rites, at least in northern
India: The body is bathed, laid on a bier
(often made from bamboo, which is
cheap, strong, and readily available),
and covered with a cloth (white for a
man or a widow, a colored sari for a
married woman). In many cases the big
toes are tied together with a thread, due
to the belief that this prevents an alien
spirit from reanimating the body. The
mourners carry the bier to the crema-
tion ground, chanting the traditional
dirge Ram Nam Satya Hai, Satya Boli
Gati Hai (“God’s name is Truth, Truth
spoken is Passage”). On the way, the
mourners will often halt several times,
not only to rest but also on the chance
that the deceased was merely uncon-
scious. When they arrive at the crema-
tion ground (which is often by a river or
source of water), the corpse is bathed
again and set on a pyre. The chief
mourner (traditionally the eldest son)
circles the pyre, pouring water from a
clay pot, which is then broken. Since
poetic images often compare the
ephemeral quality of human bodies to
that of clay pots, this action clearlyCuckoo
signifies the final destruction of the
body. The chief mourner then ignites the
pyre and remains there while the body
burns. If the skull does not crack from
the heat of the fire, he is given a long
bamboo stick to pierce the skull. This is
believed to release the vital winds
(prana) of the deceased, which have col-
lected in the head. The chief mourner’s
final duty is to collect bones and ash
from the pyre (asthi-sanchayana), often
on the following day, and to immerse
these remains in the Ganges or some
other sacred river (asthi-visarjana).
The wooden pyre is the traditional
means for cremation and remains the
preferred method, despite the develop-
ment of more efficient and cheaper elec-
tric crematoria. This has led to an
unusual ecological problem in modern
India, particularly in the big cities. Many
poor people cannot afford to buy
enough wood to cremate the body with
a pyre but, because of tradition, are
unwilling to use electric crematoria.
They will perform incomplete crema-
tions in which part of the body is left
unburned. This is a bad state of affairs,
both from a religious and a public health
perspective, because the bodies are a
source of religious impurity and con-
tribute to the contamination of the
rivers. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj
Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. For
accounts of modern practice, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; and Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988.
Cremation Ground
Literally a place where bodies are cre-
mated, but in Hindu culture it also has a
significant symbolic meaning. The cre-
mation ground is pervaded by associa-
tions with death and impurity
(ashaucha), making it an intensely
inauspicious place that is often believed
to be inhabited by malevolent wander-
ing spirits. The cremation ground is usu-
ally located at the boundary of a
community, both to remove any contact
with this source of inauspiciousness
from everyday life and perhaps to sym-
bolically deny the reality of death by rel-
egating the cremation ground to the
margins of the “settled” world.
One well-known exception to this
rule occurs in Benares, where the cre-
mation ground at Manikarnika Ghat is
in the middle of the city. This promi-
nence symbolically forces the inhabi-
tants to confront the reality of death, but
since Benares is also the home of the
god Shiva, it also raises the hope that
death will bring final liberation of the
soul (moksha). Similarly, although most
people avoid the cremation ground as
inauspicious, certain religious adepts
voluntarily choose it as their place of
residence and religious practice. This
may include certain types of ascetics
who are simply emulating terrifying
forms of Shiva who are said to reside in
cremation grounds. Practitioners of the
esoteric ritual tradition known as tantra
may live in a cremation ground to assert
the radical unity of all reality and tran-
scend the concepts of purity and impu-
rity, which they consider artificial. See
also cremation.
Cuckoo
(Cuculus melanoleucus or jacobinus)
Indian songbird intimately connected
with both love and the monsoon rains.
The cuckoo’s mating season comes dur-
ing the monsoon,when its piercing calls
are fancifully interpreted as piu, piu
(“beloved, beloved”). These cries are
said to excite the hearts of human
lovers—either to passion if they are
together or to bitter pain if the monsoon
is keeping them apart. The cuckoo’s
behavior in the rainy season is supposed
to reflect its love for the monsoon.
According to popular belief, the cuckoo
drinks only raindrops, which means that
for much of the year, it is tormented by
thirst. In devotional (bhakti) poetry, the
cuckoo is often used as a symbol for the
devotee (bhakta), who is tormented by
the deity’s absence but who waits

patiently for the divine presence. In
Sanskrit poetry this bird is called the
chataka; in modern dialects it is known
as the kokila or koil.
Cunningham, Sir Alexander
(1814–1893) First director of the
Archeological Survey of India and the
father of modern Indian archeology.
Cunningham first came to India in
[[1831]]
 as an officer in the Royal
Engineers, but his hobby was the study
of ancient India’s material artifacts.
This passion eventually resulted in the
formation of the A.S.I., which Cunningham
headed until his retirement in 1885. By
surveying sites, cataloging their con-
tents, and translating inscriptions, his
work was fundamental to preserving
India’s heritage.
Cuntarar
Tamil form of the name for the poet-
saint Sundaramurtti.
Curses
In Hindu mythology, one of the stan-
dard devices either to advance the
story’s plot or to account for some
inexorable event. Such curses are
often the work of sages and other spir-
itual adepts, but they can also be
levied by any person who has perfect-
ly fulfilled his or her social role, such
as a faithful wife, loving son, or devot-
ed parent. Making a curse expends the
spiritual powers that a person has
accumulated. At least in mythical
tales, such curses invariably come
true no matter what a person might do
to try to prevent them. For example, in a
mythic story, King Parikshit secludes
himself on a high pillar to escape
death by snakebite but is killed when
a divine serpent conceals itself as a
worm in a piece of fruit. Once pro-
nounced, a curse cannot be simply
nullified, although it can be modified
to blunt its overall effect. For a consid-
eration of the function of curses in
Indian mythology, see Robert Goldman,

## D
Dabistan-I-Mazahib
(“School of Manners”) An outside
source for the religious life of the times,
and gives the earliest detailed descrip-
tion of the Sikhs, as well as many other
contemporary religious communities.
The text traditionally is ascribed to
Muhsin Fani. Fani was a Persian who
traveled through much of northern
India, apparently motivated only by his
intense curiosity to encounter the
country’s different forms of religious
life. The text is also notable for the
seeming absence of authorial bias—
Fani reports that he had simply translated
what his friends and informants had
told him, and the Dabistan’s tone seems
to maintain this claim. The text has
been translated by David Shea and
Anthony Troyer as The Dabistan, or
School of Manners, 1843.
Dadhichi
A sage in Hindu mythology who is a par-
adigm for self-sacrifice. The gods
(devas) and the demons (supernatural
beings) are engaged in a long-running
war, in which neither side can prevail.
Indra, the king of the gods, finally
decides to seek advice from the god
Brahma. Brahma advises Indra that if
he obtains a bone from Dadhichi’s
body, it can be made into a weapon that
will defeat the demons. Indra is under-
standably uncertain that his request
will be granted, but when he appears
before Dadhichi, he not only gives his
consent, but immediately abandons
his body through yogic powers. Indra
takes Dadhichi’s bones, fashions a
weapon from them, and successfully
defeats the demons.
Dadhikra
A divine war horse described in a few of
the hymns in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts. The Vedas were
the religious hymns of a group known
as the Aryans, and hymns throughout
the Vedas clearly show the importance
of horse-drawn chariots as weapons of
war. Given this importance, it is not
surprising that one finds a divinized
horse in these hymns, even if it is only a
minor figure.
Dadu
(1554–1603) Sant poet-saint and
founder of the religious organization
known as the Dadupanth. The sants
were a group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who share several
general tendencies: a stress on individ-
ualized, interior religion leading to a
personal experience of the divine; dis-
dain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of the
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore
conventional caste (social order) dis-
tinctions. According to tradition, Dadu
was born into a family of cotton-
carders, a fairly low-status occupation.
He is also reported to have been born a
Muslim, although based on his poetry
he seems to have been relatively unaf-
fected by Islam. His songs highlight
many of the aforementioned sant
themes. His poems also stress nonvio-
lence (ahimsa), and as a practical appli-
cation of that principle, vegetarianism.
Another prominent theme is the reli-
gious value of work, since despite his
fame he is said to have carded cotton
until his death.
Some of Dadu’s poems give lists and
categories, as if systematizing his ideas
for instruction. This suggests that he
envisioned an established community
of disciples. According to legend, Dadu
met with the Moghul emperor Akbar,
who was so impressed by Dadu’s charis-
ma that he ceased his harming of living
beings. The tale is probably fictitious,
since there are similar stories for many
of the sant poets, which all illustrate the
[[163]]
Dadupanth
well-established theme of the temporal
ruler bowing to the spiritual adept. For
further information on traditional
sources, see Winand Callewaert (trans.),
The Hindi Biography of Dadu Dayal,
[[1988]]
. See also Moghul dynasty.
Dadupanth
Religious organization founded by the
sant poet-saint Dadu (1554–1603). The
Dadupanth is strongest in Rajasthan,
the desert state in which Dadu is
believed to have lived. The Dadupanth
stresses religious themes common to
the sant poet-saints: the rejection of rit-
ual and image worship in favor of an
internal search for a formless deity,
stress on the power of the divine Name,
and a belief in the relative unimpor-
tance of conventional caste distinc-
tions. It also emphasizes certain points
that were particularly important to
Dadu himself, among them nonvio-
lence (ahimsa), vegetarianism, and the
religious value of work. The Dadupanth
has always been a numerically small
organization, but they are historically
important because of their manuscript
collections. These collections are
known as the “five voices” (panchvani),
because they contain the works of five
different devotional (bhakti) poets:
Dadu, Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas, and
Hardas. Rajasthan’s desert climate has
helped to preserve these manuscripts,
some of which date from the early sev-
enteenth century. The Panchvani man-
uscripts are among the earliest sources
for all of these poets, which makes them
an important resource for the historical
study of northern Indian devotional
poetry. For further information on the
literary resources of the Dadupanth, see
Winand Callewaert (trans.), The
Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi Rajab, 1978;
and The Sarvangi of Gopaldas, 1993.
Dadupanthi Nagas
Particular group of Naga (fighting)
ascetics associated with the religious
community (panth) established by the
[[164]]

western Indian poet-saint Dadu. The
Nagas are renunciant ascetics orga-
nized into different akharas, or regi-
ments based on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers, although
they also had substantial trading inter-
ests; both of these have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times. In the
bathing (snana) processions at the
Kumbha Mela festivals (“Festivals of the
Pot”), the Dadupanthi Nagas march
with the chatuh-sampradayi Nagas,
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, but are considered indepen-
dent of them. According to tradition,
the Naga section of the Dadupanth was
established by Sundardasa, one of
Dadu’s direct disciples.
Daita
Tribal (adivasi) community in the mod-
ern state of Orissa. The Daitas are
hereditary temple servants at the tem-
ple of the god Jagannath in the city of
Puri. Jagannath has been brought into
the larger Hindu pantheon by identify-
ing him as a form of the god Krishna,
but he is originally believed to have
been a local, tribal deity. This history is
partly inferred from Jagannath’s rela-
tionships with the Daitas themselves,
who are considered Jagannath’s rela-
tives, even though their social status is
very low. This relational connection
gives the Daitas several unique roles.
During the annual Rath Yatra, a cere-
monial procession in which Jagannath,
his brother Balabhadra, and their sister
Subhadra are processed around the city
in giant wooden chariots, the Daitas
convey the deities’ giant wooden
images from the temples to the chariots
and pull the ropes that draw the carts.
An even more important role comes
when new images of the deities are con-
structed, usually every twelve or nine-
teen years. The Daitas carve the new
images, each from a single massive log.
When the new image has been completed,
the oldest Daita removes a wooden plugDaksha
in the old image that seals an interior
cavity. He then transfers a mysterious
substance called the “life substance” to
a corresponding cavity in the new
image, which is sealed with another
wooden plug. The Daita chosen to make
this transfer is blindfolded and has his
hands wrapped in layers of cloth, so he
is unable to tell exactly what is trans-
ferred, and this “life substance” is con-
sidered so sacred that the person who
makes this transfer reportedly dies soon
afterward. After the “life substance” has
been removed, the old image is consid-
ered a “corpse.” The Daitas bury it,
observe a ten-day period of ritual death
impurity (maranashaucha), and the
heirs of the deceased claim his “belong-
ings”—primarily clothes and resin,
which they sell to pilgrims. Jagannath’s
continuing relations with the Daitas
point to his origins as a local, tribal god,
and this relationship gives the Daitas
continuing special privileges.
Daiva Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty
(dharma). In a Daiva marriage the
father of the bride gives away his
daughter with her ornaments to a brah-
min (priest). The priest then officiates
at a sacrifice sponsored by the father.
According to some interpretations, the
girl is given as the dakshina, or fee for
these sacrificial services. This form of
marriage was named after the gods
(devas), and was one of the four
approved (prashasta) forms of mar-
riage. Even though a daiva marriage was
considered an approved form, it fell out
of favor because of the hint that the
bride had been given as a payment for
services, rather than without any condi-
tions whatsoever. See also Marriage,
eight classical forms.
Daksha
In Hindu mythology, one of the sons of
the god Brahma, and the father of the
Image of the Hindu god Daksha. His head was
replaced with the head of a goat as the result of a
conflict with the god Shiva.
goddess Sati. Sati has been given in
marriage to the god Shiva, and Daksha’s
most famous mythic story has to do with
this divine pair. According to legend,
when Daksha feels that Shiva has not
shown him proper respect, he wants to
put Shiva in his place—even though in
this mythic story Shiva is clearly identi-
fied as the supreme deity. Inflated with
pride, Daksha plans a great sacrifice to
which he invites all the other gods, but
as an insult purposely excludes Shiva.
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she
insists on going to it, despite Shiva’s
warning that it is unwise to go without
an invitation. When she arrives at the
sacrificial ground, and asks why her
husband has been excluded, Daksha
responds with a stream of abuse
denouncing Shiva as worthless and
despicable. Humiliated by these public
insults, Sati commits suicide—in some
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial
fire, in others by withdrawing into a
yogic trance and giving up her life. Shiva
becomes furious when he hears of Sati’s
death, and in his rage creates the fierce
deities Virabhadra and Bhadrakali. He
comes storming with his minions (gana)
to the sacrificial ground, destroys the
[[165]]
Dakshina
sacrifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.
Daksha is eventually restored to life, but
with the head of a goat rather than a
human being. He repents of his arro-
gance and worships Shiva as the highest
god. In this story, Daksha is a symbol for
the foolish pride that eventually causes
one’s destruction.
In another mythic story, Daksha is
portrayed in a more sympathetic light.
Chandra (the moon) has married
Daksha’s twenty-seven daughters, but
was paying attention to only one of the
daughters, named Rohini. Daksha
remonstrates with Chandra to give each
of his wives equal time, and when
Chandra ignores this advice, Daksha
curses him to lose his luster. As Chandra
begins to wane, the other gods intercede
with Daksha, and implore him to modify
the curse. At their urgent prompting,
Daksha decrees that Chandra will only
wane for half the month and then wax
for the other half. He then directs
Chandra to take a bath at the Somnath
temple in Gujarat state, which will heal
him from the original curse. Here
Daksha is still powerful and imperious,
but his actions are rooted in his concern
for his daughters.
Dakshina
(“preceptor’s fee”) Gifts or fees given to
one’s teacher in return for the services
rendered. The paradigm for this goes
back to the dharma literature, or the
texts on religious duty (dharma), which
propose an idealized doctrine for the
four stages (ashramas) of a man’s life.
The first of these stages is as a celibate
student (brahmacharin), in which the
young man will live in his teacher’s
household and commence studying the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
At the conclusion of his studies, the stu-
dent will give his teacher dakshina as a
sign of appreciation. In modern times
this pattern has been extended to other
contexts, particularly the arts, and it has
become customary for students to
give gifts to their teachers on various
occasions, particularly on the full moon
[[166]]

known as Guru Purnima, which usually
falls in June or July. Dakshina is always
given in exchange for services, and is
thus essentially payment that is “owed”
for these services. In this aspect it is a
very different mode of exchange from
dana (charitable giving). Dana gener-
ates religious merit, but the donor
receives nothing tangible in return.
Dakshinachara
(“right-hand practice”) In the secret ritual
tradition known as tantra, this is the
term for a type of tantric practice that
does not avail itself of any forbidden
substances or promote any behavior
that the orthodox would consider scan-
dalous or objectionable. It stands in
opposition to the vamachara, or “left-
hand practice,” which uses such forbid-
den substances in its ritual, and shows
no such regard for conventional sensi-
bilities. The most common forbidden
substances are the Five Forbidden
Things (panchamakara), so called
because they all begin with the letter
“m” (in the sacred language of Sanskrit,
makara) madya (wine), matsya (fish),
mamsa (meat), mudra (fermented or
parched grain), and maithuna (copula-
tion). In left-hand tantra these forbid-
den things are used in their actual
forms, whereas right-hand practitioners
substitute
other
more
socially
acceptable things for them. This is one
more instance of the pervasive Hindu
polarity between right and left, which
carries inherent value judgments. In this
case, the left-hand practitioners are
seen as impure and dangerous, because
they intentionally violate social bound-
aries, whereas the right-hand are
socially respectable. For further

Temple in Dakshineshwar dedicated to the goddess Kali.
Dakshinayana
The six months of the solar year in
which the sun is reckoned as moving
southward. In the Gregorian calendar,
this is the period between the summer
solstice and the winter solstice (roughly
December 20 to June 20) and is based on
the actual motion of the sun with
respect to the earth. The Indian reckon-
ing is based on the motion of the sun
through the zodiac, which is calculated
differently than in western astrology. The
Dakshinayana begins on Karka
Sankranti (the day the sun is thought to
enter Cancer, usually July 14), and ends
the day before Makara Sankranti (the
day the sun enters Capricorn, usually
January 14). The Dakshinayana is con-
sidered less auspicious than the
Uttarayana, the six months in which the
sun travels north, because the southern
direction is associated with the Yama,
the god associated with death, judg-
ment, and punishment for evildoers.
Dakshineshwar
Temple site about four miles north
of modern Calcutta, on the eastern bank
of the Hugli River. Dakshineshwar’s
[[167]]
Dalit
primary deity is the powerful and dan-
gerous goddess Kali, although like most
Hindu temples it also has images of
most of the deities in the pantheon.
Dakshineshwar’s importance comes not
from its age—the primary image was
consecrated in 1855, and it is thus a rel-
atively recent site—but through its
association with the Bengali saint
Ramakrishna, who lived there for most
of his life.
Dalit
(“oppressed”) Modern name for the
social groups that have the lowest social
status, groups that in earlier times
would have been called Harijan or
untouchable. This term is significant
because it is the name used by low-
status groups to designate themselves as
members of a disadvantaged group.
Adoption and popularization of this
term reflects their growing awareness of
the situation, and their greater assertive-
ness in demanding their legal and con-
stitutional rights. In certain parts of the
country, particularly in the state of
Maharashtra, the Dalits have formed a
militant organization called the Dalit
Panthers, modeled after the Black
Panthers in America.
Damaru
Hourglass-shaped hand drum, which
has membranes stretched over the top
and bottom of the hourglass, and at the
middle, two strings with a bead at the
end. The drum is played by holding it by
its narrow middle and rotating the hand
back and forth so that the beads strike
the drumheads. The pace of the rhythm
(tala) is determined by the speed of
hand movement. In Hindu iconography,
this drum is almost invariably associated
with the god Shiva. In his form as
Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance, the
drum signifies the rhythm by which
Shiva undertakes the creation of the
universe. Another iconic motif is to
show the damaru hanging from Shiva’s
trident. In modern times this drum is
[[168]]

often carried by ascetics, either because
of its association with Shiva, its portabil-
ity, or both. See also iconic image.
Damayanti
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of the
king of Vidarbha and the wife of King
Nala. The story of Nala and Damayanti
appears as a story within the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. It is recounted to the five
Pandava brothers, the epic’s protago-
nists, during a twelve-year exile in the
forest as a way to keep up their spirits by
telling how others had transcended
misfortune.
In the story, when Damayanti comes
of marriageable age, her father sends
invitations to the kings of the earth,
announcing her svayamvara, a rite in
which Damayanti will choose her own
husband. The kings of the earth come to
the svayamvara to seek her hand, as do
the gods (devas) themselves. Yet
Damayanti has already decided, with
the help of a swan who has praised King
Nala to her, to choose Nala. The gods try
to foil this by taking on physical bodies
identical to Nala, so that Damayanti will
not be able to tell the difference between
them. As a last resort, Damayanti makes
an act of truth, a ritual action whose
efficacy is based on the power of truth
itself. In her act of truth, Damayanti
declares that she has never loved any-
one but Nala, and directs the gods to
resume their true forms to prove that
this statement is true. The gods immedi-
ately do as she commands, compelled
by the power of truth. Nala and
Damayanti are married, and as a reward
for her fidelity the gods give Nala various
divine gifts. Hearing of the marriage, two
of the rejected suitors curse Nala to lose
his kingdom, and like all curses in
Indian mythology, this eventually comes
to pass. Because of the curse, Nala and
Damayanti are separated and suffer
long tribulations, including Nala having
his body magically changed so that no
one would be able to recognize him. In
the end Damayanti recognizes him byDance
his divine gifts, which could not be hid-
den, and the lovers are happily reunited.
Damodara
(dama “rope” + udara “waist”) Epithet of
the god Krishna, given in memory of a
particular incident in his childhood. In
an effort to curb Krishna’s mischief by
restricting his movements, Krishna’s fos-
ter mother, Yashoda, uses a rope to tie
her toddling boy to the heavy stone
mortar used in grinding grain. The mor-
tar’s weight is more than sufficient to
restrain any normal child, but for
Krishna it proves no hindrance, and he
proceeds to crawl about, dragging the
mortar after him. At one point the mor-
tar becomes wedged between two trees
growing closely together, and Krishna
pulls so hard that the trees are uprooted.
After the trees fall to the ground, they
immediately disappear, and in their
place stand two young men. These are
sons of the god Kubera who have been
cursed to take the form of a tree until
Krishna comes to save them.
Dampati
(“husband and wife”) In Indian art and
architecture, the figure of a married
couple. These are usually portrayed as
standing next to one another and are
usually devoid of any sexual connota-
tion. This is unlike the more famous
mithuna figures, which are engaged in
sexual activity.
Dana
(“giving”) Charitable giving. This is a
common religious practice, for it is
believed to be a pious act that generates
religious merit. Dana is especially preva-
lent at pilgrimage places and other
sacred sites (tirthas), since the sacred-
ness of these places is believed to mag-
nify the consequences of any act,
whether good or bad. Dana is one of the
traditional paradigms for exchange, the
other being dakshina (preceptor’s fee).
The difference between them is that
dakshina is a fee for services, whereas
dana is given freely and brings one no
tangible benefits. Aside from the intan-
gible religious merit generated by
dana, it is also a common way to get rid
of any inauspiciousness or ill fortune,
which is transferred to the receiver
along with the gift. This assumption
makes receiving dana karmically risky,
whereas there are no such stigmas
associated with dakshina. People who
live solely by receiving gifts, such as
beggars at pilgrimage sites, are thus in
an unenviable position, since they are
commonly described as “vessels”
(patras) for the depositing of ill for-
tune. Yet this transfer of inauspicious-
ness is a pervasive pattern in regular
society, and even within the family there
are means to transfer inauspiciousness
through well-established gift-giving pat-
terns, particularly the kanyadan, or gift
of a bride in marriage. For further infor-
mation on dana and gift-giving patterns,
see Gloria Goodwin Raheja, The Poison
in the Gift, 1988.
Danava
(“descendants of Danu”) In Hindu
mythology, the sons of Danu with her
husband, the divine sage Kashyapa.
Kashyapa is the chief of the Prajapatis, a
class of semi-divine beings, and Danu
herself is the daughter of the demigod
Daksha, so their children have divine
blood from both sides of their lineage.
The name Danava is a general term for
all the families of demons (supernatural
beings), or more properly, asuras. The
asuras are powerful divine beings, who
have legitimate interests of their own,
but whose interests often run counter to
those of human beings as well as those
of the gods (devas). Asuras are thus usu-
ally opposed to the gods—a sense of
opposition carried by the English word
“demon”—but they are not perceived as
inherently evil.
Dance
In traditional Hindu culture, all of the per-
forming arts had intimate connections
[[169]]
Dance
Dancers performing in the Manipuri style.
with religious life, and dance was no
exception to this pattern. In their art,
dancers merely follow the divine model,
since in Indian mythology Shiva is the pre-
eminent dancer; indeed, in his dancing he
first creates the universe and later destroys
it. Several classical dance forms can be
directly tied to specific Hindu temples. The
Bharatanatyam form developed in the
temples of Tamil Nadu beginning at the
Brhadeshvar temple in Tanjore, and is
immortalized in the sculptures of the Shiva
temple at Chidambaram. The Orissi style
came from the temple of Jagannath in the
city of Puri, on the Bay of Bengal. Some of
the other classical styles were traditionally
performed only in temples, or had their
beginnings in religious festivals: the
Kathakali form in the state of Kerala, the
Kuchipudi form in Andhra Pradesh, the
Chau form in eastern India, and the
Manipuri form in Manipur. The only
exception is the northern Indian Kathak
form, whose birth and performance lay in
a court rather than a temple setting, but
which in its subject matter often treated
religious themes, particularly ones drawn
from devotion to the god Krishna.
All of these styles share a highly artic-
ulated language of gesture (mudra) and
expression, through which the dancer
can tell a story to the audience. As in all
the classical arts, the dancer’s aim is not
only to entertain, but to create and con-
vey a particular aesthetic mood (rasa),
[[170]]

which will evoke a corresponding emo-
tion (bhava) from the audience. Beyond
these general similarities, each form has
a certain characteristic and stylistic
quality. Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and
Orissi are the most clearly related forms,
but where Bharatanatyam presents a
sharply geometric line, with a stiff upper
body, the lines presented by Kuchipudi
and Orissi are progressively softer,
rounder, and more fluid. Kathakali is
characterized by elaborate costumes
and stage makeup, and also by its partic-
ular stress on developing and control-
ling facial mobility. These things
facilitate ease and power of expression.
Manipuri and Chau are both highly
athletic forms, clearly showing the
influence of folk dance, and Chau is
unusual in that the dancers always
wear masks, which sets a prevailing
mood. Kathak is the only dance form in
which the legs are kept straight; this
form stresses intricate footwork in
which the bells on the dancer’s ankles
serve as a complement and counter-
point to the drum, combined with dra-
matic turns and spins.
As mentioned above, all the dance
forms except for Kathak developed in
some sort of religious context. In many
of these latter cases, dance was an offer-
ing presented to the deity, and was
primarily performed for the deity’s
entertainment, although the otherDandaniti
spectators could enjoy it, as well.
Although different schools have differ-
ent typologies, the most pervasive dis-
tinction is between “pure” dance
(nrtya), conveying nothing beyond the
dancer’s skill in movement, and “acting”
dance (natya or abhinaya), in which the
dancer tells some sort of story. Until the
twentieth century, the dancers were
usually temple servants known as
devadasis. The devadasis were officially
married to the temple’s deity and per-
formed various ritual services in the
temples as his “wives,” but they could
have liaisons with other men as they
wished. Any children from these liaisons
would also be in the service of the tem-
ple—their sons as musicians, and their
daughters as dancers. At times this
arrangement degenerated into common
prostitution, but in many cases it was
recognizably different. These women
had status and property of their own,
even though their status was unusual,
and thus marginal. In the twentieth cen-
tury the dance performance site has
moved from the temple to the stage,
which has had a number of effects on
transforming it from a form of worship
to a performing art. For further informa-
tion on the history of the dance and its
particular manifestations, see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984. For a masterful analysis of
the devadasis, see Frederique Apffel
Marglin, Wives of the God-King, 1985.
Danda
(“stick”) A symbol of authority in tradi-
tional Hindu culture. On one hand, this
stick referred to royal authority and was
visibly evident as a scepter or mace, but
was considered emblematic of the king’s
obligation to maintain social order by
inflicting punishment on evildoers. This
rule through punishment (dandaniti)
was the king’s role and duty in traditional
Indian ideas of kingship, for without
such rule normal social life would be
impossible. In a different context, the
staff can be a symbol of ascetic
authority. Among the Dashanami
Sanyasis, a group of ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, the
ascetics with the highest status carry a
staff as a sign of their authority, and are
known as Dandi Sanyasis.
Danda Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the arm and hand are extended
straight forward, like a stick (danda).
Dandakaranya
A particular forest (aranya) in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics. This is where the god
Rama, the epic’s protagonist; his wife
Sita; and his brother Lakshmana live
during the latter part of their fourteen
years in exile, in their ashram (abode) in
the village of Panchavati. Many of the
epic’s pivotal events take place in this
forest: Rama and Lakshmana’s humilia-
tion and mutilation of the demoness
Shurpanakha, their destruction of the
demon army led by her brothers Khara
and Dushana, and Sita’s abduction
by Shurpanakha’s third brother
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. The
Dandaka forest’s actual location is
uncertain, since many of the events in
the Ramayana cannot be set in any
particular place. One traditional
location for Panchavati, however, is just
outside of the city of Nasik in the state
of Maharashtra.
Dandaniti
(“rule through the stick”) In the dharma
literature, or the texts on religious duty
(dharma), dandaniti is the preservation
of social order by inflicting punishment
on evildoers. This rule through punish-
ment was the king’s role and duty in tra-
ditional Indian ideas of kingship, for
without such rule it was believed that
normal social life would be impossible.
[[171]]
Dandasana
Dandasana
(“staff-posture”) One of the sitting pos-
tures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras (aphorisms on
yoga). In this position, the upper body is
erect, the arms are straight with the
hands flat on the ground and pointing
forward, and the legs are outstretched
with the big toes, ankles, and knees
touching one another.
Dandavat (“stick-like”) Pranam
Type of reverential salutation in which
the person lies prostrate on the ground
with the arms extended (hence the com-
parison between the body and a stick).
This shows the highest reverence of all
greetings, since one’s entire body is in
contact with the ground.
Dandi Sanyasi
Among the Dashanami Sanyasis, or the
ascetic devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, the Dandi Sanyasis are the
most prestigious of the three general
ascetic types; the others being the
Paramahamsa and the Naga Sanyasis.
Dandi Sanyasis take their name from the
staff (danda) that they are given at their
ascetic initiation and that they carry for
the rest of their lives as a sign of ascetic
restraint. The danda is always kept off
the ground to maintain its purity. The
Dandi Sanyasis tend to put the highest
stress on the importance of Sanskrit
(sacred language) learning and uphold
the traditional social and cultural values
it propounds. Of the ten Dashanami
divisions, Dandis tend to belong to
those divisions that will only initiate
brahmins—that is, the Saraswati,
Ashrama, and Tirtha divisions, and also
some sections of the Bharati division. In
many cases, Dandi Sanyasis are initiated
as ascetics only after having completed
the other three stages of life (ashra-
mas), fulfilling the idealized pattern in
the dharma literature, the texts on reli-
gious duty. Thus, their ascetic status
does not come only from the strictness
of their ascetic observance, for which
[[172]]

they are rightly famous. It also reflects
the continuing influence of their former
“worldly” status, which was supposedly
left behind upon ascetic initiation, and
their adherence to traditional idealized
cultural patterns. The philosopher
Shankaracharya, traditionally named
as the Dashanami order’s founder, was
himself believed to be a Dandi Sanyasi.
This pattern of leadership still
continues, since even now Dandi
Sanyasis are invariably chosen for the
Shankaracharyas, the religious leaders
who preside over the four monastic cen-
ters (maths). These centers supposedly
were established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, and in many cases
these present leaders have been lifelong
ascetics, as Shankaracharya is believed
to have been. For further information
see Dana Sawyer, “Monastic Structure of
Banarsi Dandi Sadhus,” in Bradley R.
Hertel and Cynthia Ann Humes (eds.),
Living Banaras, 1993.
Dan Lila
One of the types of divine play (lila)
between the god Krishna and his devo-
tees (bhakta). In this lila, the adolescent
Krishna intercepts the gopis, his cow-
herding female friends, who are on their
way to the city of Mathura to sell their
butter and curds. Krishna refuses to let
them pass until they give him some as a
gift (dana). The story of this lila is often
presented in religiously oriented theatri-
cal presentations, which are themselves
known as lilas (“plays”), since their func-
tion is to reveal the work of the divine.
This lila is but one instance in a long his-
tory of butter thievery. For further infor-
mation see John Stratton Hawley,
Krishna: The Butter Thief, 1983.
Dantavaktra
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Dantavaktra is
an asura or demon king who is the
rebirth of Vijaya, one of the gatekeep-
ers of the god Vishnu. Vijaya has been
cursed to be reborn three times as anDashanami
asura and to be killed each time by
Vishnu. In his previous incarnations
Vijaya is born as Hiranyakashipu,
who is killed by the Man-Lion avatar
(one incarnation of the god Vishnu)
and as Kumbhakarna, who is killed by
Vishnu’s Rama avatar. When Dantavaktra
is killed by Krishna, the curse is broken,
and Vijaya returns to his rightful place.
Darshan
(“seeing”) By far the most common reli-
gious act in popular modern Hinduism,
darshan designates direct eye contact
between the devotee (bhakta) and the
image of a deity, which is considered to
be a conscious, perceiving being. Such
intimate interaction is a way to commu-
nicate with the deity on a personal basis,
which is similar to the stress on the indi-
vidual found in bhakti (devotional) reli-
giosity. For further information see
Diana Eck, Darsan, 1985.
Darshan
(2) (“perspective”) In the context of
Indian philosophy, this is the word most
often used to designate a philosophical
“school.” The word itself comes from the
verb “to see,” and thus can be loosely
translated as a “point of view,” “perspec-
tive,” or “[way of] seeing.” In a diverse
and competitive philosophical culture,
this is a neutral way to describe a philo-
sophical position, whether or not one
agrees with it.
Dasa (“servant”) Bhava
The second of the five modes of devo-
tion (system of devotion to a deity) to
God that were most prominently
articulated by Rupa Goswami, a devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Krishna and a
follower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used differing types of human
relationships as models for differing
conceptions of the link between deity
and devotee. These five modes
showed growing emotional intensity,
from the peaceful (shanta) sense that
comes from realizing one’s complete
identity with Brahman, or Ultimate
Reality, to conceiving of God as one’s
master, friend, child, or lover. The
Dasa Bhava is the second of these, in
which devotees considered them-
selves as servants and the deity as
their master. This second mode of
devotion should be understood in
light of the relationship between mas-
ters and servants in Indian society,
which goes far beyond that of employ-
er and employee in modern American
society. A family’s servants will often
stay with a family for many years and
in some cases, such service becomes
hereditary. Longtime servants become
virtual members of the family; they
are respected, trusted, and sometimes
regarded as advisers.
Dashamukha
(“ten-faced”) In the Ramayana, the ear-
lier of the two great Indian epics, this
was one of the epithets of Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. This name is
descriptive, since Ravana has ten heads.
Dashanami
(“ten names”) Collective name for the
ten divisions among the Sanyasis, an
ascetic order supposedly founded by
the great philosopher Shankaracharya,
whose members are devotees of the
god Shiva. These ten divisions are each
distinguished by a different name,
which is taken as a surname by
an ascetic after his initiation in the
division. These ten names are Giri
(“mountain”), Parvata (“mountain”),
Sagara (“ocean”), Saraswati (the god-
dess of learning), Bharati (“India”), Puri
(“city”), Aranya (“forest”), Vana (“for-
est”), Tirtha (“crossing-place”), and
Ashrama (“hermitage”).
Although all of the ten divisions are
Dashanami Sanyasis, there are internal
status differences based on the distinc-
tion between three ascetic classes:
Dandi, Paramahamsa, and Naga. The
Dandi Sanyasis, named for the staff
(danda) that they must always carry,
[[173]]
Dasharatha
have the strongest connection with clas-
sical Sanskrit (sacred language) learn-
ing, are the strictest in their ascetic
practices, and tend to be the most con-
servative in their social views. Dandi
Sanyasis often follow ascetic initiation
only after having completed the other
three stages of life (ashramas), and thus
fulfill the idealized pattern in the dharma
literature, the texts on religious duty.
Dandi Sanyasis were virtually always
brahmins (priests) before becoming
ascetics, and almost all Dandis belong to
the Dashanami divisions that will only
initiate brahmins—that is, the Saraswati,
Ashrama, Tirtha, and some sections of
the Bharati divisions. The remaining
Dashanami divisions will admit mem-
bers from all four of the traditional
social classes: brahmins, kshatriyas,
vaishyas, and shudras. Members from
the first three groups, known as “twice-
born” because they are eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth,” are initiated as
Paramahamsa Sanyasis, whereas shu-
dras are initiated as Naga, or militant
ascetics. Thus, despite the supposed loss
of identity among ascetics after formally
“renouncing” the world, one can see the
continuing influence of a person’s for-
mer worldly status.
These ten divisions are collected into
four larger organizational groups:
Anandawara, Bhogawara, Bhuriwara,
and Kitawara. Each of these groups has
two or three of the ten Dashanami
orders, and each is centered in one of
the four sacred centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya.
Each of these four groups is also associ-
ated with one of the four Vedas—the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, a different
geographical quarter of India, a different
“great utterance” (mahavakya), and a
different ascetic quality.
Dasharatha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Dasharatha is a king
of the Ikshvaku dynasty and the father
of Rama, the epic’s protagonist.
[[174]]

Dasharatha is generally portrayed as a
good king, but like many characters in
Indian mythology, his ultimate destiny
is governed by the result of a curse,
whose effects he is unable to avoid. As a
young man, Dasharatha is very fond of
hunting. On one occasion, he blindly
sends an arrow to the spot where he
hears the sound of an animal drinking
at a stream. When he investigates, he is
horrified to discover a young man struck
by his arrow, with the water pot he had
been filling by his side. With his dying
breaths the young man informs
Dasharatha that he is the sole source of
support for his blind parents and com-
mands Dasharatha to inform them of
his death. Dasharatha is a man of honor
and fulfills the boy’s last request. When
the boy’s father hears the story, he angri-
ly curses Dasharatha to die in similar
grief, bereft of his sons.
For many years it seemed as if this
curse would not come true, since
Dasharatha had no sons, even though
he had three wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi,
and Sumitra. Dasharatha sponsors vari-
ous religious rites for the birth of sons,
and finally commissions the sage
Rishyashringa to perform a great sacri-
fice. At the rite’s conclusion, a shining
figure emerges from the sacrificial fire,
places a pot of milk-rice before
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to
his wives. Dasharatha divides the con-
tents of the pot between Kausalya and
Kaikeyi, each of whom give some to
Sumitra. In due time Kausalya bears
Rama, Kaikeyi gives birth to Bharata,
and Sumitra (by virtue of receiving a
share from each of her co-wives) bears
the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
As his sons grow into manhood
Dasharatha is blissfully happy, and the
memory of the curse fades from his
mind. As a young man, Rama shows his
prowess and goodness, and Dasharatha
decides to anoint him as the heir-
apparent. Yet the night before this cere-
mony, the curse finally comes to
fruition. During the preparations pre-
ceding Rama’s investiture, the mind of
his stepmother Kaikeyi has been slowlyDashavatara Stotra
poisoned by the whisperings of her
maid Manthara. Manthara convinces
Kaikeyi that she and her son Bharata will
be mere slaves after Rama is crowned
the heir-apparent. This prompts Kaikeyi
to take drastic action. Many years
before, Dasharatha promised Kaikeyi
two blessings as reward for her help in
winning a great battle. She has never
asked for these, but she now requests
that Rama spend fourteen years in forest
exile, and that her own son, Bharata,
shall rule in his place. Dasharatha
pleads with Kaikeyi to change her mind,
but she is adamant that her wishes have
to be granted if Dasharatha will retain
the unbroken family honor. Dasharatha
later pleads with Rama to disobey him
and take over the kingdom by force, but
Rama refuses this as it is an unrighteous
action. Rama leaves for the forest, thus
upholding the family honor, but in his
sorrow at being separated from Rama,
Dasharatha dies of a broken heart.
Dashavatar
(“ten descents”) Collective name for the
ten avatars (incarnations on earth) of
the god Vishnu. In each case, Vishnu
takes form to restore the cosmic equilib-
rium when it has been thrown out of
balance by the action of a particular
demon. See also avatar.
Dashavatara Stotra
(“Hymn to the Ten Avatars”) The open-
ing canto of the Gitagovinda, a twelfth-
century lyric poem written by the poet
Jayadeva. The Gitagovinda is an allegory
of the union of the human soul with the
divine, described through the story of
the god Krishna and his human lover
Radha. At the narrative level, this tale
describes the couple’s initial passionate
lovemaking, followed by jealousy, anger,
and estrangement. It concludes with
their reconciliation and an even more
passionate reunion.
Although it is preceded by a short
introduction, the Dashavatara Stotra
is the text’s true beginning. The
The Dashavatara Stotra is the opening song
in the Gitagovinda, a twelfth-century
lyrical poem that tells the story of the god
Krishna and his human lover Radha.
Dashavatara Stotra is a hymn paying
homage to the ten avatars or earthly
incarnations of the god Krishna, each
of whom has been responsible for pre-
serving the cosmos in a time of crisis.
Jayadeva uses this opening hymn to
remind his readers that the Krishna of
his story is no mere mortal lover—
even though the story employs the
language and images commonly
found in Sanskrit love poetry—but
rather the lord and master of the uni-
verse, who has saved it from destruc-
tion again and again. The context
supplied by the images in this opening
hymn alert the reader that this text is
not merely a love story.
Jayadeva is unusual in describing the
god Krishna as the source of the ten
avatars, since Krishna is more commonly
considered an avatar of the god Vishnu.
This theological difference stems from
Jayadeva’s connection with the
Jagannath temple in the city of Puri.
Jagannath is said to be a form of
Krishna, but it is generally accepted that
[[175]]
Dasyu
[[176]]

Jagannath was originally an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity who hap-
pened to be Puri’s local deity. Identifying
him with Krishna was a way to assimi-
late Jagannath into the Hindu pantheon.
For Jayadeva, Jagannath-Krishna is thus
the supreme deity, not an avatar, and the
place usually occupied by Krishna in
Jayadeva’s enumeration of the avatars is
taken by Krishna’s brother, Balarama.

the Dark Lord, 1977.group of people speak Brahui, which is a
member of the Dravidian language fam-
ily. This Brahui-speaking community is
entirely surrounded by people speaking
Indo-Aryan languages, and the simplest
theory for this anomaly is that these
Brahui speakers are an isolated linguis-
tic fragment of that earlier time. These
theories are intriguing, but it is naive to
read the Vedas as an objective historical
account, or even to assume that any of
its references correspond to events out-
side the sacred world to which they were
the key.
DasyuDattatreya
(“slave”) The name used for non-Aryan
peoples in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
sacred texts. The words Aryan and
Dasyu are an “us” and “them” opposi-
tion—in essence, the people who com-
posed the Vedas called themselves
Aryans, and referred to the “outsiders”
as Dasyus. Although one cannot be cer-
tain whether these names refer to a par-
ticular group of people, or any group of
all, one theory is that the Aryans were a
people who had migrated from outside
of India, and the Dasyus were the
indigenous people in northern India.
The Vedas describe the Dasyus as living
in fortified cities, some of which were
destroyed by the god Indra. Some read-
ers have interpreted this image as the
Aryans’ destruction of the Indus Valley
cities, but there is little historical record
for such spectacular conquests.
Other hymns in the Vedas describe
the Dasyus as dark-skinned and nose-
less, which is generally taken to mean
flat-nosed. This has led some to identify
the Dasyus with the Dravidian language
speakers who now live in southern
India, since some of them share these
characteristics. According to this belief,
the Dravidian language speakers would
have been gradually displaced toward
the south as the Indo-Aryan language
speakers—in short, the Aryans—came
into India from the north. One piece of
linguistic evidence for this comes from
modern Pakistan, in which a smallIn the religious texts known as the
puranas, Dattatreya is a famous ascetic
and is considered to be a partial avatar
(incarnation) of the god Vishnu. Many
modern ascetics consider him a para-
digm for asceticism, and Dattatreya has
actually been installed as a deity in cer-
tain places associated with ascetics,
such as Mount Girnar. Dattatreya’s
mother is Anasuya, and he is born after
she has done a great favor to the gods.
According to the story, a faithful wife
named Silavati curses the sun not to
rise, and in consequence the creatures
of the earth are greatly troubled.
Anasuya succeeds in persuading Silavati
to recall her curse, and in their grati-
tude, the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and
Shiva inform her that she may ask for
whatever she wants. Anasuya requests
that each be born as one of her sons,
and this is granted: Vishnu is born as
Dattatreya, Shiva as Durvasas, and
Brahma as Chandra.
Datura
(from Sanskrit word dhattura) Name for
a genus of plants known as the thorn-
apple, which is a distant relative of the
potato. The datura plant contains poiso-
nous alkaloids, which when consumed
in small quantities produce intoxica-
tion, and in larger quantities, sickness
and death. Devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva eat the datura plant’s swollenDaughters
Seed of the datura, or thorn-apple.
Devotees of the god Shiva eat the
intoxicating seedpods, which can be lethal
if consumed in large amounts.
seedpods as intoxicants, in imitation of
their patron divinity’s narcotic revels.
Needless to say, because of its danger,
datura must be consumed with great
care, and under the direction of some-
one who knows its nature.
Daughters
The status of female children varies
widely in Hindu society, based on
regional customs, the position of the
social subgroup (jati/caste) to which a
family belongs, and the particular cir-
cumstances of individual families. In
general, although the birth of a daugh-
ter is a welcome event, it brings greater
responsibility than the birth of a son.
Parents have a religious duty to arrange
a daughter’s marriage, and this is still
taken very seriously, since her marriage
is seen as the key to her continued mate-
rial prosperity, as well as her fulfillment
as a human being. The gift of a daughter
(kanyadan) in marriage brings the par-
ents immense religious merit, but also
an onerous economic obligation.
Arranging a marriage in modern India
usually involves considerable time,
anxiety, and expense. The last comes not
only from the expenses of the wedding
ceremonies, but also from the practice
of giving a dowry (gift to the groom’s
family) with the bride, which is still quite
common. In many poor families, the
birth of multiple daughters is often seen
as a disaster, since their families will be
unable to marry them properly.
Aside from the expense and trouble,
in many parts of India daughters are
often seen as “temporary” members of
their natal families. After their marriages
they will live in their marital homes and
become part of their marital families,
whereas their brothers will bring their
brides into their natal home and will live
there for the rest of their lives. It is upon
these sons and their wives that the par-
ents will depend for support in their old
age, as well as for the performance of
ancestral rites after their deaths. This is
the traditional pattern throughout
much of India; although as the forces of
modernity have changed the joint family,
it has become more common for hus-
bands and wives to live separately from
their parents. This pattern also shows
considerable local variation. For exam-
ple, because the brahmin community in
southern India is so small, cross-cousin
marriage is fairly common there, and in
this circumstance a woman is actually
moving from one branch of her family
to another.
These economic and social factors
have sometimes led to unfortunate con-
sequences. Consciously or uncon-
sciously, one often finds that sons are
favored over daughters in many signifi-
cant ways: in their access to education;
in their opportunities, which are
deemed more important for men
because of their need to support a family;
in Hindu inheritance laws (in which
sons get a much larger share, under the
presumption that they will be support-
ing a family); and in poorer families, in
which sons are favored for even more
basic needs such as food and access to
medical care. Despite these general pat-
terns, it must be emphasized that many
families treat all their children with
[[177]]
Day, Structure of
equal love and care. This is particularly
true in contemporary times, and given
the trend toward smaller families, the
birth of a daughter is cause for just as
much rejoicing as the birth of a son. See
also arranged marriage.
Day, Structure of
In some sense, most divisions of time
are arbitrary, which is a feature that
appears in several different dimensions
of the traditional Indian divisions of the
day. The twenty-four hours of the solar
day can be divided using several differ-
ent measures of time, some of which do
not exactly correspond with one another,
and these differing times can also be
subject to judgments about their sym-
bolic values. In one system, the day is
divided into eight equal periods (pra-
hars) of three hours each. These eight
periods mark the general progress dur-
ing the day and night, with the first of
these prahars ending at sunrise. Shorter
units of time are reckoned in periods of
about twenty-four minutes called
ghatikas, of which there are sixty in
every twenty-four hours. The ghatika
supposedly takes its name from the clay
pots (ghata) that were used to make
water-clocks; these pots measured time
by the amount of water that dripped
through a small hole. Two ghatikas make
a muhurta, of which there are thirty
during each twenty-four hours. The
reckonings of the day in prahars and
ghatikas thus do not exactly correspond
to one another, since each prahar has
[[7]]
.5 ghatikas. Based on this, it would
seem that the former marks the more
general divisions of each day and the
latter more specific time periods.
The other way in which the times of
day can be viewed is with regard to their
symbolic value. The most auspicious
time of day is the “Time of Brahma”
(Brahma muhurta), the period immedi-
ately before sunrise. This is reckoned the
best time of the entire day for worship,
meditation, or any type of religious
practice. Although this is named a
muhurta, and thus should be limited to
[[178]]

forty-eight minutes, the Brahma muhurta
is often thought to encompass the entire
three hours in the day’s first prahar.
Hence, it is not unusual for devout
religious people to arise around 3 A.M.,
to take advantage of this period. In con-
trast, the immediately preceding prahar
(roughly midnight to 3 A.M.) is the most
inauspicious in the day, a time when
spirits and demons are loose. Sleep is
the most appropriate activity for this
time; other activities are appropriate
only when absolutely necessary. The
only time religious practices are done
during this time is when they are part of
an all-night ceremony (jagaran), or a
continuous reading (akhand path) of a
religious text. In following the most
inauspicious and chaotic period with
the most auspicious, the cycle of the day
(as well as the year) mirrors that of the
cosmos, whose gradual and continuing
degeneration are suddenly replaced
with complete renewal and regeneration.

Dayabhaga
(“division of inheritance”) Pivotal legal
text, written by the Bengali scholar
Jimutavahana (early twelfth century).
As its name would indicate, the
Dayabhaga was concerned with matters
of inheritance, partition, and the divi-
sion of property, and it eventually
became the primary legal code for the
entire Bengal cultural region. The inher-
itance pattern in the Dayabhaga stresses
succession, which is very different from
the predominant Hindu pattern of sur-
vivorship. Survivorship vests all surviv-
ing males in the male line with equal
shares of the family property, but gives
no inheritance to women. Under this
arrangement, the death of a male heir
automatically increases the share of all
the other surviving males, whereas their
share decreases when another male is
born. Under the succession model in the
Dayabhaga, sons do not become share-
holders of the family property at birth,
but upon the death of their father. If a
son happens to die before his father, theDayanand Saraswati
son’s heirs (including his wife and
daughters) become inheritors, not in
their own right, but as representatives of
the deceased heir. Under the Dayabhaga,
widows and daughters can thus have a
share in family property, and they are
allowed to act as agents in their own
right. In theory this arrangement seems
far more advantageous to women, but
in fact it had some gruesome conse-
quences. When the British first settled
in Bengal in the late eighteenth centu-
ry, they were horrified by the preva-
lence of sati, the rite in which a widow
would be burned on her husband’s
funeral pyre. It seems that sati was not
nearly so common in many other parts
of India, and one theory is that this rite
was the family’s way to ensure that
their daughter-in-law—who was an
outsider to the family—would not be
able to gain control over any of their
ancestral property.
Dayanand Saraswati
(1824–1883) Nineteenth-century reformist
ascetic and founder of the Arya Samaj, a
reformist Hindu organization. The late
nineteenth century was an era of
sweeping social, economic, and
religious change in northern India, and
the Arya Samaj was an authentically
Hindu response to these forces.
Dayanand’s mission for the Arya Samaj
was to reform and revitalize Hinduism
by purging it of the “false practices” that
had gradually crept in. Swami
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption
was that ultimate religious authority lay
only in the ancient scriptures called the
Vedas, and that any contemporary
religious practices not found in the
Vedas were mistaken, odious, and
deserved to be abandoned. This stance
allowed him to attack many of the
“social evils” plaguing nineteenth-
century Hinduism, such as child
marriages, sati (the rite in which a
widow would be burned on her
husband’s funeral pyre), “idolatrous”
image worship, untouchability, a ban
on widow remarriage, and the unequal
status of women. In claiming that such
practices were “corrupt,” Dayanand had
found not only a viable strategy for
reform, but a way to undercut the claims
of Christian missionaries, who pointed
to such evils as evidence that Hindu reli-
gion was inferior to Christianity.
Unlike its predecessor, the Brahmo
Samaj, which was heavily influenced by
Christianity, the Arya Samaj was a Hindu
response drawing from purely Hindu
sources. Dayanand belonged to the first
generation of Hindus aiming to reassert
the greatness of Hinduism as opposed
to the Christian missionary challenge,
and much of his writing is militantly
anti-Christian. One sign of his crusading
spirit is his support for the ceremony of
purification (shuddhi), through which
Hindus who had become members of
other religious communities were received
back into the Hindu community.
Although the Arya Samaj claimed that
they were simply getting back to the
Veda, the ultimate aim was not to
reclaim that long-gone era, but to
develop a form of Hindu religious life
more compatible with “modern” times.
Thus, even though Dayanand was “tra-
ditionalist” in his emphasis on the
Vedas, he was radical in insisting that
the Vedas should be accessible to all
people, including groups such as
women and the shudras, or the lowest
social group, both of whom had tradi-
tionally been forbidden to read or even
hear it. During his ministry Dayanand
spoke throughout India, attacking any
and all religions not rooted in the Vedas,
including contemporary Hinduism. His
eloquence, charisma, and commitment
brought him considerable success, but
also many enemies, and he was eventu-
ally assassinated by poisoning. For fur-
ther information see Dayanand

Day of Brahma
Day of Brahma
The Day of Brahma, or kalpa, is the
largest generally accepted measure of
time in Indian cosmology, and spans
[[432]]
 million years. This time period is the
ultimate limit for the existence of the
created world, although within it the
universe undergoes periodic renewals.
At the conclusion of the Day of Brahma
comes the universal dissolution (pralaya),
in which the created universe is com-
pletely destroyed and reabsorbed into
Vishnu. The Day of Brahma is followed
by a night of equal length, during
which the only living thing is the god
Vishnu, who sleeps on the back of his
serpent couch, Shesha, and floats on
the surface of the cosmic ocean. When
the Night of Brahma is ended, a lotus
sprouts forth from Vishnu’s navel,
which opens to reveal the god Brahma,
and with the new Day of Brahma the
universe begins anew.
The Day of Brahma can be divided
into smaller units based on two different
methods. One of these divides the Day
of Brahma into fourteen equal ages, in
which each age is identified by the par-
ticular divine sovereign (Manu) who
rules during that age. Another divides
the Day of Brahma into one thousand
mahayugas, each of which has four con-
stituent yugas (units of cosmic time),
each shorter than the last. See also
Cosmic Time.
Deathbed Rites
General term for the rites done for a
dying person. These rites have a twofold
purpose: to purify the person’s body,
and, more importantly, to calm the
mind. The first is generally done by
applying holy substances, such as
Ganges water or a Tulsi leaf. In some
cases, the dying person will also hold the
tail of a cow, since according to popular
mythology this will enable the person to
cross the Vaitarani River, the river lead-
ing to the afterlife. The emphasis on
calming the dying person’s mind comes
from the belief that one’s dying thoughts
have enormous karmic ramifications for
[[180]]

future lives. Ideally, the dying person
should be calm and composed, since
any sort of fear or agitation is believed to
have negative consequences. One
method to help promote such calmness
is to read passages from religious texts,
whether to remind the hearer of the
body’s impermanence, or to have the
last thing one hears be the name of God.
At the moment of death the dying per-
son is often placed on the earth—per-
haps so that the earth can absorb the
impurity (ashaucha) of the corpse, or
perhaps as a symbol that whatever a
person’s status in life, all human beings
eventually share the same fate. After
death the rites associated with crema-
tion begin, which are the next set of rites
in the series known as the antyeshthi
samskara (“last rites”).
Death Rites
See antyeshthi samskara.
Deccan
A region of the Indian subcontinent. In
its broadest usage, this word can refer to
all of India south of the Vindhya
Mountains, the range that divides
northern and southern India. More
specifically, this term denotes the dry
and hilly plateau in the northern and
eastern parts of the region south of the
Vindhyas, bounded on the east and west
by the highlands known as the Eastern
and Western Ghats. In Hindu cultural
terms, the Deccan is a transitional cul-
tural area between the northern Indian
plain and the deep south.
Deer
In Hindu iconography, an animal
strongly associated with the god Shiva,
particularly in his form as Pashupati,
the “Lord of Beasts.” In many of the four-
armed images of Shiva, one of the upper
arms will have the figure of the deer
emerging from it, symbolizing his con-
trol over all life. In Hindu bhakti (devo-
tional) poetry, the musk deer is often
used as a symbol for an ignorant,Demons
unenlightened person. According to this
image, just as the deer does not recog-
nize that the heady scent of musk comes
from its own body, but rushes all over
the forest in search of it, so are human
beings ignorant of God inside and ever
close to them, but looking outside them-
selves in search of the divine.
Dehu
Town in the Pune district of Maharashtra
state, sixty-five miles east and south of
Bombay. It is most famous as the
home of the poet-saint Tukaram, one
of most important figures in the
Varkari Panth. The Varkaris are a reli-
gious community centered around the
worship of the Hindu god Vithoba, at
his temple at Pandharpur in modern
Maharashtra. Varkari religious practice
centers primarily around two annual
pilgrimages in which all the partici-
pants arrive in Pandharpur on the
same day. Tukaram still symbolically
travels to Pandharpur twice each year;
a palanquin (palkhi) bearing his san-
dals is at the head of the procession
bearing his name.
Deities
This is a word with various possible
meanings in different contexts. On one
hand, it can refer to the gods (devas).
These are beings who live in one of the
heavenly realms, by virtue of their past
good karma (actions), but who are still
subject to the law of karma and who
therefore must someday be reborn in a
lower state. This word can also refer to
the Supreme Reality, which can best be
designated as “God,” although the
Hindu imagination has given it various
names: Brahman, the Goddess, Vishnu,
Shiva, Ganesh, and a host of other
deities in the pantheon, including vil-
lage deities.
Demons
another. The most prominent conflict is
between the suras (“gods”) and another
class of divine beings called asuras
(“not-gods”). Aside from the asuras,
there are other powerful beings such as
rakshasas, pisacas, and vetalas, which
have greater or lesser malevolence
toward the gods and human beings. The
English word most often used to denote
all these divine adversaries is the word
“demon.” Although this is a convenient
label and avoids the need for unfamiliar
Sanskrit terminology, it also carries
inappropriate and misleading associa-
tions. The word “demon” carries conno-
tations of absolute and radical evil, as
well as willful opposition to a single
supreme divinity. Neither assumption is
appropriate in the Hindu mythic uni-
verse, which is polytheistic, or believing
in more than one god. This polytheistic
universe has a host of divine beings,
whose individual interests may well
conflict with those of the gods, and
whose mutual opposition may spill over
into open war. This does not make such
opponents, or “demons,” inherently evil,
but rather the opponents of the Hindu
gods, from whose perspective Hindu
mythology is clearly recounted. These
“demons” may also be ill-disposed
toward humans, but they are not neces-
sarily or inherently so. Perhaps the
clearest recognition of their status is that
despite their occasional opposition to
the gods, they are never completely
destroyed, but simply demoted to a
more appropriate status. For example,
when the “demon” Hiranyakashipu is
destroyed by Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar,
he is succeeded by his son Prahlada. In
the same way, after the god Rama kills
Ravana, the “demon” king of Lanka,
Rama appoints as successor Ravana’s
brother Vibhishana. Asuras and other
supernormal beings thus have a legiti-
mate place in the Hindu mythic world,
and as long as they do not overreach
themselves and throw the world into
imbalance, they are allowed to remain.
The Hindu mythic universe has various
classes of supernatural beings, some of
which are perpetually at odds with one
[[181]]
Deogarh
Deogarh
Small town in the extreme southern part
of the state of Uttar Pradesh, seventy
miles south of the city Jhansi, in a part of
Uttar Pradesh almost completely
enclosed by the state of Madhya
Pradesh. It is famous as the site for one
of the few surviving temples from the
Gupta dynasty, a fifth-century temple
dedicated to Vishnu as the Dashavatar
(“Ten Incarnations”). The temple itself is
a masonry cube about twenty feet on
each side, topped by a ruined tower that
would have originally been about forty
feet high. In its modest size and square
construction, this temple shows little
resemblance to the Hindu temples of a
later age. However, it prefigures later
architecture in its magnificent carvings:
in the images carved in panels on the
side walls, around the temple’s single
door, and on friezes at the top of the
walls. The portrayal of the divine figures
in these carvings is identical to that
done centuries later, which indicates
that the images used to represent these
deities were already fixed at the time the
temple was built.
Deoghar
(“God’s home”) Sacred site (tirtha) in
the southeastern corner of the modern
state of Bihar, about 130 miles south-
east of the city of Patna. Deoghar is
famous throughout India as the site for a
temple to the god Shiva, in his form as
Vaidyanath, the “Lord of Physicians.”
Vaidyanath is one of the twelve jyotir-
lingas, a group of sacred sites deemed
especially holy to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is believed to be uniquely present.
Deoghar hosts an enormous religious
gathering on the festival of Shivaratri
(February—March) and during the
lunar month of Shravan (July—August),
both of which are times deemed partic-
ularly sacred to Shiva. On both occa-
sions, pilgrims draw water from the
Ganges at Sultanganj, more than sixty
miles from Deoghar, and then walk
to Deoghar to present the water as
an offering to Shiva. This particular
[[182]]

observance combines devotion to God
with the willingness to suffer hardship; it
is often performed to fulfill a vow made
when asking for some divine favor. As in
many Hindu holy places, pilgrim traffic
peaks at Deoghar at certain festival
times and at other times of the year
drops off to almost nothing.
Deoras, Balasaheb
(1915–1996) Third sarsanghchalak
(“Supreme Leader”) of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a conserva-
tive Hindu organization whose express
purpose is to provide the leadership
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The
RSS is a highly autocratic organization
that lays great stress on obedience to
authority, thus the sarsanghchalak
wields virtually complete power over it.
During Deoras’s tenure from 1973 to
[[1994]]
, he took a much more activist
stance than his predecessor, M.S.
Golwalkar, particularly in promoting
the growth of the RSS’s affiliate organiza-
tions, in giving the RSS an orientation to
social service, and in actively seeking to
recruit members and establish shakhas
(branches) in all parts of the country. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; Tapan
Basu et al., Khaki Shorts and Saffron
Flags, 1993; and Christophe Jaffrelot,
The Hindu Nationalist Movement in
India, 1996.
Deshastha
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
had a monopoly. This sort of differentia-
tion applied even to brahmins, whose
role has been to serve as priests, schol-
ars, and teachers. The Deshastha brah-
min jati is a subset of the Maharashtri
brahmins, who were themselves one of
the five southern brahmin communitiesDevadasi
(Pancha Dravida). The core region for
the Deshastha brahmins is in the
Deccan region in Maharashtra, whereas
the other major subcommunity, the
Chitpavan or Konkanastha, is found on
the coast.
Deshnok
Small village in the Bikaner district in
the state of Rajasthan, roughly twenty
miles south of the city of Bikaner.
Deshnok is famous for the temple to the
goddess Karni Mata, in which thou-
sands of rats have been given sacred sta-
tus and are treated as deities, in the
belief that they are Karni Mata’s sons.
Deul
(probably a form of deva , “deity”) In
the temple architecture of the state of
Orissa, this is the name for the bee-
hive-shaped tower under which the
image of the temple’s primary deity
resides. Unlike the architecture in
other parts of northern India, in which
a series of towers (shikharas) gradually
led up to the tallest tower, Orissan tem-
ples tend to have a fairly long and low
entrance porch (jagamohans) and an
extremely high deul, with this differ-
ence in visual forms accentuating the
contrast between the two.
Deva
The word deva literally means “shining
one,” although the most common (and
often most appropriate) translation is
“god.” This word is an epithet for any
superhuman being, although it can also
be used figuratively for any person of
high status, such as a king or a brahmin
(priest). The notion of “gods” in
Hinduism must be understood in
light of the generally assumed context
of reincarnation (samsara), which
assumes that a person can be reborn in
many different realms of reality. Some of
these are realms of punishment where
people atone for the effects of their bad
karma, while others are realms of plea-
sure (the heavens) where people enjoy
the results of their good karma. The
devas are the inhabitants of these heav-
ens, and are thus “gods,” since gods, by
definition, live in heaven.
Yet all these gods are still subject to
the vicissitudes of reincarnation—even
Indra, the ruler of heaven. Birth in
heaven is based on one’s good karma,
which is inevitably diminished by enjoy-
ing the rewards of life in heaven, just as
a savings account is depleted by contin-
uing withdrawals. When their good
karma has been exhausted, even the
gods are subject to rebirth in other
realms. So even though these gods are
superhuman, they are still subject to the
law of reincarnation. There is thus a
qualitative difference between these
gods (the devas) and the so-called Great
gods, such as Vishnu, Shiva, and the
Goddess. These latter deities are seen by
their devotees (bhakta) as totally out-
side the realm of space, time, and the
causes and effects of karma, and thus
correspond more directly to the Judeo-
Christian notion of “God,” as the ulti-
mate power in the universe.
Devadasi
(“[female] servant of the lord”) Name for
a class of women kept in temples as
singers and dancers in the service of the
temple’s presiding deity, to whom they
were usually considered to be “married.”
Their special status prevented them
from marrying human husbands,
although in many cases they would form
long-term liaisons with prominent local
men. Any daughters born from such
liaisons would in turn be dedicated to
the temple, while sons would be trained
as musicians. In many cases, devadasis
had unusual legal rights, such as the
ability to own, manage, and transfer
property, which for most women were
vested only in their husbands. At best,
these devadasis were literate and cul-
tured women, whose talents brought
them considerable status, while at worst
(as was often the case in the nineteenth
century) they were prostitutes whose
services enriched the temple. The latter
[[183]]
Devaki
situation prompted the British to for-
mally ban this practice, despite their
general reluctance to interfere in Hindu
religious affairs.
Devaki
In Hindu mythology, the god Krishna’s
mother. Krishna is considered the
eighth avatar (incarnation) of the god
Vishnu, and like all of the avatars, he
comes down to earth to restore the cos-
mic balance by destroying the forces of
evil that are upsetting it. Devaki is the
niece of King Kamsa, the evil king of
Mathura, and on the day she is married
a heavenly voice proclaims that her
eighth child will kill Kamsa. Kamsa seeks
to destroy this prophecy by imprisoning
Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva,
killing each of their children as they are
born. Devaki’s seventh child is magically
transferred to the womb of her co-wife,
Rohini, and is born as Balarama.
At the birth of the eighth child,
Krishna, the locked gates magically
open, and a deep sleep falls over all the
guards, allowing Vasudeva to spirit the
infant child to his foster parents, Nanda
and Yashoda.
Devanagari
Name for the most common northern
Indian script, in which the sacred
Sanskrit, modern Hindi, and Marathi
languages are commonly written to this
day. It is a descendant of the ancient
Brahmi script, and from it developed
the scripts used for the modern Bengali,
Gujarati, Oriya, and Punjabi languages.
Its most characteristic feature is that the
top element of most letters is a horizon-
tal line, which, when the letters are writ-
ten together, causes the letters to
“hang,” like laundry from a clothesline.
Its name literally means “[script of the]
city of the gods,” and according to one
theory, it was given this name because it
was developed in Benares, one of the
holiest cities in India.
[[184]]

Devapratishtha
(“establishing the deity”) Rite by which
the image of a deity is established in a
temple and consecrated for worship.
The image itself must be constructed
according to carefully defined sculptural
and artistic canons that date back to the
early centuries of the common era, as
the sculptures at the Deogarh temple
clearly show. The image, temple site,
and the performers must be purified
before the rite begins, and this purity
must be maintained throughout the
entire rite—which can last for days—to
ensure that the image remains pure. All
parts in the transmission and physical
installation of the image are carefully
done, but the climactic rite is the
pranapratishtha, in which the image is
infused with the breath of life and
becomes the seat for the deity. After this
point, the image is considered to be rit-
ually “alive,” and must receive regular
worship and ministrations.
Devaprayag
(“divine confluence”) Sacred town
(tirtha) in the northern part of the state
of Uttar Pradesh, in the Himalaya
Mountains about sixty miles up the
Ganges from the city of Haridwar.
Devaprayag is sacred because it is at the
confluence of the Bhagirathi and
Alakananda rivers, the largest Himalayan
tributaries of the Ganges. Devaprayag is
the final such river confluence in the
Himalayas, and it is at this confluence
that the Ganges is definitively formed as
one indivisible sacred stream.
Devar
In the northern Indian joint family, the
term designating a husband’s younger
brother. The traditional Indian joint
family is headed by a husband and wife.
The couple’s sons, the sons’ wives, and
unmarried daughters live with them.
The married daughters live with their
husbands’ joint families. The joint family
is not just a group of people living
together. The good of the family is givenDevasena
higher value than any individual’s
desires. Traditional Indian society was
highly status-conscious, a trait reflected
not only in the traditional hierarchical
conception of society, but also in similar
conceptions within the family. Based on
these assumptions, there are different
words for all sorts of relationships in the
Indian family. These words are based
partly on a person’s age in relation to the
speaker, whether he is related by blood
or by marriage, and whether blood rela-
tives come from the mother’s or the
father’s side of the family. Since a
woman’s devar is younger than her hus-
band, he is considered a person of less
exalted status, and thus someone with
whom she may have a more familiar
“joking relationship.”
Devara Dasimayya
Tenth-century devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva, who was much admired by
Basavanna and the other Lingayat lead-
ers. According to tradition Dasimayya
earned his living as a weaver, but spent
most of his energies propagating the
worship of Shiva. He encountered
particular opposition from the Jains
and the Vaishnavas, about which there
are many miraculous tales, but he
also served as a missionary to jungle
tribes. For further information see
A. K. Ramanujan (trans.), Speaking of
Siva, 1973.
Devaram
Name for the collected hymns of the
poet-saints Appar, Sambandar, and
Sundaramurtti. These were the most
important of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three Shaiva poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and ninth centuries. Along with their
Vaishnava counterparts, the Alvars, the
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization
of Hindu religion versus the Buddhists
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the
Alvars stressed passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god—Shiva for
the Nayanars, Vishnu for the Alvars—
The town of Devaprayag. It is considered sacred
because it lies at the confluence of the Bhagirathi
and Alakananda Rivers, the two largest tributaries
of the Ganges in the Himalayas.
and conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
Appar and Sambandar were the first of
the Nayanars, and Sundaramurtti was
the last. Although the hymns in the
Devaram are devotional, they form the
basis for the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, and are
thus considered the holiest of the Tamil
Shaivite texts. The hymns are also
marked by opposition and hostility
to non-Hindu traditions, particularly
the Jains, with whom the Nayanars
were apparently contesting for influence
and patronage.
Devasena
In southern Indian mythological tradi-
tion, Devasena is the wife of the god
Skanda, in his southern Indian form as
Murugan. Following the pan-Indian
custom
of
arranged marriage,
Devasena is given in marriage to Skanda
by Indra (king of the gods) and the other
[[185]]
Devayajna
Hindu gods. After his marriage,
Skanda contracts a “love-marriage”
with the tribal girl Valli. Skanda’s two
wives thus symbolize both sides of his
identity—Valli bears witness to his
connection with the land, and his ulti-
mate roots as a tribal deity, while
Devasena shows his assimilation into
the larger Hindu pantheon.
Devayajna
(“sacrifice to the gods”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahaya-
jna) that is prescribed in the texts on
religious duty (dharma literature).
These Five Great Sacrifices are pre-
scribed daily religious observances for
a “twice-born” householder, that is, a
householder who has been born into
one of the three twice-born groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya,
or vaishya—and who has received the
adolescent religious initiation known
as the “second birth.” Each of the five
sacrifices (yajna) is directed toward a
different class of beings—from the
Absolute Reality down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions.
The devayajna is directed toward the
gods and is satisfied by homa, the
offerings of clarified butter into the
sacred fire. In the time since these
texts were composed, Hindu life has
undergone significant changes, and
since most Hindu homes no longer
maintain a sacred fire, this particular
rite has been largely omitted.
Devimahatmya
(“Greatness of the Goddess”) The
earliest and most important mythic
source for the cult of the Goddess as
the supreme divine power. The
Devimahatmya is itself a section of a
larger Sanskrit (sacred language) text,
the Markandeya Purana, and is gener-
ally accepted to have been composed in
the Narmada River region in the fifth or
sixth century. The Devimahatmya is
most notable for its assertion that God is
female. This notion has no clear source
[[186]]

in the earlier Hindu tradition, in which
female deities exist but are insignificant.
This conviction must have existed at
some level, because it emerges fully
developed in the Devimahatmya, and
the idea must have spent some time
developing before its full fruition in
this text.
The Devimahatmya itself is a text of
[[700]]
 verses, hence its other common
name, the Durgasaptashati (“700 verses
to Durga”). The text begins with a frame
story, in which a king and a merchant,
each beset by worldly trials, seek refuge
in the peace of the forest. There they
meet a sage, who listens to each of their
stories, and explains that all of their
troubles are due to Mahamaya (an epi-
thet of the Goddess). This is an epithet
for the Goddess as the wielder of illu-
sion, who is the sole power behind the
universe. When pressed for further
details, the sage tells three mythic sto-
ries, each describing the salvific activity
of the Goddess. These three tales form
the bulk of the text and the basis for the
worship of the Goddess.
The first story retells the myth of the
demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who are
born from the god Vishnu’s earwax dur-
ing the period of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). As the creation of the world
begins anew, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel. It opens to reveal the cre-
ator-god Brahma, who is immediately
menaced by Madhu and Kaitabha. The
story of these two demons also appears
in the mythology connected with
Vishnu, but there are significant differ-
ences in this version. In all versions of
the myth, Brahma appeals for help, and
Vishnu eventually slays the demons. But
in the Devimahatmya, Brahma’s hymn
of praise is to the Goddess, who in her
form as Yoganidra (“sleep of yoga”) has
lulled Vishnu into a cosmic stupor,
rendering him unable to come to
Brahma’s aid. Pleased by Brahma’s
praise, the Goddess withdraws her
influence over Vishnu, he awakens and
slays the demons.
The second story centers around the
buffalo-demon Mahishasura, who is soDevshayani Ekadashi
powerful that none of the gods can con-
quer him. One day, when the gods are
recounting their defeats at the demon’s
hands, each of the gods begin to give off
a great radiance. This radiance collects
into a single glowing mass, and from it
the figure of the Goddess emerges. This
myth portrays the Goddess as the con-
centrated essence of all the gods, and
thus superior to any one of them. This
motif is accentuated by each of the gods
giving her a copy of their weapons, so
that symbolically she wields all of their
divine powers. The Goddess takes up
arms against Mahishasura and his army,
and after a terrifying battle, slays him.
The third story also portrays the
Goddess as a warrior-queen. In this
episode, she fights and destroys the
demon armies of Shumbha and
Nishumbha, along with their minions
Chanda, Munda, and Raktabija. This
story is notable for the first appearance of
the fierce goddess Kali, who springs forth
from the forehead of the Goddess as her
anger personified. Kali helps the Goddess
to defeat the demon armies by stuffing
them into her mouth and consuming
them. Kali is also instrumental in destroy-
ing the demon Raktabija, who has been
granted the wish that whenever a drop of
his blood falls to the ground, it will be
transformed into another full-sized copy
of himself. This makes him impossible to
kill by conventional means. Kali is able to
thwart this special power by drinking
Raktabija’s blood before it reaches the
ground. As with the second book, this
story has extended descriptions of
battlefield carnage.
All of these stories describe the
Goddess as the supreme divine power,
far superior to the male gods in the pan-
theon. The frame story ends with an
extended hymn of praise to the
Goddess, and descriptions of the bene-
fits gained from her worship. Both the
king and the merchant begin to wor-
ship her, and after three years both are
granted their desires. The king asks for a
larger and unconquerable kingdom,
alluding to the Goddess’s power to
bestow worldly wishes. The merchant,
however, requests final liberation, show-
ing his awareness of her power over illu-
sion, and the ultimate spiritual goal. For
further information see Thomas B.
Coburn, Devi Mahatmya, 1984.
Devotee
See bhakta.
Devotthayan Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Kartik (October–
November). This is celebrated as the day
on which the god Vishnu awakens from
his four-month slumber, having fallen
asleep on Devshayani Ekadashi
(“eleventh day festival”) in Ashadh
(June–July). When Vishnu has arisen
from sleep, the ritually dangerous
chaturmas (“four-month”) period is
over, and auspicious life-cycle rites such
as weddings and the sacred thread cere-
mony (“adolescent initiation”) may be
performed again.
Devshayani Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Ashadh (June-July).
This is celebrated as the day on which
the god Vishnu falls asleep on his ser-
pent couch Shesha, and remains sleep-
ing for four lunar months, waking up on
Devotthayan Ekadashi. This four-
month period (chaturmas) is consid-
ered unlucky and ritually dangerous,
since it is a period when the god is con-
sidered to be insensible. Weddings are
generally not performed during this
period, nor is any other life-cycle rite
that can be postponed. This festival
coincides with the advent of the rainy
season, and the ambivalence connected
with the rains can be seen here. On one
hand, the rains are essential to the
crops, and thus foster life and fertility.
On the other hand, the rains also bring
all too real dangers from snakes, scorpi-
ons, and gastrointestinal infections.
[[187]]
Dhanga
Dhanga
(d. 1003) A monarch in the Chandella
dynasty, most famous for committing
religious suicide by drowning himself
at Allahabad, at the confluence of the
Ganges and Yamuna rivers. The
inscription that records this event
mentions that Dhanga did this at the
end of his life—when he had lived
more than one hundred years—while
meditating on the god Rudra, a form of
Shiva, and further notes that by com-
mitting suicide Dhanga gained final
liberation of the soul (moksha). This
description clearly shows that religious
suicide was a highly structured reli-
gious act, the object of which was to
help the performer die in a calm and
composed state of mind, ideally with
one’s last thoughts focused on a deity.
A crucial element in this ritual was the
statement of purpose (samkalpa), in
which the performer would state the
benefit desired from his performance.
Dhanga’s statement of purpose is
almost certainly the basis for his asser-
tion that he attained final liberation,
since this claim is not verifiable in any
other way.
Dhangar
The model for traditional Indian society
was a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
had a monopoly. In traditional central
Indian society, the Dhangars were a
Hindu jati whose hereditary occupation
was herding sheep and goats. They
are particularly associated with the state
of Maharashtra.
Dhanus
[[188]]

(“bow”) In Hindu iconography, the bow
is a weapon associated with several
Hindu deities. It has strong mythic asso-
ciations with the god Shiva, who in one
of his mythic exploits destroys the Three
Cities (tripura) with a single arrow. It is
also commonly associated with the god
Rama, whose unfailing arrows slay
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka.
Aside from these, it is also one of the
weapons commonly carried by power-
ful forms of the Goddess, such as
Durga. The reason for this can be
found in her charter myth in the
Devimahatmya, in which the Goddess
is formed from the collected radiance
of all the gods and receives duplicates
of all their weapons.
Dhanvantari
In Hindu mythology, Dhanvantari is
the physician of the gods and is cred-
ited as the founder of ayurveda, a tra-
ditional system of Indian medicine.
Dhanvantari is born when the gods
and demons (supernatural beings)
churn the Ocean of Milk to produce
the nectar of immortality. In the
course of their churning, many pre-
cious things are produced, including
the goddess Lakshmi, the wishing-cow
Kamadhenu, and the Kaustubha jewel.
As the churning reaches its climax,
Dhanvantari himself emerges from the
ocean bearing the pot of amrta, the
nectar of immortality that has been
the ultimate product of the whole
endeavor. See also Tortoise avatar.
Dharamshala
(“abode of dharma”) A no-frills rest
house for pilgrims. Dharamshalas
were often built by pious donors (this
was endowed as a religious act), to
provide pilgrims not only with a basic
place to stay during their pilgrimage,
but also a place with a wholesome
religious atmosphere. The facilities at
a dharamshala are generally quite
basic, and well below the standard set
by a hotel—in many cases it is a nearly
bare room in which the pilgrims cook,
eat, and sleep, often on their own bed-
ding. Until well into the twentieth
century, pilgrims were under no oblig-
ation to pay anything for staying,
although on departing they were
expected to leave a donation accord-
ing to their means and inclination. InDharma
most cases dharamshalas now have set
rates for lodging, but they are always
cheaper than hotels since the ameni-
ties tend to be less. There is also a
marked difference in their general
atmosphere and clientele. Most
dharamshalas still strive to promote
and maintain a wholesome religious
atmosphere: by having a temple in the
building; by holding worship in the
morning, evening, and on special occa-
sions; and by sponsoring scriptural
readings, lectures, and other religious
activities. These activities help to create
a religious community, and those who
are seeking this during their journey
will strive to stay in such places.
Dharana
(“concentration”) In the ashtanga yoga
(system of religious discipline) first cod-
ified by the philosopher Patanjali, dha-
rana is the sixth of the eight elements of
yoga practice. Along with dhyana and
samadhi, dharana is one of the three
parts known as the “inner discipline”
(samyama), the culmination of yogic
training. Dharana is described as stead-
fastness of mind. It is the ability to focus
on any object, whether a part of the
body or an external object, and to keep
the mind steadily focused there. This is
training for one’s mind and one’s aware-
ness and is an essential prerequisite for
focused meditation.
Dharma
One of the four purusharthas, or aims
of life, the others being artha (wealth,
power, and prosperity), kama (desire),
and moksha (liberation). The concept of
dharma is so fundamental to Hindu
culture that it cannot be adequately
translated by any single English word—
possible translations are “religious law,”
“religious duty,” “duty,” “religion,” “law,”
or “social order.” The root meaning for
the word dharma comes from a verb
meaning “to support” or “to uphold.”
Dharma is thus that which supports or
upholds society, which shows why all
Kama, the god of desire. He is one of many gods
who carry a dhanus, or bow. The five different
arrows in Kama’s arsenal each produce a different
emotion in the people they strike.
the aforementioned translations could
make sense in context. Dharma pro-
vides the overall regulatory framework
for life in the world and gives a sense of
ultimate purpose to keep one’s life in
balance. Although Hindu culture sanc-
tions the pursuit of both power (artha)
and pleasure (kama), it is always
assumed that both of these will be regu-
lated by an underlying commitment to
dharma, to keep one’s life integrated and
balanced.
The dharma literature, primarily the
Dharma Sutras (aphorisms on religious
duty) and Dharma Shastras (treatises
on religious duty), was largely con-
cerned with laying down guidelines for
an organized and orderly society, and
these guidelines take into account many
possible factors. Although these texts
spoke of an eternal (sanatana) dharma,
and of certain common duties (sadha-
rana dharma) incumbent on all human
beings, the most important thing for any
person was one’s personal dharma
(svadharma). One’s svadharma provided
a well-defined social status and role,
based on one’s social status (varna),
stage of life (ashrama), and gender (the
[[189]]
Dharma
particular dharma for women was strid-
harma). These texts were almost cer-
tainly composed by brahmin (priests)
men, and reveal everything about how
these men thought things should be, but
are far less reliable with regard to actual
social practices. The men who com-
posed this literature presupposed an
unequal society, in which birth into
high or low status groups was deter-
mined by the nature of one’s karma
(actions), whether good, bad, or mixed.
Although various groups had unequal
status, they were all necessary for soci-
ety to function harmoniously, and true
virtue lay in meticulously fulfilling one’s
prescribed social role. Doing so faithfully
was not only a source of religious merit,
but if one did one’s obligations dispas-
sionately from a sense of duty, it was
also described as one of the three paths
for liberation of the soul, the path of
Action (karmamarga). For further infor-
mation see Pandurang Vaman Kane
(trans.), A History of Dharmasastra,
[[1968]]
; and K. S. Mathur, “Hindu Values of
Life: Karma and Dharma,” in T. N.
Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Dharma
(2) A deity, seen as the personification of
dharma as religious duty. In the
Mahabharata, the latter of the two great
Hindu epics, the five Pandava brothers,
who are the epic’s protagonists, all have
divine fathers, and the eldest brother
Yudhishthira is the son of Dharma.
Yudhishthira and his brothers belong
to a kingly (kshatriya) family, but
Yudhishthira himself shows great con-
cern for truth, righteousness, and com-
passion. None of these are proverbial
kshatriya qualities, which tend to stress
courage and martial valor, and
Yudhishthira’s qualities are usually
explained by invoking the influence of
his divine father. A different sort of
Dharma cult arose in medieval Bengal,
from the commingling of Buddhist,
Muslim, and Hindu ideas. In this cult
Dharma was worshiped as the formless
single supreme Lord (probably reflecting
[[190]]

the influence of Islam), but the worship
of Dharma contained many similarities
with Bengali Hindu rituals. For further
information see Shashibhushan B.
Dasgupta, Obscure Religious Cults, 1962.
Dharma Literature
Many texts are explicitly or implicitly
concerned with the question of dharma,
or religious duty. These begin with the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu sacred texts,
which are believed to articulate the eter-
nal (sanatana) dharma. The first major
texts explicitly devoted to dharma are
the Dharma Sutras, texts written in an
aphoristic (sutra) style between the sev-
enth and second centuries B.C.E. At least
in theory, the Dharma Sutras were all
connected with particular schools of the
Veda, and were thus primarily intended
as a manual for behavior for members of
that school alone. The Dharma Sutras
were followed by the Dharma Shastras,
in which the material in the Dharma
Sutras was expanded and put into verse;
these latter texts included instructions
for all members of society and were thus
intended to be “legal” in their import.
Among the earliest was the Manava
Dharma Shastra (Manu Smrti), which
was composed around the turn of the
common era. The process of rethinking
and expanding this legal tradition
through commentary has continued
until present times, although the most
significant works were completed by the
sixteenth century.
Dharmaputra
(“son of Dharma”) One of the epithets
of Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers. The Pandavas are
the protagonists in the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics.
In the epic, Yudhishthira and his broth-
ers are the sons of various deities,
magically born when their mothers use
the power of a mantra (sacred sound).
Yudhishthira’s father is the god
Dharma, the guardian of righteous-
ness. His paternity is used to explainDharma Sutras
Yudhishthira’s concern with truth and
righteousness, which are defining
qualities in his character. These are
not usually considered to be kingly
(kshatriya) values, which stress courage
and martial valor.
Dharmaraja
(“King of Righteousness”) Colloquial
name for Yama, god of death and pre-
siding deity of the underworld. Yama is
responsible for judging and punishing
the dead, and this threat of punishment,
at least in popular belief, makes people
avoid committing evil. This name is also
one of the epithets of Yudhishthira, the
eldest of the five Pandava brothers,
since his father is the god Dharma, the
guardian of righteousness.
Dharmashastra
A general term to denote the study of
dharma (religious duty), whether refer-
ring specifically to the actual texts
(Dharma Shastras), or the treatises on
religious duty or more generally to the
extensive commentary-like literature on
these texts. Although the Dharma
Shastras are generally believed to have
been written between the second
century B.C.E. and the early centuries of
the common era, this literature contin-
ued to be written until modern times.
The literature detailed views on legal
matters, such as crime and punishment,
civil law, contracts, and rules of evi-
dence. It also concerned matters of
social order. The most extensive catalog
of all these sources is a five-volume set
by Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968.
Dharma Shastras
(“Treatises on Dharma”) In its most par-
ticular sense, this word refers to a partic-
ular set of Sanskrit texts. These texts
were explicitly written to give guidelines
for the organization of society, and for
correct human behavior in that society.
The Dharma Shastras were written soon
after the Dharma Sutras (aphorisms on
religious duty) and are clearly modeled
on them, but have several important dif-
ferences. With regard to form, the
Dharma Sutras are written in prose,
whereas the Dharma Shastras are writ-
ten in simple verse. The language of the
Dharma Shastras is close to classical
Sanskrit, and the writers were trying to
make their texts clear and easy to under-
stand. In their content, the Dharma
Shastras treat the same general subjects
as the Dharma Sutras, but they place
far more emphasis on working out
the practical details of a social life,
particularly the duties and functions of
the king.
The final difference is their connec-
tion with the earlier Vedic literature. The
Dharma Sutras were conceived as the
final element of a Kalpa Sutra (complete
handbook of religious practice), along
with the Shrauta Sutras (prescriptions
for Vedic rituals) and the Grhya Sutras
(prescriptions for domestic rites). Each
Kalpa Sutra was associated with one of
the Vedas (the oldest sacred Hindu
texts), and thus the “family property” of
the particular brahmins (priests) con-
nected with that Veda. A particular
Dharma Sutra was thus associated with
a particular group of brahmins, and was
primarily intended as a manual for their
behavior. In contrast, the Dharma
Shastras purported to lay down rules for
all members of society. They show little
concern for ritual matters, and no con-
nection with any particular Vedic
school, but rather profess to lay down
universal truths. In keeping with this
emphasis, the surviving Dharma
Shastras are all attributed to mythical
sages—Manu,
Yajnavalkya,
and
Narada—whereas the Dharma Sutras
are given human authorship. The
Dharma Shastras thus mark the study of
dharma (dharmashastra) as a discipline
distinct from the earlier Vedic literature,
and applied to society as a whole.
Dharma Sutras
(“aphorisms on dharma”) The earliest
texts specifically devoted to dharma—
[[191]]
Dharna
rules of conduct for various social
groups, moral duties, rights, and obliga-
tions. These were composed as collec-
tions of aphorisms, some so brief that
they virtually presuppose commentary,
and were written between the seventh
and second century B.C.E. According to
theory, the Dharma Sutras were the third
and final part of a Kalpa Sutra (com-
plete handbook of religious practice),
which would also contain prescriptions
for Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras) and
domestic rites (Grhya Sutras). Each
Kalpa Sutra was theoretically connected
with one of the four Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, and was thus the
“family property” of the brahmins
(priests) connected with that Veda. A
particular Dharma Sutra was associated
with a particular group of brahmins and
was primarily intended as a manual for
their behavior.
The real picture is far more complex,
since more than twenty collections of
Dharma Sutras have been identified,
although the most important are attrib-
uted to sages and writers Apastamba,
Gautama, Vasishtha, Baudhayana, and
the god Vishnu. These Dharma Sutras
were an attempt to provide an ordered
way of life by delineating each person’s
rights and duties depending on his or
her social status (varna) and stage of life
(ashrama). These texts were the basis for
the later Dharma Shastras (treatises on
religious duty), which expanded the
sutras, put them into verse, and were
intended to serve as an actual code of
law for the members of the community.
Dharna
Name for a rite intended to compel
another party to address one’s griev-
ances; the rite is usually adopted when
all other options have failed. The word
dharna comes from the Sanskrit (sacred
language) verb that means “to hold” or
“to maintain.” One element in the dharna
rite is just that—the persistent public
presence of the supplicant in proximity
to the people to whom he or she is
appealing. Thus, an aggrieved civil
[[192]]

servant in modern India may hold a
dharna near the Parliament building
in Delhi, and in some cases people
have camped there for months in an
effort to publicize their plight and
mobilize public opinion. In the same
way, people may hold a dharna at the
temple of a deity to seek guidance or
help; the most prominent example of
this is at the Tarakeshvar temple in the
state of West Bengal.
Aside from persistent presence,
dharna’s other common characteristic is
self-inflicted suffering, usually done
through fasting (upavasa) or other
forms of ascetic self-denial. Pilgrims to
Tarakeshvar refrain from eating or
drinking until the god Shiva grants them
a vision, although in practice the temple
priests often limit such exertions to
three days. On the political level,
Mohandas K. Gandhi perfected the “fast
unto death” as a tool to help attain his
political ends. One of the cultural
assumptions that helps make such self-
inflicted suffering persuasive is the
ancient Hindu belief that by voluntarily
enduring physical suffering (tapas) one
can generate spiritual and magical
power. The other working assumption
that makes the dharna effective comes
from the declaration at the rite’s begin-
ning. On the human level, dharnas are
usually undertaken to address very spe-
cific perceived injustices, which are
made public at the start. It is generally
believed that should the person per-
forming dharna die, then the person
against whom the dharna had been held
will be assessed the karmic demerit for
causing that person’s death. Such dhar-
nas are generally only undertaken when
one has no other alternative. Because of
this assumption, they remain a powerful
resource, even in contemporary times.
Dhatuvada
Hindu branch of the Indian tradition of
alchemy, which seeks to transform,
transmute, and perfect the body
through the use of various chemicals
with the ultimate goal of rendering theDhobi
Dhobis, or washermen, cleaning clothes by beating them on stone slabs.
body immortal. Just as both Hindus and
Buddhists appropriated the idea of yoga
(act of discipline), both traditions
also have alchemical schools. The
Dhatuvada school stressed seeking bod-
ily perfection solely through consuming
drugs and potions, particularly ones
compounded from mercury and
cinnabar. This is theoretically different
from the Buddhist Rasayana school,
since the latter is said to use such mate-
rial means only to prolong life until the
body can be transmuted through medi-
tation, ritual, and yoga. The conceptual
foundation for Hindu alchemy is its
analysis of the world as a series of bipo-
lar opposites, and the conviction that
unifying these opposing forces brings
spiritual progress and the end of rein-
carnation (samsara). The governing
metaphor for this combination of oppo-
sites is the union of sun and moon. In
keeping with this bipolar symbolism,
both the sun and the moon are connect-
ed to other opposing principles through
an elaborate series of associations. The
sun is identified with heat, drying
power, fire, the goddess Shakti, and
menstrual blood; the moon with coolness,
healing power, water, the god Shiva,
and semen. In alchemical practice, the
two essential chemical elements are mer-
cury and sulfur—the former identified
with Shiva’s semen, and the latter with
Shakti’s uterine blood. Through properly
mixing and consuming these elements,
the impure body is purified and refined,
eventually rendering it immortal.
Modern descriptions of this practice
invariably warn that it should only be car-
ried out under the direction of one’s guru
(spiritual teacher); otherwise these combi-
nations will be harmful. This warning is
not surprising, since by itself mercury is a
deadly poison. For further information
see Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta,
Obscure Religious Cults, 1962; and David
Gordon
White,
“Alchemy: Indian
Alchemy,” in Mircea Eliade (ed.),
Encyclopedia of Religion, 1993.
Dhenuka
In Hindu mythology, a fierce demon
(supernatural being) who appears in the
form of a cow (dhenu). Dhenuka is only
one of the demons slain by the god
Krishna—this time in concert with his
brother Balarama—during Krishna’s
childhood in the village of Brindavan. In
these episodes, Krishna dispatches the
most ferocious demons as if it were
child’s play, which in one sense it is.
Krishna’s presence in the world, and his
interaction with his devotees (bhakta),
is considered to be a lila (“play”), and
the ease with which he handles these
demons attests to this playful revelation
of his divine nature. For further consid-
eration of this theme, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975.
Dhobi
A washerman, traditionally one who has
cleaned clothes by getting them wet and
[[193]]
Dhrshtadyumna
then beating them on a stone slab. As
with all the occupations in traditional
India, this was a hereditary occupation-
al group (jati), although the names used
to designate them are different from
region to region. They were typically
believed to be of low status, since they
habitually handled clothes rendered
impure by sweat and other bodily fluids.
Dhrshtadyumna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Dhrshtadyumna is
the son of King Drupada and the brother
of Draupadi, King Drupada’s daughter.
Dhrshtadyumna and Draupadi are mag-
ically born by emerging from a sacrifi-
cial fire. Their father sponsors this rite of
sacrifice to give birth to a hero who will
kill Drona, who has taken away half of
Drupada’s kingdom after being insulted
by Drupada. Drona accepts the boy as a
pupil and teaches him the martial arts.
Even though a heavenly voice has
announced that the boy will eventually
kill him, he does this under the convic-
tion that fate cannot be avoided.
Dhrshtadyumna is instrumental in
arranging Draupadi’s marriage to the
five Pandava brothers, the epic’s protag-
onists, and he fights on their side during
the Mahabharata war. Dhrshtadyumna
fights fiercely in the war and eventually
kills Drona by cutting off his head, there-
by avenging his father’s defeat. Yet his
triumph is short-lived, for that very
night Dhrshtadyumna is killed by
Drona’s son Ashvatthama, who secretly
gains entry to the Pandava camp and
kicks Dhrshtadyumna to death.
Dhrtarashtra
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambika. Dhrtarashtra
and his stepbrother Pandu are the result
of a desperate attempt to preserve the
royal line of King Shantanu, after
Shantanu’s son Vichitravirya has died
without heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s
death, his mother Satyavati calls upon
[[194]]

her oldest son, Vyasa, to sleep with
Ambika and her sister, Ambalika, in the
hope that the women will conceive.
According to tradition Vyasa is very ugly,
and each woman involuntarily reacts
when Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambika
covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind, and
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion. Despite his disability,
Dhrtarashtra assumes the throne after
Pandu’s abdication; the latter renounces
the world after being cursed by the sage
Kindama. Pandu’s two wives have five
sons, known as the Pandavas, and
Dhrtarashtra and his wife Gandhari
have one hundred sons, collectively
known as the Kauravas. The ultimate
source of conflict in the Mahabharata
stems from the conflict between these
two royal lines, each of which has a legit-
imate claim to rule.
Dhrtarashtra does little to forestall
this struggle. Although he is generally
portrayed as a good person, he is also
weak and unable to contain the ambi-
tions of his eldest son, Duryodhana.
Here Dhrtarashtra’s blindness is not
just literal, but also symbolic, as he
lacks the vision and clarity that would
have allowed him to recognize the
breakdown between these two fami-
lies and to therefore take steps to
avoid it. His disability not only keeps
him on the margin of daily life, but is
also a sign of his inability to influence
the course of events, whatever his
feelings about them. One of the few
times that he actually shows force is
when he offers boons to Draupadi
(daughter of King Drupada) after her
humiliation by Duryodhana and his
brother Duhshasana, through which
she regains freedom for herself and
her husbands.
Because of his blindness, Dhrtarashtra
does not actually fight in the Mahabharata
war, but receives regular reports from
his bard Sanjaya, who has the ability
to see events at a distance. After the
Kauravas are defeated, he goes with
Gandhari and several others to live inDhuni
Ascetics gather around a dhuni, a smoldering fire used to stay warm and perform ascetic rituals.
seclusion in the forest. Six years later
he is killed in a forest fire.
Dhruva
(“fixed”) In Hindu mythology, a boy who
is a symbol for the unrelenting pursuit
of a goal. Dhruva is a king’s son, but for
some unknown reason his father favors
Dhruva’s half-brother over Dhruva.
Distressed by this insult, Dhruva takes a
vow to attain a place above all others,
and goes off to the forest to perform aus-
terities (tapas). After enduring bodily
mortifications for eons, the god Vishnu
appears to Dhruva to grant him a boon.
In response to Dhruva’s request for a
place above all others, Vishnu promises
Dhruva that after his death he will be
installed as the Pole Star, the pivot
around which all the other stars in the
sky will turn. Even now this star is
known by that name in India.
Dhuni
(from Sanskrit dhu, “to ignite”) A
smoldering fire that is kept burning by
ascetics. This fire serves multiple pur-
poses in ascetic life: It is a means to
stay warm in cold climates, a means to
perform physical asceticism by with-
standing heat, particularly in the sum-
mer, and its care and tending is also a
form of religious observance. The
dhuni is a natural gathering place, and
for many ascetics it is the center of
ascetic life, providing heat for warmth,
a fire for cooking and making tea, and
coals for lighting the chillum, a
straight pipe used to smoke tobacco
mixed with hashish (charas). The fire
itself is seen as the deity Agni in mate-
rial form. Agni is a witness to the con-
versation around the dhuni, which
should be of a serious and spiritual
nature. The dhuni’s sacred character
can be seen by certain restrictions that
were designed to maintain its purity:
one should not blow directly on the
fire (lest some saliva should contami-
nate it), but through a tube used for
this purpose; one should keep clean
the boundary around the dhuni (usu-
ally of made of hardened clay); and
one should not touch this boundary
[[195]]
Dhupa
with one’s feet. Certain ascetic centers
have a long history of a continuous fire.
One such example is the sacred village
Triyuginarayan in the Himalayas, where
a fire is claimed to have been burning for
the past three cosmic ages (yugas).
Dhupa
(“incense”) The eleventh of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship,
which follows the model of treating a
deity as an honored guest. In this offer-
ing, the deity is offered incense to enjoy
the scent. The underlying motive here,
as for all the upacharas, is to show one’s
love for the deity and minister to the
deity’s needs.
Dhushmeshvar
Another name for the form of the
god Shiva known as Ghrneshvar. This
is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a group
of sacred sites (tirthas) deemed
especially holy to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is believed to be uniquely present.
This site is located in Maharashtra state.
See Ghrneshvar.
Dhvani
(“echo”) In poetics—whether secular or
sacred—the suggestion or connotation
brought out by the poet’s language.
Indian literary theorists paid great
attention to this notion, since attention
to it allowed the poet to exercise much
greater emotive depths than the surface
meanings of the words would indicate
and pack a much deeper range of
images and associations into even a very
short verse.
Dhyana
(“meditation”) In the ashtanga yoga
(eight-point discipline) first arranged by
the philosopher Patanjali, dhyana is the
seventh of the eight elements of yoga
practice. Along with dharana (“concen-
tration”) and samadhi (“trance”),
dhyana is one of the three parts known
[[196]]

as the “inner discipline” (samyama), the
culmination of yogic training. Dhyana is
described as an extension of dharana, in
which the fixed concentration upon an
object acquired in dharana is continued
and extended without break. In more col-
loquial modern usage, the word dhyana
can be used to describe any sort of
focused meditation.
Dhyanashloka
(“meditation verse”) A verse or verses
specifying the physical attributes of a
deity to give the worshiper a mental
image upon which to meditate.
Dhyanashlokas are particularly impor-
tant in the esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, in which one of the
aims is to replace all outward acts of
worship with mental activities. In
this highly ritualized context, the
dhyanashlokas provide both a form and
a focus for one’s interior worship.
Diaspora Populations
Although the vast majority of Hindus
live in their traditional homeland of
South Asia, particularly in India and
Nepal, there is also a long history of
Hindus settling in other lands. By about
the fourth century C.E., Hindu traders
had spread Indian influence throughout
Southeast Asia, where the monuments
at the Angkor temple complex and the
culture of Bali bear witness to its pres-
ence. In the past century, poverty and
overcrowding in certain parts of India
(especially Bihar) led many of these
traders to sign up as agricultural con-
tract laborers in Fiji, South Africa, East
Africa, the West Indies, Mauritius, and
even Sri Lanka. All of these places have
substantial
Hindu
communities,
although their local status differs. In
some of these places Indians are consid-
ered equal citizens with the indigenous
peoples, and in others, such as Fiji, they
suffer legal obstacles. Aside from agri-
cultural labor, another possibility for
mobility and advancement came
through serving in the British army orDikshanama
civil service in other parts of the British
Empire, such as Singapore or Hong
Kong. Finally, the liberalization of immi-
gration and nationalization laws since
the end of World War II has led to the for-
mation of a substantial Hindu commu-
nity in North America, both in Canada
and the United States.
Didarganj Yakshi
Statue found in 1919 in Didarganj, a vil-
lage near Patna in the state of Bihar. The
image is believed to date from the third
century B.C.E. and is thus a product of
the Maurya dynasty. The statue is of a
voluptuous female figure, bare to the
waist, wearing abundant jewelry and
bearing a yak-tail whisk (chauri), which
was a contemporary sign of authority. It
is believed to be a statue of a yakshi, a
class of nature-spirits connected with
fertility and prosperity. It is notable as
one of the earliest known stone statues,
and there is speculation that this may
have come through contact with the
Greeks. The figure itself is masterfully
rendered in highly polished Chunar
sandstone from the sandstone quarries
near Benares; the sharply detailed ren-
dering of her clothing and jewelry con-
veys the illusion of softness and swelling
of the bare flesh.
Digambara
(“space-clad,” i.e., naked) In a general
ascetic context, this can refer to any
ascetic who is completely naked, which
is a sign of having renounced all posses-
sions and all worldly conventions.
Among the Bairagi Nagas, or renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Vishnu and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary soldiers,
the Digambaras are one of the three
Naga anis (“armies”), the others being
the Nirmohis and Nirvanis. In earlier
times these anis were actual fighting
units, but in modern times are mainly
important for determining bathing
(snana) order in the bathing proces-
sions at the Kumbha Mela (“Festival of
the Pot”). Of the three, the Digambaras
are by far the most important, and at the
time of the Kumbha Mela take prece-
dence over the others.
Diksha
(“initiation”) A religious initiation
involving the reception of secret reli-
gious teachings; the term is said to be
derived from the verb dis, “to point out.”
The word diksha carries a different
sense from the life-cycle rite known as
upanayana, the adolescent religious ini-
tiation that is the ritualized “second
birth” conferred on young men from the
three “twice-born” groups—that is,
brahmin (priestly), kshatriya (martial),
or vaishya (mercantile). Both are
religious initiations, and both involve
the creation of new capacities and
entitlements. Yet diksha is not a rite
usually seen as a transition point in the
life cycle, but a religious initiation in
which the initiate gains secret knowl-
edge from a religious teacher (guru),
usually given in the form of the verbal
formulas known as mantras. Whereas
upanayana takes place while a boy is
an adolescent, the time for diksha
is based not on physical age, but
on a person’s willingness and
readiness. Diksha is a particularly
important concept in the ritual
tradition known as tantra, in which
such personalized initiations are the
way of transmitting the tradition from
master to student.
Dikshanama
(“diksha name”) Name given to a
person after receiving initiation
(diksha), as a way of acknowledging and
reinforcing the new identity created by
the act of initiation. Sometimes, as in
the case of ascetic initiation, the
initiate’s former name will be replaced
with the dikshanama. In other cases the
name will be kept secret, as a source of
hidden power.
[[197]]
Dikshitar
Dikshitar
Southern Indian brahmin (priest) sub-
community. The Dikshitars are an
extremely small community and are
found mainly in the temple-town of
Chidambaram in the state of Tamil
Nadu. They are the hereditary servants
at the temple of Nataraja—the god
Shiva in his form as the “Lord of
the Dance.” According to their own
mythic understanding, the Dikshitars
were members of Nataraja’s heavenly
host (gana) when he lived in heaven.
They accompanied Nataraja when
he came down to earth, where they still
serve him.
Dilip
In Hindu mythology, one of the figures
in the charter myth describing how the
river Ganges descended from heaven to
earth. Dilip is the great-grandson of
King Sagar, and the father of the sage
Bhagirath, who finally accomplishes
this task. The story begins with King
Sagar, whose 60,000 heroic sons made
the mistake of insulting the sage Kapila,
and have been burned to ash by the fire
of Kapila’s yogic powers. Kapila tells
Sagar’s grandson Anshuman that the
souls of his dead uncles will find peace
only when the Ganges River (which is
considered to be the material form of
the goddess Ganga) comes down from
heaven and touches their ashes. After
this, the family labors unceasingly to do
this; Anshuman and Dilip die with this
goal unrealized, but Bhagirath finally
brings it to fruition by performing
asceticism until the gods agree to send
the Ganges to earth.
Dindi
Pilgrim group in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community that is centered
around the worship of the god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur in modern
Maharashtra. The primary Varkari reli-
gious practice is taking part in two
annual pilgrimages, in which all the par-
ticipants arrive in Pandharpur on the
[[198]]

same day. On this pilgrimage, pilgrims
travel in groups called dindis. Dindis are
often made up of people from the same
neighborhood or area and are usually
formed along caste lines. During the pil-
grimage, members of a dindi travel as a
unit, walking and singing devotional
hymns together during the day, and
cooking and camping together at night.
These dindis thus create smaller
subcommunities within the larger
pilgrim body.
Di Nobili, Roberto
(1577–1656) Jesuit priest and missionary
who spent much of his life in Madurai in
southern India. Di Nobili came to India
to convert Indians to Catholicism and to
facilitate his attempt at following the
Jesuit pattern of learning the local lan-
guages, in this case Sanskrit (sacred lan-
guage) and Tamil. He also strove to
understand local culture and to gain the
ritual authority that came with brahmin
(priestly) status by emulating brahmin
practices (vegetarianism, modes of
dress, etc.), as a way to spread the
Gospel more effectively. He was a per-
ceptive and careful observer, but his
writings remained unpublished during
his lifetime. They have only been recently
rediscovered. See also Tamil language.
Dipa
(“lamp”) The twelfth of the sixteen tradi-
tional upacharas (“offerings”) given to
a deity as part of worship, following the
model of treating the deity as an hon-
ored guest. In this action, the deity is
given an offering of light by waving a
lighted lamp before it. This rite more
commonly goes by the name of arati, a
word that is often used to denote wor-
ship in general. The underlying motive
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show
one’s love for the deity, and to minister
to the deity’s needs.

tion and to be the guardian associated

Divine Life Society
Religious organization founded in 1936
by Swami Shivananda. It is headquar-
tered at the Divine Life Ashram, just
outside the holy city of Rishikesh on the
river Ganges in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Although Shivananda himself
died in 1963, the society is still quite
active in spreading the ways of Hindu
life: through yoga (self-discipline) train-
ing programs at the Divine Life Ashram;
through publishing religious texts, both
traditional scriptures and the teachings
of Swami Shivananda; through estab-
lishing religious centers throughout the
world; and through various social ser-
vice projects in India itself. Swami
Shivananda was a Dashanami Sanyasi
(ascetic) in the Saraswati division,
which is one of the divisions that admits
only brahmins (priests). The Swami’s
brahmin background comes through in
the organization’s teachings, which
stress vegetarianism, rigorous spiritual
development, an emphasis on learning,
and a strict moral code. For all these rea-
sons the organization is widely respected in
Indian society, despite having a significant
number of foreign practitioners.
Divine Powers
When a single divinity is deemed to be
the supreme power in the universe, he
or she is generally said to wield five over-
arching divine powers: creation, order-
ing and maintaining the cosmos,
destruction, concealment, and giving
grace (divine self-revelation). The first
three powers describe the relationship
between the deity and the physical uni-
verse, whereas the fourth and fifth focus
on the deity’s relationship with individ-
ual devotees. By using the power of con-
cealment, the deity becomes hidden
in creation, and thus human beings
are kept in ignorance. This power
of concealment is often also described
as the deity’s maya, or the power of
illusion that keeps human beings from
[[199]]
Divorce
perceiving the divine reality that lies
behind all things. This power of illusion
is so strong that the only way human
beings can break through it is through
the deity’s grace, the final power. This
grace is an act of divine self-revelation,
in which the deity shreds the concealing
veil of illusion and reveals himself or
herself to human beings.
Divorce
Until the twentieth century, formal
divorce did not exist in traditional
Hindu society. This absence was
undoubtedly rooted in the Hindu per-
spective on marriage. Marriage was
seen as a permanent binding of hus-
band and wife (or more precisely,
assimilating her identity to his), in a
way that ruled out a dissolving of the
marriage while both members were
still living. When a wife failed to bear
children, the husband would some-
times take a second wife, but the origi-
nal marriage would remain intact.
Among the lower social classes, who
were often less concerned with main-
taining group status through appropri-
ate behavior, husbands and wives would
simply abandon their spouses for other
partners, but this was strictly forbidden
among “respectable” people.
Divorce is legally available in modern
India, but social and cultural factors
continue to weigh against it. Various fac-
tors make many women in unhappy
marriages reluctant to sue for divorce:
lack of support from their natal families,
who are often more interested in trying
to make the marriage work; the inability
to earn a living on their own; and the
near certainty that their husband’s fam-
ilies will be awarded custody of their
children, if they have any. Although atti-
tudes are slowly changing, it is also still
difficult for divorced women to remarry.
Divya Prabandham
(“Divine Composition”) Shorter name
for the Nalayira Divyaprabandham,
the collected hymns of the Alvars. The
[[200]]

Alvars were a group of twelve Vaishnava
poet-saints (devotees of the god
Vishnu), who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. In conjunction with their Shaiva
(devotees of the god Shiva) counter-
parts, the Nayanars, the Alvars spear-
headed the revitalization of Hindu
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and the
Jains. Both the Alvars and the Nayanars
stressed passionate devotion (bhakti) to
a personal god—Vishnu for the Alvars,
Shiva for the Nayanars—and conveyed
this devotion through hymns sung in
the Tamil language. In the southern
Indian religious community known as
the Shrivaishnavas, the collected
hymns of the Alvars have such high sta-
tus that they are known as the “Tamil
Veda”—that is, the religious texts in
the Tamil language which carry the
authority of the Veda, the oldest Hindu
religious texts.
Diwali
One of the most important festivals in
the Hindu religious year, which falls on
the new moon in the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). This festi-
val is dedicated to Vishnu’s wife
Lakshmi, a goddess who represents
wealth, prosperity, and good fortune.
According to popular belief, on this
night of the new moon Lakshmi roams
the earth, looking for households in
which she will be welcomed, and which
she will render prosperous by her pres-
ence. People spend the days before
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and white-
washing their homes to make them suit-
able for welcoming the goddess. On the
evening of Diwali people open all their
doors and windows to facilitate her
entry and place lights on their win-
dowsills and balcony ledges, as an invi-
tation to the goddess. In earlier times
these lights would be clay lamps or can-
dles, but today strings of electric lights
are also widely used. It is from these
lights that Diwali gets its name, as a
shortened form of Dipavali (dipa “light”
+ avali “series”). The charter myth forDog
Bright, spinning lights decorate homes and streets during the festival of Diwali.
According to Hindu tradition, these lights welcome Lakshmi, a goddess who embodies good fortune.
displaying these lights describes how a
poor old woman somehow gained a
royal boon that all houses but hers
would remain unlit on the night of
Diwali. When Lakshmi wandered the
land she went to the only house that was
lit to welcome her. Because of Lakshmi’s
presence, the old woman’s troubles
quickly ceased.
Lakshmi’s strong associations with
money and good fortune account for
several other practices often found on
Diwali. For many traditional merchant
families, Diwali is observed as the
beginning of the fiscal year. All out-
standing debts and obligations must be
cleared up beforehand, for on Diwali
new account books are begun. In some
cases the account ledgers are them-
selves ceremonially worshiped on this
day and are seen as material manifesta-
tions of Lakshmi. Another common
practice is gambling, although in most
cases it is done within the family, and for
small stakes. During the rest of the year
gambling is condemned as a potential
drain on one’s wealth, but doing so on
Diwali reaffirms the connection
between money and Lakshmi’s favor,
here in the guise of Lady Luck. Diwali is
also an occasion for eating sweets—the
more the better—and celebrating the
advent of the new year by shooting off
fireworks. India’s loose regulation of fire-
works gives celebrants access to rockets
and crackers of truly impressive size,
and in the larger cities people celebrate
the holiday with such zeal that it sounds
like an artillery barrage.
Dog
In general, the dog is considered an
extremely unclean and impure animal.
Today, keeping dogs as pets in India
is a practice that is gaining favor.
Traditionally, however, Indian dogs
roamed the streets as scavengers, eating
whatever they could find, including
each other. Such promiscuous eating
habits render them ritually impure, even
aside from the vermin and disease that
they often harbor, particularly rabies.
Aside from their practical importance as
scavengers, the dog is also the animal
vehicle of Bhairava, a wrathful form of
[[201]]
Doha
the god Shiva. Bhairava’s symbolic asso-
ciation with an unclean animal clearly
shows his marginal status in the
pantheon—he is powerful, but also
feared, because he is not bound by
normal rules.
Doha
Metrical form in northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poetry, made up of
two lines of twenty-four metric beats,
divided unevenly after the thirteenth
beat. The metric pattern for the first
line is 6 + 4 + 3, with the second line
being 6 + 4 + 1. The method of counting
the metric beats is based on the
distinction between “heavy” and “light”
syllables. A heavy syllable is any syllable
with a long vowel or a consonant cluster
and is reckoned at two metric beats; all
other syllables are reckoned as light, and
reckoned as one. Aside from the metric
pattern, there are rules about how each
half line should end—that the three
metric beats ending the first line cannot
be a heavy syllable (two beats) followed
by a light one (one beat)—which means
that it must either be a light syllable
followed by a heavy one, or three light
ones—and that the line’s final syllable
must be light. These conventions still
leave a great deal of fluidity, and the
doha is one of the most important
poetic forms for poets writing in Braj
Bhasha (the language of Krishna
devotion) and Avadhi (a dialect of
medieval Hindi). At times the doha can
stand alone, as in the epigrams of the
poet-saint Kabir, which have become
proverbial sayings in much of modern
India. The doha was also used in con-
junction with verses in other meters,
as in the Ramcharitmanas. In this
vernacular rendition of the epic
Ramayana, written by the poet-saint
Tulsidas, the doha usually comes after
four verses in the chaupai (four-line)
meter, and serves to sum up what has
transpired in the preceding verses.
[[202]]

Dom
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous
subgroups known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group has a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Doms are a
jati whose hereditary occupation was
cremating corpses. They have extremely
low social status because of their habit-
ual contact with dead bodies, consid-
ered the most violently impure objects
of all. Despite their low status, some of
the Doms are unbelievably wealthy,
particularly the ones who control the
cremation ghats in the city of Benares,
for without their cooperation, a body
cannot be burned. The word ghat refers
to any flat area on the bank of a river. In
most cases ghats are used as places for
bathing (snana), but in some other
cases they are also places for burning
bodies, so that the ashes can be placed
in the river to ritually "cool" them.
Dorasamudra
Capital city of the Hoysala dynasty, who
ruled the region in southern part of the
state of Karnataka from the eleventh to
the thirteenth centuries. Today
Dorasamudra is known by the name of
Halebid and is a village about sixty miles
north and west of the city of Mysore.
Although largely uninhabited, the site is
known for a magnificent collection of
temples, in particular the Hoysaleshvar
Temple, dedicated to the god Shiva in
his form as Lord of the Hoysalas. The
Hoysala temples were built out of a par-
ticular type of stone—variously
described as chlorite schist, steatite, or
soapstone—that was quite soft when
newly quarried, but gradually hardened
with exposure to air. This initial mal-
leability made the stone easy to carve,
and facilitated the lush detail that char-
acterizes these temples.Dowry Death
Dowry
In the strictest terms, this word is used
in modern Indian society to designate
any wealth transferred from the bride’s
family to the groom’s as a condition for
the marriage to occur. As with most
marriages around the world, Hindu
marriages often involve giving gifts to
the couple, but Indians themselves draw
distinctions between different cate-
gories of gifts. It is customary for the
bride’s parents to give her gifts of cloth-
ing and jewelry for her wedding, accord-
ing to their means. This practice is
attested in the dharma literature’s (text
on religious duty) description of the
Brahma marriage. This is one of the
eight recognized ways to perform a mar-
riage and describes the bride as richly
adorned. These gifts are her personal
property, and serve both to give the
bride some wealth of her own and as a
last resort for the family. It is also com-
mon for the bride’s family to give gifts to
the groom and his family, of which the
greatest is the “gift of a virgin”
(kanyadan), i.e., the bride herself. In
many cases, the newlyweds also receive
gifts from other relatives, particularly
when they are setting up a household.
Both of these sorts of gifts carry no stig-
ma in Indian society and in the popular
mind are not considered “dowry.”
Unfortunately, not all wedding “gifts”
fall into these categories. Most mar-
riages in India are still arranged by the
parents, who are operating under differ-
ing imperatives. For the bride’s parents,
marrying off their daughter is a religious
duty, which is over and above their nat-
ural inclination to provide for their
daughter. This gives the groom’s parents
a distinct advantage, since they “take”
the bride, and this advantage can give
rise to ugly and even tragic situations.
The parents of a young man with a
promising career can usually expect
larger and richer gifts from the bride’s
family, since her future will be more
secure. In many cases these gifts are nei-
ther asked for nor negotiated, but sim-
ply given as part of the exchange
between two families of equal status. In
the worst cases, the groom’s family pre-
sents a list of demands, which the bride’s
family is expected to fulfill as a condi-
tion for the marriage. Given the pressure
to marry off their daughters, the bride’s
parents may promise more than they are
actually able to “deliver.” One conse-
quence of this failure is the much-publi-
cized dowry deaths, in which the bride
is killed.
Most decent people in India recoil at
the notion of “selling” their sons to the
highest bidder, or of using his marriage
as an opportunity for the family to get
rich. At the same time, it is generally
accepted that marrying one’s daughter
will entail considerable effort and
expenditure, and that at her wedding
one should give appropriate gifts. It is
from these assumptions that the evils of
dowry stem, and can be exploited by
unscrupulous people.
Dowry Death
Name given to a particular type of
violent crime against women. According
to the much-publicized pattern, it is
the killing of a new bride by her in-laws,
either for failing to bring enough
dowry with her into the marriage,
or when her parents could not deliver
the dowry that had been promised.
In many cases these women were killed
by being doused with kerosene and
lit, since this could be passed off as
an accidental death suffered while
cooking. These murders received great
publicity in India and abroad in
the mid-1980s, in part because of
their calculated and horrific nature.
The aforementioned pattern simplifies
the issues, however, by reducing it to
a question of money. It is true that
there have been many cases in which
women have been killed solely for
financial reasons—that is, for not
bringing enough dowry. Yet many of the
victims of these so-called dowry deaths
had been married for years, and their
deaths are better explained as the
result of an escalating pattern of
[[203]]

domestic violence, rather than
calculated extortion and murder.
a
Draupadi
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Draupadi is the
daughter of King Drupada, and the
wife of all five Pandava brothers, the
epic’s protagonists. This literary refer-
ence to polyandry (the marrying of one
woman to several brothers) is interest-
ing, since it seems to have been
extremely rare throughout Indian his-
tory, and the epic has to give an expla-
nation for how this happened.
Draupadi’s father vows that he will give
his daughter in marriage only to the
man who can lift a giant bow, and then
hit a target suspended in the air. This
feat is child’s play for Arjuna, one of the
Pandava brothers and the world’s great-
est archer, and he wins Draupadi as his
wife. The wedding party returns home,
but while they are still outside, their
mother Kunti calls out that whatever
they have won must be shared between
them. To obey their mother, each of the
brothers marry Draupadi. They agree
that each will live with her for a year,
during which time the others shall not
attempt to see her.
Draupadi’s most famous scene in
the epic comes after her husband
Yudhishthira has wagered and lost her
in a game of dice. Yudhishthira has been
gambling with his cousins Duryodhana
and Duhshasana, who seize Yudhishthira’s
gaming ineptitude as an opportunity to
win the kingdom all to themselves. After
the loss, Duhshasana comes to
Draupadi’s chamber and drags her by
her hair back to the gambling hall. Her
pain and humiliation are compounded
by the fact that she is in the middle of
her menstrual period and is not allowed
to change her stained robe. In the gam-
bling hall Draupadi is paraded and
humiliated before the crowd like an ani-
mal at auction, and her property status
is emphasized when Duryodhana offers
her his thigh (the euphemism for the
genitals) as her place to sit. The final
[[204]]

insult comes when Duhshasana tries to
disrobe Draupadi by unwinding her sari.
Here the god Krishna enacts a miracle:
No matter how much cloth Duhshasana
pulls away, Draupadi remains fully
clothed. Stunned and confused, he
finally gives up.
Shocked by her humiliation,
Duryodhana’s father Dhrtarashtra
asks Draupadi to choose a boon. She
chooses freedom for her husbands,
although they eventually agree to
spend a period in exile. Even before
this incident there has been tension
between the Pandavas and their
cousins. With these insults to
Draupadi, however, the seeds of dis-
cord are more deeply sown. Because
Duhshasana has dragged her by the
hair, Draupadi vows to leave her hair
unbound until she can wash it in
Duhshasana’s blood, while her hus-
band Bhima takes an oath to avenge
Duryodhana’s insult by smashing
Duryodhana’s “thigh.” Draupadi’s
hunger for revenge and uncompromis-
ing hatred for these two are a major
force driving the remainder of the epic,
pushing all the parties toward the
inevitable fratricidal war.
Dravida
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture;
the others being the Nagara and the
Veshara. The Dravida style is primarily
found in southern India, particularly in
the modern state of Tamil Nadu.
Whereas the temple tower in the Nagara
style stresses an unbroken verticality,
culminating in one high peak, towers in
the Dravida style are composed of a
series of horizontal tiers, emphasizing
the successive layers. Although earlier
southern Indian temples have as their
focus one central tower, as at the
Rajrajeshvar Temple in the city of
Tanjore, the focus shifted in about the
twelfth century to the building of walls
around the temple’s complex perime-
ters. These walls had enormous gopu-
rams or central gateways at the cardinalDreams
points, which were usually the temple’s
tallest structures by far. The enclosed
area inside the temple complex was
often enormous, as in the estimated 500
acres at the temple of Shrirangam, but
most of the construction was only a single
story. (There would be taller towers over
the temple’s primary images, however.)
In the developed examples of the
Dravida style, this lessened emphasis on
soaring height was compensated by its
enormous horizontal spread. The best
examples of this later type are the
Ranganathaswamy temple in Shrirangam,
and the Minakshi temple in Madurai.
Dravida
(2) Brahmin (priestly) group that is one
of the five southern brahmin communi-
ties (Pancha Dravida). As their name
would indicate, the core region for the
Dravida brahmins is in deep southern
India, in the modern states of Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. The most illustrious of
the Dravida subcommunities are the
Nambudiris, among whom the great
philosopher Shankaracharya is believed
to have been born.
Dravidian
In the strictest linguistic sense, the word
Dravidian is the name for a particular
family of languages in which the primary
members are the four southern Indian
languages: Tamil, Telegu, Kannada, and
Malayalam. Aside from these four lan-
guages, all located in the southernmost
part of the subcontinent, another lan-
guage in the Dravidian family is Brahui.
This is spoken by a small and fairly iso-
lated population in modern Pakistan, far
from any other Dravidian language
speakers, and completely surrounded
by people speaking Indo-Aryan lan-
guages. One theory to explain this irreg-
ularity is that the Dravidian languages
were originally spoken all over the sub-
continent, but were gradually displaced
toward the south as Indo-Aryan lan-
guage speakers—better known as the
Aryans—came into India. According to
Built in the Dravida architectural style, the
Minakshi Temple contains enormous gopurams,
the gateways to the temple grounds.
this theory, the Brahui-speaking com-
munity is an isolated remnant of that
earlier time, which somehow managed
to remain intact.
This notion also affects how south-
ern Indians form their identities. The
word Dravidian can be used to denote a
southern Indian or any person whose
mother tongue is one of the four primary
Dravidian languages. For southern
Indians with a strong regional identity, it
is a way for them to distinguish them-
selves from northern Indians and the
“imperialism” of northern Indian cul-
ture. It is also used with an underlying
tone of pride, that as Dravidians they are
descendants of the subcontinent’s origi-
nal inhabitants.
Dreams
As symbol and reality, dreams have
multiple uses in Hindu thought.
Philosophically, dreams are often used
as examples to illustrate the illusory
nature of the world as it is perceived.
Just as a dream disappears when one
[[205]]
Drona
wakes up and is perceived to have been
unreal the entire time, so does the every-
day understanding of the world disap-
pear when one has perceived the
ultimate truth. In quite a different
understanding, the dream state is the
second of the states of consciousness
mentioned in the Mandukya Upanishad,
or one of the religious texts known as
the Upanishads. In the Upanishads,
the dream state is the first step in turn-
ing one’s awareness away from the out-
side world and into one’s Self, where all
sense of ego is lost. Waking conscious-
ness is further away from one’s Self
than the dream state. The four-step
pattern in this upanishad, and in oth-
ers as well, is from waking conscious-
ness, to dreams, to deep sleep, and
from there to the realization of the
eternal Self.
On quite another level, dreams are
an important part of religious life in
popular Hinduism. They are often
believed to give omens for the future,
which may be interpreted as favorable
or unfavorable, according to the dream’s
content and context. Dreams are also
seen as providing a channel for commu-
nicating with spirits, ghosts, village
deities, and other nonhuman spiritual
beings. Unquiet spirits of the dead will
often appear to family members in
dreams to reveal what they need to find
peace. The same process is often found
with village deities, who usually mani-
fest themselves to specific people in the
village, either to give warnings or to
make demands.
Drona
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Drona is
famous as a teacher of all the arts of
war, but particularly for teaching
archery. He is the martial preceptor to
both the Pandavas and the Kauravas,
the two royal factions whose battle
for power is at the heart of the
Mahabharata. Drona is the son of the
sage Bharadvaja, born through an
[[206]]

involuntary seminal emission when
the sage sees a celestial nymph
(apsara). Drona’s skill in weapons is
gained from the god Vishnu’s Parashuram
avatar, who bequeaths both his
weapons and his skills to Drona as a
boon. Drona’s skill as an archer is leg-
endary, as is his prowess as an archery
teacher. Among his pupils he has a par-
ticular fondness for Arjuna (a
Pandava brother), whose commit-
ment and concentration so outstrip
his peers that Drona promises Arjuna
that he will be the world’s greatest
archer. This support for Arjuna can be
seen in the story of Ekalavya, a tribal
boy whom Drona refuses to teach
because of his low status, but who
becomes Arjuna’s equal as an archer by
worshiping a clay statue of Drona. When
Drona discovers this, he demands that
Ekalavya give him his right thumb as a
preceptor’s fee, to ensure that no one will
be Arjuna’s equal.
During the Mahabharata war, Drona
fights valiantly on the side of Duryodhana
(eldest son of Dhrtarashtra), but is
finally killed by King Drupada’s son
Dhrshtadyumna. In the epic, Drupada
and Drona have a long history of con-
flict. They have lived together as stu-
dents, but after their student life ends
Drupada becomes the king of Panchala,
whereas Drona is so poor he cannot
afford to feed his family. On one occa-
sion, when Drona asks Drupada for
alms, Drupada upbraids him most
insultingly. Drona vows revenge, and
after teaching the arts of war to the
Pandavas and Kauravas, Drona demands
Drupada’s kingdom as his teacher’s fee
(dakshina) from his students. When
Drupada is defeated, Drona takes half of
his kingdom; Drupada vows to get
revenge on Drona. Drupada subse-
quently performs a great fire sacrifice to
give birth to a son who will kill Drona.
Out of the fire come two luminous chil-
dren, one of whom is Dhrshtadyumna,
and the other his sister, Draupadi.Drupada
Dropsy
Bodily condition in which the body
retains excess water, and in conse-
quence swells up. In several hymns
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts, dropsy is described as
the punishment levied by the god
Varuna for speaking falsehood. Varuna
was conceived as the guardian of
cosmic order (rta), and intentionally
false speech was considered the
paradigm of anrta, the destructive force
that ran counter to the ordering force
of rta. In this case the punishment was
seen as fitting the crime, as if one had
been metaphorically inflated by the lies
one had told.
Drshtanta
(“example”) In Indian philosophy, the
examples that are one of the required
elements in the accepted form of an
inference (anumana). These examples
were provided as further evidence to
prove the reason (hetu) given to support
the hypothesis. As a rule, there had to be
two such examples. One was a positive
example (sapaksha) to show that similar
things happened in comparable cases,
and the other was a negative example
(vipaksha) to show that this did not
happen in other cases. In the most com-
mon example of an inference, “There is
fire on the mountain, because there is
smoke on the mountain,” the sapaksha
could be “like kitchen” (a place with
both fire and smoke), and the vipaksha
“unlike lake” (a place without fire or
smoke). The purpose of both examples
is to support the reason given, by show-
ing that this reason gives sufficient
cause to support the theory.
Drugs
The attitude toward drugs in Hindu
society shows the incredible variation
for which the Hindu religion is famous.
In general, the use of drugs is zealously
condemned among “respectable” people,
as is anything leading to a potential loss
of control. Yet Hindu mythology also
portrays the god Shiva as regularly con-
suming intoxicants, particularly bhang,
a preparation made primarily from mar-
ijuana, and datura, a genus of plants
containing poisonous alkaloids. Given
this mythic example, some of Shiva’s
devotees (bhakta) do the same as a vari-
ety of religious practice. Many ascetics
regularly spend much of their day smok-
ing hashish (charas) mixed with tobac-
co, although this is not always viewed as
normal ascetic practice. There are also
particular times and places when con-
sumption of drugs is more accepted,
even
among
“normal”
people.
Consuming bhang is a fairly common
element in the celebration of certain fes-
tivals, such as Shivaratri (“Night of
Shiva”) and Holi (the festival of reversal).
It is also sometimes consumed when
people are on pilgrimage, and govern-
ment-regulated stands selling bhang
can be found at several important pil-
grimage places (tirtha), including
Benares, Puri, and Haridwar. Despite
this more widespread use in particular
specialized contexts, there are many
people who do not use drugs under any
circumstances and would never consider
doing so. Such rigid refusal is still only one
part of the “orthodox” picture, in which
one can find many different attitudes.
Drupada
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Drupada is the king
of the Panchala region, and the father of
Dhrshtadyumna and Draupadi. Much
of Drupada’s life is absorbed by his
struggle with Drona, who has been one
of Drupada’s fellow students. After their
course of studies is finished, Drupada
assumes his throne and lives quite lav-
ishly, whereas Drona is so poor that he
cannot even afford to feed his family. In
distress, Drona approaches Drupada for
help, reminding him of their past con-
nection. Drupada arrogantly dismisses
him, telling him that such ties are of no
consequence. Drona swears that he will
get revenge, and after teaching the arts
of war to the Pandavas and Kauravas,
[[207]]
Duhshasana
the two royal factions whose battle for
power is at the heart of the
Mahabharata, demands Drupada’s
kingdom as his preceptor’s fee
(dakshina). After Drupada is defeated,
Drona takes half of his kingdom, where-
upon Drupada swears revenge. He per-
forms a great sacrifice to give birth to a
son who will kill Drona. Two children
emerge from the sacrificial fire:
Dhrshtadyumna, who eventually kills
Drona; and Draupadi, who becomes the
wife of all five Pandavas. During the
Mahabharata war, Drupada fights on the
side of the Pandavas, his sons-in-law. He
is eventually killed in battle by Drona
but is later avenged by his son
Dhrshtadyumna, who kills Drona.
Duhshasana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Duhshasana
is one of the hundred sons of
Dhrtarashtra, who are collectively
known as the Kauravas. The heart of the
Mahabharata is the struggle for power
between the Kauravas and their cousins
the Pandavas, and the latter are the
epic’s protagonists. Duhshasana is most
infamous for his misbehavior toward
the Pandavas’ common wife Draupadi
after the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira,
loses everything—including Draupadi—
in a game of dice. Duhshasana drags
Draupadi into the gambling hall by her
hair and with her garments stained by
her menstrual blood; he also attempts
to disrobe Draupadi by pulling off her
sari, but is frustrated here by the god
Krishna, who miraculously makes
Draupadi’s sari infinitely long.
Duhshasana’s behavior in this inci-
dent only fans the enmity between the
two families. Draupadi’s husband
Bhima, the Pandava brother renowned
for his physical strength, vows to avenge
this insult by ripping open Duhshasana’s
chest and drinking his blood, whereas
Draupadi vows that she will leave her
hair unbound until she can wash it in
Duhshasana’s blood. During the
Mahabharata war Duhshasana fights
[[208]]

with his brother Duryodhana and is
eventually killed by Bhima, after which
both Bhima and Draupadi fulfill their
dreadful vows. As an extra measure of
revenge before killing Duhshasana,
Bhima tears off the hand that had held
Draupadi’s hair and beats Duhshasana
with his own severed limb.
Durga
(“inaccessible, impassable”) A particular
form of the Hindu Mother Goddess,
although the name is often used as a
more general title for the mother god-
dess in her fierce and powerful form. As
depicted in images and pictures, Durga
rides on a lion and holds in her eight
hands the weapons of all the gods. Both
of these features correspond to the
description of the great goddess in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important mythic text used for the
worship of the Goddess as the
supreme divine power. The general
identification of Durga with this great
Goddess is underscored by the
Devimahatmya’s other common name,
the Durgasaptashati (“The 700 [verses]
on Durga”). As a form of the great
Goddess, Durga is a major divinity in the
Hindu pantheon and in modern Hindu
life. The eighth day in the waxing and
waning halves of the lunar month are
considered sacred to her, and her rites
are practiced on those days. Her most
important festivals are the Nine Nights
(Navaratri), which occur in both the
spring and the fall. In each of these festi-
vals Durga is worshiped in her nine
forms (Navadurga), one on each
consecutive night. The variety of
goddesses as which she is worshiped
again shows us how Durga is conceived
as the embodiment of the Goddess in all
her forms.
Durgasaptashati
(“700 [verses in praise of ] Durga”)
Another name for the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important mythic
text for the worship of the Goddess asDurvasas
Worshipers immerse an image of the goddess Durga in the Yamuna River, near New Delhi.
Durga is depicted riding a lion and holding a weapon in each of her eight hands.
the supreme divine power. It has this
name because the text is 700 verses
long, and Durga is one of the common
names designating this powerful god-
dess. The Devimahatmya is well-known
for its assertion that God is female. This
is a notion with no clear source in the
earlier tradition, where female deities
were insignificant. The text begins with
a frame story, but the bulk of the work is
three stories describing the salvific
activity of the Goddess, who is portrayed
as far superior to the pantheon’s male
gods. See Devimahatmya.
Durvasas
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is a par-
tial incarnation of the god Shiva.
Durvasas is the son of Anasuya, who for
her influence in persuading another
woman to remove a curse has been
given boons by the gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. Anasuya requests
that each be born as one of her sons,
and Vishnu is born as Dattatreya, Shiva
as Durvasas, and Brahma as Chandra. As
a mythic figure, Durvasas is noted for his
magic powers, which are not surprising
given his background. He is also known
for his bad temper and for his tendency
[[209]]
Duryodhana
to curse anyone who makes him angry.
One victim of his wrath is the maiden
Shakuntala, who in her reverie on her
newfound love with King Dushyanta
does not notice and pay homage to
Durvasas. She is cursed that her love
would completely forget her. In another
case Durvasas curses all the gods to be
subject to old age and death. This is
provoked by an “insult” from Indra’s
elephant Airavata, which had flung a
garland given by Durvasas to the
ground. As with most curses in Hindu
mythology, neither of these curses can
be withdrawn, but their severity is
reduced by mitigating conditions.
Shakuntala is told that King Dushyanta
will remember her if she shows him
some sign of their relationship, which
she does. The gods can avoid old age
and death by obtaining and consuming
the nectar of immortality (amrta).
As with all the sages, Durvasas can
also grant wonderful boons to people
with whom he is pleased. One such ben-
eficiary was Kunti, one of the heroines
in the epic Mahabharata. Durvasas
gives Kunti a powerful mantra (sacred
sound), which will allow her to have a
child by any of the gods simply by think-
ing about him. As soon as Kunti receives
this mantra, she tests it while looking at
the sun, and immediately bears the
golden child Karna. In her panic at
unexpectedly becoming a mother—she
is still unmarried, and understandably
concerned about what people might
think—she puts the child in a box and
abandons him in the Ganges. After her
marriage to Pandu (son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambalika), this
mantra is the only way that she is able to
have children, since Pandu has been
cursed to die the moment he sleeps with
one of his wives. She uses this mantra to
bear Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Bhima,
then teaches it to her co-wife Madri,
who bears Nakula and Sahadeva. Thus,
through the gift of Durvasas, all the
Pandava brothers—the epic’s protago-
nists—are children of the gods.
[[210]]

Duryodhana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Duryodhana is
the eldest son of King Dhrtarashtra,
and thus the leader of the Kauravas,
one of the two royal factions whose
struggle for power is at the heart of the
epic. Duryodhana and ninety-nine
brothers are born in an unusual man-
ner. Their mother Gandhari gives birth
to a great lump of flesh, which is divid-
ed and put into one hundred pots of
clarified butter. In these pots the lumps
develop into infants. At the moment
Duryodhana is born there are a host of
evil omens, and when the court
astrologers are asked to interpret these,
they conclude that Duryodhana will be
the ruin of the country and his family,
and that it will be better to abandon
him to the elements. Fatherly feelings
prevent Dhrtarashtra from doing this,
which sets the stage for the final con-
flict. Even though the major force dri-
ving the epic’s plot is the animosity
between Duryodhana and his cousins,
the Pandavas, and this ends with the
Kauravas being utterly destroyed,
it would be inaccurate to paint
Duryodhana as an unredeemable vil-
lain. He is less evil than ill-starred—
proud, stubborn, unwilling to admit his
mistakes, and after a certain point,
unwilling to grant his cousins any
advantage. These character flaws are
magnified by the lack of strong guid-
ance from his father Dhrtarashtra, and
eventually spell his doom.
The rift between the cousins devel-
ops early, inflamed in part by the fact
that the Pandavas are more heroic than
Duryodhana and his brothers. As a
child, Bhima, the Pandava brother best
noted for his prodigious strength, used
to whip all hundred Kauravas at once.
Needless to say this does not endear him
to them. Later in adolescence, when
their archery teacher, Drona, requests
the capture of King Drupada as his pre-
ceptor’s fee, the Pandava brother Arjuna
succeeds in doing this, whereas
Drupada defeats Duryodhana in battle.Dushyanta
Another rift grows when the Pandavas
contest the right of Duryodhana’s friend
Karna to take part in an archery match,
claiming that Karna’s unknown parent-
age makes him unfit to compete with
kings. Duryodhana skirts that issue by
proclaiming Karna as the King of Anga,
but by then the bad blood between the
cousins is well-established.
This bad blood becomes apparent
in many different plots. Duryodhana
first tries to kill the Pandavas by build-
ing a flammable house of lac for them,
which is then set on fire. The Pandavas,
however, are able to escape unharmed.
Duryodhana later entices Yudhishthira
(a Pandava brother) into a game of dice.
Yudhishthira wagers and loses every-
thing that he has, including himself, his
brothers, and their common wife
Draupadi. After this loss Duryodhana
and his brother Duhshasana publicly
humiliate Draupadi, after which Bhima
swears a solemn oath to kill them both.
Dhrtarashtra gives the Pandavas their
freedom, which they promptly lose in
yet another game of dice. The outcome
of this loss is that the Pandavas agree to
spend twelve years in exile in the forest,
and live incognito for the thirteenth,
with the condition that if they are dis-
covered in the thirteenth year the cycle
will begin anew.
Despite the best efforts of Duryodhana’s
spies, the Pandavas manage to escape
detection during the thirteenth year,
and at its conclusion send envoys to
Duryodhana to claim their share of the
kingdom. Perhaps emboldened by
Yudhishthira’s comment that he and his
brothers will be satisfied with a mere
five villages, Duryodhana replies that he
will not give them enough land to put
under the point of a needle. In the face
of such stubbornness and injustice, the
Pandavas prepare for war to claim what
is rightfully theirs. During the war
Duryodhana fights valiantly, but in the
eighteen days of battle sees his forces
disintegrate around him. His final battle
is with Bhima, who in exchange for
Duryodhana’s earlier insult to Draupadi
(he had directed her to sit on his thigh,
which was a euphemism for the
genitals), smashes Duryodhana’s thigh
with his mace, killing him.
Dushana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Dushana is one of the
brothers of the demon-king Ravana.
Together with his brother Khara,
Dushana tries to avenge the honor of
their sister Shurpanakha, whose ears
and nose have been cut off by Rama’s
brother Lakshmana. In a fierce battle
with their demon (supernatural being)
army, Rama destroys the army and kills
Khara and Dushana. Seeing the failure
of her two brothers, Shurpanakha goes
to Ravana to beg for vengeance. Ravana
realizes he cannot kill Rama in battle but
resolves to avenge his sister by
kidnapping Sita, wife of Ravana. This
sets in motion the plot of the latter part
of the epic.
Dushyanta
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Dushyanta
is a king of the Lunar Line and
the husband of Shakuntala. Their
romance is also described in Kalidasa’s
drama Abhijnanashakuntala. Dushyanta
meets Shakuntala, who is living in a for-
est ashram (abode of an ascetic), while
he is hunting in the forest. They fall in
love and are married by their mutual
consent. After a short time Dushyanta
has to return to his kingdom, with
Shakuntala to follow soon after. In the
meantime, Shakuntala has been cursed
by the sage Durvasas that her beloved
will completely forget her, although
Durvasas later modifies the curse, and
says that Dushyanta will remember
everything if Shakuntala can show him
any proof of their union. The bulk of the
story in both episodes is concerned
with Shakuntala’s trials and tribulations
as she strives to regain her rightful place
as queen. In both versions, Dushyanta
is a minor character, but clearly an
essential one.
[[211]]
Dussehra
In Kulu, people celebrating the festival of Dussehra carry temple images in procession through the streets.
Dussehra
(variant of Dashahara, “ten days”)
Festival celebrated on the tenth day of
the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Ashvin (September–October),
and one of the most important celebra-
tions in the year. The festival celebrates
the victory of good over evil, and is also
known as Vijaya Dashami (“Victory
Tenth”). The festival has two charter
myths, both of which mark the ultimate
triumph of good over evil. One charter
comes from the mythology of the
Goddess, and marks this as the day on
which Durga (form of the Hindu Mother
Goddess) slays the buffalo-demon
Mahishasura. This episode comes from
the Devimahatmya, and is the central
theme of the text—the goddess is born
[[212]]

to destroy Mahishasura when the gods
cannot, and the struggle between the
two is the climax of the text. Since the
nine days preceding Dussehra are the
fall Navaratri, the “nine nights” spent in
worship of the Goddess, it seems rea-
sonable that the tenth and concluding
day would be marked by the climactic
moment in the Devimahatmya, the
most important source of mythology for
the Goddess.
The other charter myth for this festi-
val comes from an entirely different
source, the mythology of Rama (the sev-
enth incarnation of Vishnu). This is cel-
ebrated as the day on which Rama slays
Ravana (demon-king of Lanka) and
regains Sita (wife of Rama) from captivity.
This victory is symbolized by burning
huge effigies of Ravana and his sonDvaita (“dual”) Vedanta
Meghanada (an epithet of Indrajit) on
the night of Dussehra, and these effigies
often contain fireworks to enhance their
pyrotechnic capacity. This time of year is
often celebrated with dramatic enact-
ments of the Ramayana (the Sanskrit
epic), known as the Ram Lila. In some
cases this lasts for ten days, ending on
Dussehra; in other cases (as in the Ram
Lila in Benares, the sacred city on the
banks of the Ganges River) it will last an
entire month, with Dussehra marking
the death of Ravana.
Dussehra is a highly auspicious day,
and popular tradition holds that any-
thing begun on this day will succeed.
Dussehra is thus a favored occasion for
initiating any important projects, begin-
ning endeavors, or forming organiza-
tions, even if it is only a token beginning.
Dussehra also marks the beginning of
the cool season, when the end of the hot
weather and the monsoon rains bring
better conditions for military action.
Both charter myths have connections
with battle and conquest, and in earlier
times Dussehra was particularly cele-
brated by the royal and martial classes.
On Dussehra it was customary for sol-
diers to worship their weapons. Given
the festival’s martial associations and
the guarantee that all things initiated on
that day would be successful, it was also
the day of choice for rulers to send out
their armies to invade neighboring terri-
tories. Even today one of the most spec-
tacular celebrations is in Mysore, where
the ruler presides over this festival in his
ritual position as king, even though he
no longer rules. The other great celebra-
tion is in Kulu, where all the deities in
the region journey to Kulu to celebrate
this festival (along with hordes of their
human retainers).
Dvadashakshara Mantra
(“[the] twelve-syllable mantra”) Twelve-
syllable mantra (sacred sound) used in
parts of the Vaishnava community. The
mantra is “Om namo bhagavate
narayanaya” (“Om, Homage to the
blessed Narayana”).
Dvaitadvaita Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the Vedas.
Dvaitadvaita Vedanta’s founder and
most important figure was the four-
teenth-century philosopher, Nimbarka.
Nimbarka stressed the worship of the
god Krishna and his companion Radha
as a divine couple, but on a philosophi-
cal level he was attempting to find some
middle ground between the monism of
the Advaita Vedanta school and the
dualism of the Dvaita Vedanta school.
The former claimed that a single
Ultimate Reality—called Brahman—lay
behind all things, and that all things
were merely differing forms of this sin-
gle reality. The latter emphasized the
utter distinction between God as
Ultimate Reality on the one hand, and
the world and human souls on the other.
Nimbarka stressed that the world and
souls were dependent on God, in whom
they exist and with whom they had a
subtle connection. Nimbarka thus sup-
ported the philosophical doctrine called
parinamavada, which stressed the real
transformation of the divine and the
capacity of human beings to transform
themselves back to their divine status.
Dvaita (“dual”) Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the
Vedas. Dvaita Vedanta’s founder and
most important figure was the philoso-
pher Madhva, who lived in southern
India in the thirteenth century.
Madhva’s basic theory is the utter tran-
scendence of God, and this conviction
leads him to suggest a philosophical
position known as dualism. Dualism
asserts a qualitative difference
between God in his transcendence and
the corruptions of material things.
According to Madhva, God is com-
pletely different from human Selves
and the material world, even though
[[213]]
Dvapara Yuga
both of these come from God and
depend on Him for their continuing
existence. In this dualism, Madhva dif-
fers sharply from the major school of
Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta. The Advaita
school upholds a philosophical posi-
tion known as monism, which is the
belief that a single Ultimate Reality—
called Brahman—lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of this single reality.
Whereas Advaita collapses all things
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists
on maintaining differences.
Madhva’s stress on dualism leads
him to clarify these differing types of
things, which is known as the “fivefold
difference”: the difference between God
and the Self, between God and the
world, between individual Selves,
between Selves and matter, and
between individual material things.
Even though each Self is believed to
contain an aspect of God, this funda-
mental difference gives the Self only a
limited capacity for religious life. This
limited power means that final libera-
tion of the soul comes solely through the
grace of God, who alone has the power
to effect it. Final liberation is conceived
both as freedom from rebirth and as the
soul’s opportunity to remain in the
divine presence forever.
With its stress on God’s utter tran-
scendence and the emphasis on grace
as the sole vehicle for salvation,
Madhva’s Dvaita Vedanta has often
been compared to the theology of John
Calvin. Madhva even stated that the
world had three classes of beings:
those eventually destined for libera-
tion (muktiyogas), those destined for
eternal rebirth (nityasamsarins), and
those destined for eternal damnation
(tamoyogas). Like Calvin, Madhva did
not see these categories as promoting
fatalism, but rather that the prospect
of never attaining liberation could urge
one to the faith necessary to pursue an
active religious life. For further infor-
mation see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Presuppositions of India’s Philosophies,

Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Dvapara Yuga
Particular age of the world in one of the
reckonings of cosmic time. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with an active phase known as the
Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
known as the Night of Brahma. In one
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of
Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas (units of cosmic
time), named the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each of
these four yugas is shorter than its pre-
decessor, and ushers in an era more
degenerate and depraved. By the end of
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad
that the only solution is the destruction
and recreation of the earth, at which
time the next Krta era begins.
The Dvapara Yuga is thus the third of
the four yugas contained in a mahayuga,
and lasts for 864,000 years. The metal
associated with the Dvapara yuga is
bronze—less valuable than the gold and
silver associated with the earlier ages,
but better than the iron of the Kali yuga.
This is popularly believed to be the cos-
mic age in which the god Krishna
appeared on earth.
Dvarapala
(“door-protector”) Guardian images
placed on either side of the entrance to
a Hindu temple. These figures are usu-
ally portrayed as minor celestial beings
and conceived as the protectors of the
sacred space inside. Since any Hindu
temple is first and foremost the home
for the deity within, and since both
kings and gods often used the same
symbols to display and reinforce theirDwara
status, it is not surprising that the
deities would have some “servants”
guarding theirs door and restricting
access to them, in the same way as their
human counterparts.
Dvija
(“twice-born”) Name for a member of
the three “twice-born” groups in Indian
society, that is, a brahmin (highest in
status), kshatriya (second in status to
brahmins), or vaishya (third in status to
brahmins). This name exists because
these groups are ritually eligible to
receive the adolescent religious initia-
tion called upanayana, which is often
described as the “second birth.” See
twice-born.
Dvipas
According to traditional mythic geogra-
phy, the visible world is composed of a
series of seven concentric dvipas, a word
that literally means “islands,” but can be
translated to “landmasses.” All but one
of these are named after particular
plants. At the center is Jambu (“Rose-
apple”) dvipa, followed by Plaksha (“fig-
tree”) dvipa, Salmala (“silk-cotton tree”)
dvipa, Kusha (“kusha grass”) dvipa,
Krauncha (“curlew”) dvipa, Shaka
(“Teak”) dvipa, and at the outermost
edge, Pushkara (“blue lotus”) dvipa.
Each of these lands is separated from its
neighbors by one of the seven oceans
(the saptasindhu), with each ocean
composed of a different substance. The
innermost ocean, as experience shows,
is composed of salt water, the ones
beyond this are of sugar cane juice,
wine, ghee, yogurt, milk, and sweet
water, respectively. At the center of
Jambudvipa (and thus the world) is
Mount Meru, which is compared to the
central calyx of a lotus, and is surrounded
by the dvipas as its petals. The physical
world is thus seen as a symmetrical
whole, with the land of India (in the
southern part of Jambudvipa) posi-
tioned at the symbolic center.
Dvarapala, or gatekeeper, statue at the entrance of
the Brhadeshvar Temple in Thanjavur. These statues
depict minor deities that protect the space inside.
Dwara
(“door” or “gateway”) Among the
Bairagis, renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu,
the word dwara is used to denote a
branch or subsect of a particular order.
Each dwara is named after its ascetic
founder, who was himself usually a
noted disciple of the larger order’s
founder. For example, the Nimbarki
ascetics are one of the four estab-
lished orders among the militant
Vaishnava ascetics known as the
chatuh-sampradayi Nagas, along with
the Ramanandis, the Vishnuswamis,
and the Madhva Gaudiya (Brahma sam-
praday) ascetics. The Nimbarkis them-
selves are divided into nine dwaras, or
subsects, each named after the dwara’s
founder. The division of ascetics by
means of dwaras is another means of
subdividing ascetic orders, and creating
even more sharply defined ascetic iden-
tities and loyalties.
[[215]]
Dwaraka
Dwaraka
Sacred city (tirtha) on the western coast
of Gujarat, on the shore of the Arabian
Sea. In mythic terms, Dwaraka is most
famous as the capital city for the god
Krishna’s kingdom, at which he is
believed to have lived in the years fol-
lowing the Mahabharata war. Dwaraka’s
most important site is the Dwarakanath
Temple, dedicated to Krishna in his
form as the “Lord of Dwaraka.” Dwaraka
is also one of the four dhams (“divine
abodes”), sacred centers that approxi-
mately define the geographic bound-
aries of India; the three others are
Badrinath, Puri, and Rameshvaram.
Dwaraka is also the site of the Sharada
math, one of the four Dashanami
Sanyasi maths (monastic centers) sup-
posedly established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The Sharada math is
the headquarters of the Kitawara group
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, one of the
four major organizational groups, with
each one centered at one of the maths.
As with many other Hindu sacred sites,
Dwaraka is sanctified by a network of
mythic and religious associations.
Dyaus
A minor deity in the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Dyaus is a god associated with
the sky, but his character is not well-
developed, since even at the time of the
Vedas he had been largely eclipsed by
other gods. Dyaus is part of the oldest
layer of Indo-Aryan deities, as evidenced
by the Greek form of his name, Zeus.
[[216]]
Eclipses
## E
Earth
In Hindu mythology, Earth is considered
a goddess. The notion that India is a
sacred land is one of the most deeply
rooted elements in Hindu life, and many
of India’s mountains, rivers, and other
geographical features are considered
gods and goddesses. This belief extends
to Earth itself. In the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu sacred texts, Earth appears as the
goddess Prthivi, who is lauded for her
fertility, her nurturing capacity, and her
firmness in supporting all things. Prthivi
almost always appears in conjunction
with Dyaus, a male deity associated
with the sky, whose name is a cognate
form of the Greek god Zeus. Sky and
Earth thus form the divine couple, with
the rain from the sky fertilizing and
energizing the earth.
In later mythology the figure of
Prthivi is supplanted by the goddess
Bhudevi (“Earth Goddess”), who is con-
sidered to be one of the wives of the god
Vishnu. Bhudevi is less frequently asso-
ciated with fertility and nurturing; her
primary function is as a supplicant to
galvanize the world-rescuing activity of
Vishnu. When the wicked become too
oppressive, or a demon becomes too
powerful and disrupts the cosmic order,
Earth cries out to Vishnu for help, and
Vishnu obligingly restores the cosmic
balance. One example of this is the Boar
avatar, in which Earth herself is rescued
from bondage by Vishnu. For further
information see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Earth
(2) In its material form, one of the
five elements in traditional Indian
cosmology, the others being water,
fire, wind, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the
elements is paired with one of the five
senses; in this case earth is associated
with smell. The element earth is also
associated with certain bodily functions,
especially the elimination of solid wastes.
Eating
Throughout the world the act of eating
is imbued with cultural significance and
cultural messages, and Hindu culture
makes no exception. Given the strong
emphasis on purity, Hindus pay signifi-
cant attention to the preparation and
consumption of food. Factors such as
whom one eats with, who may prepare
one’s food, and what types of food one
will eat and how it should be prepared
all send messages about the social status
of an individual or a community. The
groups with the highest status, particu-
larly brahmins, are the strictest with
regard to their dining habits. For the
most part, such high-status groups
adhere to a principle known as com-
mensality—that is, only eating food
cooked by members of their social
group. With regard to the content of
one’s diet, the great divide is between
vegetarian and nonvegetarian. An exclu-
sively vegetarian diet indicates higher
status, and among nonvegetarians there
are status gradations depending on
what types of meat one eats. For ortho-
dox Hindus, every meal is a potential
source of ritual contamination and must
be carefully monitored. Food cooked in
water is seen as far more susceptible to
pollution (ashaucha) and greater care is
taken in accepting it, whereas food fried
in oil or ghee is believed to be much
more resistant to pollution and thus a
lesser source of ritual danger. From a
religious perspective, the safest meal of
all is the meal that is cooked and eaten
at home. See also Vegetarianism.
Eclipses
Without exception, eclipses are consid-
ered highly inauspicious and ritually
[[217]]
Eighteen Minor Works
dangerous times. As in many other cul-
tures, Indian astronomers were able to
figure out the motion of the moon, and
thus could predict both solar and lunar
eclipses fairly accurately. The tradi-
tional mythic explanation for eclipses
comes from the story of the Tortoise
avatar, in which the gods and demons
agree to join forces to churn the Ocean
of Milk into the nectar of immortality,
which they will then share. The gods
manage to trick the demons out of
their share, but as the gods divide it
among themselves, the demon Sainhikeya
slips into their midst in disguise. As
Sainhikeya begins to drink, the sun and
moon alert the god Vishnu to
Sainhikeya’s presence, and Vishnu
quickly uses his discus to cut off the
demon’s head. Yet since the demon
drank some of the nectar, both his head
and trunk become immortal, with the
head becoming Rahu and the trunk
becoming Ketu. Rahu has particular
enmity for the sun and moon, the
deities responsible for his demise, and
tries to swallow them whenever he
meets them in the heavens. He always
succeeds, but since he no longer has a
body to digest them, they escape
unharmed through Rahu’s severed neck.
This association with Rahu makes
eclipses inauspicious and ritually dan-
gerous times, and in popular culture
eclipses are believed to emit malevo-
lent rays that have a physical quality.
Many people respond to this danger by
remaining indoors for the duration of
an eclipse. During an eclipse, people
will often perform rites of protection,
including giving donations (dana) as a
way to give away potential bad luck.
Pregnant women must take particular
care, lest the inauspiciousness of the
time affect the growing child. Some
believe that pregnant women should
lie completely motionless during an
eclipse, fearing that the child will be
born missing the body part corre-
sponding to the one that the woman
moved. After the eclipse, people bathe
(snana) and perform other rites of
purification to remove any possible
[[218]]

lingering taint of impurity (ashaucha)
or bad luck.
Eighteen Minor Works
(Padinenkilkanakku) Name given a col-
lection of early Tamil works of literature,
which was complete by the late fifth
century C.E. All of these works have
a moral emphasis and aim to inculcate
ethical or religious values in the hearers.
The two most famous examples in
this collection are the Tirukkural and
the Naladiyar.
Ekadashi
(eleventh day) Hindu religious life is
primarily based on the lunar calendar,
in which the year contains twelve lunar
months, each of which is divided
equally into “dark” (waning) and
“bright” (waxing) halves. Ekadashi is
the name of the eleventh day in both
the waning and the waxing half of the
lunar month. Certain days during each
half of the lunar cycle are deemed
sacred to particular gods and goddess-
es, and these are days for special wor-
ship. The ekadashi or eleventh day in
each half of the lunar month is deemed
sacred to the god Vishnu. With one
exception, each of the twenty-four
ekadashis has a separate name, charter
myth, prescribed rites, and promised
result for fulfilling it. Pious Vaishnavas
observe each of these twenty-four festi-
val days. In their order of occurrence
throughout the year, the ekadashis are:
Papamochani Ekadashi and Kamada
Ekadashi during the lunar month of
Chaitra, Baruthani Ekadashi and
Mohini Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Baisakh, Achala Ekadashi
and Nirjala Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Jyeshth, Yogini Ekadashi and
Devshayani Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Ashadh, Kamika Ekadashi
and Putrada Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Shravan, Aja Ekadashi and
Parivartini Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Bhadrapada, Indira Ekadashi
and Papankusha Ekadashi during theEknath
lunar month of Ashvin, Rambha
Ekadashi and Devotthayan Ekadashi
during the lunar month of Kartik,
Utpanna Ekadashi and Mokshada
Ekadashi during the lunar month of
Margashirsha, Saphala Ekadashi and
Putrada Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Paush, Shattila Ekadashi and
Jaya Ekadashi during the lunar month
of Magh, and Vijaya Ekadashi and
Amalaki Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Phalgun. Of these ekadashis,
some are more important to the general
populace than others, particularly
Devshayani and Devotthayan Ekadashis,
which mark the rainy season “sleep” of
Vishnu during the chaturmas period. The
only ekadashi to appear twice is Putrada
(“son-giving”) Ekadashi. This promises
that faithful observance will bring the
birth of a son, and its reappearance clear-
ly points to the traditional preference for
sons over daughters.
Ekalavya
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Ekalavya is a
figure who illustrates the pervasive
reach of the caste system. Ekalavya is
a tribal boy who wants to learn
archery from Drona, the royal archery
teacher, but is refused because of his
low birth. Undaunted, Ekalavya
makes a clay image of Drona, treats it
as his teacher, or guru, and through
assiduous practice and devotion to his
guru becomes the most skilled archer
on the earth. When Arjuna, a young
warrior-king and Drona’s best stu-
dent, discovers this, he becomes jeal-
ous and complains to Drona, since
Drona has promised Arjuna that no
one will surpass him as an archer.
Drona asks Ekalavya how he has
become so skillful. When he learns
that Ekalavya has worshiped Drona’s
image as his guru, Drona notes that he
is entitled to a preceptor’s fee (dakshi-
na). As his fee he requests Ekalavya’s
right thumb, a gift that will consider-
ably diminish Ekalavya’s shooting
abilities. Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish
without hesitation, but from that day
is no longer better than Arjuna.
Ekmukhi Rudraksha
A particular type of rudraksha, which is
a bead made from the dried seed of the
tree Elaeocarpus ganitrus. The rudrak-
sha is considered sacred to the god
Shiva, and is often strung into garlands
and worn by his devotees (bhakta). The
seed itself is typically round, with a
knobby pitted surface and a natural
channel in the middle through which a
thread can be easily drawn. It has nat-
ural divisions running from top to bot-
tom, which divide the seed into units
known as “faces” (mukhi). The Ekmukhi
Rudraksha is one in which the dividing
lines running from top to bottom are
completely absent, making the whole
seed a single and undivided piece. Such
a rudraksha is extremely rare, as well as
holy, for it is believed to be a manifesta-
tion of Shiva himself in material form.
Their rarity also makes them extremely
valuable, and street sellers routinely
counterfeit them by carving reproduc-
tions out of pieces of wood, often with
the symbol Om on one side.
Eknath
(1533–1599) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
that worships the Hindu god Vithoba, at
his temple at Pandharpur in the mod-
ern state of Maharashtra. Eknath was a
brahmin who lived most of his life in the
city of Paithan, which was an important
trading and political center. Today, there
is a shrine to Eknath in Paithan. In keep-
ing with his birth as a brahmin, Eknath
was highly learned in traditional
Sanskritic lore. His best-known work is a
translation into Marathi of the eleventh
chapter of the Bhagavata Purana, a
sectarian religious text that is the most
important for the worship of the god
Krishna. Yet Eknath also seems to have
been intensely conscious of the spiritual
capacities of the lower castes and the
way in which social boundaries could be
[[219]]
Ekoddishta
leveled by devotion. In short poems
known as bharuds he speaks in a variety
of voices, including those of untouch-
ables, Muslims, and women. Traditional
accounts of his life describe him as
treating untouchable devotees (bhakta)
as his equals, and even eating
and drinking with them. Such flagrant
transgression of social boundaries
brought trouble from more orthodox
brahmins—who are portrayed as the vil-
lains in these traditional accounts—but
on each occasion Eknath managed to
escape being outcasted by them, often
through divine intervention. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; Justin E. Abbott, The
Life of Eknath, 1981; and Eleanor Zelliot,
“Chokamela and Eknath: Two Bhakti
Modes of Legitimacy for Modern
Change,” in Journal of Asian and African
Studies, 1980, Vol. 15, Nos. 1–2, 1980. See
also Sanskrit.
Ekoddishta
“Intended for one [person].” A particular
type of shraddha or memorial service
for the dead, which is performed for the
benefit of a single person. An ekoddishta
shraddha can be performed as a series
of sixteen offerings performed during
the first year after the person’s death.
These sixteen offerings are more com-
monly collapsed into a single rite per-
formed on the eleventh day after death,
the day after the ten-day period of ritual
impurity (maranashaucha) has come to
an end.
Elements
Traditional Indian cosmology holds that
there are five basic elements, four of
which are similar to those found in
medieval European conceptions: earth,
fire, water, and wind (as moving air that
is perceptible to human beings). The
fifth element, akasha, has no readily
understandable correlate to European
ideas. It is generally translated as
“space” and is considered to pervade
the environment around us, filling the
[[220]]

empty spaces. An unusual feature in
Indian cosmology is that each of these
elements is associated with a particular
sense: earth with smell, fire with sight,
water with taste, wind with touch, and
akasha with hearing.
Elements, Subtle
The subtle elements (tanmatras)
are one of the stages in the evolution
of the world and the human being in
the Samkhya philosophical school.
The subtle elements are the basis for
the formation of the five gross elements:
earth, air, fire, wind, and akasha.
See tanmatras.
Elephant
In ancient India, one of the emblems
of royalty, in part because an elephant’s
prodigious appetite would soon
bankrupt any individual pretending to
have the wealth of royalty. Elephants
also appear in the Hindu pantheon:
The divine elephant Airavata is the
animal vehicle of Indra, and the god
Ganesh has an elephant’s head on a
human body, a souvenir of his conflict
with Shiva.
Elephanta
Island in the harbor outside the city of
Bombay, most famous for its temple to
Shiva by the same name. The date of the
temple’s construction is disputed, but is
generally ascribed to the seventh or
eighth century C.E. Elephanta is a rock-
cut cave temple, in which the sandstone
hillside was carved away to form the
temple itself, and the images of the
deities. This follows the general pattern
of the rock-cut temples at Ellora in
Maharashtra and required careful plan-
ning, since carving errors could not be
corrected. The Elephanta shrine dis-
plays images of Shiva in his various
forms: as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja),
as the Lord of Asceticism (Yogishvara),
as Bearer of the Ganges (Ganghadhara),
as the pillar-shaped form known as the
linga, and as the combination of maleEroticism
Stone columns carved into the entrance of a cave in Ellora.
and female known as Ardhanarishvara.
The central image, and by far the most
famous, is the three-headed, eighteen-
foot-tall image of Shiva as Maheshvar,
the “great Lord.” The face on the left
shows his horrific and destructive facet
as Bhairava, the face on the right his
benevolent, creative facet as Uma,
whereas the center face shows him as
Tatpurusha—blissful, eternal, and tran-
scending the ephemeral affairs of the
world. Although the primary image is
virtually untouched, many of the others
sustained damage from Portuguese
imperialists who considered the images
idolatrous and used them for target
practice. For further information see
Pramod Chandra, Elephanta Caves,
Gharapuri, 1970.
Ellora
Historical site in modern Maharashtra,
about twenty miles north of Aurangabad.
It is world famous for a group of thirty-
three rock-cut temples, which were
sculpted between the fourth and tenth
centuries C.E. Twelve of the caves have
Buddhist images, and these tend to be
the oldest; four of the caves are Jain, and
the remaining seventeen are Hindu. In
each case, the caves were created by
excavating into the volcanic stone out-
crop of the hillside, carefully cutting
away the stone to leave finished images.
Several of the Hindu caves have images
of exceptional artistic quality. The most
famous is the eighth century
Kailasanatha Temple for which the
entire hillside was cut away, leaving the
temple behind, looking as if it had been
built there from the ground up.
Endogamy
In an anthropological sense, a marriage
pattern in which members of a particu-
lar social group marry only members of
the same group. In northern India, tradi-
tional marriages tend to be endogamous
with regard to the jati (hereditary occu-
pational group), and exogamous with
regard to the village community and the
gotra (mythic family lineage).
Eroticism
Although Hindu religious life is often
associated with detachment and
[[221]]
Erotics, Texts on
Erotic sculptures decorate the facade of the Kandariya Mahadev Temple in Khajuraho.
renunciation, Hindu culture has also
fostered considerable eroticism, which
has a recognized place in everyday life.
One example of this is the Kama Sutra ,
a well-known “manual” on the art of
love, which is but one example of a liter-
ary genre called ratishastra, or “treatises
on [sexual] pleasure.” Other examples of
eroticism in the culture can be seen in
the sculptures carved on the temples
Konarak and Khajuraho, and in the
amount of attention given to poetry on
love. In Hindu culture kama (“desire,”
particularly sexual desire) is one of the
purusharthas, or aims of life, with the
others being artha (wealth), dharma
(religious duty), and moksha (final lib-
eration of the soul). Erotic pleasure
is thus recognized as a legitimate goal,
as long as it is kept in proper perspec-
tive. Although renunciation is one of
the great themes in Hindu life, nonre-
nunciation has been stressed at least
as strongly.
In modern popular Hindu culture,
eroticism is expressed through the eso-
teric ritual tradition known as tantra, in
[[222]]

which sexual union is a symbol for liber-
ation. Sexual intercourse is sometimes
incorporated as an actual element in
tantric ritual, as the most notorious of
the panchamakara or “Five Forbidden
Things.” Although tantric practice has
strong popular associations with illicit
sexuality, such acts are always per-
formed within a strict ritual context. In
tantric practice, the ultimate aim is not
to satisfy one’s carnal desires, but to
demolish the dualism between sacred
and profane that is ultimately a sign of
ignorance. The act of ritualizing normally
taboo behavior is one way to destroy this
duality, as well as a way to emphasize
the superiority of tantric practice over
other forms of religious life. In such
practice, the adept is also imitating
Shiva, who is himself both the perfect
yogi and the model husband.
Erotics, Texts on
One of the established genres in Indian
literature was ratishastra, or “treatises
on [sexual] pleasure,” of which theEvolution
best-known is the Kama Sutra . Sexual
pleasure was seen as an established part
of human life, which did not have to be
hidden, and for which no excuses were
necessary. Kama (as both “desire” and
“sexual desire”) was one of the
purusharthas or aims of life. Satisfying
one’s desires was seen as a legitimate
goal and considered a good thing, inso-
far as the pursuit did not interfere with
other ends. The texts on erotics analyzed
and classified sexuality in terms of aes-
thetic experience, as well as a vehicle
for physical pleasure. For its sophisti-
cated practitioners, such well-defined
sexuality was intended to provide fulfill-
ment for both partners, and here the lit-
erature is unusual for giving women
equal desire and equal pleasure.
Error, Theories of
Indian philosophical schools give seri-
ous consideration to the questions of
how and why people make errors in
judgment. Although these schools may
cite seemingly mundane examples, such
as mistaking the silvery flash of a
seashell for a piece of silver, investigat-
ing judgment errors is ultimately rooted
in religious goals. Specifically, the reli-
gious goal is to gain true awareness of
the actual nature of things, and through
this to bring about final liberation of the
soul (moksha) from the karmic cycle of
reincarnation (samsara). Each school’s
answers to the question of truth and fal-
sity reveal fundamental differences
about the understanding each has of the
inherent nature of things, which have
clear implications for bondage and lib-
eration. Although the differing schools
disagree on the mechanics of “how” one
sees silver instead of a shell, there is gen-
eral agreement about why such a mis-
take takes place. This and other errors
are rooted in the karmic predispositions
stemming from avidya, most specifical-
ly the greed that prompts human beings
to look for items of value. Far more
explanation can be found in the individ-
ual entries, but in brief there are six
major theories of error.
In the Prabhakara branch of the
Mimamsa school, the theory is akhy-
ati or “nondiscrimination,” in which
the source of error is the inability to
make sharp distinctions. The theory
in the Naiyayika school is any-
athakhyati, the “discrimination of
something else,” in which the mind
projects an erroneous perception
(pratyaksha) onto another object.
The Mimamsa philosopher Kumarila
explains error as viparitakhyati or
“contrary discrimination,” in which
the source of error is a bad assessment
of an object’s similarities and differ-
ences. The Samkhya school pro-
pounds the theory of sadasatkhyati,
or “discrimination of the unreal as the
real,” in which the source of error is
merely an extension of the original
error to distinguish between the two basic
realities, purusha and prakrti. Ramanuja,
founder of the Vishishthadvaita Vedanta
school, propounds the theory of satkhy-
ati, “discrimination of the real,” in which
one correctly perceives the silvery flash,
but makes an incorrect assumption
based on this. The final theory of anir-
vachaniyakhyati or “indescribable dis-
crimination,” is advanced by the
Advaita Vedanta school; according to
this, one illusory perception is superim-
posed on another conventionally true
but ultimately illusory perception. For

Philosophy, 1978; and Karl H. Potter

Philosophies, 1972.

Evolution
Fundamental doctrine of the Samkhya
school of Indian philosophy. The
Samkhya school uses a theory of evolu-
tion to explain the human perception of
[[223]]
Expiation
an inner world of subjective experience
and the objective outer world, which it
argues are not true aspects of the real, or
essential, world. Samkhya metaphysics
posits two principles as the essence of
the universe, purusha and prakrti.
Purusha is pure awareness, which is
conscious but inactive and unchanging.
Prakrti is primal matter which, in its
most basic form, is an equilibrium of
three different unconscious forces
(gunas): sattva (goodness), rajas (pas-
sion), and tamas (decay). According to
the Samkhya, the conflation and confu-
sion of purusha and prakrti is the basic
cause for the bondage of the soul to the
cycle of reincarnation (samsara)—
where purusha is seen as if it is acting,
and prakrti is seen as if it is conscious.
While this misunderstanding does not
effect purusha, it causes prakrti to
undergo an evolutionary process, in
which this primal matter becomes
increasingly differentiated, leading to
further confusion of the nature of the
universe. The first stage of evolution is
called mahat (“great one”) and occurs
when the original equilibrium between
the three gunas has been disturbed;
mahat is also known as buddhi, which is
conceived as the cognitive faculty nec-
essary for thought. The mental processes
facilitated by buddhi spur the develop-
ment of ahamkar (“I-making”), in
which one finds the first feelings of ego-
consciousness. With the rise of this sub-
jective feeling comes the division into
subjective and objective worlds: on one
hand, ahamkar evolves the five subtle
elements (tanmatras), the precursors of
the gross elements, and on the other it
evolves into the eleven faculties: five
jnanendriyas or sense organs, five
karmendriyas or organs of action, and
the mind as the eleventh. At liberation
this process of evolution happens
in reverse, with the many successively
devolving into the one. As in
most Indian philosophical systems,
liberation comes when correct under-
standing has replaced a mistaken
one. For further information see

Expiation
See prayashchitta.Family Relationships
## F
See Panchatantra .many families have a customary age for
performing the chudakarana samskara,
the “tonsure” or head-shaving rite of
passage that marks the definitive end of
infancy. Some families perform this in
the first year, others in the third, or the
fifth, or even the seventh. Religious
practice varies widely among families,
although it tends to be very stable with-
in families, since this is one of the ways
in which families create a distinctive
identity for themselves.
FallaciesFamily Deity
In defining the parameters for what is
and is not a valid argument, certain
types of arguments have been dismissed
outright by Indian logicians, since these
arguments are held to be based on
invalid premises. The key flaw shared by
these objectionable arguments is the
fallacy known as self-residence, in
which the cause and its effect are the
same thing. Varieties of this fallacy
include reciprocal dependence, a
vicious circle, and an infinite regress.
The presence of any of these fallacies is
sufficient grounds to dismiss an argu-
ment as invalid.See kuladevata.

Fallacies of Inference
See Hetvabhasa.
Family Custom
(kulachara) Hindu religion is fluid
enough that a family’s customary prac-
tices can heavily influence a person’s
individual religious life. For example,
family custom plays an important role
in worship. The Hindu pantheon con-
tains many different gods, and the one
that an individual worships as “God” is
often strongly influenced by the family’s
practice, although other factors such as
personal inclination can also play a role.
Family custom also plays an important
role in setting parameters for religious
practice, both in everyday religious life,
and in setting rules for performing the
rituals of the life cycle. For example,
Family Relationships
Hindus consider the family the basis of
society. The idealized Hindu family is a
multigenerational joint family, com-
posed of elderly parents, their adult
sons, and their sons’ families. The sons
are considered the core of the family,
since the daughters will live with their
husbands’ families after marriage and
are considered to belong to them. When
the families become too large, or ten-
sions between brothers develop to an
unbearable level, these joint families
divide into smaller households, upon
which the general pattern continues.
Hindu families have different names for
all possible family relationships. These
differing names reveal the exact nature
of the relationship and the person’s pre-
cise relationship in the family—as one
example, although in English the word
“aunt” can designate the sister of either
one’s father or one’s mother, there are
different names for both in northern
Indian languages. Some of this is related
to the higher status connected with the
father’s or the husband’s side of the fam-
ily, and some of it has to do with prox-
imity, since these relatives are more
likely to be living with one another in a
joint family or close by. These differ-
ences mark the lines of importance in
Indian families, which give greater
emphasis to the father’s side. One note-
worthy term is the word for the wife’s
[[225]]
Fani, Muhsin
brother (sala), which in modern times
often serves as a term of abuse.
Fani, Muhsin
(ca. mid-17th c.) Traditionally thought
to be the author of the Dabistan-i-
Mazahib (“School of Manners”), which
was probably written about 1665. The
Dabistan is an invaluable outside source
for the religious life of the times and
gives one of the earliest descriptions of
the Sikhs, as well as many other contem-
porary groups. Fani was a Persian, and a
Parsi by birth, who came to India
because of his intense curiosity about
religious life, and his desire to see what-
ever he could. He is believed to have
been a careful observer and relatively
objective. He states that he had simply
translated (into the Persian in which the
text was written) what his friends and
informants had told him, and the text
seems to support this claim.
Faqir
(variant of fakir, from the Arabic poor)
In the strictest sense of the word, this
refers to a Muslim ascetic, as is hinted
by the Arabic origin of the word.
Colloquially, the word has been used
much more broadly, as an appellation
for any ascetic (witness Winston
Churchill’s characterization of Mohandas
Gandhi as a “half-naked faqir”). Both
usages are still current in modern India.
Although since the partition of India in
[[1947]]
 the word more commonly desig-
nates a Muslim, Hindu ascetics still
describe someone who is detached from
all things and dependent on God for
support as a “faqir baba.”
Fasting
See upavasa.
Fatalism
Philosophical position attributed to the
Ajivika school. The Ajivikas believed
that all things were preordained by
an impersonal destiny (niyati), and
[[226]]

therefore that one’s conscious actions
had no effect on one’s future. Although
this position would seem to undercut
any reason for religious practice,
the Ajivikas were also noted for per-
forming strict asceticism, in the belief
that they were only doing what had been
predetermined for them. For further
information see Arthur Llewellyn
Basham, History and Doctrines of the
Ajivikas, 1981.
Fathers, World of the
The earliest reference to the transmigra-
tion of souls, which is found in both the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad (6.2) and
the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10),
makes a qualitative distinction between
two different paths for the soul. The
path to the world of the gods ultimately
led to the sun, and the person traveling
it did not return again; the path to the
world of the fathers led to the moon,
and the person traveling it was eventually
reborn on earth. The leitmotiv running
through all the Upanishads is the need
for individual spiritual realization, and
this is the key to getting on the path to
the world of the gods. Those who gain
such realization attain the final and ulti-
mate end, whereas those who simply do
good deeds will return to earth,
although their good deeds will give them
karmic benefits.
Festival Calendar
Since few festivals are celebrated by all
Hindus, establishing a single festival cal-
endar is problematic. Festival celebra-
tions are subject to the same differing
forces that drive the rest of Hindu life.
On one hand, there are significant
regional differences in the celebration of
festivals, and on the other there are
major sectarian variations. Some of the
sectarian festivals may be celebrated
within particular regions or they may be
celebrated across the nation. It is also
true that the general public is aware of
most festivals—by virtue of these days
being public holidays, or being markedFestival Calendar
on the calendar—but far fewer people
celebrate any particular festival as a reli-
gious holiday. Finally, some holidays are
so significant that they are celebrated by
almost everyone, although here too
some people will observe them with far
greater energy. For example, although
the Goddess festival known as the fall
Navaratri is celebrated throughout the
country, it is kept with particular gusto
in Bengal, where the cult of the Mother
Goddess is particularly important.
With these considerations in mind,
the festival calendar for the lunar year is
given below, with the holidays given in
order during the successive lunar
months. The purpose in this entry is
only to lay out the order of these festi-
vals during the year; further details for
the lunar months and each festival can
be found in the individual entries.

The festival calendar is further
complicated by the fact that the lunar
year begins on the first day of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month
of Chaitra. This creates an unusual
situation since, at least in northern
India, the lunar months end on the
full moon, making the two weeks of
the waning moon the first half of the
lunar month. The waning fortnight
in Chaitra comes at the end of the lunar
year, and the waxing fortnight that fol-
lows is the first fortnight of the follow-
ing year. Thus, the month of Chaitra is
both the first and the last month of the
lunar year.

Feticide
a military coup ousted a Parliament
dominated by Indians, and installed a
native Fijian as prime minister. Because
of these restrictions, many Indians still
work as tenant farmers for Fijian land-
lords, but they also play an important
role as shopkeepers and professionals.
Fire
Depiction of the god Vishnu’s Fish avatar.
Vishnu takes this form to protect living
creatures from floods that engulf the earth.
Feticide
This refers to selective abortion of
female fetuses, which was made possi-
ble by the advent of reliable prenatal
sex determination technology. This
practice is driven by the desire for sons
in Hindu culture, a desire spurred by
economic, social, and religious con-
cerns. Selective abortions were out-
lawed in India in 1995.
Fiji
One of the countries with significant
Hindu diaspora populations. Indians
were first brought to Fiji in 1879 as
indentured laborers to work in the sug-
arcane fields. In the 1990s Indians com-
prised about 45 percent of Fiji’s
population. Despite their near parity in
terms of population, Indians in Fiji have
been legally relegated to a minority role
and for the most part have been prohib-
ited from owning land. The split
between the Indian and Fijian commu-
nities became transparent in 1987, when
[[228]]

One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, wind, water, and akasha. In
some philosophical schools, each of the
elements is paired with one of the five
senses. Fire is associated with sight,
since the eye’s action in apprehending a
visual object is compared to flame dart-
ing out and scorching something.
Within the body, fire is also associated
with digestion, which is generally con-
ceived of as “cooking” the foods in the
digestive system.
Fish Avatar
The first of Vishnu’s ten full avatars or
“incarnations” on earth. Each avatar
appears when the cosmos is in crisis,
usually because of a demon (asura) who
has grown disproportionately strong,
and whose power is throwing the uni-
verse out of its natural balance.
According to the doctrine of the avatars,
Vishnu takes material form when the
earth has fallen out of equilibrium, to
destroy the source of evil and restore the
cosmic balance.
The tale of the fish avatar begins
in the distant past, when the righteous
king Manu discovers a small fish in the
water he holds between his cupped
hands as he performs the tarpana or
water-offering rite for his ancestors. The
compassionate king puts the tiny fish
into a pot of water, but the fish soon out-
grows it. As the fish keeps growing,
Manu transfers it to larger and larger
vessels, and finally puts the fish into the
Ganges. When the fish grows too large
for the Ganges and has to be put into the
ocean, Manu realizes that the fish isFour States of Consciousness
Vishnu himself, and begins to sing
Vishnu’s praises.
The fish then informs Manu
that the destruction of the world is
imminent—first through blazing fire
that will scorch all life, then through
floods that will turn the entire earth
into a single cosmic sea. Vishnu informs
Manu that the gods have built a boat
from the Vedas, and directs Manu to
collect all the creatures of the earth
and put them on the boat for safekeep-
ing. He promises Manu that all the
creatures on this boat will survive the
coming destruction, and when the
world returns to normal with the
advent of the Krta Age, Manu will be
the ruler of the earth.
Manu does as he has been directed,
and when the destruction of the world is
imminent, Vishnu appears in the form
of a great horned fish. Manu ties the
boat to the fish’s horn and, protected by
Vishnu’s power, all the beings on the
boat survive to repopulate the earth.
Five Forbidden Things
See panchamakara.
Float Festival
Festival celebrated in the city of
Madurai in the southern Indian state of
Tamil Nadu, on the full moon in the
lunar month of Magh ( January–
February). This is the birthday of King
Tirumalai Nayak (r. 1623–1659), dur-
ing whose reign large parts of
Madurai’s Minakshi Temple was built.
During the festival the goddess
Minakshi and her consort Sundareshvara
(an epithet of Shiva) are taken in pro-
cession to an artificial lake east of
Madurai, where they are put on richly
decorated floats and drawn back and
forth over the lake’s waters.
Four Dhams
(“[divine] abodes”) Four major pilgrim-
age sites in the four geographical cor-
ners of India, which lay out the
boundaries of India’s sacred geography:
Badrinath in the Himalayas; the city of
Puri in the east, on the Bay of Bengal;
Rameshvaram in the south; and
Dwaraka in the west. Each site is associ-
ated with one of the four Sanyasi maths
all supposedly founded by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya: Badrinath
has the Jyotir math in the town of
Joshimath (about thirty-five miles
south of Badrinath), Puri has the
Govardhan math, Dwaraka has the
Sharada math, and Rameshvaram has
the Shringeri math (in Shringeri). The
first three of these maths are close to
their associated sacred sites (tirthas),
but Shringeri is about 450 miles away
from Rameshvaram.
Four Great Crimes
In the dharma literature, four actions
are deemed such heinous offenses that
the person performing them becomes
an outcast from society. These four
actions are murdering a brahmin
(brahmahatya), stealing a brahmin’s
gold (steya), drinking liquor (sura-
pana), and adultery with the wife of
one’s guru (gurutalpaga). Aside from
expulsion from society, another indica-
tion of the gravity of these acts was that
their penalties were so severe that they
normally ended in death, and in some
cases this outcome was specifically pre-
scribed. In addition to prescribing such
punishments for the actual offenders,
the dharma literature also prescribed
expulsion for anyone who knowingly
associated with such people for a period
longer than one year.
Four States of Consciousness
Flood, Legend of
See Fish avatar.
A hierarchy of states of experience that
is first outlined in the Mandukya
Upanishad. In its description, the upan-
ishad moves from greatest duality to
utter nonduality; these four states are
[[229]]
Friday
also correlated with the phonetic
elements of the sacred sound Om.
Om symbolizes the four states of
consciousness and is the sum and
quintessence of them all. The first stage
of consciousness is waking conscious-
ness, in which one perceives both
subject and object; then dreaming,
in which one’s experience is totally
subjective; then deep sleep, in which
(until waking) even consciousness
of oneself as subject has been lost.
The final state is so removed from
human experience that it cannot be des-
ignated by language, and so is simply
called “the fourth” (turiya). In the
Mandukya Upanishad, this fourth state
is clearly identified as the ultimate truth,
the atman or inner Self, knowledge of
which brings final liberation of the soul.
Friday
(Shukravar) The fifth day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is Venus
(Shukra). Friday is also the day of
the week dedicated to the Goddess and
is thus potentially a powerfully
auspicious day. Although the Goddess
can be worshiped in many forms, one
of the most popular in northern India
is Santoshi Ma. Worship of Santoshi
Ma has spread dramatically since its
origin in the mid-1970s.
Full Moon
(Purnimasa or Purnima) In northern
India, the full moon is the final day of
the lunar month, whereas in southern
India it is often considered the mid-
point. In either case, the full moon car-
ries associations of fullness, completion,
and abundance and is always an auspi-
cious time. One sign of its auspicious-
ness is the commonly accepted belief
that the religious merit generated from
rites performed on the day of a full
moon is equal to rites performed for an
entire month. There are festivals associ-
ated with the full moon of each lunar
month, but the most important are in
Baisakh (Buddha Purnima), Ashadh
[[230]]

(Guru Purnima), Shravan (Raksha
Bandhan), Kartik (Kartik Purnima),
and Phalgun (Holi).
Funerary Rites

skara, and shraddha.Gajendramoksha
## G
Gada
(“club”) In Hindu iconography, one of
the identifying objects carried by the
god Vishnu, along with the conch shell
(shankha), lotus (padma), and discus
(chakra). In the Mahabharata , the
later of the two great Hindu epics, the
gada is also the weapon of choice for
Bhima, one of the five Pandava broth-
ers who are the epic’s protagonists. Of
these five brothers, Bhima is noted for
his prodigious size and strength, which
gives him obvious advantages in wield-
ing the gada.
Gahadavalas were a short-lived and
transitional dynasty who filled a politi-
cal vacuum during the tumultuous years
following the turn of the first millennium.
During this period the Gangetic plain
was plagued by political instability and
was regularly subjected to Muslim raids.
The Gahadavalas supplanted the
Rashtrakutas, whom they conquered in
[[1089]]
, and consolidated their power
through the middle Ganges basin. In
[[1194]]
 the Gahadavalas were defeated by
the Ghurids, an Afghani Muslim dynasty.
Following their defeat, most of the
Gahadavala territory became part of the
Ghurid empire.
Gaja Hasta
A particular hand gesture (hasta) used
in Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual.
In the gaja (“elephant”) hasta, the arm
is extended straight out, with the
hand gently curving down; the curved
arm is fancifully compared to the trunk
of an elephant.
Gadge Maharaj
(1876–1956) Modern ascetic teacher
and religious preceptor in the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
Gadge Maharaj got his name from the
clay pot (gadge) that was his only pos-
session, signifying his rejection of all
wealth and worldly entanglements.
Gadge had been born into a caste of
washermen, who are considered a low
status group since their everyday work
brings them in contact with other peo-
ple’s soiled garments. In his teachings,
Gadge not only stresses the importance
of devotion to God—the hallmark of
the bhakti (devotional) movement—
but also advocates temperance, poverty,
and vegetarianism.
Gahadavala Dynasty
(r. 1089–1194) Northern Indian dynasty
whose core region was the western and
central parts of the Gangetic plain. The
Gajendramoksha
(“release of the elephant-king”) The
name of a particular incident in Hindu
mythology involving a battle between
king Indradyumna, in the form of
a giant elephant, and a Gandharva
(celestial musician) named Huhu, in
the form of a giant crocodile. Both
Indradyumna and Huhu have assumed
these forms as the result of a curse.
Indradyumna has been cursed by the
sage Agastya, who becomes angry when
the meditating king fails to greet him
with proper respect. Huhu has been
cursed by the sage Devala, when the
amorous water play between Huhu and
some celestial damsels has disturbed
the sage’s meditation.
The struggle between the two ani-
mals begins when the elephant comes
to the water to drink and the crocodile
grabs him by the leg. The crocodile
attempts to pull the elephant into deep-
er water while the elephant struggles to
break free. The pair are so evenly
[[231]]
Galta
matched that neither can best the other.
After the battle has raged for a thousand
years the god Vishnu appears, kills the
crocodile, and restores Indradyumna to
his previous form. The story thus takes
its name, the “release of the elephant
king,” because Indradyumna was freed
from the crocodile’s grasp and the
effects of the curse.
Galta
A village in the state of Rajasthan, a few
miles east of Jaipur, the capital. Galta is
most famous for its connection with the
Bairagi Naga ascetics, renunciant trader-
soldiers who were devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu. According to Bairagi
tradition, in 1756 a conference took
place at Galta in which the different
groups of Bairagi Naga ascetics were
welded into one cohesive military unit
called the Ramanadis or “army of Ram”
under the leadership of a Bairagi named
Balanand. Balanand organized the
Ramanandis into three anis or armies—
the Digambara Ani, Nirvani Ani, and
Nirmohi Ani—which are still the major
Bairagi divisions. According to tradi-
tion, this unification was necessary
because of continual attacks by the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
a competing group of renunciant trader-
soldiers who were devotees of the god
Shiva. The dispute occurred during
the festival Kumbha Mela, ostensibly
over precedence in the bathing (snana)
procession, which was a sign of rela-
tive status. However, an underlying
cause may have been power and con-
trol of an area’s resources.
The exact circumstances under
which the armies of Ram were formed
are difficult to determine. Independent
sources clearly show that the Bairagis
became more cohesively organized dur-
ing the late eighteenth century and
that some of these bairagi bands were
using their mobility, resources, and
power to engage in long-distance trad-
ing. However, the decentralized nature
of ascetic life makes the summary for-
mation of such an army highly unlikely,
[[232]]

unless this was the final fruition of an
already existing trend.
Gambling
A practice with a long history in Indian
culture, but that has almost always been
portrayed in a negative light by Hindu
texts. The earliest reference appears in
the Rg Veda, the oldest Hindu religious
text, in a hymn often described as “The
Gambler’s Lament.” The hymn is a gam-
bler’s first-person account of the ways in
which his obsession with gaming ruined
his life. It ends with a warning to the lis-
tener not to be seduced by gambling’s
siren song. Gambling is also negatively
portrayed in the Mahabharata, the later
of the two great Hindu epics. A passion
for gaming is the only fault afflicting
Yudhishthira (the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists), but it brings disastrous
results. In a dice game with the king-
dom’s most skillful player, Shakuni,
Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, his
brothers, and even himself; as a result of
the game, he and his brothers have to go
into exile.
These mythic models mirror the
attitudes toward gambling in Hindu
society. Sober and upright Hindus have
generally avoided games of chance,
since they are not a stable or respectable
way to risk one’s capital or earn a living.
The only time that prudence and
caution can be legitimately disregarded
is on the festival of Diwali, which is
sacred to Lakshmi, the goddess of
wealth and prosperity. Gambling is a
traditional part of the Diwali celebra-
tions, used to pay homage to Lakshmi in
her guise as Lady Luck. Diwali is most
often celebrated in people’s homes, and
thus any gambling will take place with
one’s family and close associates, and
with purely nominal betting. Aside from
Diwali, gambling is strictly proscribed in
polite society, and even on Diwali its dis-
ruptive capacities are strictly contained.Gandharva Marriage
Gana
(“host”) In Hindu mythology, a collec-
tive term for a group of minor gods
who are the god Shiva’s servants and
attendants. The members of this gana
are often represented in frightening
forms—smeared with ash, bearing
skulls and weapons, physically mal-
formed, and grinning and laughing
horribly. The members of the gana are
Shiva’s followers, supporters, and
minions, who are ready to do his bid-
ding when commanded. The leader of
the gana is the god Ganesh (“Lord of
the Host”).

Eventually the pots break open, reveal-
ing one hundred handsome boys and a
single daughter, Dussala.
All of Gandhari’s children are killed
by her nephews the Pandavas in the
Mahabharata war. Just as Gandhari is
about to curse the Pandavas, Vyasa
reminds her that her sons’ deaths are
the result of their own misconduct. After
the war, Gandhari retires to the forest
with her husband and a few others. They
live in retirement for six years before
they are killed in a forest fire.

Ganapati
(“Master of [Shiva’s] host”) Another
name for the god Ganesh. See Ganesh.
Gandaki River
One of the tributaries of the Ganges, it
flows southward from Nepal, joining the
Ganges at the city of Patna in the state of
Bihar. Although the river’s source is now
extremely poor, in the time of the
Buddha it contained major urban cen-
ters, particularly the city of Vaishali.
Gandhari
A character in the Mahabharata, the
later of the two great Hindu epics.
Gandhari is the wife of the blind king
Dhrtarashtra and the mother of the
Kauravas, a group of boys who are the
epic’s antagonists. Gandhari shows her
devotion to her blind husband by always
covering her eyes with a blindfold, thus
sharing his sightlessness. As is often the
case in Hindu mythology, her sons are
born in an unusual manner. Gandhari
receives a blessing (ashirvad) from the
sage Vyasa that she will give birth to one
hundred sons. Soon after, she becomes
pregnant. However, her pregnancy lasts
for more than two years. When she
grows impatient and tries to hasten the
delivery, she gives birth to a great lump
of flesh. Vyasa advises Gandhari to
divide the lump and place each piece in
In Hindu mythology, a class of demigods
who are celestial singers and musicians.
The gandharvas occasionally interact
with humans. One of their divine gifts is
the ability to bestow good singing voices
to girls. Since the Gandharvas are always
watching from above, they are consid-
ered to be the witnesses in a Gandharva
marriage, one of the eight forms of mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture. The gandharva marriage was a
marriage contracted by consensual sex-
ual intercourse. See also Marriage, eight
classical forms.
Gandharva Marriage
One of the eight forms of marriage rec-
ognized in the dharma literature, the
treatises on religious duty. A Gandharva
marriage takes place when a man and
woman have sexual intercourse by
mutual consent, but without consulting
anyone else. The marriage is so named
because gandharvas, who are demigods
and celestial musicians, are said to be
the witnesses. Although the gandharva
rite created a valid marriage, it was con-
sidered one of the four reprehensible
(aprashasta) forms of marriage because
it was done without parental consent,
performed without religious rituals, and
was rooted in lust. These marriages were
recognized not to sanction and legit-
imize promiscuous behavior, but to pro-
vide the woman with the legal status of a
[[233]]

wife. Although Sanskrit literary sources
are replete with Gandharva marriages—
perhaps the most famous being the
marriage of King Dushyanta and
Shakuntala—it is doubtful that this
form was ever widely practiced. See also
marriage, eight classical forms.
Gandhi, Mohandas K.
(1869–1948) Leader of the Indian
National Congress, one of the architects
of the struggle for Indian independence,
and one of the best-known Indians in
history. Gandhi was born in Gujarat,
where his father was a minister to one of
the native princes. Shortly after Gandhi’s
father died, the British ousted the ruling
prince for mismanagement, and the
family lost their position. Gandhi was
sent to London to study law, and during
this time he came into contact with a
variety of new ideas that would strongly
influence his future. Ironically, one of
these influences was the Bhagavad Gita,
an important Hindu religious text from
which he drew continuing inspiration in
his later life. After returning to India in
[[1891]]
, Gandhi failed in his attempt to set
up a law practice in Bombay, and he
went back to Gujarat. In 1894 Gandhi
traveled to South Africa to do some
work for a Muslim trading firm. He
intended to be gone only a short time,
but ended up staying in South Africa for
twenty years. During this time he dis-
covered his true calling, political
activism. This was sparked by his own
experience of racial discrimination—
being thrown out of a railway car
reserved for “whites only”—and was
fueled by the social, political, and legal
disadvantages suffered by South Africa’s
[[40]]
,000 Indians, most of whom were illit-
erate agricultural workers. During his
time in South Africa, Gandhi developed
and refined his basic tactics: mass non-
cooperation, nonviolent resistance, will-
ingness to face imprisonment, and
skillful use of the print media to influ-
ence public opinion. In 1914 he
returned to India, where he soon
became one of the leading figures in the
[[234]]

struggle against the British—first for
home rule, and finally for outright inde-
pendence.
Gandhi’s deeply held moral princi-
ples shaped his entire career. He saw his
political activism not as a vehicle for
personal advancement, but as a means
for selfless action for the welfare of the
world. This stress on selfless action drew
heavily on the message of the Bhagavad
Gita, in which the god Krishna recom-
mends a similar path to his friend and
devotee (bhakta), Arjuna. Throughout
his life Gandhi remained committed to
nonviolence. Gandhi felt strongly that
the nature of any goal would be influ-
enced by the means by which it had
been attained. Another of his funda-
mental principles was truth, as seen in
his insistence that evil and injustice had
to be resisted, even by violence when all
other means had failed. A third essential
tenet was self-control, which he consid-
ered the prerequisite to leading others.
His commitment to his principles gave
him the strength to endure imprison-
ment, injury, and more than thirty years
of struggle with the British government;
it also moved him to campaign against
many other injustices, particularly the
notion of untouchability.
When independence finally arrived
in 1947 it was tainted by the partition of
British India into India and Pakistan,
fueled in part by Muslim concerns about
their minority status in an independent
Hindu India. The partition sparked a
massive exodus, in which fifteen million
people migrated from one country to
the other. It also sparked unspeakable
communal violence, in which an esti-
mated one million people died. Despite
his best efforts, Gandhi was unable to
prevent partition or to create good rela-
tions between the two countries. Within
six months of independence, Gandhi
was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a
Hindu nationalist who felt that Gandhi
was being too soft on Pakistan.
Gandhi had critics and opponents
throughout his career, many of whom
felt that he did not deserve the saint-
hood that people attributed to him.Gandhi, Mohandas K.

Gandiva
A sculpture of the god Ganesh from the village of
Khajuraho. As “Lord of Obstacles,” Ganesh has the
power to remove or bestow difficulties.
Among his critics were B. R. Ambedkar,
who felt that Gandhi had used the
untouchables as pawns in negotiations
with the British because he opposed
letting the untouchables separate from
the larger body politic. His critics also
included Subhash Chandra Bose, who
advocated an armed struggle against
the British, and Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar, a Hindu nationalist who was
Godse’s inspiration. For further infor-
mation see Mohandas K. Gandhi, An

Indian national holiday falling on

because the event is a national holiday,

In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Gandiva is the
name of the bow carried by Arjuna.
Arjuna is the world’s greatest archer
and the third of the five Pandava broth-
ers, the Mahabharata’s protagonists.
Gandiva was originally fashioned by
the god Brahma and is given to Arjuna
by the god Varuna (identified with the
ocean) at the request of another deity,
Agni (“fire”). Agni makes this request
because he wants to “eat” (burn) the
Khandava forest, but is afraid of inter-
ference in the form of rain from the god
Indra, ruler of the storm. Arjuna uses
the bow to create a canopy of arrows
that shields the forest from Indra’s
storms, thus allowing Agni to consume
the forest in peace. Arjuna uses this
bow for many years. At the end of his
life he returns it to Varuna by throwing
it into the sea.
Ganesh
(“Lord of [Shiva’s] Host”) Elephant-
headed god who leads Shiva’s horde of
divine followers; another name for
Ganesh is Ganapati. Ganesh is usually
portrayed as short and fat, with a bowl of
sweets and his animal vehicle, the rat,
close by. Among the items most often
portrayed in his hands are a lotus
(padma) and his own broken tusk. He
also often holds a noose and an
elephant goad (ankusha), which sym-
bolize his power to restrain or move
obstructing forces.
Although Ganesh is worshiped as a
primary deity by a small sectarian com-
munity, the Ganpatyas, most Hindus
worship him as a subsidiary deity along
with their principal divinities. Ganesh’s
importance in Hindu life, however, is far
greater than his relatively minor place in
the pantheon. Hindus consider GaneshGanesh Chaturthi
as “Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar),
who has the power both to remove and
to bestow difficulties, depending on
whether or not a person has pleased
him. Hindus invoke Ganesh at the start
of any important undertaking—whether
it is performing a religious ritual, start-
ing a business, performing a marriage,
building a home, or even taking a school
examination—so that through his grace,
potential obstacles may be removed or
avoided and the undertaking will pro-
ceed smoothly and successfully. This
power over obstacles is symbolized both
by his elephant head and his animal
vehicle, the rat. The elephant’s strength
allows it to break down any impedi-
ments, while the rat is able to slip
through the smallest cracks to gain
access to locked places. Ganesh’s ani-
conic image is the threshold, the transi-
tional strip dividing and separating
different spaces, which further symbol-
izes his power to control transitions
from one state to another.
Ganesh is considered to be the son
of the god Shiva and his wife Parvati,
but he is born in an unusual manner.
One day when Parvati is bathing
(snana), she forms a child from the dirt
from her body, animates him, and
directs him to permit no one to enter
her bathing place. When Shiva comes
to the door Ganesh bars his way, and in
the ensuing battle Shiva cuts off
Ganesh’s head. Parvati is so upset that
Shiva promises to replace the missing
head with the head of the first animal
he encounters, which happens to be an
elephant. Upon reviving Ganesh, Shiva
appoints him as the leader of his troop
of followers. As a further boon, Shiva
tells Ganesh that he will be worshiped
before any other deity.
Ganesh’s elephant head has a broken
tusk, and there are differing myths
recounting how this happened. In one
story it comes from an altercation with
the Parashuram avatar, who tries to
enter Shiva’s chambers while Ganesh is
guarding the door. According to another
account, the injury is self-inflicted. In a
fit of rage at the moon, Ganesh breaks
off his tusk and throws it at the moon.
According to tradition, Ganesh uses
this tusk as a pen to write down the
text of the epic Mahabharata as it is
dictated by the sage Vyasa. For further
information on Ganesh and his cult,
see Paul Courtright, Ganesa, 1985;
other information can be found in
works on Hindu mythology.
Ganesh Chaturthi
Festival falling on the fourth (chaturthi)
day of the bright or waxing half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September), dedicated to the
worship of the god Ganesh. This festival
is observed throughout India, but is par-
ticularly celebrated in Maharashtra.
During this festival clay images of
Ganesh are consecrated and worshiped.
At the festival’s end the images are car-
ried in procession for ceremonial
immersion in bodies of water—whether
the sea, a river, or the village pond.
Although Ganesh is a relatively
minor deity in the Hindu pantheon,
his role as the Lord of Obstacles
(Vighneshvar) makes him important in
everyday life, since his involvement can
either further or hinder one’s efforts. For
this reason, Ganesh is always worshiped
at the start of any endeavor and at the
beginning of all religious ceremonies.
While Ganesh plays an important role in
people’s everyday lives, the festival
Ganesh Chaturthi gained prominence in
Maharashtra for political reasons. Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, one of the most
important figures in the nineteenth-
century Hindu renaissance, promoted
the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi as a
visible way to assert and celebrate a
Hindu nationalist identity during the
time of British imperial rule. Given the
power of British rule, outright rebellion
was simply impossible, and the British
government heavily restricted all forms
of political dissent. The Ganesh festival
provided a way to circumvent these
restrictions, since the British had a long-
standing policy of not interfering with
religious observances. The celebration
[[237]]
Ganga
of this festival in Maharashtra, particu-
larly the processions to immerse the
images in the sea, became an important
theater to demonstrate and affirm
Hindu cultural and political identity.
Ganga
In Hindu mythology, the goddess whose
material form is the Ganges River. The
Ganges is sacred because the river is
considered to be a goddess who has the
power to take away the sins of those who
bathe (snana) in her. There are numer-
ous legends to explain her origin. The
best-known is the tale of King Bhagirath,
who by his ascetic practice succeeds in
bringing the Ganges down from heaven
to earth. Bhagirath is the great-great-
grandson of King Sagar, whose 60,000
sons had been burned to ash by the sage
Kapila’s magic power after they had
erroneously accused Kapila of being a
thief. Kapila later tells Anshuman, King
Sagar’s grandson and sole surviving
descendant, that the only way to bring
peace to the souls of Sagar’s sons is to
bring the Ganges down from heaven to
earth. Anshuman strives unsuccessfully
to do this, as does his son Dilip after
him. Dilip’s son Bhagirath takes their
efforts to heart and retires to the
Himalayas, where he performs asceti-
cism until the gods finally agree to send
the Ganges down to earth. Yet
Bhagiratha’s efforts are not yet over.
Next, he has to gain the favor of the god
Shiva, so that Shiva will agree to take the
shock of the falling river on his head.
Otherwise, its force will destroy the
earth. When all is finally in place, the
Ganges falls to earth onto the head of
Shiva. Bhagirath leads Ganga out of the
mountains to the sea, where she touches
his ancestors’ ashes and they finally find
peace. This myth highlights both the
salvific touch of the Ganga and her inti-
mate association with the last rites
(antyeshthi samskara) for the dead.
According to another story, the
Ganges comes down to earth because of
a curse pronounced during a family
quarrel between Vishnu and his wives
[[238]]

Ganga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati. When
one day Ganga and Vishnu begin
exchanging lustful glances in public,
Saraswati gets angry and begins to beat
Ganga. As Lakshmi tries to stop her,
Saraswati let loose a string of curses:
that Vishnu will be born as a stone (the
shalagram), that Lakshmi will be born
as a plant (the tulsi plant), and that
Ganga will be born as a river and take
the sins of the world on her. In the strug-
gle, Saraswati is cursed to become a
river. Vishnu sweetens Ganga’s curse by
telling her that she will be considered
very holy on earth and have the power to
remove people’s sins. Vishnu also tells
her that she will fall from heaven onto
the head of the god Shiva and become
his consort.
Ganga Dashahara
Festival celebrated on the tenth day of
the bright or waxing half of the lunar
month of Jyeshth (May–June), which
marks the day that the goddess Ganga is
believed to have descended from heaven
to earth to become the Ganges River.
The primary religious rite performed on
this day is bathing (snana) in sacred
rivers, particularly the Ganges.
Ganga Dynasty
(11th–15th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty
that ruled the coastal strip on the Bay of
Bengal in the modern states of Orissa
and Andhra Pradesh. Although the
Ganga dynasty was never more than a
regional power, it left an artistic legacy
in a series of stunning temples in mod-
ern Orissa. The Ganga dynasty was
responsible for the temple to the god
Jagannath in the city of Puri and the
Sun Temple at Konarak, built by king
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264). The
dynasty also built temples scattered
throughout the modern city of
Bhubaneshvar, including the temple to
the god Shiva as Tribhuvaneshvar, “the
Lord of the Triple World,” from which
the city takes its name.Ganges

Gangaikondacholapuran
Temple town in the eastern part of Tamil
Nadu, about forty-five miles north and
east of the city of Tanjore. This was one
of the temples in the Tanjore region built
by the Chola kings during their era of
preeminence between the ninth and
thirteenth centuries. The temple at
Gangaikondacholapuran was built in
[[1025]]
 by King Rajendra I (r. 1014–1042)
to commemorate his march to the
Ganges in 1023 after vanquishing the
king of Bengal. One of the images out-
side the temple door shows the kneeling
Rajendra being garlanded by the god
Shiva and his wife Parvati, doubtless
intended to give Rajendra divine sup-
port for his entitlement to rule. See also
Chola dynasty.
Ganga Sagar
Sacred site (tirtha) on Sagar Island,
which is located at the outer edge of the
Hugli River delta in the Bay of Bengal.
Ganga Sagar is where the Ganges River
merges with the sea (sagar). As with all
the places where the Ganges makes
some natural transition, this spot is con-
sidered especially holy. Ganga Sagar’s
biggest festival comes on Makara
Sankranti, the day in January when the
sun resumes its northward course. On
this day, hundreds of thousands of pil-
grims come to bathe (snana). The site is
also famous for a temple to the irascible
sage Kapila, whose fiery power inciner-
ates the 60,000 sons of King Sagar and
sets in motion a series of events leading
to King Bhagirath bringing the Ganges
down to earth.
Ganges
Northern Indian river that has its source
in various small rivers in the Himalaya
Mountains. It comes onto the northern
Indian plain at the city of Haridwar,
flows east across the state of Uttar
Pradesh to the city of Allahabad, where
it unites with the Yamuna River, and
then flows east through the states of
Bihar and West Bengal before joining
the sea at Ganga Sagar. At 1,560 miles in
length, the Ganges is shorter than many
other major rivers, but for Hindus no
river carries greater religious signifi-
cance. To pious Hindus the Ganges is
not merely a river, but the goddess
Ganga come down from heaven, and by
whose touch they are purified of all sin
and defilement. For the Ganges no
superlatives are spared—every drop is
sacred, every inch along its banks is
[[239]]
Gangotri
Temple in Gangotri. Located in the Himalayas,
Gangotri is traditionally considered the source of the Ganges River.
holy, and one gains great religious merit
by seeing it, drinking from it, touching
it, or merely by thinking about it. It is
also considered the best place to per-
form certain rites for the dead.
Hindu devotion to and reverence for
the Ganges has established it as a place
of unique importance. The religious
importance of the Ganges is reflected in
the religious practices connected with it
and the many well-known pilgrimage
places (tirtha) that are found on its
banks, particularly the city of Benares.
The Ganges is considered the paradigm
for the sacred river. Other Indian sacred
rivers, such as the Godavari and the
Cauvery, are claimed to “be” the
Ganges—that is, one can gain the
same religious benefits from bathing
(snana) in them that one gains by
bathing in the Ganges.
Gangotri
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Himalayas at
the headwaters of the Bhagirathi River,
one of the Himalayan tributaries of the
[[240]]

Ganges. Ritually speaking, Gangotri is
considered to be the source of the
Ganges, although the river’s actual
source is the glacier at Gaumukh,
another twelve miles upstream. Its high
altitude also means that it is only acces-
sible between late April and October,
after which it is closed for the winter
months. One ritual center in Gangotri
is the river itself, in which pilgrims
bathe (snana), braving the frigid
waters. The other center is the temple
to the goddess Ganga, first built about
[[250]]
 years ago by the Gurkha monarch
Amar Singh Thapa and restored in the
late nineteenth century by the royal
house of Jaipur. By the side of the river
is a large stone slab, on which the sage
Bhagirath is said to have performed his
austerities to bring the Ganges down to
earth. As with all the places where the
Ganges makes some transition,
Gangotri is considered particularly
holy. Its sanctity is amplified because it
is difficult to get to and is only accessi-
ble during the summer months.Garhwal
Ganika
(“harlot”) In Hindu mythology, a figure
who serves as an example of the
boundless power of God’s grace and
the ease with which one can be saved
by even unconscious devotion. Ganika
is a notorious prostitute who devotes
little time or attention to religious life.
Her only pious act is to teach her pet
parrot to repeat the name of the god
Vishnu, and in trying to teach it she
repeats the divine name over and over
again. This continual repetition of the
name is enough to gain Vishnu’s grace.
Upon Ganika’s death, Vishnu’s ser-
vants rescue her from the minions of
Death and convey her to his celestial
realm, Vaikuntha.
Ganpatya
Sectarian Hindus who worship the god
Ganesh as their primary deity. Most
Hindus pay considerable homage to
Ganesh, in part because his status as
“Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar) gives
him power to help or hinder human
endeavors. However, he is usually wor-
shiped as a secondary deity. The
Ganpatyas, in contrast, venerate Ganesh
as their primary deity and worship no
other deities. Most of the Ganpatyas live
in the state of Maharashtra, where a
network of shrines centered around the
city of Pune and the nearby village of
Chinchvad serves as their sacred center.
The Ganpatya sect was founded by the
sixteenth-century figure Moraya Gosavi,
whose spiritual initiation came through
a series of visions of Ganesh. One of his
visions revealed that partial incarna-
tions of Ganesh would be born in
Moraya’s family for seven generations.
For further information see Paul
Courtright, Ganesa, 1985.
Garbhadhana Samskara
The first of the sixteen traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras)
performed at important moments
throughout one’s life. The Garbhadhana
Samskara was performed to ensure the
conception of a child. This rite was per-
formed on a specific day following the
onset of the wife’s menstrual period,
although different sources specify dif-
ferent days. Although part of this rite
obviously involved sexual intercourse
between husband and wife, as a whole it
was meant to create a sacred context for
the act of procreation.
Garbhagrha
(“womb-house”) In traditional Hindu
architecture, the garbhagrha is the
inner sanctum of a temple, which con-
tains the image of the temple’s primary
deity. In the Nagara architectural style
found in northern and eastern India—in
which the whole temple building culmi-
nates in one highest point—the garbha-
grha was located directly below the
summit of the highest tower (shikhara).
In the Dravida style found in southern
India—in which the temples are shorter,
but tend to sprawl over vast areas—the
garbhagrha’s location is marked by a
tower higher than the rest of the roof.
Garhmukteshvar
Sacred site (tirtha) on the Ganges River
in the Ghaziabad district of the state of
Uttar Pradesh about sixty miles due
east of Delhi. Garhmukteshvar’s primary
temple is dedicated to the god Shiva in
his form as the “Lord of Liberation”
(mukteshvar), but the site’s major
importance comes from its location on
the Ganges as a place for bathing
(snana) and performing memorial rites
(shraddhas) for the dead. Large crowds
gather there to bathe on festival days,
particularly on Kartik Purnima, the full
moon in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November).
Garhwal
In the most technical sense, Garhwal is
the name of a particular hill district in
the northern Indian state of Uttar
Pradesh. Garhwal is more commonly
used as the name for a cultural region in
the Uttar Pradesh hills, made up of the
[[241]]
Garibdas
districts of Garhwal, TehriGarhwal,
Dehra Dun, Chamoli, and Uttarkashi.
The Garhwal region contains all the
major tributaries of the Ganges: the
Bhagirathi, the Mandakini, the
Pindara, and the Alakananda. It also
contains many of the holiest sacred sites
(tirthas) in the Himalayas, including
Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and
Badrinath. In the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries, under the patronage of
the king of the state of Tehri, the region
was also one of the centers for the
Pahari school of miniature painting.
Garibdas
(early 18th c.) Founder of the Garibdasi
religious community. Garibdas was born
in the Rohtak district in what is now the
state of Haryana. Garibdas did not have
a human guru. Instead, he claimed to
have received his religious initiation
from the poet-saint Kabir, who
appeared to him in a dream. Garibdas
was a householder, as were his immedi-
ate disciples. Under one of their later
leaders the Garibdasis renounced their
possessions and became an ascetic
community. Garibdas preached and
taught on a number of subjects and was
a well-respected and influential reli-
gious reformer.
Garibdasi
Religious community founded by
the religious reformer Garibdas (early
[[18]]
th c.). The Garibdasi community
was originally made up of household-
ers, but was fundamentally altered by
one of the later leaders, Swami
Dayaludasa. Under his direction, the
community renounced their posses-
sions and became an ascetic sect. The
Garibdasis have more than one hun-
dred centers in northern India, mainly
concentrated in the regions of Uttar
Pradesh and Haryana around pre-
sent-day New Delhi, where Garibdas
lived during his life.
[[242]]

Garuda
A mythical bird, often portrayed as an
Indian kite or eagle. All of the Hindu
deities have animal “vehicles,” who are
their symbols and their associates.
Garuda is considered the vehicle for the
god Vishnu. As Vishnu’s vehicle, Garuda
reflects some of the protective, life-
affirming qualities associated with
Vishnu. Garuda is the son of the sage
Kashyapa and the divine maiden Vinata.
The most famous story associated with
Garuda explains the proverbial antipathy
between eagles and snakes. Vinata has
given birth to a line of eagles, whereas
her sister Kadru has engendered a line of
serpents. One day the sisters get into an
argument about the tail color of a certain
celestial horse—Vinata argues that it is
white and Kadru asserts that it is black.
They finally agree that the person who is
wrong will become a slave to the other. To
ensure her victory, Kadru persuades a
number of her children to hang from the
back of the horse, which from a distance
makes the white tail appear to be black.
When Vinata sees the black snakes, she
accepts her defeat and has to serve Kadru
under extremely harsh conditions for
many years. When Garuda learns what
has happened, he embarks on an endless
program of killing snakes.
Gauda
One of the five northern brahmin com-
munities (Pancha Gauda); the other
four are the Kanaujias, the Maithilas,
the Utkalas, and the Saraswats. Gauda
brahmins are most numerous in the
western half of northern India, particu-
larly in the western parts of the states
of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh,
in the state of Haryana, and in the state
of Rajasthan.
Gaudapada
(5th c.?) Philosopher and textual
commentator traditionally said to be
the grand-teacher of the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Shankaracharya
maintained that Gaudapada was aGaura
proponent of Advaita Vedanta, one
of the six schools of classical Hindu
philosophy, despite Gaudapada’s simi-
larities to certain Buddhist positions.
Gaudapada’s most famous work is a
commentary on the sacred text called
the Mandukya Upanishad.
Gaudapada
(2) (5th–8th c.) Philosopher and
commentator in the Samkhya school,
one of the six schools of classical Hindu
philosophy. Gaudapada is best known for
his commentary on the Samkhyakarikas,
the foundational text of the Samkhya
school, which is ascribed to the philoso-
pher Ishvarakrishna.
Gaudiya Vaishnava
Religious community founded by the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533).
It takes its name from the ancient
name for Bengal (Gauda), and its
stress on the worship of the god
Vishnu. The community’s religious
practices and beliefs are founded in
Chaitanya’s ecstatic devotionalism. He
asserted that the path to religious
ecstasy is the repetitive recitation of
Krishna’s name, often while singing
and dancing in the streets. Chaitanya’s
religious charisma gained him many
followers, of whom the most important
were the Goswamis—the brothers
Rupa and Sanatana, and their nephew
Jiva. At Chaitanya’s command the
Goswamis went to live in Brindavan,
the village where Krishna is believed
to have grown up. The Goswamis’
descendants live there to this day. In
Brindavan, the Goswamis set about orga-
nizing and systematizing the philosophi-
cal foundation of Chaitanya’s ecstatic
experience. Although they conceived of
themselves as Chaitanya’s servants,
they are equally important in the com-
munity’s development. The Goswamis’
key philosophical doctrine was
achintyabhedabheda, the idea that
there was an “inconceivable identity
and difference” between the Supreme
Divinity (Krishna) and the human being
that renders the soul simultaneously
identical to and different from the divin-
ity. The Gaudiya Vaishnava community
is also famous for its exhaustive analysis
of devotion (bhakti) as an emotional
experience. They enumerated the differ-
ent ways to experience the love of god as
five modes of devotion. For further
information see Sushil Kumar De, Early
History of the Vaishnava Faith and
Movement in Bengal, 1961.
Gaumukh
(“cow’s mouth”) Sacred site (tirtha) high
in the Himalayas. It is located at the
glacier that is the actual source of the
Bhagirathi River, one of the tributaries
of the Ganges. Gaumukh is twelve miles
upriver from Gangotri, the place that is
ritually celebrated as the source of the
Ganges. In popular Hindu belief, the
Ganges is believed to issue from the
mouth of a cow, hence the name.
Gauna
This is the name for the ceremony of
taking a new bride into her marital
home for the first time. The addition of a
new bride marks an important change
for a family and is a time of both oppor-
tunity and danger. On one hand, it car-
ries the potential for great blessings,
since it is assumed that the bride and
groom will soon begin a family. On the
other hand, it also carries the threat of
danger since the addition of a new per-
son to the family brings the potential for
disruption. The bride and her new family
perform various rituals to ensure that
her addition to the family will be auspi-
cious and harmonious.
Gaura
Festival celebrated in central India that
climaxes on the first day of the bright or
waxing half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November), the day
after the festival of Diwali. The Gaura
festival celebrates the marriage of the
god Shiva and the goddess Parvati.
[[243]]
Gaurava
complexions—a prejudice that persists
in modern times.
Gaurikund
The Gauri-Shankar is a bead that is formed when
two seeds grow together naturally. Worn by devotees
of the god Shiva, it is believed to be a manifestation
of the union of Shiva and his wife Parvati.
Gaurava
(“[needless] complexity”) In Indian
logic, one of the faults to be avoided in
constructing and pursuing an argu-
ment. According to the principle of
“simplicity” (laghava), when one is pre-
sented with two equally plausible theo-
ries, one should choose the theory that
is easier to understand and makes the
fewest assumptions. The primary crite-
rion in evaluating any argument is the
validity of the argument itself, and it is
only after this has been satisfied that
one may raise objections based on com-
plexity or simplicity.
Gauri
(“fair”) Epithet of the goddess Parvati,
wife of the god Shiva. According to a
story from the Shiva Purana, a sectar-
ian text recounting the mythology of
Shiva, Parvati takes offense when
Shiva refers to her as Kali (“black”).
She performs harsh physical austeri-
ties (tapas) to accumulate the power to
rid herself of her dark complexion.
When this is accomplished, she
receives the epithet Gauri to signify
her new and lightened complexion.
This story illustrates the pervasive reli-
gious belief that physical hardship can
give one spiritual and even magical
powers, a conviction that is still found
in contemporary India. This brief story
also reveals the stigma that Indian
society attributes to people with dark
[[244]]

Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalaya Mountains of the state of
Uttar Pradesh. Gaurikund is located
about ten miles downstream from the
headwaters of the Mandakini River,
which is itself one of the Himalayan trib-
utaries of the Ganges. Gaurikund is the
end of the motorable road on the way to
Kedarnath, and after this pilgrims
must travel on foot. Gaurikund’s myth-
ic charter is connected with the god
Shiva and his wife Parvati. Parvati is
said to have performed harsh asceti-
cism at Gaurikund in order to gain
Shiva as her husband; after a long time
Shiva is pleased with Parvati, reveals
himself to her, and the two become
lovers in that place. According to local
geography, the place at which Parvati
lived during this time is marked by a
group of hot springs, which are another
of Gaurikund’s attractions.
Gauri-Shankar
A particular variety of rudraksha, a bead
made from the dried seed of the tree
Elaeocarpus ganitrus, which is consid-
ered sacred to Shiva. The rudraksha is
often strung into garlands and worn by
Shiva’s devotees (bhakta). The Gauri-
Shankar rudraksha is made when two
seeds grow together naturally. Although
the Gauri-Shankar is not as rare as cer-
tain other beads, it is unusual enough to
command a fairly good price. The Gauri-
Shankar is revered as a natural manifes-
tation of the divine couple, the goddess
Parvati (Gauri) and the god Shiva
(Shankar). It thus represents the total
presence of divinity in its eternal and its
dynamic aspects: Shiva as knowledge
and Parvati as Shakti or power.
Gautama
(6th c. B.C.E.) In Hindu mythology, one of
the seven sages whose name marks a
clan “lineage” (gotra); the others areGayawal
Kashyapa, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Bhrgu, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brah-
mins are believed to be descended from
these seven sages, with each family tak-
ing the name of its progenitor as its
gotra name. In modern times, these
gotra divisions are still important, since
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
A new bride adopts her husband’s
gotra after her marriage as part of her
new identity.
Gautama is most famous as the hus-
band of Ahalya. When he discovers that
the god Indra has slept with Ahalya,
he curses his wife to turn into stone
and curses Indra to have a thousand
vulvas on his body. Both curses are later
modified to reduce their severity. Ahalya
is turned to stone, but returns to life
when touched by the god Rama’s foot,
whereas
Indra’s
body
becomes
covered with a thousand eyes. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Gautama
(2) (3rd c. B.C.E. ?) Indian philosopher
who is traditionally cited as the author
of the Nyaya Sutras, the foundation of
the Nyaya philosophical school. The
Nyaya school is one of several schools
that seek to explain the cause of human
bondage in the cycle of reincarnation
(samsara) and how it can be overcome.
Gaya
Sacred site (tirtha) and city in the mod-
ern state of Bihar and capital of a dis-
trict by the same name. According to
Hindu mythology, this is the place
where the god Vishnu sacrifices a pow-
erful demon named Gayasura, having
promised the demon that the space cov-
ered by his body will be the holiest spot
on earth. Gaya is best known as a site to
perform various rites for the dead, par-
ticularly the memorial rites known as
shraddhas. Its sanctity is so well known
that it draws people from all over the
eastern part of India.
Gayasura
In Hindu mythology, the name of a very
powerful asura (demon). Gayasura per-
forms harsh asceticism (tapas), spurred
by the traditional Indian assumption
that to voluntarily endure physical suf-
fering brings one spiritual and magical
powers. Gayasura’s powers grow so
large that all the gods become con-
cerned that he might become powerful
enough to overthrow them. As the gods’
fears grow, the god Vishnu advises the
god Brahma to convince Gayasura to
allow his body to be sacrificed. Vishnu
promises Gayasura that the place where
he dies will become holier than all the
sacred sites (tirthas) in the world. The
spot where Gayasura’s body lies becomes
the holy place known as Gaya, which by
virtue of Vishnu’s boon is claimed to be
holier than all other places on earth. See
also magic.
Gayatri Mantra
A particular verse from the Rg Veda
(3.62.10), the oldest Hindu religious text;
this verse is written in the poetic meter
named gayatri, hence its name. The
verse itself is an invocation to the sun
and can be translated “let us meditate
on the sun, most excellent of all the
deities, may he inspire our minds.”
Reciting the Gayatri mantra is part of the
morning and evening worship (sand-
hya) prescribed for every “twice-born”
man who has received the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” An important part of this ini-
tiation is the transmission of this
mantra to the young man. Although the
Gayatri must be recited every day, it
should not be recited over water; in
earlier times this was one reason why
many orthodox Hindus were reluctant
to travel abroad.
Gayawal
Endogamous group of pilgrimage
priests (pandas) who live in Gaya, a pil-
grimage place (tirtha) famous as a site
for rites for the dead. Each Gayawal family
[[245]]
Gemstones
has exclusive hereditary rights to serve
all the pilgrims whose ancestral homes
lie in a particular region or regions,
regardless of where those pilgrims may
be living at the time. As at all pilgrimage
sites, pilgrims are supposed to be served
only by their hereditary family priest.
This monopoly gives the Gayawals
greater leverage in negotiating fees
with their pilgrim clients, who are in a
vulnerable position since most of them
have come to perform rites for dead rel-
atives. The Gayawals are notorious for
their rapaciousness, greed, and general
lack of learning. These qualities render
them somewhat debased by brahmin
standards, as does the fact that they
make much of their income from the
dead, which is considered inauspi-
cious. In fairness to the Gayawals, the
relative power derived from this
monopoly is also balanced by a sense of
hereditary obligation to their clients—
the perennial issue is never whether the
clients will be served, but how much
they will have to pay.
Gemstones
In Hindu astrology, gemstones are used
to strengthen, neutralize, or counteract
the celestial influence of certain plan-
ets. Hindu astrology recognizes nine
planets, each of which is associated with
a particular gemstone: sun (ruby),
moon (pearl), Mars (coral), Mercury
(emerald), Jupiter (topaz), Venus (dia-
mond), Saturn (sapphire), Rahu (agate),
and Ketu (turquoise). Each of these nine
planets is considered to be a minor deity
and to have a distinct personality and
characteristics. When deciding which
gemstones to wear, one must make cer-
tain astrological considerations, partic-
ularly the position of the planets in one’s
natal horoscope (janampatrika), which
is believed to reveal each planet’s influ-
ence. These gemstones are worn
in rings, with the base of the stone
in contact with the skin to give the
gemstones their efficacy over their
planetary counterparts.
[[246]]

Gesture, in Dance and Drama
Gestures in Hindu dance and drama
are divided in two categories: hasta,
which are broad positions of the arms
and hands; and mudra, which are
stylized hand gestures, usually with
specific meanings.
Ghanta
A handbell. These bells typically have a
long straight handle projecting upward
from the top and are usually rung with
the bell part projecting from the bot-
tom of the closed hand. Ringing bells is
an important element in Hindu wor-
ship (puja) and its pleasing sound is
one of the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas) given to the deity as part of
worship. Many different deities are pic-
tured with bells in Hindu iconography,
but it is particularly associated with the
goddess Kali, whose roaring voice is
equated with a tolling bell.
Ghat
In its broadest meaning, a ghat is a
bathing (snana) place by a body of
water, such as a river, lake, or pond. The
word ghat is also commonly used to
refer to the permanent structures that
have been built at these bathing places.
They usually include a flat area at the
water’s edge, where people can walk,
stand, or sit. A set of steps leads from the
platform into and below the surface of
the water. Constructing a ghat is often
considered a pious act that generates
religious merit. This is particularly
true in pilgrimage places (tirtha),
where ghats are often centers for public
religious life.
Ghatika
In traditional Indian timekeeping, a
ghatika is a period of twenty-four min-
utes. There are sixty in each twenty-four
hour day. The ghatika gets its name
from the clay pots (ghata) that were used
to make water-clocks; these water-
clocks measured the time by allowingGiri Dashanami
water to drip out from the pot through a
small hole.
Ghatotkacha
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Ghatotkacha is
a son of Bhima, one of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. Ghatotkacha’s mother is
a rakshasi (female demon) named
Hidambi; Bhima’s carnal relations with
a nonhuman being are one sign of his
earthy and unsophisticated personali-
ty. As the offspring of a rakshasi and
the strongest Pandava, Ghatotkacha is
a massive physical specimen. He is a
staunch ally to the Pandavas all his life
and fights valiantly on their behalf dur-
ing the war between the Pandavas and
their cousins the Kauravas, destroying
large parts of the Kaurava army. He
fights several times with the hero
Karna, but is finally killed when Karna
uses a magic weapon known as
Vaijayanti Shakti.
Ghora
(“terrifying”) Term used to refer to
Hindu deities in their frightful, terrify-
ing, and powerful aspects, as opposed to
their benevolent (saumya) manifesta-
tions. This distinction is particularly
applicable to the god Shiva and the
forms of the Goddess, both of whom can
appear in either form, and devotees
(bhakta) can focus their worship on
either aspect.
Ghosts
Popular Hindu culture generally accepts
the existence of ghosts and spirits, par-
ticularly of people who have died a vio-
lent or untimely death. Despite the
virtually universal belief in reincarna-
tion (samsara), it is generally accepted
that the spirits of people who have died
such deaths linger near where they lived
during their lives. Ghosts will usually
reveal themselves through disturbances,
misfortunes, or by appearing to family
members in visions or dreams. The family
will then take measures to appease
the spirit. Sometimes this is done by
sponsoring rituals or ceremonies. Other
times a family may prepare a shrine for
the ghost to inhabit. Such ghosts are
usually believed to have unsatisfied
desires—either they died prior to getting
married or having children, or they
started major enterprises they were
unable to finish. People who have lived
long lives and fulfilled all the major
human goals will not become ghosts.
Ghrneshvar
(“Lord of Compassion”) One of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a group of images of
the god Shiva that are deemed particu-
larly holy and powerful. Shiva is believed
to be uniquely present at these places.
This particular jyotirlinga is located in
the village of Velur in the state of
Maharashtra, and is also known as
Dhushmeshvar. This site is unusual
because the form of Shiva that resides
here is known by two different names
and has no unequivocal charter myth.
At none of the other jyotirlingas is there
any doubt about the presiding deity’s
form or how it came to be there. This
indicates that Ghrneshvar is a minor
site, perhaps one simply filling out
the catalog of the jyotirlingas to get
the number up to twelve. Despite
this apparent lack of importance,
Ghrneshvar is arguably the most-visited
of the jyotirlingas. It is only a few
miles from the world famous cave
temples at Ellora and is a regular stop
on the local tourist circuit. The temple is
fairly small but is well kept and very
impressive. Male visitors are required to
remove their shirts before entering
Shiva’s presence.
Giri Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The
Dashanamis were supposedly estab-
lished by the ninth-century philosopher
Shankaracharya, in an effort to create
[[247]]
Giridhara
Jain temple in Girnar. Settled atop a hill, Girnar is an ancient site
that is sacred to both Hindu and Jain religious communities.
a corps of learned men who could help
to revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divi-
sions is designated by a different
name—in this case, giri (“mountain”).
Upon initiation, new members are
given this name as a surname to their
new ascetic names, thus allowing for
immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are collect-
ed into four larger organizational
groups: Anandawara, Bhogawara,
Bhuriwara, and Kitawara. Each group
has its headquarters in one of the four
monastic centers (maths) supposedly
established by Shankaracharya. Each of
the four groups is also associated with
one of the four Vedas—the oldest Hindu
sacred texts, a different geographical
quarter of India, a different great utter-
ance
(mahavakya),
and
a
different ascetic quality. The Giri
Dashanamis belong to the Anandawara
group, which is affiliated with the Jyotir
math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath.
[[248]]

Giridhara
(“mountain-lifter”) In Hindu mythology,
a youthful and heroic form of the god
Krishna. According to the story, as a
young man Krishna observes that the
village elders make yearly offerings to
Indra, the god of the storm. After some
persuasion, Krishna manages to con-
vince the elders that instead of making
offerings to Indra, who is too far off in
heaven to do them any good, they
should offer them instead to Mount
Govardhan. This mountain looms over
their village as a symbol of their pros-
perity, and since Krishna’s devotees
(bhakta) consider this mountain to be
another form of Krishna, he is actually
persuading the elders to make offerings
to him. Indra is furious when he discov-
ers what has happened, and unleashes a
violent storm that threatens to wash
away the village and destroy all the
inhabitants. To protect the villagers and
their cattle from harm, Krishna lifts up
Mount Govardhan, and holds it over
their heads as an umbrella to protect
them from the rain. After seven days,
Indra admits defeat, and Krishna
emerges as the hero of the village. ThisGitagovinda
story illustrates the gradual eclipse
of the older Vedic deities. The figure
of Krishna as Giridhara is widely
worshiped in Rajasthan and is particu-
larly noteworthy as the “chosen deity”
(ishtadevata) of the poet-saint Mirabai.
Girnar
Sacred site (tirtha) on a hill outside the
city of Junagadh in the state of Gujarat.
Girnar has been a holy site for at least
[[2]]
,000 years and remains an important
place for several religious communities.
The hill’s summit is an important pil-
grimage site for the Jains and has a clus-
ter of Jain temples, some of them dating
back to the twelfth century. It also has a
long history as a center for Hindu
ascetics—the Brahmachari Sanyasis
(Brahmacharin) have an ashram there,
and the summit is said to have a set of
footprints left by Dattatreya, a famous
mythic figure who is considered a partial
avatar of the god Vishnu and a
paradigm for asceticism. Girnar is the
site of a large Hindu ascetic gathering
on Kartik Purnima, the full moon
in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November).
Gitagovinda
(“Govinda’s Song”) Lyric poem written
in the twelfth century by the poet
Jayadeva. Written in an era when ver-
nacular languages were becoming the
prevalent vehicle for devotional religios-
ity, the Gitagovinda is one of the last
great devotional (bhakti) texts com-
posed in Sanskrit and is an exquisite
example of Sanskrit poetry. According to
tradition, Jayadeva was associated with
the temple to Jagannath in the eastern
Indian city of Puri, and his wife
Padmavati was a dancer at the same
temple. The Gitagovinda is a devotional
poem to the god Jagannath. The text was
obviously meant to be sung, since its
twenty-four cantos are set in various dif-
fering musical modes (ragas), each of
which conveys a different emotion. The
text has also been expressed through
dance for at least 500 years in the Orissi
dance style that originated in the
Jagannath temple. The Gitagovinda is
still used in the daily worship of
Jagannath and occupies a position held
by no other literary text.
The Gitagovinda is an allegory of
the union of the human soul with God.
This union is described through the
story of the love between the god
Krishna and his human consort Radha
as they experience an initial flush of
passion, followed by jealousy, separa-
tion, reconciliation, and reunion.
Although Jayadeva’s text lavishly
employs the images from Sanskrit love
poetry, it is far more than a romantic
novel. The poem was written to show
that Krishna is the lord of the entire uni-
verse. The first cantos after the introduc-
tion, the Dashavatara Stotra, pay
homage to Krishna in his ten avatars or
earthly incarnations (Dashavatar), each
of whom is instrumental in preserving
the cosmic equilibrium. Although
Krishna is considered an avatar of the
god Vishnu in many parts of the Hindu
tradition, Krishna is the supreme deity
for Jayadeva. The place usually occupied
by Krishna in the enumeration of the
avatars is taken by Krishna’s brother,
Balarama. The song that follows contin-
ues this theme, giving the divine attrib-
utes of Krishna as Vishnu, and further
emphasizing that the entire Gitagovinda
describes the deity’s divine play (lila).
Having set the appropriate context in
the opening songs, Jayadeva’s text
returns to a more conventional tale of
romantic love. The next chapter
describes the symbols of spring, which
are intended to evoke a mood of love. Yet
this mood is marred by Radha’s jealousy
when Krishna sports with a troop of
cowherd girls, for she desires Krishna for
herself alone. She withdraws and sits
apart, sulking and despondent, only to
burst into rage when Krishna comes to
meet her, bearing the signs of another
erotic liaison. Her anger and dismissal
make Krishna realize what he has done.
He eventually succeeds in dispersing
her anger, and convinces Radha of his
[[249]]
Goa
love. They reconcile and make passion-
ate love. The text ends by describing
their love play in the afterglow, in which
Radha orders Krishna to ornament her
as she wishes, showing her complete
power over him.
As a text, the Gitagovinda can be read
on many different levels simultaneously.
The themes of love, betrayal, and recon-
ciliation speak easily to everyday human
experience, but the theological and
mystical levels are always present. In the
end, deity and devotee (bhakta) are
described as needing and loving
one another. Neither is complete with-
out the other. Radha’s demand for exclu-
sive love is at first denied, but in the end
her persistence and conviction are
rewarded. The Gitagovinda has been
masterfully translated by the late
Barbara Stoller Miller as The Love Song
of the Dark Lord, 1977.
Goa
One of the smallest states in modern
India. It lies between the states of
Maharashtra and Karnataka on the
shore of the Arabian Sea. Goa was a
Portuguese colony for more than 400
years and did not become a part of the
Indian union until 1961, when India
engineered a nearly bloodless takeover.
Goa still retains much of its Portuguese
influence—in its food, easygoing pace,
and the continuing presence of Roman
Catholicism—which makes it one of the
most unusual cultural areas in India. For
general information about Goa and all
the regions of India, an accessible refer-
ence is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Gobind Deo Mandir
A temple built in 1590 in Brindavan, the
town believed to be the god Krishna’s
childhood home. The temple is dedicated
to Krishna in his form as the “Divine
Cowherd.” From an architectural per-
spective, the temple is unique for its
vaulted ceiling, which is seldom found
in Hindu temples. The temple’s interior
[[250]]

and exterior are also notable for their
almost complete lack of figural orna-
mentation, which is extremely unusual.
The temple is close to the major road
connecting Agra and Delhi. These are
the two major political centers of the
Moghul empire (1525–1707), whose
rulers were Muslims. Since many ortho-
dox Muslims believe that figural repre-
sentations are idolatrous, particularly in
places of worship, the temple’s austere
style may have been an attempt to avoid
inciting Muslim iconoclasm. There is
evidence of conflict between Hindus
and Muslims at this site since the few
figures inside the temple, carved into
the lintels of door and windows, have
had their heads broken off. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Godana
(“gift of a cow”) In Hindu religious prac-
tice, gift giving (dana) is common and
believed to be a pious act that generates
religious merit. Godana is the gift of a
cow, usually to a brahmin. Traditional
religious texts highly laud the gift of
a cow, both as a charitable act and as
a way to expiate one’s sins. However,
since many of these texts were written
by brahmins, one can detect a hint
of self-interest.
Godavari
River running from west to east in cen-
tral India. The Godavari’s headwaters lie
in the state of Maharashtra on the
inland side of the western Ghats. It
meanders through that state to Andhra
Pradesh, where it enters the Bay of
Bengal. The Godarvi is traditionally
considered one of India’s seven sacred
rivers, along with the Ganges, Yamuna,
Cauvery, Saraswati, Narmada, and
Indus. The Godavari has special status
in central India, where it is often referred
to as the “Ganges”—the most sacred
river for Hindus. Although its entire
length is considered sacred, the
Godavari’s most important religious
sites are all in the west: Nasik,Goddess
A shrine in the Godavari River near the riverbank of Nasik.
Tryambakeshvar, and Paithan. See
also ghat.
Goddess
India is home to a host of different god-
desses. Although goddesses differ greatly
in demeanor and character, they are all
generally seen as expressions of a single
underlying female deity. This vision of
the goddess coincides with the charac-
teristic Hindu practice that allows for
multiple manifestations of a divinity,
while at the same time asserting his or
her underlying reality as a single entity.
Many of India’s goddesses are the deities
of a specific site, who might be wor-
shiped only in that specific place. Yet as
these local goddesses are all mythically
linked as differing forms of a single great
Goddess, the sacred sites (tirthas) are
also connected with this great Goddess.
The sites, called pithas or “benches,”
form a sacred network stretching
throughout the entire subcontinent.
The origins of the goddess cult
in India are uncertain. Excavations of
cities of the Indus Valley civilization
have unearthed female figures with
enormous breasts, hips, and buttocks.
These figures resemble the Venus of
Willendorf found in Bronze Age Europe
and suggest that there was some kind of
cult associated with women’s fertility.
Some interpreters have seen the Indus
Valley figures as proof that the cult of the
Mother Goddess originated in the Indus
Valley civilization, but hard evidence
supporting this claim is slim. Another
reason some interpreters believe that
goddess worship must have come from
the indigenous Indian culture is that the
deities mentioned in the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts, are almost
exclusively male. The female goddesses
in the Vedic hymns are infrequent and
unimportant—Ushas
(the
dawn),
Prthivi (the earth), and Nirriti (death
and destruction). But somehow female
divinities were elevated from virtual
obscurity and became conceived as the
reigning power in the universe.
The cult of the great Goddess
appears fully formed, seemingly out of
nowhere, in about the fifth century. She
first appears in the text known as the
Devimahatmya (“greatness of the
Goddess”), which is itself a section of the
[[251]]
Goddess
Markandeya Purana. The depth and
subtlety of her characterization in this
text leads scholars to infer that this
cult had existed for some time, per-
haps as a secret religious community
open only to initiates. The goddess in the
Devimahatmya is a powerful, indepen-
dent female force and is able to do what
the gods cannot. She is created from the
collected radiance (tejas) of all the gods,
and comes into the world to kill a
demon against whom the gods have
struggled in vain. The Devimahatmya’s
three different episodes portray her in
three different divine personas: as
Mahasaraswati in the slaying of the
demons Madhu and Kaitabha, as
Mahalakshmi in slaying a demon
named Mahishasura, and as Mahakali
in the battle against the demon generals
Shumbha and Nishumbha.
Many of India’s goddesses are the
patron deities of particular locales, and
are considered unique to that place. The
Shiwalik goddesses, for example, are
unique to particular sites in the
Shiwalik hills. At the same time, all of
these goddesses are considered different
manifestations of the same divine energy.
According to the sites’ charter myth,
each site is associated with a particular
body part of the primeval goddess. The
myth tells of the death of Sati, who com-
mits suicide when her father Daksha
insults her husband Shiva. Shiva picks
up Sati’s body and wanders the earth,
carrying her on his shoulders. In his
grief Shiva neglects his divine duties,
and the world begins to fall into ruin.
The other gods beg Vishnu for help, lest
the world be destroyed. Vishnu uses his
razor-sharp discus to cut off pieces of
Sati’s body, until finally there is nothing
left. When the body is completely gone,
Shiva goes to the mountains, where he
becomes absorbed in meditation.
Wherever a part of Sati’s body falls, that
place becomes a Shakti Pitha (“seat of
the Goddess”), sanctified to the Goddess
in a particular form. The number of
these places differs from source to
source—some list fifty-one, and others
[[108]]
. Whatever the number, the sites are
[[252]]

spread throughout the subcontinent,
from Baluchistan in modern Pakistan, to
Assam in the far east, to deep in south-
ern India. Each Shakti Pitha is associated
with a particular body part of the great
Goddess, has a particular presiding
female deity, and has a particular
Bhairava as a consort to that goddess.
From this perspective, the entire sub-
continent is seen as a single cohesive
unit, with the network of sites connect-
ed to one another as are the parts of the
body. Different places may claim the
same body part, the result of the drive to
establish a site and to give it prestige.
For example, Sati’s vulva, the most pow-
erfully charged part of the female body,
is usually accepted to have fallen at
Kamakhya in Assam, but the same
claim is made at Kalimath in the
Himalayas. There is no single authorita-
tive list of sites and competing claims
are not uncommon. Many Hindus seem
unconcerned with the seeming incon-
sistency of having the same body parts
claimed by different sites; perhaps this
reflects the conviction that the Goddess
is behind them all, and that the specifics
are therefore less important.
While some goddesses are only wor-
shiped in their particular locale, such as
the goddesses found in the Shiwalik
hills, other goddesses have become
more widely worshiped, and some have
become pan-Indian. In the pantheon,
the Goddess generally appears in two
widely differing types of manifestations.
At times she appears as a wife and mother,
in forms such as Parvati, Lakshmi, and
Saraswati. Although these married
goddesses are not completely powerless,
they tend to be benign, benevolent,
and auspicious. Her other manifestation
is in forms such as Durga and Kali,
whose male consorts are considered
subordinate to them. These indepen-
dent manifestations of the Goddess
have the power to help their devotees
(bhakta), but they are also volatile and
potentially dangerous, since their power
is sometimes unleashed without con-
trol. Cultural observers have suggested
that this dual perspective representsGodse, Nathuram
cultural perspectives on Indian women,
particularly the belief that women’s
procreative capacities should be
channeled through the safe, confining
bounds of marriage. Married women,
as wives and mothers, are auspicious,
life-giving, and life-sustaining because
their creative power has been regulat-
ed under male control. Unmarried
women remain a source of danger,
particularly to the family’s prestige,
since the quickest way to ruin a family’s
good name is through the corruption of
its women.
Godman
Colloquial name for a particular type of
charismatic Hindu ascetic. As religious
figures, godmen are generally character-
ized by a high-profile presence, by their
ability to attract attention and support
from the larger Indian society, and by
their claims to advanced spiritual
attainments. They sometimes claim to
possess magic powers—such as the
ability to heal, read minds, foretell the
future, or to influence future events—
which are exhibited to prove the god-
man’s spiritual attainments. Godmen
often come from outside the established
ascetic orders and may have never even
taken formal ascetic initiation. They are
able to flourish in the Indian religious
“free market,” which recognizes and
rewards religious charisma. Godmen
typically dwell in their own ashrams
rather than one belonging to an order.
Although most of them acknowledge a
guru or religious preceptor, their suc-
cess stems more from their personal
qualities than the strength of their spiri-
tual lineage. In recent years a number of
these godmen have cultivated large
numbers of foreign disciples, which can
bring both wealth and enhanced pres-
tige. One contemporary example of
such a godman is Sathya Sai Baba,
whose ashram is in Puttaparthi in the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh. For
an example of one person’s encounters
with a variety of these figures, see Peter
Ludwig Brent, Godmen of India, 1972.
Gods, World of the
The earliest reference to the transmigra-
tion of souls is found in both the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad (6.2) and
the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10). These
texts make a qualitative distinction
between two different paths. The path to
the world of the gods ultimately led to
the sun, and the person traveling it did
not return again, whereas the path to
the world of the fathers led to the
moon, and the person traveling it was
eventually reborn on earth. The leitmo-
tiv of the Upanishads is the need for
individual spiritual realization, which is
the key to getting on the path to the
world of the gods. Those who gain this
realization attain the final and ultimate
end, whereas those who simply do good
deeds will return to earth, although their
good deeds will give them karmic bene-
fits. See also karma.
Godse, Nathuram
(1912–1948) Hindu nationalist figure
who is most famous as the assassin of
Mohandas Gandhi. Godse was a devoted
follower of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar,
whose articulation of Hindu national-
ism equated Hindu identity and Indian
patriotism. Savarkar and his followers
saw the partition of India in 1947 as the
“vivisection” of Mother India, dividing
her into India and Pakistan. Like many
of Savarkar’s followers, Godse was
enraged by Gandhi’s post-partition
efforts to protect Indian Muslims and to
influence the Indian government’s policy
toward Pakistan, particularly his hunger
strike to force the Indian government to
transfer to Pakistan a large sum of
money that had been promised. Filled
with the conviction that Gandhi had to
be stopped, Godse intercepted Gandhi
on the way to a prayer meeting, touched
his feet as a sign of respect, and then
shot him three times. Godse was tried
and executed for his action and is some-
times cited as a martyr by the most
ardent contemporary nationalists.
[[253]]
Gokarna
Gokarna
(“cow’s ear”) Sacred site (tirtha) in the
state of Karnataka on the shore of the
Arabian Sea, just south of Karnataka’s
border with the state of Goa. Gokarna is
most famous for a temple to the god
Shiva in his form as Mahabaleshvara,
the “exceedingly powerful Lord.”
According to the site’s charter myth,
Shiva intends to perform the work of
creation, but before he begins he
becomes rapt in meditation in the
depths of the earth. The god Brahma
grows impatient with the delay and car-
ries out the work of creation himself.
Shiva is enraged when he discovers what
has happened and is about to force his
way up through the earth, which will
create a terrible cataclysm. The earth
appears to Shiva in the form of a cow,
who begs him to rise to the surface
through her ear. It is claimed that a cave
at Gokarna is the remnant of that pas-
sage through which Shiva rose.
Gokhale, Gopal Krishna
(1866–1915) College professor, legisla-
tor, and reformist Hindu, who worked
for much of his life with his older con-
temporary, Mahadev Govind Ranade.
Unlike Ranade, whose position as a
judge barred him from active political
involvement, Gokhale spent the last fif-
teen years of his life as a legislator.
Thirteen of these years were spent as
Bombay’s Indian representative to the
Imperial Legislative Council, the highest
lawmaking body in India. Like Ranade,
Gokhale sought to influence British pol-
icy by working within established insti-
tutions, in this case through the British
colonial government. This willingness to
compromise brought him opposition
from leaders such as Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, who advocated stiffer, even vio-
lent opposition to British rule.
Gokulnath
(1551–1640) The third guru of the reli-
gious community known as the Pushti
Marg. Gokulnath inherited the mantle
[[254]]

of leadership from his father Vitthalnath,
who was the successor to his father
Vallabhacharya, the community’s founder.
During his tenure Gokulnath helped
solidify the religious community and
paid particular attention to its organi-
zation. He is best known for compiling
several hagiographic works describing
the careers of his father and grandfa-
ther, to provide an appropriately rever-
ent picture for their followers.
Gokulnath was also the moving force
behind a text named the Chaurasi
Vaishnavan ki Varta (“Account of
eighty-four Vaishnavas”), although the
actual text was probably compiled by
Gokulnath’s disciple Hariray. This text is
a sectarian hagiography describing the
lives of eighty-four paradigmatic
Vaishnavas, all of whom—at least
according to the text—were associates
and disciples of Vallabhacharya and
Vitthalnath. The text’s real purpose is
not to provide a biography, but to illus-
trate the importance of the Pushti Marg
and its leaders.
Golden Embryo
One of the earliest cosmological myths.
It first appears in the Rg Veda (10.121),
the oldest Hindu religious text.
According to this account, the universe
originally consisted of the Golden
Embryo (Hiranyagarbha). The Golden
Embryo stirred and evolved into
Prajapati, the creator of all things
and ruler over all creatures. In this story,
as with most other accounts of Hindu
cosmology, the cosmos originates
from a single source and is thus an
organic whole.
Golwalkar, Madhav Sadashiv
(1904–1973) Second sarsanghchalak
(“Supreme Leader”) of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS is a
conservative Hindu organization whose
express purpose is to provide the leader-
ship cadre for a revitalized Hindu India;
for most of its history it has character-
ized its mission as cultural, rather thanGopichand
religious or political. Golwalkar is a piv-
otal figure in RSS history. He took office
in 1940 upon the death of its founder,
Dr. K. B. Hedgewar, and guided it
through the tumultuous years sur-
rounding India’s independence. After
Mohandas Gandhi’s assassination by
the Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse
in 1948, the RSS and several other organi-
zations were briefly banned. Despite ini-
tial suspicions, the RSS has never been
implicated in Gandhi’s death. During
the ban the RSS continued to function
underground, and many of its leaders
became more politically active, a trend
that Golwalkar had earlier discouraged.
When the ban was rescinded in 1949,
the RSS began to exercise greater influ-
ence by forming and sponsoring affiliated
organizations, such as trade unions, stu-
dent organizations, charitable institu-
tions, and political parties. This trend
continued throughout the rest of
Golwalkar’s tenure, although he was far
less activist than his successor,
Balasaheb Deoras. For further informa-
tion see Walter K. Andersen and
Shridhar D. Damle, The Brotherhood in
Saffron, 1987; and Tapan Basu et al.,
Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags, 1993.
Gond
Tribal (adivasi) community in central
India. The Gonds are concentrated in
the state of Madhya Pradesh, particu-
larly in the hills on both sides of the
Vindhya Mountains, in the Kaimur
Range at the eastern border of Madhya
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and in the
Ramgarh Hills on the border of Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, and Bihar. Like most
tribal peoples, they tend to be quite
poor and eke out a living from subsis-
tence agriculture.
Gopala
(“protector of cows”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, reflecting his childhood occu-
pation as a cowherd. See Krishna.
Gopi
(feminine of gopa, “cow-keeper”) In
Hindu mythology, the gopis are the cow-
keeping women who are the god
Krishna’s companions in Braj, the
region south of Delhi in which Krishna is
believed to have spent his early life. The
gopis are the simple village women of
Braj, who keep the village cows, churn
the milk into butter for sale, and provide
Krishna with an adoring and familiar
presence as he grows up. They exclaim
over his beauty as an infant and they
endure his boyhood pranks—particu-
larly his continual theft of their hard-
earned butter. When he becomes an
enchanting adolescent, they respond
to the nightly call of his flute to join
him in the circular dance (ras lila) on
the shores of the river Yamuna.
Although the gopis are completely
devoted to Krishna and love him above
all else, their relations with him are
also devoid of any affectation or awe.
The gopis are simple country women,
and they treat Krishna as one of their
own. For example, they feel no qualms
about scolding him when he has stolen
their butter. Their intimate but unaffected
relationship with Krishna makes them
paradigms for the ideal devotee (bhakta).
For his part, Krishna is said to prefer this
sort of natural and spontaneous rela-
tionship to any sort of calculated wor-
ship. Krishna loves Braj more than any
other place on earth because the people
there treat him as one of their own.
Gopichand
Princely protagonist of The Song of
Gopichand, an allegorical adventure
that is much beloved throughout
northern India and has even spread to
Bengal where it is called The Song of
Manik Chandra . The story tells of the
trials of Gopichand, who loses his king-
dom through the vicissitudes of fate
but eventually regains it after numer-
ous trials and setbacks. Aside from the
song’s story, it is also embedded with
the ideas of the Nathpanthis, an ascetic
community supposedly founded by
[[255]]
Gopuram
Towering gopurams mark the gateways to the Brhadeshvar Temple in Tanjore.
Gorakhnath. Some members of this
community believed that perfecting
their bodies through yoga would make
them immortal. This idea appears in the
song through its description of
Gopichand’s mother Mayana, who has
power over Death himself. In some ver-
sions of the story Mayana’s religious pre-
ceptor is identified as a low-caste
sweeper, while in others it is the sage
Gorakhnath himself. Two versions of
this song have been translated by G. A.
Grierson in the Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, the first published in
[[1878]]
 and the second in 1885.
Gopuram
In the Dravida style of temple architec-
ture, which was mainly prevalent in
southern India, gopurams are the ornate
temple gateways in the center of the
temple’s perimeter walls. Temples built
in the Dravida style tend to be shorter
than temples built in the northern
Indian Nagara style, but compensate for
this by stretching over vast areas, often
forming towns in their own right. There
are usually four gopurams, one for each
[[256]]

of the cardinal directions; in some cases
these gopurams are ten stories tall and
can be seen for miles from the sur-
rounding countryside. The gopurams
were originally fortified gateways built
to restrict access to the temple, but in
present times their function is more
decorative. By dominating the skyline
around the temple—much like spires of
Gothic cathedrals—gopurams are a
pronouncement about the power of
the resident deities (and their client
rulers); they have also helped to educate
the faithful, since they are usually
covered with sculptures detailing
mythological themes.
Gora
(1267–1397?) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Gora was a potter, which by the stan-
dards of the time was a very low-status
occupation; Gora’s inclusion as one of
the Varkari saints helps underscore theGosain
devotional (bhakti) conviction that
birth status was less important than
genuine love of God. Gora is reported to
have lived most of his life at Teradhoki
village in the state of Maharashtra, but
since he is a minor Varkari figure, little is
known about his life. For further infor-
mation see G. A. Deleury, The Cult of
Vithoba, 1960; and Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories of
Indian Saints, 1982.
Obscure Religious Cults, 1962. See
also Maharashtri.
Gorakhnathi
Ascetic community who claim to be the
disciples of sage Gorakhnath and claim
to have conserved his teachings. These
ascetics are also known as the
Nathpanthis. See Nathpanthi.
Gorakhshatakam
Gorakhnath
(13th c.?) Medieval yogi and wonder-
worker who is the founder of the
Nathpanthi ascetics. There is little
doubt that Gorakhnath was a historical
person, and his teacher was named
Matsyendranath (also known as
Minanath). However, the accounts of his
life tell of him performing so many mir-
acles and wonders that they cannot be
taken as factual. He is generally believed
to have lived early in the thirteenth cen-
tury, since the Maharashtrian poet-saint
Jnaneshvar (1275–1296?) described his
own spiritual preceptor as one of
Gorakhnath’s disciples.
Tradition regards Gorakhnath not
only as a magician and a wonder-worker,
but also as the author of the
Gorakhshatakam. This text is a reli-
gious manual that gives instruction on a
specific type of yoga practiced
by Nathpanthi ascetics. The ultimate
goal of this yogic practice is to transform
the perishable elements in the physical
body into immortal elements. Whether
or not Gorakhnath authored this
text, the spiritual instructions therein
are consistent with those of the
Nathpanthi ascetics who claim to be
his disciples. According to legend,
Gorakhnath and his most accomplished
followers have never died, and their
victory over death is a sign of their
spiritual accomplishment. The most
complete source on Gorakhnath and
his followers, despite its age, is
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath
and the Kanphata Yogis, 1973;
and Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta,
(“Gorakh’s Hundred”) Text attributed to
the sage Gorakhnath. Although his
authorship is ultimately unprovable, its
teachings are consistent with those of
the Nathpanthi ascetics who claim to be
his disciples. In at least one of its forms,
as translated by Briggs, the text has 101
verses, not 100 verses as the title sug-
gests. The Gorakhshatakam gives
instruction on the type of yoga prac-
ticed by the Nathpanthi ascetics in
which the major motif is the union of
polar opposites. It begins with instruc-
tion on the structure of the subtle body,
an alternate physiological system that
resides on a different plane of existence
than gross matter, but possesses certain
correspondences to the material body.
The subtle body is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of the two divine princi-
ples, Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power). The aspirant aims to awaken a
latent spiritual energy residing in the
shakti called kundalini and move it to
union with the Shiva principle at the
crown of the head. The ultimate aim of
this practice is to gain control over the
forces that affect the body, allowing one
to become purified and immortal.
Gosain
Vernacular form of the Sanskrit word
goswami (“master of the senses”).
Although this epithet could be used to
refer to any ascetic, during British colo-
nial rule in the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries it was most commonly
[[257]]
Gosala Maskariputra
used to denote certain subgroups
among the Sanyasis, the ascetic devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. The
name was particular to Sanyasis at the
low end of the ascetic status scale, such
as the Nathpanthis or the Naga (mili-
tant) Sanyasis, who were often recruited
from the lower classes of society.
Gosala Maskariputra
(5th c. B.C.E.?) According to tradition, a
philosopher who was a contemporary of
the Buddha. Gosala is believed to be the
founder of the Ajivikas, an extinct reli-
gious community whose philosophical
position is generally described as fatal-
ism. In the Buddhist and Jain literature
he is generally referred to as Makkhali
Gosala (“cow-shed”), referring to his
lowly birth.
Goshala
(“abode of cows”) In modern India, a
goshala is a rest home for aged, infirm,
and unproductive cows, where they can
live for the rest of their lives in peace and
happiness. Goshalas are usually estab-
lished and supported as acts of religious
merit, to provide for cows that would
either be slaughtered or abandoned.
These institutions are built as a sign of
respect for cattle, which is one of the
most pervasive ideas in Hindu culture.
Goswami, Jiva
(ca. late 16th c.) A pivotal figure in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
along with his uncles Sanatana Goswami
and Rupa Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by the
poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstat-
ic devotionalism. The Goswamis were
southern brahmins by origin, but their
family had resettled in northern India.
Their lives were transformed when
Rupa and Sanatana met Chaitanya.
Chaitanya dispatched the brothers to
Brindavan, the village where the god
Krishna is believed to have spent his
[[258]]

childhood, with instructions to settle
there and reclaim it as a holy place. The
three Goswamis lived there for several
decades, reclaiming the sacred sites
(tirthas), having temples built, and
above all providing the ideas and insti-
tutions that defined the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community. Jiva was a ver-
satile scholar who wrote on many dif-
ferent aspects of Vaishnava devotion,
but is best known for his works on
metaphysics, which provide the com-
munity’s basic philosophical under-
pinnings. For further information see
Sushil Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal, from Sanskrit and Bengali
Sources, 1961.
Goswami, Rupa
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, a pivotal figure
in the establishment of the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community, along with his
brother Sanatana Goswami, and his
nephew Jiva Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic
devotionalism. Records indicate that the
Goswamis were brahmins whose fami-
lies originally hailed from the
Karnataka region. The family had set-
tled in Bengal, where Rupa and
Sanatana were in the service of a local
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched
the brothers to Brindavan, the village
where the god Krishna is believed to
have spent his childhood, with instruc-
tions to settle there and reclaim it as a
holy place. The three Goswamis lived
there for several decades, reclaiming the
sacred sites (tirthas), having temples
built, and above all providing the ideas
and institutions that defined the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community. Rupa
was a passionate devotee (bhakta) of
Krishna, but also had interests as a
dramatist and a scholar. In addition toGovardhan
writing poetry as a vehicle for expressing
devotion to Krishna, he also focused on
analyzing bhakti as an emotional expe-
rience. He is most famous for enumerating
the five modes of devotion, explaining
the different possible ways to experi-
ence the love of God. For further infor-
mation see Sushil Kumar De, Early
History of the Vaishnava Faith and
Movement in Bengal, 1961; and
Shrivatsa Goswami, “Radha” in John
Stratton Hawley and Donna Wulff (eds.),
The Divine Consort, 1982.
Goswami, Sanatana
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, and a pivotal
figure in the establishment of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community, along
with his brother Rupa Goswami and his
nephew Jiva Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic
devotionalism. Records indicate that the
Goswamis were brahmins whose fami-
lies originally hailed from the
Karnataka region. The family had set-
tled in Bengal, where Rupa and
Sanatana were in the service of a local
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched
the brothers to Brindavan, the village
where the god Krishna is believed to
have spent his childhood, with instruc-
tions to settle there and reclaim it as a
holy place. The three Goswamis lived
there for several decades, reclaiming the
sacred sites (tirthas), having temples
built, and above all providing the ideas
and institutions that defined the
Gaudiya
Vaishnava
community.
Sanatana was more of a devotee
(bhakta) than a scholar. This is evident
in his written works, which tend to
be either devotional songs or commen-
taries on religious texts. Sanatana’s most
famous text is the Hari-bhakti-vilasa
(“The delight of devotion to Hari”), for
which he wrote a commentary as well.
For further information see Sushil
Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal, 1961.
Gotra
A word for exogamous lineages.
Lineages are particularly stressed
among brahmins, although the status
associated with some lineages some-
times led other twice-born groups to
adopt them as well. The word literally
means “cow pen,” and by extension the
family is associated with a particular
herd of cattle. Brahmins were believed
to be descended from the seven sages—
Kashyapa, Vasishtha, Bhrgu, Gautama,
Atri, Bharadvaja, and Vishvamitra—
with each family taking as its gotra the
name of the sage believed to be its prog-
enitor. The only situation in which it was
really important was in marriages, since
marriage within the gotra was forbid-
den. After marriage, a woman would
adopt the gotra of her husband as part
of her new identity. Since this practice
was observed by brahmins, having
a gotra became something of a status
symbol. This led other twice-born
groups to imitate the brahmins and
adopt gotras as well.
Govardhan
Sacred mountain in the western part
of the Mathura district of the state of
Uttar Pradesh. According to Hindu
mythology, this was the mountain
that the god Krishna held up as
an umbrella over the Braj region to
protect its inhabitants from the storms
generated by the wrath of Indra, god
of the storm. According to the tradi-
tions of the Pushti Marg, a religious
community founded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531), a particular image of
Krishna called Shrinathji was discov-
ered by Vallabhacharya on Mount
Govardhan, after Krishna revealed its
location to the saint in a dream.
[[259]]
Govardhan Math
Govardhan Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
traditionally believed to have been estab-
lished by the great philosopher Shank-
aracharya; the others are the Sharada
math, Shringeri math, and Jyotir math.
These four sacred centers are each associ-
ated with one of the four geographical cor-
ners of the Indian subcontinent; the
Govardhan math is in the eastern quarter,
in the city of Puri on the shores of the Bay
of Bengal. Shankaracharya is traditionally
cited as the founder of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, the most prestigious Hindu
ascetic order. The Dashanami (“ten
names”) ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva and are divided into ten divi-
sions, each with a different name. These
ten divisions are organized into four larger
organizational groups—Anandawara,
Bhogawara, Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—
each of which has two or three of the ten
divisions and is associated with one of the
four sacred centers. Of these, the
Govardhan math is associated with the
Bhogawara group.
Govardhan Puja
Festival celebrated on the first day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November), the day after
the festival Diwali. The charter myth for
this festival comes from the mythology of
the god Krishna, and this festival is cele-
brated mainly in the Braj region south of
modern Delhi, where Krishna is said to
have lived. According to legend, this is the
day that Krishna lifted up Mount
Govardhan to protect the people of Braj
from the storms sent by the god Indra.
Indra was angry because Krishna had per-
suaded the village elders to make offerings
to Mount Govardhan, rather than to Indra.
Krishna held up the mountain as an
umbrella for an entire week, after which
Indra admitted defeat. On this day pilgrims
circle Mount Govardhan on foot. The
mountain is seen as a physical manifesta-
tion of Krishna himself, and because of
Krishna’s association with cattle, they also
adorn and worship cows and bulls. In
memory of the offerings given to Mount
[[260]]

Govardhan in that story, as well as the
mountain of offerings (particularly milk-
based sweets) that are prepared for cele-
bration in modern times, the festival is also
known as Annakut (“mountain of food”).
Govinda
(“gaining cows”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, referring to his childhood in
Braj as a cowherd. See Krishna.
Govindswami
(late 16th c.) One of the poets of the ash-
tachap, a group of eight northern Indian
bhakti (devotional) poets. The composi-
tions of these eight poets are used for
liturgical purposes by the Pushti Marg, a
religious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of Krishna. The
Pushti Marg named all eight poets as
members of the community and associ-
ates of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. Govindswami is believed to
have been an associate of Vitthalnath. In
his poetry, Govindswami writes from the
perspective of a companion (sakhi) to
Krishna’s consort Radha, and in this
voice not only gives a picture of the
divine activities, but also an extremely
detailed picture of everyday village life.
Grace
The notion of divine grace has been and
remains vitally important in Hindu devo-
tional religiosity (bhakti), although it is
perceived differently among the various
devotional movements in Hinduism. In
the Tamil devotionalism that marked the
earliest articulation of the bhakti move-
ment, the two major religious groups, the
Alvars and the Nayanars, both stressed
the utter transcendence of their chosen
god and the gulf between God and human
beings. In this understanding, grace
became something only God could give
freely. Only God had the power to trans-
form human beings and bring their souls
to final liberation—a notion of grace not
far removed from Christian ideas. Within
the Shrivaishnavas, a later southernGrand Bassin
The Grand Bassin, a mountain lake on the island of Mauritius. Just before the festival of Shivaratri,
crowds of people gather at this lake and draw water to offer to the god Shiva.
Indian religious community, there was a
debate whether liberation was primarily
achieved through one’s faith or one’s
works. The Tengalai school favored faith
and argued that liberation came from God
alone. In contrast, the Vadagalai school
favored a person’s works and countered
that humans had to respond to divine
grace in order for their souls to gain final
liberation. The importance of divine tran-
scendence and omnipotence, as articulat-
ed by Tamil devotionalism, has remained
an important part of Hindu piety, even to
the present time.
Southern Indian bhakti tended to
express the deity-devotee (bhakta) rela-
tionship using images of master and ser-
vant.
Northern
Indian
bhakti,
particularly that which focused on the
gods Rama and Krishna, stressed other
images of this relationship: friend and
friend, parent and child, lover and
beloved. These differing conceptions
necessarily influenced the notion of
grace, ranging from the idea of God as
other and saving power to the sacred
quality coming from sharing everyday
interactions. In the latter, grace is mani-
fested through being able to take part in
God’s divine play (lila), to play with God,
and thus take part in the divine world. In
this model, God is immanent rather
than transcendent, and divine activity
comes in the guise of sharing the ordi-
nary activities of human life. All of these
models can be found in modern Hindu
religious life, although certain ones are
more strongly associated with particular
groups or religious communities.
Grammarians
Philosophical school based in the
teachings of Bhartrhari (7th c. C.E.). The
Grammarians conceived of Brahman, the
Ultimate Reality, as being manifested in
sound, particularly the sound of the spo-
ken word. They centered their cult around
the word Om, a word that is described as
the source of all things in the Mandukya
Upanishad, an early speculative text. For
further information see Harold Coward
and K. Kunjunni Raja (eds.), The
Philosophy of the Grammarians, 1990.
Grand Bassin
Mountain lake in the southern part of
Mauritius, an island in the Indian
Ocean 1,200 miles east of the east
African coast. The Hindu population of
Mauritius have established sacred sites
(tirthas) in the landscape that often
[[261]]
Grhastha
relate or correspond to sacred land-
scape features on the Indian subconti-
nent. Grand Bassin is a remote and
high lake, which the Hindus on
Mauritius call the Ganges River. In the
days before the festival of Shivaratri
(February–March), great crowds of peo-
ple come to Grand Bassin. They bathe
(snana) in the lake, worship at the tem-
ples surrounding it, and then draw pots
of water from the lake and carry them
on foot back to their homes. The pil-
grims time their departures to arrive at
their homes on the evening of
Shivaratri, and the water is offered to
the god Shiva in their local temple. This
sort of rite can be found in several
places in India, most notably at
Vaidyanath in Bihar.
Grhastha
(“householder”) In the dharma litera-
ture, which gives instruction on reli-
gious practice and duties, a grhastha is
a “householder.” According to the
dharma literature, the grhastha is the
second of the four stages of life
(ashramas) in the life of a man born
into one of the three twice-born
groups—brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya—which have the highest reli-
gious and social status in Indian soci-
ety. The householder stage is preceded
by that of the brahmacharin or celi-
bate student, and succeeded by the
vanaprastha or forest-dweller, and the
sanyasi or wandering ascetic. In prac-
tical terms, for most men the house-
holder stage is the final stage of life,
since most men do not choose to move
beyond it. The householder stage
begins with marriage, and leads to
raising and supporting a family. This
stage is an active and fruitful time of
life, and the householder is indispens-
able to society since his labors and
resources support those in the other
three stages of life. This is also the only
stage of life in which sexual inter-
course is not explicitly forbidden,
since the general fruitfulness of this
stage of life is expressed through pro-
[[262]]

creation. A householder is permitted
to pursue three of the traditional aims
of life (purushartha): wealth (artha),
desire (kama), and religious duty
(dharma). Given the depth and rich-
ness of the householder’s life, it is not
surprising that many men have little
inclination to move on to the two
other stages.
Grhya Sutras
(“aphorisms on domestic [rites]”) The
name given to texts that outline correct
procedures for domestic religious cere-
monies, in particular the daily rites
connected with the domestic sacred
fire, and the life-cycle rites known as
the samskaras. The latter rites span
the time before birth to the memorial
offerings after death and are still
observed by many pious Hindus,
although the rites have been modified
over time. In theory, a Grhya Sutra
should be one part of a Kalpa Sutra,
which should also contain prescrip-
tions for Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras)
and for appropriate human behavior
(Dharma Sutras). In reality this doesn’t
always seem to be the case, since aside
from the three complete surviving
Kalpa Sutras, there are at least six
other Grhya Sutras, indicating that
these texts were composed indepen-
dently. See also Veda.
Guardians of the Directions
A collection of eight deities, each
associated with one of the four cardi-
nal and intermediate directions. In
their traditional order, the deities are
as follows: Indra for the east; Agni for
the southeast; Yama for the south;
Nirriti for the southwest; Varuna for
the west; Vayu for the northwest;
Kubera for the north; and Shiva for
the northeast. Most of these are
deities who were important in the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious
texts. Except for Shiva, they were
replaced as traditions changed and
have become minor deities in modernGujarat
Hindu religious life. These eight
deities protect the directions with
which they are associated. Each direc-
tion also carries certain associations
because of its presiding deity. For
example, south is generally consid-
ered an inauspicious direction
because it is associated with Yama, the
god of death.
Gudimallam Linga
A particular linga, or symbolic form
of the god Shiva. It is reliably dated
from the second century B. C . E . and is
arguably the oldest existing Hindu
image. It is named after the place in
which it is found, the village of
Gudimallam, which is in the south-
eastern corner of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, near the border with Tamil
Nadu. Despite its venerable age, the
linga is still enshrined in its original
temple and remains an object of wor-
ship. The linga itself is a five-foot pil-
lar of polished stone, which bears a
four-foot-high carving of Shiva on its
front side. The sculptural work is
quite detailed and shows several sur-
prising features. Shiva’s hair is woven
into a turban-like shape, rather than
in the usual matted locks. Shiva has
only two arms, rather than the multi-
ple arms one commonly finds in later
images. He carries a ram in his arms,
rather than a deer—the only sculp-
ture in which a ram appears. Finally,
the figure of Shiva has no sacred
thread (yajnopavit), which became
commonplace later. The linga is also
notable for the detailed work at the
top of the pillar, which exactly models
the head of an erect penis. This is also
a departure from later iconography,
in which the top of the linga is usual-
ly smoothly rounded. Although linga
worship should be interpreted sym-
bolically as an homage to the power
behind the universe, the object’s form
is clearly phallic.
Guha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Guha is the
king of the Nishadas, a tribe who lived
on the banks of the Ganges River.
When the god Rama goes into exile
with his wife Sita and his younger
brother Lakshmana, they pass
through Guha’s kingdom. Guha
arranges for a boat to take them to the
other side of the Ganges and person-
ally conveys the three over to the other
side. Although Guha is of very low
social status, his humble services are
accepted because of his sincere devo-
tion to Rama. In the Ramayana of
Tulsidas, a later vernacular rendition
of the Ramayana that emphasizes the
power of devotion, Guha symbolizes
how sincere devotion can transcend
all social boundaries.
Gujarat
Modern Indian state, located on the
Arabian Sea at the border with
Pakistan. Gujarat is one of the so-
called linguistic states formed after
Indian independence to unite gov-
ernment people with a common lan-
guage and culture (in this case,
Gujarati). It was formed in 1960 by
splitting what was Bombay into the
present states of Gujarat and
Maharashtra. Gujarat’s presence by
the sea has given the area a long his-
tory as a trading center, beginning as
the port of Lothal in the Indus Valley
civilization, one of the earliest, highly
developed urban cultures.
Most of the Indians who migrated
to Kenya, Uganda, and other parts of
East Africa are Gujaratis; substantial
numbers of Gujaratis have migrated to
the United Kingdom and the United
States, especially New York City.
Gujarat is also famous as the birth-
place of Mohandas Gandhi. The
Sabarmati Ashram near the city of
Ahmedabad in Gujarat was his home
base during much of the struggle for
independence. Gujarat is also famous
for several prominent holy places:
[[263]]
Gujarati
Guler was the birthplace of the Pahari style of miniature painting.
This Pahari painting depicts the god Rama killing a female demon.
Dwaraka, which is the site of
Krishna’s mythical kingdom, as well as
the location of the Sharada math of
the Dashanami Sanyasis religious
community; Somnath, which is one of
the twelve sites where Shiva,
in his first manifestation as the
jyotirlinga, came to earth; and
Girnar, which is famous as a dwelling-
place for ascetics. For general
information about Gujarat and all
the regions of India, an accessible
reference is Christine Nivin et al.,
India. 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Gujarati
One of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are the Maharashtris,
Karnatas, Andhras, and Dravidas.
As their name indicates, the core region
for Gujarati brahmins is the modern
state of Gujarat.
[[264]]

Gujjar
In traditional northern Indian society,
the Gujjars were a jati whose heredi-
tary occupation was herding cattle,
buffalo, and other livestock. Jatis
were endogamous subgroups in
traditional Indian society that
were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation.
Guler
Historical site in the Shiwalik hills,
the foothills of the Himalaya
Mountains. In the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries these hills were
the home to many small kingdoms,
which served as important sites for the
development of arts and culture. In
Guler, the Pahari style of miniature
painting first appeared in its devel-
oped form. The developed Pahari style
differs from the earlier Rajasthani
style in its emphasis on more linear
drawing—perhaps influenced byGuptakashi
European art—and a more restrained
use of color, both of which tend to give
the paintings a more lyrical feel.
Guna
(“quality”) A fundamental concept that
originated in the Samkhya philosophi-
cal school, but has become one of the
key ideas in the Hindu worldview. The
word guna literally means “strand,” and
by extension a “quality,” of which there
are believed to be three: sattva (“good-
ness”), rajas (“passion”), and tamas
(“darkness”). According to the Samkhyas,
in the time before the evolution of
prakrti (primal matter), these three
qualities were in perfect equilibrium.
As mental activity began to disturb the
balance, prakrti evolved into the sub-
jective self and the objective world. All
things and beings in the world have
these three basic qualities, but their
nature and tendencies differ according
to the differing proportions. The quali-
ty sattva is always positive and carries
associations with goodness, truth,
wholesomeness, health, cognitive thought,
and deep-rooted religious life. The
quality tamas is always negative and is
associated with darkness, ignorance,
sloth, spoilage, and death. Rajas can
be either positive or negative,
depending on the context. It is nega-
tive when one becomes a slave to
one’s passions, blinding one to careful
and conscious thought. However,
one’s passions can also help to engen-
der activity and industriousness.
Although much of Samkhya meta-
physics has been long discredited, the
notion of all things drawing their ten-
dencies from the differing proportion of
these three gunas has become an
accepted part of Indian culture.
Gupta Dynasty
(ca. 350–550) Northern Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in the
lower Ganges River basin. The Gupta cap-
ital was initially at Pataliputra, identified
with the city of Patna in the modern state
of Bihar, but was later moved to the city
of Allahabad, which lies at the conflu-
ence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.
At its zenith under Chandra Gupta II,
the Guptas controlled all of northern
India and modern Pakistan, as well as
the eastern Coromandel Coast all the
way south to modern Madras. The
Gupta reign is associated with an efflo-
rescence of Indian culture, and with the
revival of Hinduism in northern India.
The force behind both of these trends
was the royal patronage of the Gupta
kings. According to tradition, one of
their court poets was Kalidasa, who is
considered the greatest Sanskrit poet.
The Guptas are also characterized as
ardent devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, a devotion they displayed
through temple building and religious
endowments. Aside from Chandra
Gupta II, the dynasty’s most famous
rulers were his father Samudra Gupta
and his grandfather Chandra Gupta I.
Guptakashi
(“hidden Kashi”) Village and sacred site
(tirtha) in the Himalaya Mountains of
the state of Uttar Pradesh. Guptakashi
is located on the Mandakini River, one
of the Himalayan tributaries that com-
bine to create the Ganges River. The
site’s charter myth is connected to the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are the
protagonists of the epic Mahabharata.
According to local legend, the Pandavas
went to Benares (also known as Kashi)
seeking an audience with the god Shiva,
but Shiva slipped away and hid in
Guptakashi. Guptakashi’s two holiest
sites are temples to Shiva. At one of
these temples, Shiva is worshiped in his
form as Vishvanath, the “Lord of the
Universe,” who is the presiding deity at
the most important temple in Benares.
The other is dedicated to his form as
Ardhanarishvara, in which the left side
of the image has female form, dress, and
ornamentation, whereas the right side is
male. The local claim that Guptakashi is
a “hidden” Kashi shows the fluidity of
the Indian sacred landscape, in which
[[265]]
Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty
the sacredness of one place can be
appropriated by another. This is a way to
claim some of the splendor of Kashi as a
sacred site and to attribute power to a
much smaller and more remote site.
Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty
(7th–11th c.) Northern Indian dynasty
that filled the political void created by
the collapse of the Pushyabhuti dynasty
late in the seventh century. Like the
Pushyabhutis, the Gurjara-Pratiharas
initially had their capital at the city of
Kanyakubja, on the Ganges River in
eastern part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh. At its peak early in the eighth
century, the Gurjara-Pratiharas con-
trolled most of the Indian subcontinent
north of the Vindhya Mountains, and
the Ganges basin well into West Bengal.
The dynasty was weakened when the
kingdom split in two in the mid-eighth
century, with the Gurjaras reigning over
the kingdom’s western part from their
capital at Ujjain and the Pratiharas
remaining in Kanyakubja. Both king-
doms were engaged in constant warfare
with the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which
controlled central India south of the
Vindhya Mountains; they were also
harassed by Muslim raiders from mod-
ern day Afghanistan. The Gurjara king-
dom was conquered by the Chandella
dynasty in 1019 and became restricted
to the lower Ganges basin. It finally dis-
appeared about 1050 C.E.
Guru
(“heavy”) In its most commonly accepted
meaning, a guru is a spiritual teacher or
religious mentor; in an extended sense
the word can refer to any teacher. The
term is often used in the arts, where the
relationship between master and disci-
ple is still a vital part of learning. The
relationship between guru and disciple
(shishya) is one of the most fundamen-
tal and enduring facets of Hinduism and
is the accepted model for the transmis-
sion of religious teaching, tradition, and
authority. Aside from transmitting
[[266]]

knowledge, the guru-disciple connec-
tion also assumes a close and trusting
relationship. The guru takes responsibil-
ity for the disciple’s development, based
on an assessment of the disciple’s
strengths, inclinations, and capacities,
while the disciple faithfully follows the
guru’s direction. The literal meaning of
the word guru is “heavy,” indicating the
impression they have on the lives of
their students—weighty and marked. As
a guiding presence, a guru is considered
indispensable for true spiritual attain-
ment. This is particularly true of secret
traditions such as tantra, in which the
guru’s transmission of authority gives
the disciple the necessary adhikara or
“qualifications” for practice.
Guru
(2) Sanskrit term for the planet Jupiter.
It is called Guru (“heavy”) because it is
considered the heaviest and most
important planet in one’s horoscope.
Guru Maharaj Ji
(b. 1957) Modern religious teacher and
founder of the Divine Light Mission. In
the early 1970s, Guru Maharaj Ji enjoyed
phenomenal but fleeting success during
a tour of the United States. Maharaj was
the fourth son of Hans Ji Maharaj, a
respected religious figure who founded
the Prem Nagar Ashram in Haridwar, a
sacred city on the Ganges River in the
state of Uttar Pradesh. Maharaj’s father
died when he was eight, after which his
mother announced that Maharaj had
inherited his father’s mantle. As with
many modern Hindu missionary fig-
ures, Maharaj’s religious message
stressed the need for devotion to an
enlightened master, which he claimed
to be. At fourteen, he came to the United
States to considerable success. It quickly
dissipated when he and his mother dis-
agreed over his lifestyle and his marriage
to an American woman. He later recon-
ciled with his family, but not before his
mother had named his eldest brother
Satpal as successor to the family line.Gyan Vapi
Guru Purnima
Religious holiday falling on the full
moon (purnima) in the lunar month of
Ashadh (June–July). Guru Purnima is a
day of respect and reverence to one’s
guru, a word that has historically indi-
cated a religious preceptor, but is used
now for any teacher, adviser, or mentor.
In the dharma literature, a young man
is to spend his adolescence as a member
of his guru’s household, receiving room,
board, and instruction. In return he ren-
ders to his guru obedience and loyalty.
On Guru Purnima, a guru’s students are
directed to enshrine and worship their
guru as a deity, giving their guru gifts
and fees, according to their means.
Modern Hindus celebrate this day in
various ways, depending on the type of
guru they have. Although some religious
preceptors are enshrined and wor-
shiped, this practice is not always per-
formed. However, modern Hindus still
celebrate this day by paying particular
honor and homage to their teachers.
This day falls on the full moon, which is
associated with completion and perfec-
tion—the same qualities that gurus are
considered to have. This day is also
known as Vyas Purnima, since the sage
Vyasa was renowned as a great guru.
Gurutalpaga
(“going to the guru’s bed”) In the dharma
literature, which outlined rules for reli-
gious duty and appropriate behavior,
Gurutalpaga was one of the four great
crimes that made one an outcast from
society. This particular offense was com-
mitted by having sexual relations with
the wife of one’s guru or religious
teacher. Since the disciple is considered
a member of the guru’s family and must
treat the guru with reverence and loyalty,
this was obviously a serious breach of
trust. Since these disciples are adoles-
cent men and many of their gurus may
have had wives much younger than
themselves, such proximity could have
easily generated serious temptation and
required a strict prohibition to maintain
appropriate relationships. The gravity of
this offense can be seen by the penances
prescribed for its expiation (prayash-
chitta). According to the dharma litera-
ture, the offender could either tear off
his genitals, or embrace the red-hot stat-
ue of a woman while lying on a red-hot
iron bed. In either case it was expected
that this expiation would result in his
death, although the texts always note
that death blots out the offense.
Guruvayur
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Thrussoor dis-
trict in the southern Indian state of
Kerala, a short distance inland from the
Arabian Sea. Guruvayur is most famous
for a temple to the god Vishnu, wor-
shiped in his form as Krishna, and the
temple’s main image is of Krishna as a
young boy just past toddler age.
According to the temple’s charter myth,
the image at Guruvayur was originally at
Krishna’s mythic kingdom in the city of
Dwaraka, on the Arabian Sea in the
northern Indian state of Gujarat. When
Dwaraka was destroyed by floods, the
image was saved from destruction by
Guru, the planet Jupiter, and Vayu, the
god of wind. These two deities brought
the image to Kerala, and in their honor
the place was named Guruvayur.
Guruvayur’s mythic charter also
describes the site’s power to heal ail-
ments such as rheumatism and leprosy.
This healing power is a great attraction
in modern times, not only for people
with rheumatism, skin diseases, and
other afflictions, but also for childless
women seeking children and pregnant
women seeking an easy delivery and a
happy child.
Gyan Vapi
(“well of knowledge”) A well that is the
sole part of the original Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares. The tem-
ple’s name refers to the god Shiva in his
form as Vishvanath, “Lord of the
Universe,” and was one of the most
sacred Hindu sites in medieval India. In
[[1669]]
 the armies of the Moghul emperor
[[267]]
Gyan Vapi, Battle of
Aurangzeb razed the temple and built a
mosque in its place. Although the tem-
ple’s destruction is usually portrayed as
an act of Muslim iconoclasm, according
to Gyan Vapi’s account, Aurangzeb may
have also intended it as a political mes-
sage to punish local rebellion. According
to local legend, the image of Shiva as
Vishvanath was thrown into the well to
protect it from desecration, and it
remains there to this day.
Gyan Vapi, Battle of
Battle reportedly fought in Benares by
the Naga ascetic warriors of the
Mahanirvani Akhara. According to a
handwritten book in the akhara’s
archives, in 1664 the akhara’s soldiers
won a great victory near the Gyan Vapi
well. This document simply states that
the Sanyasis were victorious against the
forces of “the Sultan,” although histori-
ans have inferred that this figure was the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb. If the story
is true, this battle may have been a con-
tributing factor in Aurangzeb’s decision
to raze the Vishvanath temple in 1669.
In light of this claim, it is possible that
the temple’s destruction was motivated
not simply by intolerant iconoclasm,
but by the desire to inflict punishment
for resistance and rebellion.
[[268]]
Halebid
## H
Hair
According to traditional Hindu notions
regarding purity and impurity (ashaucha),
head and facial hair trap and retain rit-
ual impurity. In ordinary cases this
impurity is removed by simple washing
in running water, just as for the rest of
the body. In cases of particularly violent
impurity, such as that connected with
death (maranashaucha), men will often
conclude the period of impurity by com-
pletely shaving both their heads and
beards. They may also have their nails
cut, probably reflecting that conviction
that any dispensable parts of the body
should be removed as a way to get rid of
any residual impurity.
Shaving the head is also the major
feature in the chudakarana, the tonsure
ceremony that marks the ritual conclu-
sion of infancy to remove any residual
impurities left from childbirth. Among
adults such head shaving is usually
restricted to men; women usually offer a
token lock of hair as a symbol for the
whole, although women may have
their heads shaved to fulfill a religious
vow. While shaving the head is fairly
common, shaving the body hair is not—
the Sanskrit language has different
words for these two types of hair, and
they are considered to be different
things entirely.
Hala
(“plow”) In Hindu iconography, the
branch of study concerned with the rep-
resentation of various figures, the hala is
an ordinary Indian plow, which repre-
sents farming; it is also considered a
weapon. The hala is most often associated
with the avatars of the god Vishnu, but
the only figure who always bears it is
Krishna’s brother Balarama, for whom
one of the epithets is Haladhara (“bear-
ing a plow”).
Haladhara
(“bearing a plow”) Epithet of Balarama,
elder brother to the god Krishna.
Balarama was given this name because
of his strong associations with farmers
and farming, and also because he
occasionally used the plow itself as
a weapon.
On one occasion he is said to have
menaced the Yamuna River with his
plow when he was displeased with the
course she was taking. This threat to dig
a new channel for her induced the
Yamuna her to change her course to one
with which Balarama was happier.
Halahala
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
deadly poison produced when the
gods and demons churn the Ocean
of Milk. The gods and demons churn
the ocean to produce amrta, the nectar
of immortality. Yet their action pro-
duces not only the amrta, but also its
antithesis, the halahala poison. This is
an event of great peril, since if left
unchecked this poison is so powerful
that it will destroy the earth. The poi-
son is neutralized by the god Shiva,
who holds it in his throat without swal-
lowing it. The poison turns his throat
blue, hence one of his epithets is
Nilakanth, “the blue-throated [one].”
See also Tortoise avatar.
Halebid
Village in the southern Indian state of
Karnataka, about sixty miles northwest
of the city of Mysore. As at its sister city,
Belur, Halebid is known for a magnifi-
cent collection of temples from
the Hoysala dynasty, who ruled
western Karnataka from the eleventh
to thirteenth centuries C.E. The
most notable site at Halebid is the
magnificent Hoysaleshvar Temple,
[[269]]
Hampi
Ruins of the city of Hampi. These structures were once a part
of the capital of the powerful Vijayanagar empire.
dedicated to Shiva in his form as Lord
of the Hoysalas.
At both Belur and Halebid, the tem-
ples were built from a particular type of
stone—variously described as chlorite
schist, steatite, or soapstone—that is
quite soft when newly quarried, but
gradually hardens with exposure to air.
This initial malleability makes the stone
easy to carve, and resulted in the lush
detail characteristic of Hoysala temples.
Architecturally speaking, Hoysala
temples have certain unique features:
a central hall connecting three star-
shaped sanctuaries, and temple towers
(shikharas) composed of well-defined
horizontal tiers, rather than the
continuous upward sweep characteris-
tic of the northern Indian Nagara archi-
tectural style.
Hampi
Deserted city in central Karnataka,
about 170 miles northwest of the state’s
capital, Bangalore. Hampi was the capi-
tal of the Vijayanagar empire (1336–1565
C.E.), which at its peak in the early six-
teenth century controlled most of the
[[270]]

Indian peninsula south of the Narmada
River. The empire’s wealth primarily
stemmed from its control of the spice
and cotton trade—both highly valuable
commodities at the time—and the
city of Hampi was built on a scale to
reflect its importance. The empire came
to an abrupt end after the battle of
Talikota in 1565, when the last
Vijayanagar king, Rama Raja, was
defeated by a coalition of Muslim sul-
tans from further north in the Deccan.
The city was sacked by the invading
sultans, and has been deserted ever
since. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
Hamsa
The name for the Barheaded Goose
(Anser indicus), a bird with several
important symbolic associations; the
most significant is purity and transcen-
dence, since the bird’s color is largely
white. It flies at very high altitudes,
and it is reputed to nest in Lake
Manasarovar in the high Himalayas,
the region believed to be the land of
the gods. Since it is popularly believed to
be able to separate milk and water—Hanuman
drinking for former, and discarding the
latter—the hamsa is also a symbol for
a discriminating person, who is able
to take counsel from many different
people, and to separate the good from
the bad.
Perhaps because of these associa-
tions, the hamsa is also the name for a
particular type of Hindu ascetic. The
Hamsa ascetics were described as peri-
patetic—they were directed to stay no
more than one night in a village or five
nights in a town. They were also directed
to perform different sorts of ascetic
practices, such as subsisting on cow’s
urine or dung, fasting (upavasa) for a
month at a time, or observing the chan-
drayana rite, a fast in which one
increases and decreases one’s food con-
sumption according to the waxing and
waning of the moon.
Hanuman
Monkey-headed Hindu god. Hanuman
originally appears in the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics,
where he is described as a minister
of the monkey king Sugriva and a
devoted servant of Rama, the god-king
who is the epic’s protagonist. Despite
Hanuman’s seemingly minor place in
the Hindu pantheon, he is an enor-
mously popular deity in modern India,
because he gives humans a god essen-
tially like themselves (or as they would
like to be) but on a greater scale and
with greater capacity.
Hanuman is said to have been born
of a union between the wind-god, Vayu,
and the nymph Anjana. After his birth
the infant Hanuman is continually hun-
gry, and one day he attempts to eat the
sun. Indra, the king of the gods and
ruler of heaven, is incensed at Hanuman’s
action, and strikes the infant with a
thunderbolt, breaking his jaw (hanu).
Vayu becomes very angry upon learning
of his son’s injury and ceases to perform
his usual activities. Since in Indian phys-
iology winds are responsible for all inter-
nal functions—including digestion,
respiration, and elimination—Vayu’s
Image of Hanuman, a monkey-headed god who is
a devoted servant of the god Rama. He plays a
pivotal role in the Hindu epic the Ramayana.
strike means that no one can live a nor-
mal life. After a short time the gods real-
ize their predicament and beg Vayu for
forgiveness; he is placated when each of
the gods promises to give Hanuman a
divine gift.
By virtue of these divine gifts,
Hanuman gains great powers. He is
immensely strong, and his image por-
trays him with bulging muscles. He is
also skilled as a healer, both through his
skill with herbs and natural medicines,
and his magical abilities to protect peo-
ple from evil supernatural beings.
Among his most unusual divine gifts are
the power to live as long as he likes and
to choose the time of his death.
His greatest virtue, and many would
say the real source of his power, is his
devotion (bhakti) to Rama. In the
Ramayana, Hanuman plays a pivotal
role in advancing the story. Hanuman is
sent out with a troop of other monkeys
to search for Sita, Rama’s kidnapped
wife, and after a long and arduous
search finally finds her imprisoned in
the kingdom of Lanka.
[[271]]
Hanuman Chalisa
Hanuman plays an even greater role
in the Ramcharitmanas (a vernacular
version of the Ramayana written by
Tulsidas), in which he is transformed
from a powerful monkey servant to the
devotee (bhakta), whose only aim is to
serve Rama with loving devotion. This
devotion precludes any type of worldly
attachment, including marriage and
family, and Hanuman remains a model
for a religious lifestyle stressing celibate
asceticism. In Indian culture, celibacy is
perceived as a source of power, since it
prevents the loss of a man’s vital forces
that takes place with ejaculation.
Yet for Hanuman’s devotees, his
greatest virtue is not his strength, but his
ability to act as an intermediary to
Rama, who is usually perceived as far
more remote from human affairs.
Because Hanuman is also a devotee,
people feel an affinity and kinship with
him, even though his powers are far
greater than theirs. In fact, they believe
that messages conveyed by Hanuman
have a better chance of reaching Rama’s
presence and getting action. In a text
aptly named the “Letter of Petition”
(Vinaya Patrika), the poet-saint
Tulsidas appoints Hanuman as his mes-
senger, in the full confidence that his
plea will be heard in the divine court.
Hanuman’s intimate access to divine
power, his own undeniable strengths,
and his perceived accessibility and sym-
pathy have all combined to make him
one of the most widely worshiped
deities in India, and one who crosses
sectarian boundaries.
Because of his service to Rama, he
is usually counted as a Vaishnava or
devotee of the Vishnu. Yet in an
interesting twist, Hanuman is also
considered to be an avatar or ”incarna-
tion” of the god Shiva, and is thus
revered by the Shaivites, Shiva’s
devotees. As a protective deity,
Hanuman is often worshiped on
astrologically inauspicious days, to
keep these inauspicious forces at
bay. His prodigious strength, celibate
lifestyle, and single-minded devotion
have made him the patron deity
[[272]]

of Indian wrestlers, who strive to imitate
him as they train.
Finally, he plays an important role as
a healer and sustainer. On one hand, he
is famous as an exorcist, helping people
get rid of evil spirits. On the other, he
preserves life for those who know his
special mantra, which gives them the
power—as he had—to choose their time
of death. Given his importance in mod-
ern Hindu life, Hanuman is only now
receiving the attention he deserves. For
more information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1982.
Hanuman Chalisa
(“Hanuman’s forty”) Forty poetic stanzas
in praise of the god Hanuman, written in
Hindi. A signature line (bhanita) at the
end of the text attributes it as written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623),
best known as the composer of the
Ramcharitmanas, a vernacular version
of the epic Ramayana.
Short texts like the Hanuman Chalisa
are often sung as a devotional act, or as
an established part of worship, and in
many cases people can recite the text by
heart. The text is written in the chaupai
meter, the predominant meter in the
Ramcharitmanas.
The text begins with a description of
Hanuman’s physical features, then
relates his devotion to Rama and
his heroic deeds in the Ramayana. The
closing verses reiterate Hanuman’s
power, promise benefits as a result of the
recitation of the verses, and reclaim
Tulsidas’s wish that Hanuman will reside
in his heart.
Hanuman Jayanti
Festival of the god Hanuman’s birthday.
In southern India, this is celebrated on
the full moon in the lunar month of
Chaitra (March–April), whereas in
northern India it is more commonly cel-
ebrated on the fourteenth day of the
dark (waning) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). This latter
date reflects the date of Shivaratri, theHaridwar
most important festival of Shiva, which
is celebrated on the fourteenth day of
the waning half of the month Phalgun
(usually in February). The two festivals
are associated because Hanuman is
sometimes deemed an avatar or “incar-
nation” of Shiva, come to earth to serve
the god-king Rama.
Although Hanuman’s primary myth-
ic importance is as a faithful and power-
ful servant of Rama, in everyday
religious life Hanuman is a very impor-
tant deity, with a wide following. His
birthday has no prescribed celebrations,
but usually his devotees (bhakta) often
mark it with worship, festive proces-
sions, and devotional reading of reli-
gious texts, particularly the Hanuman
Chalisa and the Ramayana.
Hara
(“taking away,” “Destroyer”) Epithet of
the god Shiva. See Shiva.
Harappa
Ancient city and archeological site on
the Ravi River in Pakistan, about one
hundred miles southwest of the modern
city of Lahore. Harappa is one of the
cities of the Indus Valley civilization, a
highly developed urban culture that
flourished in the Indus Valley region
between the fourth and third millennia
B.C.E. Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have
been the most extensively excavated of
these cities, although archeological
work is proceeding in some of the oth-
ers, and the similarities between these
different cities have revealed a great deal
about this civilization’s material culture.
Hare Krishnas
Colloquial name for the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness
(ISKCON). See ISKCON.
Hari
(probably derived from the Sanskrit
verb hr, “taking away [evil]”) Epithet of
the god Vishnu, particularly in his
avatar or “incarnation” as the god
Krishna. See Vishnu and Krishna.
Haridasa
(ca. late 16th c.) Poet, singer, and devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Krishna, who
founded the sect known as the
Haridasis. According to tradition,
Haridasa was the teacher of Tansen, the
consummate musician at the court of
the Moghul emperor Akbar. Most of the
songs of Haridasa describe the love
between Radha and Krishna. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Haridwar
Sacred city (tirtha) on the Ganges River
about 140 miles northeast of Delhi.
Haridwar is one of India’s Seven Sacred
Cities. Dying in one of these cities is
believed to ensure the final liberation of
one’s soul. It is located on the edge of the
Shiwalik Hills, the foothills to the
Himalayas, and is the place where the
Ganges is believed to leave the moun-
tains and enter the northern Indian
plain. As with all the places where the
Ganges makes some natural transition,
Haridwar is considered especially holy,
and has been a pilgrimage destination
since at least the sixth century, when the
Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang reported
enormous pilgrim crowds.
Haridwar’s primary importance is as
a bathing (snana) place, and it draws
large crowds on festival days. For cen-
turies it has been an important site
for performing asthi-visarjana, the
last of the funerary rites (antyeshthi
samskara), in which the ashes of
the deceased are immersed in the
Ganges. Haridwar is also important as
the gateway to the pilgrimage sites in
the Garhwal region of the Himalayas,
and during the pilgrim season
(April–October) it serves as an impor-
tant transit and supply point to places
farther up in the mountains.
Finally, Haridwar has a long history
as a dwelling place for ascetics. It is a
major center for several ascetic groups,
[[273]]
Harihara
Crowds gather in Haridwar to bathe in the Ganges River.
[[274]]

particularly the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, trader-soldiers
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. It also serves as the winter quar-
ters for many ascetics who spend their
summers in the Himalayas. The pres-
ence of so many ascetics has had a pro-
found effect on the city’s general
character, both in the hundreds of
ashrams that are spread throughout the
city, and in the prohibitions on the sale
of eggs, meat, and liquor.his own kingdom. After gaining power,
Harihara reconverted to Hinduism,
despite having become an outcast
through his acceptance of Islam. His
example not only shows the fluidity of
religious identity in early medieval
India, but also Hindu pragmatism in
relation to the ruling powers. Although
Harihara had earlier become an outcast,
his power as ruler gave him the authori-
ty to reconvert without orthodox oppo-
sition. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
HariharaHarihara
(early 14th c.) The founder of the
Vijayanagar (“city of victory”) empire,
established in 1336, which ruled over
much of southern India for the following
two centuries. The empire took its name
from the capital city that Harihara built
near the city of Hampi in the modern
state of Karnataka.
As a boy, Harihara was captured by
soldiers of the Bahmani sultanate to the
north, and had converted to Islam in
captivity, which rendered him an outcast
in the eyes of traditional Hindus. As a
man, Harihara was sent to regain the
southern region for the sultanate, but
instead used the opportunity to establish(2) A deity seen as a combination of the
gods Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).
Behind this hybrid deity lay the convic-
tion that both of these divinities were
differing manifestations of the same
divine power.
This underlying unity was represented
in several different ways. One way was to
create a figure whose right half had the
attributes of Shiva, and whose left half
had those of Vishnu. Another method,
found most often in modern poster art,
is to display both Vishnu and Shiva in
their full forms, riding on their respec-
tive animal vehicles. Vishnu’s elephant
and Shiva’s bull are conjoined at theHarishchandra
head, in a way that one can discern the
heads of both animals, but only one can
be perceived at any given moment. Both
the elephant-bull and the divided figure
show that Vishnu and Shiva are manifes-
tations of the same divine energy, and
that the particular deity one perceives
depends on one’s perspective at the
moment. The joint Harihara figure
presents an important religious truth,
but this idea is far too abstract to
become popular or widespread. In
their everyday religious lives people
have tended to worship one or the
other of these deities, rather than their
idealized union.
Harijan
(“child of God”) Name used by
Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) to des-
ignate those social groups formerly
known as untouchables. The name
reflected Gandhi’s conviction that these
people were human beings like any oth-
ers, and thus children of God.
Unfortunately, the word harijan
can also carry a pejorative sense in
modern India. It is used for any child
whose father is unknown—with the
child’s paternity ascribed to God—and
is thus a euphemism for “bastard.” In
modern times, the people whom
Gandhi called Harijans prefer to used
the name dalit (“oppressed”), since
they feel that this more accurately
describes their social status.
Hariray
(mid-17th c.) A noted disciple of
Gokulnath (1551–1640 C.E.), the third
guru of the Pushti Marg, a religious
community founded by his grandfather
Vallabhacharya.
Aside from being a disciple, Hariray
is considered Gokulnath’s scribe. He is
the commentator on a text called the
Chaurasi Vaishnavan
ki Varta
(“Account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”),
and probably compiled the text itself
under Gokulnath’s direction. This text
describes the lives of eighty-four
Vaishnavas, or devotees (bhakta), of the
god Vishnu, all associates and disciples
of Gokulnath’s father Vitthalnath or his
grandfather Vallabhacharya. The text’s
real purpose is not to provide biogra-
phies of these figures, but to illustrate
the importance of the Pushti Marg and
its leaders. Besides the Chaurasi
Vaishnavan ki Varta, a number of poems
are also attributed to Hariray, but these
may be the work of a later figure.
Harishchandra
In Hindu mythology, a king who is
famous for his truthfulness and integrity.
In modern Hindu culture, he has
become the symbol for someone who
patiently endures undeserved suffering.
Harishchandra’s suffering is a result
of the long-standing feud between the
sages Vasishtha—his family priest—and
Vishvamitra. When Vasishtha praises
the virtue of Harishchandra, Vishvamitra
becomes determined to prove him
wrong. Disguised as an old brahmin,
Vishvamitra conjures up an imaginary
son using his magical powers and gets
Harishchandra to promise that he will
give whatever is necessary for the
boy’s wedding.
When the time comes to redeem
this promise, Vishvamitra demands
Harishchandra’s kingdom. Vishvamitra
expects that the king will balk at this
demand, but Harishchandra immedi-
ately fulfills it. Vishvamitra then
remarks that when giving a gift to a
brahmin it is customary to give a gift of
money (dakshina) and demands a
large sum. To raise this amount,
Harishchandra first sells his wife
(Chandramati) and son into slavery
and finally sells himself to an outcast,
who puts him to work burning bodies
at the cremation ground.
After enduring these miseries for
some time, Harishchandra’s son is
bitten by a snake and dies. When
Chandramati brings the body to be
burned, he does not recognize her. He
refuses to cremate the boy until the
cremation fee is paid, since this will
[[275]]
Harivamsh
cheat his master of his rightful income.
Chandramati has no money for the
fee, and after listening to her lamenta-
tions Harishchandra recognizes her
and becomes doubly miserable. The
couple finally decides that suicide is
their only escape from their misery
and make a pyre on which to burn
themselves. When Harishchandra is
about to light the pyre, the gods
appear before them, praising his right-
eousness and his commitment to his
word, and Harishchandra’s outcast
master is revealed as dharma (“right-
eousness”) incarnate. Harishchandra’s
son is restored to life, his kingdom is
restored back to him, and everyone
lives happily ever after.
Harivamsh
(d. 1552) Poet, singer, and founder of the
Radhavallabh religious community,
which is based on the figure of Radha.
Initially portrayed as the god Krishna’s
human consort, she was later consid-
ered his adulterous mistress. The
Radhavallabh community took a very
different perspective, stressing Radha’s
nature as a deity, her equality and iden-
tity with Krishna, and her status as his
lawful wife. The Radhavallabhs focused
on the love (hit) of Radha for Krishna,
and because of this emphasis the poet is
also known as “Hit Harivamsh.”
Harivamsh’s poetry treats many of
the traditional themes found in Krishna
devotionalism, but from the perspec-
tive of a female companion (sakhi). He
compiled a collection of eighty-four
poems known as the Hit-chaurasi,
which are notable both for their highly
Sanskritized language and for their
incorporation of the alamkara (“poetic
ornamentation”) tradition of earlier
Sanskrit poetry. For further information
see Charles S. J. White, The Caurasi Pad
of Sri Hit Harivams, 1977.
Harivamsha
(“lineage of Hari”) A text traditionally
considered to be an appendix to the
[[276]]

Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. The Harivamsha is one of
the important puranas, which describe
the mythology of the Hindu deities, as
well as many other facets of popular
Hindu life.
In particular, the Harivamsha is
devoted to the mythology of the god
Krishna (also known as Hari). It is espe-
cially important for the traditional sto-
ries connected with Krishna’s childhood
in the Braj region, for which it is the ear-
liest identifiable source. The episodes
described in the Harivamsha are further
developed in the Bhagavata Purana, a
later work that is considered the most
influential text for the cult of Krishna.
Harsha
(r. 606–647) Ruler in the Pushyabhuti
line, a dynasty whose capital was the
city of Kanyakubja in eastern Uttar
Pradesh. Harsha is generally considered
the greatest Pushyabhuti ruler; he con-
trolled a large part of northern India and
to some extent restored the glory of the
Gupta dynasty (350–550).
Historically, Harsha’s reign is well-
documented, in part by the Chinese pil-
grim Hsuan Tsang, whose account gives
invaluable information about Indian life
at that time. Harsha was an able and
energetic ruler who spent much of his
later life evaluating the condition of his
empire. He was also a cultured and lit-
erate man—he was the author of three
Sanskrit plays—whose court was
graced by significant literary figures,
especially the playwright Bana. After
his death, his kingdom quickly disinte-
grated when he died without an heir.
See also Pushyabhuti dynasty.
Harshacharita
(“The Deeds of Harsha”) A drama writ-
ten by the playwright Bana (7th c.),
which chronicles the emperor Harsha’s
rise to power. Bana was a member of
Harsha’s court, and thus a contempo-
rary; his tale contains some evident
exaggeration, but also a great deal ofHastinapur
historical detail. Bana was a careful
observer, and the detailed descriptions
in the Harshacharita give significant
information about courtly and everyday
life in his times.
Hartalika Teej
Hindu women’s festival also known as
Teej. See Teej.
Haryana
Modern Indian state that surrounds
Delhi, the nation’s capital, in every
direction but the east. Haryana is one of
the so-called linguistic states formed
after Indian independence, to unite
people with a common language and
culture (in this case, Hindi) under one
state government. Haryana was created
in 1966, from the Hindi-speaking
regions of the former Punjab state. It
has traditionally been an important
agricultural region, since the land is fer-
tile and productive, but more recently it
has also benefited from the attempt to
create “satellite cities” around Delhi, in
order to spread out the development in
the capital region. These efforts have
greatly raised the land values in the
areas closest to the capital. Aside from
this localized land boom, Haryana is a
largely rural state.
Haryana’s major religious sites,
which are right next to one another, are
Kurukshetra and Thanesar. The former
is cited as the battleground for the war
described in the epic Mahabharata; the
latter is named as the place that the god
Shiva was worshiped by the Pandavas,
the Mahabharata’s protagonists.
From a true historical perspective,
the level plains around the town of
Panipat have seen three decisive battles
that influenced the course of Indian his-
tory. In 1526, Babar, a central Asian
monarch who had been displaced from
his own homeland in Afghanistan,
crushed the Lodis to end the Lodi
dynasty and establish his own Moghul
dynasty. In 1556 Babar’s grandson
Akbar decimated the Sur dynasty, which
had temporarily occupied the Moghul
capitals at Delhi and Agra, and thus
reestablished Moghul rule. In 1761 an
invading Afghan army defeated the
Marathas, ending the period of Maratha
territorial expansion. For more informa-
tion, an accessible reference is Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Hashish
See charas.
Hasta
(“hand”) In Indian dance, sculpture,
and ritual, a hasta is a particular hand
position. In some cases, this hand posi-
tion may have symbolic meaning, as in
varada hasta or the “gift-giving” ges-
ture; in other cases the hasta’s name
may simply describe the shape of the
hand, as in kataka hasta, in which the
tips of the fingers are loosely joined to
the thumb. In the context of dance, all
of these gestures have been given multi-
ple symbolic meanings, and the dancer
can use these gestures to tell a story
through her gestures.
There is some overlap in meaning
between the words hasta and mudra
(“seal”), which are both used to describe
hand gestures, and the two are some-
times used interchangeably. Of the two,
mudras tend to be more strictly defined,
and to be far more stylized than hastas.
They stress the positions of the fingers,
rather than of the entire hand; the fin-
gers are always in very specific posi-
tions. Mudras always have very specific
symbolic meanings.
Hastinapur
Archeological site about sixty miles
northeast of Delhi. This site has yielded
pottery and other artifacts believed to
be from the ninth to sixth centuries
B.C.E., which would make them contem-
porary with the latest parts of the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu religious texts. In the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, Hastinapur is the capital of
[[277]]
Hatha Yoga
[[278]]

the Kauravas, a group of one hundred
brothers who are the epic’s antagonists.
Although the name of the site and the
place named in the epic matches, noth-
ing has been found to provide a connec-
tion between these two.for Shakti, and the phoneme tha to the
moon, which is a symbol of Shiva. Hatha
yoga is interpreted as the union of the
sun and moon—that is, these two cen-
ters of power are believed to exist in the
subtle body.
Hatha YogaHeavens
System of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas. Practicing this yoga is
widely believed to provide various phys-
ical benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Yet in the Yoga Sutras written
by Patanjali, the earliest systematic
treatment of yoga, these asanas are only
one part of an eight-step program that
also includes such practices as breath-
ing exercises and meditation. The pur-
pose of hatha yoga is to train and
strengthen the body so that the practi-
tioner can sit comfortably in medita-
tion. Although Hatha yoga’s emphasis is
on the body, it assumes a spiritual and
religious context that in contemporary
times has often been either evaded or
ignored—leading some Hindus to dis-
parage such yoga as simply a technique
to develop better sexual control.
A more esoteric meaning of hatha
yoga comes from the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who understand hatha yoga as
referring to processes in the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to reside
on a different plane of existence than
the actual body, but with certain corre-
spondences to the actual body. It is visu-
alized as a set of six psychic centers
(chakras) running roughly along the
course of the spine; above and below
these centers are found the two divine
principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini.
The aspirant aims to combine kundalini
with the Shiva principle at the crown of
the head; through this union, the physi-
cal body will become immortal.
According to the Nathpanthis, the
phoneme ha refers to the sun, a symbolIn Hinduism, there are believed to be
many additional planes of existence
besides the visible earthly realm. These
other planes of existence include the
heavens, which are realms of reward,
pleasure, and enjoyment. Beings are
born in heaven as a reward for their past
good deeds, and the life of the gods liv-
ing in these heavens is invariably
described as long and pleasurable. Yet
heaven is not permanent, and when
one’s karmic merit is exhausted and
one’s stay in heaven is done, one
inevitably descends from heaven to take
birth in a lower form.
In general, heaven is viewed as a dis-
traction to serious religious life. Birth in
heaven comes only through accumulat-
ing and expending an enormous
amount of religious merit generated by
past good deeds, and thus is a tremen-
dous drain on one’s accumulated spiri-
tual resources. Furthermore, once one
has been born in heaven, life is so easy
and carefree that people generally feel
no inclination to engage in religious life.
For both reasons, life in heaven is con-
sidered a goal to which people should
not aspire.
Hedgewar, Dr. K. B.
(1889–1940) Founder and first
supreme leader (sarsanghchalak) of
the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
(RSS), which he formed in the central
Indian city of Nagpur in 1925. The RSS
is a conservative Hindu organization
formed for the express purpose of
providing leadership for a revitalized
Hindu India; for most of its history it
has characterized its mission as cul-
tural, rather than religious or political.Hemp
The character of Dr. Hedgewar and
the RSS are inextricably linked to the tur-
bulent years immediately after World
War I, and the profound dislocation in
Indian society that came with the strug-
gle for independence. In his youth,
Hedgewar had been involved in the
independence movement, and for some
time even supported Mohandas
Gandhi’s Congress Party. But by the
early 1920s, he had become disillu-
sioned with Gandhi’s methods. He had
also been deeply influenced by the
Hindu nationalist Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar, whose central thesis was that
the Hindus were a nation, despite their
profound regional, social, linguistic, and
religious differences.
On the festival of Vijaya Dashami
(Dussehra) in 1925, Hedgewar formed
the RSS to help create this Hindu nation
by unifying Hindus previously separated
by divisions of caste and class. This date
is highly significant, since according to
popular Hindu belief any endeavor
begun on Vijaya Dashami will invariably
succeed. Hedgewar led the RSS until his
death, fifteen years after the organiza-
tion was founded.
Aside from training a leadership
corps, the RSS was also formed to protect
Hindu interests. On one level, it endeav-
ored to do this by developing more
assertive, tough members, and by train-
ing them to use traditional weapons
such as the wooden staff. On quite
another level, the RSS has a long history
of charitable work with refugees and vic-
tims of natural disasters, and one of its
missions is service to the Hindu com-
munity.
In either case the RSS has often been
perceived as anti-Muslim—until 1977,
non-Hindus were barred from being
members—and many of its members
view the Muslim community as aliens in
India, if not actual enemies. Throughout
his life, Hedgewar kept the RSS strictly
aloof from politics, and his insistence
that it was a cultural and character-
building organization helped keep it
from being banned by the British. Under
its banner as a cultural organization, the
spread from the state of
Maharashtra to other parts of India,
aided in part by deteriorating Hindu-
Muslim relations in the years prior to
independence in 1947. For further

Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; Tapan

Flags, 1993; and Christophe Jaffrelot,

Hells
In Hinduism there are believed to be
many additional planes of existence
besides the visible earthly realm. These
alternate planes of existence include the
hells, which are conceived of as places of
punishment for one’s past misdeeds.
Traditional Hindu accounts describe
the hells in great detail, often linking
particular sorts of punishments to
particular sinful actions. Just as with
heavens, life in a hell is ultimately
an impermanent state, although the
time of punishment is usually described
as enormously long and incredibly
painful. Still, when the time of punish-
ment is done and one’s bad deeds
have been expiated, one will be reborn
in a higher form.
Needless to say, birth in any of
the hells is something to be avoided if
at all possible, and for this reason people
are urged to perform penances
(prayashchitta) for their sins while they
are still living, so that the consequences
of these sins may not burden them in
their next lives.
Hemp
Colloquial name for Cannibus indica,
more commonly known as marijuana.
In earlier times the plant’s long fibers
were used in the manufacture of rope
and cloth. In contemporary times it is
mainly used for its narcotic properties,
either by crushing and processing the
leaves to make bhang or by collecting
the plant’s resins as hashish (charas).
[[279]]
Hero-Stones
The use of hemp as a narcotic is illegal,
except for specific places and times,
including certain pilgrimage sites and
festivals. However, many ascetics
continue to smoke hashish regularly.
Hero-Stones
Monuments erected on the site where a
person met a heroic death. These stones
are known as viragal. See viragal.
Hetu
(“reason”) In Indian philosophy, this is
an important part of formulating an
inference (anumana). In this context,
the word has two differing meanings,
one general, the other more obscure.
The accepted form for an inference has
three terms: a hypothesis (pratijna), a rea-
son (hetu), and examples (drshtanta);
each of these three have their own con-
stituent parts. In its most general sense, the
word hetu refers to the reason or evidence
that supports the assertion in the initial
hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis
that a mountain is on fire would be sup-
ported by the reason that there is smoke on
the mountain.
In a narrower sense, hetu can also
refer to the part of a reason that proves
the hypothesis. For example, if one
proves the statement “the mountain is
on fire” with the reason “the mountain
has smoke,” the part of the reason that
indicates that there is smoke is the hetu.
Hetvabhasa
This is the term for a fallacious argument.
For a valid inference (anumana), certain
conditions must be met, or the inference
will be invalid. The accepted form for an
inference has three central terms: the first
is a hypothesis (pratijna), which contains
a subject class (paksha) and a thing to be
proved (sadhya); the second is a reason
(hetu) giving evidence for the hypothesis;
and last come examples (drshtanta),
which give further evidence for the
hypothesis. In the stock example, the
hypothesis that “there is fire on this
mountain” is making a certain claim
[[280]]

(sadhya)—namely, that there is fire—
about a certain class of things (paksha)—
namely, this mountain. The inference’s
second part gives the reason (hetu)
“because there is smoke on this moun-
tain,” which also makes a claim about the
subject class—namely, this mountain.
One condition necessary for a valid
inference is for the subject class to
fall within the reason given, so that in
all cases the reason would apply to it.
The statement “there is fire on this
mountain because there is smoke on
that mountain” is an example where
the subject class and the reason given
are clearly separate.
Yet the most important condition for a
valid inference is that the reason given
must account for every case of the thing
to be proved, such that it cannot be
explained in any other way. This is known
as pervasion (vyapti) and is a critical test
for the hetu. For the Indian logicians,
claiming that smoke implied the presence
of fire was a valid inference, since smoke
was always produced by fire.
On the other hand, the claim that fire
implied the presence of smoke was
invalid. This was because the logicians
could name a case in which fire was not
invariably accompanied by smoke, and
thus failing this requirement of “perva-
sion”—the case of the red-hot iron ball,
which was considered fiery, but not
smoky. This counterexample is known as
an upadhi (“obstruction”). It gives an
example when one thing does not
inevitably bring another, and thus shows
that the hetu fails to pervade the sadhya,
since there is a class of fiery things that do
not smoke. For further information see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Hijra
Name for a class of male transvestites,
most of whom have undergone self-
castration as a ritual renunciation of
their sexuality. Hijras often serve as
homosexual prostitutes, and they are an
established feature of the decadent
underside in most Indian cities. TheirHimalayas
Panorama of the Himalayas in Nepal. Hindus consider the Himalaya mountains
sacred since they are believed to be home to the gods.
most important social function is to
sing and dance at houses in which a
male child has been born, although they
may also be called to perform on other
auspicious occasions.
Their ritual role in connection with
births shows a strong association with
fertility, and at any function their pres-
ence is believed to confer health and
prosperity on the sponsoring family, for
which the hijras will demand appropri-
ate compensation. At the same time, the
life of the hijras seems fraught with con-
trary notions: Although they are ritually
associated with fertility, they are them-
selves sterile, and their sexuality is non-
procreative. Though they are associated
with auspiciousness and prosperity,
they are a socially marginal group with
very low social status. For the only reli-
able study to date, see Serena Nanda,
Neither Man Nor Woman, 1999.
Himachal Pradesh
(“Himalayan State”) Modern Indian state
located in the Himalayan region between
the state Jammu and Kashmir and the
kingdom of Nepal. Himachal Pradesh was
created in 1966 when the former state of
Punjab was divided into Punjab,
Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. As its
name implies, Himachal Pradesh is a
mountain state, with its lower regions in
the Shiwalik Hills and its upper regions in
the high Himalayas. Most of the state’s
people live in the long, fertile river valleys
between the mountain ranges, and in the
hot season its hill stations provide wel-
come relief from the scorching heat.
Himachal is the home for seven of
the nine Shiwalik goddesses. These
seven goddesses are all the presiding
deities of a particular site, and some of
them have become quite important in
northern Indian religious life. Himachal
Pradesh is also home to a spectacular
Dussehra festival in the town of Kulu,
at which all the gods in the Kulu Valley
are brought to Kulu to honor the god
Rama on his victory over the demon-
king Ravana. For general information,
an accessible reference is Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Himalaya
A minor deity who is the personified
form of the Himalaya Mountains.
Although the Himalaya Mountains are
one of the defining features of the Indian
subcontinent, the deity Himalaya has a
very insignificant place in Indian
mythology. His most important role is as
the father of the goddess Parvati, who
when she reaches maturity is married to
the great god Shiva. Himalaya is
described as exceedingly wealthy,
because of the mineral riches that the
mountains contain. See also Himalayas.
Himalayas
(“abode of the snow”) Mountain range
that arcs across the northern border of
India, although the only Indian states with
significant Himalayan regions are Jammu
and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh, and, further east, Sikkhim.
[[281]]
Hindi
In a Hindu religious context, the
Himalayan regions in the first three
states are the most significant; the
mountains in these three contiguous
states are all part of an extended
Himalayan cultural region, fronted by
the Shiwalik Hills. They are consid-
ered sacred, both as the literal abode
of the Hindu gods (in particular Shiva,
who is believed to live on Mount
Kailas) and also as the source of
sacred rivers such as the Ganges,
Yamuna, and Indus. These high
mountains are also a traditional home
for Hindu ascetics wishing to
renounce the everyday world and
search for personal spiritual realiza-
tion; the physical hardships these
ascetics must endure in the moun-
tains are also believed to generate
spiritual power.
Given their religious importance,
the Himalayas are full of sacred
sites (tirthas); among the most impor-
tant are Amarnath, Yamunotri,
Gangotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath, and
Nanda Devi.
Hindi
Modern Indian language classified as a
member of the Indo-European lan-
guage family; Hindi is the “official”
language of the Republic of India.
Hindi is spoken throughout most of
northern and central India as a second
or “link” language and as a “mother”
tongue in much of the states of Uttar
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is
also one of the broadcast languages
for the television and radio networks
run by the Indian government and by
virtue of these mediums can be found
throughout the nation.
As with many of India’s regional
languages, Hindi has a long history as
a literary language, particularly in an
earlier version known as Braj Bhasha,
which was the dominant language in
which northern Indian devotional
(bhakti) poetry was written. The slow
demise of Sanskrit in contemporary
times has helped make Hindi an
[[282]]

important language for fiction,
learned scholarship, and writing on
Indian culture.
In modern India, speaking a certain
language often carries political impli-
cations, since an important factor in
preserving regional identities has been
the stress on maintaining one’s region-
al language. For this reason, many peo-
ple are not about to let Hindi replace
their regional languages. This senti-
ment is particularly marked in south-
ern India, where the imposition of the
Hindi language is decried as a new
form of imperialism.
Hindu Mahasabha
Hindu religious and political organiza-
tion, formed at the 1915 Kumbha Mela,
a gigantic religious festival. The Hindu
Mahasabha was originally formed to
help foster Hindu causes, such as a
call for a complete ban on cow
slaughter, promoting the use of the
Hindi language in the DevaNagari
script, and addressing the problem of
caste discrimination.
In the early 1920s, the movement
became more overtly political and
by the early 1930s espoused an
unabashed Hindu nationalism, exem-
plified by its leader, Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar. The dark underside of this
Hindu nationalist crusade was a pro-
nounced animus toward Muslims,
which was only strengthened by the
deteriorating relations between the
two communities in the years preced-
ing World War II.
Although the Hindu Mahasabha was
eager for official recognition by the rul-
ing British government and sought to be
recognized as the sole legitimate speak-
er for the Hindu community, these
hopes were never realized. The British
government included them in talks only
after negotiations with the Indian
National Congress Party had broken
down, and cut relations with the
Mahasabha after fences had been
mended with the Congress.
After independence in 1947, theHinglaj
party’s image was damaged by its asso-
ciation with Mohandas Gandhi’s assas-
sin, Nathuram Godse. It continued
to field political candidates until the
early 1960s, but never gained significant
political power. For further information
see Kenneth W. Jones, “Politicized
Hinduism: The Ideology and Program
of the Hindu Mahasabha,” in
Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in
Modern India, 1998.
Hindutva
(“Hindu-ness”) An idea first propounded
by the political activist Vinayak
Damodar Savarkar. It first appeared in a
pamphlet titled Hindutva/Who is a
Hindu? and is the fundamental basis of
modern Hindu nationalism.
Savarkar’s thesis was that the
Hindus were a nation, despite their
sharp regional, cultural, linguistic,
and religious differences; further-
more, he defined a Hindu as anyone
who considered India both fatherland
and holy land. This loose definition
was broad enough to encompass all
of the variety found in Indian Hindu
culture. But it was also clearly reach-
ing for the lowest common denomi-
nator. For most Indians, identity is
invariably based on concrete region-
al, linguistic, or sectarian grounds,
rather than an abstract notions of
being “Hindu.”
Yet it is important to note who this
loose definition excludes—Muslims
and Christians, India’s most visible
minorities, who are marginalized by
virtue of their “alien” holy lands. By
this definition, Hindus “belong” in
India simply by virtue of who they are,
whereas Muslims and Christians, no
matter how long their families may
have lived in India, are always consid-
ered to be outsiders.
Hindutva ideology is a fundamental
assumption of the Rashtriya Svayamsevak
Sangh (RSS), a contemporary conserv-
ative Hindu organization, and the
organizations that are affiliated with
the RSS, particularly the Vishva Hindu
Parishad, and to a lesser extent the
Bharatiya Janata Party. Hindutva ideals
are also a prominent feature of parties
such as the Shiv Sena, which combine
Hindu and regional identity. For further
information see Christophe Jaffrelot,
The Hindu Nationalist Movement in
India, 1996.
Hinglaj
Sacred site (tirtha) located on the
coast of the Arabian Sea in the
Baluchistan Province of modern
Pakistan. Hinglaj is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites located
throughout the subcontinent that are
sacred to the goddess Sati. Each Shakti
Pitha marks the site where a body part
of the dismembered goddess fell to
earth, and then took form as a differ-
ent goddess; in the case of Hinglaj, the
body part was the crown of Sati’s head.
Hinglaj is the furthest west of all the
Shakti Pithas, and thus represents the
furthest boundaries of the traditional
Hindu cultural area.
The presiding goddess at Hinglaj
is known by various names, the most
common being Hinglaj Devi. She is
considered an extremely powerful
goddess—partly because of her
dangerous location on the periphery of
India, but also because the crown of the
head (brahmarandhra) is considered
the highest and most powerful part of
the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate phys-
iological system believed to reside on a
different plane of existence than the
actual body, but with certain correspon-
dences to the actual body. It is visualized
as a set of six psychic centers (chakras)
running roughly along the course of the
spine. Above and below these centers
are found the two divine principles,
Shiva (awareness) and Shakti (power)—
the latter at the base of the spine, and
former in the crown of the head.
Because of Hinglaj’s association with
mastery of the subtle body, a visit to her
shrine was considered essential for any-
one striving for perfection in yoga. By
[[283]]
Hiranyagarbha
the 1800s the area around her shrine
had become completely dominated by
Muslims and thus well outside the
Hindu culture area. To travel outside of
this area is to risk loss of one’s Hindu
identity. To counter the danger of travel-
ing outside this area, it became tradi-
tional for ascetics who had gone there
on pilgrimage to be branded with her
symbol on their return to India, as a way
to purify them and remake them as
Hindus. The political tensions between
India and Pakistan since their indepen-
dence in 1947 have made it almost
impossible for Hindu pilgrims to visit
the shrine. For further information see
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and
the Kanphata Yogis, 1973. See also pitha.
Hiranyagarbha
One of the earliest Hindu cosmological
myths. See Golden Embryo.
Hiranyakashipu
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu
is a demon king who is killed by the
god Vishnu, in his avatar or incarna-
tion as a Man-Lion. As a result of his
harsh physical asceticism, Hiranyakashipu
gains a series of divine powers, which
render him virtually invulnerable:
notable of these powers is that he
cannot be killed by man or beast, by
day or by night, and neither inside
nor outdoors.
Protected
by
these
powers,
Hiranyakashipu first conquers the
entire earth and then drives the gods
from heaven, growing prouder and
more oppressive as his power increas-
es. He particularly oppresses his son
Prahlada, who despite his father’s
power remains a sincere devotee
(bhakta) of Vishnu. Incensed at the
thought that someone refuses to wor-
ship him, Hiranyakashipu finally gives
Prahlada the ultimatum to worship
him or die.
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,
and Vishnu appears in the form of a
Man-Lion—a man from the torso down,
[[284]]

with the head and shoulders of a lion—
which is neither man nor beast. The
Man-Lion seizes Hiranyakashipu in the
palace doorway, which is neither
inside nor out, at twilight, which is nei-
ther day nor night, and uses his sharp
claws to tear out the demon’s entrails,
killing him. The story of Hiranyakashipu
is meant to illustrate the danger of
pride, and the mythic reality that no
power, however powerful, can keep
one from the consequences of one’s
evil deeds.
Hiranyakeshin
(4th c. B.C.E.?) Sage, writer, and commen-
tator, also considered a disciple of the
writer Apastamba. Apastamba is the
author of a type of text known as a Kalpa
Sutra. He is only one of three authors,
along
with
Baudhayana
and
Hiranyakeshin, whose surviving works
contain all three elements prescribed for
a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for Vedic rit-
uals (Shrauta Sutras), for domestic rites
(Grhya Sutras), and for appropriate
human behavior (Dharma Sutras).
All three of these men belonged to
the same school, the Taittiriya school of
the Black Yajur Veda. According to tradi-
tion, Baudhayana was the oldest,
Apastamba
his
disciple,
and
Hiranyakeshin Apastamba’s disciple.
This chronology is supported by the
texts themselves, since Baudhayana’s
text is much less organized than the oth-
ers, and more archaic in its language.
Hiranyaksha
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyaksha is a
demon king who is killed by the god
Vishnu, in the latter’s avatar or incarna-
tion as a Boar. Hiranyaksha has per-
formed harsh physical ascetic practice
(tapas) and as result, gained various
divine powers. He eventually grows so
powerful and proud that he spirits away
the earth herself, hiding her at the bot-
tom of the cosmic ocean. It is at such
times of cosmic crisis that Vishnu takes
form on earth, to restore the equilibriumHoli
of the cosmos through his actions.
Vishnu takes the form of a giant boar
and dives to the bottom of the ocean,
where he slays Hiranyaksha, places the
earth on the tip of his tusk, and lifts her
from the waters. With the reappearance
of the earth, the process of creation
resumed. See also Boar avatar.
Hitopadesha
(“beneficial teaching”) A well-known
moralistic story that is drawn from
Panchatantra , a set of moralistic fables
aimed at conveying practical and worldly
wisdom. The Hitopadesha was compiled
in the twelfth century as an introductory
reader to Sanskrit.
The frame story for the both of these
texts describes a king who is distressed
by his sons’ lack of learning and good
moral character; these doubts lead to
grave misgivings about their abilities to
be good and fair rulers after his death.
He resolves this problem by hiring a
teacher who teaches the boys using
fables, often with several shorter fables
embedded in a longer tale. The
Hitopadesha was intended to give prag-
matic advice about how to be successful
in the real world and maintains that
caution and self-interest are the keys to
success in life.
Holi
Major religious festival celebrated on the
full moon in the lunar month of
Phalgun (February–March), which in
northern India comes very close to the
end of the lunar year. Holi is essentially a
festival of reversal and is celebrated with
great enthusiasm throughout much of
India. As the lunar year’s final major fes-
tival, the celebrations for Holi mirror the
pattern of cosmic dissolution found in
other units of time, whether the solar
day or the basic unit of cosmic time, the
mahayuga. In this pattern, the order in
the cosmos steadily deteriorates until all
order finally disappears, but after a cer-
tain time is suddenly, completely, and
perfectly reformed.
The festival of Holi is celebrated in
two parts: a bonfire on the evening
before Holi, and the “festival of colors”
on the morning of Holi itself. Material for
the bonfire is collected in the weeks
before Holi and although the things put
on this bonfire pile are supposed to be
old and worn-out (with the symbolism of
getting rid of the old), much newer
things are often put on it as well, and this
is a time in which people guard their
possessions carefully.
The days before Holi see the break-
down of various social taboos. In his The
Divine Hierarchy, author Lawrence Babb
reports the use of obscenity and bawdy
discourse during this time, including
stamping the word “penis” all over town
using stamps carved from potatoes. As
Holi gets closer, pranks such as pelting
passersby with water balloons become
more and more common. Such behavior
is ultimately harmless, but is still com-
pletely unacceptable in ordinary times
and symbolizes the coming cosmic dis-
solution. On the night of Holi, the bon-
fire is lit, symbolizing the destruction of
the old, and people may direct obsceni-
ties toward the fire as a vehicle for get-
ting rid of enmities from the previous
year. Mythologically, the bonfire comes
from the burning of the demon Holika,
who tries to trick her brother Prahlada
into being burned on a bonfire, but is
herself consumed by the flames.
The morning after the bonfire is the
high point of Holi, the “festival of colors.”
For weeks before Holi, the shops in the
markets display mounds of powders in
various colors, most commonly in vivid
greens, reds, and purple; the colors are
used as powder, or are mixed with water.
People play with the colored water using
syringes or balloons. In the gentlest type
of play, each person takes a small pinch
of colored powder and gently applies it
to the other person’s forehead. Needless
to say, the play with colors can often
become much rougher, with people
smearing and soaking each other with
colors, dyeing each other’s clothing in
multiple hues, and often staining the
skin for weeks afterward.
[[285]]
Holi
The evening before the festival of Holi, men in Delhi arrange
colored powders to prepare the site for a bonfire.
[[286]]
Holkar, Ahalya Bai
This and all other Holi-related antics
are always described as “play” (khel),
and the operating assumption is that
one cannot become angry with the peo-
ple with whom one is playing, no matter
how outrageous the behavior or how
pointed the insults. The festival of Holi is
the one day in the year when the bound-
aries of the usual social hierarchy are
completely disregarded, along with the
taboos on physical touching that are pri-
marily based on the inherent concern for
ritual purity. Another characteristic of
Holi is that it is one of the few occasions
when socially respectable people con-
sume bhang, an intoxicating prepara-
tion made from ground-up marijuana.
The morning passes in a welter of
noise, confusion, and color, with (at
street level) absolutely no rules, symbol-
izing the chaos of cosmic dissolution. Yet
in the afternoon, cosmic (and social)
order are suddenly restored. People take
baths, change into new clothes, and go
out visiting without fear of being col-
ored, and any person bold enough to
pelt someone with dyes at this time is
subject to severe disapproval.
In recent times, particularly in the
larger cities, the license associated with
Holi has been taken as an opportunity
for all sorts of antisocial behavior: public
drunkenness, molesting women, destroy-
ing property, and the chance to settle old
grudges by physically harming people.
The chaos is so intense that in larger
cities many people stay in their houses
on Holi, “playing” with members of their
immediate family in the gentler spirit
that is characterized as “true” Holi.
Given the threat to public order, the
government has taken some action, but
the very nature of the holiday makes it
difficult to regulate—since it is a festival
of reversal, the government is one more
force to be disregarded on that morning.
Various government agencies have also
tried to discourage the practice of mak-
ing bonfires, although here the concern
stems from worries about deforestation
rather than the breakdown of social
order. For further information see
McKim Marriot, “The Feast of Love,” in
Milton Singer (ed.), Krishna: Myths, Rites,
and Attitudes, 1966; and Lawrence Babb,
The Divine Hierarchy, 1975.
Holika
In Hindu mythology, the wicked sister of
the demon-king Hiranyakashipu.
Holika helps Hiranyakashipu try to
kill his son Prahlada, who is a
steadfast devotee (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. Because of a divine power, she
cannot be harmed by fire. She tricks
Prahlada into sitting on her lap in a
bonfire, expecting that she will be
unharmed and he will die. Fortunately
Vishnu transfers her power from
Holika to Prahlada, and she is
consumed by the fire, while he remains
completely unscathed.
The myth of the burning of Holika is
the model for the bonfires for the festi-
val of Holi. On a mythic level, the bon-
fire symbolizes the triumph of good over
evil; on another level, since the materi-
als in the fire are supposed to be old and
broken things, the bonfire symbolizes
getting rid of one’s baggage from the
previous year, and starting anew.
Holkar, Ahalya Bai
(r. 1761–1795) Hindu queen in the
Holkar dynasty. The family ruled one
of the successor states resulting from
the breakup of the Maratha empire,
whose capital was in the central Indian
city of Indore.
She came to power at a time when
the influence of the Moghul dynasty
had been greatly reduced and moved to
fill the political vacuum that this created.
During her long reign she managed to
wield genuine political power over
much of north-central India. She also
served as a highly visible royal patron at
several Hindu pilgrimage sites, includ-
ing Benares, where she funded the
reconstruction of the Vishvanath tem-
ple, and Haridwar, where she is said to
have paid for the construction of a ghat,
which is a structure that leads to a
sacred bathing (snana) area. For further
[[287]]
Homa
information see Govind S. Sardesai, A
New History of the Marathas, 1986.
Homa
In its most specific meaning, homa
refers to the “sacrifice to the gods”
(devayajna), which is one of the Five
Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the dharma literature, or
texts on religious duty. Homa refers to
the act of making offerings of clarified
butter into a sacrificial fire, a rite that is
directed toward satisfying the gods.
Today, the word homa is often used with
a far more general meaning, to refer to
any religious rite in which offerings are
placed in the sacred fire.
Homosexuality
Although
homosexuality
is
not
unknown in Indian culture, it has never
had a very prominent presence. The
Kama Sutra contains a brief account of
homosexual oral sex and the classes of
men who performed this, but it is little
more than a passing mention.
In modern times, the male transves-
tites known as hijras often serve
as homosexual prostitutes, and they
are an accepted if marginal presence
in Indian life.
Although according to the dominant
Hindu ethos the search for pleasure—of
any kind—is an aim of life (purushartha),
other factors have channeled the
expression of sexual desire in other
directions, especially toward traditional
marriage. One of these is the general
desire for progeny, particularly sons;
another is the notion of the family as the
basic unit for social life. In addition, the
traditional male concern with losing
vitality through seminal emission is a
reason to abstain from sexual relations.
Finally, the cultural assumption that
ultimate wisdom comes only when one
has renounced all desires would have
affected sexual desire of all kinds.
[[288]]

Hookswinging
One of the more extreme vows per-
formed by devotees (bhakta) of the god
Skanda during the annual pilgrimage at
Kataragama, in the southern part of the
island of Sri Lanka. This vow is per-
formed in return for finding healing
from physical ailments or deliverance
from distress. Those keeping this vow
inserted hooks into their back and thigh
muscles; ropes are attached to these
hooks, and the devotees are suspended
over the heads of passersby.
These ardent devotees are reportedly
rewarded for their suffering with a state
of ecstasy in which they feel no pain and
suffer no bleeding. In this state, they are
also believed to be mouthpieces for the
god Skanda, and other pilgrims seek

Hotr
Type of priest mentioned in the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire. These rites were so complex
that they required specialized ritual
technicians: the hotr, the adhvaryum,
the udgatr, and brahman. Of these, the
hotr was the sacrificial priest who recited
the verses from the Rg Veda that were
used in the sacrifice.Hoysaleshvar Temple
House of Clay
Realm of punishment described in a
verse in the Rg Veda (7.89), the earliest
Hindu religious text. As described in this
verse, the House of Clay is a place to
which evildoers—particularly those
guilty of speaking falsely—will be sent
by the god Varuna, who is considered
the guardian of righteousness and cos-
mic order (rta).
As its name indicates, the House of
Clay is a gloomy and joyless place. What
is notable in the original verse is the lack
of any notion of reincarnation (sam-
sara), which later became a central
Indian assumption. At the time it was
seen as an undesirable and permanent
state after death.
House of Lac
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, this is one of the
stratagems through which the epic’s
antagonist, Duryodhana, tries to kill the
five Pandava brothers, who are his
cousins and the epic’s protagonists.
Duryodhana builds the Pandavas a
magnificent palace, without telling
them that it is constructed completely of
lac, a highly flammable substance. After
the Pandavas have settled into the
palace, Duryodhana has his minions set
it on fire in an effort to burn them alive.
The Pandavas are saved by the sagacity
of their uncle Vidura, who not only
warns them of the danger, but has con-
structed an underground passage allow-
ing them to escape from the house and a
tunnel to convey them far away without
being discovered. When the house is set
afire, the Pandavas escape through the
tunnel and for some time are safe from
Duryodhana, since they are presumed
to have died in the fire.
Hoysala Dynasty
(11th–14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
that ranged over the southern part of
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
The capital city was Dorasamudra,
which is now called Halebid.
Sightseers at the Hoysaleshvar Temple in Halebid.
The temple is known for the detailed and
elaborate stone carvings that ornament its facade.
The Hoysalas were originally hill
chiefs who were vassals to the
Chalukyas (a central Indian dynasty
that ruled from the seventh to eighth
century C.E.), but who became indepen-
dent in 1093. At their peak they ruled
much of the states of Karnataka and
northern Tamil Nadu, but by the begin-
ning of the fourteenth century had seen
their power decline. By the middle of the
century, their kingdom had been
annexed by the Sangamas, whose capi-
tal was at Vijayanagar.
The Hoysalas are most famous for
the magnificent temples they constructed
at the cities of Belur and Halebid, which
are treasure-houses of medieval south-
ern Indian sculpture.
Hoysaleshvar Temple
Largest and most magnificent of the
Hoysala temples at Halebid, the
dynasty’s capital city; the temple itself
was
built
in
[[1141]]
–1182.
The
Hoysaleshvar Temple is dedicated to
the god Shiva, in his form as “Lord of
the Hoysalas.”
Hoysala temples were built from a
particular type of stone—variously
described as chlorite schist, steatite, or
soapstone—that is quite soft when
newly quarried, but gradually hardens
with exposure to air. This initial
[[289]]
Hrshikesha
malleability makes the stone easy to
carve and facilitated the lush detail
characteristic of Hoysala temples. The
Hoysaleshvar Temple is known for the
quantity of lush detail, which surpass-
es other Hoysala temples. See also
Hoysala dynasty.
Hrshikesha
(“Lord of the Senses”) Epithet of the god
Vishnu, particularly in his avatar or
incarnation as the god Krishna. See
Vishnu and Krishna.
Hsuan Tsang
(605–664) Chinese Buddhist scholar and
translator, whose account of his extend-
ed stay in India (629–645) provides one
of the few reliable sources for Indian life
in that period.
Hsuan Tsang’s purpose in coming
to India was to find reliable copies of
the Buddhist scriptures, which had
become severely garbled and corrupt-
ed during their transmission to China.
He was a highly learned man and dur-
ing his stay spent years studying in
Buddhist educational institutions,
particularly the Buddhist university at
Nalanda. He traveled all over northern
India and because of his piety and
learning was honored by the kings he
met, including the Emperor Harsha.
For further information see his Si-yu-
ki: Buddhist Records of the Western
World, Samuel Beal (trans.), 1969.
Huhu
In Hindu mythology, Huhu is a partic-
ular gandharva, or celestial musician.
He has the misfortune to displease a
Hindu sage, when his amorous water
play with some celestial damsels
breaks the sage’s meditation. The sage
curses Huhu to become a giant croco-
dile, and he remains in this state for
many years. The crocodile preys on the
creatures in the lake, and one day
seizes the leg of a giant elephant. This
elephant is really King Indradyumna,
who has also assumed this form as the
[[290]]

result of a curse. The elephant and the
crocodile struggle for one thousand
years, so evenly matched that neither
can best the other. Huhu is finally
released from his curse when the god
Vishnu himself comes down from
heaven and kills him. See also
Gajendramoksha.
Human Sacrifice
The practice of human sacrifice was
uncommon in the history of Hindu
religious life, but not unknown. One of
the common mythic motifs in the wor-
ship of certain fierce and powerful
deities is for devotees (bhakta) to offer
their own heads to the Goddess as the
ultimate sacrifice and act of devotion,
but experts are uncertain how fre-
quently this rite was performed. One
mythic example of this is the demon-
king Ravana, who cuts off nine of his
ten heads before the god Shiva grants
him divine power. The resolve to com-
mit this action is also attributed to the
Bengali saint Ramakrishna, although
the goddess Kali intervened before he
could carry it out.
The one place where human sacri-
fice was undoubtedly a regular prac-
tice was at the temple of the goddess
Kamakhya in Assam. This temple is
one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess that
spreads throughout the subcontinent.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where
a body part of the dismembered god-
dess Sati fell to earth, taking form
there as a different goddess. In this
case, the body part was Sati’s vulva,
and the presence of such a highly
charged part of the female body made
Kamakhya a very powerful goddess.
When the new temple was dedicat-
ed in 1565, she was reportedly offered
the heads of 140 men, and this prac-
tice continued until the British halted
it in 1832. The men offered as human
sacrifices were reportedly volunteers,
who believed that they had been
called by her to do this; in the time
between announcing their intentionHypogamous Marriage
to be sacrificed and their deaths they
were treated as virtual divinities, since
they were considered to have been
consecrated to the goddess. For fur-
ther information see E. A. Gait, A
History of Assam, 1963. See also pitha.
Humors, Bodily

Hundi
In earlier times, the name for a letter
of credit issued from a mercantile
house. By the early 1800s, these letters
functioned as a virtual currency, since
in some cases they would pass
through twenty or thirty transactions
before being returned for payment.
Hundis are significant because they
allowed families to transact business
over large areas without having to
actually carry large sums of money
with them and thus helped to foster
long distance trade.
In modern times, this is also the
most common term for a temple
collection box, where visitors deposit
their offerings.
Hygiene
Orthoprax Hindus (that is, Hindus who
stress correct religious practice) lay
great stress on cleanliness of their bod-
ies and their immediate environment.
Although to the outside eye this scrupu-
lous attention would seem to indicate a
concern for hygiene, these actions are
performed primarily to protect and
retain religious purity.
In many cases, concerns for hygiene
and purity overlap, as in the pervasive
practice of bathing (snana) and the
regulations concerning bodily cleanli-
ness. Both of these simultaneously
remove dirt and impurity (ashaucha),
but in other cases these concerns
clearly diverge.
One example of this divergence is
the way that household refuse is often
simply put out in the street—a prac-
tice that keeps the home pure and
clean, but which fosters unhygienic
conditions directly outside the home.
Another example of this disjunction
can be seen in the traditional use of
cow dung as a purifying substance, or
the way that the Ganges River is
always considered pure, even in its
lower reaches where it is full of sewage
and industrial effluents. These exam-
ples clearly show that purity and
hygiene are very different concepts
and that, from a religious perspective,
purity is by far the more important of
the two.
Hypergamous Marriage
A marriage in which the wife comes
from a group with lower social status
than the husband. Although the ideal
Hindu marriage is between a man and
woman of equal social status, hyperga-
mous marriage was admitted as a possi-
bility in the dharma literature, although
it was not encouraged. In most cases, it
was specified that a man’s first wife
should be of equal social status, but that
he was then permitted to marry women
of lower status.
In modern India, where the predom-
inant form of marriage is still arranged
marriage, most marriages are still
between men and women of equal sta-
tus. However, a hypergamous marriage
is likely to generate less opposition than
a hypogamous marriage, where a
woman marries a man from a lower sta-
tus group. In the dharma literature,
hypergamous marriage was known as
anuloma, “with the hair” (i.e., in the nat-
ural direction).
Hypogamous Marriage
A marriage in which the wife comes
from a group with higher social status
than the husband. Such marriages were
strictly forbidden in the dharma litera-
ture, and this prohibition illustrates the
role of women in determining a group’s
social status.
[[291]]
Hypogamous Marriage
It is deemed acceptable for women
to marry people of higher social status
(hypergamous marriage), because it is
believed that they are improving the sta-
tus of their group by becoming associat-
ed with a higher status group. Marriage
to a man of lower status was strictly for-
bidden, since the exchange of women
implies some sort of equality between
the two groups, and thus drags the com-
munity’s status down. In the dharma lit-
erature, hypogamous marriage was
known as pratiloma, “against the hair”
(i.e., in an unnatural direction). For fur-
ther information see Jadunath Sarkar, A
History of the Dasanami Naga Sanyasis,

Impalement
## I
Iconic Image
A pictorial or representational likeness
of a deity, such as a statue or picture.
This is in contrast with an aniconic
image, in which there is no such repre-
sentational image, and the connection
between image and deity is symbolic.
Ida Nadi
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conceptions of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to reside
on a different plane of existence than
the actual body, but with certain corre-
spondences to it. It is visualized as a set
of six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are found Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini.
The ida nadi is the vertical channel
on the left side of the body. As with
the rest of the subtle body, the ida nadi
has certain symbolic correspondences;
in particular, it is identified with the
moon and is thus visualized as being
light in color.
Ikshvaku
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Ikshvaku was a
king who was the founder of the Solar
Line. The Solar Line is one of the two
great Indian mythic lineages in ancient
India, along with the Lunar Line; the
most illustrious members of the Solar
Line were the god-king Rama and his
brothers. Ikshvaku is the grandson of
Vivasvan (Surya), the sun, and thus he
and his offspring are descendants of
the sun.
Ilangovadigal
Poet traditionally named as the author
of the Tamil epic poem Shilappadigaram
(“The Jeweled Anklet”). The poem high-
lights several themes important to
Hindu culture, particularly the need for
kings to be righteous in their judgments,
and the power gained by a wife through
devotion to her husband.
The main characters in the poem are
a young couple, Kannaki and Kovalan.
When Kovalan is executed because of a
tragic misunderstanding, his wife
Kannaki pronounces a curse on the city
of Madurai, which causes many of
the citizens to die before Kannaki
retracts it at the behest of Madurai’s
patron goddess.
Ilangovadigal is believed to have
lived in the first or second century C.E., a
date that makes his authorship improb-
able, since the poem was probably writ-
ten several centuries later.
Impalement
One of the favored means of execution
that seems to have been particularly
prevalent in ancient southern India. To
impale someone is to kill them by pierc-
ing them with a sharp stake.
The most stunning instance is
reported to have taken place in the city
of Madurai, where 8,000 Jain ascetics
were impaled by one of the kings in the
Pandya dynasty, after the latter had
renounced Jainism to become a Shaiva,
that is, a devotee (bhakta) of Shiva. A
tradition persists that the ultimate
responsibility for this can be traced to
the Nayanar saint Sambandar, who had
converted the king and whose surviving
poetry shows a deep animus for the
Jains. If this report is true, it also indi-
cates one of the rare cases of religious
persecution in Hindu India, which on
the whole has been remarkably tolerant
of differing ways of religious life.
[[293]]
Impurity
Depictions of this mass impalement can
be seen in murals painted at the
Minakshi temple in Madurai—whose
construction far postdates the alleged
event—as well as in popular art of differ-
ent kinds.
Impurity
See ashaucha.
Inauspiciousness
This concept refers to events or condi-
tions that in their very essence hinder or
are inimical to life, prosperity, and gen-
eral well-being. Along with purity and
impurity (ashaucha), auspiciousness
and inauspiciousness are fundamental
categories in Hindu life.
Inauspicious conditions can be
caused by a variety of factors. At times
the inauspiciousness lies in the very
moment itself—in an hour or day con-
sidered to be unlucky, in unusual
events such as eclipses, or in astrologi-
cal conjunctions that are considered
inherently unlucky. In such “danger-
ous” times, one’s activities should be
severely curtailed, except for things that
are absolutely necessary. Certain nor-
mally innocuous activities can become
inauspicious in conjunction with partic-
ular times, and at these times such activ-
ities should be avoided.
Inauspiciousness can also arise from
certain conjunctions in one’s natal
horoscope, or from erecting a home or
building in an inappropriate place. As a
quality, inauspiciousness is conceived of
as a physical entity that is generated
by certain conditions, and which then
attaches to individuals, families, or
larger communities.
Some of these inauspicious condi-
tions can be avoided by refraining
from certain activities at certain times,
yet there are certain conditions that
cannot be avoided—in particular, the
inauspiciousness arising from eclipses
or other astrological conjunctions.
Whereas impurity (ashaucha) can
be removed or destroyed through
[[294]]

purification, inauspiciousness can only
be transferred from one person to
another, most often through the medi-
um of gifts (dana). For more informa-
tion see Gloria Goodwin Raheja, The
Poison in the Gift, 1988; and David F.
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan
(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Independence Day
Indian national holiday celebrated on
August 15—one of the few holidays cele-
brated according to the solar calendar—
which marks the date in 1947 on
which India gained independence from
Great Britain.
Indigenous Aryan Theory
The theory that the Aryans were indige-
nous to the Indian subcontinent, rather
than immigrants from other lands. The
word Arya (“noble”) is the name used for
themselves by the people who com-
posed the Vedas, the earliest Hindu reli-
gious texts.
Nineteenth-century European schol-
arship discovered structural relation-
ships between Sanskrit and classical
European languages and speculated
that all these languages came from a
common parent. Based on further
analysis, these researchers hypothesized
that people speaking this parent lan-
guage originated in central Asia, some-
where near the Caspian Sea. From there,
some went west to Europe, some went
southwest to Turkey, and some went
south toward Iran, and later to India.
The conclusion that these Indian pil-
grims came from Iran is based on com-
parisons between the Avesta and the
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious
texts. These texts show broad linguistic
similarities, and thus indicate that the
people speaking the languages were
closely related. This entire theory is thus
based solely on the observed similarities
between languages, and assumptions
about how it changed.
Indigenous Aryan theory supporters
reject this claim and maintain that theIndra
Aryans are the original inhabitants of
India, and as proof point to the artifacts
found in the Indus Valley civilization,
an ancient urban network in northeast-
ern India. Both of these claims are highly
tenuous and do not address the philo-
logical evidence behind the original
Aryan theory. The Indigenous Aryan
theory has political implications that
have helped to spur its growth. Some
supporters are reacting against the
Aryan migration theory’s perceived
colonialist bias, since the theory was
developed by Europeans and assumes
that the dominant groups in modern
India must have come from outside.
Other supporters of this theory are the
proponents of Hindutva, who claim
that all Indians are “really” Hindus, and
thus one social group, whatever their
particular religious beliefs. This asser-
tion has profound political implica-
tions in modern India, where Christians
and Muslims are not only religious com-
munities, but social and political ones.
By connecting Hindu identity and good
Indian citizenship, Hindutva propo-
nents are marginalizing Christians and
Muslims as outsiders.
Indira Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). As with all the
eleventh-day observances, this is dedi-
cated to the worship of Vishnu, on this
day in his form as the Shalagram. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise specific
benefits. This ekadashi falls during the
pitrpaksha, the fortnight dedicated to
the ancestors, and faithfully observing
this festival day is believed to result in
the rescue of millions of one’s forebears
from woeful incarnations and bring
them rebirth in heaven. The name
“Indira” is an epithet of Lakshmi,
Vishnu’s wife.
Depiction of the god Indra, king of heaven and
one of the eight guardians of the earth.
Indra
One of the oldest and most powerful
Hindu deities. His status has changed
over the years and this evolution shows
how Hinduism has transformed.
In the earliest Hindu scriptures, the
hymns in Rg Veda, Indra is the Vedic deity
par excellence. As with most Vedic deities,
Indra is associated with certain natural
phenomena, in this case the power of the
storm; he was seen as inhabiting the
region (antariksha) between the earth
and sky, the region where storms take
place. In many ways Indra seems a para-
digm for the virtues and powers cele-
brated in the Vedas, and (as many have
inferred) celebrated as virtues by the
Aryans themselves. Indra is the invincible
warrior and the performer of great deeds.
One of the central hymns in the Rg
Veda (1.32) describes Indra’s battle with
the serpent Vrtra, who is finally killed
and cut into pieces, allowing the pent-up
waters that Vrtra has blocked to flow
freely over the land.
Indra is a drinker of the intoxicating
beverage soma, whose influence leads
him to expanded reveries on his own
greatness; he is the ultimate man’s man
in a culture that is usually believed to
have stressed manly virtues. Of the 1,028
hymns in the Rg Veda, nearly a quarter
are devoted to Indra, who is described as
the power encircling the earth.
[[295]]
Indradyumna
Some of Indra’s attributes and func-
tions remain constant as the Hindu tra-
dition changed and developed. In later
Hindu mythology, Indra’s realm is still
the atmospheric region between the
earth and sky, and he is still considered
the god of the storm, the bestower of
rain, and the wielder of the divine thun-
derbolt. Indra is also one of the eight
Guardians of the Directions, holding
sway over the eastern quarter.
Yet some things about Indra changed
around the first millennium; most
importantly, Indra has been “demoted”
to being merely the ruler of the heaven-
ly realms and the king of the gods. Far
from being the supreme, unchallenged
power in the universe, his position is
much more precarious, for he is seen as
affected by the workings of karma.
Indra is actually subject to replacement
when he is spiritually exhausted or
when a challenger on earth grows spir-
itually strong enough to unseat him.
Many of the stories in the classical
Sanskrit texts have their plot advanced
by Indra’s throne becoming hot (a sign
that a human being is gaining the
power to replace Indra), and with Indra
taking some action to counter this
threat. In cases where the challenger is
a celibate ascetic, whose source of
power is the power of renunciation,
Indra usually dispatches an apsara
(divine nymph) whose heavenly
charms can seduce the ascetic and by
destroying his celibacy destroy his
power as well. In other cases the threat
can come from people completing one
hundred great sacrifices; here Indra
somehow forestalls the hundredth sac-
rifice, as he does by stealing the sacred
horse of King Sagar. Indra is the lord
and ruler of the gods, but his position
can only be retained by keeping a sharp
eye on all possible threats.
This loss of “divine” position is seen
by the way Indra is portrayed in certain
mythic tales. In the story of Ahalya he is
portrayed as a lecher and an adulterer,
seducing Ahalya by assuming the form
of her husband, the sage Gautama.
When Gautama discovers what has
[[296]]

happened, he curses Indra to have a
thousand vulvas on his body, although
the curse is later modified to give Indra
a thousand eyes. Indra’s helplessness
before his own lust and his inability
to withstand Gautama’s curse are
sure signs that his divine position
has slipped.
Although he is still regarded as the
bestower of rain and the wielder of the
thunderbolt, another indication of his
diminished power can be seen in his
encounter with the adolescent god
Krishna. When Krishna persuades the
village elders to cease making offerings
to Indra, the latter sends torrential rains
that threaten to destroy the village. In
the face of this threat, Krishna calmly
lifts Mount Govardhan, and for seven
days and nights holds it over their heads
to block the rain. Although Indra
expends all his strength, he is unable to
prevail against the adolescent Krishna,
clearly demonstrating where the real
divinity lies.
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Indra is revealed
to be the divine father of Arjuna, one of
the five Pandava brothers who are the
epic’s protagonists. Arjuna shares his
father’s strengths and weaknesses; he is
heroic and gallant, the archetypal war-
rior who relishes the clash of battle and
is unceasing in defense of his personal
and family honor. He can also be selfish,
egocentric, and boorish, and has many
extramarital liaisons, some of which
produce offspring. Both are wonderful
warriors, if that is what is needed at
the time, but they lack other qualities
to make them productive in times
of peace. This story of Indra and Arjuna
is further evidence that Indra has
fallen from the most important deity
to a minor one who is not an object
of worship.
Indradyumna
In Hindu mythology, a righteous king
who is a great devotee (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu. He has been cursed to
become a giant elephant by the sageIndus
Agastya, who becomes angry when the
king, deep in meditation, fails to greet
the sage with proper respect. After much
pleading, Agastya decrees that the curse
will be broken when Vishnu touches the
elephant on the back. As a result of this
curse, Indradyumna roams the earth as
an elephant for many years.
On one occasion when he is drink-
ing at a lake, his hind leg is seized by a
giant crocodile. The crocodile is actual-
ly a gandharva or celestial musician
named Huhu, whom another sage had
cursed to become a crocodile. Their
struggle lasts for a thousand years, with
the elephant unable to get free, and the
crocodile unable to overpower the ele-
phant. Finally Vishnu himself appears,
kills the crocodile, and restores
Indradyumna to his previous form. The
release of Indradyumna from both the
curse and the crocodile is known as
Gajendramoksha, the “release of the
elephant king.”
Indrajit
(“Conqueror of Indra”) In the Ramayana,
the earlier of the two great Indian epics,
Indrajit is the son of the demon-king
Ravana by his wife Mandodari. In some
later versions of the Ramayana, he is
portrayed as the son of the god Shiva
himself, born after his mother had mar-
ried Ravana. Like his father, Indrajit is a
great devotee (bhakta) of Shiva, and
because of his devotion Shiva teaches
Indrajit how to make himself invisible.
For a warrior, this power is obviously
very valuable, and through it Indrajit is
able to conquer Indra’s heavenly realm
and take Indra as a prisoner back to
Lanka, hence his name.
The god Brahma goes to Lanka, the
kingdom of Ravana, to arrange for Indra’s
release, in return for which Indrajit
demands physical immortality. When he
is told that this is impossible, Indrajit
requests a different power—that when he
performs a certain sacrifice he will
receive horses and a chariot so that he can
kill whatever enemy he faces, and while in
the chariot he cannot be killed.
When the god-king Rama and allies
are storming Lanka, in an effort to
regain Rama’s kidnapped wife Sita,
Indrajit begins to perform this sacrifice.
Warned about this danger by Brahma,
Rama sends his brother Lakshmana to
interrupt it. Lakshmana successfully
disrupts the sacrifice, and in the ensuing
battle kills Indrajit.
Indrani
(Feminine form of Indra) The wife of
the god Indra, the ruler of heaven.
Perhaps reflecting Indra’s diminished
status in later Hindu mythology, Indrani
is not a prominent figure. Her only
important role is as an object of desire
in the story of Nahusha, who through
his meritorious deeds has displaced
Indra as the king of heaven. Nahusha
assumes that he is entitled to Indrani as
well as Indra’s throne, and makes
advances toward her. For his hubris, the
sage Agastya curses Nahusha to be
reborn as a giant serpent.
Indraprastha
The name given to the earliest of the
cities built on the site now occupied
by modern Delhi; Indraprastha was
built on the banks of the Yamuna
River, in the southeastern part of
modern Delhi.
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Indraprastha is
named as the capital of the Pandavas,
the five brothers who are the epic’s pro-
tagonists. According to the epic, the
city is built after their uncle, King
Dhrtarashtra, has divided his kingdom
between the Pandavas and his own
sons, the Kauravas.
Although the epic is replete with
descriptions of Indraprastha, there is
little hard connection between the
archeological site and events described
in the epic.
Indus
River whose source lies in the high
Himalayas, but which flows through
[[297]]
Indus Valley Art
Pakistan for most of its length. The
Indus is traditionally considered one of
the seven sacred rivers of India—the
others are the Ganges, Yamuna,
Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, and
Cauvery—although in modern times
this has diminished, especially since the
creation of Pakistan in 1947 rendered it
inaccessible to most Hindus.
Despite its diminished religious sig-
nificance, the Indus remains important
from a historical perspective, since
many archeological sites from the Indus
Valley civilization have been discovered
on its banks.
Indus Valley Art
Despite the plethora of artifacts that
have been recovered from the cities of
the Indus Valley civilization, objects
that could be interpreted as works of
art are surprisingly sparse. No traces of
decoration have been found inside or
outside the buildings, nor has any mon-
umental architecture been discovered.
The art objects that have been found
in Harappa, a city on the Ravi River in
Pakistan, have all been on a smaller
scale: several stone statues of male tor-
sos, the head and torso of a bearded
man, a copper statue of a young woman
naked except for bangles and jewelry
(said to be a “dancer,” because her arms
and legs are lifted), statues of women
with elaborate headdresses believed to
be icons for a Mother Goddess cult, and
the images of plants, animals, and
humans carved on the Indus Valley
Seals. The latter show delicate and quite
realistic work, indicating a great deal of
skill in working the stone, as well as the
ability to make realistic figural images.
Indus Valley Civilization
(3000–2000 B.C.E.) An ancient and highly
developed urban culture, so named
because the first two sites discovered,
Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, both lie
on the Indus River in what is now
Pakistan. Further searching has
uncovered other sites along much of the
[[298]]

Indus, as well as a web of settlements
stretching east to the upper Ganges
basin, south through the modern state
of
Gujarat
and
into
modern
Maharashtra, and along the coast of
modern Pakistan. The greatest concen-
tration of these settlements has been
found along the banks of the Ghaggar
River, a small and seasonal watercourse
that runs through the state of
Rajasthan. Some historians claim that it
is the bed of the ancient Saraswati
River. Evidence from the sites seems to
indicate that the sites further to the
south developed later, but remained
vital after the cities in the Indus River
Valley, particularly Harappa and
Mohenjo-Daro, had fallen into oblivion.
The discovery of these sites in the early
twentieth century prompted significant
historical revision, since before then it
had been generally assumed that the
people known as the Aryans were the
earliest developed culture in India.
The most striking feature of these
cities is their uniformity—their general
city plan was nearly identical from place
to place (although they differed in
scale), the bricks used throughout all the
cities were exactly the same size, and
there was a standardized set of weights
and measures. Each of the cities also
had a large central granary, which stored
the grain necessary to feed such a siz-
able urban population. Such evident
uniformity over such long distances
bears clear witness to a strong and
centralized government, which some
analysts have speculated was religious
in nature.
Another striking feature of all the
cities was an advanced sanitation sys-
tem. All the houses had channels for
water, and an elaborate network of
drains and sewers ran throughout the
city, even in those sections where the
houses were the smallest, and people
presumably the poorest. Mohenjo-Daro
also has a great tank built of brick and
sealed with pitch, which the archaeolo-
gists have dubbed the “Great Bath.” Why
were the people who built these cities so
concerned with sanitation and bathing?Indus Valley Civilization
Ruins in Mohenjo-Daro. These structures are some of the earliest discovered evidence of the
Indus Valley civilization, a society believed to have emerged around 3000 B.C.E.
Some experts believe this reflected reli-
gious concern for ritual purity, rather
than hygiene.
Many of the artifacts from these
cities are remarkably well preserved,
and give us a fairly comprehensive pic-
ture of their material culture: what they
ate (wheat and barley were the primary
food grains), what they wore (cotton),
which animals they had domesticated
(cattle, fowl, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys,
and dogs), and the implements of every-
day life.
Archeological excavations have also
found more than 2,000 small seals,
which are assumed to have served as the
insignia for mercantile families. Many of
the seals bear writing, although it has
never been deciphered, as well as realis-
tic pictures of animals and human
beings. Three of the seals display a
horned figure sitting with his upper legs
splayed and his heels touching one
another. Some viewers have cited the
figure on these seals as proof that the
Indus Valley culture is the ultimate
source for the god Shiva, a figure who
does not appear in the Vedas, the earli-
est Hindu religious texts, but who later
becomes one of the primary Hindu
deities. In the same way, recovery of sev-
eral statues of women with grossly exag-
gerated female characteristics—breasts,
buttocks, and genitalia—have prompted
others to claim that this culture was the
source for the later Hindu cult of the
Mother Goddess.
One of the controversies connected
with the Indus Valley culture is what
people were living there and whether
their descendants still live in India. The
generally accepted theory among Western
scholars describes a period of contact
between the people in these cities and a
[[299]]
Indus Valley Religion
pastoral group of outsiders called the
Aryans. The language of the Aryans,
Sanskrit, shows certain structural rela-
tionships with classical European lan-
guages and even closer connections to
the Avesta, religious texts of ancient
Iran. Based on an analysis of the rela-
tionships between these languages and
the rate at which these languages have
changed, scholars have inferred that all
these languages came from a common
mother language, and that people
speaking this parent language originated
in central Asia, somewhere near the
Caspian Sea. From there, some went
west to Europe, some went southwest to
Turkey, and some went south toward
Iran, and later to India. This entire theory
is thus based almost solely on the
observed similarities between lan-
guages and assumptions about the rate
of linguistic change—some of which are
necessarily arbitrary.
The one piece of material evidence
for this theory comes in the remains of
horses found at the Indus Valley sites.
The horse was an established part of
Aryan life, according to references based
on the Aryan religious texts, the Vedas,
whereas it seems to have been absent
from the Indus Valley cities—it is not
portrayed on any of the carved seals,
which show many other animals, and
the only bones that have been recovered
from the Indus Valley cities are found in
the most recent archeological strata.
This theory describes a period of con-
tact and possible conflict between the
Aryans and Indus Valley peoples, after
which the Aryan culture and religion
became the dominant force in Indian
life. The Indus Valley cities were com-
pletely forgotten until they were exca-
vated in the early twentieth century.
The Aryan migration theory accounts
for the dissemination of various lan-
guages, but is not universally accepted.
Many modern Indians subscribe to the
Indigenous Aryan (IA) theory, which
contends that the Aryans are the original
inhabitants of India, and as proof points
to the artifacts found in the Indus Valley
civilization. Some IA supporters are
[[300]]

reacting against the Aryan migration
theory’s perceived colonialist bias,
since the theory was developed by
Europeans and assumes that the domi-
nant groups in modern India must have
come from outside. Other supporters
are the proponents of Hindutva, who
identify being Hindu with being an
Indian. The IA theory allows Hindutva
proponents to claim that all Indians are
“really” Hindus and thus one social
group, whatever their particular reli-
gious beliefs. This assertion has pro-
found political implications in modern
India, where Christians and Muslims
are not only religious communities,
but social and political ones. By con-
necting Hindu identity and good
Indian citizenship, Hindutva propo-
nents are marginalizing Christians and
Muslims as outsiders.
Such claims are intriguing, but there
is slim evidence for them. The real truth
is that researchers have recovered lots
of material objects, but what these
things mean is open to interpretation.
At the very least, we know that this
culture flourished for about a thousand
years. Its final collapse—because of
a prolonged drought, according to
one theory—took place around 2000
B.C.E. For further information see
Walter Ashlin Fairservis, The Roots of
Ancient India, 1975.
Indus Valley Religion
Although some experts have made
definitive claims about the religion of
the Indus Valley civilization, it must be
remembered that all these claims are
highly speculative, since they are solely
based on the remains from the cities.
Artifacts such as grains, animal bones,
traces of fabric, and building founda-
tions give us a good basis for knowing
about the material life of this culture—
what people ate, what they wore, and
the types of dwellings they lived in.
The notion of religion, however, is far
more abstract. It is thus not only harder
to infer what types of religion were prac-
ticed from the artifacts that have beenIndus Valley Seals
recovered, but these same artifacts can
also be used as evidence for widely dif-
fering conclusions. The objects them-
selves are mute and can be interpreted
in many ways. Still, among these objects
are several artifacts that are intriguing.
Among the artifacts found at sites in
the Indus Valley civilization have been
ceramic female figures with grossly
exaggerated female characteristics—
breasts, buttocks, and genitalia. These
figures strongly resemble the Bronze
Age European image known as the
“Venus of Willendorf,” which has been
associated with the worship of female
fertility and procreative power. Given
these similarities, it seems likely that a
similar cult existed in the Indus Valley
civilization. The statues give no indica-
tion of how widespread this cult was—
whether it was related to fertility cults in
other places or was simply a parallel
development. There is no proof that this
cult was the basis for the later Hindu
worship of the Goddess as the supreme
reality. Any such claims are making
broader inferences from this limited
material evidence—at best, such claims
are highly speculative; at worst, they
are irresponsible and driven by an
underlying agenda.
The other intriguing artifacts from
the Indus Valley civilization have come
from seals, of which several hundred
have been found. Many of the seals have
pictures of animals or objects from
everyday life, but three of the seals from
Harappa bear the image of a horned fig-
ure sitting cross-legged on a small plat-
form. Some viewers have described this
figure as a “Proto-Shiva,” since it has
several features associated with the
Hindu god Shiva—the sitting posture is
associated with the practice of yoga, and
the figure’s horns indicate his form as
Pashupati, the “Lord of Beasts.”
Proponents of this theory point to
the Indus Valley culture for the roots of
Shiva, rightly noting that although Shiva
becomes prominent in later Hinduism,
he is virtually absent from the Vedic
pantheon. Virtually the only place that
Shiva appears is in the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad, one of the latest of the mys-
tical texts known as the Upanishads,
which describes the god Rudra—later
identified with Shiva—as the supreme
power in the universe.
Although it is possible that the wor-
ship of Shiva lies in the Indus Valley cul-
ture, anyone not inclined to believe this
at the outset will be hard-pressed to find
this particular evidence persuasive.
There is also mysterious writing on the
seals, and if and when this writing is
deciphered these relationships may
become clearer. See also Veda.
Indus Valley Seals
The most enigmatic objects from the
Indus Valley civilization are small
square or rectangular-shaped pieces of
soapstone, which are believed to have
been official seals for merchants and
other individuals. Archaeologists have
unearthed more than two thousand of
these seals, which generally combine a
pictorial image with an inscription.
Most of the seal images are common
domestic animals, particularly the bull,
but a few portray mythical beasts such
as a unicorn, or even more intriguing
human figures. One well-known exam-
ple of the latter shows a human figure—
perhaps a mythic hero—strangling a
tiger with each hand. Other figures
include a horned man, in one case
standing in front of a table and in another
sitting in a yoga-like position. He is
sometimes identified as an early form of
the god Shiva and cited as evidence that
this deity’s cult came from the Indus
Valley cities.
Far less is known about the seal
inscriptions, since the writing system
for these inscriptions has never been
deciphered, although many different
theories have been advanced. One rea-
son for the disagreement is the divi-
sion of opinion regarding the Indus
Valley culture itself. Those who believe
that Indus Valley culture preceded the
arrival of the Aryans, and was distinct
from it, tend to look for evidence in
the Dravidian language family, which
[[301]]
Infanticide
is linguistically distinct from the Indo-
Aryan language family. Those who
espouse the Indigenous Aryan view,
which identifies the Indus Valley culture
with that of the Aryans, tend to seek
their evidence in the earliest Sanskrit
texts known as the Vedas.
None of these theories have proved
irrefutable, and part of the difficulty in
deciphering this script comes from the
inscriptions themselves. Linguists have
identified 419 different symbols, which
seems too many for the script to be
alphabetic, but too few for each of these
symbols to stand for a single word, as is
the case in Chinese. The seals’ small size
also means that these inscriptions tend
to be extremely short. Such brevity
makes the text difficult to understand,
since one lacks the contextual patterns
that a longer text would supply. In their
efforts to decode these inscriptions, lin-
guists are working with a series of short
and unrelated textual fragments. The
script could probably be definitively
deciphered with the discovery of a bilin-
gual inscription, but in the absence of
such a key, the problems may prove to
be insurmountable. For further infor-
mation see F. Raymond Allchin, The
Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia,
[[1995]]
; and Romila Thapar, Interpreting
Early India, 1992. For the Indigenous
Aryan viewpoint, see David Frawley, The
Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India,
[[1994]]
; and Vedic Aryans and the Origins
of Civilization, 1997.
Infanticide
The practice of parents killing their child
is uncommon and subject to sharp con-
demnation. In some cases these infants
are illegitimate, and infanticide or aban-
donment is an attempt to avoid the
social repercussions of what is consid-
ered an immoral act.
There are several examples of this
practice in Hindu mythology, of whom
the best known is Kunti. Kunti has been
given a mantra by the sage Durvasas,
which gives her the power to conceive
and bear children by the gods. On a
[[302]]

whim, Kunti impulsively uses the
mantra to invoke the Sun, by whom
she conceives and bears her son Karna.
In her panic at unexpectedly becoming
a mother—she was still unmarried,
and understandably concerned about
what people might think—she puts
the child in a box and abandons him
in the Ganges.
In other cases, infants are killed by
their parents because of the family’s
desperate poverty. Almost without
exception, the children killed in such
cases are daughters. If caught, the par-
ents would be subject to a murder
charge. But infanticide is often hard to
prove if a baby was not born in a hospi-
tal, where births are formally registered.
For poor families, daughters are often
seen as a tremendous financial burden,
because the expense that will be neces-
sary to arrange their marriages is often
more than people can pay. This attitude
toward daughters is also reinforced by
the traditional Indian marriage pattern,
in which a family’s sons bring their
brides into the family home, continue
the joint family, and care for their
parents in their old age. Since after
marriage daughters become members
of their husband’s family, they are often
seen as “temporary” residents in the
homes of their parents. For further
information see Elizabeth Bumiller,
May You Be the Mother of a Hundred
Sons, 1990.
Inference
See anumana.
Infinite Regress
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to be
avoided in constructing an argument.
An infinite regress is not only an infinite
series, but one in which there is no final
cause to make it happen or not happen.
A standard Western example of an
infinite regress is the man who informs
the philosopher that the world is sup-
ported on the back of a giant tortoise.
Upon being asked what supported theInitiation
tortoise, the man replies, “another
tortoise.” Several similar queries bring
the same reply, until in frustration
the man bursts out “It’s no use trying to
trick me—after this, it is tortoises all
the way down!”
In an Indian context, the infinite
regress fallacy is seen as an extended
case of the fallacy of self-residence, and
equally objectionable.
Inherence
In the Nyaya philosophical school,
inherence (samavaya) is the name for a
weak relational force that is assumed to
connect objects and their attributes—
for example, connecting the color red
with a particular ball, and thus making
the ball red. See samavaya.
Inheritance
Traditional Hindu law has several differ-
ent patterns for inheritance. A few
communities in southern India practice
matrilinear succession, in which
inheritance is passed through the
mother’s line.
In much of the rest of India,
inheritance is patrilineal. Patrilineal
inheritance takes two major forms,
according to the prescriptions found
in two major legal texts: the Dayabhaga
in the region of Bengal; and throughout
much of the rest of India, variants
on the Mitakshara .
The Mitakshara vests joint family
property only in males born into the
male line. All males have equal shares
in the family property, although the
head of the family is normally in
charge of administering it. Under this
arrangement, the death of a male
heir automatically increases the share
of all the other surviving males,
whereas the birth of a male decreases
this share. The Mitakshara gives
women no right to inherit family
property, although women generally
have rights to personal wealth
(stridhan) that was theirs to bequeath
and inherit.
The Mitakshara system was based on
the principle of survivorship, under
which only living people could inherit
property. The Dayabhaga model stresses
succession, under which sons do not
become shareholders of the family
property at birth, but upon the death of
their father. If a son happens to die
before his father, the son’s heirs (includ-
ing his wife and daughters) become
inheritors, not in their own right, but as
representatives of the deceased heir.
Under the Dayabhaga model both
widows and daughters could have a
share in family property, and they are
allowed to act as agents in their own
right. In theory this seems far more
advantageous to women, but in fact it is
believed to have had some gruesome
consequences. When the British first
came to Bengal late in the eighteenth
century, they were horrified by the
prevalence of sati, the rite in which a
widow would be burned on her hus-
band’s funeral pyre. Based on admittedly
incomplete evidence, it seems that sati
was not nearly so common in many
other parts of India. One theory to
explain this discrepancy is that sati was
the family’s way to keep their daughter-
in-law—who was an outsider to the
family—from being able to gain control
over their ancestral property.
Initiation
In general, an initiation is a ritual
in which a person is given certain
new rights, capacities, and responsibili-
ties. In a Hindu religious context,
there are two important rites of
religious initiation.
One of these is the upanayana sam-
skara, an adolescent religious initiation
performed on a “twice-born” male—
that is, a member of the brahmin, ksha-
triya, or vaishya group—which is also
known as the “second birth.”
The other rite of initiation, diksha,
is conferred on a person at the pleasure
of a guru or religious preceptor and
has no limitations on who or when it
can be received.
[[303]]
Inscriptions
Inscription of the edicts of Ashoka.
[[304]]

InscriptionsInstallation
The oldest Hindu inscriptions are the
edicts of Ashoka, which were either
carved on rock faces or on stone
pillars; many of these inscriptions are
still readable today, despite being
more than two thousand years old.
Inscriptions on pillars were ordered
by rulers, and were concerned with
more sweeping issues, probably due
to the inscriptions’ public quality
and their often monumental nature.
Aside from stone, the inscriptions
were often done on copper plates.
These were often used to record land
grants, deeds, and other sorts of
bequests, since their permanence
made them more preferable than paper
for safeguarding property rights. In
themselves such inscriptions generally
contain very specific historical informa-
tion, which can help to fill out more gen-
eral knowledge about their time.This is a general term that refers to
the rites for both constructing and
establishing the image of a deity in
a temple setting (devapratishtha), and
for ritually “awakening” the image
so that it becomes a seat for the
deity (pranapratishtha).
Intentional Language
General term for a cryptic and coded
language (Sandhabhasha) intended to
conceal information from people who
have not been initiated into that partic-
ular religious group. See Sandhabhasha.
Intercalary Month
The Hindu ritual year is largely based on
a lunar calendar, whose twelve lunar
months are finished in about 354 solar
days (as opposed to our 365-day calen-
dar). This disparity with the solar calen-
dar means that each lunar year begins
eleven days earlier than the previousIsha (“Lord”) Upanishad
lunar year. The discrepancy meant
that the two calendars would increas-
ingly diverge, such that (for example)
“spring” festivals could occur at any
time of the year.
It has been resolved by the addition
of an intercalary month about every
[[21]]
⁄2 years—more precisely, every thirty-
two months, sixteen days, one hour
and twenty-six minutes. This intercalary
month can take place during any of
the year’s twelve lunar months and
takes the name of the regular lunar
month preceding it.
As an unusual phenomenon, the
extra month is generally seen as a ritually
dangerous time, and one of its common
epithets is the “impure month” (mala-
masa). During this month it is believed
that one should not initiate any new
projects, or perform any religious cere-
monies whose timing is fluid and can be
postponed, particularly marriages.
Worship is highly encouraged during
this time and keeping religious fasts and
giving charity (dana) are also thought to
be highly efficacious.
All of these are means of countering
the inauspiciousness of this calendrical
time—fasts and worship are ways to
gain divine favor and protection, while
charity acts as a channel to remove any
potential bad fortune, by transferring it
to the recipient.
When this extra month comes in the
lunar month of Ashadh, it is called
Purushottama Mas, and especially
marked by the devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu as a time for worship and
other spiritual exercises.
Internal Sacrifice
In general, a type of worship in which
concrete external actions have been
replaced by internal and purely mental
ones. See antaryaga.
Intoxicants
In general, Hindu culture condemns
anything that could lead to loss of
control, including intoxicants such as
alcohol and mind-altering drugs. The
level of disapproval associated with
these substances depends on the
substance itself and the circumstances
under which it is consumed. For
example, consumption of distilled
spirits (“foreign liquor”) is seen as a
sign of adopting outside values, while
consuming undistilled, fermented
beverages such as “country liquor” and
toddy is considered a low-class activi-
ty. However, there are a handful of
Hindu temples at which liquor is the
everyday offering to the deity and
worshipers consume it as prasad, the
sanctified food or drink that carries the
deity’s blessing.
The attitude toward intoxicating
drugs is also complex. Although they are
also subject to general disapproval,
Hindu mythology portrays Shiva as
regularly consuming both bhang, made
from crushed marijuana, and the
intoxicating datura plant. Some of
Shiva’s devotees (bhakta) do the same in
emulation of their chosen deity, and
many ascetics regularly smoke hashish
(charas) mixed with tobacco, a habit
interpreted by some as an intentional
separation from the normal social
system. Consuming bhang is a fairly
common feature of certain religious
festivals, such as Shivaratri and
Holi, although there are many people
who abstain.
Isha (“Lord”) Upanishad
At eighteen verses, one of the shortest
of the early speculative texts known
as the Upanishads; the name of this
upanishad comes from the first word of
the text. It is believed to be one of the
late upanishads due to its brevity, its
composition in verse rather than prose,
and the use of verses that appear in
other upanishads. As with many of the
later upanishads, the Isha Upanishad
propounds a loosely defined monism, in
which the source of all things is ascribed
to a single power. This power can be
discovered through a flash of mystic
insight when the seeker is able to
[[305]]
Ishitvam
transcend the illusion that objects
are unconnected and recognize the one
real power in the universe. The insight
is believed to give a definitive under-
standing into the workings of the
universe and to bring the individual final
release of the soul (moksha) from the
cycle of reincarnation (samsara).
Ishitvam
(“superiority”) One of the eight superhu-
man powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be earned when a person
reaches a high degree of spiritual attain-
ment. This particular power stems from
the control over matter (prakrti), which
along with purusha are the two princi-
ples of the Samkhya philosophical sys-
tem. This control over primal matter
allows one to create, destroy, and
rearrange material objects.
Ishtadevata
(“chosen deity”) The specific Hindu
divinity that an individual has chosen for
more or less exclusive worship and
devotion. In many cases, this choice is
done without denying the existence of
the other Hindu deities, although they
are sometimes interpreted as secondary
manifestations of the ishtadevata. On
the whole, Hindus have been willing to
acknowledge a plurality of divine names
and forms, but each person generally
directs attention and worship to only
one of these deities. The particular deity
one worships is ultimately a matter of
personal choice, although family and
regional loyalties usually play a strong
role in this choice.
Ishvara
(“lord”) Primarily an epithet of the god
Shiva, especially when the word is used
at the end of compound names, such as
Rameshvar, “the Lord of Rama,” or
Mahakaleshvar, “the Lord of Death.” In
its more general meaning as “lord,” ish-
vara can also be part of the name taken
by earthly rulers, such as the Chalukya
monarch Someshvara (r. 1242–1268).
[[306]]

Ishvarakrishna
(4th c.) Indian philosopher who is
traditionally cited as the author of the
Samkhyakarikas, a collection of sayings
that explain the basic position of the
Samkhya philosophical school. The
Samkhya school is one of the six
schools in traditional Hindu philoso-
phy, and its position is an atheistic
philosophical dualism, in which two
fundamental principles, prakrti (“nature”)
and purusha (“person”), are the source
of all things.
Ishvara Puri
(c. 1500) Ecstatic devotee (bhakta) of the
god Krishna, who is famous as the guru
of the Bengali saint Chaitanya. Little is
known about Ishvara Puri’s background,
although his surname “Puri” indicates
that he took formal ascetic initiation in
the Puri branch of the Dashanami
Sanyasis. After meeting Ishvara Puri in
[[1508]]
 in the pilgrimage town of Gaya,
Chaitanya was fired with devotion to
Krishna, and he began to perform the
public ecstatic recitations of Krishna’s
name that have become an established
element in the religious life of the com-
munity that claims him as its founder,
the Gaudiya Vaishnavas. See also ISKCON.
ISKCON
Acronym for the International Society
for Krishna Consciousness, a Hindu
missionary community commonly
known as the Hare Krishnas. This
name comes from ISKCON’s emphasis
on the importance of repeating the
divine name, particularly the formula
known as the mahamantra (“Hare
Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,
Hare Hare”). ISKCON was founded by A. C.
Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, and its reli-
gious roots lie in the Vaishnava piety of
his native Bengal. The Bengali Vaishnava
tradition has long emphasized the
importance of publicly chanting
Krishna’s name, particularly in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community founded
by the Bengali saint Chaitanya.ISKCON
ISKCON comes out of this Bengali tra-
dition, but in other ways it shows ten-
sions that mark it as a twentieth-century
phenomenon. Its strong missionary
activities make it a highly unusual Hindu
religious organization, as does its mem-
bership—Prabhupada founded ISKCON in
New York City, most of ISKCON’s members
are Western converts from Judaism and
Christianity, and the bulk of its mission-
ary activities have been performed out-
side of India. The roots of ISKCON ’s
membership, and the general fervor
associated with converts, have led to
some theological contradictions. On
one hand, ISKCON doctrine tends to den-
igrate human capacity, putting the
emphasis on the saving power of God’s
grace. On the other hand, ISKCON devo-
tees (bhakta) believe that they gain
religious merit by living a rigorously
regulated lifestyle that mandates a
strict vegetarian diet, abstinence from
liquor and nonmedicinal drugs, sexual
activity only for procreation, and a
well-established daily religious routine;
many devotees also adopt Indian cloth-
ing and hair styles. In these two oppos-
ing emphases—complete surrender to
God’s grace, and strict adherence to a
prescribed “holy” lifestyle—ISKCON shows
surprising parallels to evangelical
Christianity. Since Prabhupada’s death in
[[1977]]
, the organization has been run by
these Western converts, and thus ISKCON
can be characterized as a “countercul-
tural” Euro-American phenomenon,
despite its Indian origins. ISKCON has a
significant presence in Brindavan, the
village celebrated as Krishna’s childhood
home, where the group has built a
magnificent temple; they are also active
in Mayapur in Bengal, which they
claim as Chaitanya’s birthplace. After a
period of growth in the 1970s, ISKCON had
serious legal problems in the 1980s,
including losses in civil suits and
allegations of money laundering and
murder. For a sympathetic perspective
on the movement, see Larry Shinn,
The Dark Lord, 1987; and Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.

Jabali
## J
Jabali
A famous sage in Hindu mythology and
son of the sage Vishvamitra. Despite his
biological origins, Jabali eventually
becomes associated with his father’s
sworn enemy, the sage Vasishtha. As a
member of Vasishtha’s group, Jabali
becomes one of the advisers to King
Dasharatha, the father of the god-king
Rama in the epic Ramayana.
Jada
(“inert,” “insentient”) In a philosophical
context, the word jada is used to desig-
nate physical matter, which is inert and
devoid of cognitive functions. In a more
extended sense, the word can refer to
any person completely lacking religious
capacities, sensibilities, or interest, and
who is, thus, from a religious perspec-
tive, simply inert.

regional deity Jagannath, and by exten-
sion the god Vishnu, to whom
Jagannath has been connected as a form
of Krishna, the eighth avatar or incar-
nation of Vishnu. Jagadisha is the name
given to Jagannath in the Dashavatara
Stotra, the opening hymn in the
Gitagovinda, a lyric devotional poem
composed by the poet Jayadeva. In
modern northern India, the name
Jagadisha is used in one of the most
[[308]]

popular and best-known devotional
hymns, the Jagadisha Arati, a hymn
directed more particularly to Vishnu.
Jagamohan
In the temple architecture of Orissa,
one of the major forms of the northern
Indian Nagara style, the jagamohan is
the entrance porch to the temple, which
provides a transitional space between
the outside world and the sacred space
further in. In Orissan temples, the jag-
amohan tended to be low and squat, in
sharp contrast to the deul, or main
internal area, a beehive-shaped tower
under which the image of the temple’s
primary deity resided.
Jagannath
(“Master of the Universe”) Presiding
deity of the Jagannath temple in Puri.
Puri is and has long been a major center
for Hindu culture, a circumstance that
has
underlined
and
reinforced
Jagannath’s importance as the city’s
presiding deity. Although Jagannath is
identified as a manifestation of the
god Krishna, his roots lie elsewhere.
He is generally considered to be an
autochthonous (“of the land”) deity,
who was originally the local deity of Puri
but who has been assimilated into the
wider pantheon as a form of Krishna,
and therefore, by extension, a form of
Vishnu. This assimilation shows
Jagannath’s importance and influence
in the local setting, since he could not
be simply marginalized. It is also an
example of the Vaishnava tendency
for such assimilation, most often
through the doctrine of the avatars or
divine incarnations.
In the Puri temple and other icono-
graphic representations, Jagannath
invariably appears as a member of a trio:
Jagannath (Krishna) appears on the
right,
his
brother
Balabhadra
(Balarama) is on the left, and the small-
er figure in the center is their sister
Subhadra. This triadic grouping and the
depiction of a female figure are veryJageshvar
unusual in Krishna devotion, as is the
form of these images, which clearly
come from a folk or tribal tradition. All
three deities are made from logs so
roughly cut that the facial features are
almost indistinguishable, their arms are
unnaturally short and stubby, and the
images are brightly painted. Each of
these peculiar elements is seen as fur-
ther evidence of Jagannath’s indigenous
roots. A final piece of evidence for his
local origins is seen in his connection
with his hereditary servants, the daitas,
a tribal people who are considered
virtually untouchable. Despite their
marginal status in conventional society,
the daitas are responsible for sculpting
new images of the trio when they are
periodically replaced. The daitas also
consider Jagannath their blood relative,
further pointing to his ambiguous roots.
The myth explaining these images is
based
on
the
virtuous
King
Indradyumna. Indradyumna has a
vision of Vishnu in a dream, in which
Vishnu directs the king to make an
image of Jagannath from an enormous
log that he has found. While the king is
wondering how to do this, a mysterious
man appears, who is actually
Vishvakarma, the architect of the gods.
The mysterious man offers to carve the
statues, on the condition that he will not
be disturbed until he is finished. He then
disappears into his workroom for two
weeks, but the people are mystified by
what he is doing, since they hear no
sounds of carving. This seeming inactiv-
ity piques the people’s curiosity, and
finally one of the queens prevails on the
king to look inside. When the king opens
the door, he finds no one there, and the
statues only half-finished. In another
dream that night, the king is ordered to
paint and consecrate the statues as they
are, and this form has reportedly
remained the same ever since. For fur-
ther information on the history and
influence of Jagannath, by far the best
source is Anncharlott Eschmann,
Hermann Kulke, and Gaya Charan
Tripathi, The Cult of Jagannath and the
Regional Tradition of Orissa, 1978.
Jageshvar
Temple complex and sacred site (tirtha)
in the village with the same name, locat-
ed in the Kumaon foothills of the
Himalayas in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The Jageshvar temple complex contains
[[124]]
 different temples, concentrated in an
area about the size of a football field.
Virtually all of these temples are dedicated
to some form of the god Shiva, and the
few that house other deities are either
temples to the Goddess—considered to
be Shiva’s wife—or in one case to the god
Hanuman, who is sometimes considered
an avatar or incarnation of Shiva. Most of
these temples are extremely small—
either an open image of Shiva’s aniconic
symbol, the linga, or a temple building
no larger than a telephone booth. The
three largest most important temples are
to Shiva in his forms as Kedarnath, as
Mrtyunjaya (“Conqueror of Death”), and
as Jageshvar, from which the site gets its
name. The name Jageshvar means “The
Wakeful Lord” and signifies that this par-
ticular form of Shiva is always alert to the
needs of his devotees (bhakta) and will
quickly fulfill any request.
Local tradition claims that Jageshvar
is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a net-
work of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva, and at which Shiva is uniquely pre-
sent. This claim is not supported by the
traditional list of the jyotirlingas, but
Jageshvar has been a pilgrimage site for
more than a thousand years. The
Mrtyunjaya temple has been dated to the
eighth century C.E., while the Jageshvar
temple was built about two centuries
later. Since that time, further building at
the Jageshvar complex has come through
patronage by several different groups of
hill kings, most recently those of the
Chand dynasty, who ruled the region
between the fifteenth and eighteenth
centuries. The temple complex’s indis-
putable antiquity, its association with
royal power, and its identity as a place
where Shiva readily grants one’s wishes,
have all combined to make it the most
important pilgrimage place in the
Kumaon region.

Jahnu
Sculpture of the goddess Ganga, the Ganges River,
who is also known as Jahnavi.
Jahnavi
(“daughter of Jahnu”) Epithet of the
Ganges River, which Hindus consider to
be the physical form of the goddess
Ganga. The name Jahnavi refers to an
incident during her creation in which
she encounters Jahnu, a great ascetic
who has amassed great power through
performing harsh physical asceticism
(tapas). After the Ganges has been
brought down to earth by the sage
Bhagirath, but before she makes her
way to the ocean, the playful river picks
up and carries away Jahnu’s belongings
while the sage is meditating nearby.
Jahnu is enraged at this disrespect; to
punish Ganga, he drinks all of the water
in the river. When the gods realize what
has happened, they are very concerned.
They somehow manage to placate
Jahnu, and the sage agrees to release
her. The problem then is how to release
the Ganges in a way that will not defile
her, since vomiting her up or voiding her
as urine are both unacceptable. In the

Jaimini
(4th c. B.C.E.?) Figure traditionally cited
as the author of the Mimamsa Sutras,
the central texts of the Purva Mimamsa
school, one of the six schools of Indian
philosophy. The Mimamsa school is
most concerned with the examination
and pursuit of dharma (“righteous
action”). In their pursuit of dharma,
the Mimamsa also believed that all
necessary instructions were contained
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Given these twin assumptions,
much of Mimamsa thought is devoted to
the principles and methods of textual
interpretation used to unlock the
instructions that they were confident
the Vedas contained.Jambudvipa
Jajman
Common form of the Sanskrit word
yajamana, “patron of the sacrifice.”
From the time of the earliest Vedic sacri-
fices, there was a sharp distinction
between the people who performed the
sacrifice (basically hired technicians)
and the people who actually paid the
money to sponsor it and were consid-
ered the rite’s true beneficiaries. In con-
temporary times, jajman is the term
used by pandas, the priests at pilgrim-
age places (tirtha), to refer to their pil-
grim clients, with whom they have a
hereditary relationship. This usage
admits the reality that the pilgrims are
their patrons, since the priests’ liveli-
hood comes from serving them, but the
term also carries associations of mutual
obligation. Pandas are entitled to fees
from their pilgrim clients but must also
render services to them, while pilgrims
are bound to uphold this hereditary
relationship but can depend on their
pandas for help.
and incendiary temper. In one of the
most famous episodes, when his wife
Renuka returns home late because
she has spent some time watching a
king and his wife sport in the water,
Jamadagni orders his sons to kill her. All
of them refuse except Parashuram, who
cuts off his mother’s head. Jamadagni is
pleased with Parashuram and tells him
to choose whatever reward he wants.
Parashuram requests that his mother be
restored to life again, which she is.
Jamadagni is also famous as the
owner of a divine cow that can pro-
vide all sorts of food on demand. The
local king grows covetous of the cow
and offers to buy it. When Jamadagni
refuses to sell her, the king’s men grow
angry, kill Jamadagni, and take the
cow back to the palace. It is in retalia-
tion for this heinous act that
Parashuram attempts to exterminate
the kingly class (kshatriyas) from the
face of the earth.
Jambhavan
Jallianwala Bagh
A park (bagh) in the center of the
northern Indian city of Amritsar at
which several thousand people were
killed or wounded in 1919. A crowd had
gathered at this park despite a strict
ban on public meetings established the
day before. The British officer in
charge, General Dyer, interpreted the
gathering as willful defiance of the law
and commanded his men to fire on the
crowd. This incident was highly signifi-
cant in the struggle for Indian indepen-
dence (finally achieved on August 15,
[[1947]]
), for it undercut British claims
that their presence was necessary to
keep the country from chaos and, in
the minds of many Indian leaders,
removed any moral authority by which
the British could justify their rule.
Jamadagni
In Hindu mythology, a great sage and
father of Parashuram avatar. Like many
sages, Jamadagni is a man of explosive
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Jambhavan
is one of the ministers of Sugriva,
king of the monkeys. Jambhavan is
generally described as a bear, although
in some sources he is said to be a mon-
key. In the search for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, it is Jambhavan
who convinces the monkey-god
Hanuman to attempt to jump over the
ocean to Lanka, reminding Hanuman of
his birth, deeds, and the divine boons
he has been given. Although at first
Hanuman doubts his ability, he is con-
vinced by Jambhavan’s encouragement
and, with a mighty spring, leaps over the
sea to Lanka, where he eventually dis-
covers Sita.
Jambudvipa
(“rose-apple”) In traditional mythic
geography, the first and innermost of
the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world. At
the center of Jambudvipa stands Mount
[[311]]
Jambukeshvar
Meru, the center of the entire universe.
Mount Meru is surrounded by mountain
ranges, and the part of Jambudvipa
south of Mount Meru is the land known
as Bharata, the traditional name for the
Indian subcontinent. See also Cosmology.
Jambukeshvar
Sacred site (tirtha) and southern Indian
temple-town near the city of
Tiruchirappalli in the state of Tamil
Nadu, directly opposite the great
temple complex of Shrirangam. The
temple at Jambukeshvar is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his role as “Lord of the
Rose-Apple (jambu) Tree;” the image of
Shiva is placed under one of these trees.
Jambukeshvar is also one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a
network of five southern Indian sites
sacred to Shiva. In each of these
sites Shiva is represented as a linga,
the pillar-shaped object that is his
symbolic form, and at each site the
linga is believed to be formed from one
of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). At Jambukeshvar,
Shiva’s image is associated with water,
and the linga is set into a pool created
by a natural spring.
Jammu
One of the three distinct cultural areas
in the modern Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir; the other two are
western Kashmir and Ladakh. Jammu
and Kashmir is a former princely state
once ruled by the Dogras, a small
regional dynasty. Although the Dogra
kings were Hindus, they ruled over
the minority populations of the
mostly Muslim Kashmiris and the
mostly Buddhist Ladakhis; this ethnic
and religious division continues in
modern times. The Jammu region is
geographically part of the northern
Indian plain, and the surrounding
regions south of the Shiwalik Hills are
Hindu majority regions. However,
Jammu is also in close proximity to the
[[312]]

Punjab, the center of Sikhism, a
monotheistic religion that combines
elements of Hinduism and Islam; conse-
quently Jammu is also home to a signifi-
cant Sikh population. By far the most
celebrated shrine in the Jammu region
is the one dedicated to Vaishno Devi,
a goddess who is reputed to grant all
of one’s wishes. In the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, Jammu was
also one of the centers for the Pahari
school of miniature painting. Aside
from being the name of this region,
Jammu is also the name of the region’s
largest city, the state’s traditional
winter capital. For general information
about Jammu and all the regions of
India, an accessible reference is

Janabai
(d. c.1350) Female poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Janabai came to Pandharpur with her
parents when she was seven but refused
to go home with them, saying that she
wanted to remain close to the Lord. She
became the servant of another Varkari
saint, Namdev, who made her a mem-
ber of his circle of devotees (bhakta).
Janabai is famous for her devotional
songs, which remain popular today. For
further information see Justin E. Abbott
and Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories
of Indian Saints, 1982; and G. A. Deleury,
The Cult of Vithoba, 1960.
Janaka
The foster father of the goddess Sita. He
discovered her one day while plowing a
furrow in a field. In Hindu mythology,
Janaka is the paradigm of the sage-king,
a person who despite his wealth and
position was as perfectly dispassionate
as any ascetic living in the forest.Janamjeya
Janaki Navami
Festival falling on the ninth day
(navami) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March). This festival cele-
brates the birth of Sita, wife of the
god king Rama and heroine of the
epic Ramayana. Sita is not born in the
usual manner, but is found by King
Janaka in a furrow as he plows a field
(hence the name Janaki, a female form
of Janaka). As the wife of Rama, himself
an avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu, Sita is believed to be a form of
Lakshmi, Vishnu’s wife. In her absolute
devotion to her husband, Sita is consid-
ered a model for Indian women; women
performing the prescribed religious rites
for this day are promised children and
prosperity.
Janakpur
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
western part of Nepal, seven miles
north of the border with the Indian state
of Bihar. Janakpur is said to be the
capital of King Janaka, a noted sage and
the foster father of the goddess Sita
in the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics. According to tra-
dition, Janaka’s capital was destroyed
during the war described in the
Mahabharata—the other great Hindu
epic—and disappeared without a
trace. The present site of Janakpur
dates from the early eighteenth century
and is said to have been discovered by
two Vaishnava devotees (bhakta),
Chaturbhuj Giri and Sur Kishor.
Chaturbhuj Giri had a vision of the god
Rama in a dream and was directed to
dig beneath a banyan tree. When he did,
he found four images of Vishnu, each in
a differing divine manifestation. Sur
Kishor was a great devotee of Sita, and
through her agency discovered the spot
as well. Other ascetics began to come to
this site, which is still an important stop
on the annual pilgrimage cycle of the
Ramanandi ascetics. The ascetics were
followed by shepherds and merchants,
and the town of Janakpur gradually grew
Janaki Mandir in Janakpur, Nepal. This temple
marks the site where the goddess Sita first appeared.
up from there. For extensive treatment
of this site and the veracity of these
stories, see Richard Burghart, “The
History of Janakpur,” in Kailash, Vol. 6,
No. 4, 1978.
Janamjeya
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Parikshit; Janamjeya rules after his
father’s untimely death from the bite of
the serpent Takshaka. Janamjeya has a
pronounced hatred of serpents because
of Takshaka’s role in his father’s death,
and during his reign he performs a great
sacrifice known as the Sarpasatra,
through which most of the snakes on
earth are killed. Takshaka manages to
stop the sacrifice before all of the earth’s
serpents are completely wiped out by
pleading with a brahmin to help him.
The brahmin comes to Janamjeya’s sac-
rifice as a guest and requests that the
sacrifice be stopped. Since, according to
tradition, a brahmin guest’s request can-
not be refused, Janamjeya is compelled
to curtail the rite.

Janardana
Janardana
(“exciting his devotees”) Epithet of the
god Krishna. See Krishna.
Jana Sangh
Modern Indian political party, founded
in 1951 by Shyam Prasad Mookerjee.
Despite Mookerjee’s earlier roots in the
Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist
organization, the Jana Sangh’s leader-
ship largely came from workers
dispatched by another conservative
Hindu organization, the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS). By the mid-
[[1950]]
s the Jana Sangh had become the
political arm of the RSS, with RSS mem-
bers filling most of the party’s important
positions. In its political platform the
Jana Sangh espoused many populist
Hindu causes, such as a ban on cow
slaughter and the prohibition of alco-
holic beverages, but the party was also
noted for its sympathetic orientation
toward farmers, who formed one of its
important constituencies. The Jana
Sangh’s high point came in the 1977 gen-
eral elections, when it won ninety-three
seats in Parliament. It was the largest
single party in the coalition of political
parties that ousted Indira Gandhi’s
Congress Party and ended their two
years of martial law. This triumph quick-
ly turned to failure: the Janata govern-
ment dissolved over the so-called
dual-membership controversy, which
was rooted in concerns over Jana Sangh
members simultaneously being mem-
bers of the RSS. Legislators from other
parties saw this as creating a conflict of
interest and were also wary of their gov-
ernment being directed by the RSS,
which was considered a Hindu chauvin-
ist organization. These outside legisla-
tors demanded that Jana Sangh members
renounce all RSS ties, which the latter
were unwilling to do. All attempts at
compromise eventually failed, and after
the Congress Party came back to power
in 1980, the Jana Sangh legislators and
other remnants of the Janata govern-
ment formed a new party, the Bharatiya
Janata Party. For further information

Janeu
The sacred thread worn by all “twice-
born” (dvija) men, as a visible symbol of
having undergone the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” The janeu is a circular cord made
of three strands (in which each cord also
has three strands), which is worn over
the left shoulder, crossing the body to
fall on the right hip. See sacred thread.
Jangama
(“moving”) Priestly subgroup in the
Virashaiva or Lingayat community,
whose members are mainly concentrated
in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
The Virashaivas are a devotional com-
munity who stress the worship of Shiva
as the only real deity; aside from being
essentially monotheistic, they have also
rejected all forms of image worship
except for Shiva’s symbol, the linga. The
Virashaivas were founded by the poet-
saint Basavanna, partly in rebellion
against the prevailing caste system, and
he created the jangamas as a parallel
priesthood to care for his community’s
members. The major function of the
jangamas is to officiate at lifecycle cere-
monies for the members of the commu-
nity, such as birth, coming-of-age,
marriage, and death. Jangamas may be
married and raise families, but this
Virashaiva subcommunity also serves as
the major source of recruits for the celi-
bate Virashaiva monks (viraktas), who
have the highest status as religious lead-
ers in the community.
Janmashtami
Festival on the eighth day (ashtami)
of the dark (waning) half of the lunar
month of Bhadrapada (August–
September), which is celebrated as the
god Krishna’s birthday. As with allJaratkaru
holidays connected with Krishna, this
festival is particularly observed in the
Braj region, where Krishna is sup-
posed to have lived, although it is also
celebrated throughout the country.
Devotees (bhakta) often stay up late
into the night, since Krishna is said to
have been born at midnight, and the
observances are often punctuated with
singing, chanting, parades, and dramas
enacting events in Krishna’s life. It is
during the month around Janmashtami
that the dramas known as the Krishna
lilas are presented in the town of
Brindavan, traditionally believed to
have been Krishna’s childhood home.
According to tradition, Krishna is the
eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. He
is born in a prison in the city of Mathura
in which his parents are held by Devaki’s
brother, the wicked king Kamsa. Kamsa
has imprisoned the pair in an attempt to
thwart the prophecy that he will be
killed by his sister Devaki’s eighth son.
Kamsa has killed all of Devaki’s older
children at birth and intends to do the
same with Krishna, but when Krishna is
born wondrous things begin to happen:
the jailers fall into a deep sleep, the
locked prison doors miraculously
open, and Vasudeva is able to spirit the
infant out of the prison to the home of
the couple who will become his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. Vasudeva
returns that night, bearing Yashoda’s
new-born baby girl, who is really the
goddess Bhadrakali in disguise. The
next morning Kamsa kills the child by
dashing her against a stone, but from
the body arises a fearsome form of the
Goddess, who taunts Kamsa by telling
him that the person who will slay him
has already escaped.
Japa
(“muttering,” “whispering”) Individual
recitation, usually the repeated utter-
ance of a particular mantra or divine
name(s), often while using a string of
beads (mala) to perform a definite num-
ber of such repetitions. Such recitation
is usually performed as an individual
religious act, in a tone of voice audible
to the reciter but not others who may be
present. Japa is a particularly important
practice in Hindu traditions stressing
the benefits of reciting the divine
name—such repetitions are believed to
have gradual spiritual benefits. Japa is
particularly stressed in the Gaudiya
Vaishnavas community founded by the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, where public
recitation of the divine name is an
important part of religious life.
Jaratkarava Artabhaga
One of the sage Yajnavalkya’s interview-
ers in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad,
one of the earliest of the Upanishads.
The third chapter of this upanishad
presents a series of questioners, each
trying to test Yajnavalkya’s assertion that
he is the best brahmin of all. Artabhaga
finally questions Yajnavalkya about the
human sense faculties and their realms
of action, and eventually asks what hap-
pens to a person after death. Yajnavalkya
draws him aside in private, and talks to
him about karma (“action”), in what
is generally regarded as the oldest
reference to this fundamental Indian
religious idea.
Jaratkaru
In Hindu mythology, a sage famous not
only for his asceticism and knowledge
but also because he illustrates the
importance of male children in Hindu
culture. Jaratkaru is a lifelong ascetic
with no intention of marrying until he
has a vision of his ancestors suspended
over one of the hells by a grass rope,
through which a rat (time personified) is
gradually gnawing. His ancestors inform
Jaratkaru that his failure to have a son
means that the lineage will end with
him, along with the rites performed for
the deceased in that lineage, and that
they will then fall into hell. To forestall
this disaster, they instruct Jaratkaru to
marry and beget a son.
Jaratkaru is initially hostile to this
idea, but later specifies that if a woman
[[315]]
Jat
also named Jaratkaru is found and given
to him as alms, he will marry her. His
conditions eventually reaches the Naga
(snake) king Vasuki, who has a sister by
this name. The marriage is performed
under the condition that if she displeases
Jaratkaru, he will leave her. Given
Jaratkaru’s ascetic past, it is not surpris-
ing that things did not work out between
them. After being married several
months, his wife has the dilemma of
allowing Jaratkaru to sleep past sunset,
which will make him late for his evening
prayers, or to wake him and risk his dis-
pleasure. She chooses the latter;
Jaratkaru is displeased with her and
leaves despite her entreaties. Some time
later the wife Jaratkaru gives birth to a
son, Astika, and thus the sage’s obliga-
tions are fulfilled.
Jat
One of the hundreds of subgroups of
traditional Indian society known as jatis
(“birth”). Each jati was associated
with—and held a monopoly over—a
particular occupation, and that occupa-
tion determined the social status of the
jati’s members; this system led to the
modern caste system. The Jats are a
northern Indian jati whose members are
spread through many of the states of
northern India, particularly Haryana,
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.
In the Punjab the Jats are evenly split
between Hindus and Sikhs, but in other
areas the community is solidly Hindu.
The Jats’ hereditary occupation is farm-
ing, and they are often described as
tough and resilient peasants; these qual-
ities have also made them superior sol-
diers, both in the service of the British
Empire and in independent India.
Jata
A long matted lock of hair. Ascetics
often wear their hair in jatas for a num-
ber of religious and symbolic reasons.
On one level, the uncut hair is a symbol
of renunciation; its unkempt, matted
quality demonstrates the ascetic’s
[[316]]

distance from worldly concerns with
order and propriety. On another level,
ascetics wear jatas in imitation of the
god Shiva, the paradigmatic ascetic,
who is always portrayed wearing his hair
in matted locks. Although jatas are most
commonly worn by devotees (bhakta)
of Shiva, some strict renunciants who
are devotees of the god Vishnu also
favor this hairstyle. Finally, from a non-
religious perspective, jatas are simply a
very low-maintenance hairstyle. They
are usually rubbed with wood ash to
keep them relatively neat; as the hair
grows the jatas simply become longer,
and in many cases they can be neatly
twisted into a crown, or jatamakuta, on
the top of the head.
Jatakarma Samskara
The fourth of the traditional life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras). The first three
were to be performed before and during
pregnancy, while the jatakarma sam-
skara was to be performed immediately
after the birth. This ceremony had sev-
eral elements, but the most prominent
were uttering the word “vak” (“speech,”
a synonym for Saraswati) into the
child’s ear and feeding the child honey,
ghee, and other items believed to bring
good luck. This samskara is seldom per-
formed in modern times, although there
are many other rites connected with
birth that are intended to protect the
mother and child and to kindle the
child’s potential.
Jatamakuta
A crown (makuta) made of matted locks
of hair (jata) twisted together and
bound on top of the head. In Hindu
iconography the jatamakuta is most
closely associated with the god Shiva,
who is the paradigmatic ascetic and
always wears his hair in matted locks. In
modern times, the jatamakuta is still a
hairstyle associated with many ascetics,
both Shaiva and Vaishnava.Jatra
An ascetic in Haridwar with his hair in matted locks (jata).
This hairstyle marks the wearer as a person who is detached from worldly concerns.
Jatayu
A virtuous vulture in the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics.
When Rama’s wife Sita is kidnapped by
the demon-king Ravana and is being
spirited away in Ravana’s aerial chariot,
Jatayu makes a valiant effort to rescue
her. In his battle with Ravana, Jatayu’s
wings are cut off; the force of his subse-
quent fall left him near death. With his
dying breaths he informs Rama and
Rama’s brother Lakshmana of what has
happened, and identifies Ravana as
Sita’s kidnapper. Although Jatayu fails to
rescue Sita, he is critical to the plot of the
epic because he gives Rama the crucial
information he needs to begin to
searching for her.
Jati
(“birth”) A traditional social subgroup in
Indian society. There were hundreds of
these groups, considered exogamous
because strict taboos existed against
marrying outside one’s jati—people
belonging to different jatis were looked
upon as different “species” of people.
Jatis were usually defined by the sub-
group’s traditional occupation, which
they and they alone had the right to
practice. The jatis were hierarchically
arranged in society, based on the per-
ceived purity or impurity (ashaucha) of
their occupations, and this hierarchy
formed the basis for the traditional
Hindu social structure known as the
caste system.
Jatra
Vernacular form of the Sanskrit word
yatra (“journey”). The word yatra is
most often used to describe journeys to
far-away places, whereas jatra is used to
denote visits to spots within the imme-
diate region.
[[317]]
Jauhar
Jauhar
A mass suicide in which women and
children threw themselves on a bonfire
to protect the family from dishonor
when the men were defeated or killed in
battle. Jauhar was considered the
women’s counterpart to death in com-
bat. If their husbands and fathers were
heavily outnumbered and faced certain
death in battle, women would perform a
mass suicide after the men left their
fortresses. This phenomenon was most
closely associated with the desert state
of Rajasthan, which has strong martial
traditions and a great stress on the
importance of family honor. It is partic-
ularly associated with the Rajasthani
city of Chittorgarh, where jauhars
occurred in 1303, 1535, and 1568.
Jaya
In Hindu mythology, one of the gate-
keepers of the god Vishnu’s heavenly
abode, Vaikuntha, who, with his brother
Vijaya, is cursed to be born three times
as a demon (asura) and to be killed each
time by Vishnu. The sage Sanaka places
this curse on them when they prevent
him from seeing Vishnu. In their first
birth the two are born as Hiranyaksha
and Hiranyakashipu, who are killed by
the Boar avatar and the Man-Lion
avatar respectively. In their second
incarnation they are born as Ravana
and Kumbhakarna, who are both killed
by Vishnu’s Rama avatar. In their final
birth they incarnate as Shisupala and
Dantavaktra and are killed by Vishnu’s
Krishna avatar. After the conditions of
the curse have been fulfilled, they return
to their duties as Vishnu’s gatekeepers.
Jayadeva
(12th c.) Poet and author of the
Gitagovinda, a lyric devotional poem
that uses the separation and eventual
reunion of the lovers Krishna and
Radha as a metaphor for the union of
the human soul with God. According to
tradition, Jayadeva lived at the temple of
the god Jagannath in the city of Puri,
[[318]]

where his wife Padmavati was a dancer.
She is said to have been the first to
dance to Jayadeva’s songs as an offering
to Jagannath, and the Gitagovinda has
been sung and danced as a regular part
of temple worship up to the present
time. For further information see
Barbara Stoller Miller (ed. and trans.),
The Love Song of the Dark Lord, 1977.
Jayadratha
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Jayadratha is a king
who is married to the princess Dussala.
Dussala is the only sister of the
Kauravas, a group of one hundred
brothers who are the epic’s antagonists.
Jayadratha once sought the hand of
Draupadi, and because of his bitterness
at having lost her to the warrior Arjuna,
he opposes Arjuna and his brothers, the
Pandavas, for the rest of his life. During
the Mahabharata war between the
Pandavas and the Kauravas, Jayadratha
takes the side of the Kauravas and is
eventually killed by Arjuna. At
Jayadratha’s birth a celestial voice has
prophesied that the head of the person
who causes Jayadratha’s head to fall to
earth will split into a hundred pieces.
Mindful of this, Arjuna, a peerless
archer, cuts off Jayadratha’s head with an
arrow in such a way that it lands in the
lap of Jayadratha’s father, Brhatkaya.
Brhatkaya is so startled that he allows
the head to fall from his lap to the
ground, and his own head breaks into a
hundred pieces.
Jaya Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Magh (January–
February). As are all eleventh-day obser-
vances, this festival is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu, on this day particu-
larly in his form as Krishna. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites,
usually involving fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance:Jimutavahana
faithfully observing the “jaya,” or
“victory,” festival is said to ensure that
one’s desired goal will be attained.who has been brought into the pantheon
of gods as an avatar, or incarnation, of
the god Shiva.
JayapalaJhanki
(d. 1001) One of the last kings of the
Pratiharas, a northern Indian dynasty
whose capital was in Kanyakubja on the
Ganges River. By Jayapala’s time the
divided Hindu kingdoms in northern
India were being threatened by the
Turkish emirs, especially Mahmud of
Ghazni, who had settled in modern-day
Afghanistan. Jayapala was defeated and
captured in battle with Mahmud and
subsequently committed suicide; a
short time later, Jayapala’s son
Anandapala suffered a crushing defeat,
leaving a nearly complete collapse of
power in northern India. Because of this
absence of any effective opposition,
Mahmud was able to indulge in almost
yearly campaigns of pillage and plunder.(“glimpse”) A momentary “glimpse” of
the divine, in which the devotee (bhakta)
gains momentary access to the world of
the gods. Jhankis are most often con-
veyed through the performing arts:
through the mental images created
when devotional poetry is read, recited,
or sung, or through the images presented
in religious dance, drama, or film.
During these momentary encounters,
the devotee comes briefly into the pres-
ence of the deity, sharing the deity’s
world. This stress on the opportunity to
experience a brief physical presence in
the deity’s world is particularly strong in
the Vaishnava devotionalism connected
with the gods Krishna and Rama.
Worship of these deities often stresses
visualization of the deity’s life and every-
day actions as a way for devotees to gain
access to that divine world. Devotees of
both deities have created plays, or lilas,
to aid them in this process: for Rama,
they are the Ram Lilas, which are per-
formed throughout India during the
autumn festival season, and for Krishna,
they are the Krishna Lilas, performed
during the annual monsoon season in
Brindavan, Krishna’s childhood home.
Jayarashi
(7th c.?) Author of the Tattvopaplavasimha,
one of the only surviving texts of the
materialist philosophical school. One
of the philosophical peculiarities of
the materialist school was that they
accepted only perception (pratyaksha)
as a reliable pramana, or means
by which people can gain true and
accurate knowledge. In his text,
Jayarashi argued against the reliability of
inference (anumana) as one of the
pramanas by refuting the concept of
cause and effect. To make an inference,
such as inferring the result an action
will bring in the future based on the
result it brought in the past, one
must believe that the cause-and-effect
model is reliable.
Jejuri
Town in the Pune district of the central
Indian state of Maharashtra, about forty
miles south and east of the city of Pune.
Jejuri is primarily noted as the site of the
primary temple to Khandoba, an
important Maharashtrian regional deity
Jimutavahana
(early 12th c.) Author of the Dayabhaga,
a legal text primarily concerned with
inheritance, partition, and the division
of property. It eventually became the pri-
mary legal authority for the Bengal cul-
tural region; areas outside Bengal were
usually governed by a different legal text,
the Mitakshara . One of the major differ-
ences between these texts concerns the
nature of inheritance. The Mitakshara
stresses inheritance by survivorship, in
which only living males can inherit prop-
erty, whereas the Dayabhaga stresses
inheritance by succession, in which a
dead man’s heirs can inherit in his name.
[[319]]
Jiva
Jiva
(“life”) In philosophical and Vaishnava
(devotees of the god Vishnu) discussion,
jiva is the name used for the embodied
soul of a human being. In a more
general sense, the word can refer to
any living being.
Jivacchraddha
(“Shraddha for a living [person]”) A
particular type of shraddha, or memor-
ial service for the dead, although in
this case it is performed for a person
who is still living. In many cases, a
person performs the Jivacchraddha for
himself if he has no sons to fulfill the
responsibility or if he suspects that
the rite may not be performed properly
after his death. The person performing
this rite makes a small figure of sacred
kusha grass, representing the person for
whom the shraddha is being performed,
and then proceeds with the normal
shraddha ceremony.
Jivanmukta
In Indian philosophy, a person who has
attained final liberation of the soul while
still living (jivanmukti) and who contin-
ues to live in a state of liberation. The
concept of the jivanmukta is essential in
many branches of Advaita Vedanta, one
of the six schools of classical Indian phi-
losophy. The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality known as Brahman lies
behind all things, and that all things are
merely differing forms of that reality. For
Advaita proponents, the problem of
human bondage is that human beings,
blinded by avidya or mistaken under-
standing, do not recognize this ultimate
unity, but mistakenly persist in seeing
the world as made up of separate and
diverse things. The possibility of attain-
ing jivanmukta status is essential to the
Advaita school because it supports their
belief that bondage and liberation are
attained not by doing or becoming any-
thing, but rather by replacing a mistaken
[[320]]

understanding with a correct one. After
this has happened one will continue
to live, but because of the radical change
in consciousness one’s life will never
be the same.
Jivanmukti
(“liberation while living”) In later Indian
philosophy, the notion that one can
attain final liberation of the soul while
still living and continue to live after that
in a liberated state. The jivanmukta
(one who is liberated while still living) is
an important claim for many of the sub-
schools of Advaita Vedanta, one of the
six schools of classical Indian philoso-
phy. The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality known as Brahman lies behind
all things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of that reality. For
Advaita proponents, the problem of
human bondage is that human beings,
blinded by avidya or mistaken under-
standing, do not recognize this ultimate
unity. Liberation is not attained by
“doing” anything or by becoming some-
thing that one is not, but by realizing
what has always been the case, and thus
exchanging a mistaken understanding
for a correct one. Although this cogni-
tion forever changes how a person per-
ceives the world, it brings no ontological
changes, meaning that on a physical
level one continues to exist as before,
until the karma that has created one’s
present body is exhausted. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara and His
Pupils, 1981.
Jnana
In Indian philosophical thought, a
word with different meanings in
different contexts. The word jnana is
derived from the verb “to know,” and
one of its meanings, at least in a
perceptual context, is “awareness.” In a
more abstract sense it stands for what
it means to truly “know” something;Jnaneshvar
along with karmamarga and the
bhaktimarga, the jnanamarga is one of
the paths to liberation of the soul
mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. In this
latter context, an appropriate transla-
tion might be “wisdom” or “realization,”
since this is not the sort of “knowledge”
that comes from reading a book or
receiving instruction, but instead
reflects profound understanding gained
through great effort.
Jnanakarmasamucchaya
(“combination of awareness and
action”) Religious discipline for ending
the bondage and reincarnation (sam-
sara) of the soul, which was advocated
by members of the bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) philosophical
school. According to this school, correct
awareness (jnana) and ritual action
(karma) were both necessary elements
in gaining final liberation of the soul.
The preparatory step was to perform
meritorious ritual actions—fasting
(upavasa), worship, and pilgrimage—to
weaken one’s negative karmic disposi-
tions, such as greed, anger, and igno-
rance. These weakened dispositions
were later completely destroyed through
meditation. The assumptions behind
this path were attacked by other philo-
sophical schools, particularly the
Advaita Vedanta school, which mini-
mized the value of ritual action and
claimed that final liberation came from
awareness alone.
Jnanamarga
(“Path of Realization”) One of
Hinduism’s three generally accepted
paths to gain final liberation of the soul,
along with the Path of Devotion (bhak-
timarga) and the Path of Action (kar-
mamarga). While the bhaktimarga
stresses devotion to God and the kar-
mamarga emphasizes selfless action in
the world, the jnanamarga stresses real-
izing the ultimate identity of one’s indi-
vidual Self (atman) and Ultimate Reality
(Brahman). This realization is usually
described as coming in a flash of insight,
which may take years of effort to attain
but which fundamentally shifts one’s
perspective on the world.
Jnana (“knowledge”) Mudra
A particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra) in Indian dance, sculpture,
and ritual. In the jnana mudra, the tips
of the thumb and index finger are touch-
ing, with the palm and hand held across
the region of the heart. As its name
clearly shows, it is used to indicate a
profound understanding of the basic
workings of the universe.
Jnanasambandhar
Honorific epithet for the Nayanar poet-
saint Sambandar. See Sambandar.
Jnanendriya
(“organ of awareness”) In Indian philos-
ophy, jnanendriya refers to any of the
sense organs, traditionally considered to
be the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin.
Jnaneshvar
(1275–1296?) Poet and saint who is the
first great figure in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community centered around
the worship of the Hindu god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur in the
modern
state
of
Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Jnaneshvar was
an outcaste brahmin. He incurred this
penalty because his father was a lapsed
ascetic—he left his wife to become an
ascetic, only to rejoin his family at his
guru’s command. Jnaneshvar came
from a very religious family: His sister
Muktibai is revered by the Varkaris in
her own right, and his elder brother
Nivrttinath is supposed to have been a
“spiritual grandson” of the great ascetic
Gorakhnath. Varkari tradition makes
clear that Jnaneshvar lived much of his
life in the town of Alandi, but the truth
of the accounts of many events associated
with his life is questionable—for exam-
ple, he is said to have caused a buffalo to
[[321]]
Jnaneshvari
recite the sacred text known as the Veda
in order to humble the pride of the local
brahmin priests. Jnaneshvar’s greatest
work was the Jnaneshvari, a Marathi-
language commentary on the Bhagavad
Gita, one of the most influential Hindu
religious texts. He is also famous for his
songs in praise of Vithoba, which the
Varkaris still sing today. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; and Justin Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories of
Indian Saints, 1982.
Jnaneshvari
Marathi-language commentary on the
Bhagavad Gita, one of the most influen-
tial Hindu religious texts. The
Jnaneshvari was composed by the
Maharashtrian poet-saint Jnaneshvar,
whose intentions in writing it were to
make the Bhagavad Gita accessible to
the common people, who were not able
to read the text in the original Sanskrit,
and to give his own learned interpreta-
tion of the text’s contents. This emphasis
on giving ordinary people full access to
religious life was one of the consistent
themes in the (devotional) bhakti move-
ment and, like many other figures,
Jnaneshvar is reported to have faced
considerable opposition from the brah-
min priests, who thought that such
advanced teachings should not be
revealed to the common public.
Jogi
(variant of yogi, “adept”) An epithet for
various sorts of ascetics. It often refers
to the Nathpanthis, followers of the
teacher Gorakhnath. Their designation
as “jogis” comes from the fact that the
practice of yoga, particularly hatha
yoga, is one of the major emphases in
their religious life. The term may also
refer to the Aghoris.
Joking Relationships
Within the traditional Hindu joint family,
the types of relationships within a single
generation differ markedly according to
[[322]]

family status, particularly among the
family’s adult brothers and their wives.
As the eventual head of the family, the
oldest brother is usually portrayed as a
serious and grave authority figure,
toward whom everyone must act with
respect. The eldest brother’s wife is also
given considerable respect, but she is
also said to share a “joking relationship”
with her husband’s younger brothers, as
do all wives with their husband’s
younger brothers. Whereas women are
expected to behave decorously toward
relatives with higher status, joking rela-
tionships have much greater freedom of
expression. These are usually character-
ized as full of banter and casual conver-
sation that would be inappropriate with
a person of higher status.
Jones, Sir William
(1746–1794) Founder of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal and one of the fathers
of modern Indology. Jones came to
Calcutta from England in 1783 as a
Supreme Court judge during the gover-
norship of Warren Hastings, considered
one of the founders of the British
Empire in India. He was employed by
the East India Company, who, in its pur-
suit of trade and profit, acquired politi-
cal power over regions of India. Jones
immediately applied himself to the
study of Sanskrit, in part to discover the
particulars of traditional Hindu law,
since the East India Company’s general
policy was to allow different religious
communities to be governed by their
own traditional laws. Jones was a lin-
guistic genius who had mastered the
current and classical European lan-
guages, as well as Persian. He immedi-
ately recognized Sanskrit as a distant
relative of Greek and Latin, and through
his influence the serious study of
Sanskrit texts began. From a legal per-
spective, his most important work was a
translation of the laws of Manu (Manu
Smrti). This was one of the most impor-
tant texts in the dharma literature and
prescribed ideal rules and regulations
for all sorts of human conduct. ThisJuna (“Old”) Akhara
translation was intended to give the
British some idea of classical Hindu
law, but they failed to realize that
this text was composed not as a legal
manual but as a guide to religious
life. Jones died at age forty-eight from
an inflammation of the liver. His transla-
tion was published posthumously.
Joshimath
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayas on the banks of the
Alakananda River, in the Chamoli
district of the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Joshimath is the location of the Jyotir
math, one of the four maths, or
dwelling places for ascetics, supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The Jyotir math is
home to Dashanami Sanyasis, or twice-
born renunciant ascetics. According to
local legend, the Jyotir Math is the place
where Shankaracharya attained the ulti-
mate realization and composed his
commentaries on the Hindu scriptures.
Aside from the Jyotir math, Joshimath is
famous for its connection to a temple
dedicated to Narasimha, the god
Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar. This temple
was also reportedly established by
Shankaracharya and contains several
stunning sculptural images. Joshimath
is an important transit point on the
road to the temple at Badrinath, and
it is also the winter seat of Badrinath’s
presiding deity, where he (symbolically
represented by a traveling image)
resides and is worshiped during the
winter months, when Badrinath
becomes snowbound and inaccessible.
See also Narasimha avatar.
Juggernaut
Anglicized form of Jagannath, who is
the presiding deity of the temple with
the same name in the eastern Indian city
of Puri. The word “juggernaut,” which in
general English usage refers to anything
that requires blind devotion or horrible
sacrifice, comes from a widespread
myth surrounding the procession of
Jagannath, or Juggernaut, and his two
siblings around Puri during the Rath
Yatra each summer. The cars that carry
them in the procession are enormous—
Jagannath’s measures forty-five feet high
and thirty feet wide, and travels on six-
teen wheels that are seven feet high—
and are drawn by ropes pulled by
hundreds of people. One of the staple
fictions of British colonial lore described
Jagannath’s frenzied devotees (bhakta)
committing suicide by throwing them-
selves under the car’s wheels, in order to
die in the sight of the god. Despite the
legendary status of such stories, suicides
of this sort were in fact extremely
uncommon: most of those who died
under the wheels of the Juggernaut pro-
cession were pulling the ropes when
they lost their footing, fell into the cars’
path, and were prevented from escaping
by the crushing crowds.
Juna (“Old”) Akhara
Name of one of seven subgroups of the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva. The sub-
groups are known as akharas and are
similar to regiments of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Nagas were primarily mercenary sol-
diers but were also active in merchan-
dise trading; neither of these
characteristics applies in contemporary
times. Members of the Juna Akhara
revere the sage Dattatreya as their “tute-
lary deity,” the primary deity from
which they learn; each of the akharas
have different tutelary deities. Some
accounts say Bhairava was the patron
deity of the Juna Akhara in earlier times,
which would explain the fact that the
group is also known as the Bhairava
Akhara. The literal meaning of the pre-
sent name and its connection with
Bhairava imply that it is very old. In con-
temporary times it is a large organiza-
tion found only in northern India. In
some places it is given low status for
admitting members from the lower
social classes.
[[323]]
Jupiter
Up until the middle of the present cen-
tury, the Juna Akhara marched with the
Niranjani Akhara in the bathing (snana)
processions during the Kumbha Mela and
was thus considered a subsidiary part of
that akhara. For most of this century the
Junas were upset that they held subordi-
nate status despite the fact that they have
far more members than any other akhara.
The Junas began their attempt to gain the
status of a separate procession with the
[[1903]]
 Haridwar Kumbha Mela, but were
not accorded this position until 1962. The
akharas agreed that during a Haridwar
Kumbha Mela, the Junas would lead the
Sanyasi processions for the bathing on the
festival of Shivaratri. However, the
Niranjanis would be first for the other two
major bathing days—the new moon in
Chaitra and the Kumbha bath on April 14.
This arrangement broke down at the 1998
Kumbha Mela in Haridwar, when the Junas
demanded that they be allowed to go first
at the Chaitra bath as well, based on their
status as the largest akhara. On the day of
the second bath, this disagreement erupt-
ed into a full-scale riot between ascetic
groups and police in which many people
were hurt. There was great worry that such
violence would recur on the main bathing
day, but the day came off without incident
when the Juna Akhara boycotted the
bathing processions.
Jupiter
In Hindu astrology, a planet associated
with knowledge, power, and good charac-
ter. In Sanskrit, Jupiter’s name is guru,
and its importance in Hindu astrology
reflects the importance of the guru or reli-
gious figure in Hindu religious life. Jupiter
is the most powerful of the benevolent
planets—the others are the sun, moon,
Mercury, and Venus—although for each
person Jupiter’s powers vary according to
its place in the natal horoscope, or align-
ment of the heavenly bodies at the time of
birth, and the influence of friendly or
hostile planets. During the week, Jupiter
presides over Thursday which, because of
the planet’s astrological powers, is consid-
ered an auspicious, or lucky, day.
[[324]]

Jutha
In its most general sense, jutha refers
to any food that has come into contact
with saliva. Such contact is believed to ren-
der that food impure and unfit
for anyone else to eat. Since eating is tradi-
tionally done with one’s fingers, any food
on one’s plate after one has begun to eat is
considered contaminated by association,
even if it has not yet been taken into one’s
mouth. As with all bodily fluids, saliva is
considered particularly impure, a sub-
stance that “imprints” food with the nature
of the person eating it. Eating food from
the same plate is a sign of extreme close-
ness—most commonly done by husband
and wife, but also by very close friends.
Conversely, eating another’s person’s left-
overs is a sign of extreme status differ-
ence—it is done only by people who are
desperately poor, by disciples as a sign of
devotion to their guru or religious leader,
or by devotees (bhakta) receiving prasad
or sanctified food, the vehicle for grace
from their chosen deity.
Jwalamukhi
(“flame mouth”) Presiding deity of the
Jwalamukhi shrine in the state of
Himachal Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. According to the site’s
mythic charter, Jwalamukhi is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites sacred to
the goddess that spreads throughout the
Indian subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth, tak-
ing form there as a different goddess; in the
case of Jwalamukhi the body part was Sati’s
tongue. The human tongue is an extreme-
ly powerful part of the body—connected
with speech, eating, and sex—and thus
Jwalamukhi is considered a very powerful
shrine. The cave containing the shrine has
a small vent of natural gas, which has been
lit for as long as people can remember. This
flame is believed to be a self-manifested
(svayambhu) form of the Goddess, here in
the form of her tongue. For further infor-
mation see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986; and Kathleen Erndl,
Victory To The Mother, 1993. See also pitha.Jyotirlinga
The Mahakaleshvar Temple in the city of Ujjain. This site contains one of the twelve jyotirlingas,
pillar-shaped images that mark places where the god Shiva is believed to have appeared in a shaft of light.
Jyeshth
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Jyeshth is the third month
in the lunar year, usually falling in
May–June. This is considered the first
month in the hot season: The weather in
this month is scorchingly hot and bone
dry. The major holidays in Jyeshth are
Achala Ekadashi, Savitri Puja, Ganga
Dashahara, and Nirjala Ekadashi.
Jyotirlinga
(“linga of light”) In several different
mythic sources, the first manifestation
of the god Shiva is described as a giant
[[325]]
Jyotir Math
pillar of fire, which stretches above the
heavens and below the earth. The gods
Brahma and Vishnu try to find this pil-
lar’s top and bottom but cannot. When
they admit their failure, the figure of
Shiva emerges from the pillar of light
and blesses them. Shiva’s devotees
(bhakta) believe that there are twelve
sites in India where this jyotirlinga came
down to earth; these twelve sites are
deemed extraordinarily holy, and at
each of them Shiva is believed to be
uniquely present. At each of these sites
the primary image is a linga, the pillar-
shaped image that is a symbolic form of
Shiva. Each of these lingas is considered
a different manifestation of Shiva, and
these twelve sites each take the name of
the linga that is their presiding deity.
The other eleven manifestations of
Shiva and their locations are: Somnath
and Nageshvar in the state of Gujarat;
Kedarnath in the Himalaya Mountains;
Vishvanath in the city of Benares;
Vaidyanath in the state of Bihar;
Mahakaleshvar in the central Indian
city of Ujjain; Omkareshvar in the state
of Madhya Pradesh; Bhimashankar,
Ghrneshvar, and Tryambakeshvar in
the state of Maharashtra; and
Rameshvar in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Jyotir Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
traditionally believed to have been
established by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya; the others are the
Sharada math, Shringeri math, and
Govardhan math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Jyotir math is
in the northern quarter, in the town of
Joshimath in the state of Uttar Pradesh,
high in the Himalaya Mountains.
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as
the founder of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
the most prestigious Hindu ascetic
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)
ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and are separated into ten divi-
sions, each with a different name. These
[[326]]

ten divisions are organized into four
larger groups—Anandawara, Bhogawara,
Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—each of which
has two or three of the ten divisions, and
each of which is associated with one of the
four sacred centers. Of these, the Jyotir
math is associated with the Anandawara
group of the Dashanamis.
Jyotisha
In its most general usage, the word
jyotisha refers to astrology. The word
itself is derived from jyotis (“light,” and
by extension the heavenly bodies) and is
concerned with the movement of the
celestial bodies, their varying configura-
tions, and the divisions of time that are
derived from them. This attention to the
heavens is a very old cultural concern,
for jyotisha is one of the six Vedangas,
the auxiliary branches of knowledge
connected with the sacred scriptures
known as the Vedas. As one of the
Vedangas, jyotisha was concerned with
identifying appropriate days and times
to perform Vedic sacrifices.
Even in modern times, many tradi-
tional Hindus take astrology very seri-
ously, based on the assumption that the
results of one’s previous karma lead one
to be born at a particular moment. One’s
natal horoscope, or the positioning of
the celestial bodies at the time of birth,
thus provides a karmic “itinerary” indi-
cating where one has been and what one
might expect in the future. People fre-
quently consider astrology when mak-
ing important decisions, particularly in
arranging marriages—to determine the
couple’s compatibility, to see whether
any trouble is lurking ahead, and to
arrange an auspicious or lucky time for
the ceremony itself. In the same way,
some Hindus will consult an astrologer
before beginning any important under-
taking, to be sure that the work will
begin at an auspicious time and will
therefore be more likely to succeed.
The basic principles of Indian astrol-
ogy are very similar to those of Western
astrology. The zodiac signs are nearly
identical. However, the two systemsJyotisha
have a different method for determining
each sign’s starting point, causing some
discrepancies between the two systems.
Aside from the sun, moon, and five visi-
ble planets in Western astrology, Indian
astrology has two additional planets,
Rahu and Ketu, which are both consid-
ered inauspicious and malevolent. In
addition to the twelve signs of the solar
zodiac, Indian astrology also has a lunar
zodiac with twenty-seven “lunar man-
sions” (nakshatras), each of which has
particular qualities. Although at the
most basic level astrological reckoning
is fairly simple, it can quickly become
highly complex and is thus generally left
to professional astrologers. This is still a
viable profession throughout much of
India, since the generally accepted
belief that some times are auspicious
and others inauspicious means that
ordinary people will hire specialists to
keep them informed of these times.

Kabandha
## K
Kabandha
(“headless trunk”) A demon in the
Ramayana (the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics) who attacks the god-king
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, and
Rama’s brother Lakshmana. In a previ-
ous life Kabandha has been a king of the
gandharvas, or celestial musicians; but
in a battle with the god Indra,
Kabandha’s head is pushed down into
his body. When Kabandha requests
some means by which he can eat, Indra
places a mouth in Kabandha’s belly.
Indra tells him that the curse will be
broken when Rama and Lakshmana cut
off his arms.
As Rama and Lakshmana travel
through a forest, searching for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, they are set upon
by Kabandha, who grabs each of them in
one of his long arms. Finding they could
not escape, Rama and Lakshmana each
slash off one of his arms, and with his
dying breaths Kabandha asks the broth-
ers to burn his body. As the body is
burning, the gandharva king arises from
the fire in his previous form and advises
the brothers to seek help from the mon-
key-king Sugriva.
Kabir
(mid-15th c.?) A poet who is widely
regarded as one of the greatest northern
Indian religious figures. Kabir is among
a group of central and northern Indian
poet-saints known as Sants who shared
several tendencies: emphasis on indi-
vidualized, interior religion leading to a
personal experience of the divine; dis-
dain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of the
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore
[[328]]

hierarchical distinctions between
castes. Kabir strongly adhered to these
beliefs—in his writings he uncompro-
misingly attacks any sort of religious
practice based on habit or tradition,
including asceticism, special modes of
dress, fasting (upavasa), image worship,
caste, and scripture.
In his poetry, Kabir identifies himself
as belonging to a caste of weavers (julaha),
and according to tradition he supported
himself through this occupation. Kabir’s
history makes it difficult to link him with
a particular religion. In Arabic, the name
Kabir (“Great”) is one of the names given
to Allah in the Qur’an, identifying him as
a Muslim. However, his poetry reveals
his great knowledge of Hindu religious
life. It is generally believed that the
members of Kabir’s julaha community
were recent converts to Islam who had
not yet been fully assimilated. Kabir’s
poetry, however, clearly shows that he
considered himself neither Hindu nor
Muslim. Part of Kabir’s popularity
undoubtedly stems from his blunt,
passionate affirmation that real
religious attainment is only gained by
internal, individual experience of the
divine, to which he gives the name Ram.
This is not the god-king who is the hero
of the Ramayana, but a name for the
indescribable,
absolute
Supreme
Reality. Both of these emphases reflect
the influence of the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who also stressed internal
experience and yoga.
In one of his songs, Kabir once boasted
that he had been so absorbed in the
divine that he had never put pen to
paper. His songs remain popular even
today, and many of his shorter epigrams
have become proverbial sayings. Kabir’s
oldest attested poetry survives in three
major collections: one in the Adigranth,
the Sikh scripture also known as the
“Primal Book”; one collected by the
Dadupanth, the religious organization
founded by the Sant poet-saint Dadu;
and the Bijak, which was compiled by
the Kabirpanth, a religious community
that claimed Kabir as its guru (religious
preceptor). The significant differencesKaikeyi
among these collections indicate that
they have no single source. For further
information see Charlotte Vaudeville
(trans.), Kabir, 1974; Linda Hess and
Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak of
Kabir, 1983; John S. Hawley and Mark
Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs of the
Saints of India, 1988; Nirmal Dass, Songs
of Kabir from the Adi Granth, 1991; and
David Lorenzen, Kabir Legends and
Ananta-Das’s Kabir Parachai, 1991.
Kabirpanth
Religious community whose members
are followers of the northern Indian
poet-saint Kabir. Some Kabirpanthis are
ascetics, and some are householders.
The group’s most important center is
located in Benares (where Kabir is
believed to have lived) and houses an
ascetic community. Although in his
poetry Kabir rejects ritual, worship, and
reliance on anything but one’s own
unmediated experience—a context
implying the practice of yoga—the
Kabirpanth has taken on all of these
conventional religious trappings. The
community’s sacred text is the Bijak, a
collection of poems and epigrams
attributed to Kabir. Its sacred centers
have pictures of Kabir, who has become
an object of worship. Elaborate rituals
are performed on certain prescribed
days. This situation is ironic because it
appears that many of the practices Kabir
condemned have been adopted by the
community professing to follow his
teachings. Given Kabir’s continual
emphasis on the need for unmediated
personal experience of the divine, the
notion that he would be seen as the
founder of a sect would itself have been
outrageous to him. For further informa-
tion see David Lorenzen, “Traditions of
Non-Caste Hinduism: The Kabir Panth,”
in Contributions to Indian Sociology, Vol.
[[21]]
, No. 2, 1987.
Kadambari
Sanskrit romance novel authored by the
writer and dramatist Bana (7th c.), who
was a contemporary of the northern
Indian emperor Harsha. The love story
between the main characters, a princess
named Kadambari and a prince named
Chandripida, is but one element of the
book’s complex plot. The Kadambari
was left unfinished at Bana’s death. It
gives a detailed picture of Indian life
during Bana’s time.
Kadru
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of the
divine sage Daksha and sister of Vinata.
Kadru gives birth to a line of serpents,
whereas her sister’s children are born as
eagles, the most famous of whom is
Garuda. The well-known hostility
between these species is attributed to a
conflict between Vinata and Kadru: one
day they are arguing about the tail color
of a certain celestial horse, with Vinata
arguing that it is white and Kadru assert-
ing that it is black. The disagreement
becomes more intense until they finally
agree that whoever is wrong will become
a slave to the other. To ensure her victo-
ry, Kadru persuades a number of her
snake children to hang from
the back of the horse. From a distance
the tail appears to be black. (Some of
her children disapprove of such dishon-
esty and refuse to participate. In revenge
Kadru curses them to die in the snake-
killing sacrifice performed by King
Janamjeya.) When Vinata sees the black
snakes, she believes she has been
defeated and serves Kadru under
extremely harsh conditions for many
years. Vinata is finally rescued by her
son Garuda, who discovers the fraud
behind Vinata’s defeat and embarks on
a program of killing snakes that has
never stopped.
Kaikeyi
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kaikeyi is the second
wife of King Dasharatha, the mother of
Bharata, and foster mother to Rama,
the epic’s protagonist. Kaikeyi is directly
responsible for one of the most
[[329]]
Kailas
Mount Kailas, overlooking the Chiu Monastery in Tibet. Kailas is considered to be the mythic
Mount Meru, home of the god Shiva and the center of the universe.
villainous acts in the Ramayana: She
forces Rama into fourteen years of exile
in the forest, a major event in the epic’s
plot. Despite her evil action, she is not
considered an evil person, but rather a
person who acts out of love for her son
yet who is burdened with extremely bad
judgment and bad advice. When
Dasharatha announces that he intends
to anoint Rama as the heir to the throne,
Kaikeyi is as happy as everyone else.
Rama has always respected her as much
as his own mother, Kausalya, and has
treated Bharata as his equal. But as the
day of the ceremony approached,
Kaikeyi’s mind is slowly poisoned by her
maid, Manthara. Manthara convinces
Kaikeyi that after Rama has been
crowned the heir-apparent, she and
Bharata will be treated as little more
than chattel, or objects, if they are
allowed to live at all.
Kaikeyi’s concern for her son leads
her to drastic action. Many years before,
Dasharatha gave Kaikeyi two boons, or
rewards, for her help in winning a great
battle. She has never redeemed these
[[330]]

boons, but now demands that
Dasharatha exile Rama to the forest for
fourteen years and crown Bharata as
ruler in his place. Dasharatha pleads
with Kaikeyi, but she does not change
her mind. He is finally forced to grant
her wish. Kaikeyi’s request brings her
disgrace not only from her husband,
who curses her for separating him from
Rama, but also from her son. Bharata
rebukes Kaikeyi for depriving Rama of
what is rightfully his, and refuses to rule
until Rama orders him to serve in his
place during the exile. The only person
who does not condemn her is Rama,
whom the epic portrays as serenely
happy to obey his parents’ commands,
whatever they might be.
Kailas
Himalayan peak in southwestern Tibet
renowned as a pilgrimage place (tirtha)
for both Hindus and Buddhists. In
Hindu mythology, Kailas is believed to
be Mount Meru, the center of the uni-
verse. It is also believed that the top ofKaivalya
Mount Kailas is the place where the god
Shiva makes his home. For both Hindus
and Buddhists, the central act of pil-
grimage to Kailas is to walk around the
mountain, thus symbolically traversing
the entire earth. The journey begins at
Manasarovar, a lake near the moun-
tain’s base, which in Hindu mythology is
esteemed as the lake of the gods. Many
factors combine to make the sixty-five-
mile circuit an extremely difficult jour-
ney: The area is extremely remote, the
climate is harsh and unforgiving even in
June (the customary pilgrimage time),
and the circuit itself is physically strenu-
ous, with its highest point over 19,000
feet above sea level. Storms can suddenly
arise at any time of the year, and pil-
grims who are unprepared can easily die
of exposure. Given these difficulties, rel-
atively few people perform this pilgrim-
age; it raises the status of those who do.
For many years Chinese prohibitions on
travel in Tibet made it impossible for
people to undertake this pilgrimage.
Since the early 1990s these rules have
been relaxed and small groups of reli-
gious pilgrims are again making the
sacred journey.
Kailasanatha
The largest and most famous of the
rock-cut temples at Ellora in the state of
Maharashtra; the temple is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his form as the “Lord of
Mount Kailas.” The temple was con-
structed late in the eighth century by
kings of the Rashtrakuta dynasty and
completed during the reign of Krishna I.
The Kailasanatha temple is modeled
after other contemporary temples: its
main elements are an outer gateway, an
assembly hall, and a central shrine
(garbhagrha) surrounded by a proces-
sional path (pradakshina) to smaller
shrines. It is set on a high platform base
topped with a ninety-six-foot-high spire
representing Mount Kailas in the
Himalayas and covered with decorative
carving. The amazing point about this
temple is that the entire structure is a
sculpture—workers carved it out of a
single rock outcropping, starting at the
top and working down. It is estimated
that during construction, the builders
had to remove three million cubic feet of
stone from the temple and the excavated
courtyards surrounding it. See also
caves, artificial.
Kaitabha
In Hindu mythology, one of two demons
who attempt to kill the god Brahma (the
other is Madhu). The story is recounted
in several mythic sources, with some
important differences among them. All
versions agree that Madhu and Kaitabha
are born from the god Vishnu’s earwax
during the period of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). As the creation of the world
begins, a lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s
navel. It opens to reveal the creator-god,
Brahma, who is immediately attacked
by Madhu and Kaitabha. In all versions
of the myth, Brahma appeals for help.
Vishnu tricks the demons (who are
strong but not too bright) and slays
them. The difference comes in the deity
to whom Brahma appeals for help. The
story first appears in the mythology of
Vishnu; here Brahma invokes that deity.
Yet this same story also appears in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest mythic
source for the cult of the Mother
Goddess as the supreme divine power.
In this version, Brahma’s hymn of praise
is to the Goddess, who in her form as
Yoganidra (“sleep of yoga”) has lulled
Vishnu into a cosmic stupor, rendering
him unable to come to Brahma’s aid.
Pleased by Brahma’s praise, the Goddess
withdraws her influence over Vishnu; he
awakens and slays the demons.
Kaivalya
(“isolation”) In Samkhya and Yoga, two
of the six schools of Hindu philosophy,
kaivalya is the state of final liberation. A
person who has attained kaivalya has
fully comprehended the difference
between two important principles: the
conscious but inert purusha, which is
identified as the Self, and the active but
[[331]]
Kajari Teej
unconscious prakrti. According to
Samkhya metaphysics, confusion
between these two eternally distinct
principles triggers the evolution of sub-
jective consciousness and the exterior
world, in which the eternal Self becomes
the witness to repeated rebirths. Of the
two schools, Samkhya provides the the-
oretical explanation for bondage and
liberation of the soul, whereas Yoga pro-
vides the method to liberation. The pur-
pose in performing yoga is to help the
person distinguish between these two
principles, removing obstructions to
understanding, particularly the karmic
tendencies rooted in egoism. According
to the Yoga Sutras, the foundational text
for the Yoga school, those who can dis-
tinguish between these two principles
and discern the soul’s identity with the
purusha attain independence from all
external causes, mastery over all states
of being, and omniscience. For further
information see Gerald Larson and Ram
Shankar Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya:
A Dualist Tradition in Indian
Philosophy, 1987; and Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore
(eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Kajari Teej
One of two festivals called Teej. See Teej.
Kala
In Sanskrit and its daughter languages,
a word that can mean both “time” and
“death.” Kala is used as one of the alter-
nate names for the god Yama, the lord of
death and the master of all living beings.
Kalahasti
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh,
about fifty miles east of the town of
Tirupati and 125 miles northwest of the
city of Madras. Kalahasti is famous as
one of the bhutalingas (“elemental lin-
gas”), a network of five southern Indian
sites sacred to the god Shiva. At each of
these sites Shiva is worshiped as a linga,
[[332]]

the pillar-shaped object that is his
symbolic form, and at each site the
linga is believed to be formed from one
of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). Kalahasti’s linga is
associated with the element of wind,
and the manifestation of Shiva there is
Kalahasteshvar, the “Lord of Kalahasti.”
Kalahasti is also one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites throughout
the subcontinent that are sacred to the
Goddess. Each Shakti Pitha marks the
site where a body part of the dismem-
bered goddess Sati fell to earth, taking
form there as a different goddess; in the
case of Kalahasti the body part was Sati’s
left shoulder. Kalahasti’s sanctity is thus
reinforced by having two highly power-
ful and sacred sites to two different
deities. See also pitha.
Kalamukha
(“black face”) Extinct monastic sect
whose members were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and whose name may
refer to their practice of marking their
heads with a black streak. Little is
known about their doctrines or prac-
tices. While there are contemporary lit-
erary references to the Kapalikas,
another extinct Shaivite ascetic com-
munity, the only sources for the
Kalamukhas are a series of inscriptions.
From these inscriptions we know that
the Kalamukhas were strongest in the
Karnataka region, although they were
also present in other southern Indian
regions. They flourished between the
ninth and thirteenth centuries.
Kalasha
(“pitcher”) In the Nagara style of temple
architecture predominantly found in
northern India, the kalasha is an inverted
vase-shaped piece that crowns the tem-
ple towers (shikharas). In many cases,
kalashas were made of gold to provide a
decorative contrast above the stone. The
kalasha on the highest tower typically
has a banner fluttering from it. TheKali
architectural symbolism in Hindu
temples corresponds to the structure
of human body, so the kalashas stand
for the crown of the head, the highest
and purest part of the body. They are
also a symbol of the highest human
religious potential.
Kalhana
(12th c.) Kashmiri poet and author of the
Rajatarangini (“River of Kings”), a
poetic chronicle of the kings of
Kashmir. Kalhana’s chronicle is an
unusually descriptive and accurate his-
tory of Kashmir and its political, social,
and religious institutions. The text’s only
shortcoming is that it pays little atten-
tion to the outside world. Kalhana’s his-
torical emphasis is unusual for Indian
writers, and his chronicle is one of the
few indigenous Indian histories.
Kali
(“black”) Incomprehensibly fierce and
powerful divine form of the Mother
Goddess. Kali is the awful, uncon-
trolled power of the divine in its most
terrifying aspects. She is consistently
associated with images of blood, death,
and destruction; her dwelling place is
the cremation ground. Her iconogra-
phy portrays her as clothed with sev-
ered heads and limbs, and her form is
lean, gaunt, and haggard, with lolling
tongue and lips smeared with blood.
Paradoxically, millions of Kali’s devotees
(bhakta) refer to her as “mother.”
Kali’s roots are uncertain, but she is
generally assumed to be an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity. Her dark
color—associated with low social sta-
tus, her preference for dwelling in
inaccessible places, and her worship
by Indian aboriginal tribes and people
at the margins of society, all seem to
point to origins as a local goddess, per-
haps of tribal people. Some early
Sanskrit dramas, such as the poet
Bhavabhuti’s Malatimadhava , men-
tion fierce goddesses who received
offerings of blood from their devotees.
This same motif was a central element
in the stories about the Thugs in the
nineteenth century.
One of Kali’s earliest descriptions
comes in the Devimahatmya, the earliest
known source for the notion that God is
feminine. One of the Devimahatmya’s
episodes describes the birth of Kali (in
her form as Mahakali) as the anger of
the Goddess incarnate. In the story, Kali
first destroys the demon armies by stuff-
ing them into her mouth and eating
them whole, symbolizing her all-con-
suming power to destroy. Her other feat
in this text is the destruction of
Raktabija, a demon who receives the
boon that any drop of his blood that falls
to the earth will instantly turn into a
clone of him—a boon that renders him
practically unconquerable. Kali defeats
him by drinking his blood as it is shed
until it is completely gone. Both of these
episodes reinforce her image as a terrify-
ing and powerful goddess, her destruc-
tive capacity, and her associations with
substances and practices normally
considered to be defiling. As Kinsley
notes, Kali can also be seen as a sym-
bolic statement that human life is
uncertain and that tragedy and misfor-
tune can occur without warning, despite
the best-laid plans.
Worship of Kali has followed two
paths, one in agreement with these hor-
rific images and one in contradiction to
them. On one hand, Kali has been an
important deity for practitioners of the
secret, ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra. The tantras describe
reality as resulting from the interaction
between polar opposites, symbolized in
the deities of Shiva (consciousness) and
Shakti (“power”). Shiva provides the
ordering principle and is the Ultimate
Reality, but Shakti provides the energy
and dynamism that actually makes
things happen. Consequently, goddesses
take on an important role in tantric
practice. Among these goddesses Kali
stands preeminent, perhaps because
she is the most radical articulation of
feminine power and can thus be seen as
bringing the greatest power to bear on
[[333]]
Kali

that surround her: skulls, fire, her blood-smeared tongue, and severed heads and limbs.
[[334]]
Kalidasa
behalf of her devotees. Her power over
all things and Shiva’s helplessness with-
out this power is symbolized by the
images of Kali standing over the pros-
trate Shiva, clearly in a dominant posi-
tion. In this tradition, the tantric expert
is seen as a heroic figure who gains
power from the goddess.
The tantras also stress the reconcilia-
tion of opposites as a way to destroy all
conceptual dualism and affirm the ulti-
mate unity of the entire universe. To
carry this out, tantric rituals may
include practices involving substances
normally forbidden, such as the so-
called Panchamakara, or “Five
Forbidden Things,” as a way to affirm
the provisional nature of all judgments
of purity and impurity (ashaucha).
Again, Kali is the quintessential tantric
deity, since her iconography and
mythology involve things normally con-
sidered impure: drinking blood and
receiving animal sacrifices, living in the
cremation ground, and clothing herself
with severed limbs.
The other dominant image for the
worship of Kali is as a mother. This
image is preeminent in the Bengal
region, and has become widely estab-
lished there during the past few hun-
dred years. This image of Kali is rooted
in Indian images of motherhood, which
are greatly idealized in terms of a moth-
er’s devotion to her children. The central
belief is that if a devotee approaches Kali
as a submissive child, ready to take
whatever blows she gives, she will ulti-
mately turn her awesome forces toward
protecting her devotee. Kali’s most
famous devotees are the nineteenth-
century Bengali figures Ramprasad and
Ramakrishna; the former is famous for
a poem in which he states that there are
bad children but never a bad mother.
Religious adepts such as Ramprasad
and Ramakrishna have been able to
maintain this tension between Kali’s
horrific persona and her image as a
mother, but in popular devotion this
tension has been largely lost. Modern
images of Kali tend to sweeten or ignore
her horrific aspects, often portraying her
as young, beautiful, and almost benevo-
lent. For more information on Kali, see
David R. Kinsley, The Sword and the
Flute, 1975; and Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Kalibangan
Archeological site in the western state of
Rajasthan, a short distance from the
border with Pakistan. Kalibangan is one
of the cities of the Indus Valley
Civilization and is part of cluster of
cities in what many archaeologists
believe was the Saraswati River valley,
although at present the river disappears
into the desert. The site at Kalibangan is
nearly as large as the cities at Harappa,
Mohenjo-Daro, and Lothal. The city
plan is virtually identical to the others,
thus revealing the scope of this mysteri-
ous ancient culture.
Kalidasa
(5th c. ?) Generally considered the great-
est Sanskrit writer, noted both for his
command of the language and his ability
to evoke poetic emotion (rasa) in his
listeners. There is little definite informa-
tion about Kalidasa’s life; even the dates
of his birth and death have been widely
debated. According to legend, Kalidasa
was an illiterate village boy. As a joke he
was presented as a suitor for a learned
princess who had vowed that she would
only marry a man who could defeat her
in a silent debate—that is, a debate
using gestures instead of words.
Kalidasa “defeated” the princess
through coincidence and mutual mis-
understanding and became her hus-
band. When the princess discovered the
depths of Kalidasa’s ignorance, she
threw him out of the house, ordering
him not to return until he had become
educated. In desperation he went to a
temple of the goddess Kali and was
about to offer himself as a human sacri-
fice, when Kali appeared to him and
gave him absolute mastery of Sanskrit.
Upon his return, his wife is reported
to have asked him, “Have you gained
proficiency in [Sanskrit] speech?” (“Asti
[[335]]
Kalighat
kascit vagviseshatah?”). Kalidasa gave
his answer over time, using the three
words in his wife’s question as the first
words of his three greatest works—
Kumarasambhava , Meghaduta, and
Raghuvamsha. He is also the author of
the dramas Abhijnanashakuntala,
Vikramorvashiya, and the Malavikagnimitra.
These works reportedly gained him
the patronage of king Vikramaditya,
with whose court Kalidasa is
traditionally associated.
Legend also recounts that Kalidasa’s
miraculous gift of learning caused his
death. Since his wife had spurred his
search for learning, Kalidasa thought of
her as his guru or religious teacher. Out
of respect, he refused all sexual relations
with her. Enraged at his refusal, she
cursed him to meet his death at the
hands of a woman. Many years later, a
king composed a line of verse and
offered a large prize to the person who
could compose the best ending.
Kalidasa heard about this contest while
enjoying the company of a courtesan
and effortlessly composed the perfect
ending. In her greed for the prize, the
courtesan stabbed and killed Kalidasa.
Although her crime was discovered and
she was punished, this legend illustrates
the Hindu belief in the unstoppable
power of fate, particularly when driven
by a curse.
Kalighat
Temple dedicated to the goddess Kali in
the southern section of modern
Calcutta. This temple is several hundred
years old and is considered one of the
most important temples in Calcutta.
The city’s name is supposedly an
anglicized version of the temple’s name.
Local tradition claims that Kalighat
is one of the Shakti Pithas, a network
of sites sacred to the Goddess. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess; in the case of
Kalighat the body part was one of Sati’s
toes. See also pitha.

Kalika Devi
Name of both a shrine in the Shiwalik
Hills (foothills of the Himalayas) and of
its presiding deity. Kalika Devi is one of
the nine Shiwalik goddesses and is
believed to be a form of the goddess
Kali. The temple itself is in the town of
Kalka, on the road between the cities of
Chandigarh and Simla. As is the
case with many of the other Shiwalik
goddesses, the image of Kalika Devi is a
natural stone outcropping. This is con-
sidered a self-manifested (svayambhu)
form of the Goddess. Unlike many of the
other Shiwalik goddesses, the Hindi lit-
erature on this shrine does not claim
that the temple is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess, mythically connected as
places where a body part of the dismem-
bered goddess Sati fell to earth. Instead,
the literature simply commends the
temple for its power and majesty. The
literature does note, however, that local
priests claim it as the place where Sati’s
hair fell to earth. This illustrates both the
influence that pamphlet literature can
have in channeling pilgrim traffic and
the need to tie one’s site into the net-
work of the Shakti Pithas.
The stone outcropping that forms
Kalika Devi’s image is considered to be
her head. According to tradition, Kali
took the form of a beautiful woman and
came to the temple to sing festive songs
during the festival of Navaratri. The
local monarch was so smitten by
her voice and beauty that he asked
her to marry him. Enraged at this insult,
Kali cursed the king to lose his kingdom.
As a further sign of her displeasure,
she caused the temple image to begin
sinking into the earth. At the plea of
an ardent devotee, she allowed the
head of the image to remain visible.
See also pitha.
Kalimath
(“Kali’s Dwelling”) Village and sacred
site (tirtha) in the Himalaya mountains
of Uttar Pradesh state. Kalimath is
located on a small tributary of theKaliya
Mandakini River about ten miles from
the village of Guptakashi; the
Mandakini is one of the Himalayan trib-
utaries that combine to create the
Ganges. According to local tradition,
Kalimath is one of the Shakti Pithas, a
network of sites sacred to the Goddess.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess. Local sources claim
that Kalimath is the place where Sati’s
vulva fell to earth. It took form there as
the goddess Kali, thus associating a
highly charged female body part with a
powerful and often dangerous form of
the Goddess. The temple’s image of the
Goddess is extremely unusual—a brass
plate a little more than a foot square,
whose center is cut out in a small trian-
gle, an aniconic symbol of the Goddess.
This plate supposedly covers a pit—
a clear symbol of the part of Sati’s body
which is supposed to have fallen
there—but the area under the plate
is deemed so sacred that looking under
it is forbidden.
The claim that Kalimath is the place
where Sati’s vulva fell to earth illustrates
the fluidity of the Indian sacred land-
scape. There is a much more widely
accepted tradition associating this spe-
cific body part with the temple of
Kamakhya in Assam. Such competing
claims are not uncommon in the Indian
sacred landscape, since people often
make these claims to enhance their par-
ticular site’s sanctity and prestige. It is
notable that many Hindus seem little
concerned with such apparent inconsis-
tencies, perhaps stemming from the
conviction that a single Goddess lies
behind all her individual manifesta-
tions. See also pitha.
Kalivarjya
The name for a collection of about fifty-
five acts “to be avoided in the Kali
[Age],” the last age in the cycle of cosmic
time after which it is believed the world
will be destroyed and recreated. This
was one of the strategies used by brahmin
scholars to forbid certain religious prac-
tices that were prescribed in the sacred
literature but were no longer acceptable
because of changing ideas. The
Kalivarjya prohibitions first appear in
texts around the twelfth century C.E.
Some of the practices considered
acceptable in earlier times but prohibited
during the Kali age include certain
animal sacrifices prescribed in the
Vedas (the earliest Hindu religious texts)
and suicide by a person suffering from a
terminal illness. For further information
see Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968.
Kaliya
In Hindu mythology, a thousand-headed
serpent who is defeated by the adoles-
cent god Krishna in one of the earliest
acts foreshadowing the god’s future
greatness. Kaliya has settled into a deep
pool in the Yamuna River, rendering the
pool and its surroundings uninhabitable
because of the noxious poison he
constantly emits. One day as Krishna
and his companions tend the cows,
Krishna decides to get rid of Kaliya.
Despite his friends’ pleas, Krishna
climbs to the top of a tall tree and dives
deep into the pool. A tremendous battle
ensues. Krishna finally subdues Kaliya
by dancing on his hoods, stamping each
of the serpent’s heads until blood runs
out of Kaliya’s mouths. Kaliya’s wives beg
Krishna to spare his life, and Krishna
grants this request but banishes him to a
more appropriate place. His mercy mir-
rors the Hindu world view that even
beings such as Kaliya have a rightful
place in the world. Although problems
arise when such beings are in the wrong
place, these can be corrected by sending
them to a more appropriate one. For fur-
ther elaboration of this idea, See John
Stratton Hawley, “Krishna’s Cosmic
Victories,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 47, No. 2, 1979.

Kali Yuga
not particularly precious, and whose
black color is associated with Saturn,
the malevolent planet. Kali Yuga is
considered the time when human
wickedness runs rampant, virtue
virtually disappears, and the world is
inexorably falling into ruin. Hindus
believe that the Kali Yuga began with the
commencement of the great war
described in the epic Mahabharata,
and not surprisingly, it is the age in
which we now live.
Kalka
Image of the god Vishnu’s Kalki avatar.
It is believed that Vishnu will appear in
this form at the end of the world.
Kali Yuga
A particular age of the world in one of
the reckonings of cosmic time.
According to traditional belief, time has
neither beginning nor end, but alter-
nates between cycles of creation and
activity, followed by cessation and qui-
etude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32
billion years, with the active phase
known as the Day of Brahma, and the
quiet phase as the Night of Brahma. In
one reckoning of cosmic time, the Day
of Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
yugas, the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each of
these four yugas is shorter than its pre-
decessor and ushers in an era more
degenerate and depraved. By the end of
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad
that the only solution is the destruction
and re-creation of the earth, at which
time the next Krta era begins.
Kali Yuga is the last of the four yugas,
lasting for “only” 432,000 years. It is
also considered to be the most
degenerate yuga, symbolized by its
identification with iron—a metal that is
sometimes useful, sometimes harmful,
[[338]]

Town in the Ambala district of the state
of Haryana, about ten miles north and
east of Chandigarh. Kalka is famous as
the site of the temple of Kalika Devi,
who is considered to be a form of the
goddess Kali and is one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses.
Kalki Avatar
The tenth avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, and the only one of these
incarnations who has not yet appeared.
In traditional art, Kalki is portrayed as
riding a white horse and brandishing a
sword. It is believed that he will come at
a time when the state of the world has
completely degenerated. His arrival will
signal its imminent destruction; his pur-
pose will be to purify the world by
destroying the wicked.
Kalpa
The largest unit of cosmic time, equiv-
alent to 4.32 billion years. According to
one concept, the kalpa is broken up
into one thousand mahayugas, each
lasting 4.32 million years. The kalpa, or
Day of Brahma, is the longest con-
ceived measure of time and is used to
determine the duration of the uni-
verse. After the kalpa is complete, it is
followed by an equally long “Night of
Brahma,” a period of universal disso-
lution (pralaya).Kalpavas
KalpaKalpataru
(2) (“proper,” “fit”) One of the six
Vedangas, auxiliary branches of knowl-
edge connected with the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts. The Kalpa
section prescribes the rites connected
with the Vedic rituals and gives rules for
performing ceremonial and sacrificial
acts. The other Vedangas are vyakarana
(Sanskrit grammar), chandas (Sanskrit
prosody), nirukta (etymology), shiksha
(correct pronunciation), and jyotisha
(auspicious times for sacrifices).(“wishing-tree”) Extensive collection of
writings on matters relating to religious
law, compiled by the scholar
Lakshmidhara in the middle of the
twelfth century. The Kalpataru is one of
the earliest examples of commentarial
literature known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”). The nibandhas were collections
of Hindu lore, in which the compilers
drew references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts. Then they compiled these
excerpts into a single volume. Each of
the Kalpataru’s fourteen volumes is
devoted to a particular aspect of Hindu
religious life, including daily practice,
worship, gift-giving (dana), vows, pil-
grimage, penances (prayashchitta),
purification, and final liberation of the
soul (moksha). As one of the earliest
nibandhas, the Kalpataru formed
a model for later writers and was also
an important resource for them.
Lakshmidhara’s writing is unusual
because he used very few sources for his
work—primarily the epic Mahabharata
and a few of the sectarian collections
known as puranas. Unlike later
commentators, he does not cite the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts,
or the prescriptions found in the dharma
literature. His text also consists mostly
of these excerpted passages with very
little commentary of his own, whereas
later nibandha writers often give
voluminous explanations.
Kalpa Sutras
(“aphorisms on sacred law”) An impor-
tant class of smrti or “remembered [lit-
erature].” The Kalpa Sutras were first
composed around the sixth century
B.C.E. The sutras were collected to pro-
vide a unified religious and legal world-
view. According to the general scholarly
consensus, the theory used to associate
these sutras imposed an appearance of
conceptual order on what was more
likely an organic development of Hindu
religious law. The Kalpa Sutras are all
attributed to famous sages. In theory
each Kalpa Sutra contains three sepa-
rate parts: prescriptions for Vedic rituals
(Shrauta Sutras), prescriptions for
domestic rites (Grhya Sutras), and pre-
scriptions for appropriate human
behavior (Dharma Sutras). The real pic-
ture is far more complex since only three
sutras contain all three parts and are
attributed to a single author. The three
surviving Kalpa Sutras are attributed to
the sages Apastamba, Baudhayana, and
Hiranyakeshin and are all associated
with the same school, the Black Yajur
Veda. There are many other collections
that have one or another of these parts,
but not all three. Each of the Kalpa
Sutras is also theoretically connected
with one of the four Vedas, the earliest
Hindu religious texts. However, it is likely
that this claim was made to give author-
ity to the collection.
Kalpavas
(“residence for a kalpa”) Strict religious
vow taken during the annual Magh
Mela festival in the city of Allahabad
during the lunar month of Magh
(January–February). Allahabad is locat-
ed at the confluence of two sacred
rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna.
The festival’s primary religious act is
bathing (snana) at this confluence.
Although most people stay at this festi-
val only a brief time, kalpavasis, or peo-
ple taking the kalpavas vow, do not leave
[[339]]
Kalpeshvar
the site of the festival for the entire
month. Kalpavasis also take vows to live
a strict ascetic lifestyle, which includes
daily baths in the Ganges, a restricted
diet, particular dress and worship, and
attendance at the religious gatherings
known as satsang.boundaries of righteous action, or
dharma, desires and their satisfaction
are recognized as a normal, acceptable
part of life. It is when this governing
force is absent that the search
for pleasure becomes inappropriate
and destabilizing.
KalpeshvarKama
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas, about
ten miles down the Alakananda River
from Joshimath. The temple’s presiding
deity is the god Shiva in his manifesta-
tion as Kalpeshvar, the “Lord of the
Cosmic Age.” The Kalpeshvar temple is
one of the Panchkedar, a network of five
sites in the Garhwal region that are
sacred to Shiva; the other four sites are
Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath, and
Madmaheshvar. Shiva is believed to
dwell in the Himalayas. This network of
five sites is seen as a symbolic represen-
tation of his body. Kalpeshvar represents
Shiva’s matted locks (jatas).(2) Minor deity identified as the person-
ification of kama (“desire”). Kama is
comparable to the Greek deity Eros and
carries similar responsibility for igniting
human sexual attraction and sensual
desire. Kama is represented as a young
man riding on a parrot, armed with a
bow and arrows. The bow is a stalk of
sugar cane, the bowstring a line of
buzzing bees; his five arrows are five dif-
ferent flowers, each bringing a different
emotional effect to the person it pierces.
The five flowers and emotions are: lotus,
infatuation; ashoka, intoxication (with
love); mango, exhaustion; jasmine, pin-
ing; blue lotus, paralysis. Kama’s icono-
graphy carries strong associations with
spring, and the spring season (personi-
fied as another minor deity, Vasant) is
perceived as Kama’s friend and ally in
awakening desire through the regenera-
tion of the natural world and the showy
display of spring blossoms.
The most famous episode in Kama’s
mythology begins with the ascent to
power of a demon named Taraka, who
can only be killed by a son of Shiva.
Taraka seems impossible to defeat, since
Shiva has no sons and is in deep medita-
tion, grieving over the death of his wife
Sati. The other gods ask Kama to shoot
Shiva with an arrow of desire so he will
marry the goddess Parvati and produce
a son. Kama creeps up on Shiva and
shoots him with an arrow. When Shiva
realizes who has disturbed his medita-
tion, he releases a stream of fire from the
third eye in the middle of his forehead,
instantly burning Kama to ashes.
Through Shiva’s grace, Kama is eventu-
ally brought back to life. One of Kama’s
epithets or alternate names is Ananga,
or “bodiless,” because of the loss of his
Kalyanamandapam
(“marriage hall”) One of the common
architectural features of southern
Indian temples built in the Dravida
style. The kalyanamandapam is a hall
where the images of the temple’s primary
deity and that deity’s spouse could be
ceremonially united on festival days to
symbolize their married state.
Kama
In Indian philosophy, one of the four
purusharthas, or aims of life, with
the others being artha (wealth,
power, and prosperity), dharma
(righteousness), and moksha (libera-
tion). The most basic meaning of
kama is “desire,” with strong overtones
of sexual desire, but kama can also
refer to all types of attraction, including
aesthetic pleasure from the arts. The
most famous treatise on the fulfillment
of kama is the Kama Sutra , which
details the satisfaction of sexual
desires. When pursued within the
[[340]]
Kamakotipith
body (and the fact that desire seems to
strike in unseen ways). Despite being
destroyed by Shiva and seemingly foiled,
in the end Kama achieves his goal. His
attempt to draw Shiva out of his medita-
tion succeeds, and eventually Shiva
marries Parvati. For more information
on the interplay between Shiva and
Kama, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty,
Siva, 1981.
Kamada Ekadashi
Ekadashi, or eleventh-day, festival of
the bright, waxing half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April). Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise-specific
benefits for faithful performance. As
promised by its name (“wish-granting”),
faithfully observing this festival will
fulfill one’s desire (kama), whatever it
may be.
Kamadhenu
In Hindu mythology, a goddess in the
form of a cow (dhenu) who has the
power to grant all one’s wishes (kama).
The Kamadhenu is considered the
mother of all cattle. She is associated
with giving gifts of food, and thus is an
extension of the gifts of food given by all
cows. In Hindu mythology, Kamadhenu
is the property of the sage Jamadagni.
Her theft by a local king prompts Jama-
dagni’s son, Parashuram avatar, to circle
the earth twenty-one times, in an attempt
to wipe out the kshatriya (kingly) class.
Kamakhya
(“desiring eyes”) A particular manifesta-
tion of the Mother Goddess, whose tem-
ple on Nilachal Hill overlooks the
Brahmaputra River just outside the city
of Guwahati in Assam. This temple is
one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites that spreads throughout the sub-
continent and is sacred to the Goddess.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess. The Kamakhya tem-
ple is the place where Sati’s vulva fell to
earth. Its image of the goddess is a nat-
ural cleft in the rock, around which the
temple has been built. Since Kamakhya
sprang from the most sexually charged
part of the female body, it is no surprise
that she is believed to be extremely pow-
erful. Like many powerful goddesses,
her productive capacity must be con-
stantly recharged through receiving sac-
rifices, especially the blood of living
beings. In modern times the usual sacri-
fice is a goat, but in earlier times the
offering of human sacrifices is well
documented. Kamakhya was reportedly
offered 140 men when her present tem-
ple was consecrated in 1565. This prac-
tice continued until the British halted it
in 1832. The men offered as human sac-
rifices were reportedly volunteers who
believed that they had been called by
her to do this. In the time between
announcing their intention to be sacri-
ficed and their deaths, they were treated
as virtual divinities, since they were con-
sidered to have been consecrated to the
goddess. For further information see
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and
the Kanphata Yogis, 1973. See also pitha.
Kamakotipith
An important center for the Dashanami
sect of Sanyasi ascetics, located in the
southern Indian city of Kanchipuram.
According to local tradition, the
Kamakotipith was the first and most
important of the maths or monastic
centers, established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, who later established
four other centers at Joshimath, Puri,
Shringeri, and Dwaraka. This claim to
primacy has generated fierce controversy.
Opponents who support one of the
other four maths, not only deny
Kamakotipith’s place as the first of the
maths, but also assert that Kamakotipith
is only a branch of the Shringeri math.
Support for these claims can be drawn
from the symbolism connected with the
number four—the four cardinal direc-
tions, the four sacred texts known as
[[341]]
Kamalakanta
Vedas, and the four organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis
themselves. The number four symbol-
izes completion and totality, which
makes a fifth sacred center problem-
atic. Despite their possible merit,
these contentions have not diminished
Kamakotipith’s status. It has a long his-
tory as an ascetic center, and its head
monk is routinely considered one of the
Shankaracharyas, the most important
modern Hindu religious leaders.
Kamakotipith’s importance probably
reflects the importance of Kanchipuram
itself, which was such a significant
sacred and political hub that any ascetic
center located there could gain consid-
erable authority.
Kamalakanta
(d. 1820) Bengali poet, devotee (bhakta)
of the goddess Kali, and teacher and
practitioner of the secret, ritually-based
religious practice known as tantra.
Kamalakanta spent most of his life as
the guru and learned adviser (pundit) of
the king of Burdwan, a region northwest
of modern Calcutta, whose capital is
also named Burdwan.
Kamandalu
A water pot traditionally used by
ascetics, usually having a removable lid
for ease in filling and a spout for pour-
ing. Kamandalus may be made from
various materials, such as gourds, wood,
metal, or baked clay. They are generally
wider than they are tall, making them
stable and less likely to tip over. In
India’s climate, water is an obvious
necessity. Even ascetics with very few
possessions will generally have some
means to carry and store it. Aside from
satisfying their physical needs, water is
an important element in ascetic reli-
gious life, since it is often an offering
used in worship as well as the preferred
medium for bathing (snana) and other
rites of purification. This religious
importance makes the kamandalu a
powerful object in its own right. A
[[342]]

kamandalu is considered especially sig-
nificant when it has been used for years
by a noted ascetic—objects kept in close
proximity to such a person are believed
to be charged with their spiritual power.
In modern times, kamandalus are still
important ritual objects, but their prac-
tical function has largely been replaced
by screw-top plastic vessels.
Kama Sutra
(“manual on desire”) By far the most
famous of the ancient erotic manuals,
traditionally attributed to the sage
Vatsyayana. This text is usually associated
with an exhaustive catalog of sexual
positions and pleasures, but in fact it
goes far beyond this stereotype.
Vatsyayana was interested in exploring
desire in all its manifestations. The text
begins with a consideration of the four
aims of life (purushartha): worldly
goods (artha), desire (kama), religious
duty (dharma), and liberation of the
soul (moksha). Vatsyayana argued that
since desire was one of the established
goals of human life, its pursuit was thus
a good thing, as long as this pursuit did
not interfere with the others.
Having established the legitimacy of
desire, Vatsyayana then discussed how
to foster it. The Kama Sutra’s second
book contains the text’s best-known
material, the discussion and categoriza-
tion of various types of sexual union. It
begins by characterizing types of sexual
endowment, both male and female.
Next it describes different sorts of
embracing, kissing, scratching, and bit-
ing as symbols of passion, along with
sexual positions and oral sex. This is fol-
lowed by chapters on gaining a wife,
attracting other men’s wives (which the
text discourages, except in cases where
one’s passion is “too strong”), courte-
sans, and general remarks on the nature
of attraction.
The text is a manual for all phases of
erotic life in which sex can be refined
into a vehicle for aesthetic experience as
well as pure carnal pleasure. The Kama
Sutra is also notable for its perspectiveKamika Ekadashi
on women, who are seen as having
equal sexual desire and gaining equal
pleasure. The ultimate aim is the sexual
satisfaction of both partners, rather than
one partner simply serving the other.
The Kama Sutra has been translated
many times.
Kamavasayitvam
(“suppression of desire”) One of the
eight superhuman powers (siddhi), tra-
ditionally believed to be conferred by
high spiritual attainment. This power
gives one the ability to control desires. It
also means that any declaration one
makes, such as pronouncing a blessing
(ashirvad) or a curse, will inevitably
come to pass. The basis for this latter
power seems to stem from the absence
of individual desire in such a person,
meaning that person will never be moti-
vated by self-interest. This power
reflects the pan-Indian belief that by
renouncing everything, one can eventu-
ally gain power over everything.
Kamban
(9th c.) Southern Indian poet most
noted as the author of the Tamil-
language version of the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Hindu epics.
Kamban’s text is known as the Kamba
Ramayana, and remains popular in
modern times. As with all vernacular
translations of the Ramayana, Kamban
did not simply translate Valmiki’s
Sanskrit epic from Sanskrit to a more
common language, but adapted and
even added to it as he saw fit. Of partic-
ular interest is his heroic portrayal of the
demon-king Ravana, who is the villain
in the original story. This shift may
reflect feelings of regional pride, since
Kamban was a southern Indian and
Ravana’s kingdom of Lanka is generally
identified as the island of Sri Lanka in
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the
Indian mainland.
A kamandalu is used to hold water
for use in religious rites.
Kamba Ramayana
Tamil language version of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. The Kamba Ramayana was
written in ninth century by the southern
Indian poet Kamban. As with all vernac-
ular renditions of the Ramayana,
Kamban did not simply translate
Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic, but adapted
and added to it as he saw fit. Of particu-
lar interest is his heroic portrayal of
Ravana, the demon-king, who is the vil-
lain in the original story. This shift may
reflect feelings of regional pride, since
Kamban was from southern Indian.
Ravana’s kingdom of Lanka is generally
identified as the island of Sri Lanka in
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the
Indian mainland.
Kamika Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark, waxing half of
the lunar month of Shravan
(July–August). As with all eleventh-day
observances, Kamika Ekadashi is
[[343]]
Kamsa
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. The name Kamika means
“desiring,” a theme supported by the
charter myth. According to this story,
the brahmins in a certain village
refuse to perform religious rites for a
landowner guilty of murdering another
brahmin. The landowner is freed from
that sin by observing the Kamika
Ekadashi and is thus able to have the
desired rites performed.
Kamsa
In Hindu mythology, the wicked king of
Mathura who is considered the brother of
Devaki, the god Krishna’s mother, and
thus Krishna’s uncle. According to leg-
end, Kamsa is born when a demon takes
the form of Ugrasena, Devaki’s father,
and under this guise has intercourse
with Kamsa’s mother.
On Devaki’s wedding day, a divine
voice warns Kamsa that his sister’s
eighth child will eventually kill him. In
an effort to prevent this prophecy, he
kills all of Devaki’s children as soon as
they are born. Yet on the night Krishna
is born, a deep sleep falls over the
inhabitants of the palace, the locked
doors magically open, and the infant is
spirited away to the home of his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. When
Kamsa finds out what has happened,
he first sends his men to kill all the
newborn children in the country. When
that attempt fails to destroy Krishna,
Kamsa sends various demon assassins,
such as Putana, Shakata, Trnavarta,
Keshi, and Bakasur. Krishna dispatches
all of these with ease, and Kamsa even-
tually has to try other strategies. He
announces a grand festival and dis-
patches his chariot to pick up Krishna
and his brother Balarama, who by
then have grown into adolescents.
Kamsa’s plan is to lure the brothers to
the festival grounds where they can be
killed in a “friendly” match with some
[[344]]

experienced wrestlers. The two boys
derail this plot by killing the wrestlers,
after which Krishna leaps up into the
royal box and kills Kamsa as well.
Kamya Karma
(“desiderative [ritual] action”) One of
three general categories of ritual action,
the others being nitya karma and
naimittika karma. Kamya karma is a rit-
ual performed solely for the performer’s
desire (kama) to obtain the benefits of
this action. Unlike the other two cate-
gories, which must be performed at spe-
cific times or occasions, this one is
completely voluntary and based solely
on the desire for its benefits. One exam-
ple of a kamya karma is religious pil-
grimage, which one is not required to do
but which is believed to generate reli-
gious merit. Another example would be
performing a particular vrat, or religious
vow, which might be done daily, weekly,
monthly, or yearly.
Kanada
(2nd c. B.C.E.?) Philosopher who is tradi-
tionally named as the author of the
Vaisheshika Sutras and founder of the
Vaisheshika philosophical school, one of
six schools of Hindu philosophy.
Kanada’s date is uncertain, but he is
believed to have lived after the third
century B.C.E. In its earliest form, the
Vaisheshika school followed a doctrine
of atomism, asserting that there are sim-
ple building blocks that cohere to form
complex objects. This cohesion also
attaches objects to their qualities. As
Vaisheshika combined with the Nyaya
school, another of the six schools, the
Vaisheshikas gradually adopted the
Nyaya idea of God as the regulating
force behind these atomic relations.
Kanauj
Small city on the Ganges River, about
fifty miles upstream from the city of
Kanpur. Kanauj is now insignificant, but
the city, formerly known as Kanyakubja,
was once one of the most important inKanchipuram
northern India. Its existence is docu-
mented as early as the sixth century
B.C.E. The city was an important stop on
the trade route running through the
Ganges basin. It is referenced in
Ptolemy’s Geography, written around
[[150]]
 C.E. Kanauj was also an important
political center; in the early seventh
century it was the capital of the
Pushyabhuti dynasty, ruled by the
emperor Harsha. In later centuries the
Pala, Rashtrakuta, and Gurjara-
Pratihara dynasties fought over the city,
with the Gurjara-Pratihara eventually
gaining control. After suffering an attack
by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1017 C.E.,
Kanauj seems to have gone into perma-
nent decline. Its modern legacy is being
the location of the dominant branch of
brahmins in the Gangetic Plain. They
call themselves Kanaujia brahmins.
Kanaujia
One of the five northern brahmin com-
munities (Pancha Gauda); the other
four are Gauda, Maithila, Utkala, and
Saraswat. Kanaujia brahmins trace their
origin to the city of Kanauj. Kanaujia
brahmins are found in greatest density
in the eastern section of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, near the city of Kanauj;
subgroups can be found throughout
Bihar, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and
the inland regions of Orissa.
Kanchipuram
Temple-town and sacred site (tirtha)
about forty miles southwest of the city of
Madras in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Kanchipuram is important as one of
India’s Seven Sacred Cities. Dying in
one of these cities is believed to bring
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
At differing times Kanchipuram served
as a capital for the Pallava, Chola,
and Vijayanagar kings; each of these
dynasties left its mark in the city’s
architecture. Kanchipuram is filled
with
temples,
many
of
them
magnificent examples of the southern
Indian Dravida architectural style.
Kanchipuram’s importance as a political
center and its concentration of temples,
brahmins, and scholars made it one of
the greatest centers of Hindu life, learn-
ing, and religion.
Kanchipuram is also noted for its
temples to each of the three major
Hindu deities—Vishnu, Shiva, and the
Goddess. The Vaikuntaperumal Temple
is dedicated to Vishnu in his form as
“Lord of Vaikuntha,” his celestial realm.
The Goddess is worshiped as Kamakshi
(“desiring eyes”). Kamakshi is identified
with the goddess Kamakhya, whose
temple in Assam is the most powerful of
all the Shakti Pithas.
Shiva
is
worshiped
at
the
Kailasanatha temple, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of Mt. Kailas,” and at
the Ekambareshvar temple. The image
of Shiva at the former site is one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a net-
work of five southern Indian sites sacred
to the god Shiva. In each of these sites
Shiva is worshiped as a linga, the pillar-
shaped object that is his symbolic form.
At each site the linga is believed to be
formed from one of the five primordial
elements (bhuta)—earth, wind, fire,
water, and space (akasha). The
Kanchipuram linga is associated with
the element of earth, the humblest but
most essential of all.
Another reason for Kanchipuram’s
prominence is its long tradition as a
center for asceticism. Kanchipuram’s
Kamakotipith is an ancient center for
the Dashanami sect. Its leader is consid-
ered to be one of the Shankaracharyas,
the most important contemporary
Hindu leaders. According to local tradi-
tion the Kamakotipith was the first and
most important of the maths, or monas-
tic centers, established by the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya, who later
established four other centers at
Joshimath, Puri, Shringeri, and
Dwaraka. This claim to primacy has
generated fierce controversy, with oppo-
nents not only denying Kamakotipith’s
place as the first of the maths, but also
asserting that Kamakotipith is only a
branch of the Shringeri math. Some
[[345]]
Kandariya Mahadev
constructed at the end of the wave of cre-
ativity that produced all of the Khajuraho
temples. It is the best-developed example
of the Khajuraho branch of the Nagara
architectural style, in which all of the
temple’s smaller towers lead to and cul-
minate in one central tower directly
over the sanctuary. Like most of the
temples at Khajuraho, the Kandariya
Mahadev temple is covered with erotic
sculpture—perhaps as a symbol for
union with the divine, perhaps as a reli-
gious affirmation of every aspect of
human existence.
Kandarpa
Epithet of the god Kama, a minor deity
identified as the personification of kama
(“desire”) who is comparable to the
Greek deity Eros. See Kama.
Kangra
Vaikuntaperumal Temple in Kanchipuram.
support for these claims can be drawn
from symbolism connected with the
number four—the four cardinal direc-
tions, the four sacred texts known as
Vedas, and the four organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis
themselves. The number four symbol-
izes completion and totality, which
makes a fifth sacred center problematic.
Kamakotipith reflects the importance of
Kanchipuram as a significant sacred and
political hub in which any ascetic center
could gain considerable authority. See
also pitha.
The name of a town and district in the
state of Himachal Pradesh; the town
was formerly the capital of a small hill
kingdom with the same name. Kangra is
famous for the temple of Vajreshvari
Devi, one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, Kangra’s status as a courtly
center brought in patronage for the
Pahari school of miniature painting.
Kanha
Epithet of the god Krishna. The name
Kanha is actually a form of the name
Krishna, modified in the transition
between Sanskrit and vernacular lan-
guage. See Krishna.
Kandariya Mahadev
The largest of the temples at Khajuraho
in the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is
dedicated to the god Shiva in his mani-
festation as “Skanda’s Lord”; Skanda is
another deity who is considered to be
Shiva’s son, and the general of Shiva’s
army. The Kandariya Mahadev temple
was built by the kings of the Chandella
dynasty between 1025 and 1050. It was
[[346]]

Kanhaiya
Epithet of the god Krishna. As with
the name Kanha, Kanhaiya is actually
a form of the name Krishna that
has been modified in the transition
between Sanskrit and vernacular lan-
guage. See Krishna.Kanyadan
Kankhal
City and sacred site (tirtha) three miles
south of the city of Haridwar in the state
of Uttar Pradesh. Kankhal is most
famous for the Daksha Mahadev tem-
ple, dedicated to the god Shiva in his
form as “Daksha’s Lord.” This temple’s
charter myth is one of the most famous
of all the stories of Shiva. Daksha is one
of the sons of the god Brahma and the
father of Sati, the goddess whom
Daksha gives in marriage to Shiva. When
Daksha feels that Shiva has not shown
him proper respect, he plans a great sac-
rifice to which he invites all the gods,
but purposely excludes Shiva. When Sati
asks why her husband has been excluded,
Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, denouncing Shiva as worthless
and despicable. Humiliated, Sati com-
mits suicide. Shiva is furious when he
hears of Sati’s death, and in his rage cre-
ates the fierce deities Virabhadra and
Bhadrakali. He then comes storming
with his minions (gana) to the sacrificial
ground, completely destroying the sac-
rifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.
Daksha is eventually restored to life,
repents his foolish pride, and asks Shiva
to remain at that site forever, which he
agrees to do.
There are numerous smaller temples
near the Daksha Mahadev temple, some
of which are dedicated to figures associ-
ated with this story, such as Virabhadra.
Across the street from the Daksha tem-
ple is a large ashram, or religious com-
munity, built by devotees (bhakta) of
the Bengali mystic Anandamayi Ma.
The ashram also contains her samadhi
shrine, or burial place.
Kannada
One of the four Dravidian languages,
along with Tamil, Telegu, and
Malayalam; all four languages are spo-
ken in southern India. Kannada is the
predominant language in modern
Karnataka, one of the “linguistic” states,
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Despite its recent political
significance, Kannada has a long history
as a literary and cultural language and is
particularly important as the language
for the devotional (bhakti) poetry of the
Lingayat religious community. See also
Tamil language.
Kanphata
(“split ear”) Colloquial name for the
Nathpanthi sect of ascetics, who are
followers of the sage Gorakhnath.
This particular name stems from the
Nathpanthi’s
most
characteristic
feature: When a Nathpanthi ascetic
is ready for final initiation, the cartilage
in his ears is slit with a razor to insert
the large earrings by which members
of this group are easily identified.
See Nathpanthi.
Kanvar
A bamboo pole with baskets or recepta-
cles suspended from each end. In earlier
times a kanvar would have been a natural
way for people to carry heavy loads. Its
major use today is for religious rites in
which pilgrims carry water from one
place to offer to a deity in another. The
kanvar is the device by which the water
is kept elevated the entire way. This
keeps the water’s original purity unbro-
ken, preserving it as an appropriate
offering for a deity. The most famous
example of this rite is at the temple of
Vaidyanath in the state of Bihar. It is
also found at temples in Haridwar in
Uttar Pradesh, Tarakeshvar in West
Bengal, and the hills of Maharashtra.
Kanyadan
(“gift of a virgin”) In its most specific
sense, the kanyadan is the part of the
traditional wedding ceremony in which
the bride’s father (or guardian) formally
transfers her to her husband’s family. In
a more general sense, the word refers to
giving a daughter in marriage to another
family. This “gift” is believed to be highly
commendable for the father, since the
bride is supposed to be given without
[[347]]
Kanyakubja

asking for anything in return. At the
same time, the status difference
between the bride’s family (as wife
“givers”) and the groom’s (as wife “tak-
ers”) can make this “gift” an extremely
expensive proposition for the bride’s
family. See Dowry.
Kanyakubja
(“[city of ] humpbacked maidens”)
Ancient name for the site now known as
Kanauj, which was the capital for several
northern Indian dynasties in the latter
half of the first millennium. The name
Kanyakubja comes from a tale about a
king who has a hundred daughters. One
day the daughters’ games disturb the
meditation of a local sage who is filled
with desire for them. The king worries
about angering the sage and promises
him one of his daughters in marriage.
Ninety-nine of his daughters flatly
refuse to marry the sage because of his
advanced age and gruff demeanor, but
the youngest agrees to do so in obedi-
ence to her father. The sage accepts the
youngest daughter and curses the others
to become humpbacked so they will
never be able to marry.
[[348]]

Kanyakumari
(“virgin girl”) City and sacred site
(tirtha) at the extreme southern edge of
the state of Tamil Nadu, at the conflu-
ence of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea,
and Bay of Bengal. Kanyakumari is
important as a bathing (snana) place.
Kanyakumari is also the name of the
site’s major deity, a local goddess who
has been assimilated into the pantheon
as a manifestation of the goddess
Parvati. According to local tradition,
Kanyakumari set her heart on marrying
Shiva; when this was prevented she
vowed to remain a perpetual virgin
(kanya). Her manifestation here is clearly
different from all the other forms of
Parvati, who are invariably married to
Shiva, yet Kanyakumari’s unmarried sta-
tus also gives her independent power.
Kapala
A human skull. In Hindu art, a skull is
often carried by the god Shiva, who uses
it as a vessel to hold his food and drink.
As with many of Shiva’s attributes, such
as the snakes he wears as jewelry and
the ash from the cremation ground with
which he smears his body, the skull-
bowl is a sign of Shiva’s untamed natureKapalin
and his aloofness from the standards
and concerns of everyday life. Use of a
skull-bowl has also been adopted by
some Shaiva ascetics, both past and
present, in imitation of this myth. The
skulls are usually taken from cremation
grounds; the upper skull is separated to
be made into a bowl.
Kapalamochana
(“releasing the skull”) Bathing (snana)
tank and sacred site (tirtha) in the
northern section of the city of Benares.
According to Hindu mythology, when
the wrathful deity Bhairava cuts off the
fifth head of the god Brahma, insulting
the god Shiva, the skull sticks to
Bhairava’s hand as a visible sign of his
crime. Bhairava visits all the holy places
of the earth trying to get rid of the skull,
but to no avail. When he arrives in
Kapalamochana, the skull spontaneously
drops from his hand, liberating
him from his crime. This act indicates
that Kapalamochana is the holiest
place on earth.
Kapalika
Extinct monastic sect of Shaivite
ascetics, or devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. Although none of the Kapalikas’
own written records have survived,
there are numerous descriptions of
them by other ascetic groups and by
dramatists of their time such as Bana
(7th c.) and Bhavabhuti (8th c.). The
sources describe the Kapalikas as wor-
shiping the god Shiva in his wrathful
form as Bhairava and as emulating
Bhairava’s characteristics: wearing their
hair long and matted, smearing their
bodies with ash (preferably from the
cremation ground), and carrying a club
and a skull-bowl (kapala). The Kapalikas
are cited as indulging in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs,
performing human sacrifice, and
enjoying orgiastic sexuality. Needless to
say, most of the available sources do not
approve of them.
David Lorenzen argues that despite
the disapproval of their contemporaries,
all the Kapalika practices must be seen
in the context of tantra. Tantra is a
secret, ritually-based religious practice
that its initiates believe is far more pow-
erful and effective than ordinary reli-
gious worship. One of its most essential
themes is the ultimate unity of every-
thing that exists. From a tantric perspec-
tive, to affirm that the entire universe is
one principle—often, conceived as the
activity of a particular deity—means
that the adept must reject all concepts
based on dualistic thinking. One way to
do this is to partake of the “Five
Forbidden Things” (panchamakara),
consciously breaking societal norms
forbidding
illicit
sexuality
and
consumption of intoxicants and non-
vegetarian food. This is always done
within a carefully defined ritual setting,
in a conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden.
Seen in this context, the Kapalikas’
behavior is shocking but becomes more
understandable. Lorenzen also specu-
lates that in performing such behaviors
(which may have only taken place dur-
ing religious ceremonies), the Kapalikas
were identifying themselves with their
chosen deity, Bhairava. In the Hindu
pantheon Bhairava is known for his
uncontrolled excesses, particularly for
cutting off one of the heads of the god
Brahma, for which he has to perform
severe penances (prayashchitta). In this
understanding, the Kapalikas’ practices
are not motivated by hedonistic self-
gratification but by the desire to imitate
their chosen deity. The only developed
source on the Kapalikas is David
Lorenzen, The Kapalikas and the
Kalamukhas, 1972.
Kapalin
(“skull-bearer”) The name for any
ascetic bearing a human skull, either as
a begging bowl or as a piece of ascetic
paraphernalia. Such ascetics are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva in his ter-
rible form. Their use of the skull is a
[[349]]
Kapha
symbol that, like Shiva, they have
transcended all earthly concerns of
purity, impurity (ashaucha), and
conventional standards of what is and is
not appropriate.
Kapha
(“phlegm”) Along with vata (“air”) and
pitta (“bile”), one of the three bodily
humours (tridosha) in ayurveda, the
traditional system of Indian medicine.
Every person has all three of these
humours, but usually one is dominant;
this marks a person in certain ways, par-
ticularly with regard to health, digestion,
and metabolism. Kapha is associated
with the elements of earth and water,
since phlegm has both liquid and solid
characteristics. It provides solidity and
fluidity. Those who exhibit this humor
are said to be strong, healthy, and have
great stamina. At the same time, this
solidity can take the form of inertia and
fatigue; “phlegmatic” people must do
their best avoid these tendencies.

is to bring the Ganges down to earth
and have their ashes touched by her
waters. Fulfilling this condition galva-
nizes several generations of Sagar’s
descendants—Anshuman, Dilip, and
Bhagirath—until the last is finally suc-
cessful in bringing the river to earth.
Kapila
(2) Philosopher cited as the traditional
founder of the Samkhya philosophical
school, one of the six schools of Hindu
philosophy. Little is known about him;
much of what is known has a legendary
tone that makes its value as historical
data questionable. Kapila may have
lived in the seventh century B.C.E. If
this is true, Kapila would have lived
about a thousand years earlier than
Ishvarakrishna. The latter is the first
Samkhya figure from whom we have a
well-attested text, the Samkhyakarikas,
which is the foundational text for
the school.
KapilaKapilavastu
A powerful and ornery sage in Hindu
mythology. Kapila’s most famous mythic
exploit occurs in the story of the
Descent of the Ganges. King Sagar is on
the verge of completing his hundredth
horse sacrifice (ashvamedha). This will
give him enough religious merit to claim
the throne of Indra, king of the gods.
Indra forestalls this threat by stealing the
sacrificial horse and tying it outside
Kapila’s ashram. Sagar dispatches his
sixty-thousand sons to find the horse.
When they finally locate it at Kapila’s
ashram, they find the sage deep in med-
itation. The sons assume that the sage’s
meditation is a ploy to keep from having
to answer their questions, so they begin
to abuse him physically. Kapila becomes
extremely angry. The accumulated
power generated by his long asceticism
(tapas) is released like fire, burning the
sixty-thousand sons to ash. Kapila later
informs Sagar’s sole surviving descen-
dant, Anshuman, that the only way toAncient city in southern Nepal, just over
the Indian border from the state of
Bihar. Buddhist sources identify it as the
capital city of Buddha’s father, King
Suddhodhana of the Shakya tribe.
Kapilavastu was part of the thriving
urban network in that region of India
during the fifth century B.C.E.
Kapu
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organized
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group held a monopoly. In
traditional society, the Kapus were farm-
ers. In much of modern Andhra
Pradesh, particularly the region border-
ing modern Tamil Nadu, the Kapus are
the dominant landholding group.Karma
Karana
In Indian philosophy, the name for an
instrumental cause, or the cause by
which another thing is accomplished.
An example often given by the Nyaya
philosophical school states that when
a potter connects two pot-halves using
a stick, the stick is the instrumental
cause for the creation of the pot. In
Sanskrit grammar, the word karana has
a parallel sense; it designates the word
in a sentence that shows how the
action is accomplished.
Karandamakuta
(“basket-crown”) A small crown in the
shape of a basket, notable for its lack of
ornamentation. In Hindu art, the karan-
damakuta is the head covering worn by
a lesser deity. In contrast, the kirita-
makuta worn by the god Vishnu is
much larger and more elaborately deco-
rated, in keeping with his status as one
of the predominant deities in Hindu
religious life.
Karka Sankranti
Date on the Indian calendar marking
the sun’s transition into the zodiacal
sign of Cancer, and thus, the beginning
of the dakshinayana, the six months in
which the sun is traveling toward the
south. In Western astrology this happens
during the summer solstice (around
June 21), but in Indian reckoning it
occurs around July 14. The discrepancy
arises due to the different ways in which
the two systems mark the beginning of
the astrological year. In Western astrology
the beginning of the year is based on the
sun’s position in relation to the earth
and occurs during the vernal equinox
(around March 21). In Indian reckoning
the starting point of the zodiac comes
when the sun intersects the midpoint of
a group of stars named Ashvini, and is
based on the position of the sun with
regard to fixed stars. Karka Sankranti is
not marked by significant observances,
unlike Makara Sankranti, which occurs
six months earlier, marking the
beginning of the sun’s northward
journey (uttarayana). The southern
direction is associated with the god
Yama, who is death personified. Thus,
this southward movement is considered
less auspicious than its northward
counterpart.
Karma
(“action”) The notion of karma and its
connection with reincarnation (sam-
sara) are perhaps the most fundamental
concepts in Indian thought and are
ideas shared by all Indian religions:
Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh.
Although the literal meaning of karma is
“action,” it is believed to encompass
words and thoughts as well as deeds.
The basic assumption behind the
notion of karma is that of a dynamic
universe, in which any action that one
takes will have consequences that will
eventually affect oneself. In the simplest
explanation, good actions will have
good consequences, and evil actions
will have evil consequences, in an
extended chain of cause and effect.
Since thoughts are considered actions,
this determination of “good” and “evil”
actions also takes into account one’s
motives—a laudable action performed
for an ignoble motive is still a laudable
action, but will not generate as much
merit as the same action performed for
a pure motive.
Karma is seen as a purely physical
process, much like the law of gravity. It
does not require a divine overseer,
although in devotional Hinduism, God
is generally seen as having the power to
nullify one’s past karma. The effects of
one’s actions may come either in this life
or in future lives. The former case is easy
to believe, since most people accept that
their actions have consequences, but
the latter case is much more difficult to
support with concrete evidence. Since
the general tone of one’s life is seen as
more important than a few isolated acts,
one might compare the idea of karma
with the notion of a person’s “character.”
Both are determined by one’s habitual

ways of thinking and acting, and entail
an overall assessment of a person. For

Classical Indian Traditions, 1980; and
K. S. Mathur, “Hindu Values of Life:
Karma and Dharma,” in T. N. Madan
(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Karmamarga
(“path of action”) One of Hinduism’s
three generally accepted paths to gain
final liberation of the soul (moksha),
along with the Path of Devotion (bhakti-
marga) and the Path of Wisdom (jnana-
marga). Bhaktimarga stresses devotion
to God, and the jnanamarga stresses
the realization of the ultimate identity
of one’s individual Self (atman)
and Ultimate Reality (Brahman).
Karmamarga emphasizes selfless action
performed for the benefit of others.
Karmendriya
(“organ of action”) In Indian philoso-
phy, any of the five organs through
[[352]]

which human beings act on their envi-
ronment, traditionally considered to be:
voice, hands, feet, and the organs of
elimination and generation.
Karna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Karna is the eldest of
the Pandava brothers, although he is
not aware of his true identity until a few
days before his death. He is born when
his mother, Kunti, in a moment of
youthful impulsiveness, looks upon the
sun while reciting a mantra, giving her
the power to have a son by any of the
gods. She is immediately visited by a
shining figure, who leaves her with an
equally shining son. Distraught and des-
perate at the birth of this child, which as
an unmarried woman she feels she can-
not keep, she puts him in a box and
abandons him in the Ganges.
The child is adopted by the chario-
teer, Adhiratha, who raises Karna as his
own son. Karna later comes to the court
of King Dhrtarashtra, where he
becomes friends with the king’s son,Karnataka
Duryodhana, the epic’s antagonist. While
at court, Karna begins a lifelong conflict
with Arjuna, one of the five Pandava
brothers. Arjuna’s comments about
Karna’s unknown parentage are meant to
deny Karna the recognition he deserves
as Arjuna’s equal. As do all the princes,
Karna studies with Drona, the archery
master. When Drona refuses to teach
Karna the secret of the Brahma weapon
Karna wants to use to kill Arjuna, Karna
goes to the sage Parashuram avatar for
this instruction. He presents himself as a
brahmin, since Parashuram hates the
kshatriya (ruling) class and refuses to
accept any of them as students.
Parashuram teaches Karna all that he
wants to know. During this period, howev-
er, Karna receives two curses that ulti-
mately determine his fate. Karna kills a
brahmin’s cow, so the brahmin curses him
to have his chariot wheel stick in the mud
and be killed upon it by his enemy. The
second curse comes from Parashuram.
One day as Parashuram sleeps with his
head in Karna’s lap, a beetle bores into
Karna’s thigh, which in the epic is a
euphemism for the genitals. Despite the
pain and blood, Karna remains still so he
will not disturb his sleeping guru. When
Parashuram awakens, he realizes that
Karna’s tolerance for pain means that he is
a kshatriya, thus Karna has gained instruc-
tion under false pretenses. Parashuram
curses Karna that at the critical moment,
he will forget everything he has learned.
Both of these curses eventually come true;
despite fighting with great valor in the
Mahabharata war, Karna is killed by
Arjuna when the wheel of his chariot is
stuck in the mud.
On the eve of the great war, Karna’s
mother, Kunti, comes to him and reveals
his true identity and implores him to
return and fight alongside his brothers.
Karna refuses, saying that things have
gone too far for such measures, but
promises Kunti that he will not harm
any of his brothers except for Arjuna,
whom he has sworn to kill. In his deci-
sion Karna is also bound by his loyalty to
Duryodhana, whose friendship and
support for many years overrides any
obligation to a family he has just discov-
ered. As a man willing to stand by his
friends and his principles, even in a
cause he knows to be flawed, Karna
endures as one of the tragic heroes of
the Mahabharata.
Karnaprayag
Himalayan town and sacred site (tirtha)
at the confluence of the Alakananda
and Pindara rivers, in the Chamoli dis-
trict of the state of Uttar Pradesh. As
with all the other river junctions in the
Garhwal region, this is considered an
especially holy place. Local tradition
ascribes the site’s name to the
Mahabharata hero Karna, who is
believed to have worshiped the sun
at this place. In return he received a
suit of armor that could not be pierced
and a quiver of arrows that could
never be exhausted.
Karnata
Southern Indian brahmins who make
up one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are Gujarati, Maharashtri,
Andhra, and Dravida. The core region
for the Karnata brahmins is the modern
state of Karnataka.
Karnataka
One of the four southern Indian states,
whose inhabitants speak a Dravidian lan-
guage, in this case Kannada. Karnataka is
one of the “linguistic” states formed after
India’s independence in 1947, intended to
unite people with a common language and
culture under one state government. The
state was largely formed from the former
kingdom of Mysore. In medieval times,
Karnataka was the seat of important
Hindu kingdoms, particularly the Hoysala
and Vijayanagar dynasties; these dynas-
ties built cities at Belur, Halebid, and
Hampi, which are now important archeo-
logical sites. Karnataka is also the home of
the Lingayats, devotees (bhakta) of Shiva,
whose missionary work eventually
squeezed out the thriving Jain community.

Karnavedha (“ear-piercing”) Samskara
Sculptures decorate the Virupaksha Temple in Pattadakal,
one of many historical sites in the state of Karnataka.
Jain monuments, such as the massive

Karnataka also contains important Hindu
holy places, such as Shrirangapatnam and
Shringeri math. Even though much of the
state’s economy is still highly agricultural,
Karnataka’s capital, Bangalore, is a world-
wide center for computer software devel-
opment. For general information about
Karnataka and other regions of India, see

Planet, 1998.
Karnavedha
(“ear-piercing”) Samskara
The ninth of the sixteen traditional life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
an infant’s ears were pierced. This rite
was done not only for ornamentation
but also for protective purposes.
According to Sushruta, the author of
one of the oldest Indian medical texts,
piercing the ears protected children
against certain ailments. Although in
modern times most young girls have
pierced ears, this practice is far less
common for boys, suggesting that
ornamentation has taken precedence
over protection.

Karni Mata
Presiding deity of the temple by the
same name in the village of Deshnok in
the state of Rajasthan. Karni Mata is a
local form of the Mother Goddess; her
name refers to the place where an ear
(karni) of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth. The temple is unusual in
that it is inhabited by thousands of rats,
which are considered Karni Mata’s sons.
According to the local tradition, Karni
Mata’s son drowned in a local pond.
When she tried to influence Yama, the
god of death, to give her son a favorable
rebirth, she was told that he had already
been reborn as a rat. At her request,
Yama allowed all of her male descen-
dants to be born as rats in the temple at
Deshnok. Yama agreed that in the next
life the rats would be reborn as family
members of the temple’s servants.
According to this myth, the rats and the
temple priests are all members of one
extended family.
Karpatri Maharaj, Swami
A modern-day ascetic noted for the strict-
ness of his ascetic practices. His name
comes from his habit of using his handsKarva Chauth
(kara) as the vessel (patra) in which he
received the food he took as alms. This is
considered one of the strictest ascetic
practices, since the amount of food one
can receive in this way is fairly small. The
lack of an eating vessel indicates complete
renunciation of material possessions.
Swami Karpatri was also known for his
conservative political views. After Indian
independence in 1947, he was one of the
founders of the political party Ram Rajya
Parishad (“Organization for Ram’s Reign”).
The party’s basic assertion was that people
had to follow the division of status and
labor found in the traditional caste system
in order to have a smoothly working soci-
ety. Aside from this conservative social
platform, the party also backed Hindu
causes such as the demand for a total ban
on cow slaughter. Despite being a Sanyasi
who had renounced the world, Swami
Karpatri still maintained some residual
attitudes from his former life. He had been
born a brahmin; even after renouncing the
world, he would only take food from brah-
min houses. Swami Karpatri exemplifies
how many ascetics still retain connections
with the “everyday” world—both in retain-
ing some concern for their former status
and in taking organized political action to
promote causes reflecting deeply
entrenched Hindu values.
Kartigai
Eighth month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Vrschika (the zodiacal sign of
Scorpio), which usually falls within
November and December. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by pre-
serving their traditional calendar. Tamil is
one of the few regional languages in India
with an ancient, well-established literary
tradition. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Kartik
According to the lunar calendar, by which
most Hindu religious festivals are deter-
mined, Kartik is the eighth month in the
lunar year, usually falling within October
and November. In northern India, Kartik
coincides with the harvest when the
weather is quite pleasant. Kartik is one of
the most ritually important months of the
year; its major festivals include Karva
Chauth, Rambha Ekadashi, Narak
Chaturdashi, Diwali, Govardhan Puja
(Annakut), Devotthayan Ekadashi, Tulsi
Vivah, and Kartik Purnima.
Kartik Purnima
Festival during the full moon in the lunar
month of Kartik (October–November),
celebrated as a bathing (snana) festival.
During the festival, an early morning bath
in the Ganges or any other sacred river is
believed to provide the bather with excep-
tional religious merit. People often journey
to sacred rivers to take advantage of this
opportunity. Also on this day, Sikhs cele-
brate the birthday of their religious leader,
Guru Nanak, born in 1469.
Karttikeya
(“son of the Krttikas”) Epithet of the god
Skanda, considered the son of Shiva.
Skanda is not born in the usual manner
but develops when Shiva’s semen falls
into the Ganges River. The name
Karttikeya comes from the six minor god-
desses known as the Krttikas, who are the
deified form of the constellation Pleiades.
After Skanda is born, these goddesses
become his foster mothers and nurse
him, which in Indian culture is believed to
create a mother-child bond. So that none
of the goddesses will feel slighted, Skanda
sprouts six heads, allowing him to nurse
from all of them at the same time.
Karva Chauth
Religious vow (vrat) observed on the
fourth (chauth) day of the dark, waning
half of the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). Karva Chauth is
taken by married women to ensure their
husbands’ health, prosperity, and long life.
There are many such vows in which
women’s observances and sacrifices are
[[355]]
Kashi
channeled into maintaining the welfare
and prosperity of the family. Although
such vows are voluntary in the strictest
sense, there is great social pressure for
women to perform them, thus fulfilling
their expected role as “good” wives. Karva
Chauth is a very strict vow; women observ-
ing it neither eat nor drink until they see
the moon rising that evening. When the
moon appears, the women offer water to it
and then are permitted to drink. On this
evening, women may also worship the
deities Shiva and Parvati (the divine
example of a happily married couple) and
Karttikeya, their son. Women also give
each other small pots (karva) filled with
sweets, hence the festival’s name.
The charter myth for this observance
tells how a young bride, while performing
this fast at the home of her birth, grows
faint and nearly lifeless. Her brothers are
so worried about her health that one of
them climbs into a tree with a lantern,
while the others convince her that the
light is coming from the rising moon. The
young woman is greatly relieved, but as
soon as she drinks water her husband falls
down dead. Her brothers eventually have
to confess what they have done. As the
woman lays lamenting her newly gained
widowhood, she is discovered by the god-
dess Parvati, who assures her that her hus-
band will be restored to life if she faithfully
observes Karva Chauth the following year.
The young woman does as she is told and
regains her husband.
This tale contains significant cultural
information, particularly on people’s dif-
fering obligations. A brother’s duty is to
protect his sister. A wife’s primary duty is
to her husband, and her efforts should be
devoted to his welfare. As in many such
tales, the consequences of failing to keep a
religious observance are swift and severe,
and the rewards from faithfully perform-
ing it are equally grand.
Kashi
(“shining”) One of the traditional names
for the city of Benares. Benares is men-
tioned in the list of the Seven Sacred
Cities, where death brings final liberation
[[356]]

of the soul. In a more strict local sense, the
name Kashi designates the largest of the
three traditional sacred zones in Benares.
It includes everything within the
Panchakroshi Yatra road, a circuit
around the city that marks the outer limit
of the region. The name Kashi refers to the
mythic story of the jyotirlinga, the “pillar
of light” in which the god Shiva is said to
have first appeared. According to tradi-
tion, the pillar of light did not just land in
Kashi but was itself a form of Kashi, thus
indicating the city’s sanctity over all other
places on earth.
Kashmir
One of the three distinct cultural areas,
along with Jammu and Ladakh, in the
modern Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir is a former
princely state, in which the Hindu Dogra
kings also ruled over the minority popula-
tions of the mostly Muslim Kashmiris and
the mostly Buddhist Ladakhis. Since
Indian independence in 1947, this ethnic
and religious division continues to be a
source of trouble, and nowhere more than
in Kashmir. At independence, Pakistan
attempted to take the region by force and
claimed a section of Kashmir. In the time
since then, India and Pakistan have fought
several wars over it; Pakistan claims it by
virtue of their shared religion of Islam;
India claims it by virtue of a document
signed by the last of its kings, Maharaja
Hari Singh. The Kashmiris themselves
have been caught in this regional clash,
and their demands for greater self-deter-
mination have been largely ignored.
After the 1986 state elections, which were
widely regarded as rigged, tensions
in Kashmir came to a boil. Since 1990 the
tension has turned into an open rebellion,
assisted by covert aid from Pakistan.
Most Kashmiris became Muslims
during medieval times. Before that time
the region was a Hindu cultural area.
Kashmir still has some stunning exam-
ples of early Hindu architecture, such as
the sun temple at Martand, a temple to
the god Shiva at Pandrenthan, and the
shrine to Shiva at Amarnath cave whichKataragama
Some pilgrims to the sacred site of Kataragama participate in extreme ascetic practices,
such as swinging from hooks that are pierced through their backs.
is still an important pilgrimage site.
Kashmir also has a minority Hindu pop-
ulation, known as the Kashmiri Pandits.
Recent troubles have prompted many of
them to migrate south to other parts of
India. Although these two communities
profess different religious beliefs, they
share a common language and sense of
Kashmiri identity and culture. For gen-
eral information about Kashmir and
regions of India, see Christine Nivin et
al., India. 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Kashyapa
In Hindu mythology, Kashyapa is the
chief of the Prajapatis (a class of semi-
divine beings) and the father of Garuda,
the divine eagle who serves as the ani-
mal “vehicle” for the god Vishnu.
Kashyapa is also one of the Seven Sages
whose names mark exogamous clan
“lineages” (gotra); the others are
Gautama, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Bhrgu, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brah-
mins are believed to be descended from
these seven sages, with each family tak-
ing the name of its progenitor as its
gotra name. In modern times, gotras are
still important, since marriage within
the gotra is forbidden. After her mar-
riage, the new bride adopts her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
See also marriage prohibitions.
Kataka Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the tips of the fingers are loosely
joined to the thumb, to create a ring (the
word kataka literally means “bracelet”).
This hasta is common in the images of
Hindu goddesses, but also serves a use-
ful purpose: a fresh flower may be
inserted in her hand every day.
Kataragama
Sacred site (tirtha) located in the
extreme southeastern part of Sri Lanka
that is dedicated to the god Skanda in
his southern Indian manifestation as
Murugan. The site is notable for being
outside of the Indian mainland and as
an important place of worship for both
Hindus and Buddhists. According to
[[357]]
Katha
mythic tradition, the site was estab-
lished when Skanda went hunting in
the jungles of Sri Lanka, fell in love
with a tribal woman named Valli, and
vowed to remain forever in her home.
As the son of the god Shiva, Skanda is a
powerful deity in the Hindu pantheon.
His relationship with Valli shows his
accessibility and his love for his devo-
tees (bhakta).
The annual Kataragama pilgrimage
in July–August is a theater to demon-
strate these qualities: Many people
come seeking healing from physical
ailments or deliverance from distress,
while others come to fulfill vows for
benefits already received. Such vows
often take the form of extreme self-
mortification—by carrying the kavadi,
a yoke held in place by hooks piercing
the flesh; by piercing the tongue or
cheeks with tiny arrows, one of the
symbols of Skanda; or by hanging from
hooks embedded in the back and
thighs. These ardent devotees are
reportedly rewarded for their suffering
with a state of ecstasy in which they
feel no pain and suffer no bleeding. In
this state of ecstasy, the devotees are
also believed to be mouthpieces for the
god Skanda. Other pilgrims seek their
advice for every conceivable kind of
problem, under the assumption that
Skanda will give them the most appro-
priate answer. For further information
see Paul Wirz, Kataragama: the Holiest
Place in Ceylon, 1966; and Bryan
Pfaffenberger,
“The
Kataragama
Pilgrimage,” in Journal of Asian
Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2, 1979.
Katha
(“conversation”) Genre of public reli-
gious address based on recitation and
exposition of a religious text. Katha is
most often associated with the
Ramcharitmanas , a version of the
epic Ramayana written by the poet-
saint Tulsidas, but may be used to
explain other religious texts as well.
Kathas may be delivered in a number
of ways: The speaker may go through
[[358]]

large parts of the text, give detailed
analysis and commentary on a very
small portion of the text, select pas-
sages from throughout the text to
illustrate a particular theme, or pre-
sent a completely spontaneous and
free-floating exposition. For listeners,
attending such events is not only aes-
thetically satisfying but also consid-
ered to be a form of satsang or
religious association. Such gatherings
were (and are) one of the major ways
in which illiterate people memorize
large parts of these primary texts. For
further information see Philip
Lutgendorf, The Life of a Text, 1991.
Kathak
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Like much
of traditional Indian culture, classical
dances are identified with certain
regions; Kathak is primarily found in
northern India. Traditionally, Kathak
descended from the ras lilas of Braj,
devotional dances illustrating events
from the life of Krishna. This claim
has little historical support and may
simply reflect the desire to root all of
the Indian arts in religion. It is not dis-
puted, however, that Kathak devel-
oped as an art form in the courts of the
northern Indian princes, where it was
performed for the entertainment of
the monarch and his guests. In time,
two major Kathak centers developed:
Jaipur, famous for spectacular foot-
work; and Lucknow, known for its
attention to acting. Stylistically,
Kathak is marked by an upright pos-
ture, with the legs kept straight. The
dance emphasizes rapid, rhythmic
foot patterns, rhythms accentuated by
strings of bells worn on the dancer’s
ankles and complemented by multiple
turns; the torso is kept fairly immobile.
As with all forms of Indian dance,
Kathak includes a well-developed
“vocabulary” of facial expressions and
gestures of the arms and hands thatKatyavalambita Hasta
allow the dancer to convey a great
range of emotions to the audience. For
further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Kathakali
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathak, and Manipuri. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dances are identified with certain
regions; Kathakali is primarily found
in Kerala. Unlike many of the other
classical forms, Kathakali did not
develop in a temple setting. It
appeared as a developed style in the
seventeenth century, although it is
rooted in folk and religious dramas
dating
from
centuries
before.
Kathakali has traditionally been
danced only by men—the women’s
form in Kerala is Mohini Attam. A
Kathakali performance is one of the
most dramatic spectacles in the
Indian arts. Part of this drama comes
from the dancers’ training, stressing
controlled facial mobility to facilitate
ease and power of expression. The
dancers wear flamboyant costumes
and headdresses. The most striking
feature of all is elaborate makeup—
the heroes’ faces are painted a vivid
green, with fluted ridges made of rice
paste attached to their cheeks, while
villains are painted in green and red
and have knobs of pith attached to
their chins and foreheads. Stylistically,
the dance moves between athletic
jumps and majestic turns, with reli-
gious texts forming the dominant
source for stories. As with all Indian
dances, Kathakali has a well-devel-
oped “vocabulary” of gesture and
facial expression, which makes it pos-
sible for the dancers to engage in
complex storytelling. As with all other
classical dances, Kathakali has under-
gone certain changes in the past gen-
eration, spurred by a shift in the
venue from temple courtyards to
stage performance. For example, a
planned stage performance requires a
well-organized “program” and a desig-
nated time frame, whereas in earlier
times Kathakali performances would
often last all night long. For further infor-
mation see Mohan Khokar, Traditions of
Indian Classical Dance, 1984.
Katha Upanishad
One of the later and more developed
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the latest stratum of the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas. As
with most of the Upanishads, the Katha
Upanishad investigates profound ques-
tions, in particular the nature of the Self
(atman). The text tells the story of a
boy, Nachiketas, whose father sends
him to Death in a fit of anger.
Nachiketas goes to Death’s abode, but
finds no one. He waits for three days
before Death returns. To make amends
for ignoring a brahmin guest—which
the text describes as a serious sin—
Death gives Nachiketas three boons, or
wishes. Nachiketas uses the first boon
to be restored to his father’s house and
the second to receive instruction in
performing a sacrificial fire. With the
final boon, he asks what happens to a
person after the death of the body.
Death first tries to evade the question,
then tries to bribe Nachiketas with
other gifts. When the boy insists on an
answer, Death begins to reveal his
secrets; these revelations make up the
bulk of the text. Death’s secrets focus
mainly on the reality of the Self, its eter-
nal and indestructible nature, its subtle
qualities, and the difficulties in realiz-
ing it. The Self is the ultimate truth, and
to know it is to know the only thing that
really matters.
Katyavalambita Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
the name of a particular hand gesture
(hasta) in which the arm hangs down
beside the body and the hand rests on
the hip in a relaxed manner.
[[359]]
Katyayana Smrti
Katyayana SmrtiKausalya
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed
important but less authoritative than
the other textual category, the shrutis
or “heard” texts. This smrti is attrib-
uted to the sage Katyayana and is an
example of one of the Dharma
Shastras, manuals prescribing rules
for correct human behavior and ideal
social life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras,
which are ascribed to recognizable
individuals, the Dharma Shastras are
usually credited to mythic sages as a
strategy to reinforce the authority of
these texts. Katyayana’s complete text
has not survived, although more than
one thousand verses have been com-
piled from later works. Katyayana’s
text was the first to focus on the rights
of women: he gave particular atten-
tion to women’s personal property
(stridhan), both to explain their pow-
ers and to prescribe rules for its inher-
itance when a woman died.In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kausalya is the first
wife of King Dasharatha and the mother
of the god-king Rama.
Kaurava
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the Kauravas are the
hundred sons of King Dhrtarashtra and
the epic’s antagonists to the Pandava
protagonists. The Kauravas receive their
name as descendants of Kuru, an ances-
tor of King Shantanu. As in many cases
in Hindu mythology, the Kaurava sons
are born in an unusual manner. Their
mother, Gandhari, receives a blessing
(ashirvad) from the sage Vyasa that she
will give birth to one hundred sons. Her
pregnancy lasts for over two years.
When she grows impatient and tries to
hasten the delivery, she gives birth to a
great lump of flesh. Vyasa advises
Gandhari to divide the lump and place
each piece in a pot of clarified butter
(ghee). In due time, each of the 101
pots break open to reveal one hundred
handsome boys, as well as a single
daughter, Dussala. Of these hundred
sons, the most important are the two
eldest, Duryodhana and Duhshasana.
[[360]]

Kaustubha
In Hindu mythology, the gem that the
god Vishnu wears on his chest. The
Kaustubha jewel is one of the precious
things produced by churning the ocean
of milk. Other products include the god-
dess Lakshmi, the Kamadhenu or wish-
ing-cow, and the nectar of immortality
(amrta). Vishnu’s possession of the
Kaustubha jewel is a symbol of his
power and his mastery over the uni-
verse. See also Tortoise avatar.
Kautilya
According to tradition, Kautilya was the
author of the Arthashastra (“Treatise on
Power”), a text which is a handbook on
the exercise of royal power. The ruler
portrayed in the Arthashastra cares little
for ideals or dreams, but rather is willing
to do whatever is necessary to remain in
power. Aside from his authorship of the
Arthashastra, Kautilya is also identified
as the Machiavellian brahmin minister
who
orchestrated
Chandragupta
Maurya’s rise to power, but there are
serious doubts that these Kautilyas are
the same person.
Kavadi
A bamboo yoke topped with semicir-
cular splints of bamboo that is carried
on a devotee’s (bhakta) shoulders dur-
ing certain festivals devoted to the god
Murugan. A kavadi is usually decorat-
ed with flowers, pictures, ribbons, and
other ornaments. A devotee carrying a
kavadi is inviting Murugan to descend
and rest upon it, bestowing his grace
through divine possession. Carrying a
kavadi is usually done to fulfill a vow
often made when asking Murugan for
some favor, such as healing or deliver-
ance from other distress. This can beKavitt
an extremely strenuous rite: Fully
loaded kavadis sometimes weigh one
hundred pounds. The carriers some-
times secure the kavadis by using
metal hooks stuck into the flesh of
their backs and chests. Carrying the
kavadi is seen as an act of devotion
and can be found wherever the wor-
ship of Murugan is popular: in south-
ern India, at Kataragama in Sri Lanka,
in Malaysia, and in South Africa.
Kaveri River
See Cauvery.
Kavi
A word that most literally means “wise
man,” but more commonly refers to a
“poet” or “bard.” This secondary mean-
ing comes from the pan-Indian assump-
tion that the purpose of such poetic
writers was not merely to entertain but
to educate and to uplift.
Kavikarnapura
(mid-16th c.) Author of one version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of the
life of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Kavikarnapura’s text was written in 1542,
nine years after Chaitanya’s death, when
the effort to declare Chaitanya a saint
had already begun. Kavikarnapura freely
acknowledges his debt to an earlier bio-
graphy of Chaitanya, written by Murari
Gupta. He diverges from the earlier text
by portraying Chaitanya as an incarna-
tion of Krishna, descending to earth to
bestow grace on ordinary mortals. As
with the other traditional accounts of
Chaitanya’s life, the author does not
claim this to be an “objective” biography
but instead a hagiography written by a
passionate devotee (bhakta).
Kavitavali
(“series of poems”) The final poetic
work of the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?). In the Kavitavali ,
Tulsidas gives a condensed version of
the epic Ramayana as well as poems
in which he clearly speaks in his own
voice. Evidence in the text indicates
that it was completed after 1615. The
poems are written in the savaiya and
kavitt meters, which are longer, more
complex, and less accessible than the
meters used in most of Tulsidas’s ear-
lier works. The Kavitavali is divided
into seven sections, paralleling the
internal structure of the Ramayana,
but the bulk of the Kavitavali’s poems
are in the last two sections. One of
these is the “Lankakhand,” which
describes the climactic battle symbol-
izing the struggle between good and
evil; in this section the kavitt meter is
used to render vivid battle scenes. The
final book is the “Uttarakhand,” com-
prising more than half of the entire
work. In this last section, Tulsidas has
written some autobiographical verses
and reiterates themes found through-
out much of his work: the degeneracy
of the present age (Kali Yuga), a stress
on devotion as the only means of sal-
vation, and the power inherent in
God’s name, through which any
obstacles can be overcome. Parts
of this latter section sound pes-
simistic, perhaps reflecting the trials
of advancing age, but through it all
comes a note of hope that the author’s
trust in God’s saving power will not
ultimately be in vain.
Kavitt
A particular meter, or rhythm pattern,
in Hindi poetry. Verses composed in
the Kavitt meter have four lines of
thirty-one syllables each, with the
break in each individual line often
coming after the sixteenth syllable.
This is an unusually long meter, thus
lending itself well to extended
descriptions employing alliteration;
in his Kavitavali , the poet-saint
Tulsidas uses this meter with great
affect to describe battle scenes.
[[361]]
Kavya
At an altitude of almost 12,000 feet in the Himalaya Mountains, pilgrims traveling to the
sacred site of Kedarnath must climb a steep path and contend with unpredictable weather.
Kavya
(“related to kavis”) The most general
name for courtly poetry or poetic prose,
most often composed in the Sanskrit
language. Such kavya was usually
[[362]]

written and performed in a court
setting, where innovative reworking of
traditional forms was valued more highly
than originality or self-revelation. The
primary building block in such poetryKedarnath
was the two-line verse, which was a self-
contained unit with regard to meaning.
Verses were composed in meters
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables
per half-line, and were ornamented
with various alamkaras (“figures of
speech”) in an effort to convey the mood
(rasa) appropriate to the subject matter.
Poetic forms range from single-verse
epigrams, such as those of Bhartrhari,
to extended epic poems (mahakavyas),
most notably those of Kalidasa.
Although such poetry contains frequent
references to religious life, it was
primarily intended for entertainment
rather than moral encouragement, an
emphasis which reflects the court
atmosphere in which it was composed.
The singular exception to this trend is
the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva, a text
said to have been composed at the
Jagannath temple in Puri, which focus-
es on devotion to the god Krishna as
lord of the universe.
Kayasth
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
marrying, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). The jatis were organized
(and their social status determined)
by the group’s hereditary occupation,
over which each group held a monopoly.
The Kayasths worked as scribes and
recorders. They were mostly associated
with maintaining business and
mercantile records, accounting, and
keeping businesses running smoothly
and profitably.
Kedarnath
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayas at the headwaters of the
Mandakini River, one of the tributaries
of the Ganges. The village is named for
its presiding deity, who is the god Shiva
in his manifestation as the “Lord of
Kedar.” Shiva is present at Kedarnath in
the form of a linga, a pillar-shaped
image. The Kedarnath linga is deemed
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva. Kedarnath’s sanctity is only
matched by the difficulty in getting to it.
Its high altitude—close to 12,000 feet—
means that it is only accessible between
late April and October, a characteristic
also of Yamunotri, Gangotri, and
Badrinath, the three other major
Himalayan pilgrim sites. A trip to
Kedarnath preserves some of the diffi-
culty
formerly
associated
with
Himalayan pilgrimage. Pilgrims travel
the last ten miles on foot or horseback,
during which the path climbs five thou-
sand feet. Those braving the trek must
contend with the unpredictable moun-
tain weather, but may also be rewarded
with spectacular vistas. The temple of
Kedarnath is surrounded by mountain
meadows and shaded by mountains
capped with snow year-round.
The Kedarnath linga is a natural
ridge of stone considered to be a self-
manifestation (svayambhu) of Shiva,
and is considered to be unusually pow-
erful. The particular shape of this linga is
tied to Kedarnath’s charter myth. One
version of this story is connected to the
five Pandava brothers, who are the pro-
tagonists in the Mahabharata, the later
of the two great Hindu epics. The
Pandavas make their final journey into
the Himalayas, searching for a vision of
Shiva. They finally see him at a distance,
but when they try to get closer, Shiva
takes the form of a bull and begins run-
ning through the snow. The bull burrows
into a snow bank. When the Pandavas
follow, they find the body of the bull in
the snow. The ridge of rock that forms
the Kedarnath linga is considered to be
the hump of this bull. The bull’s head
continues traveling over the hills, even-
tually stopping in Nepal, where it takes
form as Pashupatinath.
A completely different charter myth
draws on the traditional belief that Shiva
makes his home high in the mountains.
This myth identifies the Panchkedar (a
network of five Shiva shrines in the
Garhwal region) with five parts of
Shiva’s body, thus connecting the deity
with the land itself and making the land
[[363]]
Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad
holy. Of these five, Kedarnath is identi-
fied as Shiva’s back, Madmaheshvar
his navel, Tungnath his arm, Rudranath
his face, and Kalpeshvar his matted
locks (jata).
Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad
One of the shorter of the early specula-
tive texts known as the Upanishads,
whose name comes from the first word
of the text itself. The Kena Upanishad is
unusual in that the first two sections are
written in verse, and the third and fourth
in prose. This change gives the text a
somewhat disjointed feel, despite its
brevity, and raises the possibility that it
is a compilation of two earlier texts. As
with many of the later upanishads, the
Kena Upanishad propounds that the
ultimate source of all reality is ascribed
to a single power that can only be dis-
covered through a flash of mystic
insight. The verse sections describe this
power: “It is conceived of by one who
does not conceive of it, it is not con-
ceived by one who conceives, it is not
known by those who think they know it,
it is known by those who think they do
not know it” (verse 2.3). The prose sec-
tions are very different, narrating an
encounter between a mysterious being
(Brahman personified) and several of
the primary gods in the earlier Vedic lit-
erature—Indra, Agni, and Vayu. Despite
all their efforts, the gods are unable to
exercise their respective powers of
storm, fire, and wind, showing that their
divine power is not independently
theirs, but is derived from Brahman.
Kerala
One of the four southern Indian states,
whose inhabitants speak a Dravidian
language, in this case Malayalam. Kerala
occupies the narrow strip of land
between the Western Ghats and the
Arabian sea, in the region formerly
known as the Malabar coast. Kerala is
one of the “linguistic” states formed
after Indian independence in 1947, to
unite people with a common language
[[364]]

and culture under one state govern-
ment. It was created from the
Malayalam-speaking regions of the for-
mer Madras state, plus the princely
states of Travancore and Cochin. Kerala
has always been important as a trading
center. The desire for its spices and san-
dalwood have brought merchants from
the Middle East for thousands of years.
In modern times it has had India’s first
elected communist government, and is
the only Indian state to have 100 percent
adult literacy. Kerala’s most famous
sacred site is the temple of Aiyappa at
Shabari Malai. By custom the annual
pilgrimage to the site is restricted to
men as well as women past child-
bearing age. For general information
about Kerala and other regions of India,
see Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Keshanta (“shaving the beard”)
Samskara
The thirteenth of the sixteen traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras). The
ceremony was performed by a young
man in the brahmacharin (celibate stu-
dent) stage of life and marked the first
time he shaved his beard. According to
tradition, this rite was followed by giving
a gift to the teacher, ideally a cow. By rit-
ualizing his first shave, the keshanta
samskara was a way to mark the young
man’s changing status. After this he was
responsible for remaining clean-shaven,
as one more of the rules for maintaining
ritual purity. In modern times this rite is
no longer observed. See also shaving.
Keshava
([One with] “Flowing Hair”) Epithet of
the god Krishna. See Krishna.
Keshi
In Hindu mythology, Keshi is one of the
assassins sent by Kamsa, the demon-
king of Mathura, in an attempt to kill his
nephew, the child-god Krishna. In the
form of a savage horse, Keshi attacksKhajuraho
Krishna. Krishna easily fends him off
and kills him, earning himself the name
of Keshimanthana, “destroyer of Keshi.”
Keshimanthana
(“destroyer of Keshi”) Epithet of the
god Krishna. Keshi is one of the
demon assassins sent by Krishna’s uncle
Kamsa to kill the child Krishna. Keshi
appears in the form of a horse, but
Krishna easily destroys him, as he does all
the other demons.
Keshini
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
King Sagar. Through a sage’s boon,
Keshini and her co-wife Sumati are
given a choice in the number of children
they will bear—one will bear a single son
through whom the lineage will continue,
whereas the other will bear sixty thou-
sand sons who will die before they
have any offspring. Keshini chooses the
former, and through her son
Asamanjasa the line of King Sagar is
preserved. Her descendants are particu-
larly important, since her great-great-
grandson is the sage Bhagirath, who
succeeds in bringing the river Ganges
from heaven to earth.
Ketu
A malevolent “planet” in Hindu astrology
(jyotisha), and was originally the body
of a demon. According to the story, the
gods and the demons join forces to
churn the ocean of milk to obtain the
nectar of immortality. The gods manage
to trick the demons out of their share.
While the gods drink the nectar, the
demon Sainhikeya slips into their midst
in disguise. As the demon begins to
drink, the sun and moon alert Vishnu,
who uses his discus to cut off the
demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two halves
become immortal, since they have come
into contact with the nectar. The severed
body becomes Ketu, and the severed
head becomes another malevolent
planet, Rahu. Ketu is not regarded as a
physical planet, but as the descending
node of the moon, or the place where it
intersects the ecliptic while passing
southward. Ketu is also associated with
comets and fiery meteors, generally
considered signs of ill omen. See
Tortoise avatar.
Khadga
(“sword”) In Hindu iconography, the
sword is an object associated with a
variety of deities. It carries strong asso-
ciations with Kali, symbolizing the cut-
ting off of her devotees’ (bhakta)
ignorance. Sometimes it is literally used
to cut off heads of the animals sacrificed
to her. The sword is also carried by other
images of the Goddess, including Durga
and Santoshi Ma, as well as certain
images of Shiva and Vishnu.
Khajuraho
Small village in the Chattarpur district of
the northern state of Madhya Pradesh,
renowned for a magnificent collection
of temples built about a thousand years
ago by the Chandella dynasty. It is
unclear why these temples were built in
such an inaccessible place, although its
remote location is believed to have
spared the temples from iconoclasm
during Muslim incursions. The most
famous Hindu temples at the site are the
Kandariya Mahadev, Lakshmana, and
Vishvanath. There are many smaller
temples to other Hindu deities and sev-
eral Jain temples as well.
The temples at Khajuraho were built
in the northern Indian Nagara style. The
building replicates a sacred mountain
with the highest point directly over the
primary image. The outside of the tem-
ples were decorated with sculptural
images, and the most famous of these
depict women in various explicit sexual
encounters. The significance of the erotic
sculptures is much debated. Some claim
that the sculptures sanction carnal plea-
sure as a religious path, while some
interpret them to represent human
union with the divine. Still others view
them as teaching that the desire for
[[365]]
Khandava Forest
pleasure must be transcended to attain
the divine. For further information see
Benjamin Rowland, The Art and
Architecture of India, 1971.
Khandava Forest
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the Khandava forest
is consumed by Agni, a god whose mate-
rial form is fire itself. According to the
story, Agni becomes sick and is advised
that he can only be healed by eating the
creatures in the Khandava forest, many
of whom are enemies of the gods. Agni
makes seven attempts to “eat” the forest,
but is always thwarted by the storm-god
Indra, who rescues the forest by dousing
it with rain. Agni is perplexed and soli-
cits the help of the god Krishna and his
companion Arjuna, the world’s greatest
archer. To help Agni, Arjuna is given the
Gandiva bow and an inexhaustible
quiver of arrows. When Agni again
begins to burn the forest, Arjuna keeps
off the rain by shooting a flight of
arrows so thick that it forms a canopy
over the forest. In this way Agni is cured
of his illness.
Khandoba
Regional deity worshiped in the central
Indian Deccan region, particularly in
the states of Maharashtra and
Karnataka. Originally believed to be a
local deity, Khandoba is now considered
to be an avatar, or incarnation, of the
god Shiva; he takes this form to destroy
two demons named Mani and Malla.
After killing the demons he is persuaded
to reside at a temple in Jejuri,
Maharashtra, from where his worship
spread
throughout
the
region.
Khandoba is an important popular deity
because he is believed to grant people’s
wishes, particularly in response to vows.

Festival,” in Journal of Asian Studies, Vol.

[[366]]

Khara
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Khara is one of the
brothers of the demon-king Ravana.
With his brother Dushana, Khara tries to
avenge the honor of their sister
Shurpanakha, whose ears and nose
have been cut off by Rama’s brother
Lakshmana. In a fierce battle, Rama
destroys the demon army, killing Khara
and Dushana. Seeing the failure of her
two brothers, Shurpanakha goes to their
brother Ravana to demand vengeance.
Ravana realizes he cannot kill Rama in
battle, but resolves to avenge his sister
by kidnapping Sita, an action which dri-
ves the plot for the latter part of the epic.
Kharoshthi
(“ass-lip”) Name for one of the ancient
scripts used in the inscriptions of the
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–232 B.C.E.), the
greatest figure in the Maurya dynasty.
Ashoka’s empire encompassed all of the
subcontinent (except the deepest parts
of southern India) and parts of modern
Afghanistan. Ashoka’s Rock Edicts and
Pillar Edicts are the earliest significant
Indian written documents, giving
invaluable information about contem-
porary social, political, and religious life.
The Kharoshthi script was used exclu-
sively in the northwestern part of
Ashoka’s empire and was clearly derived
from the Aramaic alphabet used in
Achaeminid Persia. Although the script
was modified to adapt it to the sounds of
Indian languages, it clearly shows
Persian cultural influence. It was far less
pervasive than Brahmi script and had
virtually disappeared from India by the
early centuries of the common era.
Khatvanga
A club or staff topped with a human
skull, it is one of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography. At times
the shaft of the staff was made from
another human bone, such as a thigh or
an arm bone. This symbol is most closely
associated with the god Shiva. Its useKirtan
reflects his marginal, uncontrolled
nature and his utter disconnection with
the conventional values of ordinary
society. It is still sometimes carried by
ascetics, for whom Shiva is the model
ascetic, and a paradigm for emulation.
Khetaka
(“shield”) In Hindu iconography, the
shield is associated with a variety of
deities, including the Goddess, Shiva,
and Vishnu. The shield is often found in
images in which the figure carries a
sword (khadga).
as Kindama and his wife are in the form
of deer, King Pandu shoots the copulat-
ing pair with an arrow. In their dying
moments the sage and his wife revert to
their human forms. The sage curses the
horrified Pandu to die the moment he
takes his wife in an amorous embrace.
Since Pandu is childless, he abdicates
the throne in favor of his blind brother
Dhrtarashtra and becomes a celibate
renunciant. Pandu’s wives, Kunti and
Madri, eventually bear children through
magical means. The struggle for
power between their children and
Duryodhana, Dhrtarashtra’s son, is the
epic’s pivotal conflict.
Kichaka
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Kichaka is the brother-
in-law of King Virata. King Virata is host
to the five Pandava brothers (the epic’s
protagonists) during the year that they go
incognito after twelve years of forest
exile. During this time, Kichaka becomes
attracted to Draupadi, the Pandavas’
common wife, who serves as an atten-
dant to one of the royal ladies. Kichaka
continues his advances despite her
protests and strikes her when she tries to
escape. One of Draupadi’s husbands,
Bhima, is livid when he discovers what
has happened. He tells Draupadi to
arrange a secret meeting with Kichaka,
on the pretense of surrendering to his
desires. Bhima disguises himself as
Draupadi and when Kichaka arrives,
Bhima kills him with his bare hands.
Kimpurusha
Another name for the mythical animals
known as Kinnara. See Kinnara.
Kindama
In the Mahabharata, Kindama is a
forest-dwelling sage, whose curse on
King Pandu advances the epic’s plot.
Although celibate in his human form,
Kindama occasionally uses his magic
powers to transform himself and his
wife into animals, so that they can expe-
rience sexual pleasure. On one occasion,
Kinnara
(“What, Man?”) Mythical creatures
described as either having the head of a
horse and the body of a human being, or
the head of a human being and the body
of a horse. The Kinnaras are described as
servants of Kubera, a minor deity.
Kubera is one of the Guardians of the
Directions, a group of eight deities
believed to rule the cardinal and inter-
mediate directions. He is the ruler over
the northern direction, and thus identi-
fied as living in the Himalayas, where
the Kinnaras also live. The Kinnaras are
usually considered identical to the
mythical creatures known as the
Kimpurushas.
Kiritamakuta
A high crown, sometimes topped with
a knob, studded with jewels and
other ornamentation. In Hindu iconog-
raphy the kiritamakuta is associated
with the god Vishnu, particularly in
his manifestation as Narayana. For
Vishnu, the kingly imagery conveyed by
this crown reinforces his claim to be
ruler of the universe.
Kirtan
(“repeating”) A type of devotional
singing or chanting of short verses
which are usually different renditions of
the divine name. This is often done in a
[[367]]
Kirtimukha
Ruins of the Sun Temple in Konarak. Built during the Ganga dynasty,
the temple was designed in the shape of the chariot believed to carry the sun.
call and response fashion—the leader
sings one line, and the listeners repeat it.
The primary emphasis in this rite is the
repetition of the divine name. As the
identifying mark of the divinity, the
Name is believed to contain the divine
power, benefiting those who hear it as
well as those who speak it. Kirtan is
especially popular among the devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, who histor-
ically have put greater stress on the the-
ology of the Name. Kirtan is a common
activity during congregational meetings
known as satsang, the “company of
good people,” believed to have benefi-
cial spiritual effects on those who take
part in them.
Kirtimukha
(“mask of glory”) In Indian architecture,
a kirtimukha is a decorative motif in the
form of a devouring leonine monster. It
often appears as the main decorative
element on a temple tower or as a pro-
tective element over doorways.
Kishkindha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Kishkindha is a
[[368]]

forest-kingdom ruled by monkeys. The
monkey-king, Bali, rules when Rama
(the epic’s protagonist) first comes to
Kishkindha with his brother, Lakshmana,
searching for Rama’s kidnapped wife
Sita. Bali is killed by Rama, and is suc-
ceeded by his brother Sugriva, Rama’s
ally. Sugriva sends his subjects on a
wide-ranging search for Sita. One of
them, Hanuman, eventually discovers
her being held prisoner on Lanka.
Kitawara
One of four major organizational groups
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva; the other three
divisions are Bhuriwara, Bhogawara,
and Anandawara. Each of these
groups has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths)
supposedly established by philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each of the groups
are associated with one of the four
Vedas, one of the “great utterances”
(mahavakyas) expressing the ultimate
truth, a particular ascetic quality, and
several of the ten Dashanami divisions.
The Kitawara group is affiliated with the
Sharada math in Dwaraka, and is thusKota
connected with the western quarter of
India. The Kitawara’s Veda is the Sama
Veda. Their mahavakya is “tattvamasi”
(“That thou art”) and their ascetic quality
is to eat very little. The Dashanami
divisions associated with this group are
Tirtha and Ashrama.
Koil
(also known as Koyal) One of the names
for the Indian cuckoo. See cuckoo.
Kokila
One of the names for the Indian cuckoo.
See cuckoo.
Konarak
Village on the Bay of Bengal in the state
of Orissa, about forty miles east of the
state capital, Bhubaneshvar. Konarak is
famous for its Sun Temple. Now in
ruins, the temple was built by king
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264), a
monarch in the Ganga dynasty. The
entire temple was intended to be a like-
ness of the sun’s chariot. Twelve great
wheels were carved on the sides at the
temple’s lowest level; in front of the tem-
ple are statues of several colossal horses.
As at Khajuraho, the temple’s lower lev-
els are covered with erotic carvings, giv-
ing rise to diverse interpretations: Some
claim the carvings sanction carnal plea-
sure as a religious path, while some
interpret them allegorically as repre-
senting human union with the divine.
Others view them as teaching that the
desire for pleasure must ultimately be
transcended to attain the divine.
The temple was built on a massive
scale. According to one estimate, the
massive central spire would have been
over 200 feet high. It is uncertain
whether this spire was ever completed,
since the sandy soil at its base would
have been unable to support the weight
of such an enormous structure. This
unstable soil has been the greatest
contributor to the temple’s increasing
deterioration. The primary structure left
at the site is the jagamohan (assembly
hall). During the nineteenth century,
the hall was filled with sand in an
effort to prevent further collapse. For
further information see Roy Craven,
Indian Art, 1997.
Konkanastha
Another name for the brahmin commu-
nity of the Chitpavan, a name that signi-
fies their historical home on the Konkan
coastline in the states of Goa and
Maharashtra. See Chitpavan.
Korravai
Fierce form of the Goddess, worshiped
in southern India and originally
believed to have been an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity. Korravai is
associated with the hunt and the battle-
field, and thus with blood, death, and
carnage. Perhaps because of these asso-
ciations, she was later identified with
other fierce manifestations of the
Mother Goddess, particularly the god-
dess Kali.
Koshala
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, this is the name of
the region along the banks of the river
Sarayu in which Rama’s father, King
Dasharatha rules.
Kota
City on the Chambal River in the mod-
ern state of Rajasthan, about 100 miles
south of Jaipur. Before India’s indepen-
dence, Kota was the capital of a small
kingdom with the same name. Kota was
one of the centers of the Rajasthani
style of miniature painting, a genre
used to depict Hindu religious themes,
particularly incidents in the life of
Krishna. The Kota style is considered a
derivative of the Bundi style because
Kota was ruled by a junior member of
the Bundi royal family. Both styles are
marked by their attention to nature,
shown by detailed depictions of trees
surrounding the paintings’ subjects. The
[[369]]
Kratu
Kota style is marked by elements of the
landscape looming out of proportion,
giving the pictures a lush feel. For fur-
ther information see W. G. Archer,
Indian Painting, 1957; and Indian
Painting in Bundi and Kotah, 1959.
Kratu
In Hindu mythology, one of the six
sons of Brahma, all of whom become
great sages. All are “mind-born,” mean-
ing that Brahma’s thoughts are enough
to bring them into being. The other five
sages are Marichi, Angiras, Pulastya,
Pulaha, and Atri.
Krauncha (“Curlew”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography,
Krauncha is the fifth of the seven con-
centric landmasses (dvipas) making up
the visible world. See also cosmology.
Kraunchanishadana
(“curlew-sitting”) One of the sitting pos-
tures (asanas) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras. The Yoga
Sutras are attributed to the sage
Patanjali and give the earliest instruc-
tion of yoga. The Kraunchanishadana
posture begins in dandasana or “stick-
posture,” in which one sits with the
upper body erect, the arms straight with
the hands flat on the ground and point-
ing forward, and the legs outstretched.
From this posture one of the legs is folded
back to the outside, with the heel
pressed against the outer thigh. The
other leg is raised straight up and
pressed against the torso, with the
hands clasped at the bottom of the foot.
Krishna
Hindu deity usually considered as the
eighth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu; in certain religious contexts,
however, as in the Gitagovinda, he is
described as the ultimate deity and the
source of all the avatars. In either case,
Krishna is one of the major deities in the
modern Hindu pantheon. Part of his
[[370]]

popularity may stem from the extraordi-
nary breadth of his manifestations,
allowing his devotees (bhakta) to wor-
ship him in many different ways. His
earliest appearance comes in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, where he is a friend and
adviser to the five Pandava brothers
who are the epic’s protagonists. His epic
portrayal is highly complex, and his
character is not always truthful or good.
He is a regal king and heroic warrior, a
cunning opponent, and a Machiavellian
politician with his own underlying
agenda. Here Krishna plays the role of
a trickster, although late in the story,
in the section of the epic known as
the Bhagavad Gita, he eventually drops
the mask to reveal himself as the
supreme deity.
The later sectarian literature, partic-
ularly the Harivamsha and the
Bhagavata Purana, virtually ignore
this exalted, royal figure, preferring to
concentrate on Krishna’s birth, child-
hood, and adolescence. This latter
stratum of Krishna’s mythology has
been clearly imposed on the earlier,
heroic image, rendering Krishna a char-
acter with unusual mythic depth.
Religiously speaking, the image of
Krishna as child and lover has been far
more important than the stern and
somewhat amoral hero.
The characters in the story of
Krishna’s life, including his parents,
friends, and companions, are not aware
of his divinity, and throughout the story
they confront many surprises and bewil-
dering events. However, none of these
plot twists surprise the readers, since
they are aware that all of the characters
are taking part in Krishna’s divine play
(lila). According to tradition, Krishna is
the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva.
He is born in a prison in the city of
Mathura, where his parents have been
confined by his uncle, the wicked king
Kamsa. On Devaki’s wedding day, a
divine voice warns Kamsa that her
eighth child will eventually kill him. In
an effort to forestall this prophecy, he
puts the couple in prison, and kills all ofKrishna
Devaki’s children as soon as they are
born. Kamsa intends to do the same
with Krishna, but when Krishna is born,
a deep sleep falls on all the jailers, the
locked prison doors are miraculously
opened, and Vasudeva is able to spirit
the infant out of the prison to the home
of his foster parents, Nanda and
Yashoda. Vasudeva returns that night,
bearing Yashoda’s newborn baby girl,
who is really Bhadrakali, the Goddess,
in disguise. The next morning Kamsa
kills the child by dashing it against a
stone. From the body arises the Goddess,
who taunts Kamsa, telling him that the
person who will slay him has escaped.
Krishna lives happily at Nanda and
Yashoda’s home. His mythic images
from that early time stress either his per-
sona as the adorable child or unexpected
feats of strength and heroism. As an
infant he is placed under a cart, which
he strikes with his foot and kicks into the
air; he also slays a variety of demon
assassins sent by his uncle Kamsa, most
notably Putana, Keshi, and Trnavarta.
During all these feats his companions
are amazed but never realize that divin-
ity is in their midst. Nor, for that matter,
do his foster parents. In one story
Yashoda looks in Krishna’s mouth when
he has been eating some dirt and sees
the entire universe inside it. Through
the workings of Krishna’s power of illu-
sion (maya), she immediately forgets
the whole incident. The themes of for-
getfulness and hidden divinity are cen-
tral to Krishna’s childhood mythology.
The people in Braj treat Krishna with
easy familiarity, because they are
unaware of his true identity. Krishna is
said to prefer this sort of natural interac-
tion over all other worship.
As a boy Krishna becomes known for
his mischief, particularly his penchant
for stealing butter from the gopis (milk-
maids), although when he is caught he
can usually manage to charm his way
out of punishment. His adolescence is
marked by two heroic episodes—driving
off the serpent Kaliya, and defeating the
storm-god Indra by holding up Mt.
Depiction of Krishna, an incarnation
of the god Vishnu.
Govardhan—and by the development of
his persona as a lover. On moonlit,
autumn nights, he plays his flute Murali
on the banks of the Yamuna River.
Hearing its irresistible call, the village
women rush to meet him, whiling away
the night in the circle dance known as
the ras lila. Although she is not men-
tioned in the earliest texts, Radha
appears as Krishna’s special companion
and consort, symbolizing the relation-
ship between deity and devotee using
the imagery of lover and beloved.
Some parts of Krishna’s mythology
relate episodes from later in his life,
including his return to Mathura, the
slaying of Kamsa, taking his rightful
place as ruler, and marrying Rukmini
and a host of other wives. The earlier
strands of his mythic identity—the king,
hero, and cunning diplomat portrayed
in the Mahabharata—can be tied in
here, to make it seem like the account of
a single life. Some of the most poignant
devotional (bhakti) poetry details the
exchange between Krishna’s female
devotees, the gopis, and Uddhava,
Krishna’s companion sent back from
[[371]]
Krishnadas
Mathura. Uddhava reassures them that
Krishna is the indwelling God and is
omnipresent. For the gopis, this abstract
concept is a poor substitute for the
sweet boy they know so well. Their
attention remains focused on the
charming child of Braj, who never grows
up, never grows old, and who invites his
devotees to share his world.
The worship of Krishna emphasizes
relationship and communion, both
with the deity and one another. In the
most elaborate forms of worship,
Krishna’s devotees envision themselves
as entering Krishna’s world and spend-
ing the day doing the ordinary activities
of a village cowhand, such as getting up,
eating, taking the cows to pasture,
and bringing home the cows. Some
devotional manuals give detailed daily
calendars, for which the devotees
can visualize themselves going to par-
ticular places and doing particular
things at certain times—building a rela-
tionship with God through sharing the
mundane parts of everyday life.
Another common practice is communal
singing, usually collections of the divine
names known as kirtans, as a way to
build relationships and communion
among the devotees.
Another feature of Krishna’s charac-
ter and worship is the notion of lila or
“play.” As David R. Kinsley points out,
the infant Krishna dispatches the demon
assassins as a form of play, and they
never pose any serious threat. His rela-
tionship with the people of Braj is also a
sort of play. He comes as the divine pres-
ence in their midst, but keeps them
completely unaware of this, occasional-
ly hinting at it through his wondrous
deeds, but unwilling to ruin their natur-
al interactions with him by revealing
their difference in status. In the same
way, he is believed to be active in the
lives of his devotees, always present, but
dropping only teasing hints of his pres-
ence. Finally, lila is the name for a series
of dramas performed during the mon-
soon season in the town of Brindavan.
These productions, known as the ras lila,
are not mere drama but combine both
[[372]]

liturgy and drama. Krishna and his com-
panions are played by local brahmin
boys. While in costume, the boys are
believed to have become the characters
they portray. Part of the program is wor-
ship. The players, known as svarups
(“own-forms”), gather on stage to give
darshan to the audience. The most
common religious act in modern popu-
lar Hinduism, darshan allows direct eye
contact between the devotee and the
image of a deity, which is considered to
be a conscious, perceiving being. The
second part of the program is the lila, a
rendition of some episode in Krishna’s
mythology. The audience participates
by virtue of its presence, making
Krishna’s lila part of present-day experi-
ence by performing or attending these
productions. Given his stature as a
Hindu deity, there are many works on
Krishna. For further information see

Krishnadas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions
of these eight poets were used for
liturgical purposes by the Pushti
Marg, a religious community of devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all
eight are also named as members of
the community and as associates of
either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. Traditionally, Krishnadas
is associated with Vallabhacharya. Little
is known about Krishnadas, although
traditional accounts hold that he was
born in 1497. His poetry describes the
physical beauty of Krishna as an object
of aesthetic enjoyment. Within the
Pushti Marg, he is remembered as a
capable administrator and a defender of
the sect’s interests in Brindavan,Krishnamishra
Krishna’s childhood home, against the
followers of Chaitanya.
Krishnadas Kaviraj
Author of the most influential version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of
the life of the Bengali poet-saint
Chaitanya, written about ninety years
after Chaitanya’s death. Krishnadas’s
text is the latest and most developed
biography of Chaitanya and focuses
mainly on Chaitanya’s later life, particu-
larly his visit to Brindavan, the northern
Indian village were the god Krishna
is supposed to have spent his
childhood. This text is marked by the
philosophical influence of the three
Goswamis—Rupa, Sanatana, and
Jiva—whose ideas played a major role in
shaping Chaitanya’s religious followers,
the Gaudiya Vaishnavas. As with the
other traditional accounts of Chaitanya’s
life, this text does not purport to give
an “objective” biography, it is rather
a hagiography (an idealizing and
idolizing portrait) written by a
passionate devotee (bhakta).
Krishna Deva Raya
(r. 1509–1530) Most important ruler in
the Vijayanagar dynasty, the last of the
great southern Hindu kingdoms.
During his rule, Vijayanagar reached its
zenith. Krishna Deva Raya defeated the
Deccani sultans to the north, although
he reinstated them as vassals. He con-
quered the eastern coast all the way to
Orissa and maintained good trading
relationships with the newly-arrived
Portuguese, although he refused to
become involved in their politics. His
reign was a time of artistic achieve-
ment and general prosperity, evident
in the artifacts of the time. His succes-
sors were not as successful, however.
Less than forty years after his death,
the coalition of the Deccani sultans
defeated Rama Raja at the battle of
Talikota. The Vijayanagar kingdom was
completely destroyed.
Krishna Janam Bhumi
Site in the city of Mathura believed to
mark the spot where the god Krishna
was born. The present temple was com-
pleted in the 1960s, but the site itself is
very old. One of the most religiously
volatile sites in all of India, the new tem-
ple abuts the Shahi Idgah, a mosque
built on the base of an earlier Krishna
temple. According to one tradition,
Muslim iconoclasts destroyed four suc-
cessive temples at the spot now occu-
pied by the mosque, marking the exact
location of Krishna’s birth. This claim
seems doubtful since the mosque was
built in 1661, and the temple it is said to
have replaced was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb in 1669. In
the 1980s the Krishna Janam Bhumi was
one of the three sites selected by the
activist Vishva Hindu Parishad to be
reclaimed as a Hindu holy place, along
with the Vishvanath temple in Benares,
and Ayodhya’s Ram Janam Bhumi. In
all of these places, mosques were
claimed to have been built on the site of
an important Hindu temple, although
only the first two have historical evi-
dence that this occurred. During the
[[1990]]
s there have been several cam-
paigns to reclaim the Krishna Janam
Bhumi, but to this point the campaigns
have generated little support. Given the
popular backlash after the 1992 destruc-
tion of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the
government has been far more restric-
tive on the activities it allows at such dis-
puted sites. For further information see
Christophe Jaffrelot, The Hindu
Nationalist Movement in India, 1996.

Krishnamishra
(late 11th c.) Author of the Sanskrit
drama Prabodhachandrodaya (“Rising
of the moon of wisdom”), an allegory
celebrating the triumph of Vaishnava
piety. The play is noted for the third act,
in which four representatives of non-
Vaishnava sects appear: a materialist; a
Jain monk; a Buddhist monk; and a
Kapalika, a member of an ascetic
[[373]]
Krishnamurti, Jiddu
community who worshiped the god
Shiva. The last is portrayed as depraved,
indulging in meat, wine, and sexual
gratification, as well as having a
penchant for violence. Although the
reader may safely assume that this is a
biased perspective, it is instructive in
the attitudes it reveals toward ascetics
and all non-Vaishnava religious groups.
Krishnamurti, Jiddu
(1895–1986) Modern Indian thinker
whose teachings centered on the neces-
sity for personal realization through
critical self-awareness. His teaching had
strong roots in his own life experience.
When he was fourteen years old, one of
the leaders of the Theosophical Society,
Annie Besant, proclaimed him to be an
incarnation of the future Buddha
Maitreya. He later repudiated these
claims, and for the rest of his life
stressed the need to examine and
question all authority, including
himself. Much of his life was spent in
Europe and the United States, where his
books and lectures found their primary
audience. For further information see
Pupul Jayakar, Krishnamurti: A
Biography, 1986.
Krishna Paksha
The dark or waning half of a lunar month.
Krishna River
River running from west to east in south
central India. Its headwaters lie in
Maharashtra on the inland side of the
Western Ghats. It meanders through
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, forti-
fied by the Bhima River and the
Tungabhadra River, before entering the
sea in the Bay of Bengal. The temple of
the god Vithoba in the town of
Pandharpur, considered the most
important sacred site (tirtha) on the
whole river, lies on the Bhima River.
[[374]]

Krittikas
In Hindu mythology, the Krittikas are a
group of six minor goddesses who are
the personification of the constellation
Pleiades. Their important mythic
appearance is as the foster mothers of
the god Skanda. Skanda is considered
the son of the god Shiva, but is born in
an unusual way. When Shiva and Parvati
are disturbed while making love, Shiva
inadvertently spills his semen on the
ground. In Indian culture semen is seen
as a man’s concentrated essence.
Because he is a deity, Shiva’s semen is
inordinately powerful, capable of
destroying the earth. The semen is first
held by the god Agni, who is fire person-
ified, but it proves too powerful for him.
Agni puts the semen in the river Ganges.
After 10,000 years, a shining child is dis-
covered in the reeds along the riverbank.
The child is discovered by the Krittikas,
each of whom wants to nurse him. To
oblige them, the child Skanda grows five
extra heads. As a mark of their care, one
of his epithets is Karttikeya.
Krpacharya
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Krpacharya is a
famous archer who teaches both the
Pandavas and the Kauravas, the two
competing families in the epic.
Krpacharya is a supporter of the
Kaurava leader Duryodhana. During
the year the Pandavas spend in hiding,
he sends spies to try to find them. In the
Mahabharata war he fights on the side
of the Kauravas. His most important act
is setting fire to the Pandava camp dur-
ing the night attack following the
Pandava victory. All those trying to flee
the flames are killed. After the war he
stays for some time at the court of
Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother,
but later renounces the world to live in
the forest.Kshatriya
Krta Yuga
A particular age of the world in one of
the reckonings of cosmic time.
According to traditional belief, time has
neither beginning nor end, but alter-
nates between cycles of creation and
activity, followed by cessation and qui-
etude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32
billion years; the active phase is known
as the Day of Brahma, and the quiet
phase as the Night of Brahma. In one
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of
Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas, named the Krta Yuga,
Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali
Yuga. Each of these four yugas is shorter
than its predecessor and ushers in an
era more degenerate and depraved than
the preceding one. By the end of the Kali
Yuga, things have gotten so bad that the
only solution is the destruction and
recreation of the earth, at which time
the next Krta era begins.
The Krta Yuga is the first of the four
yugas, and at 1,728,000 years, it is by far
the longest. It is also considered to be
the best of all the yugas, symbolized by
gold, the most valuable of all metals. In a
dice game played in ancient India, the
side designated Krta was the one for the
winning throw, representing the best
possible option. In the mythic descrip-
tions of the Krta Yuga, people live
extremely long times, are of tremendous
physical stature, and by nature, are com-
pletely virtuous.
Kshanika (“momentary”) Linga
A type of linga, the pillar-shaped object
symbolizing the god Shiva. A kshanika
linga is temporarily made for immediate
worship, from whatever materials are at
hand—whether earth, sand, grain, but-
ter, or any other substance that can be
heaped and molded. This use of tempo-
rary images reveals an important aspect
of Hindu religious life—that although
God is everywhere, many human beings
tend to work better when they have a

from Maharashtra to the Bay of Bengal.
concrete focus for their religious atten-
tion. This being so, God deigns to come
into the humblest objects, if they are
created with him (or her) in mind.
Kshatriya
In traditional Hindu social theory, the
kshatriyas were the second most influ-
ential of the four major social groups
(varnas). The kshatriyas’ function was
ruling, protecting, and creating social
order so that the other varnas could
carry out their tasks. This image is
reflected in the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta. The kshatriyas are
described as being created from the
Primeval Man’s shoulders and associat-
ed with strength and power. In actual
practice, the kshatriya varna may have
been the most permeable of all, since
any person with the power to rule was
usually given de facto kshatriya status,
which could be solidified by a fictitious
genealogy in the following generations.
Perhaps the best example of this phe-
nomenon is the subgroup known as the
Rajputs (“king’s sons”), who at varying
[[375]]
Kshemaraja
times ruled large sections of northern
and western India, but whose origins are
unclear and obscure.
Kshemaraja
(11th c.) Kshemaraja was the primary
disciple of Abhinavagupta, the
Kashmiri writer famous for his works on
poetics and aesthetics, and a pivotal fig-
ure in the development of Trika
Shaivism. Based on a tantric philoso-
phy, Trika Shaivism states that the sole
true reality is the god Shiva, who is both
supreme god and the source of the ema-
nations that constitute the material of
the universe. Final liberation of the soul
(moksha) comes through a process of
“recognition” (pratyabhijna) in which
one realizes that the entire universe is
all a manifestation of Shiva alone.
Here one “recognizes” something that
has always been true, but until that
time has been obscured by a mistaken
understanding. Kshemaraja contin-
ued the development of the Trika
school. His most famous work is the
Svacchandatantra. See also tantra.
Kubera
In Hindu mythology, a minor deity who
is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions, serving as guardian over the
northern quarter. Kubera is said to live
in the Himalaya mountains, where he is
served by mythical creatures such as
yakshas, nagas, and kinnaras. He is
enormously fat, and because of all the
mineral wealth contained in the moun-
tains, he is enormously wealthy. Kubera
is the half-brother of the demon-king of
Lanka, Ravana, and Kumbhakarna and
Vibhishana. All four are sons of the
demigod Vishravas, but Kubera has a
different mother. Despite their relation-
ship, Ravana steals Kubera’s aerial chariot,
the Pushpak Viman. Because of
Ravana’s notorious misdeeds, Kubera
supports the god-king Rama’s efforts to
conquer Ravana.
[[376]]

Kubja
(“hunchback”) In the mythology of the
god Krishna, Kubja is a hunchbacked
woman whom Krishna meets while
journeying to the city of Mathura to
reclaim his kingdom. Kubja carries a jar
of expensive salve that is meant for the
king, but when Krishna asks her for
some, she willingly gives it to him. As a
reward for her generosity and devotion,
Krishna straightens her spine, turning
her into a gorgeous young woman.
Kuchela
(“badly dressed”) Another name for
Sudama, one of the god Krishna’s child-
hood friends. See Sudama.
Kuchipudi
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam,
Kathak,
Orissi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dance shows strong regional identifica-
tion; Kuchipudi is primarily found in
Andhra Pradesh. As with much of
Indian dance, Kuchipudi has its roots in
religious life. It was developed in the vil-
lage of Kuchipudi as part of a religious
festival. The Maharaja of Golconda was
so pleased with the dance that he
awarded the village as a gift to the brah-
min families there, with the condition
that they continue to nurture the art,
which their descendants have done.
Stylistically, the dance shows the influ-
ence of Bharatanatyam, and like all
Indian dance, it shows the well-developed
vocabulary of gesture that is drawn from
the classical manuals. At the same time,
the form is softer and less geometric
than Bharatanatyam, showing the
influence of folk traditions. The lan-
guage for the dance-dramas is Telegu,
reflecting the local culture. As with all
classical dances, Kuchipudi has under-
gone certain changes in the past gener-
ation, spurred by the shift to stage
performance as the dance’s primary
venue. One of the most significantKumarasambhava
changes has been to open the dance to
women. For further information see
Mohan Khokar, Traditions of Indian
Classical Dance, 1984.
Kulachara
(“family practice”) Any religious practice
restricted to a family, either a group of
blood relatives or people sharing a com-
mon religious or sectarian lineage. The
authority given to kulachara allows for
almost infinite variation in religious
practice, particularly in the absence of
any established religious hierarchy
which has the authority to render judg-
ments on such practices. For most
Hindus, such family practice is the pre-
dominant influence shaping their indi-
vidual religious lives.
Kuladevata
(“family deity”) The particular deity
worshiped by a family, whether this
“family” be blood relatives, or people
who share the same religious lineage,
sect, or region. In most cases, the
kuladevata will be one’s primary deity.
Kulashekhara
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, emphasiz-
ing passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language. According
to tradition, Kulashekhara was the king
of the Travancore region in modern
Kerala. His religious commitment grew
so strong that he eventually abdicated
his throne. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;
and John Stirling Morley Hooper, Hymns
of the Alvars, 1929.
Kulu
The most important city in the Kulu
Valley in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
The city of Kulu is famous for its
Dussehra festival. Dussehra celebrates
the victory of the god Rama over the
demon-king Ravana; it is a celebration
of the victory of good over evil. Kulu’s
festival centers around the figure of
Rama from the Raghunathji temple in
the nearby village of Dhalpur. When
Rama is brought to the festival site in his
temple car, he is celebrated by hundreds
of deities who have come from temples
up and down the Kulu Valley, as well as
the people who have gathered to see the
deities and the spectacle of their proces-
sion. The deities’ actions are carefully
choreographed according to well-estab-
lished rituals.
Kumara
(“youth”) Epithet of the god Skanda,
who is usually portrayed in the form of a
young boy. See Skanda.
Kumara Gupta I
(r. 415–454) The fourth important ruler
of the Gupta dynasty, who managed to
keep his northern Indian empire intact
for most of his reign. At the end of his
reign, he had to contend with incursions
in the west by the central Asians, known
as the Hunas. While in battle with them,
he was killed. Pressure from the Hunas
continued in the years following
Kumara Gupta’s death and was one of
the important factors causing the even-
tual collapse of the Gupta empire sever-
al generations later.
Kumarapala
(r. 1143–1172) Jaina king of the
Chalukya dynasty in Gujarat, who was
so committed to nonviolence that he
imposed heavy fines on people who
killed fleas and other vermin.
Kumarasambhava
(“Birth of the Prince”) One of the
finest poetic works written by Kalidasa,
who is generally considered the
greatest classical Sanskrit poet. The
Kumarasambhava is an epic poem
[[377]]
Kumarila
based on a mythological theme. It
begins by describing the ascendancy of
a demon named Taraka, who receives a
divine boon that he can only be killed by
a son of Shiva. The poem describes the
extended courtship of Shiva and
Parvati, their marriage, and ends with
an account of their lovemaking. The text
ends before the birth of the god Skanda,
who in other mythical accounts of this
tale kills Taraka. This abrupt ending has
led some interpreters to consider the
play unfinished. Others simply view
these later events as a foregone conclu-
sion, by which the poet does not waste
his hearers’ time.
Kumarila
In Indian philosophy, one of the two
great seventh-century commentators of
the Mimamsa philosophy, one of the six
schools of Hindu philosophy; the other
great commentator was Prabhakara.
The Mimamsa school was most con-
cerned with the examination and pur-
suit of dharma (“righteous action”), for
which members believed all necessary
instructions were contained in the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Consequently, much of Mimamsa
thought is concerned with principles
and methods of textual interpretation to
uncover and interpret the Vedic instruc-
tions. Although both Kumarila and
Prabhakara were committed to discov-
ering the boundaries of dharma by
interpreting the Vedas, there are signifi-
cant differences in their philosophical
positions, which show up most clearly in
their theories of error.
Prabhakara begins with the assump-
tion, similar to the Nyaya concept of
inherence (samavaya), that there is a
relatively
weak
correspondence
between an object and its attributes. An
example of this would be the relation of
the color red to a particular ball, such
that the ball is said to be red. According
to Prabhakara, false beliefs result from
akhyati (“nondiscrimination”). This
occurs when a person observes two dif-
ferent things with the same attributes
[[378]]

and concludes that they are the same.
Kumarila is closer to the bhedabhada
(“identity and difference”) philosophical
position, which holds that all things
have both identity and difference with
all other things. Kumarila explains error
as viparitakhyati (“contrary percep-
tion”), in which one mistakenly pairs up
the similarities between two things,
rather than noting their differences. For
example, a person mistakenly believes
that a shell with a silvery color is actual-
ly a piece of silver because he or she
chooses to focus on the similarities
between the shell and silver rather than
the differences. People are impelled to
make these choices by karmic forma-
tions, such as greed for silver.
Kumbhadas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these poets were used for liturgical purpos-
es by the Pushti Marg, a religious commu-
nity whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of Krishna. In the Pushti Marg’s sectarian
literature, all eight poets are named as
members of the community and as associ-
ates of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor, Vitthal-
nath. Kumbhadas is traditionally associat-
ed with Vallabhacharya. Little is known
about Kumbhadas, although it is believed
that he was born in 1469. His poetry
describes the five modes of devotion
described by Rupa Goswami, particularly
the mode known as madhurya (“hon-
eyed”). Madhurya describes the relation-
ship between deity and devotee, using the
language of lover and beloved, in which
each has passionate love for the other.
Kumbhakarna
(“Pitcher-eared”) In the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics,
Kumbhakarna is the brother of Ravana,
the demon ruler of Lanka. As his name
indicates, his dominant facial feature
is his prominent ears. Kumbhakarna is
a reincarnation of Vijaya, Vishnu’sKumbha Mela
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be
reborn three times as a demon, killed
by the god Vishnu each time.
Kumbhakarna and his brothers have
performed harsh asceticism (tapas) in
their youth to gain boons from the gods.
When the god Brahma finally comes to
give him boons, Kumbhakarna means to
demand “nirdevatvam” (that he cannot
be conquered by any of the gods). At the
critical moment he is foiled by the god-
dess Saraswati, who has power over
speech. She dances on his tongue and
confuses his speech, causing him to
request “nidravatvam” (sleepiness).
Because of this slip of his tongue,
Kumbhakarna will sleep for six months
at a time, wake up to gorge himself with
food and drink for a short time, and then
fall asleep again. Some of the dramatic
tension in the battle portions of the
Ramayana pertains to the violent efforts
to rouse Kumbhakarna, so that he can
take part in the battle. Once awakened
he fights valiantly, but is eventually
killed by Rama.
As is true for all the demons,
Kumbhakarna is not wholly evil. Before
engaging in battle with Rama’s army,
he rebukes Ravana for kidnapping
Rama’s wife, Sita. He also notes that as
the younger brother it is his duty to
uphold the family honor. Here we find
the demon Kumbhakarna upholding
idealized Indian family values—the
younger brother is supposed to sup-
port and defend his elder brother’s
interests as a way to keep the family
intact. This same virtue is in Rama’s
younger brothers, Lakshmana and
Bharata. Despite their enmity, the
epic’s “heroes” and “villains” have sig-
nificant shared values.
Kumbhakonam
One of the many temple-towns in the
Tanjore district of the state of Tamil
Nadu, reflecting the district’s impor-
tance as the home of the Chola dynasty
kings. Kumbhakonam has several large
temples. Built in the Dravida architec-
tural style, the temple buildings are of
modest height, cover an immensely
large area, and are surrounded by a
boundary wall with massive towers
(gopurams) over each wall’s central
gateway. Kumbhakonam’s most famous
site is not a temple, but a temple bathing
(snana) tank. A festival is held at the
tank every twelve years, at which time
the water in the tank is believed to
become the Ganges. An estimated
[[400]]
,000 people attended this event in
[[1992]]
; tragically, forty-eight people were
killed in a stampede. Outside the town is
the Swami Malai temple, one of the six
temples to the god Skanda.
Kumbha Mela
(“Festival of the Pot”) A religious festival
celebrated in four different locations:
Haridwar, Allahabad, Ujjain, and
Nasik. The first two sites are by far the
most important, with Allahabad consid-
ered the holiest of all. Attendance at
these festivals is great. In 1998, ten mil-
lion people were in Haridwar on the cli-
mactic day. Both of these sites also host
an Ardha (“half”) Kumbha Mela, gener-
ally six years after the full Kumbha Mela,
which are smaller in scale, but can still
draw millions of pilgrims. At Ujjain and
Nasik, the full Kumbha Melas are not as
well attended than at the other two sites.
The Kumbha Mela is a bathing
(snana) festival; it is for this reason
that all the Mela sites are found near
rivers. The Kumbha Mela’s primary
actors are ascetics from all over South
Asia who come to bathe in the sacred
waters. According to tradition, the
Kumbha Mela was organized by the
great philosopher Shankaracharya to
promote regular gatherings of
learned and holy men, as a means to
strengthen, sustain, and spread
Hindu religious beliefs. The Kumbha
Mela is also a time for these ascetics
to display their status vis-à-vis one
another. At each site, the order in
which the different ascetic sects
bathe is strictly enforced—the most
important sects bathe first. In more
recent times, this order has been
[[379]]
Kumbha Mela
The bathing procession in Haridwar during the Kumbha Mela festival.
The differing ascetic orders proceed toward the holy waters according to a traditionally sanctioned order.
enforced by the government. In earlier
times, it was the subject of much dispute,
often degenerating into armed conflict as
different ascetic sects vied with one
another for the place of pride.
The time for each Kumbha Mela fes-
tival is determined astrologically, based
on the positions of the planet Jupiter,
the sun, and the moon. The Mela is held
at Haridwar when Jupiter is in Aquarius
(Kumbha) and the sun enters Aries; at
Allahabad when Jupiter is in Taurus and
the sun and moon are in Capricorn; at
Ujjain when Jupiter is in Leo and the full
moon appears in the lunar month of
Baisakh; and at Nasik when Jupiter is in
Leo during the lunar month of Shravan.
These alignments occur about every
twelve years.
The charter myth for the Kumbha
Mela is taken from the story of Churning
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has
been churned and the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta) has been extracted, the
gods and their demon opponents begin
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The
gods snatch the pot and make off with
it, but the person carrying the pot
[[380]]

grows tired, and in twelve days of carry-
ing it sets it on the ground four times—
namely, at the four sites where the Mela
is held. In each place a bit of the
nectar splashes on the ground,
sanctifying the site. According to popu-
lar belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most
propitious moment, the waters in which
people are bathing become the nectar
of immortality, and all those who
bathe in these waters gain immeasur-
able religious merit.
Kumbha Mela is considered the
largest religious festival in the world.
Arrangements for the Melas at Haridwar
and Allahabad are made by the govern-
ment of Uttar Pradesh, coordinating
transportation, drinking water, and san-
itation for millions of pilgrims, as well as
building temporary cities for the
visitors. Ascetics come from all over
the subcontinent, some staying for
months. Many religious organizations
set up booths in an effort to publicize
their message.
Recently the government has begun
using the Mela to promote ideas such as
family planning and cleaning up theKundalini Yoga
Ganges, as well as promoting the Mela
as tourism, spurring economic develop-
ment. This combination of business and
religion has roots in the past; in the early
nineteenth century, the annual spring
bathing fair at Haridwar was also a trad-
ing fair, particularly for horses. For many
people, the opportunity to view the
spectacle of the Mela is at least as strong
an inducement as the promise of
bathing away their sins. See also
Tortoise avatar.
Kumhar
Traditional Indian society was as a col-
lection of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
Jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
held a monopoly. The Kumhars’ heredi-
tary occupation was making pottery.
Kunbi
Traditional Indian society was as a
collection of endogamous subgroups
(in which marriage is decreed by law
to occur only between members of
the same group) known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. The Kunbis’
traditional occupation was farming.
They were the dominant landholding
community in Gujarat.
Kundalini
(“spiral”) Kundalini, the latent spiritual
power that exists in every person, is one
of the most fundamental concepts in
tantra. It is the most vital element in the
subtle body, an alternate physiological
system believed to occupy a different
plane of existence than gross matter, but
which has certain correspondences to
the material body. The subtle body is a
set of six psychic centers (chakras),
visualized as multi-petaled lotus flowers
running along the spine and connected
by three vertical channels. Each of the
chakras symbolize human capacities,
subtle elements (tanmatras), and
sacred sounds. Above and below the
chakras are the bodily abodes of the
god Shiva (awareness) and the
goddess Shakti (power), the two divine
principles through which the entire
universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept is the homology (or the
similarity based on the common origin)
of macrocosm and microcosm, an
essential Hindu belief documented
in the texts of the Upanishads.
The kundalini is an aspect of the uni-
versal Shakti present in all human
beings; it is visualized as a snake coiled
three times around the muladhara
chakra, the lowest of the psychic cen-
ters. Although kundalini can be found in
all people, it is usually dormant, sym-
bolized by its coiled state. The object of
the religious disciplines (yogas) involv-
ing the subtle body is to awaken and
uncoil the kundalini, drawing it up
through the subtle body’s central chan-
nel (sushumna), piercing through the
chakras on its way. Kundalini’s ascent
represents the awakening of spiritual
energy. This awakening must be carried
out under a guru’s supervision to pre-
vent the aspirant from unknowingly
arousing uncontrollable forces. As each
chakra is pierced, it is believed to bring
either the destruction of obstructions or
the awakening of new capacities. When
fully extended, the kundalini rises to the
microcosmic realm of Shiva, the sahas-
radalapadma at the crown of the head,
to unite with Shiva in perpetual bliss.

Kundalini Yoga
The religious discipline (yoga) focusing
on the kundalini, the latent spiritual
[[381]]
Kunti
power that exists in every person.
Through a combination of yoga practice
and ritual action, it is believed that the
kundalini is awakened and rises through
the chakras in the subtle body. This
action brings further spiritual capacities
and, ultimately, final liberation (mok-
sha) of the soul. One of the claims for
kundalini yoga is that it is much quicker
than other means of spiritual develop-
ment, harnessing more powerful forces.
For this same reason, it is viewed as
more hazardous, and should be done
only under the supervision of one’s reli-
gious preceptor (guru). According to
tradition, those who engage these forces
without proper supervision risk
unleashing forces they cannot control,
possibly bringing on insanity or death.
Kunti
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Kunti is the elder wife
of King Pandu, and the mother of
Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Bhima.
None of these children are actually
Pandu’s sons; they have been magically
conceived through the effect of a
mantra given to Kunti by the sage
Durvasas. The mantra gives the woman
who recites it the power to call down any
of the gods and conceive a son equal in
power to the god himself.
Kunti receives this mantra before her
marriage. In a moment of youthful
impulsiveness, she recites it while look-
ing at the sun. She is immediately visited
by a shining figure who leaves her with
an equally shining son. Distraught and
desperate at the birth of this illegitimate
child, she puts him in a box and aban-
dons him in the Ganges River. The child
is adopted by the charioteer Adhiratha
and grows up to be the heroic Karna.
Kunti’s other three sons are born
after her marriage, with Pandu’s bless-
ing: Yudhishthira from the god
Dharma, who is righteousness person-
ified; Arjuna from the storm-god
Indra; and Bhima from the wind-god
Vayu. Although these three grow up to
be heroic and kingly figures, they
[[382]]

develop a violent hatred for Karna
because of his unknown parentage.
One of the Mahabharata’s tragic
themes is this bitter rivalry between
men who do not know they are broth-
ers. Their hostility is especially difficult
for Kunti, aware of Karna’s identity. She
knows that the problems are rooted in
her impulsiveness and cowardice. On
the eve of the great Mahabharata war
she goes to Karna, reveals his identity
to him, imploring him to return and
fight with his brothers. Karna refuses,
saying that he has taken a vow to kill
Arjuna, but he will not harm her other
sons. After the war Kunti becomes a
recluse, living in the forest with several
other people of her generation. After
living there for some years, she is killed
in a forest fire.
Kurma Avatar
The Kurma avatar is considered the
second avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu. Taking the form of a
tortoise, he helps the gods churn the
Ocean of Milk so that they can obtain
the nectar of immortality (amrta). See
Tortoise avatar.
Kurmasana
(“tortoise-posture”) One of the sitting
postures (asanas) used in yoga; also
a posture in which images of the
deities are portrayed in Hindu
iconography. As described in commen-
taries on the Yoga Sutras, this posture
has the legs crossed with the feet
tucked under the thighs, and the crossed
heels forming a cavity around the
scrotum. In Indian iconography,
the Kurmasana is sometimes represent-
ed at the base of a statue by an
actual carving of a tortoise, forming
the base on which the image is placed.
In modern yoga manuals this posture
is described as a sitting position
in which the upper body is bent
forward, with the arms extended
sideways under the outstretched
legs, so that person looks vaguelyKutichaka
like a tortoise, with a head, “shell” (the
trunk), and four outstretched limbs.
Kurukshetra
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the north-
ern part of the state of Haryana, about
ninety miles due north of Delhi. In
Hindu mythology, Kurukshetra is the
site of the climactic battle in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. This battle is still discussed
as if it was a recent event. Kurukshetra is
also famous as a bathing (snana) place.
A bathing pool attracts hundreds of
thousands of pilgrims during eclipses,
at which time it is believed to contain all
the sacred waters of India.
Kutichaka
(“delighting in staying in the house”)
One the of four types of Hindu ascetics.
The basis for these four types was their
livelihood, which in practice has been
much less important for ascetic identity
than sectarian or organizational affilia-
tion. The Kutichaka is the least presti-
gious of the four, with the others
being (in order of increasing status)
Bahudaka, Hamsa, and Paramahamsa.
The Kutichaka is described as an ascetic
who resides in a house (kuti) erected by
himself or his sons and begs for food
from his sons and relatives.
Kusha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kusha is one of the
twin sons of Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist. After their mother, Sita, has been
cast into exile at the ashram of the sage
Valmiki, Kusha is born in an unusual
fashion. One day when Sita takes her
son Lava to bathe in the river, Valmiki
notices that the child is gone and fears
that it has been seized by a wild animal.
To spare Sita’s motherly feelings, he
creates an identical child out of
kusha grass. When Sita returns with
Lava, his twin is given the name
Kusha. Later, Lava and Kusha go with
Valmiki to Rama’s court in Ayodhya.
It is in Rama’s court that they first
recite the epic poem composed by
Valmiki, the Ramayana. After Rama
gives up his throne, he divides his
kingdom between Lava and Kusha.
Kusha (“Kusha Grass”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, Kusha
or “Kusha grass,” is the fourth of
the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.

Laghava
## L
Laghava
(“simplicity”) In Indian logic, one of the
general principles in constructing and
pursuing an argument. According to the
principle of “simplicity,” when one is
presented with two equally plausible
theories, one should choose the theory
that is easier to understand and makes
the fewest assumptions. The primary
criterion in evaluating an argument
is the validity of the argument itself.
Only after this has been satisfied
may one raise objections based on com-
plexity or simplicity.
Laghima
(“lightness”) One of eight superhuman
powers (siddhi) believed to be conferred
by high spiritual attainment. This partic-
ular power gives one the ability to
become as light as one desires, bestow-
ing the ability to fly.
Lajpat Rai, Lala
(1865–1928) Lawyer, reformer, and mili-
tant Hindu nationalist. Born to a hum-
ble Punjabi family, Lajpat Rai became
wealthy from his legal work. By the age
of thirty-five, he was able to devote all of
his earnings to public work. He joined
the Arya Samaj while still in his teens
and supported Lahore’s Dayanand
Anglo-Vedic College, which was founded
in 1889. At the turn of the century he was
active in a variety of social and educa-
tional endeavors. He eventually entered
politics. He actively resisted British rule,
which brought him several prison terms.
Unlike many of his contemporaries, he
refused to advocate violence. His com-
mitment to politics ultimately cost him
[[384]]

his life; he died from injuries sustained
in a beating by the police while leading a
demonstration in Lahore.
Lakshmana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lakshmana is one of
King Dasharatha’s sons by his wife
Sumitra, and the younger half-brother
of Rama, the epic’s protagonist.
Throughout the Ramayana Lakshmana
is the model younger brother, existing
only to serve and support Rama. When
Rama is banished to the forest for four-
teen years, Lakshmana follows him like
a shadow for the entire time: first living
as a forest ascetic, searching for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, then fighting hero-
ically in the battle with Ravana’s army;
finally he returns to serve Rama at his
court in Ayodhya.
Many of the characters in the
Ramayana are paradigms for Indian cul-
tural values. Lakshmana (as with his
brother Bharata) symbolizes the ideal
younger brother. In northern India,
brothers are the heart of the joint family.
They remain at home, whereas after
marriage, sisters live in their marital
families. The eldest brother in every
generation eventually becomes the head
of the joint family. Carrying primary
authority and responsibility for the fam-
ily as a whole, the eldest cannot succeed
without the cooperation of his younger
brothers who must acknowledge and
support his authority. In his service to
Rama and his complete disregard for his
own needs, Lakshmana is a dutiful
younger brother.
Despite his bravery, valor, and total
loyalty to Rama, Lakshmana is far from
perfect. He lacks Rama’s judgment and
forbearance, and tends to act before he
thinks. For example, when Bharata pur-
sues the two brothers after they have
gone into exile, Lakshmana leaps to the
conclusion that Bharata is seizing the
opportunity to kill them, to clear his
own way to the throne. Lakshmana pre-
pares to attack Bharata, but Rama’s
reasoning forestalls a potential tragedy.Lakshmi
Lakshmana’s most serious lapse of judg-
ment is with Shurpanakha, a demon
princess and sister to Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. When she makes
amorous advances toward Lakshmana,
he first ridicules her and then mutilates
her. Ravana kidnaps Rama’s wife, Sita, to
gain a measure of revenge against the
brothers. Like all of the characters in the
Ramayana, Lakshmana is neither good
nor evil—he has many virtues, but also
some very real flaws.
Lakshman Jhula
Sacred site (tirtha) along the Ganges in
the Tehri district of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, roughly five miles upriver from
the city of Rishikesh. The site takes its
present name from a swinging foot-
bridge (jhula) that spans the Ganges.
The local charter myth describes
Lakshman Jhula as the place where
Rama and Lakshmana live as ascetics
late in their lives, atoning for the sin of
brahminicide, which they incurred by
killing Ravana and his brothers (who are
considered brahmin demons). Today,
the area is famous for the Svargashrama
of Swami Shivananda, part of a network
of ashrams along its banks.
Lakshmi
(“good fortune,” “prosperity”) Hindu
goddess and wife of the god Vishnu.
According to tradition, Lakshmi is created
when the ocean of milk is churned to
yield the nectar of immortality. Just as
butter is the refined essence of milk, so
Lakshmi is the refined essence of the
primordial ocean, representing all the
best things that come from it. Lakshmi is
associated with wealth, good fortune,
and prosperity, and is considered the
embodiment of all these things. Images
of Lakshmi usually depict her with the
lotus and the elephant, both of which
are associated with good fortune. Many
images show gold coins falling from her
hands, symbolizing wealth.
These potent associations make
Lakshmi an extremely important force
Thirteenth-century sculpture of the goddess
Lakshmi. She is considered the embodiment of
wealth, prosperity, and fortune.
in Hindu life. Lakshmi exercises her
power by her mere presence—when she
comes, she brings prosperity and good
fortune; when she leaves, these benefits
leave with her. Given Lakshmi’s power,
people are understandably eager to
please her, especially since she has the
reputation for being capricious and fickle
in her relationships with human
beings—a reputation that reflects a real-
istic appraisal of life’s vicissitudes.
Lakshmi’s capriciousness and her repu-
tation for being somewhat spiteful make
people extremely careful in their deal-
ings with her, to avoid insulting her,
even if unintentionally.
Lakshmi’s primary annual festival is
Diwali, when she is believed to roam the
earth. People spend the days before
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and white-
washing their homes, making them
[[385]]
Lakshmibai
suitable for welcoming the goddess. On
the evening of Diwali, people open all
their doors and windows (to facilitate
her entry) and place lights on their win-
dowsills and balcony ledges to invite her
in. Gambling is a common practice dur-
ing Diwali. Gambling is usually con-
demned as a pernicious habit, but
during Diwali it reaffirms the connec-
tion between money and Lakshmi—
here in her guise as Lady Luck.
Despite her capricious relationships
with human beings, Lakshmi is consid-
ered to be the model wife, particularly in
her devotion and subordination to her
husband. When Lakshmi and Vishnu
appear together, she is significantly
smaller, signifying her subordinate sta-
tus. Another common image of the cou-
ple shows Lakshmi massaging Vishnu’s
feet, and thus her wifely subordination.
Lakshmi is not only the model for
human wives but is also believed to be
incarnate in each of them. Married
women are believed to embody the
good fortune of the household. It is gen-
erally accepted that households in
which they are not honored will never
be prosperous. For more information on
Lakshmi and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986. See also Tortoise

Lakshmibai
(d. 1858) Queen of the small kingdom of
Jhansi in the southern part of the state of
Uttar Pradesh and a leader in the 1857
struggle against the British, known as
the “Mutiny” or the “First War of Indian
Independence.” Lakshmibai’s kingdom
was the victim of expanding British
power. The British colonial government
had pronounced the “doctrine of lapse”
edict, annexing any kingdom in which
the ruler had died heirless. Lakshmibai’s
husband died in 1853. Although he had
adopted a son just before his death, the
British refused to recognize the adop-
tion and sought to annex the kingdom.
Lakshmibai was one of the leaders during
the 1857 rebellion; she died in battle.
[[386]]

She was eulogized as a patriot and pro-
ponent of Indian independence, and
because of her power and martial ability,
she is considered a manifestation of the
powerful goddess Durga.
Lakshmidhara
(ca. mid-12th c.) Scholar, commentator,
and author of the Kalpataru, one of the
earliest examples of commentary litera-
ture known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”). The nibandhas were compendia
of Hindu lore, compiling themes from
the Vedas, dharma literature, puranas,
and other authoritative religious texts,
into a single volume. Each of the
Kalpataru’s fourteen volumes is devoted
to a particular aspect of Hindu life, such
as daily practice, worship, gift-giving,
vows, pilgrimage, penances (prayash-
chitta), purification, and liberation
(moksha). As one of the earliest niband-
has, the Kalpataru served as a model for
later writers. Lakshmidhara’s work is
unusual in that he uses very few sources
for his work—primarily the epic
Mahabharata, and a few of the sectari-
an compendia known as puranas.
Unlike later commentators, he does not
cite the Vedas, the earliest Hindu reli-
gious texts, or the prescriptions found in
the dharma literature. His text consists
almost solely of excerpted passages,
with very little commentary of his own,
whereas later nibandha writers often
give voluminous explanations.
Lakshmi-Narayan Temple
A modern temple in Delhi just west of
Connaught Place. It was built in 1938 by
Ghanshyamdas Birla, the patriarch of a
prominent industrialist family. Although
the temple is dedicated to the god
Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, it is
more commonly called the “Birla tem-
ple” after its patron. Since Lakshmi is
considered the bestower of wealth, and
the temple was built by a businessman,
this dedication is hardly surprising.
Aside from his religious endowments,
Ghanshyamdas Birla was also the majorLanka
financial support behind the Indian
National Congress, the political party
led by Mohandas Gandhi which strug-
gled to gain Indian independence. Since
the day it was built the temple has been
open to people of all castes and commu-
nities, upholding the denial of untouch-
ability that was one of Gandhi’s most
important crusades.
Lakulisha
(2nd c.?) Legendary founder of the
Pashupata religious community, a
group of renunciant ascetics whose
patron deity was the god Shiva.
Lakulisha appears to have been an
important influence in the development
of other Shaivite ascetics, such as the
Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas. He has
been identified as an incarnation of
Shiva. Many statues have been identi-
fied as Lakulisha’s image; he is portrayed
as a naked yogi with a staff in one hand
and a citron in the other, with penis
erect, either standing or sitting in the
lotus posture (padmasana). For further
information see David Lorenzen, The
Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas, 1972.
Lal Ded
Another name for the Kashmiri poet-
saint Lalleshvari. See Lalleshvari.
Lalitaditya
(8th c.) One of the few kings of the
Kashmir region who was able to affect
the politics of the northern Indian plain,
partially due to the fragmented state of
the Hindu kingdoms there. Lalitaditya’s
armies pushed into the Ganges River
valley, successfully halting the advance
of the Arab forces in the Punjab region.
His successors were unable to retain
these gains.
Lallavakyani
(“Lalla’s Sayings”) Corpus of poetry
ascribed to the Kashmiri poet-saint
Lalleshvari, a devotee (bhakta) of the
god Shiva. The poems in this collection
allude to the difficult circumstances of
her early life, and the domestic prob-
lems that induced her to leave her mari-
tal home. They also describe her
encompassing devotion to Shiva, whom
she describes as the only true source of
happiness. These poems have been
translated into English, but all the edi-
tions are quite old: see Sir George
Grierson and Lionel D. Barnett, Lalla
Vakyani, 1920; and R. C. Temple, The
Word of Lalla, the Prophetess, 1924.
Lalleshvari
(14th c.) Devotional (bhakti) poet-saint
also known as Lal Ded, who is one of the
most popular poets in Kashmir.
Lalleshvari was a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; her songs focus on her
devotion to him. Like many other
female devotional exemplars, she had a
difficult time integrating her marriage
with her commitment to her chosen
deity. According to tradition, her mother-
in-law treated her quite cruelly. Her
husband is described as an unfeeling
man who neither objected to the abuse
nor comforted his wife. After about
twelve years of suffering she left home to
wander as a religious seeker. To symbol-
ize her renunciation of all attachments
and earthly values, including feminine
modesty, Lalleshvari wandered nude.
During her wanderings she composed
and sang songs of devotion to Shiva,
which are still popular today.
Lanka
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lanka is the kingdom
of the demon-king Ravana. Although
Lanka is sometimes identified with the
modern island of Sri Lanka, and though
southern Indian sites such as
Rameshvaram have been identified
with events in the Ramayana, the epic’s
descriptions should be read as mythic
and narrative accounts, rather than a
geographical primer. The divine archi-
tect Vishvakarma had originally built
Lanka for Kubera the minor deity, but
[[387]]
Lankalakshmi
Kubera had been dispossessed by
Ravana and his brothers.
Lankalakshmi
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lankalakshmi is the
name of the guardian deity of Lanka,
the demon-king Ravana’s capital city.
Lankalakshmi is also the rebirth of the
goddess Vijayalakshmi, who has been
cursed by the god Brahma to serve as
Lanka’s guardian deity. The curse will
last until an intruder to the city manages
to defeat her, foretelling the fall of
Ravana. This defeat comes with the
arrival of the monkey-god Hanuman,
who leaps across the ocean in search of
the goddess Sita, whom Ravana has kid-
napped. Lankalakshmi recognizes
Hanuman as an intruder and attacks
him, fulfilling her duty as a guardian
deity. Hanuman knocks her flat with a
powerful blow, breaking the curse and
signalling Ravana’s fall.
Lasya
One of two general categories in Indian
dance, which is soft, lyrical, and conveys
a mood of love. Its contrasting form,
tandava, is athletic, dramatic, and con-
veys violence and power.
Lava
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lava is one of the
twin sons of Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist. After their mother, Sita, has been
cast into exile at the ashram of the sage
Valmiki, Lava is born in the usual man-
ner. His brother, Kusha, is magically
created by Valmiki out of kusha grass.
Later, Lava and Kusha go with Valmiki
to Rama’s court in Ayodhya. It is in
Rama’s court that they first recite the
epic poem composed by Valmiki, the
Ramayana. After Rama gives up his
throne, he divides his kingdom between
Lava and Kusha.
[[388]]

Leap Philosophy
(“ajativada”) Leap philosophy affirms
that one can attain complete freedom
from bondage—which in the Indian
context is identified as the end of rein-
carnation (samsara) and final liberation
of the soul (moksha)—but such free-
dom cannot be gained by a precisely
specified sequence of causes and
effects. Since gaining freedom is not a
matter of cause and effect, there is no
way to stimulate or influence this
process through one’s actions. Leap
philosophers tend to denigrate the
effectiveness of ritual action as a way to
gain final liberation, except as a
preparatory phase, stressing that
liberation comes only through gaining
inner realization. Sureshvara and
Shankaracharya, members of the
Advaita Vedanta school, dismiss ritual
action, except as preparation for wis-
dom. Both philosophers believe that
release from bondage comes through
insight gained in a moment of realiza-
tion, which radically and permanently
shifts one’s perspective on the world.
Leather
Considered an impure substance by
many traditional Hindus, because it is
the product of a dead animal. They
believe that leather is an appropriate
material for shoes, however, because the
feet are deemed the lowest and most
impure part of the body. For this reason,
many people put on their shoes by slip-
ping their feet into them without using
their hands, thus avoiding touching the
leather with a higher part of the body.
Leather’s associations with ritual impu-
rity (ashaucha) make it inappropriate
for other sorts of clothing—clothing
which the hot Indian climate would ren-
der problematic—although now it is
sometimes used for handbags and brief-
cases. In earlier times people who
wished to avoid leather would wear
wooden clogs instead; in modern times,
footwear options also include plastic,
rubber, and canvas.Limitationism
Left Hand Tantra
A variation of the tantra; the rituals for
this “left hand” variety include con-
sciously violating taboos on nonvegetar-
ian food, intoxicating drinks, and illicit
sexuality. See Vamachara.
Levirate
An ancient practice, long condemned,
in which a childless widow would have
intercourse with her deceased hus-
band’s brother in an attempt to perpetu-
ate his line. See Niyoga.
Lila
(“play”) A word whose broad literal
meaning denotes any sort of play, game,
or sport, but which in a theological con-
text conveys a fundamental assumption
about how God interacts with the world.
According to this notion, the supreme
deity engages in creation not from any
sense of need, but for the sheer enjoy-
ment and entertainment gained from
creating and taking part in the world.
This is particularly true for the god
Vishnu, especially in his manifestations
as Rama and Krishna. In this under-
standing, all divine interactions
between God and his devotees (bhakta)
are undertaken in this spirit of play,
although in their ignorance human
beings may not recognize the true
nature of this encounter. Final liberation
of the soul (moksha) comes when the
devotee recognizes the true nature of
this encounter, since after that moment
of realization one’s entire life is a series
of playful interactions with God himself.
One of the ways that contemporary
devotees strive to enter Rama’s and
Krishna’s divine world is through dra-
mas that are themselves known as lilas.
These lilas can be attended for enter-
tainment, but viewing them can also be
a deeply serious religious act. When
child actors portraying the deities are in
costume and in character, they are con-
sidered manifestations of the deities
themselves. For ardent devotees, view-
ing these lilas is an avenue for gaining
God’s grace, and an entry-point into a
privileged, divine world. For an excellent
consideration of how Krishna’s entire
life is considered as play, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975;
for a description of the Krishna lilas, see
John Stratton Hawley, At Play with
Krishna, 1981; and Anaradha Kapur,
Actors, Pilgrims, Kings, and Gods, 1990.
See also Ram Lila.
Limitationism
Theory explaining diversity used by later
branches of the Advaita Vedanta philo-
sophical school, one of the “six schools”
of classical Hindu philosophy. This
school of thought upholds monism—
the belief that a single Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely dif-
fering forms of that reality. Proponents
claim that reality is non-dual (advaita),
that is, all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity. For the Advaitins, the assumption of
diversity is a fundamental misunder-
standing of the ultimate nature of
things, and therefore is a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
ultimately causing human beings to be
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarna-
tion (samsara), and suffering.
Theoretically, if avidya is a defect that
resides within an individual, and if
many individuals can be afflicted with
avidya at once, is there one avidya that
afflicts everyone, or are there many sep-
arate avidyas? Limitationism asserts
that there is a single avidya, afflicting
many people at once. The theory pro-
poses that avidya, in a person, is like the
quality of color in an object. The color
blue may be a single property of two
coexisting objects; each instance of the
color blue does not use up a finite “blue-
ness” in the world. In the same way,
many people may possess the single
property of avidya.
[[389]]
Linga
The Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneshvar. Built in the eleventh century,
the temple exemplifies the Orissan branch of the Nagara architectural style.
Linga
(“mark,” “sign”) Aside from the word’s
literal meaning as any emblematic sign,
linga is also the name for the pillar-
shaped form of the god Shiva.
Representing Shiva as the power of gen-
eration itself, from which men and
women derive their procreative force,
the linga is sometimes simplistically
called a “phallic” symbol. An equally
important part of the linga’s image is the
base (pitha) in which the shaft is placed,
a base which represents the female
organs of generation. The Gudimallam
linga, the oldest known image of Shiva
in this form, shows him as male and
female, transcending the most basic
defining factor of human identity.
Lingaraja Temple
Largest and most important of the tem-
ples in the city of Bhubaneshvar, dedi-
cated to the god Shiva in his aspect as
Tribhuvaneshvar, the “Lord of the Three
Worlds.” The temple was built in the
[[390]]

eleventh century C.E., representing the
high point of the Orissan branch of the
Nagara architectural style. The temple
building culminates in one single, high-
est point over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, with shorter subsidiary
buildings leading up to it. The Lingaraja
temple shows all the elements of the
Orissan style: a beehive-shaped tower
(deul) soaring 120 feet high, fronted by a
dance hall (natamandira), traditionally
used for performances, an entrance hall
(jagamohan), and an outer entrance
hall (bhogamandapa).
Lingayat
Kannada-speaking religious community
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, and who mainly live in
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
Lingayat roots began in the seventh cen-
tury with the Nayanar poet-saints in
Tamil Nadu state, migrating northward.
The community’s founder was the poet-
saint Basavanna; others includedLohar
Allama Prabhu and Mahadeviyakka.
The community’s founding members
were driven by the hunger for God and
were impatient with anything that got in
its way—worship of images, caste dis-
tinctions, or the demands of family life.
These early influences have continued
to shape Lingayat culture. Lingayats do
not use images in their worship. The
only symbol they use is the linga of
Shiva, which all Lingayats wear as a sign
of membership in the community. The
Lingayats have also largely retained
their founders’ egalitarian principles.
Although the community eschews caste
distinctions, there are higher-status
priestly families known as jangamas,
from whom the celibate monks known
as viraktas are often drawn. In practice,
this egalitarian emphasis has made the
entire Lingayat community a jati, one of
the endogamous social subgroups that
make up larger Indian society; the dif-
ference is that the Lingayats are not
marked by their occupation, but by their
membership in a particular religious
community. The Lingayats are the dom-
inant community in modern Karnataka,
both in terms of traditional landholding
patterns and in their control over
regional politics. For further informa-

Lion
In Hindu mythology, a lion or a tiger is
the animal vehicle of the Mother
Goddess, as in her manifestation as the
goddess Durga. Modern iconography
shows the Goddess riding either of these
animals, with no seeming difference
between them, perhaps reflecting the
fact that the Hindi word “sher” can refer
to either the lion or the tiger. The fact
that the Goddess rides such a dangerous
animal is clearly a symbol of her power
and capacity. In her mythology these
animals are often described as her allies,
engaging in battle at her command.
Liquor
Condemned by the traditional Hindus,
although attitudes differ based on the
type of liquor consumed. Consuming
beer, wine, and distilled spirits (“foreign
liquor”) carries the stigma of adopting
“foreign” Western values; whereas con-
suming undistilled, fermented bever-
ages such as “country liquor” and toddy
carry the taint of low-class behavior.
Patterns of drinking tend to reflect and
reinforce these negative attitudes. Since
liquor is taboo in polite society, people
who drink will often finish the bottle in
one sitting and become intoxicated,
thus “proving” that there is no such
thing as responsible drinking.
Despite the general cultural disap-
proval, there are a few Hindu temples
where liquor is the everyday offering to
the deity. The worshipers also receive
liquor as prasad, the sanctified food or
drink that carries the deity’s blessing.
Alcohol has also been incorporated into
religious rituals in certain types of
tantric religious practice. Tantra is a
secret ritual-based religious tradition,
based on the belief that there is an ulti-
mate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm
that the entire universe is one princi-
ple means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic think-
ing. One way to do this is to partake of
the “Five Forbidden Things” (pan-
chamakara), consciously breaking soci-
etal norms forbidding consumption of
intoxicants, nonvegetarian food, and
illicit sexuality. This is always done with-
in a carefully defined ritual setting, in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is nor-
mally forbidden.
Lohar
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups (in which marriage is decreed by
law to occur only between members of
the same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
The jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each

Lohari
Lokacharya
(ca. early 14th c.) Religious leader also
known as Pillai Lokacharya, the founder
of the Tengalai branch of the
Shrivaishnava religious community.
The Shrivaishnavas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu. The Tengalais
have no faith in human capacities,
emphasizing the need for the devotee’s
absolute surrender to the grace of God,
which alone will save the devotee.

hereditary occupation was black-
smithing and iron working.
Lohari
Festival falling on the night before
Makara Sankranti, the day when the
sun moves into the zodiological sign of
Capricorn, which almost always falls on
January 14. The central focus of this fes-
tival is a large bonfire. Celebrants collect
fuel for weeks beforehand, lighting the
fire on the evening of the festival. People
dance, sing, and walk around the fire,
giving the fire offerings of sweets, fried
snacks, and peanuts; these same items
are also given to those present as prasad
or sanctified food.
Lohari is a seasonal festival, marking
the passing of the coldest period of the
winter and anticipating the return of
warmer weather, symbolized by the fire.
This festival is celebrated in the Punjab
and in northern India where Punjabis
have settled. This festival also serves as a
public display recognizing some change
within the family. Families that have
recorded marriages or births in the past
year celebrate with particular fervor,
whereas families in which a person has
died usually refrain.

Lopamudra
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the
sage Agastya.
Lost Wax Casting
A method of metal-casting used to cre-
ate the southern Indian bronzes during
the Chola dynasty (9th–14th c.). The
artisan makes a wax image of the statue,
then covers the wax with layers of clay.
The clay is fired and the wax vaporizes,
leaving a clay mold into which molten
metal is poured. Once the metal cools,
the clay mold is broken, revealing the
statue. Small imperfections are removed
by hand, and the statue is polished to a
high gloss. This casting method produces
exquisite detail and subtlety of expres-
sion, but is extremely time-consuming
because each wax image and clay mold
can only be used once.
Lota
A vessel for holding water that usually
narrows near the top (so that the vessel
can be carried in one hand) with a flared
opening to facilitate accurate pouring.
The lota is used for drinking. Water can
be poured directly into one’s mouth
without touching the vessel to one’s lips,
which would render the vessel and its
contents impure. A lota is also often
used in bathing (snana), to pour waterLunar Month, Structure of

LothalLunar Line
Ancient city and archeological site located
near the Gulf of Cambay in the modern
state of Gujarat. Lothal was one of the
cities of the Indus Valley civilization, a
highly developed urban culture that
flourished in the Indus Valley region
between the fourth and third millennia
B.C.E. Lothal was a port city, although
because of silting, the present site is now
well inland. The size of the harbor indi-
cates that it was a prominent port.
Archaeological evidence suggests that
Lothal continued to flourish for nearly
[[500]]
 years after the decline of Harappa
and Mohenjo-Daro, the two largest
cities of the Indus Valley civilization.One of the two great mythic lineages in
Hindu mythology, the other being the
Solar Line. Kings in the Lunar Line
traced their descent from Soma, the
moon, who married the daughter of
King Ikshvaku of the Solar Line. Soma

progeny, including most of the principal
characters in the Mahabharata, the
later of the two great Hindu epics.

Love Marriage
In modern India, the name given to a
marriage fixed by the bride and groom
themselves, rather than an arranged
marriage fixed by parents or guardians.
Although Western romantic notions
consider a love marriage the preferred
method, many Hindus consider love
marriages suspect. Love marriages carry
the stigma of rebellion—children usurp-
ing the role traditionally played by their
parents. It is sometimes thought to pre-
sent the danger of inter-caste marriage
and the likelihood that the marriage will
be rooted in lust or infatuation, thus
rendering it potentially unstable. The
family is considered the foundation of
society; anything undermining its sta-
bility is viewed quite dimly. Love mar-
riages are becoming more common
and accepted among modern Hindus,
Lunar Month, Structure of
Hindu festivals are determined accord-
ing to a lunar calendar, in which a year
is made of twelve lunar months. The
lunar month is divided into two halves,
each of which has fifteen days. In north-
ern India the lunar month begins with
the dark (krishna) half—when the moon
is waning. This phase lasts fifteen days,
ending with the new moon. This is fol-
lowed by the light (shukla) half of the
month—when the moon is waxing. This
phase lasts fifteen days, ending with the
full moon. The day after the full moon is
the first day of the next lunar month,
and so on. Any given lunar day is desig-
nated by the name of the month, the
half (light or dark), and the lunar day (1
to 15). In southern India the pattern is
reversed, with the lunar month starting
with the light half and ending on the
new moon.
The lunar month, as with all Hindu
conceptions of time, represents chang-
ing times of auspiciousness and inaus-
piciousness, peaks and valleys marking
times that are more or less propitious.
The full moon, with its associations of
fullness, abundance, and light, is always
auspicious. It is believed that religious
rites performed on this day generate as
much merit as those performed for an
entire month. The new moon, with its
associations of darkness and emptiness,
is a more ambiguous time. At times the
[[393]]
Lunar Month, Structure of
new moon can be highly auspicious, as
on the occasion of a Somavati
Amavasya (new moon falling on
Monday). Several major festivals (such
as Diwali) fall on the new moon. Despite
this, the new moon is less auspicious
than the full moon. Within each fort-
night various days are also associated
with particular deities, and their devo-
tees (bhakta) often do particular rites on
those days: The eleventh day (ekadashi)
is dedicated to the god Vishnu, the
eighth day (ashtami) to the Goddess, the
evening of the thirteenth day (trayo-
dashi) and the fourteenth to the god
Shiva, and the fourth day (chaturthi) to
the god Ganesh.
As mentioned earlier, the lunar cal-
endar is the basis for almost all Hindu
holidays. To correct the discrepancy
between the lunar and solar year (about
eleven days), and thus keep these festi-
vals at about the same time every year,
an intercalary month is inserted every
[[21]]
⁄2 years. Although this extra month
keeps the calendar in balance, it is con-
sidered highly inauspicious, perhaps
because it is an unusual occurrence.
During this month people take normal
precautions to protect themselves dur-
ing inauspicious times—basically
putting off any new activities until the
month is over, and propitiating protec-
tive deities until the end of the month.

Madhurya (“Honeyed”) Bhava
## M
Madhava
(from madhu “sweet”) Epithet of the
god Krishna, signifying the sweetness
that he brings to the lives of his devotees
(bhakta). See Krishna.
Madhava
(2) (14th c.) Author of the Sarvadar-
shanasangraha, a philosophical encyclo-
pedia composed in the late fourteenth
century. In this text, Madhava com-
piles the views of all existing philo-
sophical schools, placing them in
hierarchical order, based on his judg-
ment of their value. According to the
text, the materialist school is ranked
the lowest and least reliable, since its
proponents completely deny the
virtue of any religious life. The Advaita
Vedanta school, Madhava’s own, is
judged as the highest and most perfect
expression of the truth. Although the
Sarvadarshanasangraha is biased, it is
one of the few extant sources which
considers the perspectives of all the
existing schools.
Madhima
(“greatness”) One of the eight superhu-
man powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred by high spiritu-
al attainment. This particular power
gives one the ability to become as large
as one desires.
Madhu
In Hindu mythology, one of the two
demons who attempt to kill the god
Brahma; the other demon is Kaitabha.
The story is recounted in several mythic
sources with some marked differences
between stories. All versions agree that
Madhu and Kaitabha are born from the
god Vishnu’s ear wax during the period
of cosmic dissolution (pralaya). As the
creation of the world begins anew, a
lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s navel. It
opens to reveal the creator-god Brahma,
who is immediately menaced by Madhu
and Kaitabha. In all versions of the
myth, Brahma appeals for help, and
Vishnu tricks the demons and slays
them. The difference in the stories
pertains to the deity to whom Brahma
appeals for help. The story first
appears in the mythology of Vishnu;
here Brahma invokes Vishnu. Yet this
same story also appears in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest source in
which the Mother Goddess appears as
the supreme divine power. In this ver-
sion, Brahma’s hymn of praise is to the
Goddess, who in her form as Yoganidra
(“sleep of yoga”) has lulled Vishnu into a
cosmic stupor, rendering him unable to
come to Brahma’s aid. Pleased by
Brahma’s praise, the Goddess withdraws
her influence over Vishnu; he awakens,
and slays the demons.
Madhurya (“Honeyed”) Bhava
The second of the five modes of devo-
tion to God that were articulated by
Rupa Goswami, a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Krishna and a follower of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya. Rupa used
human relationships to describe the
connection between devotee and deity.
The five modes showed growing emo-
tional intensity, from the peaceful
(shanta) sense that comes from realiz-
ing one’s complete identity with
Brahman or Ultimate Reality, to con-
ceiving of God as one’s master, friend,
child, or lover. The Madhurya Bhava is
the last and most intense of the five
modes of devotion. In this mode, devo-
tees consider the relationship between
themselves and the deity as that of lover
and beloved. This mode appeared most
prominently with regard to the god
Krishna (in which the model devotees
were the cowherd women of Braj), and
[[395]]
Madhusudana Saraswati
Radha (who is a symbol for the human
soul.) This particular mode is seen as the
most intense and demanding because of
its emotional closeness. For that same
reason, it is also seen as the sweetest.
Madhusudana Saraswati
(16th c.) A renowned member of the
Sanyasi community, a group of renun-
ciant ascetics who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. His last name reveals
that he was a member of the Saraswati
sect, one of the most prestigious of the
ten Dashanami divisions; he is said to
have lived most of his life in Benares,
the greatest religious center of his
time. According to ascetic legend,
Madhusudana was responsible for the
creation of a class of fighting ascetics,
the Naga Sanyasis. According to tradi-
tion, Madhusudana created these fight-
ers because he was distressed at the
depredations the Sanyasis suffered at
the hands of hostile Muslim faqirs. After
consulting with Birbal, adviser to
Moghul emperor Akbar, Madhusudana
decided to form a fighting ascetic
order dedicated to protecting other
ascetics. Recruits came from the ranks
of the shudras.
Madhva
(1197–1276) Philosopher and founder of
the Dvaita Vedanta philosophical
school, whose long life was largely spent
in Udupi, a small town near the Malabar
coast in the state of Karnataka.
Madhva’s basic philosophy was the utter
transcendence of God. This conviction
led him to develop the theory of
dualism, which posits a qualitative
difference between God in his
transcendence and the corruptions of
material things. According to Madhva,
God is completely different from
humans and the material world, even
though both came from God and
depend on Him for their continuing
existence. Madhva differed sharply
from the major school, Advaita
Vedanta, which upheld the theory of
[[396]]

monism—the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality (called Brahman) lies
behind all things, which are merely
differing forms of this single reality.
Whereas Advaita collapses all things
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists
on maintaining differences.
Madhva’s emphasis on dualism led
him to articulate these differences,
known as the “fivefold difference”: the
difference between God and Self,
between God and the world, between
individual Selves, between Selves and
matter, and between individual material
things. Even though each Self contains
an aspect of God, fundamental differ-
ence gives the Self only limited capacity
for religious life. This limited power
means that final liberation of the soul
comes solely through the grace of God,
who alone has the power to effect it.
Final liberation was conceived both as
freedom from rebirth and as the soul’s
opportunity to remain in the divine
presence forever.
Madhya Pradesh
(“middle state”) Modern Indian state
located in the geographical center of the
subcontinent. Madhya Pradesh was
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 from the former Central Provinces,
Berar State, and several princely states.
Large parts of the state are inaccessible
and relatively undeveloped, particularly
in the Vindhya Mountain and Satpura
ranges. Madhya Pradesh also has a large
percentage of adivasis (indigenous trib-
al people), many of whom are very poor.
Madhya Pradesh contains many impor-
tant archaeological sites, including the
Chandella temples at Khajuraho and
the caves at Udayagiri. Sacred sites
(tirthas) include the Narmada River,
one of the seven sacred rivers of India,
and the holy city of Ujjain. For general
information about Madhya Pradesh and
other regions of India, see Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.Madurai
The Vishvanath Temple at Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, dates back to 1002 C.E.
Madmaheshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas, about
twenty miles north of the village of
Ukhimath. The temple’s presiding deity
is the god Shiva in his manifestation as
Madmaheshvar. Madmaheshvar is one
of the Panchkedar, a network of five
sacred sites in the Garhwal region; the
other four sites are Kedarnath,
Rudranath, Tungnath, and Kalpeshvar.
This network of five sites is seen as
a symbolic representation of Shiva’s
body; Madmaheshvar is believed to
be Shiva’s navel.woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods and to have a son
equal in power to that god himself. With
Pandu’s blessing, Kunti teaches the
mantra to Madri, who recites it to
the twin gods known as the Ashvins.
Thus she bears twins. They live happily
until springtime comes to the forest.
Under the intoxicating influence of
spring, Pandu embraces Madri; the
curse takes effect, and Pandu falls
down dead. Because of her role in
Pandu’s death, Madri consigns her
children to Kunti’s care, and ends her life
on Pandu’s funeral pyre.
MadriMadurai
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Madri is the junior
wife of King Pandu and the mother of
Nakula and Sahadeva. Neither of these
children are actually Pandu’s sons, since
he has been cursed to die the moment
he holds his wife in amorous embrace.
Rather, they have been magically con-
ceived through the effect of a mantra
given to Pandu’s other wife, Kunti, by
the sage Durvasas. The mantra gives the
Temple-town and sacred site (tirtha) on
the Vygai River, in the state of Tamil
Nadu in southern India. Madurai is
most famous for the large temple
dedicated to Minakshi, the goddess,
and her consort Sundareshvara.
Minakshi is a local deity who has
become a major regional goddess,
whereas Sundareshvara is considered
a form of the god Shiva. After the fall
of the Vijayanagar empire late in the
[[397]]
Madya
sixteenth century, southern India was
ruled by the Nayak dynasty, with the
capital at Madurai. Much of the
Minakshi temple was built by Tirumalai
Nayak (r. 1623-1659); his palace is
another of the city’s attractions. The
streets around the temple form four
concentric processional circuits, with
the temple directly in the middle. The
town was planned as a lotus with layers
of petals, with the image of Minakshi at
the center, around which all things
revolved. Symbolically, the Minakshi
temple was not only the center of the
city, but the center of the earth. See also
Vijayanagar dynasty.
Magh
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Magh is the eleventh
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within January and February. During
Magh there is a month-long bathing
(snana) festival, the Magh Mela, at the
confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers in Allahabad. The other major fes-
tivals in Magh are Sakata Chauth,
Shattila Ekadashi, Mauni Amavasya,
Vasant Panchami, Bhishma Ashtami,
Jaya Ekadashi, Ravidas Jayanti, Makara
Sankranti. In southern India, Pongal
and the Float Festival are celebrated
during Magh.
Madya
(“wine”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, wine is
the first of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara). Since “respectable”
Hindu society strongly condemns the
consumption of alcoholic beverages, its
ritual use in tantra must be understood
in the larger tantric context. One of the
most basic tantric assumptions is the
ultimate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that
the entire universe is one principle
means that the adept must reject all
concepts based on dualistic thinking.
One way to do this is to partake of the
“Five Forbidden Things,” consciously
breaking the societal norms forbidding
the consumption of intoxicants, non-
vegetarian food, and illicit sexuality—
making sacred that which is normally
forbidden. Tantric adepts cite such ritual
use of forbidden things as proof that
their practice involves a more exclusive
qualification (adhikara), and is thus
superior to common practice. In its ritual
use—which is usually in very small
quantities—the intoxication produced
by wine is an approximation of the bliss
of realization. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti
and Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and

Three Cities, 1990.

Magha
(7th c.) Sanskrit writer whose best-
known work, the drama Shishupala-
vadha, describes the death of
Shishupala at the hands of the god
Krishna.
In
Hindu
mythology,
Shishupala is a form of Jaya, Vishnu’s
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be
born as a demon three times and killed
each time by Vishnu. Shishupala is the
last of these births, after which the curse
is broken. Aside from its mythic theme,
the play is noted for a number of unusu-
al verses, designed to show the poet’s
skill. These include verses that are per-
fect palindromes and ones that use only
one or two consonants.
Magh Mela
Religious festival celebrated every year
during the entire lunar month of Magh
( January–February) in the city of
Allahabad. According to the Hindu fes-
tival calendar, Magh is one of the
months in which bathing (snana) in
sacred rivers is highly praised. This is
particularly
significant
because
Allahabad lies at the confluence of two
sacred rivers, the Ganges and the
Yamuna River. During this month, pil-
grims set up an encampment at the con-
fluence, which becomes a bustling
religious center. During their stay, pilgrimsMahabharata
live a strict and disciplined religious life.
This includes a morning bath, followed
by gift-giving (dana) and worship;
eating a restricted diet, and evenings
spent singing hymns (kirtan) and
listening to religious discourses. Some
pilgrims even take a strict vow, known as
kalpavas, to remain there for the entire
month, a vow which also entails a strict
ascetic lifestyle. More than a million pil-
grims attend this festival. Every twelfth
year, when the Magh Mela becomes the
Allahabad Kumbha Mela, attendance
increases. In 1989 an estimated fifteen
million pilgrims came for a single day,
with millions more coming during the
rest of the month.
Magic
In Hindu tradition there are many differ-
ent powers in the universe, and many
ways of influencing them, both seen and
unseen. The emphasis on magic goes
back to the Atharva Veda, one of the
oldest Hindu religious texts, which is
mostly a collection of spells. Even today
many Hindus accept that certain pow-
erful religious adepts have the power to
command unseen forces, as well as the
power to counteract the spells levied by
others. People who have gained high
levels of religious attainments are also
believed to have superhuman powers
(siddhi), allowing them to do things
that ordinary people cannot. These
superhuman powers are not seen as
magical, but rather as the normal exer-
cise of a level of understanding higher
than most people have attained. Indian
culture also has a long tradition of illu-
sion, sleight of hand, and other sorts of
trickery, baffling and entertaining
onlookers for centuries. For an extensive
account of these powers, see Lee Siegel,
Net of Magic, 1991.
Mahabalipuram
Village on the Bay of Bengal in Tamil
Nadu, about thirty miles south of
Madras. Although famous as a beach
resort today, during the Pallava dynasty
(6th–9th c.) Mahabalipuram was a
major port, second in importance only
to the capital at Kanchipuram.
Mahabalipuram has several impressive
religious monuments, erected during
the reigns of Narasimhavarman I
(630–668 C.E.) and Narasimhavarman II
(700–728 C.E.). One of the monuments is
a rock-cut sculpture depicting the myth
of the Descent of the Ganges, using a
natural vertical fissure to lay out the
river’s path. Other notable constructions
are the “Rathas,” a series of free-standing
temples carved from one giant boulder,
dedicated to the Pandavas, the protago-
nists in the epic Mahabharata. The
most recent attraction is the temple
along the shore, built during the reign of
Rajasimhavarman (early 8th C.). The
temple’s major deity is the god Shiva; a
smaller shrine also holds an image of
the god Vishnu. Although all of these
have been weathered by time and the
elements, they remain some of the most
visited sites in southern India.
Mahabharata
One of the two great Sanskrit epics,
traditionally ascribed to the mythical
sage Vyasa. The Mahabharata is much
longer than the other great epic, the
Ramayana. At almost 100,000 stanzas,
the Mahabharata is the world’s longest
epic poem. If the Ramayana can be
characterized as the tale of the “good”
family, in which brothers cooperate to
support and preserve their family, the
Mahabharata describes the “bad”
family, in which hard-heartedness and
the lust for power in an extended royal
family ultimately cause its destruction.
The epic is set in the region west of mod-
ern Delhi and describes a fratricidal civil
war. A greatly abridged account can be
given as follows:
Shantanu is the king of the Kurus. He
dies an untimely, heirless death. In a
desperate attempt to preserve the royal
line, Shantanu’s wife, Satyavati, calls
upon her elder son, the sage Vyasa, who
fathers children by Shantanu’s two
wives. The elder son, Dhrtarashtra, is
[[399]]
Mahabharata
born blind, and thus the rights to the
throne fall to his younger brother
Pandu. Pandu later abdicates his throne
because of a curse, and goes to live in
the forest with his two wives, Kunti and
Madri, leaving his elder brother to rule
in his place. In time Dhrtarashtra’s wife,
Gandhari, magically gives birth to one
hundred sons, of whom the oldest is
Duryodhana; the hundred sons are
called the Kauravas, and are the epic’s
antagonists. In the forest Kunti has three
sons, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna,
while Madri has the twins Nakula and
Sahadeva. These five sons are the
Pandavas, the epic’s protagonists. None
of these children are actually Pandu’s
sons, since he has been cursed to die the
moment he holds his wife in amorous
embrace. Rather, they have been magi-
cally conceived using a mantra given to
Kunti by the sage Durvasas, giving the
woman reciting it the power to call
down any of the gods and have a son
equal in power to that god himself.
When Kunti first receives the mantra,
long before her marriage, she impulsively
recites it while gazing upon the sun, and
gives birth to a shining child. Distraught
and desperate, Kunti puts him in a
box and abandons him in the Ganges
River. The child is adopted by the
charioteer Adhiratha, and grows up to
be the heroic Karna.
As the result of his curse, Pandu dies
an early death, and Kunti (his wife) and
his sons (the Pandavas) return to the
court at Hastinapur, where the boys are
raised as princes. From the beginning
there are bad feelings between
Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kauravas)
and his cousins, largely because
Duryodhana desires the throne, which
rightly belongs to Yudhishthira (one of
the Pandavas). After foiling several
attempts to kill them, the Pandava
brothers leave the kingdom to become
mercenaries. On one of their journeys,
Arjuna wins the hand of the princess
Draupadi, who becomes their common
wife (their mother commands that
Arjuna share whatever he wins with his
brothers). After some time Dhrtarashtra
[[400]]

(father of the Kauravas) renounces
the throne and divides his kingdom.
The Pandavas build a new capital
at Indraprastha, identified near
modern Delhi.
For a little while things are quiet, but
Duryodhana is not content to share his
kingdom. He invites Yudhishthira for a
game of dice, matching Yudhishthira
against Shakuni, the most skillful gam-
bler alive. Although Yudhishthira is a
model for truthfulness and virtue, his
fatal flaw is his love of gambling. In the
match Yudhishthira loses his kingdom,
all his possessions, his brothers, himself,
and finally his wife. In one of the epic’s
most powerful scenes, Duryodhana’s
brother, Duhshasana, drags Draupadi
by her hair into the assembly hall, her
clothes stained with her menstrual
blood. Draupadi’s humiliation moves
Dhrtarashtra to set them free, but also
sparks the enmity that helps drive the
rest of the plot. After some bargaining,
the parties agree that the Pandavas will
spend twelve years in exile and a thir-
teenth incognito. If they can remain
undiscovered during the thirteenth year
they will regain their kingdom. If they
are discovered, however, the cycle of
exile will begin again.
After thirteen years, Yudhishthira
and his brothers approach Duryodhana
for their rightful share, but are haughtily
rebuffed. All efforts at conciliation fail;
Duryodhana claims that he will not give
them enough land in which to stick the
point of a needle. Pushed to the wall, the
Pandavas prepare for battle. On one side
are Yudhishthira and his brothers, aided
by their counselor Krishna. On the
other are Duryodhana and many
respected figures, such as Drona,
Bhishma, and Karna. For eighteen days
the battle rages, until most of the impor-
tant people are dead. Yudhishthira and
his brothers survive. Yudhishthira is
crowned king and rules righteously for
many years. Late in life he installs his
grandson, King Parikshit, on the throne.
With his siblings he takes a final journey
into the Himalayas. During the journey
his brothers fall dead, one by one;Mahabhashya
Yudhishthira eventually enters the
divine realm.
The complete epic is more complex
than this summary. One of the features
of the epic is that it contains many unre-
lated tales, for which the main story acts
as a frame. Aside from being a tale of a
dysfunctional family, the Mahabharata
also contains a great deal of cultural wis-
dom, making the names of characters
symbolic even today. A televised serial of
the text, which ran for more than a year
in 1989–90, was wildly popular through-
out India. It is also interesting to note
that many traditional Indian families
will not keep a copy of the text in the
house, since it is believed that to do this
will foster discord in the family.
Mahabhashya
(“Great commentary”) A commentary
on the Ashtadhyayi of Panini, written
by Patanjali, the grammarian, in the
second century B.C.E. Panini’s text gives a
complete and accurate description of all
the forms of the Sanskrit language and
set the standard for the language after
[[401]]
Mahabrahman
his time. Although the Ashtadhyayi is
considered a masterpiece, it appears to
invite more detailed commentary
because it is written in a series of apho-
risms or sutra. Each of these aphorisms
provides the basis for those which fol-
low. Panini’s ultimate purpose is to give
a complete account of the language in
the briefest possible space. Aside from
expanding and expounding Panini’s
grammar, Patanjali also gives some use-
ful information of his own. The
Mahabhashya contains the earliest
known reference to the Greeks.
Mahabrahman
(“Great Brahman”) In traditional Indian
society, a debased class of brahmins
who officiate at rites for the dead, espe-
cially at the rites performed immediately
after death. In many of these rites the
Mahabrahman is identified with the
deceased person and is fed and given
gifts that are intended to help satisfy the
soul of the deceased. These acts are seen
as transferring the inauspiciousness of
death from the family to the
Mahabrahman. Such constant associa-
tion with death and its inauspicious
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable
way to make a living; Mahabrahmans
have extremely low social status, despite
being brahmins by birth. As compensa-
tion for taking on such inauspicious-
ness, Mahabrahmans usually demand
high payment from a family. For further
information see Jonathan Parry,
“Ghosts,
Greed
and
Sin: The
Occupational Identity of the Benares
Funeral Priests,” in Man, Vol. 15, 1980.
Mahadeva
(“great God”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
Mahadeviyakka
(12th c.) Poet-saint and religious leader
in the Lingayat religious community,
a bhakti (devotional) community cen-
tered on both the worship of Shiva
as the single supreme god and on the
[[402]]

rejection of all caste regulations. The
Lingayats were formed in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka, where they
still have a considerable presence. The
collections of poetry that form their
most important religious texts are com-
posed in the Kannada language.
Mahadeviyakka was a contemporary of
Basavanna and Allama Prabhu; her sta-
tus in the community is marked by the
suffix akka (“elder sister”). According to
tradition, she was devoted to Shiva at a
very young age and considered him to
be her true husband. This caused great
problems during a brief, unhappy mar-
riage, a mismatch between a carnally
inclined man and a woman who would
have no human lover. She eventually left
her husband, wandering naked as a sign
that she had cast away all attachments.
She later became associated with the
Lingayats, known as the “Lord’s men.”
The theme running through most of her
poetry is love for Shiva, sometimes as
her husband and sometimes as her
adulterous lover, both portraying her
struggles with the world. For further
information see A. K. Ramanujan,
Speaking of Shiva, 1973.
Mahakaleshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
sacred city of Ujjain in the state of
Madhya Pradesh. The temple is named
for its presiding deity, the god Shiva in
his manifestation as the “Lord of Death.”
Shiva is present at Mahakaleshvar in the
form of a linga, a pillar-shaped image.
The Mahakaleshvar linga is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a network of sites at
which Shiva is uniquely present. The
linga is in an underground room,
reached only by traversing a long, dark
passageway. This passage may symbol-
ize the darkness and terror of death.
Worship at Mahakaleshvar is believed to
protect one from an early or untimely
death, and at death, bring liberation of
the soul (moksha).
The city of Ujjain has a long history
as a sacred, economic, and political cen-
ter. One of the Seven Sacred CitiesMahamandaleshvar
(Saptapuri), it also has other important
religious sites. Historically, Ujjain is said
to have been the capital of King
Vikramaditya, founder of the Vikram
Era. Trade routes that passed through it
made it economically prosperous.
Mahakali
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythol-
ogy of the Goddess, the three parts of
this text describe the goddess in three
different manifestations: Mahasaraswati,
Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali. All of
these manifestations are extremely
powerful, but Mahakali is the most
ferocious of all. She is said to have
sprung from the forehead of the
Goddess, as a physical manifestation
of the deity’s rage when insulted by
the demon generals Chanda and
Munda, who denigrate her fighting
ability because she was a woman.
According to the story, Mahakali is
black in color, thin, and haggard, with
long teeth and nails, and utters terrify-
ing cries. She defeats the demon
armies by picking them up and stuffing
them into her mouth, consuming them
whole. She later kills Chanda and
Munda by cutting off their heads. Her
final adversary is Raktabija, who has
received the boon that any drop of his
blood falling to the earth will instantly
turn into a copy of him, rendering him
practically
unconquerable.
Kali
defeats this demon by drinking his
blood as it is shed, until finally it is
completely gone. For more informa-
tion on Mahakali and all the goddesses
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986; and John
Stratton Hawley and Donna Wullf
(eds.), Devi, 1996.
Mahakavya
An epic poem in Sanskrit literature.
According to tradition, there are six
such mahakavyas: the Kumarasambhava,
Meghaduta, and Raghuvamsha by the
poet Kalidasa; the Shishupala-vadha
by the poet Magha; the Kiratarjuniya by the
poet Bharavi, and the Naishadacharitra by
the poet-king Harsha.
Mahalakshmi
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, the three parts of this
text describe this goddess in three differ-
ent manifestations: Mahasaraswati,
Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali. Unlike
the goddess Lakshmi, who is a sedate
and propitious married goddess,
Mahalakshmi is seen as a powerful war-
rior goddess, the premier divine power
on the earth. She is formed from the col-
lected radiance (tejas) of all the gods, in
order to kill a demon named
Mahishasura, against whom the gods
have been unable to prevail. Her climac-
tic act in the Devimahatmya is killing
Mahishasura, despite his desperate
attempts first to defeat and then to
elude her. For more information on
Mahalakshmi and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Mahamandaleshvar
(“Great Lord of the Region”) Term of
respect given to a Mandaleshvar when
one of his disciples is chosen a
Mandaleshvar while the preceptor is still
living. Mandaleshvars are the learned
ascetics who lead the Naga akharas of
the Dashanami Sanyasis, a practice that
began in the nineteenth century. The
Dashanami Nagas are renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary sol-
diers. Their rough-and-ready qualities
made them effective soldiers, but gave
them little preparation for formal
argument with Christian missionaries.
Mandaleshvars were chosen from
among the more learned Paramahamsa
ascetics, so that the latter could provide
a more coherent and telling opposition;
he also serves as the Nagas’ teacher and
spiritual adviser. The enshrinement of
[[403]]
Mahamandapa
Mahant Bhagwan Das, renowned sadhu, attends the Kumbha Mela religious festival in Allahabad.
a Mandaleshvar’s disciple is thus seen as
boosting his teacher’s prestige to an
even more rarefied state.
Mahamandapa
The mahamandapa is an architectural
feature found in the Khajuraho varia-
tion of the Nagara architectural style.
Usually found in northern India, the
[[404]]

Nagara style emphasizes verticality, with
the whole temple building culminating
in a single highest point; in the
Khajuraho variant, the entire structure
gradually leads up to the central tower,
as foothills lead up to the mountains,
with the peak of this central tower
directly over the temple’s primary
image. In this style, the mahamandapa
is the name for the temple’s mainMahanubhav
entrance-hall, which was separated
from the main sanctuary (garbhagrha)
by a short vestibule named the antarala.
Mahamantra
A thirty-two syllable mantra, or sacred
formula, the recitation of which is the
primary religious act for devotees
(bhakta)
belonging
to
ISKCON
(International Society for Krishna
Consciousness), a group more popularly
known as the Hare Krishnas. The mantra
itself is “Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare; Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.”
Mahamaya
(“[she whose] power of illusion is great”)
Epithet of the Goddess in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important textual source for the notion
that God is female. This epithet reflects
her position as the sole and supreme
power in the universe, wielding the
power of illusion that obscures this fact
from human awareness. See Goddess.
Mahanirvani Akhara
The name of a group of the Naga class of
the Dashanami Sanyasis, a type of
renunciant ascetic. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akharas
or regiments on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers or traders;
both of these have largely disappeared
in contemporary times. This akhara is
described as taking part in a battle with
the forces of the Moghul emperor
Aurangzeb in 1664, and are credited
with saving the city of Benares from
being sacked.
The Mahanirvani Akhara is one of
the seven main Dashanami Naga akha-
ras and remains one of most influential.
The principal center of the Mahanirvani
Akhara is in Allahabad, site of the largest
and most important bathing (snana)
festivals, known as the Kumbha Mela.
Their strength in Allahabad has allowed
them to assume the most desirable spot
at the head of the bathing procession
during the Kumbha Mela. Each of the
akharas has a (guardian) deity who
defines their organizational identity; the
tutelary deity of the Mahanirvani Akhara
is the great sage Kapila.
Mahant
(“great”) Honorific title given to an
ascetic who is the leader of a monastery.
Mahants are chosen by their predeces-
sors and designate their successors.
While they are living, they have virtually
total control over the monastery and
its assets, even though they do not
own them. In any given ascetic
establishment, the mahant has very
high status, since he is the absolute ruler
of his small domain.
Mahanubhav
(“Great Experience”) A regional religious
community, whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and
who are found mainly in the central
regions of the state of Maharashtra. The
Mahanubhavs were founded by
Chakradhar in the thirteenth century.
Under his influence the community has
rejected many aspects of “mainstream”
Hindu religious life: social distinctions
based on caste, the worship of images,
and the religious authority of brahmins.
The community is also noted for
espousing an ascetic way of life.
Although the Mahanubhavs are consid-
ered Vaishnavas, they acknowledge only
one God, whom they call Parameshvar
(“Great Lord”), and whom they conceive
as having had five incarnations. Two of
these incarnations are established fig-
ures in the Hindu pantheon, the god
Krishna and the deified ascetic
Dattatreya. The other three are sectari-
an figures: their founder Chakradhar,
Chakradhar’s guru, and his guru’s guru.
Their modern practice stresses pilgrim-
age, vows, and almsgiving. Nevertheless,
through much of Maharashtra there is a
[[405]]

legacy of suspicion and mistrust of the
Mahanubhavs, perhaps rooted in their
anti-authoritarian history. For further
information see Anne Feldhaus, The
Religious System of the Mahanubhav
Sect, 1983.
Mahapataka
(“Great Sinner”) In the dharma litera-
ture, a person who has committed one
of the Four Great Crimes, namely mur-
dering a brahmin (brahmahatya), steal-
ing a brahmin’s gold (steya), drinking
liquor (surapana), or committing adul-
tery with the wife of one’s guru (guru-
talpaga). These crimes were considered
so heinous that the performer became
an outcast from society. Another indica-
tion of the gravity of these acts was that
their expiations (prayashchitta) were so
severe that they normally ended in
death; in some cases this outcome was
specifically prescribed. Aside from pre-
scribing such punishments for the actual
offenders, the dharma literature also
prescribed similar outcaste status for
anyone who knowingly associated with
such people for more than one year.
[[406]]

Mahapatra
(“great vessel”) In parts of northern
India, the name of a debased brahmin
group whose members gain their liveli-
hood primarily through receiving gifts,
particularly those given following a
death. Such brahmins do not actually
perform the rites for the dead, although
they are seen as symbolically represent-
ing the dead person. Their low status
stems from this connection with the
dead; the gifts they accept transfer the
inauspiciousness of death from the
family to the Mahapatra. This latter
assumption is reflected in the group’s
name—they are “vessels” into which
one can deposit such inauspiciousness,
and thus be rid of it. Such constant asso-
ciation with death and its inauspicious
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable
way to make a living, giving this group
extremely low social status, despite
being brahmins by birth. Despite their
debased status, they are a necessary part
of traditional society, in that they serve
as the means through which such inaus-
piciousness can be removed.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
Mahar
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. The Mahars
were
an
untouchable
jati
in
Maharashtrian society, performing vari-
ous services and labor for the landlord
communities. The Mahars are famous
for two figures: the medieval bhakti
poet Chokamela, and the modern jurist
and social reformer Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.
Maharashtra
Modern Indian state along the Arabian
Sea, stretching east over the Western
Ghats to encompass the northern part
of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is
one of the “linguistic” states formed
after Indian independence in 1947;
these states were created to unite people
with a common language and culture (in
this case, Marathi) under one state gov-
ernment. It was formed in 1960 by split-
ting the former state of Bombay into the
present states of Gujarat and
Maharashtra. Bombay, the capital, is the
financial and industrial center of mod-
ern India. The western regions are heav-
ily industrialized; the eastern regions are
more agricultural, dominated by sugar
plantations. Historically, Maharashtra is
the homeland of the Marathas, a group
whose eighteenth-century empire
stretched across much of northern
India. The Rashtriya Svayamsevak
Sangh and the Shiv Sena, two Hindu
nationalist organizations that have both
tried to influence Indian politics, were
founded in Maharashtra. Along with its
economic and political importance, the
state contains many important histori-
cal, cultural, and religious sites.
Historical and cultural sites include the
rock-cut caves of Ellora, a UNESCO World
Heritage Site; the Buddhist caves at
Ajanta; and the cave temple at
Elephanta in the Bombay harbor. Places
of religious importance include the
Godavari and Bhima rivers and their
attendant sacred sites (tirthas); the sites
associated with the saints of the Varkari
Panth religious community, particularly
the temple to the god Vithoba at
Pandharpur; and three of the jyotirlin-
gas, which are sites particularly holy to
the god Shiva: Bhimashankar,
Ghrneshvar, and Tryambakeshvar. For
general information about Maharashtra
and other regions of India, see Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Maharashtri
Southern Indian brahmins who make
up one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are Gujarati, Karnata,
Andhra, and Dravida. As their name
would indicate, the core region for
Maharashtri brahmins is the modern
state of Maharashtra. The Maharashtri
brahmins are themselves divided
into two subgroups: the Chitpavan, or
Konkanastha brahmins, who live in
the
coastal
regions,
and
the
Deshastha brahmins, who live further
inland in the Deccan.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
(b. Mahesh Prasad Verma, 1911) Hindu
teacher and founder of the religious
technique known as Transcendental
Meditation (TM). The Maharishi (“Great
Sage”) was trained as an engineer, but
eventually renounced the world after
meeting one of the Shankaracharyas, a
name given to the most important mod-
ern Hindu religious leaders. He stayed
with Shankaracharya for the next twelve
years, in pursuit of spiritual knowledge.
He established an ashram at Rishikesh
but was relatively unknown until his
association with the Beatles, the British
musical group who came to India with
him on pilgrimage. In the early 1970s, TM
instructors
traveled
throughout
American college campuses, touting the
[[407]]
Mahasaraswati
physiological and spiritual benefits of
meditation and providing people (for a
fee) with a mantra or sacred sound that
would bring them these benefits.
According to TM proponents, meditation
is also supposed to have pacific effects
on the larger environment, and result in
reduced crime, tension, and hatred.
During
this
period
Maharishi
International University was established
at the former Parsons College in
Fairfield, Iowa, as a center to teach TM. In
the late 1970s, Maharishi University
instituted a program training people to
develop the six classical superhuman
powers (siddhis). Since then several dis-
appointed patrons have won lawsuits
against the organization.
Mahasaraswati
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, the text describes this
goddess in three different manifesta-
tions: Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi,
and Mahakali. The opening story begins
at the creation of the cosmos. As the god
Brahma emerges from the lotus sprout-
ing from the god Vishnu’s navel, he is
beset by two demons named Madhu
and Kaitabha, who try to kill him.
Brahma tries to elude the demons, but
because Vishnu is fast asleep, overcome
by the power of the Goddess, he cannot
give Brahma any help. It is only when
Brahma praises the Goddess that she
leaves Vishnu, letting him awake. She
then clouds the demons’ minds so that
they can be tricked (and killed) by
Vishnu. In the pantheon, Saraswati is
the goddess associated with art, learn-
ing, and culture—anything involving the
life and activity of the intellectual and
aesthetic faculties. Mahasaraswati is
also connected with intellect, emphasiz-
ing her ability to control people’s per-
ceptions. For more information on
Mahasaraswati and the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
[[408]]

Mahat
(“great one”) In the account of evolution
found in the Samkhya philosophical
school, mahat is the first evolutionary
stage. It consists of the initial distur-
bance of prakrti (primal matter)
transforming from its original state
of equilibrium. Mahat is called the
“great one” because prakrti remains
unchanged. Mahat is also known
as buddhi, the mental faculty for
awareness, apperception, and decision
making that is believed to be at the root
of mental processes. The mental
processes facilitated by buddhi spur the
development of the next stage in the
evolution, ahamkar or subjective con-
sciousness, after which the division of
the world into subjective and objective
spheres proceeds.
Mahavakya
(“great utterance”) Short statements
from the speculative texts known as the
Upanishads, called “great” because they
reveal the true nature of reality and of
the Self. One of the most famous
mahavakya is tat tvam asi (“that thou
art”), expressing the unity of the Self
with Brahman. Other well known utter-
ances are ayamatma Brahman (“This
Self is Brahman”), sarvam idam khalu
Brahman (“Truly, this universe is
Brahman”), aham brahmasmi (“I am
Brahman”), and prajnanam Brahman
(“Knowledge is Brahman”). These great
utterances are most important in the
leap philosophy propounded by the
philosopher Sureshvara. Leap philoso-
phers believe that complete freedom is
possible, but out of our immediate con-
trol, in that it cannot be gained by a pre-
cisely specified sequence of causes and
effects. According to Sureshvara’s under-
standing, when a person whose under-
standing has been purified hears one of
these mahavakyas, the profound truth
in the utterance brings the flash of
insight that brings final liberation of the
soul (moksha).Mahipati
Mahavidyas
A collective name for ten fierce and
powerful manifestations of the Goddess.
According to tradition, the goddess Sati
assumes these forms one after another,
in an attempt to persuade her husband,
the god Shiva, to allow her to attend a
sacrifice given by her father Daksha.
These ten forms are all frightful and
fearsome, even to Shiva, showing the
ultimate superiority of the Goddess over
Shiva. These ten forms are Kali, Tara,
Chinnamasta, Bhuvaneshvari, Bagala,
Dhumavati, Kamala, Matangi, Shodashi,
and Bhairavi. Some of these forms, par-
ticularly Kali, have become important
deities in their own right. For further
information see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Mahayuga
A unit of cosmic time. According to tra-
ditional Hindu reckoning, time has nei-
ther beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with the active phase known as
the Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
as the Night of Brahma. In one reckon-
ing of cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is
divided into one thousand mahayugas
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each
mahayuga is composed of four eras,
named the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each is
shorter and more evil than its predeces-
sor; by the end of the Kali Yuga, things
have gotten so bad that the only solu-
tion is the destruction and recreation of
the earth, at which time the next Krta
Yuga begins.
Mahendravarman
(r. 600–630) Ruler in southern India dur-
ing the Pallava dynasty, when it was a
stronghold of Tamil culture. According
to tradition, Mahendravarman was born
a Jain, but became a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva under the influence of the
poet-saint Appar. Mahendravarman
was a cultured man and a patron
of the arts, as well as the author of
the play Mattvavilasa (“Sport of
Drunkards”), which was popular
throughout southern India. The rock-
cut temples at Mahabalipuram were
built during his reign. He fought
with the surrounding monarchs, espe-
cially the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II;
it was in battle with Pulakeshin’s forces
that Mahendravarman met his death.

Mahipati
(1715–1790) Writer and hagiographer of
the devotional (bhakti) poet-saints, par-
ticularly those saints connected with the
Varkari Panth, to which Mahipati him-
self belonged. The Varkari Panth is a reli-
gious community centered around the
worship of the Hindu god Vithoba,
whose temple at Pandharpur is in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Mahipati was a
civil servant in his home town. One day
he was summoned to his job without
being able to finish his daily worship.
Mahipati did the business at hand, but
then resigned his position, vowing never
to use his pen except in the service of
the saints. Mahipati freely admitted that
much of his material on the saints was
drawn from earlier works, particularly
the Bhaktamal written by the poet-
saint Nabhadas. As with Nabhadas, he
presents each of his subjects as a para-
digm of devotion; the stories reinforce
and validate the power of devotion to
overcome all obstacles. His major
works are the Bhaktavijaya and the
Bhaktililamrta; the former has been
translated by Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole as Stories of Indian

Mahishasura
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, Mahishasura is the
buffalo-demon who is responsible for
the birth of the Goddess. Mahishasura
receives the boon that he cannot be
killed by any male and is able to van-
quish the gods. They are driven from
their heavenly realm and take shelter in
the mountains. While they are there, the
assembly of the gods let forth their col-
lected radiance (tejas), coalescing into
the figure of the Goddess, who repre-
sents all their collected power. The
Goddess rides off on a lion to challenge
Mahishasura. He falls in love with her,
but when he proposes marriage, she
declares she will only marry the man
who can defeat her in battle. A fierce
battle ensues; Mahishasura is defeated.
He tries to elude the Goddess by chang-
ing his form several times, but she keeps
striking each one with her sword, finally
killing him by cutting off his head.
Mahishi
In Hindu mythology, the name of a
buffalo-demoness killed by the god
Aiyappa. Mahishi receives the boon that
she can only be killed by a person not
born from the union of male and female.
To circumvent this boon, Aiyappa is
born of a union of the gods Shiva and
Vishnu, when the latter takes the form
of the enchantress Mohini. When
Mahishi is killed, the female figure of
Lila rises from her body. Lila wants to
marry Aiyappa; he agrees that he will
marry her in the year a celibate pilgrim
does not come to visit him at Shabari
Malai. Since women of childbearing age
are forbidden to visit Shabari Malai, and
those men who come are required to be
celibate, Lila is still waiting for this vow
to be fulfilled.

Mahishmati
Ancient city on the Narmada River in
central India. During the fifth century
B.C.E., Mahishmati was the outer bound-
ary for the expansion of the Aryan.
Mahmud of Ghazni
(998–1030) Turkish ruler whose capital
was at Ghazni (now in modern
Afghanistan). Between 1001 and 1027,
Mahmud made seventeen raids into
India, lured by the tales of India’s fabu-
lous wealth. His plundering was aided
by the fragmented political life in north-
ern India, which prevented Hindus from
forming any effective opposition.
Mahmud struck at many of the centers
in northern India, particularly pilgrim-
age centers, which were renowned for
their wealth: Multan, Mathura,
Thanesar, Kanauj (which never recov-
ered after being sacked in 1018), and
finally Somnath, from which he report-
edly took tremendous booty. Although
these raids often entailed iconoclasm
(the destruction of religious imagery),
as at the Shiva temple in Somnath,
Mahmud’s fundamental motives were
economic—replenishing his coffers
with as much plunder as possible,
and returning to Ghazni before the
advent of the hot season. As such he is
different from some of the later Muslim
kings, such the Moghuls, who actually
exercised political sway over much of
India. Aside from his pillaging raids,
Mahmud is associated with the scholar
Alberuni.
Alberuni
accompanied
Mahmud on one of these expeditions,
later using his observations to write an
account of Hindu life and culture. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Maithila
Northern Indian brahmins who make
up Pancha Gauda, one of the five north-
ern brahmin communities; the other
four communities are Kanaujia, Gauda,
Utkala, and Saraswat. Maithila brah-
mins are a small community, found only
in the Mithila region in the northernMala
part of modern Bihar. Despite the
community’s size, Maithila brahmins
are well known for their commitment
to learning and culture, as exemplified
by their most famous member, the
poet Vidyapati.unknown. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti
and Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1972; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the
Three Cities, 1990.
MaithunaMakarasana
(“copulation”) In the secret ritually-
based religious practice known as
tantra, sexual intercourse is the fifth
and last of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara); the panchamakara
are used in their actual forms in “left
hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
whereas they are represented by sym-
bolic substitutes in “right hand” (dak-
shinachara) tantric ritual. Many
traditions in Hindu tantra describe ritu-
alized sexual intercourse as a symbol of
the ultimate union of the god Shiva and
his wife Shakti. Ritual sexuality must be
seen in the larger tantric context. One of
the most pervasive tantric assumptions
is the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle means that the adept must
reject all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality; in this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding con-
sumption of intoxicants, nonvegetari-
an food, and illicit sexuality in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a
more exclusive qualification (adhikara),
and is thus superior to common prac-
tice. In some forms of this ritual the
woman is the initiate’s wife, who is
worshiped before intercourse as a
manifestation of the Goddess. In other
cases this ritual intercourse is por-
trayed as adulterous, usually with a
woman of very low status, to magnify
the social boundaries being trans-
gressed. This latter practice is uncom-
mon now, at least in southern India,
where Brooks describes it as virtually(“crocodile seat”) In Indian iconogra-
phy, a base on which an image may
be placed. The base is a figure of a
crocodile, with a flat part on its back for
the image.
Makara Sankranti
Religious festival that falls on the day the
sun makes the transition (sankranti)
into the zodiacal sign of Capricorn
(makara). According to Western astrol-
ogy, this occurs around December 20,
but in Indian astrology (jyotisha), this
occurs on January 14. This is one of the
few celebrations in the festival year
marked by the solar rather than the
lunar calendar. On Makara Sankranti,
the sun is reckoned as beginning its
“northward journey” (uttarayana). This
will continue until Karka Sankranti six
months later, when the sun enters
Cancer, and begins its “southward jour-
ney” (dakshinayana). Since the uttarayana
is believed to be more auspicious than
its counterpart, the day marking this
transition is deemed particularly aus-
picious. Makara Sankranti is primarily
a bathing (snana) festival; great num-
bers of people come to bathe in rivers
on that day, especially the Ganges. The
largest bathing festival on the Ganges
is at Sagar Island in state of West
Bengal (also known as Ganga Sagar),
celebrated as the place where the
Ganges empties into the sea at the Bay
of Bengal.
Mala
(“garland”) This word denotes any sort
of necklace. Garlands made of flowers
are ubiquitous throughout India, both
as offerings to a deity—around whose
neck they are placed as adornment—or
[[411]]
Malabar
Ascetic wearing a mala of sacred wooden beads.
given in the same way to any honored
guest as a sign of welcome and respect.
Garlands or necklaces made from more
permanent materials are important
pieces of religious paraphernalia, and in
some cases carry clear sectarian associ-
ations. Many Shaivas wear malas made
from rudraksha beads, an aniconic
form of their patron deity, Shiva. In the
same way, many Vaishnavas will wear a
mala made from the wood of the Tulsi
plant, since this plant is said to be a form
of the goddess Lakshmi, the spouse of
their patron deity Vishnu. Although
these materials serve as sectarian mark-
ers, malas used for ritual purposes can
be made from virtually any material.
Most favored are substances such as
amber, rock crystal, coral, semiprecious
stones, and gemstones—materials
which are durable, valuable, and not
formed by human hands.
For ritual purposes, malas are used
to keep count during mantra recitation
(japa), by moving one bead through the
[[412]]

finger and thumb with each recitation.
Such malas are usually strung with 108
pieces. Each mala has one bead set apart
from the others; mantra recitation
always begins with this bead. This bead
symbolizes Mount Meru, the mythical
mountain that is the cosmic pivot support-
ing the entire created order. According to
established practice, when one has
reached the end of the mala and has
come back to the Meru bead, one should
reverse directions. By virtue of never
passing over the Meru bead, one is thus
symbolically circling Mount Meru as the
center of the universe.
This connection with daily religious
practice makes malas powerful religious
objects, believed to be charged by their
owners’ spiritual energy. For this reason,
malas are almost never exchanged—
except for a mala given by a guru to a
disciple. Most malas are touched only by
the owner. People doing recitation will
often keep the hand and mala concealed
in a cloth bag (known as a gomukh or
“cow’s mouth”), as a barrier to poten-
tially corrupting outside forces. The
conviction that a mala absorbs its
owner’s spiritual energy also lies behind
the taboo on repairing and reusing a
broken mala. According to popular
belief, a mala breaks because it gradual-
ly draws off its owner’s negative spiritual
forces. Once broken, a mala should
therefore be discarded, to prevent the
owner from coming back into contact
with this potentially damaging energy.
Malabar
Traditional name for the southern
Indian coastal region bordering the
Arabian sea, in the modern states of
Kerala and Karnataka.
Malamasa
(“Impure month”) An intercalary
month inserted into the lunar calendar
about every 21⁄2 years, to correct the
discrepancy between the lunar and
the solar calendars. Although this
month is necessary to maintain theMallikarjuna
correspondence between the two calen-
dars—and thus, for example, to keep
the spring festivals in the spring—it is
considered an unusual event, impure
and ritually dangerous.
Malatimadhava
Play written by the Sanskrit dramatist
Bhavabhuti (early 8th c.), who was par-
ticularly noted for his ability to express
and transmit the play of emotions
through language. The play’s general
plot is the triumphant love between
Malati and her beloved Madhava (an
epithet of the god Krishna), despite
numerous obstacles along the way. The
drama is noted as an exquisite poetic
work, but also because the primary
villain is an evil ascetic, generally
believed to be a member of the extinct
ascetic sect known as Kapalikas. The
Kapalikas were devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva, emulating him in his wrathful
form as Bhairava: wearing the hair long
and matted, smearing the body with
ash (preferably from the cremation
ground), and bearing a club and a
skull-bowl (kapala). The Kapilikas are
cited as indulging in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs,
performing human sacrifice, and
orgiastic sexuality—which made them
feared. Bhavabhuti’s description is
one of the earliest references to
Shaiva asceticism, and thus historically
significant. The play has been translated
into English by Michael Coulson and
published in an anthology titled Three
Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Mali
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
The jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Malis’
hereditary occupation was tending gar-
dens, growing flowers, and making
flower garlands (mala).
Mallikarjuna
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on the
holy mountain Shrishaila in Andhra
Pradesh. The temple is named for its
presiding deity, the god Shiva in his
manifestation as the “[Lord] White as
Jasmine.” Shiva is present at Mallikarjuna
in the form of a linga, a pillar-shaped
image. The Mallikarjuna linga is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, a network of
sites at which Shiva is uniquely present.
Mallikarjuna’s charter myth is based on
a competition between Shiva’s two
sons, Ganesh and Skanda, who agree
that the first one to circle the earth will
be the first one to be married. Skanda
mounts his peacock and takes off, sure
that he is faster. Ganesh, however, sim-
ply walks around Shiva and his wife
Parvati, as a symbol that they are the
entire universe. When Skanda returns,
he is very angry to discover that he has
been beaten. He leaves Kailas, the
Himalayan mountain believed to be
Shiva’s abode, and goes to southern
India. Parvati is very upset at the
absence of her son, but none of the
envoys they send can persuade Skanda
to return. Finally, Shiva and Parvati go
themselves, landing on Shrishaila
mountain. Skanda has already departed
for a nearby mountain. Before following
after him, his parents consecrate the
first site as Mallikarjuna.
As with all the jyotirlingas, Mallikarjuna
is deemed a very powerful site. Worship-
ing this jyotirlinga is said to bring the
increase of wealth, freedom from dis-
ease, well-being, and any other desired
end. The site itself is a difficult place to
reach, deep in the jungle on the top of
Shrishaila mountain. For this reason,
the major festival celebrated here is
Shivaratri, the most important festival
to Shiva during the entire year, when
devotees (bhakta) come and stay for
several days.
[[413]]
Mallinatha
Mallinatha
(14th c.?) Sanskrit scholar and com-
mentator noted for his commentaries
on the plays written by the poet
Kalidasa (5th c.?); these commentaries
have become sources for interpreting
the texts. Although the subject of his
commentary was largely “secular” poetry,
Mallinatha himself was a Jain, and may
have been a monk. His work illustrates
the important role that the Jains played
in the preservation of Indian literary
culture. In addition to their commen-
taries, they copied and recopied the
manuscripts, a never-ending task due to
the fragile nature of the palm leaves on
which they were written.
Malviya, Madan Mohan
(1861–1946) Hindu activist and founder
of Benares Hindu University. Malviya
belonged to the first generation of
Hindus seeking to reclaim India from
British rule; these men were well
educated, politically active, and pas-
sionately committed to traditional
Hindu culture. Benares Hindu University
was founded in 1916 to uphold Hindu
cultural and philosophical traditions, as
well as to educate students in the sci-
ences, preparing them for the modern
world. Aside from his work in education,
Malviya organized and supported
Hindu religious causes, in particular a
ban on cow slaughter and opposition to
a proposed dam on the Ganges River at
the pilgrimage city of Haridwar. The
dam would have restricted the free flow
of the Ganges, so in 1914 and 1916, he
spent considerable energy organizing
opposition so that a compromise with
the government could be found. For a
glowing account of his life, see M. A.
Parmanand, Mahamana Madan Mohan
Malviya, 1985.
Malwa
Traditional name for the plateau in
Madhya Pradesh centered around the
city of Ujjain, the region’s traditional
capital. During the seventeenth and
[[414]]

eighteenth centuries, the Malwa region
was one of the centers for the
Rajasthani school of miniature paint-
ing. The Rajasthani style is generally
characterized by a flat perspective.
Visual power is derived from bands of
vivid colors that often serve as a back-
drop to the painting.
Mamsa
(“meat”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, meat is
the third of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara); the panchamakara
are used in their actual forms in “left
hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
whereas they are represented by sym-
bolic substitutes in “right hand” (dak-
shinachara) tantric ritual. “Respectable”
Hindu society strongly condemns the
consumption of nonvegetarian food; its
ritual use therefore must be seen in the
larger tantric context. One of the most
pervasive tantric assumptions is the
ultimate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that
the entire universe is one principle
means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality; in this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts
cite such ritual use of forbidden things
as proof that their practice involves a
more exclusive qualification (adhikara),
and is thus superior to common prac-
tice. For further information see Arthur
Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) Shakti and
Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda

Three Cities, 1990.
Manas
(“mind”) In the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schoolsManasarovar
Pilgrims circling Mt. Kailas traditionally begin the journey with a bath at Manasarovar.
of Hindu philosophy, manas is one of
the stages in the devolution of prakrti
(primal matter), resulting in the world
that we see around us, in which human
souls are subject to reincarnation (sam-
sara). Manas evolves from the step
known as ahamkar—the stage marked
by the first sense of Self and subjectivity.
The mind (manas) develops as the
source of intellectual activity which, col-
ored by this feeling of subjectivity, cre-
ates the notion of an individual identity.
According to the Samkhyas, concurrent
with this mental identity comes the
development of the individual’s sense
organs (jnanendriyas) and the organs of
action (karmendriyas), as well as the
subtle elements (tanmatras) that are the
source for the world’s material objects.
Although later philosophical schools
largely rejected Samkhya cosmology,
manas became generally accepted as
one of the five human sense organs. As
the eye perceives sight and the ears per-
ceive sound, the manas perceives men-
tal objects (ideas), allowing the subject
to experience them.
Manasa
Manasa is a regional goddess consid-
ered to be a form of the Goddess. She is
worshiped mainly in eastern India, and
is primarily associated with snakes and
snakebites. As with Shitala, the goddess,
whose divine presence was considered
to be revealed by infection with small-
pox, Manasa’s divine presence comes
violently with snakebites, considered
a form of divine possession. This con-
ception shows the ambivalent nature
of many regional goddesses who are
both powerful and dangerous. When
Manasa appears, it is always traumatic,
and sometimes tragic; such is the nature
of human interactions with divinity.
Manasa is worshiped both to keep
people free from snakebites—a very
real concern in an agricultural country
with highly venomous snakes—or for
the recovery of a person who has been
bitten. Her worship is marked by
annual festivals at which people sing
songs in her honor, and which are
often marked by divine possession and
snake-handling.
Manasarovar
Lake and sacred site (tirtha) close to the
base of Mount Kailas in Tibet. Pilgrims
walking around Mt. Kailas traditionally
begin their circuit with a bath in the lake
before proceeding to the mountain. The
lake is traditionally thought to be one of
the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
[[415]]
Manava Dharma Shastra
Mandalas can be depicted as complex concentric designs.
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess, Sati,
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Manasarovar was the
palm of Sati’s right hand. See also pitha.
Manava Dharma Shastra
Another name for the text on religious
duty (dharma) and social order
ascribed to the mythical sage Manu. See
Manu Smrti.
Mandakini River
Himalayan tributary of the Ganges
River, which joins with the Alakananda
River at the hill town of Rudraprayag
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. As with
all the Himalayan tributaries of the
Ganges, the Mandakini is considered
sacred. Important pilgrimage places
(tirtha) along it include Kedarnath,
which is at its headwaters, Guptakashi,
and Rudraprayag.
[[416]]

Mandala
(“circle”) As with many Sanskrit terms, a
word with different meanings in differ-
ent contexts. In the context of geogra-
phy it can imply a region, as in the case
of the Braj region, known as the Braj
Mandala. In the context of the ras lila,
the circle dance between the god
Krishna and his devotees (bhakta),
mandala refers to the group of devotees
as well as to the shape of the dance itself.
By extension, mandala can refer to any
group of people, although it carries the
connotation of people who have gath-
ered for some serious religious purpose.
In the context of the secret ritually-
based religious practice known as
tantra, mandala refers to a symbolic
diagram used as an aid to meditation, as
a ritual accessory, or as a symbolic road
map of the spiritual quest. In this con-
text, mandala is more characteristic of
Buddhist tantra, with Hindu tantrikas
more frequently using the terms yantra
and chakra.Mandapa
Mandaleshvar
(“Lord of the Region”) Term of respect
for the ascetics chosen to head the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis in
their disputations with Christian mis-
sionaries. The Dashanami Nagas are
groups of renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva and who for-
merly made their living as traders and
mercenary soldiers. Their rough-and-
ready qualities made them effective sol-
diers but gave them little preparation for
formal argument. The Mandaleshvars
were chosen by the Nagas from among
the more learned Paramahamsa
ascetics, providing a more coherent and
telling opposition to Christian mission-
aries. An ascetic who becomes a
Mandaleshvar becomes the spiritual
adviser and the teacher of the
Dashanami Naga members of the
akhara, who deem him a spiritual
preceptor as much as their own gurus.
Mandana Mishra
(early 9th c.) Founder of the Bhamati
school of Advaita Vedanta, who is tradi-
tionally held to be a contemporary of
Shankaracharya, the Advaita school’s
greatest figure. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical theory known
as monism—the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,
which are merely differing forms of that
reality. Advaita proponents claim that
reality is non-dual (advaita)—all things
are nothing but the formless, unquali-
fied Brahman (the highest reality in the
universe), despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity. For the Advaitins,
the assumption of diversity is a funda-
mental misunderstanding of the ulti-
mate nature of things, a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding
that ultimately causes human beings to
be trapped in karmic bondage, reincar-
nation (samsara), and suffering.
Mandana suggests the vivarta (“illu-
sory manifestation”) causal relationship
to show how the unchanging Brahman
is connected with the world as it is per-
ceived. The concept of superimposition
(adhyasa) shows how humans project a
mistaken understanding onto the cor-
rect understanding. For example, a
piece of rope is mistaken for a snake.
Although this judgment is erroneous,
one is actually perceiving something
real, in this case the rope, but “superim-
posing” a different and mistaken identity
on it, thus “transforming” it into some-
thing it is not. In the same way, it is
argued, human consciousness begins
with the existent reality (Brahman),
which is actually there, but superimposes
onto it something which is not (the
judgment of a diverse world).
Mandana also differed from
Shankaracharya on several points, pos-
ing problems for his later followers. One
of these judgments was that the locus of
ignorance was in the Self, since it was
absurd to conceive of Brahman as sub-
ject to ignorance; another was that there
were multiple Selves, since the libera-
tion of one person did not cause the lib-
eration of all. Mandana’s comments
presuppose the existence of a common
(if illusory) world, upon which he felt
called to render a judgment; he ended
up describing it as anirvachaniya—“that
which cannot be described.” In his
analysis, Mandana also distinguished
between two kinds of ignorance—a pri-
mal “covering” that keeps one from per-
ceiving the truth, and a “projective”
ignorance through which human beings
actively obscure things.
Mandapa
(“pavilion”) The mandapa is an architec-
tural feature found in the Khajuraho
variation of the Nagara architectural
style. Usually found in northern India,
the Nagara style emphasizes verticality,
with the whole temple building culmi-
nating in a single highest point. In the
Khajuraho style, the entire structure
gradually leads up to the central tower,
as foothills lead up to the mountains,
with the peak of this central tower
directly over the temple’s primary

image. In this style, the mandapa is the
name for a hall of the temple that is usually
between the entrance hall (ardhaman-
dapa) and the main hall (mahamandapa).
Mandara
In Hindu mythology, the name of a
sacred mountain where the minor
god Kubera and his court reside. In the
myth of the Tortoise avatar, Mount
Mandara is identified as the churning-
stick used to churn the ocean of milk
(the mountain’s tremendous size makes
it an effective churn).
Mandir
(“home”) In northern India, the most
common name for a temple in which
the image of a deity has been installed
and consecrated for worship. Although
such temples often have facilities for
congregational worship, social life, or
cultural events, the building’s primary
function is to serve as the home for the
deities assembled there and considered
the temple’s real owners.
[[418]]

Mandodari
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Mandodari is the
wife of the demon-king Ravana, and the
mother of Indrajit, Atikaya and
Akshakumara. Despite being a loving
and loyal wife to Ravana, Mandodari
continually advises him that he has
done wrong in kidnapping Rama’s wife
Sita. She pleads with him to come to
terms with Rama before it becomes
necessary to fight. Ravana refuses to
do so, because of his pride and his deter-
mination to avenge the insult to his
sister Shurpanakha, who has been
mutilated by Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
In the end, this stubbornness costs
Ravana his life.
Mandu
Hilltop fort in southwestern Madhya
Pradesh, about seventy miles south of
Indore. Although Mandu is deserted
today, it was the capital of a small king-
dom until the sixteenth century, and
was eventually assimilated into the
Moghul empire as a vassal state. DuringManikarnika
the early seventeenth century Mandu
was one of the important centers for the
Rajasthani style of miniature painting.
The Rajasthani style is generally charac-
terized by a flat perspective. Visual
power is derived from bands of vivid col-
ors that serve as a backdrop to the paint-
ing. See also Moghul dynasty.
Mandukya Upanishad
One of the speculative religious texts
known as the Upanishads, which form
the latest stratum of the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu sacred texts. The Mandukya
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to
investigate ultimate questions, in partic-
ular the nature of the Self (atman). The
Mandukya Upanishad is generally con-
sidered one of the latest upanishads,
based on its brevity—a mere twelve
verses—and on its concise articulation
of philosophical monism. The first verse
praises the sound Om, calling it the
essence of the entire universe. The sec-
ond verse identifies the world with
Brahman, the Self (atman) with
Brahman, and characterizes the Self as
having four quarters. The succeeding
verses describe the four quarters of the
Self, each of which removes another
layer of egoism: The first layer is
described as waking consciousness,
characterized by perceptions of subject
and object; the next is dream sleep,
which is sheer subjectivity; then deep
sleep, which has neither subject nor
object; and finally a mysterious state
simply called “the fourth” (turiya),
which is the Self itself.
Further verses identify these first
three states as corresponding to the
three parts of the sound Om: the vowels
“a” and “u” (which combine to form the
vowel “o”), and the letter “m.” The fourth
state is said to be “beyond all letters”
and without duality. The upanishad
explicitly states that to know this brings
one final liberation, in which one spon-
taneously merges with the Self.
Mangalam
(“auspicious”) Term whose root mean-
ing can be applied to anything believed
to bring good fortune: a benedictory for-
mula, a favorable omen or portent, an
auspicious ceremony such as marriage.
It may apply to an object, such as the
mangal sutra, a necklace worn by mar-
ried women primarily in southern India
as a sign that they are married and that
their husbands are still living.
Mangal Sutra
(“auspicious thread”) Symbol worn by
married women primarily in southern
India indicating their married status.
Married women are considered to be
inherently auspicious, since their
potential generative power can be
expressed through socially sanctioned
procreation. Accounts from several cen-
turies ago describe this symbol as a sim-
ple thread, often colored yellow with
turmeric; in contemporary times the
mangal sutra is often an elaborate neck-
lace. Wearing a mangal sutra indicates
that a woman has a living husband, thus
she is a vessel of auspicious qualities.
For these reasons, a woman must
remove her mangal sutra upon being
widowed, as she must remove all the
other symbols of marriage.
Manikarnika
(“Jeweled earring”) Sacred site (tirtha)
in the city of Benares on the Ganges
River in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The site takes its name from the
Manikarnika Kund, a bathing (snana)
tank supposedly dug by the god Vishnu,
and into which fell an earring of the god
Shiva, thus sanctifying the tank by its
presence. In modern times the site is
better known for the cremation ground
at Manikarnika Ghat. In most Indian
cities the cremation ground lies at the
margin of the settlement, since its asso-
ciation with death makes it an inauspi-
cious place. However, the Manikarnika
cremation ground is in the center of
Benares. Despite the normal human
[[419]]
Manikkavachakar
desire to ignore and to deny the reality
of death, in Benares it is paraded in
full view—not to distress or depress
people, but to make them confront this
reality. Awareness of death has tradition-
ally been considered a great spur to
religious life. Since Benares is also one
of the Seven Sacred Cities, death
within the city also carries the hope of
ultimate liberation.
Manikkavachakar
(9th c.) Tamil poet-saint who was a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Shiva and
the author of the Tiruvachakam (“holy
utterances”). He is considered the fourth
great figure in the Tamil Shaivite tradi-
tion, along with the Nayanar poet-
saints, Appar, Sambandar, and
Sundaramurtti.
Manikkavachakar’s
hymns bear witness to the intensity of
his individual religious experience and
are seen as the culmination of the earlier
devotional (bhakti) tradition. These
hymns are also the basis for the devel-
opment of the Shaiva Siddhanta philo-
sophical school, making him a pivotal
figure in southern Indian Shaivism. For
further information see Glenn Yocum,
Hymns to the Dancing Siva, 1982.
Manimegalai
Tamil epic poem which was written as a
sequel to “The Jeweled Anklet”
(Shilappadigaram), connecting its
characters with those of the earlier play.
The story focuses on a young woman
named Manimegalai who, although
wooed by the local prince, becomes a
Buddhist nun. Manimegalai has numer-
ous debates with people from compet-
ing religious traditions, thus giving a
picture of sixth century southern Indian
religious life.
Manipura Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, the manipura chakra is
one of the six psychic centers (chakras)
believed to exist in the subtle body. The
[[420]]

subtle body is an alternate physiological
system, existing on a different plane of
reality than gross matter, but corre-
sponding to the material body. The six
psychic centers are visualized as multi-
petaled lotus flowers running roughly
along the spine, connected by three ver-
tical channels. Each of the chakras has
symbolic associations with various
human capacities, different subtle ele-
ments (tanmatras), and different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from the
letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, encom-
passing all sacred sound. Above and
below these centers are the bodily
abodes of Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power), the two divine principles
through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind the concept of the
subtle body is the homology of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mysti-
cal texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated starting from the bottom; the
manipura chakra is the third. It is visual-
ized as a ten-petaled lotus, located in
the region of the navel. The petals each
contain a seed, in this case the conso-
nants from retroflex “dha” to “pha.” The
manipura chakra is identified as the
bodily seat for the subtle element of fire,
the power of which is believed to bring
about digestion. For further information
see Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Manipuri
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathak, and Kathakali. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dance shows strong regional identifica-
tion; Manipuri is found only in the state
of Manipur, nestled between Burma and
Assam in eastern India. Developed in
the eighteenth century, Manipuri
reflects the importance of Vaishnava
devotionalism. One of the principalMan-Lion Avatar
dance genres involves acting out
episodes from the life of the god
Krishna, especially the Ras lila and his
dalliance with his lover Radha. In other
genres dancers play a two-headed drum
or cymbals, leaping dramatically during
the performance. This form has roots in
devotional Vaishnavism, particularly the
ecstatic singing and dancing associated
with the Gaudiya Vaishnava community
in Bengal. For further information see
Mohan Khokar, Traditions of Indian
Classical Dance, 1984.
Man Lila
A divine play (lila) between Krishna and
his devotees (bhakta). In this lila, one of
Krishna’s female companions feigns
wounded pride (man), usually because
he makes some sort of error, such as
calling her by another woman’s name.
For some time she pretends to be angry,
but is eventually won over by his charm
and undivided attention. This motif
of a woman feigning anger—to make
her lover flatter and fawn over her,
and to sweeten the joy of the eventual
reconciliation—has a venerable history
in Sanskrit poetry. In modern times,
this lila is often presented in devotional
theatrical presentations, which are
themselves known as lilas (“plays”),
since their function is to reveal the work
of the divine.
Man-Lion Avatar
Fourth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu; the man-lion’s form is usually
rendered as the head and shoulders of a
lion, and the torso and legs of a man. As
with all the avatars of Vishnu, the Man-
Lion avatar comes to restore the cosmic
balance, which has been thrown out of
equilibrium by the disproportionate
power of some individual. In this case
the source of trouble is the demon-king
Hiranyakashipu, who by the power of
his asceticism (tapas) has gained three
boons from the gods: that he cannot be
killed by man nor beast, by day or by
night, and neither inside nor outdoors.
Portrait of the god Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar.
Vishnu takes this form to defeat a demon who
has conquered heaven and earth.
These boons render him virtually
invulnerable; Hiranyakashipu proceeds
to conquer the earth and drive the
gods from heaven. He oppresses his
son Prahlada, who despite his
father’s power remains a sincere devotee
(bhakta) of Vishnu. The more devotion
Prahlada shows to Vishnu the more
abuse his father gives him, until
finally Hiranyakashipu, maddened at
the thought that someone refuses
to worship him, is at the point of
killing Prahlada.
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,
and the Man-Lion, a being which is nei-
ther man nor beast, bursts forth from a
pillar in the palace. The Man-Lion seizes
Hiranyakashipu in the palace doorway,
which is neither inside nor out, at twi-
light, which is neither day nor night, and
uses his sharp claws to tear out the
demon’s entrails, killing him. Once
Hiranyakashipu has been killed, Vishnu
installs the righteous Prahlada as the
king of the realm. This action reveals an
important truth about the Hindu view of
reality. Although Prahlada is a “demon”
(asura), he is not inherently evil, nor is
he simply a being to be exterminated.
All kinds of beings have their rightful
place in the Hindu cosmos—problems
[[421]]
Manmatha
come when they gain disproportionate
power and use it to their own ends.
Manmatha
(“churning the mind”) Epithet of the
Krishna, reflecting his ability to
bewitch and beguile his devotees
(bhakta). See Krishna.
Mansa Devi
Presiding deity in the village of
Manimajara, located in the Shiwalik
Hills, a short distance from Chandigarh,
and one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
According to local tradition, this is one
of the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Mansa Devi was Sati’s
head. The word mansa means “wish,”
and it is claimed that Mansa Devi
will grant whatever wish the devotee
(bhakta) brings to her. There is another
temple of Mansa Devi on the hill above
the bathing (snana) ghats in the sacred
city of Haridwar; here, too, the officiants
claim that the presiding deity will fulfill
all one’s wishes.
The charter myth for the Manimajara
Mansa Devi, set in the time of the
Moghul emperor Akbar, illustrates her
power and concern for her devotees.
Akbar appoints a Rajput chieftain to
manage the land around Manimajara.
One year the chieftain is unable to pay
his taxes because bad weather has
ruined the crops. The chieftain is put in
prison, but his plight moves one of
Mansa Devi’s devotees, who implores
her to intervene in his behalf. The chief-
tain is released and the taxes waived;
when the chieftain discovers how this
has happened, he is so grateful that he
erects a temple in honor of the goddess.

Manthara
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Manthara is the
hunchbacked maid of King Dasharatha’s
wife, Kaikeyi. Manthara’s whisperings
against Dasharatha’s son Rama, the
god-king who is the epic’s protagonist,
slowly poisons Kaikeyi’s mind. She
succeeds in convincing the queen that
after Rama has been crowned
Dasharatha’s heir, she and her son
Bharata will be little better than
slaves, if they are allowed to live at all.
Goaded by Manthara, Kaikeyi decides
to demand two boons Dasharatha
gave her years before. With the first
boon she dictates that Rama be sent in
exile to the forest for fourteen years,
and with the second she stipulates
that her son Bharata be crowned heir
in Rama’s place.
The epic’s oldest version, the
Ramayana of Valmiki, paints Manthara
as a genuine villain. There is little
explanation for her actions, although
given the belief in karma, her physical
disabilities would have been seen as
revealing moral and spiritual deformity
as well. In the Ramayana, written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
Manthara’s behavior is ultimately attrib-
uted to the gods who send the goddess
Saraswati to confound Manthara’s mind,
setting in motion the chain of events
leading to the demon Ravana’s death. In
typical fashion, Tulsidas puts a more
charitable spin on the event, relating it
to Rama’s ultimate purpose for being
born on earth.
Mantra
In its most basic sense, sacred sound. A
mantra is a collection of phonemes that
may or may not have syntactic meaning
as actual words, since their importance
comes not from the meaning of the
utterances, but from the very sounds
themselves. Mantras are believed to
confer power and varying spiritual
capacities on those who have been given
the qualification (adhikara) to use
them. The qualification comes fromManu Smrti
being given the mantra by one’s teacher,
believed to transmit not only the sounds
of the mantra, but the power associated
with it. This living transmission is
considered an essential feature in “pos-
sessing” the mantra; for this reason
mantras learned in other contexts are
believed to be ineffective. The idea
of mantra as sacred sound is traced
back to the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts. One of the most common
mantras, the Gayatri mantra, is actually
a verse from the Rg Veda (3.62.10).
The use of mantras is emphasized in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra. For further informa-
tion
see
Arthur
Avalon

John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Mantraraja
(“king of mantras”) Name given to a
particular eight-syllable mantra asso-
ciated with the god Vishnu, in which
he is addressed as Narayana. The
mantra itself is “Om Namo Narayana”
(“Om, homage to Narayana”). This
mantra is particularly important in
the Shrivaishnava religious commu-
nity, which developed in southern
India in the twelfth century. The
mantra is especially associated with
the community’s founder, Ramanuja.
Faithful recitation of this mantra is
said to bestow residence in Vishnu’s
heavenly abode, Vaikuntha.
Mantrashastra
The name for the body of learning that
focuses on mantras or sacred formulae:
their classification, meaning, and use.
Some of this learning exists in textual
form, but given the secret nature of the
subject matter, and the traditional insis-
tence on oral, personal transmission
from a religious teacher, much exists
only in oral form.
Manu
In Hindu mythology, the Manus are
fourteen semidivine kings, perceived as
the progenitors of the human race and
rulers over the universe. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years; the active phase is known as the
Day of Brahma; the quiet phase is
known as the Night of Brahma. In one
instance of cosmic time, each Day of
Brahma is divided into fourteen equal
periods, each ruled by one of the four-
teen Manus.
Manu Smrti
(“Laws of Manu”) One of the smrtis or
“remembered” texts, a class of literature
deemed important, but less authorita-
tive than the shrutis or “heard” texts.
This smrti is ascribed to the sage Manu
and is an example of one of the Dharma
Shastras—manuals prescribing rules for
correct human behavior and ideal social
life. The Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, reinforcing the
authority of these texts. Manu’s text is by
far the most influential of the Dharma
Shastras and is believed to have been
composed just before the beginning of
the common era.
Manu’s text shows the break between
the Dharma Sutras and the Dharma
Shastras, for it is plainly intended as a
blueprint for an entire society, rather
than a set of rules for a particular brah-
min group. The introductory chapter
details the creation of the world and the
consequent social order; the chapter
ends by summarizing the rest of the vol-
ume’s contents. The next five chapters
focus on the four major social groups
(varnas) and the four stages of life
(ashramas), using material from the
Dharma Sutras.
Manu’s themes in chapters seven
through nine sharply diverge from earli-
er sources. Chapter seven defines the
duties of a king. Chapters eight and nine
[[423]]
Manvantara
treat various legal matters that might
come before the king for adjudication.
Manu attempts to put all of these under
eighteen thematic headings. The mater-
ial in these chapters encompasses
all manner of criminal and civil law,
from assault and theft to contract
law and marital duties laying down
a legal framework for the stable
governance of society.
The remaining chapters are less orig-
inal. The tenth chapter discusses occu-
pations that members of the different
varnas may follow in times of distress
(apaddharma), when normal social
rules no longer apply. The eleventh
talks about gifts to brahmins and rites
of expiation (prayashchitta), remaining
faithful to the Dharma Sutras. Manu’s
final chapter has a more abstract and
speculative nature, focusing on the
workings of karma and describing the
consequences of various good and evil
acts. The text has been translated
numerous times; see Wendy Doniger
O’Flaherty and Brian K. Smith, The Laws
of Manu, 1991.
Manvantara
Manvantara is the name of an era in one
instance of cosmic time. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years; the active phase is known as
the Day of Brahma and the quiet phase
is known as the Night of Brahma. In
one instance of cosmic time, each
Day of Brahma is divided into fourteen
equal periods, each ruled by one of
the fourteen Manus. Manus are cele-
brated as the sovereigns of the earth
and are perceived as semidivine beings
who are the progenitors of the human
race. Currently we are living in the
seventh age, with seven yet to come.
The Manu of this present age,
Vaivasvata, was saved from pralaya
(universal destruction) by Vishnu in his
form as the Fish avatar. Vaivasvata is
[[424]]

regarded as the progenitor of the Solar
Line of Kings.
Maranashaucha
The ritual impurity (ashaucha) caused
by death (marana). All bodily effluvia
(hair, spittle, pus, blood, etc.) are con-
sidered to be sources of impurity, but a
corpse is the most impure thing of all.
Any death immediately causes the most
violent impurity, affecting the entire
family. For the family’s safety, this impu-
rity must be carefully contained and
managed through the funeral rites
(antyeshthi samskara). Here one sees
the significant ritual difference between
birth and death. Although birth also
brings impurity (sutakashaucha) on the
family, because of the bodily products
attending it, this impurity is considered
less violent, because the birth of a child
is an auspicious, life-affirming event.
Death, on the other hand, is seen as
bringing bad fortune, and thus the fam-
ily must not only take care of this impu-
rity, but must also get rid of the
inauspiciousness caused by the death.
Maratha
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis. Jatis were
organized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation, over which each group held a
monopoly. The Maratha jati was one of
the dominant landholding communities
in the Maharashtra region, along with
the Kunbis. They were most concentrated
on the Konkan coast and the inland
region around the city of Pune. The
Marathas were tough peasant farmers
who by the middle of the eighteenth
century had forged a large but short-
lived empire, the Maratha confederacy,
extending over much of northern and
central India. By the latter part of the
eighteenth century, the confederacy had
fragmented into various smaller states.Maricha
Maratha Dynasty
(17th–19th c.) Central Indian dynasty in
the region of the western state of
Maharashtra, particularly along the
Konkan coast of the Arabian Sea. The
dynasty was founded by the Maratha
chieftain Shivaji, who spent most of his
life locked in a bitter struggle with the
Moghul empire. At Shivaji’s death in
[[1680]]
, the Marathas controlled only a
small strip of land in western
Maharashtra. After the death of the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb in 1707,
the Moghul empire began to disinte-
grate; the Marathas filled the political
vacuum. At its peak in the mid-1700s,
the Maratha Confederacy controlled
northern and central India from coast to
coast, stretching as far north as Delhi
and
the
Ganges
River
basin.
Expansionism was halted in 1761, when
the Maratha army was defeated by the
Afghans at Panipat in the state of
Haryana, a short distance north of
Delhi. Both groups of combatants sus-
tained major losses in the battle, render-
ing them unable to contest the arrival of
the British. A little more than a decade
later, the Maratha Confederacy had frag-
mented into constituent states, each
with its own capital. Of these, the
Bhonsle dynasty had its capital in the
city of Nagpur, the Holkar dynasty had
its capital in the city of Indore, the
Gaikwad dynasty had its capital in the
city of Baroda. The Scindia dynasty had
capitals in Gwalior and Ujjain, while the
Peshwa dynasty had its capital in Pune.
All except for the last survived as princely
states until Indian independence in
[[1947]]
. See also Moghul dynasty.
Margali
Ninth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Dhanush (the zodiacal
sign of Sagittarius), usually falling with-
in December and January. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Margashirsha
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Margashirsha is the ninth
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within November and December.
Margashirsha is generally considered an
inauspicious month; the only major fes-
tivals in Margashirsha are Bhairava
Jayanti, Utpanna Ekadashi, and
Mokshada Ekadashi.
Maricha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Maricha is the uncle
of Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka
who is the epic’s antagonist. After
Ravana’s sister Shurpanakha has been
insulted and mutilated by Rama and
Lakshmana, the epic’s protagonists,
Ravana decides to take revenge by
abducting Rama’s wife, Sita. He enlists
Maricha’s help to kidnap Sita. Maricha
takes the form of a golden deer. When
Sita sees the deer, she asks Rama to kill it
for her. Rama pursues the deer into the
forest, giving Lakshmana strict instruc-
tions to stay with Sita no matter what
happens. Rama pursues the deer some
distance from their home and finally
gets close enough to shoot it.
With his dying breath, Maricha cries
out Lakshmana’s name in a voice that
sounds like Rama’s, intending to draw
Lakshmana away and leave Sita unpro-
tected. Given his orders, Lakshmana is
at first unwilling to leave. He finally
leaves when Sita, in an uncharacteristic
display of suspicion and anger, accuses
Lakshmana of withholding help to
Rama because he wants to have her to
himself. At this unjust allegation,
Lakshmana is spurred into action.
Before he leaves he draws a magical
[[425]]
Marichi
protective circle around Sita, instructing
her that no harm can befall her as long
as she stays in the circle. Ravana, in the
form of an old ascetic, approaches Sita,
begging for alms. Out of respect for an
ascetic, Sita steps out of the circle to
offer the alms. Ravana reveals his true
form and carries her away.
Marichi
In Hindu mythology, one of the six
sons of Brahma, all of whom become
great sages. All are “mind-born,” mean-
ing that Brahma’s thoughts are enough
to bring them into being. The others
are Kratu, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha,
and Atri.
Mariyammai
Originally a local goddess in southern
India, whose cult has become a regional
phenomenon. Mariyammai embodies
many of the contradictions and tensions
associated with Hindu conceptions of
the Goddess in general. According to her
charter myth, Mariyammai is originally
a brahmin woman, who is beheaded
because of her husband’s jealousy. She is
brought back to life, but not before her
body has become switched with that of
another woman, this one an untouch-
able. Mariyammai’s brahmin head and
untouchable body symbolize the imper-
fect joining of brahminical Hindu and
southern Indian culture, as well as the
nebulous status of brahmins as the
“head” of southern Indian society.
Markandeya
A sage in Hindu mythology. Markandeya
is best-known for two mythic exploits,
one of which is associated with the god
Shiva and the other with the god
Vishnu. According to tradition,
Markandeya is a very intelligent and
religious boy who is devoted to Shiva
and proficient in all the branches of
learning. This seemingly unlimited
potential is even more poignant because
he learns that he is fated to die at
sixteen. Shortly before his sixteenth
[[426]]

birthday, Markandeya begins to wor-
ship Shiva with even greater fervor.
Because of the boy’s accumulated reli-
gious merits, the servants of Yama, the
god of death, cannot get near him. So
Yama himself has to go for Markandeya.
When Yama throws his noose over
Markandeya to draw out the boy’s soul,
it also loops over the statue of Shiva to
which Markandeya is clinging. Shiva
arises from the image and kills Yama,
although he later relents and brings him
back to life.
Markandeya’s other mythic exploit is
a vision of pralaya, the universal disso-
lution of the cosmos. One evening as he
is meditating, the sky grows dark, the
wind rises, and rain falls until the earth
is inundated with water. Markandeya is
swept this way and that, until he comes
to an enormous banyan tree with an
infant sitting in it. Markandeya is drawn
to the child and sees that the entire uni-
verse is inside this infant boy. He wan-
ders inside the child for some time until
he falls out of the child’s mouth; then he
sees the infant and the banyan tree
again. Markandeya realizes that the
infant is Vishnu, but before he can reach
him again, the child has disappeared.
Markandeya Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
the sectarian compendia of mythic
stories and sacred lore that are among
the most important sources for modern
Hinduism. Markandeya is said to have
been an ancient sage, but he was not
intimately connected with any particu-
lar deity. In this respect, the
Markandeya Purana is different from
most of the others, which have a clear
sectarian bias. This purana is noted
for one of its subsections, the
Devimahatmya. Describing the ulti-
mate power behind all things as female,
the Devimahatmya is the earliest
and most important textual source
for the mythology of the Goddess.
Scholars contend that although
this text is the first place that this
theological conviction appears, it mustMarriage Ceremonies
have existed earlier, since it appears in
this text fully developed.
Marriage, Eight Classical Forms
Dharma literature (texts prescribing
rules for correct human behavior and
ideal social life) recognizes eight forms
of marriage: Brahma, Daiva, Arsha,
Prajapatya,
Asura,
Gandharva,
Rakshasa, and Paishacha. The first four
forms were approved (prashasta). In
each case, the father of the bride was
responsible for arranging the marriage:
in the Brahma form, he gave his daugh-
ter as a gift without conditions; in the
Daiva form, she was given as a sacrificial
fee; in the Arsha form, in exchange for a
pair of cattle for sacrifice; and in the
Prajapatya form, with the condition that
the husband and wife perform their
duties together.
The other four forms were consid-
ered reprehensible forms of marriage
(aprashasta). Two of these four were
tolerated: the Asura form, in which
the bride was exchanged for money,
and the Gandharva form, in which bride
and groom plighted their troth by
mutual consent—that is, through con-
sensual sexual intercourse. The final
two forms were strictly forbidden:
Rakshasa, in which the bride was
forcibly abducted; and Paishacha, in
which a man took sexual advantage of a
woman who was insentient—the result
of drunkenness, a deep sleep, or drug-
ging. It is interesting to note that all of
these forms were deemed to create a
valid marriage—even the two that were
forbidden. The aim in sanctioning
such forbidden marriages was not to
encourage such actions, but to give
the woman the legal status of a wife.
In contemporary times most of these
forms of marriage are no longer
practiced except for the Brahma
marriage, which carries the highest
status, and the Asura marriage. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. Despite
In many traditional Hindu marriage ceremonies,
the groom’s turban is attached to the bride’s sari,
binding the couple together.
their age, they remain the best sources for
traditional Hindu religious rites.
Marriage Ceremonies
In India, virtually everybody gets mar-
ried. Marriage is a religious duty for
twice-born men, satisfying one of their
Three Debts, in this case the debt to
their ancestors. Twice-born men are
householders born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society,
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya. Such
men are eligible to receive the adoles-
cent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” For most Hindu women,
being wives and mothers defines their
identity. Marriage is also the event by
which families are formed and grow.
Since the family is considered the
bedrock of Hindu society, for most peo-
ple, marriage is the single most impor-
tant event in their lives.
The great significance of marriage
in Hindu culture means that this
life-changing event is attended with
potential peril because there is no
certainty of success. Other potential
dangers come from the inauspicious
nature of certain times, people, and
the belief that this inauspiciousness
may bring bad fortune for the future.
Finally, given that the bride and groom
are the center of attention in the days
before the marriage, there is the danger
[[427]]
Marriage Ceremonies
that other people’s ill will and envy may
unleash malevolent and unseen forces. As
with many of the other life transitions,
Hindu marriages are attended with con-
siderable attention to discerning the
unseen forces that could have a negative
affect on the couple’s future life and pro-
tecting the bride and groom from them.
The wedding is always performed at an
astrologically auspicious time, to start the
marriage on the best possible note. In the
days before the wedding, the bride is often
secluded, keeping her from coming in
contact with people or things deemed
inauspicious. On their wedding day both
the bride and groom are anointed and
adorned similar to the deities in a tem-
ple—according to popular belief, on their
wedding day, the couple become Lakshmi
and Vishnu, god and goddess. This
heightened status puts them in ritual dan-
ger when they are outside in the world,
both from the legion of sources for ritual
impurity (ashaucha), and because they
are believed to be more susceptible to the
evil eye (nazar) and other forms of witch-
craft. These dangers are countered by
amulets and various rites of protection
when the bride or groom must be in the
public eye, such as when the groom and
his group of friends travel in triumphal
procession to the wedding hall, as is com-
mon in northern India. Once inside, the
danger is less pressing, since they are in a
closed and ritually structured environ-
ment, surrounded by family and friends.
There is no single Hindu marriage
ceremony, as is clear from the eight clas-
sical forms of marriage recognized in
the dharma literature. Of these eight,
the two forms generally practiced today
are the Asura form, in which the groom’s
family gives money as a brideprice to
obtain the bride; and the Brahma form,
in which the bride’s family gives their
daughter to the groom, without making
any conditions on him at all (although
in contemporary times the groom’s
family can usually expect a dowry
with the bride). The Brahma marriage
carries much higher social status and
is the most popular form. Although in
such a marriage the wedding cere-
[[428]]

monies have regional and sectarian
variation, certain common rites reveal
important cultural assumptions.
The two major themes in a Hindu mar-
riage are the transfer of the bride from her
family to her husband’s family, and the
indissoluble merging of bride and groom
into a new entity, the married couple. The
transfer of the bride is done in the
kanyadan ritual, the “gift of the virgin”
performed by the bride’s father. The bride
and groom’s marital union is symbolized
by several common rites, including pani-
grahana, in which the groom takes the
bride’s hand as a sign of their union.
Another such rite, considered the defining
point of the marriage, is the saptapadi, the
“seven steps” which the bride and groom
take together. The seventh step completes
the bride’s transfer to the groom’s family; it
is at this point that the marriage becomes
indissoluble. In modern times the sapta-
padi is often performed in conjunction
with another ceremony, the agnipradak-
shinam (“circumambulating the fire”).
Instead of taking seven steps, the bride
and groom make seven revolutions
around a small fire. On one hand, the pres-
ence of fire shows that marriage is a yajna
or Vedic sacrifice. On the other, since the
fire is considered to be the Vedic god Agni,
he becomes the divine witness to the mar-
riage. During the circumambulations the
bride and groom are often physically
joined by tying part of his turban to the
edge of her sari. This visible bond between
them is yet another sign of the inner union
that has just been formed.
As described, in marriage the wife’s
identity is “assimilated” to her hus-
band’s, rather than some sort of mutual
transformation. In northern India, the
bride lives with her husband’s family
after the marriage; her new identity
stems solely from her relationship
with her husband, whereas his iden-
tity remains essentially unchanged,
although augmented by marriage. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.

Hierarchy, 1975. See also marriage,

Marriage Prohibitions
As in other cultures, Hindus have well-
defined rules and prohibitions regard-
ing whom one should and should not
marry—marriages should be endoga-
mous, that is, between members of the
same social subgroup (in this case, the
jati). Within this larger community, it is
generally accepted that the bride and
groom should not come from the same
gotra or the same pravara—both mythic
lineages detailing relationships with
ancient sages. The other strong prohibi-
tion was on marrying those with whom
one had a sapinda relationship—com-
mon ancestry. According to one well-
known code of law, the Mitakshara , the
sapinda relationship ceases after the
seventh generation on the father’s
side, and the fifth generation on the
mother’s. People with common
ancestors beyond those boundaries may
contract a valid marriage.
This sapinda formula was routinely
ignored, particularly in parts of
southern India, where marrying one’s
maternal uncle’s daughter was not
only permitted, but considered com-
mendable. While some of the texts in
the dharma literature condemn the
practice as an abomination, others
note that this is a practice peculiar to
the south, where it is permitted only
as part of the family’s customary
practice (kulachara).
There is a long history for cross-
cousin marriage in southern India; it is a
common practice even today. Among
southern Indian brahmins, there is
some speculation that their relatively
small population—about four percent
of the total—made it impossible to find
brahmin spouses under the strict crite-
ria. Given the competing imperatives to
marry other brahmins and to observe
the lineage restrictions, this custom was
deemed less important.
The village of Martand is known for its ruins of an
eighth-century temple built to the sun god.
Mars
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with activity, war, and mis-
fortune. Due to these associations, Mars
is considered a strong yet malignant
planetary force. Tuesday, the day of the
week ruled by Mars, is considered an
inauspicious day, a day on which people
often perform rites of protection to
safeguard themselves from Mars’s bale-
ful influence.
Marshall, Sir John
Director General of the Archeological
Survey of India (ASI) from 1901 until
his retirement in 1931. During his tenure
as director, Marshall discovered then
excavated the cities of the Indus Valley
civilization, for which he received
his British knighthood. He also carried
on the work of his predecessors at
the ASI, particularly Sir Alexander
Cunningham, documenting and cata-
loging India’s archeological artifacts.
Martand
Village in the state of Jammu and
Kashmir about forty miles southeast of
Shrinagar, the capital. Martand is noted
as an architectural history site, best
[[429]]
Marut
known for its temple to the sun god,
built during the eighth century. The
temple ruins are in a mountain meadow,
offering spectacular views of the sur-
rounding mountains.
Marut
Class of minor deities considered to be
the companions of Indra, god of the
storm. The Maruts are described as hav-
ing a flashing color, armed with golden
weapons symbolic of lightning, and
roaring like lions.
Marwari
Northern Indian trading community
named after its place of origin, the
Marwar region surrounding Jodhpur in
Rajasthan. The Marwaris have spread
all over northern India; many of them
have become extremely wealthy. The
Marwaris are stereotyped as ruthless
and cutthroat in their business prac-
tices, yet at the same time, they are
munificent in donations to religious
causes, reflecting traditional religious
piety. The most successful Marwari fam-
ilies, such as the Birlas, still control large
parts of the Indian economy. Marwari
support and patronage is an important
consideration for all northern Indian
political parties.
Masi
Eleventh month in the Tamil year, cor-
responding to the northern Indian
month of Kumbha (the zodiacal sign
of Aquarius), usually falling within
February and March. The existence of
several different calendars is a sign of
the continuing importance of regional
cultural patterns. One way that the
Tamils retain their culture is by preserv-
ing their traditional calendar. Tamil
is one of the few regional languages
in India with an ancient, well-
established literary tradition. See also
Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
[[430]]

Materialist
The name for a philosophical school
espousing the belief that the individ-
ual and the physical body are identi-
cal. The body is composed of certain
physical elements, so with the death
of the body, the individual ceases to
exist. Since the materialists believed
there is no life after death, they also
believed there is no reason to engage
in religious activities in the hope of a
better afterlife. The materialist
believes that one should live well,
enjoy life to the fullest, and then die.
This viewpoint was first espoused by
Ajita Keshakambalin, who was a con-
temporary of the Buddha. Its later
adherents were called both Lokayata
(“worldly”) and Charvaka (after the
supposed founder). The materialists
were universally reviled by the other
philosophical schools, all of whom
considered their rejection of religious
life dangerous. One of their philo-
sophical theories, and a sign of their
rootedness in concrete experience,
was their position on the pramanas,
the means by which human beings
can gain true and accurate knowledge.
Most schools admitted at least three
such pramanas—perception (prat-
yaksha), inference (anumana), and
authoritative testimony (shabda). In
contrast, the materialists accepted
only perception, denying the validity
of the other two. Emphasis is placed
on experience and the belief that
what is directly before one’s eyes is
indisputable.
Math
(often translated as “monastery”) A
dwelling place for ascetics; usually a
large, well-settled dwelling for a number
of ascetics belonging to an established
order. The four most famous maths are
believed to have been established by the
philosopher Shankaracharya: the Jyotir
Math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath; the Govardhan Math in the
city of Puri, on the Bay of Bengal; theMatsya
Sharada Math in the city of Dwaraka
on the Arabian Sea; and the Shringeri
Math in the town of Shringeri in
southern India. These maths are the
headquarters for the four major
groups in the Dashanami sect
Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
Although most maths do not have the
status of these four, they all serve as
ascetic and religious centers.
Mathura
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Braj region of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, about ninety miles south of
Delhi. Mathura is known as the town
in which the god Krishna was born.
The Krishna Janam Bhumi, purport-
edly the site of his birth, can still be
seen today. Krishna was spirited out of
Mathura on that same night because
his wicked uncle Kamsa, who was
king of Mathura, had killed all of
Krishna’s older siblings at birth. When
Krishna came of age he returned to
Mathura, killed Kansa, and claimed
his patrimony. As with sites in the
Braj region, Mathura is full of associa-
tions with Krishna’s earthly life; these
allow his devotees (bhakta) access to
him, in that they can visualize the
places he visited, and thus through
imagination take part in his mythic
deeds themselves.
Mathurakavi
(10th c.) The last of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
emphasis on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage, transformed and revitalized
Hindu religious life. According to tradi-
tion, Mathurakavi was the disciple of
Nammalvar, to whom he was led from
northern India by a great light in the
southern sky. By asking a question about
the supreme spirit, Mathurakavi was
able to rouse Nammalvar from a yogic
trance in which the latter had spent
much of his life. From that point
Mathurakavi served Nammalvar as his
guru. Whereas the other Alvars were
quite prolific, Mathurakavi wrote only
ten songs, all in praise of his master. For
further information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975; John Stirling
Morley Hooper, Hymns of the Alvars,
[[1929]]
; and A. K. Ramanujan (trans.),
Hymns for the Drowning, 1981.
Matrilinear Succession
(Marumakkatayam) Most of Hindu
society is overwhelmingly patrilineal
(organized around the father’s familial
line). However, the Nayars of the state
of Kerala in southern India base soci-
ety on matrilineal succession (the
mother’s familial line). Matrilineal suc-
cession was practiced from very early
times, although it had largely disap-
peared by the middle of the twentieth
century. Under a matrilineal system,
both descent and inheritance are
passed on through the mother’s line,
which is center of the family. The
woman’s husband lives in her family
home, but has no claim upon their
children, and no claim on any of their
marital property. A man has a certain
amount of control over his own fami-
ly’s ancestral property—which he is
often called to manage—but the prop-
erty ultimately is inherited by his sis-
ter’s children, rather than his own. In
many cases the woman’s “official” hus-
band never actually consummates the
marriage, and the woman is free to
form long-term liaisons with other
men, according to her choice.
Matsya
(“fish”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, fish is
the second of the “Five Forbidden
Things” (panchamakara), which, in
“left hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
are used in their actual forms, but are
[[431]]
Matsya Avatar
represented by symbolic substitutes in
“right hand” (dakshinachara) tantric
ritual. “Respectable” Hindu society
strongly condemns the consumption of
nonvegetarian food, so this ritual use
must be seen in the larger tantric
context. One of the underlying tantric
assumptions is the ultimate unity of
everything that exists. From a tantric
perspective, to affirm that the entire
universe is one principle means that the
adept must reject all concepts based on
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden
Things” provide a ritual means for
breaking down duality. In this ritual the
adept breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a con-
scious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara), and
is thus superior to common practice. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Matsya Avatar
The first of the ten avatars or incarna-
tions of the god Vishnu, which all took
place at moments of crisis in the cos-
mos. See Fish avatar.
Matsyagandhi
(“[she whose] smell is fish”) In Hindu
mythology, another name for queen
Satyavati. Matsyagandhi is a fisher-girl
who stinks of fish. She attracts the eye of
a powerful sage, who later uses his
magic powers to give her a pleasant
scent. See Satyavati.
Matsyendranath
According to tradition, the guru of the
sage Gorakhnath and the founder of the
Nathpanthis, a group of renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
[[432]]

the god Shiva. He is also known as
Minanath. According to the Nathpanthi
tradition, Matsyendranath received his
teaching from Shiva himself, by taking
the form of a fish (in Sanskrit, the words
matsya and mina both mean “fish”), and
eavesdropping while Shiva was teaching
his wife Parvati. For further information
about Gorakhnath and the Nath tradi-
tion, see George Weston Briggs,
Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis,
[[1973]]
. See also tantra.
Matter, Primeval
The general translation given to the
Sanskrit word prakrti, one of the two
first principles in the Samkhya philo-
sophical school. See prakrti.
Mauni
Derived from the word muni (“sage”),
mauni designates a person who is
observing a vow of silence as a religious
act. Just as members of certain Christian
monastic orders observe a vow of
silence to turn their thoughts inward
and enrich their inner lives, in the same
way Hindu ascetics have taken vows of
silence as a tool for spiritual develop-
ment. At times these vows may be for a
finite period of time (a week, a month,
and so on), but even now there are
ascetics who have not spoken in
decades, communicating through
expression, gesture, and writing on a
piece of paper or a slate.
Mauni Amavasya
This festival falls on the day of the
new moon (amavasya) in the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February).
Those observing this holiday pass the
day in silence. The word mauni (speech-
less) is derived from the word muni
(sage); silence is seen as one of the reli-
gious practices helping to promote spir-
itual awareness. During the entire
month of Magh, bathing (snana) in the
Ganges (or another sacred river) is seen
as meritorious. Bathing on the day of
the new moon offers greater sanctity. AMaya Devi
well-known spot for this rite is at the city
of Allahabad, at the confluence of the
Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers.
Mauritius
Island nation in the Indian Ocean, 1,200
miles east of the African coast. Mauritius
has a significant Hindu diaspora popu-
lation. As in many other cases, Indians
were first brought to Mauritius as inden-
tured agricultural laborers, in this case
as workers on the sugar plantations.
Currently, they comprise nearly 75 per-
cent of the island’s population, running
the nation’s political system. The Hindus
on Mauritius have transferred India’s
sacred geography to their new land: A
southern lake named Grand Bassin is
claimed to have an underground con-
nection to the River Ganges, and the
lake has become a significant pilgrim-
age site.
Maurya Dynasty
The earliest of the great Indian empires.
At its zenith, the Maurya dynasty ruled
over most of the Indian subcontinent,
except in the deep south. The dynasty
was founded by Chandragupta Maurya
in the fourth century B.C.E., but reached
its peak under his grandson Ashoka,
who reigned from 269–232 B.C.E. The
kingdom was centered in the lower
Ganges basin, with its capital at
Pataliputra, near the modern city of
Patna in the state of Bihar. The Mauryan
empire is the first historically docu-
mented centralized Indian empire; it
was operated and maintained by a large
governmental bureaucracy. Despite its
size and organization, the empire was
short-lived. It began to disintegrate on
Ashoka’s death; fifty years later it had
virtually disappeared.
Maya
A Sanskrit word. Maya’s literal meaning
is “magic” or “illusion”; the connotation
it carries is a magic show or illusion in
which objects appear to be present, but
are not. In the Hindu philosophical
tradition, maya describes how human
beings become confused about the true
nature of the world and themselves.
Such illusion keeps them enmeshed in
bondage to their desires and continues
the cycle of reincarnation (samsara)
that comes from this; at the same time,
however, such people are unaware that
they are in bondage.
In Hindu theism—in which the high-
est power is conceived as a deity—maya
is generally described as one of God’s
powers, through which the deity can
accomplish his or her purposes; in this
understanding, maya is seen as an exist-
ing entity. The analysis of maya is a little
different in the Advaita Vedanta school,
which propounds a position known as
monism. Monism claims that a single
Ultimate Reality, called the unqualified
Brahman, lies behind all things. Despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity, the only thing that really exists is
this formless, unqualified Brahman. For
the Advaitins, the assumption of diversity
is a fundamental misunderstanding of
the ultimate nature of things. The
Advaita school accepts that God wields
maya as a power, but since God (as a
being with particular qualities) is con-
sidered lower than the highest, ultimate
Brahman, both God and maya are part
this lower reality. Thus, both are ulti-
mately not real. The Advaitins describe
maya as confusion from the lack of
correct understanding; the confusion
disappears when perfect liberation has
been reached.
Maya Devi
Local goddess considered to be a form
of Durga, whose home is in the northern
Indian town and sacred city of
Haridwar. According to local tradition,
the site where her temple is built is one
of the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess which spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Maya Devi was Sati’s
[[433]]
Mayapur
navel. Although this claim is not attested
in other literature on the Shakti Pithas,
the site itself is believed to be very old.
One of the oldest names for the
Haridwar region is Mayapur, the “city of
Maya.” See also pitha.
Mayapur
City in West Bengal on the western side
of the Hugli River across from the holy
city of Navadvip, about sixty-five miles
north of Calcutta. Although both cities
claim to be the birthplace of the Bengali
saint Chaitanya, Navadvip’s claim is
older. However, the claim that Mayapur
was the birthplace of Chaitanya is sup-
ported by the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more
popularly known as the Hare Krishnas,
who have built a magnificent temple
complex at Mayapur as the headquar-
ters of the organization. For extensive
information about this site, see E. Alan
Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984.
Mayashiva
(“illusionary Shiva”) In Hindu mythology,
a demon named Jalandhara assumes
the form of the god Shiva in an attempt
to trick Parvati, the goddess, into having
sexual relations with him. Jalandhara
has been unable to conquer Shiva on the
battlefield, so he hopes that he can
diminish Shiva’s power by compromis-
ing the faithfulness of his wife.
Jalandhara comes to Parvati in Shiva’s
form, but she is so suspicious that
Jalandhara is unable to fulfill his desires.
Jalandhara’s power is eventually broken
in the same way, when Vishnu (in the
form of Jalandhara) manages to seduce
Jalandhara’s wife, Vrnda.
Meat Eating
An accepted part of the diet for most
Hindus. A 1996 poll of urban Hindus
found that only a quarter of the respon-
dents were vegetarians. However, this
figure may be higher in villages, where
people tend to be more traditional and
[[434]]

conservative. As the product of a dead
animal, meat is seen as impure, and
those who are concerned about reli-
gious purity (particularly brahmins)
will generally avoid it for that reason.
Even nonvegetarians recognize a hierar-
chy of animal foods. Some people will
eat only eggs; others will also eat chicken
and/or fish, whereas others will also eat
mutton. Pork is generally avoided by all
but the lowest-status people; pigs are
considered scavengers and deemed
unclean. Beef is taboo for religious
reasons, except for a very small Hindu
community in southern India. Even
those who eat meat generally do not eat
it in large quantities. Because of its
relatively high cost, it is generally
prepared as one dish among many,
rather than the central part of the meal.
Medhatithi
(mid-9th c.) Author of the most authori-
tative commentary on the Manu Smrti,
also known as the “Laws of Manu.”
Medhatithi was schooled in the tech-
niques of textual interpretation devel-
oped by the Purva Mimamsa school,
one of the six schools of Hindu philoso-
phy. Due to his interpretive abilities, his
commentary quickly became the
accepted standard.
Medicine
See ayurveda, Charaka Samhita, and
Sushruta Samhita.
Megasthenes
(3rd c. B.C.E.) Ambassador sent to the
court of Chandragupta Maurya by
Seleucus Nicator, a general in Alexander
the Great’s army who ruled the eastern
part of the empire after Alexander’s
death. Megasthenes lived for many
years in the Mauryan capital,
Pataliputra. His reports of life there are
the first European accounts of India. His
original account no longer exists, but
the fact of its existence is attested to
by the many references to it in the
works of later Greek writers; theseMela
writers, however, often voice doubts
about his credibility and veracity. See
also Maurya dynasty.
Meghaduta
(“Cloud-Messenger”) One of the great
poetic works by Kalidasa (5th c.?), gen-
erally considered to be the greatest clas-
sical Sanskrit poet. The Meghaduta is a
short poem consisting of one hundred
verses, written entirely in an extremely
long meter called mandakranta—sev-
enteen syllables to each quarter verse.
The poem tells the story of a yaksha
(nature sprite) who has been temporarily
banished to the southern part of India.
Separated from his beloved wife, who is
at their home in the kingdom of Kubera
in the Himalayas, the yaksha sees a
monsoon rain cloud moving northward
in its annual journey. He implores it to
carry a message of love to his beloved.
The yaksha describes the regions
through which the cloud travels. This
description gives a vivid picture of
everyday life and the cultural centers of
Kalidasa’s time. In some sources the
poem is called Meghasandesha, “The
Message [carried by] a Cloud.”
Meghanada
(“roaring like thunder”) In the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics, Meghanada is one of the
epithets of Indrajit, son of the demon-
king Ravana. See Indrajit.
Meher Baba
(b. Merwan Sheriar Irani, 1894–1969)
Modern religious figure who was born a
Parsi, but whose teachings draw on
Islamic mystical thought and Hindu
devotional (bhakti) teachings. Meher
Baba (“Divine Father”) claimed to be an
avatar or “incarnation” of the divine,
and his followers accept him as such. In
[[1925]]
 he took a vow of silence, which he
kept for the rest of his life, communicat-
ing through gestures and an alphabet
board. Despite his silence, he compiled
his teachings in a five-volume set of
Pilgrims in Allahabad gather in a
mela tent to listen to a guru.
discourses titled God Speaks. Like many
contemporary Hindu missionary fig-
ures, Meher Baba emphasized the need
for devotion to one’s guru or religious
preceptor, through which the disciple
would gain all things. For further infor-
mation from a devotee’s (bhakta) per-
spective, see Jean Adriel, Avatar, 1947.
Mehndipur
Village in the state of Rajasthan in the
southern region between the cities of
Agra and Jaipur. The village is best
known for the temple to the god Balaji,
considered to be a form of the monkey-
god Hanuman. People possessed by
malevolent spirits come to Balaji to be
cured through his power. For a thorough
discussion of the language of posses-
sion and exorcism, see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991
Mela
(“meeting”) In the widest sense, the
word mela can refer to any type of large
gathering, usually for some specific pur-
pose. In a religious context, the word
mela is generally translated as “festival”
or fair. Melas include commercial inter-
ests, religious activity, and entertain-
ment. Melas are usually attended by vast
numbers of religious pilgrims, traveling
to the site of the festival. By far the
largest of these melas is the Kumbha
[[435]]
Mena
Mela at Allahabad. In 1989, the Kumbha
Mela drew 15 million people on a single
day, and millions more during the
month of the festival.
Mena
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the
minor deity Himalaya, and the mother
of Parvati, the goddess. Mena christens
her daughter, Uma, through her excla-
mation “U Ma!” (“Oh, don’t!”) when
Parvati announces her desire to make
the god Shiva her husband. The Shiva
Purana details Mena’s initial discomfi-
ture with her unconventional son-in-
law, yet later suggests Shiva as the
paradigm for the ideal husband, since
he is completely devoted to his wife.
Menaka
In Hindu mythology, a beautiful celestial
maiden (apsara), who is a minion of
Indra, the king of the gods. Menaka’s
primary function is to seduce sages
threatening to replace Indra as the ruler
of heaven. In traditional Indian culture,
semen is seen as the concentrated
essence of a man’s vital energies; celibacy
is a means to conserve and retain these
energies. Menaka’s powers of attraction
are used to seduce these ascetics,
diminishing their accumulated spiritual
powers. Her most notable partner is the
sage Vishvamitra, who is twice smitten
by her charms. Their first liaison
results in the birth of the maiden
Shakuntala, celebrated in the drama
Abhijnanashakuntala, written by the
poet Kalidasa. During their second liai-
son, Vishvamitra lives with Menaka for
ten years, before leaving her for renun-
ciant life in the forest.
Menstruation
In traditional Hindu culture all bodily
discharges are considered to be a source
of ritual impurity (ashaucha). Women
are considered ritually unclean during
their menstrual periods; menstrual
fluid is considered a source of impurity.
However,
menstruation
is
also
[[436]]

considered a sign of auspiciousness or
good fortune, since it indicates women’s
reproductive capacities. The ritual
observances and taboos for menstruat-
ing women vary widely between differ-
ing social groups. In some groups,
women are subject to only a few restric-
tions, such as a ban on entering temples
during that time. In other groups,
women are expected to confine them-
selves to certain parts of the house and
to refrain from everyday activities such
as cooking. Although such strict practice
sounds oppressive, for many women
this interval was prized as a monthly
respite from their everyday duties,
which would be performed by the other
women in the household.
Mercury
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with mental quickness,
memory, and education, based on its
short orbit around the sun. Despite
these generally positive features,
Mercury is considered a weak planet,
easily influenced toward benevolence
and malevolence by other planets,
or by its position in the natal
horoscope (janampatrika). Mercury’s
association with the mind suggests that
the mind’s powers can be harnessed for
either good or evil ends. During the
week, Mercury is said to rule over
Wednesday; this day is not heavily
marked as auspicious or inauspicious,
reflecting the planet’s light powers.
Mercury
(2) Elemental mercury is a pivotal
substance in Indian alchemy. Hindu
alchemy analyzes the world as a series
of bipolar opposites in tension with
one another. Unifying these opposing
forces brings spiritual progress and
end of reincarnation (samsara). This
model of uniting or transcending
opposing forces is shared with Hindu
tantra, a secret, ritually-based religious
practice. This theme is shared with
hatha yoga, which is based on a seriesMewar
of physical exercises that are also
believed to affect the subtle body.
The governing metaphor for this
combination of opposites is the union of
sun and moon. Both the sun and the
moon are connected to other opposing
principles through an elaborate series of
associations. In keeping with this bipo-
lar symbolism, mercury is conceived as
the semen of the god Shiva and thus full
of healing power. It is also identified
with the moon (perhaps through its
bright silvery hue), with healing and
restorative power, and with the nectar of
immortality. Elemental sulfur is identi-
fied with the goddess Shakti’s uterine
blood. When mercury and sulfur are
mixed and consumed, the aspirant’s
body is purified and refined, eventually
rendering it immortal. Modern descrip-
tions of this practice warn that it should
only be carried out under the direction
of one’s guru (spiritual teacher); other-
wise these combinations will be harm-
ful, since by itself mercury is a deadly
poison. For further information see
Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta, Obscure
Religious Cults, 1962; and David Gordon
White, The Alchemical Body, 1996.
Meru
Mythical mountain in the center of the
continent of Jambudvipa, the inner-
most of the concentric landmasses that
make up the visible world in traditional
Hindu cosmology; Mount Meru is the
center of the entire world, the pivot of
the entire created order. It is said to
extend far up into the heavens and
have its roots far beneath the earth, and
on its crest is a divine city which is the
home of the gods. The mythical Meru is
often identified with the Himalayan
mountain known as Kailas. For this
reason Kailas has been an important
pilgrimage place (tirtha), despite its
inaccessible location.
Meter, Poetic
Indian poetry has well-developed metrical
forms, basically following two dominant
patterns. The first metric pattern is
based simply on the number of syllables
in a line. In the second pattern, each line
contains a certain number of metric
beats, based on the distinction between
“heavy” and “light” syllables. A heavy
syllable is any syllable with a long vowel
or a consonant cluster and is given two
metric beats; all other syllables are con-
sidered light and counted as one beat.
Sanskrit poetry tends to stress the
former pattern, and has codified meters
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables
per half-line, yet even within these syl-
labic constraints each meter usually has
a prescribed sequence of light and heavy
syllables as well. Two different Sanskrit
poetic meters may thus have the same
number of syllables, but vary in their
syllabic patterns. Although such subtle
differences could generate vast num-
bers of meters, in practice there were
only about a hundred. The vast majority
of Sanskrit texts are written in a single
meter, the anushtubh, which has eight
syllables per half-line.
Later devotional (bhakti) poetry,
particularly in northern India, tend to
favor poetic forms based on the number
of metric beats. The most popular forms
are the doha, which has twenty-four
metric beats in two lines, and the chau-
pai, which has four lines of sixteen beats
each. Although there are several poetic
forms based on the number of syllables
in each line, particularly the savaiya and
the kavitt, these were used less often.
Mewar
In the time before Indian independence
in 1947, Mewar was a princely state in
southern Rajasthan, the capital of
which was in the city of Udaipur. In
the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turies, Mewar was one of the important
centers for the Rajasthani style of
miniature painting. The Rajasthani
style is characterized by a flat perspec-
tive. Visual power is derived from vivid
bands of colors that often serve as a
backdrop to the painting.

Mimamsa Sutras
Minakshi
The east gate of the Minakshi Temple in the city of
Madurai. The temple is dedicated to the goddess
Minakshi, the city’s guardian.
Mimamsa Sutras
The founding text of the Purva
Mimamsa school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy. The
Mimamsa Sutras are traditionally
attributed to the sage Jaimini, who is
believed to have lived in the fourth
century B.C.E. The Mimamsa school
was most concerned with the investiga-
tion of dharma (“righteous action”),
believed to be revealed in the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu religious texts.
Much of Mimamsa thought is con-
cerned with principles and methods
for textual interpretation, to discover
and interpret the instructions contained
in the Vedas. The Mimamsa Sutras
were elaborated in numerous commen-
taries, the most famous of which
were written by Kumarila and
Prabhakara in the seventh century.

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
[[438]]

(“fish-eyed”) Presiding deity of the
Minakshi temple in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. Her name
refers both to the shape of her eyes (long
and oval), and to their fluttering move-
ment, both of which are considered
marks of feminine beauty in classical
India. Minakshi was originally a local
deity, the guardian for the city of
Madurai. As Madurai became impor-
tant, by virtue of being the Pandya
dynasty capital, so did Minakshi.
According to her charter myth, Minakshi
is born with three breasts—already
a sign that she is unusual—and is
raised by her parents as a man. As she
accedes to the throne in Madurai, she
vows that she will only marry a man
who can defeat her in battle. She
fights and conquers all the kings of
the earth, but when she approaches
the god Shiva, she is suddenly stricken
with modesty and transformed from
a powerful warrior to a shy and
bashful girl. At this moment her third
breast disappears, further signifying
the loss of her special status. Minakshi
and Shiva (in his manifestation as
Sundareshvara) are married. Their
wedding is celebrated every year in
Madurai during the Chittirai festival.
Despite her transformation in the
charter myth, Minakshi is still an unusual
goddess. The wedding of a goddess
usually marks her domestication and
implies subordination to her husband.
Minakshi, however, remains the more
important deity in Madurai, perhaps
reflecting her previous status as the
city’s guardian deity. For more informa-
tion see Dean David Shulman, Tamil
Temple Myths, 1980.
Minanath
Another epithet for Matsyendranath,
traditionally cited as the spiritual
teacher (guru) of Gorakhnath, the great
yogi. See Matsyendranath.Mirabai
Miniature Painting
The origins of Hindu miniature painting
lie in the royal art of the Moghul court,
where miniature painting and portrai-
ture were well-established genres. In the
seventeenth century other centers for
miniature painting began to arise, per-
haps spurred by Moghul artists seeking
patronage in Hindu vassal kingdoms.
Although portraiture and court scenes
continued to be important, the minia-
ture genre expanded to include other
themes such as the illustration of the
musical modes known as ragas, which
are associated with particular times
and/or seasons. Another prominent
theme was Hindu religious imagery,
reflecting the influence of the devotional
(bhakti) movement, which was in full
flower in northern India. Religious
themes first concentrated mainly on the
mythic exploits of the god Krishna and
portrayals of the god Shiva. At times,
these two major themes were com-
bined. Miniature paintings were also
used to illustrate manuscripts, thus
integrating literature, art, music, and
religious images.
The development of Hindu minia-
ture painting can be broadly divided
into three schools, each corresponding
to a geographical area: Rajasthani,
Deccani, and Pahari. The earliest devel-
oped school was the Rajasthani, which
flourished in seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries in the Malwa region of
the state of Madhya Pradesh and the
small kingdoms that surrounded the
region. The Rajasthani style is character-
ized by a flat perspective; visual power
is derived from vivid bands of colors that
often serve as a backdrop to the paint-
ing. The Deccani style was established in
central India and showed little variation
from Moghul court art. The Pahari
(“mountain”) style flourished in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms in the Shiwalik Hills
north and west of Delhi. The Pahari style
first appeared in Basohli, where the
influence of the Rajasthani school is evi-
dent, and later developed in Jammu,
Guler, Garhwal, and Kangra. The devel-
oped Pahari style differs from the
Rajasthani style in its emphasis on more
linear drawing—perhaps influenced by
European art—and a more restrained
use of color, giving the paintings a more
lyrical feel. For further information see
W. G. Archer, Indian Painting, 1957. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Minorities
In any society, minority groups are
defined according to a particular social
context. In India the two most promi-
nent minority groups are Muslims and
Christians. Muslims—about twelve per-
cent of the population—are viewed with
suspicion, due to India’s troubled rela-
tions with Pakistan. Christians and
Muslims are viewed as having religious
loyalties that lie outside of India—
Mecca for Muslims, and Rome or
Jerusalem for Christians. These two
communities have been perceived very
differently from other religious commu-
nities, such as the Sikhs and the Jains,
who are part of the Indian cultural tradi-
tion. Cultural and political organiza-
tions espousing forms of Hindu
nationalism (Hindutva), particularly the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh and its
affiliates, have often stressed the “other-
ness” of these communities. Such
organizations have as their express
purpose the unification of Hindus
from all regions, castes, and back-
grounds, but do so through criteria that
exclude these minorities.
Mirabai
(early 16th c.?) A poet-saint who was a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Krishna.
Although little is known about her,
Mirabai’s songs remain some of the
best-known devotional (bhakti) poetry.
According to tradition, Mirabai was
born into a royal family in a small king-
dom in Rajasthan. From her earliest
days, she was passionately devoted to
Krishna. Although her parents arranged
a marriage with the scion of another
[[439]]
Mitakshara
ruler, she considered Krishna to be her
true husband. After extended conflict
with her in-laws—in which they report-
edly attempted to poison her—her
release came with the death of her hus-
band, after which she was allowed to
leave her marital home. She spent her
later years visiting places associated
with Krishna and sharing in the “good
company” (satsang) of other devotees.
She went to Dwaraka, the city over
which Krishna is said to have ruled, and
met her end by being absorbed into the
image of Krishna at his temple there.
Mirabai’s poetry is marked by her
expressions of longing for Krishna. She
often speaks of herself either as his wife
or his waiting lover, seeking physical and
mystical union with him. Her poetry is
an intensely personal expression of her
religious fervor; the power of this long-
ing has made her a symbol of religious
devotion. For scholars, Mirabai’s poetry
raises perplexing questions of author-
ship, for the earliest manuscripts are
several hundred years older than when
she is supposed to have lived, but for
common people the songs bearing her
name are widely popular even today.
She has also been featured in at least ten
feature films, showing the staying power
of devotion even in the modern age. For
further information see A. J. Alston
(trans.), The Devotional Poems of
Mirabai, 1980; and John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs
of the Saints of India, 1988.
Mitakshara
A voluminous commentary on the
Yajnavalkya Smrti, written early in the
twelfth century by the scholar
Vijnaneshvara. This particular com-
mentary played a pivotal role in the
British colonial administration of India.
The British were content to have their
Indian subjects governed by their tradi-
tional religious laws, but to do so they
needed to know what these laws were.
For large sections of British India, the
Mitakshara was given the status of tradi-
tional law, functioning as a legal code.
[[440]]

The only major part of India in which
the Mitakshara did not hold sway was in
Bengal, where the legal authority was
the Dayabhaga. One of the major differ-
ences between the two was in matters of
inheritance. The Mitakshara stresses
inheritance by survivorship, in which
only living males can inherit property,
whereas the Dayabhaga stresses inheri-
tance by succession, in which a dead
man’s heirs can inherit in his name.
Mithila
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Mithila is the king-
dom ruled by King Janaka, foster father
of Sita, the goddess. The region is
known for its wealth, as well as for the
righteousness of its rulers; it is identified
with the Mithila region in the northern
part of the state of modern Bihar.
Mithuna
(“pair”) In architecture, the name for
what has been described as a “loving
couple.” A more candid characterization
is that of sculptures of men and women
engaged in sexual activity, either as a
pair or a larger group, with the occasion-
al animal thrown in for variety. The most
famous examples of such sculptures
are at the temples at Konarak in the
state of Orissa, and at Khajuraho in
the state of Madhya Pradesh. The
meaning behind such explicit sculp-
tures has been variously interpreted.
Some people claim that they sanction
carnal pleasure as a religious path,
some interpret them as representing
human union with the divine, and still
others view them as teaching that the
desire for pleasure must ultimately be
transcended to attain the divine. Any
of these may be true, or the sculptures
may simply reflect an affirmation of life
on all its levels.
Mitra Mishra
(early 17th c.) Author of the Viramitrodaya,
a compendium of Hindu lore. The
Viramitrodaya is an example of a class ofModes of Devotion
commentarial literature known as
nibandhas (“collections”). The compil-
ers of the nibandhas culled references
on a particular theme from the Vedas,
dharma literature, puranas, and other
authoritative religious texts, placing
these excerpts into a single volume.
Each of the Viramitrodaya’s twenty-two
sections is devoted to a particular aspect
of Hindu life, such as daily practice,
worship, gift-giving (dana), vows, pil-
grimage, penances (prayashchitta),
purification, death rites (antyeshthi
samskara), and law; the final section is
devoted to final liberation of the soul
(moksha). In addition to citing the
relevant scriptural passages, Mitra
Mishra also provides extensive com-
mentary of his own. His work became
an important source for later legal inter-
pretation, particularly in eastern India.
Mleccha
Sanskrit word traditionally used to
designate a foreigner or a non-Aryan.
The word mleccha is also used to
indicate a person who has become
an outcaste and thus has no place in
established society. The verb from which
the word mleccha is derived means
“to speak confusedly or indistinctly,”
indicating someone who has not yet
mastered the language.
Mnemonics
The best-known example of a mnemonic
system comes in the study of the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Traditionally, the power of the Vedas is
not derived from the meaning of the
words, but in the very sounds them-
selves. It was imperative for the text to
be conveyed without error. This posed a
significant challenge. The Vedas have
been orally transmitted by an elaborate
system of learning strategies, keeping
the text unchanged for over three thou-
sand years, identical in all parts of India.
This remarkable feat was achieved by
memorizing the text in differing pat-
terns: as verses, as the individual words,
as pairs of words in sequential succes-
sion (ab, bc, cd, and so forth), and
according to some reports, backwards.
The ultimate aim of all of these patterns
was to render the text into sheer sound,
rather than phrases with definite syn-
tactic meaning, since the latter could be
subject to substitutions. Although this
effort has succeeded in preserving the
sacred sounds, in many cases the mean-
ings of these words have become
unclear, especially for words which
appear only once. This problem was evi-
dent as early as the fifth century B.C.E.,
when Yaska, the grammarian, wrote the
Nirukta, explaining the meaning of
many of these words.
Modes of Devotion
Devotion to God (bhakti) has been the
most important force in Hindu religion
for more than the past millennium.
However, the form and tone of this
devotion have varied considerably in
different times and places. The most
thorough articulation of different possi-
ble modes of devotion was done by
Rupa Goswami, who lived in the mid-
sixteenth century. Rupa was a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a mem-
ber of the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious
community founded by the Bengali
saint Chaitanya. Devotion to Krishna is
characterized by the emphasis on rela-
tionship, particularly the visualization
of mythic incidents from Krishna’s life,
through which one can enter his divine
world, and thus take part in his divine
“play” (lila) with the world.
Rupa distinguished five such modes,
which were characterized by growing
emotional intensity. The first was the
“peaceful mode” (shanta bhava), in
which the devotee found mental peace
through the realization of complete
identity with Brahman. This was seen as
an inferior mode, since the deity was
seen impersonally, and the devotee had
no personal relationship with God. The
other four modes were based on human
relationships, from the most distant to
the most intimate and loving: master
[[441]]
Moghul Dynasty

discovered remains of the ancient Indus Valley civilization.
and servant (dasa bhava), friend and
friend (sakha bhava), parent and child
(vatsalya bhava), and lover and beloved
(madhurya bhava). Although all of
these modes were legitimate forms of
relationship with the divine, the last was
considered the highest because it gener-
ated the most intense emotions.
Moghul Dynasty
(1525–1857) Muslim dynasty that ruled
large parts of India for almost 200 years.
The dynasty was established by Babar (r.
[[1625]]
–1630), a central Asian monarch
who had been displaced from his own
homeland in Afghanistan and defeated
the Lodi dynasty rulers at Panipat in
[[1625]]
. Babar’s son Humayan (1508–1556)
acceded to his father’s throne but spent
much of his life fighting an Afghan
threat. He finally recovered his kingdom,
but within six months died from injuries
sustained in a fall. Humayan was suc-
ceeded by his son Akbar (1542–1605),
considered the greatest of the Moghul
emperors, both for his long reign of
forty-nine years and for his efforts to
[[442]]

include his Hindu subjects as equal citi-
zens, not simply as conquered infidels.
Akbar was succeeded by Jahangir
(1569–1627), and Jahangir by Shah Jahan
(1592–1666). The last of the great
Moghuls was Aurangzeb (1618–1707),
who added parts of the Deccan region to
the Moghul empire. During Aurangzeb’s
reign, the Krishna Janam Bhumi in the
city of Mathura and the Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares were
destroyed. Such incidents have caused
much speculation as to whether the
destruction was the result of anti-Hindu
religious sentiments (the Moghuls were
Muslims) or an expression of Moghul
political dominance. After Aurangzeb’s
death the Moghul empire broke apart,
but the dynasty continued to wield
diminishing influence until the 1857
rebellion against the British, when it was
definitively removed.
Mohan
(“beguiling,” “bewildering”) Epithet of
the god Krishna, which may refer either
to his overwhelming attractiveness,Moksha
which is believed to beguile the mind, or
to his ability to wield maya or the power
of illusion, and thus cloud people’s
minds. See Krishna.
Mohenjo-Daro
Archeological site on the Indus River in
modern Pakistan, about two hundred
miles north of Karachi. Mohenjo-Daro is
one of the cities of the Indus Valley civi-
lization, a highly developed urban cul-
ture that flourished in the Indus Valley
region between the fourth and third mil-
lennia B.C.E. Harappa and Mohenjo-
Daro have been the most extensively
excavated of these cities, although
archeological work is proceeding at oth-
ers. Similarities at these different sites
reveal insights into this civilization’s
material culture. One of the features at
Mohenjo-Daro is the “Great Bath,” a
large water-tank built of brick and
sealed with pitch. Scholars speculate
that it was connected with ritual purity.
See also bath, Mohenjo-Daro.
Mohini
(“bewitching”) In Hindu mythology,
a
rapturously
beautiful,
divine
enchantress, seen as a manifestation of
the god Vishnu. Vishnu takes this form
to trick the demons into giving her their
share of the amrta, the nectar of immor-
tality, which has been churned from the
Ocean of Milk. Through her charms,
Mohini succeeds in getting the amrta
from the demons; she gives it to the
gods, thus depriving the demons of their
chance at immortality.
In most versions, the story ends here,
but the charter myth for the southern
Indian god Aiyappa adds an interesting
twist. According to the story, when Shiva
sees the enchanting figure of Mohini, he
cannot resist her. The product of this
union is Aiyappa, who is considered the
son of Shiva and Vishnu. Yet Aiyappa’s
unusual parentage occurs with good
reason, as with most such stories in
Hindu mythology. Aiyappa is born to kill
a demon named Mahishi, who has
received the boon that she can only
be killed by a person not born from
the union of male and female.
Mohini’s “true” identity (Vishnu) satis-
fies this condition, and when Aiyappa
comes of age he kills the demon. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Mohini Attam
The youngest form of classical Indian
dance, found mainly in the modern
state of Kerala. Mohini Attam was devel-
oped in the early eighteenth century
at the royal court in Travancore in
Kerala. This style of dance shows traits of
both Bharatanatyam and Kathakali, a
Keralan dance form. The dance is
named after the mythical enchantress
Mohini and projects a coquettish
sensuality. Some of the dance’s physical
poses are taken from Bharatanatyam,
whereas the stylized hand gestures
(mudras) come largely from Kathakali.
For further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Mohini Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright, waxing half of
the lunar month of Baisakh (April–
May). The festival is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu in his avatar as
Rama. Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, promising spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance;
observing this festival frees one from the
results of one’s evil acts.
Moksha
In Indian philosophy moksha is one of
the four purusharthas, or aims of life;
the others are artha (wealth, power, and
prosperity), kama (desire), and dharma
(righteousness). Moksha literally means
“release”—the human soul’s (atman)
final liberation from the cycle of reincar-
nation (samsara). The quest for libera-
tion involves questioning and ultimately
detaching oneself from pursuits of
[[443]]
Mokshada Ekadashi
normal social life. Although all four
purusharthas are legitimate and sanc-
tioned, liberation is usually seen as the
ultimate goal, the last goal to be pursued
after fulfilling the pleasures and pains
stemming from the other three. Moksha
is also unchanging, bringing one com-
plete and absolute freedom, whereas
the other three are ultimately tran-
sient, for they are pursued within the
ever-changing world of desires.
Mokshada Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright half of
Margashirsha (November–December).
As for all the eleventh-day observances,
this is dedicated to Vishnu. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites
usually involving fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promising specific
benefits for faithful performance.
Faithfully observing this festival is
believed to bestow final liberation
(moksha) of the soul.
Moneylending
An important element in the economic
activity of the traditional and modern
Indian merchant families. Since farmers
have profits only after the harvest, they
must be able to borrow during the other
times of the year. In modern times many
farmers borrow from banks, but in
earlier times their only resource was
these merchant families. Their interest
rates usually reflected the borrower’s
credit worthiness: unsecured loans
might have interest rates as high as 30 to
[[50]]
 percent per year because there was a
good chance for default, whereas the
interest on loans secured by collateral
might be as low as seven percent. To
some extent, these moneylending mer-
chants were economically bound to
their farmer-creditors, with one provid-
ing the capital and the other providing
the labor. Moneylenders could not
refuse credit to farmers after a bad year,
since this would have removed any hope
of future repayment. For further infor-
mation see Christopher Alan Bayly,
Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars, 1983.
Monday
(Somavar) The second day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is the
moon. The moon is associated with
coolness, healing power, and Soma,
the Vedic deity. The Hindu god Shiva
is manifested as Somnath, the Lord of
the Moon. Monday is considered one
of the most powerful and auspicious
days of the week. Worship on certain
Mondays is believed to bring even
greater religious benefits, such as
on a Somavati Amavasya, (a new
moon falling on a Monday), and on
the Mondays in Shravan (a lunar
month specially dedicated to Shiva).
The Sixteen Mondays Vow (Solah
Somvar Vrat) is performed on sixteen
consecutive Mondays. Like other
such vows, the Solah Somvar Vrat
entails reading the vow’s charter myth
in a ritual setting, combined with
worship and a regulated diet.
[[444]]

Monsoon
A season of torrential rains, whose name
comes from an Arabic word meaning
“season” (mausam). The monsoon is
preceded by a period of intense heat;
daily temperatures go over one hundred
degrees Fahrenheit. As the hot air rises,
it draws in a vast current of moisture-
laden air from the coastal regions of
southern India. The monsoon is one of
the year’s three major seasons and is a
vital part of people’s daily lives. Because
much of India’s farmland is not irrigated,
the monsoon rains are vital to agricul-
ture. The coming of the monsoon is
much awaited in real life; it also has a
prominent place in Indian culture. One
image of the monsoon comes from love
poetry, in which a woman is anxiously
scanning the sky, watching the clouds
roll up as she awaits her returning
beloved. In earlier times the rains made
travel almost impossible, making it a
bitter time for separated lovers but aMudra
sweet and happy time for united couples.
The poet Kalidasa’s epic Meghaduta
describes a man exiled in southern
India, who addresses one of the mon-
soon clouds, giving it a message to con-
vey to his beloved. The monsoon rains
are also associated with the god
Krishna. His dark skin color is com-
pared to a rain cloud. Also, his birthday
is celebrated at the end of the rainy
season, and his divine persona appro-
priates the image of the lover associated
with the rains.
Moon
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with fecundity (fertility),
although its aspect can be either benev-
olent or malevolent—benevolent with
the waxing moon, and malevolent with
the waning moon. During the lunar
month, the full moon is considered the
most auspicious time of all. The new
moon, however, is considered a ritually
ambiguous time, and thus potentially
dangerous. During the week the moon
presides over Monday, generally consid-
ered an auspicious day and one that is
sacred to Shiva as Somnath, the Lord of
the Moon.
Morari Bapu
(b. Muraridas Prabhudas 1946) Modern
commentator and expositor (kathava-
cak) on the Ramcharitmanas. Written
by the poet-saint Tulsidas, the
Ramcharitmanas is a vernacular version
of the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Sanskrit epics. As with all vernac-
ular renditions of the Ramayana,
Tulsidas did not simply translate
Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic, but adapted it to
address his own religious concerns, par-
ticularly the importance of devotion
(bhakti) to God, one of the text’s central
themes. Morari Bapu claims no super-
natural powers or ability; his religious
fame rests solely on his commitment to
the text, and his power in expounding it.
At times he speaks to audiences of more
than 100,000 people, giving katha
(discourse) to the Hindu diaspora pop-
ulations in Europe and North America,
as well as in India.
Mrcchakatika
(“The Little Clay Cart”) Drama written
by the playwright Shudraka, probably in
the early fifth century. The play
describes the flowering of love between
a poor but noble brahmin, Charudatta,
and a wealthy and virtuous courtesan,
Vasantasena, set in the context of a
complicated political intrigue. The play
is noted for its portrayal of everyday
urban life, exemplified by the little
clay cart—a child’s toy. It has been
translated into several languages and is
periodically performed for modern
American audiences.
Mrtyunjaya
(“Conqueror of Death”) Epithet of the
god Shiva. The mythic charter behind
this particular name comes from the
story of the sage Markandeya. Devoted
to Shiva, Markandeya is an intelligent
and religious boy who is proficient in all
branches of learning. His story is
poignant because he is fated to die at
sixteen. When Markandeya learns of
this, shortly before his sixteenth birth-
day, he begins to worship Shiva with
even greater fervor. On the appointed
day, Yama, the god of death, comes to
claim Markandeya. When Yama throws
his noose over Markandeya to draw
out the boy’s soul, it catches the statue
of Shiva to which Markandeya is
clinging. Shiva arises from the image
and kills Yama, saving Markandeya’s
life. Although Shiva relents and restores
Yama to life, this particular form of
Shiva illustrates his power to protect his
devotees (bhakta) from all things,
including death.
Mudra
(“seal”) In Indian dance, theater, and
iconography, a mudra is a stylized hand
gesture that conveys a specific meaning,
ranging from concrete things such as
[[445]]
Mudra
animals, everyday objects, and the
Hindu deities, to abstract things such as
emotions. In the context of the perform-
ing arts, particularly dance, performers
tell detailed stories through gesture
alone. In the context of iconography,
many of these gestures are traits associ-
ated with particular deities. There
is some syntactic overlap between
the terms mudra and hasta (“hand”);
one of the distinctions between them
is that some of the hastas simply
describe the position of the hand, and
others have symbolic meaning, whereas
mudras always have very specific
symbolic meanings.
Mudra
(2) Fermented or parched grain. In the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, fermented grain is the
fourth of the “Five Forbidden Things”
(panchamakara), which, in “left hand”
(vamachara) tantric ritual, are used in
their actual forms, whereas in “right
hand” (dakshinachara) tantric ritual
they are represented by symbolic substi-
tutes. Fermented grain may have intoxi-
cating effects, but it is also reputed to be
an aphrodisiac. “Respectable” Hindu
society strongly condemns the use of
intoxicants and/or sexual license. Thus
the ritual use of this substance must be
seen in the larger tantric context. One of
the most pervasive tantric assumptions
is the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle means that the adept must
reject all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality. In this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a con-
scious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara), and
is thus superior to common practice. For

Mudrarakshasa
(“Rakshasa’s Ring”) The only surviving
Sanskrit drama written by the
playwright Vishakhadatta, who is
believed to have lived in the sixth
century. The play chronicles the rise of
Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the
Maurya dynasty, and the machinations
of his cunning brahmin minister,
Chanakya. The drama’s plot is highly
complex, as with many Sanskrit plays,
but its climax comes when the principal
characters are dramatically rescued
from execution at the last moment.
Although the play is based on actual
events, historians feel that the portrayal
of Chandragupta Maurya as a weak king
is inaccurate. The play has been trans-
lated into English by Michael Coulson
and published in an anthology titled
Three Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Mueller, F. Max
(1823–1900) Linguist, translator, editor,
and ardent student of comparative
religion and mythology. Mueller was
an important figure in nineteenth-
century intellectual history. His primary
contribution was introducing Indian
ideas to Western audiences by translat-
ing primary texts into the Sacred Books
of the East series. His work allowed
Hindu and other Asian religious
traditions to show the sophisticated
thought often concealed by popular
religious practice. Mueller began
developing a “science of religion”—
a field of knowledge that could be
pursued as any other. As a professor
at Oxford, he helped to change scholarly
views on Hinduism and other Asian
religions, moving Western minds from
simply dismissing them as polytheistic
“idolatry” to taking them seriouslyMuktiyoga
as coherent and compelling pictures of
the world.
Muhurta
In traditional timekeeping, a muhurta is
a period of forty-eight minutes, of which
there are thirty during each day. The
Brahma Muhurta is the most auspi-
cious time period, coming directly
before dawn. The time before the
Brahma Muhurta is considered the least
auspicious in the day. This cycle exem-
plifies a pattern in the Indian view of
time. A period of inauspiciousness is
typically followed by a sudden regenera-
tion of fortune.
Mukhalinga
A form of the linga, the pillar-shaped
object symbolizing the god Shiva. A
mukhalinga has one or more faces
(mukha) sculpted on the shaft of the
linga. According to the manuals detail-
ing the form and construction of Hindu
images, the number of faces on the linga
should not exceed the number of door-
ways in the temple. Thus, a temple with
one doorway should have a mukhalinga
with one face, and so on, up to four. The
manuals also specify that these faces
should be placed facing the entrances.

Iconography, 1981.
Muktananda
(1908–1982) Modern Hindu teacher,
proponent of a religious path named
siddha yoga (“discipline of the adepts”),
and founder of the organization named
SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham America).
Muktananda left his family at age fifteen
to search for spiritual enlightenment.
His spiritual master (guru) was an
ascetic named Nityananda, who was
widely believed to be an avadhuta (a
person who has shaken off all attach-
ments). Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a
modified form of Kashmir Shaivism.
The organization’s signature teaching is
that the guru’s spiritual power can
immediately awaken the disciple’s latent
kundalini, hastening the process of
spiritual development. This doctrine
emphasizes the importance of the guru,
reinforced by Muktananda’s charismatic
presence. Although his home base was
an ashram just outside of Bombay,
Muktananda traveled throughout the
world, establishing ashrams and medi-
tation centers in North America,
Europe, and Australia. He was suc-
ceeded by Swami Chidvilasananda. For
further information on Muktananda’s
teaching, see his autobiography, Play of
Consciousness, 2000.
Muktibai
(1279–1297?) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba, at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Muktibai was the sister of the great
Varkari teacher Jnaneshvar.
Muktinath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) at the
headwaters of the Kali Gandaki River in
Nepal; the temple sits at nearly 13,000
feet at the foot of Annapurna, one of the
highest mountains in Nepal. Muktinath
is a sacred site to both Hindus and
Buddhists; each has a temple there. The
Buddhist temple is built over a vent of
natural gas, which produces a flame
when lit. The Hindu temple, dedicated
to the god Vishnu, is built over a natural
spring that is channelled outside the
temple through 108 spouts shaped like
heads of cows. The Kali Gandaki River is
also religiously important because the
river bed is one of the major sites of fos-
silized black ammonite. Known as the
shalagram, this ammonite is considered
a self-manifestation (svayambhu) form
of Vishnu.
Muktiyoga
In the Dvaita Vedanta philosophical
school propounded by Madhva, a
[[447]]
Muladhara Chakra
A man’s head is shaved in the traditional Hindu practice of mundan.
Removing one’s hair is believed to be purifying.
muktiyoga is a person who is predes-
tined to attain liberation. See also
Dvaita Vedanta.
Muladhara Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, the muladhara chakra
is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) believed to exist in the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system existing on a dif-
ferent plane of reality than matter, but
corresponding to the material body. The
six psychic centers are visualized as
multipetaled lotus flowers running
roughly along the spine, connected by
three vertical channels. Each of the
chakras has symbolic associations with
various human capacities, various sub-
tle elements (tanmatras), and different
seed syllables (bijaksharas) formed
from the letters of the Sanskrit alpha-
bet, encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the two divine principles
[[448]]

through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind the concept of the
subtle body is the homology of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mysti-
cal texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated starting from the bottom; the
muladhara chakra is the first. It is visual-
ized as a four-petaled lotus, located in
the region at the base of the spine. The
petals each contain a seed syllable, in
this case the consonants from “va” to
“sa.” The muladhara chakra is associat-
ed as the bodily seat for the subtle
element of earth, to which excretions
are compared. The muladhara chakra is
also considered the locus for the
kundalini, the latent spiritual energy
present in all human beings, visualized
as a serpent wound three times around
the muladhara chakra. Despite its
associations with the most mundane
element and the most impure bodily
function, the muladhara is also
the source of potential for religious
attainment. For further informationMurari Gupta
see Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Mulamantra
(“root mantra”) A mulamantra is a
sacred sound or sounds (mantra) that
are considered to be the most subtle
form of a deity. Every Hindu deity has a
mulamantra. Different manifestations
of the deity usually have different
mantras, which are associated with
them alone. The mulamantra is usually
considered to be the highest and truest
form of the deity, since it is nothing but
sacred sound.
Munda
A demon general killed by the Goddess
in the Devimahatmya, a Sanskrit text
which is the earliest and most important
mythic source for the cult of the
Goddess. This text describes the
Goddess in several different manifesta-
tions. The seventh book tells how the
goddess Ambika’s anger takes form as
the terrifying goddess Kali. Kali attacks
the demon armies commanded by
Munda and his companion Chanda.
After destroying the armies, Kali
beheads the two generals. As a memorial
of this mythic deed, the Goddess is
worshiped by the name Chamunda, the
slayer of Chanda and Munda.
Mundan
(“shaving”) In general terms, mundan
refers to any type of haircutting or shav-
ing done for religious purposes, such as
the head-shaving traditionally done at
certain pilgrimage places (tirtha). In
Tirupati in southern India, the hair is
given as an offering to the presiding
deity; shaving is also a means of ritual
purification, as in the rites for the dead.
In a more specific sense, mundan is
often used as a synonym for the chu-
dakarana samskara, a life-cycle rite in
which a young child’s head is shaved,
removing the last residual impurities
from birth. See also hair.
Muni
A term of ancient provenance, dating
back to the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious text. In the Vedas this term
is used to denote an ascetic, sage,
or seer, particularly one keeping a
vow of silence.
Murali
In Hindu mythology, murali is the god
Krishna’s flute. As recounted in sectarian
texts such as the Bhagavata Purana, and
countless
vernacular
devotional
(bhakti) poems, the sound of this flute
has an enticing quality that is irresistible
to Krishna’s devotees (bhakta). When
they hear its melody, they rush to
Krishna’s presence. The flute and its
siren song are seen as an extension of
Krishna’s own enticing presence.
Murals
Sanskrit literature contains numerous
references to mural painting. In early
medieval times, these were common
forms of decorating both temples and
the homes of the wealthy. The heat and
moisture of the Indian climate have not
been kind to such artwork; few exam-
ples remain today. The most famous
murals are at Buddhist sites—Ajanta in
central India and Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.
These murals convey themes about
everyday life. There are also traces of
painting in the caves at Ellora. Paintings
from the Chola era were recently discov-
ered at the Rajrajeshvar temple in
Tanjore; they are being restored. See
also Chola dynasty.
Murari
(“Mura’s enemy”) Epithet of the god
Krishna. Mura is an extremely powerful
demon who conquers all of the gods. He
is eventually killed in battle by Krishna.
See Krishna.
Murari Gupta
(16th c.) Author of the earliest version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
[[449]]
Murti
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account
describing the life of the Bengali saint
Chaitanya (1486–1533). Murari Gupta’s
text focuses on Chaitanya’s early life up
to his southern Indian pilgrimage end-
ing in 1513. The last part of the text
briefly mentions his pilgrimage to
Brindavan in 1514 and his final return
to Puri, where he lived for the rest of his
life. Like the other traditional accounts
of Chaitanya’s life, this does not purport
to be an “objective” biography; it is
rather a hagiography (idealized portrait)
written by a passionate devotee (bhakta).
Nevertheless, Murari Gupta was a con-
temporary and companion of Chaitanya;
his text reflects first-hand experience
and is the most reliable of these tradi-
tional sources.
Murti
(“shape,” “form”) The most common
name for a sculptural image of a Hindu
deity fashioned by human beings, rather
than those that are self-manifested
(svayambhu images) forms of the deity.
Murugan
(“fragrant, beautiful”) Hindu deity pri-
marily worshiped in southern India.
Murugan originally appears in the Tamil
Sangam literature, where he is a hill
deity associated with the hunt and wild,
unsettled places. One of Murugan’s
characteristic objects is the lance, sym-
bolizing the hunt. As brahminical Hindu
culture gradually came to southern
India, Murugan was drawn into the
established pantheon as a form of the
god Skanda, who is the son of the god
Shiva. By the tenth century Murugan’s
identity had evolved as that of a philoso-
pher and exponent of the Shaiva
Siddhanta philosophical school and as
the patron deity of Tamil language and
literature. For southern Indians, espe-
cially in the state of Tamil Nadu, wor-
shiping Murugan becomes a vehicle to
affirm their traditional culture. This has
been particularly true since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947, when the attempt to
[[450]]

impose Hindi as the national language
was seen as northern Indian cultural
imperialism and was met with
incredible resistance. The cult of
Murugan has five major pilgrimage cen-
ters—Palani, Tiruchendur, Tiruttani,
Tirrupparankunram, and Swami Malai.
All of these sites are located in different
parts of Tamil Nadu. This network of
sacred sites (tirthas) is a way in which
the cult of Murugan has come to sym-
bolize Tamil identity. For further infor-
mation see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of
Murukan,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 40, No.1, 1972.
Musala
(“pestle”) A musala is a grinding pestle,
used with a mortar to husk and grind
grain. Miniature versions were used to
grind spices. Aside from its utilitarian
use, the musala’s long, club-like shape
could easily serve as a weapon. It is one
of the characteristic objects in Hindu
iconography, appearing with images of
various deities—the Goddess, Shiva,
and Vishnu.The Illustrated Encyclopedia

CIPNachiketas
## N
Nabhadas
(c. 1600) Author of the Bhaktamal
(“Garland of Devotees”). In this hagio-
graphic text, he gives short (six line)
accounts of the lives of more than two
hundred contemporary bhakti (devo-
tional) figures, some from personal
experience. Although Nabhadas identi-
fies himself as a Ramanandi—a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama—his work
includes devotees of all sectarian per-
suasions. The text is notably free of mar-
velous and miraculous events, and
Nabhadas emphasizes the devotee’s
personal qualities, to serve as a model of
devotion for others. In many cases the
Bhaktamal gives the earliest reliable
account for these figures, making it an
important source for northern Indian
literary and religious history. Despite its
importance the text cannot be defini-
tively dated, although internal evidence
suggests that it was completed early in
the seventeenth century.
Nacciyar Tirumoli
One of two collections of poetry com-
posed by the poet-saint Andal (9th c.),
the other being the Tirruppavai. Andal
was the only woman among the Alvars,
a group of twelve poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. All the Alvars were
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
Their emphasis on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage, transformed and revitalized
Hindu religious life. Andal’s chosen
deity was Ranganatha, the form of
Vishnu presiding at the temple of
Shrirangam. Yet both collections of her
poetry are dedicated to Krishna, a dif-
ferent form of Vishnu. This seeming
divergence may reflect her conviction
that all manifestations of Vishnu are
ultimately the same or indicate the dif-
ference between personal devotion and
literary expression.
The thirty poems in the Nacciyar
Tirumoli are told by a group of unmar-
ried girls, who have taken a vow to bathe
in the river at dawn during the coldest
month of the year. This vow has a long
history in southern India, where young
girls would take the oath to gain a good
husband and a happy married life. In the
poem, the girls have taken the vow to
gain Krishna as their husband. The
poems in the cycle describe various fea-
tures of the natural world at dawn, the
girls’ hopes in performing the vow, and
their return to Krishna’s house to awaken
him and beg for his grace. The final
poem in the series describes the benefits
gained by one who chants the text.
Nachiketas
A primary character in the Kathka
Upanishad, a speculative philosophical
text considered one of the later upan-
ishads. In the text, the boy Nachiketas is
the seeker of ultimate wisdom. In a fit of
anger his father curses him to be given
to Death; Nachiketas obediently goes to
the house of Death to give himself up.
He waits for three days at Death’s door,
but receives none of the hospitality due
to a brahmin guest. When Death returns
he is disturbed to discover that his guest
has been neglected. To atone for the
lapse, Death offers Nachiketas three
boons. With his first two, Nachiketas
wishes to return to his father and to
understand the meaning of a particular
sacrificial ritual. With the final boon he
asks what happens to a person after the
death of the body. Death first tries to
evade the question, then tries to bribe
Nachiketas with other gifts. When the
boy holds firm in his resolve, Death
begins to reveal his secrets. This dis-
course makes up the bulk of the text.
Death’s secrets focus mainly on the
[[451]]
Nadi
reality of the Self (atman), its eternal
and indestructible nature, and the diffi-
culties in truly knowing it. The Self is
portrayed as the ultimate truth, and to
know it is to know the only thing that
really matters.
Nadi
(“tube”) In general, the word nadi may
be applied to any pipe or tube,
whether in plumbing or the human
circulatory system. A nadi has a more
specialized meaning with regard to
the Hindu conception of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system, existing on a
different plane than gross matter, but
corresponding to the material body. It
consists of six psychic centers
(chakras), visualized as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along
the spine, connected by three vertical
channels known as nadis. Of these,
the ida nadi is on the left side, the
pingala nadi on the right, and the
sushumna in the center.
Naga
(“naked”) The general term for any fight-
ing or militant ascetic. Ascetic orders
traditionally chartered companies of
fighting ascetics to protect the members
and their resources. The Naga orders of
the Dashanami Sanyasis were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva, whereas the
Bairagi orders were devotees of the god
Vishnu. In northern India during the
eighteenth century these Naga ascetics
developed into dynamic military and
mercantile powerhouses. In several
instances, Naga ascetics managed to
carve out petty kingdoms of their own.
In many other instances, they had sig-
nificant influence in the northern
Indian economy and politics, whether in
their own right or as mercenary soldiers
in the service of a reigning monarch.
Their name was a literal description of
their practices, since many of these
ascetics would go into battle bearing
only their weapons. Their ash-smeared
[[452]]

bodies and flying matted hair presented
a fearsome sight. As Indian social and
political circumstances have changed,
their military importance has faded.
However, these organizations (akhara)
of Naga ascetics still exist, although they
are most important now in determining
the order for bathing (snana) at the
Kumbha Mela. The accounts of the
ascetics themselves are full of tales of
strife along sectarian lines (Shaivas ver-
sus Vaishnavas); a good indication that
the Shaivas gained superiority is that
they have priority in the bathing at the
Kumbha Melas. For further information
see Jadunath Sarkar, A History of the
Dasanami Naga Sanyasis, 1958; David
Lorenzen, “Warrior Ascetics in Indian
History,” in Journal of the American
Oriental Society, Vol. 98, No. 1, 1978;
and James G. Lochtefeld, “The Vishva
Hindu Parishad and the Roots of
Hindu Militancy,” in Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. LXII,
No. 2, 1994.
Naga
(2) In Hindu mythology, the Nagas are a
class of minor divinities who have the
form of serpents. Their king is Vasuki. In
popular Hinduism, Nagas are often con-
sidered to be the gods of a specific place.
Often associated with fertility and
fecundity, Nagas are usually believed to
live in springs, ponds, and other small
bodies of water. In Buddhist and Jain
iconography the Nagas often play the
role of minor protective deities. It is
common to see a seated figure shad-
owed by an “umbrella” of Nagas.
Although this is unusual in Hindu
iconography, there may be remnants
of this in the iconography of the god
Shiva, who is often depicted wearing
snakes for both his ornaments and his
sacred thread.
Nagara
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture,
along with the Dravida and the Veshara.Nagara
Built in the Nagara style, the Triloknath Temple in Mandi consists of a series of towers,
the largest of which contains an image of the presiding deity.
The Nagara style is found throughout
northern and eastern India. One of its
prominent features is a shikhara or
tower. The shikhara is often surrounded
by smaller towers that lead the eye up to
the highest point, which is directly over
the image of the temple’s primary deity.
Within this general pattern there are two
variants, exemplified by the temples at
Khajuraho and Orissa.
In Khajuraho the series of shikha-
ras are connected, forming a continu-
ous rising swell that draws the eye
upward, similar to a series of hills
leading to a distant peak. This vertical-
ity is accentuated through the use of
turrets (urushringas) on the sides of
the towers, which replicate the shape
of the final peak. The entire temple is
set on a raised base (adhishthana).
Within the temple there are usually
several different zones: an entrance
porch (ardhamandapa), a hall (man-
dapa), an intermediate area (antarala),
and a central shrine (garbhagrha) sur-
rounded by a processional path
[[453]]
Nageshvar
(pradakshina). Despite their different
parts, temples built in the Khajuraho
style convey the artistic impression of
an integrated, unified whole.
The Orissan style emphasizes the
contrast between the temple’s con-
stituent parts. The two central compo-
nents are the entrance hall (jagamohan)
and the beehive-shaped temple tower
(deul). The tower is often three or four
times taller than the entrance hall, a dif-
ference that tends to heighten the con-
trast between the two. Other sections
include a dance-hall (natamandira),
traditionally used for performances, and
a “food pavilion” (bhogamandapa),
where the prasad was cooked. These
architectural elements are connected
like beads on a string, as seemingly sep-
arable parts lined up with one another.
The most important temples in the
Orissan style are the Lingaraja Temple
in Bhubaneshvar, the Jagannath
temple in Puri, and the Sun Temple
at Konarak.
Nageshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) about fif-
teen miles northeast of the holy city of
Dwaraka, in the eastern state of
Gujarat. The temple is named after its
presiding deity, the god Shiva in his
manifestation as the “Lord of Serpents.”
Shiva is present at Nageshvar in the
form of a linga, a pillar-shaped image.
The Nageshvar linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites at which
Shiva is uniquely present. Nageshvar’s
charter myth is based on the story of the
demon Daruk and his wife Daruka.
Daruka is a fervent devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva’s wife Parvati; through Parvati’s
grace Daruka gains protection for all the
other demons. The demons use this
power to oppress the righteous. As the
demons are about to kill one of Shiva’s
devotees, Shiva appears and slays them.
Parvati has come along with Shiva to
protect Daruka, her devotee. Daruka
persuades Shiva and Parvati to remain
in Nageshvar as a sign of their grace.
Since the city of Dwaraka is also
[[454]]

connected with the god Krishna, some
scholars believe the Nageshvar linga
may have been promoted to maintain a
Shaivite presence in an important
Vaishnava area.
Nag Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day (pan-
chami) of the bright, waxing half of the
lunar month of Shravan (July–August).
This day is devoted to the worship of
serpents, whether as Nagas—the minor
deities who take the form of snakes—or
actual cobras and other snakes. On this
day the images of the Naga deities are
bathed and given offerings. Offerings
are also made to real serpents. On this
day people refrain from digging in the
earth, since snakes live there.
This rite occurs on the fifth day
because in astrology (jyotisha), the
guardian deity for this day is Shesha, the
god Vishnu’s serpent couch. This festi-
val falls at the beginning of the rainy
season, when the rising waters caused
by the monsoon rains often drive snakes
out of their dens, and at times into peo-
ples’ homes and gardens. The rainy sea-
son is also the time for growing crops;
snakes pose a real danger for people
working in the fields. According to one
estimate, 10,000 Indians die from
snakebites every year. According to pop-
ular belief, observing this rite will pro-
tect one from snakebites for the entire
year. This observance is a protective rit-
ual, marking the advent of a dangerous
time for many villagers.
Nagpur
City in the eastern state of Maharashtra.
Nagpur is the birthplace of the Hindu
nationalist organization known as the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh. The
organization was formed in 1925 by Dr.
K. B. Hedgewar and still maintains its
headquarters in Nagpur.
Nahusha
In Hindu mythology, a king of the lunar
dynasty, and a paradigm for a personNaina Devi
afflicted with self-pride. Through
amassing religious merits, Nahusha suc-
ceeds to the throne of Indra, the king of
the gods, who has gone into hiding
because of an evil deed. Nahusha is
filled with lust for Indra’s wife, Indrani.
He tries to act on it despite the obvious
improprieties of approaching another
man’s wife and a mortal making a claim
on a goddess. Nahusha sets off for
Indrani’s palace in a palanquin. In his
impatience, he whips the palanquin
bearers, saying “Sarpa, sarpa” (“Move!
Move!”). Unfortunately for Nahusha,
one of the bearers is Agastya, the sage.
For Nahusha’s lust and disrespect,
Agastya curses him to become a
snake (sarpa). Nahusha remains a
serpent for many years but is released
from the curse by the sight of the
Pandava brothers.
Nai
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which the
group held a monopoly. The Nai jati’s
occupation was barbering, a low status
job because it required continual con-
tact with cut human hair, considered
a source of impurity (ashaucha). In
many instances the Nais also served
as messengers.
Naimisha
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the state
of Uttar Pradesh, about fifty miles
northwest of the city of Lucknow. In the
later sectarian literature known as the
puranas, Naimisha is described as a for-
est. Today the city’s major attraction is a
spring-fed bathing (snana) pool named
Chakra Tirtha. According to tradition,
this bathing pool contains water from
all the holy places of India, and thus is
the best place for pious Hindus to take a
holy bath.
Naimittika Karma
(“occasional [ritual] action”) One of
three general types of ritual action, the
others being nitya karma and kamya
karma. Naimittika karma rites follow a
particular cause (naimittika); when par-
ticular circumstances arise, one is
required to perform the ritual. For
example, when a child is born, certain
rites must be performed. However, the
ritual is not required unless a birth has
taken place.
Naina Devi
Presiding deity of the Naina Devi temple
in the Shiwalik Hills in the state of
Himachal Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. Naina Devi’s tem-
ple is located on a mountaintop close to
the border of Punjab. It is nine miles
from Anandpur Sahib, a famous Sikh
place of pilgrimage, and about one mile
from Nangal village. The greatest pil-
grimage traffic occurs during festivals
held on the eighth day in each half of the
lunar month of Shravan, and also dur-
ing the first nine days of the month of
Ashvin, when the Navaratri festival
takes place.
According to the temple’s charter
myth, Naina Devi is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess which spreads throughout the
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks
the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess;
Naina Devi was Sati’s eyes (naina). As
with many of the other Shiwalik god-
desses, the images in Naina Devi’s tem-
ple are self-manifested (svayambhu
images) outcrops of stone. In a different
version of the myth, the images were
discovered by a herdsman named
Naina, who heeded the command of
the Goddess to build a temple for her.

Naisthika
Naisthika
(“fixed”) A person who takes a vow to
remain a perpetual religious student
(brahmacharin), keeping lifelong vows
of celibacy, austerity, study, and service
to his or her religious preceptor (guru).
to be incompatible with certain everyday
activities, which should be avoided during
that time. Hindus who pay attention to
astrology are keenly aware of the passage
of time and the quality of each moment.
Nakula
Naivedya
(“to be presented”) The thirteenth of the
sixteen traditional upacharas (“offer-
ings”) given to a deity as part of worship.
To treat the deity as an honored guest, a
person may offer food. The food is often
returned to the worshipers as prasad, the
sanctified food bearing the deity’s grace.
The offering may be done in various ways,
but the underlying motive for all the
upacharas is to show one’s love for the
deity and attend to the deity’s needs.
Naiyayika
Term for a follower of the Nyaya and
Vaisheshika philosophical schools, two of
the six schools in Hindu philosophy. After
the early centuries of the common era, the
Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools merged, as
did the Samkhya and Yoga schools and
the Mimamsa and Vedanta schools. The
term Naiyayika is used to denote a follower
of the combined Nyaya-Vaisheshika
school of philosophy.
Nakshatra
In Indian astrology (jyotisha), a nakshatra
is one of the twenty-seven signs in the
lunar zodiac. In a single lunar month the
moon moves through each of the twenty-
seven lunar houses. The territory for these
lunar houses is divided equally through-
out the solar zodiac—with 2.25 lunar
houses for each of the twelve solar signs.
The nakshatras are important in Indian
astrology, partly because they change
quite rapidly, but also because the charac-
ter and qualities associated with each
nakshatra are believed to color the time
period in which they fall. One group of five
nakshatras, the Panchak Nakshatra, is
considered extremely inauspicious; many
activities will be curtailed until this period
has passed. Certain nakshatras are judged
[[456]]

In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Nakula is the
fourth of the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s antagonists. Nakula’s mother,
Madri, is the younger wife of King Pandu.
None of the Pandava brothers are actually
Pandu’s sons, since he has been cursed to
die the moment he holds his wife in
amorous embrace. Instead, they are mag-
ically created through the effect of a
mantra given to Madri’s co-wife, Kunti, by
the sage Durvasas. The mantra gives the
woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods to conceive a son
who will be as powerful as the god himself.
With Pandu’s blessing Kunti teaches the
mantra to Madri. She meditates on the
Ashvins, the divine twins who are the
physicians of the gods. Thus, she bears
twins. As the sons of the physicians of the
gods, both Nakula and Sahadeva are
skilled healers of animals and human
beings. Although Nakula and Sahadeva
are among the five Pandava brothers, they
are less important to the Mahabharata
than their three elder siblings.
Nala
In Hindu mythology, the King of
Nishadas and the husband of Damayanti.
The story of Nala and Damayanti appears
as a story within the Mahabharata, the
later of the two great Hindu epics. It is
recounted to the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s protagonists, during their twelve
year exile in the forest, as a way to keep up
their spirits by telling how others have
transcended misfortune.
When Damayanti is old enough to
marry, her father sends invitations to the
kings of the earth, announcing her
svayamvara, a rite in which Damayanti
will choose her husband. The kings of
the earth come to the svayamvara to
seek her hand, as do the gods (devas)Namakarana (“name-giving”) Samskara
themselves. Yet Damayanti has already
decided to choose Nala after being
advised by a swan who praises him. The
gods try to foil this by taking on the
physical appearance of Nala, so that
Damayanti will not be able to tell the
difference between them. As a last
resort, Damayanti makes an act of
truth, a ritual action whose efficacy is
based on the power of truth. In her act of
truth, Damayanti declares that she has
never loved anyone but Nala. To prove
that this statement is true, she directs
the gods to resume their true forms.
Compelled by the power of truth, the
gods immediately do as she commands.
Nala and Damayanti are married, and as
a reward for her fidelity, the gods give
Nala various divine gifts. Hearing of the
marriage, two of the rejected suitors
curse Nala to lose his kingdom. Because
of the curse, Nala and Damayanti are
separated and suffer long tribulations,
which include Nala having his body
magically changed so that no one is able
to recognize him. In the end Damayanti
recognizes him by his divine powers,
which cannot be hidden, and the lovers
are happily reunited. See also truth,
power of.
Naladiyar
One of the most important pieces of
early Tamil literature, along with its pre-
decessor, the Tirukkural. The Naladiyar
is a collection of four hundred verses
that date from the fifth or sixth century.
Mainly concerned with moral and ethi-
cal life, the verses were written by a
group of Jain monks who found shelter
with a pious king in time of famine. In
gratitude each monk wrote one verse.
Despite the Naladiyar’s sectarian origin,
it has become the cultural property of
Tamils from all religious communities;
many of the verses have come into the
language as proverbial sayings.
Nalayira Divyaprabandham
(“The
Four
Thousand
Divine
Compositions”) Title for the collected
Namakarana samskara being performed on an
infant, who in this photo is wrapped in cloth for
protection from the evil eye.
hymns of the Alvars, compiled in the
tenth century by Nathamuni. The Alvars
were a group of twelve poet-saints who
lived in southern India between the sev-
enth and tenth centuries. All the Alvars
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu and emphasized passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language. Their collected hymns
were popularly known as the “Tamil
Veda.” They carry Vedic authority for
many southern Indian Vaishnavas, par-
ticularly the Shrivaishnava school,
which applied more developed philo-
sophical articulation to these devotional
ideas. See also Veda.
Namakarana
(“name-giving”) Samskara
The fifth of the traditional life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), during which
the newborn child is given a name.
Although some commentators believe
[[457]]
Namarupa
that this rite should be done on the day
of birth, many others insist that it
should be on the tenth day, indicating
a difference between birth and the
social ritual of name-giving. Some
believe that the child’s name should
begin with the first letter of the
nakshatra (sign in the lunar zodiac) in
which the child is born; this practice is
still widespread in northern India.
Although the classical form of this rite
has largely fallen into disuse, naming
ceremonies are still an important part
of the birth of a child.
Namarupa
Literally, this word means “name [and
physical] form,” two of the most identi-
fiable and enduring aspects of a per-
son. In philosophical discourse, the
term namarupa is often used pejora-
tively to designate all aspects of per-
sonality that are ultimately ephemeral
but help reinforce the illusion of a
diverse world and a Self with an inde-
pendent identity. These notions of
independence are thought to be ulti-
mately false since one’s name and form
will be different in one’s next birth. In
this context, namarupa designates all
that is provisionally real.
Namaskara
(“reverential salutation”) Both a
phrase and a gesture used to greet
another person respectfully. The ges-
ture is done by joining both palms,
pointing the fingers up, with the base
of the thumbs touching the chest.
Namaskara is the fourteenth of sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship,
treating the deity as an honored guest.
In this action, the deity is given a ges-
ture of respect, which can take a vari-
ety of forms: joining the palms with
the fingers pointing upward (anjali
hasta), kneeling and touching one’s
head to the floor, or a full prostration
(dandavat pranam). The underlying
motive for all the upacharas is to show
[[458]]

one’s respect and love for the deity by
ministering to the deity’s needs.
Nambudiri
Southern Indian brahmin communi-
ty, which is a sub-division of the
Dravida brahmins, one of five south-
ern Indian brahmin communities
(Pancha Dravida). The Nambudiris’
traditional homeland is in the region
that is now the modern state of
Kerala. The Nambudiris are noted
throughout India for their learning
and piety. According to tradition, the
great philosopher Shankaracharya
was a Nambudiri brahmin. In his
desire to revitalize Hindu religion,
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one
Hindu sacred center in each corner of
the subcontinent, and at each estab-
lished a Dashanami Sanyasi monas-
tic center (math) to train learned
monks. One of these sacred centers
was at Badrinath in the Himalayas.
According to the Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years the
temple worship was performed by
the Dandi Sanyasis, who were also
Nambudiri brahmins. When the last
of these died without a successor in
[[1776]]
, the local king, who served as the
protector of the shrine, invited a non-
ascetic Nambudiri brahmin to serve
as the temple’s priest. This priest was
given the title rawal (“deputy”), and
his extended family has maintained
the shrine since then. The rawal was
the only person allowed to touch the
image of the presiding deity. As a
consequence he was required to
remain a bachelor, lest the ritual
impurity arising from the birth of a
child (sutakashaucha) render him
unable to attend to his duties. For a
long time the rawals had sole rights to
the offerings given at the shrine, but
since 1939 the temple has been man-
aged by a committee, and the rawal
has been restricted to ritual duties.Nanda Devi
Namdev
(1270–1350?) Poet-saint who is one of
the great figures in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community centered around
the worship of the Hindu god Vithoba,
at his temple in Pandharpur in the
modern
state
of
Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Namdev was a
cotton-printer, considered a low-status
occupation, but the strength of
his devotion rendered his worldly
status irrelevant. He is said to have been
an associate of Jnaneshvar and
Chokamela, two other Varkari poet-
saints. His songs have been preserved in
several different collections, including
the Adigranth (compiled by the Sikh
community) and the Panchvani (a col-
lection of songs by five poets compiled
by the Dadupanth). For traditional
information about his life, see G. A.
Deleury, The Cult of Vithoba, 1960; and
Justin E. Abbott and Narhar R. Godbole
(trans.), Stories of Indian Saints, 1982.
For a more critical look at his Hindu
songs and the difficulties using them as
biographical sources, see Winand
Callewaert and Mukund Lath, The Hindi
Padavali of Namdev, 1989.
Nammalvar
(10th c.) The most prolific composer of all
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. They emphasized passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god, con-
veyed through hymns sung in the Tamil
language, which transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. According to
tradition, Nammalvar was born into a
princely family, but was completely dis-
interested with life in the world. His dis-
traught parents eventually abandoned
him. Nammalvar crawled into the hollow
of a giant tamarind tree, where he sat in
silent meditation. He remained there
until the arrival of his disciple
Mathurakavi, who managed to rouse
him by posing a question on the nature of
the Self. Nammalvar immediately poured
forth more than one thousand hymns to
Vishnu, each beginning with the last
word of the previous hymn. These hymns
are known as the Tiruvaymoli (“holy
words”). This collection of 1,102 stanzas
is the concluding section of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;

the Alvars, 1929; A. Shrinivasa Raghavan,

Nanak Jayanti
Celebration falling on the full moon
in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). This day is
celebrated as the birthday of the
first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, and is
celebrated largely by members of the
Sikh community.
Nanda
In Hindu mythology, the god Krishna’s
foster father, who cares for Krishna as
his own child after Krishna is placed in
his care. Nanda is described as the head-
man of the village. Under his care
Krishna lives a comfortable, if simple,
life. In Krishna’s mythology, Nanda is a
less important figure than Krishna’s fos-
ter mother, Yashoda.
Nanda Devi
Nanda Devi is the name for one of the
tallest mountains in India, rising over
[[25]]
,000 feet, in the Kumaon region of the
Himalayas. Nanda Devi is also a form of
the Goddess who is identified with that
mountain. With Nanda Devi, as for
many of the other goddesses of India,
divinity and the natural landscape are
inextricably connected. Nanda Devi is a
local Himalayan goddess who presides
over the Garhwal and Kumaon regions.
People in the region consider her to be a
“daughter” of the region, who had to
change her residence when she married
the god Shiva. Nanda Devi’s songs and
rites show strong connections with the
[[459]]
Nanddas

Shiva’s vehicle.
life-cycle journeys of Himalayan
women. Songs associated with Nanda
Devi describe the difficulty of going
from her natal home to her marital
home, a reality for many Himalayan
women. In the same way, Nanda Devi’s
pilgrimages, which emphasize journeys
through the hills surrounding the
mountain, imitate the women’s periodic
journeys back to their own natal villages.
A major part of Nanda Devi’s mythology
is the adoption of an abandoned buffalo
calf, which is later discovered to be a
demon in buffalo form. The buffalo
demon grows large and troublesome,
and is eventually slain by Nanda Devi.
This myth parallels the narrative in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important source for the mythology of
the Goddess; this is the most influential
text used in Nanda Devi’s worship. For
further information on Nanda Devi, her
rites, and her connection with
Himalayan society, see William Sax,
Mountain Goddess, 1991.
[[460]]

(late 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
also named as members of the commu-
nity, and as associates of either the com-
munity’s founder, Vallabhacharya, or
his successor, Vitthalnath. Very little is
known about his life, but he is men-
tioned in the Bhaktamal, a collection of
lives of the saints written by Nabhadas
in the seventeenth century. Like all the
poetry associated with the Pushti Marg,
Nanddas’s poetry focused on devotion
to Krishna. His two most important
works, written in elegant poetry, are
extended poems on the ras lila and
Uddhava’s message. Both of these
themes date back to the Bhagavata
Purana (10th c.?), the most important
text for Krishna devotionalism. These
have been translated by R. S. McGregor,
The Round Dance of Krishna and
Uddhav’s Message, 1973.
Nandi
(“joy,” “delight”) Epithet of the animal
vehicle of the god Shiva, which takes the
form of a bull. Like all of the animal
vehicles, it symbolizes the deity. Nandi
is not only Shiva’s vehicle, but his devo-
tee (bhakta). Statues of Nandi are often
sculpted outside Shiva temples (usually
facing the image) as a way of marking
the site as sacred to Shiva. He appears in
many places in Shiva’s mythology, but
usually as a devoted underling advanc-
ing Shiva’s purposes, rather than an
independent agent with a purpose and
ends of his own.
Nandigrama
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Nandigrama is a vil-
lage outside the city of Ayodhya, where
Prince Bharata sets up the royal courtNarasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar
during his brother Rama’s absence.
Bharata’s mother Kaikeyi uses her influ-
ence to banish Rama for fourteen years,
putting Bharata on the throne in his
place. At Rama’s command, Bharata
agrees to act as the temporary king, but
with two symbolic adjustments. The first
is that Bharata moves the royal court
from the capital city of Ayodhya to the
village of Nandigrama, as a symbol of
Rama’s exile; the second is that through-
out his regency, Bharata sits at the foot
of the royal throne, upon which is
placed a pair of Rama’s sandals, symbol-
izing that Rama is the rightful ruler.
Thus, Nandigrama is a symbol of
Bharata’s righteousness.
Narada
A famous sage in Hindu mythology,
equally renowned for his qualities as a
musician and as a gossip. Narada plays a
stringed instrument known as the vina,
serving as the bard to the gods. His
ambition as a musician apparently
exceeds his actual skill, since several of
his mythic stories describe him being
humbled. In his capacity as wandering
musician, he also conveys news and
gossip. In many cases Narada’s news-
bearing is the vehicle advancing the plot
in a story. According to one famous
story, he requests that Vishnu give a
demonstration of his magic (maya).
Vishnu sends him to a nearby farm-
house for some water, where Narada
meets an enchantingly beautiful
woman. Forgetting all about his errand,
the two fall in love, are married, and have
several children. After several years of
wedded bliss, severe floods wash away
his home and drown his family. As he
mourns his loss, he finds himself back
on the side of road with Vishnu, who is
still asking him to go to the farmhouse to
get some water.
Narada Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed impor-
tant, but less authoritative than the
other textual category, the shrutis or
“heard” texts. This smrti is ascribed to
the sage Narada, and is an example of
one of the Dharma Shastras, which
were manuals prescribing rules for cor-
rect human behavior and ideal social
life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras, which
are ascribed to recognizable individuals,
the Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, a strategy used
to reinforce the authority of these texts.
The Narada Smrti exists in several ver-
sions, one of which is much longer than
the others. All of the versions were writ-
ten later than the Manu Smrti (1st c.
B.C.E.?), since this text is mentioned in
the preface. Narada’s text deals exclu-
sively with the administration of justice
(vyavahara), and treats this in exhaus-
tive detail, with a strong emphasis on
clarity and precision.
Narak Chaturdashi
Religious observance falling on the four-
teenth day (chaturdashi) of the dark,
waning half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). People
who observe this day worship and make
offerings to the god Yama. In the
evening they light a lamp in his name.
Yama is the lord of the underworld and
the judge of the dead; he reviews the
deeds of the dead and inflicts punish-
ment upon people for their misdeeds.
Those who faithfully observe Narak
Chaturdashi are believed to be spared
from the torments of hell.
Nara-Narayana
In Hindu mythology, two of the sons of
the god Dharma; through their ascetic
practices (tapas) these two boys became
sages. The place where they performed
their asceticism is believed to have been
in the region of Badrinath. The duo are
still associated with the charter myths
for that place.
Narasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar
Fourth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu, in which he appears as a figure
[[461]]
Narasimha Jayanti
with the head and shoulders of a lion,
but the torso and lower body of a man.
As with all of Vishnu’s avatars, this
appearance comes at a moment when
the cosmos is in crisis, and decisive
divine action is needed to restore cos-
mic equilibrium. See Man-Lion avatar.
Narasimha Jayanti
Religious observance falling on the four-
teenth day of the bright, waxing half
of the lunar month of Baisakh
(April–May). This day is celebrated as
the birthday of Vishnu’s fourth avatar,
Narasimha, although his birthday is
different from those of Vishnu’s human
avatars. Narasimha is not human, but a
creature with the head and shoulders of
a lion, and the torso and lower body of
a man. He is not born in the usual
sense, but bursts forth fully formed
from a pillar, to destroy the demon
Hiranyakashipu and to protect his
devotee (bhakta) Prahlada. See also
Man-Lion avatar.
Narasimhavarman I
(r. 630–668) Pallava dynasty ruler
during its most vibrant era, when it
was a stronghold of Tamil culture.
Narasimhavarman succeeded his father
Mahendravarman, who had been killed
in a battle with the forces of
the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II.
Narasimhavarman avenged his father’s
death by conquering the Chalukya king-
dom and killing Pulakeshin II in battle,
but the two kingdoms were so evenly
matched that neither could retain con-
trol over the other. Like his father,
Narasimhavarman was a great patron of
the arts. It was during his reign that con-
struction commenced on the great
sculptures at Mahabalipuram in the
state of Tamil Nadu. The most famous of
these is a rock-cut sculpture depicting
the myth of the Descent of the Ganges,
in which a natural vertical fissure is used
to lay out the river’s path.
[[462]]

Narasimhavarman II
(r. 700–728) Pallava dynasty ruler dur-
ing the dynasty’s most vibrant era, when
it was a stronghold of Tamil culture. Like
all the great Pallava monarchs,
Narasimhavarman II was a great patron
of the arts. During his reign there was
continued construction of the monu-
ments at Mahabalipuram in the state of
Tamil Nadu.
Narayana
Epithet of the god Vishnu. The name is
traditionally interpreted as meaning
“resting on the waters,” based on the
claim that the word nara, which usually
means “man,” in this case means
“waters.” Narayana is the image of
Vishnu in the time of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). He is reclining on his serpent
couch, Shesha, in the midst of the cos-
mic sea, with his wife, Lakshmi, seated
at his feet, and his vehicle, Garuda,
standing by. Vishnu is the sole remain-
ing agent in the cosmos, as its beginning
and end. When the time for a new cre-
ation arrives, a lotus sprouts forth from
Narayana’s navel, which opens to reveal
the creator-god Brahma. The cycle of
creation begins anew.
Narayana Bhatta
(1513–1570?) The most celebrated schol-
ar and commentator on the dharma lit-
erature of his time, and the patriarch of
a scholarly family. Narayana’s father had
migrated from the city of Paithan, in
central India, to Benares, a center of
Sanskrit learning. Narayana’s work fell
mainly in the class of commentarial lit-
erature known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”), which were compilations of
Hindu lore. Nibandha compilers collect-
ed references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts, and then compiled these
excerpts into a single volume. Aside
from his unparalleled command of
these traditional texts, Narayana was
also noted for his learned interpretationNasik Mela
and commentary; to these texts, he
applied the rules that the Purva
Mimamsa philosophical school had
originally developed to interpret the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
According to tradition, he was a man
whose personal holiness was equal to
his great learning. He is reported to have
performed a miracle by causing rain to
fall out of season, convincing the
Muslim officials ruling Benares to allow
the Vishvanath temple to be rebuilt.
Narmada River
Central Indian river that has its source at
the sacred site (tirtha) of Amarkantak
in the state of Madhya Pradesh, and
flows almost directly west through the
state of Gujarat, then to the Arabian Sea.
The Narmada is one of the few central
Indian rivers flowing from east to west;
rivers further south are channeled east
by the upthrust of the highlands known
as the Western Ghats. It is traditionally
considered one of the seven sacred
rivers of India, along with the Ganges,
Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Indus,
and Cauvery. An important site on the
Narmada is Omkareshvar, one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a network of sites
sacred to the god Shiva. During the
[[1990]]
s the Narmada has become a rally-
ing point for environmentalists who
have opposed construction of several
massive dams, on the grounds that
these dams have displaced too many
people and destroyed too much prime
farmland. Although work on these dams
has continued, the pace has slowed. In
[[1997]]
 a minor earthquake in the
Narmada basin prompted the call for
further consideration of this project’s
environmental dangers.
Narsi Mehta
(16th c.) Gujarati poet-saint who was a
well-known figure in northern Indian
devotional life. Narsi was a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna. His poetry
describes the love affair between
Krishna and his consort Radha.
According to tradition, Narsi’s poetry
was rooted in a vision of Krishna’s ras
lila, or great circle dance, in which Narsi
was privileged to stand as attendant
holding a torch to light the lila. Narsi is
one of the devotees profiled in the
Bhaktamal, a text that gives short bio-
graphical profiles of more than 200
devotional (bhakti) saints; in the text
Narsi is portrayed as a paradigm of gen-
erosity, an earthly imitation of Krishna
himself. For further information see

Saints,” in John Stratton Hawley (ed.),
Saints and Virtues, 1987.
Nasik
City and sacred site (tirtha) near the
headwaters of the Godavari River in the
state of Maharashtra, about 100 miles
northeast of Bombay. Nasik is one of the
four sites for the Kumbha Mela, a reli-
gious bathing (snana) festival. Nasik
hosts this festival every twelve years.
Nasik is an important bathing place and
is a center of pilgrimage, piety, and
learning. According to tradition the god-
king Rama, his wife, Sita, and his brother,
Lakshmana lived during much of their
twelve years in exile in the nearby village
of Panchavati. Rama, Sita, and
Lakshmana are central characters in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. Although claims of them
living near Nasik are impossible to prove
or disprove, the legend adds one more
layer of sanctity to the site.
Nasik Mela
The Nasik Mela is the celebration of the
Kumbha Mela at Nasik. The Kumbha
Mela is a religious festival celebrated in
four different locations: Haridwar,
Allahabad, Ujjain, and Nasik. The festi-
val’s focus is bathing (snana) in the
sacred rivers during particularly holy
moments. The Kumbha Mela’s primary
participants are ascetics, who come
from all over southern Asia to bathe
in the sacred waters. According to
[[463]]
Nastika
tradition, the Kumbha Mela was organized
by the great philosopher Shankaracharya
to promote regular gatherings of learned
and holy men, as a means to strengthen,
sustain, and spread the Hindu religion.
The timing for each of these festivals is
determined by the position of the sun
and the planet Jupiter; the twelve years
between these festivals correspond to
Jupiter’s orbit. The Nasik Mela is cele-
brated during the lunar month of
Shravan (July–August), when the planet
Jupiter is in the sign of Leo. This is the
least important of all four Kumbha
Melas, attended mostly by ascetics.
Nastika
(“nihilists”) In Hindu philosophical dis-
course, this was a pejorative term to
denigrate certain other religious and
philosophical schools. The name
Nastika was applied to groups who
denied the three most basic principles
of religion: the authority of the Vedas as
religious texts, the eternal existence of
the soul (atman), and the value of reli-
gious life in general. In context this term
could be applied to the Jains (who
denied the first of these three) to the
Buddhists (who denied the first and the
second) or to the materialist philosoph-
ical school (which denied all three).
Natal Horoscope
In Indian culture, a person’s natal horo-
scope or janampatrika (“birth-paper”) is
believed to reveal a great deal about a
person. One’s previous karma is thought
to determine the moment when one is
born. Thus, a natal horoscope provides a
karmic “itinerary,” indicating where one
has been and what he or she might
expect in the future. Natal horoscopes
still play a role in decision-making, par-
ticularly in arranging marriages. Natal
horoscopes are exchanged before fixing
an engagement in order to determine
the couple’s compatibility. Sometimes
this process takes place merely because
the claim that the horoscopes are
incompatible can provide an acceptable
[[464]]

excuse to refuse an inappropriate
or unacceptable match. Natal horo-
scopes are believed to reveal important
things about a person’s future. A person
whose horoscope indicates an early
death—or the early death of a spouse—
may find it difficult to marry unless he
or she performs certain rituals to
remove these problems.
Natamandira
In the temple architecture of Orissa,
one of the major forms of the northern
Indian Nagara style. The natamandira is
the section of the temple found between
the bhogamandapa (“food-pavilion”)
and the jagamohan, or entrance hall
leading to the main image. Natamandira
literally means “dance-house.” In many
Orissan temples the natamandira was
used for performance, in particular for
the Orissi dance style that was devel-
oped and sustained in these temples.
The performances were partly for the
aesthetic appreciation of the spectators,
but mainly as an offering of entertain-
ment to the deity himself. Although
dances are still performed at the nata-
mandiras as a part of worship, they are
primarily staged for entertainment.
Nataraja
Form of the god Shiva as the “Lord of
the Dance.” The most famous Nataraja
image is in the temple-town of
Chidambaram in the state of
Tamil Nadu. The temple was erected
during the reign of Vira Raja (927–997
C.E.), with Nataraja as its primary deity.
However, the image of Nataraja is well
known, particularly from the southern
Indian bronzes of the Chola dynasty
(9th–13th c).
As a divinity, one of Shiva’s most
important characteristics is that he tran-
scends all duality; the Nataraja image
symbolizes this concept. Shiva dances
within a circle of fire, symbolizing birth
and death, but remains untouched by
these forces. As Shiva dances, his matted
locks swing wildly, showing the force ofNataraja
The god Shiva, in the form of Nataraja (the “Lord of the Dance”),

his activity, yet his face stays impassive
and unmoved. One of his four hands
holds the drum that beats the rhythm of
creation, while a second hand holds the
fire of destruction. His third hand is held
palm upward in a gesture meaning “fear
not.” The fourth points to his upraised
foot, the symbol of refuge and divine
mercy for the devotee (bhakta). His
other foot crushes a demon, displaying
his power to destroy the wicked. The
image is a well-developed theological
statement, able to be “read” by those
who can interpret it.
In Nataraja’s charter myth, Shiva and
Kali, the goddess, decide to settle their
[[465]]
Nath
competition with a dance contest. Shiva
finally bests Kali by manifesting as
Nataraja and doing an athletic
(tandava) dance style that Kali’s femi-
nine modesty prevents her from copy-
ing. Mythic roots aside, the Nataraja
temple at Chidambaram has been an
important center for classical Indian
dance for well over a thousand years.
The temple’s eastern wall bears relief
carvings of the 108 basic dance posi-
tions (karanas). These positions are
central to classical Indian dance, partic-
ularly in the Bharatanatyam school,
which is the major dance tradition in
Tamil Nadu.
Nath
(“lord”) Epithet of the god Shiva, based
on his power as the ultimate lord.
Among the Nathpanthis, a renunciant
ascetic community whose members are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, “Nath” is
added to the end of one’s name after
final ascetic initiation as a symbol of
membership. This practice apparently
dates from the Nathpanthis’ earliest
days, since according to tradition they
were founded by the sage Gorakhnath.
Nathamuni
(10th c.) Compiler of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars that are popularly known
as the “Tamil Veda.” Nathamuni is also
a pivotal figure in the later develop-
ment of the Shrivaishnava religious
community, in which the passionate
devotion in the Alvar hymns found
more systematic philosophical articula-
tion. According to tradition, Nathamuni’s
grandson was Yamunacharya, the
teacher of Ramanuja, the greatest
Shrivaishnava figure. See also Veda.
Nathdwara
City and sacred site (tirtha) about twenty-
five miles north of the city of Udaipur in
the south-central region of the state of
Rajasthan. Nathdwara has a temple
housing an image of the god Krishna in
[[466]]

his form as Shrinathji. According to tra-
dition, the image was originally hidden
on the top of Mount Govardhan, a
mountain in the Braj region where
Krishna is said to have lived. The loca-
tion of the image was revealed in a
dream to Vallabhacharya, the founder
of the religious community known as
the Pushti Marg. Vallabhacharya built
a temple to house it on Mount
Govardhan, and his descendants have
remained the image’s hereditary ser-
vants since that time. The image was
moved to the state of Rajasthan in 1669,
prompted by fears that it would be
destroyed by the Moghul emperor
Aurangzeb. According to tradition
Shrinathji revealed his wish to stay in
Nathdwara by sinking his wagon’s
wheels deep into the earth, so that
it could not go further. Nathdwara is a
fairly remote location, making it a safe
place to keep the image. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Nathpanthi
Renunciant ascetic community founded
by the sage Gorakhnath. The
Nathpanthis are also known by many
names: as jogis (from their emphasis on
the practice of yoga), Gorakhnathis
(from the name of their founder),
Kanphatas (meaning “split-ear” by
virtue of the signature earrings placed in
the split cartilage of both ears), Gosains
(“master of the senses”), and simply as
Naths (“lord”) from the characteristic
suffix taken as part of their names upon
ascetic initiation. The Nathpanthis are a
very old organization and have a long
tradition in northern India, but their
historical record is relatively faint. The
organization has no single organizing
body; their emphasis on yoga has meant
that their practice has been internalized,
rather than focused on temples or other
material
objects.
Although
the
Nathpanthis are usually described as
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, they are dis-
tinct from the Shaiva Sanyasis.
The spiritual practice of the Naths
has traditionally focused on the masteryNavadurga
of the subtle body as the means to final
liberation of the soul. The Naths believe
that liberation is physical immortality,
rather than escape from the cycle of
transmigration, which is more com-
monly accepted. The subtle body is an
alternate physiological system, believed
to exist on a different plane than gross
matter, but corresponding to the mater-
ial body. It is visualized as a set of six
psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the spine; above and
below these centers reside two divine
principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power). The aspirant aims to
join these two principles at the crown
of the head, thus transforming the
perishable elements in the gross body
into immortality.
Among the Nathpanthis, the domi-
nant metaphor for talking about this
process is the union of sun and moon.
The sun, identified with Shakti, stands
for the processes of change and destruc-
tion, whereas the moon, identified with
Shiva, symbolizes stability and immor-
tality. In some cases this union of sun
and moon is described in very abstract
terms; for example, in the definition of
hatha yoga “ha” refers to the sun and
“tha” refers to the moon. Other abstract
descriptions of this process speak of
gaining equilibrium of the vital winds
(prana), or yogic union in the subtle
body. In other cases this union is sym-
bolized in concrete ways, as in the prac-
tice of vajroli mudra. This sexual
practice uses urethral suction or the
“fountain-pen technique,” by which a
man, having ejaculated into his female
partner, draws his semen back into his
body. The semen has been refined
through contact with the woman’s uter-
ine blood.
The Nathpanthis have been impor-
tant both as an ascetic community in
their own right, and as an influence on
many of the northern Indian bhakti
poet-saints, particularly Kabir. Their
religious practice has consistently
stressed internal religion, in which
individual realization has been deemed
far more important than performing
social duties or established worship.
The most complete source on
Gorakhnath and his followers is George
Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and the
Kanphata Yogis, 1973.
Natya
The word natya refers to the genre in
classical Indian dance in which the
dancer’s movements convey a story to
the audience. Natya is one of the two
most basic dance genres. The other
genre, nrtya, is “pure” dance, in which
the dance conveys nothing more than
the dancer’s skill.
Natyashastra
Prescriptive manual (shastra) for the per-
forming arts written during the second
century, whose authorship is ascribed to
the mythical sage Bharata. The text is
divided into thirty-seven sections, detail-
ing every aspect of the three major per-
formance forms: music, drama, and
dance (which combines both music and
drama). Some sections of the text are
devoted to aesthetics and poetics, help-
ing to create and convey the correct
atmosphere for the appreciation of the
arts. Other parts of the text discuss con-
crete, practical issues, such as the con-
struction of the stage. The text is still an
authority for these three performing arts,
but it is particularly important for dance.
Many of the positions and gestures found
in Indian dance were first codified in this
text; the Natyashastra remains the ulti-
mate authority for any dance form that
claims to be “classical” dance, rather than
“folk” dance.
Navadurga
(“Nine Durgas”) Collective name for
nine differing forms of Durga, a power-
ful and dangerous form of the Goddess.
One of the “nine Durgas” is worshiped
each of the nine nights during the festi-
val of Navaratri, which usually falls in
October or November. Each goddess has
her own identity, yet at the same time
is a form of Durga. This fluidity is

Navadvip
Worshipers celebrating the Navaratri festival carry an image of the Goddess in the form of Durga.
characteristic of the Goddess; all female
divinities are ultimately seen as
manifestations of some single great
Goddess. The nine Durgas, in the
order in which they are worshiped,
are Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,
Yogmaya, Raktadantika, Shakumbhari
Devi, Durga, Bhramari, and Chandika.
Navadvip
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the Hugli
River, about sixty-five miles north of the
city of Calcutta. Navadvip is traditionally
regarded as the birthplace of the Bengali
saint Chaitanya (1486–1533), although
in the twentieth century, the same claim
[[468]]

has been made for the city of Mayapur,
on the other side of the river. For
extensive information about Navadvip,
see E. Alan Morinis, Pilgrimage in the
Hindu Tradition, 1984.
Navaratri
(“nine nights”) Festival dedicated to the
Goddess celebrated twice during the
year. The spring Navaratri occurs during
the bright, waxing half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April), and
the fall Navaratri falls during the bright
half of the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). Each Navaratri
celebration lasts for the first nine nightsNavyanyaya
of these lunar months and concludes
with a festival dedicated to the god
Rama: Ram Navami in Chaitra and
Dussehra in Ashvin. Of the two, the fall
Navaratri is far more important. The fall
Navaratri is celebrated with fervor in the
Bengal region, where the Goddess is the
dominant regional deity. The Bengali
Navaratri is characterized by large pro-
cessions featuring elaborately decorated
clay images of the Goddess. These
images are commissioned by individu-
als, businesses, trade unions, and neigh-
borhood associations. Having the best
image is a sign of great status. During
the weeks around Navaratri, Bengali
children get a holiday from school, state
workers get paid vacation from their
jobs, and the electricity supply
in Calcutta runs without interruptions—
a phenomenon dubbed the Navaratri
“miracle,” since during the rest of
the year shortages and blackouts
are common.
These Navaratri festivals are per-
formed to gain the favor of the Mother
Goddess, particularly in her powerful
forms such as Durga. During these nine
nights devotees (bhakta) perform a vari-
ety of different rites. Some fast
(upavasa) and worship in their homes,
often consecrating temporary images of
the Goddess for use during this festival.
Devotees may also worship young girls
as manifestations of the Goddess, or
sponsor readings of the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important text for
the mythology of the Goddess. They may
also worship the Goddess in her form as
Navadurga, paying homage to a differ-
ent form on each of the nine nights.
Another common practice is to har-
vest shoots of barley, which are some-
times worn on the final day of the
festival. This practice hints at the festi-
val’s purpose since, among other things,
the Goddess represents the female
power of fertility and procreation. In
northern India, the spring festival
comes before the crops are planted.
Wearing sprouting grain is an attempt to
please the Goddess so the crop may
flourish. The fall Navaratri comes after
the harvest, when this promise of
fruition has been fulfilled, and is seen as
a time of thanksgiving for blessings
received. The Goddess also represents
the triumph of good over evil; the read-
ings of the Devimahatmya on these
occasions remind the listeners of the
Goddess’ wondrous deeds and assure
them of her continued protection.
Navyanyaya
(“new Nyaya”) A later branch of the
Nyaya philosophical school. The Nyaya
school was one of the six schools in tra-
ditional Hindu philosophy, which flour-
ished in the early centuries of the first
millennium, but then lost its influence.
The Navyanyaya school developed in
late medieval times (15th–17th c.), in an
attempt to reinvigorate the school and
to resolve some of the problems with the
earlier Nyaya notion of inherence
(samavaya). The earlier Nyayas per-
ceived inherence as a weak relational
force that connected objects and their
qualities—for example, connecting the
color red with a particular ball and thus
making the ball red. It also connected
material objects—the force that held a
clay pot together once the two halves
had been pressed against each other.
Finally, inherence connected selves and
their qualities—one became happy
when inherence connected happiness
to one’s self, and unhappy when unhap-
piness was connected.
This notion of inherence explained
many things in the perceivable world.
However, objections were raised against
the Nyayas’ insistence that inherence
was a single, universal property at work
in different places. According to this
criticism, a universal and eternal inher-
ence could link an object with any
property, including ones that contra-
dict—the color brown with the moon or
the appearance of a cow with a dog.
Other attacks questioned whether
inherence continued to exist after one of
the things it had been connecting was
destroyed. If it did not, opponents
claimed, then inherence was clearly
[[469]]
Nayachandra Suri
nothing to begin with, whereas if it did,
then the remaining connecting power
would exist unconnected to anything,
which was clearly absurd. Finally, some
attacked the need for inherence at all—
which was cited as an example of “need-
less complexity” (gaurava).
The Navyanyaya school attempted to
sidestep these problems by positing a
new class of relationship, that of “self-
linking connectors.” These connectors
were seen as an integral part of all
things, by their very nature, and since
they were self-linking, this eliminated
the need for a separate inherence to
connect things together. In this under-
standing, the relationship and the related
objects are one and the same. This
notion allowed the Navyanyayas to
retain their fundamental assumptions
that there are real objects in the world
and they are connected to one another.

Nayachandra Suri
(14th c.) The author of the Hammira-
mahakavya, a Sanskrit drama that
chronicles the defeat and death of the
Rajput king Hammira by the Delhi sul-
tan Alauddin Khilji in 1301. Aside from
its historical value, this play is notable
because Nayachandra Suri was a Jain
monk. Although Jain monks are subject
to a strict religious lifestyle that would
seem to cut them off from the world,
they have a long history of deep involve-
ment with intellectual and literary cul-
ture. See also mahakavya.
Nayak Dynasty
Southern Indian dynasty whose capital
was in the city of Madurai in the state of
Tamil Nadu. The Nayaks came to power
in the political vacuum created by the
destruction of the Vijayanagar dynasty
late in the sixteenth century. The Nayaks
ruled the southernmost part of the sub-
continent for about the next hundred
[[470]]

years. The dynasty’s greatest ruler was
Tirumalai Nayak (r. 1623–1659), who
constructed large sections of the
Minakshi temple, dedicated to
Madurai’s patron goddess, Minakshi.
Nayanar
Group of sixty-three Shaiva poet-saints,
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and ninth centuries. In concert
with their Vaishnava counterparts the
Alvars, the Nayanars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion vis-à-vis
the Buddhists and the Jains. Both the
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god—Shiva for the Nayanars, Vishnu for
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage. The Nayanars tended to be more
overtly hostile to the Jains. According to
legend the Nayanar Sambandar was
instrumental in the impalement of
eight thousand Jain monks in the city
of Madurai. The hymns of the three
most important Nayanars—Appar,
Sambandar, and Sundaramurtti—com-
prise the Devaram, the most sacred of
the Tamil Shaivite texts. An important
later source is the Periya Puranam by
Cekkilar, which gives hagiographic
accounts for all the Nayanars.
Nayar
The Nayars are a Hindu jati who tradi-
tionally were the primary landholding
community in traditional Kerala. Jatis
are endogamous subgroups of tradi-
tional Indian society whose social status
is determined by the group’s hereditary
occupation. The Nayars were one of the
few groups in India to practice matrilin-
ear succession, in which both descent
and inheritance were passed on
through the mother’s line.
Nazar
(“glance”) The literal meaning of the
word nazar is an unobstructed line of
sight to a person or a thing. The word
nazar is also the term most commonlyNibandha
used to denote the “evil eye,” a malefic
influence that is put on people
through sight, particularly eye-to-eye
contact. The existence of the evil eye is
widely accepted among traditional
Hindus. It is warded off either by
avoiding this sort of gaze, or by per-
forming rites of protection. For fur-
ther consideration see David F.
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan
(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Nepal
A small Himalayan nation on the north-
ern border of India that is deemed the
world’s only Hindu kingdom. One basis
for this claim is that almost 90 percent of
Nepal’s inhabitants identify themselves
as Hindu; the other is that since 1769
Nepal’s ruling house has been a Hindu
dynasty, the Shah dynasty. The present
monarch, Birendra Bir Bikram Shah (b.
[[1945]]
), was an uncontested absolute
monarch until April 1990, when popular
discontent led to a movement seeking
the restoration of democracy in Nepal.
The king was forced to accede to demo-
cratic reforms, and since May 1991 has
governed as a constitutional monarch,
with the Nepali Parliament wielding the
real power.
Although Nepal is a small country, it
has great geographical diversity. Its three
major geographical regions are the sub-
montane lowlands, the Himalayan
foothills, and the high mountains. The
country’s uneven topography further
subdivides each of these regions. This
rugged geography has a marked effect
on the country’s economy, rendering
agriculture impossible at anything more
than a subsistence level. However, it
provides the attraction for tourism,
which is Nepal’s greatest source of for-
eign exchange.
Such great geographical diversity
promotes similar human diversity. The
people of Nepal are an amalgam of
many different groups, including people
whose historical roots lie in India and
indigenous hill tribes associated with
particular parts of the country. Most
Nepalese live in the fertile valleys of the
foothills. These are the most habitable
regions, as the climate in the mountains
is far too harsh for permanent habita-
tion, while the lowland regions are
rife with disease, particularly malaria.
In general, Nepali culture shows
many similarities with the adjoining
areas of India, and thus from a cultural
perspective is firmly fixed in the Indian
cultural orbit. Nepal is also the home to
several important Hindu pilgrimage
places (tirtha), notably Pashupatinath
in the Kathmandu Valley, and
Muktinath, at the headwaters of the Kali
Gandaki River.
New Moon
(amavasya) In northern India, the new
moon usually marks the midpoint of the
lunar month, whereas in southern India
it often identifies the end. Unlike the full
moon, whose associations with fullness
and completion make it always auspi-
cious, the new moon’s associations with
darkness and emptiness make it a more
ambiguous time. One of the most
important festivals in the Hindu reli-
gious year, Diwali, falls on the new
moon in Kartik (October–November).
The new moon can also be highly auspi-
cious on certain other occasions, such
as a Somavati Amavasya, a new moon
falling on a Monday. In general, however,
the new moon is less clearly auspicious
than the full moon. Not only are there
fewer celebrations during the new
moon, but there is also a proportionately
greater number of holidays falling in the
light, waxing half of the lunar month.
The new moon and the dark, waning
half are not in themselves inauspicious,
they are simply deemed less auspicious
than the light half and the full moon.
Nibandha
(“collection”) Genre of thematic com-
mentarial literature that became promi-
nent in medieval northern India. The
nibandhas were compendia of Hindu
lore, in which the compilers culled
[[471]]
Nigantha Nataputta

excerpts on a particular theme from the
Vedas, dharma literature, puranas, and
other authoritative religious texts, and
then compiled them into a single orga-
nized text. Excerpts from these same
authoritative texts on a different theme
would be compiled into a different vol-
ume, and so on. The compilers would
often have to reconcile conflicting texts,
or judge which passage was preferable
to another. Such judgments were gener-
ally done using rules for textual inter-
pretation developed by the Purva
Mimamsa philosophical school, one of
the six schools of traditional Hindu phi-
losophy. The Purva Mimamsa school
had originally developed these rules for
interpreting the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.
In many cases the nibandhas had
between fifteen and twenty volumes,
attempting to provide an exhaustive
investigation of Hindu religious life.
Among the most influential nibandhas
are the Kalpataru, compiled by
Lakshmidhara in twelfth century, and
the Viramitrodaya, compiled by Mitra
Mishra early in the seventeenth century.
[[472]]

Nigantha Nataputta
In early Indian philosophy, a figure
whose views are mentioned in the
Buddhist scriptures. Nigantha advocated
a four-fold self-restraint, although these
sources give no further indication of
his doctrines. It is generally accepted
that Nigantha was the same person
as Mahavira. Mahavira is believed to
have been the last of the Jain
tirthankaras, the founding figures in the
Jain religious tradition.
Night, Goddess of
In the Vedas, the earliest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts, the
gods and goddesses are associated with
phenomena in the natural world. In the
Vedas the goddess Ratri (Night) is men-
tioned both as a goddess and as the
night itself. At times she is seen as life-
giving, allowing people the opportunity
to refresh and renew themselves. At
other times she is associated with the
dangers of the night, such as wild ani-
mals and thieves. Ratri is considered a
sister to Ushas, the dawn. As night and
day alternate, the two goddesses markNimbarki
out the regular passage of time that
characterizes the cosmic order (rta). For
further information on Night and all the
goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.

Nilachal Hill
Sacred site (tirtha) overlooking the
Brahmaputra River, about six miles out-
side the city of Guwahati in the modern
state of Assam. Nilachal Hill is known
for its temple to the goddess Kamakhya,
one of the most powerful goddess tem-
ples in India. This site is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites sacred
to the Goddess which spreads through-
out the subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess.
The Kamakhya temple is where Sati’s
vulva is said to have fallen to earth; the
image of the goddess is a natural cleft in
the rock around which the temple has
been built. Since Kamakhya sprang from
the most sexually charged part of the
female body, the site is extremely power-
ful. See also pitha.
Nilakanth
(“blue-throated”) Epithet of the god
Shiva; also the name of a manifestation
of Shiva who is enshrined at the
Nilakanth Mahadev temple outside the
city of Rishikesh in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Shiva is present at Nilakanth in
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form. The
mythic charter for this epithet (and for
the establishment of the temple as well)
is drawn from the tale of Churning the
Ocean of Milk. The gods and demons
churn the ocean to produce amrta, the
nectar of immortality thought to be the
finest essence of the ocean. Yet their
action produces not only the amrta, but
also its antithesis, the halahala poison.
This is an event of great peril; the poison
is so powerful that if left unchecked, it
can destroy the earth. When this poison
appears, the gods and demons are
unable to figure out a way to contain it.
Shiva takes care of the poison by holding
it in his throat, but the force of the poi-
son is so great that it turns his throat
blue. See also Tortoise avatar and

Nilgiri Hills
Range of hills formed by the conjunc-
tion of the Western and Eastern Ghats,
located at the junction of three southern
Indian states—Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and
Karnataka. In earlier times the hills
were occupied by a tribal people known
as the Todas, although only a few thou-
sand Todas are left today. This region is
important for its hill stations, such as
Ootacamund and Kodaikanal, which are
popular spots for vacations, honey-
moons, and movie filming.
Nimbarka
(12th c.?) Ascetic, philosopher, devotee
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and attrib-
uted as the founder of the Sanaka
Sampraday, one of the four Vaishnava
ascetic orders. According to tradition,
Nimbarka was a Telegu (southern
Indian) brahmin who was born in the
city of Paithan in central India, but lived
much of his life in the northern Indian
Braj region, where the god Krishna is
supposed to have lived. Nimbarka’s
philosophical position is described as
dualism-nondualism (dvaitadvaita), a
concept in which God and human
beings are both identical and different.
While earlier Vaishnavas worshiped
Vishnu and Lakshmi as the divine
couple, Nimbarka used the same
concept, but changed the focus to
Krishna and Radha.
Nimbarki
Name for the religious group founded by
the Vaishnava figure Nimbarka. It is
also used as a variant name for the
Sanaka Sampraday, an ascetic commu-
nity that traces its spiritual lineage to
Nimbarka, as a way to reinforce their
religious authority.

Nirakara
Nirakara
(“without form”) Epithet of the divine
reality in its ultimate aspect. According
to many Hindu traditions, God is ulti-
mately without form, transcending all
particularity and superior to any partic-
ular image. This belief is first phrased in
the Upanishads, the speculative reli-
gious texts that are the most recent part
of the Vedas, and is advocated by the
philosophical traditions based on the
Upanishads, such as Advaita Vedanta.
This concept is opposed by certain
Hindu theistic traditions, such as the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
in which a particular deity—in this
case, Krishna—is conceived as the
Ultimate Reality.
Niranjani Akhara
The name of a subgroup of the Naga
class of Dashanami Sanyasis; a particu-
lar type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Sanyasis are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva, organized
into different akharas or regiments on
the model of an army. Until the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century the
Dashanami Sanyasis’ primary occupa-
tion was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these have largely
disappeared in contemporary times.
The Niranjani Akhara is one of the seven
main Dashanami Sanyasi akharas and
along with the Mahanirvani Akhara is
one of the most powerful. This power is
clearly shown by their respective posi-
tions in the bathing (snana) processions
at the Kumbha Mela festivals: in
Haridwar the Niranjani Akhara goes
first, followed by the Mahanirvani; at
Allahabad the order is reversed. In 1962
the Juna Akhara acquired the status of a
separate procession, rather than as a
subsidiary of the Niranjani Akhara.
According to the terms of the 1962
agreement, at Haridwar the Juna Akhara
would lead the Sanyasi processions for
the bathing on the festival of Shivaratri,
followed by the Niranjani and
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjanis
[[474]]

would be first for the other two major
bathing days, followed by the Juna and
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjani
Akhara’s ability to command the premier
position is based primarily on their local
strength: the Niranjani Akhara was quite
powerful in Haridwar, where it still owns
significant property. The Mahanirvani
Akhara, however, was based in
Allahabad. Another sign of the Niranjani
Akhara’s status is that it has as a sub-
sidiary group, the Ananda Akhara.
All of the akharas have particular fea-
tures that define their organizational
identity, especially specific tutelary
deities. The Niranjani Akhara’s tutelary
deity is Skanda, the son of the deities
Shiva and Parvati, and the celestial gen-
eral commanding Shiva’s supernatural
army. Aside from serving as an identify-
ing marker, the choice of a celestial war-
rior reflects the akhara’s influence and
former military strength.
Nirguna
(“without qualities”) Epithet of the
divine reality in its ultimate aspect.
According to many Hindu traditions,
God is ultimately without qualities or
attributes, transcending all particularity
and superior to any qualified form. This
conception is first phrased in the
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that are the most recent part of the
Vedas, and in the philosophical tradi-
tions based on the Upanishads such as
Advaita Vedanta. This belief is opposed
by certain Hindu theistic traditions,
such as the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious
community, in which a particular
deity—in this case, Krishna—is con-
ceived as the Ultimate Reality.
Nirikari
Minor Vaishnava sect founded in the late
[[1700]]
s, by a Ramanandi ascetic named
Baba Sarjudasa. The name comes from
their greeting, Sat Nirikara (“Truth Is
Formless”). Their major areas of influence
and operation are in Punjab, Haryana,
and northwestern Uttar Pradesh.Nirmala Devi
At the Kumbha Mela festival in Haridwar the Niranjani Akhara proceeds first, followed by the Mahanirvani.
Nirjala EkadashiNirmala
Religious observance on the eleventh
day (ekadashi) in the bright, waxing half
of the lunar month of Jyeshth (May–
June). As for all the eleventh-day obser-
vances, this is dedicated to the worship
of the god Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals
have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance. The
regulations for this ekadashi are more
strict than all the others. Not only is all
food forbidden, but the person per-
forming this rite must not drink water,
hence the name nirjala meaning
“waterless.” The fast must last from
dawn till dusk. This is no easy task,
since this ekadashi occurs during the
hottest part of the year. The rewards are
great: Those who fulfill the vow for this
single ekadashi receive the religious
merit for all twenty-four ekadashis dur-
ing the year, whether or not they have
done the rites for the others. Carrying
out the vow for this ekadashi is also
believed to bring one a long life and lib-
eration of the soul after death.(“free from defilement”) With the
Udasis, one of the two Hindu ascetic
communities tracing its origins to the
Sikh community. According to one tradi-
tion, the Nirmala sect was established
by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh.
On the whole, the Sikh tradition has not
endorsed asceticism, but rather an
active life in the world. The Nirmalas
have a large ascetic center in the north-
ern Indian sacred city of Haridwar,
where they run a primary school. As a
community, the Nirmalas are known far
more for learning and study than asceti-
cism or yoga. At the Kumbha Melas, the
Nirmalas bathe last of all, after the
Sanyasis, Bairagis, and Udasis.
Nirmala Devi
(b. 1923) Modern Hindu teacher who
claims to be an avatar of the primordial
Goddess, and the founder of Vishva
Nirmala Dharam, an organization dedi-
cated to spreading her message.
Nirmala Devi’s teaching is based on tra-
ditional ideas of hatha yoga and the
subtle body. The subtle body is an
[[475]]
Nirmohi (“free from illusion”) Ani
alternate physiological system, existing
on a different plane than gross matter,
but corresponding to the material body.
It is visualized as a set of six psychic cen-
ters (chakras) running roughly along
the spine; two divine principles, Shiva
(awareness) and Shakti (power), reside
above and below these centers. In prac-
ticing this yoga, the aspirant aims to
awaken the latent spiritual energy of
Shakti known as kundalini, move it into
union with the Shiva principle at the
crown of the head, and transform the
perishable elements in the gross body to
become immortal.
Nirmala Devi claims to be able to
arouse a devotee’s (bhakta) kundalini
through an infusion of her own spiritual
power, thus dramatically speeding up
the path to liberation. Her Indian devo-
tees are mainly middle-class, but she
also claims to have a substantial follow-
ing in Europe, North America, and
Australia. For a skeptical account of an
encounter with Nirmala Devi, see
Sudhir Kakar, “Cooling Breezes,” in
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Nirmohi (“free from illusion”) Ani
Among the Bairagi Nagas, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees of Vishnu, the
Nirmohis are one of the three Naga anis
(“armies”). The others are the Digambaras
and Nirvanis. In earlier times these anis
were actual fighting units who made
their living as traders and mercenary
soldiers, but in modern times they are
mainly important for determining the
order in the bathing processions at the
Kumbha Mela. Of the three Naga anis,
the Digambaras are by far the most
important and take precedence at the
Kumbha Mela.
Nirriti
(“decay, destruction”) In the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative
Hindu religious texts, Nirriti is a god-
dess personifying all the negative
aspects associated with life. Nirriti’s
personality is not well-defined, for she
[[476]]

is rarely mentioned; the hymns men-
tioning her usually express the hope that
she will stay away and allow the speak-
ers to be free from misfortune. For fur-
ther information on Nirriti and all the
goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Nirukta
(“explanation”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the auxiliary branches of
knowledge associated with the use of
the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Nirukta is concerned with the ety-
mological explanations of archaic
words. This was apparently a serious
problem, since almost one-quarter of
the words in the Veda occur only once,
and with the passage of time their pre-
cise meanings became either unclear or
unknown. The most famous nirukta
text—known simply as the Nirukta—
was written by Yaska the grammarian,
in about the fifth century B.C.E. His work
was immeasurably helpful to later read-
ers, but it is clear that even in Yaska’s
time the meanings for many of these
words had become uncertain and
unclear. Aside from nirukta, the other
Vedangas are vyakarana (Sanskrit
grammar), chandas (Sanskrit prosody),
kalpa (ritual instructions), shiksha (cor-
rect pronunciation), and jyotisha (aus-
picious times for sacrifices).
Nirvani (“liberated”) Ani
Among the Bairagi Nagas, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Vishnu, the Nirvanis are one of the three
Naga anis (“armies”). The others are the
Nirmohis and Digambaras. In earlier
times these anis were actual fighting
units who made their living as traders
and mercenary soldiers, but in modern
times they are mainly important for
determining the order at the bathing
(snana) processions at the Kumbha
Mela. Of the three Naga anis, the
Digambaras are the most important and
take precedence at the Kumbha Mela.Nityasamsarin
Nirvikalpaka
In
certain
schools
of
Indian
philosophy—among them certain
Buddhists, the Nyayas, and the
Prabhakara school of Mimamsa—
nirvikalpaka is the name for a sort of
simple non-conceptual awareness, pro-
duced solely by the operation of the
senses. According to these schools, if the
senses producing this awareness have
no defect, such an awareness is believed
to be true. However, it can be confused
or misinterpreted through the action of
the mind. This belief had important
ramifications for theories of error,
which seek to explain how erroneous
judgments are possible. The schools that
believed in this theory attributed error
to the action of the mind.
Nishkramana
(“going-out”) Samskara
The sixth traditional life-cycle ceremony
(samskara), in which the infant is taken
for his or her first trip outside the house.
Although the traditional texts consider
this a minor rite and the traditional tex-
tual procedures are seldom performed,
a young child’s first outing is often still
carefully planned. On a symbolic level, it
represents the child’s first encounter
with the larger world, and thus the
child’s expanding sphere of possibilities.
It also shows the continuing importance
of rites of protection. Even in modern
India many people believe in the power
of the evil eye (nazar), and young
children are considered particularly
susceptible. Thus, a child’s first
encounter with the chaotic outside
world must be carefully structured and
carefully supervised.
Nishumbha
In Hindu mythology the name of a
demon killed by the goddess Kali in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important text for the mythology of the
Goddess. Together with his brother
Shumbha, Nishumbha is one of the
generals in the army of a demon named
Mahishasura. Due to a divine boon
given to Mahishasura, Shumbha and
Nishumbha are able to vanquish the
gods and assume control of heaven.
However, they are devoured by Kali, who
emerges as a manifestation of the
Goddess’s anger.
Niti Shastra
(“instructions on diplomacy”) General
name for a genre of instruction that
taught politically astute behaviors, such
as making friends and allegiances,
intimidating one’s enemies, and know-
ing who can be trusted. This was a rec-
ognized branch of learning in the
traditional Hindu sciences, and was
taught to influential and royal families,
for whom knowing the real workings
of the world was considered essential
to fulfilling their social functions. The
fables of the Panchatantra convey
these hard-edged lessons on self-
interest and caution through the use of
animal characters.
Nitya Karma
(“perpetual [ritual] action”) One of the
three broad types of ritual action, the
others being naimittika karma and
kamya karma. Nitya karma is ritual
action that is prescribed at regular fixed
intervals, often on a daily basis; one
gains no religious merit from perform-
ing them, but omitting them is consid-
ered a religious demerit. One example of
a nitya karma is the Gayatri Mantra,
which must be recited at morning and
evening worship (sandhya) by every
“twice-born” man who has received the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” Another nitya karma
is the Five Great Sacrifices (panchama-
hayajna), which are daily religious
duties for a “twice-born” householder;
they are rarely performed today.
Nityasamsarin
One of the three classes of beings in the
Dvaita Vedanta philosophical school,
founded by the philosopher Madhva
[[477]]
Nivedita, Sister
(1197–1276). Madhva’s fundamental
belief was that God was utterly tran-
scendent, above and beyond the world
and human beings. The strength of this
conviction led him to stress the impor-
tance of grace as the sole means of sal-
vation, since human beings were
unable to save themselves. Given this
dire view of human capacities, Madhva
divided the beings of the world into
three classes: The muktiyogas were
destined for final liberation, the
nityasamsarins were destined for eter-
nal rebirth, and the tamoyogas were
predestined for eternal damnation.
Nivedita, Sister
(b. Margaret Noble, 1867–1911) Irish dis-
ciple of the modern Hindu teacher
Swami Vivekananda. Nivedita devoted
much of her life to the service of the
Ramakrishna Mission, particularly the
education of Indian women. Nivedita
was born in Ireland and taught in
London, where she met Vivekananda.
She accepted him as her spiritual master
(guru) and came to India with him,
where she founded the Nivedita Girls
School in Calcutta. Nivedita was part of
the first generation of Europeans who
came to India searching for answers to
life’s ultimate questions.
Nivrttinath
(1268–1294?) Elder brother of Jnaneshvar,
the first great poet-saint of the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
Nivrttinath is traditionally named as
Jnaneshvar’s religious teacher (guru),
although his younger brother became
more influential. According to tradi-
tion, Nivrttinath’s guru, Gainanath,
was a direct disciple of Gorakhnath,
the celebrated ascetic. This relation-
ship is indicated in the Jnaneshvari, in
which Jnaneshvar describes himself as
a pupil in Gorakhnath’s line. For fur-
ther information see George Weston
[[478]]

Briggs, Gorakhnath and the Kanphata
Yogis, 1973.
Niyama
(“observance”) In the ashtanga yoga
taught by Patanjali, the second of the
eight constituent elements of yoga prac-
tice. While the first element lists five
injurious actions and dispositions to
avoid, Niyama gives five positive
instructions, shifting the focus from
abstinence to active cultivation. The five
observances are: purity, contentment,
asceticism, study, and making the lord
the motive of all action.
Niyati
(“destiny”) Niyati was the central
philosophical assumption for the
Ajivikas, an ancient and extinct philo-
sophical school. The Ajivikas were
fatalists, who believed that niyati inex-
orably predetermined all things.
Human beings can do nothing to influ-
ence destiny, since they can only do
what has been preordained. The
Ajivikas compared the process of rein-
carnation (samsara) to a ball of string,
which would unroll until it was done,
and then go no further. The word niyati
still carries this sense of “fate” or “des-
tiny,” but with one important differ-
ence: While the Ajivikas conceived
niyati as an impersonal and uncontrol-
lable force, in modern times one’s fate
is believed to result from past karma.
Niyoga
(“appointment”) Practice by which a
childless widow could have intercourse
with her dead husband’s brother, or
some other “appointed” male, in order
to bear a son. The child is considered the
son of the dead man and preserves his
lineage. There is significant disagree-
ment about the propriety of this practice
in the dharma literature. Some of these
texts permit it, although hedged with
numerous conditions, but others
unconditionally condemn it. Niyoga is
one of the practices judged to beNudity
The two most basic genres of Indian classical dance are natya and nrtya. This dancer, performing in the
natya genre, uses dance to tell a story. In the nrtya genre the dance conveys only the dancer's skill.
Kalivarjya, or “forbidden in the Kali
[Age].” Kalivarjya, which first appeared in
the twelfth century, was a legal strategy
used to forbid certain religious practices
that were prescribed in the sacred litera-
ture, but were no longer acceptable in
contemporary times.
Nrtya
In classical Indian dance, the word nrtya
refers to the genre of “pure” dance, in
which the dance conveys nothing more
than the dancer’s skill. Nrtya is one of
the two most basic dance genres. The
other genre, natya, is an acting dance, in
which the dancer’s expressions, move-
ments, and gestures convey a story to
the audience.
Nryajana
(“sacrifice to human beings”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
that is prescribed in the dharma litera-
ture, which describes religious duty.
These Five Great Sacrifices are daily reli-
gious observances prescribed for a
twice-born householder. This is a per-
son who has been born into one of the
three twice-born groups in Indian soci-
ety—brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—
and who has received the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” Each of the five sacrifices
(yajna) is directed toward a different
class of beings—from the Ultimate
Reality of Brahman down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions. The
nryajana is directed toward fellow
human beings, and is satisfied by show-
ing hospitality to one’s guests. Although
Hindu religious life has undergone sig-
nificant changes and some of the other
rites have fallen into oblivion, this rite is
still widely practiced; the ethos of hospi-
tality is still very strong in Hindu society.
Nudity
Nudity is often seen as both inauspi-
cious and forbidden, and is subject to
numerous taboos: according to some
authorities, one should not bathe
(snana) naked (a more understandable
taboo in times when people would
bathe outdoors) and one should not be
naked during sexual intercourse. In
some cases there are also taboos on a
husband seeing his wife naked, since it
is widely believed that this will cause
Lakshmi, the goddess, to forsake her,
taking away her auspiciousness as a
[[479]]
Nyasa
married woman. The exception to this
taboo on nudity is that some ascetics
believe nakedness symbolizes the
renunciation of all possessions and
the rejection of all worldly standards,
including shame. Few ascetics renounce
all clothing; some wear a loincloth in
public, rationalizing that one should not
mislead or scandalize ordinary people
who have limited understanding.
Nyasa
(“laying down”) A characteristic ritual
in tantra, a secret religious practice.
In the practice of nyasa, the person
performing the ritual identifies cer-
tain sounds, often in the form of seed
syllables (bijaksharas), with parts of
the human body, deities, and material
objects. This is done to create a series
of identifications between the macro-
cosm of the universe and the micro-
cosm of the body, such that actions in
the microcosmic ritual sphere will
cause results in its macrocosmic
counterpart.
Nyaya
(“method”) One of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy, con-
cerned with the examination and vali-
dation of the objects of knowledge. It
was the Nyayas who first developed and
codified the notion of the pramanas,
the means by which human beings may
gain true and accurate knowledge. The
Nyayas recognized four such pramanas:
perception (pratyaksha), inference
(anumana), analogy (upamana), and
authoritative testimony (shabda).
These ideas are accepted by virtually all
Indian philosophical schools, and are
the Nyayas’ major contribution to
Indian philosophy.
As did all schools of Indian philoso-
phy, the Nyayas undertook the exami-
nation of knowledge not for mere
speculation, but to find a way to release
the soul from the bondage of reincarna-
tion (samsara). The Nyaya Sutras,
attributed to Gautama, are the
[[480]]

traditional basis for the school. The
sutras begin by asserting that the
means of knowledge and its elements
can bring a person supreme happiness.
The text’s second sutra describes a five-
part causal chain: pain, birth, activity,
defect, and wrong notion. Each of these
elements is caused by the one succeed-
ing it, and is eliminated with the
destruction of its cause. The primary
cause for all of this is “wrong notion,”
hence the Nyaya were concerned with
the investigation of the pramanas.
The Nyayas draw their metaphysics
from the Vaisheshika school, with
whom they become assimilated in the
early centuries of the common era.
Their philosophical perspective is
sometimes described as the “ordinary
person’s conception.” The Nyayas and
Vaisheshika are philosophical realists—
that is, they believe the world is made
up of many different things that exist as
perceived, except in cases of perceptual
error. All things are composed of nine
fundamental substances—the five ele-
ments, space, time, mind, and selves—
and that whatever exists is both
knowable and nameable. The Nyayas
subscribe to the causal model known as
asatkaryavada, which posits that when
a thing is created, it is a new entity,
completely different from its con-
stituent parts. This causal model tends
to multiply the number of things in the
universe, since each act of creation
brings a new thing into being. It also
admits that human efforts and actions
are one of the causes influencing these
affects, making it theoretically possible
to act in a way that brings final libera-
tion of the soul (moksha).
One of the unique features of the
Nyaya school is their belief in inher-
ence (samavaya), a weak relational
force that functions like a glue connect-
ing various things: wholes and their
parts, substances and their attributes,
motions and the things that move, and
general properties and their particular
instances. For the Nyayas, the Self
(atman) is the locus for all experience.
Inherence connects all experiences—Nyaya Sutras
pleasure, pain, happiness, sorrow,
and so forth—to the Self. The philo-
sophical difficulties with inherence—
particularly the notion that it is one
single principle and not a collection of
things—caused the Nyaya school great
difficulty. These assumptions were ulti-
mately responsible for the rise of
Navyanyaya school, which attempted
to explain these relationships in a
more sophisticated way. For further
information see Karl H. Potter and
Sibajiban Bhattacharyya (eds.), Indian
Philosophical Analysis, 1992; and
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Nyaya Sutras
Foundational text for the Nyaya school,
one of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy. The Nyaya Sutras
are traditionally attributed to the
philosopher Gautama; the most signifi-
cant commentary was written by
Vatsyayana in the fourth century. The
Nyaya Sutras begin with an exposition
of the cause of the human bondage,
explained as stemming from a five-part
causal chain: pain, birth, activity,
defect, and wrong notion. Each of
these elements is caused by the one
succeeding it, and is eliminated with
the destruction of its cause. The root
cause for bondage and reincarnation
(samsara) is thus wrong notions,
which must be corrected to attain final
liberation of the soul (moksha). In
their quest for correct understanding,
the Nyaya Sutras devote great attention
to the pramanas, the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge, and to the rules and
procedures for applying them. The
Nyaya Sutras describe four such pra-
manas: perception (pratyaksha), infer-
ence (anumana), analogy (upamana),
and authoritative testimony (shabda).
These ideas are accepted by virtually all
Indian philosophical schools and are
the Nyayas’ major contribution to
Indian philosophy.
[[481]]
Obscenity
## O
Obscenity
Traditional Hindu culture can be char-
acterized as straightlaced, even prudish,
with regard to sexuality; any public
mention of sexuality is taboo in polite
society. The exception of ritually sanc-
tioned obscenity comes before and dur-
ing the festival of Holi, which usually
occurs in March. Holi is a “festival of
reversal,” in which most social taboos
are temporarily suspended. Holi comes
very close to the end of the lunar year,
and symbolizes the end of time, when all
norms and standards have been lost. In
recent times the license and lawlessness
associated with Holi have led many peo-
ple to stop celebrating it in public, par-
ticularly in the cities.
Ocean, Churning of the
Famous mythic event in which the gods
and demons churned the Ocean of Milk
to produce the nectar or immortality.
See also Tortoise avatar.
Offerings
One of the pervasive realities in Hindu
religious life is the importance of transac-
tions or exchanges—both between
human beings, and between humans and
superhuman beings. The importance of
these exchanges makes various offerings a
fundamental part of Hindu worship. One
set of sixteen offerings, known as the
upacharas, are given to a deity as part of
worship, on the model of treating the deity
as an honored guest—inviting the deity
inside, offering the deity a seat, a drink of
water, and so forth. In the naivedya, one
offers the deity food, perhaps the most
fundamental courtesy of all.
[[482]]

Om
A sacred sound. According to tradition,
it should be uttered before and after
reading the Vedas (the oldest Hindu reli-
gious texts), saying any prayer, or per-
forming any sacred rite. When uttered at
the beginning of a rite, it is believed to
remove obstacles, and when uttered at
the end it is seen as a concluding affir-
mation. Because of its pervasive ritual
use, the sound Om is regarded as the
essence of all holy speech. As early as
the Mandukya Upanishad, the sound’s
phonetic elements (A, U, and M) were
interpreted as corresponding to differ-
ent states of consciousness, and ulti-
mately designating the Self (atman). See
also four states of consciousness.
Omens
The notions of auspiciousness and
inauspiciousness are deeply rooted in
Hindu life, and are based on the
assumption that by their very nature
certain things bring good fortune, and
certain other things bring ill fortune.
The notion of omens is an extension of
this idea; omens are important not
because they cause good or bad fortune
in themselves, but because they indicate
conditions that are present. According
to this belief, auspicious conditions will
automatically give rise to favorable
omens, and inauspicious conditions to
unfavorable omens. Omens serve as
indicators to help judge the current state
of affairs and make any necessary
adjustments. For example, if on leaving
the house to do some business one sees
a person deemed inauspicious, one
should return to the home and begin
again, lest the work be fruitless.
Omkareshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on an
island in the Narmada River in the state
of Madhya Pradesh, about fifty miles
southeast of the city of Indore. The tem-
ple is named after its presiding deity, the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
“Lord of [the sound] Om,” an utteranceOrdeal, Trial By
claimed to symbolize the entire uni-
verse, according to the early specula-
tive texts known as the Upanishads.
Omkareshvar is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites at
which Shiva is uniquely present.
According to the site’s mythic charter,
Shiva appears there to reward the sage
Mandhata, who has performed harsh
asceticism (tapas) to gain a vision of
Shiva. The image at the site is a “self-
manifested” (svayambhu) form of
Shiva—an unshaped, roundish black
stone emerging from the earth, while
nearby is a white stone considered to
be a manifestation of Shiva’s wife,
Parvati. Viewing this image is believed
to grant all of one’s desires, just as it did
for Mandhata. Worship at the site con-
tinues all year, but during Kartik
Purnima, the full moon in the lunar
month of Kartik (October–November),
there is a major bathing (snana) festival
at the site.
Onam
The festival of Onam, in the southern
Indian state of Kerala, is celebrated
in the Malayalam month of Chingal,
which corresponds to the northern
Indian
month
of
Bhadrapada
(August–September). Onam is a four-
day harvest festival highlighted by races
in elaborately carved boats known as
“snake boats,” some of which are large
enough to carry 100 paddlers. The most
famous of these boat races are held in
the Keralan town of Aleppey.
Oraon
Northern Indian tribal (adivasi) com-
munity. The Oraons are concentrated
in the southwestern corner of modern
Bihar, in the geologic region known as
the Ranchi Plateau. The land is quite
poor, and for many life is very difficult.
For a discussion of the difficulties of
Oraon life, see Sudhir Kakar, Shamans,
Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Ordeal, Trial By
Trial by ordeal was one of the traditional
means for establishing a person’s guilt or
innocence. Ordeals were considered a
“divine” proof, but could only be used in
cases when human proofs such as evi-
dence or eyewitness testimony were
inadequate or unobtainable. Crimes
committed in secret or in lonely places,
questions of sexual consent, or money
left for deposit were proven by these tri-
als, following a carefully established rit-
ual procedure. The trial could be done in
four different ways: fire, water, balance,
or poison.
The fire ordeal entailed carrying a
red-hot iron ball, licking a red-hot plow-
share, or removing a ring or coin from a
vessel of boiling oil, with guilt or inno-
cence established by whether or not one
was burned. The water ordeal entailed
remaining underwater for a specified
length of time, with guilt determined by
the inability to do so. The balance ordeal
was done by successive weighings, with
the conviction that a guilty person
would become progressively heavier.
The poison ordeal was performed either
by consuming poison, or by safely
removing a coin from an earthen pot
containing a cobra; innocence was
established by surviving.
There were fairly strict prescriptions
governing which of these ordeals certain
people were allowed to perform.
Women, the elderly, and the infirm were
subjected to the test of balance; brah-
mins were generally forbidden from
undertaking ordeal by poison. In every
case the actual ordeal was preceded by
the person proclaiming his or her inno-
cence, followed by declarations praising
the saving power of truth and the
damning force of untruth. Historians
speculate that these required declara-
tions helped make the ordeal more reli-
able. For instance, in the ordeal of
licking a red-hot plowshare, a guilty per-
son might be significantly more nervous
and thus have less moisture on the
tongue. Similarly, the nervousness dur-
ing the water ordeal may have impeded

a person’s ability to hold his breath.
Whether or not these speculations have
any merit, the most important feature in
the original Hindu context was the belief
in the power of truth itself.

Orissa
A state in modern India on the eastern
coast between the states of Andhra
Pradesh and West Bengal. Orissa traces
its roots to the kingdom of Kalinga and
the bloody conquest by the Mauryan
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–232 B.C.E.).
During the early medieval period the
Kesari and Ganga dynasties built stun-
ning temples, many of which exist today.
Modern Orissa is largely undeveloped,
and a large percentage of its people are
indigenous tribal peoples (adivasis).
Historically, Hindu culture has been
manifest in the coastal regions, whereas
the interior has been tribal land. Orissa’s
sacred sites include the Ganga-era
temples in the state capital of
[[484]]

Bhubaneshvar, the sacred city of Puri,
and the temple to the Sun at Konarak.

Orissi
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Kathak,
Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali,
and Manipuri. Dance in Orissa dates to
the second century B.C.E.; the present
Orissi style has its roots in the dance
performed at the temple of the god
Jagannath in Puri. The temple itself was
built in the eleventh century; the sub-
sidiary part, known as the natamandira
(“dance-hall”), was built about a century
later. The latter period was the era of the
poet Jayadeva, whose lyric poem, the
Gitagovinda, is the only non-scriptural
poem that can be recited in the temple.
According to tradition, Jayadeva’s wife,
Padmavati, was one of the dancers in
the temple, and it was she who first
danced parts of the Gitagovinda as an
offering to Jagannath. As dance at theOwl
temple evolved, two categories of tem-
ple dancers emerged: those allowed to
dance in the inner sanctum, and those
allowed to dance in the natamandira.
In the seventeenth century, a third
type of dance emerged—boys dressed
as dancing girls performed for general
entertainment both outside and inside
the temple. The latter dance tended to
be more athletic and acrobatic, where-
as the women’s dance was more gentle
and lyrical.
The modern Orissi style combines
both elements. The most characteristic
stance is the chauka (“square”), in which
the feet are spread wide and pointed in
opposite directions, with the knees
bent so that the upper leg is parallel to
the ground. The arms are held in a mir-
roring position, bent at the elbow with
the upper arms horizontal, and the
lower arms and hands pointing straight
down. The dance’s stylistic impression
is one of roundness and fluidity, creat-
ed by rippling movements in the upper
body during the dance. As in all the
Indian dances, Orissi has a well-devel-
oped vocabulary of gesture and expres-
sion, making complex story-telling
possible. The modern Orissi dance form
has been shaped by the shift from tem-
ple to stage in the twentieth century;
this change of venue has been primarily
responsible for its “classical” form
becoming more rigidly defined than in
the past. For further information see
Mohan Khokar, Traditions of Indian
Classical Dance, 1984.
toward it and unable to “see” anything

Hindi, calling someone an “owl” is a mild
insult, referring to the other as a “fool.”

Pacification of Planets
## P
Pacification of Planets
Indian astrology (jyotisha) recognizes
nine “planets”: the sun, moon,
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn; the remaining two are Rahu and
Ketu, which do not correspond to any
Western astrological features. Each of
these planets is considered helpful or
harmful by nature. The relative strength
of any planet is believed to depend on
its position in the horoscope and vis-à-
vis the other planets. All are seen as
minor divinities rather than as simple
material objects, and thus a potentially
harmful planet can be “pacified”
through rites intended to minimize its
disruptive potential. One common
means of pacification is to wear the
gemstone corresponding to the particu-
lar planet, so that the stone can neutral-
ize the planet’s force. More inauspicious
cases demand stronger measures, often
involving rites in which the planetary
inauspiciousness is given away through
the medium of gifts (dana). For further
consideration see Gloria Goodwin
Raheja, The Poison in the Gift, 1988. See
also Suryia.
Padma
(“lotus”) One of the richest symbols in
Indian philosophy and iconography,
both Hindu and Buddhist, and an
invariably auspicious object. Its size and
colors make it one of the most beautiful
Indian flowers, but the lotus is also a
potent symbol for spiritual realization. It
is rooted in the mud—symbolizing the
corrupting world with which all beings
must contend—but it blooms above the
surface of the water, signifying transcen-
dence. The lotus plant’s underwater
[[486]]

stems grow as long as necessary to get
the flower bud above the water’s sur-
face—whether three, five, or ten feet—
symbolizing the human ability to
overcome obstacles to spiritual
progress. Finally, lotus leaves are cov-
ered with a waxy coating, upon which
water beads up and flows off; one reli-
gious text, the Bhagavad Gita (5.10),
uses this as a simile for the man who
renounces all attachment and is
untouched by the things of the world.
Aside from its symbolic content, the
lotus is also an important element in
Hindu iconography. It is one of the four
identifying objects carried by the god
Vishnu, along with the conch shell
(shankha), club (gada), and discus
(chakra). It is also commonly carried by
the Goddess, both in her forms as Durga
and related powerful goddesses, and in
her beneficent and benevolent form as
Lakshmi, who is usually portrayed as
standing on a lotus. The lotus even fig-
ures in one of the common Hindu cre-
ation myths, in which a lotus sprouts
from Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal
Brahma, who proceeds to create the
earth. When the universe has run its
course and is about to be destroyed,
same process happens in reverse.
Padmapada
One of the two attested disciples of
Shankaracharya—the other being
Sureshvara—and the founder of the
Vivarana school of Advaita Vedanta.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality, Brahman, lies behind all things,
and that all things are merely differing
forms of that reality. Advaita proponents
claim that reality is nondual (advaita)—
that is, that, despite the appearance of
difference and diversity, all things are
nothing but the formless, unqualified
Brahman. For the Advaitins, the
assumption of diversity is a fundamen-
tal misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things, and a manifestation of
avidya (lack of genuine understanding).Paduka
Man sitting in the padmasana, or lotus posture. This sitting position is often used in yoga and meditation.
The defining characteristic of
Padmapada’s Vivarana school is that he
places the locus of ignorance in
Brahman, in contrast to the Bhamati
school, which placed it in the individual.
To explain how Brahman can be the
locus of ignorance the Vivarana
Advaitins invoke the theory of
Reflectionism: Just as an image appear-
ing in a mirror is based on the original,
but different from it, so human selves
are identical with Brahman, but appear
to be separate. The basis of Padmapada’s
position is an uncompromising affirma-
tion of Brahman as the sole “reality,” to
which anything that exists must belong.

Potter (ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to
Samkara and His Pupils, 1981; and
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Padmasana
(“lotus posture”) Well-known sitting
position (asana) used in yoga and in
meditation; the lotus posture is also one
of the sitting positions in which deities
are portrayed in Hindu iconography. In
this position the person sits cross-
legged, with each foot placed on the
thigh of the opposite leg. One of its ben-
efits is that it is extremely stable and well
suited for meditation, since the angle of
the lower legs keeps the upper part of
the legs flat on the ground, making a
wide base to support the body. Done
properly, it also keeps the spine quite
straight, which is thought essential to
keep from constricting the channels in
the subtle body. In Indian iconography,
the lotus position is sometimes repre-
sented at the base of a statue by the
sculpture of a lotus, which forms the
base on which the image is placed.
Paduka
A wooden sandal used mainly by
ascetics. It consists of a wooden sole and
a mushroom-shaped front post, which
is gripped with first two toes for stability.
Padukas are used by ascetics not only
because of their cheapness and durabil-
ity, but because they are completely free
of animal products such as leather,
which are considered impure. Aside
[[487]]
Padya
from their functional use as footwear,
after death an ascetic’s padukas will
often be kept by his (or, more rarely, her)

cal feel. For further information see

PadyaPaishacha Marriage
(“for the feet”) The third of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the deity
is offered water for washing the feet,
which would be a traditional act of hos-
pitality for a guest coming in from out-
side. The actual act of offering can be
performed in various ways and often
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.
In some cases the water will simply
be presented before the deity’s image
with the understanding that the deity
has taken it, whereas in other cases
the devotee (bhakta) will physically
wash the feet of the image. In either
case, the underlying motive is to show
love for the deity and to minister to the
deity’s needs.One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty.
Paishachas are a class of demons, so a
marriage named after them is already
suspect. The Paishacha marriage takes
place when a man has intercourse with a
woman who is drunk, unconscious, or
asleep. Not surprisingly, this is one of
the four reprehensible (aprashasta)
forms of marriage, and because of the
woman’s lack of conscious awareness,
this form was forbidden, even though it
was deemed a valid marriage. Here the
writers’ concern seems to have been to
give the “bride” legal status as a wife,
rather to legitimate the actions of the
“groom.” Although theoretically valid,
this form of marriage has always been
forbidden, and thus it has never been
one of the common forms of marriage.
See also marriage, eight classical forms.
Pahari
One of the two influential “schools” of
Indian miniature painting, the other
being the Rajasthani. The distinctions
between schools are geographical and
thus somewhat arbitrary, since, for
example, the Basohli paintings belong
to the Pahari school, but are stylistically
closer to those of Rajasthan than to the
later Pahari style.
The Pahari style flourished in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms in the Shiwalik Hills
north and west of Delhi. It first appears
in the kingdom of Basohli, where the
influence of the Rajasthani school is the
clearest, and later developed in the king-
doms of Jammu, Guler, Garhwal, and
Kangra. The developed Pahari style dif-
fers from the Rajasthani in its emphasis
on more linear drawing—perhaps influ-
enced by European art—and a more
restrained use of color, both features
[[488]]

Paithan
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Godavari River in the state of
Maharashtra, about 175 miles east of
Bombay. Although of reduced impor-
tance in modern times, it has a long his-
tory as a trading city and was an
important stopping-point on the central
Indian trade route from southern India
to Ujjain. Since the sixteenth century,
Paithan has been famous as the home of
Eknath, one of the important figures in
the Varkari Panth, a religious commu-
nity centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Varkari religious practice
primarily consists of two pilgrimages, in
which all the participants arrive in
Pandharpur on the same day. Eknath
still symbolically travels to PandharpurPalani
twice each year; a palanquin (palkhi)
bearing his sandals is at the head of the
procession bearing his name.
Paksha
One of the parts in the accepted form of
an inference (anumana) in Indian phi-
losophy. The accepted form for an infer-
ence has three terms: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three has
its own constituent parts. The paksha is
part of the first term, the assertion, and
comprises the class of things about
which the assertion is to be proved. For
instance, in the stock example, “There is
fire on that mountain, because there is
smoke on that mountain,” the paksha
in this case is “that mountain,” or the
class of things about which the asser-
tion must be proved. The class that
forms the paksha must also appear in
the second term of the inference, the
reason, as the common link between
the two parts (as in “this mountain is on
fire, because this mountain is smok-
ing”). The paksha thus forms the com-
mon link between the assertion and the
reason, thereby ensuring that the latter
is relevant to the former.
In the context of a lunar month, the
word paksha refers to the month’s two
“parts.” The Shukla Paksha is the wax-
ing half, while the Krishna Paksha is the
waning half.
Pakudha Kacchayana
An atomistic early Indian philosopher
whose views are mentioned in the
Buddhist scriptures. As these scriptures
portray him, Pakudha believed that
seven things were eternal, unmoving,
and unchanging—the four elements,
ease, pain, and the soul. According to
Pakudha, when a sword cuts a person’s
head in two, no one is deprived of life,
rather the sword merely penetrates the
interval between two elementary sub-
stances (presumably the soul and the
material part of the person’s body). This
example seems to suggest an antisocial
ethos, but beyond this, very little is
known about him.
Pala Dynasty
(8th–12th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in Bihar
but whose core territory also spanned
most of modern Bengal. The Pala
dynasty’s zenith came at the turn of the
ninth century, when they controlled the
entire northern Indian plain all the way
into the Punjab region. Their rise to
power came as a result of political insta-
bility in the Gangetic plain, and the
Palas were quickly supplanted by the
Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty
while
retaining sway over Bengal and Bihar for
several centuries more. Their territory in
Bengal was eventually taken by the Sena
dynasty, and the Palas were finally con-
quered by the Gahadavalas in the mid-
dle of the twelfth century. The Palas and
Senas are both noted for a particular
type of sculpture, in which the images
were made from black chlorite schist
polished to a mirror finish.
Palani
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in the east-
ern part of the state of Tamil Nadu,
about sixty miles northwest of Madurai.
Palani is part of a network of six temples
in Tamil Nadu dedicated to Murugan, a
hill deity who has been assimilated into
the larger pantheon as a form of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva. Five of these
temples have been definitively identi-
fied, and each is associated with a par-
ticular region, a particular ecosystem,
and a particular incident in Murugan’s
mythic career—in the case of Palani,
Murugan lived there as a young ascetic.
Every other shrine to Murugan in Tamil
Nadu can be considered the sixth of
these temples. The cult of Murugan is
thus a symbolic vehicle for Tamil pride
and identity, and since the number six
has connotations of completeness—as
in the six directions, or the six chakras
in the subtle body—it also connotes
that nothing external is needed. For
[[489]]
Palanquin
between the sixth and ninth centuries.
The greatest Pallava rulers were king
Mahendravarman and his successors
Narasimhavarman I and II. The reign
of the Pallava dynasty was marked by
the explosion of southern Indian cul-
ture: the development of Tamil litera-
ture, the devotional (bhakti) religious
fervor of the groups known as the Alvars
and the Nayanars, and the magnificent
religious monuments at Mahabalipuram.
Throughout much of its existence the
Pallava empire carried on a running bat-
tle with the Chalukya and Pandya
Dynasties, neither of which could pre-
vail against it, but it was eventually
absorbed by the next great southern
Indian empire, the Chola dynasty. See
also Tamil language and Tamil epics.
Palm Leaves
A palanquin is used to carry images of a
temple’s deity in ritual processions.

Cultus of Murukan,” in Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. 40,
No. 1 (1972).
Palanquin
Platform or litter supported by poles on
the shoulders of two or more men, and
used as a respectful way to carry some-
thing or someone in procession. A
palanquin can be used to carry the
image of a deity in a ritual procession, or
an ascetic leader or spiritual teacher
(guru) by his (or more rarely, her) disci-
ples, or the sandals (padukas) or other
possessions connected with one’s spiri-
tual leader, as in the Varkari Panth’s pil-
grimage to Pandharpur.

(6th–9th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
whose capital was at the city of
Kanchipuram, and which ruled over
much of the southern Indian peninsula
[[490]]

Until commercially produced paper
became readily available, palm leaves
were the most common writing medium
in traditional India. The palm leaves
were cut into narrow strips held together
by a cord (sutra) running through a hole
punched in the middle of the leaf. Palm
leaf books usually had a top and bottom
made from strips of wood, to protect the
leaves, and these covers were often
ornately decorated. The fragile nature of
these palm leaves made regular copying
necessary to preserve manuscripts, even
though such frequent copying generally
introduced errors. If left untended, the
life span of a manuscript was at most
fifty years, due to the deteriorations
caused by the climate and the damage
from a species of termite known as
“white ants,” which fed on palm leaves.

Pancha Dravida
Collective name for the five main south-
ern Indian brahmin communities,
whose names largely correspond to the
regions in which they live: the GujaratisPanchala
in the state of Gujarat, Maharashtris in
the state of Maharashtra, Karnatas in
the state of Karnataka, Andhras in the
state of Andhra Pradesh, and Dravidas
in deep southern India, in the states of
Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Pancha Gauda
Collective name for the five main north-
ern Indian brahmin communities: the
Gaudas and Kanaujias, who stretch
over most of northern India; the
Maithilas in the northern state of Bihar;
the Utkalas in the coastal state of
Orissa; and the Saraswats, traditionally
found in several widely separated loca-
tions. One group lived in the coastal
region of Sindh in modern Pakistan,
although after Partition in 1947 most
migrated to Bombay. Another group
was located in prepartition Punjab,
although here too they have tended to
migrate away from the part of Punjab in
modern Pakistan. A third branch, known
as the Gauda Saraswats, is found on a
narrow strip of coastline in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka.
Panchagavya
(“five [products of the] cow”) A mixture
of cow’s milk, curds, clarified butter
(ghee), urine, and dung. Since each of
these products comes from the sacred
cow, it is considered a ritually purifying
substance. Panchagavya is drunk for
purification during rituals of expiation
(prayashchitta), and it can also be used
in other rituals used to purify people,
objects, and places.
Panchagni-Tapa
(“five-fires asceticism”) Form of volun-
tary physical mortification, usually per-
formed in the hot season, in which the
person sits surrounded by four fires, the
fifth fire being the sun overhead.
Although this practice is now uncom-
mon, it is very old and routinely named
in the puranas and other religious texts
as one of the standard ascetic practices.
As with all forms of physical ascetic
endurance (tapas), this rite is performed
under the assumption that voluntarily
enduring pain and/or hardship is a
way to gain spiritual, religious, and
magical power.
Panchak Nakshatra
A group of five (pancha) consecutive
nakshatras (the twenty-seven signs in
the lunar zodiac) in Indian astrology
(jyotisha). The lunar houses are divided
equally throughout the solar zodiac,
with 2.25 lunar houses for each solar
sign. In a single lunar month the moon
moves through each of these lunar
houses in turn, spending about a day in
each. The Panchak Nakshatra is believed
to be a highly inauspicious time, and
people who pay attention to astrology
will often severely curtail any nonessen-
tial activities until this time has passed.
Panchakroshi Yatra
A circular journey (yatra) in which pil-
grims circumambulate the outer bound-
ary of Kashi (the largest of the three
concentric ritual areas contained in the
city of Benares) and visit 108 shrines
along the way. The journey’s length is
reckoned at five kroshas (roughly ten
miles), hence the name. The journey
measures out the boundaries of the
sacred city, and thus pilgrims symboli-
cally circle the entire world. Although
the best known Panchakroshi Yatra is in
Benares, and the name is most com-
monly associated with this place, many
other sacred sites (tirthas) have similar
pilgrimage routes, and this process of a
circular journey around a sacred spot is
a common ritual motif.
Panchala
Name of the region corresponding to the
middle part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, centered on the Ganges River
valley around the city of Kanauj.
Panchala is mentioned as a kingdom as
early as the sixth century B.C.E., and
although it became a tributary to the
great empires such as the Mauryas
[[491]]
Panchamahayajna
(4th–3rd c. B.C.E.), it retained an inde-
pendent identity until the third century.
See also Maurya dynasty.
Panchamahayajna
(“[the] five great sacrifices”) Set of
five ritual actions—brahmayajna, pit-
ryajna, devayajna, bhutayajna, and
nryajana—that are prescribed in the
dharma literature, (texts on religious
duty). These five actions are prescribed
daily religious observances for a “twice-
born” householder, that is, a householder
who has been born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—and
who has received the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” Each sacrifice (yajna) is directed
toward a different class of beings—from
the Absolute Reality down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions: to
Brahman by teaching and studying the
Veda, to the ancestral spirits (pitr) by
offerings of water (tarpana), to the gods
(deva) by offering clarified butter into
the sacred fire, to the animals and social
outcasts (bhut) by putting out food for
them, and to human beings (nr) by
showing hospitality to guests. In the
time since the dharma literature was
composed, Hindu life has seen signifi-
cant changes in emphasis, and although
some of these are still important in
modern Hindu life—particularly the
stress on hospitality to guests—in most
cases the others have been either elided
or replaced by other religious forms.
Panchamakara
“The Five Forbidden Things,” literally,
“the five m’s”: A group of five things used
for worship in the secret, ritually based
religious practice known as tantra. This
name arises because the names for all
five of these begin with the letter “m”—
madya (wine), matsya (fish), mamsa
(meat), mudra (fermented or parched
grain), and maithuna (copulation).
They are used in their actual form in
“left hand” (vamachara) tantra, and by
[[492]]

substitution in “right hand” (dakshi-
nachara) tantra.
All five are condemned by
“respectable” Hindu society (the last
because it is characterized as adulter-
ous), and their use in tantric ritual must
be seen in a larger context. One of the
most pervasive tantric assumptions is
the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle—often conceived as the activ-
ity of a particular deity—means that the
adept must reject all concepts based on
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden
Things” provide a ritual means for
breaking down duality, since in this ritual
the adept violates societal norms forbid-
ding consumption of intoxicants, non-
vegetarian food, and illicit sexuality, in a
conscious effort to sanctify what is nor-
mally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara) and is
thus superior to common practice. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,

; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Panchang
In Indian astrology (jyotisha), an
almanac documenting the position of
the various celestial bodies during the
course of a calendar year, including the
days of the moon’s monthly cycle, its
progression through the nakshatras,
and the position of the planets. Most
Hindu religious festivals fall according
to a lunar calendar, and thus a panchang
is needed to determine when they will
arrive. A panchang is also important for
helping people to determine auspicious
and inauspicious times for the perfor-
mance of certain activities. The greatest
care is taken in fixing marriage times, to
avoid any possible inauspiciousness
that could affect the marriage, but
in many cases a panchang will bePanchayat
consulted before initiating any impor-
tant activity.
Pancharatra
(“five nights,” of uncertain meaning)
The name denotes a particular group of
Vaishnavas (devotees of the god
Vishnu). Although there is plenty of evi-
dence that the Pancharatra community
is very old, very little is known about its
origins. In the earliest Vaishnava sectari-
an texts, the Pancharatra community is
unfavorably compared to another
group, the Bhagavatas, with the former
described as marginal and the latter as
“Vedic” and respectable. Despite this
seeming disapprobation, in their earli-
est appearances Pancharatras do not
seem theologically different from the
Bhagavatas, although their differences
may have been rooted in differing
practices. In their later history, the
Pancharatras become associated with
an elaborate theory of creation, final-
ized somewhere around the sixth century
and based on the successive appearance
of four divine emanations: Vishnu-
Narayana, Sankarshana, Pradyumna,
and Aniruddha. The successive activity
of these divine emanations brings the
world into being, but each is also associ-
ated with a particular facet of spiritual
life through which human beings can
reverse the process of creation and gain
liberation. The Pancharatra school is
also important for its theory of primary
and secondary avatars, in which the lat-
ter can include any properly consecrat-
ed image of the deity. The doctrine of
secondary avatars has become a pivotal
idea in the later Shrivaishnava commu-
nity, through which Pancharatra ideas
have continued to influence modern
Hindu life.
Panchatantra
(“Five Treatises”) A collection of moralis-
tic fables intended to impart practical
and worldly wisdom. The fables them-
selves are framed by the story of a king
who is distressed by his sons’ lack of
learning and good moral character,
which gives him grave misgivings about
their ability to rule well after his death.
He resolves this problem by hiring a per-
son to teach the boys through fables,
each of which usually has several shorter
fables embedded in it to give moral
lessons along the way. These fables are
intended to provide pragmatic advice
about how to be successful in the real
world, particularly in the art of state-
craft. This pragmatic focus can lead one
to characterize the text’s advice as
opportunistic, particularly since it
encourages caution and self-interest as
the keys to success. The Panchatantra
exists in several versions, of which the
most famous is the Hitopadesha. The
text has been translated numerous
times; a version found its way to Europe,
where it became the basis for the fables
of La Fontaine.
Panchavati
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, the place where
three of the epic’s central characters—
the god-king Rama, his wife Sita, and
his brother Lakshmana—live during
much of their fourteen years of forest
exile. It is from here that Sita is kid-
napped by Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Although the events in the
Ramayana cannot be definitively set in
any specific place, there is a village
named Panchavati, outside the city of
Nasik in the state of Maharashtra,
which is identified with the mythic site.
Panchayat
In traditional India, a group of five (pan-
cha) elders from a particular community,
who were the final authority for the
members of that community. Each jati
(endogamous subcommunity, often
defined by hereditary occupation) was a
self-governing body, for which the pan-
chayat would make all the important
decisions. In modern India this institu-
tion is being hailed as a paradigm for
decentralized government, in which the
[[493]]
Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja
people themselves take responsibility
for their communities, but since there
are multiple jatis in any traditional
Hindu village, this also means that there
were multiple centers of authority.
Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja
Type of worship (puja) performed by
Smarta brahmins, a group of brahmins
distinguished, not by region or family,
but by the religious texts they hold most
authoritative—in this case, those known
as the smrtis rather than sectarian reli-
gious texts. The panchayatana puja is
marked by the simultaneous worship of
five different deities—usually Vishnu,
Shiva, Surya, Ganesh, and the Goddess.
Individual Smartas may choose one or
another from among these as their pri-
mary deity, but all these deities are ritu-
ally honored since they are all
considered manifestations of the divine.
Panchkedar
(“The Five Kedars”) The collective name
for a network of five sites, sacred to the
god Shiva, spread throughout the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas:
Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath,
Madmaheshvar, and Kalpeshvar. Each
site is identified with a part of Shiva’s
body, thus providing a series of connec-
tions between the deity’s body and the
land itself—understandably so, since
Shiva is believed to dwell in the
Himalayas. Kedarnath is identified as
Shiva’s back, Madmaheshvar his navel,
Tungnath his arm, Rudranath his face,
and Kalpeshvar his matted locks (jata).
Panchvani
(“Five Voices”) Manuscript collection
compiled by the Dadupanth, a religious
community founded by the northern
Indian poet-saint Dadu (1554–1603).
The collection contains the works of five
different devotional (bhakti) poet–
saints: Dadu, Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas,
and Hardas. Rajasthan’s desert climate
has helped to preserve these manu-
scripts, some of which date from the
[[494]]

early seventeenth century. The Panchvani
manuscripts are among the earliest
written sources for these poets, which
makes them an important resource for
the historical study of northern Indian
devotional poetry. For further informa-
tion on the literary resources of the
Dadupanth, see Winand Callewaert
(trans.), The Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi
Rajab, 1978; and The Sarvangi of
Gopaldas, 1993.
Panda
A hereditary priest who assists pilgrims
with any rituals they may need or desire
to perform, and also with any other
needs that the pilgrims may have. Each
panda family in any given pilgrimage
place (tirtha) has the exclusive rights to
serve pilgrims coming from a particular
geographical area or areas; pilgrims are
supposed to seek out the panda serving
their native region, whether or not the
pilgrims still live in that place. On every
visit, pilgrims will make an entry in the
panda’s pilgrim register (bahi), detailing
the names of those who visited and the
reason that they came. Some of these
registers date back hundreds of years,
and the documents are the ultimate
proof of the hereditary connection
between panda and pilgrim families. In
earlier times this hereditary relationship
was essential for the pilgrims, since their
connection with their pandas provided
resources while traveling—lodging,
food, and other sorts of support. The
pandas would minister to their clients,
arrange for any needed rites, and even
lend them money, if necessary. Pilgrims
would usually give the panda a token
gift when they departed, along with a
pledge for some larger amount, which
the pandas would travel to their homes
to pick up.
Although pandas are often character-
ized as greedy and rapacious—based on
their tendency to demand what they
think a client is able to pay—in its ideal
form both parties benefit from the rela-
tionship. In recent years, the pandas
have become less central figures inPandharpur
Varkari Panth pilgrims en route to Pandharpur.
many pilgrimage places, and conse-
quently, their status and their income
have declined. Many pilgrimage places
have been developed as sites for reli-
gious tourism, and hotels and facilities
that have been built at these places have
rendered pilgrims less dependent on
their pandas for accommodation. At the
same time, recent years have seen a gen-
eral decline in the performance of ritual
acts, except for the most important, par-
ticularly those connected with death.
Pandava
(“sons of Pandu”) A collective name
for the five brothers who are the
protagonists of the Mahabharata:
Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula,
and Sahadeva. Although they are
named after king Pandu, none are actu-
ally his son, since Pandu has been
cursed to die the moment he holds his
wife in amorous embrace. Rather, they
are magically conceived through a
mantra given by the sage Durvasas to
Kunti, Pandu’s senior wife. The mantra
gives the woman who recites it the
power to call down any god and to have,
by that god, a son equal in power to him-
self. Kunti uses this mantra to bear
Yudhishthira by the god Dharma,
Arjuna by the storm-god Indra, and
Bhima by the wind-god Vayu. With
Pandu’s blessing Kunti also teaches the
mantra to her co-wife Madri, who med-
itates on the Ashvins (divine twins who
are the physicians to the gods), and
delivers the twins Nakula and Sahadeva.
The basic theme of the Mahabharata
is the story of the struggle for royal
power between the Pandavas and
their cousins, the Kauravas, which
culminates in a war that destroys the
entire family.
Pandharpur
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bhima River in the state of
Maharashtra, about 185 miles east and
south of Bombay. Pandharpur is best
known for the temple to the god
Vithoba, and has been a center of wor-
ship for the Varkari Panth religious
community for at least seven hundred
years. Varkari rituals center around a
twice-yearly pilgrimage to Pandharpur,
[[495]]
Pandrenthan
in which the pilgrims all arrive on the
same day. Each pilgrim procession starts
from a different place and is identified
with one of the poet-saints who helped
form the community. At the front of
each procession is a palanquin (palkhi)
bearing the sandals of that group’s par-
ticular saint, who is thus symbolically
leading them into Pandharpur. For more
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; I. B. Karve, “On the
Road,” Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 22,
No. 1, 1962; and Digambar Balkrishna
Mokashi, Palkhi, 1987.
Pandrenthan
Historical site south of the city of
Shrinagar in Kashmir. Pandrenthan is
famous for one of the few old Hindu
temples still standing in Kashmir, a tem-
ple dedicated to the god Shiva built in
the twelfth century C.E. The shrine itself
is fairly small and simple. The floor plan
is basically square, with each side 17.5
feet long and an entrance on each side
giving the temple an open feel. Each
doorway has a gable over it projecting
out from a pyramidal roof known
to builders as a hip roof. The temple
is built entirely of stone but has
overlapping courses, in an attempt to
mimic wooden construction.
Pandu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambalika. Pandu and
his brother Dhrtarashtra are born as the
result of a desperate attempt to preserve
the royal line of King Shantanu after
Shantanu’s son Vichitravirya dies with-
out heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s death, his
mother Satyavati calls upon her eldest
son, Vyasa, to sleep with Vichitravirya’s
wives, Ambika and her sister Ambalika,
in the hope that the women will con-
ceive. According to tradition Vyasa is
very ugly, and each woman reacts invol-
untarily when Vyasa appears in her bed:
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind, and
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
[[496]]

Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion. Given Dhrtarashtra’s
blindness, Pandu is the best suited to
rule; he marries Kunti and Madri and
lives quite happily as the king.
This idyllic time abruptly ends one
day while he is hunting in the forest and
shoots a deer while it is mating. To his
horror, he discovers that the deer is the
sage Kindama, who has taken this form
for sport with his wife; with his dying
breath, the sage curses Pandu that he
will die the moment he touches his wife
in an amorous embrace. Since he has no
children, and the curse condemns him
to die without an heir, Pandu abdicates
the throne in favor of his brother
Dhrtarashtra and goes with his wives to
live as an ascetic in the Himalayas. At
this time Kunti tells him about the
mantra she has received years before
from the sage Durvasas, which gives the
woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods and to have by him
a son equal in power to himself. With
Pandu’s blessing Kunti and Madri bear
five heroic sons, the five Pandava broth-
ers. They all live happily together until
one day when Pandu, swayed by the
intoxicating influence of spring, ignores
Madri’s warnings and embraces her. The
sage’s curse takes effect and Pandu falls
dead, although, through the power of
the mantra, his family line continues.
Pandurang
(“pale”) Epithet of the god Vithoba,
whose primary place of worship is in the
holy city of Pandharpur in the state of
Maharashtra. See Vithoba.
Pandya Dynasty
(6th–14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
whose capital was in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. The Pandyas
existed as a regional power as early as
the late sixth century, when they fought
the Pallava dynasty of Kanchipuram for
control of the peninsula. The Pandyas at
one time became vassals to the Chola
dynasty when the latter reigned over allPanth
of southern India, but with the decline of
the Cholas the Pandyas became the
dominant regional power, eventually
absorbing the Chola kingdom in 1279. At
their zenith in the thirteenth century the
Pandyas controlled most of the southern
part of India, but were in turn conquered
and annexed early in the fourteenth cen-
tury by the Sangama dynasty, also known
as the Vijayanagar dynasty after their
capital city.
Panguni
Twelfth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Mina (the zodiacal sign of
Pisces), which usually falls within March
and April. This name is a modification of
Phalgun, the twelfth month of the lunar
calendar. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the con-
tinuing importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Pani
A group of northern Indian people men-
tioned in a hymn in the Rg Veda (10.108),
the oldest Hindu religious text. This ref-
erence speaks poorly of this group, since
it portrays them as cattle thieves. The
hymn is spoken as a dialogue between
the Panis and Sarama, the divine dog
who is the servant of the god Indra and
who has been sent by Indra to recover
the cattle the Panis have stolen. This
hymn may refer to an actual incident
and an actual group of people, but it is
impossible to say. Certainly the Vedas
were not written as a strict historical
record, and it is perilous to read them as
such. At the same time, as the earliest
textual records they preserve references
to the culture and to contemporary
times that can be found nowhere else.
Panigrahana
A minor rite, performed in many Hindu
marriages, in which the groom grasps
the bride’s right hand as a symbol of
their impending marital union. See also
marriage customs.
Panini
(4th c. B.C.E.) The greatest Sanskrit
grammarian, whose descriptive account
of that language in his Ashtadhyayi
(“Eight Sections”) became the prescrip-
tive norm for the language in later gen-
erations. Panini was not the earliest
grammarian, since he names several in
his text; his genius lay rather in his skills
as an organizer and systematizer. Each
of the Ashtadhyayi’s eight sections is
written as a series of brief aphorisms
(sutras), each of which provides the
foundation and necessary background
for those that follow. Panini’s use of this
form allowed him to provide a complete
account of the language in the briefest
possible space, and the text’s condensed
form made it easier to memorize. As
with most sutra texts, the Ashtadhyayi’s
terseness of expression presupposes a
commentary, of which the most famous
is the Mahabhashya, written by the
grammarian Patanjali in the second
century B.C.E.
Panth
General term used for a particular reli-
gious community, such as the
Dadupanth, Varkari Panth, or the
Nanak Panth—an older name for the
Sikh community, which has simply been
abridged to “Panth” by contemporary
Sikhs. The word is derived from the
Sanskrit word for “path” and is here
used metaphorically to indicate a fixed
pattern of belief and behavior, often
rooted in a particular individual’s teach-
ings. There is a certain amount of
semantic overlap between the words
panth and sampraday, both of which
denote religious communities, and
there is no hard-and-fast rule dividing
the two. In general, however, the term
[[497]]
Pap
panth is more closely associated with
movements in the sant religious tradi-
tion, which tended toward rebellion
against the prevailing religious estab-
lishment, whereas sampraday is more
commonly applied to groups that
evolved within these established reli-
gious communities.
Pap
(“evil”) A word sometimes used as an
adjective to describe people and
actions, but most often used as a noun,
either to denote a particular deed as evil
or to refer to the collective evil one has
accumulated through the bad deeds in
one’s karmic career. Since, according to
karma theory, all one’s deeds will even-
tually come to fruition, the evil that one
has done is seen as already existing,
even if only in a potential state. The
opposite of pap is punya, the most gen-
eral term denoting religious merit.
Papamochani Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Chaitra (March–April). The name
Papamochani means “freeing from
evil,” and the faithful observance of
this festival is believed to do exactly
that. As with all the eleventh-day
observances, it is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals
have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship (puja), and often promise spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance.
On this day one should worship Vishnu
with the full complement of the sixteen
upacharas (“offerings”).
Papankusha Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Ashvin (September–October). As with
all the eleventh-day observances, it is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
[[498]]

prescribed rites, which usually involve
fasting (upavasa) and worship (puja),
and often promise specific benefits for
faithful performance. This ekadashi’s
name indicates that it is the goad
(ankusha) to drive away all evil (pap),
here fancifully conceived as an elephant.
Thus, faithfully observing this festival is
believed to cleanse one of all one’s sins.
Parakiya
(“belonging to another”) Particular type
of relationship between lover and
beloved, in which the woman is seen as
married to another person. Parakiya is
said to generate the most intense pas-
sion, since the people pursuing it have
nothing to gain but love itself—if
caught, they risk ridicule and shame,
and in any case their liaison has no real
future. This is not the conventional, safe
love with one’s own spouse (svakiya)
that is sanctioned by marriage, carries
social approval, and usually entails pro-
creation, but rather a dangerous love
pursued solely for pleasure. This type of
relationship is a standard image in
Sanskrit poetry, and is also the domi-
nant theme for describing the relation-
ship between the god Krishna and his
human consort Radha, which is seen as
symbolizing the relationship between
god and the human soul.
Paramahamsa
(“supreme Hamsa”) One of four types of
Hindu ascetic. The four types were
based on their supposed means of liveli-
hood, which in practice has been much
less important for ascetic identity than
sectarian or organizational affiliation.
The Paramahamsa is the most presti-
gious of the four, the others being (in
order of increasing status) Kutichaka,
Bahudaka, and Hamsa. Paramahamsas
have no fixed abode and always live in
an uninhabited place. They are said to
have transcended all questions of reli-
gious duty (dharma), purity, and impu-
rity (ashaucha), to have broken all
attachments to the world, and to beParashara Smrti
continually immersed in contemplation
of the Supreme Brahman.
The word Paramahamsa has a more
specialized meaning among the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetic devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva whose organi-
zation is divided into ten sections, each
designated by a particular name. Here
the name Paramahamsa refers to an
ascetic who comes from one of the
three twice-born (dvija) varnas—that
is, who is a brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya, the three social groups with
higher symbolic status—and who has
been initiated as a Sanyasi in one of
the six divisions that will accept non-
brahmins. Paramahamsas have higher
status in these divisions than the Naga
or fighting ascetics, who will initiate
shudras, but lower status than the
Dandis, who are invariably brahmins.
Parashara
In Hindu mythology, a legendary sage
who is the grandson of the sage
Vasishtha. He is credited with authoring
the Parashara Smrti, an important and
early work in the dharma literature.
Parashara is best known as the father of
the sage Vyasa, whom he begets through
a maiden named Satyavati. Satyavati
makes her living ferrying people across
the Ganges River, and although she is a
beautiful young woman, she always
smells of fish because her mother is a
celestial nymph who has been cursed to
live as a fish in the Ganges. Struck by
Satyavati’s beauty while she is ferrying
him across the river, Parashara creates
an artificial fog to give them the privacy
to have sexual intercourse. As a reward,
he gives her the boon that, from that day
onward, she will smell of musk instead
of fish.
Paramatman
(“the highest self”) Term generally used
as a synonym for Brahman, the unqual-
ified and undifferentiated reality that is
seen as the source of all things, and the
sole true power in the universe. This
name, through its inclusion of the Self
(atman) as part of the term, also empha-
sizes the identity in kind between
Brahman and atman, between Supreme
Reality and the individual Self.
Parampara
(“succession”) The general term for
the spiritual lineage maintained by
the
transmission
of
knowledge
and power from guru to disciple.
Such lineages form the basis for
tracing spiritual descent within
religious communities, particularly
in secret traditions such as tantra.
In a religious context, one’s spiritual
lineage is an important factor in
establishing an identity and connec-
tions with others in the school, in the
same way a biological lineage places one
within a family.
Parashara Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed impor-
tant but less authoritative than the other
textual category, the shrutis, or “heard”
texts. This smrti is ascribed to the sage
Parashara, and is an example of one of
the Dharma Shastras, which were man-
uals prescribing rules for correct human
behavior and ideal social life. Unlike the
Dharma Sutras, which are ascribed to
recognizable individuals, the Dharma
Shastras are usually ascribed to mythic
sages as a strategy to reinforce the
authority of these texts. At 592 verses,
the Parashara Smrti is relatively short,
and it treats only two themes, religious
custom (achara) and expiation
(prayashchitta). The text is estimated
to have been written between the
first and fifth centuries, but in the four-
teenth century it received an extensive
commentary by Madhava, and the
resulting work, known as the
Parasharamadhava, has continued to
be influential since then.
[[499]]
Parashu
The god Vishnu’s Parashuram avatar, carrying his
battle-axe. He appears in this form to punish the
warrior class’ abuse of power.
Parashu
(“battle-axe”) A characteristic object in
Hindu iconography, and one that
appears in various forms—sometimes
with a very light, thin handle and a larger
head, at other times with a handle the
size of a club (gada) and a very small,
thin head. This weapon has the
strongest mythic associations with
Vishnu’s sixth avatar or incarnation,
Parashuram, who uses it in his war of
extermination against the the ruling
kshatriya class when their pride has
grown too strong. The battle-axe is also
commonly carried by the god Ganesh
and signifies his power to cut through
obstacles and impediments. It also com-
monly appears in various images of the
deities Shiva, Vishnu, and the Goddess,
as one among their galaxy of weapons.
Parashuram Avatar
Sixth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu. As with all the avatars of Vishnu,
[[500]]

the Parashuram avatar comes to restore
a cosmic equilibrium that has been
thrown out of balance, in this case from
the overweening abuse of power by the
warrior (kshatriya) class. Parashuram is
the son of Jamadagni, a brahmin sage
whose most precious possession is
Surabhi, a cow that will grant its owner
any desired wish. One day when
Parashuram is away, the king comes to
Jamadagni’s ashram. When he sees the
cow, he desires it, and when Jamadagni
refuses to give it to him, the king takes it
by force.
When Parashuram learns of this, he
becomes fiercely angry. Taking up his
parashu (or battle-axe, a weapon partic-
ularly associated with him), he enters
into battle with the king and eventually
kills him. When the king’s sons remain
rebellious in opposition to him,
Parashuram makes twenty-one journeys
around India, destroying all of the ksha-
triyas that he can find, in an effort to
wipe them from the face of the earth.
The major theme of this story is the con-
flict between the brahmin and kshatriya
classes, and the realities of living in a
society in which brahmins had religious
authority but kshatriyas had the power
of enforcement. This story reveals a
strong concern for the sanctity of a
brahmin’s possessions and highlights
the perils of taking them by force. The
writers behind the story were almost
certainly brahmins, and their remarks
on the perils of taking a brahmin’s pos-
sessions doubtless reflect an insecurity
about their ability to supersede govern-
mental power.
In addition to the story of extermi-
nating the kshatriyas, Parashuram
appears in the epic Mahabharata as the
person who teaches the heroic Karna
the art of weapons and warfare. The epic
portrays Parashuram as powerful and
irascible, and as possessing such contin-
uing hatred of kshatriyas that he refuses
to take them as students. When
Parashuram discovers that Karna is a
kshatriya and not a brahmin, as he
has claimed to be, he lays a curse on
Karna that, in his hour of greatestParinamavada
need, he will forget everything he has
learned as his student.
Parashurameshvar Temple
Temple constructed about 750 C.E. in
the city of Bhubaneshvar in the state
of Orissa, dedicated to the god Shiva
in his aspect as the “Lord of
Parashuram.” This title refers to
Parashuram’s long period of asceti-
cism, in which he worshiped Shiva as
his chosen deity and was rewarded
with Shiva’s grace. The temple is an
early example of the Orissan variant
of the northern Indian Nagara temple
style. The Nagara style emphasizes
verticality, with the whole temple
building culminating in a single high
point, and the Orissan variant of this
style has a single enormous tower
(deul) over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, with shorter subsidiary
buildings leading up to it. The
Parashurameshvar temple is the first
example of this basic pattern—a low,
flat assembly hall (jagamohan), fol-
lowed by a much taller and narrower
tower (deul), in this case about forty
feet high. Although later Orissan tem-
ples are much larger—some of the
deuls tower over 200 feet—and often
include additional buildings and struc-
tures, they all retain this basic pattern.
Parashuram Jayanti
Festival marking the birthday of
Parashuram avatar, Vishnu’s sixth
avatar. This takes place on the third
day of the bright (waxing) half of the
lunar month of Baisakh (April–May),
the same day as the festival of
Akshaya Trtiya.
Parikshit
Mythic king in the Lunar Line, who
serves as an example that one’s fate can-
not be escaped. Parikshit is the grand-
son of Arjuna, one of the five Pandava
brothers who are the protagonists in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics.
Parikshit inherits the throne from
Yudhishthira, Arjuna’s elder brother,
and according to tradition rules right-
eously for sixty years, but it is his death
that is best remembered. Fond of hunt-
ing, Parikshit one day comes across a
meditating sage while he is chasing a
wounded deer. When the sage refuses to
answer to his inquiries about the deer,
Parikshit grows angry and, with his bow,
drapes a dead cobra around the sage’s
neck. The sage remains unaware of this,
but his son finds out about it when his
playmates jeer at him. Furious, the son
lays a curse that the person responsible
will be fatally bitten within seven days
by the great serpent Takshaka. When he
discovers that the king is responsible,
the son repents his curse to the King.
Parikshit takes all possible precau-
tions to avoid his fate. He builds a house
on a huge pillar, has anything brought
into the house carefully searched, and
surrounds himself with physicians who
can cure snakebite. After six days with-
out incident, the king begins to relax his
vigilance. As the seventh day is ending,
Takshaka conceals himself as a worm in
a piece of fruit, changes into his real
shape when the fruit is cut open, and
bites the king, killing him.
Parinamavada
(“transformation-relationship”) Philo-
sophical perspective that explains the
relationship between the Ultimate
Reality or realities and the perceivable
world, and describes the world as a gen-
uine transformation of this reality.
This position is espoused by propo-
nents of the Samkhya, Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, and Bhedabhada philo-
sophical schools. All three of these are
proponents of a causal model called
satkaryavada. The satkaryavada model
assumes that effects preexist in their
causes, and that, when these effects
appear, they are transformations (pari-
nama) of those causes. The classic
example for this model is the transfor-
mation of milk to curds, butter, and clar-
ified butter: each of these effects was
[[501]]
Parivartini Ekadashi
already present in the cause, emerges
from it through a natural transformation
of that cause, and is causally related to it.
All three schools believe that the
world as perceived is real and has some
single ultimate source behind it: for the
Samkhyas, the first principles are
purusha and prakrti, for the
Vishishthadvaita school, the god
Vishnu, and for the Bhedabhada school,
Brahman. All believe that real things
come into being because these first
principles undergo real transforma-
tions. Parinamavada allows for an expla-
nation of the phenomenal world that
compromises the transcendence of
these first principles by making them
part of the world. Philosophically, their
difficulties arise in describing how the
transcendent can become mundane,
and then become transcendent again.
The transformation relationship is
vehemently opposed by the Advaita
Vedanta philosophical school, which
upholds a philosophical position
known as monism (the belief that a
single Ultimate Reality lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of that reality). Advaita
proponents claim that reality is non-
dual (advaita)—that is, that all things
are “actually” the formless, unquali-
fied Brahman, despite the appearance
of difference and diversity in the
world. Since Brahman is the only real
thing, and Brahman never changes,
the parinama model is a fundamental
misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things, since it assumes real
change. The Advaita proponents’
explanation for the nature of the rela-
tionship and the world is known as
vivartavada (“illusory manifesta-
tion”), in which the ultimate appears
to become transformed but in reality
never changes. For further informa-
tion see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook
in Indian Philosophy, 1957; and Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
[[502]]

Parivartini Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Bhadrapada (August–September). As are
all the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu. This
day is particularly devoted to the wor-
ship of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi, the god-
dess presiding over wealth and
prosperity. In her form as Mahalakshmi
(as told in the Devimahatmya) she is
able to kill demons that the gods cannot,
and restore to gods the kingdom they
have lost. This festival occurs during the
time Vishnu is believed to be sleeping on
the serpent Shesha, on an ocean of milk,
with Lakshmi massaging his feet. The
name Parivartini means “turning,” and
on this day Vishnu is believed to be stir-
ring in his sleep. See also ocean, churn-
ing of the; and cosmology.
Parivrajaka
(from Sanskrit parivraj, “to wander
about”) A term that can be used to
denote any wandering religious mendi-
cant. Continual wandering is a very old
Indian ascetic practice. It shows the
conscious renunciation of the fixed and
stable world of the householder, partic-
ularly in earlier societies, and it prevents
the wanderer from forming any sort of
attachments, even to places. This exem-
plifies the fourth and final stage of life
found in the dharma literature, the
sanyasi, in which a person has
renounced all attachments of everyday
life to search for spiritual attainment.
Parmananddas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devotees
(bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight
are also named as members of the com-
munity and as associates of either theParvati
community’s founder, Vallabhacharya,
or his successor Vitthalnath. Little is
known about Parmananddas himself,
although tradition asserts that he was a
Kanaujia brahmin, and the corpus of
poetry attributed to him is much larger
in later sources, suggesting that his
name was used by later writers. The evi-
dence from the earliest sources suggests
that he was a devoted follower of
Vallabhacharya. Much of his poetry is
specifically written for the Pushti Marg,
such as hymns in praise of
Vallabhacharya, or hymns to be sung for
the worship of Krishna throughout the
day, a form of piety that came to charac-
terize the Pushti Marg. To date, his
works have not been translated, perhaps
because of their sectarian character.
Parvana
A particular type of the memorial rites
for the dead known as shraddhas. A par-
vana shraddha can be performed at spe-
cific times throughout the year, such as
the new moon, but is most commonly
performed during the Fortnight of the
Fathers (Pitrpaksha), which falls during
the waning moon in the lunar month of
Bhadrapada. Whereas an ekoddishta
shraddha is performed for any particu-
lar deceased individual, the parvana
shraddha invokes first the paternal
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,
then the same ancestors on the mother’s
side. The rite is performed to give bene-
fits to all of these ancestors, although
the father’s ancestors are considered the
primary recipients.
Parvata Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth century
philosopher Shankaracharya, in an
effort create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu
life. Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case,
parvata (“mountain”). Upon initiation,
new members are given this name
as a surname to their new ascetic
names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths) sup-
posedly established by Shankaracharya.
The Parvata Dashanamis belong to the
Anandawara group, which is affiliated
with the Jyotir math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath.
Parvati
(“daughter of the mountain”) Wife of
the god Shiva, and an important
Hindu goddess, Parvati is the daughter
of the minor deity Himalaya (the
Himalaya Mountains personified), and
his wife Mena. Parvati appears in
human form to draw Shiva out of the
ascetic isolation in which he has been
lost since the death of his first wife,
Sati, and to induce him to father the
son necessary to kill the demon
Taraka. According to her myths, even
in her childhood Parvati vows that she
will have only Shiva for her husband.
Her parents try to discourage her,
since Shiva has taken a vow of asceti-
cism and is absorbed in deep medita-
tion on Mount Kailas.
Parvati’s first effort to arouse Shiva’s
desire ends in a dismal failure. Kama,
the god of love, tries to shoot Shiva with
an arrow of desire, but Shiva lets loose a
stream of fire from the third eye in his
forehead, burning Kama to ash.
Undeterred, Parvati goes into the moun-
tains and begins a program of harsh
physical asceticism (tapas) of her own:
standing on one foot for immense peri-
ods of time, enduring the heat of sum-
mer and cold of winter, and practicing
severe fasting (upavasa) and self-denial.
The spiritual power generated by her
asceticism eventually awakens Shiva,
and he comes to her, disguised as an
aged brahmin. He tries to discourage
[[503]]
Parvati
Parvati with her husband Shiva and their sons Ganesh and Skanda.
Parvati by making disparaging remarks
about Shiva’s lifestyle and personality, but
Parvati, unshaken in her resolve, refuses
to listen. Eventually Shiva reveals his true
form to her, and they are married.
Although in his devotion to his wife
Shiva is the Hindu symbol for the ideal
[[504]]

husband, their family life is unusual.
Since Shiva is the symbol for the perfect
ascetic, the couple has no fixed home or
means of support, and occasionally
Parvati is portrayed as complaining of
being an ascetic’s wife. Symbolically, their
marriage represents the domestication ofPashupati
the ascetic and his entrance into social
and family life. Their union highlights
the cultural tension between the two
most important Hindu religious ideals:
the householder and the renunciant
ascetic. Perhaps to illustrate the contra-
diction of being a married ascetic, Shiva
and Parvati have children but not in the
normal way: Skanda develops from
Shiva’s semen, which falls on the ground
during their interrupted love-making,
while Ganesh is formed of the enlivened
dirt from Parvati’s body.
Parvati, as with all married Hindu
goddesses, is generally seen as benign
and benevolent. In some mythic stories
she can be spiteful, but on the whole she
projects a nurturing and motherly pres-
ence. Her mythology is almost com-
pletely connected with that of Shiva,
showing her subordination as the model
wife, and her worship is generally con-
nected with him as well. She occupies
an important position in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
since in tantric texts Parvati is usually
portrayed as the person questioning
Shiva and then as the student receiving
his instruction. For more information
on Parvati and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Paryanka
(“bedstead”) One of the postures
(asanas) described in commentaries to
the Yoga Sutras, in which the person is
lying down with the arms stretched
around the knees.
Pasha
(“noose”) In Indian iconography, one of
the weapons carried by some of the
divinities, especially Ganesh and Yama.
For Ganesh, as the “Lord of Obstacles,”
the noose signifies his ability to bind
(and release) obstacles, whereas Yama,
the god of death, uses the noose to draw
the soul from the body at the time of
death. In the Shaiva Siddhanta religious
community, pasha is also the name
given to Shiva’s power of illusion (maya),
through which he entraps and enthralls
unenlightened people (pashu). The triad
of pasha, pashu, and Shiva as lord (pati)
are the defining features of the Shaiva
Siddhanta school.
Pashu
(“beast”) In the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, and in the
secret, ritually based religious practice
known as tantra, the term for an unen-
lightened person, who is said to have a
human form but to be little better than
an animal. This lack of awareness
comes not just through inherent dull-
ness, but through the activity of maya,
the power of illusion wielded by Shiva
as lord (pati). The triad of pashu, pati
and the bonds of illusion (pasha) are
defining features of the Shaiva
Siddhanta school.
Pashupata
An extinct ascetic community, of devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva in his
form as Pashupati, “the Lord of Beasts.”
Although the Pashupatas have now dis-
appeared, according to the Chinese pil-
grim Hsuan Tsang they were once the
most important ascetic sect in northern
India. According to historical reports, its
members would engage in strange and
antisocial behavior intended to bring
disgrace upon themselves, although
without lust or malice in their hearts.
This practice was in imitation of one of
Shiva’s mythic tales, in which he
exposed himself to the wives of the
Sages in the Pine Forest but was without
desire for them. For further information
see Daniel H. H. Ingalls, “Cynics and
Pasupatas: The Seeking of Dishonor,” in
Harvard Theological Review, 55, 1962.
Pashupati
(“Lord of Beasts”) Epithet of the god
Shiva in his form as the “Lord of Beasts.”
See Shiva.
[[505]]
Pashupatinath
The Pashupatinath Temple in Katmandu, Nepal, is dedicated to the god Shiva
as “Master of the Lord of the Beasts.”
[[506]]

PashupatinathPatala
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in
Katmandu, Nepal. The temple is named
for its presiding deity, who is the god
Shiva in his form as Pashupatinath, “the
Master of the Lord of Beasts.” This is a
considered an extremely powerful site,
and one of its charter myths connects it
to Kedarnath, a sacred site high in the
Himalayas. According to the story, the
five Pandava brothers, who are the pro-
tagonists in the epic Mahabharata, are
making their final journey into the
Himalayas in search of a vision of
Shiva. They finally see him at a dis-
tance, but when they try to get closer,
Shiva takes the form of a bull and
begins running through the snow. The
bull burrows into a snow bank, and
when the Pandavas follow, they find the
body of the bull in the snow. The ridge
of rock that forms the Kedarnath linga
is considered to be the hump of this
bull. The bull’s head continues travel-
ing over the hills, eventually stopping
in Nepal, where it takes form as the
deity Pashupatinath.A generic name for the realms of the
underworld, traditionally numbered at
seven to parallel the seven heavens that
are believed to exist above the visible
world. These underworld realms are not
considered to be hells but rather planes
of existence other than the visible world,
populated by the Nagas and other non-
human beings.
Pataliputra
Capital city of the Mauryan empire,
identified with modern Patna, the
capital of Bihar state. See also
Maurya dynasty.
Patanjali
(2nd c. B.C.E.) Sanskrit grammarian
and author of the Mahabhashya
(“Great Commentary”) on Panini’s
Ashtadhyayi. Panini’s text was written
as a series of short phrases or aphorisms
intended to be a complete description of
the language in the briefest possible
space. Panini’s text was a marvel of
economy and was easy to memorize butPattuppattu
was so cryptic that it virtually presup-
posed a commentary, which Patanjali
provided. Patanjali’s Mahabhashya
is not only important for his explication
of Panini’s grammar, but also because
his examples often provide useful
historical information.
Patanjali is also the person named
as the author of the Yoga Sutras, but
since these are believed to have been
composed several centuries after
the Mahabhashya, the authors are
believed to be two different people
with the same name.
Pati
(“master”) In the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, the name
given to the god Shiva as the highest
being, who wields the noose (pasha) of
illusion to enthrall and bewilder unen-
lightened people (pashu). The triad of
pashu, pati and pasha are the defining
features of the Shaiva Siddhanta school.
Patita
(“fallen one”) In the dharma literature,
the term for someone who had commit-
ted one of the Four Great Crimes; mur-
dering a brahmin (brahmahatya),
stealing a brahmin’s gold (steya), drink-
ing liquor (surapana), and adultery
with one’s guru’s wife (gurutalpaga).
These crimes were considered so
heinous that the performer became an
outcast from society. Another indication
of the gravity of these acts was that their
expiations (prayashchitta) were so
severe they normally ended in death,
and in some cases this outcome was
specifically prescribed. Aside from pre-
scribing such punishments for the actual
offenders, the dharma literature also
prescribed similar outcast status for
anyone who knowingly associated with
such people for more than one year.
Pattadakal
Pattadakal was an important urban cen-
ter and a sister city to the Chalukya cap-
ital at Badami. Although nearly deserted
today, the site is important for a collec-
tion of temples built in a variety of archi-
tectural styles during that era. The
Virupaksha temple, dedicated in 740 C.E.
during the reign of King Vikramaditya,
clearly shows the influence of the south-
ern Indian Dravida architectural style: a
mostly low and extended profile, with a
series of terraced roofs over the main
sanctuary. It is believed to have been
modeled after the temples in the city of
Kanchipuram, which had been con-
quered by Vikramaditya, who brought
its architects and builders back to
Pattadakal with him. At the same time,
there are temples showing the early
development of the Nagara style, in
which the major architectural feature is
a series of upswept towers (shikharas),
with the tallest tower directly over the
image of the temple’s primary deity. The
best example of this is the Galaganatha
temple, dedicated to the god Shiva,
which has a tall vertical tower perched
on a larger, cube-shaped base.
Pattuppattu
(“Ten Songs”) Collective name for a
group of ten Tamil poems written in
the style of the eight anthologies of
the Sangam literature and believed to
have been composed later. The dates
for the literature are the subject of con-
troversy, but the prevalent scholarly
consensus is that it was written in the
early centuries of the common era. Like
this literature, the Pattuppattu songs
fall into two general genres, puram (“the
outer part”) and akam (“the inner part”).
Puram poetry was “public” verse,
describing the deeds of kings, war,
death, and other heroic actions, whereas
akam poetry was about an individual’s
inner experience, especially love and
sexuality. See also Tamil language and
Tamil epics.
Historical site in the state of Karnataka,
about twenty miles east of the city of
Badami. During the Chalukya dynasty,
[[507]]
Paush
PaushPerception
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Paush is the tenth month in
the lunar year, usually falling within
December and January. In northern
India, Paush is the coldest month of the
year. It is considered inauspicious, and
its only holidays are Saphala Ekadashi
and Putrada Ekadashi.In Hindu philosophy, perception
(pratyaksha) is universally accepted as
one of the pramanas, the means by
which human beings can gain true
and accurate knowledge. Perception
is the only pramana accepted by all
the schools, but most of the others
also accept inference (anumana)
and authoritative testimony (shabda).
See pratyaksha.
Peacock
Indian bird with several divine associa-
tions. It is the animal vehicle of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva, who is the
leader of the divine armies. The pea-
cock’s quickness and resplendent
appearance are felt to mirror these qual-
ities in the young god. The peacock also
has strong associations with the god
Krishna, who is usually depicted as
wearing a decorative crown containing
peacock feathers. This association may
come from the peacock’s connection
with the monsoon, which is the peacock
mating season, during which they utter
piercing calls in the forests and are
believed to dance with delight on the
hillsides. Krishna’s dark color often leads
to comparisons with rain clouds, and
like the peacock he spends his nights
dancing in the company of his devotees
(bhakta), in the celebration known as
the ras lila.
Penance
The dharma literature gave consider-
able attention to penance and expiation,
based on the almost universal Hindu
belief in the inexorable workings of
karma. According to this notion, all
good and bad deeds would eventually
have their effect, either in this life or the
next. Penances were a way to lessen the
future consequences of one’s past mis-
deeds, by undergoing voluntary suffer-
ing and expiation in one’s present life.
See prayashchitta.
[[508]]

Periyalvar
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. The Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life.
According to tradition, Periyalvar
was born into a brahmin family. From
his youth he showed deep piety, and his
primary means of devotion was to grow
and pick flowers for the image of his
chosen deity, Krishna. The most
famous story about Periyalvar tells of a
dream in which God commanded him to
take part in a scholarly debate to be held
by one of the Pandya kings. Periyalvar,
despite his reservations about his lack
of learning, obeyed this command after
he woke. When he spoke, the words
flowed out under divine inspiration, and
the bag containing the prize money flew
off the hook and into his hands as a sign
of his victory. For further information
see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature,
[[1975]]
; and John Stirling Morley Hooper,
Hymns of the Alvars, 1929. See also
Pandya dynasty.
Periya Puranam
Hagiographical account of the lives of
the sixty-three Nayanars, written by the
twelfth-century figure Cekkilar. The
Nayanars were a group of Shaiva poet-
saints, who lived in southern IndiaPhallic Emblem
between the seventh and ninth cen-
turies. Together with their Vaishnava
counterparts, the Alvars, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu
religion within Tamil Nadu, which was
mostly Buddhist and Jain. Both the
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god—Shiva for the Nayanars, Vishnu for
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage. According to tradition, Cekkilar
was a minister at the court of the Chola
dynasty king Kullottunga II (r. 1130–50).
Cekkilar, distressed by the king’s admi-
ration for a Jain epic poem, composed
his text in an effort to wean the king
away from it. His text portrays these
saints as models of devotion to Shiva
and as salutary examples to others
although at times extreme in their devo-
tion. One example of this intense devo-
tion is Kotpuli Nayanar, who killed his
entire family when he discovered that,
in order to save their lives in a time of
famine, they had eaten rice that
belonged to Shiva’s temple. Although
this is an extreme case, the message is
clearly that devotion to God must
eclipse all other loyalties.
Peshwa
Originally, title given to the brahmin
ministers who served as advisers to the
kings in the Maratha empire.
Traditionally, these ministers were
Chitpavan brahmins, which gave this
small group influence far disproportion-
ate to its numbers. During the resur-
gence of the Maratha confederacy in the
early eighteenth century, the Peshwas
became de facto rulers, although they
continued to govern in the name of the
Maratha kings. At this time, the position
of Peshwa became hereditary. After the
Maratha confederation split into differ-
ent royal states around 1770, the
Peshwas retained control over the
ancestral Maratha homeland in the
western part of the state of
Maharashtra, where they reigned until
it was conquered by the British in 1818.
Pey
(7th c.) With Bhutam and Poygai, one of
the first three Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All Alvars were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu, and their stress on
passionate devotion (bhakti) to a per-
sonal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, transformed
and revitalized Hindu religious life.
According to tradition, the three men
were caught in a torrential storm and
one by one took shelter in a small dry
spot, with each making room for the
next. As they stood next to one another
they felt a fourth presence, that of
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy was
sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s manifesta-
tion. Overwhelmed with ecstasy, each
burst into song, which formed the first of
each of their compositions. For further
information see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil
Literature, 1975.
Phalgun
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Phalgun is the twelfth
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within February and March. Phalgun
concludes with the festival of Holi,
which is the unofficial end of the cool
season. The other holidays in Phalgun
are Janaki Navami, Vijaya Ekadashi,
Shivaratri, and Amalaki Ekadashi.
Phallic Emblem
Designation for the linga, the pillar-
shaped object that is the symbolic form
of the god Shiva. The precise sculptural
form of the Gudimallam linga, which
dates from at least the second century
B.C.E., leaves little doubt that this phallic
element is one aspect of the symbol.
What is often overlooked is that an
equally important part of the linga’s
image is the base (pitha) in which
the shaft is placed, said to represent
the female organs of generation. In his
[[509]]
Philosophy
symbolic form Shiva is thus both male
and female—an appropriate form for a
deity who is famous for transcending
any and all duality.
Philosophy
The Euro-American conception that
there is a fundamental distinction
between philosophy and religion
reflects unique historical and cultural
circumstances that have no parallel in
many other cultures. The Western philo-
sophical tradition is rooted in Greek
thought and culture, whereas Western
religious traditions primarily have been
shaped by ideas coming out of the
Jewish tradition. The ideas from these
two different sources developed side by
side in Western culture, sometimes in an
uneasy alliance and sometimes at odds
but they were always seen as separate. In
many other cultures, this distinction does
not exist, and such imported concepts
become less helpful in encountering
these cultures. Indian and Hindu culture
have a long history of critical and specula-
tive thought, which could be called philo-
sophical. Yet such thought is never
exercised simply for its own sake, but
always with an underlying religious pur-
pose—to enable one to gain the ultimate
religious goal, final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The different perspectives on
how to do this, known as darshans, are
usually designated as “philosophical
schools.” See also six schools.
Although these edicts were found in
widely separated places, the text in each
edict was fairly consistent throughout
the Mauryan empire. The pillar edicts
were inscribed on pillars of polished
Chunar sandstone and placed on the
major roads running through the
empire, where they would have been
visible to passersby. In this respect they
were different from the rock edicts,
which were carved into large boulders in
places near the borders of the Mauryan
empire, thus symbolically defining its
boundaries. See also Maurya dynasty.
Pinaka
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
archery bow belonging to the god Shiva.
Pinda
(“lump”) A ball of cooked rice or other
grain, one of the important objects used
in rites for the dead. A pinda is offered to
the departed spirit each day for the first
ten days after death, in the belief that
the ten pindas progressively help form a
new body for the dead person (a sec-
ondary meaning of the word pinda is
“body”). Pindas are also used in the
memorial rite known as shraddha,
which can be performed years after the
actual death; in this rite, the performer
offers pindas to his or her ancestors as
symbolic nourishment.

Pillar Edicts
Set of inscriptions commissioned by the
Mauryan emperor Ashoka (r. 269–32
B.C.E.), containing official pronounce-
ments on royal policy, and advice and
instructions to his subjects on a variety
of topics, including religious toleration.
[[510]]

(“giving pindas”) In general usage, a syn-
onym for the memorial rite known as
shraddha. It is given this name because
an important element in shraddha is
offering the balls of cooked grain,
known as pindas, considered symbolic
nourishment for the ancestors.
Pindara River
A Himalayan tributary of the Ganges.
The Pindara River flows west from the
Pindari glacier and joins the
Alakananda River at the town of
Karnaprayag. As with all the HimalayanPitha
tributaries of the Ganges, the Pindara is
considered sacred along its length, but
this region is so mountainous and so
thinly settled that Karnaprayag is the
river’s only noteworthy spot.
Pingala Nadi
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conception of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter, but
with certain correspondences to the
material body. It is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are the bodily abodes of the two
divine principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini. In
this model of the subtle body, the pin-
gala nadi is the vertical channel on the
right side of the body. As with the rest of
the subtle body, the pingala nadi has
certain symbolic correspondences; in
particular, it is identified with the sun
and is thus visualized as being a tawny
red in color.
goddess Bhavani (an epithet of Parvati),
showing the breadth of the Sant tradi-
tion. A few of Pipa’s verses have been
preserved in the Adigranth, the sacred
text of the Sikh community, and in their
language and religious thrust the verses
are consistent with these traditions.
Pipal
Common name for Ficus religiosa, the
fig-tree also known as the ashvattha,
which has a long history of being con-
sidered a sacred tree. See ashvattha.
Pippalada
In Hindu traditional lore, one of the
ancient sages in the Atharva Veda, one
of the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Pippalada is also mentioned in the
Prashna Upanishad, one of the specula-
tive religious texts that forms the latest
part of the Vedas, as a religious teacher
who instructs sages such as Sukesha,
Kashyapa, and Bhargava. Pippalada
supposedly gets his name from his
fondness for Pippali fruits, the fruit
of the Ficus religiosa, the sacred pipal
(ashvattha).
Pitambara
Pipa
(15th c.?) Poet-saint in the Sant religious
community. The name Sant is an
umbrella term for a group of central and
northern Indian poet-saints who share
several general tendencies: focus on
individualized, interior religion leading
to a personal experience of the divine;
disdain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of
repeating one’s patron deity’s name; and
the tendency to ignore conventional
caste distinctions.
According to tradition, Pipa was born
into a Rajput royal family in the Malwa
region but eventually renounced his
throne and went to Benares to become a
disciple of the poet-saint Ramananda.
The hagiographer Nabhadas reports
that Pipa was a disciple of the powerful
(“clothed in yellow”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, because of his penchant for
wearing yellow garments. See Krishna.
Pitavasana
(“yellow-clad”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, because of his penchant for
wearing yellow garments. See Krishna.
Pitha
(“bench”) In its widest meaning, the
base or foundation of any object. It can
denote the material base or foundation
upon which the image of a deity is
placed. In some cases the foundation
becomes an integral part of the image
itself, as in the linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is the symbol of the god
Shiva. The form of the linga, an upright
[[511]]
Pitr
During Pitrpaksha, Hindus offer rice balls and water to their ancestors.
shaft set in a horizontal base, represents,
not only the union of male and female,
but also their transcendence, since
Shiva is both male and female at once.
At a more symbolic level, a pitha can be
the “seat” or residence of a particular
deity, that is, the place at which the deity
metaphorically sits. The best example of
this is the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess, spread
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking up residence in each
place as a different goddess.
Pitr
(“father”) Any and all ancestral spirits,
to whom funerary offerings are due as
one of a man’s expected duties. See
ancestral spirits.
Pitrpaksha
The fortnight (paksha) dedicated to the
worship of the ancestral spirits (pitr),
observed in the dark (waning) half of the
[[512]]

lunar month of Ashvin. This is the period
during the year in which Hindus
remember and give offerings for their
dead: offerings of water and rice-balls
(pinda) on each day of the fortnight, and
as well as special observances on the
day of the fortnight corresponding to
the day of the ancestor’s death. These
offerings are believed to sustain the
dead by symbolically feeding them, and
also to placate the dead by demonstrat-
ing that the living still remember and
care for them.
Because of its strong connection
with the dead, this fortnight is generally
considered an inauspicious time, and
people often restrict their everyday
activities in symbolic recognition of it.
Many people will not cut their hair,
beards, or nails during this time, nor will
they wear new clothes. These precau-
tions stem from the conviction that
making alterations in one’s appearance
during an inauspicious time will have
adverse future affects, since it will carry
the taint forward. Many people also cur-
tail other normal activities during thisPlanets
time, such as buying any article or initi-
ating any new project, unless it is
absolutely necessary. The period is also
deemed a good time for religious obser-
vances, particularly giving gifts (dana)
to brahmins. On the one hand this is a
way to propitiate the ancestors, whom
the brahmins represent, and thus what-
ever is given to brahmins is given sym-
bolically to the ancestors. On the other
hand, giving such gifts is also a rite of
protection against misfortune in an
inauspicious time, since the receiver is
believed to take away the bad luck along
with the gift.
Pitryajna
(“sacrifice to the ancestors”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the dharma literature, the
texts on religious duty. These Five Great
Sacrifices are daily observances for a
“twice-born” householder, that is, one
who has been born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—and
who has received the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” Each of the five sacrifices (yajna)
is directed toward a different class of
beings—from the Absolute Reality down
to animals—and is satisfied by different
actions. The pitryajna is directed toward
one’s ancestors, and is satisfied by offer-
ing them libations of water (tarpana). In
the time since the dharma literature was
composed Hindu life has undergone
significant changes, and some of these
five rites have been completely elided.
Although in certain contexts pitryajna is
still an important rite—particularly at
pilgrimage sites and in formal rites for
the dead—it is no longer performed on a
daily basis.
Pitta
(“bile”) Along with vata (“air”) and
kapha (“phlegm”), one of the three
humours (tridosha) in ayurveda, or
traditional Indian medicine. Every per-
son has all three of these humours, but
usually one is predominant, and this
marks a person in certain ways, particu-
larly with regard to health, digestion,
and metabolism. Pitta is associated with
the elements of fire and water, since
bile is a liquid involved in digestion,
which is believed to take place through
interior burning. Pitta is hot, intense,
and mobile, and those for whom this is
the predominant humor are said to have
a strong will, be good leaders, and be
blessed with good digestion. At the same
time, this inner fire gives them bodily
difficulties in hot weather, and to do
their best they must also learn how to
harness their fiery temperaments.
Plakshadvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the sec-
ond of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Planets
Indian astrology (jyotisha) recognizes
nine planets that affect human beings:
the five visible ones (Jupiter, Venus,
Mercury, Saturn, and Mars), the Sun
and Moon, and two planets not known
to Western astrology, Rahu and Ketu. Of
these, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury are,
by themselves, always benevolent. The
moon is changeable, depending on its
position in the lunar cycle, and the oth-
ers are considered to have malefic ten-
dencies, although only Rahu and Ketu
are invariably malevolent. Rahu and
Ketu move throughout the zodiac, but
the others are all fixed in place. Each of
the planets is part of an elaborate series
of associations, including parts of the
body, family relationships, and personal
qualities. The influence of all these
planets can be heightened or weakened
according to their position in a person’s
natal horoscope, or their position vis-à-
vis the other planets. The astrological
tradition also recognizes a practice
known as pacification of planets,
through which their good qualities
can be heightened, or their malevolent
[[513]]
Pole Star
qualities weakened and contained. This
can be done either through wearing par-
ticular gemstones that are believed to
correspond to these planets, or by per-
forming certain protective rituals.
Pole Star
In Hindu mythology, the personified
form of the boy Dhruva, who is a symbol
for unrelenting pursuit of a goal. Dhruva
is a king’s son, but for some unknown
reason his father favors Dhruva’s half-
brother over him. Distressed by this
insult, Dhruva takes a vow to attain a
place above all others and goes off to the
forest to perform austerities (tapas).
After Dhruva endures many bodily mor-
tifications, the god Vishnu appears and
grants him a boon. In response to
Dhruva’s request for a place above all
others, Vishnu promises Dhruva that
after his death he will be installed as the
Pole Star, the pivot around which all the
other stars in the sky will turn.
Pollution
In Hindu religious life, a term designat-
ing religious contamination and ritual
impurity (ashaucha). This notion of
impurity is strictly concerned with the
presence or absence of contamination
and carries no necessary sense of moral
or ethical lapse. See ashaucha.
Polyandry
Having more than one husband. This
practice is extremely uncommon in
Indian society, either now or in the past.
The best-known mythical example
comes from the epic Mahabharata, in
which Draupadi is married to all five of
the Pandava brothers, the epic’s protag-
onists. Textual scholars have argued that
this type of marriage was so unusual
that it must have been rooted in some
ancient practice, but there is no proof
for this claim. In contemporary times
polyandry can be found only at the
outer fringes of Hindu society, such as in
the state of Assam and in some of the
Himalayan regions, where traditional
[[514]]

practices have allowed for one woman
to marry several brothers, following
Draupadi’s example.
Polygamy
Given the overwhelmingly patriarchal
character of Hindu society, polygamy
has probably existed since very early
times. The practice is attested in both
the great epics, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, as well as in the histori-
cal record. The dharma literature
permits men to marry wives of lower
social status, under the condition that
their first wife was of equal status.
Despite the existence of polygamy,
it was probably unusual and restricted
to men of high status and financial
resources, who would be able to support
several families. For “regular” men,
one of the few reasons for taking a sec-
ond wife was when the first wife was
unable to bear children, in an attempt to
sire the sons needed to preserve the
lineage and ensure performance of the
ancestral rites.
Pongal
Southern Indian harvest festival mark-
ing the change of seasons and the tran-
sition of the sun into the zodiacal sign of
Capricorn, and thus beginning its
northward
course
(uttarayana).
According to Indian astrology this usually
takes place on January 14th; in northern
India this day is celebrated as Makara
Sankranti. Both mark the sun’s change
in motion from the southerly direction
to the northerly, or from the direction
considered less auspicious to the one
considered more auspicious.
The festivities for Pongal last for
three days. The first day is the Pongal of
Joy (Bhogi Pongal), on which people
visit and exchange sweets and gifts. The
second day is dedicated to the Sun
(Surya Pongal). On this day married
women cook rice in milk, and when the
pot comes to a boil they shout “Pongal”
(“It has boiled”). The milk-rice is made
into sweets, which is first offered to thePrabhakara
Sun and to the god Ganesh, and
then given to friends. On the final day,
Pongal of Cows (Mattu Pongal),
worshipers walk in a circle around cows
while the cows are decorated, garlanded,
and worshiped.
Possession
Possession by gods, ghosts, and spirits is
an accepted element in the traditional
Hindu worldview, although whether this
is good or bad depends on the nature of
the being responsible. Possession is the
most common means for village deities
and certain forms of the Goddess to
communicate with human beings,
although the highest gods in the pan-
theon virtually never use this medium.
Possession by a deity can bring a person
high religious status but is generally said
to be physically exhausting; through
the medium the deities can interact
with human beings, both to make their
wishes known and to give their help and
advice to those who need it. One of the
more unusual cases of this occurs at the
annual pilgrimage at Kataragama in Sri
Lanka. Devotees (bhakta) suspend
themselves from trees by hooks stuck
into the flesh of their backs and, while
suspended, are believed to be speaking
for the god Murugan.
Possession by departed spirits (bhut
or pret) or by witches and other malefic
beings is always seen as an inopportune
event and a dangerous imposition on
the sufferer that must be remedied as
soon as possible through healing or
exorcism. As Sudhir Kakar masterfully
shows, the language of possession and
exorcism can be interpreted as an
“idiom,” using traditional Indian cultural
categories, for what modern psychia-
trists might call the diagnosis and treat-
ment of mental illness. For further
information see Sudhir Kakar, Shamans,
Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Poygai
(7th c.) With Pey and Bhutam, one of the
first three Alvars, a group of twelve poet-
saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
passionate devotion (bhakti) to a per-
sonal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, trans-
formed and revitalized Hindu religious
life. According to tradition, the three
men were caught in a torrential storm
and, one by one, took shelter in a small
dry spot, with each making room for the
next. As they stood next to one another,
they felt a fourth presence, who was
Vishnu. The alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy
was sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s mani-
festation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,
each burst into song, which formed the
first of each of their compositions. For
further information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975.
Prabhakara
In Indian philosophy, one of the two
great seventh-century commentators in
the Purva Mimamsa school, one of the
six schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy; the other great commentator was
Kumarila. The Mimamsa school was
most concerned with the examination
and pursuit of dharma (“righteous
action”), the Mimamsa school believed
all necessary instructions were con-
tained in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts. Much of Mimamsa
thought is concerned with principles
and methods for textual interpretation
seeking to uncover and interpret these
instructions. Although both Kumarila
and Prabhakara were committed to dis-
covering the boundaries of dharma by
interpreting the Vedas, there are signifi-
cant differences in their philosophical
positions, seen most clearly in their
theories of error.
Prabhakara believes in a concept
similar to the Nyaya concept of inher-
ence (samavaya), a weak relational
force that is assumed to connect objects
and their attributes—for example, con-
necting the color red with a particular
[[515]]
Prabhupada, A.C. Bhaktivedanta
ball, thus making the ball red. This
assumption leads him to characterize
error as akhyati (“nondiscrimination”),
the inability to make sharp distinctions.
For example, a person mistakes the sil-
very flash of sea shell for a piece of silver.
To Prabhakara, the person errs by
uncritically connecting two simple judg-
ments: “that object is silvery” and “silver
is silvery.” By themselves, both of these
statements are true, what is false is their
combination into the complex judg-
ment “that object is silver.” Kumarila is
closer to the bhedabhada (“identity-
and-difference”) philosophical position,
which holds that all things both identify
with and differ from all other things.
Kumarila explains error as viparitakhyati,
the mistaken pairing of the similarities
between two things, rather than the
failure to note their differences.
Prabhupada, A.C. Bhaktivedanta
(b. Abhay Charan De, 1896–1977)
Devotee (bhakta) of the god Krishna
and founder of ISKCON (International
Society for Krishna Consciousness),
more popularly known as the Hare
Krishnas. ISKCON has its roots in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community
founded by the Bengali saint Chaitanya,
in which the primary religious action
was the repeated recitation of Krishna’s
name, often in public settings.
Prabhupada was initiated into Krishna
devotion in his university years, at
which time his guru commanded him to
bring the worship of Krishna to the
West. At the age of 58, after a successful
career as a pharmacist, he boarded a
steamer for the United States, arriving
with a few books, a typewriter, and eight
dollars in his pocket. His timing was
exquisite—or, as he put it, reflected
Krishna’s grace—for he came during
the countercultural movement in the
second half of the 1960s; by the time of
his death he had thousands of followers.
In his later years he focused on translat-
ing and commenting on important
Vaishnava texts, particularly the
Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata
[[516]]

Purana, and this emphasis on publish-
ing has continued after his death.
For an insider’s perspective on his life,
see Satsvarupdas Dasa Goswami,
Prabhupada, 1983; and Robert D. Baird,
“Swami Bhaktivedanta and Ultimacy,”
in Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in
Modern India, 1998.
Prabodhachandrodaya
(“Rising of the moon of wisdom”)
Sanskrit drama written by Krishna-
mishra, probably in the latter half of
the eleventh century. Clearly allegori-
cal, the play celebrates the triumph of
Vaishnava piety, that is, of the devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. The play is
particularly notable for its third act, in
which representatives for four non-
Vaishnava sects appear: a materialist, a
Jain monk, a Buddhist monk, and a
Kapalika (a member of an ascetic com-
munity that worshiped the god Shiva).
The last is portrayed as thoroughly
depraved, indulging in meat, wine, and
sexual gratification, and having a pen-
chant for violence. In the play, all four
heretical characters plot to capture
another character, named Faith, for
their king, named Passion. However,
they discover that Faith is a devotee of
Vishnu and is outside their powers. In
the end Faith is reunited with her son
Tranquillity and a character named
Compassion. Although the reader may
safely assume that this play is written
from a biased perspective, it is instruc-
tive in the attitudes it reveals toward
ascetics and all other non-Vaishnava
religious groups.
Pracharak
(“director”) In the Rashtriya Svayam-
sevak Sangh (RSS), a conservative Hindu
organization whose express purpose is
to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India, the pracharaks
are the full-time RSS workers who pro-
vide the link between the local units,
known as shakhas (“branches”), and the
RSS higher authorities. The RSS is a highlyPradakshina
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada was the founder of ISKCON,
a religious community devoted to the god Krishna that is popularly known as the Hare Krishnas.
authoritarian organization, with all
power ultimately vested in a single,
unelected leader, the sarsanghchalak,
and the pracharaks are the crucial link
between this highly centralized leader-
ship and the highly decentralized local
units. The pracharaks are responsible
for coordinating and managing RSS
activities in their area, as well as for
reporting on these at RSS meetings at
various levels; they may also be sent out
on loan to provide leadership to RSS-
affiliated organizations. As a rule,
pracharaks are completely devoted to
the RSS cause, and most have been asso-
ciated with the RSS since childhood.
Their ethos is one of service and sacri-
fice to the RSS, and by implication to the
country as a whole: They are generally
unmarried, have no other employment,
receive no salary from the RSS (although
the local unit generally provides their
living expenses), and are famous for liv-
ing a simple and spartan lifestyle. Most
of them are also well educated and are
selected for their ability to get along
well with others. For further informa-
tion see Walter K. Andersen and
Shridhar D. Damle, The Brotherhood in
Saffron, 1987; and Daniel Gold,
“Organized Hinduisms: From Vedic
Truth to Hindu Nation,” in Martin Marty
and R. Scott Appleby (eds.), Funda-
mentalisms Observed, 1991.
Pradakshina
(“toward the right”) Circumambulation
of an object or person as a sign of wor-
ship, reverence, or respect. This is
always done in a clockwise direction, so
that the walker’s right side (considered
the purer and more auspicious side) is
always turned toward the object or per-
son being circled. Just about anything
can be so circled—one’s parents or
teacher, the image of a deity, a temple,
a city, or the entire Indian subconti-
nent. In many larger temples, particu-
larly in the Nagara architectural style,
the pradakshina is the name for one of
the architectural features. In this case,
it is a semicircular processional pas-
sageway surrounding the temple’s
main image, so that people can cir-
cumambulate the main image either
before or after worship. Pradakshina is
also the fifteenth of the sixteen tradi-
tional upacharas (“offerings”) given to
[[517]]
Pradhana
a deity as part of worship, on the model
of treating the deity as an honored
guest. The underlying motive here, as
for all the upacharas, is to show one’s
love for the deity and to minister to the
deity’s needs as one would to a living
person’s needs.
Pradhana
(“principal”) In the Samkhya philo-
sophical school, pradhana is another
name for prakrti, the “primal matter”
that the Samkhyas consider the first
principle from which all material things
have evolved. In the secret, ritually
based religious practice known as
tantra, the word pradhana is used to
denote the goddess Shakti, as the active
principle behind the formation of the
universe. Grammatically, the word is
feminine, indicating a connotation of
fertility and fecundity.
Pradosh Vrat
(“twilight vow”) Religious observance
celebrated on the thirteenth day of each
lunar fortnight, mainly by women, often
for the birth of children or to sustain the
general family welfare. The vow (vrat) is
dedicated to the god Shiva, and its most
important part takes place on the
evening of the thirteenth day (the word
pradosh is interpreted as meaning “twi-
light”) when worshipers present Shiva
with the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas), following which they may
take their only meal of the day. In
some cases worshipers stay awake
through the night so that the observance
may finish on the fourteenth day of
the month, a lunar day connected
with Shiva. When the thirteenth day
falls on a Monday (associated with
Shiva), Saturday (associated with
Saturn), or Sunday (associated with
the Sun), this rite is believed to be
especially efficacious.
Pradyumna
In Hindu mythology, the son of the god
Krishna and his divine queen Rukmini.
[[518]]

Pradyumna is the rebirth of the god
Kama, who has been completely annihi-
lated by the fire from the god Shiva’s
third eye. After Kama’s death, Shiva reas-
sures Kama’s wife Rati that her husband
will be reborn as Pradyumna to kill the
demon Sambhara. Through his magic
powers Sambhara is well aware of the
threat; when he finds the child, he
throws it into the ocean and thinks that
he has killed it. Pradyumna is swallowed
by a great fish, which is caught and pre-
sented to king Sambhara; when the fish
is split open, the child enchants his wife
Mayavati, in whose form Rati has taken
birth to aid her husband. Pradyumna
kills Sambhara in a ferocious battle and
is reunited with Rati.
Prahlada
In Hindu mythology, the son of the
demon-king Hiranyakashipu, and a
great devotee (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. Through harsh physical asceti-
cism (tapas) Hiranyakashipu has gained
a series of divine boons that render him
virtually invulnerable, yet despite his
power, his son Prahlada refuses to aban-
don his devotion to Vishnu. Prahlada’s
devotion in the face of his father’s ever-
growing pride generates an escalating
pattern of abuse that culminates in the
demand that Prahlada worship him
rather than Vishnu. At that point Vishnu
comes to Prahlada’s aid as the Man-lion
avatar, slays Hiranyakashipu, and
establishes Prahlada as king in his place.
Prajapati
(“Lord of Creatures”) Deity appearing
late in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
sacred texts, who is described as the
creator of the universe and is consid-
ered superior to the Vedic deities. The
means by which Prajapati carries out
creation are different in different
places. In Rg Veda 10.121 he is
described as the Golden Embryo from
which all things developed, whereas in
Rg 10.90, also known as the Purusha
Sukta, he is described as the primal personPrakashatman
(purusha) who is sacrificed by the gods
and from whose parts the world devel-
ops. In later Hindu practice the name
Prajapati can also be used to refer to the
god Brahma, as fashioner of the uni-
verse, or to the gods Vishnu or Shiva, as
the universe’s supreme deities.
Prajapatya Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty. In
Hindu mythology Prajapati was the
name of the creator, and this name sug-
gests that the purpose of this marriage
was for people to fulfill their duties to
the ancestors by procreating. A
Prajapatya marriage takes place when a
father gives away his daughter to a man
with the condition that they will per-
form their civic and religious duties
together. This was one of the four
approved (prashasta) forms of mar-
riage, because it was arranged by the
girl’s father. However, it was considered
less commendable than the other
approved forms, because the girl was
given in marriage with conditions. In
Indian culture, the best way to give a
daughter is to impose no conditions. See
also marriage, eight classical forms.
Prajnanam Brahman
(“Wisdom is Brahman”) In the Hindu
philosophical tradition, one of the “great
utterances” (mahavakyas) expressing
the ultimate truth. The truth here is the
identity of prajnanam (ultimate wis-
dom) and Brahman (Supreme Reality);
this identity is the heart of the specula-
tive texts called the Upanishads. Aside
from their importance in a philosophi-
cal context, as encapsulating funda-
mental truths, the four mahavakyas
were also appropriated as identifying
symbols by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics. Each divi-
sion had a different mahavakya, just as
each had a different Veda, a different
primary monastic center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Prajnanam
Brahman is the mahavakya associated
with the Bhogawara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.
Prakamyam
(“irresistible will”) One of the eight
superhuman powers (siddhi) tradition-
ally believed to be conferred by high
spiritual attainment. This particular
power removes all obstructions to the
movement of one’s body, such that one
can go wherever one desires, even pass-
ing through solid objects as if moving
through water.
Prakasha
(“illumination”) In Hindu tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
prakasha is one of the bipolar oppo-
sites that are used to characterize the
nature of all reality, with its counter-
part being reflection (vimarsha).
These two terms are particularly
important for the creation of the world,
which is said to happen when the pure
and radiant consciousness (prakasha)
of the ultimate Brahman becomes
self-conscious through the reflection
(vimarsha) of this original conscious-
ness. From one single consciousness,
the absolute then evolves into a binary
divinity—the god Shiva and his con-
sort Shakti—whose continued interac-
tion combines to create the world. For
further information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982. See
also cosmology.
Prakashatman
(13th c.) Proponent of the Advaita
Vedanta school, one of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy. Praka-
shatman’s Vivarana, a commentary on
the work of the Advaita philosopher
Padmapada, provides the name for the
Vivarana school of Advaita Vedanta.
Prakashatman is traditionally described
as Padmapada’s disciple, but since the
latter is an attested pupil of Shanka-
racharya (9th c. C.E.), the time difference
makes this unlikely.
[[519]]
Prakrit
Since Brahman is believed to be the
locus of all things, Vivarana Advaitins
conclude that ignorance must also be a
part of Brahman. However, they try to
maintain Brahman’s integrity by invok-
ing a theory of reflectionism to explain
the apparent difference between Self
and Brahman, even though they are ulti-
mately identical. Just as an image
appearing in a mirror is based on the
original but different from it, so human
Selves are identical with Brahman but
appear to be separate. The basic posi-
tion of the Vivarana school is an uncom-
promising affirmation of Brahman as
the sole “reality,” in which anything that
exists must belong to it.
Prakrit
(“formed”) Collective term for the gram-
matically simpler vernacular languages
that developed from Sanskrit through
the natural process of linguistic change.
The existence of Prakrits is evident as
early as the fifth century B.C.E., at which
time several different dialects are spo-
ken. The Prakrits were contrasted with
Sanskrit (“perfected”), the language of
temple, court, and other elite contexts,
which was subject to strict grammatical
canons and did not change. Even those
fluent in Sanskrit would have learned it
as a second language—as a static,
learned language, it is inherently artifi-
cial—and would have spoken in Prakrit
with lower status people (such as ser-
vants, commoners, and most women).
Despite its “lower” status, Prakrits are
vitally important historically: They were
the languages for royal inscriptions up
to the Gupta era (ca. 350–550), and one
of the Prakrits, Pali, is famous as the lan-
guage for the Theravada Buddhist
canon. See also Gupta dynasty.
Prakrti
(“nature”) One of the two fundamental
principles in the Samkhya school, the
other being purusha (“person”).
Samkhya espouses an atheistic philo-
sophical dualism, in which purusha and
[[520]]

prakrti—roughly, spirit and nature—are
the source of all things. Prakrti is better
conceived of as force or power rather
than a specific material object. It con-
tains within it three different forces with
three different qualities (guna): sattva
tends toward the good, rajas towards
activity or passion, and tamas towards
darkness and decay. In the primal
prakrti these forces are in perfect equi-
librium, each perfectly balancing the
others, but when prakrti’s equilibrium
is disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern
of evolution that creates both the exte-
rior physical world and the interior
psychological world. All of these evo-
lutes—material or psychic—have a dif-
fering balance of the three gunas,
which ultimately determines their
character as wholesome, active, or
unwholesome. For further information

Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya, 1987;
and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Pralaya
In Hindu mythology, the dissolution of
the universe that comes at the end of the
kalpa or Day of Brahma. Pralaya is con-
sidered the “night” of Brahma, and lasts
for the same amount of time as the day
(by one estimate, 4.32 billion years). The
approach of this “night” is preceded by
the destruction of the earth, first by fire,
and then by torrential rains that trans-
form the entire planet into one vast
ocean. During this time the only living
thing is the god Vishnu, who reclines on
the back of his serpent vehicle Shesha,
deep in a yogic trance. When the time
again comes for creation, a lotus sprouts
from his navel, which opens to reveal
Brahma, and the world begins anew.
Pramana
In Indian philosophy, a means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge, generally classified
as one of three types: PerceptionPrana
Pramukh Swami, the present spiritual leader of the Swaminarayan religious community.
(pratyaksha), which includes magical or
yogic insight as well as direct sensory
perception; inference (anumana),
which ultimately depends upon direct
experience; and testimony (shabda),
which can be either scriptural or the
instruction of one’s teacher. Some philo-
sophical schools also include a fourth
source, analogy (upamana), but those
who do not recognize this categorize it
as another form of inference. The first
three are accepted by all philosophical
schools except for the materialists, who
recognize only perception. The Purva
Mimamsa school affirms two additional
pramanas—presumption (arthapatti),
and knowledge from absence (abhava)—
which they argue give one knowledge.
The root meaning of this term comes
from the verb “to measure”; thus these
are tools for measuring and interpreting
the world we experience.
Pramukh Swami
(“President Swami,” b. 1921) Title of
Shastri Narayanswarupdas Swami, the
present spiritual leader of the
Swaminarayan religious community.
Swaminarayan Hinduism is based on
the life and teachings of Sahajananda
Swami (1781–1830), who because of his
piety and charisma was deemed by his
followers an avatar of the god Vishnu.
Pramukh Swami is the uncontested
head of the Akshar Purushottam
Samstha, a branch of the Swaminarayan
movement that separated from the par-
ent group in 1906. He is a strict ascetic
who serves as religious teacher (guru) to
an estimated million followers all over
the world. His devotees (bhakta) are
predominately members of the Gujarati
community and mostly affluent mer-
chants, making the movement finan-
cially robust.
Prana
(“breath”) As a collective noun, the
name for the five “winds” considered to
be responsible for basic bodily func-
tions. The first of these, located in the
chest, is labeled by the general term
prana. Because it performs those func-
tions necessary for sustaining life—res-
piration, the movement of food into the
stomach, and the circulation of blood
through the body—its name is often
used to designate all five winds. Of the
other four winds, apana (in the anal
region) is concerned with elimination,
[[521]]
Pranapratishtha
samana (in the navel) aids digestion,
udana (in the throat) conveys things out
of the mouth—like speech, song, burps,
etc.—and vyana circulates throughout
the body, mixing things together. These
winds are the focus of the yoga exercise
known as pranayama, the aim of which
is to achieve control over the central
forces of life.
Pranapratishtha
(“establishing the prana”) Pranapratishtha
is the final rite in the consecration of a
deity’s image, usually performed by
brahmins, since they have the necessary
ritual purity and training. The image is
infused with the breath of life (prana)
through the performance of ritual and
the intoning of sacred sounds known as
mantras. After this rite is performed, the
deity is believed to be resident in the
image, which thereafter must be treated
with the care such a spiritual entity
requires.
Prapatti
(“throwing oneself down”) Prapatti
refers to a devotee’s (bhakta) complete
surrender to God’s power as the only
means of salvation. This attitude is
particularly stressed among the
Shrivaishnavas, a southern Indian
religious community who are followers
of the god Vishnu and whose founder
was the great philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.). Although ultimate power is
believed to be vested in God’s grace by
the practitioners of prapatti, believers
nevertheless possess a concern for
continuing religious practice. Thus,
prapatti is not meant to replace conven-
tional religious activities such as wor-
ship. These activities are still performed,
but with the consciousness that God’s
grace will be sufficient. They are there-
fore not seen as a means toward salva-
tion, but as reflections of the grace one
has already obtained.
Prapti
Pranava
Name denoting the sacred sound Om.
See Om.
Pranayama
(“restraint of breath”) In the ashtanga
(“eight-part”) yoga first codified by
Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), pranayama is
the fourth of the eight constituent
elements of yoga practice. Pranayama
requires a conscious control of respir-
ation, specifically halting one’s breath-
ing before inhaling and exhaling.
When both of these actions have
become automatic, this is described as
“total” restraint. This practice is sup-
posed to weaken and destroy the prac-
titioner’s unwholesome karma, and
render the mind fit for concentration.
Removing karma is necessary for liber-
ation of the soul, since all karma (both
good and bad) ties one to the cycle of
birth and rebirth.
[[522]]

(“acquisition”) One of the eight super-
human powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred by high spiritual
attainment. This particular power gives
one the ability to gain any object simply
by desiring it.
Prarthana Samaj
Hindu reformist organization centered
in Bombay, whose most important fig-
ure was M. G. Ranade (1842–1901). The
Prarthana Samaj’s reformist mission
focused more on social issues than on
theological or worship-related ones.
Their primary aim was to rid Hindu
society of “evils” such as child marriage
and the ban on widow remarriage.
Although its members were educated
and progressive, they were also reli-
giously conservative and devout Hindus
with deep roots in the tradition. They
saw their work as a slow and gradual
process of reforming Hinduism by
removing its most objectionable prac-
tices rather than by radically remaking it
from start. In this they differed from thePrashna (“Question”) Upanishad
Brahmo Samaj, who attempted to
remake the tradition wholesale by
giving it a strong, quasi-monotheistic
emphasis, a quality heavily influenced
by European missionaries. The
Prarthana Samaj lost its steam by
the early 1920s, when social reform
associations became absorbed into the
Indian National Congress.
Prasad
(“favor”) Prasad is food or drink that has
been offered to a deity as part of normal
worship and, having been sanctified by
the deity’s power, is later distributed to
worshipers as a symbol of the deity’s
grace. In this process, the deity is
believed to have “consumed” part of the
food offering, and thus—in keeping
with everyday ideas about the contami-
nating power of saliva—to have
“imprinted” the food with its substance.
Since this substance has been “charged”
with divine presence, it is given to devo-
tees (bhakta) as an emblem of the
deity’s grace, and worshipers consume it
in the belief that this sanctifies them. Its
sacred qualities mean that prasad is
treated differently than regular food: It
cannot be refused and can never be
thrown away. If one cannot eat it, the
favored method of disposal is to feed it
to a cow. See also jutha.
Prashasta (“Approved”) Marriages
In the dharma literature, or the texts on
religious duty, these are the four
approved forms of marriage: the
Brahma marriage, the Daiva marriage,
the Arsha marriage, and the Prajapatya
marriage. These forms are deemed com-
mendable because in each case the
father of the bride is responsible for
arranging the marriage: In the Brahma
form the bride is given as a gift without
conditions, in the Daiva she is given as a
sacrificial fee, in the Arsha she is given in
exchange for a pair of cattle for sacrifice,
and in the Prajapatya she is given with
the condition that the husband and wife
perform their duties together. The
Brahma is the only one of these four
practiced in modern India and is the
idealized form of marriage. See also
marriage, eight classical forms.
Prashastapada
(5th c.) Author of the Padarthadharma-
sangraha.This text is the most influential
commentary on Kanada’s Vaisheshika
Sutras, the founding text of the
Vaisheshika school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. The Vaisheshika school was atom-
istic, believing that all things were made
up of a few basic constituent sub-
stances: the five elements (earth, fire,
water, wind, and akasha) along with
space, time, mind, and individual selves
(atman). The five elements combined to
form the things in the world, though
selves were considered ultimately differ-
ent from matter.
Prashna (“Question”) Upanishad
One of the later and more developed
upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the latest stratum of the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas. As
with most of the upanishads, the Prashna
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to
investigate ultimate questions, in particu-
lar the nature of the Self (atman).
Considered one of the later upanishads,
the Prashna Upanishad is similar to the
earliest upanishads, the Brhadaranyaka
and the Chandogya, but is far shorter, and
the text is much more focused. Like the
older upanishads, the Prashna is written
as a dialogue. It takes the form of a con-
versation between the sage Pippalada and
six questioners. In each section (called a
prashna in the text) one of the hearers asks
a question, to which Pippalada replies.
The six sections all have different themes:
the nature of time, prana as the most
important human power, the nature of life
after death, sleep, meditation, the sound
Om, and the nature of the Self. In this
way, it uses the older dialogue form to
advance a far more developed and
cohesive philosophical perspective.
[[523]]
Pratihara Dynasty
Pratihara Dynasty
(“assertion”) In Indian logic, a part in the
generally accepted form of an inference
(anumana), or logical statement. The
accepted form for an inference has
three terms: an assertion (pratijna), a
reason (hetu), and examples (drshtanta).
Each of these three also has its own con-
stituent parts. The pratijna’s two con-
stituent parts are the paksha and the
sadhya. The paksha is the subject of the
assertion and names a class of things,
while the sadhya is the claim to be
proven about that class. For example, in
the assertion “this mountain is on fire,”
the paksha is “this mountain” (the class
of things about which a claim is being
made), and the sadhya, or thing to be
proven, is “is on fire.”all concepts based on dualistic thinking.
The “Five Forbidden Things,” therefore,
provides a ritual means for breaking
the duality of sacred and forbidden,
by sacralizing several things that are
ordinarily forbidden.
These five things are used in their
actual form in “left hand” (vamachara)
tantra, and by substitution in “right hand”
(dakshinachara) tantra. Substitution
allows the adept to perform the ritual
and at the same time to avoid the disap-
proval that would result from breaking
certain social rules. Although tantric
texts allow for substitution in this rite,
they are usually quite specific about
what sorts of things are acceptable
substitutes, a signature quality of strictly
defined ritual systems. For further infor-
mation see Swami Agehananda Bharati,
The Tantric Tradition, 1975; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
PratilomaPratyabhijna
(“against the hair”) Forbidden marriage
union, in which the husband has lower
social status than the wife. See hypoga-
mous marriage.(“recognition”) Doctrine advanced by
many different schools of tantra, a
secret, ritually defined religious prac-
tice, and particularly by the Kashmiri
philosopher Abhinavagupta, the most
influential figure in Trika Shaivism. It
holds that the final realization of the
Absolute is simply a “re-cognition” of
one’s essential unity with the Divine.
This unity has always existed and has
never been altered, the only factor pre-
venting it from being clearly seen being
the obscuring power of false under-
standing. Final unity with the Divine,
therefore, comes not through doing any-
thing, but simply through realizing what
has always been the case. This doctrine
clearly shows the influence of the
Advaita Vedanta philosophical school,
but with an important shift. The Advaita
school upholds a philosophical position
known as monism, which is the belief
that a single abstract ultimate princi-
ple—which they call Brahman—lies
behind all things, and that all things are
only particular manifestations of that
one principle. The “Recognition” school
See Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty.
Pratijna
Pratinidhi
(“substitute”) In the context of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
anything that can correctly be used as a
substitute. Certain tantric rites make rit-
ual use of substances or actions that are
normally forbidden; the most famous of
these rites, the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara), incorporates violating
the social taboos on drinking wine, con-
suming nonvegetarian food, and engag-
ing in illicit sex. The ritual use of such
normally forbidden things must be seen
in the larger context of tantric practice.
One of the most pervasive tantric
assumptions is the ultimate unity
of everything that exists. From this
perspective,
adepts
affirm
that
the entire universe is one principle—
often, conceived as the activity of a
particular deity—and therefore reject
[[524]]
Pravahana Jaivali
Yoga asanas contribute to the development of pratyahara, or withdrawal from the senses.
adopts this general principle but con-
ceives of Ultimate Reality theistically,
as the god Shiva. For Trika Shaivism,
Shiva is the sole true reality, who is
both supreme god, and the source of
the material universe. For further
information see Jaideva Singh, Pratya-
bhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Pratyahara
(“withdrawal [of the senses]”) In the
ashtanga (“eight-part”) yoga first cod-
ified by Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), pratya-
hara is the fifth of the eight
constituent elements of yoga practice.
Pratyahara occurs when one with-
draws the senses from the sense
objects they ordinarily perceive. It is
done after one has mastered the sit-
ting positions (asanas)—and thus can
sit comfortably for long periods—and
after one has gained control of
“breath” (pranayama), which allows
heightened command of one’s physio-
logical capacities. Having gained rela-
tive mastery over the body, one is then
ready to focus attention inward.
Pratyaksha
(“concerning the eye”) In Indian philos-
ophy, pratyaksha is the general term for
sense perception. All philosophical
schools accept perception as one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge, and it is the only pramana
accepted by the materialist school.
Although the word’s literal meaning
implies only information from the eyes,
this pramana includes sense data from
the other four human senses, as well as
“perceptions” obtained through magical
cognition, yogic insight, or any other
supernormal abilities or phenomena.
Pravahana Jaivali
A character in the Chandogya Upanishad,
one of the speculative religious texts
that form the latest stratum of the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
In the text, Pravahana Jaivali is a mem-
ber of the warrior (kshatriya) class who
serves as teacher to members of the
scholarly-priestly (brahmin) class. His
first students are Silaka Shalavatya and
Caikitayana Dalbhya, then Shvetaketu
Aruneya and his father Gautama. This is
[[525]]
Pravara
one of several episodes in the Upanishads
in which kshatriyas instruct brahmins,
thus inverting the accepted pattern
that holds brahmins as religious
authorities. These episodes reveal the
nature of wisdom as conceived in the
Upanishads—it is conferred, not by
birth or social position, but by individ-
ual striving and realization.
Pravara
A lineage system, primarily among
brahmins, which builds on the assump-
tions of the gotra system (the tracing of
brahmin lineage to one of seven mythi-
cal sages). In his daily worship a brah-
min would not only mention the name
of his gotra, who is the sage believed to
be the family’s immediate progenitor,
but also the names of other sages
believed to be remote ancestors. Both
these “lineages” were passed down only
through men, since it was customary for
a married woman to adopt her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
The only context in which gotra and
pravara were really important was in
fixing marriages, because of the
kinship conferred by these mythic
lineages. Marriage within the gotra
was strictly forbidden, since the
assumption that such people were
directly related made this marriage
incestuous. Marriage within the pravara
was also forbidden, although in
medieval times different groups inter-
preted this prohibition differently.
For some groups, any shared pravara
ancestry would forbid the marriage, but
for other groups one shared “ancestor”
was deemed permissible. The more
lenient interpretation may well have
been spurred by practical difficulties in
making matches.
Prayaga
(“Place of Sacrifice”) The traditional
Hindu name for Allahabad, the city at
the junction of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers. See Allahabad.
[[526]]

Prayashchitta
A general term meaning atonement for
one’s misdeeds. The Hindu religious tra-
dition gives considerable attention to
penance and expiation, based on the
almost universal Hindu belief in the
inexorable
workings
of
karma.
According to this notion, all good and
bad deeds will eventually have their
effect, either in this life or the next, and
thus one must either atone for the evil
one has done or face its consequences
in the future. Prescriptions for such
expiation can be found as far back as the
Vedas, and the acts prescribed for
atonement fall into several categories:
confession, repentance (which was usu-
ally seen as preparation for expiation,
rather than absolution of the evil itself),
restraint of breath (pranayama), physi-
cal asceticism (tapas), fire sacrifice
(homa), recitation of prayers (japa),
gift-giving (dana), fasting (upavasa),
and travel to sacred sites (tirthayatra).
The prayashchitta literature is quite
well developed, both in detailing
differing kinds of offenses and their
potentially mitigating circumstances,
and in laying out the types of atonement
to be performed for each offense. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968.
Prayoga
(“use,” “application”) In the context
of Hindu ritual, any prescribed proce-
dure to be followed during worship,
meditation, or when performing other
ritual actions.
Pregnancy
As in all societies, Hindus regard the
impending birth of a child as a time of
eager expectation tinged with anxiety.
Part of this anxiety stems from purely
physical worries that the pregnancy and
birth proceed normally, and that the
mother and child remain in good physi-
cal health. Expectant mothers are usually
encouraged to rest and are often givenPrinsep, James
food considered especially nourishing
(such as milk products and nuts) to
build their strength. From the mother’s
perspective, pregnancy is an extremely
significant event, since the birth of chil-
dren (especially sons) will solidify her
status in her marital family; but this
significance also contributes its own
quotient of expectation and anxiety.
Since the mother’s emotional state
during pregnancy is believed to affect
the child, all efforts are made to shelter
the expectant mother from unpleasant
thoughts and situations and to generate
happy thoughts.
Aside from protecting the expectant
mother’s physical and psychological
health, Hindus take numerous precau-
tions to guard her from other sorts of
misfortune. As at other life transitions,
during pregnancy and the child’s first
days the mother and her child are con-
sidered particularly vulnerable to black
magic, particularly the witchcraft of
those who might be jealous of the
expectant or new mother. Another
avenue for harm comes from inauspi-
cious events, such as an eclipse, during
which a pregnant woman should stay
inside (away from its malevolent rays)
and remain perfectly still, lest her child
be born with missing limbs. These hos-
tile forces can also be countered by vari-
ous rites of protection, such as wearing
amulets, charms, or iron (considered to
render one impervious to spells), by cut-
ting back on social interaction to avoid
possible contact with inauspicious peo-
ple and things, and by attention to reli-
gious rites.(“departed,” “deceased”) The spirit of a
person who has recently died but is still
inappropriately connected to the world
of the living, often as a troubling or
malevolent presence to the departed’s
family or the general population. Prets
are believed to be the spirits of people
who died in childhood and whose
untimely death left them with certain
unfulfilled desires, particularly longings
relating to marriage and family life. Prets
make themselves known to the living in
two ways, either through dreams or
possession. In some cases they have
specific requests and can be placated
through worship and offerings. In such
instances, dreams offer a method of
communicating with the living, so that
necessary actions can be performed for
the pret. In other cases, the spirit may
resort to bodily possession in an
attempt to realize unfulfilled desires
directly. These spirits are typically
malevolent and require an exorcism to
be removed. For further information on
the care of unquiet family spirits, see
Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful Journeys,
[[1988]]
; for a psychological interpretation
of spirits, possession, and healing, see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Prenatal RitesPrinsep, James
Life-cycle rituals (samskaras) performed
by a husband before his child’s birth, as
prescribed in the dharma literature, the
texts on religious duty. According to this
literature, there were three such rites:
Garbhadhana, which ensured concep-
tion; Pumsavana, which guaranteed that
the newly conceived child would be a
boy; and Simantonnayana, which was
performed late in the pregnancy to
ensure the child’s good health and the
mother’s easy delivery. Although the
dharma literature prescribes these rites
as obligatory, none of them are widely
performed now except by the most
orthodox brahmins.
Pret
(1799–1840) British official and amateur
Indologist. In 1837, Prinsep became the
first modern person to decipher the
Brahmi script, and was thus able to
translate the edicts of the Mauryan
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–32 B.C.E.).
Unfortunately, his career was cut short
by an early death, a pattern distressingly
familiar for colonial administrators in
British India. See also Maurya dynasty.
[[527]]
Priyadas
Priyadas
(early 18th c.) Author of the Bhaktirasa-
bodhini (“Awakening the Delight in
Devotion”), a commentary on the
Bhaktamal of Nabhadas, completed in
[[1712]]
. In his text, Nabhadas had given
very brief (six line) biographies of over
two hundred contemporary bhakti
(devotional) figures. These original
biographies are notably free of mar-
velous and miraculous events, with their
major emphasis being the devotee’s
(bhakta) personal qualities, to serve as a
model for others. In his commentary,
Priyadas gives greatly expanded
accounts for each one of the devotees
mentioned by Nabhadas, and usually
describes events to which Nabhadas
makes no reference. At least in the case
of the poet-saint Ravidas, Nabhadas
clearly drew his material from the texts
written by the biographer Anantadas,
but in many other cases his sources
are not clear. The accounts by Priyadas
are larded with miracles and wonders,
and the prevalence of such events,
combined with his chronological dis-
tance from his subjects, makes him
a less reliable source for the lives of
these devotees.
Progress Philosophy
(“jativada”) Progress philosophy affirms
that one can attain complete freedom
from bondage—which in the Indian
context is identified as the end of rein-
carnation (samsara) and final liberation
of the soul (moksha)—and that one can
also specify the necessary and sufficient
conditions that allow human beings to
bring about this freedom. As a rule,
progress philosophy tends to stress
gradual spiritual attainment, in which
very small beginnings can gradually lead
one to the ultimate goal. Progress
philosophers thus tend to stress partic-
ular religious paths that will lead one
to the final goal, and also tend to place
a great significance on actions (espe-
cially ritual actions) as essential parts
of this path. In the Hindu tradition,
most philosophical schools are progress
[[528]]

philosophies: the combined Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school, the combined
Samkhya-Yoga school, the Purva
Mimamsa school, and even the
Bhamati and Vivarana schools of
Advaita Vedanta.
Prohibition
Most traditional Hindus have clearly
and strongly disapproved of consuming
liquor, a substance which, because it
may lead to a loss of control, is seen as
impure. Among wealthier Indians,
drinking alcoholic beverages is seen as a
habit that signals the acceptance of
Western values and alienation from
one’s roots, whereas among poorer citi-
zens, particularly laborers, drinking is
often seen as a misuse of money needed
to support a family. For all these reasons,
the imposition of total or partial prohi-
bition has become an effective part of
electoral platforms designed to appeal
to traditional and conservative Hindus.
In 1997, prohibition had been estab-
lished in three Indian states: Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh, and Haryana. Of these
three, Gujarat is the only one with a
long-standing history of prohibition,
while prohibition in Andhra Pradesh in
[[1995]]
, and in Haryana in 1996, was
imposed to fulfill campaign promises
made during the state elections in those
years. In both cases, the imposition of
prohibition also stimulated widespread
bootlegging and illegal distilling.
Prostitution
Prostitutes or courtesans were a regular
feature of ancient Indian life. But far
from simply offering sexual pleasure,
these prostitutes were in many cases
women of culture and learning. One of
the sections in the Kama Sutra pertains
to such individuals, and the author
Vatsyayana portrays prostitutes as
women who, while clearly outside nor-
mal society, have far greater indepen-
dence than most women. One finds a
similar picture in The Little Clay Cart
(Mrcchakatika), a drama in which thePuja
courtesan Vasantasena is sought by all
the men of the city because of her beauty,
wealth, and mastery of the sixty-four
aesthetic arts. This picture is doubtless
idealized and was probably realistic for
only a tiny fraction of the women plying
the sex trade, however.
The existence of prostitution also
appears in relation to a group of women
connected to certain temples. Called
servants of the deity (devadasis), these
women were not allowed to marry.
Instead, they were considered to be
married to the god, for whom they
would sing, dance, and perform various
rites, just as any Hindu wife would for
her husband. These women could hold
property and resources of their own, but
their status was clearly unusual, and it
was not uncommon for them to develop
long-term liaisons with local men for
mutual enjoyment. In some cases this
degenerated into prostitution—through
which such women became a source of
income for the temple—but in other
instances they were successful in retain-
ing some autonomy. Since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947 there has been a
prohibition on initiating devadasis, but
some older women remain who were
initiated before that time. In 1995, a
furor developed when the Jagannath
temple management committee began
to explore the possibility of new initia-
tions. For further information see

Prthivi
The most common name for the Earth,
which, in addition to its material form, is
conceived of as a goddess. This particu-
lar name for the Earth goddess comes
from a mythic story connecting her to
the righteous king Prthu.
Prthu
In Hindu mythology, an ancient king
who rules over all the Earth, and whose
reign is considered a golden age. Prthu is
magically born from the right hand of
king Vena, a man so wicked that he has
prohibited all sacrifices to the gods.
After Prthu’s birth the people in his king-
dom suffer famine, since the Earth has
refused to produce food in protest
against Vena’s wickedness. Prthu chases
the Earth, who has taken the form of a
cow. She finally agrees that, if Prthu will
spare her life, she will produce food
again. It is in memory of this deed that
the Earth is given the name Prthivi
(“related to Prthu”).
Puja
(“homage”) The most common word for
worship in modern Hinduism. The root
of the word carries the sense of rever-
ence or respect, but puja is primarily
focused on actions, particularly offer-
ings to the deity, who is treated as an
honored guest. Although, according to
one list, there are sixteen such offerings
(upacharas), in practice the worship
performed in any particular setting is
subject to wide variation—based on
regional or local custom, individual
inclination, and the person’s social sta-
tus and learning. At the heart of puja,
however, is a series of transactions
between the deity and devotee (bhakta).
One such transaction comes in darshan,
the exchange of glances between
an image of the deity and a devotee,
which initiates the relationship between
the two. The other transactions come
from offerings given by the devotee, to
which the deity responds by giving
prasad sanctified by divine contact,
most often food or drink for the devotee
to consume.
Aside from the transactions, the
other most common feature of most
puja is the emphasis on purity, both of
worshiper and of context. The only
exception to this arises in certain forms
of tantra, a secret, ritually based reli-
gious practice in which the performer
deliberately inverts normal ideas of
purity and impurity (ashaucha) as a way
of symbolically destroying all duality.
[[529]]
Pujari
brahmin priest acts as an intermediary
between the high deities and other wor-
shipers, shielding the deity from poten-
tially contaminating contact. His high
ritual purity also makes the brahmin a
universal donor, from whose hand all
people can receive prasad without fear
of pollution. For further information see
C. J. Fuller, “Hindu Temple Priests,” in
T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Pujari
Puja offerings, including flowers and red tika
powder, are left for a deity as a sign of honor
and respect.
Devotees commonly purify themselves
before worship, and the purity of the
site, and the objects used in worship,
must be either established (in the case
of a place or things not generally used
for worship) or maintained (as in the
case of a temple or other regularly estab-
lished place).
In its most basic conception, the
temple is a home for the deity, a ritually
pure environment. Most temples have at
least two different “purity zones,” an
outer zone into which the devotees may
enter, and an inner zone closest to deity,
restricted to the temple priests. In their
purity requirements, deities show as
much variation as one finds in the
human community, and stricter con-
cern for purity indicates higher status,
just as for human beings. Whereas vil-
lage deities are often served by non-
brahmin priests and typically take
offerings of meat, blood, and liquor, the
higher deities are always served by brah-
min priests, and the food offered to
them is invariably vegetarian. As the rit-
ually purest of all human beings, the
[[530]]

In its most basic meaning, the word
pujari denotes “one who does puja
(worship).” In theory this word could
refer to any worshiper, but in general
usage the meaning is more restricted. It
usually designates a man performing
worship as his means of livelihood,
either as a priest in a temple, or as a
religious “technician” hired to perform
ceremonies for others. For further infor-
mation see C. J. Fuller, “Hindu Temple
Priests,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion in
India, 1991.
Pulaha
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts bring them into
being. The others are Kratu, Angiras,
Pulastya, Marichi, and Atri.
Pulakeshin II
(r. 609–42) Greatest king in the
Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much
of the Deccan peninsula from the
Chalukya capital at modern Badami.
Pulakeshin was a contemporary of the
Pushyabhuti emperor Harsha, whom
Pulakeshin defeated in battle to con-
tain Harsha’s southward expansion.
Pulakeshin also defeated the Pallava
dynasty king Mahendravarman, who
was killed in battle with Pulakeshin’s
army. He, in turn, was finally defeated
and killed by Mahendravarman’s son
Narasimhavarman. For several cen-
turies afterward, the Chalukya and
Pallava Dynasties warred with onePunjab

another, and although each was strong
enough to defeat its opponent at various
points in this conflict, neither was capa-
ble of keeping the other under subjuga-
tion. See also Pushyabhuti dynasty.
Pulastya
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts are enough to bring
them into being. The others are Kratu,
Angiras, Pulaha, Marichi, and Atri.
Pumsavana (“engendering a
male”) Samskara
In traditional calculation, the second of
the life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras).
The Pumsavana samskara was one of
the prenatal samskaras performed
before birth, done to ensure that a
newly conceived child would be a boy.
Various writers give differing prescrip-
tions as to the correct time during
the pregnancy to perform this rite, but
they generally specify that it be
performed when the moon is in a male
constellation, at which time the woman
should have several drops of the juice
from the banyan tree inserted into her
right nostril (a common practice in
traditional medicine). This samskara is
seldom performed in modern times.
Pundit
Term still used in modern times to
denote a scholar or learned man. In tra-
ditional usage, the word pundit denoted
a person proficient in Sanskrit and
Sanskrit learning.
Punjab
Modern Indian state that lies south of
the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the
border of Pakistan. Modern Punjab is
one of the so-called linguistic states, cre-
ated to unite people with a common
language and culture (in this case,
Punjabi) under one state government.
The present state of Punjab was created
in 1966, when the former state (also
called Punjab) was divided into three
areas: Punjab (the Punjabi-speaking
region), the state of Haryana (from the
[[531]]
Punya
Hindi-speaking regions), and Himachal
Pradesh (from the hill regions). The
Punjab region is replete with history, for it
has been the traditional route by which
invaders have gained access to the north-
ern Indian plains. The first of these were
the Aryans, who coined its name from the
five rivers (pancab) flowing through it.
The abundant water from these rivers,
carried by an extensive irrigation net-
work, has made the Punjab exceptionally
fertile, and today it remains the largest
wheat-growing area of India.
The Punjab is famous as the birthplace
of the Sikh religious community, and is
today the only Sikh-majority state. The
partition of India into Hindu and Muslim
states in 1947 hit the Sikhs the hardest,
since the division essentially carved their
homeland in half. In the aftermath of the
partition millions of people became
refugees, and many of them fell victim to
the atrocities of the time. For most of the
[[1980]]
s, Sikh proindependence groups
waged an undeclared war against the
Indian government. In one of the most
dramatic events of this period, the Akal
Takht, the traditional symbol for Sikh tem-
poral power, was stormed by the Indian
army in June 1984, and the Indian prime
minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated
four months later. By the mid-1990s this
movement seemed to have been quelled,
although no one can predict whether this
is permanent. Punjab is most famous for
the Sikh Harmandir (Golden Temple) in
Amritsar, a short distance from the
Jallianwala Bagh, site of a massacre that
was one of the pivotal events in the strug-
gle for Indian independence. For general
information about Punjab and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference is
Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Punya
(“holy”) Word most often used as a noun
to mean “religious merit”—sometimes to
denote the religious distinction arising
from a particular deed, but more often
to refer to the collective body of religious
merit one has accumulated through the
[[532]]

good deeds in one’s karmic career.
(According to the theory of karma, all of
one’s deeds will eventually be realized,
so the merit one has earned in the past is
stored up to bring benefits in the future.)
Its opposite is pap, the most general
word for religious demerit.
Purana
(“old”) An important genre of smrti texts,
and the repository of traditional Indian
mythology. The smrtis, or “remembered,”
texts were a class of literature that,
although deemed important, was consid-
ered less authoritative than the shrutis, or
“heard” texts. In brief, the shrutis denoted
the Vedas, the oldest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts, whereas the
smrtis included the two great epics, name-
ly the Mahabharata and the Ramayana,
the dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
and the compendia known as the puranas.
According to one traditional defini-
tion, a purana should contain accounts
of at least five essential things: the cre-
ation of the earth, its dissolution and
recreation, origins of the gods and patri-
archs, the reigns of the Manvantaras,
and the reigns of the Solar and Lunar
Lines. In practice, the puranas are com-
pendia of all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Individual puranas are
usually highly sectarian and intended to
promote the worship of one of the
Hindu gods, whether Vishnu, Shiva, or
the Goddess. By tradition the major
puranas number eighteen, but there are
hundreds of minor works. Along with
the epics, the puranas are the store-
houses of the mythic tales that are the
common religious currency for tradi-
tional Hindus. In this respect the
puranas are much more influential than
any of the Vedas, because the tales in
the puranas are common knowledge.
The contents of the Vedas, though more
authoritative, are less well known.
Judgments on the importance of indi-
vidual puranas vary according to sec-
tarian persuasion, but some of thePuri

most important puranas are the Agni
Purana, Shiva Purana, Brahma Purana,
Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana,
Harivamsha, and Markandeya Purana.

puranic texts, see Cornelia Dimmitt and

Mythology, 1978.
Purana Kassapa
In early Indian philosophy, philosopher
opposed to moral rules, whose views are
mentioned in Buddhist scriptures.
According to these texts, Kassapa
believed that there was no religious
merit in good acts, and no demerit in
evil acts—that neither of these had any
affect on the Self at all. Beyond this, very
little is known about him.
Purandaradas
(1480–1564) A devotee (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu who was the founder of the
Haridasas, a sect of saint-composers in
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
Aside from the literary merits of the
poetry Purandaradas wrote, the musical
structure of his songs is believed to have
laid the foundations for the Karnatic
school of Indian music, the predomi-
nant musical form in southern India.
Purattasi
The sixth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Kanya (the zodiacal sign
of Virgo), which usually falls within
September and October. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Puri
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the Bay
of Bengal in the state of Orissa. Puri is
best known for its temple to the god
Jagannath, a local deity assimilated
[[533]]
Puri Dashanami
into the pantheon as a form of the god
Krishna and therefore, by extension, a
form of Vishnu. The temple was com-
pleted in 1198 C.E. and is currently
receiving much needed restoration,
after several pieces fell off the tower in
the early 1990s. The most important
annual festival held in Puri is the Rath
Yatra. During this festival, Jagannath,
his brother Balabhadra, and his sister
Subhadra are carried in procession
through the city’s main street in enor-
mous wooden carts. They travel to
another temple about a mile away,
where they stay for a week, and then
return to Puri. Aside from the spectacle,
the ceremony is an important ritual
theater used to demonstrate the rela-
tionship between Jagannath and the
kings of Puri, who were considered to
be deputies ruling in his name.
Although the kings no longer wield
actual power in modern times, by
virtue of their status they still play an
important ritual role.
Aside from containing the temple
of Jagannath, Puri is one of the four
dhams, which symbolically mark the
geographic boundaries of India. It is
also the home of the Govardhan
Math, one of the four Dashanami
Sanyasi sacred centers supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Puri’s character as a
holy city has made it an attractive
place for religiously inclined people to
make their homes, most notably the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533),
who lived there for much of his adult
life. The cultural life generated by the
worship of Jagannath also made Puri
a center for the arts, and it is the
traditional home of the classical
dance form known as Orissi. For fur-
ther information see Anncharlott
Eschmann, Hermann Kulke, and Gaya
Charan Tripathi, The Cult of
Jagannath and the Regional Tradition
of Orissa, 1978; and Frederique Apffel
Marglin, “Time Renewed: Ratha Jatra
in Puri,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
[[534]]

Puri Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The
Dashanamis were supposedly estab-
lished by the ninth century philosopher
Shankaracharya in an effort to create a
corps of learned men who could help to
revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divi-
sions is designated by a different
name—in this case, puri (“city”). Upon
initiation, new members are given this
name as their new surname, thus allow-
ing for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are also
divided into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquarters
in one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Puri
Dashanamis belong to the Kitawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Shringeri Math in the southern Indian
town of Shringeri.
Purity
(shaucha) Along with its opposite,
impurity (ashaucha), purity is one of the
fundamental concepts in Hindu culture.
Although to outsiders purity can be eas-
ily confused with cleanliness, it is funda-
mentally different—purity is a religious
category marked by the presence or
absence of pollution or defilement,
whereas cleanliness is a hygienic cate-
gory. In some cases these categories can
overlap, but in most their disjunction
becomes clear. For example, from a reli-
gious perspective, bathing (snana) in
the Ganges River makes one pure,
whereas from a hygienic perspective the
lower reaches of the Ganges are quite
heavily polluted.
On a personal level, purity can be
best described as the absence of defile-
ment, gained through removing impuri-
ties in some manner, most often by
bathing. After becoming purified, one
remains pure until coming into contact
with a source of impurity. These sourcesPurohit
of impurity include essential bodily
functions, such as urination and evacu-
ation; sexual activity; contact with
impure things both inside and outside
one’s home; and even contact with cer-
tain groups of people deemed impure.
Thus, although purity is always easy to
regain, it is impossible to retain, since it
is breached by many of the actions of
everyday life. It is also important to real-
ize that impurity brings no moral stigma
to an individual—becoming impure
means simply that one has come into
contact with some contaminant, and
that this must be removed. The only
times when purity is particularly impor-
tant are in worship and in eating—the
former to keep from contaminating
the deities and their environs, the latter
to protect oneself, since the circum-
stances surrounding what one eats
are considered to have long-term effects
on an individual.
Aside from its personal dimension,
purity has a social dimension as well.
Higher status groups, such as brah-
mins, are considered to have inherently
higher ritual purity. This social dimen-
sion of purity comes with birth and is
the religious basis determining the
hierarchical divisions in the traditional
social system. To some extent, a
group’s purity level corresponds to its
hereditary occupation. People who
had continual contact with substances
considered impure (such as latrine
cleaners, corpse burners, and scav-
engers) were seen as tainted by work,
and rendered impure. Brahmins, as
scholars and priests (the latter a task
that brought them in contact with the
gods), were the purest. Between these
extremes fell the other groups, whose
relative status in a specific locale was
determined by local factors. For theo-
retical consideration of the impor-
tance that purity plays in modern
Hindu life, see Louis Dumont, Homo
Hierarchicus, 1980; for another analy-
sis of social ordering, see McKim
Marriot,

Purochana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Purochana is a minis-
ter of Duryodhana, the epic’s antago-
nist. He advises Duryodhana to build the
House of Lac as a means to kill the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are
Duryodhana’s cousins, and the epic’s
protagonists. After the Pandavas move
into the House of Lac, Purochana sets
fire to it. The Pandavas, whose uncle
Vidura has alerted them to the danger,
are able to escape through a secret
underground passage, but Purochana
himself is killed in the fire.
Purohit
(“[one] placed in front”) The most
important of the priestly functionaries
in the cult of sacrifice found in
the Brahmanas. The purohit was
[[535]]
Pururavas
responsible for supervising the other
sacrificing priests, such as the rtvij
and the hotr, and for making sure that
the animal sacrifices were completed
without error. The purohit would often
be attached to a particular ruler and
was also called to perform rites for
communal well-being. In modern times
this latter meaning has persisted, the
word is often used to denote one’s family
priest, who will perform various rituals
for the family.
Pururavas
In Hindu mythology, a prominent king
of a royal lineage who trace their ances-
try to the moon. Pururavas is a righteous
king who performs one hundred horse
sacrifices (ashvamedha), and the merit
from these gives him great power. He is
best known for his dalliance with the
celestial nymph (apsara) Urvashi, by
whom he has several children. Although
the two are forced to spend sixty years
apart because of a curse, in the end they
are happily reunited.
Purusha
(“person”) One of the two fundamental
first principles in the Samkhya philo-
sophical school, the other one being
prakrti (“nature”). Samkhya upholds an
atheistic philosophical dualism in
which the twin principles of purusha
and prakrti—roughly, spirit and
nature—are the source of all things.
Purusha is conceived as conscious but
completely inactive and unchanging. It
is the passive witness to the myriad
transformations of prakrti going on
around it, and as the source of con-
sciousness purusha is ultimately identi-
fied with a person’s true Self (atman).
Thus purusha is inferred as plural, given
the plurality of conscious beings and
the fact that one person can gain final
enlightenment while all the rest remain
in bondage. According to the Samkhyas,
the ultimate source of bondage lies in
people’s failure to distinguish between
purusha and prakrti and in identifying
[[536]]

the Self with the latter rather than the
former. For further information see
Gerald Larson and Ram Shankar
Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya, 1987;
and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Purushartha
The Aims of Life, traditionally num-
bered at four: material wealth and
power (artha), pleasure (kama), reli-
gious duty (dharma), and final libera-
tion (moksha). All of these were seen as
legitimate goals in traditional Hindu
society. See Aims of Life.
Purusha Sukta
(“Hymn to the Primeval Man”) The most
common name for the hymn in the Rg
Veda (10.90) that describes the creation
of the material and social world as the
result of a primordial sacrifice.
According to the text, in the beginning
there was one primeval man, who was
dismembered in sacrifice. Different
parts of his body became different parts
of the physical universe, as well as the
four traditional major social groups
(varnas): the brahmins came from the
primeval man’s mouth, the kshatriyas
from his shoulders, the vaishyas from
his thighs (a common euphemism for
the genitals), and the shudras from his
feet. This hymn clearly reflects the sacri-
ficial paradigm that was so central to the
later Brahmana literature, and is thus
believed to be one of the latest hymns in
the Rg Veda. It is also notable for giving
the first known articulation of the four
varnas, as well as the symbolic functions
associated with each: for brahmins,
speech and the authority of the sacred
word; for kshatriyas, protection and
military valor; for vaishyas, generation
and production, and for shudras, service
to others.
Purushottama Mas
Religious observance that occurs when
the intercalary month falls during thePurva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa
lunar month of Ashadh. The intercalary
month is an extra lunar month inserted
into the calendar about every thirty
months, to maintain general agreement
between the solar and lunar calendar. It
begins after any “regular” lunar month
in which the sun has not moved into the
next sign of the zodiac, and takes the
name of the preceding month. Since the
intercalary month is an unusual phe-
nomenon, it is generally considered to
be inauspicious, and the most common
colloquial name for this month is the
malamasa, the “impure month.” When
this extra month falls in the lunar month
of Ashadh, however, devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu take the opposite per-
spective and treat it as an exceedingly
holy time, dedicated to Vishnu in his
form as Purushottama (“best of men”).
Vaishnavas celebrate this month by
reading the sacred texts, chanting
Vishnu’s divine names, and other sorts
of worship. The month of Ashadh, and
its intercalary month, are especially
important for the Jagannath temple in
the city of Puri, whose presiding deity,
Jagannath, is considered a form of
Krishna and therefore, by extension, a
form of Vishnu. During every year
Ashadh is the month in which the Rath
Yatra festival is performed in Puri, and in
years when the intercalary month falls in
Ashadh, new images of Jagannath and
his siblings are created.
Purva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa
One of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy, most commonly
referred to simply as Mimamsa (“inves-
tigation”); it was given the name Purva
Mimamsa to distinguish it from the
Uttara (“Later”) Mimamsa school, better
known as Vedanta. The Mimamsa
school’s name is quite apt, for it empha-
sizes the investigation of dharma
(“righteous action”), particularly as
revealed in the Vedas, the earliest and
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.
Mimamsas affirmed that the Vedas were
the source of perfect knowledge, and
believed that the Vedas had not been
composed either by God or by human
beings but were rather simply heard
by the ancient sages through their
advanced powers of perception, and
then transmitted orally from generation
to generation.
Since they accepted the Vedas as the
primary source of authority and assumed
that the Vedas contained codes and pre-
scriptions pertaining to dharma, the
Mimamsas then developed complex
rules for textual interpretation to dis-
cern these, and it is for these rules that
they are best known. Mimamsas
believed in the existence of the soul and
in the necessary connection of actions
with their results inherent in the notion
of karma—two ideas attested to in the
Vedas. In cases where the result of an
action comes some time after the act, the
Mimamsas believed that the result existed
as an unseen force called apurva. This
force would invariably bring on the result,
thus maintaining the Vedic truth. The
Mimamsas were less unified on the exis-
tence of God. Jaimini (4th c. B.C.E.?), the
author of the Mimamsa Sutras and the
founder of the school, seems to ignore the
issue completely, and 1,000 years later
another Mimamsa luminary, Kumarila,
argued against the existence of God.
Aside from developing methods for
interpreting the Vedas, Mimamsas also
contributed to logic and epistemology.
One of their notable contributions was
postulating two new pramanas, which
are the means by which human beings
can gain true and accurate knowledge.
All the philosophical schools accepted
perception (pratyaksha) as a pramana,
and most also accepted inference (anu-
mana) and authoritative testimony
(shabda). The two new modes devel-
oped by the Mimamsas were “presump-
tion” (arthapatti) and “knowledge from
absence” (abhava). The Mimamsas jus-
tified these additions by claiming that
they accounted for knowledge that
could not be subsumed under the exist-
ing pramanas. Arthapatti is an inference
from circumstance, in which a judg-
ment is made about one case based
solely on similarities to related cases. An

example would be the presumption that
a traveler had reached his or her desti-
nation after the train’s arrival time had
passed. According to Indian philosophy,
this is not a true inference, since the lat-
ter must always be confirmed by direct
perception. In the same way, abhava or
the perception of any absence (e.g., the
absence of some object before one)
could not be accounted for by any of
the existing pramanas, and thus
required this new one to explain it.
Aside from Jaimini, the two most sig-
nificant figures among the Mimamsas
are Kumarila and Prabhakara, who
both lived in the seventh century. For
further information see Karl H. Potter,
Presuppositions of India’s Philosophies,

; and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Pushan
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts,
Pushan is one of the deities identified
with the Sun. Due to this connection,
Pushan is described as the witness to all
[[538]]

things; he is also considered to be the
keeper and protector of flocks, and
bringer of prosperity. By the turn of the
common era, and perhaps significantly
earlier, his presence had almost com-
pletely disappeared, and today he
remains only historically important.
Pushan
(2) In Hindu mythology, the name of an
aditya (minor deity) who attends the
sacrifice sponsored by the demigod
Daksha. The sacrifice is a disaster, since
Daksha insults the god Shiva by not
inviting him to the ceremony. When
Daksha’s daughter Sati, who is also
Shiva’s wife, inquires why Shiva has
been excluded, Daksha begins to insult
her in full view of the company.
Mortified and humiliated, Sati commits
suicide. When Shiva learns of this,
he comes with his ghoulish minions
and utterly destroys the sacrifice. In
the process many of the guests
suffer injuries or indignities, and
Pushan’s teeth are broken and lost.Pushti Marg

of the city of Ajmer in the state of
Rajasthan. Pushkar’s center is a natural
lake, and its major importance is as a
bathing (snana) place—according to
tradition, its lake is so holy that Pushkar
is said to be the religious preceptor
(guru) of all other sacred sites. Pushkar’s
lake is surrounded by temples. Of these,
the best-known is dedicated to the god
Brahma and is his only temple in all of
India. Two nearby temples dedicated to
the Goddess are said to be Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites spread
throughout the subcontinent and
sacred to the Goddess. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth.
The two temples in Pushkar mark the
places where both of Sati’s wrists fell.
Pushkar’s largest festival is known as
Kartik Purnima (October–November),
and falls on a full moon (generally asso-
ciated with enhancing the sanctity of
bathing places). Aside from being a time
for bathing, this event is also marked by
the holding of an enormous livestock
market, particularly for camels and
horses. The state government is currently
promoting this as a tourist attraction,
and it has drawn over 200,000 people in
recent years. See also pitha.
ways and often depends on the wor-
shiper’s inclinations. In some cases the
flowers will simply be presented before
the deity’s image, with the understand-
ing that the deity has taken them,
whereas in other cases flowers will
be placed on the deity’s image, or a
garland hung around its neck. In
either instance, the underlying motive
is to show love and respect for the
deity and to minister to its needs as
one would to a living person. This par-
ticular act of respect and love can also
be accorded to other human beings;
garlanding a person with flowers is a
sign of high esteem or congratulations.
Pushpak Viman
In traditional mythic geography, the
name of the seventh and outermost
of the concentric land masses (dvipas)
making up the visible world. See
also cosmology.(“Flower chariot”) In Hindu mythology,
the most famous of the aerial cars.
Pushpak Viman is built by the divine
architect Vishvakarma. Vishvakarma’s
daughter Sanjna has married the Sun
but is so overwhelmed by his brilliance
that she begs her father to reduce his
luster so she can stand to be with him.
Vishvakarma does this by trimming
some bits off the sun, which are later
fashioned into the Pushpak Viman as
well as several divine weapons. For
some time the Pushpak Viman is held
by the minor deity Kubera, who obtains
it as a reward for performing intense
physical asceticism (tapas). It is later
taken from Kubera by the demon-king
Ravana, who uses its powers to wreak all
sorts of tyranny, culminating in the
abduction of Rama’s wife Sita. After
slaying Ravana, Rama uses the Pushpak
Viman to return to the city of Ayodhya
and then returns the car to Kubera.
PushpaPushti Marg
Pushkara (“Blue Lotus”) Dvipa
(“flower”) The tenth of the sixteen tradi-
tional upacharas (“offerings”) given to
a deity as part of worship. In this offer-
ing (based on the model of treating the
deity as an honored guest) the deity is
given flowers, valued both for their color
and their fragrance. The actual act of
offering can be performed in various
Religious community founded by the
philosopher Vallabhacharya (1479–1531),
whose teachings remain the sect’s pri-
mary influence. Vallabhacharya charac-
terized his philosophical position as
“pure monism” (Shuddadvaita); his fun-
damental position is that the god
Krishna is the Supreme Being and the
[[539]]
Pushyabhuti Dynasty
ultimate source of everything that exists.
The world, and human beings, thus
share in his divine nature, although only
in a limited fashion, and the human soul
is imbued with divinity as its inner light
and controller.
Since Krishna is the ultimate source
of everything and thus everything
depends ultimately on God, the school’s
primary religious emphasis is on the
importance of God’s grace. This grace is
seen as nourishing (pushti) the devotee
(bhakta) and is best attained by devo-
tion (bhakti), which is conceived of as
the only effective religious path. This
emphasis on grace and devotion has
meant that the Pushti Marg have put lit-
tle stress on asceticism or renunciation,
and the bulk of Vallabhacharya’s
followers came from affluent merchant
communities. The stress on devotion
was soon articulated in elaborately
arranged forms of image worship in the
Pushti Marg’s temples. Devotees would
visualize themselves as Krishna’s com-
panions during his daily activities—
waking, eating, taking his cows to
graze, coming home, etc.—and thus
gain the opportunity to take part in the
divine play (lila). This emphasis on
visualization and participation was fos-
tered through the development of vast
liturgical resources, which were com-
posed by eight poets (the ashtachap)
who were associated with Vallabhacharya
and Vitthalnath, his son and successor.
The third leader, Vitthalnath’s son
Gokulnath, further consolidated the
developing community, whose major
sacred site is now in Nathdwara in the
state of Rajasthan. For further informa-
tion see R.K. Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacharya, 1976.
Pushyabhuti Dynasty
(6th–7th c.) Northern Indian dynasty
whose capital was at Kanyakubja, the
modern city of Kanuaj in the Ganges
river basin, and whose territory ran
through the northern Indian plain from
the Punjab to Bihar. The Pushyabhutis
filled the northern Indian political
[[540]]

vacuum after the demise of the Gupta
empire and in some measure regained
its greatness. The dynasty’s greatest
ruler was the emperor Harsha
(r. 606–47), whose reign was chronicled
in panegyric fashion by the playwright
Bana, and perhaps more factually by the
Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hsuan Tsang.
The latter’s journals give a detailed
picture both of Harsha himself, in whose
court Hsuan Tsang stayed for some time,
and of everyday life in Harsha’s
kingdom. See also Gupta dynasty.
Pustaka
A book, traditionally made of palm
leaves connected by a string running
through a hole punched in the middle,
with a wooden cover on top and bottom
to keep the leaves from being bent or
broken. In Indian iconography, the book
is most strongly associated with the
goddess Saraswati, in keeping with her
identity as the patron deity of the arts,
culture, and learning. It also commonly
appears as one of the objects held by the
god Brahma.
Putana
In Hindu mythology, Putana is one of
the demon assassins sent by Kamsa,
the king of Mathura, in an attempt to
kill his nephew, the child-god Krishna.
Through her magic powers, Putana
assumes the form of a beautiful young
woman and, after cooing over Krishna
for awhile, puts him to suckle at her poi-
soned breast. When Krishna latches on,
however, it is Putana who is in dire trou-
ble—Krishna sucks at her breast so hard
that he sucks the life right out of her. As
she dies, she reverts to her original form,
gigantic and hideous, and the crash of
her falling body shakes the earth and
fells trees.
Putrada Ekadashi
Religious observance that occurs twice
per year: on the eleventh day (ekadashi)
of the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Shravan (July–August), andPuttaparthi
on the eleventh day of the bright (wax-
ing) half of the lunar month of Paush
(December–January). As with all the
eleventh-day observances, these are
dedicated to the god Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, which usually involve fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Faithfully observing the
ekadashi rites on these days is believed
to give one a son (putra), which is a
major concern in traditional Indian cul-
ture. Sons are necessary for this world
and the next, not only to care for their
parents in their old age, but also to
perform certain ancestral rites after
one’s death. The strength of this
desire for sons is demonstrated by the
fact that this particular ekadashi
occurs twice during the year—the only
ekadashi to do so.
Puttaparthi
Town in Andhra Pradesh near the bor-
der with Karnataka, about ninety–five
miles north of Bangalore. Puttaparthi is
best known in connection with the
modern Hindu teacher Sathya Sai Baba,
not only as the place where he was born
and raised, but also the site of his most
important religious dwelling (ashram)
and primary residence.
[[541]]
Radha
## R
Radha
In later devotional (bhakti) literature,
Radha is the woman portrayed as the
god Krishna’s lover and companion.
Radha’s love for Krishna is a symbol of
the soul’s hunger for union with the
divine, expressed through the poetic
conventions of erotic love.
Although a few references to Radha
in poetry date back to the seventh cen-
tury, her first developed portrayal is in
Jayadeva’s lyric poem the Gitagovinda,
written around the twelfth century. The
Gitagovinda tells the story of Radha and
Krishna’s passion, their conflict and sep-
aration, and their eventual reconcilia-
tion. Jayadeva’s portrayal of Radha is
unique. In the poem Radha wishes to
have Krishna all to herself, as his sole
lover and companion. She sulks jealously
when he flirts with other women and
angrily dismisses him when he comes to
her marked with the signs of another
tryst. In the end, however, they reconcile
and make passionate love as a symbol of
their union.
This picture of love, separation, and
reunion between Radha and Krishna
gains a sharper focus through the con-
text set by Jayadeva’s hymn Dashavatara
Stotra . In it Jayadeva lists the achieve-
ments of Krishna’s ten incarnations
(avatars) immediately after the text’s
introductory verses. The concluding
verses of the hymn explicitly refer to
Krishna as the ultimate source of the
ten avatars, reminding hearers that the
person taking part in this drama of
jealousy, repentance, and reconcilia-
tion is none other than the Lord of the
Universe Himself, who in ages past has
acted to preserve the world from
destruction. Unlike earlier depictions
[[542]]

of Krishna in which his connections
with his devotees (bhakta) are por-
trayed as a form of “play” (lila), the
Krishna found in the Gitagovinda
seems less lofty and detached, more
intimately and intensely involved with
Radha as the object of his affection.
The poem renders Krishna as one who
feels emotions deeply and truly and
meaningfully reciprocates the feelings
of his devotee.
Jayadeva’s poetic focus is on the
inner dynamic between the two lovers,
and he reveals little about Radha outside
this relationship. In the time after the
Gitagovinda, Radha’s character devel-
oped in various ways. Some poets
describe her as married to another man,
thus giving Radha’s trysts with Krishna
the color of adulterous, forbidden love.
This love is considered more intense in
Indian poetics, since the lovers have
nothing to gain from the liaison but the
love itself and stand to lose everything
should they be discovered. Here Radha
stands as the symbol of one willing to
risk and lose all for the sake of love itself.
The other way in which Radha’s char-
acter is developed runs contrary to this
adulterous portrayal. In some traditions
Radha is not drawn as a simple woman
consumed with love for Krishna, but as
his wife, consort, and divine power
(shakti), through whose agency Krishna
is able to act in the world. This deified
image of Radha was particularly impor-
tant for the Nimbarka religious commu-
nity, which conceived of Radha and
Krishna as forms of Lakshmi and
Narayana. Another group espousing
this equality was the Radhavallabh
community, whose members particularly
stressed the love Krishna felt for Radha.

(1888–1975) Modern Indian philosopher
and statesman. Like many elite IndiansRadhakrishnan, Sarvepalli
Radha, the god Krishna’s lover and companion.
[[543]]
Radhashtami
of his generation, Radhakrishnan was
educated at Christian missionary
schools, and the contrast between the
Hindu piety of his home and the
Christian doctrine he encountered at
school sparked his interest in compara-
tive philosophy. He spent the rest of his
life as an interpreter and apologist for
classical Hindu thought, particularly
the Vedanta school, and as a proponent
of philosophical idealism, the notion
that absolute truth can be found
through intuition alone. Aside from his
work as a college teacher and adminis-
trator, he also served as the vice presi-
dent of India from 1952 to 1962, and as
president from 1962 to 1967. For further
information on his thought, see his An
Idealist View of Life, 1981; Paul A.
Schilpp, The Philosophy of Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan, 1952; and Robert N.

‘Hinduism’ Defined and Defended,” in
Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in Modern
India, 1998.
Radhashtami
(“Radha’s eighth”) Festival falling on the
eight day of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September); this day is cele-
brated as the birthday of Krishna’s con-
sort Radha. Radha is seen differently by
various Vaishnava religious communi-
ties: For some she is a human woman,
the symbol of the perfect devotee
(bhakta) who forsakes all else to be with
her lover, for others she is considered
the queen of heaven and an equal to
Krishna himself. In either case, her
closeness to him is shown by her birth
on the same month and lunar day as
Krishna, but in the opposite half of the
month. Radhashtami festival is celebrated
with particular fervor in Barsana, the
village in the Braj region in which Radha
is said to have been born.
Radha Soami
Modern Hindu religious community
founded in 1861 in the city of Agra by
[[544]]

Shiv Dayal Singh, more commonly
referred to as Soamiji Maharaj. Soamiji’s
family had been influenced by Tulsi
Saheb, a devotional (bhakti) saint who
lived in that region, and Soamiji’s teach-
ings reflect the importance of that
contact. The two pillars of Radha Soami
doctrine are the importance of the
spiritual teacher (guru) and the practice
of a spiritual discipline called surat-
shabd-yoga.
According to Radha Soami teachings,
contact with a guru is the single most
important factor in a person’s spiritual
development, and this spiritual progress
hinges on complete surrender to the
guru’s grace. It is essential for the devo-
tee (bhakta) to be associated with a
“true guru” (satguru), since not only
does such an individual have access to
the divine, he is considered a manifesta-
tion of the divine itself. Surat-shabd-
yoga stresses joining (yoga) the
devotee’s spirit (surat) with the Divine
Sound (shabd). The Divine Sound
emanates from the Supreme Being and
is always present. Most people cannot
hear it, due to their preoccupation with
worldly things, but with proper training
and devotion to a true guru, anyone can
eventually become attuned to the
Divine Sound and resonate in harmony
with it.
In the era since Soamiji Maharaj, the
Radha Soami Satsang has split numer-
ous times, usually based on disagree-
ments over spiritual authority. Given the
Radha Soami emphasis on the satguru
as the Supreme Being, disagreements
over spiritual succession—in effect, dis-
agreements over the identity of the
Supreme Being—made schisms virtually
inevitable. It also seems clear that the
underlying forces in many of these
schisms were disagreements over
far more mundane things, such as
power, status, and property. Various
branches of the Radha Soamis
have made successful missionary
efforts and established centers in
Europe and the United States. For
further information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991;Rahu

; and Mark Juergensmeyer, Radha-
soami Reality, 1991.
Radhavallabh Sampraday
Religious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu
(that is, Vaishnavas), and whose founder
was the sixteenth-century poet-saint
Harivamsh. Harivamsh held distinctive
views on the status of Radha, which his
community has preserved. Whereas
earlier poetry had often portrayed
Radha as the god Krishna’s adulterous
mistress, the Radhavallabhans conceive
of her as his lawful wife and as a deity
whose status was equal with Krishna’s.
Their devotion was focused on Krishna
and on his status as the “beloved of
Radha” (Radhavallabh).
Raga
In Indian music, a concrete melodic
mode of at least five notes. Any musician
playing a raga is limited by the con-
straints of its established form. The
order of these established notes in the
raga does not follow their musical order
but differs according to whether the
note sequence is ascending or descend-
ing. There are over 200 recognized ragas,
but only about thirty are in general use.
Each raga has very particular symbolic
associations—particularly with the time
of day or with the seasons—and is also
believed to convey a particular aesthetic
mood (rasa) to listeners. As in all the
Indian arts, the musician who plays a
raga endeavors to convey a certain
mood to an audience and to awaken
corresponding feelings within them.
Raghu
In Hindu mythology, Raghu is a famous
king of the Ikshvaku dynasty and the
grandfather of King Dasharatha. One of
Dasharatha’s sons is Rama, the protago-
nist of the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics.
Raghuvamsha
(“Raghu’s Lineage”) One of the great
poetic works by Kalidasa, who is gener-
ally considered to be the finest classical
Sanskrit poet. The Raghuvamsha is a
quasi-historical epic in nineteen cantos,
devoted to the kings of the Solar Line,
and particularly to its most eminent
member, the god-king Rama. The story
of Rama in Kalidasa’s poem is fairly close
to that of the epic Ramayana, although
Kalidasa describes Rama as an avatar or
divine incarnation in a way that Valmiki
does not. Kalidasa’s poem also uses the
kings of the Solar Line as examples of
devotion to the four aims of life
(purushartha): wealth (artha), pleasure
(kama), religious duty (dharma), and
release (moksha). In Kalidasa’s portrayal,
the kings at the end of the line are
completely immoral and devoted
solely to pleasure. Such abject neglect
of their duty to rule righteously brings
on the destruction of the line and
provides a exemplary lesson for hearers
of the poem.
Rahu
A malevolent “planet” in Hindu astrology
(jyotisha) that has no counterpart in
Western astrology and was originally the
head of a demon. According to the story,
as the gods drink the nectar of immor-
tality they have churned from the ocean
of milk, the demon Sainhikeya slips into
their midst in disguise. As the demon
begins to drink, the sun and moon alert
Vishnu, who uses his discus to cut off
the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two
halves become immortal, however, after
coming into contact with the nectar. The
severed head becomes Rahu, and the
decapitated body another evil planet,
Ketu. Rahu is regarded not as a physical
planet, but as the ascending node of the
moon. This is the point where the
moon’s northward path intersects the
path of the sun in the sky, causing an
eclipse. Rahu has particular enmity for
the sun and moon, as the deities
responsible for his demise, and tries to
swallow them whenever he meets them
[[545]]
Raidas
in the heavens. He always succeeds, but
since he no longer has a body to digest
them, they escape unharmed through
Rahu’s severed neck. This, of course, is
the traditional explanation for solar and
lunar eclipses; their association with the
malevolent Rahu has led eclipses to be
seen as highly inauspicious times. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Raidas
A variant name for the Hindu poet-
saint Ravidas.
Rajabhiseka
(“royal anointing”) Royal consecration
ceremony that replaced the earlier raja-
suya rite. The Rajabhiseka includes ritu-
als of anointing that were believed to
have transformative power, but were
less complex than the Rajasuya, and did
not involve the ritual slaughter and sac-
rifice of animals.
Rajadharma
General name for the “king’s dharma,”
or religious duty, which fell to him (or far
more rarely, her) by virtue of his role as
ruler. This notion proceeded from the
assumption in the dharma literature
that every person had a unique role to
play in society, a role that provided for
social stability but also brought individ-
ual fulfillment. The king’s most basic
duty was to maintain order in the realm,
since such peace enabled all others to
fulfill their own individual religious
duties (svadharma). The dharma litera-
ture conceives of maintaining order pri-
marily through inflicting punishment
(danda), designed to remove some evil-
doers and frighten the rest into good
behavior. If the king succeeded in main-
taining social order, then he could oth-
erwise do as he pleased, with the proviso
that taxation should not be so high that
it was burdensome to the people.
Beyond this, the Indian theory of king-
ship was largely pragmatic.
[[546]]

Rajagrha
Ancient name for the city corresponding
to modern Rajgir, in the Nalanda district
of the state of Bihar. Although contem-
porary Rajgir is a small and insignificant
city, at the time of the Buddha it was the
capital of the Magadhan empire and the
center of the region’s political and intel-
lectual life. According to Buddhist tradi-
tion, Rajgir was the site of the first
Buddhist council, held shortly after the
Buddha’s death and organized to docu-
ment his teachings. This story is almost
certainly apocryphal, since the Buddhist
scriptures went through a much longer
period of development, but its setting
illustrates Rajagrha’s centrality in the
middle of the first millennium before
the turn of the common era.
Raja Raja
(r. 985–1014) Monarch under whose rule
(and that of his son Rajendra) the Chola
dynasty reached the apex of its power,
stretching its influence from the Tanjore
district of Tamil Nadu throughout
southern India and into southeast Asia
all the way to Malaysia. Raja Raja directed
the wealth that such power brought
toward the construction of massive
temples. Of these, he is most noted
for the Brhadeshvar temple in the city
of Tanjore, dedicated to the “Great
Lord” Shiva.
Rajas
(“passion”) One of the three fundamen-
tal qualities (gunas) believed to be pre-
sent in all things, the other two gunas
being sattva (“goodness”) and tamas
(“darkness”). According to this model,
differing proportions of these qualities
account for differences in the properties
of concrete things, and in the range of
individual human capacities and ten-
dencies. Unlike sattva and tamas, which,
respectively, carry exclusively good and
bad associations, rajas and its effects can
be either positive or negative, depending
on context. Rajas is negative, for example,
when it leads to an enslavement to theRajasthani
passions that may blind one to careful
and conscious thought. Alternately, the
energies derived from passion can also
engender useful activity and industri-
ousness. The notion of the gunas origi-
nated in the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, and
although much of Samkhya meta-
physics connected with the gunas has
long been discredited, the idea of the
gunas and their qualities has become a
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
Rajashekhara
(10th c.) Dramatist notable for writing
plays both in Sanskrit and Prakrit.
Rajashekhara’s Sanskrit plays were highly
literary, and it seems that they were
probably intended for reading rather
than performance.
Rajasimhavarman
(8th c.) Ruler in the Pallava dynasty
who, like his predecessors, was a great
patron of the arts. His reign saw the con-
struction of the last of the magnificent
shore temples built on the Bay of
Bengal, at Mahabalipuram in Tamil
Nadu. The temple’s major deity was the
god Shiva, but a smaller shrine also held
an image of the god Vishnu. Although
these temples have been weathered by
time and the elements, they remain
some of the most visited sites in south-
ern India.
Rajasthan
(“land of kings”) Modern Indian state on
the border of Pakistan between the
states of Punjab and Gujarat, created by
combining a network of princely states
with Ajmer, formerly under British con-
trol. These principalities were the rem-
nants of small kingdoms, usually
maintained by force of arms, giving
Rajasthan its well-entrenched martial
tradition. Many cities in Rajasthan have
large forts originally built as defensive
strongholds, which in modern times
have been popular tourist attractions.
A miniature painting in the
Rajasthani style, circa 1730.
Geographically, the state is split diago-
nally by the Aravalli Hills, creating two
distinct climatic zones. The south gets
more rainfall and has traditionally been
more thickly settled, whereas the north
blends gradually into the Thar Desert—
rendered cultivable in recent years by a
system of irrigation canals. While the
state’s most important pilgrimage site is
the city of Pushkar, other locales of
interest abound. Among them, the tem-
ple of Hanuman at Mehndipur has
gained regional importance as a site for
curing mental illness, and the Karni
Mata temple in the village of Deshnok is
noted for its sacred rats. For general
information about Rajasthan and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference
is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed.,
Lonely Planet, 1998.
Rajasthani
One of the two influential “schools” of
Indian miniature painting, the other
being the Pahari. Distinctions between
the two schools are largely geographical
and thus somewhat arbitrary, since the
[[547]]
Rajasuya
Basohli paintings of the Pahari school
are stylistically closer to those of
Rajasthan than to works in the later
Pahari style.
The Rajasthani was the earliest
developed school; it flourished in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms of the Malwa region
such as Mandu, and in the kingdoms
that now comprise regions in modern
Rajasthan—particularly Bundi, Kota,
and Mewar, but also Jaipur and
Bikaner. The Rajasthani style is gener-
ally characterized by a flat perspective
and by visual power derived from vivid
colors, bands of which often serve as a
backdrop to the painting. For further
information see W. G. Archer, Indian
Painting, 1957.
Rajasuya
Royal consecration ceremony that is
one of the most famous of the sacrificial
rites that appear in the Vedas, the earli-
est and most authoritative Hindu reli-
gious texts. The ceremony is believed to
have developed in the latter part of the
Vedic era. Preparations for this rite could
last for a year, and the rite itself served
to raise the king to semidivine status. As
with many Vedic sacrifices, an impor-
tant part of the rajasuya sacrifice was
the ritual slaughter and offering of ani-
mals. This rite has long fallen into dis-
use, partly because of the trouble
required to prepare for it and partly
because of general disapproval over ani-
mal sacrifices. The coronation rite that
has replaced it is the rajabhiseka.
Rajatarangini
(“River of Kings”) Historical chronicle of
the kings of Kashmir, written in verse by
the Kashmiri poet Kalhana. The
Rajatarangini is an unusually descrip-
tive and accurate history of Kashmir and
the region’s political, social, and reli-
gious institutions; the text’s only short-
coming is that it pays little attention to
the outside world. Kalhana’s historical
emphasis is unusual for Indian writers,
[[548]]

and the Rajatarangini is one of the few
indigenous Indian histories.
Rajendra I
(r. 1014–42) Monarch under whose rule
(and that of his father, Raja Raja) the
Chola dynasty reached the apex of its
power, stretching its influence from the
Tanjore region in Tamil Nadu, through-
out southern India, and into southeast
Asia all the way to Malaysia. In 1023
Rajendra defeated one of the kings of
Bengal to extend his empire all the way
to the Ganges but was unable to main-
tain authority over this expansive
domain for long. He also fought a cam-
paign against the Shrivijaya Empire in
modern Malaysia, to retain control of
trade from China. Like his father,
Rajendra was a great patron of temple-
building and other public monuments,
including the great temple at Ganga-
ikondacholapuran, built to commemo-
rate the victory that opened the way to
the Ganges.
Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shri
(b. Mohan Chandra Rajneesh, 1931–
[[1990]]
) Controversial Hindu teacher who
mixed traditional Hindu teachings with
ideas gleaned from modern psychology.
He is most popularly associated with a
permissive attitude toward sexuality
that attracted many of his followers,
both Western and Indian, although the
former tended to predominate. This was
part of a more generally indulgent atti-
tude in which people were encouraged
to act upon their desires, as a way to
remove impediments to ultimate real-
ization. For some time his ashram was
located in Pune in the state of
Maharashtra, but in 1981 he relocated
to southern Oregon, propelled by local
opposition and an investigation by
Indian tax officials. For several years the
new site was highly successful, but local
opposition to his teachings and unease
about his lifestyle—he reportedly owned
ninety-three Rolls-Royces and was pro-
tected by Uzi-toting bodyguards—Raksha Bandhan
caused the spectacular collapse of this
community in 1985. Rajneesh returned
to India, where he eventually took up
residence in Pune again. In his last years
he changed his name several times—
once claiming that the spirit of
Gautama Buddha had entered him—
and at the time of his death had taken
the name Osho.
Rajput
(“king’s son”) Traditional Indian society
was modeled as a collection of endoga-
mous, or intermarried, subgroups
known as jatis (“birth”). These jatis were
organized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation, over which each jati had a
monopoly. The Rajputs were a martial
Hindu jati that at times ruled large parts
of western India, and have always
claimed to be kshatriyas—buttressing
this claim by creating genealogies link-
ing their families to the mythical Solar or
Lunar Lines of kings. Their origin is
uncertain, for they first appear around
the end of the first millennium, and
many scholars speculate that they were
descended from the Hunas and later
assimilated into the small kingdoms.
The four main Rajput clans were known
as the Agnikula (“fire lineage”), because
they claimed descent from a single
mythical king who had arisen from a
sacrificial fire pit in Mount Abu,
Rajasthan. These four ruling clans were
the Pariharas in southern Rajasthan, the
Chauhans in the region around Delhi,
the Solankis in Gujarat, and the Pawars
in western Madhya Pradesh.
Whatever their origin, the Rajputs
were warrior princes whose martial
code stressed death before dishonor
and swift reprisals against any insult.
During the Moghul Empire era
(1525–1707) Rajput kings were often
feudal vassals, given kingdoms in
exchange for their loyalty and service.
After the breakup of the Moghul Empire
many of them continued to reign as the
rulers of small princely states. They
remain an important ruling class even in
modern times, through the medium of
parliamentary politics.
Rajrajeshvar Temple
Massive temple in the city of Tanjore in
state of Tamil Nadu, dedicated to the
god Shiva in his form as “Lord of Kings.”
Tanjore was the capital of the Chola
dynasty, and this temple, built approxi-
mately 1000 C.E. by the Chola king Raja
Raja, conveys the confidence of a king-
dom on the rise. Architecturally speak-
ing, the temple is an enlargement of the
simplest sort of Hindu temple, with a
garbhagrha covered by a spire, but it is
breathtaking in its scale. The tower over
the central shrine is 190 feet high and
looks even higher, since the construc-
tion minimizes any distracting elements
that would arrest the eye’s upward
journey. It is capped by a single piece
of stone weighing an estimated
eighty tons, which required a four-mile-
long ramp to put in place. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Raksha Bandhan
Festival day celebrated on the full moon
in the lunar month of Shravan
(July–August); this festival’s theme is the
bond of protection (raksha) between
brother and sister. On this day sisters tie
(bandhan) a string around the brother’s
right wrist, which is sometimes just a
simple thread and sometimes an elabo-
rately constructed ornamental bracelet.
Sisters then mark a tilak (tika) on the
brother’s forehead as a sign of respect
and feed their brothers sweets. For their
part, brothers give their sisters money,
clothing, jewelry, or other gifts.
As with the festival of Bhaiya Duj,
Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the protec-
tive bond between brothers and sisters.
In the long term, brothers are seen as
the family members who will protect
their sisters’ interests—since in many
cases daughters long outlive their
fathers and their brothers are the natal
relatives on whom they must depend.
Sisters perform these rites to protect
[[549]]
Rakshasa
their brothers from misfortune—the
string tied around the wrist is believed
to ward off evil. The festival of Raksha
Bandhan is also performed by men and
women who are not related by blood but
who are close to one another. Tying on
the string “makes” them brother and sis-
ter, and thus rules out the potential for
any romantic involvement, which would
be seen as a form of incest.
Rakshasa
In Hindu mythology, a particular type of
asura (demon). Rakshasas are generally
considered to be extremely powerful—
not only in terms of their prodigious
physical strength but also in their con-
siderable skill in the magical arts. They
are also generally characterized as
malevolent toward human beings,
whom they not only kill but also eat.
According to one myth, rakshasas are
born from Brahma’s anger when he
becomes hungry while reciting the
Vedas. The capital of the rakshasas is in
Lanka, and their most celebrated leader
is Ravana, whose death at the hands of
Rama is the climax of the Ramayana,
the earlier of the two great Hindu epics.
Rakshasa Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty. The
rakshasas are a class of demon, and the
rakshasa form of marriage took place
when a man had intercourse with a
woman after carrying her away by force.
Not surprisingly, this was one of the four
reprehensible (aprashasta) forms of
marriage and was forbidden because of
the woman’s lack of consent, even
though it was deemed a valid marriage.
(Here the writers’ concern seems to have
been to give the “bride” legal status as a
wife rather than to legitimate the actions
of the “groom.”) Theoretically valid, this
form of marriage has been forbidden
since the dharma literature was first
codified in the centuries before the
common era. Although the rakshasa
[[550]]

marriage has never been one of the
accepted forms of marriage, there are
groups in which a ritualized battle and
capture of the bride is part of the wed-
ding ceremony. One could even inter-
pret the barat, the procession of the
groom and his family to the wedding
location, as a ritualized triumphal entry
following conquest. See also marriage,
eight classical forms, marriage cere-
monies, and marriage prohibitions.
Rakshasi
A female form of the type of demon
known as a Rakshasa.
Raktabija
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important textual source for the
worship of the Goddess, Raktabija is the
name of one of the demons vanquished
by the goddess Kali. Raktabija has
received the boon that any drop of his
blood falling to the earth will instantly
turn into another version of himself,
rendering him practically unconquer-
able. Kali defeats this demon by drink-
ing his blood as it is shed, until finally it
is completely gone, and so is he.
Raktadantika
(“bloody teeth”) Powerful and protective
form of the Goddess, particularly noted
for killing demons and drinking their
blood. During the fall festival of
Navaratri, in which the Goddess is wor-
shiped in a different form on nine suc-
cessive nights, Raktadantika is her
manifestation revered on the fifth night.
Rama (Rama Avatar)
The seventh avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, the crown prince of the
Solar Line and the protagonist of the
Ramayana, one of the two great Indian
epics. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,
Rama is born to destroy a being power-
ful enough to throw the cosmos out of
balance, in this case Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. The focal conflictRama (Rama Avatar)
in the Ramayana is Rama’s quest to
regain his wife Sita, who has been kid-
napped by Ravana. The climactic
sequence of the epic features Rama’s
struggle with Ravana, Ravana’s death,
and the reestablishment of cosmic equi-
librium, signified by Rama’s ascension
to divine kingship.
Unlike the god Krishna, whose
divine play (lila) often subverts or
ignores accepted social values, Rama is
a pillar of society. As a whole the
Ramayana tends to espouse and uphold
the traditional social values of religious
duty (dharma), social hierarchy (varna),
and the stages of life (ashrama). As the
epic’s protagonist, Rama is the epitome
of all these values. He is solid, depend-
able, stable, righteous, and predictable.
In Hindu culture Rama is the model of
the perfect son, and he shows this by
being utterly devoted to his parents,
giving far greater weight to his duties
as a son than as a husband. Unlike
Krishna, who has multiple liaisons
with his female devotees (bhakta), all in
the name of divine play, Rama is
married and monogamous. When
the time comes for battle, he is the
fiercest of combatants, incarnating
the warrior (kshatriya) ideal of using
strength to uphold justice, protect
the righteous, and punish the wicked.
In all these things he personifies some
of the most deeply embedded values
of Hindu culture.
Yet there are also some unsettling
incidents, particularly in the Valmiki
Ramayana, the epic’s earliest version.
These incidents either feature Rama
inexplicably stepping out of character
or else point to problematic tensions in
traditional Hindu values. In an attempt
to help the monkey-king Sugriva
against his rival Bali, Rama shoots Bali
in the back from a concealed place—
an action incompatible with the notion
of fair and honorable warfare. His
actions in enforcing the existing social
order also show its oppressive and
restrictive nature. In one incident, Rama
kills a low-status shudra whom he finds
The god Vishnu’s Rama avatar. In the Hindu epic
the Ramayana, Vishnu appears as Rama to defeat
Ravana, the demon king.
performing physical asceticism (tapas),
a privilege reserved for his betters, and
has molten lead poured in the ears of
another shudra who was discovered lis-
tening to the sacred Vedas—a forbid-
den act for such a person. Both
incidents show the hierarchical nature
of idealized Hindu society, and the
king’s role in preserving and sustaining
this hierarchy. When Rama and his
brother Lakshmana are propositioned
by Ravana’s sister Shurpanakha, they
first mislead and ridicule her, then
mutilate her by cutting off her ears
and nose. These actions seem incom-
patible with the kshatriya ethic of
respect for women and the righteous
use of force, and prompt Ravana to kid-
nap Sita in revenge.
Perhaps the most troubling ques-
tions arise from Rama’s behavior toward
his wife Sita. Immediately after being
liberated from enslavement, she under-
goes an ordeal by fire, from which her
emergence unscathed upholds her
[[551]]
Ramakrishna
claim that she remained chaste while
being held captive. Despite this defini-
tive proof, Rama later insists on a
second test, in which Sita, in protest, is
swallowed up by the earth. Thus, the
picture of Rama conveyed by the epic
is of a figure righteous by the standards
of his time but on occasion rigid
and inflexible.
In later versions of the Ramayana,
particularly the Ramcharitmanas by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
this picture subtly shifts, possibly in an
attempt to soften or remove these trou-
bling incidents. Certain changes in
Tulsidas’s text also highlight the central-
ity of devotion (bhakti) over all other
religious attitudes. Tulsidas’s Rama is
more explicitly portrayed as God incar-
nate, a figure who is aware of his divine
status and whose actions are undertaken
for the benefit of his devotees. This
Rama is still concerned with social val-
ues, particularly the kshatriya obligation
to uphold and protect religious duty
(dharma). Yet this ethic is in tension
with—and sometimes in opposition
to—the importance of bhakti, which is
portrayed as the ultimate religious goal.
These subtle shifts in the later text point
to an occasional conflict between two
differing ideals—dharma and bhakti—
both of which are affirmed as essential.

Ramakrishna
(1836–86) Bengali mystic and saint who
was one of the most remarkable figures
in the nineteenth-century revival of
[[552]]

Hinduism. Ramakrishna was the son of
a village priest and received little formal
education during his life. He retained
much of his rustic simplicity and spent
his adult life as a temple priest at the
Kali temple at Dakshineshwar, outside
the city of Calcutta. From his childhood
Ramakrishna had been devoted to the
Goddess Kali, and characterized him-
self as being “intoxicated with God.”
He sought and found the divine, first
through Kali but later through a variety
of other religious paths, including the
abstract monism of the speculative
Upanishads, devotion to the god
Vishnu, Christianity, and Islam. Out of
these experiences came his conviction
that the inner experience in all reli-
gious traditions was the same and led to
the same divine presence. Although
Ramakrishna did not publicize himself,
he became known in Calcutta’s religious
circles through his association with
Keshub Chander Sen, the leader of the
reformist Brahmo Samaj. This associa-
tion brought him disciples who would
spread his teachings, particularly
Narendranath Datta, better known as
Swami Vivekananda. For a devotee’s
perspective on Ramakrishna, see
Christopher Isherwood, Ramakrishna
and His Disciples, 1965; for a modern
psychological reading, see Jeffrey Kripal,
Kali’s Child, 1995.
Ramakrishna Mission
Hindu religious organization founded
in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda to prop-
agate the religious message of Vive-
kananda’s teacher, Ramakrishna. Since
its inception, the Ramakrishna Mission
has been equally dedicated to spiritual
uplifting and to social service, based on
Vivekananda’s realization that India
needed material development as much
as it needed religious instruction. The
mission has sought to fulfill part of this
charge by publishing inexpensive edi-
tions of religious texts, including but not
restricted to the teachings of Rama-
krishna and Vivekananda, and by spon-
soring social service in the fields ofRamanandi
education, medical care, and other
charitable works. For further informa-
tion see George M. Williams, “The
Ramakrishna Movement: A Study in
Religious Change,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Ramana Maharishi
(1879–1950) Modern Hindu sage, whose
life and message reiterated the funda-
mental insight of the ancient specula-
tive Upanishads, namely, that the inner
Self (atman) is identical with Supreme
Reality (Brahman). Ramana was born
into a middle-class Indian family and
during his youth demonstrated no
unusual abilities. In 1895 he obtained a
copy of the Periya Puranam, a text
chronicling the lives of the poet-saints
known as the Nayanars, and in reading
about their lives Ramana began to desire
to renounce the world. This inclination
was realized the next year, when he
imagined the death of his body and
reached the conclusion that his real
identity was the Self. He left his family
and went to the temple of Tiru-
vannamalai, also known as Arunachala,
where he remained until his death fifty-
four years later. For some time at the
start he was deep in meditation and
barely attended to his physical needs.
Soon he attracted disciples, through
whom his family eventually discovered
his whereabouts, although Ramana
refused to return home with them when
they came to see him. His mother
moved to Tiruvannamalai in 1916, and
after her death five years later Ramana
relocated his dwelling to be near her
grave. Although he spoke very seldom,
he managed to compose two short
works—Self-Enquiry and Who am I?—in
which he stated his basic insights. For
further information see T. M. P.
Mahadevan, Ramana Maharshi, 1977.
Ramananda
(14th c.?) Sant poet-saint who is tradi-
tionally cited as the spiritual teacher
(guru) of the poet-saints Kabir,
Ravidas, Pipa, and others. The Sants
were a group of poet-saints from central
and northern India who shared several
general tendencies: stress on individual-
ized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; disdain
for external ritual, particularly image
worship; faith in the power of the divine
name; and a tendency to ignore conven-
tional caste distinctions. Ramananda is
said to have been a charismatic spiritual
leader, and is claimed to have been a
direct disciple of the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, who sent
Ramananda north to help spread the
devotional movement. The latter claim
is almost certainly false, given that the
only verse incontestably attributable to
Ramananda is found in the Adigranth,
the scripture of the Sikh community.
This verse does not reflect Ramanuja’s
Shrivaishnava tradition, in which the
primary deity is Vishnu, but instead
shows the influence of the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who stressed yoga. There are
other verses ascribed to Ramananda in
later sources, but their authenticity is
doubtful, and little can be definitely
known about his life.
Ramanandi
Renunciant ascetics, devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu, who are by far the
most numerous and most influential of
the Vaishnava ascetics. The Ramanandis
claim that their order was founded by
the religious teacher Ramananda, about
whom little is definitely known. For
some time the Ramanandis maintained
that Ramananda had been a disciple of the
southern Indian philosopher Ramanuja,
and thus that their sect had sprung out
of Ramanuja’s Shrivaishnava religious
community, but this claim was for-
mally renounced after a dispute at the
Kumbha Mela festival in the city of
Ujjain in 1921. Ramananda is also tra-
ditionally thought to have been the
guru of many northern Indian bhakti
figures, most notably Kabir, Ravidas,
Pipa, and Sen, although on this matter
too there is little hard historical evidence.
[[553]]
Ramanand Sagar
All of the stories about Ramananda,
however, point to someone who was
firm in his commitment to devotion and
was willing to initiate people from all
walks of society.
The tutelary deity for the Ramanandi
ascetics is Rama, particularly as described
in the Ramcharitmanas, a vernacular ver-
sion of the epic Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?).
Tulsidas portrays Rama as God incar-
nate, come to earth for the benefit of his
devotees, and the text’s primary theme
is on the power of devotion. Yet within
the larger confines of the Ramanandi
fold there are several distinct variations
on practice, which have little or nothing
in common with one another. One
strand is that of the tyagis, who stress
renunciation and asceticism. A second
strand is that of the Nagas, who in earli-
er times were fighting ascetics but
whose military organization is now
important only during the bathing
(snana) processions for the Kumbha
Mela. The final strand is that of the
rasiks (“aesthetes”), whose religious
practice is based on highly complex
patterns of visualization in which they
imagine themselves as present in the
court of Rama itself; this sort of visual-
ization was undoubtedly imitated
from the patterns of Krishna devotion
as practiced in the Braj region. The
rasik tradition is by far the most liter-
ate and sophisticated; the tyagis and
the Nagas perform similar sorts of rites
as other ascetics, although their inter-
pretation and their chosen deity is
unique to their order. For further
information see Peter van der Veer,
Gods on Earth, 1988.
Ramanand Sagar
Director of the televised production of
the Ramayana, which was completed in
the late 1980s. The episodes were aired
each Sunday morning for about a year,
and were wildly successful despite prob-
lems with production quality. (Some of
these problems undoubtedly derived
from the difficulties of preserving the
[[554]]

immediacy of the oral experience of
traditional storytelling in the modern
medium of television.) In the mid-
[[1990]]
s Sagar devoted his attention to
other mythological television serials,
with an extended series on the life of
the god Krishna.
Ramanuja
(11th c.) Southern Indian philosopher
who was the greatest exponent of the
philosophical position known as
Vishishthadvaita (“qualified nondual-
ism”) Vedanta, and the most important
figure in the Shrivaishnava religious
community. Ramanuja lived most of his
life at the temple-town of Shrirangam
in the state of Tamil Nadu, in service of
the temple’s resident deity, Ranganatha,
a form of Vishnu. Ramanuja was con-
vinced that Brahman, or Supreme
Reality, was a personal deity rather than
an impersonal abstract principle, and he
was also convinced that devotion
(bhakti) was the most important form of
religious practice. Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions.
According to Ramanuja, in his essential
nature God is completely transcendent
and free from imperfections. The world
develops from God through a process of
evolution, an idea adapted from the
Samkhya philosophical school. The
world is thus similar to God, since it
proceeds from him, but also different,
since matter is unconscious and
insentient. In the same way, human
beings are similar in nature to God,
because they have him as their source,
though unlike God they are subject to
ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja
and his followers, God is not identical
to human selves or to the world, all of
which are perceived as having real and
independent existence. The differ-
ences in capacity between God and
human beings makes devotion the
most effective means to gain final lib-
eration (moksha) of the soul, a libera-
tion that is conceived of as eternal
communion with God. For furtherRamayana
information see Sarvepalli Radha-
krishnan and Charles A. Moore (eds.), A
Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, 1957;
and John B. Carman, The Theology of
Ramanuja, 1974.
Ramavali
(“Series [of poems] to Rama”) A series of
[[330]]
 short poems dedicated to the god
Rama, written in the Braj Bhasha form
of Hindi by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?). The Ramavali is one of
Tulsidas’ longest extant works—shorter
only than the Ramcharitmanas. The
seven sections in the Ramavali parallel
the structure of the Ramayana, but dif-
fering sections receive unequal empha-
sis. Tulsidas gives his greatest attention
to Rama’s childhood and paints lyrical
images of the child Rama’s divine play
(lila). Here Tulsidas clearly borrows
from devotional poetry to the god
Krishna, in which such childhood
images are well established. Yet the
Ramavali’s portrayal of Rama de-
emphasizes the mischievous qualities
associated with Krishna, to stress
instead the generally milder nature of
Rama, and to highlight the devotee’s
(bhakta) quiet delight in sharing his
divine presence.
Ramayana
One of the two great Sanskrit epics, tra-
ditionally ascribed to the mythical sage
Valmiki. The Ramayana is much shorter
than the other great epic, the
Mahabharata, and in many ways is a
less complex work. The Ramayana’s text
was composed later than the core story
of the Mahabharata, but the
Mahabharata’s final recension was
compiled after the Ramayana had been
fixed. The Mahabharata is the story of
an “evil” royal family for whom greed
and power-mongering ultimately lead
to destruction. In contrast, the
Ramayana is the tale of a “good” royal
family, and many of the epic’s characters
are symbols of established Indian family
values: Rama is the perfect son and the
virtuous king, Lakshmana and Bharata
his ideal younger brothers, and Sita the
model wife. Despite this, the story is not
without some troubling moral issues,
particularly connected with Rama’s
treatment of Sita.
The story has been altered some-
what over the years, with the most
important change being the elevation
of Rama to divine status as an avatar or
incarnation of the god Vishnu. The ear-
liest Ramayana, attributed to the sage
Valmiki, mentions Rama’s divinity only
in the first and last books, whereas in
other portions of the poem he is
described merely as a great hero. Given
the position of these references to
divinity, scholars speculate that they
could easily have been added to the
original core story of exile, abduction,
and revenge.
The text of the Ramayana is divided
into seven sections (khandas), each of
which has a different focus. In the open-
ing section, the Balakhanda (“childhood
section”), the text describes the birth of
Rama and his brothers (Lakshmana,
Bharata, and Shatrughna) to King
Dasharatha, and their lives as young
princes. Rama and his brothers take part
in an archery contest, sponsored by
King Janaka, at which Rama’s prowess
as an archer wins the hand of Janaka’s
daughter Sita. They are married and live
happily at Dasharatha’s court.
The Ayodhyakhanda (“Ayodhya sec-
tion”) tells how Dasharatha makes
preparations to anoint Rama as his suc-
cessor but how, on the night before the
ceremony, these plans are spoiled by
Rama’s stepmother Kaikeyi. Many years
before, Kaikeyi receives the offer of two
favors from Dasharatha, which she has
never used. At the suggestion of her
hunchback maid Manthara, Kaikeyi
demands of Dasharatha that Rama be
banished to the forest for fourteen years,
and that her son Bharata be crowned in
his place. This disaster seems grounded
in malice but is presented as the culmi-
nation of a curse placed on Dasharatha,
which predicts he will die bereft of his
sons. When informed of his stepmother’s

wish, Rama immediately prepares to
leave, refusing to seize the throne by
force, and Sita and Lakshmana
announce their intention to accompany
him. Bharata is put on the throne but
only as a regent in Rama’s place, and the
heart-broken Dasharatha dies of grief.
In the Aranyakhanda (“Forest sec-
tion”), Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita settle
into life in forest exile. Rama and
Lakshmana kill many of the demons
(rakshasas) who plague the forest-
dwellers, thus bringing peace to the
area. One day the female demon
Shurpanakha comes to their dwelling,
is smitten by the two young men, and
asks them to marry her. The brothers
first mock her, then mutilate her by cut-
ting off her ears and nose. Shurpanakha
goes to her brother Ravana, the demon-
king of Lanka, and demands revenge for
the attack. When frontal assaults fail,
Ravana commands his uncle Maricha to
assume the form of a golden deer in
order to lure Rama away from his hut. At
Sita’s behest, Rama pursues the deer
after giving Lakshmana strict orders not
to leave Sita’s side. Rama slays the deer,
which with its dying breath calls out
Lakshmana’s name in a voice that mim-
ics Rama’s. Sita hears the call and flies
into a rage when Lakshmana refuses to
leave her. She finally drives him off, in
an uncharacteristic show of temper, by
accusing him of neglecting his brother
in a time of peril so that he can have Sita
to himself. When Lakshmana departs,
Ravana comes to Sita disguised as a
mendicant ascetic. He lures her out of a
protective magic circle that Lakshmana
has drawn around her, then kidnaps her.
Ravana’s escape is briefly delayed by a
virtuous vulture named Jatayu, who
attempts to rescue Sita. In the ensuing
combat Jatayu is mortally wounded, but
he lives long enough for Rama and
Lakshmana to find him and learn the
identity of Sita’s abductor.
The Kishkindhakhanda (“Kishkindha
section”) narrates Rama’s and Laksh-
mana’s trip south to the Kishkindha
forest. There they become allies with
the monkey-king Sugriva, whose lost
kingdom Rama helps to regain by slay-
ing Sugriva’s brother Bali. After enjoy-
ing the spoils of kingship, Sugriva and
his monkey subjects, particularly his
lieutenant Hanuman, begin searching
throughout the country for any trace
of Sita. Hanuman decides to leap over
the sea, to Lanka, to see if he can find
her there.
The Sundarakhanda (“Beautiful sec-
tion”) begins with Hanuman leaping the
sea to Lanka and describes how, after
much searching, he finally manages to
locate Sita. Meanwhile, Ravana unsuc-
cessfully tries to convince Sita to accept
him as her husband. The demon’s
actions are motivated by his desire
to avoid a curse, which states that he
will drop dead if he ever rapes a woman
who resists him. Hanuman reassures
Sita that all will be well, and after
many adventures makes his way back
to Rama, to inform him that Sita has
been found.
The Lankakhanda (“Lanka section”)
describes the beginning of a war
between the forces of Rama and Ravana.
Aided by armies of monkeys and bears,
Rama builds a causeway across the sea
to Lanka and begins to besiege the city.
In his struggle he is helped by Ravana’s
youngest brother Vibhishana, who
opposes Ravana’s evil deeds and casts in
his lot with Rama. Ravana is assisted by
his brother Kumbhakarna and his son
Indrajit, but in the end Ravana and his
demon allies are killed in battle. After
being rescued, Sita undergoes a trial by
fire to prove her chastity, and when the
fire refuses to burn her, she is shown to
have been completely faithful to Rama.
They return in triumph to Ayodhya,
where Bharata renounces the throne,
and the couple rule happily.
In the “Final section” (Uttarakhanda),
which was almost certainly added later,
Rama has further doubts about Sita’s
virtue. While roaming the capital one
night, he hears a washerman abusing
his wife for staying out all night. The
washerman says that he is not as big a
fool as their king. Rama is troubled by
this and, although he is supposedly
[[557]]
Rambha Ekadashi
convinced of Sita’s innocence, sends her
into exile to please his subjects—here
showing a distrust uncharacteristic of a
figure who supposedly represents the
epitome of virtue. While in exile, Sita
gives birth to twin sons, Lava and
Kusha, whose prowess makes them
known to Rama, and they are eventually
acknowledged as his heirs. Yet after all
her suffering, Sita is not amenable to
reconciliation. As a final proof she calls
on her mother, the Earth, to bear wit-
ness to her virtue, and as a sign that this
is true Sita sinks beneath the earth,
never to be seen again. Soon after, Rama
himself leaves his body and takes again
his true form as Vishnu.
The Ramayana has been an extremely
influential text, primarily because of the
social virtues modeled by its characters.
The epic is known throughout the sub-
continent, and its popularity can be
seen by its numerous retellings in ver-
nacular languages, of which the most
famous are the Tamil Ramayana of
the poet Kamban (9th c.), and the
Ramcharitmanas
of
the
poet-
saint Tulsidas (17th c.). The epic
continues to be a prominent text in
the modern day, as witnessed by its
astounding popularity as a weekly tele-
vision serial produced in the mid-1980s
under the direction of Ramanand
Sagar. The Valmiki Ramayana has been
translated numerous times, the most
recent partial translation of the work is
by Robert Goldman and Sheldon
Pollack. See also Tamil epics.
Rambha Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). As with all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of the god
Vishnu, on this particular day in his
form as Krishna. As with most Hindu
festivals, Rambha Ekadashi requires that
certain rites be performed. These rites
involve fasting (upavasa) and worship,
and promise specific benefits for faithful
[[558]]

performance. This ceremony is named
after Rambha, a famous apsara or celes-
tial damsel. Its charter myth tells how, by
faithfully observing this rite, a certain
king was born in heaven and served by
Rambha and other apsaras.
Ramcharitmanas
(“Holy Lake of Rama’s Deeds”) Vernacular
retelling of the Ramayana, the earlier of
the two great Sanskrit epics. The
Ramcharitmanas was written by the
poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623), in the
language known as Avadhi, an eastern
variant of medieval Hindi. Evidence
indicates that Tulsidas began the text
in Ayodhya in 1574. At nearly 10,000
lines, this text is by far his longest work
and is generally considered to be his
greatest. For the most part the poem is
structured in groups of six to eight
verses written in the chaupai form, fol-
lowed by a verse in the shorter doha
form. (The doha verse either sums up
the essence of the preceding chaupai
verses or serves to foreshadow later
developments.) There are also verses
written in longer meters such as
savaiya, as well as invocations in fluid
Sanskrit poetry at the beginning of
each of the seven sections. Tulsidas
was a masterful epic poet, as evi-
denced both by the sheer size of his
text and the high poetic quality of the
verses contained in it.
As with all the Ramayana’s vernacu-
lar retellings, Tulsidas did not merely
translate the story of Rama but inter-
preted it according to his own religious
convictions. His two most important
changes to the poem are the over-
whelming emphasis on the importance
of devotion (bhakti), and the saving
power of the name of Rama, to which
Tulsidas gives greater importance than
Rama himself. Tulsidas also includes
mythic material from a variety of other
sources, most notably the Shiva Purana
and the Adhyatmaramayana. This
material is largely added to the first and
last chapters, in which Tulsidas makes
his greatest changes from the originalRameshvar
epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas
brought in this other material argues
that he endeavored to transcend narrow
sectarian boundaries, for example, by
having the god Shiva narrate much of
the text in the form of a dialogue to his
wife Parvati. Later, in part of the final
book, Shiva is supplanted as narrator by
the crow Bhushundi, who symbolizes
the power of devotion to rescue even a
common carrion-eating crow.
The Ramcharitmanas has popularly
been called the “Bible of northern
India,” reflecting its enormous influence
on ordinary people’s piety. Although
according to legend Tulsidas faced some
opposition from brahmins who thought
it sacrilegious to translate the Ramayana
into a vernacular tongue, the text has
been immensely popular with ordinary
people. Even now there are many people
who can recite large sections from
memory (“discourses” (katha) on the
text can draw hundreds or thousands
of people) and many of the verses have
become proverbial expressions in
modern Hindi. Aside from reading or
hearing the text, millions of people see
it each autumn, in the dramatic pre-
sentation known as the Ram Lila. The
oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,
held at Ramnagar in Benares, uses the
text from the Ramcharitmanas, and
takes great pride in this traditionalism.

Lutgendorf, The Life of a Text, 1991.
Ramdev
(1404–58) According to legend, a Rajput
prince whose piety and ability to per-
form miracles won him renown during
his lifetime, and who was considered an
incarnation of the god Krishna after his
death. His tomb in the village of
Ramdevra, east of the city of Jaisalmer
in the western part of the state of
Rajasthan, has become a pilgrimage site
for devotees (bhakta) who come seeking
various favors. Little is known about
Ramdev’s life, and unlike many of the
other medieval saints, he has no poetry
or body of literature attributed to him,
nor did he serve as the leader of any
organized religious community. His
original followers came to him because
he was able to meet their needs, and for
this reason pilgrims come to him still.
Ramdevra
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
northwest corner of the state of
Rajasthan, about sixty miles east of the
city of Jaisalmer. Ramdevra is famous for
the grave of the fifteenth-century saint
Ramdev, as well as the grave of his low-
caste disciple Dadi Bhai. During his life-
time Ramdev was famous for his piety
and generosity, and was credited with
performing various miracles to aid those
in need. Since his death he has come to
be regarded as an incarnation of the god
Krishna. Although pilgrims can come
throughout the year, most come during
the annual religious fair (mela), at which
time the near-deserted town takes on
the semblance of a bustling city. Many
of the visitors come to ask Ramdev
for something, often related to
concerns over health or prosperity.
Others come to show gratitude, espe-
cially those whose past wishes have
been granted, and to maintain their
relationship with him.
Rameshvar
Manifestation of the god Shiva, in his
form as “Rama’s Lord” at Rameshvaram
in the state of Tamil Nadu. The image of
Rameshvar at this site is a linga, a pillar-
shaped object said to represent Shiva’s
symbolic form. The Rameshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy
and powerful, and at which Shiva is
thought to be uniquely present. The
site’s mythic charter is drawn from the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two
Sanskrit epics. According to tradition,
Shiva is worshiped here by the god
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, although
there are differing accounts of when this
happened. In some stories, it is to gain
Shiva’s blessing immediately before
[[559]]
Rameshvaram
Rama’s attack on the demon kingdom of
Lanka. In other accounts the worship
comes after the conquest of Lanka, as a
rite of thanksgiving. In either case, both
sets of stories portray Rama as a devotee
(bhakta) of Shiva and thus buttress
Shiva’s status as the greatest god of all.
Rameshvaram
(“Rama’s Lord”) Sacred site (tirtha) on
an island off the coast of the state of
Tamil Nadu in the Palk Strait, which sep-
arates Sri Lanka from the mainland.
Rameshvaram is one of the most impor-
tant sacred sites in India, for several dif-
ferent reasons. It is one of the four
dhams associated with the philosopher
Shankaracharya, which mark the geo-
graphical boundaries of the subconti-
nent. It also has specific mythic
associations that make it holy both to
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva and Vishnu,
two of the most important Hindu
deities. For Shiva’s devotees, the pillar-
shaped image (linga) of Shiva there rep-
resents the god in his manifestation as
Rameshvar (“Rama’s Lord”). This image
is also one of the jyotirlingas, a network
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy
and powerful, and at which Shiva is said
to be uniquely present. For Vishnu’s
worshipers, Rameshvaram is held to be
the place from which the god Rama
staged his attack on the demon king-
dom of Lanka. According to tradition,
upon Rama’s return with his rescued
wife Sita, the image of Rameshvaram
was consecrated in gratitude for his suc-
cess. Rameshvaram also has very old
connections with the sacred city of
Benares, and even today pilgrims come
from there bearing Ganges water to
offer to Shiva.
Ramgarh
Architectural site in the Vindhya Hills,
[[160]]
 miles south of Benares. An inscrip-
tion in one of the caves at Ramgarh,
estimated to be from the third
century B.C.E., contains the earliest
datable reference to devadasis, a
[[560]]

special class of women who served the
deities of certain temples.
Ram Janam Bhumi
Site in the city of Ayodhya, where some
claim the god Rama was born; since the
early 1980s this spot has witnessed some
of India’s most intense postindepen-
dence religious conflict. The site has
long been a source of controversy
between the Hindu and Muslim com-
munities, and British sources record
hostilities there in 1855 and 1934. Until
[[1992]]
 Ram Janam Bhumi was occupied
by the Babri Masjid, a mosque con-
structed in 1528 by command of Mir
Baqi, a general of the Moghul emperor
Babar (1483–1530). Local tradition holds
that the mosque was built after the raz-
ing of an existing Hindu temple there,
although there is little evidence for this
claim. A few months after India gained
independence in 1947, several local
Hindus secretly installed images of the
child Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother
Lakshmana in the mosque, claiming
that the images had miraculously
appeared in a ball of light. The govern-
ment, having only recently quieted the
Hindu-Muslim massacres that accom-
panied the partition of British India into
India and Pakistan, was loath to ignite
religious passions, and its solution,
therefore, was to padlock the com-
pound’s gates and send the case to the
courts for resolution, where it lan-
guished for almost forty years.
The early 1980s saw renewed contro-
versy over the site, when the Vishva
Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu nation-
alist organization, first began calling for
the site’s “liberation,” proclaiming that
the existing mosque was an insult to all
Hindus. The VHP’s campaign portrayed
the mosque as a symbol of Muslim icon-
oclasm and depicted government efforts
to protect it as an attempt to appease
the Muslim community and retain their
votes. In 1986, the VHP’s drive to liberate
the site was aided by Rajiv Gandhi’s
national government. Together, the VHP
and the Gandhi administrationRam Lila

succeeded in unlocking the com-
pound’s gates so that Hindus could
worship there, though observers called
the action a clear bid to attract the
Hindu vote.
Pressure throughout the 1980s, cul-
minated in a series of campaigns to
begin construction of a new temple at
Ram Janam Bhumi. Many of these cam-
paigns coincided with national elec-
tions, and the emotion that they
generated boosted the electoral fortunes
of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a
political group with close links to the
VHP. The final campaign came on
December 6, 1992, a day that was sched-
uled to have “symbolic” meaning, and
ended a little over five hours later with
the mosque’s demolition. The whole
operation was carefully planned—
demolition crews ordered the destruc-
tion of all television cameras prior to
leveling the building in order to prevent
any media coverage by outsiders. The
razing was also carried out with the
blessing of the BJP-led state government,
which made no attempt to protect the
temple. Riots ensued, particularly in the
city of Bombay, where over three
thousand people were killed, most of
them Muslims.
Even after the destruction of the
Babri Masjid, the site remained an area
of contention between Muslims and
Hindus. Immediately after the demoli-
tion, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
promised to rebuild the mosque but did
nothing to accomplish this during the
next five years he was in office.
Meanwhile, various Hindu groups have
been calling for the construction of a
Ram Janam Bhumi temple, including
traditional religious leaders such as the
Shankaracharyas. Seeing nothing but
trouble ahead, the government again
sent the matter to the courts for resolu-
tion, where it remains to this day and
may remain for decades to come. For
further information see Christophe
Jaffrelot, The Hindu Nationalist
Movement in India, 1996.
Ram Lila
Any public dramatic presentation of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. The epic’s basic plot
[[561]]
Ramnagar
revolves around the unjust exile of the
god-king Rama; the abduction of
Rama’s wife Sita by Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka; and Rama’s
search to regain Sita, a struggle that
ultimately ends in Ravana’s death. Ram
Lilas are prominent during the autumn
in northern India, and usually corre-
spond with the festival of Dussehra
(October–November), which celebrates
Rama’s victory over Ravana and thus the
symbolic triumph of good over evil. Late
in the nineteenth century the Ram Lilas
were important symbolic vehicles for
demonstrating pride in Indian culture.
Additionally, they were considered a
coded symbol of resistance to British
rule. Today, Ram Lilas can be found
throughout northern India in many of
the larger cities, while neighborhood
associations often sponsor their own
local productions.
The longest, most elaborate, and
arguably the oldest Ram Lila is held at
Ramnagar, the fortified town where the
kings of Benares reside. The Ramnagar
Ram Lila was begun in the early nine-
teenth century, during the reign of Udit
Narayan Singh, and the Maharaja of
Benares still plays an important symbolic
role in the production even though he
no longer wields temporal power over
the city. It lasts for thirty-one days, dur-
ing which the action moves to different
places in and around Ramnagar.
Thousands of faithful viewers follow the
drama for the entire month, but on peak
days the audience can reach 100,000.
For further information on the Ram Lila,
see Norvin Hein, The Miracle Plays of
Mathura, 1972; and Anaradha Kapur,
Actors, Pilgrims, Kings, and Gods, 1990.
Ramnagar
Fortified city just south and across the
Ganges from the sacred city of Benares
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The
Maharajas of Benares built their fort on
this site because it was relatively easy to
defend, and continue to live there,
although they no longer possess ruling
power. Ramnagar is famous as the site of
[[562]]

the oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,
a production of the epic Ramayana
dramatized in a month of nightly
shows. Aside from sponsoring this Ram
Lila and underwriting its costs, the
royal family also continues to play an
important symbolic role in the produc-
tion itself. For further information see
Anuradha Kapur, Actors, Pilgrims,
Kings, and Gods, 1990.
Ram Navami
Festival celebrated on the ninth day of
the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April). Ram
Navami is celebrated as the birthday of
the god Rama, the seventh avatar of the
god Vishnu, and this festival also ends
the spring Navaratri festival of the
Goddess. The Goddess festival of
Navaratri, observed twice yearly in the
spring and in the fall, ends each time
with a celebration for Rama. The reason
for this festival sequence is not entirely
clear but probably reflects cultural
imperatives to contain the explosive but
uncontrolled fertile feminine energy
personified by the Goddess with the sta-
ble and predictable masculine energy of
Rama. Ram Navami is widely celebrated
across India, but especially in Ayodhya,
the city traditionally deemed his birth-
place. In their celebrations, devotees
(bhakta) may worship in their homes,
fast (upavasa), attend religious dis-
courses (katha), or go to temples for
darshan and worship. With the recent
growth of Hindutva (militant, politi-
cized Hinduism) this holiday has
become a day for large demonstrations
and political action. This has been
particularly true in Ayodhya, where the
continuing struggle to build the Ram
Janam Bhumi temple at the site of
Rama’s birthplace has made this day
particularly significant.
Ramprasad
(early 19th c.) Bengali poet-saint and
devotee (bhakta) of the goddess Kali,
who is justly renowned for the powerRam Rasik Sampraday
and expressive quality of his poems. As
with many of the devotional (bhakti)
figures, little is definitely known about
his life. According to tradition, he
worked for a short time as a clerk before
his indulgent employer, finding him
spending his days composing poetry to
Kali, became his literary patron to allow
him to write full time. Ramprasad’s
poetry invokes the Goddess in many of
her different personae—as the goddesses
Uma, Durga, and Bhairavi—but the
majority of his poems are addressed to
Kali. Despite Kali’s fearsome qualities,
Ramprasad persistently addresses her as
“mother,” and, like a child, clings to her
despite all her attempts to discourage
him. The end result is that his unflinch-
ing and unquestioning devotion to Kali
removes all fear and brings him libera-
tion. For further reading, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975;

(trans.), Grace and Mercy in Her Wild
Hair, 1999.
Ram Rajya Parishad
(“Organization for Ram’s Reign”)
Northern Indian political party formed
immediately after Indian independence
in 1947. It was founded by Swami
Karpatri, an influential modern Hindu
ascetic. The term Ram Rajya carries
mythical significance, referring to the
period of righteous rule by the god-king
Rama, the protagonist of the epic
Ramayana, after his return from four-
teen years of exile in the forest.
According to popular belief, Rama’s
reign was marked by perfect peace, jus-
tice, and social harmony.
The Ram Rajya Parishad sought to
reshape India according to the vision of
this mythical time, and the party’s polit-
ical platform was solidly rooted in con-
servative Hindu religious ideas. The
party strongly supported the caste sys-
tem, with its traditional division of
social status and labor, and believed that
it was essential for a smoothly function-
ing society. This position would have
condemned most low-caste people to a
life of servitude, although the party did
leave them a few meager windows for
advancement. One of these was manag-
ing shoe factories, since leather is con-
sidered religiously impure by the higher
castes, and thus working with leather is
the traditional occupation of certain low
status groups. Aside from their views on
the validity of the caste system, the Ram
Rajya Parishad also supported other
conservative Hindu causes, particularly
a total ban on cow slaughter and a com-
plete ban on the production and con-
sumption of liquor. The Ram Rajya
Parishad’s constituency came mainly
from conservative, upper-class Hindus,
particularly those in the Ganges River
basin. Its conservatism gave those out-
side this group no incentive to support
it. Although it had limited electoral suc-
cess in years immediately after indepen-
dence, within a dozen years the party
had been reduced to a completely mar-
ginal presence.
Ram Rasik Sampraday
Religious lineage among the Ramanandis,
a community of renunciant ascetics. All
Ramanandis are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Rama, but members of the
Ram Rasik Sampraday stress the wor-
ship of Rama and his wife Sita as the
divine couple. They focus their wor-
ship on the time of domestic bliss
when the newly married couple lived in
Ayodhya, before Rama’s unjust banish-
ment from that city. Rasik (“aesthete”)
devotion involves complex forms of
visualization, in which devotees imag-
ine themselves to be servants and com-
panions of Rama and Sita, and spend
their days in service to the divine cou-
ple. Rasik devotees also draw up exact-
ing “schedules” of the deities’ daily
routines—in some cases, down to the
quarter-hour—so that through this
imaginative exaltation they can savor
the bliss of being God’s companions.
(This form of dedication is clearly influ-
enced by devotional patterns to the god
Krishna, particularly the divine rever-
ence found in the Gaudiya Vaishnava
[[563]]
Ramsnehi
religious community.) Because Rasik
worship is complex and highly devel-
oped, it has remained an elite phenom-
enon largely confined to a small
group of ascetics. For further informa-
tion see Peter van der Veer, Gods on
Earth, 1988; and Philip Lutgendorf,
The Life of a Text, 1991.
Ramsnehi
Renunciant ascetic community made
up of devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu—in his form as the god Rama—
whose practice stresses the love (sneha)
of Rama. The Ramsnehis have three
main centers, all located in the state of
Rajasthan. These centers are unique in
that each pays homage only to its own
founder, and no founder or preceptor is
honored by all three. Ramsnehi religious
practice focuses on the repetition of the
name of Rama, but has also been influ-
enced by the Jains. Because of this latter
influence the Ramsnehis voluntarily
take on many restrictions to avoid
destroying life.
Ranade, Mahadev Govind
(1842–1901) Lawyer, judge, and one of
the great Hindu social reformers of
nineteenth-century India. Along with
his younger contemporary, Gopal
Krishna Gokhale, Ranade was marked
by his commitment to reform Hindu life
by seeking the cooperation of the British
government and by working within
established institutions. Ranade was
among the first generation of Indians to
be educated in British schools and, after
earning his degree at Bombay
University, chose a career in law. In thirty
years as a judge Ranade worked dili-
gently to reform certain religious prac-
tices that were deemed social abuses,
particularly issues concerning child
marriage and widow remarriage. He was
also a founding member of the
Prarthana Samaj, a Hindu reformist
organization that sought to attain simi-
lar goals. In addition to his interests in
law, Ranade applied himself to the study
[[564]]

of economics, to provide practical guid-
ance for economic development.
Ranganatha
(“the rocking lord”) A particular form of
the god Vishnu, in which the god is
depicted as sleeping on the back of
his serpent couch, Shesha, floating in
the sea of cosmic dissolution (pralaya).
The most famous example of this image
is housed in the Ranganathaswamy
temple in Shrirangam, in the state of
Tamil Nadu.
Rasa
(“tastes”) In Indian aesthetics, the nine
moods that can be generated in an audi-
ence by various types of artistic expres-
sion: erotic, comic, compassionate,
cruel, heroic, terrifying, loathsome,
marvelous, and peaceful. These nine
rasas correspond to the nine bhavas
(“states”): sexual excitement, laughter,
grief, anger, energy, fear, loathing, won-
der, and peace. The nine bhavas are
considered to be the most basic unadult-
erated emotions, and although each of
the rasas corresponds to one of the
bhavas, there is an important difference.
Human emotive states come and go in
response to circumstances largely
beyond our control. Such emotive states
often cannot be sustained, and they are
generally not objects of aesthetic satis-
faction. The case is very different for an
aesthetic mood (rasa), which can be sus-
tained, since it is artificially generated
through artistic expression. This
emphasis on creating and sustaining
such a mood for an audience is the
dominant goal of the performing arts in
the Hindu tradition.
Rasayana
(“method of essences”) Alchemical
school specializing in the use of certain
chemicals, particularly compounds
made from elemental mercury, in a
quest to transmute the body and render
it immortal. Some scholars have charac-
terized rasayana as the Buddhist schoolRashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
of alchemy, with the Hindu school
known as dhatuvada. The reported dif-
ference is that the latter relied solely on
the consumption of mercurials, whereas
the former used mercurials only to pro-
long life until the body could be trans-
muted through meditation, ritual, and
extramaterial means. Despite these dif-
fering conceptions of the end of the
process, the two schools overlap consid-
erably on many other points. Both also
probably draw from a common alchem-
ical tradition. For further information
see David Gordon White, The Alchemical
Body, 1996.
Rashtrakuta Dynasty
(8th–10th c.) Central Indian dynasty
whose core area was in the middle of
Maharashtra, and whose capital was
the Maharashtrian city of Achalpur. The
Rashtrakutas were originally vassals of
the Chalukya dynasty, but overthrew
them in the middle of the eighth century
and remained the premier power south
of the Vindhya Mountains until the
middle of the tenth century. The dynasty
directly ruled most of the modern states
of Maharashtra and Karnataka, along
with parts of the states of Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, but had vassal
states through the entire Deccan
plateau, southern India, and Ceylon.
Their hegemony ended in 973, when
they were overthrown by the later
Chalukya dynasty. The Rashtrakutas’
greatest monument is the Kailasanatha
temple at Ellora in the state of
Maharashtra, which was completed late
in the eighth century.
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
(“National Volunteer Corps,” hereafter
RSS ) Hindu nationalist organization
founded in 1925 by Dr. K. B.
Hedgewar. Since its inception the RSS
has ascribed to the ideals of Hindutva,
the notion that the Hindus are a
nation despite their regional, linguis-
tic, and cultural differences. The RSS
has historically characterized itself as
In their daily meetings, members of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh practice martial drills that
include sparring with sticks.
a cultural and character-building
organization and, for much of its exis-
tence, has shunned direct political
involvement, although it has exercised
considerable influence through its
many affiliated organizations.
RSS training stresses loyalty, obedi-
ence, discipline, and dedication to the
advancement of the Hindu nation, but
does not encourage the development of
independent thought. The heart of its
program are the daily meetings of its
neighborhood units known as shakhas
(“branches”). At these meetings mem-
bers, known as svayamsevaks (“volun-
teers”), spend part of their time playing
games, part of their time practicing mar-
tial drill—including sparring with
sticks—and part of their time discussing
and absorbing RSS ideals. The shakhas in
any given area are overseen by a full-
time RSS worker known as a pracharak
(“director”), who serves as a liaison
between the local units and the RSS lead-
ership and who oversees RSS activity in
his area.
As an organization, the RSS is pro-
foundly elitist, and its self-proclaimed
[[565]]
Rasik
mission is to provide leadership for a
renascent Hindu India. Most of its
members will never advance beyond
the local level, but those who do are
generally remarkably efficient, effective
leaders. Although the RSS has shunned
direct activism that would tarnish its
self-proclaimed cultural emphasis, it
has exercised considerable influence
through the formation of affiliated orga-
nizations, for which it has provided the
leadership cadre. These organizations
are spread throughout every level of
Indian society, from labor and student
unions to service organizations, reli-
gious organizations such as the Vishva
Hindu Parishad (VHP), and political par-
ties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Although the RSS has produced some
remarkably effective leaders, it has also
generated considerable controversy.
One reason is that it is a highly authori-
tarian organization, run on the model of
the Hindu joint family. All authority is
vested in a single supreme leader, the
sarsanghchalak, and proceeds down-
ward from there. In this way the RSS is
profoundly undemocratic, and many of
its opponents—particularly in the polit-
ical arena—have felt uneasy about hav-
ing it as the controlling hand behind
its affiliated organizations. Other
opponents have also worried about its
anti-Muslim and anti-Christian tone—
non-Hindus were not allowed to join the
organization until 1979—a tone rooted
in the organization’s Hindutva ideals. A
final reservation about the RSS comes on
social grounds. The RSS has long con-
demned untouchability, and has also
long asserted that caste distinctions did
not exist within its ranks—in keeping
with its Hindutva roots, it proclaims that
all its members are Hindus and Hindus
only. Nevertheless, critics have noted
that most RSS members come from
brahmin and other privileged castes,
and that all of its leaders have been
brahmins. These critics contend that
such public disavowal of caste distinc-
tions is a mask to perpetuate brahmin
control and to conceal whose interests
the RSS truly serves. For further informa-

Rasik
Person able to appreciate a developed
artistic mood (rasa); someone who is
cultured and sophisticated. In the con-
text of religious practice, the word refers
to a person who has transposed this
appreciation of aesthetic mood into a
devotional setting. Rasik devotees
(bhakta) would engage in elaborate
visualizations of their chosen divinity
and mentally accompany that divinity
during the day. These meditative visual-
izations were said to give the devotee a
sense of participation in the divine play
(lila) of God’s presence on earth and
thus sharpen his or her enjoyment of
it. The two religious communities that
laid the greatest stress on this ability
were the Pushti Marg and the Ram
Rasik Sampraday, whose objects of
devotion were the gods Krishna
and Rama, respectively. This type of
worship is almost exclusively focused
on these deities, or on other forms of
the god Vishnu.
Raskhan
(late 16th c.) Poet-saint and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna who was
born a Muslim, specifically a Pathan
(Afghan) and whose name may have
been Saiyid Ibrahim. According to leg-
end, Raskhan spent the early part of his
life in Delhi, where he became enam-
ored of a handsome boy. When the
object of his affections proved unattain-
able, he migrated to Brindavan, theRath Yatra
town where Krishna is said to have lived
as a child, and spent the rest of his life
sublimating that attraction through his
devotion to Krishna. The main themes
in his poetry are the attraction of the
cowherd women (gopis) to Krishna,
sparked by Krishna’s physical beauty
and, especially, the enthralling music
of his flute. With Raskhan one finds
a person who was a Muslim by birth
but who used images and attitudes
belonging to Hindu culture in an
absolutely genuine manner.
Ras Lila
In the mythology of the god Krishna, the
ras lila is the “circle dance” that Krishna
and his devotees (bhakta), the gopis,
perform on autumn nights on the shore
of the Yamuna River. In this dance—a
symbol of communion with the divine—
Krishna offers a form of himself to every
woman present, in order to convince
each one that God is paying attention to
her and to her alone.
Rat
An animal with a prominent place in at
least two religious contexts. On one
hand, the rat is famous as the animal
vehicle of the elephant-headed god
Ganesh, and reinforces Ganesh’s iden-
tity as the Lord of Obstacles. If Ganesh’s
elephant head represents his power to
remove obstacles by simply knocking
them aside, his rat vehicle shows a
stealthier approach. Rats are famous
for their ability to work their way
around obstacles, slipping through the
smallest cracks in granaries to get to
the grain inside. In their ability to slip
around and between obstructing
objects, they stand as a worthy comple-
ment to Ganesh’s power.
Rats are also important to the temple
of the goddess Karni Mata in the village
of Deshnok, in the state of Rajasthan.
The Karni Mata temple is inhabited by
thousands of rats, considered to be
Karni Mata’s sons and thus sacred ani-
mals. According to tradition, when the
rats die they are reborn as members of
the families that comprise the temple’s
hereditary servants, and thus the rats
and the temple priests are all members
of one extended family.
Rath Yatra
Festival falling on the second day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month
of Ashadh ( June–July). The primary
deity worshiped in this festival is
Jagannath, who is considered a form of
the god Krishna. This festival is cele-
brated all over India but especially in the
sacred city of Puri, where the principal
temple of Jagannath is located. During
the festival in Puri, Jagannath, his brother
Balabhadra, and his sister Subhadra
are carried in procession through the
city’s main street to another temple
about a mile away. They stay in this
nearby temple for a week, and then
return to the Jagannath temple.
The deities are processed by their
devotees (bhakta) in three enormous
wooden chariots (rath), which the devo-
tees pull using long ropes. The largest of
the three, belonging to Jagannath, is
forty-five feet high, thirty-five feet broad
and wide, and travels on sixteen wheels
each seven feet high. The English word
“juggernaut” is a corruption of Jagannath,
and the connotation of a juggernaut as
an unstoppable force undoubtedly
derives from the momentum that these
carts attained once they began to
move. One of the staple fictions of
British colonial lore described Jagannath’s
frenzied devotees committing suicide
by throwing themselves under the
car’s wheels, so that they would die in
the sight of God. Despite such tales
being widely repeated, suicides of this
sort were extremely uncommon. Still,
there was some risk in pulling the
carts, since people losing their footing
in the massed crowd would be unable
to get up, and could potentially be
crushed by the wheels. For further
information see T. N. Madan (ed.),
Religion in India, 1991.

Rati
Relief sculpture of the demon king Ravana from Angkor, Cambodia. As the antagonist of the Hindu epic,
the Ramayana, Ravana acquires great magical powers, which he abuses until Rama kills him in battle.
Rati
(“pleasure,” particularly sexual pleasure)
The wife of Kama, god of love. Rati is
both Kama’s wife and his ally, reflecting
the way that sexual pleasure can both
accompany and amplify desire.
Ratri
Name of the goddess of Night. See Night,
goddess of.
Ravana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Ravana is the ten-
headed demon king of Lanka. To destroy
Ravana, the god Vishnu is born in his
incarnation as Rama. Ravana is a reincar-
nation of Vishnu’s gatekeeper Jaya, who
has been cursed by a sage to be reborn
three times as a demon and to be killed
by Vishnu each time. As a rakshasa, a
type of demon, Ravana possesses enor-
mous physical strength and various
magic powers. He augments these natur-
al abilities by performing intense physi-
cal asceticism (tapas), which in Indian
[[568]]

culture is widely believed to generate
spiritual power and bring boons from the
gods. When the god Brahma finally
appears and directs Ravana to choose his
boon, Ravana requests that he be able to
be killed by no one but a human being.
This seems to make him practically
immortal, since his powers are such that
no ordinary human will be able to harm
him, much less kill him. Ravana then pro-
ceeds to terrorize the gods, secure in the
knowledge that they will not be able to
harm him. He begins with his half-broth-
er, the minor deity Kubera, who loses his
home and all his possessions to Ravana.
Ravana’s virtual invulnerability goes
to his head, and the powerful demon
begins to disregard all rules of decency
and morality. He is particularly guilty of
molesting and abducting women, acts
which result in various curses being laid
upon him by his helpless victims, many
of them predicting his death. As a result
of one of these curses his sister
Shurpanakha is mutilated by Rama’s
brother Lakshmana. Ravana is deter-
mined to avenge this insult, and decides
that the best way will be to abductRavidas Jayanti
Rama’s wife Sita. Although his wife
Mandodari and his brothers rebuke him
for this act and advise him to return Sita
and make peace with Rama, Ravana
stubbornly refuses to listen. His inflated
pride and desire to avenge the insult to
his sister deafen his ears to their good
counsel, and he eventually pays for his
stubbornness with his life when Rama
kills him in battle.
As with all demons, Ravana is not
completely villainous by nature but
rather greatly powerful and greatly
flawed at the same time. According to
some stories he is a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, and the hymn to the
dancing
Shiva
known
as
the
Shivatandava Stotra is often attributed
to Ravana.Given his low social status, Ravidas
was almost certainly illiterate. His poet-
ic songs were likely first transmitted
orally, though their personal appeal
made him one of the most popular sant
poets. The two oldest attested sources
of his work are the Adigranth, the scrip-
ture for the Sikh community, and the
Panchvani collections, compiled by the
Dadupanth. In modern India, Ravidas
has also served as a model for the
depressed classes; his followers call
themselves Ravidasis. For further
information see John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer, Songs of
the Saints of India, 1988; and
Winand M. Callewaert and Peter
Freidlander (trans.), The Life and Works
of Raidas, 1992.
RavidasRavidasi
(ca. 1500) Sant poet-saint who lived his
life in the city of Benares and is tradi-
tionally believed to have been a younger
contemporary of the poet-saint Kabir.
The Sants were a loose group of central
and northern Indian poet-saints who
shared several general tendencies: stress
on individualized, interior religion lead-
ing to a personal experience of the
divine; disdain for external ritual, partic-
ularly image worship; faith in the power
of the divine Name; and a tendency to
ignore conventional caste distinctions.
Both tradition and references in his
poetry describe Ravidas as a leather
worker (chamar), a social group whose
contact with dead animals and their
skins rendered them untouchable. He is
believed to have supported himself by
his hereditary trade, and much of his
poetry speaks on issues of worldly birth
and status. He never denied the impor-
tance of heredity but ultimately felt that
his devotion to God had helped him to
transcend his birth and given him status
based on different criteria. His poetry
reflects this staunch personal faith, as
do his frequent warnings to his listeners
that life is short and difficult, and that
they should pay great attention to reli-
gious practice.Name taken by followers of the
untouchable poet-saint Ravidas. The
Ravidasis emphasize many ideas found
in the poetry of Ravidas, such as the
irrelevancy of ideas of purity and impu-
rity (ashaucha), the futility of trying to
contain the divine in texts and rites, and
his vision of a society in which all people
can have equal status, whatever their
background. It is unlikely that the
Ravidasis were established by Ravidas
himself, nor is Ravidas an object of wor-
ship for them, although he is held as a
model for religious equality, based on
the messages in his poetry. In modern
times the Ravidasis have focused on
opposing all sorts of caste-based
discrimination and have also taken
up the empowerment of various low-
caste groups. This movement is very
recent, and to date little has been
published about it; for some informa-
tion see the introduction to Ravidas in
John Stratton Hawley and Mark
Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs of the
Saints of India, 1988.
Ravidas Jayanti
Festival falling on the full moon
in the lunar month of Magh (January–
[[569]]
Rawal
February), celebrated as the birthday of
the medieval bhakti poet-saint Ravidas,
born near Benares. Ravidas’s birth into
the untouchable caste of leather work-
ers (chamar) afforded him a very low
social status. His poetry is set in a per-
sonal voice and contrasts this lowly sta-
tus with the honor and renown he
gained through his devotion to God. In
modern times many members of the
depressed classes see Ravidas as a
model, and his birthday is celebrated
with great fervor.
Rawal
Title given to the head priest (pujari) at
the temple of Badrinath in the
Himalayas. The Rawal is invariably a
Nambudiri brahmin, who must remain
unmarried to retain his position.
In Hindu belief, Badrinath is one of
the four dhams (“divine abodes”)
connected with the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Seeking to combat the
spread of Buddhism and revitalize
Hindu religion, Shankaracharya report-
edly chose one Hindu sacred center in
each corner of the subcontinent, and at
each established a Dashanami Sanyasi
monastic center (math) to train learned
monks. Badrinath is associated with
the Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath, forty miles south,
which is also the place where the deity
Badrinath is symbolically transported
for the winter.
According to Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years the
position of head priest was filled by
Dandi Sanyasis, who were also
Nambudiri brahmins, the same caste
into which Shankaracharya is supposed
to have been born. When the last of
these died without a successor in 1776,
the local king who served as the protec-
tor of the shrine invited a non-ascetic
Nambudiri brahmin to serve as the tem-
ple’s priest. This priest was given the title
rawal (from the word raja, “deputy”),
and his extended family has run the
shrine since then. The rawal was the
only person allowed to touch the image
[[570]]

of Badrinath, and was responsible for
performing worship during the six
months that the temple is open.
Because of these duties, the rawal was
required to remain a bachelor, lest the
ritual impurity arising from the birth of
a child (sutakashaucha) render him
unable to attend to his duties. Until the
Badrinath Temple Act of 1939 estab-
lished a temple board as the ultimate
authority, the rawals had sole rights to
the offerings given at the shrine.
Rawat
A particular subgroup of the warrior
princes known as the Rajputs; the
Rawats’ major area of influence was in
southwestern Uttar Pradesh state.
Reciprocal Dependence
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to
be avoided in constructing an argu-
ment. Reciprocal dependence occurs
when two things each stand as cause
and effect to the other—when A depends
on B, and B in turn depends on A. This
is seen as an extended case of self-
residence, and equally objectionable.
Reconversion
General name for the rites by which
people who have converted to other reli-
gious traditions are accepted back as
Hindus. See shuddhi.
Reflectionism
Theory used in later schools of Advaita
Vedanta to explain how one single pri-
mal ignorance could afflict multiple
ignorant selves. Reflectionism is rooted
in the idea of an image appearing in a
mirror; different from the original, it is
nonetheless based on it. In the same
way, according to this explanation, the
ignorance affecting each individual is
simply a reflection of a primal igno-
rance. For further information see Karl
H. Potter, Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.Reservations
Reincarnation
One of the fundamental assumptions of
Indian religious life. See samsara

Religious Persecution
In popular belief India is visualized as a
land of perfect religious tolerance in
which all schools of thought have been
allowed to grow unchecked. Although
true in its basic form, this picture is
greatly simplified. There is a long history
of competition between differing reli-
gious communities and schools of
thought, sometimes fueled by scathing
polemics designed to persuade listeners
that one was correct and the others
false. What has been quite rare, however,
are acts of violence accompanying these
arguments, or the notion that people
should have to fear for their lives
because of their ideas. In the literature
of the Nayanar and Lingayat communi-
ties—both devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva—language toward the Jains has a
genuinely hostile edge, and the Nayanar
leader Sambandar has been persistently
implicated in the impalement of 8,000
Jains in the southern Indian city of
Madurai. In the same way, the northern
Indian king Sashanka, who was also a
devotee of Shiva, harbored a pathologi-
cal hatred of Buddhists. Sashanka
reportedly not only persecuted
Buddhists themselves, but also tried
to destroy the tree in Bodh Gaya
under which the Buddha purportedly
gained enlightenment.
Sectarian competition aside, people
whose religious faith has led them to
ignore generally accepted social con-
ventions have been quite likely to
encounter stiff opposition. Stories of the
devotional (bhakti) poet-saints are
replete with tales of the troubles they
faced from guardians of conventional
morality, usually said to be brahmins. In
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
there was a running and often bloody
conflict between two groups of militant
ascetics—the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, and the Bairagi
Nagas—although in that case the
motives might just as well have been
economic, namely, the control of trade
in the Ganges valley. A final example of
religious persecution appears in the rise
of Hindutva in the 1980s. Propelled by
verbal attacks on Muslims and
Christians, this persecution has all too
often prompted physical violence.
Renuka
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the sage
Jamadagni and mother of the Para-
shuram avatar, the fifth avatar or incar-
nation of the god Vishnu.
Republic Day
Indian national holiday, falling on
January 26, that marks the day the
Indian constitution was adopted in
[[1950]]
. As a holiday connected with
Indian independence, it is one of the few
celebrated according to the common
calendar. Republic Day is comparable
to the Fourth of July in the United States
and is celebrated with massive parades
in India’s major cities. The largest occurs
in New Delhi—from which it is televised
to the rest of the nation—and includes
singers and performers from all over the
country, as well as large displays of mili-
tary hardware, including fly-overs by the
newest jet planes.
Reservations
Modern government policy designed to
rectify the long-standing economic and
social disadvantages faced by certain
poor or low-status groups by offering
them preferential treatment in employ-
ment and education. This is usually
done by setting aside, or “reserving,” for
such groups certain percentages of
[[571]]
Rg Veda
government jobs or places in institu-
tions of higher learning, which admit
people from disadvantaged communi-
ties under much lower standards than
those for the general public. Those
groups who qualify for such reservations
are generally referred to as Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, after the
“schedule” or official government list on
which the names of these groups
appear. The Scheduled Castes are low-
status caste Hindus, who in earlier times
would have been called untouchables,
while the Scheduled Tribes are aborigi-
nal peoples (adivasis), who mainly live
in central India.
Although the reservations policy has
been implemented for some time, it
remains a continual source of contro-
versy. Proponents claim that it is moving
socially disadvantaged people into
the mainstream of Indian life and help-
ing to correct centuries of injustice.
Opponents decry the fact that less-
qualified people are being deliberately
chosen, making a mockery of the notion
of merit. Critics also argue that the peo-
ple who benefit the most from such poli-
cies are the best-off members of such
communities—the so-called creamy
layer, designating their position at the
top—whereas the truly disadvantaged
remain in the same positions as they
have always been. Aside from the philo-
sophical debates about this policy, it has
had a recognizable impact on people’s
livelihoods. Such reservations have
made competition even more ferocious
for the remaining spots, and made
reservations a politically volatile issue.
Given the benefits derived from reserva-
tions, there has also been considerable
lobbying to include other, less-disad-
vantaged groups under its rubric, as a
way to spread benefits to other sectors
of Indian society.
Rg Veda
The oldest and most important of the
four Vedas, which are themselves the
most ancient and authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The Rg Veda is a group of
[[572]]

[[1]]
,028 hymns collected in ten books.
Judging by their content, the hymns
were clearly composed over a long period
of time, but the actual dates are the sub-
ject of sharp disagreement. Traditional
Hindus assert that the Vedas were not
composed either by God or by human
beings but, rather, simply heard by
ancient sages through their advanced
powers of perception, and then trans-
mitted orally from generation to gener-
ation. Because of their origin, the Vedas
thus belong to the class of religious texts
known as shruti (“heard”). Scholarly
consensus maintains that the Vedas
were begun in the earlier part of the
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps
[[1800]]
–1500 B.C.E., and were finished
somewhere around the end of the
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps
[[1200]]
–900. All these dates are highly
speculative, since the hymns themselves
have no internal evidence to allow pre-
cise dating, which has instead been
based primarily on a comparative study
of changes in the language of certain
Vedas. Some of the hymns, for example,
are thought to have been created rela-
tively later than others, both because
their language is less archaic and closer
to classical Sanskrit and because the
locations mentioned in them reflect a
broader geographical area.
Most of the hymns in the Rg Veda are
addressed to a particular deity. The pri-
mary deities are Indra, Agni, and Soma,
although Varuna is prominent in the
earliest hymns. It is generally accepted
that the hymns were chanted at sacri-
fices as a way to invoke these deities.
Evidence from the hymns themselves
describes these sacrifices as large public
rites, usually involving the slaughter of
animals, which were burned on a sacri-
ficial fire, and the preparation and con-
sumption of the mysterious beverage
soma. In this context, the Vedic hymns
reflect a body of sacred learning known
to only a small group of religious spe-
cialists. Accordingly, these hymns were
never meant for universal public dis-
semination, since all except twice-born
men were forbidden to hear them.Rishikesh
The Rg Veda’s tenth and final book
differs sharply from the preceding ones.
Its language is closer to classical
Sanskrit, and its content is far more
speculative than that of the earlier
books, hinting at a major conceptual
shift. This book features the famous
Creation Hymn (10.129), in which the
poet speculates on how the world came
to be, only to conclude that the answer
may be unknown even to the creator.
Another notable hymn in this book is
the Purusha Sukta (10.90), which
describes both the earth and human
society as the product of a primeval sac-
rifice. The former hymn foreshadows
the religious and cosmological specula-
tion found in the texts known as the
Upanishads. The latter, which contains
the first known articulation of the four
major social groups (varnas), along with
their symbolic functions, is distin-
guished as foreshadowing the later
dharma literature.
Rhythm, in Music
See tala.
Right Hand Tantra
Name for a type of tantra, a secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice. Certain
tantric rituals make use of substances
that are normally forbidden, such as
liquor and nonvegetarian food, in an
effort to unify the world by destroying all
conceptual dualities, including that
between sacred and forbidden. These
substances are used in their actual
forms in “left hand” (vamachara) tantric
ritual, and by substitution in “right
hand” (dakshinachara) tantric ritual.
See dakshinachara.
Rishabha
According to Jain tradition, Rishabha
was the founder of the Jains. He is con-
sidered the first of the Jain tirthankaras,
the founding figures in the Jain reli-
gious tradition. He is one of three Jain
tirthankaras who are mentioned in
the Yajur Veda, one of the earliest

Hindu religious texts. The figure most
often credited with developing the
teachings used by the Jains today is
Mahavira, who is considered the twenty-
fourth tirthankara.
Rishi
Common word to designate a sage, seer,
or inspired religious leader. It is most
often used to indicate religious figures of
the distant past, and is not usually
applied to contemporary figures.
Rishikesh
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayan foothills of the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Rishikesh lies about fifteen
miles up the Ganges River from the
sacred city of Haridwar. As with many
sites on the Ganges, Rishikesh is famous
primarily as a bathing (snana) place,
although it is also noted as a dwelling-
place for ascetics, particularly at the
ashrams in the area around Lakshman
Jhula. As a sacred site, Rishikesh is also
notable for having no single charter
myth. According to one story, this is the
place where the god Rama kills several
demons, enabling the sages to carry out
[[573]]
Rishi Panchami
their sacrifices undisturbed. Another
story names this as the place where
Rama does penance (prayashchitta) for
killing the demon-king Ravana. A third
story names Rishikesh as the site where
a sage named Raibhya receives a vision
of the god Vishnu. The most famous
temple in Rishikesh is named after
Rama’s brother Bharata.
Rishi Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day
(panchami) of the light (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). This festival is
dedicated to the Seven Sages (rishi)
born of Brahma: Bhrgu, Pulastya,
Kratu, Pulaha, Marichi, Atri, and
Vasishtha. Worshiping these seven sages
on this day is said to bring prosperity
and happiness.
Rishyashringa
A sage in the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two great Indian epics. King
Dasharatha commissions Rishyashringa
to perform a great sacrifice, to enable
the king’s wives to conceive. At the con-
clusion of Rishyashringa’s sacrifice, a
shining figure emerges from the sacrifi-
cial fire, places a pot of milk-rice before
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to
his wives. Dasharatha divides the con-
tents among his wives Kausalya,
Kaikeyi, and Sumitra, and in due time
they all bear sons. Kausalya is the moth-
er of Rama, the Ramayana’s protagonist.
Kaikeyi is the mother of Bharata, and
Sumitra is the mother of Lakshmana
and Shatrughna.
Rites of Passage
General term for rites that recognize and
mark transitions in an individual life-
cycle, and that often signify a change of
state or status. See samskara.
Rites of Protection
For many Hindus, the world is a ritually
dangerous place. Certain hours, days,
[[574]]

and periods of the year are considered
inauspicious. At these times the very
tone of the cosmos is disagreeable and
all sorts of bad fortune can befall the
ignorant or the unwary. Rites of protec-
tion are used to counter these dangers,
as well as the problems of one’s past
karma, which can be diagnosed through
an inauspicious conjunction in one’s
birth horoscope (natal horoscope).
Some inauspicious times are unlucky
only for certain types of activities.
Potential misfortune can be avoided
simply by refraining from these activi-
ties. However, certain events that cannot
be avoided, such as eclipses, are also
believed inauspicious. In such cases,
one can prevent the negative effects of
inauspiciousness by transferring it to
another person, usually through the
medium of gifts (dana); giving gifts is
also the preferred means for getting rid
of inauspiciousness stemming from a
bad conjunction in one’s birth horo-
scope. People also safeguard themselves
by performing prayer and worship as
positive protective forces.
Inauspicious forces are also generat-
ed by human jealousy, greed, and
hatred, which can find their agency in
black magic, the evil eye (nazar), or
other sorts of witchcraft. Finally, some
Hindus believe there are a host of non-
human beings, such as spirits, ghosts,
and witches, who sometimes seek to
harm human beings through the exer-
cise of supernormal powers. Despite the
power and prevalence of all of these
malevolent forces, if one is aware and
careful of them there are ways to
counter them.
For problems stemming from human
malice, there are well-established solu-
tions. One is to avoid those people who
are considered inauspicious, such as
widows. Another strategy is to avoid
inciting people’s jealousy by never pro-
claiming one’s good fortune too openly,
praising a child too lavishly, or flaunting
one’s wealth too freely. In many cases,
people will counter potentially vulnera-
ble moments in the life cycle by various
protective rites. It is still common forRoy, Ram Mohan
people to wear talismans or amulets,
which are believed to protect the wearer.
Another common protective measure is
to carry iron, which is believed to render
the person carrying it impervious to
witchcraft. Young children will often
have a black smudge of lamp-black put
on their faces, to symbolically disfigure
them and take away the motive for jealousy.
Another protective strategy is to hang up
an object (such as a clay pot with a
painted face) intended to absorb all the
bad feelings, which is then discarded.

Daksha lays a curse on the Moon to lose
his luster. The curse is later modified so
that the moon will alternately wane and
wax, but that its disappearance will
never be final.
Rohini
(2) In Hindu mythology, birth mother of
Balarama, the god Krishna’s brother.
Balarama’s birth is unusual. After his
conception the fetus is magically trans-
ported from the womb of Devaki to that
of Rohini. This is done to protect him
from harm, as Devaki’s wicked uncle
Kamsa has already killed her first seven
children and will certainly do the same
to Balarama if she carries him to term.
Roy, Ram Mohan
Rock Edicts
Name for a set of inscriptions commis-
sioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka
(r. 269–32 B.C.E.). The inscriptions were
official pronouncements on royal policy,
and advice and instructions to his sub-
jects on a variety of topics, including
religious tolerance. In general, the rock
edicts were carved into large boulders or
rock faces in places that would have
been at the borders of the Mauryan
Empire, thus symbolically defining its
boundaries. The text was fairly consis-
tent throughout the empire, even
though different examples of these
edicts were found in widely separated
places. The other major class of Ashokan
inscriptions, the pillar edicts, were
inscribed on pillars of polished Chunar
sandstone and set up on the major
roads running through the empire,
where they would have been visible to
passersby. See also Maurya dynasty.
Rohini
In Hindu mythology, a daughter of the
demigod Daksha who, along with her
twenty-six sisters, is married to the
Moon. The Moon favors Rohini over all
her sisters, despite Daksha’s entreaties
to give them all equal time. In the end
(1774–1833) First major Indian propo-
nent of Hindu social and religious
reform, who founded the organization
Brahmo Samaj for this purpose. He
came from a wealthy Bengali family and
was a successful businessman and civil
servant. He moved to Calcutta in 1815,
at the time when the British were first
beginning to take serious notice of tradi-
tional Indian society, especially the
aspects they considered “evil.” Roy’s
reformist interests largely meshed with
that of the British. From an early age Roy
had rejected the practice of using images
in worship, perhaps through exposure
to Sufi ideas, and his first public crusade
was against such worship of gods and
goddesses. Like most Indian reformers,
Roy used Sanskrit texts selectively, and
for him the most important ones were
the speculative Upanishads, which
(under the influence of the English
Unitarians) he translated to reflect a
monotheism (belief in the existence of
only one God). In his later years he pro-
moted many different educational and
social works, but is especially known for
his opposition to sati, the custom of
burning a widow on her husband’s
funeral pyre. Although later seen as too
heavily influenced by the British, his
reinterpretation of the past provided a
[[575]]
Rta
model for others to use. For further con-
sideration see Robert D. Baird (ed.),
Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Rta
In the Vedas (the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu texts) rta is the cos-
mic order and regularity that allows the
rhythms of time and the seasons to
occur in orderly succession. According
to the texts, rta also had a moral dimen-
sion, which human beings had an oblig-
ation to support. One such moral
dimension was truth, which was seen
as upholding the cosmos, whereas its
opposite, anrta, came to signify false-
hood. The connection between natural
and moral world came through the
Vedic god Varuna, who was both
the guardian of rta and the deity who
punished untruth, usually by affliction
with dropsy.
Rtvij
In the Hindu sacred texts (Vedas), one
of the priests who officiated at sacri-
fices. The four chief priests at sacrifices
were the hotr, udgatr, adhvaryum,
and brahman.
Rudra
(“howler”) Fearsome deity who first
appears late in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, later identified
with the god Shiva. Several hymns in the
Rg Veda are dedicated to Rudra, where
he is identified with the storm-god
Indra, and the fire-god Agni. A more
developed picture of Rudra appears in
the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, one of
the later speculative texts known as the
Upanishads. In the third chapter
(adhyaya) of this text, Rudra is identified
as the ruling power in the universe and
the source and origin of the gods them-
selves. Rudra’s depiction in this upan-
ishad shows considerable ambivalence,
both mentioning the destructive arrows
that he bears and imploring him to
appear in a form that is auspicious
(shivam) and peaceful. This ambivalence
[[576]]

perhaps reflects the religious tension
associated with the figure of Shiva, who
was a deity outside the Vedic sacrificial
cult but was gradually absorbed into
established religion and is now one of
the primary Hindu deities.
Rudraksha
(“eye of Rudra”) The dried seed of the
tree Elaeocarpus ganitrus, which is con-
sidered sacred to the god Shiva.
Rudrakshas are often strung into gar-
lands and worn by Shiva’s devotees
(bhakta). The seed itself is round with a
knobby, pitted surface, with a natural
channel in the middle through which a
thread can easily be drawn. Each seed
also has natural longitudinal lines run-
ning from top to bottom, which divide
the seed into units known as “faces”
(mukhi). The most common rudrakshas
have five faces, but they can have up to
fourteen. Each differing number of faces
has been given a symbolic association
with a particular deity. The rarest form
is the ekmukhi rudraksha, which has no
faces at all and is considered to be a
manifestation of Shiva himself. This
rudraksha is so valuable that street sell-
ers routinely make counterfeit versions
by carving them out of wood. Another
rare form is the Gauri-Shankar, in
which two rudraksha seeds are longitu-
dinally joined; this is considered a
manifestation of Shiva and Shakti.
Aside from the number of “faces,” the
quality of rudrakshas is judged by their
color and size. The color runs from
reddish brown to a light brown, with the
former considered more desirable, while
the smaller sizes are preferable to the
larger ones.
Rudranath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas in the
valley between the Mandakini and the
Alakananda rivers, about thirty miles from
the district headquarters at Chamoli. The
temple’s presiding deity is the god Shiva in
his manifestation as “Lord Rudra.”Rukmini
Rudranath is one of the Panchkedar, a
network of five sacred sites spread
throughout the Garhwal region; the other
four sites are Kedarnath, Kalpeshvar,
Tungnath, and Madmaheshvar. This net-
work of five sites is seen as a symbolic rep-
resentation of Shiva’s body, since Shiva is
believed to dwell in the Himalayas.
Rudranath is believed to be Shiva’s face.
Rudraprayag
Himalayan town and sacred site (tirtha)
at the junction of the Mandakini and
Alakananda rivers, two Himalayan tribu-
taries of the Ganges River. As with all the
other river junctions in the Garhwal
region, Rudraprayag is considered an
especially holy place for bathing (snana),
although the raging currents make it
dangerous. Above the junction of the
rivers is a temple to Shiva in his form as
Rudra. According to local tradition, this
marked the place where the sage Narada
performed physical asceticism (tapas) to
gain his skill as a bard. Shiva, pleased
with Narada’s efforts, instructed Narada
in music and remained at the spot.
Rudra Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday) of
the Bairagi Naga ascetics. The name
Bairagi denotes ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. The name
Naga describes a class of fighting ascetics
recruited to protect the other Bairagi
ascetics who, because they were saintly,
scholarly men, could not protect them-
selves. Bairagi Nagas were organized in
military fashion into different anis or
“armies.” Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century the Nagas’ primary occu-
pation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests. The Nagas lent money at
interest, engaged in trade, and often
owned large amounts of property. They
were particularly powerful in parts of the
country where the centralized govern-
ment had broken down. Their roles as
mercenaries and in trade have both large-
ly disappeared in contemporary times.
Rudraksha seed. Devotees of the god Shiva
often identify themselves by wearing
necklaces made of these seeds.
The Rudra Sampraday traces its spir-
itual lineage through the philosopher
Vallabhacharya and the earlier religious
teacher, Vishnuswami. The followers of
Vallabhacharya tend to be householders
rather than ascetics; Vallabhacharya
himself was married and had many chil-
dren. It is the smallest and least impor-
tant of the Bairagi Naga sampradays,
and the only event at which it figures is
the bathing (snana) processions at the
Kumbha Mela.
Rukmini
In Hindu mythology, the chief queen of
the god Krishna in his later life as the
king of the city of Dwaraka. Rukmini is
the daughter of the king of Vidarbha,
and although both she and her parents
favor her marriage to Krishna, her
brother, who is Krishna’s bitter enemy,
makes arrangements to marry her to his
friend Shishupala. On her wedding day,
with all the guests assembled, Krishna
carries Rukmini off in his chariot. They are
married, and, according to tradition,
have ten sons.
[[577]]
Sabarmati
## S
Sacred Ash
Substance used in rituals and by devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva to mark
their bodies, in imitation of their patron
deity. The name given to this ash is vib-
huti. See vibhuti.
Sacred Sites
Sabarmati
Northern Indian river that rises in the
Aravalli Hills in the state of Rajasthan,
and flows south to the Gulf of Cambay in
the state of Gujarat. It is best known as
the site of the Sabarmati Ashram, across
the river from the city of Ahmedabad in
Gujarat. The Sabarmati Ashram was
home to Mohandas K. Gandhi for six-
teen years after he returned from South
Africa in 1915. He organized much of
the struggle for Indian independence
from this ashram.
Sacchidananda
Sanskrit compound word denoting the
three generally accepted attributes of
the supreme Brahman (the Ultimate
Reality of the universe according to
some Hindu traditions): being (sat),
consciousness (chit), and bliss (ananda).
The differences between the form of the
individual words and their form in the
compound are the result of sandhi or
euphonic combination.
In certain Hindu philosophical tradi-
tions, but particularly in the Advaita
Vedanta school, the supreme Brahman
is considered the Ultimate Reality
behind all things. Although Brahman is
considered to be without particular
qualities, these three attributes are
believed to be inseparable from its very
nature. It has the attribute of being,
because it is the reality from which all
other “being” comes. In the same way, it
is consciousness, as the source of all
conscious thought. Finally, bliss pro-
ceeds from its perfection, which is ulti-
mate and complete.
[[578]]

Hindu religious life is intimately con-
nected to the land of India itself, which
is studded with sacred sites, known as
tirthas. These can be lakes, rivers,
mountains, or any other natural feature;
they can also be cities, temples, or any
other created environment; they can
even be the presence of holy men and
women. Pilgrimage (tirthayatra) to any
sacred site is a means of spiritual and
religious advancement. See tirtha.
Sacred Thread
A circular cord made of three strands (in
which each strand itself has three
strands), which is worn over the left
shoulder, crossing the body to fall on the
right hip. The sacred thread is given to a
boy as part of the upanayana samskara,
which is the adolescent religious initia-
tion also known as the “second birth.”
Second birth entitles a boy to study the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
In the dharma literature this initiatory
rite is prescribed for all young men
belonging to the three “twice-born”
social groups (varnas)—that is, the
brahmins, kshatriyas, and vaishyas.
The sacred thread would have been the
most visible sign of a twice-born man,
for whom wearing the thread was
mandatory, since any religious acts per-
formed without wearing it were said to
be ineffective.
In modern times its presence gener-
ally means that the wearer is a brahmin,
since it is mainly the brahmins who
carry out this rite today. The sacred
thread is worn for extended periods of
time, although it must be changed at
certain times: after the wearer has suf-
fered violent impurity (ashaucha), such
as that of death; after performing anySadashiva
rite of expiation (prayashchitta); and
after eclipses or other highly inauspi-
cious times. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane, A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The
former is encyclopedic and the latter
more accessible; despite their age, they
remain the best sources on traditional
Hindu rites.
Sacrifice
Generally a rite involving a sacred fire
and, often, an offering in that fire. This
sort of ritual is rooted in the oldest part
of the Hindu tradition, although it has
undergone some profound changes,
particularly in the decline of animal sac-
rifice. This sort of sacrificial rite is
known as a yajna.
Sadachara
(“practice of good [people]”) One of the
traditional sources for determining reli-
gious duty (dharma) for matters not
treated in the dharma literature, or for
cases in which the literature itself gave
conflicting opinions. This was the least
authoritative source of dharma, after the
Vedas (the oldest Hindu scriptures) and
the dharma literature. Sadachara recog-
nizes that life has many ambiguities and
uncertainties, and at the same time pro-
vides a resource for determining the
appropriate action, by taking as a model
the practice of established and upright
people. Another term to designate this
sort of authority was shishtachara, the
“practice of learned [people].”
Sadasatkhyati
(“discrimination of the unreal as the
real”) Theory of error propounded by
the Samkhya philosophical school. All
theories of error attempt to explain why
people make errors in judgment, the
stock example being of mistaking the
silvery flash of a sea shell for a piece of
silver. The Samkhya theory of error is
based on dualistic metaphysics, in
which the fundamental error comes in
confusing purusha and prakrti—
roughly, spirit and nature—which are
the sources of all things. These are the
two Samkhya first principles—purusha
as conscious witness, and prakrti as
insentient matter—which are always
separate from each other, and whose
attributes can never coincide. For the
Samkhyas, the fundamental error is to
confuse these two completely different
principles—that is, to attribute powers
of motion and development to purusha,
and consciousness to prakrti. Purusha is
conceived as conscious, but completely
inactive and unchanging. It is the pas-
sive witness to the myriad transforma-
tions of prakrti going on around it.
This initial misidentification causes
the evolution of the entire world, both
the interior, subjective world and the
exterior world the subject perceives.
Against this background, confusing the
shell for silver is just an extension of this
original mistake and is rooted in it.
According to the Samkhyas, perfect
knowledge would protect one from all
sorts of errors, both cosmic and mun-
dane. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Sadashiva
In certain schools of tantra practice,
particularly in the Trika school of
Kashmiri Shaivism, the name for the
first step in the evolution of the cos-
mos. According to the Trika school, the
Ultimate Reality, conceived as Shiva, is
utterly nondual, and thus neither mas-
culine nor feminine. The first step in
cosmological evolution comes when
the divine consciousness becomes
conscious of itself through the reflec-
tion (vimarsha) of its original illumi-
nation (prakasha). Moved by this self-
consciousness, the unqualified divine
being transforms itself into a divine
being containing a masculine and femi-
nine nature, the first of many such bipolar
dyads from which the universe is born.
The masculine part of this first dyad is
Sadashiva, which is considered the
[[579]]
Sadhana

material cause of the universe. The
energy for creation comes from the
creative and dynamic power of the
dyad’s female principle, Shakti. For fur-
ther information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Sadhana
(“accomplishing”) The most common
colloquial Hindu term designating
established and regular religious prac-
tice. It is given this name because it
is through such practice that one
gains spiritual attainments. In modern
Hindi, the word can also be used to
refer to anything to which one has
devoted a great deal of time, attention,
and hard work.
[[580]]

is to fulfill one’s own dharma (svadharma),
which may supersede or even contradict
the requirements of the common dhar-
ma. For instance, it is generally accepted
that a king must occasionally disregard
truth to be an effective ruler. Since a
king’s primary duty is to maintain peace
and order in the country, so that other
people have the opportunity to do their
duties, he is required to do whatever it
takes to accomplish this.
Sadhu
(“virtuous man”) A general term that can
be used for any ascetic, although it more
often refers to an ascetic who has not
undergone formal initiation into an
established ascetic order.
Sadharana (“common”) DharmaSadhubela
In the dharma literature, the religious
duties required of all human beings,
including truth, generosity, and compas-
sion. One’s essential obligation, however,In the time before the partition of
India in 1947, Sadhubela was the name
of the most important ascetic center
for the Udasi ascetics; it was in SukkurSagara Dashanami
in the province of Sindh province, now
in Pakistan.
Sadhya
(“to be proved”) Element in the accept-
ed form of an inference (anumana) in
Indian philosophy. An acceptable infer-
ence has three terms: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three has
its own constituent parts. The sadhya is,
along with the paksha, one of the two
parts of the assertion. The paksha is the
subject of the hypothesis and names a
class of things, while the sadhya con-
tains the claim to be proven about that
class. In the standard example, in which
the hypothesis is “this mountain is on
fire,” the paksha is “this mountain” (the
class of things about which a claim is
being made); and the sadhya, or thing to
be proven, is “is on fire.”
Safai
Small cloth wrapped around the base of
a chillum, a clay cylinder used for smok-
ing a mixture of tobacco and hashish
(charas). The safai serves two purposes,
one ritual and one physical. On one
hand, it forms a barrier intended to pre-
vent passing the ritual impurity
(ashaucha) carried by saliva when the
chillum is being passed from person to
person. Ascetics who are very conscious
of purity or status will often wrap their
own safai around the base of the chillum
before smoking. Aside from helping to
protect personal purity, the safai also
serves a practical purpose–it is usually
dipped in water before being wrapped
around the chillum, which serves to cool
and mellow the smoke being drawn
through it.
Sagar
In Hindu mythology, a celebrated king
of the Solar Line. Sagar, the son of King
Subahu and his wife Yadavi, gets his
name because one of Yadavi’s co-wives
has given her poison (gara) while she is
pregnant with him. Sagar has a very
hard early life. His father is driven from
his kingdom even before he is born, and
Sagar is raised at the ashram of the sage
Aurva, where his mother has taken asy-
lum. When he comes to maturity Sagar
embarks on a series of military cam-
paigns in which he wins back all the
lands his father lost, and becomes a
righteous and religious king whose only
concern is his lack of progeny.
To beget sons, Sagar calls on the sage
Bhrgu, who gives Sagar’s two wives a
choice: one wife will bear 60,000 sons
who will all die childless, and one wife
will bear one son who will carry on the
line. Each of his wives chooses, and in
due course both have their children—
Keshini delivers her one son in the nor-
mal way, whereas Sumati delivers a
lump of flesh that is divided and put into
[[60]]
,000 pots, each of which develops into
a handsome son.
In his prosperity King Sagar contin-
ues to sponsor religious rites, and is on
the verge of completing his hundredth
horse sacrifice (asvamedha), which will
entitle him to the throne of Indra, the
god who is the king of heaven. To fore-
stall this, Indra steals the sacred horse
and hides it in the ashram of the sage
Kapila. Sagar sends his 60,000 sons
to search for the horse, but they make
the mistake of insulting the sage, who
burns them all to ash through his
yogic powers. To rescue their souls it
is necessary to bring down the Ganges
from heaven, a job that Sagar’s descen-
dants diligently attempt to complete.
After several generations of frustration,
his great-great-grandson Bhagirath is
finally successful.
Sagara Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva.
The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century philo-
sopher Shankaracharya in an effort
create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
[[581]]
Saguna
different name—in this case, sagara
(“ocean”). Upon initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in
one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Sagara
Dashanamis belong to the Anandawara
group, which is affiliated with the Jyotir
math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath.
Saguna
(“with qualities”) Anything having dis-
tinguishing qualities. In the context of
ideas about divinity it refers to particu-
lar deities with particular attributes. In
the religious traditions based on the
ideas of the Upanishads, the speculative
texts that are the final texts in the Vedas,
any manifestation of a deity with quali-
ties is seen as ultimately inferior to the
unqualified (nirguna) Brahman. This
assumption is adamantly opposed by
certain theistic traditions, such as the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
which insists that the highest deity, in
this case Krishna, has a particular form
(and thus certain qualities).
Sahadeva
Fifth of the five Pandava brothers who
are the protagonists in the great Hindu
epic, the Mahabharata. Sahadeva’s
mother is Madri, who is the junior wife
of King Pandu. None of the Pandava
brothers are actually Pandu’s sons,
since he has been cursed to die the
moment he holds his wife in an
amorous embrace. Madri conceives her
sons magically, using a mantra given to
her co-wife, Kunti, by the sage
Durvasas. The mantra gives the woman
who recites it the power to call down
any of the gods and to have by him a son
[[582]]

equal in power to the god. With Pandu’s
blessing Kunti teaches the mantra to
Madri, who meditates on the Ashvins,
the divine twins who are the physicians
of the gods, and thus bears the twins
Nakula and Sahadeva. As the sons of the
physicians of the gods, both are skilled
healers of animals and human beings.
Although they are among the five
Pandava brothers, they are less impor-
tant to the Mahabharata than their
three elder siblings.
Sahajiya
Religious community originating in
medieval Bengal. The Sahajiyas synthe-
size devotional practices to the god
Vishnu and the ritual practices of the
secret tradition known as tantra, partic-
ularly the extreme practices associated
with the “left-hand” (vamachara) tradi-
tion of tantra. The name sahajiya comes
from the word sahaja (“natural” or
“spontaneous”), indicating the group’s
belief that one’s natural passions, quali-
ties, and tendencies should not be sup-
pressed but should be channeled to help
one gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Over this foundation of
tantric ritual practice was added the
devotion to the god Krishna and his
consort Radha, a devotional thrust
strongly influenced by the Gaudiya
Vaishnava religious community, founded
by the Bengali saint Chaitanya. For fur-
ther information see Shashibhushan B.
Dasgupta, Obscure Religious Cults, 1962;
and Edward C. Dimock Jr., The Place of
the Hidden Moon, 1989.
Sahasradalapadma
In many schools of yoga, and in the reli-
gious tradition known as tantra, one of
the sites in the subtle body (an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the
material body). The subtle body consists
of a set of six psychic centers (chakras),
which are visualized as six multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along theSakata Chauth
course of the spine and connected by
three vertical channels. Each of these
chakras has important symbolic associ-
ations—with different human capaci-
ties, with different subtle elements (tan-
matras), and with different seed sylla-
bles (bijaksharas) formed from the let-
ters of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sound. Above
and below these centers are the bodily
abodes of Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power), the two divine principles
through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind this concept of the
subtle body is thus the homology of
macrocosm and microcosm, an essen-
tial Hindu idea since the time of the
mystical texts known as the Upanishads.
The sahasradalapadma is the site at
the apex of the subtle body, visualized
as a “thousand-petaled lotus” located in
the crown of the head. This is identified
as the bodily abode of Shiva, where he is
ever-present. In tantra, final liberation
(moksha) comes through the divine
union of Shiva and Shakti in one’s own
body. This is done through awakening
the kundalini, the bodily correlate of
Shakti that lies dormant at the base
of the spine, and drawing the kundalini
up to the sahasradalapadma to effect
the divine union. The sahasradalapadma
is identified with the seed syllable
Om, the symbol of completeness and
perfection. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Sai Baba
Name used by two different charismatic
Hindu teachers, now distinguished by
the addition of other names. The earlier
of the two is Shirdi Sai Baba (d. 1918), so
named for the town in the state of
Maharashtra where he lived much of his
life. The latter figure, Sathya (“true”) Sai
Baba (b. 1926), is a modern Hindu
religious figure of the type known as a
godman, who claims to be the reincar-
nation of Shirdi Sai Baba.
Sainhikeya
In Hindu mythology, demon who
appears in the story of churning the
Ocean of Milk. After the gods and
demons join forces to churn the Ocean
of Milk and obtain the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta), the gods succeed in trick-
ing the demons out of their share. As the
gods divide this nectar among them-
selves, the demon Sainhikeya slips into
the distribution line and is mistakenly
served some as well. As the demon
drinks it, the Sun and Moon alert the
god Vishnu to his presence and Vishnu
cuts off the demon’s head with his dis-
cus. Although the head and body are
separated, both parts become immortal
through their contact with the nectar.
The head becomes Rahu, while the
body becomes Ketu, both of which are
considered malevolent planets in
Indian astrology (jyotisha). According to
tradition, Rahu is also the cause of
eclipses: He roams the sky, chasing the
Sun and Moon, and tries to get revenge
by swallowing them, but the two planets
always pass unharmed out of his sev-
ered neck. See also Tortoise avatar.
Sakata Chauth
Festival falling on the fourth day
(chauth) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Magh (January–
February), which is celebrated as the
birthday of the god Ganesh. Those who
observe this festival are believed to gain
Ganesh’s blessings—wisdom, freedom
from troubles, and prosperity. The
fourth day of every lunar fortnight is
sacred to Ganesh, and vows marking
this day may be performed by his devo-
tees (bhakta). The biggest Ganesh festi-
val of the year is not his birthday, but
Ganesh Chaturthi, which falls on the
fourth day of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September).
[[583]]
Sakha (“companion”) Bhava
Sakha (“companion”) Bhava
The third of the five modes of devotion
to the Supreme Being that were most
prominently expressed by Rupa Goswami.
Rupa used different types of human
relationships as models for the possi-
ble relationships between deity and
devotee (bhakta). These five models
increased in emotional intensity from
the peaceful (shanta) sense that comes
from realizing one’s complete identity
with Brahman, or Supreme Reality, to
conceiving of God as one’s master,
friend, child, or lover. In the sakha
bhava, devotees consider themselves
as God’s friends and companions and
thus as taking part in his regular, every-
day activities.
Sakhi
(“friend,” “companion”) The motif of
friendship as a religious ideal was well
developed by the devotees (bhakta) of
the god Krishna, and to a lesser extent
by devotees of the god Rama. Both of
these deities are avatars (incarnations)
of the god Vishnu, and Vaishnava
devotion tends to stress not only wor-
ship of the chosen deity, but also the
notions of relationship and commu-
nion—both between the deity and
devotee, and among devotees them-
selves. Vaishnava religious practice
often involved elaborate visualization
exercises, in which devotees would
envision the deity’s daily activities—for
Krishna, the simple life of a village
cowherd, and for Rama, the life of a
prince. Some devotional manuals give
detailed daily schedules of the deity’s
activities to facilitate this process of
visualization. Such elaborate visualiza-
tion allowed the devotees to symboli-
cally enter the deity’s world and take
part in the deity’s divine play (lila) on
earth, building a relationship with God
through sharing the mundane ele-
ments of everyday life. In this sort of
visualization, devotees commonly con-
sidered themselves to be the deity’s
sakhis or companions—in some cases
male companions, and in other cases
[[584]]

female companions of the deity’s con-
sorts, Radha and Sita. Taking on the
persona of a sakhi provided a devotee
with a concrete place in the divine
world, in which he or she could both
observe and participate in the god’s
earthly activity.
Sakshin
(“witness”) The perceiving conscious-
ness believed to be the inner Self
(atman), which observes changes going
on around it but is utterly unaffected by
them. It is described in a primitive way
as early as the Upanishads, the specula-
tive texts that form the final layer of the
Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The Katha Upanishad
describes the Self as a thumb-sized per-
son inside the head. The Samkhya
philosophical school develops this
notion in a more subtle and sophisticated
way: of its two fundamental first
principles, one is the purusha, which is
the conscious but inert witness to the
transformations of prakrti, or nature.
Later philosophical schools such as
Vedanta reject the Samkhya school’s
dualism by collapsing all reality into a
single ultimate principle known as
Brahman. Vedanta’s conception of
Brahman as “being-consciousness-
bliss” (sacchidananda) also conceives of
the Self as the conscious and unchang-
ing witness to the material flux sur-
rounding it.
Sala
In Hindi, “wife’s brother.” The term can
be used as a serious insult if applied to
someone who is not related in this way.
Calling someone “sala” implies that the
other is in a position of relative sub-
servience, since he is a member of the
family that “gives” the bride. It also
implies that one is having sexual rela-
tions with that person’s sister, an allega-
tion that is an insult to a family’s honor,
whether or not it is true.Samavartana (“return”) Samskara
Salmala (“Silk-Cotton
Tree”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the
third of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Samadhi
(“trance”) In the ashtanga yoga first
codified by the philosopher Patanjali,
the last of the eight elements of yoga
practice. Along with dharana (“concen-
tration”) and dhyana (“meditation”),
samadhi is one of the three practices
that make up the “inner discipline”
(samyama), the culmination of yogic
training. Samadhi is described as a state
in which the mind is conscious of only
the object of concentration, and is
devoid of any notion of the self as per-
ceiver. Once one has attained samhadi
on the conscious plane, one supposedly
pursues it on more subtle inner planes.
The loss of subjectivity in samadhi is
believed to make people unaware of the
outside world, such that they will not
respond to stimuli and may sometimes
appear almost dead. For this reason, the
burial places of deceased ascetics are
usually referred to as samadhi shrines,
since it is popularly believed that
they are not dead, but only rapt in
deep meditation.
Samadhi Shrine
Burial place of a deceased ascetic. Part
of the process of ascetic initiation is the
initiate’s ritualized death, in which he
(or far more rarely, she) performs his (or
her) own funeral rites, followed by
rebirth with a new name and a new
identity. Consequently, upon the physi-
cal death of an ascetic the funeral rites
(antyeshthi) are not performed, since
the ascetic is (ritually speaking) already
dead. The body is often disposed of by
being weighted down with rocks and
thrown into a river, but well-known and
powerful ascetics are often buried, usu-
ally in a sitting position as if in medita-
tion. Such people are often buried in
places associated with their presence
during their lives—whether a room,
building, or particular outdoor site. In
popular wisdom such ascetics are
believed not to be dead but only rapt in
deep meditation (samadhi). The
samadhi shrines of very renowned
ascetics often have shrines built over
them, which can become places of pil-
grimage for those seeking the ascetic’s
continuing blessings (ashirvad).
Samana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily winds considered
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, vyana,
and udana. The samana wind is consid-
ered to reside in the navel, and to aid in
the process of digestion.
Samasthana
In yoga practice, sitting position in
which the legs are bent, with the soles of
the feet pressed flat against one another
and the outer edges of the feet on the
ground. See utkutikasana.
Samavartana (“return”) Samskara
The fourteenth of the life-cycle cere-
monies (samskaras), which marks the
end of a young man’s life as a celibate
student (brahmacharin) and the return
to his parental home. The most impor-
tant element in this rite is a bath, after
which the young man changes into new
clothes, marking his change in status.
The young man is supposed to ask his
guru’s permission before performing
the ceremony, and gives him his
teacher’s fee (dakshina), both as pay-
ment for services rendered and as a sign
of respect. Shortly after his return to his
natal home, the young man usually
gets married. In modern times this
rite is not often observed, due to the
decline of the traditional paradigm
of the brahmacharin stage of life,
although sometimes it is performed in
preparation for a marriage.
[[585]]
Samavaya
The four Vedas in Sanskrit. The Sama Veda is the second of the four Vedas.
[[586]]

SamavayaSama Veda
(“inherence”) Fundamental category
in the worldview of the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika philosophical school.
This school conceives of the world as
made up of atomistic parts, which are
connected to form larger things. The
fundamental function of samavaya is
as a subtle glue to connect various
things: wholes and their parts, sub-
stances and their attributes, motions
and the things that move, and general
properties and their particular
instances. It also connects both plea-
sure and pain to the Self. Thus
samavaya is the fundamental thing
holding the universe together. The
philosophical problems raised by the
idea of inherence—particularly the
claim that inherence was one single
principle, and not a collection of
things—were ultimately responsible
for the rise of Navyanyaya school,
which attempted to explain these rela-
tionships in a more sophisticated way.Traditionally considered the second of
the four Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts. The
Sama Veda is a collection of hymns,
arranged for singing as one of the com-
ponents of the Vedic sacrifices (yajna).
While drawn mostly from the Rg Veda,
the singing patterns are far more elabo-
rate than the simple chanting generally
associated with the Rg Veda. Thus it is
believed that the Sama Veda developed
later than the Rg Veda.
Sambandar
(7th c.) One of the earliest of the
Nayanars, a group of sixty-three south-
ern Indian poet-saints who were devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. Along
with their contemporaries the Alvars,
who were devotees of Vishnu, the
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization
of Hindu religion through their passion-
ate devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed in hymns sung in the Tamil
language. Along with his contemporarySamkhya
Appar, Sambandar actively opposed the
unorthodox sects of the times, particu-
larly the Jains, whom he reviles in his
poems. The depth of his hatred can be
seen in a well-established tradition
that, after converting the king of
Madurai, of the Pandya dynasty, from
Jainism to Shaivism, Sambandar was
instrumental in having eight thousand
Jain ascetics executed by impalement.
The collected hymns of the three most
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,
and Sundaramurtti—comprise the
Devaram, the most sacred of the Tamil
Shaivite texts. See also Shaiva.
Samharakrama
(“destruction method”) Ritual in the
Shrividya school of the secretive reli-
gious practice known as tantra. This rit-
ual uses the shrichakra, a symbolic dia-
gram used in worship. The adept’s ritual
journey starts at the outer edges of the
shrichakra, which represents the appar-
ently “real” everyday world, and gradu-
ally moves toward the center, where a
single point (bindu) represents absolute
unity. This process is called “destruc-
tion” because the ritual process system-
atically deconstructs the notion of the
dualistic world and destroys the notion
of a Self that is separate from the
Absolute Reality. For further informa-
tion see Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The
Secret of the Three Cities, 1990.
Samhita
(“collection”) The most archaic textual
layer in the Vedas, comprising hymns to
the Vedic deities, benedictions, prayers,
spells, and litanies. The term indicates
that this group of texts is a collection of
various things important, not only for
their cognitive meaning, but for their
power as mantra (sacred sound). The
samhitas were chanted during rites of
sacrifice and remain the oldest living
part of the Hindu tradition. Following
the samhitas are the three later textual
levels: the Brahmanas, which are
essentially manuals detailing correct
performance of the sacrifice, and the
Aranyakas and the Upanishads, which
ask speculative questions about the
power behind the sacrifice.
Samkalpa
(“intention”) Important ritual sequence
at the beginning of many religious rites
in which the person performing the rite
states his or her identity, the time and
place at which the action is being per-
formed, the performer’s intention to
carry out this particular ritual act,
and the benefits desired from the action.
The samkalpa is important as the
formal commitment to perform the
stated action. For ritual actions that
promise several different possible
benefits—for example, birth in heaven
or final liberation—performing the
samkalpa is believed to give one the
result one desires.
Samkhya
(“enumeration”) One of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, whose
founding text is the Samkhyakarikas,
written by Ishvarakrishna in the third
century B.C.E. Samkhya espouses an
atheistic philosophical dualism positing
two fundamental principles as the
source of all things. The first of these is
called purusha (“person”), which is con-
scious, but completely inactive and
unchanging. It is seen as a passive wit-
ness to the transformations going on
around it. As the source of conscious-
ness, purusha is ultimately identified
with an individual’s true and eternal
Self. Purusha is inferred as plural, given
the plurality of conscious beings, com-
bined with the fact that one person can
gain enlightenment while all the rest
remain in bondage.
The other fundamental principle is
prakrti, (“nature”), which provides the
object to the purusha’s subject. Prakrti is
better conceived of as force or power
rather than a specific material object.
Prakrti contains within it forces with three
different primordial qualities (gunas):
[[587]]
Samkhya
sattva tends toward the good, rajas
towards activity or passion, and tamas
towards darkness and decay. In the pri-
mal prakrti these three forces are in per-
fect equilibrium, each perfectly balanc-
ing the others. The two principles of
purusha and prakrti are distinct, sepa-
rate, and alone.
When prakrti’s initial equilibrium is
disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern of
evolution that creates both the exterior
physical world and the interior psycho-
logical world. From prakrti emerges
mahat (“the great one”), which has as its
psychological counterpart the subtlest
form of mental activity (buddhi). From
buddhi evolves ahamkar, which con-
tains the first real ideas of individual
identity. From ahamkar evolves the
mind (manas), the sense organs (jna-
nendriyas), the organs of action (kar-
mendriyas), and the subtle elements
(tanmatras); from the last evolve the
gross elements that actually make up
the material world. All of these evo-
lutes—material or psychic—have a dif-
fering balance of the three gunas, which
ultimately determines their character as
wholesome, active, or unwholesome.
Throughout this process of evolution,
purusha remains unchanged, a mere
witness to prakrti’s unceasing transfor-
mations. Their mutual functioning is
described using the metaphor of the
lame man (purusha) being carried by
the blind man (prakrti).
The ultimate source of bondage,
according to the Samkhya school,
comes because people do not recognize
the difference between these two princi-
ples. Through this lack of discrimination
between the two, the Self (purusha)
appears as if it is an agent, and the evo-
lutes (from prakrti) as if they are con-
scious. The Samkhyas illustrate this mis-
understanding using the example of the
rose behind the crystal, in which the lat-
ter appears to be colored but is in fact
unchanged. Although for the Samkhyas
prakrti undergoes real transformations,
the primary problem is epistemologi-
cal—that is, how one comes to know
things—rather than ontological, or rooted
[[588]]

in the nature of things themselves. Since
the purusha never changes, there is no
question of making it into anything else
or regaining the way that it used to be;
the real problem is making the distinc-
tion between the differing realities of
these two principles. Once this has been
done, the evolution of prakrti is said to
reverse, leaving the purusha again in its
state of magnificent isolation (kaivalya).
Of course, once one has a developed (if
erroneous) idea of (conventional) per-
sonality, this discrimination becomes all
the more difficult. This mistaken idea
becomes the basis for one’s volitional
actions (karma) and one’s emotional
dispositions. One’s actions and disposi-
tions reinforce each other, and both of
these are undergirded by the notion of a
Self.
The Samkhya metaphysics were
adopted wholesale by the yoga philo-
sophical school, and the two schools are
usually mentioned together—Samkhya
as the theoretical foundation, and Yoga
as the practical component. One of
Samkhya’s lasting contributions to
Indian thought is the idea of the gunas, a
basic concept running through Hindu
culture. Another influential but less per-
vasive idea is their model of evolution,
which has been adapted by other
schools but often subsumed under the-
istic assumptions in which God is the
source of both consciousness and the
material world. The one philosophical
problem that the Samkhya could never
surmount was to explain the source of
bondage, given their starting assump-
tions. If purusha and prakrti are com-
pletely separate, how could the two of
them interact—much less mistake one
for the other—and how did the process
of evolution begin? Although their con-
tributions remain significant, they were
largely eclipsed by Vedanta, which
claimed that the problem is ignorance of
the Self and not-Self, and that the world
around us is not an actual evolution, but
only an illusory transformation (vivarta).
This philosophical model is called
Vivartavada. For further information
see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan andSamsara
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957; and Gerald
Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya
(eds.), Samkhya, 1987.
Sampraday
(“tradition”) Literally, “that which is
handed down,” or the transmitted body
of teachings that distinguishes one reli-
gious group from another. Belonging to
a particular sampraday is based on hav-
ing received teachings from one’s spiri-
tual preceptor (guru), thus becoming
part of a spiritual lineage, and continu-
ing the life of that sampraday by trans-
mitting the teachings to disciples.
Although the sampraday is often trans-
lated as “sect,” this loses its sense of
uniqueness within particular theistic
traditions. For example, one can speak
of different sampradays among Tamil
Shaiva brahmins, by virtue of their dif-
fering spiritual lineages, even though
they worship the same deity and share a
common cultural heritage.
Samsara
(“wandering”) The cycle of reincarna-
tion, one of the most fundamental
assumptions throughout all Indian reli-
gion. In the Indian worldview, reincar-
nation involves a series of births and
rebirths in different realms and forms,
all based on the quality and quantity of
karma, formed through previous
actions and patterns of thought. Beings
with good karma may be born into the
heavens, which are essentially realms of
pleasure and carefree enjoyment; those
with bad karma may be reborn as ani-
mals or as ghosts, or into realms of pun-
ishment, such as hells. Neither pleasure
nor punishment is eternal, although
they may last an extremely long time.
Beings in heaven enjoy the results of
their past actions, but when their good
karma is exhausted they must take
another, lower birth; beings in realms of
punishment are paying for their evil
deeds, but when this has been done they
will take another birth, presumably in
some higher status.
Between these two lies the human
realm, which comprises infinite possi-
bilities, based on various factors—such
as high status or low, wealth or poverty,
health or disability, and the religious
piety of one’s natal family. Varying mix-
tures of good and bad karma combine
for many different human circum-
stances, and according to popular
belief one’s present life and body are a
record of one’s past. The notion that
people are, in life, where they deserve
to be because of karma can be seen as
the basis for the caste system.
Fulfilling one’s particular social role
(svadharma), no matter how humble,
not only upholds the social order but is
a means for individual spiritual
advancement.
The human realm is widely believed
to be the best of all for spiritual life,
partly because human beings can
make rational choices, including the
decision to take part in religious life. In
this humans are different from ani-
mals, which are driven mainly by their
instincts, and from ghosts or hell-
dwellers, who are simply expiating
their past acts. At the same time
human life, unlike life in the heavens,
is full of reverses and sorrow continu-
ally reminding human beings about
the transience of life and possessions
and the need to engage in spiritual
development. Embodied existence is a
constant cycling from one realm to the
next, leaving one body and assuming
another, and the inherent uncertainty
of this condition has led to the search,
dating from the time of the speculative
texts known as the Upanishads, for an
unchanging state, completely out of
this cycle of rebirth. This unchanging
state is widely accepted as life’s
supreme goal, although in any genera-
tion very few actively seek it, with most
people content to relegate it to some
indefinite future lifetime. For further
information see Wendy Doniger
O’Flaherty (ed.), Karma and Rebirth in
Classical Indian Traditions, 1980.
[[589]]
Samskara
The chudakarana samskara, in which a child’s head is shaved as a rite of purification.
Samskara
(“making perfect”) Collective name for
the various life-cycle ceremonies in
Hindu society. Although status in Indian
society depends most on one’s birth,
[[590]]

this alone is not sufficient to become a
complete and finished person. In an
individual’s development, the raw mate-
rial given by nature must be refined
through the process of culture, or theSamvad
action of samskaras. This process of
transformation begins before birth,
with the three prenatal samskaras, and
continues to death with the antyeshthi
samskaras. In general, samskaras trans-
form people in two ways: by removing
latent or residual impurities, such as the
childhood chudakarana samskara, or
by generating new capacities and enti-
tlements, such as the upanayana (initia-
tion) and vivaha (marriage) samskaras.
Although different writers in the dhar-
ma literature disagree on the number of
samskaras, traditionally, sixteen are
accepted. Three were prenatal samskaras:
one to ensure conception (Garbhadhana),
one to ensure the birth of a boy
(Pumsavana), and one to ensure an easy
delivery and a healthy child (Siman-
tonnayana). Six samskaras were associat-
ed with childhood: ritual actions immedi-
ately after birth (Jatakarma), name-giving
(Namakarana), the first outing (Nishkra-
mana), the first solid food (Anna-
prashana), head-shaving (Chudakarana),
and piercing of the ears (Karnavedha).
Five samskaras were connected with life as
a celibate student (brahmacharin): begin-
ning of learning (Vidyarambha), adoles-
cent religious initiation (Upanayana), the
beginning of Veda study (Vedarambha),
the first shave (Keshanta), and the return
home at the conclusion of studies (Sama-
vartana). The final two samskaras were
marriage, and the last rites for the dead
(antyeshthi samskara).
These sixteen samskaras were the
rites for a twice-born man, whom this
literature considered the default person.
A twice-born man was one born into
one of the three “twice-born” varnas—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—who
were ritually eligible for the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” Women in the twice-born
groups would undergo all the rites
through the childhood rites, but would
have no further rites until marriage,
which was considered equal to all sam-
skaras for them. People born outside the
twice-born groups—namely, shudras
and untouchables—would perform few
if any of these rites.
These life cycle rites drive and gov-
ern the formation of the individual. In
modern times many of these sam-
skaras are still performed, but mainly
by brahmins who, because of their tra-
ditional role as priests and scholars,
conserve this practice to help main-
tain their traditional prestige. For fur-
ther information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane, A History of Dharma-
sastra, 1968; and Raj Bali Pandey,
Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The former is
encyclopedic and the latter more
accessible; despite their age, they
remain the best sources about tradi-
tional Hindu rites.
Samudra Gupta
(r. 335–376) The second monarch in the
Gupta dynasty, son of Chandra Gupta I.
During his reign Samudra Gupta made
significant territorial gains from the
Gupta dynasty’s home base in eastern
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar westward to
the Ganges basin and eastward into
Bengal and Assam. Orissa and much of
the Coromandel Coast gave tribute as
independent but vassal states. Samudra
Gupta left a personal account of his
prowess inscribed on a stone column at
Allahabad. This column had originally
been carved to display one of the Pillar
Edicts of the Maurya emperor Ashoka
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.), and in claiming it as
his own Samudra Gupta was attempting
to appropriate some of the Maurya
dynasty’s luster.
Samvad
(“dialogue”) Technical term for the
speaking parts in the Ramnagar Ram
Lila, a dramatic presentation of the
Ramayana staged annually at the forti-
fied town of Ramnagar, near Benares.
The dialogues are interspersed with
recitations from the Ramcharitmanas,
a vernacular retelling of the Ramayana
written by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?), and render the archaic
language of the Ramcharitmanas into
modern vernacular Hindi. The action in
[[591]]
Samyama
the Ram Lila alternates between con-
temporary and archaic text.
Samyama
(“inner discipline”) In the ashtanga
yoga first codified by the philosopher
Patanjali, a collective name for the last
three stages in yoga practice, namely
dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. These
stages are concerned with focusing and
disciplining the mind, and are the most
subtle and internalized elements in
yogic practice.
Sanaka
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma, who are
paradigms of asceticism; the other
three are Sanandana, Sanatana,
and Sanatkumara. When Brahma
emanates these four sages, he com-
mands them to begin the work of cre-
ation, but they are so detached from
worldly concerns that they refuse to
do so. They are celibate their entire
lives, study the Vedas from childhood,
and always travel together.
Sanakadi
(“Sanaka and the others”) In Hindu
mythology, a collective name for four
sages born of Brahma who are para-
digms of asceticism; the four sages
are Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana,
and Sanatkumara. When Brahma
emanates them, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanaka Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday)
of the Naga class of the Bairagi ascetics.
Bairagi ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu. The Nagas are fighting
ascetics hired by the other Bairagis to
protect them. The Naga class is orga-
[[592]]

nized in military fashion into different
anis or “armies.” Until the beginning of
the nineteenth century their primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these have largely
disappeared in contemporary times.
The Sanaka Sampraday traces its spiri-
tual lineage from the Nimbarki sect,
founded by Nimbarka. Members of this
sect worship Radha and Krishna as a
divine couple, with both deities holding
equal status.
Sanandana
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are par-
adigms of asceticism; the other three
are Sanaka, Sanatana, and Sana-
tkumara. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanatana
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are para-
digms of asceticism; the other three
ascetics are Sanaka, Sanandana, and
Sanatkumara. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanatana (“eternal”) Dharma
In the dharma literature, the ultimate
and eternal moral order of the universe.
It is the eternal ideal pattern revealed in
the Vedas (the oldest and most authori-
tative Hindu religious texts). This pat-
tern must be upheld to maintain the sta-
bility of society. All aspects of religious
duty (dharma) aim ultimately towardSandhi
the maintenance and fulfillment of this
order, including common religious
duties (sadharana dharma), religious
duties stemming from social status
(varna dharma) and stage of life (ash-
rama dharma), and individualized reli-
gious duty (svadharma). In more recent
times, the term has been used
by Hindus to identify the religious
tradition known to the outside world
as “Hinduism.”
Sanatana Sampraday
Another name for the Nimbarki reli-
gious community. The philosopher
Nimbarka was the community’s histori-
cal founder, but, according to the
Nimbarkis, the actual founder was the
god Vishnu himself. One of Vishnu’s dis-
ciples was named Sanatana (“eternal”),
hence the name of the sampraday.
Sanatkumara
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are par-
adigms of asceticism; the other three
are
Sanaka,
Sanandana,
and
Sanatana. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together
Sandhabhasha
Symbolic language used in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious prac-
tice. The literal translation of the term
is disputed; it is often translated as
“twilight language” because of its
shadowy and mysterious character,
but Agehananda Bharati is emphatic
that the term means “intentional lan-
guage.” The elements of tantric wor-
ship and practice are described in a
coded language drawn from the parts
and functions of the human body con-
sidered private by most standards.
Such coded discourse is used to hide
the tradition’s essentials from nonini-
tiates and also to project the speakers
into an altered understanding. For
noninitiates, such language reinforces
the general conception of tantric prac-
titioners as completely debased.
Douglas R. Brooks reports in The
Secret of the Three Cities, 1990, that
although widely used in Buddhist
tantra, Sandhabhasha is less common
among Hindus, who for their coded
language favor using common words
with contextually technical meanings.

Tradition, 1977; Appendix A in Linda

Sandhi
Sandarshana (“expositing”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the hand
gesture used to signify explanation or
exposition, and for this reason it is also
known as the vyakhyana (“teaching”)
mudra. Since the teaching gesture indi-
cates a person of higher spiritual attain-
ment, it is also known as the chit (“con-
sciousness”) mudra.
(“junction”) In classical Sanskrit gram-
mar, a term for the euphonic (harmonic)
combination of words. In general this is
done by modifying the final phoneme of
one word, based on the initial phoneme
of the following word, to facilitate a
smooth verbal transition between the
two. An example is the compound word
sacchidananda, which designates the
three essential aspects of the ultimate
unqualified Brahman, and is formed
from the words sat (“being”), chit (“con-
sciousness”) and ananda (“bliss”).
[[593]]
Sandhya
Sandhya
(“union”) Morning and evening twilight,
the two transitional times between day
and night and thus, metaphorically, the
times when day and night are united.
The word also often denotes certain
rites performed daily at morning, noon,
and evening, the three times when dif-
ferent parts of the day are in union.
These rites are prescribed in the dhar-
ma literature as mandatory for all
twice-born men, that is, all men from
the brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya
groups who have undergone the adoles-
cent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” At present time these
rites are performed only by the most
orthodox brahmins.
Sangam
(“coming together”) Meeting-place for
two rivers and the point at which their
capacity for purification is believed to
be heightened. The most famous such
site is the confluence of the Ganges
and the Yamuna rivers at the city of
Allahabad, but numerous other such
sites exist throughout the Indian sub-
continent.
Sangama Dynasty

Sangam Literature
Collection of classical literature from the
Tamil culture, composed during the
early centuries of the common era;
Sangam (also spelled Cankam) means
“academy.” The most famous texts in
Sangam literature are eight collections
of short poems. Three of these collec-
tions fall into the genre called puram
(“the outer part”); the other five are in
the genre called akam (“the inner part”).
Puram poetry was “public” verse,
describing the deeds of kings, war,
death, and other heroic actions. Akam
poetry was about an individual’s inner
experience, especially cultured love, of
which the Sangam poets distinguished
five developed moods: union, patient
[[594]]

waiting, unfaithfulness, separation, and
hardship. Each of these moods had well-
developed symbolic associations,
including associations with a specific
type of landscape, time of day and year,
flora, fauna, and types of people; such
richly developed symbolism gives these
poems incredible symbolic depth. The
akam poems are arguably the literary
antecedents to devotional (bhakti)
poetry, which first developed in Tamil
Nadu. For further information see A.K.
Ramanujan (trans.), The Interior
Landscape, 1994; and Glenn Yocum,
“Shrines, Shamanism, and Love Poetry:
Elements in the Emergence of Popular
Tamil Bhakti,” in the Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. 41,
No. 1, 1973. See also Tamil epics and
Tamil language.
Sanjaya
Minister of the blind king Dhrtarashtra,
an important older figure in the Hindu
epic the Mahabharata. Sanjaya tries
valiantly to avert the war that is the epic’s
climax by counseling the king to better
control his son Duryodhana, and to deal
more equitably with his nephews the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are the
epic’s protagonists. In the end, the king
ignores Sanjaya’s advice. Sanjaya is most
famous for his ability to see anything he
thinks about (“tele-vision”). This power is
given to him as a gift from the sage Vyasa
so he can describe the progress of the war
to Dhrtarashtra without actually having to
be there. After the war, Sanjaya goes to live
in the forest with Dhrtarashtra, and it is he
who informs the Pandavas about the blind
king’s death in a forest fire.
Sanjaya Belatthiputa
Agnostic thinker in early Indian philos-
ophy whose views are alluded to in
the Buddhist scriptures. The scriptures
portray Sanjaya as an advocate of
profound agnosticism with regard to
another world, the effects of good and
evil deeds, and just about every facet of
religious life.Sanskrit
Sanjna
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of
Vishvakarma, workman and architect
for the gods. Sanjna has been married to
Surya, the Sun, but finds his dazzling
radiance too much to bear. To help his
daughter adjust to her husband,
Vishvakarma trims off some bits of the
sun with his divine tools, removing
enough of his radiance that Samjna can
bear to be with him. The trimmed-off
parts of the sun are used to build the
Pushpak Viman, an aerial car, as well as
the god Vishnu’s discus (chakra), the
god Shiva’s trident, and various other
divine weapons.
Sankalpa
Spoken ritual performed before a reli-
gious act. The person about to perform
the act identifies himself by name, tells
the location of the act, and gives the
lunar calendar date and time. He goes
on to describe the religious act and what
benefits he wants to receive as a result.
Sankalpa is done before rituals such as
suicide and doing morning puja to the
Ganges. See samkalpa.
Sankarshana
(“dragging away”) Epithet of the god
Krishna’s brother Balarama, referring
to Balarama’s unusual prenatal devel-
opment—he is conceived by Krishna’s
mother Devaki but is magically trans-
ferred into the womb of her co-wife
Rohini. This is done to protect him
from harm, since Devaki’s wicked
uncle Kamsa has already killed her
first seven children, and will certainly
do the same if she carries Balarama to
term. See Balarama.
Sankat Mochan
(“freeing from distress”) Epithet of a partic-
ular form of the monkey-god Hanuman,
whose main temple is on the southern part
of Benares. Sankat Mochan has been an
increasingly popular form of Hanuman
since the 1970s. As with all manifestations
of Hanuman, Sankat Mochan is consid-
ered a strong protective deity, with the
power to rescue his devotees (bhakta)
from all kinds of trouble and misfortune.
Sankat Mochan
(2) A temple in the southern part of
Benares dedicated to the monkey-god
Hanuman in his form as Sankat Mochan.
The temple does not have a long history
but first became famous in the nineteenth
century through some Ramanandi ascetics
living there, whose piety drew visitors to
the spot. In modern times, the temple
has become popular because the image
of Hanuman is believed to be very pow-
erful, but also accessible—qualities that
lead petitioners to come with requests
and leave with the assurance that help
is forthcoming.
Sankranti
(“transition”) The transition of a celestial
body (sun, moon, or planet) from one
sign of the zodiac to another. Such tran-
sitions can give the celestial bodies or
the time in question positive or negative
qualities. The most important of these
celestial bodies is the sun, whose two
directional transitions—northward at
Makara Sankranti, and southward at
Karka Sankranti—define more and less
auspicious times for the entire year.
Sanskrit
(“perfected”) For much of Indian history,
Sanskrit was the language of the cultural
and religious elite. Even in the twentieth
century, it is still the language with the
highest religious status. Its name reflects
the religious conviction that it was the
perfect language—the language of the
gods. Sanskrit was essentially fixed in the
fourth century B.C.E. by the grammarian
Panini in his Ashtadhyayi. Since it has
not changed from Panini’s time, Sanskrit
is no longer considered a “natural”
language. Even in Panini’s time, Sanskrit
would have been a person’s second
language, learned by conscious study
after acquiring a grammatically simpler
mother tongue (one of the Prakrits)
[[595]]
Sant
An illustrated page of Sanskrit from the first chapter of the Devimahatmya.
The illustration depicts the opening episode, in which a king and a merchant visit a hermit.
through the normal process of language
learning. In a religious context Sanskrit
has primarily been the province of
brahmins, serving both as a sacred
language and a common language
through which the brahmins from vari-
ous areas could communicate with each
other. Its place of pride as the religious
language par excellence has been some-
what undercut by the influence of the
devotional (bhakti) religious movement.
One of this movement’s pervasive fea-
tures was poetry composed in vernacular
languages, which reflected the conscious
choice to speak in a language that every-
one could understand.
Sant
[[596]]

Literally, someone who has found the
truth, or who is searching for it. The
word is derived from the Sanskrit word
sat (“truth”). More generally it refers to
two major groups of devotional (bhakti)
poet-saints. One group was centered
around the temple of Vithoba at
Pandharpur in the state of Maharashtra,
and includes saints from the Varkari
Panth community such as Namdev,
Tukaram, Chokamela, and Eknath.
The other group included later poet-
saints from various places in northern
India, among them Kabir, Ravidas,
Dadu, and Guru Nanak, the founder of
the Sikh community.
As a group the sants shared certain
general tendencies rather than an
explicit body of doctrine. Sant religion
was inclined to stress an individual-
ized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine, rather
than participation in established cults.
One of the most common sant themes
was their disdain for external ritual,
and the general rejection of any wor-
ship using images. The northern
Indian sants are the most uncompro-
mising advocates of nirguna devotion,
in which the divine is seen as beyond
conception; but even among the
Pandharpur devotees (bhakta) the
stress was on devotion to the god
Vithoba, rather than actual worship.
The sants stressed the power of the
divine Name and its ability to remove
all obstacles. They disregarded caste
distinctions, viewing them as an arbi-
trary barrier dividing the human com-
munity. They stressed instead the value
of satsang, and the transforming
effects that such “good company”
could bring. Satsang thus formed an
egalitarian community through the
common bonds of faith and devotion,
as an alternative to the hierarchical
society established by birth.
It is sometimes suggested that all of
these themes can be traced to the sants’
social background, since many of themSantoshi Ma
came from very low caste communities. It
is certainly true that devotees of low social
status would have been forbidden even to
enter temples, much less worship the
images in those temples, and thus a reli-
gious path emphasizing the Name and
interior religious experience, which are
accessible to everyone, might have
seemed a more viable option. In the same
way, the socially oppressed might find the
notion of an alternative, egalitarian com-
munity immensely attractive. Yet to
reduce the sant tradition to a simple reac-
tion by marginal social groups cannot
explain why one of its major figures is
Eknath, a brahmin. Such reductionist
analyses ignore the sant movement’s real
thrust, namely the passionate search for
the divine that permitted no compromis-
es and no excuses. For further informa-
tion see Karine Schomer and W. H.
McLeod, The Sants, 1985.
Santal
Tribal (adivasi) community in northern
India, particularly in the border districts
of Bihar and West Bengal. As with most
tribals in India, many are very poor and
make a precarious living as cultivators.
Santoshi Ma
(“the mother who satisfies”) Goddess
who is one of the most fascinating
Hindu deities, and whose recent explo-
sive popularity illustrates both the flexi-
bility of the Hindu pantheon, and the
way that Hindu religion reflects and
responds to changes in Indian society.
Santoshi Ma’s popularity was largely
inspired by a film released in 1975, Jai
Santoshi Ma (“Victory to Santoshi Ma”).
The film first details the birth of Santoshi
Ma as the daughter of the god Ganesh,
but then cuts to the earthly problems
suffered by one of her devotees (bhakta),
Satyavati. Satyavati is a new bride hav-
ing problems adjusting to her marital
home, particularly because of tensions
with her wicked sisters-in-law. By the
end of the film, through Satyavati’s
steadfast devotion to Santoshi Ma, all of
her problems are resolved.
This film did not invent Santoshi Ma,
although it was largely responsible for
spreading her worship. The prescrip-
tions for Santoshi Ma’s religious vow
(vrat) had existed before the film was
made, and both the rite’s charter myth
and the film focus on the problems of a
new bride and their eventual resolution
through her steadfast devotion to
Santoshi Ma. Santoshi Ma’s ultimate
source is a mystery, but her iconography
suggests that she is an amalgam of other
female deities. She is seated on the lotus,
a feature associated with the goddess
Lakshmi; she wields the sword associated
with the goddesses Kali and Durga, as
well as the trident associated with the
god Shiva. She shows the attributes
associated with both married and
unmarried goddesses: Like the married
goddesses, she is nurturing and caring
to her devotees, playing the role of the
benevolent Indian mother, and like the
independent unmarried goddesses, she
is powerful and and potentially danger-
ous—one of the film’s climactic scenes
shows her utterly destroying a temple
after Satyavati’s sister-in-law intention-
ally ruined the sanctified food (prasad)
meant for her devotees. Yet she is also
believed to have the power to grant her
devotees’ requests, no matter how large.
Through her nurturing, benevolent
character coupled with power, she
crosses the usual boundaries associated
with Hindu goddesses.
Part of the popularity of Santoshi
Ma’s vrat comes from its simplicity,
cheapness, and promise of benefits. The
observance is usually kept by women
with the aim of attaining concrete goals
for themselves and their families: get-
ting a job, passing an exam, conceiving a
child, or arranging a marriage. The rite
involves weekly fasting (upavasa) and
worship. One of the social factors cited
in Santoshi Ma’s explosive popularity is
the steadily growing uncertainty in
Indian (and South Asian) life, which
makes very ordinary things difficult
to attain and necessitates the use of
all possible resources. In this context,
an inexpensive rite that promises
[[597]]
Santoshi Ma Vrat
concrete benefits for assiduous devotion
is an attractive option. See also Santoshi
Ma Vrat.
Santoshi Ma Vrat
Religious observance celebrated on
Fridays in homage to the goddess
Santoshi Ma (“the mother who satis-
fies”). This religious vow (vrat) is usually
kept by women with the aim of attaining
concrete goals for themselves or (more
commonly) their families: getting a job,
passing an exam, conceiving a child, or
arranging a marriage. When one’s wish
has been granted, a final ceremony
calls for the observant to feed eight
brahmin boys a meal of rice, yogurt, and
bananas. After this concluding rite,
one is no longer required to observe the
vow, although many women choose
to continue performing it as a means
to maintain the household’s general
good fortune.
The Santoshi Ma Vrat has become
extremely popular throughout northern
India since the late 1970s, one reason
being that it is simple and inexpensive.
On the day of the fast (upavasa) the wor-
shiper should not eat until the evening
meal, although tea and other beverages
are generally allowed. In the late after-
noon the worshiper should light a lamp
in front of a picture of Santoshi Ma, offer
her small amounts of chickpeas and raw
sugar—things that can be found in even
the poorest households—and read
aloud the rite’s charter myth, which tells
how a poor, unfortunate woman solved
all her family’s troubles through her
devotion to Santoshi Ma. After this, the
worshiper may eat the evening meal,
although it is also subject to restrictions:
Since Santoshi Ma is a goddess associat-
ed with sweetness, the food must not
contain any sour, spicy, or bitter season-
ings. This observance thus carries the
two common features of most religious
vows: some form of worship and modi-
fication of one’s diet, with the promise of
benefits in return.
[[598]]

Sanyasi
(“renunciant”) According to the dharma
literature, the last of the idealized
stages of life (ashrama) for a twice-born
man, that is a man born into the brah-
min, kshatriya, or vaishya communi-
ties. Boys born into these communities
are eligible for the adolescent religious
initiation known as the “second birth.”
After engaging in religious learning as a
celibate student (brahmacharin), mar-
rying and raising a family as a house-
holder (grhastha), and gradually detach-
ing himself from the world as a forest-
dwelling recluse (vanaprastha), a twice-
born man should finally renounce all
possessions and all attachments to
devote himself exclusively to the search
for ultimate truth. Although in a general
sense the word Sanyasi can (and some-
times does) refer to any such renun-
ciant, it is most used as the name of a
particular ascetic community, the
Dashanami Sanyasis, who are believed
to have been founded by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya, and who
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
Sanyasi Rebellion
Name given by the British to a long-term
struggle in the Bengal region in the latter
half of the eighteenth century. This was
the period in which the British East
India Company was consolidating its
economic, political, and military control
over the region, causing wide-ranging
dislocations in traditional Bengali soci-
ety. Among the entrenched powers with
which the British clashed were orga-
nized bands of soldier-ascetics, both
Hindus and Muslims. These soldier-
ascetics were significant local forces,
with both military and economic power
gained through mercenary services,
trading, and money-lending, and they
competed with the British East India
Company for political authority and
land revenue.
Conflict between the British and the
ascetics peaked shortly after the Bengal
famine of 1770–1771. The rebellion was
caused partly by competition for greatlySapindikarana
reduced agricultural revenue and by
British-sponsored changes in land own-
ership patterns, in which officials in the
East India Company replaced many of
the “unprofitable” traditional landowners
with their own Company employees.
Many of the traditional landowners
owed money to ascetic moneylenders
(Sanyasis), and had pledged their land
revenue as security. The Sanyasis were
upset when the landowners were
replaced and the debts not honored. For
their part, the Company’s officials were
reluctant to allow the ascetics, who trav-
eled in heavily armed bands, to pass
through the company’s territories while
on religious pilgrimage, as the ascetics
had traditionally done. Ultimately
the ascetic attacks were disorganized
and local, and the disparate Sanyasi
bands were unable to withstand
British resources and organization. A
fictionalized account of the Sanyasi
Rebellion appeared in the novel
Anandamath, by Bankim Chandra
Chatterjee (1838–1894), who used the
Sanyasi Rebellion as a coded call for
resistance to contemporary British rule.
Sapaksha
One of the parts of an acceptable
form of inference (anumana) in Indian
philosophy. An acceptable inference
has three terms: an assertion (pratijna),
a reason (hetu), and examples (drshtanta);
each of these three has its own con-
stituent parts. The sapaksha is part of
the third term, the examples. It is a pos-
itive example given to support the claim
made in the initial assertion, by showing
that similar things happen in compara-
ble cases. For example, in the inference,
“there is fire on the mountain, because
there is smoke on the mountain,” the
sapaksha could be “as in a kitchen,”
since this place has both fire and smoke,
and thus supports the initial assertion.
Conventionally, an inference also has to
have a negative example, to show that
the claim made in the assertion does not
happen in some other cases.
Saphala Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Paush (December–January). All the
eleventh-day observances are dedicated
to the worship of Vishnu. Most Hindu
religious festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, which usually involve fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those performing this rite
must stay up all night singing and telling
of Vishnu’s exploits. The name Saphala
means “successful,” and those who
faithfully observe this will be successful
in all their endeavors.
Sapinda
(“having a common body”) Term for
people having common ancestry, who
could thus be said to share the same
body through the ancestor. This rela-
tionship was held to cease after seven
generations on the father’s side, and
after five on the mother’s. Men and
women who were sapinda were theoret-
ically forbidden to marry, although this
prohibition has been routinely ignored
in southern India since very early times.
See also marriage prohibitions.
Sapindikarana
Funerary rite (antyeshthi samskara)
performed on the twelfth day after
death, which symbolically represents
the one-year anniversary of the death.
In this rite, the departed person is trans-
formed from a potentially dangerous
wandering spirit (pret) to a benevolent
ancestral spirit (pitr). Each day for ten
days following a person’s death, mourn-
ers leave a ball of cooked grain (pinda)
for the departed spirit. Gradually the ten
pindas “construct” a new body for the
departed person. Then sapindikarana is
performed on the twelfth day. A large
pinda, representing the departed, and
three smaller ones are collected, repre-
senting the departed’s father, grandfa-
ther, and great-grandfather. The rite’s
[[599]]
Sapindikarana

a rite often combined with the saptapadi, or the seven steps.
central moment comes when the
departed’s pinda is divided into three
parts, one part is mixed with each of the
other three pindas, and finally all three
pindas are combined into one. At the
moment the three pindas are combined,
the departed is believed to have become
one (sapindi) with his ancestors, and to
[[600]]

have been transformed from a wander-
ing spirit into an ancestor as well. This
twelfth day rite is the last of the funerary
rites performed on a strict timetable.
Mourners may wait for years before per-
forming the final rite of asthi-visarjana,
in which bone and ashes from the dead
person’s cremation pyre are immersedSaraswat
in a sacred river, although with the
advent of better transportation this is
sometimes now performed before the
twelfth day rites. In addition, people
still perform annual memorial rites for
the deceased. For an excellent account
of this rite, see David M. Knipe,
“Sapindikarana: The Hindu Rite of Entry
into Heaven,” in Frank E. Reynolds and
Earle H. Waugh (eds.), Religious
Encounters With Death, 1977.
Saptapadi
(“seven steps”) The most important rite
in the Hindu marriage ceremony, in
which the bride and groom take seven
steps together to symbolize their marital
union. The seventh step completes the
transfer of the bride from her natal fam-
ily to the groom’s family and is also the
point when the marriage becomes per-
manent. As described in the dharma lit-
erature, the bride and groom would
perform this rite by taking seven steps in
a straight line. In contemporary times
this rite is often combined with the
agnipradakshinam (“circumambulat-
ing the fire”), in which the bride and
groom make seven revolutions around a
small fire—considered to be a form of
the god Agni and thus the divine witness
to the marriage. While circling the fire,
the bride and groom are often physically
joined by tying part of his turban to the
edge of her sari as a visible sign of their
marital union.
Saptasindhu
(“seven seas”) In traditional mythic
geography, the seven oceans surround-
ing the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) that make up the visible world.
Each of these seven seas is composed of
a different substance. The ocean acces-
sible to human beings is composed of
salt water, but the oceans beyond that
are composed of sugarcane juice, wine,
ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, milk, and
sweet water. Few specific details exist
about most of these oceans, but the
Ocean of Milk has a prominent place in
Hindu mythology, since it was by churn-
ing this that the gods obtained the nec-
tar of immortality (amrta). See also
Tortoise avatar.
Sarama
In the Rg Veda, the earliest Hindu sacred
text, a servant of the storm-god Indra. In
Rg Veda 10.108, Sarama is sent as an
emissary to Indra’s enemies, the Panis,
to inquire where they have hidden the
cows they have stolen, and to threaten
them with Indra’s wrath if they do not
reveal their location.
Saraswat
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or
intermarried, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group has a monopoly. This sort of dif-
ferentiation applied even to brahmins,
whose role has been to serve as priests,
scholars, and teachers. The Saraswats
are a brahmin jati counted as one of the
five northern Indian brahmin commu-
nities (Pancha Gauda); the other four
are the Gaudas, the Kanaujias, the
Maithilas, and the Utkalas. Unlike most
other brahmin communities, which had
a well-defined core region, the Saraswats
are found in several widely separated
locations. One group lived in the
coastal region of Sindh in modern
Pakistan, although after Partition in
[[1947]]
 most of the group migrated to
Bombay. Another group was located in
prepartition Punjab, although here too
they have tended to migrate away from
the part of Punjab in modern Pakistan.
A third branch, known as the Gauda
Saraswats, is found on a narrow strip of
coastline in the southern Indian state
of Karnataka. The Saraswat communi-
ty takes its name from Saraswati,
patron goddess of speech and learning,
and, as a group, is famous for its erudi-
tion and piety.
[[601]]
Saraswati
A depiction of Saraswati, the goddess associated with art, aesthetics, learning, sacred speech, and wisdom.
Saraswati
Goddess associated with art, aesthetics,
learning, sacred speech, and wisdom.
Saraswati is the patron deity of culture
in all its manifestations. The spoken
word is considered very powerful in
Hindu culture and Saraswati can either
promote or frustrate one’s efforts by
conferring or withdrawing the ability to
[[602]]

speak clearly. Her association with
sacred speech goes back to the time of
the sacrificial manuals known as the
Brahmanas, in which the cult of sacri-
fice was based on the precise perfor-
mance of sacred speech and ritual.
Her iconography emphasizes her
connection with the life of the mind:
She holds a book, a crystal (symbolicSarmanochegas
of a purified mind), a vina (musical
instrument), and a rosary (associated
with religious rites, and particularly
with the repetition of the sacred
sounds known as mantras). Her ani-
mal vehicle is the swan, whose white
color is a symbol of purity and whose
high flight is a symbol of transcen-
dence. Through Saraswati’s blessings
(ashirvad) human beings can tran-
scend their biological condition to
create works of art and culture.
Saraswati is usually believed to be
married, although different mythic
sources give her different husbands. In
some cases she is described as the wife of
the god Brahma, the creator; here their
joint activity encompasses the formation
of the material world and its transforma-
tion through human cultural activity. In
other stories she is described as the wife
of the god Vishnu, and thus a co-wife of
Lakshmi. Here the realms of Lakshmi and
Saraswati can be seen as giving differing
messages about the “good things” in life—
while Lakshmi grants wealth and materi-
al prosperity, Saraswati brings wisdom
and culture. A popular Indian saying
reports that Saraswati’s devotee (bhakta)
will never make money, while a follower
of Lakshmi (whose vehicle is the owl) will
be “blind” to spiritual wisdom. For more
information on Saraswati and all the god-
desses of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Saraswati Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century
philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
different name—in this case, Saraswati
(the patron goddess of learning and cul-
ture). Upon initiation, new members
are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
These ten “named” divisions of
Dashanami Sanyasis are divided into
four larger organizational groups. Each
group has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya, as
well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Saraswati Dashanamis
belong to the Bhuriwara group, which is
affiliated with the Shringeri math in the
southern Indian town of Shringeri. The
Saraswati division is elite in that it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins (the other such divisions are
Ashrama, Tirtha, and part of the
Bharati order).
Saraswati River
One of the seven sacred rivers of India,
along with the Ganges, Yamuna,
Godavari, Narmada, Indus, and
Cauvery. The Saraswati is particularly
interesting because no one is sure exactly
where this river is located. A river by this
name is mentioned in the hymns of the
Vedas, the earliest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts, and thus the
Saraswati River would seem to have
been in the northeastern part of India,
in which these hymns are set. In modern
times a Saraswati River flows through
the northern Indian state of Haryana
and dries up in the desert of the state of
Rajasthan. Archaeologists have found
extensive settlements from the Indus
Valley civilization on its banks, indicat-
ing that in earlier times the river was an
active tributary of the Indus. Popular
belief holds that the Saraswati continues
to flow underground, and joins the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers at their con-
fluence in Allahabad. This reputed con-
fluence of three sacred rivers is the
source for one of the site’s names,
Triveni (“triple stream”).
Sarmanochegas
According to the Greek writer Strabo, the
name of an ascetic who was part of a
delegation sent to Athens by a king of
the Pandya dynasty, met by Augustus in
[[603]]
Sarvadarshanasangraha
Athens in 20 B.C.E. In Athens, Sarmano-
chegas, tired of a life of bondage on
earth, committed religious suicide by
burning himself on a pyre.
Sarvadarshanasangraha
(“Collection of all [philosophical]
views”) A philosophical encyclopedia
composed by Madhava in the late four-
teenth century. In this text, Madhava
compiled the views of all the existing
philosophical schools, which he placed
in hierarchical order, based on his judg-
ment of their truth value. The material-
ist schools were ranked the lowest and
least reliable since their proponents
completely denied the virtue of any reli-
gious life. After this came various
Buddhist schools, whose low standing
can be attributed to the widespread per-
ception that they were nihilists (nas-
tikas). Madhava then moves through
the various Hindu philosophical
schools, finishing with the Advaita
Vedanta school—his own—which was
judged the highest and most perfect
expression of the truth. Although the
Sarvadarshanasangraha is a polemical
text with a clear bias, it is one of the few
extant sources that considers the per-
spectives of all the existing schools.
Sarvam Idam Khalu Brahman
(“Truly, this universe is Brahman”) In
the Hindu philosophical tradition, one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing the ultimate truth, here the
sameness of the individual Self (atman)
with the Supreme Reality (Brahman).
Sarvasvara
Sacrificial rite found in the Vedas, the
oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The most notable feature
of the sarvasvara is that it involved the
suicide of the sacrificer, who concluded
the rite by entering the sacrificial fire.
The sarvasvara is an extreme example
of the class of ritual actions known as
kamya karma, which consists of
action performed solely because of the
[[604]]

performer’s desire (kama) to obtain cer-
tain benefits. This element of desire
makes kamya karma different from the
other two classes of ritual action, nitya
karma and naimittika karma, which
were each in some way obligatory. The
sarvasvara could be undertaken to obtain
any outcome, such as birth in heaven as
a god, or rebirth in a royal family. The sac-
rificer declares the benefit in the part of
the rite called the samkalpa. Although
the sarvasvara had extreme elements, it
was completely voluntary.
Sashanka
(7th c.) King of Bengal who was an
ardent devotee (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and a fierce opponent of
Buddhism, which was deeply entrenched
in his domain. According to reliable
historical reports, Sashanka not only
persecuted the Buddhists themselves
but also tried to destroy the tree in
Bodh Gaya under which the Buddha
gained enlightenment. This is one of
the few well-documented cases of reli-
gious persecution.
Sat
In Indian philosophical thought, the
most basic denotation for “that which
(really and truly) exists.” The term is a
present participle of the verb “to be,” so
a fairly common translation is “Being,”
but the word also carries connotations
relating to the idea of Truth—that things
that exist are both “real” and “true.” Sat
is the first of the three attributes tradi-
tionally ascribed to the unqualified, ulti-
mate Brahman as sacchidananda,
along with consciousness (chit) and
bliss (ananda).
Satavahana Dynasty
Central Indian dynasty whose core area
was in the Deccan plateau in the west-
ern state of Maharashtra, and whose
capital was in the city of Paithan. The
Satavahana dynasty was at its peak from
the first to the third centuries, when it
ruled an area spanning the modernSati
states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra
Pradesh. It was in the Satavahana
domains that the first cave temples were
constructed in the chaitya and vihara
architectural styles, which paved the
way for later architectural forms.
Satguru
(“true guru”) In the sant religious tradi-
tion, an epithet (label) that can refer
either to the Supreme Being or to a gen-
uinely realized religious teacher,
through whose instruction a disciple
attains the Supreme Being. The sants
were a loose group of central and north-
ern Indian poet-saints who lived
between the fifteenth and seventeenth
centuries and who shared several general
tendencies: stress on individualized
and interior religion, leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; disdain
for external ritual, particularly image
worship; faith in the power of the divine
Name; and a tendency to ignore con-
ventional caste distinctions. Many of
the sants, particularly in northern India,
thought of the divine as without quali-
ties (nirguna) and beyond human pow-
ers of conception. Given these aniconic
and occasionally iconoclastic tenden-
cies, it is not surprising that the sant tra-
dition highlights the importance of the
spiritual teacher (guru), since the guru’s
human form is the only image that a dis-
ciple has to work with. In human form,
the satguru guides the disciple’s spiritual
practice and thus becomes the vehicle
for spiritual attainment. Yet a true guru,
according to the tradition, always
remains a servant rather than a master,
maintaining and transmitting the teach-
ing of his or her particular lineage. The
sant notion of the satguru has been
adopted into many modern Hindu
movements, most notably the Radha
Soami Satsang.
Sathya Sai Baba
(b. Satya Narayana Peddi Venkappa
Raju, 1926) Modern Hindu teacher and
religious figure who presides as religious
teacher (guru) over millions of devotees
(bhakta), both Indian and foreign. He
was born in the small village of
Puttaparthi in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, where his main ashram is still
located. He first claimed to be an incar-
nation of Shirdi Sai Baba, a
Maharashtrian saint, at thirteen—a
move that gave him religious authority
and obviated the need to accept a
human guru and a spiritual lineage.
Sathya Sai Baba has since stated that he
will be reincarnated a third time, thus
eliminating awkward questions about a
successor. His fame rests upon his sup-
posed magic powers, particularly the
ability to heal and to materialize objects
from thin air. Sai Baba has many mid-
dle- and upper-class Indian devotees,
whom he obliges to perform service
(seva) to others. Some observers are
highly skeptical about his reputed pow-
ers and about Sai Baba in general. For
further information see Lawrence Babb,
“Sathya Sai Baba’s Saintly Play,” in John
Stratton Hawley (ed.), Saints and
Virtues, 1987; “Sathya Sai Baba and the
Lesson of Trust,” in Redemptive
Encounters, 1987; and “Sathya Sai Baba’s
Miracles,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
Sati
Hindu goddess, daughter of the demigod
Daksha and wife of the god Shiva, whose
death and dismemberment are pivotal
incidents in the mythology of both Shiva
and the Goddess. According to legend,
after Sati marries Shiva, her father Daksha
feels that Shiva has not shown him proper
respect and develops bad feelings toward
him. Inflated with pride, Daksha plans a
great sacrifice to which he invites all the
gods but deliberately excludes Shiva.
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she
insists that she wants to go, since it is in
her natal home. Shiva, after trying to dis-
courage her by pointing out that one
should not go without an invitation, final-
ly gives her his permission. When Sati
arrives at the sacrificial grounds and asks
[[605]]
Satkaryavada
Daksha why he has excluded her hus-
band, Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless and
despicable. Humiliated by these public
insults, Sati commits suicide—in some
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial fire,
in others by withdrawing into yogic trance
and giving up her life.
Shiva, furious at what has happened,
creates the fierce deity Virabhadra (or
in some versions, Virabhadra and the
fierce goddess Bhadrakali), and dis-
patches them to destroy Daksha’s sacri-
fice. They gleefully carry out his com-
mand, scattering the guests and killing
Daksha. The resulting carnage ends only
when the assembled gods praise Shiva
as the supreme deity. Daksha is eventu-
ally restored to life with the head of a
goat, and he too repents his arrogance
and worships Shiva. At Daksha’s request,
Shiva agrees to remain at the sacrificial
site forever and sanctify it. Shiva takes
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form, and can
still be seen at the Daksha Mahadev
temple in the town of Kankhal.
Although Shiva’s anger has been
pacified by this worship, he is disconso-
late at Sati’s death and wanders the
earth carrying her body on his shoul-
ders. In his grief, Shiva neglects his
divine functions, and the world begins
to fall into ruin. The gods, concerned
over the world’s imminent destruction,
go to the god Vishnu for help. Vishnu
then follows behind Shiva and uses his
razor-sharp discus to gradually cut away
pieces of Sati’s body, until finally there is
nothing left. When the body is com-
pletely gone, Shiva leaves for the moun-
tains, where he remains absorbed in
meditation until it is broken by Kama.
Sati is reborn as the goddess Parvati and
later remarries Shiva.
The myth connected with the figure
of Sati is important for several reasons.
First, it provides the charter myth for the
Shakti Pithas (“bench of the Goddess”),
a network of sites sacred to the Goddess
that spreads throughout the subconti-
nent. Each of these Shakti Pithas—
in some lists there are fifty-one, and in
[[606]]

others 108—marks the site where a part
of Sati’s body fell to earth, taking form
there as a different goddess. These
differing goddesses, spread all over the
subcontinent, are thus seen as manifes-
tations of this one primordial goddess,
united by the symbolism of the human
body. Aside from establishing this network,
the myth has several other important
messages: It graphically illustrates the
supremacy of devotion (in this case, to
Shiva) over the older sacrificial cult; it
illustrates some of the tensions in the
joint family, in which women feel the
conflict of loyalty between their natal
and their marital homes; and it is the
charter myth for the Daksha Mahadev
temple in the town of Kankhal, just
south of the sacred city of Haridwar,
where Daksha’s sacrifice is claimed to
have taken place. See also pitha.
Satkaryavada
One of the three causal models in Indian
philosophy, along with asatkaryavada
and anekantavada. All three models seek
to explain the relationship between causes
and their effects in the everyday world,
which has profound implications for reli-
gious life. All the philosophical schools
assume that if one understands the causal
process correctly, and can manipulate it
through one’s conscious actions, it is possi-
ble to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Thus, disagreements over dif-
ferent causal models are not merely acade-
mic disputes but are grounded in basically
different assumptions about the nature of
things. The satkaryavada model assumes
that effects preexist in their causes, which
can thus be seen as transformations (real
or apparent) of those causes. The classic
example is the transformation of milk to
curds, butter, and clarified butter.
According to satkaryavada proponents,
each of these effects was already present in
the cause, and emerges from it through a
natural transformation of that cause.
This causal model tends to reduce the
number of causes in the universe, since
anything can be seen as a transforma-
tion of other things. Given these strongSatsang
Women singing hymns at a neighborhood temple during a satsang in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
relationships, if one can understand how
these relationships work, they can be
manipulated to one’s advantage. The dis-
advantage of this model is that it can lead
to fatalism. In a world in which everything
occurs through natural transformation, it
can seem as if the universe is running
under its own power, and that human
actions may not be able to influence such
strong relationships. The philosophical
schools espousing this model are the
Samkhyas, proponents of Bhedabhada,
Ramanuja’s Vishishthadvaita Vedanta,
and the various branches of Advaita
Vedanta. The first three believe that the
difference between cause and effect is a
genuine transformation of the cause,
whereas the Advaita school stresses that
this transformation is only apparent, and
that the real source of bondage (and liber-
ation) lies in avidya, the fundamental lack
of understanding that causes one to mis-
perceive the nature of things. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.), Pre-
suppositions of India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Satkhyati
(“discrimination of the real”) Theory of
error propounded by Ramanuja, the
eleventh century philosopher who was
the founder of Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta. This theory is also known as
yathakhyati (“discrimination [of things]
as they are”). All the theories of error aim
to explain why people make errors in
judgment, the stock example being mis-
taking the silvery flash of sea shell for a
piece of silver. Ramanuja’s analysis is
based on the understanding that all
things are composed of the five ele-
ments, and that the different propor-
tions of the elements account for their
differences. The viewer is correct in per-
ceiving the silvery flash, since this is a
property shared by both shell and silver.
The error comes in supposing that the
object is silver—that is, taking the part
of the judgment that is true, and making
an incorrect assumption based on that.
As for some of the other theories, the
ultimate reason one “sees” silver and
not other silvery things comes from
karmic dispositions stemming from
avidya, specifically the greed for silver
that prompts us to look for such items of
value. For further information see
Bijayananda Kar, Theories of Error in
Indian Philosophy, 1978; Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s Philo-
sophies, 1972.
Satsang
(“company of the good”) Quasi-con-
gregational meeting and worship that
was particularly emphasized in devo-
tional (bhakti) religious life as a way to
[[607]]
Sattan
associate with fellow devotees (bhakta).
The word covers an enormous range of
activities and contexts, from an informal
gathering for singing and conversation
in someone’s home, to highly orches-
trated meetings in which a guru may
preach to thousands of devotees, and
anything in between. In all these cases
the importance of satsang lies in the
wholesome religious atmosphere gener-
ated by the presence of good people,
which is believed to create beneficial
effects in terms of reinforcing one’s own
good qualities and reforming one’s
faults.
Sattan
(7th c.) Tamil poet who was the author
of the Manimegalai, a text that
was clearly written as a sequel to the
earlier poem “The Jeweled Anklet”
(Shilappadigaram). Sattan’s story
focuses on a young woman named
Manimegalai, who was wooed by the
local prince but eventually became a
Buddhist nun. Although the story’s bias
clearly favors the Buddhists, the
Manimegalai has numerous debates
with people from competing religious
traditions, thus giving a rounded if
somewhat subjective picture of contem-
porary religious life. See also Tamil epics
and Tamil language.
Sattva
(“goodness”) One of the three funda-
mental qualities (gunas) believed to
be present in all things. The other two
gunas are rajas (“passion”) and tamas
(“darkness”). According to this model,
the differing proportions of these
qualities account for the differences
between the properties of concrete
things, and in individual human
capacities and tendencies. Of the
three, sattva is invariably positive and
carries associations with goodness,
truth, wholesomeness, health, cogni-
tive thought, and deep-rooted reli-
gious life. The notion of these three
gunas originated in the metaphysics of
[[608]]

the Samkhya school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. Although much of Samkhya
metaphysics connected with the
gunas have been long discredited, the
idea of the gunas and their qualities
has become a pervasive assumption in
Indian culture.
Saturday
(Shanivar) The sixth day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is Saturn
(Shani). Saturn is by far the most feared
of all the planets, and Saturday is con-
sidered by far the most inauspicious day
of the week. In Hindu iconography,
Saturn is depicted as a terrifying black
figure holding a sword and riding a buf-
falo; he is also considered easily affront-
ed and extremely thorough in avenging
any offenses. Any misfortune Saturn
brings will last for fourteen years—a fig-
ure doubtless drawn from the fourteen
years of Saturn’s orbit.
Hindus counter this danger by avoid-
ance and rites of protection, just as they
do on Tuesday, the other day consid-
ered to be generally inauspicious.
Movements and activities are often
widely restricted on Saturday, and cer-
tain activities, in particular buying
things made from iron (whose black
color is associated with Saturn), are
avoided except when absolutely neces-
sary. As on Tuesday, people worship
protective deities and give as charity
(dana) items associated with Saturn:
iron, mustard oil, black sesame seed,
black cloth, and black lentils. Giving
away such items associated with Saturn
is believed to transfer any potential
inauspiciousness from Saturn to the
recipient, providing a way to get rid of
one’s bad luck.
Saturn
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a
strongly malevolent planet associated
with obstruction and death. Saturn’s
power and malevolent nature make
him extremely dangerous, particularlySatyavan
since any misfortune he brings will
last for fourteen years—a figure
doubtless drawn from the fourteen
years of Saturn’s orbit. During the
week Saturn presides over Saturday,
considered by far the most inauspi-
cious day of the week. On this day
people refrain from numerous activi-
ties and also commonly perform rites
of protection, such as giving alms
(dana) as a way to give away any
potential misfortune.
Satyabhama
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives
of the god Krishna, when he has
assumed his kingly station as the
ruler of Dwaraka.
Satyakama
(“He whose desire is truth”) Legendary
figure in the early speculative text
Chandogya Upanishad, renowned for
his adherence to the truth. Desiring to
take initiation as a celibate student
(brahmacharin), Satyakama asks his
mother about his extended family, so
that he can have this information to give
his teacher. His mother Jabala replies
that she does not know who his father is
and tells him to take her name, and call
himself Satyakama Jabala. Satyakama,
when asked by his teacher Gautama to
tell about his family roots, tells the
whole story. Impressed by his honesty,
Gautama initiates him at once. This
story is often cited in modern times, to
emphasize the importance of one’s
actions over one’s birth.
Satyagraha
(“Holding Fast to the Truth”)
Organized campaign of nonviolent
resistance or non-cooperation as a
political tool, a technique best refined
by Mohandas K. Gandhi. For Gandhi
himself, the basis of this technique
was rooted in his commitment to the
truth and his conviction that his oppo-
nents could be swayed by the power of
truth, if it was put before them.
Gandhi’s satyagraha campaigns would
begin by publicly pointing out the
injustice in question, in the hope that
this alone could lead to the matter
being rectified. If nothing was done, a
campaign would then begin, but the
adversary would always be informed
of what was to happen next. The real
goal was not to humble the adversary
but to persuade the other party to see
the rightness of one’s position and to
accept it. The most important thing of
all was to retain one’s own commit-
ment to the truth and never to com-
promise it, even if doing so could gain
one some immediate advantage. For
Gandhi, in the end the truth was the
only thing that mattered, and winning
or losing could only be measured inso-
far as one kept this in perspective.
Satyanarayan Vrat
Religious observance that may be
observed any day of the month but is
most commonly performed on the day
of the full moon. The presiding deity is
Vishnu, worshiped in his form as
Satyanarayan (“Lord of Truth”). The rite
is believed to destroy evil and to pro-
mote the prosperity of its sponsors
(those who hire a brahmin to perform
the rite), its performers, and even its
hearers. The rite’s major features involve
modification of diet and worship, the
two general characteristics of most
Hindu religious observances. On the day
this rite is performed, the observant
must keep a strict fast (upavasa) until
the ceremony is over. A pavilion is pre-
pared in which an image of Satya-
narayan is installed and worshiped (part
of the worship includes reading the rite’s
charter myth), and after which prasad is
given to all those present.
Satyavan
In Hindu mythology, the husband of
Savitri, a woman famous both for her
devotion to her husband and for her
cleverness in outwitting Death to regain
her husband after he dies.
[[609]]
Satyavati
Satyavati
In Hindu mythology, the mother of the
sage Vyasa. Satyavati is born in an
unusual way. Her mother, a celestial
nymph who lives as a fish in the
Ganges as the result of a curse, one
day swallows some semen that has
fallen into the Ganges, becomes preg-
nant, and delivers a son and a daugh-
ter. Satyavati grows into a beautiful
young woman, but because of her ori-
gins she always smells of fish, and
because of this is also called
Matsyagandhi (“fish-scent”). She
works ferrying passengers across the
Ganges and one day ferries the sage
Parashara, who is struck by her
charms. Parashara creates an artificial
fog to give the two of them privacy, has
sexual relations with her, and grants
that from that day onward Satyavati
will smell of musk instead of fish. The
son born of this union is Vyasa.
Satyavati continues to ply her trade,
and one day ferries King Shantanu, who
is also struck by her beauty. Before she
will marry him she demands that her sons
will rule Shantanu’s kingdom. Shantanu
agrees; and to give her absolute certainty,
his son Bhishma takes a vow that he will
never marry, so that his line will never
compete with hers. Satyavati has two
sons: Chitrangada dies in childhood, and
Vichitravirya dies after he marries the
princesses Ambika and Ambalika but
before having any children. In despera-
tion, Satyavati thinks of her first son
Vyasa, who conceives a son with each of
the wives: Pandu from Ambalika, and
Dhrtarashtra from Ambika. The descen-
dants of these two sons are the warring
families
in
the
Sanskrit epic
Mahabharata, of which Vyasa is famed as
the narrator.
Saumya
(“mild”) Term used to refer to the
deities in their benevolent, beneficent,
and gentle manifestations, as opposed
to their terrifying (ghora) manifesta-
tions. This distinction is particularly
applicable to Shiva and the Goddess,
[[610]]

both of whom can appear in either
form and whose worship can focus on
either aspect.
Saundaryalahari
(“waves of beauty”) Poetic text dedicat-
ed to the praise of the Goddess as the
supreme power in the universe. The text
is traditionally ascribed to the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya, who is also
believed to have written other hymns in
praise of Hindu gods and goddesses,
despite being the greatest exponent of
the philosophical school known as
Advaita Vedanta, in which the Supreme
Reality, called Brahman, is believed to
be completely devoid of specific attrib-
utes. If Shankaracharya did in fact
author these poetic texts, one possible
explanation is that Shankaracharya was
an intensely religious man and
expressed this devotion in various ways.
The text has been an enormously influ-
ential, particularly in those schools of
tantra (a secret, ritually based religious
practice) in which the Goddess is con-
sidered the single Ultimate Reality.
Savaiya
Syllabic meter in Hindi poetry, com-
posed of four lines of between twenty-
two and twenty-six syllables each. Its
loose form gives the poet some flexibility,
but the challenges of working with such
an extended meter place considerable
demands on the poet’s skill, making this
one of the more “literary” meters.
Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar
(1883–1966) Hindu nationalist leader
and thinker whose ideas have had last-
ing influence. Savarkar spent his entire
life opposing British rule, often by violent
means. He was also virulently opposed to
Muslims, whom he saw as invaders and
intruders in the Indian homeland. After
being expelled from college for organizing
a political rally, he spent four years in
London, where he and his compatriots
learned bomb-making and planned
political assassinations. In 1911 he wasSavitr
the Hindus were a nation, despite all of
their differences—social, regional, cul-
tural, linguistic, and religious—because
for them India was their motherland,
fatherland, and holy land. He called on
Hindus to transcend the particular iden-
tities that divided them and to gain
strength through unity to resist the
oppression of outsiders. Sarvarkar’s for-
mulation equates Hinduism and Indian
nationalism and thus marginalizes both
Muslims and Christians as “outsiders.”
His ideas profoundly influenced Dr.
K. B. Hedgewar, founder of the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
The RSS and its affiliates have continued
to stress some of Savarkar’s ideas, which,
during the 1990s, have gained a national
audience with the rise of the RSS-affiliated
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). For further
information see Lise McKean, Divine
Enterprise, 1996; and Christophe
Jaffrelot, The Hindu Nationalist Movement

sentenced to life imprisonment in the
Andaman Islands but was released
because of political pressure in 1924,
although he was barred from politics
until 1937. In the time after that he
served for seven years as president of
the Hindu Mahasabha, until failing
health finally forced him to resign.
Throughout his life he had sharp differ-
ences with Mohandas Gandhi, first
over the latter’s commitment to nonvi-
olence and later over the partition of
India, which Savarkar characterized as
the “vivisection” of the Indian mother-
land. Savarkar was brought to trial
when Gandhi was assassinated by one
of his former associates, Nathuram
Godse. Savarkar was acquitted, but the
accusation had a negative affect on the
rest of his life.
Savarkar’s keynote work, Hindutva ,
was composed and committed to mem-
ory while he was imprisoned in the
Andamans. His central thesis was that
Savikalpika
(“with conceptions”) In certain schools
of Indian philosophy—among some
Buddhists, the Nyayas, and the
Prabhakara school of Mimamsa—a
term referring to complex conceptual
knowledge in which the mind puts
together and interprets data from the
senses or from memory. Since such
knowledge involves the activity of the
mind, it is susceptible to error. The
opposite sort of knowledge, called
nirvikalpaka, nonconceptual aware-
ness, is produced directly by the opera-
tion of the senses without any interpre-
tation. According to these schools, if the
senses producing this awareness have
no defect, such an awareness is true.
Savitr
(“generator”) Epithet of Surya, the sun,
in his aspect as the progenitor and nour-
isher of all things. This particular name
appears in the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred
formula whose daily recitation is
required of all twice-born men.
[[611]]
Savitri
According to the dharma literature, a
twice-born man was one born into the
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya com-
munities, who was thus eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” See Surya.
Savitri
In Indian culture, a mythic figure and
the model for a virtuous and faithful
wife, who by her cleverness is able to
rescue her husband Satyavan from the
clutches of Death himself. Before Savitri
is betrothed to Satyavan, she has been
told that he will die within a year. Savitri
replies that she has chosen him for her
husband and will not be deterred. On
the day that he is fated to die, Satyavan
goes to the forest to cut wood, accompa-
nied by Savitri. After Satyavan falls
unconscious while working, Savitri sees
Yama, the god of Death, draw out
Satyavan’s soul and start his journey
back to the underworld. Savitri follows
them. When Yama tells her that she can-
not follow where they are going, she
meekly replies that it is her wifely duty
to follow her husband. Yama grants her
some wishes, although she is forbidden
to ask for her husband’s life. Savitri first
requests that her blind father-in-law
shall regain his sight, then that he shall
regain the kingdom from which he has
been exiled, and finally that she shall
have many sons. All of these requests
are granted, and when she points out
that the return of her husband will be
necessary for her to have many sons,
Yama acknowledges that he has been
outwitted, and leaves the two of them to
many happy years together.
ensure them a long married life. As a
woman whose entire energies were
directed toward the well-being of her
family, Savitri is a cultural model for
Indian women; her ability to save her hus-
band from death demonstrates her virtue
and cleverness as well. Women observing
this rite worship Savitri, Satyavan, and
Yama; keep a strict fast (upavasa) before
the worship; and after worship eat only
fruit for the rest of the day.
Sayana
(14th c.) A southern Indian brahmin
scholar most famous for his commen-
taries on the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts.
Sayana’s commentary is notable, in part
because it is an outstanding scholarly
work, but also because this is generally
believed to be the first time that the Veda
was ever written down, an estimated
three thousand years after some of the
hymns were composed. Part of Sayana’s
commentary was simply explanatory
because, in the time since the Vedas had
been composed, the meanings of many
of the words had been forgotten.
Sayana’s text is noted as a careful and
credible clarification of the text.
Sculpture
Branch of the visual arts most important
in Hindu religion for its use as
decoration in architecture and in the
construction of images of Hindu deities
for worship. Both these sculptural forms
were regulated by precisely defined
canons. See also shilpa shastra.
Seasons
Savitri Puja
Religious observance on the new moon in
the lunar month of Jyeshth (May–June),
celebrating the virtue of Savitri, who res-
cued her husband Satyavan from the
clutches of Yama, the god of Death. This
observance is usually kept only by
women, to promote the health and
longevity of their husbands, and thus
[[612]]

According to the most traditional enu-
meration, there are six seasons, each
spanning two lunar months: Vasanta
(spring) in the lunar months of Chaitra
and Baisakh; Grishma (hot season) in
Jyeshth and Ashadh; Varsha (rains) in
Shravan and Bhadrapada; Sharad (fall)
in Ashvin and Kartik; Hemanta (winter)
in Margashirsha and Paush; andSelf-Residence
Shishira (late winter) in Magh and
Phalgun. In actual practice, there are
three major seasons, at least in northern
India: the hot season (April–June), the
monsoon ( July–September), and the
cool season (October–March). All these
seasons are approximate, because they
are ultimately determined by larger cli-
matic phenomena. In the hot season the
sun bakes the northern Indian plains,
eventually setting in motion air currents
that suck moist air north from the
Indian ocean; the resulting monsoons
break the heat and provide rain for the
crops. The weather then gets gradually
cooler until January, when it becomes
gradually hotter until the hot season
returns. The monsoon arrives at differ-
ent times in different parts of the coun-
try—earlier to regions further south,
later to regions further north—and at
times the monsoons are sporadic or do
not come at all. Each of these three sea-
sons has general correlations with cer-
tain festivals.
The hot season is a time of gradually
increasing heat, and many of the festi-
vals during this time have associations
with heat: Holi, Navaratri, Ram
Navami, Shitalashtami, and Ganga
Dashahara. Although the rising heat
can make life difficult, it is considered a
generally auspicious time.
The rainy season is a time of both
physical and ritual danger. The sudden
influx of rain drives venomous animals
such as snakes and scorpions from their
holes, and their search for other habita-
tions often brings them into contact with
human beings. On a bacteriological level,
the runoff from the rains often leads to
the contamination of water supplies by
sewage and to a sharp rise in sickness and
death from gastrointestinal ailments, as
well as other infections. On the ritual
level, the gods are considered to be sleep-
ing during part of the rainy season and
thus less available to protect their devo-
tees (bhakta). At the same time, the com-
ing of the rains is greatly anticipated, and
the moisture is essential for crops to grow.
Consequently, although this is a time of
great fertility and abundance, it is also
associated with danger, and some of the
festivals are rites of protection: Nag
Panchami, Raksha Bandhan, Ganesh
Chaturthi, Anant Chaturdashi, and the
Pitrpaksha. Other ceremonies are associ-
ated with water or with the rains, such as
the Shravan festival and Janmashtami.
In the cool season the gods awaken
from their sleep, and crops that have been
fed by the rains are ready for harvest. This
is the most ritually active time of the year,
and is generally auspicious. Major festivals
include the fall Navaratri, ending with the
festival of Dussehra (Vijaya Dashami),
Diwali, Karva Chauth, Kartik Purnima,
Makara Sankranti, and Shivaratri. The
last major festival of the year is Holi, which
marks the unofficial beginning of the hot
season. In ending with Holi, a festival cel-
ebrating license, excess, and the dissolu-
tion of all social boundaries, followed by
an abrupt reestablishment of propriety
and social order, the lunar year thus mir-
rors the cycle of the cosmos, which is sub-
ject to degeneration and periodic renewal.
Seed Syllable
A syllable, or set of syllables, that are
believed to have an intimate connection
with a deity—either as a way of gaining
access to the deity’s power or as the sub-
tlest form of the deity itself. They are
seed syllables in that they contain the
deity in its briefest form, just as a seed
contains the potential for a plant. These
seed syllables are called bijaksharas.
See bijakshara.
Self-Residence
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies
in constructing an argument. Self-
residence occurs when the cause and
effect are believed to be the same thing.
Although the simplest forms of this
fallacy are almost never found, since
it is so patently unconvincing, one does
find extended forms of it, such as recip-
rocal dependence, vicious circle, and
infinite regress.

Self-Revealing Knowledge
Self-Revealing KnowledgeSen
In Indian philosophy, the notion
that certain things, such as knowledge,
are self-revealing and do not need
proof or substantiation to be known.
Whether such knowledge (or things)
exists, and what they would be if
they did, was a source of lively
disagreement among Indian thinkers.
See svaprakasha.(15th c.) Poet and saint of the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba. According to tradition, Sen was
a barber—a very low-caste occupa-
tion—at the court of the king of Bidar.
Sen renounced this occupation to wan-
der and sing Vithoba’s praises. Little is
known about him, but he is mentioned
as a model of devotion in one of the
hymns by the northern Indian poet-
saint Ravidas, which indicates that he
was well known outside Maharashtra.
For traditional hagiography, see Justin
Abbott and Narhar R. Godbole, Stories of
Indian Saints, 1988.
Self-Validating Knowledge
In Indian philosophy, a name denoting
a sort of knowledge believed to carry
its own stamp of truth, which does
not need to be verified by anything
outside itself. See svatahpramanya.
Semen
As with all bodily fluids, semen is consid-
ered to make a person ritually impure
through emission or contact, although it is
obviously necessary for procreation,
which is an auspicious event. Semen is
also considered the concentrated essence
of a man’s vital energy, distilled drop by
drop from his blood; in Hindu mythology
the semen from the gods is portrayed as
having wondrous generative powers, as in
the story of the god Skanda, who sponta-
neously developed when the god Shiva’s
semen fell on the ground. Although a mar-
ried man is obliged to have intercourse
with his wife at certain times during her
menstrual cycle, this is also seen as a
potentially dangerous depletion of his
vital energy. Since in Indian culture
women are seen as having stronger sex
drives than men, men are faced with the
constant demand on their resources,
which must be carefully husbanded to
maintain their vitality. This problem of
depletion is particularly pronounced in
the unusual case when a man is younger
than his wife, for in that case her needs are
believed to be far greater than his capaci-
ty. Because all seminal emission depletes
one’s vital forces, there are strict taboos on
masturbation, which is seen not only as an
abject surrender to one’s baser instincts,
but as posing actual physical danger.

Sen, Keshub Chander
(d. 1884) Reformist Hindu and leader of
the Brahmo Samaj, to which he gave most
of his life. His emphases on the ideal of eth-
ical monotheism and rejection of many rit-
uals were heavily influenced by English
Unitarianism. In 1865, the Samaj split over
Keshub’s insistence that members should
no longer wear the sacred thread. Then in
[[1878]]
 Keshub had an inexplicable lapse in
principles when he arranged for the mar-
riage of his thirteen year-old daughter.
Most of his followers left him in protest,
and he spent his remaining years creating
what he called the New Dispensation, a
new religion using elements drawn from
various religious traditions. At his death he
had few followers but had been influential
through his earlier efforts to reform Hindu
society, and to look critically at Christian
culture and religion. In his curiosity for reli-
gious ideas, he happened to meet the
Bengali mystic Ramakrishna, and it was
through association with Keshub that
Ramakrishna began to attract disciples
from Calcutta’s middle class, most notably
Narendranath Datta, who became famous
as Swami Vivekananda.

whose ancestral homeland was in the
Bengal region but whose territory alsoSevagram

included the western part of the state of
Bihar. The Senas were originally vassals
of the Pala dynasty but became inde-
pendent in 1097 and later seized much
of the Pala domain in Bihar. The Sena
dynasty survived until 1245, when it was
finally conquered by the Mamluks, who
had been seizing Sena territory since the
beginning of that century. The Senas
(and their predecessors, the Palas) are
particularly noted for a certain type of
sculpture in which the images were
carved from black chlorite schist that
was polished to a mirror finish.
Setubandha
(“Building the Bridge”) Early medieval
poem whose theme is taken from the
epic Ramayana and describes Rama’s
invasion of Lanka by building a bridge
across the ocean straits. The poem is
written in Prakrit, an umbrella term for
the grammatically simpler vernacular
languages that developed from Sanskrit
through natural linguistic change. The
poem has been falsely ascribed to
Kalidasa, the greatest Sanskrit poet. The
true author is unknown.
Seva
(“service”) Actions springing from an
attitude of loving devotion, manifested
as attendance on and service to a deity,
religious teacher (guru), or any superior
person. The notion of seva is particularly
important in the relationship between
religious teacher and disciple. The
teacher’s task is to further the disciple’s
spiritual development, which may
sometimes entail harsh criticism to
reform some of the disciple’s faults. The
ideal disciple will accept such direction
in a spirit of self-effacement and carry
out the teacher’s instructions faithfully
and without protest, as a sign of submis-
sion and service. Such arrangements are
often necessary for spiritual growth, and
a teacher can often give a much more
objective assessment of the disciple’s
true spiritual state and what must be
done for advancement. Still, when one
of the parties is not sincere, this model
has great potential for abuse. In such
circumstances the teacher’s call for obe-
dience and service—in which any “resis-
tance” to the teacher’s demands can be
cited as a sign of spiritual immaturity—
can be a way to take advantage of a
devotee (bhakta).
Sevagram
(“service village”) City in the eastern
part of the state of Maharashtra about
fifty miles south and west of Nagpur. It
is most famous for the ashram estab-
lished there by Mohandas K. Gandhi in
[[1933]]
, which was founded to promote his
[[615]]
Seven Sacred Cities
ideal of a decentralized village economy.
This economic model had political
and cultural symbolism, since it was
independent of the industrialized econ-
omy run by the British and intended to
counterbalance it by providing a model
of an economy based on indigenous
“Hindu” values.
Seven Sacred Cities
Seven sacred cities (tirthas) spread
throughout the Indian subcontinent
in which death is traditionally
believed to bring final liberation of the
soul (moksha). The seven cities are
Ayodhya,
Mathura,
Haridwar,
Benares, Kanchipuram, Ujjain, and
Dwaraka.
Shabara
In the Purva Mimamsa school of
Hindu philosophy Shabara was the
author of the earliest and most famous
commentary on Jaimini’s Mimamsa
Sutras, the school’s founding text. The
commentary is called Shabara-
bhashya. The date of the text is highly
uncertain, and estimates range from
the first century B.C.E. to the fourth or
sixth century C.E. As often happens,
later commentators have accepted
Shabara’s commentary as part of the
text itself and commented on it as well
as on the original sutras.
Shabarabhashya
(“Shabara’s commentary”) Extensive
commentary on the Mimamsa Sutras
of Jaimini, the founding text of the
Purva Mimamsa school of philoso-
phy. The date of the text is uncertain.
It is believed to have been written by
Shabara in either the first century
B. C . E ., or the fourth or sixth century
C . E . As often happens, later commen-
tators have accepted Shabara’s com-
mentary as part of the text itself and
commented on it as well as on the
original sutras.
[[616]]

Shabari
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, a tribal woman
who is a sincere devotee (bhakta) of
the god Rama. Shabari belongs to a
group known as the Shabaras, and so
her name conveys a sense of anonymi-
ty, since it is simply the feminine form
of the group’s name. Rama and
Lakshmana stop for some time at
Shabari’s dwelling during their search
for Rama’s kidnapped wife Sita.
Although as a tribal she has very low
social status, Rama graciously receives
her hospitality as a reward for the
devotion with which it is given. In the
Ramcharitmanas , the vernacular
retelling of the Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
Shabari tastes each fruit before she
gives it to Rama, to be sure that he will
get only the very sweetest—an act that
violates one of the most pervasive rit-
ual taboos barring the exchange of any
food that has come into contact with
saliva, and particularly from lower to
higher status people. Yet in the story
Rama eats the fruits very happily
because of the love with which they
are given. The message in this episode
is consistent with a primary theme in
the Ramcharitmanas, namely, the
power of devotion to override or over-
turn conventional social norms. Soon
after Rama and Lakshmana’s visit,
Shabari dies a happy death.
Shabari Malai
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
hills of the southern state of Kerala,
about seventy miles north of Trivan-
drum. Shabari Malai is renowned for the
temple to Aiyappa, a regional divinity
who has been assimilated into the larger
pantheon as the son of the gods Vishnu
and Shiva; he is born when Vishnu takes
the form of the enchantress Mohini.
Shabari Malai’s annual month-long pil-
grimage occurs from the middle of
December to the middle of January, with
the exact dates determined by astrologi-
cal calculations.Shaiva
This pilgrimage is most often taken
by men, since, according to the charter
myth, the site is forbidden to women
of childbearing age. The pilgrimage
itself is a highly structured ritual
process. Pilgrims carry out their spiri-
tual training for the journey in well-
defined village groups, each headed by
a local leader, who supervises their
strict religious discipline. Their
preparatory vows commence forty-five
to sixty days before the actual journey
begins, and entail strict celibacy and
avoiding the company of women, dis-
tinctive dress, a ban on shaving and
wearing shoes, a strict vegetarian diet,
daily worship, and the erasing of all
social and status distinctions among
members. In essence, the men training
for this pilgrimage live as renunciant
ascetics for this period and later revert
to their normal identities. The pilgrim-
age itself is an arduous and exhausting
journey over the twisted ridges of the
Periyar Hills, during which pilgrims
symbolically divest themselves of their
egos, to be filled with the grace of God.

Shabari Malai pilgrimage, see E.

heavens, the course of the soul after
death, proper religious life, and so
forth. With regard to the liberation of
the soul, it is often the most important
pramana, since this cannot be discov-
ered in any other way.
Shabdabrahman
(“Brahman-as-sound”) This term
refers to the notion that the Supreme
Reality (Brahman) exists in its most
subtle form, not as matter, but as
sound. This idea is particularly preva-
lent in tantra, a secret, ritually based
system of religious practice, and helps
to explain the tantric stress on
mantra, or sacred sound, as the essen-
tial means through which one gains
access to this reality. In this under-
standing, the primary mantra (mula-
mantra) of one’s particular deity
would be the clearest articulation of
shabdabrahman, with other mantras
conceived as derivative forms of
that primary mantra; these latter
mantras were the source for everyday
speech and the mundane sounds of
ordinary experience.
Shachi
Shabda
(“word”) In Indian philosophy, the
general term for authoritative testimo-
ny. This is generally accepted as one of
the pramanas, the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge, except by the materi-
alists, who reject all pramanas except
perception
(pratyaksha).
Such
authoritative testimony is of two sorts.
It most often refers to authoritative
scriptural texts, such as the Vedas, but
it can also refer to verbal instruction
given by one’s guru, which is consid-
ered to have equal authority, at least
by members of that spiritual lineage.
Shabda is an important pramana
because it tells people about those
things that the other pramanas cannot
uncover, such as the nature of the
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the god
Indra, also known as Indrani. See
Indrani.
Shaddarshana
(“six perspectives”) Collective name for
the six schools of classical Hindu phi-
losophy. These six were usually grouped
in three pairs: Nyaya and Vaisheshika,
Samkhya and Yoga, and Purva Mim-
amsa and Vedanta. See six schools.
Shaiva
Devotee (bhakta) of the Hindu
god Shiva, who along with Vishnu is
one of the major figures in the
Hindu pantheon. From the evidence at
hand, it seems that the earliest
sectarian
Shaivites
were
the
Kapalikas,
Kalamukhas,
and
[[617]]
Shaiva Nagas
Pashupatas. All three of these were
communities of renunciant ascetics,
perhaps to accord with the example
set by their patron deity. The informa-
tion for all three must be reconstruct-
ed, since the sects have all disap-
peared. Shaivas can still be found in
ascetic life in the Dashanami Sanyasis
and the Nathpanthis, two living
ascetic communities. The major cur-
rent through which Shaiva devotional-
ism (bhakti) came into mainstream
society was through the devotional
hymns of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three poet-saints who lived in
southern India in the seventh and
eighth centuries. Their passionate
devotion, conveyed in hymns in the
Tamil language, was later system-
atized into the southern Indian philo-
sophical school known as Shaiva
Siddhanta. As the bhakti movement
moved northward, it found Shaiva
expression in the Lingayat community
in modern Karnataka, as well as the
Krama and Trika schools of Kashmiri
Shaivism. Shaivism has had a long
association with tantra, a secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice, and the
influence of tantra is evident in the
Kashmiri schools as well as in the doc-
trines of the Nathpanthi ascetics.
Shaivism does not show the bewil-
dering sectarian variety characterizing
Vaishnavas, devotees of the god
Vishnu, and Shaivites tend to be less
strict about membership in a particular
sect. Nevertheless, Shiva has millions
of devotees in modern India, and a well-
established network of pilgrimage
places (tirtha), particularly in the
Himalayas.
Shaiva Nagas
Naga (“naked,” i.e., fighting) ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akha-
ras or regiments on the model of an
army. The other major Naga division
was the Bairagi Nagas, who were
devotees of the god Vishnu. Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century
[[618]]

the Nagas’ primary occupation was as
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests. Such
resources allowed many Naga leaders
to become rich and powerful men
despite often coming from lower
social strata, and in earlier times such
opportunities would have made a
career as a Naga an attractive proposi-
tion for an ambitious young man. Both
these sources of income have largely
disappeared in contemporary times,
although some Naga communities are
still landowners with extensive prop-
erties and thus both rich and influen-
tial. See also shaiva.
Shaiva Siddhanta
Southern Indian religious community
that was particularly developed in the
Tamil country, and whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. Shaiva Siddhanta is based on a
series of fourteen texts, all completed
by the fourteenth century C . E ., in
which the ideas about Shiva found in
Sanskrit texts were reinterpreted in
light of the devotional faith of the
Nayanars. The Nayanars were a group
of sixty-three poet-saints who lived in
southern India in the seventh and
eighth centuries. The most famous
and influential of these interpreters
was
the
ninth-century
poet
Manikkavachakar. Central to Shaiva
Siddhanta is the triad of Shiva as the
“Lord” (pati), human souls held in
bondage (pashu), and the “bonds”
(pasha) holding these souls. Shiva is
conceived as the supreme divinity,
who wields the bonds of maya, or illu-
sion, to keep souls in bondage. Yet he
is also pictured as gracious and loving
to his devotees, a far cry from the
capricious and somewhat dangerous
figure in his earliest mythology. As the
supreme lord, Shiva is the source of all
spiritual illumination and energy, and
also the power through which the
world is created, sustained, and reab-
sorbed again. Souls are conceived as
different from Shiva, since they areShakha
subject to imperfections, although
here too his power is their
ultimate source. The only path to
liberation is devotion to Shiva,
through whose grace the bonds of
maya can be broken or transcended.
Even after liberation souls remain dis-
tinct from Shiva, although they remain
in his presence. For further informa-
tion see M. Dhavamony, Love of God
According to Saiva Siddhanta, 1971.

Shaka (“Teak”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the
sixth of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Shaka Era
One of the dating systems in India,
which is claimed to mark the defeat of
the Shakas by King Salivahana. For any
given year in the common era, the
Shaka era date is either seventy-eight or
seventy-nine years earlier, a discrepancy
that stems from the differing days on
which the years begin in these two sys-
tems. In the common era the year begins
on January 1, but in the Shaka era it
begins with the sun’s transition into
Aries, determined in India as falling on
April 14. Hence, to convert a Shaka era
date to a common era date, one adds
seventy-nine years for dates from
January 1 to April 14, and seventy-eight
years for dates from April 15 to
December 31.
Shakata
(“cart”) One of the demon assassins sent
by Kamsa, the demon-king of Mathura,
to kill his nephew, the child-god
Krishna. Shakata takes the form of a
cart, intending to take the infant
Krishna unaware. Yet Krishna is not
fooled by this deception: With a kick of
his infant toes Krishna launches the cart
into flight, killing the demon with the
force of the blow.
Shakha
(“branch”) The name given to a local
“branch”
of
the
Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ), whose
membership is often drawn from a
particular neighborhood or section of
a city. The RSS is a conservative Hindu
organization whose express purpose
is to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India. The RSS has
historically characterized itself as a
cultural and character-building orga-
nization, and for much of its existence
has shunned direct political involve-
ment, although it has exercised con-
siderable influence through its many
affiliated organizations. Each shakha,
or local RSS unit, holds a daily meeting
for its members, who are known as
svayamsevaks (“volunteers”). The
meeting’s typical activities include an
opening ceremony in which the orga-
nization’s saffron banner is raised; tra-
ditional games or exercises, including
martial drill, and a discussion period
in which RSS ideals can be disseminat-
ed and propagated. The shakhas in
any given area are overseen by a full-
time RSS worker known as a pracharak
(“director”), who serves as a liaison
between the local units and the RSS
leadership, and who oversees RSS
activity in his area. Most of the
shakha’s members will never advance
beyond this local level, and those who
do are usually gifted leaders. Thus, the
primary stress at the shakha level is
on forming personal relationships
with other members, as a way to
develop loyalty to the organization.
Although the shakhas often have very
high attrition, the bonds developed
there are often very strong as well and
are particularly beneficial in helping
displaced and newly urbanized peo-
ple develop a sense of community. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987.

Shakra
Shakra
An epithet of the god Indra. See Indra.
Shakta
Worshiper of the Goddess in any of her
myriad forms. The name itself is
derived from shakti, the divine femi-
nine “power” that gives the Goddess
her vitality. Among the most famous
forms of the Goddess are Durga and
Kali, who are both powerful and dan-
gerous goddesses. Aside from these,
there are a host of other goddesses,
who are often the presiding deities of a
particular place. See also Lakshmi,
Nirriti, Parvati, Prithvi, Sati, Shiwalik
goddesses, and Ushas.
Shakti
(“power”) In Hindu iconography, the
name of the spear carried by the god
Skanda. The spear’s head is shaped
either like a leaf or a diamond, and it is
fitted with a wooden shaft.
Shakti
(2) Epithet of the Goddess. Shakti
is believed to be a divine feminine
power that is present in each person
as the kundalini. See also Goddess

Shakti Pithas
(“benches” or “seats” of Shakti)
General term for a network of sites
connected with the worship of the
Mother Goddess. Although their num-
ber differs from source to source—
some list fifty-one, and others 108—in
both cases the sites are spread
throughout the subcontinent, from
Baluchistan (in modern Pakistan) to
Assam to the deep south. According to
the charter myth, each of these places
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to
earth, taking form as a different god-
dess in each place. This myth provides
a way to connect the myriad local
Hindu goddesses by conceiving them
[[620]]

as differing manifestations of a single
primordial Goddess. It also connects
the subcontinent into a single concep-
tual unit, knit together by this network
of sites as the body is connected by its
members. One should also note that
different places may claim the same
body part in the drive to enhance the
religious prestige of any particular
site. As but one example, according to
most “official” lists Sati’s vulva, the
most powerfully charged part of the
female body, fell at the temple of
Kamakhya in Assam, but the same
claim is made at Kalimath in the
Himalayas. Suffice it to say that there
is no single authoritative list of sites,
and competing claims are not unusu-
al. See also pitha.
Shakumbhari Devi
Presiding deity of the Shakumbhari Devi
temple in the district of Saharanpur in
Uttar Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. This site is one of
the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; in the case of Shakum-
bhari Devi, the body part is said to have
been Sati’s head. The temple is in a thin-
ly settled region, and the major time of
year that pilgrims come to visit is during
the Navaratri festivals.
Although Hindi literature identifies
Shakumbhari Devi as a form of Durga,
the site’s charter myth shows the nur-
turing capacities of the Goddess as
well as the warrior aspect more com-
monly
associated
with
Durga.
According to the story, a demon
named Durgam gains the boon that he
cannot be conquered by any of the
gods. After subduing all the gods,
Durgam prevents the storm-god Indra
from sending rain to the earth for one
hundred years. Seeing the earth’s dis-
tress, the gods approach the Goddess
and beg for her help. The Goddess,Shakuntala
filled with pity, takes a form with one
hundred eyes, because of which one of
her epithets is Shatakshi (“hundred
eyes”). From each eye comes a stream
of tears, and when these fall to the
earth, plants begin to grow again.
Further, when her tears do not reach
some places, she puts forth vegetables
(Shak) from her own body to nourish
the creatures of the earth. Her final
action is to kill the demon Durgam,
reasserting the Goddess as a strong
and protective figure. Although there
is little information on Shakumbhari
Devi in English, there are further refer-
ences to her in David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986. See also pitha.
Shakuni
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, the maternal
uncle of Duryodhana, the epic’s
antagonist. Shakuni’s most famous
episode in the Mahabharata is as a
player in the game of dice against
Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. The epic describes
Shakuni as the world’s best dice player,
whereas Yudhishthira is enthusiastic
but
completely
unskilled.
As
Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps
betting bigger and bigger stakes in an
effort to win back what he has lost.
After losing his family’s kingdom and
all their possessions, Yudhishthira
wagers himself and his brothers, and
after losing this bet, he wagers and
loses their common wife, Draupadi.
As a result, Draupadi is paraded
through the assembly hall by
Shakuni’s nephews, Duryodhana and
Duhshasana, her clothes stained
with her menstrual blood, sharpening
the already strong enmities between
these two groups. Shocked at such
treatment, Duryodhana’s father, King
Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas
back their freedom. Then, because of a
loss in a subsequent game of dice, the
Pandavas agree to go into exile for
twelve years and live incognito for the
thirteenth, with the condition that, if
they are discovered in the thirteenth
year, the cycle will begin anew. In the
ensuing Mahabharata war Shakuni
fights on the side of his nephew and is
eventually killed by the fourth
Pandava brother, Sahadeva.
Shakuntala
A figure in Hindu mythology and the
protagonist in the drama Abhijnana-
shakuntala written by the poet
Kalidasa. Shakuntala is the daughter
of the apsara Menaka and the sage
Vishvamitra, conceived when Menaka
is sent to seduce Vishvamitra in an
attempt to reduce his spiritual powers.
Shakuntala is raised at the ashram of
the sage Kanva, where she grows into a
beautiful young woman. One day she
attracts the eye of King Dushyanta,
who has been hunting in the forest,
and they are married by the gandhar-
va form of marriage (consensual sexu-
al intercourse), conceiving their son
Bharata. Shakuntala’s happiness,
however, is short-lived. As she is think-
ing one day about Dushyanta, who has
traveled back to his capital without
her, she fails to notice the arrival of the
sage Durvasas. In his anger at being
ignored, Durvasas lays a curse that her
beloved will completely forget her.
Shakuntala, horrified, manages to
convince Durvasas to modify the
curse: Dushyanta will remember
everything, as soon as Shakuntala
shows him proof of their union.
Shakuntala has Dushyanta’s signet
ring as proof, but she loses it on her
way to see Dushyanta. Dushyanta (as
expected) denies that he has ever met
Shakuntala, and she eventually ends
up working as one of the palace cooks.
Her salvation comes unexpectedly,
when she finds the missing ring in the
belly of a fish she is preparing for the
king’s dinner. When she shows him the
ring, Dushyanta immediately recog-
nizes Shakuntala and acknowledges
her as his wife, and the couple live
happily ever after.

Shalagram
Shamvuka
Believed to be a manifestation of the god Vishnu,
a shalagram is a black stone that contains the
fossilized spiral shell of a prehistoric sea creature.
Shalagram
Black stone containing an ammonite,
the spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehis-
toric sea creature. The shalagram is pri-
marily found in the upper reaches of the
Gandaki River in Nepal. The circular
ammonite fossil is understood to be
Vishnu’s chakra, and the shalagram is
thus understood as a “self-manifest”
(svayambhu) form of Vishnu. As with all
such “self-manifest” forms, the shala-
gram is believed to be especially holy,
since in it Vishnu has chosen to reveal
himself to his devotees (bhakta) rather
than coming to an image fashioned by
human hands. Because of its holiness,
the shalagram is often an object of wor-
ship. Its portability (and durability) made
it the preferred form of Vishnu for wan-
dering Vaishnava ascetics. One also finds
cases in which small images are claimed
to have been revealed when a shalagram
was broken open; these images carry the
glamour of a finished image as well as the
divine power that accompanies sponta-
neous manifestation.
Shambhu
(“causing happiness,” “granting pros-
perity”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
[[622]]

Shudra ascetic who appears both in
the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, and in the poet
Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsha , whose
story line is based on the Ramayana.
According to the story a brahmin
comes to Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist, and complains that his son has
died because of the unrighteousness
running through the land. Since the
king is considered responsible for the
general moral climate in his kingdom,
Rama immediately asks the brahmin
for more information. He is told that a
man named Shamvuka has been
doing physical asceticism (tapas) in a
bid to generate spiritual powers
through his suffering, even though
Shamvuka is a member of the servant
(shudra) class, and these sorts of reli-
gious exercises are forbidden to peo-
ple of such low social status. Rama
finds Shamvuka hanging his head
downward over a smoking fire, and
when he refuses to desist from his
ascetic practices, Rama kills him. This
episode conveys several important
messages. One of these is the Indian
cultural belief that physical suffering
generates spiritual and/or magic
powers. When this belief is combined
with a profoundly hierarchical model
of society, it becomes important for
the higher-class people to control the
people who are allowed to do this,
lest the lower classes gain power over
their “betters.” Finally, this story
shows the Ramayana’s general ten-
dency to uphold established social
values and boundaries.
Shankara
(“auspicious”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. With the honorific suffix
acharya (“teacher”), this is also the
name of the most significant figure in
the Advaita Vedanta philosophical
school, Shankaracharya, who is pop-
ularly considered to be Shiva incar-
nate. As noted above, the generally
accepted meaning of the nameShankaracharya
Shankara has intensely positive con-
notations, yet the verb shank, from
which this name is almost certainly
derived, has associations with doubt,
uncertainty, and anxiety. This sort of
ambivalence has a long association
with Shiva; the earliest accepted refer-
ence, in the Shvetashvatara Upan-
ishad, mentions both his death-deal-
ing arrows, and his kindness to his
devotees (bhakta). The traditional
meaning of this name may thus be a
form of propitiation—knowing that
Shiva wields awesome and unpre-
dictable power but describing him as
“auspicious” in the hope that he will
show his kinder side.
Shankaracharya
(788–820?) Writer and religious thinker
who is unquestionably the most sig-
nificant figure in the Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school, and arguably the
single greatest Hindu religious figure.
Very little is known about his life—
even his dates are a matter of specula-
tion—but popular tales abound.
According to one story, he was the god
Shiva incarnate, who descended to
earth to reveal the knowledge of the
absolute. This connection is shown by
his name—Shankara is one of the epi-
thets of Shiva, and acharya (“teacher”)
is an honorific suffix. He is traditional-
ly believed to have been born in a
Nambudiri brahmin family at Kaladi
in the state of Kerala, to have become
an ascetic at a very young age, and to
have traveled widely engaging in reli-
gious disputes, particularly with the
Buddhists, whose religious influence
he put in permanent decline. He is
believed to have established the ten
Dashanami Sanyasi orders and the
four maths that are their centers, to
have written commentaries on the
three texts central to the Vedanta
school—namely the Upanishads, the
Vedanta Sutras , and the Bhagavad
Gita—and to have gone finally to the
high Himalayas, where he died at the
age of 32.
Many of these claims cannot be sub-
stantiated, but the significance of his
work cannot be denied. His commen-
tary on the Vedanta Sutras, the
Brahmasutra Bhashya, gives the classic
formulation of Advaita Vedanta, with its
emphasis that the Ultimate Reality is the
unqualified (nirguna) Brahman, which
is eternal and unchanging, and to which
the human soul is identical. The chang-
ing phenomenal world (the world we
see and sense) is an illusion, created
through the superimposition (adhyasa)
of mistaken ideas upon the unqualified
Brahman. Since Shankaracharya believes
that one is released from bondage by
replacing this mistaken understanding
with the correct one, insight and not
action is the means to liberation. This
moment of understanding can be
described as a flash of realization, but it
seems mistaken to characterize Shanka-
racharya as a mystic. This is because
he strongly emphasizes the authority
of the sacred texts as a source of accu-
rate knowledge about the ultimate
truth. Although this stress on insight
devalues the ultimate worth of ritual
action, except in a preparatory role
by removing defilements, Shankara-
charya also believed that required ritual
actions should be performed from a
sense of duty.
Shankaracharya is as philosophically
significant for his silence as for his
speech. He gives no definitive answer
on many philosophical issues: about
whether selves are one or many, about
whether the locus of ignorance (avidya)
was Brahman or the individual, about
the nature of ignorance itself, and about
the real nature of the material world. His
refusal to take a position on these issues
left many different routes open to those
who came after him. Shankaracharya
himself tended to emphasize epistemo-
logical issues—how human beings
come to know things, and particularly
how to correct the mistaken ideas
through which human beings are held
in bondage. The image that comes
through his writing is of a deeply reli-
gious man whose primary concern was
[[623]]
Shankaracharyas
ascetic center and Kanchipuram’s gen-
eral status as a religious center.
Although by this reckoning there are
five places, at present there are only
four Shankaracharyas, since Swami
Swaroopanand Saraswati holds the seat
for both Badrinath and Dwaraka. The
other Shankaracharyas are Swami
Nishchalanand (Puri), Swami Bharati
Tirtha (Shringeri), and Swami Jayendra
Saraswati (Kanchipuram). Their trad-
itional office gives the Shankara-
charyas a great deal of religious status
and prestige, and because of this they
have become highly influential figures,
even in an intensely decentralized reli-
gious tradition.

to help his hearers destroy their illusions
and gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Given this underlying goal
and his acute philosophical mind, one
can argue that he was aware of such
metaphysical questions but chose to
ignore them, since they were unrelated
to his primary goal. For further informa-
tion on Shankaracharya’s thought, see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara
and His Pupils, 1981.
Shankaracharyas
The philosopher Shankaracharya
(788–820) is traditionally said to have
established centers for the Dashanami
Sanyasi ascetics, devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, at four places in India:
Badrinath, Puri, Shringeri, and
Dwaraka. The head monk at each
of these centers has been given the
title Shankaracharya, as a sign of the
status of his office. The head of the
Kamakotipith, an ascetic center in the
southern Indian city of Kanchipuram,
has also come to be described as a
Shankaracharya, even though this site is
not one of the original four; this reflects
the Kamakotipith’s importance as an
[[624]]

Shankaradigvijaya
(“Shankara’s victory tour”) A written
account of the life of the philosopher
Shankaracharya traditionally attrib-
uted to the fourteenth-century writer
Madhavacharya, although evidence
within the work points to composition
several centuries later. The story is clearly
hagiographical, for it is filled with fan-
tastic legends intended to highlight
Shankaracharya’s achievements and his
ultimate identity with the god Shiva
himself. According to this story, after
gaining full wisdom, Shankaracharya
embarks on a “victory tour” (digvijaya)
of India. During this tour he travels
throughout the country, debates all
opponents, and defeats them all con-
vincingly, thus establishing the
supremacy of his Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school. The motif of the
digvijaya (literally, “conquest of [all]
directions”) was a common theme in
works about political and military lead-
ers, and here it has been adapted to tell
a religious story.
Shankha
(“conch shell”) In Hindu religious
imagery, one of the identifying objects
always carried by the god Vishnu, along
with the club (gada), lotus (padma), and
discus (chakra). Vishnu’s conch isSharada Math
considered both a musical instrument
and an instrument of war, since through
its powerful sound he is said to have
struck terror in the hearts of his ene-
mies. The conch is also commonly
carried by certain powerful forms of the
Goddess. The reason for this can be
found in her charter myth, in which she
is formed from the collected radiance of
all the gods and receives duplicates of all
their weapons.
Shanta (“peaceful”) Bhava
The first of the five modes of devotion to
God that were most prominently articu-
lated by Rupa Goswami, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a fol-
lower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used five different models of
human relationships to explain the vari-
ety of links followers might have with
the deities. These five models showed
growing emotional intensity, from the
peaceful (shanta) sense that comes from
realizing one’s complete identity with
Brahman, or Supreme Reality, to con-
ceiving of god as one’s master, friend,
child, or lover. The shanta bhava, in
which one finds mental peace through
the realization of complete identity with
Brahman, is the only one of these modes
in which the devotee does not have a
personalized relationship with God.
Given Rupa’s assumption that Krishna
was the highest manifestation of god-
head, and that true religious life
involved having a relationship with him,
the shanta bhava was thus judged inferi-
or to the other four modes.
Shantanu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Sanskrit epics, Shantanu is the
father of Bhishma by his first wife, and
the husband of Satyavati in his second
marriage. Satyavati has agreed to marry
Shantanu on the condition that her sons
reign, despite the fact that Bhishma is
the eldest and thus is rightly entitled to
the throne. Shantanu agrees to this con-
dition, and to please his father Bhishma
vows never to marry, so that he will have
no heirs to compete with Satyavati’s.
Bhishma upholds his promise until his
death, but Shantanu’s willingness to put
aside the rightful heir has terrible conse-
quences. When Satyavati’s son Vichitra-
virya dies childless, she calls on her
elder son Vyasa to sire children by his
wives. From this union comes Pandu
and Dhrtarashtra. The struggle for royal
power by their respective sons culmi-
nates in the Mahabharata war, in which
the family is destroyed.
Shantiniketan
(“abode of peace”) Town in the Birbhum
district of West Bengal, about ninety
miles northeast of Calcutta. It is most
famous for Vishva-Bharati University,
founded in 1921 by the Indian poet and
Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore
(1861–1941). As an educational institu-
tion, the university was dedicated to
providing an education that would satisfy
people’s material and spiritual needs
and thus develop an integrated human
being. It did this in part by promoting
the arts and by stressing the intercon-
nection between nature and human
beings, both themes that were close to
Tagore’s heart.
Sharada Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
for Hindu ascetics (often translated as
“monasteries”) traditionally believed to
have been established by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya; the oth-
ers are the Jyotir Math, Shringeri Math,
and Govardhan Math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Sharada
Math is in the western quarter, in the
city of Dwaraka in the state of Gujarat,
on the shore of the Arabian Sea.
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as
the founder of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
the most prestigious Hindu ascetic
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)
ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of the god
[[625]]
Sharva
Shiva who are divided into ten divisions,
each with a different name. These
ten divisions are organized into four larger
organizational groups—Anandawara,
Bhogawara, Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—
each of which has two or three of the ten
divisions and is associated with one of the
four maths. Of these, the Sharada Math is
associated with the Kitawara group.
Sharva
(from shara, “arrow”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. In his earliest description in the
Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the god
Rudra (later identified with Shiva) is
identified as a god whose primary
weapons are infallible arrows. This char-
acterization of Shiva as an archer has
continued ever since; his bow Pinaka is
one of few divine weapons famous
enough to have a name. See Shiva.
Shastra
(“order”) A shastra is the name given to a
technical treatise explaining the standards
of a particular cultural or artistic discipline
in Hinduism, as in Bharata’s Natya-
shastra, a technical manual that discusses
dance and the theater. When it is placed at
the end of a compound (as in “Shilpa
Shastra”), the word shastra can also serve
to denote the whole body of teaching on
that particular subject. All of the classical
arts were placed under well-defined
canons, each with its own specific rules
and standards to guide artists: Sculpture
and architecture were under Shilpa
Shastra, music under Sangita shastra, and
dance and theater under Natya shastra.
Given the prevailing emphasis on uphold-
ing such strict rules, artistic genius meant
doing something unusual within the larger
confines of the tradition rather than creat-
ing something entirely new or original.
Shastri Narayanswarupdas Swami
The ascetic name of the spiritual leader
of the Akshar Purushottam Samstha,
a branch of the Swaminarayan
religious community. He is more
commonly known by his title Pramukh
[[626]]

Swami (“President
Pramukh Swami.
Swami”).
See
Shatakatrayam
(“The Three Hundred”) Collection of
Sanskrit poems ascribed to the poet-
philosopher Bhartrhari, who is believed
to have lived in the fifth century. The text is
a three-part collection of poems about
political life, love, and renunciation, which
explore all of the conventional ends of life:
The first two sections are about power
(artha), sensual or physical desire (kama),
and righteous action (dharma), whereas
the final section is concerned with libera-
tion of the soul (moksha). Much of the
poetry carries a cynical, slightly bitter
tone, suggesting the world-weariness of a
man who has seen too much of the harsh
realities of life. For further information see
Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.), The Hermit
and the Love-Thief, 1978.
Shatakshi
(“[having] one hundred eyes”) Epithet of
the goddess Shakumbhari Devi, based
on a story that tells of a time when the
earth is parched with drought, and she
takes a form with a hundred eyes, water-
ing the earth with her tears. See
Shakumbhari Devi.
Shatapatha
(“Hundred-Path”) Brahmana
One of the two most important texts in the
Brahmana branch of sacred Vedic litera-
ture, along with the Aiteraya Brahmana.
The Brahmanas were primarily manuals
describing the correct performance of
Vedic ritual sacrifices. Each Brahmana was
in theory connected with one of the
Vedas, which gave them Vedic authority,
but in fact they were quite different from
the Vedas in scope and content. According
to tradition, the Shatapatha Brahmana
was connected with the “white” recension
of the Yajur Veda, a variant form of the text
in which the explanatory notes connected
with the Vedic mantras have been collected
into a separate appendix. This is inShaving
A man shaves an infant boy’s head. Hair is believed to trap impurities.
contrast with the “Black” Yajur Veda, in
which these notes have been incorporated
into the body of the text itself. Aside from
giving instruction on the practice of rituals,
the Shatapatha Brahmana includes a wide
variety of texts, one of which is the Isha
Upanishad. The upanishad’s presence in a
Brahmana text clearly shows that there
was considerable overlap in the times of
composition of various Vedic literary
styles, rather than clear-cut “periods.”
Shatrughna
(“Foe-slayer”) In the Ramayana, the earli-
er of the two great Indian epics,
Shatrughna is the second son of King
Dasharatha and his wife Sumitra, and the
youngest brother of Rama, the epic’s pro-
tagonist. Whereas Rama’s brothers Laksh-
mana and Bharata play important roles in
the epic—the former as Rama’s minion
and shadow, the latter serving as Rama’s
regent during his exile—Shatrughna is vir-
tually invisible and does not play an
important part in the larger epic narrative.
Shattila Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Magh ( January–February). As with all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of the god
Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals have
certain prescribed rites, which usually
involve fasting (upavasa) and worship
and often promise specific benefits
for faithful performance. On this day
one should bathe an image of Vishnu
with the five auspicious things (milk,
curds, honey, ghee, and sugar water),
placing some sesame seed (tila) into
each. One should also eat food con-
taining sesame seed. During the night
one should sleep before the image of
the deity. This ekadashi’s name comes
from the six (sat) ways in which
the sesame seed has been used.
Faithfully observing this festival is said
to cause one to be reborn in Vishnu’s
realm, Vaikuntha.
Shaving
An act of ritual purification as well as
an act of hygiene. The hair of the head
and face is believed to trap impurity
(ashaucha), and shaving one or both
is a significant part of many rites of
[[627]]
Shesha
purification. Body hair, however, is
rarely shaved, since the Sanskrit lan-
guage has different words for these
two types of hair, and they are consid-
ered to be different things entirely.
During the period of impurity associ-
ated with death (maranashaucha) the
mourners will not shave for the entire
ten days, signifying their continuing
impurity, but at the end of that period
they will shave completely to signify
their final purification. Hindu men
will sometimes also refrain from
shaving as a sign of austerity while
they are keeping religious vows, and
shave when the vow has been com-
pleted. One example occurs during
the lunar month of Shravan, in which
men who are devotees (bhakta) of the
god Shiva will often refrain from
shaving. Another example can be
found in the ritual preparation for the
annual pilgrimage to Shabari Malai;
men must keep a strict ascetic disci-
pline for forty-one days before the pil-
grimage, in which one element is a
ban on shaving.
Shesha
(“remnant”) Mythical thousand-head-
ed serpent upon which the god
Vishnu reclines, as on a couch;
Shesha is also considered to support
the various regions of the earth, par-
ticularly the underworlds. His name
comes from the fact that he is consid-
ered a partial incarnation of Vishnu
and is thus related to Vishnu, both as
incarnation and through his status as
Vishnu’s couch. As with most of the
gods’ animal associates, Shesha does
not play a prominent role in his own
right. The one mythic episode in
which he does play an important part
is that of churning the Ocean of Milk
in which Shesha serves as the churn-
ing-rope to turn Mount Mandara,
with all the gods pulling from one
side, and the demons pulling from the
other. Yet here too he is only instru-
mental, necessary for the episode to
unfold but with the main focus lying
[[628]]

elsewhere. Shesha is seen as having a
protective role. In Hindu astrology
(jyotisha) he is identified as the pro-
tective deity for the fifth day of each
half of the lunar month. See also
Tortoise avatar.
Shibi
In Hindu mythology, sage-king who is
famous for his virtue and commit-
ment to his word. Shibi’s reputation
reaches the ears of the gods, who
decide to test it. The god Dharma,
who is righteousness personified (or
in some other versions, the god Agni)
takes the form of a dove, and is pur-
sued by the god Indra, in the form of a
hawk. The dove flies into Shibi’s lap
and entreats him for asylum, which
Shibi grants. The hawk observes that it
is inappropriate for Shibi to deprive
him of the food he needs to eat, and
demands in exchange an equal weight
of flesh cut from Shibi’s body. Shibi
agrees, but no matter how much of his
flesh he throws into the balance, the
dove is still heavier. Finally Shibi sits
his whole body into the balance, as a
sign that he will sacrifice his life for
the dove. At this point the gods
resume their divine forms and bless
Shibi for his steadfastness.
Shikhandi
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, the rebirth of
the maiden Amba, daughter of the
king of Kashi. Amba and her sisters
have been kidnapped by Bhishma to
be
married
to
his
nephew
Vichitravirya, but when she informs
Bhishma that her heart already
belongs to King Salva, Bhishma gal-
lantly releases her. Yet Salva refuses to
marry her, for since she has been kid-
napped he is not certain of her virgin-
ity. Amba then returns to Bhishma,
who refuses to marry her because of
his vow to remain a lifelong bachelor.
In her anger Amba swears to get
revenge on Bhishma and performsShiksha
harsh physical asceticism (tapas) to
generate the spiritual powers neces-
sary to do this. Her austerities eventu-
ally please the god Shiva, who
promises her that she will be reward-
ed in her next birth. Amba then raises
a pyre and burns herself to death.
Amba is reborn as Shikhandi to
King Drupada, whose wife has
received a boon that she will give birth
to a girl, but that the girl will later be
transformed into a boy. When
Shikhandi is born, it is announced
that the child is a boy and the child is
given the training appropriate for a
prince. It is only upon fixing
a marriage for Shikhandi that the
issue of the child’s gender comes up
and it is finally resolved when
Shikhandi exchanges sexes with a
nature
spirit
(yaksha)
named
Sthunakarna, who becomes a
woman, and Shikhandi a man. The
switch is originally intended to be for
only a short period, but is later
extended until Shikhandi’s death, at
which time Sthunakarna again
becomes male.
During the Mahabharata war
Shikhandi challenges Bhishma in bat-
tle but the latter refuses to fight him,
since Shikhandi has been born a
woman. Shikhandi takes advantage of
this gallantry to shoot a barrage of
arrows at Bhishma, as does the warrior
Arjuna, who hides behind Shikhandi
for protection. With this assault,
Bhishma finally decides that the time
has come for him to give up the fight
and die. In the battle that follows after
Bhishma falls, Shikhandi is killed by
Ashvatthama, the son of Drona, who
fights on the side of the Kauravas in
the war. Based on Shikhandi’s role in
shielding Arjuna from harm, in mod-
ern Hindi the name Shikhandi is used
to designate a scapegoat, someone
behind whom another person hides
and escapes blame.
Shikhara
Temple tower that was the central fea-
ture of the Nagara architectural style,
prevalent in northern and eastern India.
The temple’s tallest tower was always
directly over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, although there were
often also smaller, subsidiary towers to
lead the eye up to that primary one.
Within this general pattern there are two
important variations, exemplified by the
temples at Khajuraho and Orissa. In the
Khajuraho style a group of shikharas is
unified into one continuous upward
swell, which draws the eye upward like a
series of hills leading to a distant peak.
In contrast, the Orissan style tends to
emphasize the differences between the
temple’s parts, with a low entrance hall
(jagamohan) next to a beehive-shaped
temple tower (deul), which is often
three or four times taller than the
entrance hall.
Shiksha
(“learning”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the supplemental branch-
es of knowledge connected with the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts, and all the Vedangas were asso-
ciated with the use of the Vedas.
Shiksha was concerned with articula-
tion, proper pronunciation, and the
laws of euphonic combination (sand-
hi), that is, sounds combined in a cer-
tain way to have a pleasant effect.
Although this may sound trivial, it
was a central concern in the cult of
sacrifice laid out in the Brahmana
literature. This was because the
power of these sacrifices was believed
to depend on the proper delivery of
the Vedic mantras, with any mistake
being potentially ruinous. Aside from
shiksha, the other Vedangas are vya-
karana (Sanskrit grammar), chandas
(Sanskrit prosody), kalpa (ritual
instructions), nirukta (etymology),
and jyotisha (favorable times for
sacrifices).

Shilappadigaram
Image of the god Vishnu. Crafted according to the
rules of shilpa shastra, the image’s proportions are
strictly defined and he holds identifying objects.
Shilappadigaram
(“the Jeweled Anklet”) The greatest epic
poem in classical Tamil literature. It is
traditionally ascribed to the poet
Ilangovadigal (2nd c.) but almost cer-
tainly was written several centuries
later. The poem is a symbolic theater for
several important themes that have per-
vaded Hindu culture, particularly the
need for a king to rule righteously and
the power gained by a wife through her
devotion to her husband. The story tells
the tale of a married couple, Kannaki
and her husband Kovalan. In his infatu-
ation with a dancer, Kovalan squanders
the family’s wealth, selling nearly all
[[630]]

their possessions. When he finally
returns to his wife, their only remaining
valuables are one pair of her jeweled
anklets. The couple decides to travel to
the town of Madurai to sell the anklets,
and use the proceeds to reestablish their
family as traders.
When they reach Madurai, however,
tragedy strikes. The night before the
couple’s arrival, a dishonest jeweler has
stolen an identical pair of anklets from
the queen of Madurai, and when
Kovalan goes to sell the anklets, the
same jeweler accuses him of being the
thief. Kovalan is executed, and when
Kannaki hears of this she comes into the
city, bearing the other anklet as a sign of
his innocence. She gains an audience
with the king, who falls dead with
remorse when he realizes the disaster he
has caused. Still furious, Kannaki rips off
her left breast, pronounces a curse on
the city, and hurls the breast onto the
street; the breast bursts into flames that
consume the city. In the end, Madurai’s
patron goddess persuades Kannaki to
withdraw her curse, and Kannaki dies a
few days later.
One of the forces assumed to be
operating here is the power of a woman’s
devotion to her husband. Even though
Kovalan squanders all their money
through unfaithfulness, Kannaki readily
takes him back when he returns, and is
willing to give up her last resource to
help him. The power of her devotion
gives her the ability to cause widespread
destruction through a single curse, and
the strength of this power is still an arti-
cle of faith among many Hindus even
today. For further discussion of the
themes in this play, and more general
consideration of images of Hindu
women, see Sarah Mitter, Dharma’s
Daughters, 1991. See also Tamil lan-
guage and Tamil epics.
Shilpa Shastra
General name for rules and standards
governing the mechanical arts and
handicrafts—traditionally numbered at
sixty-four—through which anything wasShishtachara
formed, made, or fashioned. In the con-
text of art and architecture, the term
shilpa shastra is most often associated
with two specific areas, which by the
medieval era had had their conventions
strictly fixed. One of these governed the
creation of sculptural images, according
to which the images of the deities had to
be carved to exactly defined propor-
tions, along with their identifying attrib-
utes. The other area was in regard
to buildings, whether individual struc-
tures such as temples, or collections
of buildings in city planning. The layout
of temples was modeled after the
human body (and thus mirrored the
sculptor’s precision regarding the
images of the divine); entire towns
were similarly modeled to create a
harmonious urban environment.
Shipra River
A distant tributary of the Yamuna River,
which has its headwaters in the
Vindhya Mountains in Madhya Pradesh.
The Shipra is considered a holy river
because it flows through Ujjain, a cen-
tral Indian city with great religious and
historical significance.
Shirdi
Small town in the state of Mahara-
shtra, about 120 miles northeast of
Bombay. It is famous as the home of
the modern saint Shirdi Sai Baba, who
appeared there as an adolescent boy in
[[1872]]
 and lived there until his death in
[[1918]]
. He was greatly esteemed by peo-
ple from all religious communities,
and the shrine built in the place in
which he lived receives considerable
traffic even today.
Shirdi Sai Baba
(d. 1918) Hindu ascetic and religious
teacher whose disciples came from
many different religious communities—
Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, and Christian. His
origins are mysterious, for in 1872 he
simply appeared in the town of Shirdi in
Maharashtra, as a boy of about sixteen.
He was dressed in the manner of a
Muslim faqir (religious mendicant, or
beggar), but claimed to have forgotten
his birthplace and his family. Because of
his dress a local priest forbade him from
staying at a Hindu temple, so he moved
into a small, unused mosque, where he
lived for the rest of his life. He kept a per-
petual fire burning in a fire pit, and for
religious rituals performed both Muslim
prayers and Hindu worship. He was
most famous for his supernatural pow-
ers: healing (for which he often gave
people ash from his fire pit to eat), fore-
telling the future, multilocation (the
ability to be in two places at the same
time), and appearing in dreams to guide
his followers. His response to people’s
immediate needs made him famous
through much of India, but he always
maintained that his purpose in per-
forming miracles was to attract people
to spiritual life. He gradually attracted
disciples, and in the time since his death
the town of Shirdi has become an
important regional pilgrimage place
(tirtha). Although he referred to himself
as Sai Baba, he is now usually called
Shirdi Sai Baba, to distinguish him from
Sathya Sai Baba, another religious
leader who claims to be Shirdi Sai Baba’s
reincarnated form.
Shishtachara
The “practice of learned [people],”
which was one of the traditional sources
for determining religious duty (dharma)
for matters not discussed in the dharma
literature, or for cases in which the liter-
ature itself gave conflicting opinions.
Although Shishtachara was the least
authoritative source of dharma, after the
Vedic scriptures and the dharma litera-
ture, making it an authority recognizes
that life has many ambiguities and
uncertainties and at the same time pro-
vides a resource for determining the
appropriate action by taking as a model
the practice of established and knowl-
edgeable people. Another term to desig-
nate this sort of authority was sadachara ,
the “practice of good [people].”
[[631]]
Shishupala
Shishupala
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Shishupala is the son
of the king of Cedi. He is also described
as a reincarnation of Jaya—one of the
gatekeepers of the god Vishnu’s heavenly
dwelling, Vaikuntha—who has been
cursed by the sages to be born three
times as a demon and killed by the god
Vishnu each time. Shishupala is born
with three eyes and four hands, but as
his horrified parents are about to aban-
don him, a celestial voice informs them
that the child will grow up into a power-
ful king. The heavenly voice also says
that Shishupala can be killed by only
one person on earth, that Shishupala’s
third eye will disappear when he sees
that person, and that two of his hands
will disappear when the person takes
him in his lap. After some time the god
Krishna pays a visit to Cedi, and when
the signs take place as foretold,
Shishupala’s parents know that Krishna
is the only person who can kill their son.
Shishupala’s mother is Krishna’s aunt,
and when she begs him not to kill her
son, Krishna promises to forgive
Shishupala’s misdeeds one hundred
times. Krishna sticks to his word, but
such forbearance only makes Shish-
upala more reckless, and after the one
hundred and first insult, Krishna
throws his discus and cuts off
Shishupala’s head.
Shishupala-Vadha
(“Slaughter of Shishupala”) Sanskrit
drama written by the seventh-century
poet Magha, which is traditionally reck-
oned as one of the six mahakavyas. The
play’s theme is the death of the mythic
figure Shishupala, whose mother has
been promised by Krishna that he will
forgive her son one hundred times. This
promise only makes Shishupala more
reckless, and after the one hundred and
first insult, Krishna throws his discus
and cuts off Shishupala’s head. Aside
from its mythic theme, the play
is notable for a number of unusual
verses, such as verses that are perfect
[[632]]

palindromes (verses that are the same
when read backward or forward), or that
use only one or two consonants, as a
sign of the poet’s skill.
Shishya
(“to be taught”) A word that in its literal
meaning can refer to any student but in
its most common sense refers to the dis-
ciple of a religious instructor (guru).
Shitala
Hindu goddess who is both worshiped
and feared. Shitala was traditionally
believed to be the physical representa-
tion of smallpox, a deadly virus, and a
person infected with the disease was
thought to be possessed by the goddess,
a notion reinforced by the fever and
delirium that often accompany this dis-
ease. Shitala is also associated with
heat—both because of the fever caused
by smallpox and because her major
religious observance, Shitalashtami,
comes near the advent of the hot sea-
son. Shitala is considered a jealous,
spiteful goddess whose wrath is visited
upon those who ignore and displease
her. The literal meaning of her name,
“Cool One,” can be seen as an attempt to
appease her wrath through flattery.
Shitala has retained prominence even
though the World Health Organization
has declared that smallpox has been
completely eradicated. In a fascinating
example of religious change, one writer
details how Shitala has shifted the dis-
ease through which she shows herself,
and now appears in the guise of tuber-
culosis. See Margaret Thrice Egnor, “The
Changed Mother, or What the Smallpox
Goddess Did when There Was No More
Smallpox,” Contributions to Asian
Studies XVIII, 1984.
Shitalashtami
Religious observance celebrated on the
eighth day of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Baisakh
(April–May), in honor of the goddess
Shitala. In northern India this festivalShiva
falls at the advent of the hottest time
of year; the climate thus mirrors the
heat and fevers brought on by contact
with Shitala herself, in her form as
smallpox. Although Shitala is conceived
as spiteful and jealous, she cannot be
ignored, since this will be sure to
provoke her wrath.
Shiv Sena
(“Army of Shivaji”) Militant Hindu orga-
nization formed in Bombay in the late
[[1960]]
s by Bal Thackeray. It was originally
a movement made up of people native
to Maharashtra, a modern Indian “lin-
guistic state” formed to unite people
with a common language, to resist the
perceived dominance of outsiders, in
this case migrants from Tamil Nadu who
were taking away jobs from the
Maharashtrian “sons of the soil.” This
nativist bent is reflected in its name, tak-
ing as its symbol the Maharashtrian
hero Shivaji, who successfully resisted
the power of the Moghul Empire. In
more recent times the movement has
associated itself with Hindutva or
Hindu nationalism, projecting itself as
defending the interests of the larger
Hindu community against the “out-
siders,” in particular Muslims. The Shiv
Sena’s potential for violent action is well
known, and they have always been
ready to defend their interests with
physical force, as well as working
through official channels. The Sena’s
ability to provide “muscle power” has
given them political strength in
Maharashtra, both in the municipal
government of Bombay, and most
recently as a partner (with the Bharatiya
Janata Party) in running the state
government. This political strength
is being translated into a strong
presence in other areas, particularly
in labor unions, in which the Sena-
affiliated union is gaining greater
influence and membership. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Shiva
(auspicious) Along with the god Vishnu
and the Goddess, one of the three most
important deities in the Hindu pan-
theon. All three are notable for being vir-
tually absent from the Vedas, and their
collective rise to dominance (and the
gradual eclipse of the original Vedic
gods) points clearly to a definitive
change in the Hindu tradition. Of the
three, Shiva is not mentioned at all
in the Veda. He is identified with the
god Rudra, who first appears in a few of
the late Vedic hymns and who is later
identified in the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad as the single supreme deity
behind all things. The word Shiva
(“auspicious”) first appears in this
upanishad, but as an adjective modify-
ing the feminine noun body.
Despite Rudra/Shiva’s appearance in
the upanishad as a supreme divinity, his
position is not clear-cut. He is described
as a master of archery who dwells in the
mountains (and thus away from human
beings) and is implored not to use his
arrows to harm either man or beast. It is
certain that Rudra/Shiva is not a Vedic
deity, and some have claimed that his
roots lie in the ancient urban-cultural
center known as the Indus Valley civi-
lization, citing as evidence one of the
seals found in Harappa, an ancient city
of Pakistan, which shows a horned fig-
ure sitting cross-legged as if in medita-
tion. This identification is possible but
hardly compelling. A more likely possi-
bility is that he entered the pantheon as
a god worshiped by ascetics, who have
always been associated with mountain
dwellings. His connection with ascetics
is reinforced by several ascetic charac-
teristics attributed to Shiva, such as the
matted locks and ash-smeared body.
Ascetic origins would also account for
his marginal status among the gods,
since this would have rendered him an
“outsider” to Vedic sacrificial cult, which
was the “established” religion of the
time. Shiva’s dramatic entry into the
pantheon comes in the story of the
death of his wife Sati. In this story, his
[[633]]
Shiva
Statue of the god Shiva from the Kumbha Mela festival in Allahabad. Living outside of society with his hair
in matted locks and his body smeared with ash, Shiva is often regarded as the model for the Hindu ascetic.
[[634]]
Shivaga-Sindamani
father-in-law Daksha’s insulting remarks—
that Shiva was an ascetic with no money,
job, or family, and was unfit to join
respectable society—finally resulted in
the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice as a
sign of Shiva’s supremacy.
Shiva has retained this ambivalent,
sometimes marginal quality in his
iconography, his mythology, and his
character. Perhaps his most basic and
important characteristic is that he is a
divinity whose nature allows him to
move beyond the opposing forces (or
dualities) within himself and the world
by being at all times the possibility of
both forces at once. Shiva can represent
both the wild and dangerous side of life
and the respectable and refined side. On
the one hand, he is the typical ascetic,
with matted hair, ash-smeared body,
and a home on Mount Kailas in the
remote Himalayas. On the other hand,
he is Hindu society’s ideal for the good
husband, who dotes upon his wife
Parvati. His body is adorned with
snakes and clothed with a bloody ele-
phant skin, but he also wears the
Ganges River and the crescent moon,
which are associated with beauty, purity,
and auspiciousness. His mythic deeds
stress his overwhelming power, against
which no enemy can stand, and his sud-
den and sometimes impetuous temper,
seen best in the destruction of Kama,
the god of love; yet this sudden violence
contrasts with his grace and favor
toward his devotees (bhakta), by whom
he is given the name “quickly satisfied”
(Ashutosh) and to whom he will give
almost everything. Although he is por-
trayed as simple and without deceit (as
Bholanath, the “simple lord”), he is also
traditionally described as the expositor
of the tantras, the most secret and
hidden religious practice of all. This
transcendence of all opposites can be
seen in the images that commonly
represent him: in his form as Nataraja,
in which many of these contrary attrib-
utes are shown, or as Ardhanarishvara,
in which the image is half male and half
female. This transcendence of duality
is also visible in the linga, the
pillar-shaped object that is his symbolic
form, whose base and shaft are inter-
preted as symbolizing male and female
reproductive organs. Finally, one can
see this transcendence in the tantric
conception of the subtle body (the
system of psychic centers, or chakras,
that run throughout the human body),
in which religious practice aims for the
union of Shiva and Shakti. As Wendy
Doniger O’Flaherty points out, through
his actions Shiva embodies all the
contradictory possibilities for human
experience, and in mythic form provides
a resolution that one ordinary human
life can never provide.
In medieval times Shiva’s devotees
developed a doctrine of avatars (incar-
nations of Shiva who take the form of a
variety of saints, sages, and minor
deities who appear on earth to restore
balance and perform other necessary
acts), probably in response to the older
and better developed notion of avatars
of Vishnu. Unlike Vishnu’s avatars,
Shiva’s do not seem to have been a way
to create a place for smaller existing
deities in the larger pantheon. Of Shiva’s
twenty-one avatars, the most important
one is Hanuman, who is the only one
with a well-established independent
cult. The others were sages (such as
Durvasas) and important beings, but
the worship of Shiva’s avatars has never
upstaged the worship of Shiva himself,
as has often happened with Vishnu. For
further information on the mythology of
Shiva, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty
Shiva, 1981; and Stella Kramrisch, The
Presence of Shiva, 1981. See also Shaiva.
Shivaga-Sindamani
By far the latest of the three Tamil epics,
written perhaps in the late sixth century.
The story describes the adventures
of Shivaga, a man who excels at every
possible manly art, who with each
new challenge wins a new wife for
his harem but in the end renounces
everything to become a Jain monk.
Although the story clearly has a Jain
bias, the Shivaga-Sindamani paints a
[[635]]
Shivaji
Ascetics observing Shivaratri.
useful picture of contemporary south-
ern Indian life.
Shivaji
(1627–1680) Maratha chieftain who
carved out an independent kingdom in
western Maharashtra and Goa, and was
able to hold onto it despite the efforts of
the Moghul emperor Aurangzeb to take
it back. Shivaji’s father Shahji was a
Moghul governor in the city of Bijapur,
and Shivaji began his operations as a
robber chief there. He gained the sup-
port of the local Maratha people, and his
first important conquest was a hill fort
near the city of Pune. From there he
expanded his territory and consolidated
his power, building forts to hold the ter-
ritory. Shivaji was a devout Hindu,
which undoubtedly helped gain him
support from the common people. In
modern times his Hindu roots, and his
opposition to Moghul rule, have
[[636]]

transformed him into a Hindu national-
ist hero, particularly in Maharashtra. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Shivananda, Swami
(1887–1963) Hindu ascetic, teacher, and
founder of the Divine Life Society.
Shivananda’s first calling was to be a
doctor; after getting his degree, he spent
some time practicing medicine in
Malaysia, spurred by a passion to serve
others. Later in life he felt the call of
renunciation and, in 1924, settled in
Rishikesh, where he was based for the
rest of his life. Shivananda’s message
stressed the teachings of the Advaita
Vedanta school, which is devoted to a
belief in monism (the belief in a single
Ultimate Reality where all things are
united), and the practice of yoga for a
disciplined life. He saw his own mission
as teaching others, a mission fostered by
the Divine Life Society’s publications,Shiwalik Goddesses
which continue to be important today.
Shivananda’s learning and religious
charisma made him greatly respected,
and in keeping with his original voca-
tion, one of the charitable works spon-
sored by the Divine Life Society is a free
medical clinic. For further information
see David Miller, “The Divine Life
Society Movement,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Shiva Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
which were an important genre of smrti
texts and the repository of much of tra-
ditional Indian mythology. The smrtis,
or “remembered” texts, were a class of
literature, which, although deemed
important, were considered less author-
itative than the shrutis or “heard” texts.
In brief, the shrutis included the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, whereas the smrtis
included the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana, the dharma literature, the
Bhagavad Gita, and the puranas. The
puranas are the collection of all types of
sacred lore, from mythic tales to ritual
instruction to exaltation of various
sacred sites (tirthas) and actions. Most
of the puranas stress the worship of
one deity as supreme over all others
and as this one’s name clearly shows
it is focused on the worship of Shiva.
The Shiva Purana is one of the
longer and larger puranas. It gives an
exhaustive account of Shiva’s mythic
deeds—many of which have become
the common mythology for many
traditional Hindus—as well as instruc-
tions for how, where, and when Shiva is
to be worshiped.
Shivaratri
(“Night of Shiva”) The most important
annual festival for devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, celebrated on the four-
teenth day of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March).
Worshipers
of
Shiva on this night are said to receive
unlimited religious benefits. The obser-
vances for this festival fall into three
general categories: fasting (upavasa),
wakefulness, and worship. Those fast-
ing on Shivaratri must abstain from all
grains—which define the difference
between a “snack” and a “meal”—but
are free to eat all other things. During
the night observers stay awake, prefer-
ably at a temple, relating and listening to
Shiva’s mythic exploits, and worship
Shiva early the next morning. Shivaratri
is a major Indian festival, and in many
places the readings and discourses are
broadcast through loudspeakers, so
that those nearby may also share the
religious merit.
The charter myth for this festival
describes the power of any religious
observances performed on this day,
even if unknowingly. According to the
story, a hunter lost in the woods on the
evening of Shivaratri climbs a tree for
safety, and spends the night. Unknown
to him, at the base of the tree is a linga,
the pillar-shaped object which is Shiva’s
symbolic form. The hunter passes a cold
and miserable night, and through his
shivering shakes the tree, sending dew
and leaves from the tree as offerings
onto the linga; upon descending the tree
he kneels to pick up an arrow he has
dropped during the night and thus
kneels before the linga. Despite a life-
time of bad karma generated by his
livelihood as a hunter, the religious
merit from this unknowing observance
brought this hunter to the abode of
Shiva on his death, and to a later rebirth
as a king.
Shiwalik Goddesses
Local goddesses from the Shiwalik hills
separating the Himalayas from the
northern Indian plain. Some have little
importance beyond the borders of their
particular villages, whereas others have
become important regional deities. As
with all the goddesses of India, the
Shiwalik goddesses are considered to be
manifestations of the same feminine
divine energy—the Goddess. As one
[[637]]
Shiwalik Hills
sign of this identity, many of these sites
are claimed to be Shakti Pithas—places
where a part of the dismembered god-
dess Sati fell to earth and took form as a
different goddess. Shiwalik goddesses
are also thought of as relatives. Kathleen
Erndl mentions seven goddesses, known
as the Seven Sisters: Vaishno Devi,
Jwalamukhi, Vajreshvari Devi, Chinta-
purni, Naina Devi, Chamunda, and
Mansa Devi. Modern Hindi language
sources list nine—the seven just men-
tioned plus Shakumbhari Devi and
Kalika Devi. This group of nine is scat-
tered in three different Indian states
along the Shiwalik Range: Seven are in
Himachal Pradesh, Vaishno Devi is in
Jammu and Kashmir, and Shakumbhari
Devi is in Uttar Pradesh. The pantheon
here is fairly flexible, and the goddesses
mentioned in these lists will probably
vary over time, partly reflecting the suc-
cess or failure to establish the holiness
of these sites. For further information on
the Shiwalik goddesses and worship of
the Mother Goddess in northwestern
India, see Kathleen Erndl, Victory To The
Mother, 1993. See also pitha.
Shiwalik Hills
Himalayan foothills running through
the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh,
Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and
Kashmir. The hills are an ecological
transition zone between the plains
and the mountains but have their own
religious ecology as well. Whereas the
sites high in the Himalayas are often
associated with Shiva, the primary
sacred sites (tirthas) in the Shiwaliks are
associated with the Goddess. See also
Shiwalik goddesses.
Shraddha
(“faithful”) Ancestral memorial rite, per-
formed either for one specific person
(ekoddishta), or for a group in which the
primary beneficiaries were one’s three
paternal ancestors (parvana).
An ekoddishta shraddha is usually
first performed on the eleventh day after
[[638]]

a person’s death, although it may be
repeated on the anniversary of the
death. It is also usually performed every
year during the Pitrpaksha, a two-week
period specifically devoted to such rites,
on the lunar day during this period that
corresponds to the lunar day of death.
A parvana shraddha can be per-
formed on a number of different occa-
sions, for a number of different rea-
sons. In the dharma literature and its
commentaries, shraddhas are classi-
fied as falling in all three categories of
ritual action: nitya, naimittika, and
kamya. Certain shraddhas are obliga-
tory (nitya) because they are pre-
scribed for certain particular times,
such as during the Pitrpaksha. Other
shraddhas are occasional (naimittika)
because they are necessary only under
certain conditions, such as the obliga-
tion to give a tirtha shraddha when
one visits a pilgrimage place (tirtha).
Finally, certain shraddhas are freely
performed because of the desire (kama)
for certain benefits from them—usually
conceived as the well-being of one’s
ancestors—and these are desiderative
(kamya) shraddhas.
Whatever the motive for giving the
shraddha, the general procedure always
has two particular features: symbolically
feeding one’s ancestor(s) by offering
balls of cooked grain (pindas), and feed-
ing real food to a group of brahmins (the
group with the highest social status in
Hinduism) representing one’s ancestors.
Each of these parts is given a great deal
of ritual elaboration, and there is con-
siderable disagreement about which
should come first, but in modern times
offering the pindas generally precedes
the meal. Many texts exalt the spiritual
merits generated from feeding brah-
mins, but this is hardly surprising, since
most of these texts were written by brah-
mins, and for many brahmins living at
pilgrimage places these shraddhas were
(and remain) an important part of their
livelihood. However, many people deem
this livelihood parasitic, and it is also
potentially inauspicious, since it is
gained through rites performed for theShrauta Sutras
dead. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane, A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.
Shraddhanand, Swami
(b. Lala Munshi Ram, d. 1926) Key figure
in the development of the Arya Samaj, a
modern Hindu reformist movement.
Shraddanand was born in Punjab and
got a law degree from the Government
College in Lahore, but was most influen-
tial through his support for the Arya
Samaj’s educational institutions. His
greatest work was establishing the
Gurukul Kangri near the sacred city of
Haridwar in 1901. The Gurukul
(“teacher’s household”) was a boarding
school where Arya Samaj children could
be raised with “progressive” Arya values,
far from the corrupting influences of tra-
ditional mainstream Hindu society. This
model was based on the Vedas, the ear-
liest Hindu religious texts, which the
Arya Samaj took as the sole religious
authority, and in which a student would
live as a member of his teacher’s family.
Educationally, the curriculum stressed
the arts and sciences necessary for a
“modern” education, but also traditional
Sanskrit learning, particularly of the
Vedas. Shraddhanand became a Sanyasi
in 1917 but continued to support politi-
cal causes, particularly Indian social and
political leader Mohandas Gandhi’s
[[1919]]
 call for non-cooperation with the
British government. His fervor and
strength of character made him an
unpopular figure, and he was assassi-
nated by a Muslim in 1926.
Shramana
(from the Sanskrit verb shram, “to
strive”) General term denoting religious
adepts from the middle of the first mil-
lennium before the common era whose
beliefs stressed renunciation, ascetic
practices, and the search for intuitive
insights. Shramana religious practice
was individualist, experiential, free-
form, and independent of society. All of
these qualities put them in religious
competition with the brahmin priests,
whose practice stressed mastery of
sacred texts and performing enormously
complex rituals; the need for sponsors
for these rituals made brahmin religion
“establishment” religion, serving its
patron classes. Indian grammarians use
the pair shramana and brahmin to illus-
trate typically bitter opponents, along
with examples such as mongoose and
cobra, and their difference seems to be
between a religious model stressing
individual charisma (shramana), and
one stressing highly trained technical
expertise (brahmin). Part of the shra-
mana tradition remained outside the
Hindu fold by virtue of resolutely reject-
ing the authority of the Vedas; the Jains,
Buddhists, Ajivikas, and other religious
groups developed as a result of this
rejection of the Vedas. Part of the shra-
mana tradition was absorbed into tradi-
tional Hinduism in the dharma litera-
ture, which found a place for renunciant
asceticism in the form of the Sanyasi,
the last of the four traditional stages
of life (ashramas). For further informa-
tion on the shramanas and the
development of this tradition, see
Padmanabh S. Jaini, “Sramanas: Their
Conflict with Brahmanical Society,” in
Joseph Elder (ed.), Chapters in Indian
Civilization, 1970.
Shrauta Sutras
(“aphorisms on Vedic rituals”) A set of
brief sayings (4th c. B.C.E.) explaining the
ritual instructions for performing the
public sacrifices prescribed in the
Vedas, the earliest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts. Such sacrifi-
cial instructions had been prescribed in
the Brahmana literature—itself consid-
ered part of the Veda—but with the pas-
sage of time the Brahmanas had become
too complex and difficult to understand.
The Shrauta Sutras were essentially
manuals for the priests presiding over
the Vedic sacrifices, composed to ensure
that the sacrifices would be performed
correctly. Aside from instructions for
[[639]]
Shravan
performing the sacrifice, the Shrauta
Sutras also contained an appendix with
the exact measurements for the sacred
altar, known as the Sulva Sutras. In the-
ory, the Shrauta Sutras were the first part
of a Kalpa Sutra, which would also con-
tain prescriptions for domestic rites
(Grhya Sutras) and appropriate human
behavior (Dharma Sutras), with each
Kalpa Sutra being connected to one of
the four Vedas. But in practice the story
of the Shrauta Sutras is far more
complex, since aside from the three
complete Kalpa Sutras that have
survived, by Apastamba, Baudhayana,
and Hiranyakeshin, there are other
Shrauta Sutras, indicating a more
independent composition.
Shravan
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Shravan is the fifth month
in the lunar year, usually falling within
July and August. In northern India
Shravan is associated with the rains, the
breaking of the heat and revival of the
land, and a general feeling of release.
The major holidays in Shravan are Nag
Panchami, Kamika Ekadashi, Tulsidas
Jayanti, Putrada Ekadashi, and Raksha
Bandhan. In addition, the entire
month is deemed sacred to the god
Shiva, with all Mondays and the
Shravan Vrat marked out as times for
particular observances.
Shravan Vrat
Religious vow (vrat) performed during
the entire lunar month of Shravan
(July–August), which is dedicated to the
god Shiva. During this month devotees
(bhakta) will perform various acts of
homage, abstinence, and worship,
although the strictness of this obser-
vance depends largely on individual
inclination. Some worshipers observe a
vow on each Monday of Shravan to wor-
ship Shiva (Monday is the day of the
week over which he presides). The
observant will fast (upavasa) during the
[[640]]

day, worship Shiva and members of his
“family” (Ganesh, Parvati, and Nandi),
and sometimes stay up late into the
night reciting Shiva’s mythic deeds.
Some devotees will also refrain
from cutting their hair and shaving
their beards during this month, in
imitation of Shiva’s primary identity as
the great ascetic.
Another observance falling in
Shravan is the festival of kanvars, in
which devotees draw pots of water from
the Ganges, suspend them from a bam-
boo pole (kanvar), and carry this water
to a Shiva temple, where it is offered to
Shiva. This practice occurs in many
places throughout northern India, but
the most famous place is at Deoghar in
the state of Bihar. There Shiva is present
in his form as Vaidyanath (“Lord of
Physicians”), and the image of
Vaidyanath at Deoghar is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas (images considered
especially sacred). Pilgrims going to
Deoghar draw their water from the
Ganges at Sultanganj, and then walk to
Deoghar to offer the water, a distance of
over sixty miles. This particular obser-
vance combines devotion to God with
the willingness to suffer hardship; it is
often performed to fulfill a vow made
when asking for some divine favor. See
also Solah Somvar Vrat.
Shri
(“auspicious,” “bringing good fortune”)
Epithet of the goddess Lakshmi, reflect-
ing her identification with luck, fortune,
and prosperity. See Lakshmi.
Shri Aurobindo
Name taken by the Indian philosopher
and social activist Aurobindo Ghose after
retiring from political life to become an
ascetic. See Aurobindo Ghose.
Shrichakra
Symbolic diagram (yantra) used in wor-
ship by the Shrividya school, a branch
of the secret, ritually based religious
practice known as tantra. TheShrinathji
Shrichakra is a set of nine interlocking
triangles with four pointing up and five
pointing down. The figure is surrounded
by a double series of lotus petals, then
an enclosing circle, and finally angular
exterior walls. In the center of the dia-
gram is a single point known as the
bindu, representing the ultimate divinity
that is the source of all things. The
shrichakra is considered a subtle form of
the goddess Lalita Tripurasundari, a
goddess who is identified with different
local goddesses throughout southern
India. Lalita Tripurasundari is consid-
ered a “textual” goddess since she
appears as an object of worship in the
Shrichakra diagram but has no temple
or image. The Shrichakra is used as a rit-
ual aid during the rite known as
samharakrama, in which the adept
symbolically destroys the external
world and ideas of a separate Self to
become completely identified with
this goddess, who is considered the
source of all reality. For extensive
information on the Shrichakra, see
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Shrichandra
(b. 1494–1612?) Historical founder of the
Udasi (“indifferent”) ascetic community.
Shrichandra was the elder son of Guru
Nanak, the first of the Sikh community’s
ten gurus. By all accounts, Shrichandra
was a devout and pious man, but Nanak
passed over Shrichandra to designate
one of his followers, Angad, as the second
Sikh guru. According to tradition this was
because Guru Nanak, believing that his
followers should live married lives in reg-
ular society, disapproved of Shrichandra’s
status as ascetic. Due to his pedigree and
his piety, Shrichandra gained a consider-
able following of his own, but the Udasis
have always been considered as belong-
ing in the Hindu fold. During the
Kumbha Mela, an important bathing
(snana) festival held in different places in
northern India, the Udasis march third in
the bathing procession, behind the
Sanyasis and the Bairagis.
Shrikrishnavali
(“Series [of poems] to Krishna”) Series
of sixty-one short poems dedicated to
the god Krishna, written in the Braj
Bhasha form of Hindi by the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?). This collection is
unusual, since Tulsidas is renowned as a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Rama, and
most of his literary work describes
Rama’s exploits. The Shrikrishnavali is a
poetic cycle about Krishna’s life, so it
begins with poems devoted to Krishna’s
childhood and youth in the Braj region.
Most of the text, however, describes the
sorrow of the cow herd girls (gopis) after
Krishna’s departure for his kingdom in
Mathura, and their scornful rejection of
Krishna’s messenger Uddhava, who tries
to convince them that since Krishna is
the supreme deity, he is everywhere.
This work is an example of the ecumeni-
cal, or universal, tendencies found
throughout Tulsidas’s work. Not only
did he compose poems in praise
of another deity, thus transcending
sectarian barriers, but he also tran-
scended linguistic barriers by writing
these poems in Braj Bhasha, the most
widely read language of his time, rather
than his own native Avadhi.
Shrinathji
The name of a particular image of the
god Krishna, the presiding deity of the
Shrinathji temple in Nathdwara,
Rajasthan. According to tradition, the
image was originally hidden on top of
Mount Govardhan, a famous mountain
in the Braj region that is mythically
associated with Krishna’s humiliation of
the storm-god Indra. The image’s loca-
tion was revealed in a dream to
Vallabhacharya, the founder of the reli-
gious community known as the Pushti
Marg. Vallabhacharya built a temple to
house the image on Mount Govardhan,
and his descendants have remained
Shrinathji’s hereditary servants since
that time. The image was taken to
Rajasthan in 1669, a move prompted by
fears that it would be destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb. According
[[641]]
Shringeri
Shrirangam, an island in the Cauvery River, contains the Ranganathaswamy Temple,
dedicated to the god Vishnu.
to tradition Shrinathji revealed his
wish to stay in Nathdwara by sinking
his wagon’s wheels deep into the earth,
so that it could not go further. A new
temple was erected and dedicated in
[[1672]]
, and the image has remained there
ever since.
Whether or not one accepts the claim
of the divine mandate, much of the story
seems reasonable. Given the proximity
of Braj to Agra, the Moghul capital,
keepers of well-known images might
have been concerned about their safety,
and since the neighboring state of
Rajasthan was controlled by the
Moghuls’ Hindu vassals, this would have
been an obvious place to go. Even today
Nathdwara is in a remote and thinly set-
tled region of Rajasthan, which indicates
that in earlier times it would have been a
place of refuge. The Nathdwara temple
is particularly important to the Pushti
[[642]]

Marg, a religious community devoted
to the god Krishna, who play the major
role in administering it. For more
information see Rajendra Jindel, Culture
Of a Sacred Town, 1976. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Shringeri
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in eastern
Karnataka, about 160 miles west of
Bangalore. Although Shringeri is a very
small town, it is religiously significant as
the home of the Shringeri Math, one
of the four Dashanami maths, the
monastic centers believed to have
been established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The ascetics of the
Shringeri math have a reputation for
very strict adherence to traditional prac-
tice, and the town has a long standing as
a center for religious learning.Shri Sampraday
Shringeri Math
One of the four maths or monastic cen-
ters traditionally believed to have been
established by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya; the others are the
Jyotir Math, Sharada Math, and
Govardhan Math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Shringeri Math
is in the southern quarter, in the city of
Shringeri in the southern Indian state of
Karnataka. Shankaracharya is tradi-
tionally cited as the founder of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, the most presti-
gious Hindu ascetic order. The
Dashanami (“ten names”) ascetics are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, who
are divided into ten divisions, each with
a different name. These ten divisions are
organized into four larger organizational
groups—Anandawara, Bhogawara, Bhuri-
wara, and Kitawara—each of which has
two or three of the ten divisions, and
each of which is associated with one of
the four sacred centers. Of these, the
Shringeri Math is associated with the
Bhuriwara group.
Shrirangam
Island in the Cauvery River, just north of
the town of Tiruchirappalli in the state
of Tamil Nadu. The site is most famous
for the Ranganathaswamy Temple, ded-
icated to the god Vishnu in his form as
Ranganatha, who is sleeping on the
back of his serpent couch Shesha in the
sea of cosmic dissolution (pralaya). The
temple is built in the Dravida style of
architecture, in which the temple build-
ings are of modest height but cover an
immensely large area and are surrounded
by a boundary wall with massive towers
(gopurams) over each wall’s central
gateway. In the temple’s outer zones one
often finds shops and houses, making
such temples veritable cities in their
own right. The Ranganathaswamy tem-
ple has a series of seven concentric pro-
cessional streets, making it one of the
largest temples in India. It was built in
stages by the various dynasties that
controlled this part of southern India—
Chera, Pandya, Chola, Hoysala, and
Vijayanagar—although the bulk of the
construction was done by the last two.
Since Vishnu’s image is that of the divine
king, it is hardly surprising that each of
these regional dynasties patronized this
site, as a way of using this divine
imagery to support and validate their
own right to rule.
Shrirangapatnam
Demolished fortress city just outside the
city of Mysore in the state of Karnataka.
Shrirangapatnam formerly served as the
capital of Tipu Sultan (r. 1782–1799), the
last ruler of Mysore. Throughout his
reign he fought against the encroach-
ment of outside powers. However, in
[[1799]]
 he unsuccessfully took up arms
against the British and was killed in bat-
tle, leaving the city largely destroyed.
The city got its name from a temple
there to the god Ranganatha, a form of
Vishnu in which he is sleeping on his
serpent couch Shesha in the sea of cos-
mic dissolution (pralaya). The temple
survived the demolition and is still func-
tioning today. Ranganatha is considered
a divine king, and his most famous
image, on the island of Shrirangam in
Tamil Nadu, has strong associations
with southern Indian kings and king-
ship. Even though Tipu was a Muslim,
invoking Ranganatha’s powerful sym-
bolism would have been an astute polit-
ical move, to legitimate his rule in the
eyes of his Hindu subjects.
Shri Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday)
of the Bairagi Naga ascetics. The Bairagi
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, organized in military fashion
into different anis or “armies.” Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century
their primary occupation was as merce-
nary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these have largely disappeared in con-
temporary times. The Shri Sampraday
[[643]]
Shrishaila
traces its spiritual lineage through the
poet-saint Ramananda to the southern
Indian philosopher Ramanuja, who is
claimed to have been Ramananda’s guru.
This claim can also be seen in the name
of the sampraday, since Ramanuja’s fol-
lowers, the Shrivaishnavas, focus their
worship on Vishnu and Shri (Lakshmi).
Yet the Ramanandi ascetics worship an
entirely different pair of deities—Rama
and Sita—and the claim of any connec-
tions between the Ramanandis and the
Shrivaishnavas was formally renounced
at the Ujjain Kumbha Mela in 1921, at
the insistence of the Shrivaishnavas. As
with another Bairagi order, the Brahma
Sampraday, the claim to be connected
to a famous religious figure seems to be
a way to gain the authority and prestige
of an ancient and established tradition.
Even without this claim, the Shri
Sampraday is the largest and the most
important of the Bairagi Naga orders.
For further information see Peter van
der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988.
Shrishaila
(“holy mountain”) Sacred mountain in
the center of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, about 185 miles south and
slightly east of Hyderabad. The site is
remote and difficult to reach but is
famous for a temple sacred to the god
Shiva, in his manifestation as Malli-
karjuna, “[Lord] White as Jasmine.”
Shiva’s image as Mallikarjuna is in the
form of a linga, the pillar-shaped image
that is his symbolic form, and the
Mallikarjuna linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites deemed
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is uniquely present.
Shrivaishnava
Southern Indian religious community
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu and Shri (Lakshmi), and whose
religious life is rooted in the devotional
hymns of the Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
[[644]]

centuries. All the Alvars were devotees of
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. Two cen-
turies later, the Alvars’ devotional out-
pouring was organized and system-
atized by the philosopher Ramanuja,
considered the Shrivaishnava founder.
Ramanuja was convinced that Brahman,
or Supreme Reality, was a personal
deity, rather than an impersonal
abstract principle, and was also con-
vinced that devotion was the most
important form of religious practice.
Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, his philo-
sophical position, stressed both of these
convictions, and thus opposed the
Advaita Vedanta school founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, which
stressed that the Supreme Being was
impersonal and that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path. In the time
after Ramanuja the Shrivaishnava com-
munity split into two smaller groups, the
Tengalai and the Vadagalai. The schism
stemmed from a disagreement over
whether human action was necessary to
attain final liberation, or whether the
hope came in complete surrender (pra-
patti) to God’s grace; the Vadagalais held
the former position, and the Tengalais
the latter.
In practice, the Shrivaishnava com-
munity has been strongly influenced by
the doctrine of divine “emanations”
originated by the Pancharatra religious
community, particularly the notion that
a properly consecrated image becomes
a form of the deity itself. Shrivaishnava
piety has tended to center around
temples, and particularly the service of
the temple’s image, which is considered
a genuine form of the deity. Given
this stress on learning and temple-
based worship, it is not surprising
that the community has been dominated
by brahmins, and the few non-
brahmins in the community have
distinctly inferior status. For further
information see K. Rangachari, The
Sri Vaisnava Brahmans, 1931; andShuddadvaita
John Braisted Carman, The Theology of
Ramanuja, 1974.based religious practice known as
tantra. See Shrichakra.
ShrivatsaShrutashravas
An auspicious mark on the god Vishnu’s
chest, also found on Vishnu’s form as
Krishna, which is sometimes described
as a mole and sometimes as a curl of
hair. In statues and pictures, the
Shrivatsa is usually portrayed as a four-
petaled flower, and it is believed to be
the kaustubha jewel, which was one of
the precious things churned from the
Ocean of Milk along with the goddess
Lakshmi, the wishing-cow Surabhi, and
amrta, the nectar of immortality. See
also Tortoise avatar.In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Krishna’s paternal
aunt and the mother of Shishupala.
Shrividya
Southern Indian school of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
in which the principal deity is the
goddess Lalita Tripurasundari. The
Shrividya tradition is noted for its ritual
use of the shrichakra, a particular sym-
bolic diagram (yantra) composed of a
series of interlocking triangles. The
Shrichakra ritual is known as samhara-
krama, and is a systematic ritual decon-
struction of the perceivable world and
all illusions of duality, to attain union
with the single true reality. The interior
counterpart to this exterior ritual is the
practice of kundalini yoga, which is
based on the tantric idea of the subtle
body—the six psychic centers (chakras)
running along the spine—and seeks to
gain ultimate union within the aspirant’s
own body by bringing together the
microcosmic forms of the deities Shiva
and Shakti that exist within the body.
For a careful and considered picture of
the Shrividya tradition, see Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Shriyantra
Another name for the Shrichakra, a
symbolic diagram (yantra) used in
worship by the Shrividya school, a
particular branch of the secret, ritually
Shruti
(“[that which is] heard”) The most
authoritative type of Hindu sacred liter-
ature, made up of all the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts. The Vedas are
generally considered to have four types
of texts: the hymns to the gods known as
samhitas, the ritual manuals called the
Brahmanas, and the speculative texts
known as the Aranyakas and the
Upanishads. The term comes from the
traditional Hindu belief that these texts
were not composed by human beings
but are based in the primordial vibra-
tions of the cosmos itself. The ancient
sages, whose faculties of perception had
been sharpened through persistent reli-
gious practice, were able to “hear” and
understand these vibrations, and trans-
mitted them to others in a lineage of
learning. Thus, the belief that their ori-
gin is nonhuman makes the shruti the
highest religious authority.
Shuddadvaita
(“pure monism”) Philosophical school
first propounded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531). Vallabha called his school
shuddadvaita, or “pure monism,” to dis-
tinguish it from the Advaita Vedanta
school founded by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The latter school pro-
pounds “nondual” (advaita) monism, in
its claim that a single Ultimate Reality
lies behind all things, and that all things
are merely differing forms of that reality.
The Advaitins call this single reality
Brahman, which they conceive as form-
less, impersonal, and having no defining
attributes except for being, conscious-
ness, and bliss (sacchidananda). In the
Advaita understanding, since all
conceptions of particular deities have
[[645]]
Shuddhi
specific attributes, they are thus condi-
tioned forms of the ultimate Brahman.
In fact, any assumption that the world
as it appears is real is a fundamental
misunderstanding that ultimately
causes human beings to be trapped
in karmic bondage, reincarnation
(samsara), and suffering.
Shankaracharya’s philosophical posi-
tion was based primarily on the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
texts, and particularly on the
Upanishads, the speculative texts that
are the latest part of the Vedas.
Vallabhacharya used both of these
sources in framing his Shuddadvaita
school, but also used the Bhagavata
Purana, which he considered to be of
equal authority. The Bhagavata Purana
is one of the later sectarian collections
known as puranas. It is the most impor-
tant source for the worship of the god
Krishna, whom Vallabha considered to
be the ultimate manifestation of the
Supreme Being, rather than the unqual-
ified
Brahman
promoted
by
Shankaracharya. Aside from promoting
a personal conception of the deity over
an impersonal conception, another dif-
ference in the two schools concerned
the status of the world. For
Vallabhacharya, the world as perceived
is not an illusion but is real, because it
and human beings have both evolved
from God through the exercise of his
supreme power. Krishna is conceived
in the traditional threefold divine aspect
as being–consciousness–bliss. Living
beings possess being and conscious-
ness, but not the divine bliss, whereas
the material, nonliving, world has
only being. Since this conception
gives real value to the everyday
world, Vallabhacharya described it as
“pure monism.”
In Vallabhacharya’s system God is the
inner controller of all souls, which
makes human beings dependent on
God for thinking and perception
(pratyaksha). This dependence on God
highlights the importance of grace,
which he refers to as pushti, meaning
“that which nourishes the soul.”
[[646]]

Because of this emphasis on grace,
Vallabhacharya’s religious community is
also known as the Pushti Marg. The
Pushti Marg believes that God’s favor is
gained through devotion (bhakti),
which is open to all and for which there
are no prerequisites. The emphasis
on devotion has marginalized all
other forms of religious practice, and
the Pushti Marg is particularly known
for rejecting all ascetic endeavors,
such as celibacy, fasting (upavasa), or
renunciation. Its members tend to be
householders coming from merchant
families, particularly from the state of
Gujarat. The community’s primary
temple is at Nathdwara in the state of
Rajasthan. For further information see
Richard Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacarya, 1976.
Shuddhi
(“purification”) Any ritual purification
that removes impurities and thus
returns one to a state of ritual purity.
In a more specialized context the
term denotes the “reconversion” back
to Hinduism of people who had
either converted to another religion
or who had adopted practices
characteristic of other religious tradi-
tions. This practice was first instituted
in the 1890s by the reformist Arya
Samaj, led by Swami Dayanand
Saraswati. There was a tremendous
stir in the Sikh community when several
Sikhs were a part of a group thus
“purified,” and in Sikh accounts
this
threat
of
reabsorption
into the Hindu community was one
of the major forces behind the Singh
Sabha movement, which defined
the Sikhs as a separate religious commu-
nity. In modern times this practice has
been employed by the Hindu nationalist
organization Vishva Hindu Parishad,
which has used it to “purify” certain
groups who had adopted some
Islamic practices.Shukra
Shudra
Among the four major social groups
(varnas) in the traditional Hindu soci-
ety, the shudras are the lowest and least
influential. In this model, the shudras’
social function was to serve all the oth-
ers. This low social status is reflected in
the creation story known as the Purusha
Sukta, in which the shudras are
described as being created from the
Primeval Man’s feet. The feet are the
lowest and basest part of the body, and
the shudra was correspondingly seen as
the lowest level of caste Hindu society.
Unlike members of the “twice-born”
varnas—brahmin, kshatriya, and
vaishya—whose adolescent males were
entitled to have a ritual second birth
that entitled them to study the Veda,
shudras were always once-born, and
thus forbidden to study or even to hear
the Veda. In practice the status of shu-
dras differed widely from region to
region—in southern India, many of the
land-owning jatis (endogamous social
subgroups) were shudras, and they were
very influential communities. At the
very least, they were accorded a defini-
tive place in caste Hinduism, unlike the
untouchables, who were considered
completely impure, usually because of
their hereditary occupations.
Shudraka
(early 5th c.) Playwright and author of
the Mrcchakatika (“The Little Clay
Cart”). This drama describes the love
between a poor but noble brahmin,
Charudatta, and a wealthy but virtuous
courtesan, Vasantasena, set in the con-
text of a complicated political intrigue. It
is notable for its detailed portrayal of
everyday urban life, exemplified by the
little clay cart, which is a child’s toy. It
has been translated into several lan-
guages, and is periodically performed
for modern American audiences.
Shuka
(“parrot”) In Hindu mythology, a sage
whose life story upholds the traditional
doctrine of the four stages of life (ashra-
mas). Shuka was the son of the sage
Vyasa, born when Vyasa had a seminal
emission upon seeing a celestial nymph
(apsara) in the form of a parrot. From
boyhood Shuka was interested only in
spiritual life and had the firm desire
never to marry, but despite intensive
spiritual study he could not find con-
tentment. He eventually decided to visit
the sage-king Janaka, who advised
Shuka that he could rightly consider
renunciation only after having married
and raised a family. Shuka returned
home to his father and lived the house-
holder’s life; later in life he took
up renunciation again and became
perfectly realized.
Shuka Sampraday
Another name for the Charanadasi reli-
gious community, since their founder
Charanadas was believed to have
received initiation from the sage Shuka.
See Charanadasi.
Shukla Paksha
(“light half”) Name denoting the waxing
half of a lunar month, so called because
the moon’s light increases every night.
Shukra
In Hindu mythology, the religious
teacher (guru) of the type of demons
known as asuras. Shukra is a well-
known figure who appears most promi-
nently in the tale of the Vamana avatar.
In this tale, the Asura king Bali is per-
forming a great sacrifice. He is
approached by the god Vishnu, who has
taken the form of a dwarf (vamana), and
asks Bali for three paces of land to build
a sacrificial altar. Shukra suspects a
trick, and warns Bali not to grant it, but
Bali ignores Shukra’s cautionary advice.
As soon as Bali grants the gift, the dwarf
grows immensely large. With his first
two steps Vishnu measures out the cos-
mos, and with his third pushes Bali
down into the underworld, where he is
allowed to reign as king.
[[647]]
Shula
The god Shiva carrying a shula, or lance, beside his wife Parvati.
The type of shula with which Shiva is associated is the trishul, or trident.
Shula
A lance or pike; one of the characteristic
weapons in Hindu iconography. The
most famous example of this is the tri-
dent (trishul), which has three points,
although the center one may be larger
than the side ones. This weapon is most
intimately associated with Shiva, but it
is also commonly carried by certain
powerful forms of the Goddess. This
may reflect her charter myth, in which
she was formed from the collected radi-
ance of all the gods and received dupli-
cates of their weapons from all of them.
The lance with a single blade is associated
with the god Skanda, particularly in his
[[648]]

southern Indian manifestation as
Murugan. When carried by Skanda-
Murugan, the lance is usually called
shakti (“power”), rather than shula.
Shumbha
In Hindu mythology, demon killed by
the goddess Kali in the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important text for
the mythology of the Goddess. Together
with his brother Nishumbha, Shumbha
is a general in the army of a demon
named Mahishasura, the figure whom
the Goddess takes form to destroy. Due
to a divine boon given to Mahishasura,Shvetashvatara Upanishad
Shumbha and Nishumbha are able to
conquer the gods and assume control of
heaven, but they are unable to resist the
power of the Goddess.
Shurpanakha
([having] “nails [like] winnowing-fans”)
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Shurpanakha is the
sister of Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Although she is a minor charac-
ter in the epic, she plays a pivotal role in
advancing the action of the story. As
Ravana’s sister, Shurpanakha is a demon
woman of high status, and is free to
choose her own husband according to
her inclinations. As she roams through
the forest one day, she happens to see
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, and is
immediately smitten by his handsome
form. Assuming the shape of a beautiful
woman, she approaches him and
expresses her desire for him. Rama tells
her that since he is already married, his
brother Lakshmana will be a more
appropriate match for her. When
Lakshmana gives her reasons why he
too cannot marry her, Shurpanakha
becomes angry. Realizing that Rama’s
wife Sita is the real impediment to her
desires, Shurpanakha tries to harm her,
and in the struggle that follows,
Lakshmana mutilates her by cutting off
her ears and her nose. Shrieking with
pain and humiliation, Shurpanakha
returns to her brother Ravana’s court,
who swears that her insult will be
avenged. After their brothers Khara and
Dushana are killed in a direct attack on
Rama, Ravana decides to get revenge by
kidnapping Sita, an action that eventu-
ally causes his own death.
Shvetaketu
A character in the Chandogya Upan-
ishad, one of the speculative texts that
form the latest stratum of the Vedas.
In the upanishad, Shvetaketu is the
son of Uddalaka Aruni, and a para-
digm for a seeker of knowledge.
Shvetaketu’s education also symbolizes
the conception of true knowledge found
in the Upanishads and the way that this
differs from earlier conceptions.
According to a story in the upanishad’s
sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent away by
his father to study the Vedas, and when
he returns twelve years later having
mastered all the Vedas, he incorrectly
considers himself learned. Shvetaketu’s
father punctures his arrogance, showing
him the difference between memoriza-
tion and true knowledge, by asking
Shvetaketu questions about the nature
of the cosmos. When Shvetaketu cannot
answer these, he admits his ignorance
and accepts instruction from his father
on the nature of the Self (atman). This
instruction contains the teaching “That
thou art” (tat tvam asi). This is one of
the “great statements” (mahavakya) in
Indian philosophy, and asserts the
ultimate nondifference between Brahman
and atman, the cosmos and the indi-
vidual Self.
Shvetashvatara Upanishad
A text generally regarded as one of the
latest upanishads, the speculative reli-
gious texts that themselves form the
most recent stratum of the Vedas. This
judgment is based on both the Shvet-
ashvatara Upanishad’s form and on its
content. Stylistically, the earliest upan-
ishads tend to be written in prose, or
prose mixed with verse, whereas the
later upanishads, including the Shvet-
ashvatara, are completely in verse. In
terms of content, the earlier upanishads
tend to be long and rambling, whereas
in the later ones the ideas are far more
concise and clearly developed. The
Shvetashvatara Upanishad’s most origi-
nal idea is its description of the
Supreme Being in completely theistic
terms, in contrast to the abstract,
impersonal representations in the earlier
upanishads. It identifies Ultimate
Reality as the god Rudra, who was later
identified with the god Shiva, one of the
most important modern Hindu deities.
The text is also notable for an explicit
description of the process and results of
[[649]]
Shyam
yoga, which is the first known written
explanation of this tradition.
Although it is best noted for these
new ideas, the upanishad also reveals
continuity with the older tradition. The
second chapter begins with an extended
invocation to the god Savitr (Surya),
the sun, using verses drawn directly
from Vedic texts composed a thousand
years earlier. Such anachronisms
indicate that there was no clear dividing
line between the four differing types
of Vedic text—samhita, Brahmana,
Aranyaka, and upanishad—but rather
that these textual styles were composed
in overlapping periods.
Shyam
(“black”) Epithet of the god Krishna,
based on the dark color of his skin.
See Krishna.
Siddha
(“perfected one”) Name for a religious
adept who is believed to have attained
the perfect knowledge, enlightenment,
and ultimate spiritual realization.
Siddhapith
(“seat of the perfected”) Name denoting
a site believed to have particular power
in conferring spiritual attainments upon
those who carry out religious practices
there. This power is usually tied to a
mythic charter in which a deity became
resident at the site—and is thus still pre-
sent to assist people—but such sites
have often been further sanctified by the
presence of charismatic ascetics whose
lives and spiritual discipline serve as
examples to others.
Siddhasana
(“perfected posture”) One of the com-
mon sitting postures (asana) used for
meditation. In this position one foot
(often the left) is placed with the heel in
the area between the anus and genitals,
with the other foot resting on the oppo-
site calf, turned so that the heel is
[[650]]

straight up. This is called the “perfected”
posture partly because of its difficulty—
only those perfected in yoga can do it—
but also because it is believed to bring
substantial spiritual benefits.
Siddhi
(“attainment”) The most common word
used to denote a superhuman power
or faculty. The siddhis are first referred
to in yoga’s founding text, the Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali (3.45), and are
traditionally said to number eight:
minuteness (anima), lightness (lagh-
ima), greatness (madhima), acquisition
(prapti), irresistible will (prakamyam),
control (vashitvam), superiority (ishit-
vam), and suppression of desire
(kamavasayitvam).
The possession of such siddhis is
generally seen as the evidence of high
spiritual attainment, but the attitude
toward the powers is mixed. They give
one great abilities, but they are also seen
as being highly seductive, since they can
be used for both good and evil. The abil-
ity to keep from being beguiled by them
is the true sign of spiritual maturity, and
a spiritually immature person could eas-
ily fall into using them for selfish pur-
poses. For this reason, religious aspi-
rants are discouraged from aiming to
gain such powers, since the very act of
seeking is considered a selfish desire. In
contrast, when one has gained such
powers as a by-product of spiritual
attainment, one is believed to be able to
keep them in proper perspective.
Simantonnayana Samskara
Traditionally, the third of the life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), and the last of
the prenatal samskaras. This was per-
formed when the pregnancy was further
advanced, although various writers gave
differing times for this. The major ele-
ment in this rite is the husband parting
the hair of his wife, supposedly to pro-
tect her from the misfortune and black
magic that are supposed to plague preg-
nant women. One can also interpretSinhastha Mela
parting the hair as symbolizing an easy
delivery, and since this was a rite of pro-
tection, it would also give the expectant
mother psychological assurance that
everything would be all right. One bit of
evidence supporting this interpretation
is that many of the dharma literature
writers classify this samskara as being
for the woman rather than the unborn
child, and as only needing to be per-
formed during the first pregnancy. This
samskara is seldom performed in
modern times.
Simhakarna
(“lion’s ear”) Another name for the hand
gesture (hasta) known as kataka hasta,
in which the fingers are loosely pressed
onto the thumb, creating a ring. This
particular name comes from the fanciful
notion that the shape of the hand
resembles a lion’s ear. See kataka hasta.
Simuka
(1st c. B.C.E.) Founder of the Satavahana
dynasty, which for over three centuries
ruled over much of central India and the
Malwa region from their capital in the
city of Paithan.
Singh, Ishvari Prasad Narayan
(r. 1835–1889) A Maharaja of Benares
who, with the help of local scholars,
wrote the dialogues (samvads) for the
characters in the Ramnagar Ram Lila.
The Ram Lilas are dramatized versions
of the epic Ramayana, which transcend
simple theater to become a form of wor-
ship. The Ram Lila at Ramnagar, the
fort that is home to the kings of
Benares, is the most famous and tradi-
tional of all these Ram Lilas. The
Ramnagar Ram Lila began because of
the royal family’s patronage, and the
annual performance is still sponsored
by them. Although they are no longer
the actual political rulers, the royal
family continues to play an important
ceremonial role. For further informa-
tion see Anaradha Kapur, Actors,
Pilgrims, Kings, and Gods, 1990.
Singh, Udit Narayan
(r. 1796–1835) Maharaja of Benares
whose reign saw the first performances
of the Ram Lila at his palace in
Ramnagar. The Ram Lilas are drama-
tized versions of the epic Ramayana,
which transcend simple theater to
become a form of worship. The Ram
Lila at Ramnagar, the fort that is home to
the kings of Benares, is the most famous
and traditional of all these Ram Lilas.
According to tradition, the Maharaja
was a great devotee (bhakta) of the god
Rama and a patron of the Ram Lilas in
Benares itself, but on several occasions
found it difficult to get across the
Ganges because of the seasonal flood-
ing. As a solution to the problem, he
sponsored his own Ram Lila—no doubt
also symbolically intended to reinforce
his kingship—which has become the
oldest, most traditional, and most
important Ram Lila in Benares. Udit
Narayan
Singh
finalized
the
locations of the Ram Lila, which is
performed throughout the city, whereas
his son Ishvari Prasad Narayan Singh
was responsible for writing the
dialogues (samvads) spoken by the
characters. For further information see
Anaradha Kapur, Actors, Pilgrims, Kings,
and Gods, 1990.
Sinhastha Mela
Name for the Kumbha Mela festival held
in the holy city of Ujjain. The festival is
called Sinhastha because it is celebrated
when Jupiter is in Leo (Sinha). The
Sinhastha Mela’s climactic bathing
(snana) day comes on the full moon in
the lunar month of Baisakh (April–
May). The Kumbha Mela is a massive
religious festival celebrated at three-
year intervals in four different cities:
Haridwar, Allahabad, Ujjain, and
Nasik; the festival thus comes to each
city every twelve years. The Kumbha
Mela is chiefly a festival at which partic-
ipants bathe in sacred rivers. The festi-
val’s primary participants are ascetics,
who come from all over South Asia to
bathe in the sacred waters. According to
[[651]]
Sinhastha Mela
Depiction of Sita and her husband Rama. In the epic the Ramayana,
Sita is abducted by the demon king Ravana and Rama must search the earth for her.
tradition, the Kumbha Mela was orga-
nized by the great philosopher Shan-
karacharya to promote regular gather-
ings of learned and holy men, as a
means to strengthen, sustain, and spread
Hindu religion.
The charter myth for the Kumbha
Mela is taken from the story of Churning
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has
been churned and the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta) has been extracted, the
[[652]]

gods and their demon opponents begin
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The
gods snatch the pot and run off with it,
but the one carrying the pot grows tired,
and in twelve days of carrying it sets it
on the ground in twelve different places.
Eight of the places are in heaven, but the
other four are on earth and these are the
four sites where the Mela is held. In each
place a bit of the nectar splashes on the
ground, sanctifying the site, and since aSita
divine day is considered to be a
human year, the twelve-year cycle is
established. According to popular
belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most
providential moment, the waters in
which people are bathing become the
nectar of immortality, and all those
who bathe in these waters gain
immeasurable religious merit.
Historically speaking, the two most
important sites have been Haridwar and
Allahabad; one measure of their domi-
nance is that they have held “half”
(ardha) Kumbha Melas after six years,
and that these have consistently drawn
bigger crowds than the “full” Kumbha
Melas at Ujjain and Nasik, which fall
during those times. In recent times,
however, political considerations have
increased the attendance at the
Sinhastha Mela. Ujjain is located in cen-
tral India, in the heartland of the Hindu
nationalist groups such as the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh, Vishva Hindu
Parishad, and Bharatiya Janata Party.
The city of Ujjain is also close to the
ancestral kingdom of Vijaya Raje
Scindia, the matriarch of a former royal
family and a prominent figure in the
Bharatiya Janata Party. In such a politi-
cal climate and local environment, the
Sinhastha Mela has been seen as a good
opportunity for religious-political the-
ater, in order to generate publicity, deliver
patronage, and give the people in these
organizations greater status and visibility.

Sita
(“furrow”) Daughter of King Janaka,
wife of the god-prince Rama (himself
the seventh avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu), and the major female
character in the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two great Sanskrit epics. Unlike
many other Hindu goddesses, Sita’s
identity stems almost completely from
her husband, and she has little indepen-
dent worship or personality of her own.
Her abduction by the demon-king
Ravana is the single major event driving
the plot of the Ramayana, prompting
her husband and his allies first to search
the earth for her and then to fight a cli-
mactic battle to regain her, concluding
with Ravana’s death. Throughout all the
tumult Sita simply waits to be rescued,
sure that this will provide her husband
with greater glory.
According to her charter myth, Sita is
not born in the normal way but is found
in a furrow by King Janaka as he plows
his field. Sita thus carries a strong asso-
ciation with the earth, fertility, and pros-
perity; as David Kinsley points out, her
marriage to Rama symbolizes the union
between the fecund earth and a right-
eous king that will make it prosper. Her
connection with the earth is also seen in
her disappearance, when in response to
Rama’s accusations of unfaithfulness,
she calls on the earth to swallow her up
as a witness to her chastity, and disap-
pears forever.
Sita’s primary virtue is her devotion
to her husband, and in her unflagging
love for him she is a model Hindu wife,
just as many of the Ramayana’s other
characters incarnate cultural ideals. An
early sign of her devotion is shown
when Rama has been wrongly exiled in
the forest for fourteen years. Even
though Sita has never known anything
but luxury and ease, she is determined
to accompany him into exile, based on
the conviction that a faithful wife
should always accompany her hus-
band. Rama objects, reasons, and even
forbids her, but Sita does not give in—
perhaps the only time that she does
not observe her husband’s wishes. She
goes to the forest with Rama and her
brother-in-law Lakshmana, cheerfully
taking on the difficult life of an ascetic,
since this means she can remain with
her husband.
The more difficult test of her devo-
tion to her husband comes when she is
abducted and held captive by Ravana.
She holds steadfast despite Ravana’s
unceasing persuasion, threats, and
attempts to convince her that Rama has
been killed. According to one story, the
only part of Ravana that she ever sees is
his feet, since as a devoted wife she kept
[[653]]
Sitamarhi
her eyes modestly downcast rather than
look directly at another man. When
Rama’s ally Hanuman discovers where
Sita is hidden, she refuses to let him
carry her away, since this will have
meant touching another man, as well as
depriving her husband of the opportu-
nity to rescue her.
Her devotion is severely tested after
her rescue, when Rama insists that she
must have been unfaithful to him dur-
ing her long captivity. This accusation
reflects the Indian cultural assumption
that women have much higher sex dri-
ves than men, and much less ability to
control these drives. Stung by this accu-
sation, she asks Rama to have a funeral
pyre built for her and enters it with the
wish that, if she is innocent, the fire will
not harm her. When the blaze dies down
she emerges unscathed, with the god
Agni (fire personified) as a witness to
her chastity. Despite this proof, Rama
banishes her from Ayodhya after their
return. When Rama later demands a
second ordeal, Sita calls on the earth
to swallow her up as a witness to her
purity, and disappears forever.
Sita’s ability to withstand both
ordeals reflects the widespread Indian
belief that women gain power through
their devotion to their husbands, power
that can be so great that they can even
curse the gods themselves. Encoded in
this notion are cultural messages about
the role of women and the importance
of their relationships with others. Sita
represents the model Indian woman,
whose primary loyalty is to her husband
and his family. This reflects the northern
Indian marriage pattern in which brides
are brought into the groom’s home and
become part of their marital families,
severing their connection with their
birth family. Wives are expected to place
other people’s welfare before their own,
so that they may live a happily married
life. In return for such self-sacrifice, a
wife becomes a model for all to respect
and honor.

Sitamarhi
City in the northern part of the state of
Bihar, about ten miles from the border
with Nepal. It is in the Panchala region
traditionally reckoned as the kingdom of
King Janaka, and Sitamarhi is believed
to be the place where the goddess Sita
was found in a furrow of the earth while
King Janaka was plowing.
Six Schools
Collective name for the six developed
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. All six schools consider the reli-
gious texts known as the Vedas to be the
most authoritative pramana, the means
by which human beings can gain true
and accurate knowledge. All six schools
also assume that philosophical reflec-
tion must ultimately serve religious
goals, to release the embodied soul
(atman) from an otherwise unending
cycle of transmigration. Aside from
these basic similarities, each of these
schools developed distinctive and char-
acteristic perspectives. Despite their dif-
ferences, by the early centuries of the
common era the schools had become
associated in pairs: Nyaya-Vaisheshika,
Samkhya-Yoga, and Purva Mimamsa-
Uttara Mimamsa, with the final school
more commonly known as Vedanta.
Of these, the Nyaya school focused
on examining and cataloguing the pra-
manas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge, and their conclusions
became accepted by all six schools. The
Vaisheshika school was a descriptive
ontology that categorized the world in
atomistic fashion, in which all things
were considered to be constructed from
smaller parts. This school had inherent
philosophical problems that con-
tributed to its eclipse. Samkhya is an
atheistic dualism based on the distinc-
tion between a conscious but inertSkanda
end of the millennium Vedanta had
become the most significant philosoph-
ical perspective, largely eclipsing the
others, although it had absorbed certain
influences from them. For further infor-
mation see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

book in Indian Philosophy, 1957.

purusha (“person,” or spirit), and an
unconscious but active prakrti
(“nature”). According to the Samkhya
proponents, failure to discriminate
between the two leads to the evolution
of the world and the individual person,
whereas correct understanding reverses
this process. Samkhya provides the the-
oretical basis for the Yoga school, which
essentially details techniques to help
one gain the correct understanding
between these two entities. Purva
Mimamsa stresses the study of the Vedas
as the source of instruction for human
beings, an emphasis that led it to
develop sophisticated theories of lan-
guage and methods for textual interpre-
tation. These tools were used by the
Vedanta school in its efforts to reveal the
ultimate meaning of the Vedas. Most of
the first millennium during the com-
mon era was a time of lively debate
among these schools, each of which
held varying positions on basic things
such as the reality of the world. By the
Hindu deity who is the son of the god
Shiva. Skanda is born to destroy the
demon Taraka, who has received the
divine boon that he can only be killed by
a son of Shiva. When Taraka makes this
request, Shiva is deep in meditation in
his grief after the death of his wife Sati,
and it seems unlikely that such a son can
ever be born. After Taraka grows too
strong, the other gods begin the process
of trying to encourage Shiva to marry,
which results in his wedding with the
goddess Parvati.
Despite the marriage of Shiva and
Parvati, Skanda is born in an unusual
way. According to the legend, Shiva and
Parvati are disturbed while making love,
and Shiva inadvertently spills his semen
on the ground (the verb skand means
“to leap” or “to ooze”). In Indian culture
semen is seen as a man’s concentrated
essence, and for a deity like Shiva this
means that the semen is inordinately
powerful, capable of destroying the
earth. The semen is first held by the god
Agni, who is fire personified, but it
proves too powerful for him. Agni then
puts it in the River Ganges, and after
[[10]]
,000 years the river deposits a shining
child in the reeds by its bank. The child
is discovered by the Krittikas (the
Pleiades personified), each of whom
want to nurse him. To oblige them
Skanda grows five extra heads. As a
mark of the Krittikas’ care, one of his
epithets is Kartikkeya. Skanda grows
rapidly, assumes command of Shiva’s
heavenly host (gana), and kills the
troublesome Taraka. His persona
remains that of a warrior prince, unlike
that of his brother Ganesh, who is a
scholar and sage.
[[655]]
Smallpox
In northern India Skanda is consid-
ered a member of Shiva’s household,
and although his power is acknowl-
edged, he is generally not a primary
object of worship. In southern India
Skanda has been identified with
Murugan, a regional deity associated
primarily with the hunt, but also with
war. In this atmosphere he has taken on
a much greater role, particularly in
Tamil Nadu, and has assumed the man-
tle of a philosopher and exponent of the
Shaiva Siddhanta school.
Smallpox
In traditional Hindu belief, smallpox
was personified as the goddess Shitala
(“Cool One,” a euphemism), and the
fever and skin eruptions accompanying
the disease were interpreted as signs of
possession by this goddess. In the time
since the World Health Organization has
declared smallpox officially eradicated,
in some regions Shitala has been identi-
fied with tuberculosis. See Shitala.
Smara
(“memory”) Epithet of the god Kama,
the deification of desire, reflecting the
importance of memory in generating
and maintaining desire. See Kama.
Smarana
(“remembering”) One of the standard
religious practices mentioned in lists
of religiously meritorious actions.
Smarana is most often associated with
deities but is also mentioned in con-
junction with sacred sites (tirthas), one’s
spiritual teacher (guru), or even particu-
lar acts of worship. This practice
involves thinking constantly upon the
deity, person, place, or object, and in the
case of a deity this often involves mental
recitation of the deity’s name. The pri-
mary emphasis in this practice is to cre-
ate habitual behavioral patterns that,
over the long term, will have beneficial
effects on one’s character.
[[656]]

Smarta
Name for a particular group of brahmins
distinguished not by region or family,
but by the religious texts that they hold
most authoritative. For the Smartas, the
most authoritative texts are the texts
known as the smrtis—either the texts
themselves or commentaries and com-
pilations based on them. The smrtis or
“remembered” texts were a class of liter-
ature that, although deemed important,
were considered less authoritative than
the shrutis or “heard” texts. In brief, the
shrutis denoted the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts, whereas the smrtis included the
dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
the Mahabharata, and Ramayana, and
the collection known as the puranas.
The Smartas thus stand in contrast with
sectarian brahmins, whether Shaiva
(devotees of Shiva) or Vaishnava (devo-
tees of Vishnu), for whom their particu-
lar sectarian scriptures have the highest
religious authority. Smarta brahmins
can therefore claim to be following the
oldest and best established religious
texts and thus in some way to be the
most orthodox. Since Smartas are dis-
tinguished by their authoritative texts
and practice rather than by the deity
they worship, individual Smartas may
worship different Hindu deities, and
many do. Yet particularly in southern
India, many Smartas perform the pan-
chayatana puja to the five divine
forms—Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Ganesh,
and the Goddess—which is intended to
show the ultimate unity behind the dif-
fering manifestations of divinity.
Smrti
(“[that which is] remembered”) An
important class of Hindu religious liter-
ature that, despite its sacrality, is
deemed less authoritative than the
other major category, shruti. According
to tradition, the shruti (“heard”) texts
were not composed by human beings
but are based in the primordial vibra-
tions of the cosmos itself. The ancient
sages, whose faculties of perception hadSnana

purity by bathing.
been sharpened through rigorous reli-
gious practice, were able to “hear” and
understand these vibrations, and trans-
mitted them to others in a lineage of
learning. The smrti texts, in contrast, are
attributed to human authors, who are
putting forth matters that are “remem-
bered” and thus carry with them the
possibility of error. The smrti literature
is wider and much more varied than the
shruti, which is restricted to the texts in
the Vedas; smrti literature includes the
dharma literature, the sectarian compi-
lations known as puranas, the two great
epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana),
the Bhagavad Gita, and the tantras,
which are manuals detailing the secret,
ritually based religious practice of tantra
followers. Although theoretically the
smrtis have less religious authority than
the shrutis, in practical terms they are
often far more important, in part
because their contents are much better
known. This is particularly true for sec-
tarian Hinduism, in which a group’s sec-
tarian literature will often be given the
highest religious authority.
Snana
(“bath”) Bathing is arguably the single
most commonly performed Hindu reli-
gious act, and it is a necessary one
before performing any rite or worship.
An early morning bath is the norm for
just about all Hindus, and this has been
true for centuries. The earliest European
visitors invariably remarked on this
practice, since some of these visitors
bathed only a few times in their lives.
For Hindus, bathing not only keeps one
clean but is a way to regain ritual purity
by using water (most commonly) to
remove any source of defilement.
[[657]]
Snataka
Bathing is normally the last part of one’s
morning rites, preceded by cleaning
one’s teeth and tongue, rinsing the
mouth (achamana), and (immediately
before bathing) voiding one’s bladder
and bowels. These latter acts are a nec-
essary part of life, but they also render
one ritually impure, a state that the bath
removes. People generally perform any
daily worship immediately after
bathing, while this ritual purity is
still unbroken.
Most people bathe only in the morn-
ing, although those scrupulously con-
cerned with purity (generally brahmins
or ascetics) will bathe more often. The
bath itself is usually quite brief and
some in cases consists of simply
immersing oneself in a natural body of
water, or pouring a bucket of water over
one’s head. In modern times people
often use soap, but the traditionally pre-
scribed cleansing medium is earth. It is
preferable to bathe in running water,
since the bath purifies by removing the
impurity (ashaucha) and carrying it
away and although bathing in a large
pond is seen as acceptable, bathing in a
bathtub is seen as simply spreading the
impurity around rather than getting rid
of it. Although the most common medium
for bathing is water, when this is impos-
sible one can ritually cleanse oneself
with oil, or one can perform ritual
cleansing with mantras by using sacred
sounds to remove defilement and bring
one to a state of ritual purity.
In the context of worship, snana is
the sixth of the sixteen traditional
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a deity
as part of worship, on the model of treat-
ing the deity as an honored guest. In this
offering, the deity is bathed, either liter-
ally or symbolically. The underlying
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is
to show one’s love for the deity and min-

Snataka
(“[one who has] bathed”) In the dharma
literature, this is the name for a
young man who had performed the
[[658]]

samavartana samskara, the life-cycle
ceremony that marks the end of
his stage of life as a celibate student
(brahmacharin) and return to his
parental home. The most important ele-
ment in the rite was a bath, after which
he changed into new clothes, marking
his change in status. Before doing this
he was supposed to ask his guru’s per-
mission, and also to give him his
teacher’s fee (dakshina), both as pay-
ment for services rendered and as a sign
of respect. A young man who had per-
formed this rite would be eligible to get
married, and the literature prescribes
that this should follow in short order.
Solah Somvar Vrat
A religious vow (vrat) that is a variant of
the worship of the god Shiva prescribed
for every Monday (Somvar), the day of
the week over which he is believed to
preside. In the Solah Somvar Vrat, the
observer vows to do perform this rite for
sixteen (solah) consecutive Mondays.
Each week’s observance is marked by
fasting (upavasa), worship, and reading
aloud the charter myth for this particu-
lar observance. As with most literature
pertaining to such rites, the text ends
with a catalog of the benefits brought by
the rite—in essence, it gives whatever
one desires.
According to the vow’s charter myth,
as Shiva and his wife Parvati are playing
dice in a temple, Parvati asks a nearby
brahmin which of them will win, and
when he replies that it will be Shiva, she
angrily curses him to be afflicted with lep-
rosy. The curse comes true (as with all
curses in Indian mythology) and the
brahmin is in a terrible state. Shiva takes
pity on the brahmin, tells him to perform
the Solah Somvar Vrat, and on the six-
teenth Monday, the brahmin is completely
cured. Some time later Parvati sees him
and is amazed at his recovery. When she
asks how he has been cured, the brahmin
tells her about the vow, which she later
uses to cure her son of disobedience (thus
emphasizing the power of the vow, since
it is even used by the gods themselves).Someshvara 1
Solar Line
In Hindu mythology, one of the two
great lineages, the other being the Lunar
Line. The Solar Line traces its descent
from Ikshvaku, the grandson of the Sun
himself. Its descendants include many
of the principal characters in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics. One of these descendants
is Rama himself. In many of the small
former princely states in Rajasthan, the
rulers claimed descent from the Solar
Line as a way to establish and support
their royal authority. Although they no
longer wield ruling power, many of these
royal houses still exist, and thus this lin-
eage is believed to be still extant.
Soma
Soma is one of the most enigmatic
deities in the Hindu tradition. The 120
hymns to soma in the Rg Veda, the old-
est Hindu sacred text, variously describe
soma as a plant, as the juice pressed
from that plant, and as the deified form
of both juice and plant. The Vedic
hymns give detailed descriptions of how
the sacrificial priests pressed it, strained
and filtered it, and finally consumed it,
which then brought visions upon them.
These hymns portray soma as some sort
of mind-altering substance, although
there is no general agreement on what
the soma plant might be. Its identity has
been lost since late Vedic times, and
since then various substitutes have been
used in rituals.
Although the hymns describe soma
as hallucinogenic, one need not take
this literally. One can explain such
visions in purely psychological terms, as
induced or fostered by the priests’
heightened expectations in the sacrifi-
cial arena. If one assumes that soma was
actually mind-altering, it could not have
been an alcoholic beverage—since it
was prepared and consumed on the
same day, this would have given no time
for fermentation. One theory is that
soma was hashish (charas), which is still
consumed in certain ritual contexts. The
most
intriguing
theory
was
proposed by R. G. Wasson, who
contended that soma was Amonita mus-
caria, a mind-altering mushroom that
has a long history of use in Asian
shamanic traditions. Although Wasson’s
theory would explain soma’s ability to
take immediate effect, many Indologists
have taken issue with this claim. See
Robert Gordon Wasson, Soma, 1971; for
contrary remarks, see J. Brough, “Soma
and Amonita Muscaria,” in The Bulletin
of the School of Oriental and African
Studies, Vol. 34, 1971.
Somavati Amavasya
Religious observance celebrated when a
new moon (amavasya) falls on a
Monday, which can thus occur in any
month in the year. On the new moon
day the sun and moon travel together
during the daylight sky, and when this
happens on the Monday, whose presid-
ing planet is the moon, this confluence
is deemed particularly favorable.
Another auspicious connection arises
because Monday’s presiding deity, the
god Shiva, also has mythic connections
with the moon. A Somavati Amavasya is
thus judged a particularly beneficial
time to worship Shiva, as well as to
bathe (snana) in a sacred river such as
the Ganges, or to perform any other reli-
gious act.
Someshvara I
(r. 1042–1068) Monarch in the Chalukya
dynasty. Aside from his long reign, he is
most noted for performing religious sui-
cide by intentionally drowning himself
in the Tungabhadra River when his
mental faculties began to wane.
Although in general suicide was strongly
condemned, suicide by a person suffer-
ing from a terminal disease or enduring
chronic pain was a well-attested excep-
tion to this rule. This sort of suicide was
performed according to a well-defined
ritual, which was intended to put the
performer in the proper frame of mind.
In about the twelfth century this was
declared one of the rites “forbidden in
[[659]]
Somnath
Somnath Shore Temple, Gujarat.
the Kali [Age]” (Kalivarjya), although it
had been permitted in earlier times.
Somnath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
state of Gujarat. The temple is named
for its presiding deity—the god Shiva in
his manifestation as the “Lord of the
Moon.” Shiva is present at Somnath in
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
image that is his symbolic form, and the
Somnath linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites deemed
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which
he is uniquely present. According to the
site’s charter myth, the moon is married
to all of the twenty-seven nakshatras, or
signs in the lunar zodiac, but he loves
Rohini nakshatra so much that he stays
with her all the time, and neglects his
other twenty-six wives. His father-in-law
Daksha protests to the moon, but when
he refuses to give them equal time,
Daksha lays a curse on him that he will
lose all his light. The moon overcomes
this curse by worshiping Shiva at
Somnath for six continuous months and
is given the boon that he will only shrink
during half the lunar month, and that
[[660]]

during the other half he will grow. As
a sign of this gift, Shiva takes
residence there as Somnath, and
remains to this day.
Aside from its importance as a sacred
site, the Somnath temple is a potent
political symbol. The original temple
was razed and pillaged by Mahmud of
Ghazni in 1024, who reportedly carried
off astounding booty. The present tem-
ple at Somnath was built after Indian
independence in 1947 and consecrated
in 1951. As a symbol, Somnath is thus
associated with past oppression and
depredation, and with the revitalization
of Hindu culture in India. For this rea-
son, the Somnath temple is a popular
image for proponents of Hindutva, an
idea that identifies Hindu identity and
Indian citizenship.
Sonar
In traditional northern Indian society, a
Hindu jati whose hereditary occupation
was gold smithing and jewelry making.
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organizedSons
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group held a monopoly.
Song of Manik Chandra
Traditional Bengali song describing the
adventures of the mythical king Manik
Chandra, his wife Mayana, and their son
Gopi Chand; the latter figures are the
primary characters, since Manik
Chandra dies early in the story. The text
is a romance but also contains many of
the doctrines associated with the
Nathpanthi ascetics. In particular,
Queen Mayana has power over Yama
(death personified), which was one of
the primary aims of the Nathpanthi
ascetics. Furthermore, she acquired this
power through the spiritual instruction
given by her guru Gorakhnath, the
Nathpanthi founder.
Her power over death is shown in
various ways. When her husband dies,
Mayana descends to Yama’s realm and
physically abuses both Yama and his
minions. In his flight Yama changes into
various forms to escape Mayana’s wrath,
but she is never deceived and continues
to harass him. On other occasions, she
shows her power over death by her
inability to be killed. She mounts her
husband’s funeral pyre, and although
the fire burns for seven days and nine
nights, not even her clothing is
scorched. Many years later, Mayana sur-
vives seven fearsome ordeals, such
as boiling in oil. When asked how
she acquired these magical arts, she
replies that Gorakhnath himself taught
her. The appearance of such ideas in
an essentially popular tale shows how
deeply these ideas had sunk into the
popular mind.
Sons
It is difficult to overstate the importance
traditional Hindu culture has placed on
the need for sons, and the cultural bias
for sons over daughters. Religious
motives underlie one important reason
for this bias, since only sons are entitled
to perform the memorial offerings for
the dead known as shraddhas. The men
in each generation are responsible for
making these offerings to their ances-
tors. They are in turn obliged to have
sons of their own, so that the family lin-
eage and the chain of ancestral offerings
remains unbroken through the genera-
tions. Sonless couples are not completely
out of luck, since sons can be obtained
through adoption.
The other major reason behind the
preference for sons lies in far more prag-
matic motives. According to the tradi-
tional Indian marriage pattern, daugh-
ters move into their marital homes and
become members of their marital fami-
lies, whereas sons bring their brides into
the home and through their own fami-
lies continue the family line. Thus, par-
ents sometimes see their daughters as
“temporary” family members, while
their sons are “permanent.” The sons
will dwell in their natal house their
entire lives, support their parents in
old age, and produce the family’s
future generations. These traditional
practices and beliefs still hold very
strong, although the forces of modernity
have affected the joint family. It has
become more common for husbands
and wives to live separately from the
husband’s parents.
The religious, economic, and social
factors behind this preference for sons
have sometimes had terrible conse-
quences. Consciously or unconsciously,
sons may be favored over daughters in
many significant ways. Sons are often
given better access to education and
economic opportunities, because men
are traditionally required to support
their families. A similar presumption lies
behind the inequities in traditional
Hindu inheritance laws, which give
the sons a much larger share of the
inheritance. In poorer families, sons
may even get preference for basic needs
such as food and access to medical care.
Despite these patterns, in contemporary
times many families treat all their
children with equal love and care. Given
the trend toward smaller families, the
[[661]]
Sopashraya
birth of a daughter can be cause for as
much rejoicing as that of a son.
Sopashraya
(“using a support”) One of the sitting
postures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,
the foundational text for the practice of
yoga. The name of this posture derives
from a wooden support used by the
sitter to keep erect, often portrayed as
a crutch-shaped prop under the chin.
Soratha
Metrical form in northern Indian devo-
tional (bhakti) poetry, made up of two
lines of twenty-four metric beats, divided
unevenly after the eleventh beat. The
metric pattern for the first line is 6+4+1,
with the pattern for the second line
being 6+4+3. The soratha is thus an
inversion of the metrical form doha.
Although the soratha was a common
poetic form, the doha was far more pop-
ular and widely used.
South Africa
One of the countries with significant
Hindu diaspora populations. This is
particularly true in Natal province,
where Hindus were first brought as
indentured agricultural laborers, but
there is a significant Hindu presence in
other parts of the country as well. South
Africa is best known as the place where
Mohandas K. Gandhi first developed
and refined his program of nonviolent
resistance, or satyagraha, which he
employed in the service of the Indian
community there. In contemporary
times the South African Hindu commu-
nity, as with many Hindu diaspora com-
munities, has loosened religious ties to
India, and is in the process of forming a
Hindu religious life in another geo-
graphical setting.
Space
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
[[662]]

earth, fire, water, and wind. Akasha or
“space” is not conceived in the sense of
“outer space,” but rather the space
between or within visible objects on
earth. For example, an “empty” pitcher
was not actually empty, but was filled
with space, until it was displaced by
some fluid. This elemental sense of
space was thus something closer to what
might be considered the “atmosphere,”
and was actually seen as having fluidlike
properties. In some philosophical
schools, each of the elements is paired
with one of the five senses; here akasha
is associated with hearing, since it
is believed to convey the sound from
place to place.
Sphota
(“disclosure”) Crucial element in the
theory of language propounded by
Bhartrhari (7th c.). Bhartrhari was the
founder of the Grammarians, a philo-
sophical school that conceived of
Brahman, the Supreme Reality, as being
manifested in sound, particularly the
sound of the spoken word. According to
this theory, a verbal utterance had three
elements: the sound or sounds pro-
duced by the speaker and heard by the
listener; a phonological pattern, of
which that utterance is an instance; and
finally the sphota, which was expressed
by the sounds and signified the object of
that utterance. According to Bhartrhari,
sphota had to be postulated to explain
how words could carry meaning. They
do so because they are connected to the
sphota, which designated a particular
object, and in producing the sounds the
speaker expressed that sphota.
Sri Lanka
Island nation off the southeastern coast
of India, formerly known as Ceylon.
Local tradition claims that Sri Lanka was
the place at which the biblical Adam
alighted from paradise. Yet despite the
island’s idyllic natural beauty, its human
geography has been far more troubled.
Since 1981 the nation has been in theStages of Life
throes of civil war between the Sinhalese
and the Tamils, the island’s two major
ethnic groups. The Sinhalese comprise
about 70 percent of the population, are
largely Buddhist, live mainly in south-
ern, western, and central Sri Lanka, and
consider themselves the island’s tradi-
tional inhabitants. The Tamils comprise
little more than 20 percent of the popu-
lation, are both Hindu and Christian,
and are concentrated in the north and
east. The Tamils came to Sri Lanka in
two different ways—about half are
descended from medieval invaders, who
established Tamil kingdoms in northern
Sri Lanka after crossing the straits from
southern India, others were brought to
Sri Lanka in the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, to serve as laborers
on tea plantations.
Since independence in 1948, the
Tamils have been at a distinct disadvan-
tage vis-à-vis the Sinhalese, whose
majority has allowed them to control
virtually all aspects of national life. This
precarious position was often further
undermined by anti-Tamil riots, partic-
ularly in Colombo, the nation’s capital.
In 1981 Tamil groups began a struggle
for an independent nation in the Tamil-
majority areas. The Sinhalese majority
was deathly opposed to this notion, and
since then Sri Lanka has been marked by
periods of vicious civil war. Given their
slimmer resources, the Tamils have
tended to wage guerrilla warfare. Their
soldiers are famous for wearing a
cyanide capsule around their necks with
which to commit suicide if captured.
These soldiers are also notorious for
their willingness to serve as human
bombs, striking against civilian popula-
tions in urban areas. In 1991 one such
human bomb was responsible for the
assassination of former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi in revenge for
Gandhi’s perceived treachery in cooper-
ating with the Sri Lankan government.
Although the Tamil regions have been
offered limited autonomy by Chandrika
Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka’s present prime
minister, the conflict has been so bitter
that it is not likely to be easily resolved.
Sri Lanka has traditionally been part
of the Indian cultural orbit and has a
long history of cultural exchanges with
India. According to local tradition,
Buddhism was brought to Sri Lanka
from India in the third century B.C.E. by
Mahinda, who was the son of the
Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Another sign
of this connection is that Sri Lanka con-
tains an important Hindu pilgrimage
place (tirtha), Kataragama, located
near the island’s southern coast.
Kataragama’s perceived power draws
Hindus from abroad as well as Sri
Lankans from all religious communities.
Although Kataragama is Sri Lanka’s
only major Hindu site, the northern
regions strongly reflect the Tamil culture
of the region’s population, which stems
from their geographic roots. See also
Tamil Nadu.
Stages of Life
As described in the dharma literature,
there were four stages (ashramas) in the
life of a twice-born man, that is, a man
born into one of the three “twice-born”
groups in Indian society—brahmin,
kshatriya, or vaishya—who are eligible
for the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” In the first
stage, immediately after this initiation,
the young man would live as a celibate
student (brahmacharin) studying the
Vedas in his guru’s household. The sec-
ond stage was that of the householder
(grhastha), in which he would marry,
raise a family, and engage in worldly life.
In the third stage, as a forest-dwelling
hermit (vanaprastha), he would gradu-
ally detach himself from worldly entan-
glements. The final stage was as a total
renunciant (Sanyasi), who had given up
all things in a search for the ultimate
religious truth. These four stages are an
idealized progression and should not be
understood as describing actual prac-
tice, since most men never pass beyond
the householder stage of life and have
no desire to do so.
Beneath this idealized progression
lies the tension between two differing
[[663]]
Steya
modes of religious life—that of the
householder, which is based in the
world, and that of the ascetic, which
renounces the world. The latter ideal
originated with the religious adepts
known as the shramanas and evolved
into the monastic asceticism of the
Buddhists and Jains, which was por-
trayed as a superior religious path than
the householder’s life. Both these groups
were highly influential—the Jains had a
significant presence in southern Indian
society up to the eighth century C.E.—
and it is generally accepted that the pat-
tern of the four ashramas was evolved as
a way to appropriate and transform this
stress on ascetic life. The doctrine of the
four stages provided a place and time for
asceticism, but as the last stage, at the
end of one’s life. The clear message was
that one should engage in the search for
religious truth only after fulfilling one’s
social and ancestral duties.
Steya
(“theft”) In the dharma literature, one
of the Four Great Crimes whose com-
mission made one an outcast from soci-
ety; steya was theft of a brahmin’s gold,
above a certain specified amount. One
guilty of this crime was to go to the king
bearing an iron club and receive a blow
to the head intended to be fatal. This
blow would absolve the sin, whether or
not one actually died, although one
was also expected to restore the stolen
property. For lesser amounts of gold the
punishment was less severe and satis-
fied by fasting (upavasa) and other
penance (prayashchitta). The stress on
the seriousness of this sin clearly reflects
the interests of the brahmins, who
undoubtedly wrote most of the
dharma literature.
Sthala Murti
(“fixed image”) Image of a deity that is
fixed in a certain place and does not
move from it (in the case of stone
images, this is often because such
images are so large and heavy that
[[664]]

moving them is virtually impossible).
The other sort of image is the utsava
murti, a movable image used during
festival processions.
Sthunakarna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Sthunakarna is a
nature spirit (yaksha) who exchanges
sexes with Shikhandi, the rebirth of
the maiden Amba, daughter of the
king of Kashi.
Stridhan
(“woman’s wealth”) Term denoting any
property owned or inherited by a
woman, which usually included any
gifts given to her by her family or money
that she earned herself. In the patrilineal
inheritance systems prescribed by texts
such as the Mitakshara and the
Dayabhaga, stridhan was not consid-
ered part of the family property, but a
woman’s personal property that she
could dispose of as she pleased.
Stridhan could be inherited, but the
inheritance patterns were different than
those for family property. The primary
inheritors were a woman’s daughters;
for women with no daughters, the own-
ership would devolve to her husband
and his heirs, or to her birth family.
Stridharma
Term denoting “women’s religious duty”
(dharma), the set of social roles, rules,
and duties broadly conceived as apply-
ing to all women. In the dharma litera-
ture, it was generally assumed that
appropriate women’s roles were as
daughters, wives, and mothers, and that
their lives would be primarily defined by
their relationships with men—whether
fathers, brothers, husbands, or sons. As
described in the dharma literature, their
position seems to have had status, but
little authority. One well-known passage
from the Manu Smrti warns that a
woman must never be independent, but
always under the guardianship of a man;
this is followed by an equally famousSubtle Body
passage warning that the treatment of
women was a marker of the family’s
honor, and that a household in which
the women were badly treated would
disappear. In real life women exercised
considerably more power than in this
theoretical model, but such power usu-
ally came later in life, when a woman’s
sons had formed families of their own,
and she had thus become the matriarch
of an extended family.
Subhadra
The divine sister of the god Jagannath,
who is invariably pictured with him and
their brother Balabhadra. The most
important site for these three deities is
the Jagannath temple in the city of Puri,
at which Jagannath is the presiding
deity. Although Jagannath is identified
with the god Krishna, he is generally
considered an autochthonous (“of the
land”) deity who was originally the local
deity of Puri. He has been assimilated
into the Hindu pantheon by his identifi-
cation with Krishna.
One piece of evidence for this theory
is the deities’ invariable appearance,
with Jagannath (Krishna) on the right,
his brother Balabhadra (Balarama) on
the left, and Subhadra as a smaller figure
in the center. Such a triadic grouping
is virtually unknown in Krishna devo-
tion, which tends to stress either
Krishna alone or the divine couple
of Krishna and Radha. The female figure
of Subhadra is also very unusual, since
as Jagannath’s sister she is ineligible
for the amorous adventures usually
associated with Krishna. Although
Jagannath is the most important of
the three deities, the identifications with
the other two also reveal larger
syncretizing tendencies. Balabhadra is
sometimes identified as a form of
the god Shiva, and Subhadra as the
powerful goddess Durga. In this way,
Puri’s divine trio embody the three
most important Hindu deities. For
further information on Subhadra and
her brothers, the best source is
Anncharlott Eschmann, Hermann
Kulke, and Gaya Charan Tripathi, The
Cult of Jagannath and the Regional
Traditions of Orissa, 1978.
Subodhini
(“Greatly enlightening”) A name given to
commentaries on various texts—pre-
sumably because of the commentary’s
ability to illuminate the text. The most
famous of these commentaries, to
which the name Subodhini is often
understood to refer, is the one by
Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) on the
Bhagavata Purana. The Bhagavata
Purana is one of the later sectarian
compendia known as puranas, and it is
the most important source for the
mythology of the god Krishna, whom
Vallabhacharya considered the Supreme
Being. Vallabhacharya’s Subodhini lays
out the basic doctrines of his religious
community, known as the Pushti Marg
because of their stress on god’s grace,
which they called pushti, meaning “that
which nourishes the soul.”
Subrahmanya
(“dear to brahmins”) Epithet of the god
Skanda, particularly in his southern
Indian manifestation as Murugan. See
Skanda and Murugan.
Subtle Body
Alternate human physiological system
that exists on a different plane than
gross matter, but has certain correspon-
dences with the anatomy of the material
body. Different parts of the subtle body
contain the microcosmic forms of the
deities Shiva and Shakti, the bipolar
forces believed to be the powers behind
the cosmos. The subtle body is thus
based on the principle of the homology,
or essential similarities, of macrocosm
and microcosm, a fundamental Hindu
idea since the time of the Upanishads.
The Sanskrit texts describing the subtle
body assume that there are different
planes of reality, and thus that the subtle
body actually exists, but given the net-
work of symbols associated with it, one
[[665]]
Subtle Body
Vishnu, surrounded by worshipers, wielding Sudarshana, his discus weapon.
need not accept its literal reality for it to
be religiously meaningful.
The subtle body is visualized as a set
of six psychic centers (chakras), running
roughly along the course of the spine:
the muladhara chakra at the base of the
spine, the svadhishthana chakra in the
genital region, the manipura chakra in
the navel region, the anahata chakra in
[[666]]

the heart region, the vishuddha chakra
in the throat region, and the ajna chakra
is in the forehead between the eyebrows.
Associated with each of these chakras is
an elaborate symbolic system: All six can
be seen as symbols for a human physio-
logical capacity; the first five are associ-
ated with one of the subtle elements
(tanmatras), and the sixth with thought.Sudarshana
The lotus petals on each chakra contain
a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sounds. Some
models of the subtle body are even
more developed, with each chakra
associated with a certain color and a
certain presiding deity.
These centers are capped at the top
of the head by the “thousand-petaled
lotus” (sahasradalapadma), which is
the abode of Shiva in the human body.
Connecting all of the centers are three
vertical channels (nadi)—the ida nadi
on the left, the pingala nadi on the
right, and the sushumna in the center.
Coiled three times around the mulad-
hara chakra is the kundalini, the latent
spiritual force in all human beings.
This is considered an aspect of the uni-
versal Shakti, or feminine divine
power, but in most people is regarded
as dormant, symbolized by its coiled
state. The separation of Shakti and
Shiva at the opposite ends of the subtle
body also symbolizes the ordinary per-
son’s unenlightened state, since enlight-
enment transcends this duality, and the
two deities are united and identical.
The subtle body is a fundamental
aspect of tantra practices and some
forms of yoga. In the types of yoga that
focus on the subtle body, including
kundalini yoga, the ultimate aim is to
awaken and straighten the kundalini,
moving it up the sushumna through
the chakras to the abode of Shiva.
Since the kundalini is nothing but raw
energy, the process must be carefully
controlled to prevent the aspirant from
unleashing uncontrollable forces, and
manuals warn against doing this with-
out being under the supervision of a
spiritual teacher (guru). The union of
Shiva and Shakti in the aspirant’s body
mirrors the action of these divine
forces in the macrocosm, and with this
union the aspirant gains bliss and final
liberation of the soul (moksha). For fur-
ther information see Arthur Avalon (Sir
John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1959]]
; Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Suchi Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the hand is closed except for
the index finger, which is pointing
downward to indicate something to the
viewer. The word suchi means “needle”
but is derived from a verb that can mean
either “to pierce” or “to indicate”—both
meanings that imply focusing on a
particular place.
Sudama
In Hindu mythology, one of the god
Krishna’s childhood friends who is a
symbol for god’s grace and providence.
In later life Sudama is desperately poor
and, at his wife’s urging, goes to beg for
help from his childhood friend, who is
now the king of Dwaraka. Sudama is so
poor that the only gift he can bring for
Krishna is a small packet of parched
rice, but Krishna greets him and gra-
ciously accepts it. The two have an
enjoyable visit in which they reminisce
about old times, and Sudama goes home
without asking for anything. Some of the
stories explain this lapse as stemming
from shame, but in others Sudama is
portrayed as having had such a nice
time that he simply forgets. During his
homeward journey Sudama worries
over the reception he will get from his
wife, but when he arrives he discovers
that his hut has been transformed into a
palace by Krishna’s divine power, and
from that day he is never poor again.
Sudarshana
In Hindu mythology, the name for the
god Vishnu’s discus weapon (chakra),
which is fashioned by Vishvakarma, the
workman and architect of the gods.
According to the story, Vishvakarma has
married his daughter Sanjna to the sun,
but she finds her husband’s brightness
too much to bear. To help his daughter
adjust, Vishvakarma trims off some bits
[[667]]
Sudarshana Sampraday
of the sun with his divine tools, remov-
ing enough of his radiance that Sanjna
can bear to be with him. He then fash-
ions the trimmed-off portions into
Vishnu’s Sudarshana chakra, Shiva’s tri-
dent, and various other divine weapons,
as well as the Pushpak Viman, an aerial
car. Sudarshana’s divine source makes it
a fearful weapon, and it is thus able to
decimate any enemy.
Sudarshana Sampraday
Another name for the Nimbarki reli-
gious community, since their founder
Nimbarka was believed to be an incar-
nation of Sudarshana, Vishnu’s weapon.
Sugriva
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, a monkey king
and an ally of the god Rama in his
struggle to regain his kidnapped wife
Sita. Sugriva and his brother Bali
jointly rule the kingdom of Kish-
kindha but become enemies because
of a misunderstanding. On one occa-
sion the two are fighting a magician
who has taken refuge in a cave. Bali
goes in, after instructing Sugriva on
certain signs that will indicate which
of them has been killed. Sugriva waits
outside the cave for a year, and then
sees the sign indicating his brother’s
death, which the cunning magician
has engineered during his own death.
Thinking that his brother is dead,
Sugriva rolls a stone over the mouth of
the cave to trap the magician, and
returns home. Bali eventually manages
to get out of the cave and, thinking that
his brother has used this opportunity
to get rid of him, forces Sugriva into
exile and keeps Sugriva’s wife as his
own. Sugriva lives in exile until he
makes an alliance with Rama, who kills
Bali by shooting him while Bali fights
with Sugriva. After regaining his king-
dom, Sugriva is a faithful ally to Rama,
and with his monkey armies aids in the
conquest of Lanka.

Suicide
An act whose permissibility and conse-
quences have elicited varying opinions
over time. In medieval times commen-
tators distinguished between several
types of suicide, depending on the cir-
cumstances surrounding the act. Any
suicide prompted by an overpowering
emotional impulse such as rage or grief
was always strictly forbidden, and those
who did this were said to reap dire
karmic consequences. Another case
entirely was suicide performed as an
expiation (prayashchitta) for one’s sins,
which was often prescribed to expiate
one of the Four Great Crimes. A third
type was suicide by people suffering
from a terminal disease, or who were in
chronic pain. This sort of suicide was
performed according to a well-defined
ritual, intended to put the performer in
the proper frame of mind. This third
category was one of the rites designated
as “forbidden in the Kali [Age]”
(Kalivarjya), although it had been per-
mitted in earlier times. The most
fascinating sort of suicide was at pil-
grimage places (tirtha), particularly at
Allahabad. This was also done accord-
ing to a very specific ritual, and part of
the ritual required the performer to
name the benefit for which the rite was
being performed—in some cases libera-
tion of the soul (moksha), in other cases
life in heaven for many eons. This prac-
tice is well documented up to the seven-
teenth century, although it is no longer
done in contemporary times.
Sulfur
A pivotal substance in Indian alchemy,
the conceptual foundation for which is
its analysis of the world as a series of
bipolar opposites in tension with one
another, and the conviction that unify-
ing these opposing forces brings spiritu-
al progress and the end of reincarnation
(samsara). Hindu alchemy shares this
model of uniting or transcending
opposing forces with Hindu tantra, a
secret, ritually based system of religious
practice, and with hatha yoga, which isSun
based on a series of physical exercises
that are also believed to affect the
subtle body.
In the alchemical tradition, the gov-
erning metaphor for this combination of
opposites is the union of sun and moon.
Both are connected to other opposing
principles through an elaborate series of
associations, in keeping with this bipo-
lar symbolism. In Hindu alchemical
conceptions, sulfur is conceived of as
the uterine blood of Shakti, and thus a
powerful element. It is also identified
with the sun, with heat, dryness, and
withering force. When sulfur is mixed
and consumed with elemental mercury,
which is identified with the god Shiva’s
semen, the aspirant’s gross body is puri-
fied and refined, eventually rendering it
immortal. Modern descriptions of this
practice invariably warn that it should
only be carried out under the direction
of one’s guru (spiritual teacher), since
otherwise the combination will be
harmful. This warning is not surprising,
since by itself mercury is a deadly poison.

hushan B. Dasgupta, Obscure Religious
Cults, 1962; and David Gordon White,
The Alchemical Body, 1996.father of Rama. As Rama, his wife Sita,
and his brother Lakshmana are going
into exile, Sumantra accompanies
them to the River Ganges to make sure
that the trio will comply with their
orders. When the three board the boat
on which the boatman Guha will take
them over the river, Sumantra bids
Rama a tearful farewell.
Sulva SutrasSumitra
(“aphorisms on measurement”) A col-
lection of brief sayings giving the exact
rules for constructing the sacrificial
altars for the public Vedic sacrifices. The
Sulva Sutras were connected to the
Shrauta Sutras, which laid down the
ritual prescriptions for these rites, of
which the preparation of the site was
an obvious necessity. Given the
premise that the sacrifice would be
unsuccessful unless it was performed
exactly right, such precise attention
to the altar’s construction seems a
necessary consequence.
Sumantra
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Sumantra is one of
the ministers of King Dasharatha, the
Sumati
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
King Sagar. Through a sage’s boon,
Sumati and her co-wife Keshini are
given a choice in the number of children
they would bear—one will bear a single
son through whom the lineage will con-
tinue, whereas the other will bear sixty
thousand sons who will die before they
have any offspring. Sumati chooses the
latter, and when her sixty thousand
handsome sons go out to search for
their father’s sacrificial horse, they are
burned to ash by the fury of the sage
Kapila. Although these sons die without
issue they still have a profound affect on
the world, since Keshini’s descendants
bring the River Ganges down to earth to
bring peace to their souls.
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Sumitra is one of the
three wives of King Dasharatha and the
mother of Rama’s half-brothers, the
twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna. In
their fidelity and service to Rama, her
sons are important characters in the
epic, but aside from bearing them,
Sumitra has little importance.
Sun
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
generally associated with strength and
vitality, although it can be malevolent,
possibly reflecting the relentless
destructive power of the Indian sun. The
sun’s vitality makes it a strong planet,
and as in Western astrology the sun’s
position in the zodiac plays a major role
in fixing a person’s natal horoscope
[[669]]
Sundaramurtti
The Sun Temple at Konarak, Orissa. It was built in the thirteenth century
to resemble the chariot that was believed to carry the sun.
(janampatrika). The sun presides over
Sunday, a day of the week that is not
strongly marked as either auspicious or
inauspicious. See also Surya.
Sundaramurtti
(8th c.) The last of the Nayanars, a
group of sixty-three southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhak-
ta) of the god Shiva. Along with their
contemporaries the Alvars, who were
devotees of Vishnu, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of
Hindu religion through their passion-
ate devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language. Along with his prede-
cessors, Appar and Sambandar,
Sundaramurtti actively opposed the
heterodox sects of the times, particu-
larly the Jains, whom he reviles in his
poems. The collected hymns of the
three most important Nayanars—Appar,
Sambandar, and Sundaramurtti—com-
prise the Devaram, the most sacred of
[[670]]

the Tamil Shaivite texts. Sundaramurtti
is also important for his catalog of the
sixty-three Nayanars, which forms
the first literary source for Tamil
Shaivite hagiography.
Sundareshvara
(The “Handsome Lord”) Epithet of the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
husband of the goddess Minakshi.
Minakshi is the presiding deity of the
Minakshi temple in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. See Shiva.
Sunday
(Ravivar) First day of the Hindu week,
whose presiding planet (and deity) is
the sun (ravi). As a day, Sunday is con-
sidered generally auspicious but not
particularly powerful, probably because
the sun is acknowledged as a deity but is
not widely worshiped as a primary one.Surat-Shabd-Yoga
Sun TempleSurapana
The most famous temple to the sun is at
Konarak in Orissa state, right on the
shore of the Bay of Bengal. The temple
was built by King Narasimhadeva (r.
[[1238]]
–1264), a monarch in the Ganga
dynasty, and the entire temple was
intended to be a likeness of the sun’s
chariot. It has twelve great wheels
carved on the sides at the temple’s low-
est level, and in front, statues of several
colossal horses. As at the temples of
Khajuraho, the lower levels here are
covered with erotic and sexually explicit
carvings, to which people have given
differing interpretations: Some claim
that these sanction carnal pleasure as a
religious path, some interpret them alle-
gorically as representing human union
with the divine, and still others view
them as teaching that the desire for
pleasure must ultimately be transcended
to attain the divine.
The temple was built on a massive
scale; according to one estimate, the
central spire would have been over 200
feet high. It is uncertain whether this
spire was ever actually completed, since
the sandy soil on which the temple plat-
form was built would have been unable
to support the weight of such an enor-
mous structure. This same unstable soil
has been the greatest contributor to the
temple’s increasing deterioration. The
primary structure left at the site is the
jagamohan (assembly hall), which was
filled with sand in the nineteenth century,
in an effort to prevent further collapse.
For further information see Roy Craven,
Indian Art, 1997.(“liquor-drinking”) In the dharma liter-
ature, one of the Four Great Crimes
whose commission made one an out-
cast from society. Although in modern
times the word sura is the term for
“wine,” here it was believed to refer to a
particular type of spirituous liquor
made from rice flour. For members of
the three highest social groups—brah-
mins, kshatriyas, and vaishyas, the
most commonly prescribed penance
(prayashchitta) for habitually drinking
sura was to drink this same beverage
boiling hot, until one died. Interestingly,
this penalty does not apply to members
of the lowest social class, the shudras.
This difference reflected their lower sta-
tus, in which they were not held to the
same sorts of scrupulous standards as
the “twice-born.” Despite the harsh
penalty for drinking sura, there were
other sorts of intoxicants that kshatriyas
and vaishyas could drink without penalty,
although brahmins who drank these
had to perform mild penances.
Suparna
(“having beautiful wings”) Epithet of the
god Vishnu’s vehicle, the divine eagle
Garuda. See Garuda.
Superhuman Powers
Widely believed to be attainable, either
through voluntarily suffering harsh phys-
ical asceticism (tapas) or as products of
high spiritual attainment. See Siddhi.
Surasa
In Hindu mythology, Surasa is the mother
of all the Nagas, a class of minor
divinities conceived in the form of ser-
pents. In the Ramayana, the earlier of
the two great Indian epics, Surasa takes
the form of a gigantic serpent to test the
fortitude of the monkey-god Hanuman,
who jumps over the sea to Lanka to
search for Sita, the god Rama’s kid-
napped wife. Surasa tells Hanuman that
no one can go by without passing
through her mouth, and in response
Hanuman makes himself larger and
larger. Surasa in turn opens her jaws
wider and wider, and finally Hanuman
becomes very small and darts in and out
of her mouth. Surasa, pleased with
Hanuman’s ingenuity and courage, gives
him her blessing.
Surat-Shabd-Yoga
Mystical discipline in the Radha Soami
religious community, which stresses the
[[671]]
Surdas
joining (yoga) of the spirit (surat) with
the Divine Sound (shabd). The Divine
Sound emanates from the Supreme
Being and is always present. Most peo-
ple cannot hear it due to their preoccu-
pation with worldly things. With proper
training and devotion to a true guru
(satguru), anyone can eventually
become attuned to the Divine Sound,
and resonate in harmony with it. The
most important part of this path is con-
tact with a true guru, since only a true
guru has access to the divine and is con-
sidered a manifestation of the divine
itself. Devotion to a true guru is the sin-
gle most important factor in a person’s
spiritual development, and this spiritual
progress hinges on complete surrender
to the guru’s grace.
This metaphor of the Divine Sound,
and human resonance with it, has much
in common with the images used by
Guru Nanak, the first of the Sikh gurus,
and with the Nathpanthis before him.
The overwhelming stress on a guru
makes it possible for this religious
discipline to be practiced by just
about anyone, and most of the Radha
Soami followers are householders living
in the world rather than ascetics. For
further information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1990;
Lawrence Babb, Redemptive Encounters,
[[1987]]
; and Mark Juergensmeyer, Radha-
soami Reality, 1991.
Surdas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are
devotees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all
eight poets are also named as members
of the community and as associates
of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. In this literature, as
recounted in the Chaurasi Vaishnavan
ki Varta (“Lives of eighty-four
[[672]]

Vaishnavas”), it was at Vallabhacharya’s
order that Surdas began to compose
poems about Krishna’s lila, his playful
interactions with the world and
his devotees. He then proceeded to
compose the 5,000-odd poems of
the Sursagar.
The oldest manuscripts paint a much
different picture of Surdas, for most of
them contain only a few hundred
poems, which are usually quite short.
The most important themes in the early
poetry are supplication (vinaya) and
separation (viraha), and although one
also finds the depictions of Krishna’s
childhood for which Surdas has become
most famous, these themes are more
important later in the poetic tradition.
Surdas’s poetry thus shows a wide range
of themes, from his own spiritual life to
devotional “glimpses” of Krishna; the
latter most commonly explore the reli-
gious tension between the image of
Krishna as a charming child and his alter
ego as lord of the universe. As in much of
Vaishnava devotional poetry, Surdas
composed these poems to invite his
hearers to enter Krishna’s world.
The difference between these
pictures raises doubts about the
connection between Surdas and
Vallabhacharya. Although songs by
Surdas have been worked into the rites
of the Pushti Marg, Surdas composed
no poetry in praise of Vallabhacharya,
unlike the other ashtachap poets. It
seems just as likely that, as the popular-
ity of Surdas’s poems grew, he was
“claimed” by the Pushti Marg as a fellow
Krishna devotee. In fact, there is very lit-
tle definitely known about him, includ-
ing whether or not he was actually blind,
as is generally accepted. Only two of the
oldest poems mention blindness; one of
these is clearly metaphorical, and the
other is part of a litany of the woes of old
age. As with so many of the bhakti
poets, one knows a great deal more
about the poems than the poet. For

Hawley, Krishna: The Butter Thief, 1983;

Sureshvara
Philosopher in the Advaita Vedanta
school, and one of two attested
disciples of the school’s founder,
Shankaracharya (788–820?), the other
being Padmapada. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical position known
as monism, which is the belief that a sin-
gle Ultimate Reality lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely dif-
fering forms of that reality. Advaita pro-
ponents exemplify this belief in their
claim that reality is nondual (advaita)—
that is, that all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity. For Advaita proponents, the
assumption that the world is real as per-
ceived is a fundamental misunderstand-
ing of the ultimate nature of things and
a manifestation of avidya. Although
often translated as “ignorance,” avidya
is better understood as the lack of gen-
uine understanding, which ultimately
causes human beings to be trapped in
karmic bondage, reincarnation (sam-
sara), and suffering.
In Hindu thought, Sureshvara is the
only explicit proponent of leap philoso-
phy, although one can see traces of this
in the other figures in Advaita Vedanta,
particularly in his teacher. Leap philoso-
phy affirms that one can attain com-
plete freedom from bondage, which in
the Indian context is identified as the
end of reincarnation and final liberation
of the soul (moksha), but that such free-
dom cannot be gained by a precisely
specified sequence of causes and
effects. According to Sureshvara, since
the ultimate problem stems from one’s
mistaken understanding, the only solu-
tion can come from purified, correct
understanding. Sureshvara’s path, such
as it is, is to use a negative dialectic to
distinguish clearly what the Self is not,
and when one’s mind has been pre-
pared, to gain a flash of mystic insight
through hearing one of the mahavakyas
(“great utterances”) that identify the
Self with Brahman. Sureshvara affirms
that actions can have no part in this
process, since action is bound up with
the world and is pervaded by igno-
rance. For further information see A. J.
Alston (trans.), The Naiskarmya Siddhi
of Sri Suresvara, 1959; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara
and His Pupils, 1981.
Sursagar
(“Ocean of Sur”) Corpus of poetry in the
Braj Bhasha language ascribed to the
northern Indian poet-saint Surdas.
Traditional versions of the Sursagar are
divided into twelve parts, to mirror the
structure of the Bhagavata Purana,
which is the most important Sanskrit
source for the mythology of the god
Krishna. Surdas was a Krishna devotee
(bhakta), and this arrangement is a way
to confer the luster of an authoritative
Sanskrit text on vernacular religious
poetry. Just as the Bhagavata Purana
lavishly describes Krishna’s youthful
exploits, the Sursagar is most commonly
associated with poems painting
intimate and affectionate pictures
of Krishna’s childhood.
Although the poetry published in
editions of the Sursagar is ascribed to
Surdas, most of it is certainly pseudony-
mous. The oldest manuscripts of
Surdas’s poetry have at most a few hun-
dred poems, and the size of this corpus
roughly doubles every century, reaching
the five thousand poems in the present
Sursagar. The general tone of the earliest
poems also shows a marked thematic
difference. Although they include
Krishna’s childhood, a far greater per-
centage express the poet’s pangs of sep-
aration (viraha) from Krishna or com-
plaint (vinaya) about his spiritual trou-
bles. Even the earliest manuscripts show
no common body of poems, and it
seems likely that from the very begin-
ning the “Surdas” poetic tradition was
drawn from the songs of wandering
singers, a characterization that fits well
with the image of the poet himself. For

Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs of the
Saints of India, 1988.
Surya
The sun, both in its physical form as a
celestial phenomenon and personified
as a deity. The sun has been an impor-
tant deity as far back as the Vedas, the
earliest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, and has retained a posi-
tion of some importance since that time.
One example of this is the Gayatri
Mantra, a sacred formula that is sup-
posed to be recited every day by twice-
born males, that is, men from the three
“twice-born” groups—brahmin, ksha-
triya, and vaishya—who have under-
gone the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” The
Gayatri Mantra invokes the sun as the
generator and nourisher of all things,
and requests him to stimulate the minds
[[674]]

of those who perceive him. Surya is still
worshiped by many Smarta brahmins as
one of the “five-fold” (panchayatana)
deities (the others being Shiva, Vishnu,
the Goddess, and Ganesh), a practice
attributed to the Advaita philosopher
Shankaracharya. For some time Surya
was also the primary deity for certain
communities, particularly in eastern
India, although his cult has been largely
eclipsed in recent times. The most
spectacular example of this worship
is the temple of the sun at Konarak
(now ruined), whose claims to fame
stem from its enormous size and
the profuse erotic sculptures on its
exterior walls. For further information

Suryapraksha
(“effulgence of the sun”) Name given to
the banner that is the symbolic emblem
of the Mahanirvani Akhara, a particular
group of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into different akharas or regi-
ments on the model of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Nagas’ primary occupation was as
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests; both
of these have largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have particular features that signify
their organizational identity, and this
particular banner—one with strong
connections to a martial identity—is
one such feature.
Suryavarman II
(r. 1112–1153) Ruler of the Khmer peo-
ple in Cambodia, whose reign saw the
construction of the massive temple
complex at Angkor Wat. Although
Suryavarman and his people were
native Cambodians, the temples at
Angkor Wat were dedicated to Hindu
deities, showing the vast influence of
contemporary Indian culture.
Sushruta
(4th c.) Physician and writer who is tra-
ditionally regarded as the author of the
Sushruta Samhita. Along with the
slightly earlier Charaka Samhita, the
Sushruta Samhita is one of the two
major sources for ayurveda, an Indian
medical tradition.
Sushruta Samhita
Along with the slightly earlier Charaka
Samhita, one of the two major sources
for the Indian medical tradition known
as ayurveda. Underlying ayurveda is the
theory of the three bodily humors—vata
(wind), pitta (bile), and kapha (phlegm).
Each is composed of different elements,
and although everyone has all three
humors, their varying proportions are
used to explain differing body types,
metabolic dispositions, and personali-
ties. The cause of disease is an imbal-
ance of these humors—whether
caused by environmental sources or
personal habits—whereas the state of
this equilibrium is the state of health.
The Sushruta Samhita has been edited
and translated into various languages,
and served as a source for secondary
studies, such as Debiprasad Chatto-
padhyaya, Science and Society in Ancient
India, 1977.
Sushumna
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conceptions of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the
material body. It is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are the bodily abodes of the two
divine principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power)—the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini—
conceived in the form of a coiled ser-
pent. In the types of yoga that focus on
the subtle body, the ultimate aim is to
awaken the kundalini, and move it up
through the chakras to the abode of
Shiva. The union of Shiva and Shakti in
the aspirant’s body mirrors the action
of these divine forces in the macro-
cosm, and with this union the aspirant
gains bliss and final liberation of the
soul (moksha).
The sushumna is the middle of the
three vertical channels in the subtle
body—the side channels are the ida
nadi and the pingala nadi—and it is by
far the most important of the three. The
sushumna provides the pathway for the
rising kundalini as it awakens and
straightens during the aspirant’s spiritu-
al exercises, piercing through the
chakras on its way. In most people the
[[675]]
Suta
sushumna is closed where it intersects
the chakras, which blocks the flow of
energy from moving smoothly through
it. When the chakras have been pierced
and opened by the rising kundalini, the
passageway has been opened for the
kundalini to rise to the abode of Shiva,
and effect the union of Shakti and Shiva
that will bring ultimate realization. For

Tantra, 1973; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1975; and

the Three Cities, 1990.
Suta
In Hindu mythology, a disciple of the
sage Vyasa, who is said to have recounted
the puranas to other renunciants in the
Naimisha forest. The puranas are an
important genre of religious texts that
collect all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Individual puranas are usu-
ally highly sectarian and intended to
promote the worship of one of the
Hindu gods, whether Vishnu, Shiva, or
the Goddess. The traditional puranas
are numbered at eighteen, and in
many of them Suta is named as the
narrator, in accordance with the legend
mentioned above.
Sutakashaucha
The impurity (ashaucha) caused by
childbirth (sutaka). All bodily effluvia
(hair, spittle, pus, blood, etc.) are
considered to be sources of impurity,
and because birth is attended with
these it is considered impure, even
though it is always regarded as an
auspicious and happy event. There is
also impurity caused by death, known as
maranashaucha, but the presence of
the corpse renders this impurity more
violent; needless to say, it is also consid-
ered inauspicious.
[[676]]

Sutra
(“thread”) In a metaphorical sense, a
sutra is a short phrase or aphorism that
can easily be committed to memory.
Many early philosophical and grammat-
ical texts were collections of such sutras,
which are so brief that they virtually pre-
suppose a commentary to explain their
meaning. In many cases the commen-
tary would have been an oral exchange
between teacher and student, thus
effecting the living transmission that is
still the norm in tantra, a secret, ritually
based religious practice. Memorizing
such sutras was a way to gain mastery
over an entire text, and the sutras could
also serve as an aid to memory for the
commentary, thus enabling a person to
preserve the “thread” of the argument.
In a more literal sense, the word sutra
can also refer to the cord or cords strung
through the centers of palm leaf manu-
scripts, which kept the pages of the text
in their proper order.
Svadharma
(“one’s own dharma”) In the dharma lit-
erature, svadharma is an individual’s
unique religious duty (dharma), based
on that person’s social position, stage of
life, and gender. The governing assump-
tion behind this notion is that every per-
son has a social role to fulfill, and each of
these roles is necessary for the mainte-
nance of society, no matter how humble
it might be. For each person, his or her
svadharma carries the highest authority,
and supersedes all other religious laws.
As one example, violence is generally
prohibited, but it is a necessary part of a
ruler’s svadharma—both to protect the
land from external invaders, and to pun-
ish criminals within the country. In both
cases the use of violence helps to main-
tain social order, which is the king’s pri-
mary duty. In the same way, society
depends on a host of other people fulfill-
ing their particular social roles. This
notion of social responsibility and inter-
connectedness is tied to religious fulfill-
ment through the notion of the Path of
Action (karmamarga). According to thisSvakiya
idea, selflessly performing one’s social
duty, for the good of the world rather
than through selfish desire, was also a
path to ultimate spiritual fulfillment and
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
According to this conception, since
every svadharma is potentially a path to
final liberation, each person has a path
that only he or she can tread.svadhishthana chakra is associated with
the human capacity for reproduction. It
is also identified as the bodily seat for
the subtle element of water, the fluid
medium through which reproduction is
possible. For further information see

Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Svadhishthana ChakraSvadhyaya
In many schools of yoga, and in the eso-
teric ritual tradition known as tantra,
the svadhishthana chakra is one of the
six psychic centers (chakras) believed to
exist in the subtle body. The subtle body
is an alternate physiological system,
believed to exist on a different plane
than gross matter but with certain corre-
spondences to the material body. It is
visualized as a set of six psychic centers,
which are conceived as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along the
course of the spine, connected by three
vertical channels. Each of these chakras
has important symbolic associations—
with differing human capacities, with
different subtle elements (tanmatras),
and with different seed syllables (bijak-
sharas) formed from the letters of the
Sanskrit alphabet, thus encompassing
all sacred sound. Above and below these
centers are the bodily abodes of Shiva
(awareness) and Shakti (power), the two
divine principles through which the
entire universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept of the subtle body is thus
the fundamental similarity and inter-
connectedness of macrocosm and
microcosm, an essential Hindu idea
since the time of the mystical texts
known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally list-
ed from the bottom up, and the svad-
hishthana chakra is the second. It is
visualized as a six-petaled lotus located
in the region of the genitals. The petals
each contain a seed syllable formed
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in
this case the consonants from “ba”
to “la.” On a symbolic level, the(“study”) Study of the sacred texts,
which connotes oral recitation, since
these texts were traditionally studied by
reciting them. This is one of the meth-
ods named in the Yoga Sutras as one of
the preparatory elements to yoga, since
the text claims that such study attenu-
ates one’s karmic hindrances and fosters
the ability to enter trance. Even in mod-
ern times the act of reciting a religious
text is seen to have multiple spiritual
benefits and, if performed over a long
period of time, to be able to transform
the person reciting.
Svakiya
(“belonging to oneself”) Mode of con-
ceiving the relationship between lover
and beloved, in which the man
and woman are married to each
other. The svakiya relationship is
socially respectable—sanctioned by
society, upholding social propriety,
fruitful, and procreative in its course.
Although this mode of relationship
is rich and celebrated, this very
social approval is said to make it
less intense than the adulterous parakiya
relationship, in which the lovers gain
nothing but their love itself. Although
in most cases the union between
the god Krishna and his consort
Radha is described as parakiya, some
Vaishnava communities—such as the
Radhavallabh community—claim that
this relationship is svakiya, perhaps
reflecting reservations about endorsing
adultery, even by the deities.
[[677]]
Svaprakasha
lilas in the town of Brindavan—they are
actually considered to be forms of the
deity, revealed within the context of the
lila. As one sign of this status, a regular
feature of such performances is time set
aside for darshan, in which the actors sit
perfectly still for the viewers to view
them as an act of worship, in the same
way that people would interact with an
image in a temple.
Svastika
In Indian traditions the image of a svastika, arms
pointed in a clockwise direction, symbolizes life,
prosperity, and good fortune.
Svaprakasha
(“self-revealing”) In Indian philosophy,
the notion that certain things such as
knowledge are self-revealing and do not
need anything else in order to be known.
The issue about whether these things
existed, and what they were if they did,
was a source of lively disagreement
among Indian thinkers.
Svarup
(“own-form”) In popular devotional dra-
mas such as the Ram Lila, which is
based on the story of the Ramayana,
svarup is the name for the child-actors
(most often brahmin boys) playing the
parts of the gods and goddesses.
Viewing these performances is not sim-
ply entertainment but also an act of reli-
gious devotion, since such dramas are
considered to be ways in which the gods
reveal themselves to their devotees
(bhakta). When the actors are in make-
up and in character—or wearing
crowns, as in the case of the Krishna
[[678]]

Although in the modern mind the
svastika is indelibly associated with
Adolph Hitler’s Germany, it has a long
and venerable history as an Indian sym-
bol, predating the Nazis by several thou-
sand years. The name is compounded
from su (“good”) + asti (“to be”) + ka
(“making”), and a general translation
would be something like “bringing good
fortune.” In Hindu India the svastika is a
symbol of life, prosperity, and good for-
tune, at least when the arms are point-
ing in a clockwise direction. Circling an
object in this direction presents one’s
right side to the central object, and since
this side is considered purer, the svastika
with arms pointing clockwise is consid-
ered more auspicious than its counter-
clockwise counterpart.
Svastikasana
(“svastika-posture”) One of the sitting
postures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras. In this posi-
tion, the right foot is inserted into the
space between the left thigh and calf,
and the left foot into the space between
the right thigh and calf (one of the feet is
pointing upwards, and the other down-
ward). The opposing directions of the
feet and the crossed legs evokes images
of the svastika, hence the name.
Svatahpramanya
(“self-validating”) In Indian philosophy,
the notion that certain things, such as
knowledge, are self-validating. This
means that they can be definitively
known to be true in themselves, withoutSvayamsevak
reference to any of the other pramanas,
the means by which human beings can
gain true and accurate knowledge. The
issue about whether these things existed,
and what they were if they did, was a
source of lively disagreement among
Indian thinkers.
Svayambhu
(“self-born”) Epithet of the god Brahma.
This name underscores his role as the
fashioner of the worlds—as the agent
responsible for arranging the cosmos,
he cannot himself be a created being.
According to Hindu mythology, at the
beginning of each cycle of creation
Brahma emerges from the calyx of a
lotus that sprouts from the god Vishnu’s
navel; at the time of cosmic dissolution
he again enters the lotus, and is reab-
sorbed into Vishnu’s body. See Brahma.
Svayambhu
(“self-manifested”) Images
Name denoting any image of a Hindu
divinity believed to exist by virtue of
divine self-revelation, rather than by
being made or established by human
hands. These images are believed to be
intensely holy and powerful, and to have
a more pronounced sense of the deity’s
presence. They mark instances where
these deities have revealed themselves
out of grace, in order to become accessi-
ble to their devotees (bhakta), and
they are places where the deities are
believed to be particularly present and
“awake,” and thus more receptive to
requests for favors.
Svayambhu images can be found for
each of the three major Hindu deities.
Images of the Goddess are often natural
rock formations, such as the image of
the goddess Kamakhya, which is a nat-
ural cleft in the rock, or the stone images
of many of the Shiwalik goddesses; they
can take other forms as well, such as the
image of the goddess Jwalamukhi,
which is a burning vent of natural gas.
For the god Vishnu, the best-known
self-manifested form is the shalagram, a
black stone containing the spiral-
shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea
creature, which is believed to be a sym-
bol of his discus (chakra). The god
Shiva’s pillar-shaped symbol known as
the linga appears in the widest variety of
self-manifested forms. Many of these
self-manifested lingas are found in nat-
ural rock formations, such as at
Kedarnath; Amarnath, where the linga
appears as a pillar of ice; and the bana
linga, which is a naturally rounded
stone, usually small enough to be easily
portable. Further, in the Hindu religious
groups that stress the subtle body, both
Shiva and the Goddess are believed to
be present within one’s own body. In
some cases for all these deities, carved
images are claimed to be self-manifest
forms; in their usual motif the statue’s
location is revealed to a favored devotee
in a dream. A self-manifested image
is a powerful claim for any site and will
bolster its importance as a place of
divine access.
Svayamsevak
(“volunteer”) Rank-and-file member of
the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
The RSS is a conservative Hindu organi-
zation the express purpose of which is
to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India; for most of its
history it has characterized its mission
as cultural and character-building
rather than religious or political. The
svayamsevaks are the rank-and-file
members of the local RSS branches
(shakhas), and are thus “foot soldiers”
who make up the organization’s core
membership. The shakhas in any given
area are overseen by a full-time RSS
worker known as a pracharak (“direc-
tor”), who serves as a liaison between
the local units and the RSS leadership,
and oversees RSS activity in his area.
The svayamsevak is the lowest level
of RSS membership. Most members do
not advance beyond this rank, since to
do so requires complete commitment to
the RSS and its ideals; those who do,
however, are usually gifted leaders. The
[[679]]
Svayamvara
primary stress at the shakha level is on
forming personal relationships with
other members, as a way to develop loy-
alty to the organization. Each shakha, or
local unit, holds a daily meeting.
Activities include an opening ceremony
in which the organization’s saffron ban-
ner is raised; traditional games or exer-
cises, including a martial drill; and a dis-
cussion period in which RSS ideals can
be disseminated and propagated.
Svayamvara
(“self-choice”) In Hindu mythology, a
form of marriage in which the bride
would choose the groom she wanted,
indicating her choice by placing her gar-
land around his neck. In the stories in
which a svayamvara occurs, the bride-
to-be is usually of royal lineage, as are
her suitors, so the bride’s choice was an
exercise fraught with potential political
consequences. One famous mythic
svayamvara was that of Nala and
Damayanti, in which Damayanti prefers
Nala even to the gods who have come as
suitors. This story also illustrates the
dangers of such a choice, when an
unhappy suitor cursed the couple to
endure separation and privation.
Swami Malai
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on a hill
in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu,
just outside the temple-town of
Kumbhakonam. Swami Malai is part of
the network of six temples in Tamil
Nadu built to honor Murugan, a hill
deity who has been assimilated into the
larger pantheon as a form of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva. Five of these
temples have been definitively identi-
fied, and each is associated with a par-
ticular region, a particular ecosystem,
and a particular incident in Murugan’s
mythic career. In the case of Swami
Malai, it is said to be where he taught the
meaning of the sacred syllable (Om) to
his father Shiva, and thus presents him
in the aspect of a teacher, which is one of
his identifying features in Shaiva
[[680]]

Siddhanta (a series of fourteen texts, all
completed by the fourteenth century
C.E., which reinterpret the ideas about
Shiva found in Nayanar devotional
poetry). The sixth of these temples is said
to be every other shrine to Murugan in
Tamil Nadu. This belief seems to stress
Murugan’s presence throughout Tamil
Nadu and sacrilize the entire landscape,
giving mythic significance to every
Murugan temple, no matter how small.
The cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic
vehicle for Tamil pride and identity, and
since the number six has connotations
of completeness—as in the six direc-
tions, or the six chakras in the subtle
body—it also suggests that nothing out-
side is needed. For further information
see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage Centers in
the Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in the
Journal of the American Academy of
Religion, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
Swaminarayan Sect
Modern religious community devoted to
the god Vishnu; its practice is based on
the life and teachings of Sahajananda
Swami (1781–1830), who was born near
the sacred city of Ayodhya in eastern
India but spent much of his life in the
western Indian state of Gujarat.
Sahajananda took initiation as an
ascetic and soon became a mahant, or
ascetic leader. His followers revered him
first as a religious preceptor (guru), and
later as a partial incarnation of the god
Krishna himself. They believed that
manifestations of the god Vishnu, such
as Krishna, are born on earth in times of
extreme trouble. It was in this latter
aspect that he was given the name
Swaminarayan (“Lord Narayan”), and
his followers believed that he was the
highest manifestation of God in human
form. The Swaminarayan sect has sev-
eral million lay devotees (bhakta), most
of whom are affluent Gujarati mer-
chants. In keeping with the commu-
nity’s ascetic roots, however, its most
important figures are the ascetics who
run the organization and who serve as
teachers and advisers to them. For furtherSYDA
information see Raymond Brady
Williams, A New Face of Hinduism, 1984.
SYDA
(Siddha Yoga Dham America) Religious
organization founded by Swami
Muktananda (1908–1982), which has
ashrams and centers around the world.
Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a modi-
fied form of Kashmiri Shaivism, but its
signature teaching is the notion that the
guru’s grace can immediately awaken
the disciple’s latent kundalini (spiritual
power, the most vital substance of the
subtle body) and speed the process of
spiritual development. This teaching
puts an even greater emphasis on the
importance of the guru as spiritual
teacher, and the overwhelming empha-
sis pervades the whole movement.
Although it has Indian members, most
of its followers are non-Indian converts,
who may be engaged in a spiritual
search but who have little interest in
becoming culturally Indian. The organi-
zation was headed by Muktananda until
his death in 1982; for most of the time
since then it has been presided over by
his successor, Chidvilasananda.

Tad Ekam
## T
Tad Ekam
(“That One”) Epithet used in Rg Veda
hymn 10.129, the so-called Creation
Hymn, to designate the first living being
on the earth. The four Vedas are the old-
est Hindu religious texts, and based on
its style and content, the Rg Veda is the
oldest of the Vedas. Most of the hymns in
the Rg Veda are invocations addressed to
various divinities, sung to propitiate
these divinities so that human beings
may enjoy the good things of this life.
The Creation Hymn takes a far more
speculative tone, standing in marked
contrast to the confidence and opti-
mism found in the earlier hymns. In the
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by
imagining a time before the existence of
Being and Nonbeing and speculates on
how the world came to be.
In the end, the poet ascribes all cre-
ation to a single impersonal agent, That
One (Tad Ekam). This hymn is notewor-
thy for ascribing the creation of the
world to a single power, an idea that
foreshadows the notion of Brahman in
the Upanishads, the speculative texts
that form the final stratum of the Vedic
literature. The name Tad Ekam, which is
grammatically a neuter noun, also fore-
shadows the notion found in the
Upanishads that Brahman is an imper-
sonal force. After describing how That
One formed the cosmos and knew all its
secrets, the poem ends with the conjec-
ture that perhaps That One may not be
omniscient and omnipotent after all.
This hymn thus further foreshadows the
Upanishads in its speculative tone and
its admission that the ultimate answer
may be unknown.

Tagore, Rabindranath
(1861–1941) Poet and Nobel laureate in
Literature, an honor bestowed in 1912
for his Gitanjali (“Garland of Songs”).
Tagore came from an influential and
extremely wealthy landed family and
was thus able to focus all his energy on
his literary work. Aside from his prodi-
gious literary output, he lectured exten-
sively both in India and in other
countries; in the latter he emphasized
the need to retain spiritual values,
whereas in India he more often gave his
attention to the need to fulfill people’s
material needs. In 1921 he established
the Vishva-Bharati University at
Shantiniketan in the state of West
Bengal. The university was dedicated to
providing an education that would satisfy
both of these needs and thus develop an
integrated human being. For further
information see Krishna Kripalani,
Rabindranath Tagore: A Biography, 1980;
and Donald R. Tuck, “Rabindranath
Tagore: Religion as a Constant Struggle
for Balance,” in Robert D. Baird (ed.),
Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Tagore Jayanti
Holiday marking the birth date of the
Bengali poet, writer, and thinker
Rabindranath Tagore, celebrated on
May 8, the day he was born in 1861. As
with most twentieth-century figures,
Tagore’s birthday is celebrated accord-
ing to the solar calendar of the common
era, rather than the lunar calendar that
governs most religious observances.
Although Tagore is best known for his lit-
erary work, he was also considered a
religious preceptor (guru), and thus his
birthday carries extra meaning.
Tai
Tenth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Makara (the zodiacal
sign of Capricorn), which usually falls
within January and February. The exis-
tence of several different calendars is
one clear sign of the continuingTala

importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient,
well-established
literary
tradition. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Takshaka
In Hindu mythology, a venomous ser-
pent-king from whose bite King
Parikshit is killed. After insulting a pow-
erful sage, Parikshit is cursed to die of a
snakebite within seven days. Parikshit
takes all possible precautions to avoid
his fate: He builds a house on a huge pil-
lar, has all things entering the house
carefully searched, and surrounds him-
self with physicians who can cure
snakebite. Six days pass without inci-
dent, but as the seventh day ends, peo-
ple begin to relax and bring in some fruit
to eat. Takshaka has concealed himself
as a tiny worm in one of the pieces of
fruit and, when the fruit is cut open,
changes into his real shape, bites the
king, and kills him.
Despite his fearsome role in this story,
an earlier story illustrates that Takshaka
is not entirely evil. Takshaka’s mother,
Kadru, bets her sister Vinata that the
tail of a certain celestial horse is black,
whereas Vinata claims it is white; the sis-
ter agrees that the loser will become a
servant to the winner. Kadru asks her
children, the serpents, to hang from the
back of the horse to make it appear as if
it is black and thus takes unfair advan-
tage. Some of her children, including
Takshaka, refuse to take part in such
deceit, and Kadru curses them to be
killed by Janamjeya, King Parikshit’s
son. Takshaka manages to escape this
curse—one of the few times that this
happens in Hindu mythic stories—but
most of his siblings are not so lucky.
Tala
In Indian music and dance, the most
general term for “rhythm,” either as
an accompaniment to music or dance
or played on a drum as a solo instru-
ment. The rhythmic systems in all
varieties of Indian music are extremely
rich and complex and require years of
study to master.
[[683]]
Talikota
Talikota
City in the Bijapur district of the state of
Karnataka, which in 1565 was the site of
a battle between the Vijayanagar
dynasty king Rama Raja and a coalition
of Muslim sultans from farther north in
the Deccan peninsula. Rama Raja’s dis-
astrous defeat brought the Vijayanagar
dynasty to an abrupt end. The sultans
sacked the empire’s capital at Hampi,
and it has never been inhabited since
that time.
Tamas
(“darkness”) One of the three funda-
mental qualities (gunas) believed to be
present in all things, the other two being
sattva (“goodness”) and rajas (“pas-
sion”). According to this model, the dif-
fering proportions of these qualities
account for the differences both in the
inherent nature of things and in individ-
ual human capacities and tendencies.
Of the three, tamas is always negative
and is associated with darkness, disease,
ignorance, sloth, spoilage, and death.
The notion of these three gunas origi-
nated in the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, and
although much of Samkhya meta-
physics connected with the gunas has
long been discredited, the idea of the
gunas and their qualities has become a
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
Tamil Epics
Collective name for three early Tamil
epic poems: the Shilappadigaram, the
Manimegalai, and the Shivaga-
Sindamani. These poems were com-
posed in about the sixth and seventh
centuries of the common era, when reli-
gious forms and cultural influence
(among them, the composition of epic
poems) were seeping in from the north
and influencing indigenous forms. Aside
from Sanskrit, Tamil is the only major
ancient literary language. All three of
these poems provide important infor-
mation about life in their contemporary
[[684]]

times, including religious life. In brief,
the Shilappadigaram (“The Jeweled
Anklet”) is a tragedy that highlights sev-
eral important themes that have pervaded
Hindu culture, particularly the need for
a king to rule righteously and the power
gained by a wife through her devotion to
her husband. The Manimegalai focuses
on a young woman of the same name,
who is wooed by the local prince but
eventually becomes a Buddhist nun.
Although the story clearly has a Buddhist
bias, Manimegalai has numerous debates
with people from competing religious
traditions. Finally, the Shivaga-
Sindamani describes the adventures of
Shivaga, a man who excels at every pos-
sible manly art, who with each new
challenge wins a new wife for his harem
but in the end renounces everything
to become a Jain monk. Although the
later two epics are respectively biased
toward Buddhist and Jain religious
values, they all give valuable informa-
tion about contemporary religious life.

Tamil Language
One of the four Dravidian languages,
along with Kannada, Telegu, and
Malayalam; all four languages are spo-
ken primarily in southern India. Tamil is
the predominant language in modern
Tamil Nadu, which is one of the “lin-
guistic states” formed after the Indians
gained independence. This state was
formed to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Although all four lan-
guages have literary and cultural signifi-
cance, Tamil has by far the richest
history as a literary language. Tamil liter-
ature begins in the early centuries of the
common era with the Sangam litera-
ture, eight collections of poetry that
focused equally on the external descrip-
tion of battle or internal descriptions of
love. The Sangam literature was fol-
lowed by the three Tamil epics: the
Shilappadigaram, the Manimegalai,
and the Shivaga-Sindamani. Between
the seventh and tenth centuries cameTamil Nadu
the devotional (bhakti) literature com-
posed by the Alvars and the Nayanars,
with the former expressing their devo-
tion to the god Vishnu and the latter to
the god Shiva. Their devotional poetry
was unprecedented in Hindu religious
history because it utilized everyday ver-
nacular language as a spectacular vehi-
cle for profound religious expression.
The Alvars’ poems became a founda-
tional text for the Shrivaishnava com-
munity, and the Nayanars’ for Shaiva
Siddhanta, and thus both of these col-
lections continue to be important in
Hindu religious life. Even today Tamil is
a vibrant literary language and a source
of intense regional pride to the people
living there; some of the most violent
recent demonstrations in southern
India were the so-called language riots,
protesting the imposition of Hindi as
the government language, a move that
was seen as a conscious attempt to mar-
ginalize Tamil language and culture.
Tamil Months
Although the lunar calendar is by far the
most important means for determining
the Hindu religious calendar, these
lunar months are also set in the frame-
work of a solar calendar. The latter is
used for the calculation of the inter-
calary month, which helps keep the
lunar and solar calendars in rough cor-
respondence. In northern India the
months of the solar calendar correlate
with the zodiac, with each month
named after the sign into which the sun
is reckoned as entering at the beginning
of that month. In southern India the
divisions of the solar calendar are exactly
the same as in the north, but the twelve
months are given different names. The
Tamil months take their names from
some of the nakshatras, or features in
the lunar zodiac, or from modifications
of the lunar months. The Tamil year
begins with the month of Chittirai,
which corresponds to the northern
Indian solar month of Mesha (the zodia-
cal sign of Aries), which by the Indian
calculations, falls within April and May.
The eleven months following Chittirai
are Vaikasi, Ani, Adi, Avani, Purattasi,
Aippasi, Kartigai, Margali, Tai, Masi,
and Panguni. Such different calendars
are one clear sign of the continuing
importance of regional cultural
patterns. This regional culture is partic-
ularly important in the Tamil cultural
area because Tamil is one of the few
regional languages with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition.
Tamil Nadu
(“land of the Tamils”) Modern Indian
state at the southern tip of the subconti-
nent, on the Bay of Bengal. Tamil Nadu
is one of the so-called linguistic states,
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Tamil Nadu was thus
formed from the Tamil-speaking areas
of the former state of Madras. Tamil
Nadu has a long and rich history, and
the Tamil literary tradition stretches
back to the early centuries of the com-
mon era. Successive regional dynas-
ties—the Pallavas, Cholas, and
Pandyas—built a host of temples in the
characteristic Dravida architectural
style, and even today Tamil Nadu has
hundreds of temple towns, that is,
towns in which the urban hub is an
enormous temple complex that includes
shops, markets, offices, and residential
space. Modern Tamil culture is the prod-
uct of this long and ancient tradition,
and Tamils pride themselves in having
been influenced little by outsiders—nei-
ther by the Hindu influences from
northern India, nor by the Muslim cul-
ture whose influence was so profound in
regions farther north. Tamil Nadu has so
many cultural sites and holy places that
it is impossible to name them, but the
most important are Rameshvaram,
Chidambaram, Madurai, Tiruchi-
rappalli, Kanchipuram, Mahabalipuram,
Kumbhakonam, Thiruvaiyaru, Tanjore,
and Kanyakumari; there is also a net-
work of six temples to the god Murugan
scattered in different areas of the state,

Tamoyoga
One of the three classes of beings in the
Dvaita Vedanta philosophical school,
founded by the philosopher Madhva
(1197–1276). Madhva’s fundamental
assumption was that God was utterly
transcendent, above and beyond the
world and human beings. The strength
of this conviction led him to stress theTanmatras
importance of grace as the sole means
of salvation because human beings were
unable to save themselves. Given this
dire view of human capacities, Madhva
divided the beings of the world into
three classes: The muktiyogas were des-
tined for final liberation, the nityasam-
sarins were destined for eternal rebirth,
and the tamoyogas were predestined for
eternal damnation.city’s Brhadeshvar temple, and his
son Rajendra (r. 1014–1042 C.E.),
whose greatest monument is the temple
at
Gangaikondacholapuran.
The
Brhadeshvar temple is dedicated to
Shiva as the “Great Lord”; some of
the most notable of the other temples

TandavaTanka
Name denoting one of the two broad
categories in Indian dance. The tandava
style is athletic and dramatic and con-
veys violence and power, whereas the
other dance form, lasya, is soft and lyri-
cal and conveys a mood of love. The tan-
dava style received its name from the
tandava dance of the god Shiva.
According to tradition, this is the dance
through which Shiva destroys the world
when its time has come. Not all of the
dance’s mythic connotations are violent,
since this athletic dance is also said to
be the one through which Shiva van-
quished the goddess Kali in a dance
contest, when her feminine modesty
prevented her from imitating his style.Name for a small chisel used by stone
workers, one of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography. The tanka
is mainly associated with Shiva and
is a minor artifact because it generally
appears only when the deity has
multiple arms and is holding a number
of objects.
Tanjore
City and district in the southern Indian
state of Tamil Nadu, the eastern bound-
ary of which is the Bay of Bengal. The
Tanjore district lies in the Cauvery River
delta, south of the river’s main channel;
even today this extremely fertile area
grows a large percentage of India’s rice.
This district was the core homeland of
the Chola dynasty, and the land’s agri-
cultural fecundity was the underlying
source of the dynasty’s power, which at
one point stretched through most of
southern India and even extended to
Malaysia. The Chola dynasty used
their wealth and power to build
enormous temples throughout Tamil
Nadu, but especially in the Tanjore
district and Tanjore city, their capital.
The Chola zenith came with King Raja
Raja (r. 985–1014 C.E.), who built Tanjore
Tanmatras
The tanmatras are the subtle elements,
the subtle forms of the five gross ele-
ments (earth, air, fire, water, and
akasha) from which the gross elements
are derived. The senses corresponding
to the subtle elements are gandha
(smell) for earth, sparsha (touch) for air,
rupa (shape) for fire, rasa (taste) for
water, and shabda (sound) for akasha.
The tanmatras first appeared in the
account of the evolution of the universe
propounded by the Samkhya school,
one of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy. In the Samkhya
account, the subtle elements are the
stage of evolution preceding the evolu-
tion of the gross elements. The Samkhya
school espoused an atheistic dualism in
which the two fundamental principles
were purusha (spirit) and prakrti
(matter); all of this evolution was associ-
ated with prakrti because, according
to the Samkhyas, the purusha
never changed. The Samkhya account
of evolution was appropriated by
other groups—although these groups
often adapted it to reflect theistic
assumptions in which the world
came from God—and thus the notion
[[687]]
Tantra
of the subtle elements became an
accepted philosophical convention.
Tantra
General term for a genre of secret ritually
based religious practices. These are
most often laid out in texts also known
as tantras (“loom”), so named because
these texts weave a distinctive picture of
reality. In popular Hindu culture, tantric
practitioners (tantrikas) are associated
with illicit sexuality, with consuming
forbidden things such as meat and
liquor, and with having the ability to kill
or harm others through black magic.
Such power and perceived amorality
make tantrikas objects of fear, a quality
that some people have used to their
advantage. A more neutral assessment
of tantra would stress three qualities:
secrecy, power, and nondualism, the
ultimate unity of all things.
Secrecy in tantra serves two func-
tions. On the one hand, it conceals the
rites and practices from the uninitiated,
who are seen as unqualified to receive it,
and on the other, it creates a religious
subcommunity with a particularly
defined identity and sense of privilege.
This sense of exclusivity, of being privy to
something to which few have access, is
one of the reasons that tantra is seen as a
higher religious practice. Even when the
text of a tantra has been written down, it
is always assumed that the texts are life-
less without the instruction of a qualified
person. This stress on personal transmis-
sion means that diksha (a type of initia-
tion) is the only way to gain access to this
tradition, and thus tantra stresses the
importance of the guru-disciple rela-
tionship even more strongly than does
the Hindu tradition as a whole. Gurus are
free to initiate anyone they deem quali-
fied. Although many tantrikas are twice-
born men, that is, members of the three
highest classes (varnas)—brahmins,
kshatriyas, and vaishyas—who have
received the adolescent religious initia-
tion known as the second birth, in theory
tantric practice is open to all people,
regardless of gender or social status.
[[688]]

Power in tantra is manifested in vari-
ous ways. One of these comes in the
transmission of the teaching itself, in
which the guru’s empowerment is
believed necessary to “activate” the
transmitted
material,
particularly
mantras. Tantric practice is also claimed
to be far more powerful than regular reli-
gious practice and thus more efficacious
in bringing final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The usual claim is that tantra’s
potency can bring such liberation in a
single lifetime, whereas other forms of
religious practice take untold aeons.
Such powerful forces must be kept secret
from the uninitiated, thus the stress on
secrecy. It is widely accepted that the
spiritual attainments gained through
tantric practice also bring superhuman
powers (siddhi), as a natural byproduct
of such attainment. Although aspirants
are discouraged from seeking such pow-
ers because the act of seeking is seen as
rooted in selfish desire, those who gain
such powers without seeking are
believed to be able to exercise them
without being corrupted.
For tantrikas, nondualism—the
assertion that all reality is ultimately one
thing—is both a philosophical affirma-
tion and the operative principle behind
their religious practice. Tantrikas usually
conceive of this unity theistically, seeing
their chosen deity (ishtadevata) as the
material, efficient, and final cause of all
reality. For tantrikas, definitively realiz-
ing the essential oneness of all things
removes the mistaken understanding
that causes bondage and rebirth and
brings final liberation. Tantric practice
affirms this nondualism, often through
rituals stressing the unification of oppo-
sites. For this reason, some tantrikas
make ritual use of things that are nor-
mally forbidden, most notably the “Five
Forbidden Things” (panchamakara):
fish, wine, meat, parched grain, and sex-
ual intercourse. In theory, this rite is a
means to break down duality because it
violates societal norms forbidding con-
sumption of intoxicants, nonvegetarian
food, and illicit sexuality, in a conscious
effort to sacralize what is normallyTaraka
forbidden. Although this rite collapses
conventional boundaries of good and
bad, pure and impure, the goal is to
replace external rites (bahiryaga) with
interior ones (antaryaga), thus explod-
ing the duality of subject and object. The
paradigm for this interior practice is
tantric yoga. This is usually some vari-
ant of kundalini yoga, in which the two
divine principles of Shiva and Shakti
are ultimately united in the expert’s
subtle body. The final vehicle for tantric
practice comes in rituals using symbolic
diagrams (yantra), of which one exam-
ple is the shrichakra. These are often
particular to specific tantric lineages
(parampara) and thus ground the
aspirant in a particular tradition. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,

Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas

Cities, 1990.
Tantrika
Name denoting a practitioner of tantra,
a secret ritually based religious practice.
Tapas
(“heat”) Term denoting any physical
asceticism, or what in earlier times was
referred to as mortification of the flesh.
The term tapas encompasses rites of
denial, such as fasting (upavasa) or
celibacy, as well as rites of enduring
physical pain, such as the “five fires”
(panchagni) rite. In this rite a person
sits during the hot season surrounded
by four fires, with the fifth fire being the
sun overhead. Other rites include
enduring cold from bathing (snana) in
snow-fed rivers, and enduring any other
sort of physical discomfort. The word
tapas can also describe bizarre and even
masochistic behaviors, such as remain-
ing standing for years on end; keeping
an arm upraised until the muscles atro-
phy, and it cannot be lowered; lying on
beds of thorns and nails, and so forth.
The governing assumption behind all of
these practices is that they generate
spiritual power (seen figuratively as
“heat”) and that a person who generates
and amasses enough of this power
will gain supernormal powers or the
ability to demand boons from the
gods themselves. Even though many
contemporary Hindus are skeptical of
the more extreme practices and may
dismiss them, there is still great cultural
respect for ascetic self-control, and
combined with the right personality,
such practices can still confer considerable
religious authority.
In Hindu mythology Indra, king of
the gods, pays close attention to those
amassing such powers to protect him-
self from being replaced by someone
more powerful. When an ascetic starts to
amass enough power to displace him,
Indra’s heavenly throne becomes hot
through the “heat” generated by the
tapas. Indra must search for the aspirant
and defuse this power in one of two
ways—either by giving the aspirant a
boon, which in many cases is the reason
for performing the tapas in the first
place, or by sending a celestial nymph
(apsara) to seduce the ascetic, whose
power will be discharged along with his
semen. This mythology reflects the
basic Hindu belief that the starting point
for ascetic power is celibacy, which con-
serves a man’s vital energies by conserv-
ing his semen.
Taraka
In Hindu mythology, an extremely pow-
erful demon, who endures such severe
physical asceticism (tapas) that he
receives a boon that he can be killed
only by a son of the god Shiva. This
boon seems to make Taraka invulnera-
ble because at the time, Shiva is lost in
meditation and is still grieving for his
dead wife Sati. For a long time Taraka
grows more powerful and more arrogant
until he is eventually able to defeat the
gods in battle and exile them from heaven.
In their despair the gods turn to the god
of love, Kama, and beg him to shoot
Shiva with an arrow of desire so that he
[[689]]
Tarakeshvar
will marry the goddess Parvati, and thus
make it possible to bring about Taraka’s
death. Shiva, however, destroys Kama
before he can shoot, burning him to ash
with a stream of fire from his third eye.
Shiva later marries Parvati, and their
son, Skanda, kills Taraka in battle.
Tarakeshvar
City and sacred site (tirtha) thirty miles
northwest of Calcutta in the state of
West Bengal, which because of its prox-
imity to Calcutta, is the most widely vis-
ited pilgrimage place in the state.
Tarakeshvar is famous for the temple of
Baba Tarakanath, who is the god Shiva
in his form as the “Lord of Liberation.”
Shiva is present at Tarakeshvar in the
form of a linga, the pillar-shaped object
that is Shiva’s symbolic form. The
Tarakeshvar linga is claimed to be a
“self-manifested” (svayambhu) image,
which was not made by human hands
but established through an act of divine
self-revelation. The site’s charter myth
describes how the linga of Shiva is
buried in the earth but is discovered
when a cow habitually lets down her
milk on the spot above it as an act of
worship. The charter myth also
describes how a man afflicted with ago-
nizing hemorrhoids finds relief by
drinking the water that has been poured
on the linga as an offering and thus is
blessed by Shiva’s touch. With these two
stories, the charter conveys the image of
a deity who is present and responsive to
his devotees (bhakta) as well as the
sense of a place where human beings
can go to find relief from their afflic-
tions. One of the most unusual manifes-
tations of this is the practice of dharna,
in which pilgrims lie on the temple’s
outer porch, fasting (upavasa) for as
long as it takes the deity to communi-
cate with them, usually in a dream. For
further information see E. Alan Morinis,
Pilgrimage in the Hindu Tradition, 1984.
Tarapith
[[690]]

(“Tara’s seat”) Town and sacred site
(tirtha) in the state of West Bengal,
about 130 miles northwest of Calcutta.
Tarapith is famous as one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess that spreads throughout the
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks
the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess;
in the case of Tarapith, the body part
was Sati’s cornea (tara). Tarapith’s pre-
siding goddess, Tara, is a fierce form of
the Goddess, who has strong associa-
tions with tantra, a secret ritually based
religious practice. In modern times
much of the shrine’s fame comes from
an unusual ascetic named Vamakhepa
(1843–1911), whose apparent irrational-
ity and lack of respect for generally
accepted norms—he once urinated on
the temple’s image of Tara to show his
contempt for a deity made of iron—was
a perfect match for Tara herself. Tarapith
is said to bestow supernormal powers
(siddhis) on those who worship there;
this makes Tarapith not only a very pow-
erful place but also a potentially danger-
ous one. For further information see
E. Alan Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984. See also pitha.
Tarjini Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
tarjini hasta is the name for a particular
hand gesture (hasta) in which the hand
is closed except for the index finger,
which is pointing upward as if to
admonish or scold the viewer. The word
tarjini is derived from a verb that can
mean either “to threaten” or “to cen-
sure”—both of which can be understood
from this gesture.
Tarka
(“reasoning”) In Indian logic, tarka
denotes the mode of argument that
focuses on the identification and classi-
fication of fallacies. When it is used in
argumentation, tarka does not advance
one’s own point of view but is used to
discredit an opponent’s assertion, either
by reducing it to absurdity, by showing
that the argument does not fulfillTat Tvam Asi
necessary conditions, or by showing
that it suffers from a fallacy that
renders it untenable.
Tarpana
(“satisfying”) Tarpana is a memorial rite
performed for the satisfaction of one’s
ancestors, in which one offers them
libations of water to quench their thirst.
Tarpana satisfies the “sacrifice to the
ancestors,” which is one of the Five
Great Sacrifices. These five sacrifices are
mandatory daily religious observances
(nitya karma) for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder who has
been born into one of the three “twice-
born” groups in Indian society—brah-
min, kshatriya, or vaishya—and who
has received the adolescent religious
initiation known as the second birth.
Tarpana is also sometimes an occasional
religious act (naimittika karma), which
should be performed on occasions
when one is bathing (snana) at pilgrim-
age places (tirthas). The rite itself is
quite simple. The performer first bathes
to become ritually pure, scoops up
water in his joined hands, then tips his
fingers forward to let the water drain
out. Some sources also specify that the
water should be mixed with sesame
seeds, a substance associated with
offerings to the dead. Tarpana was
considered a companion rite to the
memorial ceremony known as shraddha,
although as an obligatory daily act,
tarpana was performed much more
frequently. In the shraddha ritual, one
symbolically feeds one’s ancestors to
satisfy their hunger, whereas in the
tarpana ritual, one gives them water to
quench their thirst.
Tat Tvam Asi
(“You are that”) In the Hindu philosophical
tradition, one of the “great utterances”
(mahavakyas) expressing the ultimate
truth. The truth referred to here is the
identity of atman (the individual Self)
and Brahman (Supreme Reality); this
identity is the heart of the speculative
Bather performs the tarpana memorial rite in the
sacred Ganges River, Varanasi.
texts called the Upanishads. This partic-
ular passage is found repeatedly in the
sixth book of the Chandogya
Upanishad, in which the boy
Shvetaketu is being instructed by his
father. The boy’s father uses a series
of analogies to convey his instruction
regarding the identical natures of the
atman and Brahman, ending every
such analogy with this concluding
phrase, which contains the wisdom
of the whole.
In addition to its textual importance,
this and three other mahavakyas—as
utterances that capsulize fundamental
truth—were appropriated as identifying
symbols by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics. Each
division had a different mahavakya, just
as each had a different Veda, a different
primary sacred center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Tat
tvam asi is the mahavakya associated
with the Kitawara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.
[[691]]
Teej
Teej
Teej is a name denoting two different
Hindu religious observances, both falling
in the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). Kajari Teej falls on
the third day of the dark (waxing) half of
the month and Hartalika Teej two weeks
later, on the third day of the bright
(waxing) half. Both of these observances
have a mythic charter connected with
the god Shiva and his wife Parvati, but
the latter is far more important. Kajari
Teej is a festival marking the coming of
the monsoons, a season that once
rendered travel impossible. For lovers
who were together, the monsoon
months were very sweet, but for those
who were apart, the coming of the rains
foretold a time of separation. One of the
standard poetic images is the woman
watching the darkening sky, wondering
whether her beloved will make it home
in time. On this day people sing songs
in the Kajari raga, a melodic mode asso-
ciated both with the rains and with
songs of separation and longing. On this
day people also welcome the rainy season
by setting up swings and swinging on
them. The festival is celebrated through
much of India, but especially in the
Benares and Mirzapur districts of the
eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.
Hartalika Teej (also known as
Hariyali Teej) is a religious observance
practiced by young unmarried women
in order to gain a good husband and
have a happy marriage. In Hindu culture
the model for the ideal husband is the
god Shiva, who despite his wild appear-
ance and his unusual habits, is com-
pletely devoted to his wife. One sign of
this devotion is that Shiva and his wife
Parvati are married only to each other,
no matter which forms they take—as,
for instance, when one or the other is
cursed to be born as a human being. As
the ideal divine couple, Shiva and
Parvati are the patron deities of this reli-
gious observance. Women observing
this festival should worship Shiva and
Parvati (as the model couple whose hap-
piness they hope to share), decorate
[[692]]

their houses, put on new clothes, and
pass the night singing songs of auspi-
ciousness. This festival reveals the cul-
tural importance of marriage for Indian
women. Because the identity for many
Indian women is still formed primarily
through their traditional roles as wives
and mothers, for many women their
marriage is the most important event in
their lives.
The charter myth for Hartalika Teej
not only underlines the importance of a
happy marriage but also points to the
woman’s role in gaining her husband.
After the death of the goddess Sati, she is
reborn as Parvati in the house of
Himalaya, the mountains personified.
Very early in life, Parvati vows that she
will have no husband except for Shiva.
Her parents try to discourage her from
this wish because Shiva has taken a
vow of asceticism and passes his time
deep in meditation on Mount Kailas.
Undeterred, Parvati goes up into the
mountains and begins to do harsh physi-
cal asceticism (tapas) of her own. The
power generated by her asceticism even-
tually awakens Shiva, and on Hartalika
Teej he comes to where she is staying,
disguised as an aged brahmin. He first
tries to discourage Parvati by making dis-
paraging remarks about Shiva’s lifestyle
and personality, but Parvati refuses to lis-
ten and remains unshaken in her resolve.
Eventually Shiva reveals his true form to
her, and on that day they are betrothed to
be married.
Teli
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organized
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group had a monopoly. In
traditional northern Indian society, the
Telis were a Hindu jati whose hereditary
occupation was making vegetable oil by
pressing oil seeds.Tengalai
Temple car from the city of Shrirangapatnam, in the state of Karnataka. It is used to transport an image of
the temple’s primary deity during festival processions.
Temple Cars
Name for the ceremonial carts in which
the movable image of a deity (utsava
murti) can be transported throughout
the town or, in the case of the temples of
southern India, around the processional
streets that often ring the temple in con-
centric layers. In some cases the carts
are made new every year, as at the tem-
ple of the god Jagannath in the city of
Puri; in other cases (as one finds in
many of the southern Indian temples)
the temple car is one of the deity’s
standard accouterments, and it is made
from precious metals and is richly deco-
rated. In either case the deity is being
treated in a manner parallel to that of a
king, and the car is a means to move the
deity in procession to view his or her
earthly domain.
Tengalai
One of the two main subsects in
the Shrivaishnava religious community,
the other being the Vadagalai. The
[[693]]
Thakur
Shrivaishnavas are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, and their roots lie in the
devotional hymns of the Alvars, a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in
southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. Two centuries
later, the Alvars’ devotional outpouring
was organized and systematized by
the philosopher Ramanuja (11th c.),
who is considered the Shrivaishnava
founder. Ramanuja was convinced that
Brahman, or Supreme Reality, was a
personal deity rather than an impersonal
abstract principle, and he was also
convinced that devotion (bhakti) was
the most important form of religious
practice. Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, his
philosophical position, stressed both of
these convictions and thus opposed the
Advaita Vedanta school, founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, which
believed that the Supreme Being was
impersonal and that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path.
The split between the Tengalais and
the Vadagalais came several centuries
after Ramanuja and stemmed from dif-
fering perspectives on what the individ-
ual must do to gain final liberation of the
soul (moksha). The Tengalais empha-
size the need for absolute surrender
(prapatti) to the grace of God, through
which devotees will be saved with no
action of their own; the Vadagalais stress
that devotees must also exert them-
selves on their own behalf. The Tengalai
founder was Pillai Lokacharya (14th c.),
who is also the community’s most
important figure.
Thakur
(“master”) The model for traditional
Indian society was as a collection of
endogamous subgroups (i.e., groups in
which marriages occurred only between
members of the same group) known as
jatis (“birth”). These jatis were orga-
nized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary
occupation, over which each group had
a monopoly. In northern India, the
Thakurs were a jati considered to be
[[694]]

kshatriyas, who have traditionally func-
tioned as landlords and village leaders.
Its most famous member was the Nobel
laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
Thandai
(“cooling”) A refreshing sweetened drink
made of milk or yogurt, ground nuts,
and spices often used as the medium
for the consumption of ground marijuana
(bhang). As with all milk products, the
thandai is considered to have cooling
properties; this effect may be intended
to balance the bhang, which is
considered to be “hot” because of its
intoxicating properties.
Thanesar
City and sacred site (tirtha) adjoining
the sacred site of Kurukshetra in the
northern part of the state of Haryana.
Thanesar is a famous site in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two
Sanskrit epics. The epic’s climax comes
at Kurukshetra in an eighteen-day battle
between two factions of an extended
family, along with their allies and sup-
porters. On one side, there are the five
Pandava brothers, who are the epic’s
protagonists, and on the other, their
cousins the Kauravas, who are the
antagonists. According to the epic, on
the eve of the battle, the Pandavas wor-
shiped the god Shiva in a temple at
Thanesar, and after their worship Shiva
assured them that they would be victori-
ous. Aside from the temple, Thanesar
also has a renowned bathing tank said to
contain all the sacred rivers of India, at
which the primary bathing (snana) day
is Sunday. Nearby is the Gita Mandir,
at which Arjuna, one of the Pandava
brothers, is said to have received
the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita
from Krishna in the moments before
the battle began.
Thanjavur
A variant name for the southern Indian
city of Tanjore. See Tanjore.3HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood
Thief CastesThree Debts
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups (i.e., groups in which marriages
occurred only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group had a monopoly. Although it
sounds bizarre, this specialization
extended to all occupations, and there
were hereditary occupational groups
whose profession was thievery and ban-
ditry. The most famous individual from
these was Tirumangai (9th c.), by far the
most picturesque of the Alvars, a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. In the nineteenth century the
British composed a list of several hun-
dred such groups, who were subject to
relentless scrutiny, opposition, and in
many cases resettlement.According to tradition, repayment of
three “debts” was incumbent on all
“twice-born” men, that is, men born
into one of the three “twice-born”
groups in Indian society—brahmin,
kshatriya, or vaishya—who had under-
gone the adolescent religious initiation
known as the second birth. The first of
these debts was to the gods and was
repaid by offering sacrifices. The second
debt was to the sages and was satisfied
by studying the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative religious texts. The
final debt was to the ancestors (pitrs)
and was satisfied by procreating a son,
to ensure that the ancestral rites would
be carried out without interruption.
Thiruvaiyaru
Temple town and sacred site (tirtha) in
the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu,
about 170 miles south and west of
Madras. Thiruvaiyaru’s major temple is
dedicated to the god Shiva, but the site
is most famous for being the home of
the late-eighteenth-century saint and
musician Tyagaraja.
Thoreau, Henry David
(1817–1862) American writer and
philosopher, who by his own account
was powerfully influenced by the Hindu
religious text known as the Bhagavad
Gita, particularly the text’s instruction to
perform one’s duties selflessly for the
good of society, without any thought of
personal reward. Thoreau refers to this
text in both Walden and A Week on the
Concord and Merrimack Rivers, and in
letters to his friends, Thoreau talks
about his desire to practice yoga.
[[3]]
HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood
Modern religious organization founded
by Yogi Bhajan; the movement’s two
names reflect differing emphases in the
phases in Yogi Bhajan’s teaching. His ini-
tial teachings were the traditional disci-
plines of hatha yoga and kundalini
yoga, with his followers organized into a
group known as the Happy, Healthy,
Holy Organization (3HO). Hatha yoga is a
system of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas; this practice is widely
believed to provide various physical
benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Kundalini yoga is the religious
discipline whose primary focus is awak-
ening the kundalini, the latent spiritual
force that exists in every person in the
subtle body. The kundalini is awakened
through a combination of yoga practice
and ritual action and is believed to bring
further spiritual capacities and final lib-
eration (moksha) of the soul.
These two disciplines remain an
important part of Yogi Bhajan’s teach-
ings, for he claims to be a master of
tantra, a secret, ritually based religious
practice. In the 1970s his teaching
widened to include traditional Sikh
teachings and symbols. The most
prominent of these symbols are the “five
[[695]]
Thug
K’s” that all Sikhs are supposed to wear,
so called because each of them begins
with the letter k: uncut hair (kesh), a
comb (kangha), a bangle on the right
wrist (kara), shorts (kacch), and a cere-
monial sword (kirpan). Many of Yogi
Bhajan’s followers keep the Sikh symbols
far more strictly than most people born
as Sikhs, but the movement has two
important divergences with the tradi-
tional Sikh community. One of these is
its emphasis on tantra, which has little
importance in the Sikh community. The
most significant difference, however, is
the religious authority that Yogi Bhajan
holds over his followers, which is very
different from the decentralized, essen-
tially democratic form of the traditional
Sikh community.
Thug
In the colonialist mythology describing
the savagery of the East and the demonic
qualities of Hinduism, one of the most
compelling stories is that of the Thugs, a
group of robbers who were devotees
(bhakta) of the goddess Kali. According
to popular belief, the Thugs were wide-
spread throughout India and frequented
the highways, seeking travelers as their
prey. They would travel with their vic-
tims, sometimes for days on end, and
then kill them—sometimes after giving
them sweets laced with drugs, and
sometimes simply by taking them by
surprise. The victims would be strangled
with a silken scarf, and whenever possi-
ble, no blood would be shed, for the vic-
tims’ blood was considered an offering
to the goddess Kali and thus should not
be spilled and wasted. The victims’
worldly possessions were claimed by the
Thugs themselves, in a division of the
spoils between deity and devotee. This
demonic practice persisted until the
[[1830]]
s, when it was finally uprooted and
destroyed by the British.
Although the tale of the Thugs makes
a gripping story, much of it has been dis-
pelled by more careful recent scholar-
ship. One of the major factors in the rise
of the Thugs was the radical economic
[[696]]

dislocation caused by the arrival of the
British themselves. Many of the people
marginalized by these forces took to
wandering and, in their desperation,
resorted to banditry. These small-scale
and essentially local depredations were
transformed into a widespread religious
conspiracy. The myth of the Thugs cer-
tainly showed concern about the pre-
vailing law-and-order situation in
central India, but it may also have
reflected British colonial fears about
their ability to control their territory.
Even though there are references to the
Thugs in texts predating British contact,
on the whole, this was one of the more
enduring colonial stereotypes. For fur-
ther information see C. A. Bayly, Indian
Society and the Making of the British
Empire, 1988; and The Raj, 1990.
Thursday
(Brhaspativar) The fifth day of the week,
whose presiding planet is Jupiter
(Brhaspati). Since in Hindu mythology
the sage Brhaspati is the religious pre-
ceptor (guru) of the gods, another com-
mon name for Thursday is Guruvar. In
Hindu astrology (jyotisha) Jupiter is an
extremely powerful planet, and because
in religious life one’s spiritual preceptor
is often likened to a god, this makes
Thursday a ritually important and pow-
erful day. One of the “deities” to be hon-
ored and served on this day is one’s
religious preceptor.
Another deity worshiped on this day
is the goddess Lakshmi, who is wor-
shiped mainly by women. Lakshmi is
the wife of the god Vishnu and the
embodiment of wealth, prosperity, and
good fortune, which she brings with her
wherever she goes and removes when
she leaves. As the human counterpart to
Lakshmi, married women worship her
to obtain these things or to retain them
if they already have them. Because it is
well known that good fortune is not per-
manent and can often change, Lakshmi
is also seen as a capricious and some-
what fickle divine presence. One of the
taboos for women, at least in parts ofTilak, Bal Gangadhar
northern India, is changing their jewelry
on that day because this is said to annoy
Lakshmi and raise the danger that she
might depart because of her vexation.
Tiger
In Hindu mythology, a tiger or lion is the
animal vehicle of the powerful forms of
the Goddess, such as Durga. Modern
iconography shows both lions and tigers
with no apparent difference between
them, perhaps reflecting the fact that
the Hindi word sher can refer to either
animal. In either case, the fact that the
Goddess rides such a dangerous animal
is clearly a symbol of her power and
capacity, because in her mythology
these animals are often described as her
allies, doing battle on her part in
response to her command.
Tika
In modern Hindi, a word denoting
either a commentary on a text or a col-
ored mark (often red vermilion) on one’s
forehead. These forehead marks are
applied for various reasons: for sheer
ornamentation, to indicate sectarian
affiliation, or as an outward symbol of
having worshiped in a temple that day
(since a common element in this wor-
ship is to receive some of the vermilion
daubed on the feet of the deity’s image,
as a sign of grace and one’s subordinate
status). The former of these two mean-
ings is the original sense of the word, but
the latter meaning is far more common
in contemporary times. The connection
between these two meanings could be
the notion that just as a primary text is
ornamented and highlighted by a com-
mentary, in the same way a forehead
mark could ornament the body.
Tilak
A mark on the forehead, also colloquially
known as a tika, made from colored
powders mixed with oil, sandalwood
paste, or cosmetics. These forehead
marks are applied for various reasons:
for sheer ornamentation, to indicate
This ascetic’s tika markings indicate that he

sectarian affiliation, or as an outward
symbol of having worshiped in a temple
that day. See tika.
Tilak, Bal Gangadhar
(1856–1920) Maharashtrian political
activist who was once characterized as
“the father of Indian unrest.” Unlike his
Maharashtrian contemporaries Ranade
and Gokhale, who stressed working
within existing institutions, Tilak never
compromised his conviction that the
British had no right to rule India. He
resigned from Gokhale’s reformist group
in 1890 and devoted himself to educat-
ing and organizing ordinary people in
Maharashtra. One vehicle for such
organizing comprised two newspapers,
one written in English and one in
Marathi. The other involved organizing
and promoting two new festivals. One
of these festivals was devoted to
the Maratha king Shivaji, a regional
hero who had spent his life fighting
[[697]]
Time
domination by the Moghul empire. The
other festival was Ganesh Chaturthi,
which Tilak promoted as a visible way to
assert and celebrate a Hindu nationalist
identity during the time of British impe-
rial rule. Given British power, outright
rebellion was simply impossible, and
the British government heavily restricted
all forms of political dissent. The Ganesh
festival provided a way to circumvent
these restrictions because the British
had a long-standing policy of not inter-
fering with religious observances. Tilak
was imprisoned several times on the
charge of inciting political assassina-
tions, but he always returned directly to
the political fray. Aside from his political
agitation, his greatest intellectual work
is a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,
a religious text, in which he stresses the
need for this-worldly activism to defeat
evil, including violence if necessary. See
also Moghul dynasty.

tional Hindu culture, see cosmic time,

Tirruppavai
One of the two collections of poetry
composed by the poet-saint Andal
(9th c.), the other being the Nacciyar
Tirumoli. Andal was the only woman
among the Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. Andal’s chosen deity was
Ranganatha, the particular form of
Vishnu presiding at the temple of
Shrirangam, yet both collections of her
poetry are dedicated to Krishna, a dif-
ferent form of Vishnu.
This seeming divergence may reflect
her conviction that all manifestations of
[[698]]

Vishnu were the same or else may indi-
cate a difference between personal
devotion and literary expression.
Ranganatha was a specific form of
Vishnu presiding over a specific place—
which at the time was true for
most southern Indian temples—whereas
Krishna was a form of Vishnu for whom
there was already a large body
of literature, but who was not geograph-
ically limited. The contents of the
Tirruppavai are poems of separation in
which Andal mourns the absence of
Krishna, using the language and images
of the forlorn lover, feverishly hoping for
Krishna’s return.
Tirtha
(“crossing place”) The most general
name for any holy place. Just as a ford on
a riverbank provides a safe place to cross
from one side to the other, in the same
way a tirtha provides a way for one to
“cross over” from mundane life to a
sanctified one or, on an even greater
scale, to “cross over” from this ephemeral
and ever changing world to the
unchanging, blissful, final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Many tirthas are
actual places—and many of them are on
the shores of India’s sacred rivers, partic-
ularly the Ganges—and in its most col-
loquial meaning, the word tirtha
connotes a pilgrimage place. Yet the tra-
ditional pilgrimage literature is emphatic
that tirthas are not just restricted to
mere physical places: The word can also
refer to holy people (such as ascetics,
saints, gurus, and sages) as well as to
virtues such as charity, wisdom, com-
passion, and purity of heart.
A tirtha is first and foremost a place
or thing that gives one access to sanctity
and religious power, and in the case of
the physical places (rivers, mountains,
cities, temples, or images), this power is
accessible to all. Such holy places are
seen not only as giving easier access to
the divine but also as being areas where
religious merit is more readily and
bountifully obtained. When one surveys
the literature connected with certainTirthayatra
areas, one of the most common themes
is the claim that the merit from religious
acts performed at place X (the physical
tirtha) equals that of a thousand (or a
million, or a billion) such religious acts
done in ordinary places. The rarefied
atmosphere at tirthas has a similar effect
on evil acts, multiplying their conse-
quences manifold. In this way the action
of a tirtha can be compared to that of a
microphone; just as a microphone mag-
nifies any sound, whether harsh or
pleasant, in the same way a tirtha mag-
nifies, for good or ill, the conse-
quences of any action. The pilgrimage
literature thus commonly reminds peo-
ple of the religious merit that their acts
can bring, and it warns them that care-
less or evil actions can have equally
severe consequences. For this reason,
people performing religious pilgrimage
(tirthayatra) were encouraged to live an
austere, self-conscious life, both to save
themselves from any lapses and to make
the journey a self-conscious process of
transformation. For further information
see Diana Eck, Banaras, 1999; E. Alan
Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984; A. W. Entwistle, Braj,

Journeys, 1988; and Peter van der Veer,
Gods on Earth, 1988.
Tirtha Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva. The Dashanamis were
supposedly established by the ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya,
in an effort to create a corps of learned
men who could help revitalize Hindu
life. Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case, tirtha
(“sacred site”). On initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in
one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Tirtha
Dashanamis belong to the Kitawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Sharada math in the city of Dwaraka,
on the shore of the Arabian Sea. The
Tirtha division is unique in that it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins. (The other such divisions are
Saraswati, Ashrama, and part of the
Bharati order.)
Tirtha Shraddha
Name for a particular type of shraddha
(ancestral memorial rite) performed
when visiting a pilgrimage place
(tirtha). A shraddha has two major fea-
tures: symbolically feeding one’s ances-
tor(s) by offering balls of cooked grain
(pindas), and feeding real food to a
group of brahmins representing one’s
ancestors. Tirtha shraddhas belong to a
class of action known as occasional
actions (naimittika karma) because
they are incumbent only under certain
conditions. Under ordinary circum-
stances one would not have to perform
this action, but it becomes required
when one visits a pilgrimage place. The
traditional pilgrimage literature, much
of it clearly written by the brahmins who
received such meals and other gifts, is
emphatic that this obligation should not
be neglected.
Tirthayatra
(“Journey to a tirtha”) The general term
denoting religious pilgrimage, which is
seen as an act generating considerable
religious merit (punya). The major focus
of such travel was a visit to a “crossing
place” (tirtha), a sacred site or person
through which one could more easily
communicate with the worlds beyond.
One of the major themes in the tradi-
tional pilgrimage literature was the
inherent holiness of whatever place was
being described at that time, which
was invariably described as bringing
[[699]]
Tiruchendur

incalculable benefits, even for actions
performed unknowingly or in jest. A sec-
ond and seemingly contradictory theme
was the stress on the inner state of the
pilgrims themselves and the warning
that they would gain no benefits unless
they were serious about their visit. In its
ideal, pilgrimage to the holy places was
not a pleasure tour but a vehicle for spir-
itual development, through bathing
(snana) in holy rivers, visiting and wor-
shiping powerful deities, enduring
hardships, making offerings to the
ancestors, gift-giving, and living a sober,
disciplined life.
In fact, the traditional literature
affirms both sides of this tension—the
need for individual commitment and
the inherent sanctity of the places them-
selves—although the emphasis may
shift depending on the needs of the
moment. One explanation, combining
both of these themes, is that these holy
places amplified the effects of all of one’s
actions there, whether good or bad.
Pilgrims were thus encouraged to
[[700]]

benefit from performing meritorious
actions but warned of the heightened
consequences from evil deeds, which
were much more severe than normal.
In earlier times pilgrimage required a
large investment of time and money.
People would often spend months or
years on pilgrimage, usually visiting a
series of pilgrimage places. This was
seen as a religiously meritorious use of
one’s money, a notion still current in
contemporary times. For most people,
such an opportunity would come only
once in their lifetime, generally in their
later years, and this long-awaited fulfill-
ment must have heightened their expe-
rience. The advent of railroad travel in
the late 1800s largely reshaped this pat-
tern, although it persisted in the
Himalayas until well into the twentieth
century. With the advent of railroad travel,
people were able to visit places with
relative ease and speed. This conve-
nience encouraged multiple visits, but
also ones in which the person stopped
at fewer places on the way.
The most recent change in pilgrim-
age patterns has come with the develop-
ment of tourism, which is being
marketed by state governments as a way
to generate income for the local people.
It cannot be denied that “seeing the
sights” has always been a part of pil-
grimage, which provided a religiously
sanctioned motive for travel. Yet the
ideal, then as now, was that this journey
should not be undertaken merely for
enjoyment, but for serious purposes.
Some contemporary Hindus worry that
the growth of tourism has commercial-
ized the sanctity of their holy places;
other more sanguine souls consider the
stress on tourism simply a stronger
manifestation of trends that have always
existed, which will have no effect on the
truly pious.
Tiruchendur
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu, sixty miles
up the coast from Kanyakumari.
Tiruchendur is part of the network of sixTirumalai Nayak
temples in Tamil Nadu built to honor
Murugan, a hill deity who has been
assimilated into the larger pantheon as a
form of the god Skanda, the son of
Shiva. Five of these temples have been
definitively identified, and each is asso-
ciated with a particular region, a specific
ecosystem, and a particular incident in
Murugan’s mythic career. In the case of
Tiruchendur, it is said to be where he
killed a demon enemy and thus presents
him in his warrior aspect. The sixth of
these temples is said to be every other
shrine to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The
cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic vehi-
cle for Tamil pride and identity, and
because the number six has connota-
tions of completeness—as in the six
directions or the six chakras in the sub-
tle body—it also connotes that nothing
outside is needed. For further informa-
tion see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of
Murukan,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
Tiruchirappalli
City on the Cauvery River in the central
part of the state of Tamil Nadu, and the
capital of the district with the same
name. The city’s strategic position
meant that it was contested by various
southern Indian dynasties, of which the
most recent were the Nayaks of
Madurai, who built an imposing fort
on a stone outcrop in the center of the
city. It is most famous, however, for
the great temples of Shrirangam and
Jambukeshvar, both of which are on an
island in the Cauvery, north of the city.
The former is a temple to the god
Vishnu, which has important symbolic
associations with southern Indian kings
and kingship; the latter is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his aspect as “Lord of
the Rose-Apple (jambu) Tree.”
Tirukkural
One of the most important pieces of
early Tamil literature, along with the
slightly later Naladiyar. The Tirukkural
Depiction of Tirumalai Nayak.
is a collection of brief verses on reli-
gious, social, and moral life, organized
according to various themes; it is attrib-
uted to the poet Tiruvalluvar and is
believed to have been written late in the
fifth century. The Tirukkural’s underly-
ing assumptions are theistic, and in this
it differs from the Naladiyar, the tone of
which is primarily ethical, with no men-
tion of divinity. Many of these epigrams
have become proverbial expressions in
Tamil and have become the cultural
property of Tamils from all religious
communities. See also Tamil language
and Tamil epics.
Tirumalai Nayak
(r. 1623–1659) Greatest ruler in the
southern Indian Nayak dynasty, who
took advantage of the collapse of the
Vijayanagar dynasty to rule much of
modern Tamil Nadu from the capital
city of Madurai. The peace and prosper-
ity during Tirumalai’s reign was
expressed with two large pieces of mon-
umental architecture—his royal palace,
[[701]]
Tirumalisai
and the enormous Minakshi temple,
named after the goddess considered to
be Madurai’s patron deity. Interestingly,
the temple was the real ritual center of
the city, as is clearly shown by its place-
ment and the processional streets sur-
rounding it.their truth or falsity, these stories reveal
a great deal about the passionate
devotional commitment of his time.

Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975; and

the Alvars, 1929.
TirumalisaiTirunavukkarashu
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tirumalisai was the son of a sage and a
celestial nymph (apsara), who was
abandoned by his parents at birth. He
was found and raised by a man of very
humble status who called his foster son
by the name of their village. For further
information see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil
Literature, 1975.(7th c.) This was the given name of the
Nayanar poet-saint most commonly
referred to as Appar (“father”). Appar
was one of the earliest of the Nayanars, a
group of sixty-three southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and who lived in south-
ern India in the seventh and eighth cen-
turies. Along with their contemporaries
the Alvars, who were devotees of
Vishnu, the Nayanars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion through
their passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language.
Tirumangai
(9th c.) By far the most picturesque of
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. According to
tradition, Tirumangai was born into a
caste of thieves, and theft, robbery, and
deceit play an important role in the sto-
ries associated with him. One story
reports that after taking a vow to feed
[[1]]
,008 Vaishnavas for a year, he resorted
to highway robbery to raise the neces-
sary funds; on another occasion he took
to robbery to raise funds to enlarge the
temple at Shrirangam. In these and
other works, he had the continual help
of Vishnu, his chosen deity; regardless of
[[702]]

Tirupati
Town in the far southern part of the state
of Andhra Pradesh, about 160 miles
northwest of Madras. It is most famous
for the Holy Hill (Tirumalai) eight miles
to the north, which is the location of the
temple to Venkateshvara and for which
Tirupati is the major gateway.
Tirupati/Tirumalai Devasthanam
Official name for the managing commit-
tee of the Venkateshvara temple, near
the town of Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh. This temple is the
richest one in India, based largely on the
popular belief that any wish made in the
deity’s presence will invariably come
true. In earlier times all of the temple
receipts were taken by the priests run-
ning the temple, but since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947, the temple
committee has been responsible for
them. The committee has channeled
these funds into hundreds of charities,
but particularly into education and tem-
ple building: the former in schools fromTiruttontar Puranam
the primary to the university level, and
the latter in providing the funds to help
build many of the larger Hindu temples
in the United States and Europe.
Tiruppan
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tiruppan was a foundling who was
adopted by a musician. As he grew up,
he developed deep devotion for Vishnu
in his form as Ranganatha at the temple
of Shrirangam, but because his family
status was unknown, he never went into
the temple itself out of fear that his pres-
ence might render it impure. Tiruppan
finally gained entrance when one of the
temple’s brahmin priests, who had ear-
lier insulted him, received a divine com-
mand to carry Tiruppan on his
shoulders to Ranganatha’s image. As
with many stories in the lives of the
bhakti saints, the lesson here clearly
emphasizes the superiority of devotion
over birth. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;
and John Stirling Morley Hooper, Hymns
of the Alvars, 1929.
Tirupparankunram
Tirtha (sacred site) ten miles southwest
of Madurai in central Tamil Nadu.
Tirupparankunram is famous for one of
the six temples in Tamil Nadu built to
honor Murugan, a hill deity assimilated
into the pantheon as a form of Skanda.
It is said to be where he marries
Devasena, the bride given by Indra and
the gods after he has proven his mettle
in battle, and thus reflects his accep-
tance into the larger pantheon. Five of
these temples are definitively identified
and scattered throughout the state, but
the sixth is said to be every other shrine
to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The cult of
Murugan is thus a symbolic vehicle for
Tamil pride and identity, and because
the number six has connotations of
completeness—as in the six directions,
or the six chakras in the subtle body—it
also connotes that nothing outside is
needed. For further information see
Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage Centers in the
Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in Journal of
the American Academy of Religion, Vol.
[[40]]
, No. 1, 1972.
Tiruttani
Tirtha (sacred site) in the hills of Tamil
Nadu, seventy-five miles of Madras. It is
famous for one of the six temples in
Tamil Nadu built to honor Murugan, a
hill deity assimilated into the pantheon
as a form of Skanda. Tiruttani is cele-
brated as the place where he marries his
tribal bride Valli, which gives him a fam-
ily connection with southern India. Five
of these temples are definitively identi-
fied and scattered throughout the state,
but the sixth is said to be every other
shrine to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The
cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic vehi-
cle for Tamil pride and identity, and
because the number six has connota-
tions of completeness—as in the six
directions or the six chakras in the sub-
tle body—it also connotes that nothing
outside is needed. For further informa-
tion see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of
Murukan,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
Tiruttontar Puranam
(“history of the holy servants [of Shiva]”)
Another name for the Periya Purana, a
hagiographical account (an idealizing
biography of saints or venerated figures)
of the lives of the sixty-three Nayanars,
written by the twelfth-century figure
Cekkilar. The Nayanars were a group of
Shaiva poet-saints who lived in southern
India in the seventh and eighth cen-
turies. See Periya Purana.
[[703]]
Tiruvachakam
Tiruvachakam
(“holy utterances”) Collection of poetry
composed in the ninth century by the
Tamil poet-saint Manikkavachakar,
who was a passionate devotee (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. Manikkavachakar’s
work comes in the tradition of the
Nayanars (a group of sixty-three Shaiva
poet-saints who lived in southern India
in the seventh and eighth centuries),
although he is not counted as one of
them because he was about a century
later than the last Nayanar, Sundara-
murtti. The hymns in the Tiruvachakam
bear witness to Manikkavachakar’s
intense devotion to Shiva, and in their
devotional fervor, they can be seen as
the culmination of the earlier devotional
(bhakti) tradition. Manikkavachakar’s
hymns are also the basis for the devel-
opment of the philosophical tradition
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, which
makes Manikkavachakar a pivotal figure
in southern Indian Shaivism. For further
information see Glenn Yocum, Hymns to
the Dancing Siva, 1982. See also Tamil
language and Tamil epics.
Tiruvalluvar
(5th–6th c.) According to tradition, the
author of the Tirukkural, one of the
most important pieces of early Tamil lit-
erature. The Tirukkural is a collection of
brief verses on religious, social, and
moral life, organized according to vari-
ous themes. Many of these epigrams
have become proverbial expressions in
Tamil and have become the cultural
property of Tamils from all religious
communities. See also Tamil language
and Tamil epics.
Tiruvannamalai
Temple town and sacred site (tirtha) in
the northern part of the state of Tamil
Nadu, about 100 miles southwest of
Madras, the capital. Tiruvannamalai is
most famous as a temple to the god
Shiva in his form as Arunachaleshvar,
“the Lord of Arunachal [Hill],” the
hill on which the temple is built.
[[704]]

Tiruvannamalai is also one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a net-
work of five southern Indian sites sacred
to Shiva. In each of these sites, Shiva is
worshiped as a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form, and at
each site the linga is believed to be formed
from one of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). Tiruvannamalai’s linga is
associated with the primordial element
of fire, making this an extremely
powerful image. Aside from the image
and the temple, Tiruvannamalai is also
famous as the place in which the mod-
ern Indian saint Ramana Maharshi
spent most of his life, from 1896 until his
death in 1950.
Tiruvaymoli
(“Holy words”) Collection of 1,102
stanzas written in the tenth century
by the poet-saint Nammalvar.
Nammalvar was one of the Alvars, a
group of twelve poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. All of the Alvars
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized
Hindu
religious
life.
Nammalvar’s Tiruvaymoli is an out-
pouring of ecstatic Vaishnava devo-

Tiruvayur
Southern Indian temple town about
thirty-five miles east of the city of
Tanjore in the state of Tamil Nadu. The
town is most famous for an enormousTortoise Avatar
temple to the god Shiva, and as with
many southern Indian temples, the tem-
ple is located in the heart of the city and
forms a substantial part of the city itself.
Tithi
A lunar day, that is to say, one of the thirty
days occurring during a single lunar
month, from full moon to full moon.
Because these thirty lunar days take
place in about twenty-eight solar days,
each lunar day is thus slightly shorter
than a solar day. Even in contemporary
times, most Hindu religious obser-
vances are determined by the lunar cal-
endar, which makes the determination
of these lunar days an important matter.
Most people keep track of these holidays
with a panchang, an almanac that gives
all the lunar days.
Toddy Palm
Palm tree that is both the source of the
slightly fermented beverage tapped
from its sap known as toddy, and the
long, flat leaves that were traditionally
used for writing down all sorts of texts,
including religious ones. The former use
led this tree to be considered unclean,
since alcoholic beverages are proscribed
in “respectable” Hindu society; the man-
uscripts written on the leaves, however,
could be the holiest of texts. The poet-
saint Ravidas uses this palm to illustrate
how the power of the divine name can
transform something normally believed
to be base and vile. In doing so he is also
referring to himself, who as a tanner and
leather worker was believed to be
defiled because his work involves han-
dling the skins of dead animals.
Tondaradippodi
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tondaradippodi was born as a brahmin
named Vipra Narayana, and his family’s
hereditary labor was to arrange the flow-
ers for the worship of Ranganatha, a
form of Vishnu who is the presiding
deity at the temple of Shrirangam. He
became enamored of a courtesan who
cast her spell on him, and for a time paid
attention to nothing else. In the end he
was saved by Ranganatha, to whom
Vipra Narayana devoted himself for the
rest of his life, taking as a symbol of this
his new name (“Dust of the Feet of the
Slaves [of God]”). For further informa-
tion see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature,

Hymns of the Alvars, 1929.
Tortoise Avatar
Second avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,
the Tortoise avatar came into being in a
time of crisis and served to restore the
cosmic balance that had been thrown
out of equilibrium. In this case the
source of trouble was the sage
Durvasas, who had cursed the gods to
become mortal and their heavenly lus-
ter to fade. To counter this, the gods
made a pact with the demons that they
would jointly churn the Ocean of Milk to
obtain the nectar of immortality, which
would be equally divided.
The image of churning here is based
on traditional dairy practices, in which
the person churning uses a string to
rotate a churning paddle. In this
instance, however, the churning takes
place on a cosmic scale: The churning
stick is Mount Mandara, the mountain
that is at the center of the earth; the
churning string is the divine serpent
Vasuki, who encircles the world; and
Vishnu himself, in the form of a tortoise,
dives to the bottom of the ocean to pro-
vide a stable base for the churning stick.
The gods and demons pull Vasuki back
and forth, spinning the mountain and
churning the Ocean of Milk. The churn-
ing separates the Ocean of Milk into

Tota Puri
The god Vishnu’s Tortoise avatar. He takes this
form to help the gods regain their immortality.
various components, both good and
bad. One product is the deadly halahala
poison, which is neutralized by having
Shiva hold it in his throat. Some of the
other products are the Kaustubha jewel,
the wishing cow Surabhi, the goddess
Lakshmi, and finally the physician of
the gods, Dhanvantari, who emerges
from the sea bearing the pot containing
the nectar of immortality.
The demons grab the pot of nectar
and begin to escape, but Vishnu takes
the form of the enchantress Mohini and
beguiles the demons into giving the pot
back to her. She gives the pot to the
gods, who take off with the demons in
hot pursuit. According to more recent
traditions, in their flight the gods stop at
four different holy places on earth—
Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and
Nasik—over a twelve-(divine) day span;
this latter incident is cited as the charter
myth for the celebration of the Kumbha
Mela at these sites on a twelve-year
basis (because a divine day is believed to
equal a human year).
The gods finally manage to escape
their pursuers and divide the nectar
among themselves, but they fail to
notice that the demon Sainhikeya slips
[[706]]

into their midst in disguise. As the
demon begins to drink, the sun and
moon alert Vishnu, who uses his discus
to cut off the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s
two halves become immortal because
they have come into contact with the
nectar, and both halves are considered
malevolent celestial beings: the head as
Rahu, the body as Ketu. Rahu has par-
ticular enmity for the sun and moon,
since these deities are responsible for
his demise, and tries to swallow them
whenever he meets them in the heav-
ens. He always succeeds, but because he
no longer has a body to digest them,
they escape unharmed through Rahu’s
severed neck. This, of course, is the tra-
ditional explanation for solar and lunar
eclipses; the association with the malev-
olent Rahu has thus led eclipses to be
seen as highly inauspicious times. See
also ocean, churning of the.
Tota Puri
An ascetic initiated into the Puri order
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, as can be
seen from his surname. Tota Puri was
one of the teachers of the Bengali saint
Ramakrishna, who appeared to instruct
Ramakrishna in Advaita Vedanta as part
of the latter’s continuing exposure to
many different types of religious prac-
tice. In his earlier religious practice,
Ramakrishna had been a fervent devo-
tee (bhakta) of the goddess Kali, where-
as the Advaita Vedanta philosophy
claims that behind all things lies a single
impersonal reality that has no defining
attributes except for being, conscious-
ness, and bliss (sacchidananda). In the
Advaita understanding, because all con-
ceptions of particular deities have spe-
cific attributes, they are thus conditioned
forms of the ultimate Brahman
(Supreme Reality).
Although this conception ran
counter to his own previous experience,
Ramakrishna
practiced
diligently
under Tota Puri’s direction. When
Ramakrishna attained enlightenment
through the practices of Advaita, he
discovered that the essence of thisTribhanga
experience was the same as that gained
from his earlier devotional practices.
This inner experience of identity was
a pivotal experience for Ramakrishna
and reinforced his conviction that all
forms of religious practice led the seeker
to the same place. After Ramakrishna’s
experience of enlightenment, Tota
Puri disappeared.immature person. Traditional wisdom is
unanimous that a person should not
consciously seek such powers, because
the very act of seeking is seen as being
rooted in selfish desires. In contrast,
when one has gained such powers as a
byproduct of spiritual attainment, one is
believed to be able to keep them in
proper perspective.
Transcendental MeditationTreta Yuga
Religious organization founded by
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose teach-
ings on meditation comprise its major
thrust. As its name would indicate,
Transcendental Meditation (TM) stresses
the multiple benefits of meditation: For
the individual, it promotes physical,
mental, and spiritual health, whereas for
the larger environment, it is claimed to
have pacific effects, resulting in reduced
crime and hatred. All of these results can
be obtained only by diligent practice,
but the initiation itself is easy to
obtain—all one has to do is to attend a
seminar sponsored by a TM instructor
and pay the required fee to obtain one’s
mantra, or sacred utterance. In more
recent years, TM has offered programs
leading to the acquisition of super-
human powers (siddhis) at its head-
quarters at Maharishi International
University in Fairfield, Iowa. The claims
of these programs have been toned
down since a disgruntled buyer—who
had been unable to learn to levitate—
won a lawsuit for damages.
Although meditation and the use of
mantras are well-established Hindu
practices, many traditional Hindus are
uncomfortable with other elements of
TM’s marketing. One controversial point
is the practice of buying (or selling) a
mantra, which was traditionally trans-
mitted from teacher (guru) to disciple
only after significant association. A
similar problem comes from the notion
that one can buy and sell superhuman
powers. These powers are seen as highly
seductive because they can be used for
both good and evil and as having
the potential to destroy a spirituallyA particular age of the world in cosmic
time. According to traditional belief,
time has neither a beginning nor an end,
but alternates between cycles of cre-
ation and activity, followed by cessation
and quietude. Each of these cycles lasts
for 4.32 billion years, with the active
phase known as the Day of Brahma, and
the quiet phase as the Night of Brahma.
In cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is
divided into one thousand mahayugas
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each
mahayuga is composed of four con-
stituent yugas (cosmic ages), named the
Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga,
and Kali Yuga. Each of these four yugas
is shorter than its predecessor and ush-
ers in an era more degenerate and
depraved. By the end of the Kali Yuga,
things have gotten so bad that the only
solution is the destruction and recre-
ation of the earth, at which time the
next Krta era begins.
The Treta Yuga is the second of the
four yugas, lasting for 1,296,000 years.
Although the Treta Age is still relatively
auspicious, it is less so than the Krta
Age, symbolized by its identification
with the metal silver—not as valuable as
the gold associated with the preceding
Krta Yuga, but more valuable than the
bronze and iron associated with the two
following yugas. In popular belief the
Treta Yuga is believed to be the time
when the god Rama reigned on earth.
Tribhanga
(“three breaks”) Name denoting one of
the best-known poses in Indian dance
[[707]]
Tridosha
and sculpture, in which the line of the
body has three distinct breaks, or
changes in direction. In this pose, the
body’s weight is mainly supported on
one foot, with the corresponding
knee and shoulder inclined toward
one side and the hips inclined in the
opposite direction.
Tridosha
In ayurveda, the term for the set of three
bodily humours, vata (“air”), pitta
(“bile”), and kapha (“phlegm”). Each of
these humours is associated with cer-
tain physiological tendencies, particu-
larly with regard to digestion and
metabolism. Every person has all three
of these humours, although one of them
is generally dominant. In a healthy per-
son the three humours are in general
equilibrium, but an imbalance can lead
to illness or chronic health problems.
The solution to these lies in regaining
the proper balance between the doshas,
or humours, for which one of the major
solutions is eating a proper diet.
Trika
Kashmiri religious community whose
members were devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; the greatest figure in the
Trika school was the tenth-century
philosopher and aesthetic theorist
Abhinavagupta. Trika Shaivism is a
tantric tradition—that is, a secret, ritually
based religious practice—whose philo-
sophical underpinnings merge two
philosophical positions, theism and
monism. Theism is the notion that a
divinity is the Supreme Reality in the
universe, whereas monism conceives a
more abstract principle as the basis of
all reality. For Trika Shaivism, the sole
true reality is the god Shiva, who is both
Supreme God and the source for emana-
tions from which the material universe
is formed. Final liberation of the soul
(moksha) comes through a process of
“recognition” (pratyabhijna), in which
one realizes that the entire universe is
nothing but a manifestation of Shiva
[[708]]

alone. Here one “recognizes” something
that has always been true but until that
time had been obscured by a mistaken
understanding. For further information
see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The
Triadic Heart of Siva, 1989. See also
tantra and Shaiva.
Trilochan
(15th c.?) A sant poet who is generally
associated with the poet-saint Namdev.
The name sant is an umbrella term for a
loose group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who shared several
general tendencies: a stress on individu-
alized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; a
disdain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; a faith in the power of
the divine name; and a tendency to
ignore conventional caste distinctions.
Trilochan’s only existing poems are a few
verses in the Adigranth, the sacred
scripture of the Sikh community. These
verses describe his devotion to Vithoba,
the presiding deity of the temple at
Pandharpur in Maharashtra, who was
also Namdev’s chosen deity. Thus, the
poems seem consistent with Maha-
rashtrian origins. Trilochan is also men-
tioned as a devotee (bhakta) by other
bhakti poets, most notably by the poet-
saint Ravidas.
Trimbak
Sacred site (tirtha) at the headwaters of
the Godavari River, in the Nasik district
of the state of Maharashtra. Trimbak is
famous as the site for Tryambakeshvar,
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, the most
sacred spot for devotees (bhakta) of the
god Shiva.
Trimurti
(“three forms”) The three deities of
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, often repre-
sented as three faces on a single image, to
symbolize the ultimate identity of all three
forms of divinity and divine activity:
Brahma as creator, Vishnu as preserver
and sustainer, and Shiva as destroyer.Tripurari
Triphala
Another name for the Urdhvapundra,
the characteristic forehead mark of
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. Although
there is considerable variation, the basic
form is three vertical lines, in contrast to
the three horizontal lines worn by
Shaivite ascetics. See Urdhvapundra.
Tripundra
Sectarian mark of three horizontal lines,
most commonly applied to the forehead
but which can also be applied to the
back, heart, shoulders, arms, and legs.
The tripundra marks the person wearing
it as a devotee (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
and although this mark is most com-
monly worn by renunciant ascetics,
householders also wear it. According to
one interpretation, the three lines repre-
sent the three prongs of Shiva’s trident;
according to another, they symbolize
Shiva’s third eye. The three lines are
drawn by dipping the first three fingers of
the right hand into a sacred ash known as
vibhuti (“power”) and then drawing
them across the forehead. In earlier times
vibhuti was made from wood ash that
had been sifted through cloth until it was
as fine as talcum powder. This is still done
today, primarily by ascetics who usually
use the ash from a dhuni, or smoldering
ascetic fire, which has sacred character-
istics; vibhuti can also be bought in stores
selling religious supplies.
Tripura
(“three cities”) In Hindu mythology, the
triple city built by the three sons of the
demon Taraka: Kamalaksha, Tarakaksha,
and Vidyunmali. Shiva eventually
destroyed the demons’ three cities, and
as a result one of Shiva’s epithets is
Tripurari, the “Enemy of the Three City.”
Tripurari
Epithet of Shiva as the enemy (ari) of the
Triple City (Tripura). According to the
mythic charter, three demons are
An ascetic wearing tripundra markings,
three horizontal lines that indicate he
is a devotee of the god Shiva.
dismayed by their continuing defeats at
the hands of the gods, and they begin to
perform harsh asceticism (tapas) to find
the means to counter this. The god
Brahma finally comes to them, willing
to reward them with boons. However,
when the demons learn that absolute
invulnerability is impossible, they lay
down the condition that each of them
should build a city that can move over
the earth, which will come together only
once in a long time, and that these cities
can be destroyed only by a single arrow
that pierces through them all at the
same time.
This boon renders the demons prac-
tically invulnerable, and they proceed to
build three magnificent cities—one of
iron, one of silver, and one of gold. They
grow rich and prosperous, but over time
they are corrupted by power and began
to oppress the earth. Finally the gods
petition Brahma for help, and Brahma
informs them that the only one with the
strength to fulfill this condition is the
god Shiva. The gods build him a bow
and arrow, and when the conjunction of
the three cities takes place, Shiva sends a
[[709]]
Trishanku
single arrow through all three, kindling a
fire that burns the cities and destroys
their inhabitants.
This story illustrates one important
facet of Shiva’s character—unlike the
god Vishnu, who often manages to trick
those he subdues, Shiva is much less
complex and attains his end by using
power against which no one can stand.
In some of the stories, one of the three
demons is himself a devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva, and when the arrow is loosed and
hurtles to destroy the Triple City, Shiva
himself rescues his devotee and his
family. This is in character, for Shiva is
portrayed as gracious to his devotees
and will do just about anything for
them. It also shows that the demons are
conceived not as completely debased
but as another race of beings with
different powers and capacities, and
who have as much potential as deities
and human beings.
Trishanku
(“three sins”) In Hindu mythology, a cel-
ebrated king of the Solar Line. He is
named Satyavrata at birth but is cursed
by the sage Vasishtha to bear the name
Trishanku because of three major sins:
He abducts another man’s wife, he
incurs the anger of his father, and he
eats beef (which he has earlier obtained
by slaughtering Vasishtha’s cow). Along
with this uncomplimentary name,
Vasishtha also curses Trishanku to be a
chandala (untouchable), which Trishanku
suffers for some time before being
restored to his kingship.
After regaining his throne, Trishanku
is a good king, but he desires to be taken
bodily into heaven. Vasishtha and his
sons ridicule this desire, but Trishanku
finds an ally in the sage Vishvamitra,
who has a long history of conflict with
Vasishtha. Vishvamitra performs the
sacrifice to take Trishanku to heaven,
but when he arrives there, he is pushed
back down by Indra, the ruler of heaven,
and Trishanku falls head downward.
Vishvamitra orders Trishanku to remain
where he is, and since Indra will not let
[[710]]

him up and Vishvamitra will not let him
down, he is suspended in midair. Indra
begins to construct a separate heaven
for Trishanku, but when Vishvamitra
threatens to create a new Indra for the
new heaven, Indra relents and takes
Trishanku to heaven in his material
body. The name Trishanku has since
become proverbial to refer to a person
trapped between two options.
Trishiras
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Trishiras is a demon
ally of Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Along with Ravana’s brothers,
Khara and Dushana, Trishiras leads a
frontal attack against the god Rama, the
epic’s protagonist. The attack is an effort
to avenge the insult to Ravana’s sister
Shurpanakha, who has been mutilated
by Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
Although he is a valiant warrior, Trishiras
is eventually killed by Rama, as are
Khara and Dushana. The failure of such
frontal attacks convince Ravana that
Rama is too powerful to kill in combat,
so he decides to take revenge by kidnap-
ping Rama’s wife Sita.
Trishul
(“three points”) The trident, which is
an important weapon associated with
both the god Shiva and the Goddess.
The trident is a modified form of
the spear (shula).
Tristhalisetu
(“The bridge to the Three Holy Cities”)
Pilgrimage text written by the great
scholar Narayana Bhatta (approx.
[[1513]]
–1570) that was intended to give the
readers precise instructions for correctly
performing the pilgrimage rites at three
important sites: Allahabad, a bathing
(snana) place at the junction of the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers; Benares,
which is renowned as a city of culture
and religious learning; and Gaya in
Bihar, a major site for the shraddha
rites for the dead. The text begins with aTryambakeshvar
section devoted to pilgrimage in general,
giving the rules for its performance, and
continues with three sections giving the
prescriptions for pilgrimages to
Allahabad, Benares, and Gaya. The
Tristhalisetu is an important example of
the class of commentarial literature
known as nibandhas (“collections”).
The nibandhas were compendia of
Hindu lore, in which the compilers
culled references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts, and then compiled these
excerpts into a single volume, often with
their own commentary. Narayana
Bhatta was one of the most learned men
of his time, and he was attempting to
define everything precisely, based on his
sources, so that people would know how
to do the right thing. The initial section
of this text has been edited and translated
by Richard Salomon as The Bridge to the
Three Holy Cities, 1985.
Triveni
(“Triple stream”) Traditional epithet for
the confluence of the Ganges and
Yamuna Rivers in the city of Allahabad,
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Although
only two rivers can be seen at the con-
fluence, the name Triveni comes from
the traditional belief that they are joined
by a third river, the Saraswati, which
flows underground and is unseen to the
naked eye.
Trivikrama
(“[taking] Three Steps”) Epithet of the
god Vishnu in his avatar, or incarna-
tion, as a dwarf (Vamana). The name
exists because diminutive Vamana begs
three paces of land from the demon-
king Bali and then grows to such a large
size that these three paces measure out
the universe. See Vamana avatar.
Triyuginarayan
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in
the Mandakini River valley in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas,
fifteen miles down from Kedarnath. The
site for Triyuginarayan is on the top
of a mountain, surrounded by forest.
Triyuginarayan’s major temple is dedi-
cated to the god Vishnu in his form as
Narayana, and in front of the temple is a
pit in which a fire is said to have been
smoldering for the past three cosmic
ages (triyugi). According to its charter
myth, Triyuginarayan is the site at which
the deities Shiva and Parvati were mar-
ried, a ceremony to which this continu-
ously smoldering fire (in its guise as
Agni, the fire-god) stands as the witness.
Trnavarta
In Hindu mythology, Trnavarta is one of
the demon assassins sent by Kamsa, the
demon-king of Mathura, in an attempt
to kill his nephew, the child-god
Krishna. Trnavarta is a whirlwind that
sweeps Krishna up into the air, but
Krishna holds tight to Trnavarta until he
simply blows himself out.
Truth, Power of
In popular Hindu belief, truth is seen as
having magical power of its own, a
power to which people can appeal in
their time of distress. One way of
appealing to this power is through the
famous act of truth, a conditional state-
ment in which the first part is a true
statement about one’s past behavior and
the second part a request for some spe-
cific result (for example, “If I have always
given to those who begged from me,
may this fire not burn me”). The power
of truth was also invoked in trial by
ordeal and was seen as the power
that made the ordeal a valid means of
testing people.
Tryambakeshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
village of Trimbak in the Nasik district
of the state of Maharashtra, at the head-
waters of the Godavari River. The tem-
ple is named for its presiding deity, the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
“Three-Eyed Lord.” Shiva is present at
[[711]]
Tuesday
Tryambakeshvar in the form of a linga,
the pillar-shaped image that is his sym-
bolic form. The Tryambakeshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. The charter myth for
Tryambakeshvar begins with the sage
Gautama, who unwisely hits an old cow
with a stick, killing it, and thus incurs
the sin of cow slaughter. Gautama is told
that to expiate his sin, he first has to
amass enough merit to bring the Ganges
down to earth, and after he has purified
himself by bathing (snana) in the
Ganges, he has to make and worship 10
million Shiva lingas formed from the
sand on its banks. Gautama undertakes
his penance (prayashchitta) diligently.
Upon worshiping the 10 millionth linga
he is rewarded by a vision of Shiva, who
grants his wish that both the Ganges and
Shiva will remain there forever—the for-
mer in her form as the Godavari, the lat-
ter as Tryambakeshvar.
Tuesday
(Mangalvar) The third day of the week,
presided over by the planet Mars
(Mangal). The planet Mars is deemed
inauspicious, both because of its red
color (reminiscent of blood) and
because of its associations with war and
disorder. Tuesday is widely considered
an unlucky day, and many people
abstain from certain kinds of activity on
it. Travel is particularly discouraged
unless absolutely necessary. Cutting the
hair and beard is also discouraged, and
in much of northern India, barbers take
Tuesday off. To counter the day’s poten-
tial inauspiciousness, many people also
perform rites of protection, such as
worshiping strong protective deities
such as Hanuman—who is close
enough to human beings to understand
the problems they face, but divine
enough to be able to protect them.
Paradoxically, the literal meaning of the
name for Tuesday is the “auspicious”
(mangal) day. Giving it this euphemistic
name may simply be a bit of reverse
[[712]]

magic; that if one calls it the lucky day, it
may, in fact, turn out to be.
Tukaram
(1598–1650) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered on the worship of the god
Vithoba, at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Tukaram was a
shudra (in traditional Hinduism, there
are four main social groups, the shudras
being the lowest and least influential)
born in the small village of Dehu, where
his father was a petty merchant.
Tukaram continued in the family busi-
ness, which eventually failed because he
had little interest in worldly life. He
longed instead for the life of a renun-
ciant, in which he could completely
devote himself to God. As with many of
the other bhakti saints, he is reported to
have suffered considerable persecution
by traditionally minded brahmins, who
were uneasy about a person of his low
status gaining spiritual greatness. An
unlettered man, he is most famous for
the songs known as abhangs, which are
still widely sung in Maharashtra. He had
many disciples, including the poet-saint
Bahina Bai, and according to tradition,
he ended his life by being taken up to
heaven in a chariot of fire. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba,1960; and Justin E. Abbott
(trans.), The Life of Tukaram, 1980.
Tulsi
A small shrublike plant commonly
denoted the “holy basil.” For devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, the tulsi
plant is a form of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi,
who is cursed to take birth as a plant.
According to the story, Lakshmi sits with
Vishnu’s wives, the goddesses Ganga
and Saraswati. Ganga makes amorous
eyes at Vishnu, and when Saraswati
protests this indecency, a quarrel breaks
out. By the time it is over, Ganga and
Saraswati have cursed each other to be
born on earth as rivers. Vishnu has beenTulsi Vivah
cursed to be born as a stone (the shala-
gram); and Lakshmi, who tries only to
mediate the quarrel, is cursed to be born
as a plant. This plant is thus a form of
Lakshmi, and pious Vaishnavas culti-
vate a tulsi plant as an act of devotion.
The plant is especially dear to Vishnu,
and it is believed that all parts of the
plant are purifying. Any parts of it used
in worship are especially meritorious—
whether grinding the leaves to a paste to
mark one’s body, taking the leaves as
prasad (food offered to a deity as an act
of worship), or using tulsi wood for
implements or sacrificial fuel.
Tulsidas
(1532–1623) Poet-saint and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama, whose great-
est work, the Ramcharitmanas, retells
the epic Ramayana in the vernacular
language of his day. According to evi-
dence in his poetry, Tulsidas was born
into a desperately poor brahmin family,
but his life was transformed by the
power of Rama’s name. This can be
taken as a reference to his teacher, who
is believed to have been a Ramanandi,
but it can also be taken literally. Tulsidas
continually stresses that the name of
Rama embodies the divinity’s power and
thus makes that power accessible to
devotees. According to tradition, he
lived a fairly hard life despite his fame,
and because of his emphasis on devo-
tion, he reportedly faced problems from
other brahmins, who were concerned
about maintaining their social status.
As with all of the Ramayana’s vernac-
ular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely
translate the story of Rama but inter-
preted it according to his own religious
convictions. The two most important
shifts are his overwhelming emphasis
on the importance of devotion (bhakti)
and the saving power of the name
of Rama, to which Tulsidas gives
greater importance than Rama himself.
Tulsidas also brings in mythic material
from a variety of other sources, most
notably the Shiva Purana and the
Adhyatmaramayana. This material is
largely added to the first and last chap-
ters, where Tulsidas makes his greatest
changes from the original epic. One the-
ory to explain why Tulsidas brought in
this other material is that he was trying
to transcend narrow sectarian bound-
aries, and a sign of this is that much of
the text is narrated by the god Shiva, in
the form of a dialogue to his wife
Parvati. For part of the final book, Shiva
is supplanted as narrator by the crow
Bhushundi, who symbolizes the power
of devotion to rescue even a common
carrion-eating crow. Aside from the
Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas composed
many other works in varying regional
languages and dedicated to various
deities; the most important are the
Kavitavali, the Vinaya Patrika, the
Ramavali, and the Shrikrishnavali.
Tulsidas himself refers to writing down
his poems, and although the manuscript
tradition is uncertain for some of his
texts, the transition from song to written
text took place much faster than for
most of his contemporary poet-saints,
many of whom were illiterate. For fur-
ther information see F. Raymond Allchin
(trans.), Kavitavali, 1964; W. Douglas P.
Hill (trans.), The Holy Lake of the Acts of
Rama, 1971; and John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs
of the Saints of India, 1988.
Tulsidas Jayanti
Festival falling on the seventh day
of the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Shravan (July–August), cele-
brating the birthday of the medieval
devotional (bhakti) poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623). Tulsidas composed many
different texts, and he is one of the few
medieval poet-saints believed to have
been literate and to have actually writ-
ten down his work. His most celebrated
text is the Ramcharitmanas, a vernacu-
lar retelling of the epic Ramayana.
Tulsi Vivah
Festival marking the marriage of the
goddess Lakshmi and the god Vishnu,

the opening, with the remaining top
parts forming the vessel’s handle.
Because of its simplicity and use of read-
ily available materials, the tumari was a
symbol of ascetic life.
Tungabhadra River
Important tributary of the Krishna
River, which has its source in the
Western Ghats in southern Karnataka
and then flows north and east toward
the Krishna. The most important place
on its banks is Hampi, the ruined city
that was the capital of the Vijayanagar
empire. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
Tungnath
Tulsi plant used in Tulsi Vivah festival.
celebrated on the eleventh day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month
of Kartik. It is also celebrated as
Devotthayan Ekadashi. On this day
devotees (bhakta) place a shalagram (a
black stone containing the spiral-
shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea
creature, understood as a “self-mani-
fest” form of Vishnu) in a pot containing
a tulsi plant (considered a form of
Lakshmi). Thus they symbolically unite
Vishnu and Lakshmi and perform the
marriage ceremony for them, complete
with festive songs.
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas in the
valley between the Mandakini and the
Alakananda Rivers, fourteen miles by
footpath north of the village of
Ukhimath. The temple’s presiding deity
is the god Shiva in his manifestation
as the “Lofty Lord.” Tungnath is one of
the Panchkedar, a network of five
sacred sites spread throughout the
Garhwal region; the other four are
Kedarnath, Kalpeshvar, Rudranath,
and Madmaheshvar. This network of
five sites is seen as a symbolic represen-
tation of Shiva’s body, understandably
so, since Shiva is believed to dwell in the
Himalayas. Of these five, Tungnath is
believed to be Shiva’s arm.
Turiya
Tumari
Vessel used by renunciant ascetics. In
earlier times it would have been made of
a gourd, although today the shape is
often replicated in brass or some other
metal. The tumari is taller than it is wide,
with an open top over which the carry-
ing handle arches. Unlike another piece
of ascetic equipment, the kamandalu,
which has both a spout and a covered
top, the tumari is an open vessel. When
made of a gourd, it would simply have
entailed cutting parts off of the top for
[[714]]

(“fourth”) The name for the innermost
quarter of the Self (atman), as described
in the Mandukya Upanishad, one of the
speculative religious texts that form the
latest stratum of the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu sacred texts. As with most of the
Upanishads, the Mandukya Upanishad’s
underlying concern is to investigate
ultimate questions, in particular the
nature of the Self. The upanishad
describes the Self as having four
quarters, each of which removes another
layer of egoism. The first quarter is
waking consciousness, which isTwilight Language
characterized by perceptions of subject
and object; the second is dream
sleep, which is sheer subjectivity; the
third is deep sleep, which has neither
subject nor object; and the last is a
mysterious state simply called “the
fourth” (turiya), which is the Self. This
state is identified as the ultimate truth,
and knowledge of this brings final
liberation of the soul (moksha).
Tvashtr
(“maker of carriages”) In the Vedas, the
oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, Tvashtr is a minor deity
known as the workman of the Vedic
gods. The Vedic hymns frequently men-
tion wheeled chariots as military
devices, and his name’s literal meaning
shows the esteem in which this craft was
held, as the apex of creative work. In the
Vedas, Tvashtr is famous for crafting the
weapons of the gods, especially the
mace with which the storm-god Indra
slays the serpent Vrtra (Rg Veda 1.32). In
later times Tvashtr is identified with
the minor deity Vishvakarma, who in
later Hindu life becomes the architect
and craftsman of the gods. Since Tvashtr
has a much older textual presence
than Vishvakarma, this seems to be
an attempt to identify one divine
workman as another, based on their
similar functions.it was known as the second birth, and
thus the initiates were “twice-born.” The
first birth was biological and based on
nature, whereas the second was cultural
and marked higher religious status.
Although in its strictest sense this word
refers only to such initiates, in a more
general sense it can denote any person
belonging to a varna whose members
are eligible for this initiation—that is,
any brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya.
Twice-BornTwilight Language
(dvija) In its most specific sense,
this word denotes a man from the
highest traditional social groups
(varnas)—brahmin, kshatriya, and
vaishya—who has undergone the ado-
lescent ritual initiation known as the
upanayana samskara. This initiation
gives the entitlement and the obligation
to study the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts, and definitively divides
society between those who have this
entitlement and those who do not—
namely, all children, women, and men not
belonging to these three groups. Because
of this initiation’s ritual significance,
Sadhu carrying a tumari.
One of the translations for the term
Sandhabhasha. Sandhabhasha is a
symbolic language used in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
in which the elements of tantric
worship are described in a coded
language often drawn from the private
parts and functions of the human
body. This is done to hide the tradition’s
particulars from the uninitiated.
See Sandhabhasha.
[[715]]
Tyag
Tyag
(“renunciation”) Practice of renuncia-
tion stressed most by ascetics, but even
among this group, some stress it more
than others. Some ascetics carry this to
extreme lengths. One famous ascetic,
Swami Karpatri, was famous for receiv-
ing the food he was given as alms into
his cupped hands, signifying the renun-
ciation of an eating-vessel. The most
extreme examples are ascetics who have
given up all clothing as a symbol of
renunciation of conventional standards,
including shame. The ultimate purpose
in such renunciation varies with the
individual, but one of the common
themes is to serve as a model of how lit-
tle one really needs to live a happy and
fulfilling life and thus to illustrate the
fundamental values that people often
forget in the bustle of everyday life.
Many ordinary people also share this
value in seeking to simplify their lives
through giving up attachments and
entanglements.

Uddhava

considerable friction between the
Udasis and the Sikh community in the
early twentieth century because the
Sikhs were more self-consciously assert-
ing their separate identity. See also
Panchayatana Puja.
Udayagiri
Udana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily “winds” considered to be
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, vyana,
and samana. The udana wind is consid-
ered to reside in the throat and to be the
force that conveys things out of the
mouth—primarily speech and song, but
also burps and (presumably) vomit.
Udasi
Ascetic community founded by
Shrichandra (traditional dates 1492–
[[1612]]
), the elder son of Guru Nanak, the
first of the ten Sikh gurus. According to
one tradition, Nanak passed over
Shrichandra as his successor because
Shrichandra had become an ascetic.
Guru Nanak disapproved of this, believ-
ing that his followers should live mar-
ried lives in society. The Udasis have
always been an ascetic sect, and since
their formation they have been seen as
distinct from the two other major
ascetic communities, the Sanyasis and
the Bairagis. The latter are separated on
sectarian grounds: The Sanyasis wor-
ship the god Shiva, and the Bairagis the
god Vishnu, whereas the Udasis wor-
ship the Panchayatana grouping of five
Hindu deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesh,
Surya, and Durga) rather than one or
another alone. During the bathing
(snana) processions at the Kumbha
Mela, the Udasis march third, behind
the Sanyasis and the Bairagis. Through
the legacy of their founder, they have
retained some informal connections
with the Sikh community, but by and
large they have always been considered
to belong in the Hindu fold. There was
Village just north of the city of Bhopal in
the state of Madhya Pradesh. Udayagiri
is famous for its rock-cut cave sculp-
tures from the Gupta era (350–550 C.E),
particularly a twenty-foot sculpture of
the god Vishnu in his form as the Boar
avatar, with the earth balanced on his
tusk. See also Gupta dynasty.
Uddalaka Aruni
A character in the Chandogya
Upanishad, one of the speculative texts
that form the latest stratum of the
Vedas. In the upanishad, Uddalaka is
the father and teacher of the boy
Shvetaketu Aruneya, and the two are a
model for the transmission of secret
teachings passed between guru and dis-
ciple. According to a story in the upan-
ishad’s sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent
away by his father to study the Vedas,
and when he returns twelve years later,
having mastered all the Vedas, he incor-
rectly considers himself learned. His
father punctures his arrogance by asking
Shvetaketu questions about the nature
of the cosmos and thus shows him the
difference between memorization and
true knowledge. When Shvetaketu
cannot answer these, he admits his
ignorance and accepts instruction from
his father on the nature of the Self
(atman). This instruction contains the
teaching “That thou art” (Tat tvam asi).
This is one of the “great statements”
(mahavakya) in Indian philosophy and
asserts the ultimate identity between
Brahman and atman, the cosmos and
the individual Self.
Uddhava

vince the other. Yet in at least one of the
accounts, Uddhava is converted to the
gopis’ point of view. For further infor-
mation see R. S. McGregor (ed. and
trans.), Nanddas, 1973.
Udgatr
The Mahakaleshvar Temple in Ujjain.
It is dedicated to the god Shiva
in the form of the “Lord of Death.”
the devotional (bhakti) literature,
Uddhava is most famous for the mes-
sage he carries from Krishna back to the
gopis, the cowherd women of Braj (a
northern Indian region on the Yamuna
River south of the modern city of Delhi)
who are Krishna’s devotees (bhakta) and
who love him more than life. Uddhava
tells the gopis not to be concerned with
Krishna’s physical absence, since as the
supreme divinity, Krishna is always with
them, even though he may not be visi-
ble. The gopis reply that such talk is fine
for intellectual folk such as Uddhava,
but that for simple women like them-
selves, who have had the delight of asso-
ciating with Krishna in the flesh, such
abstractions are absolutely useless.
Uddhava and the gopis are symbols for
two different types of religious life: one
cool and abstract, focused on an imper-
sonal divinity, and the other based on
passionate love for a particular deity.
Differing accounts of this story give dif-
ferent endings, according to the writers’
inclinations. In some of the stories,
including the earliest version in the
Bhagavata Purana, the story ends in a
[[718]]

Type of sacrificial priest in the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire—and the care and attention
devoted to detailing these sacrifices
leads to the inference that these were
the primary religious act. These rites
were so complex that they required spe-
cialized
ritual
technicians:
the
adhvaryum, the hotr, the udgatr, and
the brahman. Of these, the udgatr was
the sacrificial priest who chanted the
hymns from the Sama Veda that were
used in the sacrifice.
Udupi
Town and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Arabian Sea in the state of Karnataka,
about thirty miles north of Mangalore.
Udupi’s most famous temple is to the
god Krishna, but it is best known as the
home of the philosopher Madhva,
founder of the Dvaita Vedanta.
Ugrasena
In Hindu mythology, the king of
Mathura who is the grandfather of the
god Krishna. Ugrasena is supplanted by
the evil Kamsa, who is believed to be
Ugrasena’s son but is actually not.
According to legend, Kamsa is the son of
a demon who has taken Ugrasena’s
form, and who under this guise has
intercourse with Ugrasena’s wife.
Ujjain
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Shipra River in the state of MadhyaUlatbamsi
Pradesh, about 100 miles west of
Bhopal, the state capital. Ujjain is the
traditional center of the Malwa plateau
and has a long history as a commercial,
political, cultural, and sacred center. In
earlier times Ujjain was a major stop on
the central trade route, through which
goods from southern India were fun-
neled to other places farther north. Just
before the common era, Ujjain is said to
have been the capital of King
Vikramaditya, after whom the Vikram
era was named. Vikramaditya’s step-
brother, Bhartrhari, reportedly renounced
the throne to become an ascetic but is
best known for his poetry. In later days
Ujjain was the de facto capital of the
Gupta ruler Chandra Gupta II (r.
[[380]]
–414 C.E.), under whose patronage
the greatest Sanskrit poet, Kalidasa, is
said to have worked.
As a sacred center, Ujjain has multi-
ple attractions, and this is its major
source of contemporary importance. It
is one of the Seven Sacred Cities of
India. Dying in one of these cities is said
to bring liberation. Every twelve years
Ujjain plays host to the bathing (snana)
festival known as the Kumbha Mela,
although the mela there is smaller than
the ones at Haridwar and Allahabad.
Given its history, Ujjain is studded with
important religious sites. The most
important site is the temple to Shiva
in his form as Mahakaleshvar, the
“Lord of Death.” Shiva is present at
Mahakaleshvar in the form of a linga,
the pillar-shaped image that is his sym-
bolic form. The Mahakaleshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. Ujjain is also famous for a tem-
ple associated with Matsyendranath,
the religious preceptor (guru) of
Gorakhnath, the founder of the
Nathpanthi ascetics. In addition, Ujjain
has a temple to the nine planets, as
well as one of the baithaks, a group of
[[108]]
 sacred sites associated with the
life and activity of the philosopher
Vallabhacharya. Ujjain’s most unusual
site is the temple to the deity Kal
Bhairav. Kal Bhairav is another name for
Bhairava, a horrific form of Shiva,
and the traditional offering at the tem-
ple is liquor—a substance proscribed
and condemned by “respectable”
Hindus and thus the ideal offering for a
marginal deity such as Bhairava. See
also Gupta dynasty.
Ukhimath
Himalayan town on the Mandakini
River in the hills of Uttar Pradesh,
across the river from Guptakashi.
Ukhimath is the winter seat of
Kedarnath, a form of Shiva whose sum-
mer home is a temple in the village of
Kedarnath, high in the mountains at the
Mandakini’s headwaters. The village is
at such high altitude that it is only acces-
sible between late April and October,
after the snows have melted; in October
the temple is ritually closed until
the next spring. When the temple at
Kedarnath has been closed for the
winter, the deity (symbolically repre-
sented by a movable image) takes
residence in Ukhimath for the winter
and then moves back to Kedarnath the
following spring.
Ulatbamsi
(“upside-down language”) Word denot-
ing paradoxical language in which the
speaker’s utterances are reversals of
“normal” events, such as “The cow is
sucking the calf’s teat,” “Mouse stalks
cat,” “Rain falls from earth to sky.” The
most famous composer of such utter-
ances was the devotional (bhakti) poet-
saint Kabir, who inherited a tradition of
coded language (sandhabhasha) from
the Nathpanthi and Sahajiya religious
communities. Ulatbamsi utterances are
not intended to be simply nonsensical,
nor is it simply a coded language in
which one term stands for another; they
are rather intended to stimulate the
hearer to active listening, interpretation,
and searching for a truth that lies
beyond right side up and upside
down. For a long discussion of
[[719]]
Uma
ulatbamsi, see Appendix A in Linda Hess
and Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak
of Kabir, 1983.
Uma
Epithet of the goddess Parvati, wife of
the god Shiva. The name supposedly
comes from the exclamation uttered by
Parvati’s mother, Mena, when Parvati
announces that she intends to perform
asceticism to win Shiva as a husband.
According to the story, Mena covers her
ears with her hands and replies “U Ma!”
(Oh, don’t!) As with all forms of Parvati
(and all married goddesses), Uma is
a beneficent and benevolent presence,
maternal and life affirming, although
at times she can be capricious and
spiteful if insulted. For more informa-
tion on Uma and all the goddesses
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Untouchable
Name denoting certain jatis who were
considered so impure that their very
presence was polluting to caste
Hindus, that is, Hindus belonging to
the four varnas (major social divi-
sions). Jatis are endogamous social
subgroups—groups in which members
are forbidden to marry outside of their
particular group—that were often
defined by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation. Untouchability usually stemmed
from occupations considered impure or
debased, such as working with leather,
in the case of the Chamars, or the
groups whose hereditary occupation
was to remove night soil, often by carry-
ing it in baskets balanced on their heads.
In traditional society, untouchables
were subject to numerous restrictions
and prohibitions on where they could
live, work, draw water, and even move
about. In many cases they had to
announce their presence to allow caste
Hindus to remove themselves from the
area. Although untouchability has been
illegal since independence, social atti-
tudes supporting it persist, and in a
[[720]]

country in which one’s name often con-
veys one’s jati, such discrimination is
difficult to escape. In many places these
people are still underprivileged and
desperately poor, as a legacy of the past.
In recent years they have become more
militant—among other things, adopting
the name dalit (“oppressed”) to describe
themselves—and have begun to
exercise their power at the ballot
box, trying to take advantage of their
considerable numbers.
Upachara
(“honoring,” “entertaining”) In its literal
meaning, this word denotes the act of
showing politeness, courtesy, or honor
to any superior. In the context of wor-
ship, the meaning has been extended to
refer to the things that are normally
offered to the deity as part of the stan-
dard hospitality that would be offered to
any honored guest. Although there are
differing enumerations of these offer-
ings, one of the most common lists has
sixteen of them: summoning (avahana),
offering a seat (asana), water for wash-
ing the feet (padya), thirst-quenching
beverages (arghya), water for rinsing the
mouth (achamaniya), bathing (snana),
clothing (vastra), affixing the sacred
thread (yajnopavit), fragrant unguents
(anulepana), flowers (pushpa), incense
(dhupa), lamp (dipa), food (naivedya),
reverential salutation (namaskara), cir-
cumambulation (pradakshina), and
dismissal (visarjana). To give all sixteen
offerings is a long and detailed ritual,
and the most common of the offerings is
the eleventh, the offering of light, which
is also known as arati.
Upadana
In Indian philosophy, the word
upadana denotes the “material cause”
for something, that is, the stuff from
which it is formed. Although this notion
seems obvious to modern materialist
ears, it carries several important
assumptions that not all Indian
philosophical schools were willing toUpanayana (“bringing-near”) Samskara
concede—namely, that there were real
objects in the world, that they were
made from other things, and that these
things underwent real transformations.
The notion of a material cause was held
by the “realist” schools, most notably
the Samkhya, Nyaya-Vaisheshika,
and Vishishthadvaita Vedanta. It was
opposed by the Buddhist schools, whose
assumption that reality was constantly
changing made the notion of real things
problematic. It was also opposed by the
Advaita Vedanta school, whose starting
assumption was that ultimately there
was only one “real” thing—the formless
Brahman (Supreme Reality)—and thus
that the notion of anything becoming
anything else was in error.
Upadhi
(“obstruction”) In Indian logic, a coun-
terexample that renders an inference
(anumana) invalid by showing that the
reason (hetu) given as evidence for the
initial assertion (sadhya) is not invari-
ably true. For example, the inference
that “there is smoke because there is
fire” was judged invalid because of the
counterexample of the red-hot iron ball,
which was considered fiery but not
smoky. Since the red-hot iron ball was a
class of fiery things that did not smoke,
it showed that the reason given for the
inference did not account for every case
of the thing to be proved (sadhya)—and
thus raised the possibility that there
were other such cases as well. This
invalid inference fails the requirement
known as pervasion (vyapti), in which
the reason must account for every
possible case; this is critical for validity
in an inference. Needless to say, the
search for such counterexamples was an
essential part of Indian logic, since
one such example could discredit an
opponent’s argument. For further
information and elaboration, see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Upamana
(“analogy”) According to some philo-
sophical schools, upamana was one of
the pramanas, or the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge. The classic example of
this pramana describes a traveler going
to a certain region who is told that he
will encounter a certain animal that
looks somewhat like a cow; upon going
there this analogy helps him identify the
animal. Some philosophical schools
deny that this is a separate pramana
and classify it as a variety of inference
(anumana). Those who accept it as a
fourth pramana—primarily the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school—stress that accord-
ing to the rules of inference, a valid
inference must be grounded in previous
perceptions. In the case of the traveler,
his ability to identify is not based on
any differences drawn from previous
perceptions of that type of animal, since
he has never before seen the type of
animal he actually encounters. He
knows what it is because it looks
“somewhat like a cow.” Thus an
additional pramana was needed to
account for this. See also philosophy.
Upanayana
(“bringing-near”) Samskara
Traditionally, the eleventh of the life
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
a young man received a religious initia-
tion that functioned as a symbolic “sec-
ond birth,” conferring on him new
capacities and responsibilities. This cer-
emony marks the symbolic end of child-
hood and, as with many such rites of
passage, the creation of a new social
identity. After this rite the initiate
becomes a brahmacharin, the first of
the stages of life (ashramas) for a
“twice-born” man. This initiation gives
the entitlement and the obligation to
study the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts, and
according to the traditional model, the
young man would have done this while
living in the household of his guru. With
[[721]]
Upanishad
this entitlement came responsibilities,
particularly to observe purity laws, to
which younger children were not
subject. If nothing else, this rite is an
essential prerequisite to marriage, since
without it the young man is still
considered a child, and in some
contemporary cases it is performed
immediately before the wedding.
According to the dharma literature,
this rite was restricted to young men
from the three highest traditional social
classes (varnas), namely, brahmins,
kshatriyas, and vaishyas. Indeed, it is
the entitlement for this rite that makes
these three the “twice-born” groups. For
each group, a different age was pre-
scribed for initiation and a different
duration fixed for study, with brahmins
being both earliest to start and the
longest to study. The heart of the
upanayana samskara is investing the
young man with the sacred thread
(janeu), which he must wear from that
day forth, and teaching him the sacred
formula known as the Gayatri mantra.
This rite is still important and still widely
performed, although it tends to be
stressed most by brahmins. This is not
surprising, given their traditional posi-
tion as teachers and scholars and their
concern for conserving that status, even
in modern times. For further informa-
tion see Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.),
A History of Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj
Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.
The former is encyclopedic and the
latter more accessible; despite their
age, they remain the best sources for
traditional Hindu rites.
Upanishad
The latest textual stratum in the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The literal meaning of the
word upanishad is “to sit near [a
teacher],” but a better sense of its true
meaning would be “secret teaching.”
The Upanishads mark a clean break
from the immediately preceding Vedic
literature, the Brahmanas, in which the
essential concern was to lay out the
[[722]]

concrete procedures for performing
highly complex sacrificial rites. In con-
trast, the Upanishads were concerned
with more speculative and abstract
questions: the essential nature of the
cosmos, the essence of the human
being, and the relationship between
these two. The conclusion in the
Upanishads is that the essence of the
universe is an impersonal reality known
as Brahman, and that the essence of the
human being is called the “Self”
(atman). The fundamental insight and
essential teaching in the Upanishads
is the identity of Brahman and atman,
and thus of the macrocosm and the
microcosm. This identity is one of the
most fundamental Hindu religious ideas
and underlies religious thought up to
the present time.
The twelve or thirteen oldest upan-
ishads are not a cohesive set but a series
of independent documents, although
the later ones were clearly influenced by
the earlier ones. The two oldest are the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and the
Chandogya Upanishad. Each is much
longer than all the others combined,
they are written in prose as a series of
dialogues between famous sages, the
Sanskrit language in them is clearly
more archaic, and their ideas are embry-
onic and undeveloped. Later upan-
ishads—such as the Isha, Kena, Katha,
Prashna, and Mandukya—are much
shorter, are written in verse, and have
well-developed ideas. Some of these
introduce the notion of theism, but not
until the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is
the Supreme Being identified as a god,
in this case Rudra. For much of their
history, the Upanishads would have
been transmitted orally from master to
student; this makes it unlikely that these
texts were widely known because they
would have been secret and carefully
guarded teachings.
The Upanishads are important
because of the speculative questions
they ask and because many of their
teachings are fundamental assumptions
in Hindu religious life, even today: the
notion of an eternal Self that gives aUrdhvabahu
being continuous identity; the idea of
reincarnation (samsara) commensurate
with one’s deeds; the concept that some
single unifying power lies behind the
world’s apparent diversity; and the con-
viction that this can be attained only
through individual realization, usually
described as a flash of mystic insight. As
texts carrying the religious authority of
the Vedas, the Upanishads were also
extremely important in the develop-
ment of Hindu philosophical schools,
particularly Advaita Vedanta, which
shares this overriding emphasis on
inner realization. For information on the
Upanishads themselves, see Robert
Ernest Hume (trans.), Thirteen Principal
Upanisads, 1965. See also philosophy.
Upasaka
(“servant”) A person engaged in
upasana—that is, having an intent focus
on serving and worshiping a deity.
Upasana
“food.” In other cases one will abstain
from certain types of food, such as for
the Santoshi Ma Vrat, in which the per-
son must not eat anything containing
sour or bitter flavors.
When fasting is performed as expia-
tion (prayashchitta), the prescriptions
are usually concerned with the amount
of food eaten rather than the particular
type. The best-known rite of this kind is
the chandrayana, a penitential rite last-
ing for one lunar month in which the
penitent’s food consumption mirrors
the monthly course of the moon. The
performer begins by eating fourteen
mouthfuls of food on the first day
of the waning moon, then one less
mouthful on each successive day, with
a complete fast on the new moon day.
On each successive day during the
waxing moon, the penitent eats one
more mouthful, finishing at fifteen on
the day of the full moon.
Upendra
(“service”) General term denoting reli-
gious practice or spiritual discipline as a
whole. Aside from the explicit notion of
serving the deity (or guru), the word
also connotes an intent focus on the
part of the performer—not so much the
particular things one is doing, but the
overall attitude of care and attention
with which one does them.(“junior Indra”) Epithet of the god
Vishnu. It is first used in some late
hymns in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious texts, in which Vishnu is por-
trayed as a subordinate and companion
of the storm-god Indra, who is the pri-
mary Vedic deity. The epithet continues
to be used later despite Indra’s eclipse as
a significant deity, and thus its literal
meaning is no longer true. See Vishnu.
UpavasaUpside-Down Language
General term denoting fasting, which
is sometimes performed as a pre-
scribed action for particular religious
observances such as festivals and vows
(vrats), and which is also done as
a means of expiating one’s sins.
Although upavasa can refer to total
abstinence from food and drink, it
usually entails modification of one’s
diet. In some cases, as on the festival of
Shivaratri, such “fasting” entails
abstaining from cooked grains, which
are considered such an essential ele-
ment in a meal that in parts of India
the word rice is also used to mean
Term designating the type of utterances
known as ulatbamsi, so called because
these utterances intentionally describe
things contrary to the way they are in
the “normal” world. See ulatbamsi.
Urdhvabahu
(“[one whose] arm is upraised”) Name
for a person practicing a particularly
severe form of physical mortification, in
which one or both arms are kept contin-
ually raised. After some time the mus-
cles atrophy, and the arms cannot be
lowered again. Although urdhvabahu is
[[723]]
Urdhvapundra
An ascetic with the urdhvapundra mark on his forehead.
It consists of three vertical lines and indicates that he is a devotee of the god Vishnu.
not very common, it has a long-attested
history as an ascetic practice. As with all
such harsh physical asceticism, this is
believed to give one the great benefits of
spiritual awareness and magical power.
This belief is based partly on the cultur-
ally accepted notion that the willingness
to endure physical suffering generates
such spiritual power, but this belief
could also stem from the strength
of will needed to carry this out—a
strength of will that would presumably
have correlates in other dimensions
of one’s personality.
Urdhvapundra
Name denoting the characteristic fore-
head mark (tika) worn by the ascetic
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
The urdhvapundra’s basic pattern is
made of three vertical lines, in contrast
[[724]]

to the three horizontal lines worn by the
Sanyasis, who are devotees of Shiva.
There are many variations in the design,
and many different materials can be
used: sandalwood paste, white clay, yel-
low clay, and red vermilion. The only
thing that is never used is the sacred ash
(vibhuti) characteristic of the Sanyasis.
The design and materials used for the
urdhvapundra are quite distinctive
among various Vaishnava ascetic com-
munities, and from this, one can easily
identify a particular ascetic’s affiliation.

Tilakas—
Sectarian Marks Worn by Worshipers of
Visnu,” IAVRI-Bulletin 11 and 12, 1982.
Urdhvaretas
(“[one whose] semen is drawn
upward”) Epithet for someone keepingUtkutikasana
a vow of celibacy, particularly a lifelong
vow. In the Hindu tradition, celibacy is
important not only for removing one
from enjoying the pleasures of the flesh
but because on a more basic level,
semen is considered the concentrated
essence of a man’s vital energies.
Expending semen is necessary for pro-
creation, but otherwise it should be
retained, as a way to conserve one’s vital
forces. In popular belief, when a man
has been celibate for a certain time, the
semen is drawn upward to the brain,
where it nourishes one’s intellectual
and spiritual faculties.
Urushringa
Architectural detail in the temple archi-
tecture of Khajuraho, one of the major
forms of the northern Indian Nagara
style. The Nagara style’s primary feature
is a shikhara, or tower. This primary
shikhara is often surrounded by smaller,
subsidiary towers, to lead the eye up to
the highest point, which is directly over
the image of the temple’s primary deity.
The urushringas are turrets built on the
sides of these towers, whose shape repli-
cates that of the tallest central tower and
that serve to draw the eye upward to the
highest tower.
Urvashi
In Hindu mythology, a particular celes-
tial nymph (apsara) who is most famous
for her association with King Pururavas.
Urvashi comes to stay with Pururavas
under several conditions, including that
she should never see him naked. When
she has been gone from heaven for a
while, the god Indra notices her absence
and schemes to get her back. One night
he sends several minor deities to steal
two lambs of which Urvashi is very fond,
and when Pururavas leaps up to regain
them, a flash of lightning reveals him
naked, and Urvashi leaves him. They are
separate for some time but are eventually
reunited—in some accounts for good,
and in others for only one night a year.
Ushas
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts,
Ushas is a goddess associated and
sometimes identified with the dawn.
She is described as lighting the path for
the sun and driving away the darkness
and evil; her presence is thus associated
with the regularity of the cosmic order.
Ushas is most notable not for what she
does—she is a minor deity, mentioned
in only a handful of the Vedic hymns—
but because she is one of the few god-
desses in the Vedas. The virtual absence
of female divinities in the Vedas is one of
the factors behind the notion that the
great Goddess, one of the three major
deities in later religious life, has her
roots in indigenous goddess worship.
For more information on Ushas and all
the goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Utkala
Northern Indian brahmin group that
makes up one of the five northern brah-
min communities (Pancha Gauda); the
other four are the Kanaujias, the
Maithilas, the Gaudas, and the
Saraswats. Utkala brahmins are found
only in the coastal regions of Orissa, on
the Bay of Bengal, but their ritual con-
trol over the pilgrimage sites there, par-
ticularly the city of Puri, have helped
them remain a significant group.
Utkutikasana
Sitting posture (asana) in yoga practice
in which the legs are contracted, with
the soles of the feet pressed against each
other and the outer part of the feet and
legs flat on the ground. This posture is
the one in which images of the deities
are portrayed in Hindu iconography,
and it seems to be the position called
samasthana in the commentaries to the
Yoga Sutras. This position is also
notable because it appears to be por-
trayed on one of the seals from the
Indus Valley civilization; the figure in
this position is the mysterious horned
[[725]]
Utpanna Ekadashi
deity that some viewers have sought to
identify as a “proto-Shiva.”
Utpanna Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Margashirsha (November–December).
As for all of the eleventh-day obser-
vances, this is dedicated to the worship
of Vishnu, and on this day especially, in
his form as Krishna. Most Hindu festi-
vals have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship and often promise specific ben-
efits for faithful performance. Those
observing this vow should fast com-
pletely on the tenth and perform full
worship during the brahma muhurta of
the eleventh. On this ekadashi, only
fruits should be offered as food for the
deity. Faithfully keeping this festival is
believed to bring liberation of the soul
(moksha). The name Utpanna means
“born,” and the charter myth for this
celebration is that of Anasuya, wife of
the sage Atri. Anasuya is famous for her
devotion to her husband, and the wives
of the gods become jealous of her.
Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati send
their husbands (Vishnu, Shiva, and
Brahma) to try to compromise her
fidelity; the gods come begging for food,
but they refuse to accept it unless
Anasuya gives it to them naked. Through
the power she has gained from her devo-
tion to her husband, Anasuya turns the
three gods into infants and then nurses
them until they are satisfied; these three
gods are later “born” into her household:
Vishnu as Dattatreya, Shiva as Durvasas,
and Brahma as Chandra.
Utsava Murti
(“festival image”) Image of a deity that is
able (and intended) to be moved. These
are used mainly during festivals, when
the image of the deity is paraded around
the town or city on the model of a kingly
procession, symbolically surveying his
or her realm. The other general class of
[[726]]

Hindu images is the sthala murti,
which is fixed in one place and never
moves from it.
Uttara (“Later”) Mimamsa
Another name for the philosophical
school also known as Vedanta, which
was called Uttara Mimamsa to distin-
guish it from Purva Mimamsa, another
philosophical school. See Vedanta.
Uttararamacharita
(“Later Acts of Rama”) Drama written by
the Sanskrit playwright Bhavabhuti
(8th c.), which retells the story of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two
Sanskrit epics. Bhavabhuti’s play largely
follows the plot of the original Valmiki
Ramayana, with one important differ-
ence. Valmiki’s text ends with Rama’s
banishing Sita because of suspicions
about her virtue and Sita’s being swal-
lowed up by the earth, which is her
mother and witness to her chastity. The
Uttararamacharita, on the other hand,
ends with a complete reconciliation
between Rama and Sita. This change
may have been prompted solely by the
desire for a happy ending, which is one
of the characteristic features of Sanskrit
drama. It may also indicate that some
people were not comfortable with the
moral ambiguities of the original text, in
which Rama, although claimed to be
divine, sometimes acts in unscrupulous
and disturbing ways.
Uttarayana
Term denoting the six months of the
solar year in which the sun is believed to
be moving northward. In the common
era, this would be the period between
the winter solstice and the summer sol-
stice (roughly December 20 to June 20)
and would be based on the actual
motion of the sun with respect to the
earth. The Indian solar year is based on
the motion of the sun through the zodiac,
which is calculated differently than in
Western astrology. The uttarayana
begins on Makara Sankranti (the dayUttar Pradesh
the sun is calculated as entering
Capricorn, usually January 14) and ends
the day before Karka Sankranti (the day
the sun enters Cancer, usually calculat-
ed as July 14). The uttarayana is consid-
ered a more auspicious time than the
Dakshinayana (in which the sun is trav-
eling toward the south) because the
guardian deity for the southern direc-
tion is Yama, who is death personified.
Uttarkashi
(“northern Benares”) Himalayan town
and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bhagirathi River in northern Uttar
Pradesh. As its name indicates,
Uttarkashi is claimed as the northern
form of the city of Benares, the city of
the god Shiva that is one of the most
sacred sites in India. Uttarkashi’s charter
myths also claim that in the present age,
Shiva no longer dwells in Benares, but
instead lives in Uttarkashi. To buttress
the claim to being the northern Benares
Uttarkashi shows many parallels and
homologies with Benares itself: In both,
the Ganges River flows in a northern
direction through the city; both have
their core region defined as the area
between the Varuna and Asi Rivers;
both are enclosed by a panchakroshi
pilgrimage route; and in both, the pri-
mary deity is Shiva in his form as
Vishvanath. Uttarkashi is a site of great
antiquity—inscriptions have been dis-
covered from the seventh century C.E.—
and although these parallels to Benares
might seem slavish, the basis of this
claim is not just that Uttarkashi is a holy
place, just as Benares is a holy place, but
that the holiness of Uttarkashi is equal
to that of Benares. Aside from its impor-
tance as a pilgrimage town, Uttarkashi
is also the district headquarters and
a major supply point to the other sites
in the region. The town was severely
damaged in an earthquake in early 1993
and has been rebuilding slowly since
that time.
Uttar Pradesh
(“northern state”) Modern Indian state
running along the border with Nepal.
Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous
state and is thus one of its most politi-
cally important. The state has a range of
different ecosystems, from the high
Himalayas to the rice-growing plains in
its eastern basin, which gives it
immense natural and social variety.
Uttar Pradesh also contains the sources
and much of the length for both the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, and the
state thus contains many of the holiest
sites in India. Although a full catalog
would be difficult to give, some of
the state’s major sacred sites (tirthas)
are the four Himalayan Dhams
(“[divine]
abodes”),
Yamunotri,
Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath;
the sacred cities of Haridwar,
Allahabad, and Benares; the city of
Ayodhya, the mythic home of the
god Rama; and the Braj region south
of Delhi, which is mythically associated
with the god Krishna. For general
information about Uttar Pradesh and
all the regions of India, an accessible
reference is Christine Nivin et al.,
India, 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998. See

Vachaspati Mishra
## V
Vachaspati Mishra
(ca. late 15th c.) Commentator and com-
piler of the dharma literature. He com-
posed dozens of texts in his working life,
including a number of digests (nibandha)
organized around various subjects,
including daily religious rites, purifica-
tion, pilgrimage, death rites (antyeshthi
samskara), political life, judicial proce-
dures, and funeral rites. In these digests
Mishra would draw material relating to
the theme from a number of different
religious texts, weigh them, and some-
times interpret their position on a reli-
gious issue. Mishra was much respected
for his learning and piety, and his texts
were an important resource to those
who followed him.
Vadagalai
One of the two main subsects in the
Shrivaishnava religious community, the
other being the Tengalai. The Shri-
vaishnavas are devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu, and the community’s roots
lie in the devotional hymns of the
Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between
the seventh and tenth centuries. Two
centuries later, the Alvars’ devotional
outpouring was organized and system-
atized by the philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.), who is considered the
Shrivaishnava founder. Ramanuja was
convinced that Brahman, or Supreme
Reality, was a personal deity rather than
an impersonal abstract principle, and he
was also convinced that devotion
(bhakti) was the most important form of
religious practice. Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions and
[[728]]

thus opposed the Advaita Vedanta
school, founded by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, which believed that
the Supreme Being was impersonal and
that realization (jnana) was the best
spiritual path.
The split between the Tengalais and
the Vadagalais came several centuries
later and stemmed from differing per-
spectives on what the individual must
do to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The Vadagalais not only
stress the saving power of God’s grace,
but also assert that the individual must
respond to that grace and take an active
role in his or her salvation. This belief is
in complete contrast to the Tengalais,
who emphasize the need for absolute
surrender (prapatti) to the grace of God,
through which devotees are saved with
no action of their own.
Vagish
(“Lord of Speech”) Epithet of the poet-
saint Appar, reflecting the power of his
devotional poetry. Appar was one of the
earliest of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three southern Indian poet-saints
of the seventh and eighth centuries who
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. See Appar.
Vaidyanath
Form of the god Shiva, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of Physicians” (vaidya).
A temple is named for him at Deoghar
in the state of Bihar. Shiva is present at
Vaidyanath in the form of a linga, the
pillar-shaped image that is his symbolic
form, and the Vaidyanath linga is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, a network of
sites deemed especially sacred to Shiva,
and at which Shiva is uniquely present.
Vaidyanath’s charter myth is associated
with the demon-king Ravana, who is
said to be a great devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva. Ravana travels to Shiva’s home on
Mount Kailas and practices harsh
asceticism for years, hoping to gain a
vision of Shiva. When his asceticism
proves unsuccessful, the ten-headedVaisheshika
Ravana proceeds to cut off his heads,
one by one, and to offer them to Shiva.
As he is about to cut off the last of his
heads, Shiva appears before him and
grants Ravana a boon. Ravana asks for
Shiva to come and live in his palace in
Lanka, a request that would have made
Ravana invincible. Shiva agrees to come
in the form of a linga, but warns Ravana
that wherever the linga touches the
earth, it will stay there forever. As
Ravana begins traveling back to Lanka,
he feels the urge to urinate (which in
some versions is described as being
caused by Shiva himself, because the
other gods have begged Shiva not to go
to Lanka). Given the condition of his
boon, he cannot put the linga down;
moreover, since urination renders one
ritually impure, the linga would be
defiled if he holds it while answering
nature’s call (or touches it before he has
taken a purifying bath). Ravana ends up
handing the linga to a cowherd, giving
him strict orders to keep it off the
ground. The linga is so heavy, however,
that the cowherd eventually has to let it
rest on the ground, where it sticks fast,
and remains there to this day.
unconquerable during the Mahabharata
war. The loss of this weapon leaves
Karna at a disadvantage against Arjuna,
and Karna is eventually killed.
Vaikasi
Second month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Vrshabha (the zodiacal sign of
Taurus), which usually falls within May
and June. This name is a modification of
Baisakh, the second month in the lunar
calendar. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the
continuing importance of regional cul-
tural patterns. One way that the Tamils
retain their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil language, Tamil
months, and Tamil Nadu.
Vaikuntha
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
heaven in which the god Vishnu lives.
Vaishali
Vaijayanti Shakti
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, this is the name of an
all-conquering weapon that the storm-
god Indra gives to the warrior Karna.
Karna has been born wearing earrings
and a suit of armor, and Karna’s father,
the sun-god Surya, has ordained that as
long as Karna wears these, he cannot be
harmed. Indra gains them from Karna
by taking the guise of a brahmin, and
begging for them as alms from Karna,
who is famous for his generosity.
Despite being warned in a dream,
Karna cannot bring himself to refuse
and gives them to Indra. When Indra
gives him a boon in return, Karna asks
for the Vaijayanti Shakti. Karna keeps
this weapon in reserve to kill his neme-
sis, Arjuna, but is forced to use it
against another mighty warrior,
Ghatotkacha, when the latter proves
City and region in northern Bihar; the
region’s western border is the Gandaki
River, and its southern border the
Ganges river. Although now the region
is extremely backward, at the time of
the Buddha, Vaishali was one of the
largest cities in India and a center of
intellectual culture of the time. Vaishali
is famous as the birthplace of Mahavira.
He was the last of the Jain tirthankars,
the founding figures in the Jain religious
tradition. Tradition also holds Vaishali
as the site of the second Buddhist
council, convened one hundred years
after the death of the Buddha (ca. 386
B.C.E.), at which the Buddhist community
split between the Sthaviravadins and
the Mahasanghikas.
Vaisheshika
(“noting characteristics”) One of the
six schools of traditional Hindu
[[729]]
Vaisheshika
One of the many forms of Vishnu. Vishnu’s followers are known as Vaishnavas.
philosophy, and a school whose special
concern was the elucidation of physics
and metaphysics. The Vaisheshika
analysis of the categories for the
universe was later combined with the
stress on reasoning in another of the six
schools, the Nyayas, to form the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school, sometimes called
the Naiyayikas. The Vaisheshika school
was atomistic—that is, it espoused the
belief that all things were made up of a
[[730]]

few basic constituent things—and this
atomism was the root of the school’s
metaphysics. Philosophically speaking,
the Vaisheshikas were realists—that is,
they thought that the world was made
up of many different things and that
these things actually existed as per-
ceived, except in cases of perceptual
error. They believed that all things were
composed of nine fundamental sub-
stances—the five elements, space, time,Vaishnava
mind, and Selves—and that whatever
exists was both knowable and name-
able. The Vaisheshikas subscribed to the
causal model known as asatkaryavada,
which posited that when a thing was
created, it was a whole new aggregate,
completely different from its con-
stituent parts. This causal model tends
to multiply the number of things in the
universe because each act of creation
brings a new thing into being. It also
admits that human efforts and actions
are one of the causes influencing these
effects, making it theoretically possible
to act in a way that brings final libera-
tion of the soul (moksha).
According to the Vaisheshika analy-
sis, the objects of experience can be
divided into six categories: substances,
qualities, activity, universals, particu-
lars, and inherence (samavaya); some
later Vaisheshikas add a seventh category,
absences. The first three categories
can be perceived, whereas the others
must be inferred, but the concept of
inherence is central to their system of
thought. Inherence is the subtle glue
connecting all the elements of the uni-
verse: wholes and their parts, sub-
stances and their qualities, motions and
the things that move, general properties
with their particular instances, and most
important, pleasure and pain to the Self.
The philosophical problems with inher-
ence—particularly the notion that it was
one single principle and not a collection
of things—caused them great difficulty
and were responsible for the rise
of Navyanyaya school, which attempted
to explain these relationships in a
more sophisticated way. For further
information see Karl H. Potter and
Sibajiban Bhattacharyya (ed.), Indian
Philosophical Analysis, 1992; and
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Vaishnava
Name denoting a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, in any of his myriad
forms. Vaishnava theology is most
prominently characterized by the doc-
trine of the ten avatars, or divine incar-
nations: Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man-Lion,
Vamana (dwarf), Parashuram, Rama,
Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki. It is gener-
ally accepted that the avatar doctrine
provided a way to assimilate smaller
regional deities into the larger pantheon
by designating them as forms of Vishnu,
and it is in the form of these avatars that
Vishnu is most commonly worshiped.
Of the ten avatars, the two most impor-
tant ones have been Rama and
Krishna, although in the early cen-
turies of the common era, the Boar
avatar and the Man-Lion avatar were
influential regional deities.
Early Vaishnava religion is cloudy
and mysterious. Although Vishnu
appears in several hymns in the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, he was
clearly a minor deity, and it is difficult to
get from there to being the supreme
power in the universe. Some scholars
have speculated that the cult of
Krishna—a deified local cowherd
hero—originally came from outside
the Vedic religious matrix, and that
Krishna was identified with Vishnu as a
way to assimilate Krishna’s cult into
respectable Vedic religion. Such ideas
are intriguing but have little hard evi-
dence to support them. Inscriptional
evidence clearly shows that the worship
of Krishna was well-established by the
first century B.C.E. These devotees are
generally described as Bhagavatas
(“devotees of the Blessed One”), a name
that for the next thousand years is used
to refer to Vaishnavas in general. One
particular subset of this early Bhagavata
community was known as the
Pancharatrikas (“followers of the
Pancharatra”), who later evolved dis-
tinctive cosmological doctrines. These
mainstream Bhagavatas expressed their
devotion to Krishna by composing texts,
including parts of the Bhagavad Gita,
the Harivamsha, and various puranas,
culminating with the Bhagavata
Purana in about the tenth century.
The tone of Vaishnava devotion took
a dramatic turn with the advent of the
[[731]]
Vaishnava
Alvars, a group of twelve devotional
(bhakti) poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. Singing their hymns in the
Tamil language, the vernacular tongue
of their times, the Alvars propounded a
bhakti that was marked by passionate
devotion to God and characterized by a
profound
emotional
attachment
between deity and devotee. Along with
their
Shaiva
counterparts,
the
Nayanars, the Alvars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion vis-à-vis
the Buddhists and the Jains, and in the
process, transformed the tradition as the
devotional wave they had begun moved
northward. The period between the
twelfth and sixteenth centuries saw the
development of various Vaishnava com-
munities, often stemming from a partic-
ular charismatic religious figure.
This process began in southern
India, where the philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.) founded the Shrivaishnava
community, while the philosopher
Madhva (1197–1276) founded the com-
munity that bears his name. The next
great center was in Maharashtra, par-
ticularly in the Varkari Panth, which
was centered on the temple of Vithoba
in Pandharpur; some of this commu-
nity’s greatest figures were Jnaneshvar
(1275–1296?), Namdev (1270–1350),
Chokamela (d. 1338), Eknath (1533–
[[1599]]
), and Tukaram (1598–1650). The
Maharashtra region also saw the rise of
the Mahanubhav sect, from the thir-
teenth century. At Puri on India’s east-
ern coast one finds the worship of
Jagannath, a tribal deity assimilated
into the pantheon as a form of
Krishna. This was well established by
the twelfth century, as the poet
Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda clearly shows.
Finally, in northern India one finds sev-
eral vibrant religious groups. A very early
figure is the twelfth-century philosopher
Nimbarka, whose Nimbarki community
bears his name; several centuries later
came Vishnuswami, about whom little
is known. The greatest explosion of
northern Indian devotionalism came
in the sixteenth century, with the
[[732]]

philosopher Vallabhacharya founding
the Pushti Marg, the Bengali saint
Chaitanya founding the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community, and the poet-
saint Harivamsh (d. 1552) founding the
Radhavallabh community. All these
were based in the Braj region that is
Krishna’s mythic home, and all of them
worshiped Krishna: The Pushti Marg
and the Gaudiya Vaishnavas considered
him to be the supreme divinity, whereas
the Nimbarkis and the Radhavallabh
community worshiped him in conjunc-
tion with his consort Radha, whom they
considered Krishna’s wife and equal. It is
also in northern India that the worship
of Rama has its deepest roots, as exem-
plified in the songs of the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?). Many of these
schools with long histories are still vital
in modern times.
The final Vaishnava community that
must be addressed is comprised of
ascetics. Vaishnava asceticism is a more
recent development than that of the
Shaivas (though dates are uncertain),
and it is largely located in the northern
part of India (the Shaivas are spread
throughout the country). Vaishnava
ascetics are known as Bairagis (“dispas-
sionate”) and are primarily organized
into four sampradays (religious sects
distinguished by unique bodies of
teachings), each connected with a major
Vaishnava figure. By far the most power-
ful is the Shri Sampraday of the
Ramanandi ascetics, which traces its
spiritual lineage through the poet-saint
Ramananda to the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, whom they
claim was Ramananda’s guru. The
Sanaka Sampraday of the Nimbarki
ascetics traces its spiritual lineage to the
philosopher Nimbarka. The Rudra
Sampraday of the Vishnuswami ascetics
traces its lineage through the philoso-
pher Vallabhacharya to an earlier figure,
Vishnuswami. Finally, the Brahma
Sampraday, an ascetic subset of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava ascetics, traces its
spiritual line through the Bengali saint
Chaitanya to the southern Indian
philosopher Madhva.Vaishya
Each of these sampradays is differen-
tiated not only by its founder, but also by
its tutelary deity or deities. The
Ramanandis worship the god Rama,
whereas the others worship the god
Krishna and his consort Radha, but dif-
fer in the position that they give to
Radha. Scholars have noted that these
historical claims are either highly sus-
pect or completely spurious and that the
distinctions among the sampradays are
largely academic. Given that the over-
whelming majority of these ascetics are
Ramanandis, the others seem important
only for symbolic reasons, to include a
representative from each of the great
Vaishnava religious figures.
Vaishno Devi
Presiding goddess of the Vaishno Devi
shrine, located in a cave on Trikut
mountain in the hills near Jammu, and
one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
Pilgrims to Vaishno Devi travel by road
via Jammu to the village of Katra,
whence they walk the ten miles to the
shrine itself. As with many of the images
of the Shiwalik goddesses, the images at
Vaishno Devi are “self-manifested”
(svayambhu), in the form of three stone
outcrops. These outcrops are consid-
ered to be Mahakali, Mahalakshmi,
and Mahasaraswati, the three forms
of the Goddess mentioned in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
authoritative source for the mythology
of the Goddess. The presence of all three
goddesses is believed to make this site
extremely powerful, and according to
popular belief, Vaishno Devi grants
whatever request her devotees (bhakta)
make. According to some accounts,
those whose wishes are granted are
highly advised to make a second trip,
both to thank the Goddess and to bear
witness to her grace. The number of vis-
itors to the site has increased dramati-
cally in the recent past, perhaps
reflecting anxieties about modern
Indian life.
There are several stories connected
with Vaishno Devi’s charter myth. The
name Vaishno is a derivation of Vishnu,
reflecting the claim that Vaishno Devi
was born as a partial avatar of Vishnu.
One sign of this connection is that
Vaishno Devi is a vegetarian goddess, for
whom no animal sacrifices can be per-
formed. According to another story,
Vaishno Devi was the spot at which the
arms of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth. Since this story is never fur-
ther connected to Vaishno Devi, this
seems a transparent attempt to tie into
the network of the Shakti Pithas, a
group of shrines sacred to the Goddess,
which stretch throughout the subconti-
nent. The longest version of the charter
myth reports that the cave is discovered
by a brahmin named Shridhara.
Shridhara, a great devotee of the
Goddess (who tested him in various
ways), is disturbed by the fact that he
has no children. The Goddess reveals
the location of the Vaishno Devi cave to
him in a dream. After an extensive
search he finally finds the cave and is
soon blessed with four sons, emphasiz-
ing the claim that Vaishno Devi will
grant the desires of her devotees, what-
ever they may be. For further informa-
tion see Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993. See also pitha.
Vaishya
In the traditional Hindu social theory of
the four major social groups (varnas),
the vaishyas were the third group—less
influential than the brahmins and
kshatriyas, but with greater status than
the shudras. In this model of society,
the vaishyas’ social function was eco-
nomic activity, to provide the material
basis for social life. This image is
reflected in the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta, in which the
vaishyas are described as being created
from the Primeval Man’s (purusha’s)
thighs—a standard euphemism for the
genitals, and thus the most direct con-
nection with fruition and procreation.
In fact, the jatis (endogamous social
subgroups, often determined by hered-
itary occupation) considered to be
[[733]]
Vaitarani
vaishyas did all sorts of economic activ-
ity, from farming to animal husbandry
to all sorts of trades and services.
Vaitarani
In Hindu mythology, a river flowing
through the underworld over which
souls must cross on the way to their
audience with the god Yama, the god of
the dead. For righteous people the
crossing is fairly easy, and they are widely
believed to get over by holding the tail
of a cow. For wicked people, on the
other hand, the Vaitarani is a river of
pus, blood, spit, and other polluting
substances, in which various ferocious
beasts lie in wait.
Vajapeya
Along with the Rajasuya, one of the
two most famous of the Vedic sacrifices.
The Vajapeya sacrifice was essentially
intended to provide an established
king with continuing strength and
vitality, magically rejuvenating him
after a long reign and in the face of
advancing age. In ancient times the
rite was elaborate and entailed the
sacrifice of animals; when it is
performed in modern times it is
performed in one day, and the animal
sacrifice is symbolic.
Vajra
Name for the thunderbolt, conceived
as one of the divine weapons. It has
two symmetrical sides, sometimes
pointed, with a handle in the middle.
The vajra is an enormously important
symbol in Buddhism, particularly the
tantric forms (i.e., secret, ritually based
religious practices) found in Tibet, but
it appears very seldom in Hindu
iconography. It is attested to be an
attribute of certain forms of the gods
Ganesh and Vishnu, but on the whole it
is not as important as some of the other
symbols. See also tantra.
[[734]]

Vajreshvari Devi
(“Goddess of the Thunderbolt”)
Presiding deity of the Vajreshvari temple
in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, and the
only one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses
whose temple is in an urban center.
Kangra has a long tradition as a center of
Goddess worship and may have been a
site for practitioners of tantra, a secret,
ritually based religious practice. The
charter myth identifies Vajreshvari Devi
as one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess, which
spreads throughout the subcontinent.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess; in the case of
Vajreshvari Devi the body part was Sati’s
breast—certainly a highly charged part
of the female body, thus making it a
more attractive place for tantric practi-
tioners. Another indication of her possi-
ble connection comes from her name, in
which the image of the thunderbolt car-
ries associations with Buddhist tantric
practice. For further information see
Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the Mother,
[[1993]]
. See also pitha.
Vajroli Mudra
Yogic practice attributed to Nathpanthi
ascetics, as part of their effort to attain
physical immortality through the prac-
tice of hatha yoga. The dominant
metaphor used in describing the
process of gaining immortality in this
manner is the union of sun and moon,
in which the sun stands for the
processes of change and destruction,
and the moon for stability and immor-
tality. In some cases this union was
described in very abstract terms, as a
process in the subtle body, at other
times in the most concrete possible
fashion, for which the best example is
vajroli mudra. This is urethral suction
or the “fountain-pen technique,” in
which a man, having ejaculated into
his female partner, draws his semen,
now refined through contact with the
woman’s uterine blood, back into hisValmiki
body, along with a certain amount of
his partner’s blood. Despite some com-
mentators’ discomfort and denials
(characteristic of most references to
sexual activity as part of Hindu spiritu-
al practice), vajroli mudra is consistent-
ly named as one of the Nathpanthi
practices. For further information see
George W. Briggs, Gorakhnath and the
Kanphata Yogis, 1982.
Vakataka Dynasty
(4th–6th c.) Central Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in the
center of modern India. The Vakataka
zenith came between the fourth and
sixth centuries, during which their sway
extended through most of the Deccan
plateau. At the turn of the fifth century,
the Vakataka king Rudrasena II married
Prabhavati Gupta, creating a marriage
alliance with the northern Indian Gupta
dynasty that gave the two dynasties
sway over much of India. Prabhavati
Gupta ruled as regent following
Rudrasena’s untimely death, during
which the Vakataka kingdom was a vir-
tual part of the Gupta empire, but in the
time after that the Vakatakas regained
greater autonomy.
Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531) Philosopher, teacher, and
founder of the religious community
known as the Pushti Marg. Vallabha-
charya propounded a philosophical
position called Shuddadvaita (“pure
non-dualism”), in which the Ultimate
Reality was conceived as personalized,
in the form of Krishna, rather than the
impersonal Brahman propounded by
the Advaita Vedanta school. Since
Vallabhacharya had personalized his
conception of the Supreme Reality, the
supreme religious goal was conceived in
terms of relationship with that divine
person. This stress on devotion was
soon articulated in elaborately arranged
forms of image worship in the Pushti
Marg’s temples. The devotees (bhakta)
would visualize themselves as Krishna’s
companions during his daily activi-
ties—waking, eating, taking the cows
to graze, coming home, etc.—and thus
gain the opportunity to take part in the
divine play (lila). This emphasis on
visualization and participation was
fostered through the development of
vast liturgical resources, which were
composed by eight poets (the ash-
tachap) who were associated with
Vallabhacharya and Vitthalnath, his
son and successor. For further informa-
tion see R.K. Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacarya, 1976.
Vallabhite
Popular name for the followers of
Vallabhacharya. As the suffix clearly
shows, this term is one term formed by
non-Hindus that was used to describe a
particular Hindu group. In earlier times
it was used by British government offi-
cials, but today it is used mainly by
scholars, usually foreigners. Vallabha’s
own followers would be far more likely
to describe themselves as belonging to
the Pushti Marg.
Valli
In the mythology of southern India, the
god Skanda (in his southern Indian
form as Murugan) becomes enamored
of and marries Valli, a young girl from a
group of tribal hunters. The marriage
takes place despite his earlier marriage
to the goddess Devasena, who has been
given to him by Indra and the estab-
lished Hindu gods. Murugan’s marriage
with Valli is a sign of his connection with
the land and probably reflects his earlier
past as a tribal deity. The marriage is
described as taking place at Tiruttani in
Tamil Nadu, but he is also described as
settling at Kataragama in Sri Lanka.
Valmiki
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is
regarded as the first poet, and who is tra-
ditionally cited as the author of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Sanskrit epics. According to legend,
[[735]]
Valmiki Jayanti
composed. After this first verse
composition, the god Brahma appears,
and at Brahma’s encouragement Valmiki
composes the Ramayana.
Valmiki Jayanti
Festival celebrated on the full moon
in the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). This day is con-
sidered to be the birthday of the poet
Valmiki, who according to tradition is
the author of the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two Sanskrit epics.
Vamachara
The god Vishnu’s Vamana avatar, a dwarf.
Vishnu takes this form to release the universe
from the control of the demon Bali.
Valmiki is a bandit in his early life. One
day, one of his victims asks him
whether his family will also share the
sins he is committing, and when
Valmiki finds out that they will not, he
has a change of heart. He sits down in a
secluded place and begins to do japa
(recitation), but his heart is so black-
ened by his sins that the only words he
can say are “mara mara” (“death,
death”). After a long time the syllables
become reversed, and by reciting
“Rama Rama” he expiates his former
sins. This recitation is so long that a
colony of white ants (in Sanskrit,
named “valmika”) builds a hill over
him, and when he emerges from this he
is given the name Valmiki.
After his emergence, Valmiki builds
an ashram on the banks of the Tamasa
River and lives a quiet life. He gives shel-
ter to Sita after she has been exiled from
Ayodhya by her husband, Rama, and
also cares for her sons, Lava and Kusha.
One day when Valmiki is walking by the
Tamasa River, he sees a hunter shoot a
pair of courting Krauncha birds, and in
his intense anger, his rebuke to the
hunter comes out in verse; according
to legend, this is the first poem ever
[[736]]

(“left-hand practice”) In the secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice known as
tantra, this term denotes a type of
tantric practice that makes ritual use of
forbidden substances, such as the Five
Forbidden Things (panchamakara), or
promotes behavior that the orthodox
would consider scandalous or objec-
tionable. When seen in a tantric context,
the use of such normally forbidden sub-
stances is not mere license, but a power-
ful ritual tool. One of the most pervasive
tantric assumptions is the ultimate
unity of everything that exists. From a
tantric perspective, to affirm that the
entire universe is one principle—often,
conceived as the activity of a particular
deity—means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic thinking.
The “Five Forbidden Things” provide a
ritual means for breaking down duality
because in this ritual the adept breaks
societal norms forbidding consumption
of intoxicants, nonvegetarian food, and
illicit sexuality, in a conscious effort to
sacralize what is normally forbidden.
Within the tantric tradition itself there is
a long-standing debate about the pro-
priety of such acts, and whereas the
vamachara practice uses these elements
in their actual forms, in the dakshi-
nachara (“right-hand”) practice, other
items are substituted for the forbidden
ones. This distinction between “right”
and “left” hand also reveals the perva-
sive polarity between right and left inVana Dashanami
Indian culture, with the former being
deemed better.
Vamakhepa
(1843–1911) Ascetic devotee (bhakta) of
the Goddess in her fierce and powerful
form as Tara; his presence and supposed
miraculous powers are largely responsi-
ble for the importance of Tarapith as an
important regional sacred site (tirtha) in
West Bengal. From his earliest child-
hood, Vamakhepa was occupied with
thoughts of the Goddess, and from an
early age he took up residence in the
cremation ground at Tarapith, where he
undertook the worship of Tara. Various
stories describe his power to heal people
of all sorts of ailments, as well as his
complete disregard for all accepted
standards—according to tradition, he
once urinated on the temple’s image of
Tara, to show his contempt for a deity
made of iron, and was struck in punish-
ment by the Goddess.
Vamana Avatar
Fifth avatar of Vishnu, this one in the
form of a dwarf (“vamana”). As with all
of Vishnu’s avatars, the Vamana avatar
comes into being in a time of crisis and
serves to restore the cosmic balance
that has been thrown out of equilibri-
um. In this case the source of trouble
stems from a demon (asura) named
Bali, who has grown so powerful that
he is able to rule the entire universe,
doing as he wishes. As in many other
cases, Vishnu is able to counter and
conquer this disruptive force through
cunning and trickery, rather than simple
overt power.
The mythic tale describes how Bali is
sponsoring a great sacrifice, to which all
the gods and sages have come. Vishnu
comes in the form of a dwarf, disguised
as a mendicant brahmin. Bali gives
many rich gifts to those attending, as
part of the gift-giving (dana) associated
with sacrifice, and he offers to give
Vamana anything that he asks for.
Vamana refuses the offer of riches, land,
and material wealth, and asks only for
three paces worth of land to set up his
own sacrificial altar. Bali is amused by
the request and grants it flippantly
despite the warnings of Shukra, his reli-
gious preceptor (guru), that he should
not do this.
As soon as Bali pours water on
Vamana’s hand, marking that the gift has
been given irrevocably, Vamana suddenly
begins to grow. He grows so large that he
takes up all the space in the cosmos and
then begins to take his three steps. With
his first step he traverses the earth,
with his second the heavens, and with
his third step there is nowhere else to
go. Bali realizes that he has been
defeated, and as a gesture of submis-
sion indicates that Vishnu’s third step
should fall on his head. Vishnu’s third
step pushes Bali down into the nether-
world, where he still remains as the
ruler. As for many of the other avatars,
Bali’s fate gives an important lesson:
Vishnu’s purpose is not to destroy him,
but to restore the cosmic balance that
has been lost through one being gaining
disproportionate or inappropriate power.
Through his submission to Vishnu, Bali
remains a powerful being, but on a
diminished scale.
The motif of measuring out the uni-
verse in three steps is part of the oldest
stratum of Vishnu’s mythology. In one of
the few hymns to Vishnu in the Rg Veda
(1.154), the oldest Hindu religious text,
he is described as a protective and
benevolent deity, who with three steps
defines the boundaries of the universe.
This manifestation of Vishnu is named
Trivikrama (“[taking] three steps”); it
seems likely that the motif from this
hymn was grafted onto the Vamana
story as part of the process of assimila-
tion into the pantheon.
Vana Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were suppos-
edly established by the ninth-century
[[737]]
Vanamalin

philosopher, Shankaracharya, in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
different name—in this case, vana (“for-
est”). Upon initiation, new members
are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identities,
these ten “named” divisions are divid-
ed into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquar-
ters in one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other par-
ticular religious associations. The Vana
Dashanamis belong to the Bhogawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri, on
the bay of Bengal.
[[738]]

Vanamalin
(“wearing a garland of forest flowers”)
Epithet of the god Krishna. See Krishna.
Vanaprastha
(“forest-dweller”) According to the
dharma literature, the vanaprastha was
the third of the idealized stages of life
(ashrama) for a twice-born man, that is,
a man born into the brahmin, ksha-
triya, or vaishya communities, who had
undergone the adolescent religious ini-
tiation known as the “second birth.”
According to this idealized pattern, after
engaging in religious learning as a celi-
bate student (brahmacharin), the first
stage; marrying and raising a family as a
householder (grhastha), the second
stage; a man should, in the third, gradu-
ally disengage himself from the world by
giving up his attachments and with-
drawing to a more secluded place. The
renunciation in this third stage of life isVarkari
less severe than the last stage, the
Sanyasi—the texts are very clear that he
should remain with his wife and that he
should continue to perform the pre-
scribed daily domestic sacrifices.
Although in contemporary times it is
fairly common for older people to live a
more retired life, bequeathing the bulk
of the family affairs to their children, few
people live by the strict prescriptions for
the vanaprastha. The prescription for
this third stage of life is generally con-
sidered to be a reaction to the growth of
asceticism in the centuries before the
turn of the common era, particularly the
monastic asceticism of the Buddhists
and Jains, which they claimed was reli-
giously superior to the life of a house-
holder. The vanaprastha is a transitional
stage that paves the way for an ascetic
life, but it is set in one’s old age and thus
allows for the fulfilling of one’s duties to
family and society.
Varada Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the left hand is held with the fin-
gers pointing downward and the palm
exposed to the viewer, with the fingers
either fully extended or slightly curled.
The word varada means “boon-grant-
ing,” and the gesture is meant to indi-
cate beneficence and generosity.
Varaha Avatar
The third avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, in the form of a boar. See
Boar avatar.
Varanasi
Traditional name for the sacred city of
Benares. The name Varanasi may be
generally used to denote the whole city,
but in a more specific context this refers
to one of the concentric sacred zones
surrounding the Vishvanath temple, the
city’s ritual center. The smallest of these
zones is called Avimukta, the second is
Varanasi, and the largest is named
Kashi. The sacred zone of Varanasi is
conceived as the area between the
Varana and the Asi rivers—the traditional
boundaries of the city of Benares—but
Varanasi’s boundaries do not stretch
inland as far as those of Kashi.
Varkari
Religious community of devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, in his man-
ifestation as Vithoba. Varkari worship
has centered on Vithoba’s temple at
Pandharpur in the southern part of the
state of Maharashtra. The community’s
history begins with a series of extraordi-
nary devotional (bhakti) poet-saints,
dating from the twelfth to the seven-
teenth century: Jnaneshvar, Namdev,
Eknath, Tukaram, Chokamela, Gora,
Janabai, Bahina Bai, and many others.
One of the ways that these saints
expressed their devotion was in pilgrim-
age to Pandharpur, and this pilgrimage
is still the major ritual act in the Varkari
community. Twice a year Varkaris come
on pilgrimage to Pandharpur and time
their travel so that all the pilgrims arrive
on the same day—the eleventh day
(ekadashi) in the bright half of Ashadh
( June–July) in the summer, and the
eleventh day in the bright half of
Kartik (October–November) in the fall.
Individual pilgrims travel in small
groups called dindis, often made up of
people from the same neighborhood or
locality. The dindis are organized into
larger groups known as palkhis, each of
which is associated with one of the
Varkari poet-saints and is led by a
palanquin (palkhi, an enclosed single-
person litter borne on the shoulders of
bearers by means of poles) bearing the
sandals of that saint. Each palkhi
departs from a place associated with its
particular saint—for example, the
palkhi of Jnaneshvar leaves from the
town of Alandi in which he lived—and
thus he and all the other saints are still
symbolically journeying to Pandharpur
twice a year. During their journey pil-
grims sing the devotional songs com-
posed by these poet-saints. In this way,
the pilgrims are emulating the saints

before them, both by treading in their
physical footsteps and by singing their
songs of devotion. Although the pil-
grimage concludes with the entry to
Pandharpur and the worship of
Vithoba, the most important part is the
journey itself. For more information
see G. A. Deleury, The Cult of Vithoba,

Varna
(“color”) Theoretical system dividing
Indian society into four major groups,
each with a differing occupation and
status: brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya,
and shudra. The highest status was held
by the brahmins, who were priests and
scholars, next came the kshatriyas, who
were kings and soldiers, then the
vaishyas, whose purview was economic
life, and finally the shudras, who were
supposed to serve the others. This pic-
ture is articulated as early as the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, in par-
ticular by a hymn in the Rg Veda (10.90)
[[740]]

known the Purusha Sukta. The Purusha
Sukta describes the creation of the world
and of society as stemming from the
sacrifice of the Primeval Man
(purusha), with the brahmins coming
from his mouth, the kshatriyas from his
shoulders, the vaishyas from his thighs
(a common euphemism for the geni-
tals), and the shudras from his feet.
This four-fold scheme is conceptually
neat, but the real picture was far more
complex. For one thing, none of these
four varnas was as uniform as this
scheme might lead one to suppose:
Each of the varnas had multiple occupa-
tionally
defined
subcommunities
known as jatis, which often competed
for status with one another, even though
they may have been members of the
same varna. The other discrepancy was
that local circumstances had a great
effect on any particular community’s
social status. As one example, the
Vellala community in Tamil Nadu had a
great deal of status and power, even
though they were technically shudras,
because they were a landholding com-
munity. On the opposite end, it is not
uncommon for brahmins in northernVasant Panchami
India to earn their living by trading
or other businesses. This four-fold
varna plan does give the general status
picture, but the specifics are much
more detailed.
Varnashrama Dharma
In the dharma literature, varnashrama
dharma is the ordering of dharma or
religious duty based on the hierarchical
social ordering of the four major social
groups (varnas) and the four successive
stages of life (ashramas). According to
this theory, all people would be able to
discern their social status and appropri-
ate function based on their social class
and stage of life. The interrelationship
between these two sets of categories is
often used to denote traditional Hindu
society, in theory if not always in fact.
The term survives in modern times,
but because the doctrine of the
ashramas is now largely ignored, those
who uphold varnashrama dharma are
primarily defending the hierarchical
social divisions commonly known as the
caste system.
Varuna
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative religious texts, Varuna is
a deity associated with the sky, with
waters, with justice, and with truth.
Varuna belongs to the earliest layer of
the Indo-Aryan deities; this is clearly
shown by comparisons with the
Avesta, an ancient Iranian sacred text
that shows many parallels with the
Vedas, and with even older epigraphic
sources. As portrayed in the Vedas, how-
ever, Varuna’s influence has clearly
declined—there are far fewer hymns
addressed to him than to deities such as
Indra, Agni, and Soma, and he seems to
have played a far less important role
than these other deities in Vedic religion.
In the Vedas, Varuna is portrayed as
the guardian of rta, the cosmic order
through which the world proceeds. As
the deity associated with the high heaven,
he also watches over the deeds of
human beings and punishes them for
any transgressions. The best known
hymn to Varuna, Rg Veda 7.86, shows
Varuna’s connection with justice, moral
order, and the waters. The hymn is the
lament of a person who has committed
some offense against Varuna and whose
sin has become visible through being
afflicted with dropsy, in which the body
retains its fluids and swells. The speaker
begs Varuna to reveal the forbidden act,
“committed under the influence of
liquor, anger, or heedlessness,” so that
Varuna may be propitiated and the suf-
ferer healed.
Despite his virtual eclipse early in the
tradition, in the later tradition, Varuna
retains his association as the god presid-
ing over the waters. He is also consid-
ered to be one of the eight Guardians of
the Directions, each of which is associ-
ated with one of eight points on the
compass. Varuna presides over the west-
ern direction.
Vasant Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day
(panchami) of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Magh
(January–February), celebrated as the
first day of spring (vasant). This day is
considered sacred to the goddess
Saraswati, patron deity of the arts,
music, and learning. In her honor, cele-
brants sing songs in melodic modes
(ragas) associated with spring. Given
Saraswati’s connection with learning,
this is also traditionally reckoned as the
day on which young children should
begin their studies.
Vasant Panchami is also associated
with Kama, the god of love, since the
coming of spring brings the reappear-
ance of flowering plants, with their
scents and colors. This is supposedly
the day that Kama attempts to instill
erotic desire in the god Shiva’s heart,
first by bringing spring to Mount
Kailas, where Shiva is meditating, and
then shooting Shiva with one of his
flower arrows. Shiva awakens from his
meditation, becomes angry at Kama,
[[741]]
Vashitvam
and reduces him to ashes with a burst
of flame from his third eye. Despite
being destroyed, in the end Kama is
successful—after being awakened,
Shiva becomes aware of Parvati’s
ascetic practice and eventually becomes
her husband.
Vashitvam
(“control”) One of the eight superhuman
powers (siddhi) traditionally believed to
be conferred by high spiritual attain-
ment. This particular power gives one
the ability to control others, while
remaining free from outside control.
Vasishtha
In Hindu mythology, one of the Seven
Sages whose names mark exogamous
clan “lineages” (gotra; in exogamous
groups members must marry outside
the group); the others are Gautama,
Bharadvaja, Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Atri, and
Vishvamitra. All brahmins are believed
to be descended from these seven sages,
with each family taking the name of its
progenitor as its gotra name. In modern
times, these gotra divisions are still
important, since marriage within the
gotra is forbidden. After her marriage,
the new bride adopts her husband’s
gotra as part of her new identity.
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Vasishtha is a
very powerful sage who is the guru to
the kings of the Solar dynasty, including
King Dasharatha and his son, Rama.
Vasishtha is also famous for his long-
standing
feud
with
the
sage
Vishvamitra, which causes numerous
confrontations. The feud’s genesis is
ultimately rooted in the difference in
status between kshatriyas and brah-
mins. Vishvamitra is a king who stops
with a host of retainers at the forest
ashram of the brahmin Vasishtha. Upon
asking for food, Vishvamitra is amazed
at the ability of Vasishtha’s cow, the
Kamadhenu, to provide food for every-
one. Vishvamitra first tries to buy the
Kamadhenu, then tries to take it by
[[742]]

force, but his minions are defeated by
the magic powers generated by
Vasishtha’s tapas (ascetic practices).
Vishvamitra finally admits defeat and
begins to do ascetic practices to gen-
erate power of his own. Two of their
most celebrated clashes are over King
Trishanku and his son, Harishchandra;
in each case the real issue is the mutual
antipathy of these two sages. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Vastra
(“clothing”) The seventh of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the deity
is offered clothing, either through sym-
bolic presentation or through physically
dressing the image. The underlying
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is
to show one’s love for the deity and min-
ister to the deity’s needs.
Vastradhari
(“wearing the clothes”) Name for a
newly initiated Sanyasi ascetic, one who
has put on the ascetic robes, but still has
to undergo a period of training as a dis-
ciple to his guru.
Vasudeva
The god Krishna’s father. His most
important role in Krishna’s mythology
comes on the night of Krishna’s birth,
when Vasudeva is able to spirit
the infant Krishna out of prison, his
birthplace, to the home of his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. Vasudeva
returns that night, bearing Yashoda’s
newborn girl, who is really the
goddess Bhadrakali in disguise. The
next morning Kamsa kills the child
by dashing it against a stone, but
from the body arises the goddess, who
taunts Kamsa that the person who will
slay him has escaped.Vatsyayana
Vasudeva
(2)(“son of Vasudeva”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, a patronymic formed from the
name of his father, Vasudeva, by length-
ening the initial vowel. See Krishna.
Vasuki
In Hindu mythology, a famous Naga
(mythical serpent). Vasuki’s most famous
mythic role comes in the story in which
the gods and demons churn the Ocean
of Milk to obtain the nectar of immortal-
ity (amrta). In the form of his Tortoise
avatar, the god Vishnu serves as the
churning-base, Mount Mandara serves
as the churning-stick, and Vasuki, with
his enormous length, as the churning-
rope. With the gods on one side and the
demons on the other, they pull Vasuki
back and forth until the sea of milk gives
up its treasures.
Vata
(“air”) Along with pitta (“bile”) and
kapha (“phlegm”), one of the three
humors (tridosha) in ayurveda, the tra-
ditional system of Indian medicine.
Every person has all three of these
humors, but usually one is predomi-
nant, and this marks a person in certain
ways, particularly with regard to health,
digestion, and metabolism. Vata is asso-
ciated with the element of air, which is
quick, light, and dry. People whose pre-
dominant humor is vata are said to have
quick minds, light bodies, and tend to
always be doing something. At the same
time, they lack substantiality and can
run down easily if not careful.
Vatsalya (“calf-like”) Bhava
The fourth of the five modes of devotion
to God that were most prominently
articulated by Rupa Goswami, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a fol-
lower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used differing types of human
relationships as models for differing
conceptions of the link between deity
and devotee. These five models showed
growing emotional intensity, from the
peaceful (shanta) sense that comes
from realizing one’s complete identity
with Brahman or Supreme Reality, to
conceiving of God as one’s master,
friend, child, or lover. In the Vatsalya
mode of devotion, devotees consider
themselves as God’s parents, lavishing
love and care on the deity as a cow cares
for her calf. This is an emotionally
intense mode of relationship, but with-
out the erotic element present in the
fifth mode, madhurya bhava.
Vatsyayana
According to tradition, the author of the
Kama Sutra . This text is usually associ-
ated with an exhaustive catalog of sexu-
al positions and pleasures, which it
certainly contains, but in fact, the text
goes far beyond this. Vatsyayana was
interested in exploring desire in all its
manifestations, and the text begins with
a consideration of the four aims of life
(purushartha): worldly goods (artha),
desire (kama), religious duty (dharma),
and liberation of the soul (moksha).
Vatsyayana argued that because desire
was one of the established ends of
human life, its pursuit was thus a good
thing, as long as this pursuit did not
interfere with the other ends.
Having established the legitimacy of
desire, Vatsyayana then talks about how
to foster it. The Kama Sutra’s second
book contains the text’s best-known
material, the discussion and categoriza-
tion of various types of sexual union. It
begins by characterizing various types
of sexual endowment, both male and
female, then proceeds to describe differ-
ent sorts of embracing, kissing, scratch-
ing, and biting as symbols of passion,
sexual positions, and oral sex. This is
followed by chapters on gaining a wife,
attracting other men’s wives (which
the text discourages, except in cases
where one’s passion is “too strong”),
courtesans, and general remarks
on attraction. The text is thus a manual
for all phases of erotic life, in which
sex can be refined into a vehicle for
[[743]]
Vatsyayana
aesthetic experience, as well as pure
carnal pleasure.
Vatsyayana
(2) (4th c.) Writer and commentator in
the Nyaya school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy, which since early in the common
era has been combined with another of
the six schools, the Vaisheshikas.
Vatsyayana is best known for his
commentary on Gautama’s Nyaya
Sutras, themselves the foundational
text for the Nyaya school.
Vayu
In Hindu mythology, the deity who is
wind personified. Vayu is a minor deity
who is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions; his direction is the north-
west. Aside from being the external
winds, Vayu is also believed to be pre-
sent inside the body, in the five “vital
winds” (prana) through which all phys-
iological processes are believed to occur.
Although Vayu is a minor deity, two of
his sons are extremely significant. His
son, Bhima, is one of the five Pandava
brothers who are the protagonists in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Sanskrit epics. Bhima is famous for his
size and strength, and also for his earthy
appetites, both of which reflect the
wind’s raw, uncontrollable nature. Vayu’s
other famous son is the monkey-god,
Hanuman. Even though mythically
Hanuman is most famous for his devo-
tion and service to the god Rama, in
practical terms he is one of the most
popular and widely worshiped deities in
northern India. This popularity may
stem from his intermediate status;
because Hanuman is also a servant, he
is less remote and majestic than Rama
and, therefore, accessible to human
petitions. Another important factor is
that this accessibility is coupled with
power and the ability to protect those
who call on him.
[[744]]

Veda
(“knowledge”) The oldest and most
authoritative group of Hindu sacred
texts, also designated by the term shruti
(“heard”). According to tradition, these
texts were not composed by human
beings, but are based in the primordial
vibrations of the cosmos itself. The
ancient sages, whose faculties of per-
ception had been honed through ardu-
ous religious practice, were able to
“hear” and understand these vibrations,
and transmitted them to others in a lin-
eage of learning. On one level, the term
veda is part of the names of four individ-
ual texts—the Rg Veda, Sama Veda,
Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda, each of
which has a differing focus and content.
The term veda is also a collective term
for the material in these texts or their
associated appendices: the Vedic hymns
(samhitas), the Brahmanas, the
Aranyakas, and the Upanishads.
Although these four groups of texts are
all considered part of the Vedas, they
have very different forms and character-
istics. The samhitas are hymns of praise
addressed to particular deities, and are
found mainly in the Rg Veda and the
Sama Veda. In contrast, the Brahmanas
are detailed ritual manuals, giving the
instructions for performing complex
sacrificial rites; the Aranyakas and the
Upanishads are speculative ponderings
on the nature of the cosmos. The Vedas
were considered so sacred that for 3,000
years they were not written down, but
transmitted orally, a mode of transmis-
sion that still persists today. The Vedas’
power comes not from their literal
meaning, but from their very sound,
which is the identical sound heard by
the sages long ago. To safeguard this tra-
dition, Hindus developed an elaborate
system of mnemonics to ensure that the
texts would not be altered or corrupted,
thus preserving their efficacy.
Vedanga
(“[subsidiary] member of the Veda”)
General name for six classes of works
considered auxiliary to the VedasVedanta Society
because they were intended to facilitate
its use. These six were guides to proper
articulation and pronunciation (shik-
sha), metrical forms (chandas),
Sanskrit grammar (vyakarana), etymo-
logical explanations of archaic words
(nirukta), determining astrologically
appropriate
times
for
sacrifice
(jyotisha), and ritual and ceremonial
guides (kalpa).
Vedanta
The latest of the six schools in traditional
Hindu philosophy. The name Vedanta
literally means “the end of the Vedas,”
and reflects their contention that they
were revealing the ultimate meaning of
these sacred texts. Vedanta proponents
gave particular attention to the
Upanishads, which were also the latest
stratum of Vedic texts, and thus their
“end” in a different sense. These texts
have served as authoritative sources for
several major schools, with widely dif-
fering philosophical positions. The best
known and most important of these is
the Advaita Vedanta school, propounded
by the philosopher Shankaracharya
and his followers. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical position known
as monism, which is the belief in a single
impersonal Ultimate Reality that they
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,
reality is thus “nondual” (advaita)—that
is, all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and
diversity. For the Advaitins, this assump-
tion of diversity is a fundamental
misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things and a manifestation of
avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
which causes human beings to be
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarna-
tion (samsara), and suffering.
Whereas the Advaita school conceives
of this Ultimate Reality in abstract imper-
sonal terms, the other Vedanta schools
are theistic—that is, they conceive the
Ultimate Reality as a personal God,
namely the god Vishnu. The two other
major schools are the Vishishthadvaita
vedanta (“qualified nondualism”) pro-
pounded by Ramanuja and the Dvaita
Vedanta (“dualist”) propounded by
Madhva. The major differences between
these two schools stem from assump-
tions about connections between God,
human souls, and the world. Ramanuja
tends to see these in a continuum, with
the world and human souls sharing in
the divine nature, whereas Madhva
stresses the great gulf between God and
all other things. Another minor school is
the dvaitadvaita vedanta (“dualism and
nondualism”) of Nimbarka, which
strives to find some middle ground
between Advaita Vedanta’s monism, and
Dvaita Vedanta’s dualism. Nimbarka
stressed that the world and souls were
dependent on God, in whom they exist,
and with whom they had a subtle con-
nection. Even from their names, it is
obvious that there are significant differ-
ences between these positions.
Vedanta Deshika
(13th c.) Writer and commentator in the
Vishishthadvaita Vedanta philosophi-
cal school. Vedanta Deshika was a fol-
lower of Ramanuja and interpreted
Ramanuja as teaching that there were
two sorts of liberation: a lower one in
which one was subject to no outside
forces, and a higher one in which one’s
entire being was focused on the Lord,
whom Ramanuja identified as the god
Vishnu. The human being is considered
both identical to and different from the
Lord, which means the perfect identity
is never possible; God’s transcendence
leads to the exaltation of devotion
(bhakti) and the stress on submission to
God’s grace.
Vedanta Society
The oldest Hindu missionary organiza-
tion in America, established in 1897 by
Swami Vivekananda. The society stresses
the philosophical teachings of Vedanta,
which it understands as referring solely
[[745]]
Vedanta Sutras
to the Advaita Vedanta school,
Vivekananda’s major emphasis. The
society’s tone has been nontheistic,
nonritual, and rationalist; its con-
stituency has been drawn from liberals
and intellectuals, such as the writer
Aldous Huxley.
Vedanta Sutras
Text ascribed to the sage Badarayana in
the third to fifth century B.C.E. Along
with the Upanishads and the Bhagavad
Gita, the Vedanta Sutras is one of the
three traditional sources for the Vedanta
school, one of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy. The text
itself is a collection of 555 brief apho-
risms (sutras), which are so terse that
they presuppose a commentary. The
sutras focus particularly on the ideas
about Brahman, hence their other
common name, the Brahma Sutra. In
content, the first section describes the
nature of Absolute Reality, the second
responds to objections and criticizes
other positions, the third details
the means to acquire knowledge, and
the fourth describes the benefits of
such knowledge.
Vedarambha (“beginning of Veda
[study]”) Samskara
Traditionally, the twelfth of the life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras). In this
ceremony, a newly initiated brah-
macharin—a young man who had
entered the celibate student phase of
life—would commence to study the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
This rite is not mentioned in the earliest
texts in the dharma literature, perhaps
under the assumption that Veda study
would commence at an appropriate
time, after learning had commenced
with the earlier vidyarambha samskara.
Vegetarianism
A dietary practice that carries extremely
high status among Hindu people, prob-
ably because of its associations with
[[746]]

strict brahmin practice; even people
who are nonvegetarian themselves will
commonly think of a vegetarian diet as
“purer.” Strict vegetarians eat no flesh or
eggs, but milk and milk products are
always eaten and are considered pure
and health-giving, probably because
they come from the cow. Those people
who keep the strictest diets will also
often refrain from onions and garlic,
which are considered to excite the pas-
sions. This religious commitment to
vegetarianism by a certain part of the
population, and the general status given
to “pure” vegetarian food, are both
responsible for the great variety of vege-
tarian cooking found in Indian culture.
Despite the higher status given to a veg-
etarian diet, most modern Hindus are
not vegetarian—a recent poll of urban
Hindus found that only about 25 per-
cent were pure vegetarian, although the
number may be higher in villages, which
tend to be more traditional.
Vellala
The landlord community throughout
much of traditional Tamil Nadu.
Although technically the Vellalas were of
shudra status, their control over the
land gave them considerable influence
and prestige in the region. The Vellala
community was the source for many of
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
whose stress on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to the god Vishnu transformed
and revitalized Hindu religious life. Most
of the Alvars’ influence undoubtedly
stemmed from the strength of their reli-
gious devotion, but this was undoubtedly
reinforced by Vellala status as a land-
holding community.
Velur
Village in the Aurangabad district of the
state of Maharashtra, a few miles from
the cave temples at Ellora. Velur is
famous as the site for the temple to the
god Shiva in his form as Ghrneshvar,
the “Lord of Compassion.” Shiva is pre-
sent at this temple in the form of a linga,Veshara
the pillar-shaped image that is his
symbolic form, and the Ghrneshvar
linga is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a
network of sites deemed especially
sacred to Shiva, and at which Shiva is
uniquely present.
Vena
In Hindu mythology, a wicked king
who prohibits all religious rites and gift-
giving except those dedicated to him. He
is finally killed by a group of outraged
sages, who through their magic powers
transform blades of sacred kusha grass
into spears. After Vena has been killed,
the problem of the royal succession arises.
The sages first churn from his thigh a
small, malformed, dark-skinned man
named Nishada, who is believed to be
the ancestor of the tribal people known
as the Nishadas. Nishada takes upon
himself all Vena’s manifold sins, thus
purging them from Vena. After Vena has
been cleansed, the sages churn his right
hand, from which emerges a radiant and
shining boy, who is King Prthu.
India. People come to Tirupati from all
over the country, largely because of the
popular belief that any wish made in the
deity’s presence will invariably be granted.
Aside from significant monetary
offerings, it is also very common for pil-
grims to have their heads shaved, as a
sign of their visit and to make an offer-
ing of the hair, as well. In the time since
independence the temple’s wealth has
been administered by a trust, which has
been particularly attentive in fostering
publishing, educational institutions,
and in helping to build Hindu temples
outside India.
Venu
(“bamboo”) A bamboo flute, which is
an important instrument in Indian
classical music. In Hindu iconography,
it is the characteristic instrument of
the god Krishna, who used its sweet
sounds to summon his devotees
(bhakta) to him, to spend their
nights dancing on the shores of the
Yamuna River.
VenkateshvaraVenus
(“the Lord of Venkata [Hill]”) Presiding
deity of the Venkateshvara temple near
the town of Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh; the temple is north
and east of Madras. Venkateshvara is a
local deity who has been assimilated
into the larger pantheon as a form of the
god Vishnu. The temple is in the
Tirumalai hills, a cluster of seven hills
believed to represent the seven cobra
hoods of Shesha, the mythic serpent
who serves as Vishnu’s couch.
Venkateshvara’s image is unusual, in
that his forehead is covered with a plate.
The two branches of the Shrivaishnava
community, the Tengalais and the
Vadagalais, each wear distinctive sec-
tarian markings, and this plate conceals
these markings on the image and thus
allows both communities to claim him
as their own.
Venkateshvara is also famous for
having the single richest temple inIn Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with love and pleasure. It is
considered a strong planet, with pro-
nounced benevolent qualities, although
like all the other planets, its powers will
vary according to context. Venus pre-
sides over Friday, and its positive quali-
ties make this an auspicious day.
Veshara
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture,
the others being the Nagara and the
Dravida. The Veshara style is primarily
found in western India and the Deccan
and was the least significant and wide-
spread of the three styles. Whereas the
Nagara style was characterized by verti-
cal uplift achieved by a temple’s towers
(shikharas), and the Dravida style by
lower temples covering enormous tracts
of ground, the Veshara style’s most iden-
tifiable feature is a barrel roof above the
[[747]]
Vetala
A pilgrim in Benares wears vibhuti markings,
which consist of three horizontal lines and
identify him as a devotee of the god Shiva.
sanctuary, which has its roots in the
rock-cut caves (chaityas) first sculpted
by the Buddhists. This sort of roof is
midway between the Nagara towers and
the Dravida horizontal tiers, just as the
Deccan was the intermediate region
between the two.
Vetala
In Hindu mythology, one of the classes
of malevolent spirits that can be sub-
sumed under the general rubric of
demons. Vetalas are usually described as
eating human flesh and are sometimes
said to haunt battlefields to get their fill.
Vibhishana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Vibhishana is
the youngest brother of Ravana, the
demon king of Lanka. In their youth
Vibhishana, Ravana, and their third
brother, Kumbhakarna, have per-
formed harsh physical asceticism
(tapas) to gain boons from the gods.
Whereas his brothers have chosen
boons designed to advance their mili-
tary ability and glory, Vibhishana asks
[[748]]

that he remain righteous in times of
danger, and this quality marks his life.
When Ravana holds a council of war
preceding the battle with Rama’s
army, Vibhishana is the only one to
vote against battle and instead advises
Ravana to return Rama’s kidnapped
wife, Sita, and to beg Rama’s pardon.
For these words, Ravana expells his
brother from the city, and Vibhishana
goes over to Rama’s army, where he
fights valiantly throughout the war.
After the death of Ravana, Rama
crowns Vibhishana the king of Lanka,
as a reward for his fidelity and his
virtue. Vibhishana is a perfect example
of the fact that demons (in this case
the type of demons known as rak-
shasas) are not inherently evil in
Indian mythology. They are powerful
beings who may clash with gods and
men, but they have many virtues as
well. In the Ramcharitmanas, the ver-
nacular retelling of the Ramayana
written by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?), Vibhishana is portrayed
as a great devotee (bhakta) of Rama, in
keeping with the emphasis of Tulsidas
on the primacy of devotion over all
other forms of religious life.
Vibhuti
(“power”) Name for the sacred ash with
which devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva mark their bodies, usually with
three horizontal lines (tripundra).
According to one interpretation, the
three lines represent the three prongs of
Shiva’s trident, according to another,
they symbolize Shiva’s third eye. Ash is
associated with Shiva in several different
contexts. On one hand, he is said to
smear his body with ashes from the cre-
mation ground, which indicates his lack
of concern for all conventional distinc-
tions between purity and impurity
(ashaucha); the ash could also symbol-
ize Shiva’s destruction of Kama, the god
of love, who is burned to ash by Shiva’s
third eye. In earlier times vibhuti was
made from wood ash that had been sifted
through cloth until it was as fine asVidyadhara
talcum powder. This is still done today,
particularly by ascetics who usually use
the ash from a dhuni or smoldering
ascetic fire, which is believed to give the
ash a sacred quality; in modern times
vibhuti has become available in stores
that sell religious supplies.
Vichitravirya
In Hindu mythology, the son of
Satyavati and king Shantanu. Vichi-
travirya dies after his marriage to
Ambika and Ambalika, but before he
has fathered any children. In her desper-
ation to perpetuate King Shantanu’s lin-
eage, Satyavati calls on her eldest son,
Vyasa, to sleep with the two wives. From
this union Vyasa sires Pandu and
Dhrtarashtra, whose descendants form
the major warring factions in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Sanskrit epics.
Vicious Circle
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to be
avoided in constructing an argument. A
vicious circle occurs when a series of
things stand in a cause-and-effect rela-
tionship to one another, with any one of
them standing as both cause and effect.
For example, when “a” causes “b,” and
“b” causes “c,” (somewhere down the
line) “x” causes “a.” This is seen as an
extended case of self-residence—saying
that “a” is both cause and effect—and is
equally objectionable.
Vidhi
Philosophical concept that is found in
the Mahabharata and Ramayana, the
two great Sanskrit epics. As portrayed
there, vidhi is an impersonal force con-
trolling and constraining both the gods
and human beings; this notion corre-
sponds best to the idea of fate.
Vidura
In Hindu mythology, the son of the sage
Vyasa and the serving maid of Queen
Ambika. Ambika and her sister
Ambalika are the wives of King
Vichitravirya, who has died without
heirs. In a desperate attempt to save
the lineage, Vichitravirya’s mother,
Satyavati, summons her son, Vyasa, to
sleep with his brother’s two wives.
Ambika and Ambalika both sponta-
neously recoil from Vyasa, and each of
their sons is born with a defect:
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion; Ambika covers her
eyes,causing her son Dhrtarashtra to be
born blind. Ambika is so repulsed by
Vyasa’s appearance that when she is told
to sleep with him again, she sends her
serving maid instead. In contrast to the
two sisters, Ambika’s maid gives herself
willingly to Vyasa, and as a reward deliv-
ers a handsome son named Vidura.
According to one legend, Vidura is a
partial avatar of Dharma, the god who
is righteousness personified. Vidura
always shows his righteousness in his
dealings with the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the epic’s two warring fac-
tions. As the Kauravas become more and
more wicked, this inclines him more
toward the Pandavas, for whom he
serves as a trusted and faithful adviser. It
is Vidura who realizes the danger in the
House of Lac—a house built entirely of
highly flammable materials—and
makes arrangements for the Pandavas
to escape from it. During the Maha-
bharata war, he remains neutral, but
after the war is over he again serves as
an adviser to King Yudhishthira, the
eldest of the Pandavas, and to
Yudhishthira’s brothers.
Vidyadhara
(“wisdom-bearer”) Class of semidivine
beings. The Vidyadharas are generally
believed to live in the Himalayas
and are thus often associated with
the god Shiva, whose home is also said
to be there. Vidyadharas are generally
benevolent toward human beings and
are often (as their name suggests)
associated with bringing wisdom to
those they favor.

Vidyapati
Ruins of Vijayanagar, capital of the Vijayanagar dynasty.
Vidyapati
(ca. 1400) Brahmin court poet in the
Hindu kingdom of Mithila in northern
Bihar. Although Vidyapati wrote works
in Sanskrit, he is best known for his love
poetry, which was written in the vernac-
ular Maithali language. In this poetry he
drew on the literary traditions of
Sanskrit love poetry, but his favorite
subjects for this poetry were the divine
lovers Radha and Krishna. Although
later Vaishnavas considered Vidyapati’s
love poetry as devotional works,
Vidyapati’s own religious writings defin-
itively describe Shiva as the Supreme
Being, clearly showing that he was a
Shaiva. For further information see
Edward C. Dimock Jr. and Denise
Levertov (trans.), In Praise of Krishna,
[[1981]]
; and R. S. McGregor, The Love
Songs of Vidyapati, 1987.
Vidyarambha (“beginning of
study”) Samskara
Traditionally, the tenth of the life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), in which the
[[750]]

child begins formal education, usually
by starting to learn the alphabet.
Although people in modern India may
not perform this rite according to its
prescribed form (which includes mak-
ing offerings to a sacrificial fire and giv-
ing gifts to brahmins), families in which
education is taken seriously usually
have a ritualized commencement of
study, often when the child is as young
as three.
Vighneshvar
(“Lord of Obstacles”) Epithet of the god
Ganesh, reflecting the belief that he
wields control over all obstacles, and
thus can make things easy or hard on a
person. See Ganesh.
Vihara
An early architectural form, in which a
central courtyard was surrounded by a
series of small rooms. This was originally
a Buddhist architectural form, intended
to create a living space for the monks—
individual cells in the small rooms and aVijnaneshvara
common area in the large center space.
The design was adapted into the earliest
forms of the Hindu temples, such as
those at Aihole.of grain should be given to a brahmin.
As for results, faithfully observing this
festival is said to bring victory (vijaya)
over poverty and unhappiness.
VijayaVijayanagar Dynasty
In Hindu mythology, one of the gate-
keepers of Vaikuntha, who with his
brother Jaya, is cursed by the sage
Sanaka to be born three times as an
asura (demon), and to be killed each
time by Vishnu. In their first birth
Jaya and Vijaya incarnate as Hiran-
yaksha and Hiranyakashipu, who are
killed by the Boar avatar and the
Man-Lion avatar, respectively. In
their second they are born as Ravana
and Kumbhakarna, who are killed by
Rama. In their final birth they take
form as Shishupala and Dantavaktra,
who are killed by Krishna. After this
they return to their duties as Vishnu’s
gatekeepers.(“City of Victory”) The last of the great
southern Indian Hindu kingdoms,
which took its name from its capital city,
near modern Hampi in Karnataka. The
kingdom was founded in 1336 by
Harihara, a regional governor in the
Tughluq dynasty who broke away to
carve out a kingdom in the central
Deccan plateau. The kingdom went
through several periods of expansion
and decay. In the early fifteenth century
it controlled most of southern India, but
then passed through a period of decline
and loss of territory; this was followed by
renewal in the early sixteenth century,
during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya,
and finally ended after the battle of
Talikota in 1565, in which the ruling
prince Rama Raja was decisively defeated
by a coalition of the sultans from the
northern part of the Deccan. The city of
Vijayanagar was abandoned almost
immediately, and although it has suf-
fered the ravages of time, it still contains
stunning examples of late medieval
Hindu art and architecture.
Vijaya Dashami
(“victory tenth”) Another name for the
festival of Dussehra, which falls on the
tenth day of the lunar month. The festi-
val has two mythic charters, one with
the god Rama and one with the
Goddess, and both these myths point to
this as the day on which the deity wins a
definitive victory. See Dussehra.
Vijaya Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Phalgun (February–March). As for all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, which usually involve fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those performing this
vow should fill an earthen pot with the
seven kinds of grain, set an image of
Vishnu on the pot, and for twenty-four
hours, remain engaged in chanting the
names of Vishnu. On the twelfth the pot
Vijnaneshvara
(12th c.) Author of the Mitakshara , a
voluminous commentary on the Yaj-
navalkya Smrti, itself an example of the
dharma literature, or texts on religious
duty. This particular commentary
played a pivotal role in the British
administration of India. The British were
largely content to have their Indian sub-
jects governed by traditional religious
laws, but to do so, they needed an
accepted standard. For large sections of
British India, the Mitakshara was given
the status of traditional law and was
used as a legal code. The only major part
of India in which Hindus were not sub-
ject to this was in Bengal, where the legal
authority was the Dayabhaga. One of
[[751]]
Vikramaditya
the major differences between the two
was in matters of inheritance. The
Mitakshara stresses inheritance by
survivorship, in which only living males
can inherit property, whereas the
Dayabhaga stresses inheritance by suc-
cession, in which a dead man’s heirs can
inherit in his name.
Vikramaditya
(“Sun of Prowess”) Title taken by King
Chandra Gupta II (r. 376–415) as a symbol
of his royal mastery. This monarch is tradi-
tionally identified as the Vikramaditya
who established the Vikram era, but
because the Vikram era was established a
little less than sixty years before the com-
mon era, this claim is clearly untenable.
Vikram Era
One of the most common dating systems,
particularly in northern India. It is general-
ly believed that the Vikram era takes its
name from King Vikramaditya of Ujjain,
who is supposed to have ruled over much
of India. The Vikram era date is fifty-six or
fifty-seven years later than that of the com-
mon era; the discrepancy stems from the
differing first days of the year in the two
systems. In the common era the year
begins on January 1, but in the Vikram era
the year begins with the sun’s transition
into Aries, considered in India as occurring
on April 14. Hence, to convert a Vikram era
date to a common era date, one subtracts
fifty-six years for dates between January 1
and April 14, and fifty-seven years for dates
between April 15 and December 31.
Vikramorvashiya
(“Urvashi won by valor”) Drama written
by the poet Kalidasa, generally consid-
ered the greatest classical Sanskrit poet.
The Vikramorvashiya is a musical play in
five acts, whose mythic theme is the liai-
son of King Pururavas and the celestial
nymph Urvashi, a story mentioned both
in Rg Veda 1.95 and in the Shatapatha
Brahmana. In both these earlier sources
the story ends unhappily, with the separa-
tion of Urvashi and Pururavas, but in
[[752]]

Kalidasa’s version the estranged lovers are
finally happily reunited. This change may
have been prompted solely from the
desire for a happy ending, which is one of
the most characteristic features of
Sanskrit drama.
Village Deities
According to popular Hindu tradition,
the universe has 330 million gods. The
richness of this mythic imagination can
be seen in the composition of the Hindu
pantheon, in which hundreds of major
and minor deities have been given form,
identity, and mythic history. Yet aside
from these deities, who have been given
an identifiable form, there are also a
host of village deities found throughout
India. In most cases, the village deity is
exactly that—the deity who protects,
watches over, and acts as a divine over-
seer for a particular village or locale.
One of their most common functions is
to protect the village from disease, either
of people or livestock, and to provide
remedies when disease strikes. They are
also the guardians of the village, defend-
ing it from ghosts and unseen powers,
as well as protecting the villagers from
danger and misfortune.
The authority of these deities is gener-
ally quite limited—in most cases, it does
not extend beyond the village itself. In
most cases, village deities have no well-
defined mythic history, form, or person-
ality. At times they will have a temple
dedicated to them, but in other cases the
village deity is believed to be associated
with a particular tree or is represented by
a post in the village square. Village deities
are usually nonvegetarian, demanding
animal sacrifices and offerings of
blood in exchange for their services.
Relationships with these deities are highly
pragmatic—the villagers make offerings,
and the deities protect, but beyond
these offerings there is usually little
organized worship. If these deities have
any organized priesthood, it is almost
always non-brahmin because the impu-
rity (ashaucha) generated by animal sac-
rifices would be unacceptable toVina
brahmins. These priesthoods are inter-
mediaries between the deity and the vil-
lagers, usually communicating with the
deities through dreams or possession. In
this way the deities’ wishes become
known, and problems or concerns can
find their solution.
In some cases, local deities have gained
greater stature and have been assimilated
into the pantheon. For female deities, this
process is fairly simple, since they can be
brought into the pantheon by claiming
that their temples are one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess that spreads throughout the sub-
continent. Each Shakti Pitha marks the site
where a body part of the dismembered
goddess Sati fell to earth, taking form there
as a different goddess; all these individual
goddesses are thus seen as manifestations
of a single great Goddess. Male deities are
more commonly assimilated into the pan-
theon as manifestations of the god Vishnu,
and three prominent examples of the for-
mer are Jagannath, Vithoba, and
Venkateshvara. Village deities are less
commonly said to be forms of the god
Shiva, but this has happened with
Khandoba, an important regional deity in
the state of Maharashtra. See also pitha.
Vimana
(“vehicle”) A word with different specific
meanings in different contexts, a com-
mon feature in the Sanskrit language. It
can refer to the vehicles used by a
deity—either in a mythic sense, because
each of the deities has an animal con-
sidered to be his or her vehicle, or in a lit-
eral sense as the cart used to carry them
in procession, or to the human being
who “carries” them through becoming
possessed. In the context of architec-
ture, the word vimana is used to refer to
that part of the temple that “carries” the
deity, that is, the sanctuary as a whole.
Vimarsha
(“reflection”) In Hindu tantra, a secret,
ritually based religious practice, vimar-
sha is one of the bipolar opposites that
are used to characterize the nature of all
The vina is a classical Indian musical instrument.
reality, with its counterpart being illumi-
nation (prakasha). These two terms are
particularly important for the creation
of the world, which is said to happen
when the pure and radiant conscious-
ness (prakasha) of the ultimate
Brahman becomes self-conscious
through the reflection (vimarsha) of this
original consciousness. From one single
consciousness, the absolute then
evolves into a binary divinity—the god
Shiva and his consort Shakti—whose
continued interaction combines to
create the world. This dyad of prakasha-
vimarsha is particularly important in the
Trika school of Kashmiri Shaivism. For
further information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Vina
Multistringed musical instrument
with a long hollow body and a sound-
ing box at the bottom; the top has a
[[753]]
Vinata
large hollow gourd projecting from
the back, which further amplifies the
sound. The vina is one of the classical
musical instruments, particularly in
southern India, where its mastery is
still held in high regard. In Indian
iconography, the vina is most strongly
associated with the goddess Sara-
swati, in keeping with her identity as
the patron deity of the arts, culture,
and learning.
Vinata
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of
the divine sage Daksha, and the sister
of Kadru. Vinata gives birth to a line of
eagles—of whom the most famous is
Garuda—whereas Kadru gives birth to
a line of serpents. The proverbial
antipathy between these two kinds of
animals is described as stemming
from conflict between these two sis-
ters. One day the sisters get into an
argument about the tail color of a cer-
tain celestial horse, with Vinata argu-
ing that it is white, and Kadru
asserting that it is black. The disagree-
ment becomes more intense, until
they finally agree that the person who
is wrong will become a slave to the
other. To ensure her victory, Kadru
persuades a number of her children to
hang from the back of the horse, which
from a distance makes the tail appear
to be black. When Vinata sees the
black snakes, she accepts her defeat,
and for many years has to serve Kadru
under extremely harsh conditions. She
is finally rescued by her son, Garuda,
who when he discovers what has hap-
pened, embarks on a program of
killing snakes that has never abated.
Vinaya Patrika
(“letter of petition”) One of the later
poetic works by the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?), in the form of a
series of 280 short poems written in
the Braj Bhasha dialect. The entire
work is presented as a letter of petition
to Tulsidas’s chosen deity, Rama,
[[754]]

using as his intermediary the monkey-
god Hanuman. The letter’s general
theme is a plea for deliverance from
the evils of the current degenerate age
(kali yuga). The first sixty-odd verses
are a series of invocations paying
homage to various deities, showing
the ecumenical quality that more gen-
erally marks Tulsidas’s devotion. The
remainder of the poem is directed to
Rama and stresses other themes that
run throughout Tulsidas’s poetry. One
theme is the corrupted nature of the
present cosmic age, the kali yuga,
which makes devotion the only effec-
tive means to salvation. Another per-
vasive theme is the power of God’s
name and its incomparable ability to
rescue the devotee (bhakta). Finally,
there are warnings to the hearers not
to waste the opportunity of a human
birth. Much of the poetry has an inti-
mate personal quality, and it seems to
reflect both the poet’s despair at his
own frailty and his eventual hope for
salvation. From this general tone, the
Vinaya Patrika is generally assumed
to have been written in the later part
of the poet’s life, although it cannot be
precisely dated.
Vindhya Mountains
Mountain range running from east to
west in central India. Despite their
modest height, they have traditionally
served as the cultural dividing line
between northern and southern India.
The Vindhyas themselves were seen as
an uncivilized and potentially danger-
ous place, inhabited by ghosts,
demons, and tribal peoples; these
dangers were exemplified by the
untamed nature of its presiding god-
dess, Vindhyavasini.
Vindhyavasini
(“dweller in the Vindhyas”) Powerful
form of the great Goddess. The
Vindhyas are a mountain range in
central India that are difficult to
reach, inhabited by tribal peoples,Viparitakhyati
and seen as a place at the margins of
civilized society. As the goddess who
dwells in that place, Vindhyavasini is
equally marginal, often seen as a
fierce and dangerous deity who
demands blood sacrifices from her
devotees (bhakta). The mythology of
Vindhyavasini is associated with vari-
ous places in the Vindhyas, but for
centuries, her primary temple has
been in the village of Vindhyachal
near the city of Mirzapur in the state
of Uttar Pradesh, although she is
worshiped in other places in northern
India. One of her charter myths iden-
tifies her as the goddess (in infant
form) exchanged for the infant god
Krishna and killed by Krishna’s
wicked uncle, Kamsa. After taunting
Kamsa that the child he seeks has
already escaped, she flies off and
takes up residence in the Vindhyas.
Since other accounts identify this
goddess as Bhadrakali, this points to
the fluidity of the Hindu pantheon, in
which the renditions differ in the var-
ious accounts, according to the pur-
pose of the writers. For further
information see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986; and Cynthia
Humes, “The Goddess of the
Vindhyas in Banaras,” in Cynthia
Humes and Bradley R. Hertel, Living
Banaras, 1993.
Vipaksha
In Indian philosophy, one of the parts
in the accepted form of an inference
(anumana). The accepted form of an
inference has three parts: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three
have their own constituent parts. The
vipaksha is part of the third term, the
examples, and is a negative example
given to show that the claim made in
the initial assertion is one that reflects
the action of particular causes. For
example, in the inference, “there is
fire on the mountain because there is
smoke on the mountain,” the vipak-
sha could be “unlike a lake” since
lakes are places with neither fire nor
smoke, and thus shows that these
conditions are not universally present
(fire is found in mountains, but not in
lakes). By convention, an inference
also had to have a positive example,
the sapaksha, to show that similar
things happened in similar cases (i.e.,
that there were other cases in which
there was both fire and smoke).
Viparitakhyati
(“contrary discrimination”) Theory of
error propounded by the Mimamsa
philosopher Kumarila, who lived in the
seventh century C.E. All the theories of
error aim to explain why people make
errors in judgment, such as the stock
example of mistaking the silvery flash of
seashell for a piece of silver.
Like Prabhakara and the Naiya-
yikas, Kumarila believes that the sim-
ple judgments “that object is silvery”
and “silver is silvery” are both true
and indisputable. Kumarila also
agrees with the Naiyayika that the
error comes from a discrimination
that is contrary to reality. His differ-
ence with the Naiyayikas comes with
the latter’s postulation of the inher-
ence-relationship as connecting sub-
jects and predicates (“silver color”
and “silver”). Kumarila’s theory is
identity-and-difference (bhedabhada)
in which all things are what they are
and are not what they are not. Thus
the perception (pratyaksha) of the
shell on the beach would involve its
similarities and differences from sil-
veriness, combined with silver’s simi-
larities
and
differences
from
silveriness. One can combine the sim-
ilarities and get a false judgment, or
the differences and come up with a
true one. As in the Naiyayika theory of
error, the root cause for combining
the similarities rather than the differ-
ences comes from karmic dispositions
stemming from avidya, specifically
the greed for silver that prompts us to
look for such items of value. For fur-
ther information see Bijayananda Kar,

positions of India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Vira
(“hero”) In the context of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
the vira is one of the modes of ritual
expression. The tantric “hero” is said to
be one who not only partakes of the Five
Forbidden Things (panchamakara)—
wine, fish, meat, parched grain, and sex-
ual intercourse—in their elemental
forms, but also uses this inversion of
normal moral rules as a way to affirm
the ultimate unity of all things in the
universe. Aspirants adopting a heroic
mode will often worship a powerful but
dangerous deity, in which the ultimate
affirmation of this unity is to affirm one’s
identity with that deity. If one can do
this successfully, it is believed to confer
various powers, but if one fails it is said
to lead to illness, insanity, or death. This
is not a path without hazards, but
through it the heroes quickly attain their
desired goals.
Virabhadra
In Hindu mythology, a powerful being
who is created by the god Shiva to hum-
ble the demigod Daksha and to destroy
Daksha’s sacrifice. Daksha gives his
daughter, Sati, to marry Shiva, but later
he feels that Shiva has not shown him
proper respect. To humble Shiva,
Daksha plans a great sacrifice and
invites all the gods except Shiva. When
Sati asks her father why he has done so,
Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless
and despicable. Humiliated by these
public insults, Sati commits suicide—in
some versions, by leaping into the sacri-
ficial fire, and in others by withdrawing
into a yogic trance and giving up her life.
In the most common version of
Virabhadra’s creation, Shiva is so
enraged when he learns of Sati’s death
that he tears out two matted locks (jata)
from his head and dashes them to the
[[756]]

ground. One matted lock takes form as
Virabhadra, and the second takes form
as Bhadrakali, a powerful and terrifying
form of the Goddess. Just as Virabhadra
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,
Bhadrakali represents the ferocious and
dangerous side of the Goddess, in con-
trast with the gentle and loyal Sati. At
Shiva’s orders, the two demolish
Daksha’s sacrifice, scattering the guests
and destroying the sacred fires, until
Daksha finally repents and worships
Shiva as the supreme deity. Although
Virabhadra’s actions in this story are
destructive, he is and remains Shiva’s
servant, carrying out his divine master’s
commands, a mandate that ultimately
upholds the created order.
Viragal
(“Hero-stone”) Stone erected in memory
of a warrior, often the village headman,
who perished in battle while defending
the village cattle from pillage. Such
stones can be found all over the Deccan
region, and Deleury speculates that the
origins of the Maharashtrian god
Vithoba lay in such a deified hero, who
was later assimilated into the pantheon
as a form of Vishnu.
Viraha
(“separation”) Well-established poetic
genre in classical Sanskrit poetry and in
much of vernacular devotional (bhakti)
poetry. The genre focuses on describing
the pain resulting from the separation of
lover and beloved, whether the separat-
ed lovers are two human beings or devo-
tee (bhakta) and deity. Such separation
is believed to bring on specific physical
symptoms, which the poets describe in
detail—lack of appetite, insomnia,
inability to attend to daily life, or to
think about anyone but the beloved. The
sort of love felt in such separation is
believed to engender an even more
intense love for the beloved than love in
union because the latter is sweetened by
the presence of the beloved, whereas the
former has to stand by itself.Visarjana
Viramamunivar
Pseudonym of Father Constanzio Beschi
(1680–1747), an Italian Jesuit who lived
in Tamil Nadu for thirty-six years. Like
many of the other early Jesuits, Beschi
learned the local language and adopted
the local way of life. As part of his mis-
sionary work, he translated parts of the
Old and New Testament into literary
Tamil, and his facility with the language
and its poetic conventions make this
work a significant milestone in later
Tamil literature.
Viramitrodaya
One of the latest and the largest of the
nibandhas (“collections”), compiled in
the early seventeenth century by the
scholar Mitra Mishra. The nibandhas
were compendia of Hindu lore, in
which the compilers culled references
on a particular theme from the Vedas,
dharma literature, puranas, and other
authoritative religious texts, and then
compiled these excerpts into a single
volume. The Viramitrodaya is a massive
compendium of Hindu lore, each of
whose twenty-two sections is devoted to
a particular aspect of Hindu life, such as
daily practice, worship, gift-giving
(dana), vows, pilgrimage, penances
(prayashchitta), purification, death
rites (antyeshthi samskara), law, and so
forth, finally ending with liberation
(moksha). Aside from citing the relevant
scriptural passages, Mitra Mishra also
provides extensive learned commen-
tary, and his work became an important
source for later legal interpretation, par-
ticularly in eastern India.
Virasana
One of the sitting postures (asana)
described in commentaries to the Yoga
Sutras; this is also one of the sitting pos-
tures in which deities are portrayed in
Hindu iconography. As described in the
commentaries to the Yoga Sutras, in this
position one foot rests on the ground,
under the opposite thigh, while the
other foot rests on top of the opposite
knee. In modern yoga manuals this pos-
ture is described quite differently, as a
sitting posture with the legs folded back
outside the body, with the feet pressed
against the thighs and buttocks.
Virashaiva
(“Heroic Shaivas”) Another name for
the Lingayat religious community,
stemming from the Lingayat insistence
that the god Shiva was the only real god.
See Lingayat.
Virata
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Virata is the king
who shelters the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s protagonists, during the year
they spend incognito, following their
twelve years of exile in the forest. This
year is critical because according to the
agreement that the Pandavas have
made with their adversary, Duryodhana,
if they are discovered during this year
the cycle of exile and living incognito
will begin again. Due to Virata’s care
and foresight the Pandavas are not
discovered, even though Duryodhana
has sent legions of spies to find them.
During the Mahabharata war he con-
tinues to support the Pandavas and is
eventually killed by the archery
master Drona.
Visarjana
(“dismissing”) The sixteenth and last of
the traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the
devotee (bhakta) gives the deity leave to
go, as the concluding rite in worship.
Although the word dismissal sounds
presumptuous in any interaction with a
deity, this term really refers to the words
of parting that one would say to any
departing guest. The underlying motive
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show
one’s love for the deity and minister to
the deity’s needs.

Vishakhadatta
Vishakhadatta
(6th c.) Sanskrit dramatist whose
only surviving work is the play
Mudrarakshasa (“Rakshasa’s Ring”).
The play is of some historical interest,
for its major theme is the rise of
Chandragupta Maurya (r. 321–297
B.C.E.), founder of the Maurya dynasty,
although the play ascribes his success to
the machinations of his cunning brah-
min minister, Chanakya. The play
paints the king as a weak figure, with the
minister as the real power behind the
throne, although in fairness to the
historical king this portrayal seems
inaccurate. The drama’s plot is highly
complex, as with many Sanskrit plays,
but its climax comes when the principal
characters are dramatically rescued
from execution at the last moment.
The play has been translated into
English by Michael Coulson, and
published in an anthology titled Three
Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Vishishthadvaita (“Qualified Non-
Dualism”) Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school purporting to
reveal the ultimate meaning and pur-
pose (anta) of the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Vishishthadvaita’s greatest figure
is the eleventh-century philosopher,
Ramanuja, who was central to its for-
mation, although he was building on
earlier work. Ramanuja was convinced
that Brahman or Supreme Reality was a
personal deity, rather than an imper-
sonal abstract principle, and he was
also convinced that devotion (bhakti)
was the most important form of reli-
gious
practice.
Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions and
thus opposed the position of the
Advaita Vedanta school, founded by
the philosopher Shankaracharya.
The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief in a single
[[758]]

impersonal Ultimate Reality, which they
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,
reality is “nondual” (advaita)—that is,
all things are nothing but the formless
Brahman, despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity in the perceivable
world. For the Advaitins, this assump-
tion of diversity is a fundamental misun-
derstanding of the ultimate nature of
things and a manifestation of avidya.
Although often translated as “igno-
rance,” avidya is better understood as
the lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage, rein-
carnation (samsara), and suffering.
Since for the Advaitins the real problem
is this mistaken understanding, this
means that realization (jnana) was the
best spiritual path to gain final libera-
tion (moksha).
According to Ramanuja’s formula-
tion, the material world and selves have
real and independent existence,
although their existence is ultimately
rooted in God, whom he identifies as
Vishnu. The world comes from God in a
process of evolution adapted from the
Samkhya model, but since matter is
unconscious, it is both similar to and
different from God. In the same way,
human beings share similarity to God in
having God as their source, and differ-
ence from him in being subject to igno-
rance and suffering. For Ramanuja and
his followers, God is not identical to
Selves or the world, all of which are per-
ceived as having real and independent
existence. This doctrine of identity and
difference makes the perceivable world
real, in a sense that the Advaita propo-
nents would never admit. This same
contention of simultaneous identity and
difference distinguishes Ramanuja’s
position from that of a later thinker,
Madhva, whose Dvaita Vedanta stressed
the great gulf between God and all other
things. Given this difference in capaci-
ties between deity and devotee (bhakta),
Ramanuja and his followers have
stressed bhakti as the most efficacious
means to salvation. Even after liberation

from God to make devotion possible;
liberation is seen not as loss of identity,
but as eternal communion with God.

Vishnu
(“all-pervasive”) Along with Shiva and
the Goddess, one of the three most
important deities in the Hindu pan-
theon. All three of these are notable for
being almost unmentioned in the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts,
and the ascendancy of these three and
the gradual eclipse of the Vedic gods
points clearly to a definitive shift in
Hindu religious life. Of the three, Vishnu
has the most significant presence in the
Vedas. Many of the hymns in which he is
mentioned describe him as a helper to
the storm-god Indra, the primary Vedic
god, and one of Vishnu’s epithets here is
Upendra (“junior Indra”). Yet he also
appears in some of the late hymns as an
independent agent, who is associated
with marvelous deeds for the good of
the cosmos, such as taking three steps to
measure out the universe. Vishnu is also
associated with the sun, both in his abil-
ity to move through the heavens, and to
fall on (and thus “observe”) all things.
In the divine triad of Brahma-
Vishnu-Shiva, Vishnu is identified as the
sustainer or maintainer of the cosmos.
One manifestation of this can be seen in
a common creation myth, which begins
with Vishnu lying on the back of his ser-
pent couch, Shesha, in the primordial
ocean at the time of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). A lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s
navel, which opens to reveal Brahma,
the creator, who begins the work of cre-
ation. Vishnu presides over the creation,
and when the time for dissolution comes
again, the entire process reverses, and
the universe is drawn back into Vishnu,
who is thus seen as the source of all.
The other way that Vishnu sustains
the cosmos is through the action of his
avatars or incarnations, who come into
the world to restore balance to a uni-
verse dangerously out of equilibrium,
[[759]]
Vishnuchittar
usually because of a demon grown dis-
proportionately strong. There are ten
generally reckoned avatars. The first
four are in nonhuman forms: the Fish
avatar, Tortoise avatar, Boar avatar,
and Man-Lion avatar. The other six are
in human form, often as sages or heroes:
Vamana avatar, Parashuram avatar,
Rama avatar, Krishna avatar, Buddha
avatar, and Kalki avatar; the last has yet
to come. In each of these cases, Vishnu
takes form to avert some sort of disaster
and to maintain the integrity of the cos-
mos. The doctrine of the avatars provided
a mechanism to assimilate existing
deities into the larger pantheon and to
give them recognizable status of their
own. Although most of the avatars are
no longer objects of worship (the Boar
and Man-Lion avatars each had a sub-
stantial following early in the common
era), in much of northern India the wor-
ship of Rama and Krishna has largely
eclipsed that of Vishnu himself, who
has largely faded into the background.
In southern India, Vishnu is still
an important object of worship, particu-
larly in the Shrivaishnava community.
Aside from the doctrine of the avatars,
important local deities have also been
assimilated into the pantheon as forms
of Vishnu; the most significant
examples are Jagannath, Venkateshvara,
and Vithoba.
In medieval Hinduism sectarian
rivalry developed between Vaishnavas
and Shaivas, with each claiming that
their chosen deity (Vishnu and Shiva,
respectively) was supreme. Although
Vaishnavas see Vishnu as the supreme
power in the universe, his mythic char-
acter and activity differ sharply from
Shiva’s. Whereas Shiva is associated with
ascetic life and practices (tapas), and
thus with the religious power generated
by such practices, Vishnu’s headdress is
a crown, and his persona is that of an all-
ruling king. Whereas Shiva destroys his
mythic adversaries using raw power,
from which all subtlety is absent, Vishnu
more often triumphs through cunning,
cleverness, and trickery. Each deity’s
adherents affirm their divinity as the
[[760]]

preeminent power in the universe, from
which all the other gods gain their
power, and both are seen as gracious
and loving to their devotees (bhakta).
Vishnuchittar
An epithet of the Alvar poet-saint
Periyalvar. The Alvars were a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and
their stress on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil
language, transformed Hindu religious
life. See Periyalvar.
Vishnu Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
which were an important genre of smrti
texts, and the repository of much of tra-
ditional Indian mythology. The smrtis or
“remembered” texts were a class of liter-
ature that although deemed important,
were considered less authoritative than
the shrutis or “heard” texts. In brief, the
shrutis denoted the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts, whereas the smrtis included the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, the
dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
and the puranas. The puranas are com-
pendia of all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Most of the puranas are
highly sectarian, and as this one’s name
clearly shows, it is focused on the wor-
ship of Vishnu. It gives an exhaustive
account of Vishnu’s mythic deeds—
many of which have become the com-
mon mythic currency for many
traditional Hindus—as well as instruc-
tions for how, where, and when Vishnu
is to be worshiped.
Vishnuswami
(“[He whose] Lord is Vishnu”)
According to tradition, the founder of
the Rudra Sampraday of the VaishnavaVishva Hindu Parishad
ascetics. (The Rudra Sampraday is one
of the four branches, “sampraday,” of
the Bairagi Naga ascetics, who are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu; vaish-
nava refers to devotees of Vishnu.)
Vishnuswami was an ascetic, whom
some sources name as the guru of both
Jnaneshvar and Namdev. As his name
clearly shows, Vishnuswami was a
Vaishnava, although other than this lit-
tle is known about him. His ascetic line
and its position as one of the four
Vaishnava ascetic sampradays have
been appropriated by the followers of
Vallabhacharya, whose Shuddadvaita,
or “Pure Monism,” stresses the worship
of Krishna, with Radha as his consort.
Vishuddha Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret, ritually based religious practice
known as tantra, the vishuddha chakra
is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) believed to exist in the sub-
tle body. The subtle body is an alter-
nate physiological system, believed to
exist on a different plane than gross
matter, but with certain correspon-
dences to the material body. It is visu-
alized as a set of six psychic centers,
which are visualized as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along
the course of the spine, connected by
three vertical channels. Each of these
chakras has important symbolic asso-
ciations—with differing human capac-
ities, with different subtle elements
(tanmatras), and with different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet,
thus encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of Shiva (awareness)
and Shakti (power), the two divine
principles through which the entire
universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept of the subtle body is thus the
homology of macrocosm and micro-
cosm, an essential Hindu idea since
the time of the mystical texts known as
the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated from the bottom up, and the
vishuddha chakra is the fifth. It is visual-
ized as a sixteen-petaled lotus, located
in the region of the throat. The petals
each contain a seed syllable formed
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in
this case all sixteen of the Sanskrit vow-
els, the essential connecting elements
for any meaningful speech. On a sym-
bolic level, the vishuddha chakra is asso-
ciated with the human capacity for
speech and respiration. It is also identi-
fied as the bodily seat for the subtle ele-
ment of space (akasha), through which
hearing is believed to take place. For fur-
ther information see Arthur Avalon (Sir
John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; and Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973.
Vishva Hindu Parishad
(“World Hindu Organization,” hereafter
VHP) Modern Hindu religious organiza-
tion affiliated with the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a conserva-
tive Hindu organization whose express
purpose is to provide the leadership
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The
VHP was formed in 1964, when RSS leader
Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar met in
Bombay with a group of Hindu religious
leaders. Their immediate concern was
the upcoming visit of Pope Paul VI to
India, which they interpreted as a con-
cealed attempt to convert Hindus to
Christianity, and resolved to oppose by
forming an organization dedicated to
the propagation of Hinduism. For the
next fifteen years, the VHP focused its
attention on countering Christian mis-
sionary efforts in northeastern India,
with little fanfare and little impact on
the public consciousness.
A watershed in the VHP’s public image
came in 1982, following the conversion
of some untouchables to Islam in the
Tamil Nadu village of Minakshipuram.
The VHP used this much-publicized
event as evidence that Hindu identity
was endangered and countered it by
launching a series of innovative public
[[761]]
Vishvakarma
actions, first in Tamil Nadu, but later
extending throughout the entire nation.
The VHP’s renewed activity corresponded
with a more activist bent in its parent
organization, the RSS, as well as the deci-
sion by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
a political organization that is also an RSS
affiliate, to assume a more militantly
Hindu identity. Many of the VHP’s
national campaigns coincided with
national or state elections, and many of
these centered on the campaign to build
a temple to the god Rama in the city of
Ayodhya, at the site claimed to be
Rama’s birthplace. The site on which
they proposed to build the temple was
occupied by a Muslim mosque, the
Babri Masjid, which the VHP claimed
had been built only after tearing down
the original Rama temple. This temple
campaign thus carried powerful images
of past oppression, as well as the
assertiveness of a renascent Hindu iden-
tity. The VHP’s activism has enormously
boosted the BJP’s political fortunes, and
helped make it the dominant political
party through much of northern India.
The VHP’s activism has generated
sharply contrasting emotions through-
out India. Proponents point to its long
record of social service and its role in
helping strengthen and define a mod-
ern Hindu identity. Detractors point to
its disregard for the niceties of law,
which was epitomized by the destruc-
tion of the Babri Masjid in December
[[1992]]
, its often vitriolic anti-Muslim
rhetoric, and its ultimate control by the
RSS, despite its separate institutional
identity. Other critics have censured
the VHP for attempting to declare cer-
tain “required” Hindu rites as antitheti-
cal to the Hindu tradition and for
attempting to define and control the
nature of “Hinduism.” Other critics
question the organization’s claim to
speak for all Hindus, noting that its real
power lies in the hands of brahmins and
other privileged classes; these critics see
the VHP as an organization designed to
conceal its true purpose, the mainte-
nance of upper-class influence and priv-
ilege. For further information see Walter

Vishvakarma
(“doing all things”) A minor deity whose
mythic roles include being the architect
of the gods; creator of innumerable
handicrafts, ornaments, and weapons;
the finest sculptor; and the inventor of
the aerial chariots used by the gods. He
is the patron and paradigm for all the
skilled crafts in which materials are
shaped and formed, and in particular he
is said to have fixed the canons for carv-
ing images of the gods. According to one
story, Vishvakarma’s daughter, Sanjna,
is married to Surya, the sun, but
because of the sun’s radiance cannot
bear to be with him. Vishvakarma takes
the sun to his workshop and trims off
enough of his effulgence so that Sanjna
can bear his brightness. He then shapes
the cut-off pieces of the sun into the
god Vishnu’s discus (Sudarshana), the
god Shiva’s trident (trishul), various
other divine weapons, and the Pushpak
Viman, the most famous of the
aerial chariots.
Vishvakarma is sometimes identified
with Tvashtr, the workman of the gods
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Yet it seems that these are two dif-
ferent deities, homologized to each
other through their common function.
Tvashtr’s name means “builder of car-
riages,” and this seems to have been his
primary function, although he is also
noted for crafting the weapons of the
gods, especially the mace with which
the storm-god Indra slays the serpent
Vrtra. Still, his name seems to indi-
cate that his major function is in
building carriages, which is believed
to be highly significant in a Vedic con-
text, since many Vedic hymns mentionVishvanath
the use of military chariots. Vishvakarma,
on the other hand, has much more
wide-ranging skills, and this would
seem to indicate that the two are not the
same deity.
Vishvamitra
In Hindu mythology, one of the Seven
Sages whose names mark exogamous
clan “lineages” (gotra; in exogamous
clans, members marry outside their own
clan); the others are Gautama,
Bharadvaja, Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Atri,
and Vasishtha. All brahmins are
believed to be descended from these
seven sages, with each family taking the
name of its progenitor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra divisions
are still important because marriage
within the gotra is forbidden. After her
marriage, the new bride adopts her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
Vishvamitra is most famous for his
long-standing feud with the sage
Vasishtha, which causes numerous con-
frontations. The feud begins as a result
of the difference in status between ksha-
triyas and brahmins. Vishvamitra is a
king, who once stops with a host of
retainers at the forest ashram of the
brahmin Vasishtha. Upon asking for
food, Vishvamitra is amazed at the
ability of Vasishtha’s cow, the Kama-
dhenu, to provide food for everyone.
Vishvamitra first tries to buy the
Kamadhenu, then tries to take it by
force, but his minions are defeated by
the magic powers generated by
Vasishtha’s tapas (ascetic practices).
Vishvamitra finally admits defeat and
begins to do ascetic practices to gener-
ate power of his own. Two of their most
celebrated clashes are over King
Trishanku and his son, Harishchandra;
in each case the real issue is the mutual
antipathy of these two sages. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Vishvanath
Form of the god Shiva, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of the Universe” at the
Vishvanath Temple
Vishvanath temple in Benares. Shiva is
present at Vishvanath in the form of a
linga, the pillar-shaped image that is his
symbolic form; the Vishvanath linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva, and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. Benares, or Varanasi, is one of
the most sacred cities in India; it is
considered particularly sacred to Shiva,
and of all the Shiva temples there,
Vishvanath is the most important. The
original temple was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, who built
a mosque on the site, and the only
remaining part of the original temple is
the Gyan Vapi (“well of knowledge”),
into which the original Shiva linga was
reportedly cast (to save it from desecra-
tion by Aurangzeb’s soldiers). The pre-
sent temple was built in 1776 by the
Maratha queen Ahalya Bai Holkar, on a
site adjoining the original temple. It was
later roofed with gold by Maharaja
Ranjit Singh of Lahore, and thus one of
its nicknames is the “Golden Temple.”
Even in preceding centuries the his-
tory and proximity of the Vishvanath
[[763]]

temple and Aurangzeb’s mosque made
for delicate relations between the Hindu
and Muslim communities, and like
many northern Indian cities Benares has
seen its share of bloodshed between
these two communities. In recent times
the destruction of the original Vishvanath
temple has been taken up as a political
issue by the Vishva Hindu Parishad
(VHP), a Hindu activist organization
calling for the “return” of this and other
northern Indian sites by force if neces-
sary. The VHP’s presence and activity have
significantly escalated tensions between
Hindus and Muslims as a whole. Given
the political gains that these confronta-
tional strategies have brought, it seems
likely that they will continue in the future
and that the Vishvanath temple will be a
site connected with conflict.
Vishva Nirmala Dharam
Religious organization founded by the
modern Hindu teacher Nirmala Devi
(b. 1923), to propagate her teachings
throughout the world.
[[764]]

Vishvedevas
This name can either be construed as
referring to all the gods, based on the
term’s literal meaning (“all the gods”), or
it can refer to a group of deities reck-
oned as the sons of Vishva, the daugh-
ter of the divine sage Daksha. The
number of sons differs according to dif-
ferent texts and is reckoned at either ten
or thirteen. The Vishvedevas are espe-
cially worshiped at the memorial rites
for the dead known as shraddhas,
although the Manu Smrti, one of the
authoritative texts in the dharma litera-
ture, prescribes offerings to them every
day. These prescribed daily offerings are
said to have been their reward for hav-
ing performed particularly harsh asceti-
cism (tapas).
Vismaya (“surprise”) Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the forearm and the fingers are
pointing upward, with the back of the
hand turned toward the viewer. ThisVitthala
particular hasta is meant to convey
any sort of surprise, including wonder
and astonishment.
Vital Winds
General term to designate the five inter-
nal winds collectively known as prana,
through which all human physiological
processes are believed to occur.
Vithoba
Presiding deity of the temple with the
same name in the city of Pandharpur in
the state of Maharashtra; other epithets
for Vithoba include Vitthala and
Pandurang. Vithoba was originally a
local deity—according to some theories,
a deified hero—who has been assimilated
into the larger Hindu pantheon as a
form of the god Vishnu. According to
the temple’s charter myth, Vishnu
comes to Pandharpur drawn by the filial
devotion of a young boy named
Pundalika. When Vishnu arrives
Pundalika is massaging his father’s feet,
and when Vishnu asks for the hospitality
due to any guest, Pundalika stops only
long enough to throw a brick over his
shoulder, to give the god a place to stand
out of the mud. Impressed that
Pundalika’s devotion to his parents
supersedes even his devotion to God,
Vishnu becomes rooted to that spot and
has remained there ever since; Vithoba’s
image shows him with his hands on his
hips (still waiting, perhaps, for
Pundalika). Aside from this story,
Vithoba has surprisingly little mythic
history, although he has become an
important regional deity.
Vithoba is most famous for the activ-
ities of his devotees (bhakta), the
Varkari Panth religious community,
who make pilgrimages to Pandharpur
twice a year. Pandharpur sits in the
Bhima River valley on the edge of the
Maharashtra-Karnataka border, and
pilgrims come from all directions.
Individual pilgrims travel in small
groups called dindis, often made up of
people from the same neighborhood or
locality. The dindis are organized into
larger groups known as palkhis, each of
which is associated with one of the
Varkari poet-saints, and which is led by
a palanquin (palkhi) bearing the san-
dals of that saint. Each palkhi departs
from a place associated with its particu-
lar saint—for example, the palkhi of
Jnaneshvar leaves from the town of
Alandi in which he lived, and thus he
and all the other saints are still symboli-
cally journeying to Pandharpur twice a
year. Each of these palkhis travels a pre-
scribed route, and pilgrims time their
departure and their travel to arrive in
Pandharpur on the same day—the
eleventh day (ekadashi) in the bright
half of Ashadh (June–July) in the sum-
mer, and the eleventh day in the bright
half of Kartik (October–November) in
the fall. Pilgrims compare their journey
to that of a small stream merging with
other streams, gradually forming a
mighty river converging on Pandharpur.
During their journey pilgrims sing
the devotional songs composed by
these poet-saints, among them
Jnaneshvar, Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram,
Chokamela, Gora, Janabai, and Bahina
Bai. In this way, the pilgrims are emulat-
ing the saints before them, both by
treading in their physical footsteps and
by singing their songs of devotion.
Although the pilgrimage ends with the
entry to Pandharpur and the worship of
Vithoba, the most important part is the
journey itself. For more information on
Vithoba and the Varkari sect, see G. A.

Studies, Vol. 22 No. 1, 1962; and

Vitthala
Common epithet of Vithoba, the presid-
ing deity of a famous temple at
Pandharpur in the state of Maharashtra.
The name Vitthala is a more literary
form, and according to Deleury, the old-
est attested name for the Pandharpur
deity. See Vithoba.
[[765]]
Vitthalnath
VitthalnathVivarana Advaita
(r. 1566–1585) Second guru of the
Pushti Marg (a religious community),
which was founded by his father,
Vallabhacharya. Vitthalnath continued
the consolidation of the Pushti Marg, in
particular the organization of its rites,
and in fostering the composition of
songs and poetry to accompany them.
According to tradition, the eight poets
known as the ashtachap were all active
during his tenure, although four of them
are more closely associated with his
father. The four poets associated with
Vitthalnath were clearly members of the
Pushti Marg, for among their poetry can
be found hymns praising him and his
leadership. He was succeeded by his son
Gokulnath, under whose direction the
lives of these and other saints were final-
ly written down, with each being given a
Vallabhite emphasis.One of the later schools of Advaita
Vedanta, a philosophical school, the great-
est figure in which was Shankaracharya.
The Advaita school upholds a philosophi-
cal position known as monism, which is
the belief in a single impersonal Ultimate
Reality, which they call Brahman. For
Advaita proponents, reality is “nondual”
(advaita)—that is, all things are nothing
but the formless Brahman, despite the
appearance of difference and diversity in
the perceivable world. For the Advaitins,
this assumption of diversity is a funda-
mental misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things and a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage,
reincarnation (samsara), and suffering.
Because the real problem for the
Advaitins is this mistaken understanding,
this means that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path to gain final
liberation (moksha).
The Vivarana Advaita school is based
on the thought of Padmapada (9th c.),
one of Shankaracharya’s disciples,
but takes its name from a commentary
written by the thirteenth-century
Prakashatman. The latter is traditionally
a disciple of Padmapada’s, but this seems
problematic. As with the Bhamati
school, the Vivarana school took defini-
tive stands on several points on which
Shankaracharya had remained silent.
One of these was on the locus of igno-
rance, which the Vivarana school
describes as being located in Brahman.
In explaining how this can be, since it
seems to compromise the integrity of
Brahman, the Vivarana Advaitins invoke
the theory of reflectionism to explain the
apparent difference between Brahman
and the Self, although, in fact, the Selves
are identical with Brahman. Their posi-
tion seems based more than anything on
an uncompromising affirmation of
Brahman as the sole “reality,” in which
anything that exists must belong to it.
Vivaha (“uplift”) Samskara
Traditionally, the fifteenth of the life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
a man and woman became husband
and wife. Except for those rare individu-
als who remained lifelong celibates
(naisthika brahmacharin), marriage
was an essential element in the life
of every man (and woman), since the
children procreated through marriage
allowed him to retire one of the three
debts, this one to the ancestral spirits
(pitr). One mark of the importance given
to marriage can be seen in the literal
translation of the word vivaha—it
signifies that by which a man is
“uplifted” and made complete. Given
the stress on family in Indian society,
marriage has also been a gravely
important matter, and for many
Indians, it remains the most important
day of their life. The dharma
literature underlines the importance of
marriage by cataloging eight different
forms. See also marriage, eight
classical forms.
[[766]]
Vivekananda, Swami
Vivartavada
A philosophical model used to explain
the relationship between the Ultimate
Reality or Realities and the perceivable
world; this model describes the world as
an illusory transformation of this reality.
The vivartavada model is unique to the
Advaita Vedanta philosophical school.
The Advaitins are proponents of a
causal model called satkaryavada,
which assumes that effects already exist
in their causes, and that when these
effects appear, they represent transfor-
mations (parinama) of those causes. The
classic example is the transformation of
milk to curds, butter, and clarified but-
ter. According to asatkarya’s proponents,
each of these effects was already present
in the cause and emerges from it through
a natural transformation of that cause.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality lies behind all things and that all
things are merely differing forms of that
reality. Advaita proponents exemplify this
belief in their claim that reality is nondual
(advaita)—that is, that all things are “actu-
ally” nothing but the formless, unqualified
Brahman, despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity in the world. The
Advaitins’ belief that an effect already
exists in its cause comes from the princi-
ple that all things in the universe ultimate-
ly depend on Brahman as a first cause. At
the same time the Advaitins are unwilling
to admit that Brahman ever undergoes
actual change because this would nullify
its eternal and unchanging nature. For this
reason, they speak of an illusory transfor-
mation (vivartavada). For the Advaitins,
Brahman never really changes, because it
is eternal and thus unchanging; the
apparent changes are only illusory, based
on human ignorance through changing
patterns of superimposition (adhyasa). In
this way the Advaitins can maintain the
transcendence of Brahman and at the
same time account for the (apparent)
changes in the phenomenal world.
This position is contested by propo-
nents of another model, which describes
the perceivable world as an actual trans-
formation of this single reality. This posi-
tion is espoused by proponents of the
Samkhya, Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, and
Bhedabhada philosophical schools, who
like the Advaitins are also proponents of
satkaryavada. Each of these three schools
believes that the world as perceived is real,
that it has some single ultimate source
behind it, and that this first principle
undergoes a real transformation by which
the world comes into being. This parina-
ma relationship allows these schools to
explain the phenomenal world but in a
way that compromises the transcendence
of these first principles by making them
part of the world. Philosophically, their
difficulties come in describing how the
transcendent can become mundane, and
then become transcendent again.

Vivekananda, Swami
(b. Narendranath Datta 1863–1902) Best-
known disciple of the Bengali mystic
Ramakrishna and also the first Hindu
missionary to the West. Narendranath had
received a good education and had origi-
nally intended to be a lawyer; on meeting
Ramakrishna he was initially skeptical and
questioning but in the course of a year
became transformed. After Ramakrishna’s
death he spent several years roaming
through India, gradually coming to the
conclusion that religious life had to
address India’s material needs as well as its
spiritual ones. Vivekananda is most
famous for his address to the First World
Parliament of Religions in Chicago in
[[1893]]
, in which Hinduism—in its rational,
Vedantic form—was first seriously
received by his Western hearers. For the
next four years, he lectured in America
and in England and returned to India to
widespread acclaim. He devoted the rest
of his short life to fostering the
Ramakrishna Mission, a religious organi-
zation intended to promote social uplift as

well as religious education. For further

M. Williams, “Swami Vivekananda,” and

Religious Change,” both in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Vraj
Variant form of the region known as
Braj. This is the land in which the
god Krishna is believed to have lived,
located in the southwestern part of the
state of Uttar Pradesh just south of
Delhi, the national capital. See Braj.
Vrat
Term denoting a religious vow, usually
thought to be derived from the verb
meaning “to choose.” As religious obser-
vances, vrats are an important part of
modern Hindu life. They may refer to
religious practices performed once a
year with particular festivals, such as the
vrat performed on Shivaratri, or to
more regular religious observances,
such as those connected to the monthly
lunar calendar (e.g., the ekadashi rites)
or those performed on the day of the
week associated with a particular patron
deity. The specific prescriptions for
these vrats vary widely, but there are
several common features. They usually
involve modification of diet—some-
times through fasting (upavasa), and
other times by eating or avoiding cer-
tain types of food. Another constant fea-
ture is worship of the presiding deity.
Part of this worship usually involves
reading or hearing the vrat’s charter
myth, which tells how the vrat was
established, how one should perform it,
and what sort of benefits it brings. Vrats
connected with festivals are performed
by all sorts of people, but weekly vrats
(such as the Santoshi Ma Vrat) are most
often performed by married women to
promote the health, safety, and prosper-
ity of their families. Although such
[[768]]

weekly vrats are theoretically voluntary,
they have become an expected element
in women’s religious life, through which
women by their sacrifices can safeguard
their family’s welfare. For further con-
sideration of women’s rites, see Mary
McGee, “Desired Fruits: Motive And
Intention in the Votive Rites of Hindu
Women,” in Julia Leslie, ed., Roles and
Rituals for Hindu Women, 1991; and
Doranne Jacobson and Susan S. Wadley,
Women in India, 1992.
Vratya
In the Atharva Veda, one of the earliest
Hindu religious texts, the vratyas were a
particular class of vagrant ascetics who
were priests of a non-Vedic fertility cult.
Not much is known about them because
there are no other sources, but they were
clearly outside the Vedic cult and thus
looked down upon. In later times, the
word is used to designate a person who
has lost caste through nonobservance of
one of the necessary samskaras (life-
cycle ceremonies).
Vrindavan
Variant form of Brindavan, the village in
southeastern part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh in which the god Krishna is
believed to have lived from infancy to
adolescence. See Brindavan.
Vrtra
(“obstruction”) The name of the demon
killed by the storm-god Indra in one of the
hymns from the Rg Veda (1.32), the oldest
Hindu religious text. In this hymn Vrtra is
described as a serpent obstructing the free
flow of waters, hence his name. The action
in this hymn is one of Indra’s defining
deeds, in which he destroys the serpent,
cuts it into pieces, and releases the waters
to run free. Some interpreters inclined to
read the Vedas as historical record have
seen in this hymn the breaching of the
dams constructed by the Indus Valley civ-
ilization by the incoming Aryans, but
there is little proof that such an incident
ever happened.Vyas
Vyakarana
(“analysis”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the auxiliary branches of
knowledge connected with the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, and all
the Vedangas were associated with the
use of the Vedas. In its essence,
vyakarana is the study of Sanskrit gram-
mar, which was obviously essential to
understanding the Vedic texts (which
were written in Sanskrit). Vyakarana’s
role as the gatekeeper to the Sanskrit
language made grammar the queen
of the traditional learned sciences,
and in many contexts it is what is
meant by the term vidya (“knowledge”).
Aside from vyakarana, the other
Vedangas are shiksha (correct pronun-
ciation), chandas (Sanskrit prosody),
kalpa (ritual instructions), nirukta
(etymology), and jyotisha (auspicious
times for sacrifices).
Vyakhyana (“teaching”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended, and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the hand
gesture used to signify explanation or
exposition; for this reason, it is also
known as the sandarshana (“exposit-
ing”) mudra. Since the teaching gesture
indicates a person of higher spiritual
attainment, it is also known as the chin
(“consciousness”) mudra.
Vyana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily “winds” considered to be
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, udana,
and samana. Unlike all the others,
which are given specific locations in the
body, the vyana wind is believed to per-
vade throughout the body, to keep
things moving and mixed together.

Vyapti
(“pervasion”) In classical Indian philos-
ophy, vyapti is the key condition deter-
mining the validity of an inference
(anumana). The accepted form of an
inference has three terms: An assertion
(pratijna) containing the thing to be
proved, a reason (hetu) containing
evidence to support the assertion, and
supporting examples (drshtanta). In
the stock example “there is fire on
the mountain, because there is smoke
on the mountain,” the assertion is
that there is fire, and the reason is that
there is smoke—with the underlying
assumption that smoke invariably
accompanies fire. In a valid inference,
the reason accounts for every case of
the thing to be proven; vyapti, or perva-
sion, is the term for this invariable
association between cause and effect.

Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Vyas
In the traditional Ram Lila (name given
to any public dramatic presentation of
the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics), vyas is the name
[[769]]
Vyasa
given to the stage directors. The
Ramnagar Ram Lila is the longest, most
elaborate, and arguably the oldest of
these dramas. In the Ramnagar Ram
Lila, one vyas is responsible for the
svarups, the brahmin boys who are
playing the parts of the divinities, and
who are considered manifestations of
the deities when they are “in character.”
The other vyas is responsible for the rest
of the cast. Between them they shift
the action between chorus and cast, give
the actors minute directions for their
acting, and prompt them when they
forget their lines. As such, they are visi-
ble agents themselves and an important
part of the Ram Lila.
Vyasa
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is tradi-
tionally considered to be the author of
the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Sanskrit epics. Vyasa is the son of
the sage Parashara as a result of his dal-
liance with the ferrywoman Satyavati.
Later in life Satyavati marries King
Shantanu but only after extracting the
promise that their children will rule,
instead of Shantanu’s eldest son,
Bhishma. Satyavati’s first son dies in
childhood, and the second dies after his
marriage but before having any chil-
dren. In her desperation to preserve
Shantanu’s line, Satyavati calls on Vyasa
to sleep with her younger son’s wives,
Ambika and Ambalika. According to
tradition Vyasa is very ugly, and both of
the women involuntarily react when
Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambalika
turns pale, causing her son, Pandu, to be
born with an unnaturally pale complex-
ion, and Ambika covers her eyes, caus-
ing her son, Dhrtarashtra, to be born
blind. Vyasa also has sexual relations
with Ambika’s maidservant, who gives
herself to him willingly, and from her is
born Vidura. The descendants of Pandu
and Dhrtarashtra are the Pandavas and
Kauravas, respectively, who are the two
[[770]]

warring factions whose enmity drives
the Mahabharata. Thus Vyasa is not only
the author of the Mahabharata, but also
the source of the two families whose
struggle is described in it.White Yajur Veda

Water
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, fire, wind, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the ele-
ments is paired with one of the senses;
here water is associated with taste.
Within the body, water is also associated
with certain bodily functions, especially
reproduction (involving the mixing of
fluids) and the elimination of fluid
wastes.
Wednesday
(Budhvar) The fourth day of the week,
the presiding planet of which is
Mercury (Budh). Although not inauspi-
cious, the day has few strong associa-
tions and is not linked to the worship of
any major deity. The planet Mercury is
seen as an auspicious but weak planet,
based on its small size and its quick
rotation around the sun.
Week, Structure of
The Hindu week has seven days, just
like the European calendar. Each of the
days has a presiding planet, is associat-
ed with one or more presiding deities,
and (in keeping with the general Indian
attitude toward time) is deemed more
or less auspicious. The most unlucky
days are Tuesday and Saturday, associ-
ated respectively with the planets Mars
and Saturn. Monday (the moon),
Thursday (Jupiter), and Friday (Venus)
are usually regarded as auspicious days
since these are judged to be benevolent
and powerful planets. Sunday (the sun)
and Wednesday (Mercury) have no
strong associations, because although
these bodies are seen as benevolent,
they are also seen as relatively weak in
their influence.
West Bengal
Modern Indian state. It was formed after
Indian independence in 1947, after the
partition of the state of Bengal into West
Bengal and West Pakistan, the latter now
known as Bangladesh. Most of the state
lies in the lowland of the Ganges River
delta, although in the north, Darjeeling
extends into the Himalayas. West
Bengal’s capital, Calcutta, was the
administrative center of British India
until the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury. It was also a hotbed of anti-British
resistance and has remained one
of India’s great artistic and intellectual
centers. West Bengal has a number
of important religious sites: Kalighat, in
the heart of Calcutta, and Dakshi-
neshwar, Tarakeshvar, Tarapith, and
Navadvip. For general information
about West Bengal and all the regions of
India, an accessible reference is
Christine Nivin et al., India, 8th ed.,
Lonely Planet, 1998.
West Indies
A cluster of Caribbean islands with a sig-
nificant Hindu diaspora population. As
in many other cases, they were originally
brought to the West Indies as indentured
agricultural laborers, particularly on
the sugar plantations, but have now
lived there so long that they have
become a part of the local community.
On some of the islands, particularly
Trinidad, Hindus have constructed
temples and established sacred
sites (tirthas) there, as a way of con-
necting their religious lives to their
local environment.
White Yajur Veda
Along with the Black Yajur Veda, this is
one of the two major forms of the Yajur
Veda, one of the oldest Hindu religious
texts. The major difference between
these two forms comes from the
[[771]]
Widows

differing placement of explanatory
notes on the Vedic mantras and their sig-
nificance. The “White” Yajur Veda gathers
these notes into an appendix known as a
Brahmana—namely, the Shatapatha
Brahmana, which gives its name to
the second major stratum of Vedic texts.
In contrast, the four recensions of the
Black Yajur Veda include these notes in the
text itself.
Widows
Given the traditional assumption that a
Hindu woman’s central role is as a wife
and mother, becoming a widow is
deemed the worst fate that can befall a
woman and is seen as the karmic
fruition of some ghastly former deed.
Because the underlying assumption of
the marriage ceremony is that the
bride’s identity becomes assimilated to
the groom’s, a woman without a
husband was seen as having lost her
identity. Furthermore, because she had
already taken on her dead husband’s
identity, remarriage was not an option
for her. Immediately after her husband’s
death a woman was supposed to remove
[[772]]

all the symbols of a married woman—
rubbing the red vermilion from the part
in her hair, breaking her glass bangles,
and in southern India, cutting the
thread on her mangal sutra. For the rest
of her life, she was forbidden to wear
jewelry, colored clothing, or other bodily
adornments, was supposed to keep her
hair cropped short, and was supposed
to devote herself to religious acts for the
benefit of her dead husband. Because
she had been widowed, she was also
considered an unlucky and inauspicious
person, banned from any and all auspi-
cious events, living out her life doing the
drudge work in the household. In cer-
tain parts of India, it was common prac-
tice to burn a widow on her husband’s
funeral pyre, a rite known as sati,
although there were many other regions
in which this practice was unheard of.
In real life, there was considerable
variation on this grim picture. The most
significant factors were a woman’s age at
the time she was widowed, whether she
had children, and the social status of her
husband’s family. A woman widowed in
old age would likely continue as matri-
arch of the family, a young widow withWoodroffe, Sir John
sons would retain family status through
her children, while even a child widow
in a wealthy family could have a fairly
comfortable life, although subject to
numerous restrictions. Where one or
another of these factors was lacking,
then a widow’s position would be much
more precarious, and there is no doubt
that in earlier times many widows led
very difficult lives. Even in modern
times a woman whose husband dies at a
young age is often considered to be
inauspicious, and thus a source of bad
fortune. Ameliorating the condition of
widows was one of the major goals of
nineteenth-century Hindu reformers,
and it has become more common for
widows to remarry, although some of
the most traditionally minded people do
not accept this.
Wind
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, fire, water, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the ele-
ments is paired with one of the five senses;
here wind is associated with touch. The
various “vital winds” (prana) inside the
body are also associated with a number
of bodily functions, including respira-
tion and circulation.
Witchcraft
The existence of witchcraft is generally
accepted in many segments of contem-
porary Hindu culture, even by many
“modern” urban Hindus. The root forces
behind witchcraft are malevolence,
envy, and greed, through which some
people try to harm others or to ruin
what they have gained. Witches may
work through spells, through the evil eye
(nazar), or through pronouncing curses
on others. Pregnant women and young
children are thought to be particularly
susceptible to their powers, and these
parties are also deemed particularly
likely to be cursed, because the envy
over their good fortune is said to excite
a witch’s passion. The appropriate
counteraction is to perform various
rites of protection, which will safeguard
the person from being affected. Those
afflicted by witchcraft may exhibit this
as an unusually persistent illness or as
strange behavior; for these people,
stronger remedies are needed. As Sudhir
Kakar masterfully shows, the language
of possession and exorcism can be
interpreted as an “idiom” (using tradi-
tional Indian cultural categories) for
what modern psychiatrists might call
the diagnosis and treatment of mental
illness. For further information see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991; and David F. Pocock, “The
Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
Women
In the dharma literature, women from
all social groups were considered at the
same ritual level as shudras—they could
not undergo a second birth, were forbid-
den to hear the Vedas, were forbidden to
perform certain religious rites, and in
many places could not own property or
resources, except by extension through
their husbands. At the same time,
women played (and play) an immensely
important part in Hindu religious life, as
daughters, mothers, wives, and patrons.
According to the traditional dharma lit-
erature women had their own special
role to play, based on their status as
women. See also stridharma.
Woodroffe, Sir John
(1865–1936) Calcutta High Court Justice
who also, under the pseudonym of
Arthur Avalon, translated and published
works on tantra, a secret, ritually based
religious practice. Woodroffe was one of
the earliest European exponents of
tantra as a coherent religious path and
served as an apologist for the seemingly
“impure” or “immoral” ritual acts
described in the texts. In his expositions
of the tantras, Woodroffe was trying to
convince a dual audience, both of whom
were horrified at the licentiousness
[[773]]
World Parliament of Religions
described in the tantric texts, which
involve violating deeply embedded
taboos on nonvegetarian food, con-
sumption of alcohol, and illicit sexuality.
On the one hand, Woodroffe was
addressing the British, who were the
political masters of the time, and on the
other, educated Indians, many of whom
would have preferred to dismiss the
tantras as an aberration. His publica-
tions and lectures were instrumental in
helping make tantrism respectable,
although more careful scholarly work
has been done since that time.
World Parliament of Religions
Meeting in Chicago in 1893 to which
representatives from major world reli-
gions were invited, including Asian reli-
gions. It marks a watershed in the
Euro-American conception of non-
Christian religions, in which they were
no longer seen as simple idolatry but
taken seriously as genuine religious
paths. It is also notable that many main-
line Christian churches were not repre-
sented there, and that the main
Christian presence came from histori-
cally black churches. One of the
Parliament’s highlights was the address
by Swami Vivekananda, in which
Hinduism—in its rational, Vedantic
form—was first seriously received by his
Western hearers. Vivekananda’s pres-
ence was charismatic enough that he
spent the next four years living in
America and in 1897 founded the
Vedanta Society.
Worship
Two separate words can be used to
describe Hindu worship, with two
groups of assumptions that come with
it. The first and most common act of
worship is called darshan (“seeing”), in
which devotees (bhakta) view the image
of the deity, and believe that the deity
is also looking at them. Darshan is thus
an interaction between deity and
devotee, an exchange of glances
that carries understanding. Worship
[[774]]

involving offerings and objects
usually falls under the rubric of the word
Puja (“homage”).
Worship of Tools
A rite traditionally performed on the fes-
tival of Dussehra by members of certain
artisan groups. This festival has two dif-
ferent charter myths, both of which
mark the triumph of good over evil. It is
celebrated as the day that the god Rama
slew the demon Ravana, and is also
associated with the triumph of the
Goddess over a demon named Mahi-
shasura. For the artisans, such wor-
ship ritually marks the importance of
their tools as a means to earn their
livelihood, and such propitiation is
also believed to guarantee success for
the following year.
Worship of Weapons
In earlier times, a common rite among
the warrior classes on the festival of
Dussehra (usually occurring within
October and November). This festival
has two different charter myths, both of
which mark the triumph of good over
evil. It is celebrated as the day that the
god Rama slew the demon Ravana, and
is also associated with the triumph of
the Goddess over a demon named
Mahishasura. Given the martial tone of
both charter myths, it is easy to see how
it would be associated with soldiers and
fighting, and thus this was considered a
day to worship one’s weapons, as a sym-
bol of the deity. According to popular
belief, any endeavor begun on this festi-
val day will invariably succeed, and for
this reason, Dussehra has been a
favored day to begin military cam-
paigns. Since Dussehra comes after the
end of the monsoon rains, in which any
travel is nearly impossible, this is a
favorable time from a strategic perspec-
tive as well.Yajnavalkya Smrti

Yadava
In Hindu mythology, the tribe from which
the god Krishna is said to have come and
over which he ruled after he gained his
kingdom in the city of Dwaraka. In Indian
history, the Yadava dynasty controlled the
Deccan region in modern Maharashtra
between the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. In northern Indian society, this
is the name of a particular jati, an endog-
amous social subgroup that was orga-
nized (and whose social status was
determined) by the group’s hereditary
occupation. In past generations the
Yadavas had fairly low status, but they
have recently gained much greater politi-
cal power—Mulayam Singh Yadav has
twice been elected chief minister of Uttar
Pradesh and has also served as India’s
minister of Defense; Laloo Prasad Yadav
has been the chief minister of Bihar
(either directly or by proxy through his
wife) throughout the 1990s.
and ritual technicians, who knew how to
perform complex sacrificial rites, but
they were dependent for their livelihood
on the patronage of their sponsors.
Yajna
(“sacrifice”) A fire sacrifice, which was the
primary religious act in the earliest stra-
tum of Indian religion. This cult of sacri-
fice is elaborated in the greatest detail in
the Brahmana literature, in which sacri-
fice is portrayed as the means by which
the universe came into being. The perfor-
mance of sacrifice needed highly trained
priestly technicians (rtvij), who were dif-
ferently responsible for chanting parts of
the Rg, Sama, and Yajur Vedas, as well as
building and maintaining the sacred fire
that was the heart of the sacrificial action.
This cult of sacrifice was essentially based
on burning things in this sacred fire, con-
ceived as the god Agni, so that Agni could
convey the offerings to the other deities.
These rites were so elaborate and expen-
sive that they eventually fell into disuse; by
the turn of the common era, there was
also considerable ambivalence about the
animal sacrifices that were originally an
important part of many of these sacrifices.
These ancient rites are rarely performed
today, but in the present context the word
yajna can be used for any rite involving
the sacred fire, particularly one carried out
by a brahmin for a patron.
Yadunandana
(“joy of the Yadus”) Epithet of the god
Krishna. The Yadus were reckoned as
Krishna’s clan, and thus he was their joy.
See Krishna.
Yajamana
(“patron of the sacrifice”) In the cult of
sacrifice found in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, the yajamana was
the person who commissioned the sac-
rifice and paid for its performance, and
who thus stood to gain its anticipated
benefits. This term draws a crucial dis-
tinction between priest and patron and
points to the relationship between
them—the former were learned men
Yajnavalkya
In the Upanishads, the speculative texts
that form the latest textual stratum in
the Veda, Yajnavalkya is named as a sage
associated with the court of King
Janaka, who was able to show that he
had greater wisdom than the others. He
is also ascribed as the author of the
Yajnavalkya Smrti, one of the texts that
comprise the dharma literature, based
on the pattern of mythic ascription
found in these texts.
Yajnavalkya Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered” texts, a
class of literature deemed important but
[[775]]
Yajnopavit
less authoritative than the other textual
category, the shrutis or “heard” texts. This
smrti is ascribed to the sage Yajnavalkya
and is an example of one of the Dharma
Shastras, which were manuals prescribing
rules for correct human behavior and ideal
social life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras,
which are ascribed to recognizable indi-
viduals, the Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, as a strategy to
reinforce the authority of these texts. The
extant text is about a thousand verses,
divided into sections on religious custom
(achara), the administration of justice
(vyavahara), and expiation (praya-
shchitta). Estimates on its date of compo-
sition range from the first to the sixth
century, but it is clearly later than the
Manu Smrti because some parts of the
middle section are far more developed.
The Yajnavalkya Smrti was the subject of
numerous commentaries, one of which,
the Mitakshara, was given the status of a
legal code for the greater part of India dur-
ing the British empire.
Yajnopavit
Another name for the sacred thread. See
sacred thread.
Yajur Veda
Traditionally, the third of the four Vedas.
As with the Rg Veda and the Sama Veda,
the Yajur Veda was associated with sacri-
ficial rituals, and the text itself consists
mainly of the mantras to be uttered
while the sacrifice was being carried
out. The Yajur Veda exists in five major
recensions, of which four are “black”
and one is “white.” Their differences
stem from the placement of explanatory
notes on the mantras and their signifi-
cance: The recensions of the Black Yajur
Veda contain these notes in the text
itself, whereas the White Yajur Veda
gathers these notes into an appendix
known as a Brahmana—namely, the
Shatapatha Brahmana—and this
Brahmana literature becomes the next
major stratum of Vedic texts.
[[776]]

Yaksha
(feminine yakshi) A class of minor
deities who are essentially nature spirits
and are often narrowly associated with
particular places. Yakshas are reckoned
as the attendants of the deity Kubera,
who is regarded as the guardian of the
northern direction and the lord of
wealth. The yakshas are generally
regarded as beneficent toward human
beings, and because of their associa-
tions with the generative power of
nature and with Kubera’s wealth, they
are often regarded as bestowing wealth
and fertility. Yakshas have a long history
of appearances in Indian sectarian liter-
ature, where they are either portrayed as
guardian spirits or as examples of
depravity. Although it is fairly old, the
only extensive monograph on yakshas is
Ananda Coomaraswamy, Yaksas, 1971.
Yama
God of death and Death personified. Yama
is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions, associated with the southern
direction, and for this reason, the south is
considered an inauspicious direction.
Yama first appears in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, where he is
described as the first mortal. By virtue of
being the first person to suffer death, he
was seen as presiding over the World of the
Fathers, where the virtuous dead feasted
and enjoyed themselves (much as they
had on earth). As the tradition developed,
conceptions of Yama shifted in turn, until
he was considered the judge of the dead,
ruling mainly over the regions of punish-
ment, primarily hells, in which people suf-
fered until they were reborn. Yama is often
portrayed holding a noose, with which he
draws out the person’s spirit at the time of
death and leads it bound to judgment.
Modern poster images of Yama show him
seated on a throne as king of the dead,
majestic and dark in color; to his left sits
the scribe Chitragupta, who keeps a ledger
book recording the actions of human
beings. Yama’s role as the judge of the dead
makes him greatly feared in everyday
Hindu life. Ideally, this fear can have a pos-Yamuna River

itive outcome—reinforcing people’s incli-
nation to abstain from evil—and one of the
names for Yama is Dharmaraja, the “Lord
of Righteous Action.” Hindu mythology
also has tales of people who somehow
manage to outsmart Yama, of whom the
best known is Savitri, who manages to gain
back the life of her husband, Satyavan.
Yama
(2) In the ashtanga (“eight-part”) yoga first
codified by Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), yama
(“restraint”) is the first and most basic of
the eight constituent elements of yoga
practice. Patanjali lists these as five:
abstaining from harm to other living
things (ahimsa), abstaining from theft,
truthfulness, celibacy (brahmacharya),
and abstaining from avarice. These can all
be characterized as “restraints” because
their intent is negative—they do not call
for positive actions as much as they entail
refraining from certain thoughts or actions
deemed especially injurious.
Yamunacharya
(10th c.) According to tradition, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, who is
claimed to be the grandson of Nathamuni,
and the teacher of Ramanuja. Nathamuni
was the compiler of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars, a group of poet-saints who
lived in southern India between the sev-
enth and the tenth centuries. All the Alvars
were devotees of Vishnu, and they
expressed this devotion in passionate
hymns sung in the Tamil language; among
southern Indian Vaishnavas (devotees of
Vishnu), these hymns are so holy that they
are referred to as the “Tamil Veda.”
Ramanuja, on the other hand, was a
philosopher who organized and system-
atized this devotional outpouring into a
coherent philosophical position and thus
is considered the founder of the
Shrivaishnava religious community.
It is generally believed that Yamuna-
charya was Nathamuni’s grandson, and
thus he was heir to the religious tradi-
tion his grandfather had helped create.
There is much more doubt about the
claim that he was Ramanuja’s religious
preceptor (guru) because it seems more
likely that Yamuna’s influence on
Ramanuja was transmitted by Yamuna’s
disciples. Still, what is indisputable is
that these three are the three main fig-
ures in the development of the Shri-
vaishnava tradition, and thus that
Yamunacharya occupies a pivotal spot.
Yamuna River
Northern Indian river rising at Yamu-
notri in the Himalayas, and flowing
[[777]]
Yamunotri
west and south of the Ganges River,
which the Yamuna finally joins at
Allahabad in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. The Yamuna is traditionally
considered one of the seven sacred
rivers of India, along with the Ganges,
Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada,
Indus, and Cauvery. The Yamuna
flows through the Braj region south of
Delhi, which is traditionally associat-
ed as the homeland of Krishna, and
his devotees (bhakta) revere it even
more than the Ganges. For his devo-
tees, places throughout the Braj
region carry strong associations
with the life of Krishna, but the most
important sites are at Mathura
and Brindavan.
Yamunotri
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Himalayas
at the headwaters of the Yamuna
River. Ritually speaking, Yamunotri is
considered to be the source of the
Yamuna, although the actual source
lies farther upstream, at the foot of the
Bandarpunch Mountain. Its high alti-
tude also means that it is only accessi-
ble between late April and October,
after which it is closed for the winter
months—a
pattern
echoed
at
Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath,
the other three major Himalayan pil-
grim sites. One ritual center in
Yamunotri is the river itself, in which
pilgrims bathe (snana), braving the
frigid waters. There are also several
temples—the oldest built by one of
the kings of Nepal—but the temples at
Yamunotri are quite modest com-
pared with those at Gangotri, and the
only large one was built in the 1980s.
Aside from the holy river and its tem-
ples, Yamunotri is also noted for sev-
eral hot springs from which water
emerges almost boiling; some of these
hot springs have been channeled into
a tank, and many pilgrims take advan-
tage of the hot baths.
[[778]]

Yantra
(“instrument”) In astrology (jyotisha),
and in tantra, a secret, ritually based
religious practice, the word yantra
most commonly refers to a symbolic
diagram, often believed to confer
magic or spiritual power on those
who know how to use it. In some cases
such yantras are considered to be an
aniconic form of a deity, as is the case
of the most famous yantra, the
Shriyantra or Shrichakra, which is
used in ritual for the worship of the
goddess Tripura Sundari. The most lit-
eral meaning of the word is “device for
restraining,” and in an astrological
setting the yantras of the various
planets are used in rituals to change
their effects, usually to restrain or
diminish the power of planets judged
to be malefic or inauspicious.
Yashoda
In Hindu mythology, the god
Krishna’s foster mother, who receives
him on the night he is born, and cares
for him until he is old enough to
return to Mathura to claim his throne.
Yashoda is a paradigm for selfless
devotion, who loves Krishna as if he is
her own biological child. Her mythic
example of loving, motherly care has
provided the model for vatsalya
bhava, one of the five modes of devo-
tion most prominently articulated by
Rupa Goswami, a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Krishna and a follower of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya. In the vat-
salya mode of devotion, devotees con-
sider themselves as God’s parents,
lavishing love and care on the deity as
a cow cares for her calf.
Yaska
(5th c. B.C.E.?) Traditionally cited as
the author of the Nirukta, a text giv-
ing etymological explanations for
archaic words in the Veda. Almost a
quarter of the words in the Veda
appear only once. Even by Yaska’sYatra
A yantra is a symbolic diagram often believed to confer
magic or spiritual power on those who know how to use it.
time, the meanings for many of these
words had become either uncertain or
completely lost, as the spoken lan-
guage had changed. Although at times
it is clear that Yaska himself is guess-
ing—as when modern linguists
can make comparisons to the Iranian
Avesta, a related sacred text—his
work was immeasurably helpful to
later readers.
Yathakhyati
(“discrimination [of things] as they are”)
Another name for the theory of error
known as satkhyati. See satkhyati.
Yati
(from Sanskrit yam, “to restrain”) From
the time of the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious texts, the word yati has been
one of the terms used to designate an
ascetic, as someone who had gained
control over himself. At the time of the
Vedas there seems to be some ambiva-
lence for the yatis, since the storm-god
Indra is said to have fought with them,
but in later times the word takes on an
unequivocally positive connotation.
Yatra
(“journey”) Although in its literal mean-
ing the word yatra can refer to any sort
of travel, in modern Hindi its semantic
field is considerably narrower and con-
notes travel with some serious purpose,
rather than a stroll around the block or
a sightseeing trip. The word yatra’s
most important connotation is travel
for religious purposes, particularly pil-
grimage to the sacred sites (tirthas). A
yatra is thus a journey, but a particular
type of journey.
[[779]]
Yatri
Yatri
In an ascetic context, the word yatri
denotes a novitiate Bairagi, a renun-
ciant ascetic community comprising
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu. As
an everyday word it means a person per-
forming a yatra (“journey”; more specif-
ically, a trip with the significance of a
religious pilgrimage).
Yayati
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Nahusha and a king in the lunar dynasty.
Year, Structure of
The Hindu ritual year is determined
according to both a solar calendar and a
lunar calendar. Aside from the Gregorian
calendar and the common era, there are
two indigenous Hindu calculations of
the solar year, both of which have twelve
solar months. In northern India these
months correspond to the twelve signs
of the zodiac, and the months change as
the sun moves through them. As in the
Western zodiac, the year begins when
the sun enters Aries, although according
to Indian astrology this transition takes
place around April 14, rather than
March 21, as figured in Euro-American
astrology. In southern India there is an
identical solar calendar, whose names
are drawn from the names of certain
nakshatras or lunar asterisms. Aside
from the solar months, the solar year is
also divided into halves based on the
movement of the sun: the Uttarayana
for the period when the sun is moving
north, and the Dakshinayana in the
time the sun is moving south. The sun
begins its northward journey, consid-
ered the more auspicious time, on
Makara Sankranti, reckoned as falling
on January 14; it begins its southward
journey six months later on Karka
Sankranti on July 14.
Far more important for religious
purposes is the lunar calendar, which
has twelve lunar months: Chaitra
(March–April), Baisakh (April–May),
Jyeshth (May–June), Ashadh (June–July),
[[780]]

Shravan ( July–August), Bhadrapada
(August–September), Ashvin (September–
October), Kartik (October–November),
Margashirsha (November–December),
Paush (December–January), Magh (January–
February), and Phalgun (February–
March). In northern India, the calendar
usually begins in the first day of the
bright half of Chaitra, meaning that the
last days of the year are those in the
dark half of this same month.
Since these lunar months are based on
the phases of the moon (ending with the
full moon in northern India and the new
moon in southern India), the festivals
determined by this lunar calendar fall at
different times each year with respect to
the solar calendar. This is because the
twelve lunar months are completed in
about 354 solar days, and thus, each lunar
year begins eleven days earlier than the
last. About every 21⁄2 years this discrepancy
is corrected by the addition of an extra
lunar month, known as the intercalary
month, through which the solar and lunar
calendars are kept in general correspon-
dence. The intercalary month is added to
any lunar month in which the sun does
not enter a new sign of the zodiac and can
thus fall in any month of the year. In this
way, although the solar calendar is less
important in everyday life, it helps main-
tain the general correspondence between
the lunar calendar and the seasonal festi-
vals associated with that calendar.
At least in northern India, the three
major seasons (hot, monsoon, and cool)
have important links with the festival
calendar. In general, the most ritually
active time is the cool season between
October and February; in many places
this is also the time following the
harvest, when many people have more
time and money to spend on religious
observances. The hot season has many
rites associated with heat, whereas the
rainy season, as a time of peril, is often
connected with rites of protection.
Yellamma
Presiding goddess of the shrine on
Yellama hill, in the town of Saundatti inYoga
the Belgaum district of the state of
Karnataka. Yellama’s temple is infa-
mous for being a traditional center for
the dedication of devadasis (“[female]
servant of the Lord”), a class of women
kept in temples as singers and dancers
in the service of the temple’s presiding
deity and to whom they were usually
considered to be “married.” In Yellama’s
temple, however, both boys and girls can
be dedicated. Although for the past two
centuries the devadasi tradition has car-
ried associations with common prosti-
tution, in earlier times it was far more
common for a devadasi to live with a
single man for her entire life, although
she could not marry him because she
was considered dedicated to the deity.
At times this dedication is done
because of a demand by the goddess
herself, revealed through possession; in
other cases the parents do this, hoping
to gain some concrete benefit, particu-
larly healing from disease. Yellamma is
associated with fire and also with caus-
ing (and potentially curing) skin dis-
eases, which can be seen as symbolic
“burning.”
According to the traditional model,
devadasis held a definite social position
and had special legal rights—they were
entitled to family inheritance and to
perform religious rites, which other
women were not. These special rights
have disappeared with the outlawing of
the devadasi system, done, in part, by
the British, and definitively in post-
Independence India. Although such
dedications still take place, in many
cases they are little more than a cover for
procurement, with the girls being
shipped to brothels in Bombay, Pune,
and other central Indian cities. In most
cases the girls come from extremely
poor families, and the dedication to
Yellamma is a way to avoid paying for a
wedding, a major expense in contempo-
rary Indian society. The dedications take
place on the full moon in the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February),
and are reportedly widespread, but
because of secrecy, the laws prohibit-
ing this are rarely enforced. For further
consideration of the devadasi system, in
this case at the Jagannath temple in
Puri, see Frederique Apffel Marglin,
Wives of the God-King, 1985.
Yoga
The literal meaning of the word yoga is
“the act of joining,” and it is cognate
with the English word “yoke.” Just as the
latter word can serve as either a verb or
a noun—either the act of yoking, or the
thing to which animals are yoked—in
the same way the word yoga can refer
both to the act or process of spiritual
development and also to a specific set of
teachings fostering this development.
Both these meanings can be conveyed
by the word “discipline,” and this is one
of the preferred translations.
There are many specific teachings
styling themselves as yogas. The oldest
one is laid out in the Yoga Sutras attrib-
uted to the sage Patanjali; this system is
known as ashtanga (“eight-limbed”)
yoga, because of its eight constituent
parts. Other well-known yogas are the
three “paths” described by the god
Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, an
important religious text: the yogas of
action (karma), wisdom (jnana), and
devotion (bhakti). Another well-known
yoga is kundalini yoga, the practice of
which is entirely internal, in the alter-
nate physiological system known as the
subtle body. Kundalini yoga stresses
awakening the kundalini, the latent
spiritual power that exists in every per-
son, and through this gaining spiritual
benefits. These make up the main cate-
gories of teachings, but the members of
many particular religious communities
will describe their religious practice
as yoga: Thus there is the surat-shabd-
yoga of the Radha Soamis, the Raja
Yoga of the Brahma Kumaris, or the
Siddha Yoga of the SYDA Foundation.
In such cases the word is used to
identify a particular religious group’s
characteristic teaching, which usually
includes elements from the classical
articulations of yoga.
[[781]]
Yoga Mudra
Yoga Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the right hand is
placed flat on the left, with both palms
pointing up, and the joined hands are
laid on the crossed legs. In a sculptural
image, this mudra indicates that the fig-
ure is adept in yoga.
Yogananda, Paramahamsa
(b. Mukunda Lal Ghosh 1893–1952)
Modern Hindu teacher and founder of
the Self-Realization Fellowship. Yoga-
nanda was one of the earliest Hindu
missionaries to come to America. He
came to Boston in 1920, to address the
International Congress of Religious
Liberals in Boston and never returned
to India. He eventually settled outside
Los Angeles, where he established a
center and lived for the rest of his life. In
his early years in America he was con-
sidered something of a curiosity, and
there are photos of him taken with
President Calvin Coolidge. Yogananda’s
teachings were largely based in the ash-
tanga yoga of the classical Yoga Sutras,
but he also stressed the doctrine of kriya
(“active”) yoga, which is claimed to
accelerate spiritual attainment. Most of
Yogananda’s disciples and both his suc-
cessors were Americans, and the Self-
Realization Fellowship is essentially an
American organization with historical
roots in India. For further information
see Paramahansa Yogananda’s Auto-
biography of a Yogi, 1997.
Yoganidra
(“sleep of yoga”) Epithet of the Goddess
in the first episode of the Devi-
mahatmya, the earliest and most author-
itative text for the mythology of the
Goddess. In this episode, the Goddess
has lulled Vishnu into a stupor through
her power of illusion, making him
oblivious to Brahma’s cries for help
when he is menaced by the demons
Madhu and Kaitabha. Brahma is saved
when he praises the Goddess, after
[[782]]

which she withdraws her yogic sleep
from Vishnu; he then regains con-
sciousness and rescues Brahma by
killing the demons.
Yoga Sutras
(“aphorisms on yoga”) A set of brief say-
ings traditionally ascribed to the sage
Patanjali, which are the foundational
texts for the Yoga school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are usually
read with a commentary ascribed to the
sage Vyasa, and this commentary has
become accepted as an integral part of
the text. The text of the Yoga Sutras is
divided into four parts, with each part
devoted to a particular theme: The first
part focuses on concentration (samadhi),
the second part on the mechanics of
spiritual development (sadhana), the
third part treats various attainments
(vibhuti), including magic powers (sid-
dhi), and the last part describes the state
of yogic isolation (kaivalya), which the
text describes as liberation. The text pre-
supposes the cosmology taught by the
Samkhya school, another of the six
schools, and the Yoga school is often
considered the “practical” articulation
of Samkhya theory.
Yogi
Literally meaning “one possessing
yoga,” in practice the word refers only to
a yogic adept—someone who “possesses”
yoga in the sense of having mastered
it—rather than to anyone simply prac-
ticing yoga. True yogis are widely
believed to have superhuman powers
(siddhi) as a by-product of their long
spiritual development, which they can
and will exercise for the benefit of their
disciples—for physical healing of dis-
eases, for psychological help, or for giv-
ing guidance on both spiritual and
mundane matters. The yogi is seen as a
spiritually realized person, and their
authority stems completely from this
attribution, which paradoxically is not
subject to any sort of external verification.Yogmaya
Consequently, there are significant dif-
ferences of opinion on whether or not
any particular person is a yogi.
Yogi Bhajan
(b. Harbhajan Singh Puri, 1927) Modern
Hindu missionary and founder of the
[[3]]
HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood. He
first came to the United States in 1969,
leaving behind his position as a customs
official at the Delhi airport. His initial
teachings were the traditional disci-
plines of hatha yoga and kundalini
yoga, with his followers organized into a
group known as the “Happy, Healthy,
Holy Organization” (3HO). Hatha yoga is
a system of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas; this practice is widely
believed to provide various physical
benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Kundalini yoga is a religious
discipline, the primary focus of which is
awakening the kundalini, the latent
spiritual force that exists in every person
in the subtle body. The kundalini is
awakened through a combination of
yoga practice and ritual action and is
believed to bring further spiritual capac-
ities and ultimately final liberation
(moksha) of the soul.
These two disciplines remain an
important part of Yogi Bhajan’s teach-
ings, for he claims to be a master of
tantra, a secret, ritually based religious
practice, but in the 1970s his teaching
widened to include traditional Sikh
teachings and symbols. The most
prominent of these symbols are the “five
Ks” that all Sikhs are supposed to wear,
so called because each of them begins
with the letter k: uncut hair (kesh), a
comb (kangha), a bangle on the right
wrist (kara), shorts (kacch), and a cere-
monial sword (kirpan). Many of Yogi
Bhajan’s followers keep the Sikh symbols
far more strictly than most people born
as Sikhs, but the movement has two
important divergences with the tradi-
tional Sikh community. One of these is
its emphasis on tantra, which has little
importance in the Sikh community. The
most significant difference, however, is
the religious authority that Yogi Bhajan
holds over his followers, which is very
different from the decentralized, essen-
tially democratic form of the traditional
Sikh community.
Yogini Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Ashadh ( June–July). As for all the
eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu,
particularly in his form as Narayana.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites, which usually involve
fasting (upavasa) and worship and
often promise specific benefits for
faithful performance. On this day the
prescribed action is to give gifts to
poor brahmins; faithfully observing this
festival washes away the sin of cutting
down a pipal tree (ashvattha) and also
brings one birth in heaven.
Yogmaya
Powerful form of the Goddess, particu-
larly noted for her power to bewitch and
bewilder people—in other words, her
ability to wield maya, the power of illu-
sion. In some modern sources Yogmaya
is named as the deity who takes the
form of the infant girl exchanged for the
infant god Krishna and is later killed
by Krishna’s wicked uncle, Kamsa.
According to these sources, it is under
her spell the previous night that all the
inhabitants of Kamsa’s palace fall asleep,
and Krishna’s father, Vasudeva, is able to
spirit the infant away. Later in Krishna’s
career, Yogmaya is believed to facilitate
his clandestine meetings with the
women of Braj—when Krishna plays his
flute, the women come to him, but all
the others fall into the spell cast by
Yogmaya and are unaware of their
absence. Because of her ability to wield
maya, Yogmaya is a powerful deity; she
is worshiped on the fourth day of the fall
[[783]]
Yoni
Navaratri, the festival of the “nine
nights” that are sacred to the Goddess in
her varying forms.
Yoni
Although in modern Hindi this has
become a vulgar word for female
genitalia, its most literal meaning is
“womb,” both in a literal sense as the
place of gestation and in a metaphorical
sense as any place of origin, source, or
generative power.
Yudhishthira
(“firm in battle”) In the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics,
Yudhishthira is the eldest of the
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. Yudhishthira is magically
born when his mother, Kunti, uses a
powerful mantra to have a son by
Dharma, the god of righteousness.
Yudhishthira is in all ways his father’s
son; he is described in the epic as the
manifestation of Dharma on earth. He
is proverbial for his strict adherence to
the truth, is courteous to all, and is
committed to righteousness. His only
personal flaw is a love of gambling, a
love matched only by his complete lack
of gaming skill, and this flaw has major
repercussions.
Because of his virtues, Yudhishthira
is selected as heir to the throne by his
uncle, Dhrtarashtra. This choice raises
the jealousy of Dhrtarashtra’s son,
Duryodhana. He first tries to kill the
Pandavas by building the flammable
house of lac. The house is burned, but
the Pandavas are able to escape
unharmed. Some time later, Duryodhana
decides to win Yudhishthira’s rights to
the kingship in a game of dice. Here
Yudhishthira’s love for gambling gets the
better of his judgment, for he is playing
against Duryodhana’s maternal uncle,
Shakuni, who is very skilled. As Yud-
hishthira begins to lose, he keeps betting
bigger and bigger stakes, in an effort to
win back what he has lost. After losing
their kingdom and all their posses-
[[784]]

sions, Yudhishthira wagers himself and
his brothers. After losing this bet, he
wagers and loses the Pandava brothers’
common wife, Draupadi. This loss
leads to Draupadi’s humiliation, in
which she is paraded through the
assembly hall by Duryodhana and his
brother, Duhshasana, her clothes
stained with her menstrual blood. This
event sharpens the already strong enmi-
ties between the two groups. Shocked at
such treatment, Duryodhana’s father,
King Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas
back their freedom, but because of the
loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas
agree to go into exile for twelve years
and live incognito for the thirteenth,
with the condition that if they are
discovered in the thirteenth year the
cycle will begin anew.
Yudhishthira and his brothers peace-
fully pass their twelve years in exile.
During the thirteenth year, they live in the
court of King Virata, where they remain
undiscovered, despite frantic searching
by Duryodhana’s spies. When the thir-
teen years have passed, Yudhishthira and
his brothers return to claim their part of
the kingdom. Yudhishthira hopes for
some sort of peaceful settlement and
sends a message to Duryodhana saying
that they will be satisfied with a mere five
villages, one for each brother. When
Duryodhana responds that they will not
get as much land as could fit under the
point of a needle, Yudhishthira realizes
that they will not get their rights without
a battle. He reluctantly mobilizes his
brothers for war. He fights valiantly in
the great war and is crowned the king
after their victory.
After ruling for many years,
Yudhishthira sets out with his brothers
and their wife, Draupadi, for the
Himalayas, followed by a small dog. As
they climb the mountains Draupadi and
his brothers die one by one, but the dog
remains with Yudhishthira. At the top of
the Himalayas Yudhishthira finds the
god Indra, the king of heaven, waiting
for him in a golden chariot. Indra tells
Yudhishthira that he will take him to
heaven but that Yudhishthira will haveYuga
to leave the dog behind. Yudhishthira
flatly refuses to abandon his faithful
companion, even if it means that he will
not go to heaven. The dog then reveals
himself to be the god Dharma in dis-
guise. The lesson in this story is that
throughout his life Yudhishthira never
allows himself to stray far from right-
eousness; even at the end he refuses to
forsake it.
Yuga
A name denoting a unit of cosmic time,
with two possible meanings. According
to traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with the active phase known as
the Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
the Night of Brahma. In cosmic time,
the Day of Brahma is divided into one
thousand mahayugas (“great cosmic
ages”), each of which lasts for 4.32
million years, and this is one possible
meaning of the word yuga. The more
common use is to refer to a mahayuga’s
four constituent yugas, named the Krta
Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and
Kali Yuga.
[[785]]
Zodiac
## Z
Zodiac
The signs of the zodiac in Indian astrol-
ogy (jyotisha) are virtually identical with
that of Western astrology, and it is gener-
ally accepted that the Greek zodiac was
brought to India in the first to third cen-
turies via the Greek kingdoms in mod-
ern Afghanistan. There are slight
differences in the nomenclature; the
Indian zodiac has Dhanus (“bow”) in
place of Sagittarius, Makara (a sea mon-
ster sometimes identified as a crocodile)
for Capricorn, and Kumbha (“[water]
pot”) for Aquarius. As with Western
astrology, each of the twelve signs has
certain characteristics, with which peo-
ple born in these signs are imbued.
The two systems differ sharply in
how they figure the annual starting
point, although both begin with the sign
of Aries. The zodiac used in Western
astrology begins on the vernal equinox,
on which the sign of Aries is the begin-
ning. By Indian accounts the starting
point of the zodiac comes when the sun
intersects the midpoint of a group of
stars named Ashvini. It is thus based on
the position of the sun with regard to
the fixed stars, whereas the Western
zodiac is based on the position of the
sun with regard to the earth—that is,
when it intersects the equator, and is
thus independent of the fixed stars.
These differing methods have produced
a discrepancy between the two systems,
which are now more than three weeks
apart—in the Western zodiac Aries
begins on March 21, whereas in the
Indian zodiac it does not begin until
about April 14. This discrepancy can
also be seen in the account of Makara
Sankranti and Karka Sankranti, which
[[786]]

are judged to be the winter and the sum-
mer solstices but occur in the second
weeks of January and July. Given a differ-
ence of about three weeks, it is not sur-
prising that there are significant
differences in the astrological calcula-
tions between these two systems.

### A Note on Transliteration
I have transliterated Hindi and Sanskrit terms into English to match their
original pronunciation as closely as possible. In most cases, the translitera-
tion is a straightforward substitution of Hindi or Sanskrit letters with their
counterparts in English. However, discrepancies in the languages create
some difficulties in transliteration.
In this book, Hindi and Sanskrit words are made plural by adding the
English s to the end. This is done to conform the transliterated words to
English grammar, even though this is not standard in Hindi or Sanskrit.
For some terms there exist both Sanskritic and Hindi forms, each with dif-
ferent pronunciations. I have transliterated these words from Hindi or
Sanskrit depending on the most appropriate context; Sanskritic forms seem
fitting when one is discussing Sanskrit texts, but not when reporting a remark
by a Hindi speaker.
Transliteration also becomes complicated for words where there is a Hindi
or Sanskrit letter that does not directly correspond to a letter in English. For
example, single characters in the Hindi alphabet represent sounds that
require consonant combinations in English, such as “ch” and “sh.” I have used
these letter combinations to substitute for the Hindi letters whenever possi-
ble. In other cases, transliterating Hindi and Sanskrit pronunciation is not as
straightforward. The following list contains Hindi and Sanskrit terms from
this book that do not follow standard English pronunciation. They are written
here with diacritical marks to indicate the proper pronunciation.

as in check
as in lip (with the “l” sound rolled)
This is the Tamil “l.” To make this sound place the tip of
the tongue back in the palate and hold it there while
making an “l” sound.
This indicates that the previous vowel is nazalized
(pronounced through the nose)
as in sing or sink
as pronounced in Spanish (eg. mañana)
as in rip (with the “r” sound rolled)
This sound is found in Tamil, but not Sanskrit. The “r”
sound is pronounced with a trill.
as in shirt
As for !/!h, @/@h, 3, and 5, these are pronounced by placing the tip of
the tongue at the top of the palate and flexing it forward.

### About the Author
James G. Lochtefeld, Ph.D., holds a B.A. from Colgate University, an M.T.S. from the Harvard
Divinity School, an M.A. in Asian languages and literature from the University of
Washington, and an M.Phil. and Ph.D. from Columbia University. He is an associate profes-
sor of religion at Carthage College in Wisconsin, where he has taught since 1992.
Dr. Lochtefeld specializes in Hinduism and is particularly interested in contemporary
Hindu religious life. He did fieldwork for his dissertation in the North Indian pilgrimage
town of Haridwar under the guidance of the American Institute of Indian Studies and Delhi
University. Aside from Hinduism, his areas of teaching have included the Buddhist tradition
in India, China, and Japan; Islam; Chinese religion; and Sanskrit. Lochtefeld was three times
named a President’s Fellow at Columbia University. In 1990, he received the Charlotte W.
Newcombe Fellowship, the most prestigious award for dissertations in religion and ethics. In
the summer of 1996, he returned to Haridwar to conduct fieldwork. He was awarded a Senior
Research Fellowship by the American Institute of Indian Studies, through which he was able
to study the Kumbha Mela, the world’s largest religious festival, during a sabbatical leave in
Haridwar in the spring of 1998.
