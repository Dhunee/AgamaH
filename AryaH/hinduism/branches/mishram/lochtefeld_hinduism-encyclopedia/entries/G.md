Gada
(“club”) In Hindu iconography, one of
the identifying objects carried by the
god Vishnu, along with the conch shell
(shankha), lotus (padma), and discus
(chakra). In the Mahabharata , the
later of the two great Hindu epics, the
gada is also the weapon of choice for
Bhima, one of the five Pandava broth-
ers who are the epic’s protagonists. Of
these five brothers, Bhima is noted for
his prodigious size and strength, which
gives him obvious advantages in wield-
ing the gada.
Gahadavalas were a short-lived and
transitional dynasty who filled a politi-
cal vacuum during the tumultuous years
following the turn of the first millennium.
During this period the Gangetic plain
was plagued by political instability and
was regularly subjected to Muslim raids.
The Gahadavalas supplanted the
Rashtrakutas, whom they conquered in
[[1089]]
, and consolidated their power
through the middle Ganges basin. In
[[1194]]
 the Gahadavalas were defeated by
the Ghurids, an Afghani Muslim dynasty.
Following their defeat, most of the
Gahadavala territory became part of the
Ghurid empire.
Gaja Hasta
A particular hand gesture (hasta) used
in Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual.
In the gaja (“elephant”) hasta, the arm
is extended straight out, with the
hand gently curving down; the curved
arm is fancifully compared to the trunk
of an elephant.
Gadge Maharaj
(1876–1956) Modern ascetic teacher
and religious preceptor in the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
Gadge Maharaj got his name from the
clay pot (gadge) that was his only pos-
session, signifying his rejection of all
wealth and worldly entanglements.
Gadge had been born into a caste of
washermen, who are considered a low
status group since their everyday work
brings them in contact with other peo-
ple’s soiled garments. In his teachings,
Gadge not only stresses the importance
of devotion to God—the hallmark of
the bhakti (devotional) movement—
but also advocates temperance, poverty,
and vegetarianism.
Gahadavala Dynasty
(r. 1089–1194) Northern Indian dynasty
whose core region was the western and
central parts of the Gangetic plain. The
Gajendramoksha
(“release of the elephant-king”) The
name of a particular incident in Hindu
mythology involving a battle between
king Indradyumna, in the form of
a giant elephant, and a Gandharva
(celestial musician) named Huhu, in
the form of a giant crocodile. Both
Indradyumna and Huhu have assumed
these forms as the result of a curse.
Indradyumna has been cursed by the
sage Agastya, who becomes angry when
the meditating king fails to greet him
with proper respect. Huhu has been
cursed by the sage Devala, when the
amorous water play between Huhu and
some celestial damsels has disturbed
the sage’s meditation.
The struggle between the two ani-
mals begins when the elephant comes
to the water to drink and the crocodile
grabs him by the leg. The crocodile
attempts to pull the elephant into deep-
er water while the elephant struggles to
break free. The pair are so evenly
[[231]]
Galta
matched that neither can best the other.
After the battle has raged for a thousand
years the god Vishnu appears, kills the
crocodile, and restores Indradyumna to
his previous form. The story thus takes
its name, the “release of the elephant
king,” because Indradyumna was freed
from the crocodile’s grasp and the
effects of the curse.
Galta
A village in the state of Rajasthan, a few
miles east of Jaipur, the capital. Galta is
most famous for its connection with the
Bairagi Naga ascetics, renunciant trader-
soldiers who were devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu. According to Bairagi
tradition, in 1756 a conference took
place at Galta in which the different
groups of Bairagi Naga ascetics were
welded into one cohesive military unit
called the Ramanadis or “army of Ram”
under the leadership of a Bairagi named
Balanand. Balanand organized the
Ramanandis into three anis or armies—
the Digambara Ani, Nirvani Ani, and
Nirmohi Ani—which are still the major
Bairagi divisions. According to tradi-
tion, this unification was necessary
because of continual attacks by the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
a competing group of renunciant trader-
soldiers who were devotees of the god
Shiva. The dispute occurred during
the festival Kumbha Mela, ostensibly
over precedence in the bathing (snana)
procession, which was a sign of rela-
tive status. However, an underlying
cause may have been power and con-
trol of an area’s resources.
The exact circumstances under
which the armies of Ram were formed
are difficult to determine. Independent
sources clearly show that the Bairagis
became more cohesively organized dur-
ing the late eighteenth century and
that some of these bairagi bands were
using their mobility, resources, and
power to engage in long-distance trad-
ing. However, the decentralized nature
of ascetic life makes the summary for-
mation of such an army highly unlikely,
[[232]]

unless this was the final fruition of an
already existing trend.
Gambling
A practice with a long history in Indian
culture, but that has almost always been
portrayed in a negative light by Hindu
texts. The earliest reference appears in
the Rg Veda, the oldest Hindu religious
text, in a hymn often described as “The
Gambler’s Lament.” The hymn is a gam-
bler’s first-person account of the ways in
which his obsession with gaming ruined
his life. It ends with a warning to the lis-
tener not to be seduced by gambling’s
siren song. Gambling is also negatively
portrayed in the Mahabharata, the later
of the two great Hindu epics. A passion
for gaming is the only fault afflicting
Yudhishthira (the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists), but it brings disastrous
results. In a dice game with the king-
dom’s most skillful player, Shakuni,
Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, his
brothers, and even himself; as a result of
the game, he and his brothers have to go
into exile.
These mythic models mirror the
attitudes toward gambling in Hindu
society. Sober and upright Hindus have
generally avoided games of chance,
since they are not a stable or respectable
way to risk one’s capital or earn a living.
The only time that prudence and
caution can be legitimately disregarded
is on the festival of Diwali, which is
sacred to Lakshmi, the goddess of
wealth and prosperity. Gambling is a
traditional part of the Diwali celebra-
tions, used to pay homage to Lakshmi in
her guise as Lady Luck. Diwali is most
often celebrated in people’s homes, and
thus any gambling will take place with
one’s family and close associates, and
with purely nominal betting. Aside from
Diwali, gambling is strictly proscribed in
polite society, and even on Diwali its dis-
ruptive capacities are strictly contained.Gandharva Marriage
Gana
(“host”) In Hindu mythology, a collec-
tive term for a group of minor gods
who are the god Shiva’s servants and
attendants. The members of this gana
are often represented in frightening
forms—smeared with ash, bearing
skulls and weapons, physically mal-
formed, and grinning and laughing
horribly. The members of the gana are
Shiva’s followers, supporters, and
minions, who are ready to do his bid-
ding when commanded. The leader of
the gana is the god Ganesh (“Lord of
the Host”).
a pot of clarified butter (ghee).
Eventually the pots break open, reveal-
ing one hundred handsome boys and a
single daughter, Dussala.
All of Gandhari’s children are killed
by her nephews the Pandavas in the
Mahabharata war. Just as Gandhari is
about to curse the Pandavas, Vyasa
reminds her that her sons’ deaths are
the result of their own misconduct. After
the war, Gandhari retires to the forest
with her husband and a few others. They
live in retirement for six years before
they are killed in a forest fire.
Gandharva
Ganapati
(“Master of [Shiva’s] host”) Another
name for the god Ganesh. See Ganesh.
Gandaki River
One of the tributaries of the Ganges, it
flows southward from Nepal, joining the
Ganges at the city of Patna in the state of
Bihar. Although the river’s source is now
extremely poor, in the time of the
Buddha it contained major urban cen-
ters, particularly the city of Vaishali.
Gandhari
A character in the Mahabharata, the
later of the two great Hindu epics.
Gandhari is the wife of the blind king
Dhrtarashtra and the mother of the
Kauravas, a group of boys who are the
epic’s antagonists. Gandhari shows her
devotion to her blind husband by always
covering her eyes with a blindfold, thus
sharing his sightlessness. As is often the
case in Hindu mythology, her sons are
born in an unusual manner. Gandhari
receives a blessing (ashirvad) from the
sage Vyasa that she will give birth to one
hundred sons. Soon after, she becomes
pregnant. However, her pregnancy lasts
for more than two years. When she
grows impatient and tries to hasten the
delivery, she gives birth to a great lump
of flesh. Vyasa advises Gandhari to
divide the lump and place each piece in
In Hindu mythology, a class of demigods
who are celestial singers and musicians.
The gandharvas occasionally interact
with humans. One of their divine gifts is
the ability to bestow good singing voices
to girls. Since the Gandharvas are always
watching from above, they are consid-
ered to be the witnesses in a Gandharva
marriage, one of the eight forms of mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture. The gandharva marriage was a
marriage contracted by consensual sex-
ual intercourse. See also Marriage, eight
classical forms.
Gandharva Marriage
One of the eight forms of marriage rec-
ognized in the dharma literature, the
treatises on religious duty. A Gandharva
marriage takes place when a man and
woman have sexual intercourse by
mutual consent, but without consulting
anyone else. The marriage is so named
because gandharvas, who are demigods
and celestial musicians, are said to be
the witnesses. Although the gandharva
rite created a valid marriage, it was con-
sidered one of the four reprehensible
(aprashasta) forms of marriage because
it was done without parental consent,
performed without religious rituals, and
was rooted in lust. These marriages were
recognized not to sanction and legit-
imize promiscuous behavior, but to pro-
vide the woman with the legal status of a
[[233]]

wife. Although Sanskrit literary sources
are replete with Gandharva marriages—
perhaps the most famous being the
marriage of King Dushyanta and
Shakuntala—it is doubtful that this
form was ever widely practiced. See also
marriage, eight classical forms.
Gandhi, Mohandas K.
(1869–1948) Leader of the Indian
National Congress, one of the architects
of the struggle for Indian independence,
and one of the best-known Indians in
history. Gandhi was born in Gujarat,
where his father was a minister to one of
the native princes. Shortly after Gandhi’s
father died, the British ousted the ruling
prince for mismanagement, and the
family lost their position. Gandhi was
sent to London to study law, and during
this time he came into contact with a
variety of new ideas that would strongly
influence his future. Ironically, one of
these influences was the Bhagavad Gita,
an important Hindu religious text from
which he drew continuing inspiration in
his later life. After returning to India in
[[1891]]
, Gandhi failed in his attempt to set
up a law practice in Bombay, and he
went back to Gujarat. In 1894 Gandhi
traveled to South Africa to do some
work for a Muslim trading firm. He
intended to be gone only a short time,
but ended up staying in South Africa for
twenty years. During this time he dis-
covered his true calling, political
activism. This was sparked by his own
experience of racial discrimination—
being thrown out of a railway car
reserved for “whites only”—and was
fueled by the social, political, and legal
disadvantages suffered by South Africa’s
[[40]]
,000 Indians, most of whom were illit-
erate agricultural workers. During his
time in South Africa, Gandhi developed
and refined his basic tactics: mass non-
cooperation, nonviolent resistance, will-
ingness to face imprisonment, and
skillful use of the print media to influ-
ence public opinion. In 1914 he
returned to India, where he soon
became one of the leading figures in the
[[234]]

struggle against the British—first for
home rule, and finally for outright inde-
pendence.
Gandhi’s deeply held moral princi-
ples shaped his entire career. He saw his
political activism not as a vehicle for
personal advancement, but as a means
for selfless action for the welfare of the
world. This stress on selfless action drew
heavily on the message of the Bhagavad
Gita, in which the god Krishna recom-
mends a similar path to his friend and
devotee (bhakta), Arjuna. Throughout
his life Gandhi remained committed to
nonviolence. Gandhi felt strongly that
the nature of any goal would be influ-
enced by the means by which it had
been attained. Another of his funda-
mental principles was truth, as seen in
his insistence that evil and injustice had
to be resisted, even by violence when all
other means had failed. A third essential
tenet was self-control, which he consid-
ered the prerequisite to leading others.
His commitment to his principles gave
him the strength to endure imprison-
ment, injury, and more than thirty years
of struggle with the British government;
it also moved him to campaign against
many other injustices, particularly the
notion of untouchability.
When independence finally arrived
in 1947 it was tainted by the partition of
British India into India and Pakistan,
fueled in part by Muslim concerns about
their minority status in an independent
Hindu India. The partition sparked a
massive exodus, in which fifteen million
people migrated from one country to
the other. It also sparked unspeakable
communal violence, in which an esti-
mated one million people died. Despite
his best efforts, Gandhi was unable to
prevent partition or to create good rela-
tions between the two countries. Within
six months of independence, Gandhi
was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a
Hindu nationalist who felt that Gandhi
was being too soft on Pakistan.
Gandhi had critics and opponents
throughout his career, many of whom
felt that he did not deserve the saint-
hood that people attributed to him.Gandhi, Mohandas K.

Gandiva
A sculpture of the god Ganesh from the village of
Khajuraho. As “Lord of Obstacles,” Ganesh has the
power to remove or bestow difficulties.
Among his critics were B. R. Ambedkar,
who felt that Gandhi had used the
untouchables as pawns in negotiations
with the British because he opposed
letting the untouchables separate from
the larger body politic. His critics also
included Subhash Chandra Bose, who
advocated an armed struggle against
the British, and Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar, a Hindu nationalist who was
Godse’s inspiration. For further infor-
mation see Mohandas K. Gandhi, An

Indian national holiday falling on

because the event is a national holiday,

In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Gandiva is the
name of the bow carried by Arjuna.
Arjuna is the world’s greatest archer
and the third of the five Pandava broth-
ers, the Mahabharata’s protagonists.
Gandiva was originally fashioned by
the god Brahma and is given to Arjuna
by the god Varuna (identified with the
ocean) at the request of another deity,
Agni (“fire”). Agni makes this request
because he wants to “eat” (burn) the
Khandava forest, but is afraid of inter-
ference in the form of rain from the god
Indra, ruler of the storm. Arjuna uses
the bow to create a canopy of arrows
that shields the forest from Indra’s
storms, thus allowing Agni to consume
the forest in peace. Arjuna uses this
bow for many years. At the end of his
life he returns it to Varuna by throwing
it into the sea.
Ganesh
(“Lord of [Shiva’s] Host”) Elephant-
headed god who leads Shiva’s horde of
divine followers; another name for
Ganesh is Ganapati. Ganesh is usually
portrayed as short and fat, with a bowl of
sweets and his animal vehicle, the rat,
close by. Among the items most often
portrayed in his hands are a lotus
(padma) and his own broken tusk. He
also often holds a noose and an
elephant goad (ankusha), which sym-
bolize his power to restrain or move
obstructing forces.
Although Ganesh is worshiped as a
primary deity by a small sectarian com-
munity, the Ganpatyas, most Hindus
worship him as a subsidiary deity along
with their principal divinities. Ganesh’s
importance in Hindu life, however, is far
greater than his relatively minor place in
the pantheon. Hindus consider GaneshGanesh Chaturthi
as “Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar),
who has the power both to remove and
to bestow difficulties, depending on
whether or not a person has pleased
him. Hindus invoke Ganesh at the start
of any important undertaking—whether
it is performing a religious ritual, start-
ing a business, performing a marriage,
building a home, or even taking a school
examination—so that through his grace,
potential obstacles may be removed or
avoided and the undertaking will pro-
ceed smoothly and successfully. This
power over obstacles is symbolized both
by his elephant head and his animal
vehicle, the rat. The elephant’s strength
allows it to break down any impedi-
ments, while the rat is able to slip
through the smallest cracks to gain
access to locked places. Ganesh’s ani-
conic image is the threshold, the transi-
tional strip dividing and separating
different spaces, which further symbol-
izes his power to control transitions
from one state to another.
Ganesh is considered to be the son
of the god Shiva and his wife Parvati,
but he is born in an unusual manner.
One day when Parvati is bathing
(snana), she forms a child from the dirt
from her body, animates him, and
directs him to permit no one to enter
her bathing place. When Shiva comes
to the door Ganesh bars his way, and in
the ensuing battle Shiva cuts off
Ganesh’s head. Parvati is so upset that
Shiva promises to replace the missing
head with the head of the first animal
he encounters, which happens to be an
elephant. Upon reviving Ganesh, Shiva
appoints him as the leader of his troop
of followers. As a further boon, Shiva
tells Ganesh that he will be worshiped
before any other deity.
Ganesh’s elephant head has a broken
tusk, and there are differing myths
recounting how this happened. In one
story it comes from an altercation with
the Parashuram avatar, who tries to
enter Shiva’s chambers while Ganesh is
guarding the door. According to another
account, the injury is self-inflicted. In a
fit of rage at the moon, Ganesh breaks
off his tusk and throws it at the moon.
According to tradition, Ganesh uses
this tusk as a pen to write down the
text of the epic Mahabharata as it is
dictated by the sage Vyasa. For further
information on Ganesh and his cult,
see Paul Courtright, Ganesa, 1985;
other information can be found in
works on Hindu mythology.
Ganesh Chaturthi
Festival falling on the fourth (chaturthi)
day of the bright or waxing half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September), dedicated to the
worship of the god Ganesh. This festival
is observed throughout India, but is par-
ticularly celebrated in Maharashtra.
During this festival clay images of
Ganesh are consecrated and worshiped.
At the festival’s end the images are car-
ried in procession for ceremonial
immersion in bodies of water—whether
the sea, a river, or the village pond.
Although Ganesh is a relatively
minor deity in the Hindu pantheon,
his role as the Lord of Obstacles
(Vighneshvar) makes him important in
everyday life, since his involvement can
either further or hinder one’s efforts. For
this reason, Ganesh is always worshiped
at the start of any endeavor and at the
beginning of all religious ceremonies.
While Ganesh plays an important role in
people’s everyday lives, the festival
Ganesh Chaturthi gained prominence in
Maharashtra for political reasons. Bal
Gangadhar Tilak, one of the most
important figures in the nineteenth-
century Hindu renaissance, promoted
the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi as a
visible way to assert and celebrate a
Hindu nationalist identity during the
time of British imperial rule. Given the
power of British rule, outright rebellion
was simply impossible, and the British
government heavily restricted all forms
of political dissent. The Ganesh festival
provided a way to circumvent these
restrictions, since the British had a long-
standing policy of not interfering with
religious observances. The celebration
[[237]]
Ganga
of this festival in Maharashtra, particu-
larly the processions to immerse the
images in the sea, became an important
theater to demonstrate and affirm
Hindu cultural and political identity.
Ganga
In Hindu mythology, the goddess whose
material form is the Ganges River. The
Ganges is sacred because the river is
considered to be a goddess who has the
power to take away the sins of those who
bathe (snana) in her. There are numer-
ous legends to explain her origin. The
best-known is the tale of King Bhagirath,
who by his ascetic practice succeeds in
bringing the Ganges down from heaven
to earth. Bhagirath is the great-great-
grandson of King Sagar, whose 60,000
sons had been burned to ash by the sage
Kapila’s magic power after they had
erroneously accused Kapila of being a
thief. Kapila later tells Anshuman, King
Sagar’s grandson and sole surviving
descendant, that the only way to bring
peace to the souls of Sagar’s sons is to
bring the Ganges down from heaven to
earth. Anshuman strives unsuccessfully
to do this, as does his son Dilip after
him. Dilip’s son Bhagirath takes their
efforts to heart and retires to the
Himalayas, where he performs asceti-
cism until the gods finally agree to send
the Ganges down to earth. Yet
Bhagiratha’s efforts are not yet over.
Next, he has to gain the favor of the god
Shiva, so that Shiva will agree to take the
shock of the falling river on his head.
Otherwise, its force will destroy the
earth. When all is finally in place, the
Ganges falls to earth onto the head of
Shiva. Bhagirath leads Ganga out of the
mountains to the sea, where she touches
his ancestors’ ashes and they finally find
peace. This myth highlights both the
salvific touch of the Ganga and her inti-
mate association with the last rites
(antyeshthi samskara) for the dead.
According to another story, the
Ganges comes down to earth because of
a curse pronounced during a family
quarrel between Vishnu and his wives
[[238]]

Ganga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati. When
one day Ganga and Vishnu begin
exchanging lustful glances in public,
Saraswati gets angry and begins to beat
Ganga. As Lakshmi tries to stop her,
Saraswati let loose a string of curses:
that Vishnu will be born as a stone (the
shalagram), that Lakshmi will be born
as a plant (the tulsi plant), and that
Ganga will be born as a river and take
the sins of the world on her. In the strug-
gle, Saraswati is cursed to become a
river. Vishnu sweetens Ganga’s curse by
telling her that she will be considered
very holy on earth and have the power to
remove people’s sins. Vishnu also tells
her that she will fall from heaven onto
the head of the god Shiva and become
his consort.
Ganga Dashahara
Festival celebrated on the tenth day of
the bright or waxing half of the lunar
month of Jyeshth (May–June), which
marks the day that the goddess Ganga is
believed to have descended from heaven
to earth to become the Ganges River.
The primary religious rite performed on
this day is bathing (snana) in sacred
rivers, particularly the Ganges.
Ganga Dynasty
(11th–15th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty
that ruled the coastal strip on the Bay of
Bengal in the modern states of Orissa
and Andhra Pradesh. Although the
Ganga dynasty was never more than a
regional power, it left an artistic legacy
in a series of stunning temples in mod-
ern Orissa. The Ganga dynasty was
responsible for the temple to the god
Jagannath in the city of Puri and the
Sun Temple at Konarak, built by king
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264). The
dynasty also built temples scattered
throughout the modern city of
Bhubaneshvar, including the temple to
the god Shiva as Tribhuvaneshvar, “the
Lord of the Triple World,” from which
the city takes its name.Ganges

Gangaikondacholapuran
Temple town in the eastern part of Tamil
Nadu, about forty-five miles north and
east of the city of Tanjore. This was one
of the temples in the Tanjore region built
by the Chola kings during their era of
preeminence between the ninth and
thirteenth centuries. The temple at
Gangaikondacholapuran was built in
[[1025]]
 by King Rajendra I (r. 1014–1042)
to commemorate his march to the
Ganges in 1023 after vanquishing the
king of Bengal. One of the images out-
side the temple door shows the kneeling
Rajendra being garlanded by the god
Shiva and his wife Parvati, doubtless
intended to give Rajendra divine sup-
port for his entitlement to rule. See also
Chola dynasty.
Ganga Sagar
Sacred site (tirtha) on Sagar Island,
which is located at the outer edge of the
Hugli River delta in the Bay of Bengal.
Ganga Sagar is where the Ganges River
merges with the sea (sagar). As with all
the places where the Ganges makes
some natural transition, this spot is con-
sidered especially holy. Ganga Sagar’s
biggest festival comes on Makara
Sankranti, the day in January when the
sun resumes its northward course. On
this day, hundreds of thousands of pil-
grims come to bathe (snana). The site is
also famous for a temple to the irascible
sage Kapila, whose fiery power inciner-
ates the 60,000 sons of King Sagar and
sets in motion a series of events leading
to King Bhagirath bringing the Ganges
down to earth.
Ganges
Northern Indian river that has its source
in various small rivers in the Himalaya
Mountains. It comes onto the northern
Indian plain at the city of Haridwar,
flows east across the state of Uttar
Pradesh to the city of Allahabad, where
it unites with the Yamuna River, and
then flows east through the states of
Bihar and West Bengal before joining
the sea at Ganga Sagar. At 1,560 miles in
length, the Ganges is shorter than many
other major rivers, but for Hindus no
river carries greater religious signifi-
cance. To pious Hindus the Ganges is
not merely a river, but the goddess
Ganga come down from heaven, and by
whose touch they are purified of all sin
and defilement. For the Ganges no
superlatives are spared—every drop is
sacred, every inch along its banks is

Gangotri
Temple in Gangotri. Located in the Himalayas,
Gangotri is traditionally considered the source of the Ganges River.
holy, and one gains great religious merit
by seeing it, drinking from it, touching
it, or merely by thinking about it. It is
also considered the best place to per-
form certain rites for the dead.
Hindu devotion to and reverence for
the Ganges has established it as a place
of unique importance. The religious
importance of the Ganges is reflected in
the religious practices connected with it
and the many well-known pilgrimage
places (tirtha) that are found on its
banks, particularly the city of Benares.
The Ganges is considered the paradigm
for the sacred river. Other Indian sacred
rivers, such as the Godavari and the
Cauvery, are claimed to “be” the
Ganges—that is, one can gain the
same religious benefits from bathing
(snana) in them that one gains by
bathing in the Ganges.
Gangotri
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Himalayas at
the headwaters of the Bhagirathi River,
one of the Himalayan tributaries of the
[[240]]

Ganges. Ritually speaking, Gangotri is
considered to be the source of the
Ganges, although the river’s actual
source is the glacier at Gaumukh,
another twelve miles upstream. Its high
altitude also means that it is only acces-
sible between late April and October,
after which it is closed for the winter
months. One ritual center in Gangotri
is the river itself, in which pilgrims
bathe (snana), braving the frigid
waters. The other center is the temple
to the goddess Ganga, first built about
[[250]]
 years ago by the Gurkha monarch
Amar Singh Thapa and restored in the
late nineteenth century by the royal
house of Jaipur. By the side of the river
is a large stone slab, on which the sage
Bhagirath is said to have performed his
austerities to bring the Ganges down to
earth. As with all the places where the
Ganges makes some transition,
Gangotri is considered particularly
holy. Its sanctity is amplified because it
is difficult to get to and is only accessi-
ble during the summer months.Garhwal
Ganika
(“harlot”) In Hindu mythology, a figure
who serves as an example of the
boundless power of God’s grace and
the ease with which one can be saved
by even unconscious devotion. Ganika
is a notorious prostitute who devotes
little time or attention to religious life.
Her only pious act is to teach her pet
parrot to repeat the name of the god
Vishnu, and in trying to teach it she
repeats the divine name over and over
again. This continual repetition of the
name is enough to gain Vishnu’s grace.
Upon Ganika’s death, Vishnu’s ser-
vants rescue her from the minions of
Death and convey her to his celestial
realm, Vaikuntha.
Ganpatya
Sectarian Hindus who worship the god
Ganesh as their primary deity. Most
Hindus pay considerable homage to
Ganesh, in part because his status as
“Lord of Obstacles” (Vighneshvar) gives
him power to help or hinder human
endeavors. However, he is usually wor-
shiped as a secondary deity. The
Ganpatyas, in contrast, venerate Ganesh
as their primary deity and worship no
other deities. Most of the Ganpatyas live
in the state of Maharashtra, where a
network of shrines centered around the
city of Pune and the nearby village of
Chinchvad serves as their sacred center.
The Ganpatya sect was founded by the
sixteenth-century figure Moraya Gosavi,
whose spiritual initiation came through
a series of visions of Ganesh. One of his
visions revealed that partial incarna-
tions of Ganesh would be born in
Moraya’s family for seven generations.

Garbhadhana Samskara
The first of the sixteen traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras)
performed at important moments
throughout one’s life. The Garbhadhana
Samskara was performed to ensure the
conception of a child. This rite was per-
formed on a specific day following the
onset of the wife’s menstrual period,
although different sources specify dif-
ferent days. Although part of this rite
obviously involved sexual intercourse
between husband and wife, as a whole it
was meant to create a sacred context for
the act of procreation.
Garbhagrha
(“womb-house”) In traditional Hindu
architecture, the garbhagrha is the
inner sanctum of a temple, which con-
tains the image of the temple’s primary
deity. In the Nagara architectural style
found in northern and eastern India—in
which the whole temple building culmi-
nates in one highest point—the garbha-
grha was located directly below the
summit of the highest tower (shikhara).
In the Dravida style found in southern
India—in which the temples are shorter,
but tend to sprawl over vast areas—the
garbhagrha’s location is marked by a
tower higher than the rest of the roof.
Garhmukteshvar
Sacred site (tirtha) on the Ganges River
in the Ghaziabad district of the state of
Uttar Pradesh about sixty miles due
east of Delhi. Garhmukteshvar’s primary
temple is dedicated to the god Shiva in
his form as the “Lord of Liberation”
(mukteshvar), but the site’s major
importance comes from its location on
the Ganges as a place for bathing
(snana) and performing memorial rites
(shraddhas) for the dead. Large crowds
gather there to bathe on festival days,
particularly on Kartik Purnima, the full
moon in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November).
Garhwal
In the most technical sense, Garhwal is
the name of a particular hill district in
the northern Indian state of Uttar
Pradesh. Garhwal is more commonly
used as the name for a cultural region in
the Uttar Pradesh hills, made up of the
[[241]]
Garibdas
districts of Garhwal, TehriGarhwal,
Dehra Dun, Chamoli, and Uttarkashi.
The Garhwal region contains all the
major tributaries of the Ganges: the
Bhagirathi, the Mandakini, the
Pindara, and the Alakananda. It also
contains many of the holiest sacred sites
(tirthas) in the Himalayas, including
Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and
Badrinath. In the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries, under the patronage of
the king of the state of Tehri, the region
was also one of the centers for the
Pahari school of miniature painting.
Garibdas
(early 18th c.) Founder of the Garibdasi
religious community. Garibdas was born
in the Rohtak district in what is now the
state of Haryana. Garibdas did not have
a human guru. Instead, he claimed to
have received his religious initiation
from the poet-saint Kabir, who
appeared to him in a dream. Garibdas
was a householder, as were his immedi-
ate disciples. Under one of their later
leaders the Garibdasis renounced their
possessions and became an ascetic
community. Garibdas preached and
taught on a number of subjects and was
a well-respected and influential reli-
gious reformer.
Garibdasi
Religious community founded by
the religious reformer Garibdas (early
[[18]]
th c.). The Garibdasi community
was originally made up of household-
ers, but was fundamentally altered by
one of the later leaders, Swami
Dayaludasa. Under his direction, the
community renounced their posses-
sions and became an ascetic sect. The
Garibdasis have more than one hun-
dred centers in northern India, mainly
concentrated in the regions of Uttar
Pradesh and Haryana around pre-
sent-day New Delhi, where Garibdas
lived during his life.
[[242]]

Garuda
A mythical bird, often portrayed as an
Indian kite or eagle. All of the Hindu
deities have animal “vehicles,” who are
their symbols and their associates.
Garuda is considered the vehicle for the
god Vishnu. As Vishnu’s vehicle, Garuda
reflects some of the protective, life-
affirming qualities associated with
Vishnu. Garuda is the son of the sage
Kashyapa and the divine maiden Vinata.
The most famous story associated with
Garuda explains the proverbial antipathy
between eagles and snakes. Vinata has
given birth to a line of eagles, whereas
her sister Kadru has engendered a line of
serpents. One day the sisters get into an
argument about the tail color of a certain
celestial horse—Vinata argues that it is
white and Kadru asserts that it is black.
They finally agree that the person who is
wrong will become a slave to the other. To
ensure her victory, Kadru persuades a
number of her children to hang from the
back of the horse, which from a distance
makes the white tail appear to be black.
When Vinata sees the black snakes, she
accepts her defeat and has to serve Kadru
under extremely harsh conditions for
many years. When Garuda learns what
has happened, he embarks on an endless
program of killing snakes.
Gauda
One of the five northern brahmin com-
munities (Pancha Gauda); the other
four are the Kanaujias, the Maithilas,
the Utkalas, and the Saraswats. Gauda
brahmins are most numerous in the
western half of northern India, particu-
larly in the western parts of the states
of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh,
in the state of Haryana, and in the state
of Rajasthan.
Gaudapada
(5th c.?) Philosopher and textual
commentator traditionally said to be
the grand-teacher of the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Shankaracharya
maintained that Gaudapada was aGaura
proponent of Advaita Vedanta, one
of the six schools of classical Hindu
philosophy, despite Gaudapada’s simi-
larities to certain Buddhist positions.
Gaudapada’s most famous work is a
commentary on the sacred text called
the Mandukya Upanishad.
Gaudapada
(2) (5th–8th c.) Philosopher and
commentator in the Samkhya school,
one of the six schools of classical Hindu
philosophy. Gaudapada is best known for
his commentary on the Samkhyakarikas,
the foundational text of the Samkhya
school, which is ascribed to the philoso-
pher Ishvarakrishna.
Gaudiya Vaishnava
Religious community founded by the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533).
It takes its name from the ancient
name for Bengal (Gauda), and its
stress on the worship of the god
Vishnu. The community’s religious
practices and beliefs are founded in
Chaitanya’s ecstatic devotionalism. He
asserted that the path to religious
ecstasy is the repetitive recitation of
Krishna’s name, often while singing
and dancing in the streets. Chaitanya’s
religious charisma gained him many
followers, of whom the most important
were the Goswamis—the brothers
Rupa and Sanatana, and their nephew
Jiva. At Chaitanya’s command the
Goswamis went to live in Brindavan,
the village where Krishna is believed
to have grown up. The Goswamis’
descendants live there to this day. In
Brindavan, the Goswamis set about orga-
nizing and systematizing the philosophi-
cal foundation of Chaitanya’s ecstatic
experience. Although they conceived of
themselves as Chaitanya’s servants,
they are equally important in the com-
munity’s development. The Goswamis’
key philosophical doctrine was
achintyabhedabheda, the idea that
there was an “inconceivable identity
and difference” between the Supreme
Divinity (Krishna) and the human being
that renders the soul simultaneously
identical to and different from the divin-
ity. The Gaudiya Vaishnava community
is also famous for its exhaustive analysis
of devotion (bhakti) as an emotional
experience. They enumerated the differ-
ent ways to experience the love of god as
five modes of devotion. For further
information see Sushil Kumar De, Early
History of the Vaishnava Faith and
Movement in Bengal, 1961.
Gaumukh
(“cow’s mouth”) Sacred site (tirtha) high
in the Himalayas. It is located at the
glacier that is the actual source of the
Bhagirathi River, one of the tributaries
of the Ganges. Gaumukh is twelve miles
upriver from Gangotri, the place that is
ritually celebrated as the source of the
Ganges. In popular Hindu belief, the
Ganges is believed to issue from the
mouth of a cow, hence the name.
Gauna
This is the name for the ceremony of
taking a new bride into her marital
home for the first time. The addition of a
new bride marks an important change
for a family and is a time of both oppor-
tunity and danger. On one hand, it car-
ries the potential for great blessings,
since it is assumed that the bride and
groom will soon begin a family. On the
other hand, it also carries the threat of
danger since the addition of a new per-
son to the family brings the potential for
disruption. The bride and her new family
perform various rituals to ensure that
her addition to the family will be auspi-
cious and harmonious.
Gaura
Festival celebrated in central India that
climaxes on the first day of the bright or
waxing half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November), the day
after the festival of Diwali. The Gaura
festival celebrates the marriage of the
god Shiva and the goddess Parvati.
[[243]]
Gaurava
complexions—a prejudice that persists
in modern times.
Gaurikund
The Gauri-Shankar is a bead that is formed when
two seeds grow together naturally. Worn by devotees
of the god Shiva, it is believed to be a manifestation
of the union of Shiva and his wife Parvati.
Gaurava
(“[needless] complexity”) In Indian
logic, one of the faults to be avoided in
constructing and pursuing an argu-
ment. According to the principle of
“simplicity” (laghava), when one is pre-
sented with two equally plausible theo-
ries, one should choose the theory that
is easier to understand and makes the
fewest assumptions. The primary crite-
rion in evaluating any argument is the
validity of the argument itself, and it is
only after this has been satisfied that
one may raise objections based on com-
plexity or simplicity.
Gauri
(“fair”) Epithet of the goddess Parvati,
wife of the god Shiva. According to a
story from the Shiva Purana, a sectar-
ian text recounting the mythology of
Shiva, Parvati takes offense when
Shiva refers to her as Kali (“black”).
She performs harsh physical austeri-
ties (tapas) to accumulate the power to
rid herself of her dark complexion.
When this is accomplished, she
receives the epithet Gauri to signify
her new and lightened complexion.
This story illustrates the pervasive reli-
gious belief that physical hardship can
give one spiritual and even magical
powers, a conviction that is still found
in contemporary India. This brief story
also reveals the stigma that Indian
society attributes to people with dark
[[244]]

Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalaya Mountains of the state of
Uttar Pradesh. Gaurikund is located
about ten miles downstream from the
headwaters of the Mandakini River,
which is itself one of the Himalayan trib-
utaries of the Ganges. Gaurikund is the
end of the motorable road on the way to
Kedarnath, and after this pilgrims
must travel on foot. Gaurikund’s myth-
ic charter is connected with the god
Shiva and his wife Parvati. Parvati is
said to have performed harsh asceti-
cism at Gaurikund in order to gain
Shiva as her husband; after a long time
Shiva is pleased with Parvati, reveals
himself to her, and the two become
lovers in that place. According to local
geography, the place at which Parvati
lived during this time is marked by a
group of hot springs, which are another
of Gaurikund’s attractions.
Gauri-Shankar
A particular variety of rudraksha, a bead
made from the dried seed of the tree
Elaeocarpus ganitrus, which is consid-
ered sacred to Shiva. The rudraksha is
often strung into garlands and worn by
Shiva’s devotees (bhakta). The Gauri-
Shankar rudraksha is made when two
seeds grow together naturally. Although
the Gauri-Shankar is not as rare as cer-
tain other beads, it is unusual enough to
command a fairly good price. The Gauri-
Shankar is revered as a natural manifes-
tation of the divine couple, the goddess
Parvati (Gauri) and the god Shiva
(Shankar). It thus represents the total
presence of divinity in its eternal and its
dynamic aspects: Shiva as knowledge
and Parvati as Shakti or power.
Gautama
(6th c. B.C.E.) In Hindu mythology, one of
the seven sages whose name marks a
clan “lineage” (gotra); the others areGayawal
Kashyapa, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Bhrgu, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brah-
mins are believed to be descended from
these seven sages, with each family tak-
ing the name of its progenitor as its
gotra name. In modern times, these
gotra divisions are still important, since
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
A new bride adopts her husband’s
gotra after her marriage as part of her
new identity.
Gautama is most famous as the hus-
band of Ahalya. When he discovers that
the god Indra has slept with Ahalya,
he curses his wife to turn into stone
and curses Indra to have a thousand
vulvas on his body. Both curses are later
modified to reduce their severity. Ahalya
is turned to stone, but returns to life
when touched by the god Rama’s foot,
whereas
Indra’s
body
becomes
covered with a thousand eyes. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Gautama
(2) (3rd c. B.C.E. ?) Indian philosopher
who is traditionally cited as the author
of the Nyaya Sutras, the foundation of
the Nyaya philosophical school. The
Nyaya school is one of several schools
that seek to explain the cause of human
bondage in the cycle of reincarnation
(samsara) and how it can be overcome.
Gaya
Sacred site (tirtha) and city in the mod-
ern state of Bihar and capital of a dis-
trict by the same name. According to
Hindu mythology, this is the place
where the god Vishnu sacrifices a pow-
erful demon named Gayasura, having
promised the demon that the space cov-
ered by his body will be the holiest spot
on earth. Gaya is best known as a site to
perform various rites for the dead, par-
ticularly the memorial rites known as
shraddhas. Its sanctity is so well known
that it draws people from all over the
eastern part of India.
Gayasura
In Hindu mythology, the name of a very
powerful asura (demon). Gayasura per-
forms harsh asceticism (tapas), spurred
by the traditional Indian assumption
that to voluntarily endure physical suf-
fering brings one spiritual and magical
powers. Gayasura’s powers grow so
large that all the gods become con-
cerned that he might become powerful
enough to overthrow them. As the gods’
fears grow, the god Vishnu advises the
god Brahma to convince Gayasura to
allow his body to be sacrificed. Vishnu
promises Gayasura that the place where
he dies will become holier than all the
sacred sites (tirthas) in the world. The
spot where Gayasura’s body lies becomes
the holy place known as Gaya, which by
virtue of Vishnu’s boon is claimed to be
holier than all other places on earth. See
also magic.
Gayatri Mantra
A particular verse from the Rg Veda
(3.62.10), the oldest Hindu religious text;
this verse is written in the poetic meter
named gayatri, hence its name. The
verse itself is an invocation to the sun
and can be translated “let us meditate
on the sun, most excellent of all the
deities, may he inspire our minds.”
Reciting the Gayatri mantra is part of the
morning and evening worship (sand-
hya) prescribed for every “twice-born”
man who has received the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” An important part of this ini-
tiation is the transmission of this
mantra to the young man. Although the
Gayatri must be recited every day, it
should not be recited over water; in
earlier times this was one reason why
many orthodox Hindus were reluctant
to travel abroad.
Gayawal
Endogamous group of pilgrimage
priests (pandas) who live in Gaya, a pil-
grimage place (tirtha) famous as a site
for rites for the dead. Each Gayawal family
[[245]]
Gemstones
has exclusive hereditary rights to serve
all the pilgrims whose ancestral homes
lie in a particular region or regions,
regardless of where those pilgrims may
be living at the time. As at all pilgrimage
sites, pilgrims are supposed to be served
only by their hereditary family priest.
This monopoly gives the Gayawals
greater leverage in negotiating fees
with their pilgrim clients, who are in a
vulnerable position since most of them
have come to perform rites for dead rel-
atives. The Gayawals are notorious for
their rapaciousness, greed, and general
lack of learning. These qualities render
them somewhat debased by brahmin
standards, as does the fact that they
make much of their income from the
dead, which is considered inauspi-
cious. In fairness to the Gayawals, the
relative power derived from this
monopoly is also balanced by a sense of
hereditary obligation to their clients—
the perennial issue is never whether the
clients will be served, but how much
they will have to pay.
Gemstones
In Hindu astrology, gemstones are used
to strengthen, neutralize, or counteract
the celestial influence of certain plan-
ets. Hindu astrology recognizes nine
planets, each of which is associated with
a particular gemstone: sun (ruby),
moon (pearl), Mars (coral), Mercury
(emerald), Jupiter (topaz), Venus (dia-
mond), Saturn (sapphire), Rahu (agate),
and Ketu (turquoise). Each of these nine
planets is considered to be a minor deity
and to have a distinct personality and
characteristics. When deciding which
gemstones to wear, one must make cer-
tain astrological considerations, partic-
ularly the position of the planets in one’s
natal horoscope (janampatrika), which
is believed to reveal each planet’s influ-
ence. These gemstones are worn
in rings, with the base of the stone
in contact with the skin to give the
gemstones their efficacy over their
planetary counterparts.
[[246]]

Gesture, in Dance and Drama
Gestures in Hindu dance and drama
are divided in two categories: hasta,
which are broad positions of the arms
and hands; and mudra, which are
stylized hand gestures, usually with
specific meanings.
Ghanta
A handbell. These bells typically have a
long straight handle projecting upward
from the top and are usually rung with
the bell part projecting from the bot-
tom of the closed hand. Ringing bells is
an important element in Hindu wor-
ship (puja) and its pleasing sound is
one of the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas) given to the deity as part of
worship. Many different deities are pic-
tured with bells in Hindu iconography,
but it is particularly associated with the
goddess Kali, whose roaring voice is
equated with a tolling bell.
Ghat
In its broadest meaning, a ghat is a
bathing (snana) place by a body of
water, such as a river, lake, or pond. The
word ghat is also commonly used to
refer to the permanent structures that
have been built at these bathing places.
They usually include a flat area at the
water’s edge, where people can walk,
stand, or sit. A set of steps leads from the
platform into and below the surface of
the water. Constructing a ghat is often
considered a pious act that generates
religious merit. This is particularly
true in pilgrimage places (tirtha),
where ghats are often centers for public
religious life.
Ghatika
In traditional Indian timekeeping, a
ghatika is a period of twenty-four min-
utes. There are sixty in each twenty-four
hour day. The ghatika gets its name
from the clay pots (ghata) that were used
to make water-clocks; these water-
clocks measured the time by allowingGiri Dashanami
water to drip out from the pot through a
small hole.
Ghatotkacha
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Ghatotkacha is
a son of Bhima, one of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. Ghatotkacha’s mother is
a rakshasi (female demon) named
Hidambi; Bhima’s carnal relations with
a nonhuman being are one sign of his
earthy and unsophisticated personali-
ty. As the offspring of a rakshasi and
the strongest Pandava, Ghatotkacha is
a massive physical specimen. He is a
staunch ally to the Pandavas all his life
and fights valiantly on their behalf dur-
ing the war between the Pandavas and
their cousins the Kauravas, destroying
large parts of the Kaurava army. He
fights several times with the hero
Karna, but is finally killed when Karna
uses a magic weapon known as
Vaijayanti Shakti.
Ghora
(“terrifying”) Term used to refer to
Hindu deities in their frightful, terrify-
ing, and powerful aspects, as opposed to
their benevolent (saumya) manifesta-
tions. This distinction is particularly
applicable to the god Shiva and the
forms of the Goddess, both of whom can
appear in either form, and devotees
(bhakta) can focus their worship on
either aspect.
Ghosts
Popular Hindu culture generally accepts
the existence of ghosts and spirits, par-
ticularly of people who have died a vio-
lent or untimely death. Despite the
virtually universal belief in reincarna-
tion (samsara), it is generally accepted
that the spirits of people who have died
such deaths linger near where they lived
during their lives. Ghosts will usually
reveal themselves through disturbances,
misfortunes, or by appearing to family
members in visions or dreams. The family
will then take measures to appease
the spirit. Sometimes this is done by
sponsoring rituals or ceremonies. Other
times a family may prepare a shrine for
the ghost to inhabit. Such ghosts are
usually believed to have unsatisfied
desires—either they died prior to getting
married or having children, or they
started major enterprises they were
unable to finish. People who have lived
long lives and fulfilled all the major
human goals will not become ghosts.
Ghrneshvar
(“Lord of Compassion”) One of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a group of images of
the god Shiva that are deemed particu-
larly holy and powerful. Shiva is believed
to be uniquely present at these places.
This particular jyotirlinga is located in
the village of Velur in the state of
Maharashtra, and is also known as
Dhushmeshvar. This site is unusual
because the form of Shiva that resides
here is known by two different names
and has no unequivocal charter myth.
At none of the other jyotirlingas is there
any doubt about the presiding deity’s
form or how it came to be there. This
indicates that Ghrneshvar is a minor
site, perhaps one simply filling out
the catalog of the jyotirlingas to get
the number up to twelve. Despite
this apparent lack of importance,
Ghrneshvar is arguably the most-visited
of the jyotirlingas. It is only a few
miles from the world famous cave
temples at Ellora and is a regular stop
on the local tourist circuit. The temple is
fairly small but is well kept and very
impressive. Male visitors are required to
remove their shirts before entering
Shiva’s presence.
Giri Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The
Dashanamis were supposedly estab-
lished by the ninth-century philosopher
Shankaracharya, in an effort to create
[[247]]
Giridhara
Jain temple in Girnar. Settled atop a hill, Girnar is an ancient site
that is sacred to both Hindu and Jain religious communities.
a corps of learned men who could help
to revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divi-
sions is designated by a different
name—in this case, giri (“mountain”).
Upon initiation, new members are
given this name as a surname to their
new ascetic names, thus allowing for
immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are collect-
ed into four larger organizational
groups: Anandawara, Bhogawara,
Bhuriwara, and Kitawara. Each group
has its headquarters in one of the four
monastic centers (maths) supposedly
established by Shankaracharya. Each of
the four groups is also associated with
one of the four Vedas—the oldest Hindu
sacred texts, a different geographical
quarter of India, a different great utter-
ance
(mahavakya),
and
a
different ascetic quality. The Giri
Dashanamis belong to the Anandawara
group, which is affiliated with the Jyotir
math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath.
[[248]]

Giridhara
(“mountain-lifter”) In Hindu mythology,
a youthful and heroic form of the god
Krishna. According to the story, as a
young man Krishna observes that the
village elders make yearly offerings to
Indra, the god of the storm. After some
persuasion, Krishna manages to con-
vince the elders that instead of making
offerings to Indra, who is too far off in
heaven to do them any good, they
should offer them instead to Mount
Govardhan. This mountain looms over
their village as a symbol of their pros-
perity, and since Krishna’s devotees
(bhakta) consider this mountain to be
another form of Krishna, he is actually
persuading the elders to make offerings
to him. Indra is furious when he discov-
ers what has happened, and unleashes a
violent storm that threatens to wash
away the village and destroy all the
inhabitants. To protect the villagers and
their cattle from harm, Krishna lifts up
Mount Govardhan, and holds it over
their heads as an umbrella to protect
them from the rain. After seven days,
Indra admits defeat, and Krishna
emerges as the hero of the village. ThisGitagovinda
story illustrates the gradual eclipse
of the older Vedic deities. The figure
of Krishna as Giridhara is widely
worshiped in Rajasthan and is particu-
larly noteworthy as the “chosen deity”
(ishtadevata) of the poet-saint Mirabai.
Girnar
Sacred site (tirtha) on a hill outside the
city of Junagadh in the state of Gujarat.
Girnar has been a holy site for at least
[[2]]
,000 years and remains an important
place for several religious communities.
The hill’s summit is an important pil-
grimage site for the Jains and has a clus-
ter of Jain temples, some of them dating
back to the twelfth century. It also has a
long history as a center for Hindu
ascetics—the Brahmachari Sanyasis
(Brahmacharin) have an ashram there,
and the summit is said to have a set of
footprints left by Dattatreya, a famous
mythic figure who is considered a partial
avatar of the god Vishnu and a
paradigm for asceticism. Girnar is the
site of a large Hindu ascetic gathering
on Kartik Purnima, the full moon
in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November).
Gitagovinda
(“Govinda’s Song”) Lyric poem written
in the twelfth century by the poet
Jayadeva. Written in an era when ver-
nacular languages were becoming the
prevalent vehicle for devotional religios-
ity, the Gitagovinda is one of the last
great devotional (bhakti) texts com-
posed in Sanskrit and is an exquisite
example of Sanskrit poetry. According to
tradition, Jayadeva was associated with
the temple to Jagannath in the eastern
Indian city of Puri, and his wife
Padmavati was a dancer at the same
temple. The Gitagovinda is a devotional
poem to the god Jagannath. The text was
obviously meant to be sung, since its
twenty-four cantos are set in various dif-
fering musical modes (ragas), each of
which conveys a different emotion. The
text has also been expressed through
dance for at least 500 years in the Orissi
dance style that originated in the
Jagannath temple. The Gitagovinda is
still used in the daily worship of
Jagannath and occupies a position held
by no other literary text.
The Gitagovinda is an allegory of
the union of the human soul with God.
This union is described through the
story of the love between the god
Krishna and his human consort Radha
as they experience an initial flush of
passion, followed by jealousy, separa-
tion, reconciliation, and reunion.
Although Jayadeva’s text lavishly
employs the images from Sanskrit love
poetry, it is far more than a romantic
novel. The poem was written to show
that Krishna is the lord of the entire uni-
verse. The first cantos after the introduc-
tion, the Dashavatara Stotra, pay
homage to Krishna in his ten avatars or
earthly incarnations (Dashavatar), each
of whom is instrumental in preserving
the cosmic equilibrium. Although
Krishna is considered an avatar of the
god Vishnu in many parts of the Hindu
tradition, Krishna is the supreme deity
for Jayadeva. The place usually occupied
by Krishna in the enumeration of the
avatars is taken by Krishna’s brother,
Balarama. The song that follows contin-
ues this theme, giving the divine attrib-
utes of Krishna as Vishnu, and further
emphasizing that the entire Gitagovinda
describes the deity’s divine play (lila).
Having set the appropriate context in
the opening songs, Jayadeva’s text
returns to a more conventional tale of
romantic love. The next chapter
describes the symbols of spring, which
are intended to evoke a mood of love. Yet
this mood is marred by Radha’s jealousy
when Krishna sports with a troop of
cowherd girls, for she desires Krishna for
herself alone. She withdraws and sits
apart, sulking and despondent, only to
burst into rage when Krishna comes to
meet her, bearing the signs of another
erotic liaison. Her anger and dismissal
make Krishna realize what he has done.
He eventually succeeds in dispersing
her anger, and convinces Radha of his
[[249]]
Goa
love. They reconcile and make passion-
ate love. The text ends by describing
their love play in the afterglow, in which
Radha orders Krishna to ornament her
as she wishes, showing her complete
power over him.
As a text, the Gitagovinda can be read
on many different levels simultaneously.
The themes of love, betrayal, and recon-
ciliation speak easily to everyday human
experience, but the theological and
mystical levels are always present. In the
end, deity and devotee (bhakta) are
described as needing and loving
one another. Neither is complete with-
out the other. Radha’s demand for exclu-
sive love is at first denied, but in the end
her persistence and conviction are
rewarded. The Gitagovinda has been
masterfully translated by the late
Barbara Stoller Miller as The Love Song
of the Dark Lord, 1977.
Goa
One of the smallest states in modern
India. It lies between the states of
Maharashtra and Karnataka on the
shore of the Arabian Sea. Goa was a
Portuguese colony for more than 400
years and did not become a part of the
Indian union until 1961, when India
engineered a nearly bloodless takeover.
Goa still retains much of its Portuguese
influence—in its food, easygoing pace,
and the continuing presence of Roman
Catholicism—which makes it one of the
most unusual cultural areas in India. For
general information about Goa and all
the regions of India, an accessible refer-
ence is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Gobind Deo Mandir
A temple built in 1590 in Brindavan, the
town believed to be the god Krishna’s
childhood home. The temple is dedicated
to Krishna in his form as the “Divine
Cowherd.” From an architectural per-
spective, the temple is unique for its
vaulted ceiling, which is seldom found
in Hindu temples. The temple’s interior
[[250]]

and exterior are also notable for their
almost complete lack of figural orna-
mentation, which is extremely unusual.
The temple is close to the major road
connecting Agra and Delhi. These are
the two major political centers of the
Moghul empire (1525–1707), whose
rulers were Muslims. Since many ortho-
dox Muslims believe that figural repre-
sentations are idolatrous, particularly in
places of worship, the temple’s austere
style may have been an attempt to avoid
inciting Muslim iconoclasm. There is
evidence of conflict between Hindus
and Muslims at this site since the few
figures inside the temple, carved into
the lintels of door and windows, have
had their heads broken off. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Godana
(“gift of a cow”) In Hindu religious prac-
tice, gift giving (dana) is common and
believed to be a pious act that generates
religious merit. Godana is the gift of a
cow, usually to a brahmin. Traditional
religious texts highly laud the gift of
a cow, both as a charitable act and as
a way to expiate one’s sins. However,
since many of these texts were written
by brahmins, one can detect a hint
of self-interest.
Godavari
River running from west to east in cen-
tral India. The Godavari’s headwaters lie
in the state of Maharashtra on the
inland side of the western Ghats. It
meanders through that state to Andhra
Pradesh, where it enters the Bay of
Bengal. The Godarvi is traditionally
considered one of India’s seven sacred
rivers, along with the Ganges, Yamuna,
Cauvery, Saraswati, Narmada, and
Indus. The Godavari has special status
in central India, where it is often referred
to as the “Ganges”—the most sacred
river for Hindus. Although its entire
length is considered sacred, the
Godavari’s most important religious
sites are all in the west: Nasik,Goddess
A shrine in the Godavari River near the riverbank of Nasik.
Tryambakeshvar, and Paithan. See
also ghat.
Goddess
India is home to a host of different god-
desses. Although goddesses differ greatly
in demeanor and character, they are all
generally seen as expressions of a single
underlying female deity. This vision of
the goddess coincides with the charac-
teristic Hindu practice that allows for
multiple manifestations of a divinity,
while at the same time asserting his or
her underlying reality as a single entity.
Many of India’s goddesses are the deities
of a specific site, who might be wor-
shiped only in that specific place. Yet as
these local goddesses are all mythically
linked as differing forms of a single great
Goddess, the sacred sites (tirthas) are
also connected with this great Goddess.
The sites, called pithas or “benches,”
form a sacred network stretching
throughout the entire subcontinent.
The origins of the goddess cult
in India are uncertain. Excavations of
cities of the Indus Valley civilization
have unearthed female figures with
enormous breasts, hips, and buttocks.
These figures resemble the Venus of
Willendorf found in Bronze Age Europe
and suggest that there was some kind of
cult associated with women’s fertility.
Some interpreters have seen the Indus
Valley figures as proof that the cult of the
Mother Goddess originated in the Indus
Valley civilization, but hard evidence
supporting this claim is slim. Another
reason some interpreters believe that
goddess worship must have come from
the indigenous Indian culture is that the
deities mentioned in the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts, are almost
exclusively male. The female goddesses
in the Vedic hymns are infrequent and
unimportant—Ushas
(the
dawn),
Prthivi (the earth), and Nirriti (death
and destruction). But somehow female
divinities were elevated from virtual
obscurity and became conceived as the
reigning power in the universe.
The cult of the great Goddess
appears fully formed, seemingly out of
nowhere, in about the fifth century. She
first appears in the text known as the
Devimahatmya (“greatness of the
Goddess”), which is itself a section of the
[[251]]
Goddess
Markandeya Purana. The depth and
subtlety of her characterization in this
text leads scholars to infer that this
cult had existed for some time, per-
haps as a secret religious community
open only to initiates. The goddess in the
Devimahatmya is a powerful, indepen-
dent female force and is able to do what
the gods cannot. She is created from the
collected radiance (tejas) of all the gods,
and comes into the world to kill a
demon against whom the gods have
struggled in vain. The Devimahatmya’s
three different episodes portray her in
three different divine personas: as
Mahasaraswati in the slaying of the
demons Madhu and Kaitabha, as
Mahalakshmi in slaying a demon
named Mahishasura, and as Mahakali
in the battle against the demon generals
Shumbha and Nishumbha.
Many of India’s goddesses are the
patron deities of particular locales, and
are considered unique to that place. The
Shiwalik goddesses, for example, are
unique to particular sites in the
Shiwalik hills. At the same time, all of
these goddesses are considered different
manifestations of the same divine energy.
According to the sites’ charter myth,
each site is associated with a particular
body part of the primeval goddess. The
myth tells of the death of Sati, who com-
mits suicide when her father Daksha
insults her husband Shiva. Shiva picks
up Sati’s body and wanders the earth,
carrying her on his shoulders. In his
grief Shiva neglects his divine duties,
and the world begins to fall into ruin.
The other gods beg Vishnu for help, lest
the world be destroyed. Vishnu uses his
razor-sharp discus to cut off pieces of
Sati’s body, until finally there is nothing
left. When the body is completely gone,
Shiva goes to the mountains, where he
becomes absorbed in meditation.
Wherever a part of Sati’s body falls, that
place becomes a Shakti Pitha (“seat of
the Goddess”), sanctified to the Goddess
in a particular form. The number of
these places differs from source to
source—some list fifty-one, and others
[[108]]
. Whatever the number, the sites are
[[252]]

spread throughout the subcontinent,
from Baluchistan in modern Pakistan, to
Assam in the far east, to deep in south-
ern India. Each Shakti Pitha is associated
with a particular body part of the great
Goddess, has a particular presiding
female deity, and has a particular
Bhairava as a consort to that goddess.
From this perspective, the entire sub-
continent is seen as a single cohesive
unit, with the network of sites connect-
ed to one another as are the parts of the
body. Different places may claim the
same body part, the result of the drive to
establish a site and to give it prestige.
For example, Sati’s vulva, the most pow-
erfully charged part of the female body,
is usually accepted to have fallen at
Kamakhya in Assam, but the same
claim is made at Kalimath in the
Himalayas. There is no single authorita-
tive list of sites and competing claims
are not uncommon. Many Hindus seem
unconcerned with the seeming incon-
sistency of having the same body parts
claimed by different sites; perhaps this
reflects the conviction that the Goddess
is behind them all, and that the specifics
are therefore less important.
While some goddesses are only wor-
shiped in their particular locale, such as
the goddesses found in the Shiwalik
hills, other goddesses have become
more widely worshiped, and some have
become pan-Indian. In the pantheon,
the Goddess generally appears in two
widely differing types of manifestations.
At times she appears as a wife and mother,
in forms such as Parvati, Lakshmi, and
Saraswati. Although these married
goddesses are not completely powerless,
they tend to be benign, benevolent,
and auspicious. Her other manifestation
is in forms such as Durga and Kali,
whose male consorts are considered
subordinate to them. These indepen-
dent manifestations of the Goddess
have the power to help their devotees
(bhakta), but they are also volatile and
potentially dangerous, since their power
is sometimes unleashed without con-
trol. Cultural observers have suggested
that this dual perspective representsGodse, Nathuram
cultural perspectives on Indian women,
particularly the belief that women’s
procreative capacities should be
channeled through the safe, confining
bounds of marriage. Married women,
as wives and mothers, are auspicious,
life-giving, and life-sustaining because
their creative power has been regulat-
ed under male control. Unmarried
women remain a source of danger,
particularly to the family’s prestige,
since the quickest way to ruin a family’s
good name is through the corruption of
its women.
Godman
Colloquial name for a particular type of
charismatic Hindu ascetic. As religious
figures, godmen are generally character-
ized by a high-profile presence, by their
ability to attract attention and support
from the larger Indian society, and by
their claims to advanced spiritual
attainments. They sometimes claim to
possess magic powers—such as the
ability to heal, read minds, foretell the
future, or to influence future events—
which are exhibited to prove the god-
man’s spiritual attainments. Godmen
often come from outside the established
ascetic orders and may have never even
taken formal ascetic initiation. They are
able to flourish in the Indian religious
“free market,” which recognizes and
rewards religious charisma. Godmen
typically dwell in their own ashrams
rather than one belonging to an order.
Although most of them acknowledge a
guru or religious preceptor, their suc-
cess stems more from their personal
qualities than the strength of their spiri-
tual lineage. In recent years a number of
these godmen have cultivated large
numbers of foreign disciples, which can
bring both wealth and enhanced pres-
tige. One contemporary example of
such a godman is Sathya Sai Baba,
whose ashram is in Puttaparthi in the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh. For
an example of one person’s encounters
with a variety of these figures, see Peter
Ludwig Brent, Godmen of India, 1972.
Gods, World of the
The earliest reference to the transmigra-
tion of souls is found in both the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad (6.2) and
the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10). These
texts make a qualitative distinction
between two different paths. The path to
the world of the gods ultimately led to
the sun, and the person traveling it did
not return again, whereas the path to
the world of the fathers led to the
moon, and the person traveling it was
eventually reborn on earth. The leitmo-
tiv of the Upanishads is the need for
individual spiritual realization, which is
the key to getting on the path to the
world of the gods. Those who gain this
realization attain the final and ultimate
end, whereas those who simply do good
deeds will return to earth, although their
good deeds will give them karmic bene-
fits. See also karma.
Godse, Nathuram
(1912–1948) Hindu nationalist figure
who is most famous as the assassin of
Mohandas Gandhi. Godse was a devoted
follower of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar,
whose articulation of Hindu national-
ism equated Hindu identity and Indian
patriotism. Savarkar and his followers
saw the partition of India in 1947 as the
“vivisection” of Mother India, dividing
her into India and Pakistan. Like many
of Savarkar’s followers, Godse was
enraged by Gandhi’s post-partition
efforts to protect Indian Muslims and to
influence the Indian government’s policy
toward Pakistan, particularly his hunger
strike to force the Indian government to
transfer to Pakistan a large sum of
money that had been promised. Filled
with the conviction that Gandhi had to
be stopped, Godse intercepted Gandhi
on the way to a prayer meeting, touched
his feet as a sign of respect, and then
shot him three times. Godse was tried
and executed for his action and is some-
times cited as a martyr by the most
ardent contemporary nationalists.
[[253]]
Gokarna
Gokarna
(“cow’s ear”) Sacred site (tirtha) in the
state of Karnataka on the shore of the
Arabian Sea, just south of Karnataka’s
border with the state of Goa. Gokarna is
most famous for a temple to the god
Shiva in his form as Mahabaleshvara,
the “exceedingly powerful Lord.”
According to the site’s charter myth,
Shiva intends to perform the work of
creation, but before he begins he
becomes rapt in meditation in the
depths of the earth. The god Brahma
grows impatient with the delay and car-
ries out the work of creation himself.
Shiva is enraged when he discovers what
has happened and is about to force his
way up through the earth, which will
create a terrible cataclysm. The earth
appears to Shiva in the form of a cow,
who begs him to rise to the surface
through her ear. It is claimed that a cave
at Gokarna is the remnant of that pas-
sage through which Shiva rose.
Gokhale, Gopal Krishna
(1866–1915) College professor, legisla-
tor, and reformist Hindu, who worked
for much of his life with his older con-
temporary, Mahadev Govind Ranade.
Unlike Ranade, whose position as a
judge barred him from active political
involvement, Gokhale spent the last fif-
teen years of his life as a legislator.
Thirteen of these years were spent as
Bombay’s Indian representative to the
Imperial Legislative Council, the highest
lawmaking body in India. Like Ranade,
Gokhale sought to influence British pol-
icy by working within established insti-
tutions, in this case through the British
colonial government. This willingness to
compromise brought him opposition
from leaders such as Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, who advocated stiffer, even vio-
lent opposition to British rule.
Gokulnath
(1551–1640) The third guru of the reli-
gious community known as the Pushti
Marg. Gokulnath inherited the mantle
[[254]]

of leadership from his father Vitthalnath,
who was the successor to his father
Vallabhacharya, the community’s founder.
During his tenure Gokulnath helped
solidify the religious community and
paid particular attention to its organi-
zation. He is best known for compiling
several hagiographic works describing
the careers of his father and grandfa-
ther, to provide an appropriately rever-
ent picture for their followers.
Gokulnath was also the moving force
behind a text named the Chaurasi
Vaishnavan ki Varta (“Account of
eighty-four Vaishnavas”), although the
actual text was probably compiled by
Gokulnath’s disciple Hariray. This text is
a sectarian hagiography describing the
lives of eighty-four paradigmatic
Vaishnavas, all of whom—at least
according to the text—were associates
and disciples of Vallabhacharya and
Vitthalnath. The text’s real purpose is
not to provide a biography, but to illus-
trate the importance of the Pushti Marg
and its leaders.
Golden Embryo
One of the earliest cosmological myths.
It first appears in the Rg Veda (10.121),
the oldest Hindu religious text.
According to this account, the universe
originally consisted of the Golden
Embryo (Hiranyagarbha). The Golden
Embryo stirred and evolved into
Prajapati, the creator of all things
and ruler over all creatures. In this story,
as with most other accounts of Hindu
cosmology, the cosmos originates
from a single source and is thus an
organic whole.
Golwalkar, Madhav Sadashiv
(1904–1973) Second sarsanghchalak
(“Supreme Leader”) of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS is a
conservative Hindu organization whose
express purpose is to provide the leader-
ship cadre for a revitalized Hindu India;
for most of its history it has character-
ized its mission as cultural, rather thanGopichand
religious or political. Golwalkar is a piv-
otal figure in RSS history. He took office
in 1940 upon the death of its founder,
Dr. K. B. Hedgewar, and guided it
through the tumultuous years sur-
rounding India’s independence. After
Mohandas Gandhi’s assassination by
the Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse
in 1948, the RSS and several other organi-
zations were briefly banned. Despite ini-
tial suspicions, the RSS has never been
implicated in Gandhi’s death. During
the ban the RSS continued to function
underground, and many of its leaders
became more politically active, a trend
that Golwalkar had earlier discouraged.
When the ban was rescinded in 1949,
the RSS began to exercise greater influ-
ence by forming and sponsoring affiliated
organizations, such as trade unions, stu-
dent organizations, charitable institu-
tions, and political parties. This trend
continued throughout the rest of
Golwalkar’s tenure, although he was far
less activist than his successor,
Balasaheb Deoras. For further informa-
tion see Walter K. Andersen and
Shridhar D. Damle, The Brotherhood in
Saffron, 1987; and Tapan Basu et al.,
Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags, 1993.
Gond
Tribal (adivasi) community in central
India. The Gonds are concentrated in
the state of Madhya Pradesh, particu-
larly in the hills on both sides of the
Vindhya Mountains, in the Kaimur
Range at the eastern border of Madhya
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and in the
Ramgarh Hills on the border of Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, and Bihar. Like most
tribal peoples, they tend to be quite
poor and eke out a living from subsis-
tence agriculture.
Gopala
(“protector of cows”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, reflecting his childhood occu-
pation as a cowherd. See Krishna.
Gopi
(feminine of gopa, “cow-keeper”) In
Hindu mythology, the gopis are the cow-
keeping women who are the god
Krishna’s companions in Braj, the
region south of Delhi in which Krishna is
believed to have spent his early life. The
gopis are the simple village women of
Braj, who keep the village cows, churn
the milk into butter for sale, and provide
Krishna with an adoring and familiar
presence as he grows up. They exclaim
over his beauty as an infant and they
endure his boyhood pranks—particu-
larly his continual theft of their hard-
earned butter. When he becomes an
enchanting adolescent, they respond
to the nightly call of his flute to join
him in the circular dance (ras lila) on
the shores of the river Yamuna.
Although the gopis are completely
devoted to Krishna and love him above
all else, their relations with him are
also devoid of any affectation or awe.
The gopis are simple country women,
and they treat Krishna as one of their
own. For example, they feel no qualms
about scolding him when he has stolen
their butter. Their intimate but unaffected
relationship with Krishna makes them
paradigms for the ideal devotee (bhakta).
For his part, Krishna is said to prefer this
sort of natural and spontaneous rela-
tionship to any sort of calculated wor-
ship. Krishna loves Braj more than any
other place on earth because the people
there treat him as one of their own.
Gopichand
Princely protagonist of The Song of
Gopichand, an allegorical adventure
that is much beloved throughout
northern India and has even spread to
Bengal where it is called The Song of
Manik Chandra . The story tells of the
trials of Gopichand, who loses his king-
dom through the vicissitudes of fate
but eventually regains it after numer-
ous trials and setbacks. Aside from the
song’s story, it is also embedded with
the ideas of the Nathpanthis, an ascetic
community supposedly founded by
[[255]]
Gopuram
Towering gopurams mark the gateways to the Brhadeshvar Temple in Tanjore.
Gorakhnath. Some members of this
community believed that perfecting
their bodies through yoga would make
them immortal. This idea appears in the
song through its description of
Gopichand’s mother Mayana, who has
power over Death himself. In some ver-
sions of the story Mayana’s religious pre-
ceptor is identified as a low-caste
sweeper, while in others it is the sage
Gorakhnath himself. Two versions of
this song have been translated by G. A.
Grierson in the Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, the first published in
[[1878]]
 and the second in 1885.
Gopuram
In the Dravida style of temple architec-
ture, which was mainly prevalent in
southern India, gopurams are the ornate
temple gateways in the center of the
temple’s perimeter walls. Temples built
in the Dravida style tend to be shorter
than temples built in the northern
Indian Nagara style, but compensate for
this by stretching over vast areas, often
forming towns in their own right. There
are usually four gopurams, one for each
[[256]]

of the cardinal directions; in some cases
these gopurams are ten stories tall and
can be seen for miles from the sur-
rounding countryside. The gopurams
were originally fortified gateways built
to restrict access to the temple, but in
present times their function is more
decorative. By dominating the skyline
around the temple—much like spires of
Gothic cathedrals—gopurams are a
pronouncement about the power of
the resident deities (and their client
rulers); they have also helped to educate
the faithful, since they are usually
covered with sculptures detailing
mythological themes.
Gora
(1267–1397?) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Gora was a potter, which by the stan-
dards of the time was a very low-status
occupation; Gora’s inclusion as one of
the Varkari saints helps underscore theGosain
devotional (bhakti) conviction that
birth status was less important than
genuine love of God. Gora is reported to
have lived most of his life at Teradhoki
village in the state of Maharashtra, but
since he is a minor Varkari figure, little is
known about his life. For further infor-
mation see G. A. Deleury, The Cult of
Vithoba, 1960; and Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories of
Indian Saints, 1982.
Obscure Religious Cults, 1962. See
also Maharashtri.
Gorakhnathi
Ascetic community who claim to be the
disciples of sage Gorakhnath and claim
to have conserved his teachings. These
ascetics are also known as the
Nathpanthis. See Nathpanthi.
Gorakhshatakam
Gorakhnath
(13th c.?) Medieval yogi and wonder-
worker who is the founder of the
Nathpanthi ascetics. There is little
doubt that Gorakhnath was a historical
person, and his teacher was named
Matsyendranath (also known as
Minanath). However, the accounts of his
life tell of him performing so many mir-
acles and wonders that they cannot be
taken as factual. He is generally believed
to have lived early in the thirteenth cen-
tury, since the Maharashtrian poet-saint
Jnaneshvar (1275–1296?) described his
own spiritual preceptor as one of
Gorakhnath’s disciples.
Tradition regards Gorakhnath not
only as a magician and a wonder-worker,
but also as the author of the
Gorakhshatakam. This text is a reli-
gious manual that gives instruction on a
specific type of yoga practiced
by Nathpanthi ascetics. The ultimate
goal of this yogic practice is to transform
the perishable elements in the physical
body into immortal elements. Whether
or not Gorakhnath authored this
text, the spiritual instructions therein
are consistent with those of the
Nathpanthi ascetics who claim to be
his disciples. According to legend,
Gorakhnath and his most accomplished
followers have never died, and their
victory over death is a sign of their
spiritual accomplishment. The most
complete source on Gorakhnath and
his followers, despite its age, is
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath
and the Kanphata Yogis, 1973;
and Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta,
(“Gorakh’s Hundred”) Text attributed to
the sage Gorakhnath. Although his
authorship is ultimately unprovable, its
teachings are consistent with those of
the Nathpanthi ascetics who claim to be
his disciples. In at least one of its forms,
as translated by Briggs, the text has 101
verses, not 100 verses as the title sug-
gests. The Gorakhshatakam gives
instruction on the type of yoga prac-
ticed by the Nathpanthi ascetics in
which the major motif is the union of
polar opposites. It begins with instruc-
tion on the structure of the subtle body,
an alternate physiological system that
resides on a different plane of existence
than gross matter, but possesses certain
correspondences to the material body.
The subtle body is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of the two divine princi-
ples, Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power). The aspirant aims to awaken a
latent spiritual energy residing in the
shakti called kundalini and move it to
union with the Shiva principle at the
crown of the head. The ultimate aim of
this practice is to gain control over the
forces that affect the body, allowing one
to become purified and immortal.
Gosain
Vernacular form of the Sanskrit word
goswami (“master of the senses”).
Although this epithet could be used to
refer to any ascetic, during British colo-
nial rule in the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries it was most commonly
[[257]]
Gosala Maskariputra
used to denote certain subgroups
among the Sanyasis, the ascetic devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. The
name was particular to Sanyasis at the
low end of the ascetic status scale, such
as the Nathpanthis or the Naga (mili-
tant) Sanyasis, who were often recruited
from the lower classes of society.
Gosala Maskariputra
(5th c. B.C.E.?) According to tradition, a
philosopher who was a contemporary of
the Buddha. Gosala is believed to be the
founder of the Ajivikas, an extinct reli-
gious community whose philosophical
position is generally described as fatal-
ism. In the Buddhist and Jain literature
he is generally referred to as Makkhali
Gosala (“cow-shed”), referring to his
lowly birth.
Goshala
(“abode of cows”) In modern India, a
goshala is a rest home for aged, infirm,
and unproductive cows, where they can
live for the rest of their lives in peace and
happiness. Goshalas are usually estab-
lished and supported as acts of religious
merit, to provide for cows that would
either be slaughtered or abandoned.
These institutions are built as a sign of
respect for cattle, which is one of the
most pervasive ideas in Hindu culture.
Goswami, Jiva
(ca. late 16th c.) A pivotal figure in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
along with his uncles Sanatana Goswami
and Rupa Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by the
poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstat-
ic devotionalism. The Goswamis were
southern brahmins by origin, but their
family had resettled in northern India.
Their lives were transformed when
Rupa and Sanatana met Chaitanya.
Chaitanya dispatched the brothers to
Brindavan, the village where the god
Krishna is believed to have spent his
[[258]]

childhood, with instructions to settle
there and reclaim it as a holy place. The
three Goswamis lived there for several
decades, reclaiming the sacred sites
(tirthas), having temples built, and
above all providing the ideas and insti-
tutions that defined the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community. Jiva was a ver-
satile scholar who wrote on many dif-
ferent aspects of Vaishnava devotion,
but is best known for his works on
metaphysics, which provide the com-
munity’s basic philosophical under-
pinnings. For further information see
Sushil Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal, from Sanskrit and Bengali
Sources, 1961.
Goswami, Rupa
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, a pivotal figure
in the establishment of the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community, along with his
brother Sanatana Goswami, and his
nephew Jiva Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic
devotionalism. Records indicate that the
Goswamis were brahmins whose fami-
lies originally hailed from the
Karnataka region. The family had set-
tled in Bengal, where Rupa and
Sanatana were in the service of a local
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched
the brothers to Brindavan, the village
where the god Krishna is believed to
have spent his childhood, with instruc-
tions to settle there and reclaim it as a
holy place. The three Goswamis lived
there for several decades, reclaiming the
sacred sites (tirthas), having temples
built, and above all providing the ideas
and institutions that defined the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community. Rupa
was a passionate devotee (bhakta) of
Krishna, but also had interests as a
dramatist and a scholar. In addition toGovardhan
writing poetry as a vehicle for expressing
devotion to Krishna, he also focused on
analyzing bhakti as an emotional expe-
rience. He is most famous for enumerating
the five modes of devotion, explaining
the different possible ways to experi-
ence the love of God. For further infor-
mation see Sushil Kumar De, Early
History of the Vaishnava Faith and
Movement in Bengal, 1961; and
Shrivatsa Goswami, “Radha” in John
Stratton Hawley and Donna Wulff (eds.),
The Divine Consort, 1982.
Goswami, Sanatana
(ca. mid-16th c.) A disciple of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, and a pivotal
figure in the establishment of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community, along
with his brother Rupa Goswami and his
nephew Jiva Goswami. Although the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas were founded by
the poet-saint Chaitanya, it was the
Goswamis who brought order and sys-
tematic thinking to Chaitanya’s ecstatic
devotionalism. Records indicate that the
Goswamis were brahmins whose fami-
lies originally hailed from the
Karnataka region. The family had set-
tled in Bengal, where Rupa and
Sanatana were in the service of a local
Muslim ruler. However, their lives were
transformed when Rupa and Sanatana
met Chaitanya. Chaitanya dispatched
the brothers to Brindavan, the village
where the god Krishna is believed to
have spent his childhood, with instruc-
tions to settle there and reclaim it as a
holy place. The three Goswamis lived
there for several decades, reclaiming the
sacred sites (tirthas), having temples
built, and above all providing the ideas
and institutions that defined the
Gaudiya
Vaishnava
community.
Sanatana was more of a devotee
(bhakta) than a scholar. This is evident
in his written works, which tend to
be either devotional songs or commen-
taries on religious texts. Sanatana’s most
famous text is the Hari-bhakti-vilasa
(“The delight of devotion to Hari”), for
which he wrote a commentary as well.
For further information see Sushil
Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal, 1961.
Gotra
A word for exogamous lineages.
Lineages are particularly stressed
among brahmins, although the status
associated with some lineages some-
times led other twice-born groups to
adopt them as well. The word literally
means “cow pen,” and by extension the
family is associated with a particular
herd of cattle. Brahmins were believed
to be descended from the seven sages—
Kashyapa, Vasishtha, Bhrgu, Gautama,
Atri, Bharadvaja, and Vishvamitra—
with each family taking as its gotra the
name of the sage believed to be its prog-
enitor. The only situation in which it was
really important was in marriages, since
marriage within the gotra was forbid-
den. After marriage, a woman would
adopt the gotra of her husband as part
of her new identity. Since this practice
was observed by brahmins, having
a gotra became something of a status
symbol. This led other twice-born
groups to imitate the brahmins and
adopt gotras as well.
Govardhan
Sacred mountain in the western part
of the Mathura district of the state of
Uttar Pradesh. According to Hindu
mythology, this was the mountain
that the god Krishna held up as
an umbrella over the Braj region to
protect its inhabitants from the storms
generated by the wrath of Indra, god
of the storm. According to the tradi-
tions of the Pushti Marg, a religious
community founded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531), a particular image of
Krishna called Shrinathji was discov-
ered by Vallabhacharya on Mount
Govardhan, after Krishna revealed its
location to the saint in a dream.
[[259]]
Govardhan Math
Govardhan Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
traditionally believed to have been estab-
lished by the great philosopher Shank-
aracharya; the others are the Sharada
math, Shringeri math, and Jyotir math.
These four sacred centers are each associ-
ated with one of the four geographical cor-
ners of the Indian subcontinent; the
Govardhan math is in the eastern quarter,
in the city of Puri on the shores of the Bay
of Bengal. Shankaracharya is traditionally
cited as the founder of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, the most prestigious Hindu
ascetic order. The Dashanami (“ten
names”) ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva and are divided into ten divi-
sions, each with a different name. These
ten divisions are organized into four larger
organizational groups—Anandawara,
Bhogawara, Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—
each of which has two or three of the ten
divisions and is associated with one of the
four sacred centers. Of these, the
Govardhan math is associated with the
Bhogawara group.
Govardhan Puja
Festival celebrated on the first day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November), the day after
the festival Diwali. The charter myth for
this festival comes from the mythology of
the god Krishna, and this festival is cele-
brated mainly in the Braj region south of
modern Delhi, where Krishna is said to
have lived. According to legend, this is the
day that Krishna lifted up Mount
Govardhan to protect the people of Braj
from the storms sent by the god Indra.
Indra was angry because Krishna had per-
suaded the village elders to make offerings
to Mount Govardhan, rather than to Indra.
Krishna held up the mountain as an
umbrella for an entire week, after which
Indra admitted defeat. On this day pilgrims
circle Mount Govardhan on foot. The
mountain is seen as a physical manifesta-
tion of Krishna himself, and because of
Krishna’s association with cattle, they also
adorn and worship cows and bulls. In
memory of the offerings given to Mount
[[260]]

Govardhan in that story, as well as the
mountain of offerings (particularly milk-
based sweets) that are prepared for cele-
bration in modern times, the festival is also
known as Annakut (“mountain of food”).
Govinda
(“gaining cows”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, referring to his childhood in
Braj as a cowherd. See Krishna.
Govindswami
(late 16th c.) One of the poets of the ash-
tachap, a group of eight northern Indian
bhakti (devotional) poets. The composi-
tions of these eight poets are used for
liturgical purposes by the Pushti Marg, a
religious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of Krishna. The
Pushti Marg named all eight poets as
members of the community and associ-
ates of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. Govindswami is believed to
have been an associate of Vitthalnath. In
his poetry, Govindswami writes from the
perspective of a companion (sakhi) to
Krishna’s consort Radha, and in this
voice not only gives a picture of the
divine activities, but also an extremely
detailed picture of everyday village life.
Grace
The notion of divine grace has been and
remains vitally important in Hindu devo-
tional religiosity (bhakti), although it is
perceived differently among the various
devotional movements in Hinduism. In
the Tamil devotionalism that marked the
earliest articulation of the bhakti move-
ment, the two major religious groups, the
Alvars and the Nayanars, both stressed
the utter transcendence of their chosen
god and the gulf between God and human
beings. In this understanding, grace
became something only God could give
freely. Only God had the power to trans-
form human beings and bring their souls
to final liberation—a notion of grace not
far removed from Christian ideas. Within
the Shrivaishnavas, a later southernGrand Bassin
The Grand Bassin, a mountain lake on the island of Mauritius. Just before the festival of Shivaratri,
crowds of people gather at this lake and draw water to offer to the god Shiva.
Indian religious community, there was a
debate whether liberation was primarily
achieved through one’s faith or one’s
works. The Tengalai school favored faith
and argued that liberation came from God
alone. In contrast, the Vadagalai school
favored a person’s works and countered
that humans had to respond to divine
grace in order for their souls to gain final
liberation. The importance of divine tran-
scendence and omnipotence, as articulat-
ed by Tamil devotionalism, has remained
an important part of Hindu piety, even to
the present time.
Southern Indian bhakti tended to
express the deity-devotee (bhakta) rela-
tionship using images of master and ser-
vant.
Northern
Indian
bhakti,
particularly that which focused on the
gods Rama and Krishna, stressed other
images of this relationship: friend and
friend, parent and child, lover and
beloved. These differing conceptions
necessarily influenced the notion of
grace, ranging from the idea of God as
other and saving power to the sacred
quality coming from sharing everyday
interactions. In the latter, grace is mani-
fested through being able to take part in
God’s divine play (lila), to play with God,
and thus take part in the divine world. In
this model, God is immanent rather
than transcendent, and divine activity
comes in the guise of sharing the ordi-
nary activities of human life. All of these
models can be found in modern Hindu
religious life, although certain ones are
more strongly associated with particular
groups or religious communities.
Grammarians
Philosophical school based in the
teachings of Bhartrhari (7th c. C.E.). The
Grammarians conceived of Brahman, the
Ultimate Reality, as being manifested in
sound, particularly the sound of the spo-
ken word. They centered their cult around
the word Om, a word that is described as
the source of all things in the Mandukya
Upanishad, an early speculative text. For
further information see Harold Coward
and K. Kunjunni Raja (eds.), The
Philosophy of the Grammarians, 1990.
Grand Bassin
Mountain lake in the southern part of
Mauritius, an island in the Indian
Ocean 1,200 miles east of the east
African coast. The Hindu population of
Mauritius have established sacred sites
(tirthas) in the landscape that often
[[261]]
Grhastha
relate or correspond to sacred land-
scape features on the Indian subconti-
nent. Grand Bassin is a remote and
high lake, which the Hindus on
Mauritius call the Ganges River. In the
days before the festival of Shivaratri
(February–March), great crowds of peo-
ple come to Grand Bassin. They bathe
(snana) in the lake, worship at the tem-
ples surrounding it, and then draw pots
of water from the lake and carry them
on foot back to their homes. The pil-
grims time their departures to arrive at
their homes on the evening of
Shivaratri, and the water is offered to
the god Shiva in their local temple. This
sort of rite can be found in several
places in India, most notably at
Vaidyanath in Bihar.
Grhastha
(“householder”) In the dharma litera-
ture, which gives instruction on reli-
gious practice and duties, a grhastha is
a “householder.” According to the
dharma literature, the grhastha is the
second of the four stages of life
(ashramas) in the life of a man born
into one of the three twice-born
groups—brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya—which have the highest reli-
gious and social status in Indian soci-
ety. The householder stage is preceded
by that of the brahmacharin or celi-
bate student, and succeeded by the
vanaprastha or forest-dweller, and the
sanyasi or wandering ascetic. In prac-
tical terms, for most men the house-
holder stage is the final stage of life,
since most men do not choose to move
beyond it. The householder stage
begins with marriage, and leads to
raising and supporting a family. This
stage is an active and fruitful time of
life, and the householder is indispens-
able to society since his labors and
resources support those in the other
three stages of life. This is also the only
stage of life in which sexual inter-
course is not explicitly forbidden,
since the general fruitfulness of this
stage of life is expressed through pro-
[[262]]

creation. A householder is permitted
to pursue three of the traditional aims
of life (purushartha): wealth (artha),
desire (kama), and religious duty
(dharma). Given the depth and rich-
ness of the householder’s life, it is not
surprising that many men have little
inclination to move on to the two
other stages.
Grhya Sutras
(“aphorisms on domestic [rites]”) The
name given to texts that outline correct
procedures for domestic religious cere-
monies, in particular the daily rites
connected with the domestic sacred
fire, and the life-cycle rites known as
the samskaras. The latter rites span
the time before birth to the memorial
offerings after death and are still
observed by many pious Hindus,
although the rites have been modified
over time. In theory, a Grhya Sutra
should be one part of a Kalpa Sutra,
which should also contain prescrip-
tions for Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras)
and for appropriate human behavior
(Dharma Sutras). In reality this doesn’t
always seem to be the case, since aside
from the three complete surviving
Kalpa Sutras, there are at least six
other Grhya Sutras, indicating that
these texts were composed indepen-
dently. See also Veda.
Guardians of the Directions
A collection of eight deities, each
associated with one of the four cardi-
nal and intermediate directions. In
their traditional order, the deities are
as follows: Indra for the east; Agni for
the southeast; Yama for the south;
Nirriti for the southwest; Varuna for
the west; Vayu for the northwest;
Kubera for the north; and Shiva for
the northeast. Most of these are
deities who were important in the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious
texts. Except for Shiva, they were
replaced as traditions changed and
have become minor deities in modernGujarat
Hindu religious life. These eight
deities protect the directions with
which they are associated. Each direc-
tion also carries certain associations
because of its presiding deity. For
example, south is generally consid-
ered an inauspicious direction
because it is associated with Yama, the
god of death.
Gudimallam Linga
A particular linga, or symbolic form
of the god Shiva. It is reliably dated
from the second century B. C . E . and is
arguably the oldest existing Hindu
image. It is named after the place in
which it is found, the village of
Gudimallam, which is in the south-
eastern corner of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, near the border with Tamil
Nadu. Despite its venerable age, the
linga is still enshrined in its original
temple and remains an object of wor-
ship. The linga itself is a five-foot pil-
lar of polished stone, which bears a
four-foot-high carving of Shiva on its
front side. The sculptural work is
quite detailed and shows several sur-
prising features. Shiva’s hair is woven
into a turban-like shape, rather than
in the usual matted locks. Shiva has
only two arms, rather than the multi-
ple arms one commonly finds in later
images. He carries a ram in his arms,
rather than a deer—the only sculp-
ture in which a ram appears. Finally,
the figure of Shiva has no sacred
thread (yajnopavit), which became
commonplace later. The linga is also
notable for the detailed work at the
top of the pillar, which exactly models
the head of an erect penis. This is also
a departure from later iconography,
in which the top of the linga is usual-
ly smoothly rounded. Although linga
worship should be interpreted sym-
bolically as an homage to the power
behind the universe, the object’s form
is clearly phallic.
Guha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Guha is the
king of the Nishadas, a tribe who lived
on the banks of the Ganges River.
When the god Rama goes into exile
with his wife Sita and his younger
brother Lakshmana, they pass
through Guha’s kingdom. Guha
arranges for a boat to take them to the
other side of the Ganges and person-
ally conveys the three over to the other
side. Although Guha is of very low
social status, his humble services are
accepted because of his sincere devo-
tion to Rama. In the Ramayana of
Tulsidas, a later vernacular rendition
of the Ramayana that emphasizes the
power of devotion, Guha symbolizes
how sincere devotion can transcend
all social boundaries.
Gujarat
Modern Indian state, located on the
Arabian Sea at the border with
Pakistan. Gujarat is one of the so-
called linguistic states formed after
Indian independence to unite gov-
ernment people with a common lan-
guage and culture (in this case,
Gujarati). It was formed in 1960 by
splitting what was Bombay into the
present states of Gujarat and
Maharashtra. Gujarat’s presence by
the sea has given the area a long his-
tory as a trading center, beginning as
the port of Lothal in the Indus Valley
civilization, one of the earliest, highly
developed urban cultures.
Most of the Indians who migrated
to Kenya, Uganda, and other parts of
East Africa are Gujaratis; substantial
numbers of Gujaratis have migrated to
the United Kingdom and the United
States, especially New York City.
Gujarat is also famous as the birth-
place of Mohandas Gandhi. The
Sabarmati Ashram near the city of
Ahmedabad in Gujarat was his home
base during much of the struggle for
independence. Gujarat is also famous
for several prominent holy places:
[[263]]
Gujarati
Guler was the birthplace of the Pahari style of miniature painting.
This Pahari painting depicts the god Rama killing a female demon.
Dwaraka, which is the site of
Krishna’s mythical kingdom, as well as
the location of the Sharada math of
the Dashanami Sanyasis religious
community; Somnath, which is one of
the twelve sites where Shiva,
in his first manifestation as the
jyotirlinga, came to earth; and
Girnar, which is famous as a dwelling-
place for ascetics. For general
information about Gujarat and all
the regions of India, an accessible
reference is Christine Nivin et al.,
India. 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Gujarati
One of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are the Maharashtris,
Karnatas, Andhras, and Dravidas.
As their name indicates, the core region
for Gujarati brahmins is the modern
state of Gujarat.
[[264]]

Gujjar
In traditional northern Indian society,
the Gujjars were a jati whose heredi-
tary occupation was herding cattle,
buffalo, and other livestock. Jatis
were endogamous subgroups in
traditional Indian society that
were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation.
Guler
Historical site in the Shiwalik hills,
the foothills of the Himalaya
Mountains. In the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries these hills were
the home to many small kingdoms,
which served as important sites for the
development of arts and culture. In
Guler, the Pahari style of miniature
painting first appeared in its devel-
oped form. The developed Pahari style
differs from the earlier Rajasthani
style in its emphasis on more linear
drawing—perhaps influenced byGuptakashi
European art—and a more restrained
use of color, both of which tend to give
the paintings a more lyrical feel.
Guna
(“quality”) A fundamental concept that
originated in the Samkhya philosophi-
cal school, but has become one of the
key ideas in the Hindu worldview. The
word guna literally means “strand,” and
by extension a “quality,” of which there
are believed to be three: sattva (“good-
ness”), rajas (“passion”), and tamas
(“darkness”). According to the Samkhyas,
in the time before the evolution of
prakrti (primal matter), these three
qualities were in perfect equilibrium.
As mental activity began to disturb the
balance, prakrti evolved into the sub-
jective self and the objective world. All
things and beings in the world have
these three basic qualities, but their
nature and tendencies differ according
to the differing proportions. The quali-
ty sattva is always positive and carries
associations with goodness, truth,
wholesomeness, health, cognitive thought,
and deep-rooted religious life. The
quality tamas is always negative and is
associated with darkness, ignorance,
sloth, spoilage, and death. Rajas can
be either positive or negative,
depending on the context. It is nega-
tive when one becomes a slave to
one’s passions, blinding one to careful
and conscious thought. However,
one’s passions can also help to engen-
der activity and industriousness.
Although much of Samkhya meta-
physics has been long discredited, the
notion of all things drawing their ten-
dencies from the differing proportion of
these three gunas has become an
accepted part of Indian culture.
Gupta Dynasty
(ca. 350–550) Northern Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in the
lower Ganges River basin. The Gupta cap-
ital was initially at Pataliputra, identified
with the city of Patna in the modern state
of Bihar, but was later moved to the city
of Allahabad, which lies at the conflu-
ence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.
At its zenith under Chandra Gupta II,
the Guptas controlled all of northern
India and modern Pakistan, as well as
the eastern Coromandel Coast all the
way south to modern Madras. The
Gupta reign is associated with an efflo-
rescence of Indian culture, and with the
revival of Hinduism in northern India.
The force behind both of these trends
was the royal patronage of the Gupta
kings. According to tradition, one of
their court poets was Kalidasa, who is
considered the greatest Sanskrit poet.
The Guptas are also characterized as
ardent devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, a devotion they displayed
through temple building and religious
endowments. Aside from Chandra
Gupta II, the dynasty’s most famous
rulers were his father Samudra Gupta
and his grandfather Chandra Gupta I.
Guptakashi
(“hidden Kashi”) Village and sacred site
(tirtha) in the Himalaya Mountains of
the state of Uttar Pradesh. Guptakashi
is located on the Mandakini River, one
of the Himalayan tributaries that com-
bine to create the Ganges River. The
site’s charter myth is connected to the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are the
protagonists of the epic Mahabharata.
According to local legend, the Pandavas
went to Benares (also known as Kashi)
seeking an audience with the god Shiva,
but Shiva slipped away and hid in
Guptakashi. Guptakashi’s two holiest
sites are temples to Shiva. At one of
these temples, Shiva is worshiped in his
form as Vishvanath, the “Lord of the
Universe,” who is the presiding deity at
the most important temple in Benares.
The other is dedicated to his form as
Ardhanarishvara, in which the left side
of the image has female form, dress, and
ornamentation, whereas the right side is
male. The local claim that Guptakashi is
a “hidden” Kashi shows the fluidity of
the Indian sacred landscape, in which
[[265]]
Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty
the sacredness of one place can be
appropriated by another. This is a way to
claim some of the splendor of Kashi as a
sacred site and to attribute power to a
much smaller and more remote site.
Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty
(7th–11th c.) Northern Indian dynasty
that filled the political void created by
the collapse of the Pushyabhuti dynasty
late in the seventh century. Like the
Pushyabhutis, the Gurjara-Pratiharas
initially had their capital at the city of
Kanyakubja, on the Ganges River in
eastern part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh. At its peak early in the eighth
century, the Gurjara-Pratiharas con-
trolled most of the Indian subcontinent
north of the Vindhya Mountains, and
the Ganges basin well into West Bengal.
The dynasty was weakened when the
kingdom split in two in the mid-eighth
century, with the Gurjaras reigning over
the kingdom’s western part from their
capital at Ujjain and the Pratiharas
remaining in Kanyakubja. Both king-
doms were engaged in constant warfare
with the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which
controlled central India south of the
Vindhya Mountains; they were also
harassed by Muslim raiders from mod-
ern day Afghanistan. The Gurjara king-
dom was conquered by the Chandella
dynasty in 1019 and became restricted
to the lower Ganges basin. It finally dis-
appeared about 1050 C.E.
Guru
(“heavy”) In its most commonly accepted
meaning, a guru is a spiritual teacher or
religious mentor; in an extended sense
the word can refer to any teacher. The
term is often used in the arts, where the
relationship between master and disci-
ple is still a vital part of learning. The
relationship between guru and disciple
(shishya) is one of the most fundamen-
tal and enduring facets of Hinduism and
is the accepted model for the transmis-
sion of religious teaching, tradition, and
authority. Aside from transmitting
[[266]]

knowledge, the guru-disciple connec-
tion also assumes a close and trusting
relationship. The guru takes responsibil-
ity for the disciple’s development, based
on an assessment of the disciple’s
strengths, inclinations, and capacities,
while the disciple faithfully follows the
guru’s direction. The literal meaning of
the word guru is “heavy,” indicating the
impression they have on the lives of
their students—weighty and marked. As
a guiding presence, a guru is considered
indispensable for true spiritual attain-
ment. This is particularly true of secret
traditions such as tantra, in which the
guru’s transmission of authority gives
the disciple the necessary adhikara or
“qualifications” for practice.
Guru
(2) Sanskrit term for the planet Jupiter.
It is called Guru (“heavy”) because it is
considered the heaviest and most
important planet in one’s horoscope.
Guru Maharaj Ji
(b. 1957) Modern religious teacher and
founder of the Divine Light Mission. In
the early 1970s, Guru Maharaj Ji enjoyed
phenomenal but fleeting success during
a tour of the United States. Maharaj was
the fourth son of Hans Ji Maharaj, a
respected religious figure who founded
the Prem Nagar Ashram in Haridwar, a
sacred city on the Ganges River in the
state of Uttar Pradesh. Maharaj’s father
died when he was eight, after which his
mother announced that Maharaj had
inherited his father’s mantle. As with
many modern Hindu missionary fig-
ures, Maharaj’s religious message
stressed the need for devotion to an
enlightened master, which he claimed
to be. At fourteen, he came to the United
States to considerable success. It quickly
dissipated when he and his mother dis-
agreed over his lifestyle and his marriage
to an American woman. He later recon-
ciled with his family, but not before his
mother had named his eldest brother
Satpal as successor to the family line.Gyan Vapi
Guru Purnima
Religious holiday falling on the full
moon (purnima) in the lunar month of
Ashadh (June–July). Guru Purnima is a
day of respect and reverence to one’s
guru, a word that has historically indi-
cated a religious preceptor, but is used
now for any teacher, adviser, or mentor.
In the dharma literature, a young man
is to spend his adolescence as a member
of his guru’s household, receiving room,
board, and instruction. In return he ren-
ders to his guru obedience and loyalty.
On Guru Purnima, a guru’s students are
directed to enshrine and worship their
guru as a deity, giving their guru gifts
and fees, according to their means.
Modern Hindus celebrate this day in
various ways, depending on the type of
guru they have. Although some religious
preceptors are enshrined and wor-
shiped, this practice is not always per-
formed. However, modern Hindus still
celebrate this day by paying particular
honor and homage to their teachers.
This day falls on the full moon, which is
associated with completion and perfec-
tion—the same qualities that gurus are
considered to have. This day is also
known as Vyas Purnima, since the sage
Vyasa was renowned as a great guru.
Gurutalpaga
(“going to the guru’s bed”) In the dharma
literature, which outlined rules for reli-
gious duty and appropriate behavior,
Gurutalpaga was one of the four great
crimes that made one an outcast from
society. This particular offense was com-
mitted by having sexual relations with
the wife of one’s guru or religious
teacher. Since the disciple is considered
a member of the guru’s family and must
treat the guru with reverence and loyalty,
this was obviously a serious breach of
trust. Since these disciples are adoles-
cent men and many of their gurus may
have had wives much younger than
themselves, such proximity could have
easily generated serious temptation and
required a strict prohibition to maintain
appropriate relationships. The gravity of
this offense can be seen by the penances
prescribed for its expiation (prayash-
chitta). According to the dharma litera-
ture, the offender could either tear off
his genitals, or embrace the red-hot stat-
ue of a woman while lying on a red-hot
iron bed. In either case it was expected
that this expiation would result in his
death, although the texts always note
that death blots out the offense.
Guruvayur
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Thrussoor dis-
trict in the southern Indian state of
Kerala, a short distance inland from the
Arabian Sea. Guruvayur is most famous
for a temple to the god Vishnu, wor-
shiped in his form as Krishna, and the
temple’s main image is of Krishna as a
young boy just past toddler age.
According to the temple’s charter myth,
the image at Guruvayur was originally at
Krishna’s mythic kingdom in the city of
Dwaraka, on the Arabian Sea in the
northern Indian state of Gujarat. When
Dwaraka was destroyed by floods, the
image was saved from destruction by
Guru, the planet Jupiter, and Vayu, the
god of wind. These two deities brought
the image to Kerala, and in their honor
the place was named Guruvayur.
Guruvayur’s mythic charter also
describes the site’s power to heal ail-
ments such as rheumatism and leprosy.
This healing power is a great attraction
in modern times, not only for people
with rheumatism, skin diseases, and
other afflictions, but also for childless
women seeking children and pregnant
women seeking an easy delivery and a
happy child.
Gyan Vapi
(“well of knowledge”) A well that is the
sole part of the original Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares. The tem-
ple’s name refers to the god Shiva in his
form as Vishvanath, “Lord of the
Universe,” and was one of the most
sacred Hindu sites in medieval India. In

 the armies of the Moghul emperor

Gyan Vapi, Battle of
Aurangzeb razed the temple and built a
mosque in its place. Although the tem-
ple’s destruction is usually portrayed as
an act of Muslim iconoclasm, according
to Gyan Vapi’s account, Aurangzeb may
have also intended it as a political mes-
sage to punish local rebellion. According
to local legend, the image of Shiva as
Vishvanath was thrown into the well to
protect it from desecration, and it
remains there to this day.
Gyan Vapi, Battle of
Battle reportedly fought in Benares by
the Naga ascetic warriors of the
Mahanirvani Akhara. According to a
handwritten book in the akhara’s
archives, in 1664 the akhara’s soldiers
won a great victory near the Gyan Vapi
well. This document simply states that
the Sanyasis were victorious against the
forces of “the Sultan,” although histori-
ans have inferred that this figure was the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb. If the story
is true, this battle may have been a con-
tributing factor in Aurangzeb’s decision
to raze the Vishvanath temple in 1669.
In light of this claim, it is possible that
the temple’s destruction was motivated
not simply by intolerant iconoclasm,
but by the desire to inflict punishment
for resistance and rebellion.
