Nabhadas
(c. 1600) Author of the Bhaktamal
(“Garland of Devotees”). In this hagio-
graphic text, he gives short (six line)
accounts of the lives of more than two
hundred contemporary bhakti (devo-
tional) figures, some from personal
experience. Although Nabhadas identi-
fies himself as a Ramanandi—a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama—his work
includes devotees of all sectarian per-
suasions. The text is notably free of mar-
velous and miraculous events, and
Nabhadas emphasizes the devotee’s
personal qualities, to serve as a model of
devotion for others. In many cases the
Bhaktamal gives the earliest reliable
account for these figures, making it an
important source for northern Indian
literary and religious history. Despite its
importance the text cannot be defini-
tively dated, although internal evidence
suggests that it was completed early in
the seventeenth century.
Nacciyar Tirumoli
One of two collections of poetry com-
posed by the poet-saint Andal (9th c.),
the other being the Tirruppavai. Andal
was the only woman among the Alvars,
a group of twelve poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. All the Alvars were
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
Their emphasis on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage, transformed and revitalized
Hindu religious life. Andal’s chosen
deity was Ranganatha, the form of
Vishnu presiding at the temple of
Shrirangam. Yet both collections of her
poetry are dedicated to Krishna, a dif-
ferent form of Vishnu. This seeming
divergence may reflect her conviction
that all manifestations of Vishnu are
ultimately the same or indicate the dif-
ference between personal devotion and
literary expression.
The thirty poems in the Nacciyar
Tirumoli are told by a group of unmar-
ried girls, who have taken a vow to bathe
in the river at dawn during the coldest
month of the year. This vow has a long
history in southern India, where young
girls would take the oath to gain a good
husband and a happy married life. In the
poem, the girls have taken the vow to
gain Krishna as their husband. The
poems in the cycle describe various fea-
tures of the natural world at dawn, the
girls’ hopes in performing the vow, and
their return to Krishna’s house to awaken
him and beg for his grace. The final
poem in the series describes the benefits
gained by one who chants the text.
Nachiketas
A primary character in the Kathka
Upanishad, a speculative philosophical
text considered one of the later upan-
ishads. In the text, the boy Nachiketas is
the seeker of ultimate wisdom. In a fit of
anger his father curses him to be given
to Death; Nachiketas obediently goes to
the house of Death to give himself up.
He waits for three days at Death’s door,
but receives none of the hospitality due
to a brahmin guest. When Death returns
he is disturbed to discover that his guest
has been neglected. To atone for the
lapse, Death offers Nachiketas three
boons. With his first two, Nachiketas
wishes to return to his father and to
understand the meaning of a particular
sacrificial ritual. With the final boon he
asks what happens to a person after the
death of the body. Death first tries to
evade the question, then tries to bribe
Nachiketas with other gifts. When the
boy holds firm in his resolve, Death
begins to reveal his secrets. This dis-
course makes up the bulk of the text.
Death’s secrets focus mainly on the
[[451]]
Nadi
reality of the Self (atman), its eternal
and indestructible nature, and the diffi-
culties in truly knowing it. The Self is
portrayed as the ultimate truth, and to
know it is to know the only thing that
really matters.
Nadi
(“tube”) In general, the word nadi may
be applied to any pipe or tube,
whether in plumbing or the human
circulatory system. A nadi has a more
specialized meaning with regard to
the Hindu conception of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system, existing on a
different plane than gross matter, but
corresponding to the material body. It
consists of six psychic centers
(chakras), visualized as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along
the spine, connected by three vertical
channels known as nadis. Of these,
the ida nadi is on the left side, the
pingala nadi on the right, and the
sushumna in the center.
Naga
(“naked”) The general term for any fight-
ing or militant ascetic. Ascetic orders
traditionally chartered companies of
fighting ascetics to protect the members
and their resources. The Naga orders of
the Dashanami Sanyasis were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva, whereas the
Bairagi orders were devotees of the god
Vishnu. In northern India during the
eighteenth century these Naga ascetics
developed into dynamic military and
mercantile powerhouses. In several
instances, Naga ascetics managed to
carve out petty kingdoms of their own.
In many other instances, they had sig-
nificant influence in the northern
Indian economy and politics, whether in
their own right or as mercenary soldiers
in the service of a reigning monarch.
Their name was a literal description of
their practices, since many of these
ascetics would go into battle bearing
only their weapons. Their ash-smeared
[[452]]

bodies and flying matted hair presented
a fearsome sight. As Indian social and
political circumstances have changed,
their military importance has faded.
However, these organizations (akhara)
of Naga ascetics still exist, although they
are most important now in determining
the order for bathing (snana) at the
Kumbha Mela. The accounts of the
ascetics themselves are full of tales of
strife along sectarian lines (Shaivas ver-
sus Vaishnavas); a good indication that
the Shaivas gained superiority is that
they have priority in the bathing at the
Kumbha Melas. For further information
see Jadunath Sarkar, A History of the
Dasanami Naga Sanyasis, 1958; David
Lorenzen, “Warrior Ascetics in Indian
History,” in Journal of the American
Oriental Society, Vol. 98, No. 1, 1978;
and James G. Lochtefeld, “The Vishva
Hindu Parishad and the Roots of
Hindu Militancy,” in Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. LXII,
No. 2, 1994.
Naga
(2) In Hindu mythology, the Nagas are a
class of minor divinities who have the
form of serpents. Their king is Vasuki. In
popular Hinduism, Nagas are often con-
sidered to be the gods of a specific place.
Often associated with fertility and
fecundity, Nagas are usually believed to
live in springs, ponds, and other small
bodies of water. In Buddhist and Jain
iconography the Nagas often play the
role of minor protective deities. It is
common to see a seated figure shad-
owed by an “umbrella” of Nagas.
Although this is unusual in Hindu
iconography, there may be remnants
of this in the iconography of the god
Shiva, who is often depicted wearing
snakes for both his ornaments and his
sacred thread.
Nagara
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture,
along with the Dravida and the Veshara.Nagara
Built in the Nagara style, the Triloknath Temple in Mandi consists of a series of towers,
the largest of which contains an image of the presiding deity.
The Nagara style is found throughout
northern and eastern India. One of its
prominent features is a shikhara or
tower. The shikhara is often surrounded
by smaller towers that lead the eye up to
the highest point, which is directly over
the image of the temple’s primary deity.
Within this general pattern there are two
variants, exemplified by the temples at
Khajuraho and Orissa.
In Khajuraho the series of shikha-
ras are connected, forming a continu-
ous rising swell that draws the eye
upward, similar to a series of hills
leading to a distant peak. This vertical-
ity is accentuated through the use of
turrets (urushringas) on the sides of
the towers, which replicate the shape
of the final peak. The entire temple is
set on a raised base (adhishthana).
Within the temple there are usually
several different zones: an entrance
porch (ardhamandapa), a hall (man-
dapa), an intermediate area (antarala),
and a central shrine (garbhagrha) sur-
rounded by a processional path
[[453]]
Nageshvar
(pradakshina). Despite their different
parts, temples built in the Khajuraho
style convey the artistic impression of
an integrated, unified whole.
The Orissan style emphasizes the
contrast between the temple’s con-
stituent parts. The two central compo-
nents are the entrance hall (jagamohan)
and the beehive-shaped temple tower
(deul). The tower is often three or four
times taller than the entrance hall, a dif-
ference that tends to heighten the con-
trast between the two. Other sections
include a dance-hall (natamandira),
traditionally used for performances, and
a “food pavilion” (bhogamandapa),
where the prasad was cooked. These
architectural elements are connected
like beads on a string, as seemingly sep-
arable parts lined up with one another.
The most important temples in the
Orissan style are the Lingaraja Temple
in Bhubaneshvar, the Jagannath
temple in Puri, and the Sun Temple
at Konarak.
Nageshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) about fif-
teen miles northeast of the holy city of
Dwaraka, in the eastern state of
Gujarat. The temple is named after its
presiding deity, the god Shiva in his
manifestation as the “Lord of Serpents.”
Shiva is present at Nageshvar in the
form of a linga, a pillar-shaped image.
The Nageshvar linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites at which
Shiva is uniquely present. Nageshvar’s
charter myth is based on the story of the
demon Daruk and his wife Daruka.
Daruka is a fervent devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva’s wife Parvati; through Parvati’s
grace Daruka gains protection for all the
other demons. The demons use this
power to oppress the righteous. As the
demons are about to kill one of Shiva’s
devotees, Shiva appears and slays them.
Parvati has come along with Shiva to
protect Daruka, her devotee. Daruka
persuades Shiva and Parvati to remain
in Nageshvar as a sign of their grace.
Since the city of Dwaraka is also
[[454]]

connected with the god Krishna, some
scholars believe the Nageshvar linga
may have been promoted to maintain a
Shaivite presence in an important
Vaishnava area.
Nag Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day (pan-
chami) of the bright, waxing half of the
lunar month of Shravan (July–August).
This day is devoted to the worship of
serpents, whether as Nagas—the minor
deities who take the form of snakes—or
actual cobras and other snakes. On this
day the images of the Naga deities are
bathed and given offerings. Offerings
are also made to real serpents. On this
day people refrain from digging in the
earth, since snakes live there.
This rite occurs on the fifth day
because in astrology (jyotisha), the
guardian deity for this day is Shesha, the
god Vishnu’s serpent couch. This festi-
val falls at the beginning of the rainy
season, when the rising waters caused
by the monsoon rains often drive snakes
out of their dens, and at times into peo-
ples’ homes and gardens. The rainy sea-
son is also the time for growing crops;
snakes pose a real danger for people
working in the fields. According to one
estimate, 10,000 Indians die from
snakebites every year. According to pop-
ular belief, observing this rite will pro-
tect one from snakebites for the entire
year. This observance is a protective rit-
ual, marking the advent of a dangerous
time for many villagers.
Nagpur
City in the eastern state of Maharashtra.
Nagpur is the birthplace of the Hindu
nationalist organization known as the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh. The
organization was formed in 1925 by Dr.
K. B. Hedgewar and still maintains its
headquarters in Nagpur.
Nahusha
In Hindu mythology, a king of the lunar
dynasty, and a paradigm for a personNaina Devi
afflicted with self-pride. Through
amassing religious merits, Nahusha suc-
ceeds to the throne of Indra, the king of
the gods, who has gone into hiding
because of an evil deed. Nahusha is
filled with lust for Indra’s wife, Indrani.
He tries to act on it despite the obvious
improprieties of approaching another
man’s wife and a mortal making a claim
on a goddess. Nahusha sets off for
Indrani’s palace in a palanquin. In his
impatience, he whips the palanquin
bearers, saying “Sarpa, sarpa” (“Move!
Move!”). Unfortunately for Nahusha,
one of the bearers is Agastya, the sage.
For Nahusha’s lust and disrespect,
Agastya curses him to become a
snake (sarpa). Nahusha remains a
serpent for many years but is released
from the curse by the sight of the
Pandava brothers.
Nai
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which the
group held a monopoly. The Nai jati’s
occupation was barbering, a low status
job because it required continual con-
tact with cut human hair, considered
a source of impurity (ashaucha). In
many instances the Nais also served
as messengers.
Naimisha
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the state
of Uttar Pradesh, about fifty miles
northwest of the city of Lucknow. In the
later sectarian literature known as the
puranas, Naimisha is described as a for-
est. Today the city’s major attraction is a
spring-fed bathing (snana) pool named
Chakra Tirtha. According to tradition,
this bathing pool contains water from
all the holy places of India, and thus is
the best place for pious Hindus to take a
holy bath.
Naimittika Karma
(“occasional [ritual] action”) One of
three general types of ritual action, the
others being nitya karma and kamya
karma. Naimittika karma rites follow a
particular cause (naimittika); when par-
ticular circumstances arise, one is
required to perform the ritual. For
example, when a child is born, certain
rites must be performed. However, the
ritual is not required unless a birth has
taken place.
Naina Devi
Presiding deity of the Naina Devi temple
in the Shiwalik Hills in the state of
Himachal Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. Naina Devi’s tem-
ple is located on a mountaintop close to
the border of Punjab. It is nine miles
from Anandpur Sahib, a famous Sikh
place of pilgrimage, and about one mile
from Nangal village. The greatest pil-
grimage traffic occurs during festivals
held on the eighth day in each half of the
lunar month of Shravan, and also dur-
ing the first nine days of the month of
Ashvin, when the Navaratri festival
takes place.
According to the temple’s charter
myth, Naina Devi is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess which spreads throughout the
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks
the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess;
Naina Devi was Sati’s eyes (naina). As
with many of the other Shiwalik god-
desses, the images in Naina Devi’s tem-
ple are self-manifested (svayambhu
images) outcrops of stone. In a different
version of the myth, the images were
discovered by a herdsman named
Naina, who heeded the command of
the Goddess to build a temple for her.

Erndl, Victory to the Mother, 1993. See

Naisthika
Naisthika
(“fixed”) A person who takes a vow to
remain a perpetual religious student
(brahmacharin), keeping lifelong vows
of celibacy, austerity, study, and service
to his or her religious preceptor (guru).
to be incompatible with certain everyday
activities, which should be avoided during
that time. Hindus who pay attention to
astrology are keenly aware of the passage
of time and the quality of each moment.
Nakula
Naivedya
(“to be presented”) The thirteenth of the
sixteen traditional upacharas (“offer-
ings”) given to a deity as part of worship.
To treat the deity as an honored guest, a
person may offer food. The food is often
returned to the worshipers as prasad, the
sanctified food bearing the deity’s grace.
The offering may be done in various ways,
but the underlying motive for all the
upacharas is to show one’s love for the
deity and attend to the deity’s needs.
Naiyayika
Term for a follower of the Nyaya and
Vaisheshika philosophical schools, two of
the six schools in Hindu philosophy. After
the early centuries of the common era, the
Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools merged, as
did the Samkhya and Yoga schools and
the Mimamsa and Vedanta schools. The
term Naiyayika is used to denote a follower
of the combined Nyaya-Vaisheshika
school of philosophy.
Nakshatra
In Indian astrology (jyotisha), a nakshatra
is one of the twenty-seven signs in the
lunar zodiac. In a single lunar month the
moon moves through each of the twenty-
seven lunar houses. The territory for these
lunar houses is divided equally through-
out the solar zodiac—with 2.25 lunar
houses for each of the twelve solar signs.
The nakshatras are important in Indian
astrology, partly because they change
quite rapidly, but also because the charac-
ter and qualities associated with each
nakshatra are believed to color the time
period in which they fall. One group of five
nakshatras, the Panchak Nakshatra, is
considered extremely inauspicious; many
activities will be curtailed until this period
has passed. Certain nakshatras are judged
[[456]]

In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Nakula is the
fourth of the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s antagonists. Nakula’s mother,
Madri, is the younger wife of King Pandu.
None of the Pandava brothers are actually
Pandu’s sons, since he has been cursed to
die the moment he holds his wife in
amorous embrace. Instead, they are mag-
ically created through the effect of a
mantra given to Madri’s co-wife, Kunti, by
the sage Durvasas. The mantra gives the
woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods to conceive a son
who will be as powerful as the god himself.
With Pandu’s blessing Kunti teaches the
mantra to Madri. She meditates on the
Ashvins, the divine twins who are the
physicians of the gods. Thus, she bears
twins. As the sons of the physicians of the
gods, both Nakula and Sahadeva are
skilled healers of animals and human
beings. Although Nakula and Sahadeva
are among the five Pandava brothers, they
are less important to the Mahabharata
than their three elder siblings.
Nala
In Hindu mythology, the King of
Nishadas and the husband of Damayanti.
The story of Nala and Damayanti appears
as a story within the Mahabharata, the
later of the two great Hindu epics. It is
recounted to the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s protagonists, during their twelve
year exile in the forest, as a way to keep up
their spirits by telling how others have
transcended misfortune.
When Damayanti is old enough to
marry, her father sends invitations to the
kings of the earth, announcing her
svayamvara, a rite in which Damayanti
will choose her husband. The kings of
the earth come to the svayamvara to
seek her hand, as do the gods (devas)Namakarana (“name-giving”) Samskara
themselves. Yet Damayanti has already
decided to choose Nala after being
advised by a swan who praises him. The
gods try to foil this by taking on the
physical appearance of Nala, so that
Damayanti will not be able to tell the
difference between them. As a last
resort, Damayanti makes an act of
truth, a ritual action whose efficacy is
based on the power of truth. In her act of
truth, Damayanti declares that she has
never loved anyone but Nala. To prove
that this statement is true, she directs
the gods to resume their true forms.
Compelled by the power of truth, the
gods immediately do as she commands.
Nala and Damayanti are married, and as
a reward for her fidelity, the gods give
Nala various divine gifts. Hearing of the
marriage, two of the rejected suitors
curse Nala to lose his kingdom. Because
of the curse, Nala and Damayanti are
separated and suffer long tribulations,
which include Nala having his body
magically changed so that no one is able
to recognize him. In the end Damayanti
recognizes him by his divine powers,
which cannot be hidden, and the lovers
are happily reunited. See also truth,
power of.
Naladiyar
One of the most important pieces of
early Tamil literature, along with its pre-
decessor, the Tirukkural. The Naladiyar
is a collection of four hundred verses
that date from the fifth or sixth century.
Mainly concerned with moral and ethi-
cal life, the verses were written by a
group of Jain monks who found shelter
with a pious king in time of famine. In
gratitude each monk wrote one verse.
Despite the Naladiyar’s sectarian origin,
it has become the cultural property of
Tamils from all religious communities;
many of the verses have come into the
language as proverbial sayings.
Nalayira Divyaprabandham
(“The
Four
Thousand
Divine
Compositions”) Title for the collected
Namakarana samskara being performed on an
infant, who in this photo is wrapped in cloth for
protection from the evil eye.
hymns of the Alvars, compiled in the
tenth century by Nathamuni. The Alvars
were a group of twelve poet-saints who
lived in southern India between the sev-
enth and tenth centuries. All the Alvars
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu and emphasized passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language. Their collected hymns
were popularly known as the “Tamil
Veda.” They carry Vedic authority for
many southern Indian Vaishnavas, par-
ticularly the Shrivaishnava school,
which applied more developed philo-
sophical articulation to these devotional
ideas. See also Veda.
Namakarana
(“name-giving”) Samskara
The fifth of the traditional life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), during which
the newborn child is given a name.
Although some commentators believe
[[457]]
Namarupa
that this rite should be done on the day
of birth, many others insist that it
should be on the tenth day, indicating
a difference between birth and the
social ritual of name-giving. Some
believe that the child’s name should
begin with the first letter of the
nakshatra (sign in the lunar zodiac) in
which the child is born; this practice is
still widespread in northern India.
Although the classical form of this rite
has largely fallen into disuse, naming
ceremonies are still an important part
of the birth of a child.
Namarupa
Literally, this word means “name [and
physical] form,” two of the most identi-
fiable and enduring aspects of a per-
son. In philosophical discourse, the
term namarupa is often used pejora-
tively to designate all aspects of per-
sonality that are ultimately ephemeral
but help reinforce the illusion of a
diverse world and a Self with an inde-
pendent identity. These notions of
independence are thought to be ulti-
mately false since one’s name and form
will be different in one’s next birth. In
this context, namarupa designates all
that is provisionally real.
Namaskara
(“reverential salutation”) Both a
phrase and a gesture used to greet
another person respectfully. The ges-
ture is done by joining both palms,
pointing the fingers up, with the base
of the thumbs touching the chest.
Namaskara is the fourteenth of sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship,
treating the deity as an honored guest.
In this action, the deity is given a ges-
ture of respect, which can take a vari-
ety of forms: joining the palms with
the fingers pointing upward (anjali
hasta), kneeling and touching one’s
head to the floor, or a full prostration
(dandavat pranam). The underlying
motive for all the upacharas is to show
[[458]]

one’s respect and love for the deity by
ministering to the deity’s needs.
Nambudiri
Southern Indian brahmin communi-
ty, which is a sub-division of the
Dravida brahmins, one of five south-
ern Indian brahmin communities
(Pancha Dravida). The Nambudiris’
traditional homeland is in the region
that is now the modern state of
Kerala. The Nambudiris are noted
throughout India for their learning
and piety. According to tradition, the
great philosopher Shankaracharya
was a Nambudiri brahmin. In his
desire to revitalize Hindu religion,
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one
Hindu sacred center in each corner of
the subcontinent, and at each estab-
lished a Dashanami Sanyasi monas-
tic center (math) to train learned
monks. One of these sacred centers
was at Badrinath in the Himalayas.
According to the Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years the
temple worship was performed by
the Dandi Sanyasis, who were also
Nambudiri brahmins. When the last
of these died without a successor in
[[1776]]
, the local king, who served as the
protector of the shrine, invited a non-
ascetic Nambudiri brahmin to serve
as the temple’s priest. This priest was
given the title rawal (“deputy”), and
his extended family has maintained
the shrine since then. The rawal was
the only person allowed to touch the
image of the presiding deity. As a
consequence he was required to
remain a bachelor, lest the ritual
impurity arising from the birth of a
child (sutakashaucha) render him
unable to attend to his duties. For a
long time the rawals had sole rights to
the offerings given at the shrine, but
since 1939 the temple has been man-
aged by a committee, and the rawal
has been restricted to ritual duties.Nanda Devi
Namdev
(1270–1350?) Poet-saint who is one of
the great figures in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community centered around
the worship of the Hindu god Vithoba,
at his temple in Pandharpur in the
modern
state
of
Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Namdev was a
cotton-printer, considered a low-status
occupation, but the strength of
his devotion rendered his worldly
status irrelevant. He is said to have been
an associate of Jnaneshvar and
Chokamela, two other Varkari poet-
saints. His songs have been preserved in
several different collections, including
the Adigranth (compiled by the Sikh
community) and the Panchvani (a col-
lection of songs by five poets compiled
by the Dadupanth). For traditional
information about his life, see G. A.
Deleury, The Cult of Vithoba, 1960; and
Justin E. Abbott and Narhar R. Godbole
(trans.), Stories of Indian Saints, 1982.
For a more critical look at his Hindu
songs and the difficulties using them as
biographical sources, see Winand
Callewaert and Mukund Lath, The Hindi
Padavali of Namdev, 1989.
Nammalvar
(10th c.) The most prolific composer of all
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. They emphasized passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god, con-
veyed through hymns sung in the Tamil
language, which transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. According to
tradition, Nammalvar was born into a
princely family, but was completely dis-
interested with life in the world. His dis-
traught parents eventually abandoned
him. Nammalvar crawled into the hollow
of a giant tamarind tree, where he sat in
silent meditation. He remained there
until the arrival of his disciple
Mathurakavi, who managed to rouse
him by posing a question on the nature of
the Self. Nammalvar immediately poured
forth more than one thousand hymns to
Vishnu, each beginning with the last
word of the previous hymn. These hymns
are known as the Tiruvaymoli (“holy
words”). This collection of 1,102 stanzas
is the concluding section of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;

the Alvars, 1929; A. Shrinivasa Raghavan,
Nammalvar, 1975; and A. K. Ramanujan,
Hymns for the Drowning, 1981.
Nanak Jayanti
Celebration falling on the full moon
in the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). This day is
celebrated as the birthday of the
first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, and is
celebrated largely by members of the
Sikh community.
Nanda
In Hindu mythology, the god Krishna’s
foster father, who cares for Krishna as
his own child after Krishna is placed in
his care. Nanda is described as the head-
man of the village. Under his care
Krishna lives a comfortable, if simple,
life. In Krishna’s mythology, Nanda is a
less important figure than Krishna’s fos-
ter mother, Yashoda.
Nanda Devi
Nanda Devi is the name for one of the
tallest mountains in India, rising over
[[25]]
,000 feet, in the Kumaon region of the
Himalayas. Nanda Devi is also a form of
the Goddess who is identified with that
mountain. With Nanda Devi, as for
many of the other goddesses of India,
divinity and the natural landscape are
inextricably connected. Nanda Devi is a
local Himalayan goddess who presides
over the Garhwal and Kumaon regions.
People in the region consider her to be a
“daughter” of the region, who had to
change her residence when she married

rites show strong connections with the

life-cycle journeys of Himalayan
women. Songs associated with Nanda
Devi describe the difficulty of going
from her natal home to her marital
home, a reality for many Himalayan
women. In the same way, Nanda Devi’s
pilgrimages, which emphasize journeys
through the hills surrounding the
mountain, imitate the women’s periodic
journeys back to their own natal villages.
A major part of Nanda Devi’s mythology
is the adoption of an abandoned buffalo
calf, which is later discovered to be a
demon in buffalo form. The buffalo
demon grows large and troublesome,
and is eventually slain by Nanda Devi.
This myth parallels the narrative in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important source for the mythology of
the Goddess; this is the most influential
text used in Nanda Devi’s worship. For
further information on Nanda Devi, her
rites, and her connection with
Himalayan society, see William Sax,
Mountain Goddess, 1991.
[[460]]

(late 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
also named as members of the commu-
nity, and as associates of either the com-
munity’s founder, Vallabhacharya, or
his successor, Vitthalnath. Very little is
known about his life, but he is men-
tioned in the Bhaktamal, a collection of
lives of the saints written by Nabhadas
in the seventeenth century. Like all the
poetry associated with the Pushti Marg,
Nanddas’s poetry focused on devotion
to Krishna. His two most important
works, written in elegant poetry, are
extended poems on the ras lila and
Uddhava’s message. Both of these
themes date back to the Bhagavata
Purana (10th c.?), the most important
text for Krishna devotionalism. These
have been translated by R. S. McGregor,
The Round Dance of Krishna and
Uddhav’s Message, 1973.
Nandi
(“joy,” “delight”) Epithet of the animal
vehicle of the god Shiva, which takes the
form of a bull. Like all of the animal
vehicles, it symbolizes the deity. Nandi
is not only Shiva’s vehicle, but his devo-
tee (bhakta). Statues of Nandi are often
sculpted outside Shiva temples (usually
facing the image) as a way of marking
the site as sacred to Shiva. He appears in
many places in Shiva’s mythology, but
usually as a devoted underling advanc-
ing Shiva’s purposes, rather than an
independent agent with a purpose and
ends of his own.
Nandigrama
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Nandigrama is a vil-
lage outside the city of Ayodhya, where
Prince Bharata sets up the royal courtNarasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar
during his brother Rama’s absence.
Bharata’s mother Kaikeyi uses her influ-
ence to banish Rama for fourteen years,
putting Bharata on the throne in his
place. At Rama’s command, Bharata
agrees to act as the temporary king, but
with two symbolic adjustments. The first
is that Bharata moves the royal court
from the capital city of Ayodhya to the
village of Nandigrama, as a symbol of
Rama’s exile; the second is that through-
out his regency, Bharata sits at the foot
of the royal throne, upon which is
placed a pair of Rama’s sandals, symbol-
izing that Rama is the rightful ruler.
Thus, Nandigrama is a symbol of
Bharata’s righteousness.
Narada
A famous sage in Hindu mythology,
equally renowned for his qualities as a
musician and as a gossip. Narada plays a
stringed instrument known as the vina,
serving as the bard to the gods. His
ambition as a musician apparently
exceeds his actual skill, since several of
his mythic stories describe him being
humbled. In his capacity as wandering
musician, he also conveys news and
gossip. In many cases Narada’s news-
bearing is the vehicle advancing the plot
in a story. According to one famous
story, he requests that Vishnu give a
demonstration of his magic (maya).
Vishnu sends him to a nearby farm-
house for some water, where Narada
meets an enchantingly beautiful
woman. Forgetting all about his errand,
the two fall in love, are married, and have
several children. After several years of
wedded bliss, severe floods wash away
his home and drown his family. As he
mourns his loss, he finds himself back
on the side of road with Vishnu, who is
still asking him to go to the farmhouse to
get some water.
Narada Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed impor-
tant, but less authoritative than the
other textual category, the shrutis or
“heard” texts. This smrti is ascribed to
the sage Narada, and is an example of
one of the Dharma Shastras, which
were manuals prescribing rules for cor-
rect human behavior and ideal social
life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras, which
are ascribed to recognizable individuals,
the Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, a strategy used
to reinforce the authority of these texts.
The Narada Smrti exists in several ver-
sions, one of which is much longer than
the others. All of the versions were writ-
ten later than the Manu Smrti (1st c.
B.C.E.?), since this text is mentioned in
the preface. Narada’s text deals exclu-
sively with the administration of justice
(vyavahara), and treats this in exhaus-
tive detail, with a strong emphasis on
clarity and precision.
Narak Chaturdashi
Religious observance falling on the four-
teenth day (chaturdashi) of the dark,
waning half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). People
who observe this day worship and make
offerings to the god Yama. In the
evening they light a lamp in his name.
Yama is the lord of the underworld and
the judge of the dead; he reviews the
deeds of the dead and inflicts punish-
ment upon people for their misdeeds.
Those who faithfully observe Narak
Chaturdashi are believed to be spared
from the torments of hell.
Nara-Narayana
In Hindu mythology, two of the sons of
the god Dharma; through their ascetic
practices (tapas) these two boys became
sages. The place where they performed
their asceticism is believed to have been
in the region of Badrinath. The duo are
still associated with the charter myths
for that place.
Narasimha (“Man-Lion”) Avatar
Fourth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu, in which he appears as a figure
[[461]]
Narasimha Jayanti
with the head and shoulders of a lion,
but the torso and lower body of a man.
As with all of Vishnu’s avatars, this
appearance comes at a moment when
the cosmos is in crisis, and decisive
divine action is needed to restore cos-
mic equilibrium. See Man-Lion avatar.
Narasimha Jayanti
Religious observance falling on the four-
teenth day of the bright, waxing half
of the lunar month of Baisakh
(April–May). This day is celebrated as
the birthday of Vishnu’s fourth avatar,
Narasimha, although his birthday is
different from those of Vishnu’s human
avatars. Narasimha is not human, but a
creature with the head and shoulders of
a lion, and the torso and lower body of
a man. He is not born in the usual
sense, but bursts forth fully formed
from a pillar, to destroy the demon
Hiranyakashipu and to protect his
devotee (bhakta) Prahlada. See also
Man-Lion avatar.
Narasimhavarman I
(r. 630–668) Pallava dynasty ruler
during its most vibrant era, when it
was a stronghold of Tamil culture.
Narasimhavarman succeeded his father
Mahendravarman, who had been killed
in a battle with the forces of
the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II.
Narasimhavarman avenged his father’s
death by conquering the Chalukya king-
dom and killing Pulakeshin II in battle,
but the two kingdoms were so evenly
matched that neither could retain con-
trol over the other. Like his father,
Narasimhavarman was a great patron of
the arts. It was during his reign that con-
struction commenced on the great
sculptures at Mahabalipuram in the
state of Tamil Nadu. The most famous of
these is a rock-cut sculpture depicting
the myth of the Descent of the Ganges,
in which a natural vertical fissure is used
to lay out the river’s path.
[[462]]

Narasimhavarman II
(r. 700–728) Pallava dynasty ruler dur-
ing the dynasty’s most vibrant era, when
it was a stronghold of Tamil culture. Like
all the great Pallava monarchs,
Narasimhavarman II was a great patron
of the arts. During his reign there was
continued construction of the monu-
ments at Mahabalipuram in the state of
Tamil Nadu.
Narayana
Epithet of the god Vishnu. The name is
traditionally interpreted as meaning
“resting on the waters,” based on the
claim that the word nara, which usually
means “man,” in this case means
“waters.” Narayana is the image of
Vishnu in the time of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). He is reclining on his serpent
couch, Shesha, in the midst of the cos-
mic sea, with his wife, Lakshmi, seated
at his feet, and his vehicle, Garuda,
standing by. Vishnu is the sole remain-
ing agent in the cosmos, as its beginning
and end. When the time for a new cre-
ation arrives, a lotus sprouts forth from
Narayana’s navel, which opens to reveal
the creator-god Brahma. The cycle of
creation begins anew.
Narayana Bhatta
(1513–1570?) The most celebrated schol-
ar and commentator on the dharma lit-
erature of his time, and the patriarch of
a scholarly family. Narayana’s father had
migrated from the city of Paithan, in
central India, to Benares, a center of
Sanskrit learning. Narayana’s work fell
mainly in the class of commentarial lit-
erature known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”), which were compilations of
Hindu lore. Nibandha compilers collect-
ed references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts, and then compiled these
excerpts into a single volume. Aside
from his unparalleled command of
these traditional texts, Narayana was
also noted for his learned interpretationNasik Mela
and commentary; to these texts, he
applied the rules that the Purva
Mimamsa philosophical school had
originally developed to interpret the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
According to tradition, he was a man
whose personal holiness was equal to
his great learning. He is reported to have
performed a miracle by causing rain to
fall out of season, convincing the
Muslim officials ruling Benares to allow
the Vishvanath temple to be rebuilt.
Narmada River
Central Indian river that has its source at
the sacred site (tirtha) of Amarkantak
in the state of Madhya Pradesh, and
flows almost directly west through the
state of Gujarat, then to the Arabian Sea.
The Narmada is one of the few central
Indian rivers flowing from east to west;
rivers further south are channeled east
by the upthrust of the highlands known
as the Western Ghats. It is traditionally
considered one of the seven sacred
rivers of India, along with the Ganges,
Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Indus,
and Cauvery. An important site on the
Narmada is Omkareshvar, one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a network of sites
sacred to the god Shiva. During the
[[1990]]
s the Narmada has become a rally-
ing point for environmentalists who
have opposed construction of several
massive dams, on the grounds that
these dams have displaced too many
people and destroyed too much prime
farmland. Although work on these dams
has continued, the pace has slowed. In
[[1997]]
 a minor earthquake in the
Narmada basin prompted the call for
further consideration of this project’s
environmental dangers.
Narsi Mehta
(16th c.) Gujarati poet-saint who was a
well-known figure in northern Indian
devotional life. Narsi was a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna. His poetry
describes the love affair between
Krishna and his consort Radha.
According to tradition, Narsi’s poetry
was rooted in a vision of Krishna’s ras
lila, or great circle dance, in which Narsi
was privileged to stand as attendant
holding a torch to light the lila. Narsi is
one of the devotees profiled in the
Bhaktamal, a text that gives short bio-
graphical profiles of more than 200
devotional (bhakti) saints; in the text
Narsi is portrayed as a paradigm of gen-
erosity, an earthly imitation of Krishna
himself. For further information see
John Stratton Hawley, “Morality Beyond
Morality in the Lives of Three Hindu
Saints,” in John Stratton Hawley (ed.),
Saints and Virtues, 1987.
Nasik
City and sacred site (tirtha) near the
headwaters of the Godavari River in the
state of Maharashtra, about 100 miles
northeast of Bombay. Nasik is one of the
four sites for the Kumbha Mela, a reli-
gious bathing (snana) festival. Nasik
hosts this festival every twelve years.
Nasik is an important bathing place and
is a center of pilgrimage, piety, and
learning. According to tradition the god-
king Rama, his wife, Sita, and his brother,
Lakshmana lived during much of their
twelve years in exile in the nearby village
of Panchavati. Rama, Sita, and
Lakshmana are central characters in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. Although claims of them
living near Nasik are impossible to prove
or disprove, the legend adds one more
layer of sanctity to the site.
Nasik Mela
The Nasik Mela is the celebration of the
Kumbha Mela at Nasik. The Kumbha
Mela is a religious festival celebrated in
four different locations: Haridwar,
Allahabad, Ujjain, and Nasik. The festi-
val’s focus is bathing (snana) in the
sacred rivers during particularly holy
moments. The Kumbha Mela’s primary
participants are ascetics, who come
from all over southern Asia to bathe
in the sacred waters. According to
[[463]]
Nastika
tradition, the Kumbha Mela was organized
by the great philosopher Shankaracharya
to promote regular gatherings of learned
and holy men, as a means to strengthen,
sustain, and spread the Hindu religion.
The timing for each of these festivals is
determined by the position of the sun
and the planet Jupiter; the twelve years
between these festivals correspond to
Jupiter’s orbit. The Nasik Mela is cele-
brated during the lunar month of
Shravan (July–August), when the planet
Jupiter is in the sign of Leo. This is the
least important of all four Kumbha
Melas, attended mostly by ascetics.
Nastika
(“nihilists”) In Hindu philosophical dis-
course, this was a pejorative term to
denigrate certain other religious and
philosophical schools. The name
Nastika was applied to groups who
denied the three most basic principles
of religion: the authority of the Vedas as
religious texts, the eternal existence of
the soul (atman), and the value of reli-
gious life in general. In context this term
could be applied to the Jains (who
denied the first of these three) to the
Buddhists (who denied the first and the
second) or to the materialist philosoph-
ical school (which denied all three).
Natal Horoscope
In Indian culture, a person’s natal horo-
scope or janampatrika (“birth-paper”) is
believed to reveal a great deal about a
person. One’s previous karma is thought
to determine the moment when one is
born. Thus, a natal horoscope provides a
karmic “itinerary,” indicating where one
has been and what he or she might
expect in the future. Natal horoscopes
still play a role in decision-making, par-
ticularly in arranging marriages. Natal
horoscopes are exchanged before fixing
an engagement in order to determine
the couple’s compatibility. Sometimes
this process takes place merely because
the claim that the horoscopes are
incompatible can provide an acceptable
[[464]]

excuse to refuse an inappropriate
or unacceptable match. Natal horo-
scopes are believed to reveal important
things about a person’s future. A person
whose horoscope indicates an early
death—or the early death of a spouse—
may find it difficult to marry unless he
or she performs certain rituals to
remove these problems.
Natamandira
In the temple architecture of Orissa,
one of the major forms of the northern
Indian Nagara style. The natamandira is
the section of the temple found between
the bhogamandapa (“food-pavilion”)
and the jagamohan, or entrance hall
leading to the main image. Natamandira
literally means “dance-house.” In many
Orissan temples the natamandira was
used for performance, in particular for
the Orissi dance style that was devel-
oped and sustained in these temples.
The performances were partly for the
aesthetic appreciation of the spectators,
but mainly as an offering of entertain-
ment to the deity himself. Although
dances are still performed at the nata-
mandiras as a part of worship, they are
primarily staged for entertainment.
Nataraja
Form of the god Shiva as the “Lord of
the Dance.” The most famous Nataraja
image is in the temple-town of
Chidambaram in the state of
Tamil Nadu. The temple was erected
during the reign of Vira Raja (927–997
C.E.), with Nataraja as its primary deity.
However, the image of Nataraja is well
known, particularly from the southern
Indian bronzes of the Chola dynasty
(9th–13th c).
As a divinity, one of Shiva’s most
important characteristics is that he tran-
scends all duality; the Nataraja image
symbolizes this concept. Shiva dances
within a circle of fire, symbolizing birth
and death, but remains untouched by
these forces. As Shiva dances, his matted
locks swing wildly, showing the force ofNataraja
The god Shiva, in the form of Nataraja (the “Lord of the Dance”),
dances within a circle of fire that symbolizes the cycle of birth and death.
his activity, yet his face stays impassive
and unmoved. One of his four hands
holds the drum that beats the rhythm of
creation, while a second hand holds the
fire of destruction. His third hand is held
palm upward in a gesture meaning “fear
not.” The fourth points to his upraised
foot, the symbol of refuge and divine
mercy for the devotee (bhakta). His
other foot crushes a demon, displaying
his power to destroy the wicked. The
image is a well-developed theological
statement, able to be “read” by those
who can interpret it.
In Nataraja’s charter myth, Shiva and
Kali, the goddess, decide to settle their
[[465]]
Nath
competition with a dance contest. Shiva
finally bests Kali by manifesting as
Nataraja and doing an athletic
(tandava) dance style that Kali’s femi-
nine modesty prevents her from copy-
ing. Mythic roots aside, the Nataraja
temple at Chidambaram has been an
important center for classical Indian
dance for well over a thousand years.
The temple’s eastern wall bears relief
carvings of the 108 basic dance posi-
tions (karanas). These positions are
central to classical Indian dance, partic-
ularly in the Bharatanatyam school,
which is the major dance tradition in
Tamil Nadu.
Nath
(“lord”) Epithet of the god Shiva, based
on his power as the ultimate lord.
Among the Nathpanthis, a renunciant
ascetic community whose members are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, “Nath” is
added to the end of one’s name after
final ascetic initiation as a symbol of
membership. This practice apparently
dates from the Nathpanthis’ earliest
days, since according to tradition they
were founded by the sage Gorakhnath.
Nathamuni
(10th c.) Compiler of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars that are popularly known
as the “Tamil Veda.” Nathamuni is also
a pivotal figure in the later develop-
ment of the Shrivaishnava religious
community, in which the passionate
devotion in the Alvar hymns found
more systematic philosophical articula-
tion. According to tradition, Nathamuni’s
grandson was Yamunacharya, the
teacher of Ramanuja, the greatest
Shrivaishnava figure. See also Veda.
Nathdwara
City and sacred site (tirtha) about twenty-
five miles north of the city of Udaipur in
the south-central region of the state of
Rajasthan. Nathdwara has a temple
housing an image of the god Krishna in
[[466]]

his form as Shrinathji. According to tra-
dition, the image was originally hidden
on the top of Mount Govardhan, a
mountain in the Braj region where
Krishna is said to have lived. The loca-
tion of the image was revealed in a
dream to Vallabhacharya, the founder
of the religious community known as
the Pushti Marg. Vallabhacharya built
a temple to house it on Mount
Govardhan, and his descendants have
remained the image’s hereditary ser-
vants since that time. The image was
moved to the state of Rajasthan in 1669,
prompted by fears that it would be
destroyed by the Moghul emperor
Aurangzeb. According to tradition
Shrinathji revealed his wish to stay in
Nathdwara by sinking his wagon’s
wheels deep into the earth, so that
it could not go further. Nathdwara is a
fairly remote location, making it a safe
place to keep the image. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Nathpanthi
Renunciant ascetic community founded
by the sage Gorakhnath. The
Nathpanthis are also known by many
names: as jogis (from their emphasis on
the practice of yoga), Gorakhnathis
(from the name of their founder),
Kanphatas (meaning “split-ear” by
virtue of the signature earrings placed in
the split cartilage of both ears), Gosains
(“master of the senses”), and simply as
Naths (“lord”) from the characteristic
suffix taken as part of their names upon
ascetic initiation. The Nathpanthis are a
very old organization and have a long
tradition in northern India, but their
historical record is relatively faint. The
organization has no single organizing
body; their emphasis on yoga has meant
that their practice has been internalized,
rather than focused on temples or other
material
objects.
Although
the
Nathpanthis are usually described as
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, they are dis-
tinct from the Shaiva Sanyasis.
The spiritual practice of the Naths
has traditionally focused on the masteryNavadurga
of the subtle body as the means to final
liberation of the soul. The Naths believe
that liberation is physical immortality,
rather than escape from the cycle of
transmigration, which is more com-
monly accepted. The subtle body is an
alternate physiological system, believed
to exist on a different plane than gross
matter, but corresponding to the mater-
ial body. It is visualized as a set of six
psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the spine; above and
below these centers reside two divine
principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power). The aspirant aims to
join these two principles at the crown
of the head, thus transforming the
perishable elements in the gross body
into immortality.
Among the Nathpanthis, the domi-
nant metaphor for talking about this
process is the union of sun and moon.
The sun, identified with Shakti, stands
for the processes of change and destruc-
tion, whereas the moon, identified with
Shiva, symbolizes stability and immor-
tality. In some cases this union of sun
and moon is described in very abstract
terms; for example, in the definition of
hatha yoga “ha” refers to the sun and
“tha” refers to the moon. Other abstract
descriptions of this process speak of
gaining equilibrium of the vital winds
(prana), or yogic union in the subtle
body. In other cases this union is sym-
bolized in concrete ways, as in the prac-
tice of vajroli mudra. This sexual
practice uses urethral suction or the
“fountain-pen technique,” by which a
man, having ejaculated into his female
partner, draws his semen back into his
body. The semen has been refined
through contact with the woman’s uter-
ine blood.
The Nathpanthis have been impor-
tant both as an ascetic community in
their own right, and as an influence on
many of the northern Indian bhakti
poet-saints, particularly Kabir. Their
religious practice has consistently
stressed internal religion, in which
individual realization has been deemed
far more important than performing
social duties or established worship.
The most complete source on
Gorakhnath and his followers is George
Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and the
Kanphata Yogis, 1973.
Natya
The word natya refers to the genre in
classical Indian dance in which the
dancer’s movements convey a story to
the audience. Natya is one of the two
most basic dance genres. The other
genre, nrtya, is “pure” dance, in which
the dance conveys nothing more than
the dancer’s skill.
Natyashastra
Prescriptive manual (shastra) for the per-
forming arts written during the second
century, whose authorship is ascribed to
the mythical sage Bharata. The text is
divided into thirty-seven sections, detail-
ing every aspect of the three major per-
formance forms: music, drama, and
dance (which combines both music and
drama). Some sections of the text are
devoted to aesthetics and poetics, help-
ing to create and convey the correct
atmosphere for the appreciation of the
arts. Other parts of the text discuss con-
crete, practical issues, such as the con-
struction of the stage. The text is still an
authority for these three performing arts,
but it is particularly important for dance.
Many of the positions and gestures found
in Indian dance were first codified in this
text; the Natyashastra remains the ulti-
mate authority for any dance form that
claims to be “classical” dance, rather than
“folk” dance.
Navadurga
(“Nine Durgas”) Collective name for
nine differing forms of Durga, a power-
ful and dangerous form of the Goddess.
One of the “nine Durgas” is worshiped
each of the nine nights during the festi-
val of Navaratri, which usually falls in
October or November. Each goddess has
her own identity, yet at the same time
is a form of Durga. This fluidity is
[[467]]
Navadvip
Worshipers celebrating the Navaratri festival carry an image of the Goddess in the form of Durga.
characteristic of the Goddess; all female
divinities are ultimately seen as
manifestations of some single great
Goddess. The nine Durgas, in the
order in which they are worshiped,
are Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,
Yogmaya, Raktadantika, Shakumbhari
Devi, Durga, Bhramari, and Chandika.
Navadvip
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the Hugli
River, about sixty-five miles north of the
city of Calcutta. Navadvip is traditionally
regarded as the birthplace of the Bengali
saint Chaitanya (1486–1533), although
in the twentieth century, the same claim
[[468]]

has been made for the city of Mayapur,
on the other side of the river. For
extensive information about Navadvip,
see E. Alan Morinis, Pilgrimage in the
Hindu Tradition, 1984.
Navaratri
(“nine nights”) Festival dedicated to the
Goddess celebrated twice during the
year. The spring Navaratri occurs during
the bright, waxing half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April), and
the fall Navaratri falls during the bright
half of the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). Each Navaratri
celebration lasts for the first nine nightsNavyanyaya
of these lunar months and concludes
with a festival dedicated to the god
Rama: Ram Navami in Chaitra and
Dussehra in Ashvin. Of the two, the fall
Navaratri is far more important. The fall
Navaratri is celebrated with fervor in the
Bengal region, where the Goddess is the
dominant regional deity. The Bengali
Navaratri is characterized by large pro-
cessions featuring elaborately decorated
clay images of the Goddess. These
images are commissioned by individu-
als, businesses, trade unions, and neigh-
borhood associations. Having the best
image is a sign of great status. During
the weeks around Navaratri, Bengali
children get a holiday from school, state
workers get paid vacation from their
jobs, and the electricity supply
in Calcutta runs without interruptions—
a phenomenon dubbed the Navaratri
“miracle,” since during the rest of
the year shortages and blackouts
are common.
These Navaratri festivals are per-
formed to gain the favor of the Mother
Goddess, particularly in her powerful
forms such as Durga. During these nine
nights devotees (bhakta) perform a vari-
ety of different rites. Some fast
(upavasa) and worship in their homes,
often consecrating temporary images of
the Goddess for use during this festival.
Devotees may also worship young girls
as manifestations of the Goddess, or
sponsor readings of the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important text for
the mythology of the Goddess. They may
also worship the Goddess in her form as
Navadurga, paying homage to a differ-
ent form on each of the nine nights.
Another common practice is to har-
vest shoots of barley, which are some-
times worn on the final day of the
festival. This practice hints at the festi-
val’s purpose since, among other things,
the Goddess represents the female
power of fertility and procreation. In
northern India, the spring festival
comes before the crops are planted.
Wearing sprouting grain is an attempt to
please the Goddess so the crop may
flourish. The fall Navaratri comes after
the harvest, when this promise of
fruition has been fulfilled, and is seen as
a time of thanksgiving for blessings
received. The Goddess also represents
the triumph of good over evil; the read-
ings of the Devimahatmya on these
occasions remind the listeners of the
Goddess’ wondrous deeds and assure
them of her continued protection.
Navyanyaya
(“new Nyaya”) A later branch of the
Nyaya philosophical school. The Nyaya
school was one of the six schools in tra-
ditional Hindu philosophy, which flour-
ished in the early centuries of the first
millennium, but then lost its influence.
The Navyanyaya school developed in
late medieval times (15th–17th c.), in an
attempt to reinvigorate the school and
to resolve some of the problems with the
earlier Nyaya notion of inherence
(samavaya). The earlier Nyayas per-
ceived inherence as a weak relational
force that connected objects and their
qualities—for example, connecting the
color red with a particular ball and thus
making the ball red. It also connected
material objects—the force that held a
clay pot together once the two halves
had been pressed against each other.
Finally, inherence connected selves and
their qualities—one became happy
when inherence connected happiness
to one’s self, and unhappy when unhap-
piness was connected.
This notion of inherence explained
many things in the perceivable world.
However, objections were raised against
the Nyayas’ insistence that inherence
was a single, universal property at work
in different places. According to this
criticism, a universal and eternal inher-
ence could link an object with any
property, including ones that contra-
dict—the color brown with the moon or
the appearance of a cow with a dog.
Other attacks questioned whether
inherence continued to exist after one of
the things it had been connecting was
destroyed. If it did not, opponents
claimed, then inherence was clearly
[[469]]
Nayachandra Suri
nothing to begin with, whereas if it did,
then the remaining connecting power
would exist unconnected to anything,
which was clearly absurd. Finally, some
attacked the need for inherence at all—
which was cited as an example of “need-
less complexity” (gaurava).
The Navyanyaya school attempted to
sidestep these problems by positing a
new class of relationship, that of “self-
linking connectors.” These connectors
were seen as an integral part of all
things, by their very nature, and since
they were self-linking, this eliminated
the need for a separate inherence to
connect things together. In this under-
standing, the relationship and the related
objects are one and the same. This
notion allowed the Navyanyayas to
retain their fundamental assumptions
that there are real objects in the world
and they are connected to one another.

Nayachandra Suri
(14th c.) The author of the Hammira-
mahakavya, a Sanskrit drama that
chronicles the defeat and death of the
Rajput king Hammira by the Delhi sul-
tan Alauddin Khilji in 1301. Aside from
its historical value, this play is notable
because Nayachandra Suri was a Jain
monk. Although Jain monks are subject
to a strict religious lifestyle that would
seem to cut them off from the world,
they have a long history of deep involve-
ment with intellectual and literary cul-
ture. See also mahakavya.
Nayak Dynasty
Southern Indian dynasty whose capital
was in the city of Madurai in the state of
Tamil Nadu. The Nayaks came to power
in the political vacuum created by the
destruction of the Vijayanagar dynasty
late in the sixteenth century. The Nayaks
ruled the southernmost part of the sub-
continent for about the next hundred
[[470]]

years. The dynasty’s greatest ruler was
Tirumalai Nayak (r. 1623–1659), who
constructed large sections of the
Minakshi temple, dedicated to
Madurai’s patron goddess, Minakshi.
Nayanar
Group of sixty-three Shaiva poet-saints,
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and ninth centuries. In concert
with their Vaishnava counterparts the
Alvars, the Nayanars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion vis-à-vis
the Buddhists and the Jains. Both the
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god—Shiva for the Nayanars, Vishnu for
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage. The Nayanars tended to be more
overtly hostile to the Jains. According to
legend the Nayanar Sambandar was
instrumental in the impalement of
eight thousand Jain monks in the city
of Madurai. The hymns of the three
most important Nayanars—Appar,
Sambandar, and Sundaramurtti—com-
prise the Devaram, the most sacred of
the Tamil Shaivite texts. An important
later source is the Periya Puranam by
Cekkilar, which gives hagiographic
accounts for all the Nayanars.
Nayar
The Nayars are a Hindu jati who tradi-
tionally were the primary landholding
community in traditional Kerala. Jatis
are endogamous subgroups of tradi-
tional Indian society whose social status
is determined by the group’s hereditary
occupation. The Nayars were one of the
few groups in India to practice matrilin-
ear succession, in which both descent
and inheritance were passed on
through the mother’s line.
Nazar
(“glance”) The literal meaning of the
word nazar is an unobstructed line of
sight to a person or a thing. The word
nazar is also the term most commonlyNibandha
used to denote the “evil eye,” a malefic
influence that is put on people
through sight, particularly eye-to-eye
contact. The existence of the evil eye is
widely accepted among traditional
Hindus. It is warded off either by
avoiding this sort of gaze, or by per-
forming rites of protection. For fur-
ther consideration see David F.
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan
(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Nepal
A small Himalayan nation on the north-
ern border of India that is deemed the
world’s only Hindu kingdom. One basis
for this claim is that almost 90 percent of
Nepal’s inhabitants identify themselves
as Hindu; the other is that since 1769
Nepal’s ruling house has been a Hindu
dynasty, the Shah dynasty. The present
monarch, Birendra Bir Bikram Shah (b.
[[1945]]
), was an uncontested absolute
monarch until April 1990, when popular
discontent led to a movement seeking
the restoration of democracy in Nepal.
The king was forced to accede to demo-
cratic reforms, and since May 1991 has
governed as a constitutional monarch,
with the Nepali Parliament wielding the
real power.
Although Nepal is a small country, it
has great geographical diversity. Its three
major geographical regions are the sub-
montane lowlands, the Himalayan
foothills, and the high mountains. The
country’s uneven topography further
subdivides each of these regions. This
rugged geography has a marked effect
on the country’s economy, rendering
agriculture impossible at anything more
than a subsistence level. However, it
provides the attraction for tourism,
which is Nepal’s greatest source of for-
eign exchange.
Such great geographical diversity
promotes similar human diversity. The
people of Nepal are an amalgam of
many different groups, including people
whose historical roots lie in India and
indigenous hill tribes associated with
particular parts of the country. Most
Nepalese live in the fertile valleys of the
foothills. These are the most habitable
regions, as the climate in the mountains
is far too harsh for permanent habita-
tion, while the lowland regions are
rife with disease, particularly malaria.
In general, Nepali culture shows
many similarities with the adjoining
areas of India, and thus from a cultural
perspective is firmly fixed in the Indian
cultural orbit. Nepal is also the home to
several important Hindu pilgrimage
places (tirtha), notably Pashupatinath
in the Kathmandu Valley, and
Muktinath, at the headwaters of the Kali
Gandaki River.
New Moon
(amavasya) In northern India, the new
moon usually marks the midpoint of the
lunar month, whereas in southern India
it often identifies the end. Unlike the full
moon, whose associations with fullness
and completion make it always auspi-
cious, the new moon’s associations with
darkness and emptiness make it a more
ambiguous time. One of the most
important festivals in the Hindu reli-
gious year, Diwali, falls on the new
moon in Kartik (October–November).
The new moon can also be highly auspi-
cious on certain other occasions, such
as a Somavati Amavasya, a new moon
falling on a Monday. In general, however,
the new moon is less clearly auspicious
than the full moon. Not only are there
fewer celebrations during the new
moon, but there is also a proportionately
greater number of holidays falling in the
light, waxing half of the lunar month.
The new moon and the dark, waning
half are not in themselves inauspicious,
they are simply deemed less auspicious
than the light half and the full moon.
Nibandha
(“collection”) Genre of thematic com-
mentarial literature that became promi-
nent in medieval northern India. The
nibandhas were compendia of Hindu
lore, in which the compilers culled
[[471]]
Nigantha Nataputta
Leader of a Toda tribe in the Nilgiri Hills.
excerpts on a particular theme from the
Vedas, dharma literature, puranas, and
other authoritative religious texts, and
then compiled them into a single orga-
nized text. Excerpts from these same
authoritative texts on a different theme
would be compiled into a different vol-
ume, and so on. The compilers would
often have to reconcile conflicting texts,
or judge which passage was preferable
to another. Such judgments were gener-
ally done using rules for textual inter-
pretation developed by the Purva
Mimamsa philosophical school, one of
the six schools of traditional Hindu phi-
losophy. The Purva Mimamsa school
had originally developed these rules for
interpreting the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.
In many cases the nibandhas had
between fifteen and twenty volumes,
attempting to provide an exhaustive
investigation of Hindu religious life.
Among the most influential nibandhas
are the Kalpataru, compiled by
Lakshmidhara in twelfth century, and
the Viramitrodaya, compiled by Mitra
Mishra early in the seventeenth century.
[[472]]

Nigantha Nataputta
In early Indian philosophy, a figure
whose views are mentioned in the
Buddhist scriptures. Nigantha advocated
a four-fold self-restraint, although these
sources give no further indication of
his doctrines. It is generally accepted
that Nigantha was the same person
as Mahavira. Mahavira is believed to
have been the last of the Jain
tirthankaras, the founding figures in the
Jain religious tradition.
Night, Goddess of
In the Vedas, the earliest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts, the
gods and goddesses are associated with
phenomena in the natural world. In the
Vedas the goddess Ratri (Night) is men-
tioned both as a goddess and as the
night itself. At times she is seen as life-
giving, allowing people the opportunity
to refresh and renew themselves. At
other times she is associated with the
dangers of the night, such as wild ani-
mals and thieves. Ratri is considered a
sister to Ushas, the dawn. As night and
day alternate, the two goddesses markNimbarki
out the regular passage of time that
characterizes the cosmic order (rta). For
further information on Night and all the
goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Nilachal Hill
Sacred site (tirtha) overlooking the
Brahmaputra River, about six miles out-
side the city of Guwahati in the modern
state of Assam. Nilachal Hill is known
for its temple to the goddess Kamakhya,
one of the most powerful goddess tem-
ples in India. This site is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites sacred
to the Goddess which spreads through-
out the subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess.
The Kamakhya temple is where Sati’s
vulva is said to have fallen to earth; the
image of the goddess is a natural cleft in
the rock around which the temple has
been built. Since Kamakhya sprang from
the most sexually charged part of the
female body, the site is extremely power-
ful. See also pitha.
Nilakanth
(“blue-throated”) Epithet of the god
Shiva; also the name of a manifestation
of Shiva who is enshrined at the
Nilakanth Mahadev temple outside the
city of Rishikesh in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Shiva is present at Nilakanth in
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form. The
mythic charter for this epithet (and for
the establishment of the temple as well)
is drawn from the tale of Churning the
Ocean of Milk. The gods and demons
churn the ocean to produce amrta, the
nectar of immortality thought to be the
finest essence of the ocean. Yet their
action produces not only the amrta, but
also its antithesis, the halahala poison.
This is an event of great peril; the poison
is so powerful that if left unchecked, it
can destroy the earth. When this poison
appears, the gods and demons are
unable to figure out a way to contain it.
Shiva takes care of the poison by holding
it in his throat, but the force of the poi-
son is so great that it turns his throat
blue. See also Tortoise avatar and
ocean, churning of the.
Nilgiri Hills
Range of hills formed by the conjunc-
tion of the Western and Eastern Ghats,
located at the junction of three southern
Indian states—Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and
Karnataka. In earlier times the hills
were occupied by a tribal people known
as the Todas, although only a few thou-
sand Todas are left today. This region is
important for its hill stations, such as
Ootacamund and Kodaikanal, which are
popular spots for vacations, honey-
moons, and movie filming.
Nimbarka
(12th c.?) Ascetic, philosopher, devotee
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and attrib-
uted as the founder of the Sanaka
Sampraday, one of the four Vaishnava
ascetic orders. According to tradition,
Nimbarka was a Telegu (southern
Indian) brahmin who was born in the
city of Paithan in central India, but lived
much of his life in the northern Indian
Braj region, where the god Krishna is
supposed to have lived. Nimbarka’s
philosophical position is described as
dualism-nondualism (dvaitadvaita), a
concept in which God and human
beings are both identical and different.
While earlier Vaishnavas worshiped
Vishnu and Lakshmi as the divine
couple, Nimbarka used the same
concept, but changed the focus to
Krishna and Radha.
Nimbarki
Name for the religious group founded by
the Vaishnava figure Nimbarka. It is
also used as a variant name for the
Sanaka Sampraday, an ascetic commu-
nity that traces its spiritual lineage to
Nimbarka, as a way to reinforce their
religious authority.
[[473]]
Nirakara
Nirakara
(“without form”) Epithet of the divine
reality in its ultimate aspect. According
to many Hindu traditions, God is ulti-
mately without form, transcending all
particularity and superior to any partic-
ular image. This belief is first phrased in
the Upanishads, the speculative reli-
gious texts that are the most recent part
of the Vedas, and is advocated by the
philosophical traditions based on the
Upanishads, such as Advaita Vedanta.
This concept is opposed by certain
Hindu theistic traditions, such as the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
in which a particular deity—in this
case, Krishna—is conceived as the
Ultimate Reality.
Niranjani Akhara
The name of a subgroup of the Naga
class of Dashanami Sanyasis; a particu-
lar type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Sanyasis are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva, organized
into different akharas or regiments on
the model of an army. Until the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century the
Dashanami Sanyasis’ primary occupa-
tion was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these have largely
disappeared in contemporary times.
The Niranjani Akhara is one of the seven
main Dashanami Sanyasi akharas and
along with the Mahanirvani Akhara is
one of the most powerful. This power is
clearly shown by their respective posi-
tions in the bathing (snana) processions
at the Kumbha Mela festivals: in
Haridwar the Niranjani Akhara goes
first, followed by the Mahanirvani; at
Allahabad the order is reversed. In 1962
the Juna Akhara acquired the status of a
separate procession, rather than as a
subsidiary of the Niranjani Akhara.
According to the terms of the 1962
agreement, at Haridwar the Juna Akhara
would lead the Sanyasi processions for
the bathing on the festival of Shivaratri,
followed by the Niranjani and
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjanis
[[474]]

would be first for the other two major
bathing days, followed by the Juna and
Mahanirvani Akharas. The Niranjani
Akhara’s ability to command the premier
position is based primarily on their local
strength: the Niranjani Akhara was quite
powerful in Haridwar, where it still owns
significant property. The Mahanirvani
Akhara, however, was based in
Allahabad. Another sign of the Niranjani
Akhara’s status is that it has as a sub-
sidiary group, the Ananda Akhara.
All of the akharas have particular fea-
tures that define their organizational
identity, especially specific tutelary
deities. The Niranjani Akhara’s tutelary
deity is Skanda, the son of the deities
Shiva and Parvati, and the celestial gen-
eral commanding Shiva’s supernatural
army. Aside from serving as an identify-
ing marker, the choice of a celestial war-
rior reflects the akhara’s influence and
former military strength.
Nirguna
(“without qualities”) Epithet of the
divine reality in its ultimate aspect.
According to many Hindu traditions,
God is ultimately without qualities or
attributes, transcending all particularity
and superior to any qualified form. This
conception is first phrased in the
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that are the most recent part of the
Vedas, and in the philosophical tradi-
tions based on the Upanishads such as
Advaita Vedanta. This belief is opposed
by certain Hindu theistic traditions,
such as the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious
community, in which a particular
deity—in this case, Krishna—is con-
ceived as the Ultimate Reality.
Nirikari
Minor Vaishnava sect founded in the late
[[1700]]
s, by a Ramanandi ascetic named
Baba Sarjudasa. The name comes from
their greeting, Sat Nirikara (“Truth Is
Formless”). Their major areas of influence
and operation are in Punjab, Haryana,
and northwestern Uttar Pradesh.Nirmala Devi
At the Kumbha Mela festival in Haridwar the Niranjani Akhara proceeds first, followed by the Mahanirvani.
Nirjala EkadashiNirmala
Religious observance on the eleventh
day (ekadashi) in the bright, waxing half
of the lunar month of Jyeshth (May–
June). As for all the eleventh-day obser-
vances, this is dedicated to the worship
of the god Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals
have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance. The
regulations for this ekadashi are more
strict than all the others. Not only is all
food forbidden, but the person per-
forming this rite must not drink water,
hence the name nirjala meaning
“waterless.” The fast must last from
dawn till dusk. This is no easy task,
since this ekadashi occurs during the
hottest part of the year. The rewards are
great: Those who fulfill the vow for this
single ekadashi receive the religious
merit for all twenty-four ekadashis dur-
ing the year, whether or not they have
done the rites for the others. Carrying
out the vow for this ekadashi is also
believed to bring one a long life and lib-
eration of the soul after death.(“free from defilement”) With the
Udasis, one of the two Hindu ascetic
communities tracing its origins to the
Sikh community. According to one tradi-
tion, the Nirmala sect was established
by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh.
On the whole, the Sikh tradition has not
endorsed asceticism, but rather an
active life in the world. The Nirmalas
have a large ascetic center in the north-
ern Indian sacred city of Haridwar,
where they run a primary school. As a
community, the Nirmalas are known far
more for learning and study than asceti-
cism or yoga. At the Kumbha Melas, the
Nirmalas bathe last of all, after the
Sanyasis, Bairagis, and Udasis.
Nirmala Devi
(b. 1923) Modern Hindu teacher who
claims to be an avatar of the primordial
Goddess, and the founder of Vishva
Nirmala Dharam, an organization dedi-
cated to spreading her message.
Nirmala Devi’s teaching is based on tra-
ditional ideas of hatha yoga and the
subtle body. The subtle body is an
[[475]]
Nirmohi (“free from illusion”) Ani
alternate physiological system, existing
on a different plane than gross matter,
but corresponding to the material body.
It is visualized as a set of six psychic cen-
ters (chakras) running roughly along
the spine; two divine principles, Shiva
(awareness) and Shakti (power), reside
above and below these centers. In prac-
ticing this yoga, the aspirant aims to
awaken the latent spiritual energy of
Shakti known as kundalini, move it into
union with the Shiva principle at the
crown of the head, and transform the
perishable elements in the gross body to
become immortal.
Nirmala Devi claims to be able to
arouse a devotee’s (bhakta) kundalini
through an infusion of her own spiritual
power, thus dramatically speeding up
the path to liberation. Her Indian devo-
tees are mainly middle-class, but she
also claims to have a substantial follow-
ing in Europe, North America, and
Australia. For a skeptical account of an
encounter with Nirmala Devi, see
Sudhir Kakar, “Cooling Breezes,” in
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Nirmohi (“free from illusion”) Ani
Among the Bairagi Nagas, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees of Vishnu, the
Nirmohis are one of the three Naga anis
(“armies”). The others are the Digambaras
and Nirvanis. In earlier times these anis
were actual fighting units who made
their living as traders and mercenary
soldiers, but in modern times they are
mainly important for determining the
order in the bathing processions at the
Kumbha Mela. Of the three Naga anis,
the Digambaras are by far the most
important and take precedence at the
Kumbha Mela.
Nirriti
(“decay, destruction”) In the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative
Hindu religious texts, Nirriti is a god-
dess personifying all the negative
aspects associated with life. Nirriti’s
personality is not well-defined, for she
[[476]]

is rarely mentioned; the hymns men-
tioning her usually express the hope that
she will stay away and allow the speak-
ers to be free from misfortune. For fur-
ther information on Nirriti and all the
goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Nirukta
(“explanation”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the auxiliary branches of
knowledge associated with the use of
the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Nirukta is concerned with the ety-
mological explanations of archaic
words. This was apparently a serious
problem, since almost one-quarter of
the words in the Veda occur only once,
and with the passage of time their pre-
cise meanings became either unclear or
unknown. The most famous nirukta
text—known simply as the Nirukta—
was written by Yaska the grammarian,
in about the fifth century B.C.E. His work
was immeasurably helpful to later read-
ers, but it is clear that even in Yaska’s
time the meanings for many of these
words had become uncertain and
unclear. Aside from nirukta, the other
Vedangas are vyakarana (Sanskrit
grammar), chandas (Sanskrit prosody),
kalpa (ritual instructions), shiksha (cor-
rect pronunciation), and jyotisha (aus-
picious times for sacrifices).
Nirvani (“liberated”) Ani
Among the Bairagi Nagas, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Vishnu, the Nirvanis are one of the three
Naga anis (“armies”). The others are the
Nirmohis and Digambaras. In earlier
times these anis were actual fighting
units who made their living as traders
and mercenary soldiers, but in modern
times they are mainly important for
determining the order at the bathing
(snana) processions at the Kumbha
Mela. Of the three Naga anis, the
Digambaras are the most important and
take precedence at the Kumbha Mela.Nityasamsarin
Nirvikalpaka
In
certain
schools
of
Indian
philosophy—among them certain
Buddhists, the Nyayas, and the
Prabhakara school of Mimamsa—
nirvikalpaka is the name for a sort of
simple non-conceptual awareness, pro-
duced solely by the operation of the
senses. According to these schools, if the
senses producing this awareness have
no defect, such an awareness is believed
to be true. However, it can be confused
or misinterpreted through the action of
the mind. This belief had important
ramifications for theories of error,
which seek to explain how erroneous
judgments are possible. The schools that
believed in this theory attributed error
to the action of the mind.
Nishkramana
(“going-out”) Samskara
The sixth traditional life-cycle ceremony
(samskara), in which the infant is taken
for his or her first trip outside the house.
Although the traditional texts consider
this a minor rite and the traditional tex-
tual procedures are seldom performed,
a young child’s first outing is often still
carefully planned. On a symbolic level, it
represents the child’s first encounter
with the larger world, and thus the
child’s expanding sphere of possibilities.
It also shows the continuing importance
of rites of protection. Even in modern
India many people believe in the power
of the evil eye (nazar), and young
children are considered particularly
susceptible. Thus, a child’s first
encounter with the chaotic outside
world must be carefully structured and
carefully supervised.
Nishumbha
In Hindu mythology the name of a
demon killed by the goddess Kali in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important text for the mythology of the
Goddess. Together with his brother
Shumbha, Nishumbha is one of the
generals in the army of a demon named
Mahishasura. Due to a divine boon
given to Mahishasura, Shumbha and
Nishumbha are able to vanquish the
gods and assume control of heaven.
However, they are devoured by Kali, who
emerges as a manifestation of the
Goddess’s anger.
Niti Shastra
(“instructions on diplomacy”) General
name for a genre of instruction that
taught politically astute behaviors, such
as making friends and allegiances,
intimidating one’s enemies, and know-
ing who can be trusted. This was a rec-
ognized branch of learning in the
traditional Hindu sciences, and was
taught to influential and royal families,
for whom knowing the real workings
of the world was considered essential
to fulfilling their social functions. The
fables of the Panchatantra convey
these hard-edged lessons on self-
interest and caution through the use of
animal characters.
Nitya Karma
(“perpetual [ritual] action”) One of the
three broad types of ritual action, the
others being naimittika karma and
kamya karma. Nitya karma is ritual
action that is prescribed at regular fixed
intervals, often on a daily basis; one
gains no religious merit from perform-
ing them, but omitting them is consid-
ered a religious demerit. One example of
a nitya karma is the Gayatri Mantra,
which must be recited at morning and
evening worship (sandhya) by every
“twice-born” man who has received the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” Another nitya karma
is the Five Great Sacrifices (panchama-
hayajna), which are daily religious
duties for a “twice-born” householder;
they are rarely performed today.
Nityasamsarin
One of the three classes of beings in the
Dvaita Vedanta philosophical school,
founded by the philosopher Madhva
[[477]]
Nivedita, Sister
(1197–1276). Madhva’s fundamental
belief was that God was utterly tran-
scendent, above and beyond the world
and human beings. The strength of this
conviction led him to stress the impor-
tance of grace as the sole means of sal-
vation, since human beings were
unable to save themselves. Given this
dire view of human capacities, Madhva
divided the beings of the world into
three classes: The muktiyogas were
destined for final liberation, the
nityasamsarins were destined for eter-
nal rebirth, and the tamoyogas were
predestined for eternal damnation.
Nivedita, Sister
(b. Margaret Noble, 1867–1911) Irish dis-
ciple of the modern Hindu teacher
Swami Vivekananda. Nivedita devoted
much of her life to the service of the
Ramakrishna Mission, particularly the
education of Indian women. Nivedita
was born in Ireland and taught in
London, where she met Vivekananda.
She accepted him as her spiritual master
(guru) and came to India with him,
where she founded the Nivedita Girls
School in Calcutta. Nivedita was part of
the first generation of Europeans who
came to India searching for answers to
life’s ultimate questions.
Nivrttinath
(1268–1294?) Elder brother of Jnaneshvar,
the first great poet-saint of the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
Nivrttinath is traditionally named as
Jnaneshvar’s religious teacher (guru),
although his younger brother became
more influential. According to tradi-
tion, Nivrttinath’s guru, Gainanath,
was a direct disciple of Gorakhnath,
the celebrated ascetic. This relation-
ship is indicated in the Jnaneshvari, in
which Jnaneshvar describes himself as
a pupil in Gorakhnath’s line. For fur-
ther information see George Weston
[[478]]

Briggs, Gorakhnath and the Kanphata
Yogis, 1973.
Niyama
(“observance”) In the ashtanga yoga
taught by Patanjali, the second of the
eight constituent elements of yoga prac-
tice. While the first element lists five
injurious actions and dispositions to
avoid, Niyama gives five positive
instructions, shifting the focus from
abstinence to active cultivation. The five
observances are: purity, contentment,
asceticism, study, and making the lord
the motive of all action.
Niyati
(“destiny”) Niyati was the central
philosophical assumption for the
Ajivikas, an ancient and extinct philo-
sophical school. The Ajivikas were
fatalists, who believed that niyati inex-
orably predetermined all things.
Human beings can do nothing to influ-
ence destiny, since they can only do
what has been preordained. The
Ajivikas compared the process of rein-
carnation (samsara) to a ball of string,
which would unroll until it was done,
and then go no further. The word niyati
still carries this sense of “fate” or “des-
tiny,” but with one important differ-
ence: While the Ajivikas conceived
niyati as an impersonal and uncontrol-
lable force, in modern times one’s fate
is believed to result from past karma.
Niyoga
(“appointment”) Practice by which a
childless widow could have intercourse
with her dead husband’s brother, or
some other “appointed” male, in order
to bear a son. The child is considered the
son of the dead man and preserves his
lineage. There is significant disagree-
ment about the propriety of this practice
in the dharma literature. Some of these
texts permit it, although hedged with
numerous conditions, but others
unconditionally condemn it. Niyoga is
one of the practices judged to beNudity
The two most basic genres of Indian classical dance are natya and nrtya. This dancer, performing in the
natya genre, uses dance to tell a story. In the nrtya genre the dance conveys only the dancer's skill.
Kalivarjya, or “forbidden in the Kali
[Age].” Kalivarjya, which first appeared in
the twelfth century, was a legal strategy
used to forbid certain religious practices
that were prescribed in the sacred litera-
ture, but were no longer acceptable in
contemporary times.
Nrtya
In classical Indian dance, the word nrtya
refers to the genre of “pure” dance, in
which the dance conveys nothing more
than the dancer’s skill. Nrtya is one of
the two most basic dance genres. The
other genre, natya, is an acting dance, in
which the dancer’s expressions, move-
ments, and gestures convey a story to
the audience.
Nryajana
(“sacrifice to human beings”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
that is prescribed in the dharma litera-
ture, which describes religious duty.
These Five Great Sacrifices are daily reli-
gious observances prescribed for a
twice-born householder. This is a per-
son who has been born into one of the
three twice-born groups in Indian soci-
ety—brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—
and who has received the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” Each of the five sacrifices
(yajna) is directed toward a different
class of beings—from the Ultimate
Reality of Brahman down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions. The
nryajana is directed toward fellow
human beings, and is satisfied by show-
ing hospitality to one’s guests. Although
Hindu religious life has undergone sig-
nificant changes and some of the other
rites have fallen into oblivion, this rite is
still widely practiced; the ethos of hospi-
tality is still very strong in Hindu society.
Nudity
Nudity is often seen as both inauspi-
cious and forbidden, and is subject to
numerous taboos: according to some
authorities, one should not bathe
(snana) naked (a more understandable
taboo in times when people would
bathe outdoors) and one should not be
naked during sexual intercourse. In
some cases there are also taboos on a
husband seeing his wife naked, since it
is widely believed that this will cause
Lakshmi, the goddess, to forsake her,
taking away her auspiciousness as a
[[479]]
Nyasa
married woman. The exception to this
taboo on nudity is that some ascetics
believe nakedness symbolizes the
renunciation of all possessions and
the rejection of all worldly standards,
including shame. Few ascetics renounce
all clothing; some wear a loincloth in
public, rationalizing that one should not
mislead or scandalize ordinary people
who have limited understanding.
Nyasa
(“laying down”) A characteristic ritual
in tantra, a secret religious practice.
In the practice of nyasa, the person
performing the ritual identifies cer-
tain sounds, often in the form of seed
syllables (bijaksharas), with parts of
the human body, deities, and material
objects. This is done to create a series
of identifications between the macro-
cosm of the universe and the micro-
cosm of the body, such that actions in
the microcosmic ritual sphere will
cause results in its macrocosmic
counterpart.
Nyaya
(“method”) One of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy, con-
cerned with the examination and vali-
dation of the objects of knowledge. It
was the Nyayas who first developed and
codified the notion of the pramanas,
the means by which human beings may
gain true and accurate knowledge. The
Nyayas recognized four such pramanas:
perception (pratyaksha), inference
(anumana), analogy (upamana), and
authoritative testimony (shabda).
These ideas are accepted by virtually all
Indian philosophical schools, and are
the Nyayas’ major contribution to
Indian philosophy.
As did all schools of Indian philoso-
phy, the Nyayas undertook the exami-
nation of knowledge not for mere
speculation, but to find a way to release
the soul from the bondage of reincarna-
tion (samsara). The Nyaya Sutras,
attributed to Gautama, are the
[[480]]

traditional basis for the school. The
sutras begin by asserting that the
means of knowledge and its elements
can bring a person supreme happiness.
The text’s second sutra describes a five-
part causal chain: pain, birth, activity,
defect, and wrong notion. Each of these
elements is caused by the one succeed-
ing it, and is eliminated with the
destruction of its cause. The primary
cause for all of this is “wrong notion,”
hence the Nyaya were concerned with
the investigation of the pramanas.
The Nyayas draw their metaphysics
from the Vaisheshika school, with
whom they become assimilated in the
early centuries of the common era.
Their philosophical perspective is
sometimes described as the “ordinary
person’s conception.” The Nyayas and
Vaisheshika are philosophical realists—
that is, they believe the world is made
up of many different things that exist as
perceived, except in cases of perceptual
error. All things are composed of nine
fundamental substances—the five ele-
ments, space, time, mind, and selves—
and that whatever exists is both
knowable and nameable. The Nyayas
subscribe to the causal model known as
asatkaryavada, which posits that when
a thing is created, it is a new entity,
completely different from its con-
stituent parts. This causal model tends
to multiply the number of things in the
universe, since each act of creation
brings a new thing into being. It also
admits that human efforts and actions
are one of the causes influencing these
affects, making it theoretically possible
to act in a way that brings final libera-
tion of the soul (moksha).
One of the unique features of the
Nyaya school is their belief in inher-
ence (samavaya), a weak relational
force that functions like a glue connect-
ing various things: wholes and their
parts, substances and their attributes,
motions and the things that move, and
general properties and their particular
instances. For the Nyayas, the Self
(atman) is the locus for all experience.
Inherence connects all experiences—Nyaya Sutras
pleasure, pain, happiness, sorrow,
and so forth—to the Self. The philo-
sophical difficulties with inherence—
particularly the notion that it is one
single principle and not a collection of
things—caused the Nyaya school great
difficulty. These assumptions were ulti-
mately responsible for the rise of
Navyanyaya school, which attempted
to explain these relationships in a
more sophisticated way. For further
information see Karl H. Potter and
Sibajiban Bhattacharyya (eds.), Indian
Philosophical Analysis, 1992; and

A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Nyaya Sutras
Foundational text for the Nyaya school,
one of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy. The Nyaya Sutras
are traditionally attributed to the
philosopher Gautama; the most signifi-
cant commentary was written by
Vatsyayana in the fourth century. The
Nyaya Sutras begin with an exposition
of the cause of the human bondage,
explained as stemming from a five-part
causal chain: pain, birth, activity,
defect, and wrong notion. Each of
these elements is caused by the one
succeeding it, and is eliminated with
the destruction of its cause. The root
cause for bondage and reincarnation
(samsara) is thus wrong notions,
which must be corrected to attain final
liberation of the soul (moksha). In
their quest for correct understanding,
the Nyaya Sutras devote great attention
to the pramanas, the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge, and to the rules and
procedures for applying them. The
Nyaya Sutras describe four such pra-
manas: perception (pratyaksha), infer-
ence (anumana), analogy (upamana),
and authoritative testimony (shabda).
These ideas are accepted by virtually all
Indian philosophical schools and are
the Nyayas’ major contribution to
Indian philosophy.
