Baba
In its literal meaning, an affectionate
term of address meaning “father.”
Although this can be used to address
any older man, it is most commonly
applied to ascetics, either in speaking of
them as a class or as a respectful way to
address a particular one.
Babar’s Mosque
See Babri Masjid.
Babri Masjid
(“Babar’s Mosque”) Mosque built in
[[1528]]
 on the outskirts of the city of
Ayodhya, which was constructed at the
order of Mir Baqi, a general of the
Moghul emperor Babar (1483–1530).
The site has long been a source of con-
troversy between the Hindu and Muslim
communities, and British sources
recorded conflicts there in 1855 and
[[1934]]
. Local tradition holds that the
mosque was built on the birthplace of
the Hindu deity Rama, and that it was
constructed only after demolishing the
Hindu temple there, although there is
little hard evidence for the latter claim. A
few months after India gained indepen-
dence in 1947, several local Hindus sur-
reptitiously installed images of the child
Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother
Lakshmana; they spread the tale that
the images had miraculously appeared
in a ball of light. The government had
only recently quieted the Hindu-Muslim
massacres that accompanied the divi-
sion of British India into India and
Pakistan, and it was reluctant to rein-
flame religious passions. Its solution was
to padlock the compound’s gates and
[[76]]

send the case to the courts for resolu-
tion, where it languished for almost
forty years.
The early 1980s saw renewed contro-
versy over the site, when the Hindu reli-
gious organization Vishva Hindu
Parishad (VHP) first began calling for its
“liberation” and proclaiming that the
existing structure was an insult to all
Hindus. This campaign portrayed the
mosque as a symbol of Muslim icono-
clasm. Moreover, it depicted govern-
ment efforts to protect the mosque as an
attempt to appease the Muslim commu-
nity and retain their votes. In 1986 the
VHP’s drive to liberate the site was aided
by the national government headed by
Rajiv Gandhi, which in a patent attempt
to claim Hindu support, unlocked the
compound’s gates so that Hindus could
worship on the site.
The pressure intensified as the
decade progressed, culminating in a
series of campaigns to begin construct-
ing a Hindu temple on the site. Many of
these campaigns coincided with national
elections, and the emotion they generat-
ed helped benefit the electoral fortunes
of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a political
party with close ties to the VHP.
Eventually, on December 6, 1992, the
mosque was demolished. The whole
operation was carefully planned; the
demolition teams were highly trained,
and the first thing they did was to
destroy all the television cameras there
to prevent any media coverage by out-
siders. It was carried out with the bless-
ing of the state government, which
made no attempt to protect the build-
ing. The demolition was followed by
riots, particularly in the state of
Maharashtra, in which over three
thousand people were killed, most of
them Muslims.
Even after the destruction of the
Babri Masjid, the site remained a bone
of contention. Immediately following
the demolition, Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao promised to rebuild the
mosque on the same spot, but he did
nothing to accomplish this during his
time in office. Various Hindu groups,Badrinath

Parts of the temple’s architecture suggest that it may have originally been a Buddhist temple.
including traditional religious leaders
such as the Shankaracharyas, have
been calling for the construction of the
Ram Janam Bhumi temple at the site.
Anticipating nothing but trouble ahead,
the government again has sent the mat-
ter to the courts for resolution, where it
remains to this day and may remain for
four more decades. For further informa-
tion see Sarvepalli Gopal, Anatomy of a
Confrontation, 1991; and Christophe

Movement in India, 1996.in the Veda. Because the Vedanta Sutras
are particularly concerned with the
ideas about the Supreme Reality known
as Brahman, they are also called the
Brahma Sutras. The brevity of the indi-
vidual sutras—many are only a few
words—presupposes
commentary,
which was later provided by various
writers. Badarayana himself considered
the Upanishads the ultimate source for
his teachings, although his text was
judged equally authoritative by later
Vedanta writers.
BadarayanaBadrinath
(ca. 400–200 B.C.E.) Philosopher tradi-
tionally cited as the author of the
Vedanta Sutras. This collection of 555
brief sutras, or aphorisms, is the basis of
the philosophical school known as
Vedanta, so named because it claims to
reveal the ultimate meaning of the reli-
gious scriptures known as the Vedas.
The sutras attempt to summarize and
systematize the philosophic and reli-
gious ideas in the Upanishads, the spec-
ulative texts that form the latest stratum(“Lord of Badri”) Sacred site (tirtha) in
the Himalayan area of Chamoli district
in the state of Uttar Pradesh, near the
headwaters of the Alakananda River,
the largest tributary of the Ganges.
Badrinath is high in the mountains at an
altitude of over 10,000 feet. It is connected
to Tibet by the Mana Pass, one of the tra-
ditional land routes by which Chinese
goods have come into India. Badrinath’s
high altitude also means that it is only
accessible between late April and
[[77]]
Bahi
October, after which it is closed for the
winter months; this pattern is echoed at
Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Kedarnath,
the three major Himalayan pilgrimage
sites. The town’s name comes from its
presiding deity, Vishnu, whose temple
is the reason for the site’s existence. The
main image in the temple is claimed to
have miraculously emerged full-formed
from a shalagram, a particular type of
black stone containing fossilized
ammonite, which is itself considered a
“self-manifested” form of Vishnu.
Badrinath has a long history as a ven-
erable sacred site. Scholars believe that
it was occupied by a Buddhist temple
until several centuries into the present
millennium, based on the architecture
of some of the temple’s older parts. Local
tradition reports that until the middle of
the twentieth century when the Chinese
sealed the Tibetan border, Buddhists
came from Tibet for the temple’s closing
rites in the fall, bringing a hand-woven
blanket to drape around the image. In
Hinduism, Badrinath is one of the four
dhams (“divine abodes”) connected
with the philosopher Shankaracharya.
Shankaracharya reportedly chose one
Hindu sacred center in each corner of
the subcontinent to combat the spread
of Buddhism and revitalize Hindu reli-
gion. At each center he established a
Dashanami Sanyasi monastic center
(math) to train learned monks.
Badrinath is associated with the sacred
center Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath, forty miles south.
Each winter, the image at Badrinath is
symbolically transported to the
Narasimha temple in Joshimath.
According to Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years tem-
ple worship was performed by the
Dandi Sanyasis; they were a group of
ascetics devoted to the god Shiva who
were also Nambudiri brahmins, the
same caste into which Shankaracharya
is supposed to have been born. When
the last of these ascetics died without a
successor in 1776, the local king who
served as the protector of the shrine
invited a non-ascetic Nambudiri brahmin
[[78]]

to serve as the temple’s priest. In defer-
ence to his ascetic predecessors, this
priest was given the title rawal
(“deputy”), and his extended family has
run the shrine since then. The rawal is
the only person allowed to touch the
image, and as a consequence he is
required to remain a bachelor, lest the
ritual impurity (ashaucha) arising from
the birth of a child (sutakashaucha)
render him unable to attend to his
duties. For a long time, the rawals had
sole rights to the offerings given at the
shrine, but since 1939 the temple has
been managed by a committee, and the
rawal has been restricted to ritual duties.
Bahi
(“account book”) Name for the pilgrim
registers maintained by hereditary pil-
grimage priests (pandas). Each panda
family in any sacred site (tirtha) has the
right to serve pilgrims whose ancestral
homes are in a particular place, whether
or not the pilgrims still reside there. For
example, a family from the Marwar
region of the state of Rajasthan will
always be served by the Marwari panda,
even if the family has not lived in
Marwar for generations. Pilgrims make
an entry in their panda’s pilgrim register
during each visit, in which they write
down the date, the names of those who
visited, and the reason or reasons for
which they have come. These details are
noted on a thick sheet of paper about
ten inches wide and three feet long, and
there may be multiple entries on a page.
One of the page’s narrow sides has holes
punched in it, and a string can be
threaded through these holes to tie a
number of such sheets together. This
allows the panda to compile registers for
a particular village or specific family,
and when not in use these bahis are
rolled into a circle and tied.
These registers provide not only a
record of pilgrim visits, but are also the
unassailable evidence of the hereditary
connection between a panda and a pil-
grim family. Most pilgrims will demand
to see the entries for their ancestors asBahula Chauth
proof that a particular priest is their
hereditary panda. This usually happens
when many years have elapsed between
visits, and the pilgrims may never have
met their panda in person. A panda’s
bahis are thus the sole proof of his rights
to a particular pilgrim group, which
makes these registers extremely valu-
able documents. Most pandas zealously
safeguard their bahis, since anyone with
a copy can claim the pilgrims therein.
The bahis’ importance also gives them a
high market value. They may be used as
collateral to gain a loan and can even be
sold outright. This latter course is
extremely unusual, since for working
pandas their bahis are not only the
source of their livelihood, but also their
family inheritance.
Bahina Bai
(1628–1700) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Bahina Bai ran counter to
contemporary assumptions not only
because she was a female religious fig-
ure, but also because she was a brahmin
disciple of the shudra poet-saint
Tukaram, an association that inverted
the usual patterns of social status. This is
because a brahmin is someone of high
social standing while a shudra is of the
lowest and least influential class in
Hindu society. According to tradition,
Tukaram initiated Bahina as his disciple
in a dream because Bahina’s husband—
a learned brahmin who was highly con-
scious
of
brahmin
status—had
forbidden her to meet with him. Aside
from her devotional poetry, Bahina also
wrote an autobiography, whose content
was heavily influenced by her religious
beliefs. Bahina is notable as one of the
only women bhakti (devotional) figures
who was able to reconcile the demands
of her marriage with her commitment to
God, although these issues were not
resolved without considerable trouble
and heartache. For further information
see Justin E. Abbott (trans.), Bahina Bai,
[[1985]]
; and Anne Feldhaus, “Bahina Bai:
Wife and Saint,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 50, 1982.
Bahiryaga
(“external sacrifice”) In Hindu worship,
especially in esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, bahiryaga refers to any
type of religious practice involving
actions, words, or the manipulation of
concrete objects. This is the only kind of
worship that most people perform. The
ultimate goal in tantra, however, is to
internalize these acts through repeated
practice and to transform them into
antaryaga (“internal sacrifice”), in
which all external actions have been
replaced by mental acts.
Bahudaka
(“having much water”) The name for
one of four particular types of Hindu
ascetics. Each of these four types
reflects the ascetic’s supposed means of
livelihood, which in practice has been
much less important for ascetic identity
than organizational affiliation. The
Bahudaka is an ascetic who begs for his
food at sacred bathing places. The other
three types are the Kutichaka, which
has lower status than the Bahudaka, and
the Hamsa and Paramahamsa, which
have higher status.
Bahula Chauth
Religious festival celebrated on the
fourth day (chauth) of the dark, or wan-
ing, half of the lunar month of
Bhadrapada, the sixth month of the
lunar year, which usually falls within
August and September. On this day
mothers perform duties for the welfare
of their sons. They should refrain from
all activity and from eating wheat or rice
(the staple food grains). As a symbolic
indication of allowing mothers to care
for their children, on this day cows are
not milked, and their calves are allowed
to suckle as much as they want.
[[79]]
Baiga
A baiga, or healer, uses spiritual techniques to remedy a person’s physical or emotional troubles.
Such motherly concern for their sons
reflects not only normal maternal
instincts but the importance of male
children in traditional Hindu life.
According to the customary pattern, at
least in northern India, daughters leave
their natal homes to live with their
husbands’ families, whereas sons bring
their brides into the family home. One’s
sons thus ensure the continuity of
the family, in addition to taking care of
the parents in their old age. Sons are
also important because only they can
perform the annual shraddhas, or
memorial rites to the ancestors,
although couples without any natural
sons can satisfy this requirement
through adoption.
Baiga
[[80]]

(probably a corruption of the word
vaidaga, or “healer”) A sorcerer, healer,
and ritual technician connected with
spirits at the lower levels of the pan-
theon; a baiga sometimes acts as a
medium for village deities and at other
times as an exorcist for witches, bhuts,
and prets. A baiga’s power is based on
his command of mantras, sacred
sounds either acquired from a relative as
his hereditary birthright or bought from
a knowledgeable person. Baigas minis-
ter to people’s immediate troubles,
whether caused by illness, misfortune,
accident, or alleged possession. This
pervasive connection with people’s
everyday concerns makes them impor-
tant figures in urban as well as rural
India. The most successful baigas are
those who radiate the greatest air of
authority, and thus instill in their
patients the confidence that the baiga
can and will alleviate their distress. For a
short account of the baiga’s work, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; for a more developed perspective
on Indian healers and healing, see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Baijnath
Sacred site (tirtha) and archeological
area in the Himalayan foothills of the
state of Uttar Pradesh, about forty-Baithak
five miles north and west of the town of
Almora. Baijnath contains a temple
complex believed to date from the thir-
teenth century C.E. Many of the temples
are quite well-preserved, although only
one is still used as a place of worship.
Although the name of the site is a ver-
nacular form of Vaidyanath, a form of
the god Shiva, the presiding deity in the
temple is Shiva’s wife Parvati. Her main
image is over four feet tall and is a mag-
nificent work of art, carved from a piece
of rose-colored granite. Smaller figures
carved into the image itself illustrate the
mythic story of Shiva’s wife Sati, her
rebirth as Parvati, and Parvati’s remar-
riage to Shiva. The statue is clearly the
work of a master sculptor, and it far
exceeds the quality of the artwork one
normally finds in such isolated places.
Another temple in a nearby village has a
statue of Vishnu made from a similar
type of stone and carved in a similar
style. The simplest explanation for this
correspondence is that a single
sculptor was commissioned to create
both images.
Bairagi
(“dispassionate”) This is the general
name for any ascetic whose patron deity
is Vishnu, but it is particularly applied to
the fighting ascetics known as Nagas. See
also Chatuh-Sampradayi Nagas.
Baisakh
According to the lunar calendar by
which most Hindu religious festivals
are determined, Baisakh is the second
month of the lunar year, usually falling
within April and May. This is estab-
lished as one of the months of spring,
but in northern India the weather is
beginning to get quite warm at this
time, especially in the middle of the
day. The major holidays in Baisakh are
Shitalashtami, Baruthani Ekadashi,
Parashuram Jayanti, Narasimha
Jayanti, Baisakhi, Mohini Ekadashi,
and Buddha Purnima.
Baisakhi
Annual festival taking place in the
lunar month of Baisakh (April–May),
for which it is named. Baisakhi marks
the sun’s transition into Aries, which
according to the Indian estimation
occurs around April 14. This festival
marks the beginning of the solar year
on the traditional calendar. Baisakhi
is celebrated mainly in the north, par-
ticularly in the state of Punjab and its
surrounding regions. In the days when
pilgrims still traveled through the
Himalayas on foot, this festival
marked the beginning of the
Himalayan pilgrimage season; during
the eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies, Baisakhi was the occasion for
a great trading festival in the town of
Haridwar, the gateway to the
Himalayan shrines. Although this fair
has long been eclipsed, Baisakhi is
still the climactic bathing (snana)
day for the Haridwar Kumbha Mela
and Ardha Kumbha Mela, each of
which is a bathing festival that occurs
about every twelve years when
Jupiter is in the sign of Aquarius (for
the Kumbha Mela) or Leo (for the
Ardha Kumbha Mela).
Baithak
(“seat”) In the Vaishnava sect
known as the Pushti Marg, a reli-
gious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Krishna, the baithaks are a group of
[[108]]
 sacred sites (tirthas). Each site
is somehow associated with the life
and activities of the philosopher
Vallabhacharya, the Pushti Marg’s
founder. Most of these baithaks are
in well-established sacred areas that
were considered holy long before
Vallabhacharya’s time, but the char-
ter story for each baithak records
some activity of the philosopher in
that particular place, to further
sanctify it for his followers. These
baithaks create a sectarian network
within the existing pilgrimage
[[81]]
Bajrang Dal
places and imbue each one with
additional significance for the
Pushti Marg.
Bajrang Dal
(“Hanuman’s Host”) The Bajrang Dal
is a modern Hindu organization that
has strong connections with the Hindu
nationalist Vishva Hindu Parishad
( VHP ), although both are nominally
independent. The Bajrang Dal is
sometimes characterized as the VHP’s
“youth wing,” and its primary function
is to aid the VHP in carrying out its reli-
gious, political, and social campaigns,
particularly by supplying members to
build a crowd. The god Hanuman is
best noted for his prodigious strength,
and it is this quality that the Bajrang
Dal seems to have emphasized in
choosing him as their symbol.
Membership is open to young men
from all social strata, but the organiza-
tion reportedly draws much of its fol-
lowers from lower-caste groups.
Although local chapters of the Bajrang
Dal often perform social services and
philanthropic activities (as one might
find with any organized group), as a
whole the organization is widely seen
as an instrument of the VHP, to be used
when the situation calls for producing
a crowd, intimidation, or violence.
Baka
In Hindu mythology, a demon killed by
the god Krishna during Krishna’s
childhood in Braj. Baka is one of the
demon assassins sent by Krishna’s
wicked uncle, Kamsa, to try to get rid
of the god. He comes to Braj in the
form of a giant crane (baka) and swal-
lows Krishna and his companions, but
he is killed when Krishna expands to
such a giant size in Baka’s stomach that
the demon explodes.
Bakasur
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Bakasur is a fero-
[[82]]

cious man-eating demon. To preserve
their lives, the local villagers send
Bakasur a daily sacrificial victim who
is chosen by lot, along with a wag-
onload of food that the demon also
eats. One day the lot falls to the brah-
min who is hosting the Pandavas, the
five heroic brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. When the brothers’
common wife, Draupadi, discovers
what has happened, she asks one of
the brothers, Bhima, to deliver the
food in the brahmin’s place. Bhima
drives the wagon to the cave, goads
the demon into battle by eating the
food in front of him, and then slays
Bakasur with one mighty blow.
Baksheesh
(from the Persian word bakhshidan,
meaning “to give”) A gift, usually of
money, given to facilitate service. This
is usually paid in advance but can also
be given after the fact. In some cases
this is unabashed bribery, but most
often it is simply a way to ensure con-
tinuing service and attention, or a gra-
tuity for services already rendered.
Balabhadra
Epithet of the mythic hero Balarama,
the god Krishna’s older brother.
Although he is a fairly minor mythic
figure, he is important for his connec-
tion with the temple of Jagannath in
the city of Puri. The temple’s presid-
ing deity is Jagannath (“Lord of the
World”), a tribal god who has been
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon
as a form of Krishna. The image of
Jagannath appears together with two
other images, Balabhadra and their
sister Subhadra, and the three deities
invariably appear as a group.
The poet Jayadeva, in his list of the
ten avatars (“divine incarnations”)
typically associated with the god
Vishnu, named Balabhadra as the
eighth avatar, the place normally
occupied by Krishna. According to
Jayadeva, Jagannath/Krishna is not aBalarama
form of Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality
from whom all the avatars spring.
Balaji
Popular epithet of the god Venkateshvara,
the presiding deity of the temple of the
same name at Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh. See Venkateshvara.
Balaji
(2) Presiding deity of the Balaji temple
in Mehndipur village, Rajasthan, who
is considered a form of the monkey-
god, Hanuman. As an infant, Hanuman
is continually hungry, and one day he
attempts to eat the sun. Indra, the king
of the gods and ruler of heaven, is
incensed at Hanuman’s action and
strikes him with a thunderbolt, break-
ing his jaw (hanu). The wind-god, who
is Vayu, Hanuman’s father, goes on
strike to protest this punishment. Since
in traditional Indian physiology, winds
are considered responsible for all inter-
nal functions, including digestion, res-
piration, and elimination, Vayu’s strike
means that no one can live a normal
life. After a short time, the gods realize
their predicament and beg Vayu for for-
giveness; the deity is placated when
each of the gods promises to give
Hanuman a divine gift. By virtue of
these gifts, Hanuman gains great
power; not only is he immensely
strong, but he is an expert healer,
through both his skill in using herbs
and natural medicines and his magical
abilities to protect people from malev-
olent supernatural beings.
These powers and healing qualities
make Hanuman a strong protective
deity, and he is often worshiped on days
and at times deemed inauspicious or
unfavorable. These protective attributes
have made him enormously important
in contemporary Hindu life despite
his theoretically intermediate place in
the divine pantheon, and these qualities
are especially evident in his form as
Balaji. His temple has gained regional
prominence as a healing center for
people possessed by malevolent spirits
known as bhuts and prets. The
exorcisms proceed in a quasi-judicial
fashion, with the spirits being hauled
into the divine court, tried, and
banished from the sufferer with the
underlying assumption that these rites
succeed through Balaji’s irresistible
healing powers. As Sudhir Kakar has
masterfully shown, the language associ-
ated with possession and exorcism,
when understood in the context of tradi-
tional Hindu culture, can be seen as
a way of describing what modern
psychiatrists might call the diagnosis
and treatment of mental illness. See
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Balakrishna
Figure of Krishna in the form of a child
(bala). Devotees (bhakta) who worship
this form of Krishna are partaking in the
devotional relationship known as
vatsalya bhava, which parallels the
connection between parent and child.
The unusual twist is that the devotee
takes the role of the parent, lavishing
love and care on the deity in its child
form in a warm, protective, and
intimate relationship.
Balarama
Krishna’s older brother. According to
most estimations, Balarama is a partial
avatar, or incarnation, of Shesha, a ser-
pent upon whom the god Vishnu
reclines as on a couch. Shesha takes
human form as Balarama, and Vishnu
takes human form as Krishna, to destroy
the evil king Kamsa. Kamsa has impris-
oned their parents, Vasudeva and
Devaki, because on their wedding day a
disembodied voice has foretold that
Devaki’s eighth child will kill Kamsa.
Kamsa kills Devaki’s first six children at
birth by flinging them onto stones, but
Balarama is saved when the embryo in
Devaki’s womb is magically transplant-
ed into the womb of Vasudeva’s second
wife, Rohini. Because of the unusual

where it was transformed by the influence of both Buddhist and indigenous religious beliefs.
circumstances surrounding his develop-
ment in utero, Balarama is also known
as Sankarshana (“dragging away”).
Balarama is raised with Krishna in
Nanda and Yashoda’s household and
takes part in many of Krishna’s adven-
tures, including the slaying of Kamsa.
Balarama is usually portrayed as hav-
ing a fair complexion, whereas Krishna
is dark. According to one story, when the
gods approach Vishnu to take form on
earth, he plucks both a white hair and a
black hair from his head. The former is
born to Rohini as Balarama, the latter to
Devaki as Krishna.
Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda presents a
different picture of Balarama. Jayadeva
is closely linked to the Jagannath tem-
ple in Puri, whose presiding deity
(Jagannath) has been assimilated into
the pantheon as Krishna. For Jayadeva,
Jagannath/Krishna is not a form of
Vishnu but the Ultimate Reality from
whom all the avatars spring. Jayadeva
incorporates Balarama into the pan-
theon as the eighth avatar, to fill the
[[84]]

place left by Krishna’s promotion to
supreme god.
Bali
In Hindu mythology Bali is a demon
who is tricked by Vishnu into granting
the god three paces of land of his own.
Bali does this with little thought because
Vishnu has come in the form of a dwarf
(vamana), but when the gift has been
given, Vishnu grows immensely large
and claims the whole universe, relegat-
ing Bali to the Patala underworld. See
also Vamana avatar.
Bali
(2) In Hindu mythology, a monkey-king
in the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics. Bali and Sugriva are
brothers who together rule the kingdom
of Kishkindha, but enmity develops
between them, and Bali drives away his
brother and takes Sugriva’s wife. After
the abduction of the god Rama’s wife
Sita, Sugriva meets with Rama and theBania
god’s brother Lakshmana, and they
agree that Rama will help Sugriva regain
his wife and kingdom if Sugriva and his
monkey-subjects will help to search for
Sita. Sugriva challenges Bali to battle but
cannot compete with his superior
strength. Although Rama has agreed to
shoot Bali with an arrow, he is unable to
tell which of the monkeys he is. In a sec-
ond battle, when Sugriva is marked by a
garland, Rama shoots Bali with an arrow
from behind and kills him.
Bali
(3) Island in Indonesia that has the last
surviving remnant of the Hindu-
Buddhist culture that pervaded the
region after the early centuries of the
common era. Indian beliefs were first
brought by traders and merchants, and
inscriptions reveal that the Balinese
kings patronized a variety of sects, both
Hindu and Buddhist. In time, Indian
sacred geography was transferred and
transposed to Bali, native deities were
gradually assimilated into the pantheon,
and all the competing sects finally were
fused into the new entity known as
Balinese religion.
Bana
(“arrow”) One of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography, which is
associated with various deities—the
Goddess, Shiva, and Vishnu—and is
thus emblematic of no particular one. It
is often found in images in which the
figure carries a bow (dhanus).
Bana
(2) (7th c. C.E.) Poet and author who was
a contemporary of the northern Indian
emperor Harsha (r. 606–647), and one of
the leading members of Harsha’s court.
Bana is widely acclaimed as one of the
great Sanskrit writers, based on his two
best works: the Harshacharita, a pane-
gyric narrative of Harsha’s deeds, and
Kadambari, a romance left unfinished
at his death. He is also famous for his
Chandishataka, a collection of one

hundred poems dedicated to the
differing forms of the Goddess.
Bana Linga
An egg-shaped stone considered a
svayambhu (“self-manifested”) form of
the god Shiva. As with all svayambhu
images, the bana linga is considered to
be extraordinary, since in it the god has
spontaneously revealed himself. Bana
lingas are only found in certain places,
particularly on the banks of the
Chambal River in the state of Madhya
Pradesh, where they can be found in
large numbers. They come in a wide
spectrum of colors and can be several
feet in width, although most are smaller.
The smaller ones are movable and may
even be carried by wandering ascetics as
portable objects of worship. The larger
ones are usually found only in temples,
not only because of the limits on motion
imposed by their greater size, but also
because they are believed to be so pow-
erful that they should be kept in a care-
fully maintained place.
Bania
(variant of Baniya) In traditional north-
ern Indian society, a merchant or shop-
keeper often but not exclusively
belonging to the vaishya varna, which is
the third of four social classes in Hindu
culture. Aside from their merchant
activities, the more prosperous ones
often engaged in moneylending, some-
times at prodigious rates of interest, as a
way to further increase their capital. In
[[85]]
Banjara
traditional lore, banias are invariably
painted as greedy and avaricious people
who care about nothing but money.
Although they were often stereotyped as
parasites, banias were a necessary part
of the traditional agricultural economy,
because they gave farmers goods on
credit to be repaid after the harvest.
They also lent farmers money to get
started again after a bad harvest. Both
groups thus depended on one another—
the farmers for capital, the banias for
continuing consumption and patron-
age. For a masterful reconstruction of
the ethos in the northern Indian mer-
chant family, in which Hindu piety was
an important element, see C. A. Bayly,
Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars, 1983.
Banjara
The model for traditional Indian society
was a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation. In traditional northern
Indian society, the Banjaras were a jati
whose hereditary occupation was dri-
ving pack animals, either as peddlers
selling retail goods to people in more
remote places or as transporters
conveying commodities from one seller
to another. They appear in poems by
some of the bhakti (devotional) poets,
particularly by Ravidas, as a symbol of
human heedlessness or as a person who
never stops moving to reflect on where
he has been.
Banking
In traditional Hindu culture, banking
was often an extension of a merchant
family’s economic life, particularly in
times and places in which centralized
banking did not exist. In most cases
these families transacted their business
using letters of credit known as hundis,
which enabled them to conduct busi-
ness over large distances without the
risk of transporting gold and silver bul-
lion. By the early 1800s, these hundis
[[86]]

functioned as virtual currency in much
of India, since in some cases they were
used in twenty or thirty transactions
before eventually being returned to the
issuing family for cashing. This system
made a merchant family’s creditworthi-
ness its most valuable asset. Once this
was lost, the family’s hundis were no
longer honored, and they were unable to
conduct business. Since the evaluation
of a family’s credit was often tied to
judgments about its character, mer-
chant families strove to cultivate the
image of seriousness, dependability,
and thrift. In this ethos the only accept-
able forum for lavish expenditures was
for religious endowments, since these
reinforced the family’s pious image and
thus enhanced their creditworthiness.
With part of their surplus capital, these
families would usually engage in
moneylending as one way to increase
their wealth; the largest families
routinely lent money to royalty, which
provided them with even greater status.
For a masterful picture of the merchant
family ethos in northern India, see
C. A. Bayly, Rulers, Townsmen, and
Bazaars, 1983.
Barahmasa
(“twelve months”) Poetic genre in which
each of the poem’s verses, or stanzas, is
devoted to one month of the year, with
the months treated in chronological
order. This is a purely vernacular genre
for which there are no known instances
in Sanskrit. Barahmasa poems often
reveal a great deal about everyday life
and can be subdivided into several basic
categories: an enumerative type, which
describes appropriate activities for each
month such as farming or religious
practice; a narrative form, which
recounts a woman’s longing (viraha) for
her absent lover; and a type describing a
young wife’s trial of chastity as she with-
stands various temptations during an
extended separation from her husband.
For further information see Charlotte
Vaudeville, Barahmasa in Indian
Literature, 1986.Basavanna
Barat
One of the common elements in a
modern northern Indian marriage
ceremony, in which the groom is
brought in a procession to the wed-
ding site, escorted by his (mostly
male) relatives and friends. The barat
evokes the symbolism of a royal pro-
cession in which the groom is the king,
at least for the day. The groom most
commonly rides a gaily decorated
white mare, although any means of
transportation
representing
his
importance is acceptable—from an
elephant to a horse-drawn carriage to
an automobile strung with garlands.
In keeping with the royal imagery, the
groom often wears a crown or orna-
ments made of tinsel. The entire pro-
cession is usually accompanied by a
marching band, in the role of the her-
alds who march before the royal pres-
ence; the band will often stop along
the way to play, at which time the par-
ticipants will dance around them.
Although the groom usually remains
reserved throughout the barat—in
keeping with the gravity of the occa-
sion—for the rest of his companions, it
is a time for joking, laughing, dancing,
and celebration immediately before
the wedding. The barat may also
involve the consumption of liquor,
although many more conservative
Hindus frown upon this element.
Barsana
A village in the Braj region of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, which is most famous as
the birthplace of the god Krishna’s lov-
ing companion, Radha.
Baruthani Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark, or waning, half
of the lunar month of Baisakh, which
takes place within April and May. The
festival is dedicated to the worship of
Vishnu, especially in his Vamana
avatar, which is his fifth incarnation.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites, usually involving fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those observing this rit-
ual should abstain from anger and
backbiting and eat food that is pre-
pared without salt or oil. The name
Baruthani means “armored” or “pro-
tected,” and faithfully observing this
festival is believed to protect one from
all evil and grant enormous good for-
tune. In the charter myth, an ascetic
whose foot has been chewed off by a
wild beast regains the limb by per-
forming this ritual.
Basavanna
(1106–67/68) Poet-saint and religious
leader in the Lingayat community, a
bhakti (devotional) group that wor-
ships Shiva as the single supreme God
and rejects all caste regulations. The
Lingayats were formed in the south-
ern Indian state of Karnataka where
they still have a considerable pres-
ence, and the collections of poetry
that form their most important reli-
gious texts are composed in the
Kannada language. According to tra-
dition, from his youth Basavanna was
a great devotee (bhakta) of Shiva,
whose piety was so intense that he
rejected all notions of ritual and caste.
After spending much of his youth as a
religious seeker, Basavanna became
minister to a king named Bijjala.
Basavanna used his position’s wealth
and influence to care for Shiva’s wan-
dering devotees (jangama), and
Bijjala’s court became a magnet for
many important figures, including the
poet and religious leader Allama
Prabhu. Basavanna’s patronage was
vital in forming the Lingayat commu-
nity, and as a token of his importance,
the suffix anna (“elder brother”) was
attached to his name, Basava. As the
Lingayat community grew stronger,
their public opposition to ritual wor-
ship and caste distinctions generated
intense hostility from more tradition-
al groups. This conflict finally came to
[[87]]
Basohli
a violent head when the fledgling
Lingayat community apparently arranged
a marriage between an untouchable boy
and a brahmin girl. Traditionalists
became so enraged that they executed the
bride and groom’s fathers. The Lingayat
community
was
dispersed,
and
Basavanna died soon afterward. For fur-
ther information see A. K. Ramanujan
(trans.), Speaking of Siva, 1973.
Basohli
A town west of Jammu in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir, close to the bor-
der of Himachal Pradesh. Although it is
an insignificant place in modern times,
in the seventeenth century, Basohli was
the capital of a small kingdom in the
Shiwalik Hills. It was in Basohli that the
Pahari style of miniature painting first
appeared. The Basohli version of that
style is characterized by highly defined
profiles, sharply flattened perspective,
and broad bands of a single intense
color for backgrounds. It serves as a
transitional style between the so-called
Rajasthani and the more developed
techniques of the Pahari schools.
Bathing
See snana.
Baudhayana
(6th–3rd c. B.C.E.) Sage, writer, and com-
mentator. Baudhayana is the author of
one of the three surviving religious texts
known as the Kalpa Sutras. Apastamba
and Hiranyakeshin wrote the other two
Kalpa Sutras. Each of the surviving
works contains the three elements dic-
tated for a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for
Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras), prescrip-
tions for domestic rites (Grhya Sutras),
and prescriptions for appropriate
human behavior (Dharma Sutras). All
three of the authors belonged to the
same school, the Taittiriya school of the
Black Yajur Veda. According to tradition,
Baudhayana was the oldest, Apastamba
was his disciple, and Hiranyakeshin was
Apastamba’s disciple. This relative
chronology is supported by the texts
themselves, since Baudhayana’s work is
much less organized than the others, his
language is more archaic, and he is often
less strict in his opinions. His texts gain
their primary importance as a source for
his successors.
Bath, Mohenjo-Daro
One of the most striking structures exca-
vated at Mohenjo-Daro, the first city of
the Indus Valley civilization to be dis-
covered. This bath is an oblong pool,
thirty-nine by twenty-three feet in area
and eight feet deep. It is built of brick
and sealed with pitch. The tank could be
drained through an opening in one cor-
ner, and it was surrounded on all four
sides by small rooms reminiscent of
changing rooms. The Indus Valley cities
gave great attention to plumbing, sani-
tation, and sewers, suggesting that
bathing (snana) may have been con-
nected with ritual purity as in modern
Hindu life. With this in mind, the bath
was probably not a swimming pool but
rather had some deeper connection
with religious life. For further informa-
tion see Walter Ashlin Fairservis, The
Roots of Ancient India, 1975.
[[88]]

Begampura
Fictional city named in one of the
poems written by the poet-saint
Ravidas (ca. 1500). The word begam can
mean either “queen” or “without pain.”
The poem clearly shows the city as an
idealized place far from the tribulations
of ordinary human life, such as pain,
sorrow, taxes, wrongdoing, and to a
lesser extent, class distinctions.
Although Ravidas was born a tanner
(chamar), an occupation that was
looked down upon, this is one of his
only poems that speaks about social
issues, however indirectly.
Begging
One of the recognized means of liveli-
hood in traditional Hindu society that is
a sign of either very low or very highBegram
Beggars sitting outside of a religious fair in Allahabad.
When beggars receive alms, they are also believed to receive the giver’s bad luck.
status, depending on the circumstances.
Some beggars are simply people who are
desperately poor, disabled, or unable to
provide for themselves and their fami-
lies and who must depend upon gifts
(dana) to survive. Such beggars have
extremely low social status, although
they may make a fairly decent living,
particularly if they live in a favorable
environment such as a pilgrimage place
(tirtha), where giving gifts is a common
religious act. Aside from all of the obvi-
ous disadvantages—low social status, an
uncertain income, and having to endure
scorn and verbal abuse—these beggars
also suffer the stigma of living on
charity, rather than earning an income.
This is karmically undesirable since
giving gifts is one of the methods by
which people get rid of inauspiciousness,
which is transferred to the receiver
along with the gift. In many cases such a
beggar is considered nothing more
than an instrument to be used, and the
most common word for such a person is
patra (“vessel”).
Some ascetics also make their living
by begging but fall into a completely dif-
ferent category. In the ideal case, these
are people who have given up all visible
means of support as part of an effort to
renounce the world; this differentiates
them from the poor, who are part of
ordinary society, albeit at the lowest
level. There is general social approval for
supporting ascetics, at least the ones
who are considered genuine spiritual
seekers, and doing so is widely seen as a
source of religious merit. Although it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish poorer
ascetics from ordinary beggars, in the
case of the most respected ascetics the
distinction is very clear. Such respected
ascetics confer status on people by
accepting their gifts, and consequently
they tend to screen the donors and their
motives very carefully to protect their
reputations. See also karma.

Architectural site west of the city of
Kabul
in
modern
Afghanistan.
Excavations there have revealed arti-
facts from Kushana culture, primarily
relief carvings on ivory plaques.

Bel
BelBelur Math
Another name for the bilva tree.
See bilva.World headquarters of the Ramakrishna
Mission, a modern religious organiza-
tion. The Ramakrishna Mission was
founded
in
[[1897]]

by
Swami
Vivekananda, the most famous disciple
of the nineteenth-century Bengali
mystic Ramakrishna. The Mission is
equally dedicated to both social service
and spiritual uplift, based on
Vivekananda’s realization that India
needed concrete development as much
as religious teaching. Belur Math was
constructed in 1899, two years after
the Ramakrishna Mission was founded.
It is located just north of Calcutta on
the west side of the Hugli River, quite
close to the Dakshineshwar temple
where Ramakrishna lived for most of
his adult life.
Belagave
Village in the Shimoga district of the
state of Karnataka. Belagave was the
most important center for the
Kalamukhas, which was an ascetic sect
of devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
The Kalamukhas had an important his-
torical role in southern India between
the tenth and thirteenth centuries,
but they disappeared some time after
that. Their ritual center in Belagave
was the temple of Kedareshvara, which
was Shiva in his form as the lord of
Kedara. Although the Kalamukhas
have disappeared, their presence and
prominence in the region are confirmed
by the inscriptions at this and
numerous other temples.
Belur
Town in the state of Karnataka, about
sixty miles northwest of the modern city
of Mysore. As at its sister site, Halebid,
Belur is known for a magnificent collec-
tion of temples built by the Hoysala
dynasty, which ruled western Karnataka
from the eleventh to thirteenth cen-
turies C.E. At both sites the temples were
built from a particular type of stone—
variously described as chlorite schist,
steatite, or soapstone—that was quite
soft when newly quarried but gradually
hardened with exposure to the air. This
initial malleability made the stone easy
to carve and facilitated the lush detail
characteristic of Hoysala temples.
Architecturally speaking, these temples
have certain unique features: a central
hall connecting three star-shaped sanc-
tuaries, and temple towers (shikharas)
composed of well-defined horizontal
tiers rather than the continuous upward
sweep characteristic of the northern
Indian Nagara architectural style.
[[90]]

Benares
City and sacred center (tirtha) on the
banks of the Ganges in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Benares is an anglicized form
of Varanasi, one of the traditional Hindu
names for the city, as well as Kashi and
Avimukta. All three of these names are
used to designate the entire city, but in a
more specific context, they denote con-
centric sacred zones surrounding the
Vishvanath temple; Avimukta is the
smallest, then Varanasi, and finally
Kashi. As with all other pilgrimage
places on the Ganges, Benares is consid-
ered sacred because of its proximity to
the river, particularly because at Benares
the Ganges flows in a northerly direc-
tion, which is considered auspicious.
The Ganges is an integral part of the
identity of Benares, and much of the
city’s religious life centers around it.
The most important sacred presence
in the city, however, is the god Shiva.
Benares is the city of Shiva, his dwelling
place on earth, and the site he never
leaves, hence the name Avimukta
(“never forsaken”). Temples to Shiva are
scattered throughout the city—some
old, some new, some nearly forgotten—
but the most important is the
Vishvanath (“Lord of the Universe”)Betel
temple. Vishvanath is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sites deemed
particularly sacred to Shiva. The original
Vishvanath temple was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, who built
a mosque on the site; the present
Vishvanath temple was rebuilt next to
the original location. Shiva’s eternal
presence makes Benares one of the
seven sacred cities, in which death
brings liberation of the soul (moksha).
At the moment of death, Shiva is
believed to come to the dying person
and impart his salvific wisdom. Shiva’s
presence is also evident at the crema-
tion ground at the sacred site
Manikarnika Ghat, which is in the very
heart of the city rather than at the mar-
gin as in most other places. Here too
Shiva teaches human beings a lesson;
specifically, Shiva reminds them of their
imminent death. This is not to distress
or depress them, but to spur them on to
serious religious life.
The presence of the Ganges and
Shiva make Benares an ideal place to
die, or to immerse oneself in spiritual
life; what is often overlooked is that
Benares is also an unusually vibrant
place to live. It has a long history as a
trading center and market town, and it
remains so today even though the creak-
ing wooden boats traversing the Ganges
have been supplemented by other
means of transport. Benares is famous
for its artisans, particularly weavers and
metalworkers, many of whom are
Muslim. It has also been renowned as a
cultural center for at least a thousand
years. Benares is still one of the most
important centers in India for all
branches of traditional Sanskritic learn-
ing, from grammar to astrology to med-
icine. It is likewise a center for music,
dance, and all of the arts and has been
home to a galaxy of Indian religious fig-
ures, including the poet-saints Tulsidas,
Ravidas, and Kabir. For a detailed expo-
sition of the city and its life, see Diana
Eck, Banaras, 1999.
Benares Hindu University
Indian educational institution founded
in 1916 by the nationalist figure Madan
Mohan Malviya (1861–1946). The World
War I era marked a more activist orien-
tation to the Indian independence
movement. One of the ways this
activism manifested itself was in found-
ing educational institutions, which gave
Indians greater control over the univer-
sities’ mission, tone, and curriculum.
Benares Hindu University was founded
to uphold Hindu cultural and philo-
sophical traditions, but also to educate
its students in the sciences and thus pre-
pare them for the modern world. This
mission reflected the modernist think-
ing of its founders as well as their pas-
sionate commitment to traditional
Hindu culture. It is still one of the finest
universities in India, particularly for the
study of classical Indian culture.
Bengali
Modern Indian language in the Indo-
European language family, spoken in
the region of modern Bengal, for which
it is named. Like many of India’s region-
al tongues, Bengali has a long history as
a literary language in its own right. In
the nineteenth century, Calcutta was the
most important cultural center in India
as well as a hotbed of resistance to
British rule. As the vernacular tongue,
Bengali was used in that era’s revolu-
tionary politics, particularly by Bankim
Chandra Chatterjee and Aurobindo
Ghose; it was also the language used by
religious figures such as Ramprasad
and Ramakrishna.
Betel
Common name for the small, hard nut
from the areca palm tree, which is con-
sumed by mixing slices of the nut with
lime, tobacco, and spices and wrapping
the whole thing up in a betel leaf. This is
not eaten but lodged against the cheek
and slowly chewed, to let the juices flow.
This method of gradually absorbing the
juice may be the reason for its most

common name, pan (“drinking”). The
nut turns the saliva a bright red color,
which is the reason for the distinctive
crimson smears adorning many Indian
buildings. Chewing betel is widely
believed to be good for the digestive
tract, a genuine concern in a country
where intestinal upsets are still quite
common. Chewing betel is such a
deeply embedded part of sophisticated
Indian cultural life that it even has its
own aesthetic, and folding betel is one
of the sixty-four arts mentioned in the
Kama Sutra .
Bhadrakali
(from bhadra, meaning “blessed” in
Sanskrit) In Hindu mythology, the epithet
of a powerful and terrifying form of the
Goddess. According to one version of the
story, Bhadrakali’s birth is associated with
the death of Shiva’s first wife, Sati. Sati goes
to a great sacrifice sponsored by her father,
Daksha. When Daksha intentionally and
publicly insults her husband Shiva, in her
anger and shame, Sati immolates herself in
the sacrificial fire. When Shiva learns of
Sati’s death, he is so enraged that he plucks
two matted locks (jata) from his head and
[[92]]

dashes them to the ground. The first takes
form as Virabhadra, a wrathful and terrify-
ing form of Shiva, and the second takes
form as Bhadrakali. Just as Virabhadra
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,
Bhadrakali symbolizes the ferocious and
dangerous side of the Goddess, in contrast
with the gentle and loyal Sati. Shiva orders
the two to destroy Daksha’s sacrifice, which
they do with great abandon.
Bhadrakali also appears in the stories
connected with the birth of the god
Krishna. While Krishna is developing in
his mother, Devaki’s, womb, Bhadrakali
enters the womb of Krishna’s foster
mother, Yashoda. The two children are
born on the same night, and under cover
of darkness they are switched with one
another. The next morning the baby girl is
snatched from Devaki by her stepbrother,
Kamsa, the wicked king of Mathura, who
dashes out the child’s brains on a rock;
this is just as he has done with Devaki’s six
other children because it has been fore-
told that one of them will kill him. From
the infant’s corpse arises an eight-armed
figure of the Goddess, who taunts Kamsa
that his destroyer has already escaped
and then disappears.Bhagavad Gita
Bhadrapada
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Bhadrapada is the sixth
month of the lunar year, usually falling
within August and September. This is
one of the months associated with the
monsoon rains. The major festivals in
Bhadrapada are Kajari Teej (Teej),
Bahula
Chauth,
Janmashtami,
Radhashtami, Aja Ekadashi, Hartalika
Teej
(Teej),
Ganesh Chaturthi,
Rishi Panchami, Parivartini Ekadashi,
Anant Chaturdashi, and in southern
India, Onam.
Bhadrasana
(“decent posture”) In yoga practice this
is one of the sitting postures (asana)
described in commentaries to the Yoga
Sutras. In this position the legs are
crossed with the feet tucked under the
thighs so that the crossed heels form a
cavity around the scrotum. This is called
the “decent posture” because the
cupped hands are placed over the cavity
made by the heels, covering the private
parts. In Hindu iconography this is one
of the common postures in which
images of the deities are portrayed.
Bhagabhadra
Monarch in the Sunga dynasty, which
was centered in the Malwa region in the
western part of the state of Madhya
Pradesh, in the centuries following the
decline of the Maurya dynasty just
before the turn of the common era.
Despite the fragmentation of the
Maurya state, rulers seem to have main-
tained contact with the Greek-speaking
kingdoms to the west, since a pillar
inscription records that Bhagabhadra
received an ambassador named
Heliodorus from the king of Takshasila,
in modern Pakistan.
Bhagavad Gita
One of the best-known Hindu scrip-
tures, which is itself a section in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. The parts of the epic before
the Bhagavad Gita chronicle the growing
strife between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the two branches of a royal
family who are the epic’s main charac-
ters. The parts following the Bhagavad
Gita detail the battle that ultimately
destroys the entire family. The Bhagavad
Gita itself is set in that moment of calm
just before the battle begins, and it is
written as a dialogue between the
Pandava prince Arjuna and the
supreme divinity Krishna, here dis-
guised as Arjuna’s charioteer. Arjuna is
the world’s greatest archer and can dec-
imate his enemies with ease. But as he
looks at the faces of the enemy, he real-
izes that the people he is about to fight
and kill are his relatives, teachers, and
friends. Not surprisingly, the prospect
leaves him cold, and it is up to Krishna
to give him divine guidance.
The Gita’s second chapter opens with
Krishna trying to shame Arjuna into
fighting (in essence, saying “everyone
will think you were afraid and make fun
of you”), but when this tactic fails,
Krishna has to give more substantive
advice, which makes up the rest of the
text. Different parts of the Bhagavad
Gita invoke all three of the generally
accepted paths to liberation of the
soul (moksha): the path of wisdom
(jnanamarga), the path of action
(karmamarga), and the path of
devotion (bhaktimarga).
The path of wisdom is rooted in the
teachings of the speculative texts known
as the Upanishads. This path stresses
the realization of one’s essential nature
as the eternal Self (atman). The atman is
identical with the universal reality
known as Brahman; once one has
accepted this, all dualistic ideas and
false knowledge disappear. The path of
action stresses acting without selfish
desire—performing one’s duty as duty,
but without attachment to the ultimate
outcome. This path thus upholds and
reinforces the rigid social structure pro-
pounded in the dharma literature. As a
warrior in that social system, Arjuna’s
[[93]]
Bhagavan
job is to kill people. At the same time,
the path of action provides a way to
transform socially sanctioned duty into
religious practice. The path of devotion
entails surrendering all one’s actions to
God and performing one’s role as an
instrument of divine will.
The Bhagavad Gita shows no clear
preference for any of these paths, which
implies that different writers reworked
the text over time. Professor Arthur
Llewellyn Basham has speculated that
the “original” Bhagavad Gita ended with
verse 2.38, after a section establishing
the morality of fighting in a just war,
thus giving Arjuna his rationale to fight.
It is believed that this “original” text was
then reworked by a philosopher of
the upanishadic type, who conceived
of the Ultimate Reality as the imper-
sonal Brahman and of liberation in
terms of mystical realization. The
final sections were most likely added
by a passionate devotee (bhakta) of
Vishnu, particularly in his form as
Krishna. According to Basham, this
last author not only inserted verses in
some of the earlier books but also
added some completely new ones.
One of these, Arjuna’s vision of
Krishna’s cosmic form in the Gita’s
eleventh chapter, is considered
among the most brilliant religious
texts ever written. Although some
scholars might take issue with
specific points, Professor Basham’s
theory seems the most convincing
explanation for a highly varied text.
In the roughly two thousand years
since the Bhagavad Gita was com-
piled, different commentators have
interpreted its message according to
their own proclivities. The ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya
saw it as sanctioning the path of wis-
dom, while the eleventh-century
philosopher Ramanuja was con-
vinced that it stressed devotion. The
most recent pivotal interpreter,
Mohandas Gandhi, understood the
text as commanding action. He saw in
Arjuna’s struggle a blueprint for his
own time and work, urging him to
[[94]]

labor for Indian independence but to
do so without attachment or hope for
personal gain. The text has become
even more important as a “scripture”
during the past two centuries, largely
because of pressure from Christian
missionaries. One sign of this is that
in modern Indian courtrooms, the
Gita is the text upon which Hindus
take the oath of truthfulness when
being called to take the stand. For an
accessible translation of the text
itself, see Barbara Stoller Miller
(trans.), The Bhagavad-Gita, 1991; for
Dr. Basham’s analysis of the text, see
Arthur Llewellyn Basham, The Origins
and
Development
of
Classical
Hinduism, 1991.
Bhagavan
(“Blessed One”) Name denoting both
respect and reverence. In different con-
texts this name can be used as an epi-
thet of either the god Krishna (as in the
Bhagavad Gita) or the god Shiva. In
modern usage, at least in northern
India, it is also the word that comes clos-
est to expressing the notion of abstract
divinity, much like the word “God” in
English. It is often used to denote God
by Hindus who are religious but who do
not worship particular deities.
Bhagavata
(“devotees of the Blessed One”) General
name for the earliest devotees (bhakta)
of Vishnu, particularly the devotees of
Krishna-Gopala, a deified cowherd hero
who later became identified with
Vishnu. Until the development of
sectarian Vaishnavism in around
the eleventh century C.E., the word
bhagavata was a blanket term for all
Vaishnavas except the Pancharatrikas,
who were followers of the secret ritual
tradition known as Pancharatra.
Bhagavata Purana
Sectarian religious text that is by far the
most important text for the worship ofBhagirathi
the god Krishna as the single Supreme
Being. Internal evidence hints that it was
written in southern India in the ninth or
tenth century, making it much later than
many of the other puranas. The bulk of
the text focuses on Krishna’s early life in
the village of Brindavan—infancy, child-
hood, and adolescence—but gives little
attention to his later exploits as a king
and hero. This purana’s best-known sec-
tion is the tenth book, which describes
Krishna’s amorous exploits with the local
herd girls (gopis) as they pass the nights
in a circle dance (ras lila) on the shores of
the Yamuna River. The image of Krishna
throughout the text is that of a god in
constant play with the world. For
Krishna’s devotees (bhakta), the supreme
felicity comes with the opportunity to
take part in that divine play (lila).
Bhagirath
In Hindu mythology, the single person
most responsible for bringing the celes-
tial Ganges down to earth. The river
Ganges and the goddess Ganges are the
same, hence the river is considered holy.
Bhagirath is the great-great-grandson of
King Sagar, whose 60,000 sons have
been burned to ash by the sage Kapila’s
magic power when they erroneously
accuse Kapila of being a thief. The sage
later tells Anshuman, King Sagar’s
grandson and sole surviving descen-
dant, that the only way to bring peace to
their souls is to bring the Ganges from
heaven down to earth. Anshuman
strives to do this for the rest of his life, as
does his son Dilip after him, but both
are unsuccessful. Dilip’s son Bhagirath
takes their efforts to heart and retires to
the Himalayas, where he performs
asceticism until the gods finally agree to
send the Ganges down to earth. Yet
Bhagirath’s efforts are not over. He next
has to appease the god Shiva so that the
deity will agree to take the shock of the
falling river on his head, since its force
will otherwise destroy the earth. When
all is finally in place, the Ganges falls to
earth onto the head of Shiva. From there
Bhagirath leads the river out of the
As a tributary of the Ganges, the waters of the
Bhagirathi River are considered sacred and its
banks contain several pilgrimage sites.
mountains to the sea, where she touches
his ancestors’ ashes, after which they
find peace at last.
Bhagirathi
Epithet for the Ganges as both river and
goddess. The word Bhagirathi is derived
from the name Bhagirath, the single
person most responsible for bringing
the Ganges to earth. Bhagirathi is also
the name for a Himalayan tributary of
the river; the Ganges itself is formed
when the Bhagirathi unites with the
Alakananda River at Devaprayag.
Although the Alakananda is longer and
wider, the Bhagirathi flows through
Gangotri, the sacred site (tirtha) cele-
brated as the source of the Ganges. As
with all the Himalayan tributaries of the
Ganges, the Bhagirathi is considered
[[95]]
Bhairava
sacred. Important pilgrimage places
along this tributary include Gangotri
near its headwaters, Uttarkashi, and
Devaprayag.
Bhairava
(“terrible”) A wrathful and powerful
divine attendant of the god Shiva who is
often identified as a form of Shiva him-
self. According to the Shiva Purana, a
sectarian scripture, Bhairava is produced
when the god Brahma insults Shiva, and
Shiva’s rage takes concrete form as
Bhairava. After his birth, Bhairava’s first
act is to cut off one of Brahma’s heads—
the one whose mouth has uttered the
insult—thus leaving the god with four
remaining heads. Since Brahma is con-
sidered a brahmin priest, this act makes
Bhairava guilty of brahmin murder, the
most serious of the four great crimes
(mahapataka). As a sign of the enormity
of his act, Brahma’s severed head sticks
to Bhairava’s hand; as penance
(prayashchitta) Bhairava has to wander
the countryside as a beggar, displaying
Brahma’s severed head as a continual
advertisement of his crime. In his travels
Bhairava visits many pilgrimage places
(tirtha), but none of them have the
power to cleanse him from the sin of
brahmin murder. He finally obtains a
pardon in the city of Benares, at a site
named Kapalamochana (“releasing the
skull”). As soon as Bhairava bathes there,
Brahma’s head falls from his hand into
the Ganges—a sign that his crime had
been expiated.
Although often seen as Shiva’s atten-
dant, Bhairava is important in several
different contexts. He is often portrayed
as the consort of powerful, independent
goddesses such as Durga and Kali,
although he is subordinate to them,
befitting their status as supreme deities.
Bhairava’s associations with wrath and
power have made him popular with
practitioners of the secret ritual tradition
known as tantra, who may invoke him
for magic powers or other favors.
Bhairava is also popular with the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetic
[[96]]

devotees (bhakta) of Shiva who formerly
made their living as traders and merce-
nary soldiers; this group sees him as a
divine image of themselves. Some of the
ambivalence associated with Bhairava is
symbolized by his animal vehicle, the
dog, which in Hindu culture is almost
invariably a scavenger and considered
highly impure.
Bhairava Akhara
Another name for the Juna akhara, a
particular subgroup of the Naga class
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. See
Juna akhara.
Bhairava Jayanti
Annual festival on the eighth day of
the dark, or waning, half of the
lunar
month
of
Margashirsha
(November–December), which is cele-
brated as the birthday of Bhairava.
Bhairava is a wrathful and powerful form
of the god Shiva and is actually the god’s
anger personified. He emerges from
Shiva’s forehead after Shiva has been
insulted by the god Brahma, and
Bhairava’s first act is to cut off the head of
Brahma that has uttered the insult, leav-
ing the god with four heads. Bhairava’s
wrath gives him an aura of danger but
also the power to help his devotees
(bhakta), who worship him to attain
success, remove obstacles, and recover
from disease. On this festival people
worship Bhairava, Shiva, and Shiva’s
wife, Parvati, as well as Bhairava’s ani-
mal vehicle, the dog. People are encour-
aged to worship through the night and to
pass this time by telling mythic stories of
Bhairava, Shiva, and Parvati.
Bhairavaprakasha
(“brilliance of Bhairava”) Name given to
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of
the Mahanirvani akhara, a particular
group of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and are organized into differentBhakta
akharas, or regiments, much like an
army. Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas’ primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial
trading interests; both of these have
occupations largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have particular features, including this
spear, which signify their organiza-
tional identity.
Bhairavi
Feminine form of Bhairava and an
epithet of the Goddess. Bhairavi is one
of the ten Mahavidyas, a group of
goddesses who are both extremely
powerful and potentially dangerous.
Bhaiya Duj
Annual festival falling on the second
day (duj) of the bright, or waxing, half
of the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). This festival is cel-
ebrated to emphasize the bond between
a brother (bhaiya) and sister. During
Bhaiya Duj, married women invite their
brothers into their homes, apply tika
marks on their brothers’ foreheads as a
sign of respect, and feed them sweets
and a hearty meal. Sisters also tie a string
around their brothers’ right wrists to
symbolize the emotional bond between
them and the brother’s obligation to pro-
tect his sister throughout her lifetime.
Unmarried women host their brothers in
the same way in their natal homes. In
either case, on this day women should
pray that their brothers have long lives
and that they themselves be happily
married. The brothers, in turn, give pre-
sents to their sisters.
Aside from reaffirming the normal
family love between brother and sister,
this festival also emphasizes the protec-
tive role that brothers play in their sis-
ters’ lives, particularly after women are
married. The traditional pattern in
northern India is for married women to
live with their husbands’ families. Since
women generally outlive their fathers,
for most of her life a woman’s primary
protectors will be her brothers. A woman
without brothers is in a position of
relative weakness. If nothing else, these
yearly visits give brothers the chance to
assess their sister’s happiness and the
state of affairs in her married home.
Such visits also notify the husband’s
family that they are still concerned with
her welfare.
Bhajan
(“sharing”) General name for a religious
or devotional hymn, which is almost
always sung in a vernacular language. As
an expression of personal devotion, bha-
jans have no prescribed forms and in
contemporary times are often set to the
melodies of film songs. As a genre, bha-
jans can have any or all of the following
themes: detailing the deeds of a particu-
lar deity, praising the deity, addressing
the god in a tone of complaint or humble
supplication (vinaya), reminding the
deity of the speaker’s difficulties from
internal or external sources, or warning
the listeners to examine and reform their
lives. Singing and listening to such
hymns was, and remains, a major form
of religious activity in the bhakti (devo-
tional) movement. During these
sessions, devotees (bhakta) “share”
their songs and experiences with one
another. Although one can find bhajans
dedicated to all the gods in the
pantheon, from a historical perspective
this singing tradition has been strongest
among the devotees of Vishnu.
Vaishnava devotional literature is full
of tales of Vishnu coming in disguise to
take part in bhajan sessions, since the
company of his devotees is said to be
heaven on earth.
Bhakta
(“sharer”) In Hinduism, this word
denotes a devotee of any particular
deity. The word’s literal meaning,
“sharer,” has a twofold sense. On one
hand, the devotee shares in the deity’s
grace by virtue of his or her piety. On the

it was completed early in the seven-
teenth century.
Bhaktavijaya
A family makes an offering in a burning tray.
Offerings are a sign of religious
devotion (bhakti) to a deity.
other hand, since most Hindu devotion-
alism involves a community of
worshipers, the devotee also gets to
share in the company and community of
like-minded people.
(“Triumph of [God’s] Devotees”) Text
written by Mahipati, an eighteenth-cen-
tury writer and hagiographer of the
devotional (bhakti) poet-saints. The sto-
ries in the Bhaktavijaya focus mainly
on the saints connected with the
Varkari Panth, a religious group
centered around the worship of the god
Vithoba at his temple at Pandharpur.
This focus is understandable since
Mahipati himself was a Varkari. In
keeping with the trend toward unifica-
tion often promoted by the devotional
movement, he also included tales of
other great devotees (bhakta), most
notably Kabir, Namdev, Jnaneshvar,
and Narsi Mehta. The stories in the
Bhaktavijaya present each of these
saints as a paradigm of devotion and
stress the power of piety to overcome all
obstacles. This theme also marks
Mahipati’s other major work, the
Bhaktililamrta. The Bhaktavijaya has
been translated by Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole as Stories of Indian
Saints, 1988.
Bhaktamal
(“Garland of Devotees”) Text written by
Nabhadas (ca. 1600) in which he gives
short (six-line) biographical accounts of
over two hundred bhakti (devotional)
figures. Although Nabhadas himself was
a Ramanandi, and thus a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama, his work not
only includes devotees of all sectarian
persuasions but is generally considered
unbiased. The text is notably free of
astonishing and miraculous events.
Instead, the main emphasis is on the
devotee’s personal qualities, which serve
as a model for others. In many cases the
Bhaktamal gives the earliest reliable
account of these figures, which makes it
an extremely important source for
northern Indian literary and religious
history. It is all the more interesting that
the text cannot be definitively dated,
[[98]]

Bhakti
(“sharing”) The most common word
denoting devotion to God. This is one of
the three traditional paths to gain final
liberation of the soul (moksha), and it
has been the most widespread type of
religious practice for well over a thou-
sand years. The word’s literal meaning
conveys the sense of relationship. On
one hand, it refers to an intense and pas-
sionate love between devotee (bhakta)
and deity, and on the other, it refers to
separate communities of people bound
together by their common love of God.
Although references to bhakti can be
found in such early texts as the
Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the
Bhagavad Gita, the bhakti propounded
here is radically different from laterBhaktililamrta
usages. In both these texts, bhakti is pre-
sented as a form of yoga in which one
contemplates God as part of a con-
trolled and disciplined practice. This is a
far cry from the abandonment and pas-
sionate involvement in later times.
The beginnings of this latter sort of
bhakti arose in the Tamil country of
deep southern India between the sixth
and ninth centuries B.C.E. It had an
intensity that was radically different
from earlier notions, a devotional “heat”
as opposed to the “coolness” of yoga.
Tamil bhakti expressed, and continues
to express, its devotion through songs
sung in vernacular languages, convey-
ing an intimate relationship with a per-
sonal god.
These characteristics basically held
throughout history. The use of vernacu-
lar speech was especially significant,
for this was the language of ordinary
life and marked the egalitarianism that
was one of the hallmarks of bhakti
devotion. Bhakti devotees were men and
women from all strata of society, from
the highest to the lowest; here was an
opportunity for religious life based
solely on the depth and sincerity of one’s
devotion rather than on one’s birth.
Despite this religious egalitarianism,
devotees rarely tried to restructure
their hierarchical societies. The idea was
that religious equality was supposed
to transcend rather than reform
human society.
Aside from egalitarianism and per-
sonal experience, bhakti worship also
stressed community, based on the inter-
connections between devotees. Though
each devotee was an individual (and
indeed, bhakti poets had real personali-
ties, as the many hagiographies bear
witness), they also fell into “families,” all
of which were connected with each
other. Many of the bhakti saints fell into
recognizable groups: Some were cen-
tered around a particular sacred place,
such as the temple at Pandharpur in the
state of Maharashtra; some were con-
nected as teachers and students, such as
Nammalvar
and
his
disciple
Nathamuni; and some had long-term
associations, as with the Lingayat com-
munity. In all cases these devotees were
keenly aware of those who had preceded
them and their connections with one
another. Such communities were both
formed and reinforced through satsang,
the “company of good people” whose
influence over time was believed to have
the power to transform. This was a type
of “sharing” that bound devotees to
each other and to their teacher, and
through these two vehicles carried them
to God.
These are general characteristics,
and bhakti’s regional manifestations
often take on a distinct flavor marked by,
if nothing else, the differing languages.
The Padma Purana speaks of bhakti
(a feminine noun) as a maiden who
was born in southern India, attained
maturity in the state of Maharashtra,
and was rejuvenated in northern
India. Although this is a metaphor, it
accurately charts the historical diffusion
of bhakti devotion, as well as its changes
as it moved north. All forms of
bhakti are shaped by specific times,
places, and circumstances.
Bhaktililamrta
(“Nectar of the Play of Devotion”) Text
written by Mahipati, an eighteenth-
century writer and hagiographer of the
devotional
(bhakti)
poet-saints.
Mahipati belonged to the Varkari
Panth, a religious group centered
around the worship of the god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur. The
Bhaktililamrta gives extended accounts
of Varkari saints, such as Eknath,
Tukaram, Ramdas, and Bhanudas. The
text presents each of these saints as a
paradigm of devotion and stresses the
power of worship to overcome all obsta-
cles. This theme also marks his other
major work, the Bhaktavijaya. Parts of
the Bhaktililamrta have been translated
by Justin E. Abbott as The Life of Eknath,
[[1981]]
; and The Life of Tukaram, 1980.
[[99]]
Bhaktimarga
Bhaktimarga
(“path of devotion”) Along with the path
of action (karmamarga) and the path of
wisdom (jnanamarga), this is one of
Hinduism’s three generally accepted
ways to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The bhaktimarga seeks
release of the soul through bhakti, or
passionate devotion to God.
Bhaktirasabodhini
(“Awakening the Delight in Devotion”)
Name of a commentary on the
Bhaktamal of Nabhadas; this commen-
tary was written by Priyadas in 1712. In
the Bhaktamal, Nabhadas had given
brief six-line biographies of over two
hundred contemporary bhakti (devo-
tional) figures. These biographies are
notably free of astonishing and miracu-
lous events and usually stress the devo-
tee’s personal qualities, to serve as a
model
for
others.
In
the
Bhaktirasabodhini, Priyadas gave great-
ly expanded accounts for each devotee
mentioned by Nabhadas, often narrat-
ing amazing stories to which Nabhadas
made no reference. In his biography of
the poet-saint Ravidas, Nabhadas drew
from the texts written by the biographer
Anantadas, but in other cases his
sources are not clear. The accounts in
the Bhaktirasabodhini are suspect as
genuine biographies of these saints,
given Priyadas’s penchant for miracu-
lous events and his chronological dis-
tance from his subjects. Still, the text is
extremely valuable as a mirror of his
time, and careful analysis can reveal
much about contemporary religious
tensions and issues.
Bhamati Advaita
A later branch of the Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school. The Advaita
school upholds a position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things
and that everything is merely a differing
form of that reality. Advaita proponents
believe that reality is nondual (advaita),
[[100]]

that is, that all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman despite
the appearance of diversity. For the
Advaitins, this assumption of diversity is
a fundamental misunderstanding of the
ultimate nature of things, or avidya.
Although often translated as “igno-
rance,” avidya is better understood as
a lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage,
reincarnation (samsara), and suffering.
Bhamati Advaita is based on the
ideas of Mandana Mishra, although the
school takes its name from a commen-
tary written by Mandana’s disciple
Vachaspati Mishra. Mandana was a
contemporary of the philosopher
Shankaracharya, Advaita Vedanta’s
greatest exponent, and took definitive
stands on several philosophical points
on which Shankaracharya had remained
silent. One such point was the location
of avidya, which Mandana claimed must
be each individual Self because it was
absurd to conceive of Brahman as sub-
ject to ignorance. For Mandana there
were clearly multiple, separate selves,
since one person’s liberation did not
bring liberation for all.
Mandana’s comments presupposed
the existence of a common, if illusory,
world, which his followers explained as
the activity of one primal ignorance;
however, they also had to explain how a
single primal ignorance could simulta-
neously affect multiple souls. This was
done using philosophical models known
as limitationism and reflectionism,
although it is the former that has been
more commonly associated with the
Bhamati school. Limitationism assumes
that there are some things (i.e., the color
red) that we do not conceive of as
divided, even when different red colors
appear in different places. In the same
way, the Bhamati school argued, avidya
can be found in multiple souls at
the same time but is complete and
undivided
in
each
of
them.
Reflectionism is based on the idea of a
mirror’s image, which is different from
the original but made from it. ThereforeBhang
the avidya found in any particular soul is
a “reflection” of the original avidya. For
further information see Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Bhandara
(“storehouse”) A banquet given for large
numbers of people—either by special
invitation, restricted to certain classes of
people (such as ascetics), or open to the
general public. Sponsoring such a ban-
quet is believed to generate consider-
able religious merit, but this is also a
conspicuous opportunity for both the
donor and attendees to enhance their
status. Issues of status are also marked
among the attendees. The most honored
guests confer status on the donor simply
by deigning to come, and accordingly
such guests will be treated differently
from the common lot. The rest of the
guests generally get no such special
treatment. They give status to the host
by eating the food he (or she) has had
prepared, but they get little in return
other than the meal itself, which is usu-
ally of poor quality since the food is pre-
pared in large quantities.
Based on these considerations,
ascetics with sufficient resources of their
own will usually avoid such banquets
because of both the quality of the food
and the concerns over status. To eat at a
bhandara is not only to confer prestige
on the donor, but to lower one’s own
status by appearing as though one
needs to do this to survive. The main
exception is when one has been invited
as an honored guest, but even in these
cases it is not unusual for such guests to
eat little or nothing, thereby giving
status by their presence but losing none
through consumption.
Bhandarkar, R. G.
(1837–1925) Sanskrit scholar and intel-
lectual who was the first Indian to serve
as professor of Sanskrit at Deccan
College, in Poona. Bhandarkar was one
of the first Indian academics to combine
the traditional mastery of Sanskrit texts
with critical and objective research, a
project that until then had been con-
fined to European scholars. Bhandarkar
is emblematic of Indian intellectuals in
the late nineteenth century, who began
by learning from the Europeans but
were then able to work with the best of
them. Bhandarkar authored two
Sanskrit workbooks and numerous
scholarly texts, but his most significant
legacy is the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute; it was founded in
[[1917]]
 by his students, friends, and admir-
ers and is still a highly respected
research institution.
Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute
(BORI) Research institute founded in
[[1917]]
 and named after the great scholar
R. G. Bhandarkar (1837–1925). The
Institute is devoted to the study and
preservation of traditional Indian cul-
ture, and it is respected in scholarly cir-
cles throughout the world. Its two most
important publications have been P. V.
Kane’s History of Dharmasastra and a
multivolume critical edition of the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. Aside from its publications,
the Institute is also noted for its vast col-
lection of Sanskrit manuscripts, which
makes it one of the finest research
establishments in all of India.
Bhang
Paste or dough made from crushed mar-
ijuana (Cannabis sativa), which is often
mixed with spices or other flavorings
before being formed into a ball. It is
taken as an intoxicant, either eaten, or
mixed into a “cooling” milk-based drink
called thandai. In general, eating bhang
is disapproved of by respectable people,
although it is fairly common in certain
circles, particularly among ascetics.
Despite this basic disapproval, bhang is
widely consumed as part of the festival
celebrations for Shivaratri and Holi,
even by people who avoid it the rest of
[[101]]
Bhanita
the year. The former festival is dedicated
to Shiva, who is famous for his love of
the drug, whereas Holi is associated
with overturning social boundaries, giv-
ing greater license to do things normally
proscribed. Aside from being consumed
during certain celebrations, it can also
be taken in special places, particularly
when on a pilgrimage. Several of the
most famous Hindu sacred sites
(tirthas)—among them Benares, Puri,
and Haridwar—have government-run
bhang stands where pilgrims can fulfill
their needs.
Bhanita
In poetry, particularly the vernacular
form of the bhakti poets, a signature
line in which the author is identified by
name. This line has two major functions:
to identify the poet and to provide a
summation of the poem’s message. The
word bhanita comes from a verb mean-
ing “to speak,” and by adding a signature
line the poet is stamping his or her
authorship on the poem. Of course,
there is nothing to prevent others from
doing this as well. In a performance con-
text, the poet’s name comes at the
beginning of the final line and alerts the
audience to pay special attention to that
line, which often sums up the entire
poem’s message.
Bharadvaja
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Bharadvaja is an
important ascetic and sage. His ashram,
or abode, is at Chitrakut; this is now a
town in the southeastern area of the
state of Uttar Pradesh, but the epic
describes the place as a forest her-
mitage. When Rama, his wife Sita, and
his brother Lakshmana are beginning
their fourteen years of exile, they come
to Bharadvaja to seek his blessings
(ashirvad). In a broader mythological
context, Bharadvaja is one of the seven
sages whose names mark exogamous
gotra (“lineages”); the others are
Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Vasishtha, Gautama,
[[102]]

Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brahmins are
believed to be descended from these
seven sages, with each family taking the
name of its progenitor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra divisions
are still important, since marriage with-
in the lineage is forbidden. After her
marriage the bride adopts her husband’s
gotra as part of her new identity. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Bharadvaja
(2) (5th c. B.C.E.?) Religious scholar
named as the author of a Shrauta Sutra
(manual on prescriptions for Vedic ritu-
als) and a Grhya Sutra (manual on
domestic rites). The period during
which he flourished is uncertain but
must precede Panini, since this gram-
marian mentions Bharadvaja in the
Ashtadhyayi. Given their interest in
strengthening the authority of their
sacred texts, many Hindus identify this
author with the legendary sage
Bharadvaja, although there is no hard
evidence for this claim.
Bharata
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Dushyanta and the maiden Shakuntala;
Bharata is considered a partial incarna-
tion of the god Vishnu. Dushyanta and
Shakuntala are married in secret in a
gandharva marriage executed by their
mutual consent. Dushyanta must return
to his capital and leaves Shakuntala at
her home. While he is gone, she is cursed
by the sage Durvasas that her lover will
forget her. In time, Bharata is born and
Shakuntala goes off to search for her
beloved. She has to endure many trials
before the curse is broken. Since
Shakuntala and Dushyanta have been
married in secret, it takes some time
before Bharata is accepted as
Dushyanta’s legitimate son, and thus heir
to the throne. When Bharata finally
ascends the throne, he reigns for a long
time. After his reign the land of India
becomes traditionally known as Bharata.Bharatanatyam
Bharata
(2) In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Bharata is the
son of King Dasharatha by his wife
Kaikeyi and the righteous younger
brother of the god Rama, the epic’s pro-
tagonist. Bharata’s loyalty to his family
has to endure several tests. The strictest
one comes early in the epic when,
through Kaikeyi’s treachery, Rama is
sent into exile in the forest for fourteen
years, and Bharata is named king in his
place. Despite the obvious temptations
of wealth and power, Bharata refuses to
assume the throne in place of his
brother, curses his mother for her
deceit, and sets off to live in exile with
Rama. Rama commands Bharata to
return to Ayodhya and rule during
his exile, on the premise that the people
will suffer without a king. Bharata
reluctantly agrees to act as a temporary
king, but with two symbolic adjust-
ments: He moves the court from the
capital city of Ayodhya to the village
of Nandigrama as a symbol of Rama’s
exile, and throughout his rule sits at
the foot of the royal throne; a pair of
Rama’s sandals are placed upon the
throne as a symbol of the rightful king.
Many characters in the Ramayana
are paradigms for Indian cultural values,
and Bharata stands for the ideal younger
brother. In the traditional joint house-
hold the brothers are the heart of the
family, since it is they who remain at
home their entire lives, whereas their
sisters live with their husbands’ families
after they are married. The eldest brother
in every generation eventually becomes
the head of the joint family after the
older members have passed away. He
carries primary authority and responsi-
bility for the family as a whole but can-
not succeed without the cooperation of
his younger brothers, who must
acknowledge and support his authority.
By refusing to usurp his elder brother’s
rightful leadership, Bharata is a para-
digm for the ideal younger brother, who
puts aside his own desires and opportu-
nities to uphold and promote the wel-
fare of the family as a whole.
A dancer performs in the classical
Bharatanatyam form. She assumes the pose of
Nataraja, the “Lord of the Dance.”
Bharatanatyam
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Kathak,
Orissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Chau,
and Manipuri. Bharatanatyam has its
home in the temple towns of the state of
Tamil Nadu, particularly Tanjore city’s
Brhadeshvar temple. This temple is
dedicated to the god Shiva, whose most
famous form is Nataraja, the “Lord of
the Dance.” According to tradition the
name bharata comes not from the sage
Bharata, the reputed author of the text
on dance called the Natyashastra , but
from an acronym of the dance’s three
most important elements: “bha” from
bhava (“feeling”), “ra” from raga
(“melodic mood”), and “ta” from tala
(“rhythm”). The second word in the
name, natyam, simply means “dance.”
Bharatanatyam’s historical roots are
uncertain. The existence of dance can
be dated to the early centuries C.E. since
[[103]]
Bharati Dashanami
it is mentioned in the two Tamil epic
poems,
Shilappadigaram
and
Manimegalai. Carvings at the Shiva
temple in Kanchipuram suggest that
this dance was well developed in the
Pallava dynasty (6th–9th c. C.E.), but
hard evidence for structured temple
dance, including the hereditary dancers
known as devadasis, did not appear
until the Chola dynasty (9th–14th c. C.E.).
Although royal patronage was an impor-
tant
factor
in
its
survival,
Bharatanatyam was performed primari-
ly in the temples until the twentieth cen-
tury, when the dance began to be
performed on stage.
As an artistic form, the dance’s pre-
sent technique was codified in the early
nineteenth century by four brothers in
the service of Raja Serfoji II of Tanjore.
Stylistically, Bharatanatyam presents a
sharply geometric line. The most char-
acteristic posture has a stiff upper torso,
with the knees flexed outward in line
with the rest of the body, and the feet
spread gently outward. This posture is a
recurring motif in any performance. As
in all the Indian dances, Bharatanatyam
has a well-developed vocabulary of ges-
ture and expression, which makes it
possible for the dancer to tell complex
stories. Like most other Indian dance
forms, Bharatanatyam has been influ-
enced by the shift from temple to
stage as its primary theater. Although its
roots lie in worship and devotion, the
move to the stage has inevitably disrupt-
ed some of these religious connections.

Dance, 1984.
Bharati Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century
philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
[[104]]

different name—in this case, bharati
(“Indian”). Upon initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten divisions are divided into four
larger organizational groups. Each
group has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya, as
well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Bharati Dashanamis belong
to the Bhuriwara group, which is affili-
ated with the Shringeri Math in the
southern Indian town of Shringeri. The
Bharati division is elite because it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins. Other such divisions are the
Saraswati
Dashanamis,
Tirtha
Dashanamis, and Ashrama Dashanamis.
The Bharatis are unusual, however,
since only part of the division is
restricted to brahmins.
Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) Modern Indian political party with
a strong Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)
orientation. The party was formed as the
political wing of the Hindu nationalist
organization known as Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and many of
the BJP’s leaders have been RSS members
for decades. The BJP was formed in 1980
after the dissolution of its predecessor
organization, the Jana Sangh. The latter
was an RSS affiliate as well, several of the
whose leaders, notably Lal Krishna
Advani and Atal Behari Vajpayee, have
also led the BJP. At first the BJP took a
moderate political stance and fared
quite poorly, winning only two seats in
the 1984 elections. In the later 1980s it
took a far more militant tone, stressing
as its focal issue the campaign to build
the Ram Janam Bhumi temple in
Ayodhya. As the Indian electorate grew
more religiously polarized, the BJP
climbed to eighty-six seats in 1989 and
[[120]]
 seats in 1991. In the 1996 elections it
won 160 seats, becoming the largest sin-
gle party in India’s 535-seat Parliament.Bharatmilap
The president of India invited the BJP to
form a government, but this failed when
it was unable to gain enough support
from other parties to muster a majority
of votes in Parliament.
The BJP’s traditional constituency has
been brahmins and members of the
trading communities, both of whom
tend to be religiously conservative and
supportive of the Hindutva message. In
the mid-1990s the BJP muted its Hindu
nationalist rhetoric in an attempt to
reach beyond these traditional con-
stituencies and to gain more widespread
support by moving closer to the political
center. Despite these changes, many of
the established secular parties still view
the BJP with suspicion and have refused
to ally themselves with the organization.
The BJP’s inability to mobilize such sup-
port among the larger body politic was a
major factor behind the collapse of its
short-lived government in 1996. The
country was then run by a coalition of
thirteen secular political parties, whose
single binding commitment is their
opposition to the BJP. However, since
[[1998]]
 the BJP has succeeded in building
coalitions to form a government. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; and
Christophe Jaffrelot, The Hindu
Nationalist Movement in India, 1996.
Bharat Mata
(“Mother India”) Modern Hindu “deity”
whose primary image is a map of the
subcontinent,
often
prominently
marked with the network of India’s
sacred sites (tirthas). The presupposi-
tion behind most of these particular
sacred sites is that the land itself is holy,
but the idea of Bharat Mata takes this
idea to a more abstract level, sanctifying
the whole subcontinent. Although this
map and its image of Mother India are
usually not actual objects of worship,
they carry important symbolic mes-
sages. In an abstract way, the holiness of
Mother India unites all Hindus regard-
less of their sectarian affiliation.
Moreover, it suggests that India is one
unified culture despite its striking
regional diversity. These ideas can be
found in specific areas, particularly in
the networks of tirthas knitting the
country together, yet in contemporary
times this image’s underlying purpose is
often political rather than religious.
At times it simply represents
national pride, but at other times it has
a more sinister hidden agenda. This
identification of Indian culture with the
motherland can be used as a way to
marginalize religious minorities—pri-
marily Muslims and Christians, whose
holy places lie in other countries—as
“foreigners,” and people whose patrio-
tism and connection to the Indian
nation are potentially suspect.
Bharatmilap
(“Meeting Bharata”) A particular scene
in the dramas known as the Ram Lila,
which are reenactments of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. This scene records the
meeting between the god Rama and his
brother Bharata, which takes place after
Rama has been in exile for fourteen
years, during which Bharata has faith-
fully served as ruler in his brother’s
place. According to connoisseurs of the
Ram Lila, this brief scene is filled with
some of the most rapturous emotion in
the play. Certainly there is the exaltation
that the time of separation has ended,
but the scene’s popularity also comes
from the way it reflects certain basic cul-
tural values. The brothers are consid-
ered the heart of the traditional Indian
joint family since they remain at home
their entire lives, whereas their sisters
become part of their marital families.
The eldest brother in every generation
eventually becomes the head of the joint
household, but he cannot succeed with-
out the support and cooperation of his
younger brothers. Rama and Bharata are
thus models for the brothers in a tradi-
tional joint family: Rama for treating his
younger brother with love and care, and
Bharata for obediently carrying out his

a religious community devoted to Vithoba.
older brother’s wishes for the good of the
family as a whole.
(“Three Hundred”), a three-part collec-
tion of poems on political life, love, and
renunciation. According to legend,
Bhartrhari was born the son of the brah-
min Vidyasagara and his shudra wife,
Mandakini. Vidyasagara was the adviser
to the king of Kalinga and was given the
kingdom upon the ruler’s death; after
Vidyasagara’s death Bhartrhari’s brothers
designated him as king. Bhartrhari was
very happy until he realized that his wife
was being unfaithful to him. When her
secret was discovered she tried to poi-
son him. Completely disillusioned,
Bhartrhari renounced the world to live
as an ascetic, during which time he
reputedly composed his poetry.
Although this is a good story, since
many of these poems stress the degra-
dation inherent in courtly life,
Bhartrhari was most likely a courtier. His
poetry treats all of the conventional pur-
poses of life. The first two sections are
about power (artha), sensual desire
(kama), and righteous action (dharma),
whereas the final section is concerned
with the ultimate end, or liberation of
the soul (moksha). For further informa-
tion see Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.),
The Hermit and the Love-Thief, 1978.
Bharavi
(6th c. C.E.) Sanskrit dramatist who is
best known as the author of the drama
Kiratarjuniya. This play describes the
meeting between the god Shiva, dis-
guised as the tribal hunter Kirata, and
the warrior-hero Arjuna. Arjuna is one
of the five Pandava brothers, who are
the heroes of the epic Mahabharata. In
Hindu mythology, Arjuna is the world’s
greatest warrior, but he is also afflicted
with pride. The play describes how the
arrogant Arjuna becomes humbled at
the hands of this tribal hunter, who in
contemporary terms would be of very
low social status. In the end, however,
Shiva reveals his true form to Arjuna and
blesses him for his valor.
Bhartrhari
(5th c. C.E.) Sanskrit poet-philosopher
who authored the Shatakatrayam
[[106]]

Bhartrprapancha
(7th c. C.E.) In Indian philosophy, the
first exponent of the Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) philosophical
school. The period during which
Bhartrprapancha flourished is uncer-
tain, but he precedes the eighth-century
Bhedabhada commentator Bhaskara.
The Bhedabhada position identified
three levels of being: the Ultimate
Reality known as Brahman, the “wit-
ness” consciousness (sakshin) in the
human being, and the world. This
school paradoxically asserted that these
three levels were identical, yet different.
Thus the world is identical to Brahman
but subject to change and decay, unlike
Brahman. In the same way, while each
human soul is identical to Brahman, it is
also subject to bondage and reincarna-
tion (samsara), unlike Brahman. TheBhaskara
bondage of the soul was caused by the
primal ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination of
action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosophi-
cal problem for Bhartrprapancha
and his followers came from their belief
that Brahman was actually transformed
into both the world and the Self, a
philosophical outlook known as parina-
mavada. Since they believed that
Brahman underwent real changes, it
was subject to bondage and ignorance.
This position was untenable and unac-
ceptable from a religious perspective
because Brahman was deemed to be
perfect and unchanging. This difficulty
may account for the school’s relatively
short life.The need for commentary was presup-
posed in most texts on Hindu philoso-
phy as well as in the secret ritual
tradition known as tantra. Philosophical
works were often nothing more than
collections of brief aphorisms, which
were intentionally kept short to
facilitate memorization but which
clearly needed further explanation. In
the case of tantra, commentary was
essential because the texts were written
using coded language to conceal their
contents from the uninitiated. This
may have been in the form known as
sandhabhasha, which often uses
erotic language to indicate religious
practice, or it may simply have been
a technical language in which
everyday words had contextual meanings.
BharudBhaskara
The name for a specific genre of bhakti
(devotional) poetry, found particularly
among the Varkari Panth, a religious
community centered around the wor-
ship of the Hindu god Vithoba at his
temple at Pandharpur, in the modern
state of Maharashtra. The bharud is
essentially a dramatic poem in which
the speaker takes on one or more roles
to convey the message of devotion to
God. It was especially favored by the
poet-saint Eknath, who used the genre
to adopt the personae of women,
untouchables, Muslims, and other mar-
ginal people. In modern times these
bharuds have become the basis for pop-
ular dramas, usually performed during
the biannual Varkari pilgrimage to
Pandharpur. While singing the songs of
the earlier saints during a pilgrimage is
an important religious act, these mod-
ern renditions are mainly for entertain-
ment. The actors playing the roles in
these bharuds frequently add in their
own words and actions, which are often
quite bawdy.In Indian philosophy, an eighth-cen-
tury proponent of the Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) school. The
Bhedabhada position identified three
levels of being: the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman, the “witness”
consciousness (sakshin) in the
human being, and the world. They
paradoxically asserted that these three
levels were identical, yet different.
Thus the world is identical to Brahman
but subject to change and decay,
unlike Brahman. In the same way,
while each human soul is identical
to Brahman, it is also subject to
bondage and reincarnation (samsara),
unlike Brahman. The bondage of the
soul was caused by the primal
ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination
of action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosoph-
ical problem for the Bhedabhada
school was that because they believed
that Brahman was actually trans-
formed into the world and the Self
(parinamavada), it followed that
Brahman was subject to bondage and
ignorance. This idea was difficult to
defend, since the transcendence of
Brahman was well established by
Bhashya
(“commentary”) Any commentary,
whether on a text or an oral teaching.
[[107]]
Bhasmasur
sacred texts such as the Upanishads,
and this problem may account for the
school’s relatively short life.
Bhasmasur
In Hindu mythology, a demon with great
power but limited intelligence.
According to tradition, the god Shiva
has given Bhasmasur the power to
change anyone to ash (bhasma) simply
by placing his hand on that person’s
head. Bhasmasur falls in love with
Shiva’s wife Parvati and attempts to
place his hand on Shiva’s head, and the
god has to flee. Bhasmasur is destroyed
when the god Vishnu tricks him into
putting his hand on top of his own head,
which instantly transforms him into ash.
In metaphorical usage, the term
Bhasmasur denotes any problem that
has grown out of hand through lack
of foresight.
Bhava
(“being”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
Bhavabhuti
(early 8th c. C.E.) Sanskrit dramatist and
playwright noted for his ability to
express and transmit emotions through
language. His best-known play, the
romance Malatimadhava , is famous
not only in its own right, but because the
primary villain is an evil ascetic believed
to be a member of the defunct ascetic
group known as Kapalikas. The
Kapalikas were devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva, and their reputed practices emu-
lated Shiva in his wrathful form as
Bhairava. They wore their hair long and
matted, smeared their bodies with ash
(preferably from the cremation
ground), and carried a club and a skull
bowl (kapala). According to some
sources, they also indulged in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs, per-
forming human sacrifice, and orgiastic
sexuality—which caused them to be
avoided and feared. Bhavabhuti’s
[[108]]

description of this evil ascetic and his
disciples is one of the earliest datable
references to the Shaiva form of asceti-
cism, and therefore important from a
historical perspective.
Bhavani
(feminine form of Bhava) Epithet of the
god Shiva’s wife, Parvati. See Parvati.
Bhavas
(“states”) In Indian aesthetics the
bhavas are a set of nine states consid-
ered the most basic unadulterated emo-
tions: sexual excitement, laughter, grief,
anger, energy, fear, loathing, wonder,
and peace. To these nine bhavas corre-
spond the nine rasas (“tastes”), or
moods transmitted by various types of
artistic expression: the erotic, comic,
compassionate, cruel, heroic, terrifying,
loathsome, marvelous, and peaceful.
Although these bhavas and rasas clearly
correspond to one another, there is an
important difference between them. A
person’s emotive states come and go in
response to circumstances that are often
beyond one’s control. Because such nat-
urally occurring emotions usually can-
not be sustained, they are generally not
objects of aesthetic satisfaction. This is
not true in the case of rasa, since mood
can be artificially generated by an artis-
tic endeavor. Any particular rasa can
thus be sustained and satisfying. The
single most dominant aim in all the
Indian arts, therefore, is to create such a
mood or moods for the audience.
Bhave, Vinobha
(1895–1982) Social and religious
reformer whose basic principles reflected
his long association with Mohandas K.
Gandhi, to whom Bhave came as a disci-
ple in 1916. Bhave was one of Gandhi’s
close associates in the struggle for inde-
pendence and was particularly
absorbed with Gandhi’s idea of village
self-sufficiency. In the years after inde-
pendence, he traveled around India on
foot to meet the people. It was on oneBhima
such tour that he started the Bhoodan
(“land gift”) movement, the purpose of
which was to obtain donations of land
for the poor. Much of Bhave’s life after
independence was devoted to village
development, in particular through a
movement called Sarvodaya (“welfare of
all”), which sought to solve problems
through collective involvement and ser-
vice to one another.
Bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) Philosophical
school whose best-known figures were
Bhartrprapancha and Bhaskara. The
Bhedabhada position identified three
levels of being: the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman, the “witness” con-
sciousness (sakshin) in the human
being, and the world. The school para-
doxically asserted that these three levels
are identical, yet different. Thus the
world is identical to Brahman but is sub-
ject to change and decay, unlike
Brahman. In the same way, while each
human soul is identical to Brahman, it is
also subject to bondage and reincarna-
tion (samsara), unlike Brahman. The
bondage of the soul was caused by the
primal ignorance known as avidya, but
it could be erased by a combination of
action and awareness (jnanakar-
masamucchaya). The basic philosophi-
cal problem for Bhartrprapancha and
his followers was that because they
believed that Brahman was actually
transformed into the world and the Self
(parinamavada), it followed that
Brahman was subject to bondage and
ignorance. Thus, if one must destroy
avidya to gain liberation, one must also
destroy part of Brahman. These were
difficult ideas to defend since the tran-
scendence of Brahman was well estab-
lished by sacred texts such as the
Upanishads, and this problem may
account for the school’s relatively
short life.
Bhil
The name of a tribal (adivasi) group
found in greatest numbers in the
Vindhya Mountains, in the eastern part
of the state of Madhya Pradesh. They
are historically associated with the for-
est, particularly with hunting and gath-
ering honey. As with many tribal groups,
their homeland is often in marginal
lands, and most of them are quite poor.
Bhima
The third of the five Pandava brothers
who
are
the
heroes
in
the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. Bhima is born when his
mother, Kunti, uses a powerful mantra
(sacred sound) to have a son by the
wind-god, Vayu. Of all the Pandavas,
Bhima is the largest and strongest, and
his favorite weapon is the club, which
requires great physical strength. This
strength is one of the sources of enmity
between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas (cousins of the Pandavas),
since during their adolescent training,
Bhima can always draw on his superior
power to outdo his cousins. His earthy
and untamed nature is evident through
his consumption of strange foods as well
as from his liaison with the rakshasi
(female demon) Hidambi, by whom he
has a son, Ghatotkacha. Bhima’s notable
deeds tend to be feats of strength. In
many cases this involves killing demons,
such as Bakasur or Hidamba in hand-to-
hand combat; but Bhima is also a major
figure in the Mahabharata war, in which
he uses his club to kill great masses of the
Kaurava army.
Besides his strength and unusual
appetites, which make him a figure sub-
ject to caricature, Bhima is also
absolutely devoted to his brothers and
to their common wife, Draupadi.
Whenever her honor is at stake, Bhima is
the person to whom she turns. When
Draupadi is molested by Kichaka during
the year that the Pandavas spend incog-
nito at the court of King Virata, Bhima
disguises himself as Draupadi, goes to
meet Kichaka, and kills him. It is also
Bhima who vows to kill the two
Kaurava brothers, Duhshasana and
Duryodhana, because of their behavior
toward Draupadi after Bhima’s brother

western ghats and meeting with the
Krishna in the state of Karnataka. At the
Bhima’s headwaters can be found
Bhimashankar, which is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a group of sacred
sites (tirthas) deemed especially holy
to the god Shiva. Aside from
Bhimashankar, another important reli-
gious site on the Bhima is the temple of
Vithoba at Pandharpur.
Bhimashankar
Bhima River at Pandharpur,
in the state of Maharashtra.
Yudhishthira loses an important game
of dice. Duhshasana drags Draupadi
into the hall by her hair, her garments
stained with menstrual blood, and
Duryodhana bares his thigh (a
euphemism for the genitals) toward
Draupadi and directs her to sit on his
lap. Bhima vows that to avenge these
insults he will rip open Duhshasana’s
chest so that Draupadi can wash her
hair in his blood, and smash
Duryodhana’s thigh with his club.
Although it takes thirteen years before
he carries out these promises, in the end
he avenges Draupadi’s honor. After the
Mahabharata war, Bhima aids his
brother Yudhishthira in reigning as king.
After Yudhishthira abdicates the throne,
Bhima travels with him and their other
brothers on a great journey to the
Himalayas, where Bhima eventually
dies of exposure.
Bhima River
A central Indian tributary of the
Krishna River, rising in the state of
Maharashtra, on the inland side of the
[[110]]

(“Bhima’s Shiva”) One of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sacred sites
(tirthas) deemed especially holy to the
god Shiva. Bhimashankar is the name of
both the place and the presiding deity. It
is located in Maharashtra’s Pune district
at the source of the Bhima River, hence
its name. Unlike many of the other
jyotirlingas, Bhimashankar is visited little
during the year since it is far from urban
centers and relatively inaccessible. The
major pilgrim traffic comes on the festi-
val of Shivaratri, which usually falls
within February and March.
Bhishma
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Bhishma is the son of
King Shantanu and an uncle and coun-
selor to both warring factions, the
Pandavas and the Kauravas. His name
as a child is Devavrata; he receives the
name Bhishma (“terrible”) as an
acknowledgment of his extremely diffi-
cult vow. King Shantanu has fallen in
love with the maiden Satyavati, who
agrees to marry him on the condition
that her sons will rule instead of
Devavrata, who has already been
anointed the heir apparent. Bhishma
not only agrees to give up the throne but
takes the solemn vow that he will never
marry, so that there will be no claimants
from his lineage to compete for the
throne. When Bhishma takes his dread-
ful vow, he is also given the option of
choosing the time of his death.
Bhishma faithfully keeps this vow,
and his adherence to it eventually costsBhogawara
him his life. It is Bhishma who abducts
Amba, Ambika, and Ambalika, the
daughters of the king of Kashi, to
be married to his stepbrother
Vichitravirya. Ambika and Ambalika
happily marry Vichitravirya, but when
Amba confides that she has already
given her heart to King Salva, Bhishma
releases her to go to him. Salva rejects
Amba on the grounds that her virgin-
ity is suspect, since she has been
abducted by another man. Amba
returns to Bhishma and demands that
he marry her since he is responsible
for her plight, and when Bhishma
refuses to break his vow, Amba is
determined to get revenge. She is
reborn as the man-woman Shikhandi,
behind whom the Pandava prince
Arjuna hides to shoot the arrows that
eventually kill Bhishma.
Bhishma is a great man who is
respected by all. His skill with arms
makes him one of the finest warriors of
his time, but he is most famous as a wise
and generous counselor to both the
Pandavas and the Kauravas. Although
he ultimately sides with the Kaurava
prince Duryodhana in the war
between the two groups, before its
outbreak Bhishma repeatedly advises
Duryodhana to make peace with the
Pandavas and share the kingdom with
them. He fights valiantly in the
Mahabharata war and destroys a large
part of the Pandava armies, but finally
he is hit by so many of Arjuna’s arrows
that he lays upon them like a bed.
Although Bhishma is mortally wounded
by Arjuna, he delays his death (through
the boon given by his vow) until the sun
resumes its more auspicious northern
path (uttarayana). During this time he
gives the victorious Pandavas copious
instruction on state affairs and related
topics. Bhishma’s unswerving commit-
ment to a vow that deprives him of the
joys of family life, and his inability to
avert the fratricidal conflict between his
nephews, through which the family is
ultimately destroyed, make him a lonely,
somewhat tragic figure.
Bhishma Ashtami
Festival celebrated on the eighth day
(ashtami) of the light, or waxing, half of
the lunar month called Magh
(January–February), marking the death
of Bhishma. Bhishma is an uncle to
both the Kauravas and the Pandavas,
warring factions in the Hindu epic
Mahabharata. He is well known for his
bravery, continence, and truthfulness.
He also has the power to choose the
time of his death. Although he is mortal-
ly wounded in the great Mahabharata
war, he remains alive until weeks later
(delivering discourses and advice to the
victorious Pandavas the entire time),
delaying his death until the sun has
resumed
its
northward
course
(uttarayana). On this day parents give
offerings of food and water in
Bhishma’s name in the hope that their
sons may have his good qualities.
Bhogamandapa
(“food pavilion”) The outermost
entrance hall in the style of architecture
found in the largest temples in Orissa.
At the temple of Jagannath in Puri, the
term bhogamandapa specifically refers
to the area where the food offered to
Jagannath as prasad (“favor”) is cooked.
Jagannath’s temple is unusual in that the
normal restrictions regarding commen-
sality are suspended. Everyone eats
together rather than being segregated by
caste, signifying Jagannath’s ultimate
lordship over all beings. The promi-
nence of this particular rite makes the
bhogamandapa all the more important.
Bhogawara
One of the four major organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva; the other
three groups are Kitawara, Bhuriwara,
and Anandawara. Each of these divi-
sions has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each group also has
[[111]]
Bhoja
certain religious associations: with one
of the four Vedas, with a particular quar-
ter of the Indian subcontinent, with one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth, with a
specific ascetic quality, and with several
of the ten Dashanami divisions. The
Bhogawara group is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri on
the Bay of Bengal, and it is therefore
connected with the eastern quarter of
India. Their Veda is the Rg Veda, their
mahavakya is Prajnanam Brahman
(“Knowledge is Brahman”), and their
ascetic quality is to remain indifferent to
worldly pleasures. The particular
divisions associated with this group
are the Aranya Dashanamis and
Vana Dashanamis.
Bhoja
(r. 918–955 C.E.) Medieval Hindu king in
the Malwa region of the modern state of
Uttar Pradesh. Bhoja was famous both
as a scholar and as a dam builder who
created lakes for irrigation.
Bholanath
(“simple lord”) Common epithet of the
god Shiva. In ordinary usage the word
bhola carries a negative connotation:
“simple,” “guileless,” and even “foolish.”
Yet in using this word to designate Shiva,
his devotees (bhakta) are not intention-
ally insulting him but celebrating his
boundless generosity to those with
whom he is pleased. Shiva’s devotees
can give the simplest offerings (such as
leaves, fruit, and water) and in turn ask
for wealth, success, and power. Shiva’s
nature is considered “simple” because
he willingly participates in such unequal
exchanges, providing sharp contrast to
the world economy, which demands
equal value.
Bhramargit
(“songs to the bee”) Poetic genre in the
devotional poetry of the god Krishna,
which is set in the time after Krishna has
gone to claim his kingdom in Mathura,
[[112]]

never to return. The story tells how
Krishna sends his companion Uddhava
back to Braj with a message for the
gopis, the cowherd women who are
Krishna’s dear companions, and who are
virtually insane with longing because of
his absence. Uddhava tries to reassure
the gopis by telling them not to dwell on
Krishna’s physical absence. Uddhava
further reminds them that since Krishna
is the all-pervading divinity, he will
always be with them even though he
might not be visible. In the bhramargit
poems, the gopis scornfully reject
Uddhava’s notions, asserting that this
view of Krishna is abstract, lifeless, and
suitable only for those who have never
known Krishna in his embodied form.
The genre’s name comes from this
story’s earliest appearance, in the
Bhagavata Purana. Here the gopis
address their complaints about
Krishna’s absence to a large black bee,
which in their passion and loneliness
they mistake for Krishna.
Bhramari
(“circling”) Powerful form of the
Goddess. Bhramari takes form to
oppose the demon Aruna, who in his
hubris is trying to compromise the
chastity of the gods’ wives. They implore
the Goddess to help them, and in her
form as Bhramari, she kills the demon
and removes the threat. Bhramari is
worshiped on the eighth night of
Navaratri, a nine-day festival in which
one goddess is appeased every night.
Bhrgu
In Hindu mythology, one of the sons of
Brahma and one of the seven sages
whose names mark exogamous clan
“lineages” (gotra); the others are
Kashyapa, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Gautama, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All
brahmins are believed to be descended
from these seven sages, with each
family taking the name of its progenitor
as its gotra name. In modern times these
divisions are still important sinceBhushundi
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
After her marriage the bride adopts
her husband’s gotra as part of her
new identity.
Bhrgu is most famous for testing the
three major Hindu gods, which results
in Vishnu being declared the greatest of
the three. Bhrgu first goes to Brahma’s
house where the god does not pay Bhrgu
appropriate respect, and in revenge
Bhrgu curses Brahma to receive no wor-
ship. Next he goes to see Shiva, who
refuses to meet with him because he is
making love to his wife Parvati at the
time. In turn, Bhrgu curses Shiva to be
worshiped as the linga, the pillar-
shaped symbol that has undeniable
phallic associations. Lastly he visits
Vishnu and, finding him asleep, gives
him a sound kick in the chest. Vishnu
wakes up, but shows no anger at this dis-
respect. Instead he massages Bhrgu’s
foot, gently inquires whether it has been
hurt, and promises to retain its mark on
his chest forever, where it appears as the
shrivatsa. Vishnu’s magnanimous
behavior leads Bhrgu to proclaim him
the best of all the gods. Not surprisingly,
this version of the tale appears only in
Vaishnava sectarian literature. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Bhubaneshvar
Capital city of the modern Indian state
of Orissa. Bhubaneshvar reportedly has
over 500 temples, of which the most
prominent is the Lingaraja Temple. It is
dedicated to Shiva in his form as
Tribhuvaneshvar (“Lord of the Triple
World”), from which the city also gets
its name.
Bhudevi
See earth.
Bhujangavalaya
(“snake bracelet”) In Hindu iconogra-
phy, the name of a particular ornament
worn by the god Shiva. The bhujan-
gavalaya is a bracelet shaped in the form
of a snake. In Hindu mythology Shiva is
famous for wearing serpents, especially
cobras, as ornaments around his
arms and torso. This is just one of the
attributes that marks him as different,
powerful, and potentially dangerous.
The prescriptive canons for the creation
of Hindu images have followed up on
this tradition, and Shiva is invariably
shown wearing these bracelets.
Bhuriwara
One of the four major organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva; the other
three groups are Kitawara, Bhogawara,
and Anandawara. Each of these groups
has its headquarters in one of the four
monastic centers (maths) supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each division also has
certain religious associations: with one
of the four Vedas, with a particular quar-
ter of the Indian subcontinent, with one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth, with a partic-
ular ascetic quality, and with several of
the ten Dashanami divisions. The
Bhuriwara group is affiliated with the
Shringeri Math in the southern Indian
town of Shringeri and is thus connected
with the southern quarter of India. Their
Veda is the Yajur Veda, their mahavakya
is Aham Brahmasmi (“I am Brahman”),
and their ascetic quality is to renounce
all wealth and to live on food growing
wild in the jungles. The specific divi-
sions associated with this group are
Saraswati
Dashanami,
Bharati
Dashanami, and Puri Dashanami.
Bhushundi
A character in the Ramcharitmanas,
the version of the Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?).
Bhushundi is a crow who symbolizes the
power of devotion to God to redeem
even the lowest of creatures. One of the
most pronounced differences between
the original Valmiki Ramayana and the
Tulsidas Ramayana is that Tulsidas puts
[[113]]
Bhut

far greater stress on devotion to Rama,
of which Bhushundi is a perfect exam-
ple. In Indian culture, crows are consid-
ered unclean birds since they are
scavengers who will eat anything. Yet in
one of the narrative levels of the
Ramcharitmanas, it is the “unclean”
crow Bhushundi who narrates the story
to the “sacred” eagle Garuda—the vehi-
cle of the god Vishnu. As part of his
account in the Ramayana, Bhushundi
relates the terrifying experience of being
given an unmediated vision of Rama in
all his majesty, and how he (as did the
sage Markandeya) went into Rama’s
mouth and perceived the entire uni-
verse inside.
Bhut
(“[someone who] was”) The spirit of a
person who has recently died, which is
still inappropriately connected to the
world of the living. This is often a trou-
bling or malevolent presence, either to
the departed’s family or the general pop-
ulation. Bhuts and other malignant spir-
its, such as prets or churails, have
generally either suffered an untimely or
[[114]]

violent death or died with certain unful-
filled desires, particularly relating
to marriage and family life. In cases
where both these factors are present, the
likelihood of the departed becoming a
bhut is deemed much greater. Bhuts
make themselves known to the living
through either dreams or possession. In
some cases they have specific requests
and can be placated by worship and
offerings. In such cases the dreams and
possession are methods of communi-
cating with the living, who can perform
the necessary actions. Some bhuts
resort to possession as an attempt to
realize their unfulfilled desires by
directly using a living person’s body.
These spirits are far more malevolent,
and the only way to remove them is
through exorcism. For further informa-
tion on the care of restless family spirits,
see Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988; for a masterful psycho-
logical interpretation of spirits, posses-
sion, and healing, see Sudhir Kakar,

BhutaBhutayajna
Epithet of the god Shiva. See Shiva.(“elemental lingas”) A network of five
southern Indian sacred sites (tirthas),
four in the state of Tamil Nadu and one
in Andhra Pradesh, all dedicated to the
god Shiva. In each of these centers, the
most sacred object is the linga, a pillar-
shaped form representing Shiva. What
makes these sites unique is that the
linga is supposedly composed of one of
the five primordial elements. Thus the
linga in Tiruvannamalai is formed from
fire; the linga in Jambukeshvar is
formed from water; the one in
Kanchipuram is made from earth; that
in Kalahasti, the sacred site in Andhra
Pradesh, is formed from air; and the
linga in Chidambaram is made from
space. Between them, these five sites
comprise a symbolic cosmology that
encompasses all created things.(“sacrifice to creatures”) One of the five
great sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
that is prescribed in the texts on reli-
gious duty (Dharma Shastras). These
five great sacrifices are daily religious
observances for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder born into
one of the three “twice-born” groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya,
and vaishya—who is eligible to receive
the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” Each sacri-
fice (yajna) is directed toward a different
class of beings, from the Ultimate
Reality down to animals, and is satisfied
by specific actions. The bhutayajna is
directed toward animals and outcasts
(and in some understandings, ghosts),
and it is satisfied by putting out food for
them to eat. In the time since the
Dharma Shastras were composed,
Hindu life has undergone significant
changes, and this particular sacrifice is
rarely performed today.
BhutamBidhai Samaroh
Bhutalingas
(7th c. C.E.) With Pey and Poygai, one of
the first three Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. Their stress
on passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, trans-
formed and revitalized Hindu religious
life. According to tradition, the three
men were caught in a torrential storm,
and one by one they took shelter in a
small dry spot, with each making room
for the next. As they stood together they
felt a fourth presence, which was
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy
was sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s mani-
festation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,
the three burst into song, which formed
the first of their compositions. For fur-
ther information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975.
(“farewell celebration”) In northern
India, the formal departure of a new
bride for her marital home. This is a
momentous event for several different
reasons. A marriage is the start of a fam-
ily, and through her marriage a young
woman gets the opportunity to become
a wife and mother; these roles are still
seen as a woman’s highest fulfillment
and happiness. Yet according to the tra-
ditional model of the Indian joint family,
after marriage a woman goes to live with
and becomes part of her husband’s fam-
ily. Thus the act of seeing off a new bride
carries bittersweet feelings—happiness
for her marriage and hopes for her good
fortune, but also the sense that things
have irreversibly changed.
Bihar
One of the states in modern northern
India, sandwiched between Uttar
Pradesh and West Bengal, with Nepal
on its northern border. Bihar has an
[[115]]
Bijak
incredibly rich history; it was the ances-
tral homeland of the Maurya dynasty,
which ruled over much of the Indian
subcontinent between the fourth and
third centuries before the common era.
The capital city was at Pataliputra, iden-
tified with modern Patna. Bihar also
contains the town of Bodh Gaya, where
the Buddha attained enlightenment,
in addition to many other places
associated with events in his life.
Despite this lush past, modern Bihar
is an extremely difficult place to live;
illiteracy and infant mortality rates are
very high, life expectancy is fairly low,
and social conditions can best be
described as feudal. Most of its citizens
can barely make a living and do so
through agriculture, while a small per-
centage are fabulously wealthy. Bihar is
also a textbook example of what modern
Indians call the “criminalization of poli-
tics,” in which known criminals are
either agents for politicians or are them-
selves holding political office. Although
Bihar has abundant mineral resources,
its pervasive corruption virtually ensures
that their benefits will reach only a few.
Despite all of these disadvantages, Bihar
does have well-known sacred sites
(tirthas). One of these is the town of
Gaya, famous as a place to perform
funerary rites (antyeshthi samskara).
Another sacred place is the temple at
Vaidyanath, which is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a group of sites especially
sacred to the god Shiva. For general
information about Bihar and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference
is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed.,
Lonely Planet, 1998.
Bijak
(“inventory”) One of the three main col-
lections of verse ascribed to the poet-
saint Kabir (mid-15th c.?); the other two
are found in the Adigranth and the
manuscripts of the religious organiza-
tion Dadupanth. Kabir is the best
known of the sants, an umbrella term
for a group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who share several
[[116]]

concepts: stress on individualized, inte-
rior religion leading to a personal expe-
rience of the divine; disdain for external
ritual, particularly image worship; faith
in the power of the divine Name; and a
tendency to ignore conventional caste
distinctions. Of all the sants, Kabir is the
most iconoclastic with regard to estab-
lished religious practices and authori-
ties. He invariably emphasizes the need
for individual searching and realization.
Given the content of Kabir’s message,
it is notable that the Bijak is the scrip-
ture of the Kabirpanth, a religious com-
munity claiming to be his followers.
Certainly Kabir himself would have con-
demned the notion of making him the
founder of anything, or of his verses
gaining the authority of a scripture. In
content, the Bijak contains verses of
varying types: short epigrams that have
become proverbial wisdom, longer stan-
zas in the chaupai form, and shorter
two-line verse (doha). Linguistic fea-
tures identify the Bijak as belonging to
the eastern part of the Hindi language
region, hence its common name as the
“eastern” recension. For translations of
the text itself, see Linda Hess and
Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak of
Kabir, 1983.
Bijakshara
(“seed syllable”) In the esoteric ritual
tradition known as tantra, a bijakshara
is a particular set of syllabic utterances
that is believed to have an intimate con-
nection with a deity—either as a way of
gaining access to the god’s power or as
the subtlest form of the deity itself.
These syllables are usually meaningless
sounds (for example, aum, hrim, klim),
although at times they may contain
actual words. Bijaksharas are important
not for their meaning but for the power
inherent in the sounds themselves. The
transmission of such seed syllables and
the entitlement (adhikara) to use them
is an important feature of tantric initia-
tion (diksha). For further information
see Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and DouglasBirth
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Bilva
The wood-apple tree (Aegle marmelos).
Although this tree is known for its deli-
cious fruit, its primary religious impor-
tance is its leaves. These are used in the
worship of Shiva and are usually placed
as an offering on the god’s image or
linga (pillar-shaped symbol). These
leaves are believed to be dearer to him
than any other offering. In everyday lan-
guage this tree is also commonly known
as the bel.
Bimbisara
(d. 494 B.C.E.) King of Magadha, the
region corresponding to modern Bihar,
whose reign ended shortly before the
traditionally accepted date for the death
of the Buddha. Bimbisara was an ener-
getic administrator who had designs on
ruling a much larger empire. To this end,
he tried to conquer and control large
parts of the Ganges basin. Bimbisara is
believed to have been the first king to
conceive of ruling a large empire,
although he was deposed and murdered
by his son Ajatashatru before he saw it
become a reality.
Bindu
(“drop”) In the Shrividya school, a par-
ticular branch of the esoteric ritual tra-
dition known as tantra, the bindu is the
name for the dot in the very center of the
shrichakra, which is a Shrividya sym-
bolic diagram (yantra) used in worship.
The shrichakra is composed of nine
interlocking triangles—four pointing up
and five pointing down—surrounded by
a double series of lotus petals and exte-
rior circular and angular walls. The
bindu symbolizes the ultimate unity of
the divine principles, Shiva and Shakti,
and by extension the unity of all reality.
For further information see Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Bindusara
(3rd c. B.C.E.) Son of Chandragupta
Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan
empire, and father of Ashoka, the
empire’s greatest figure. At Bindusara’s
accession the Mauryans controlled the
Indus and Ganges river basins.
Bindusara not only consolidated his
father’s gains, but also expanded
Mauryan control into the Deccan
region as far south as Mysore. He was
reportedly a man of universal tastes,
since tradition holds that he asked
Antiochus I, the Seleucid ruler of Syria,
for sweet wine, dried figs, and a sophist.
Antiochus apparently sent the first two
items but declared that Greek philoso-
phers were not for export. See also
Maurya dynasty.
Birla, Ghanshyamdas
(1894–1983) Patriarch of the Birla indus-
trial family. The Birlas made a fortune in
opium in the early decades of the twen-
tieth century and then diversified into a
variety of other industrial ventures.
Ghanshyamdas was a close friend of
Mohandas K. Gandhi and the major
financial supporter for Gandhi’s politi-
cal organization, the Indian National
Congress, to which Birla had given an
estimated 100 million rupees by the
time of independence. In his later years,
he devoted considerable money and
attention to building temples, sponsor-
ing religious and charitable trusts, and
performing other honorable deeds.
Birth
At its most basic level, birth is a biologi-
cal event, but it becomes a cultural
event by virtue of the rites performed for
and significance given to it. Different
Hindu communities show considerable
regional and sectarian variation in the
ways that they mark a birth, but several
themes remain fairly constant. Although
the birth of a child is a highly auspicious
occasion, it is also considered impure
because of the various bodily tissues
and fluids coming with it (blood,
[[117]]
Black Yajur Veda
amulets, is also quite common. For fur-
ther information see Lawrence Babb,
The Divine Hierarchy, 1975; and
Doranne Jacobsen, “Golden Handprints
and Redpainted Feet: Hindu Childbirth
Rituals in Central India,” in Nancy Falk
and Rita M. Gross (eds.), Unspoken
Worlds: Women’s Religious Lives in Non-
Western Cultures, 2000.
Black Yajur Veda

of a boar to combat a demon.
membranes, amniotic fluid, placenta,
etc.). Thus, birth rituals usually include
rites of purification for both mother and
child, to remove this birth impurity
(sutakashaucha). For the mother this is
fairly simple: a bath after the birth fol-
lowed by baths during a period of seclu-
sion (7–10 days). The final rite for the
child, the head shaving known as the
chudakarana samskara, may not come
for years after the birth.
Aside from impurity (ashaucha),
another constant theme is the threat of
potential danger. Immediately after
birth, both mother and child are seen as
highly vulnerable, not only from envi-
ronmental stresses such as cold, fatigue,
or infection, but from ills brought on by
witchcraft or the evil eye (nazar). Given
this concern, it is not surprising that the
placenta and all other childbirth
byproducts are carefully collected and
disposed of, lest they be used for spells.
The period of seclusion after the birth is
intended both to prevent contact with
such malevolent forces and to ward
them off through rites of protection.
The mother is usually given massages
and fed strengthening foods to bolster
her resistance. The use of charms, or

Along with the White Yajur Veda, one of
the two major forms of the Yajur Veda,
one of the oldest Hindu religious texts.
The major difference between these two
forms is in the placement of explanatory
notes on the Vedic mantras (sacred
sounds) and their significance. The four
recensions of the Black Yajur Veda
include these notes in the text itself. In
contrast, the one recension of the White
Yajur Veda gathers these notes into an
appendix known as a Brahmana, which
gives its name to the second major stra-
tum of Vedic texts.
Blessing
See ashirvad.
Blood
As with all bodily fluids, blood is consid-
ered ritually impure and a source of pol-
lution upon contact. Blood is also
deemed a “hot” and powerful substance,
not only by virtue of its impurity
(ashaucha), but also because of its con-
nection with life. Witches are popularly
seen as deriving their nourishment from
human blood. This highlights both their
malevolent character, since they can only
live by destroying others, and also their
marginal, antisocial quality, since they
feed on a substance considered violently
impure. In another context, blood from
animal sacrifice is often offered to vil-
lage deities or to certain powerful and
terrifying forms of the Goddess. Any
deities taking blood sacrifice are consid-
ered “hot,” meaning that they are power-
ful enough to grant favors to devotees but
also marginal, potentially dangerous,Brahma
and requiring continual infusions of life-
sustaining blood to maintain their pow-
ers. See also witchcraft.
Boar Avatar
The third avatar, or “incarnation,” of the
god Vishnu. Vishnu takes this form at
the beginning of one of the cosmic ages,
when the process of creation has been
interrupted by the disappearance of the
Earth. The source of this problem is the
demon-king Hiranyaksha, who has
kidnapped the Earth and hidden her in
the depths of the cosmic ocean. Taking
the form of a giant boar, Vishnu dives to
the bottom of the ocean, where he slays
Hiranyaksha, places the Earth on the tip
of his tusk, and lifts her from the waters.
With the reappearance of the Earth, the
process of creation resumes.
It is generally accepted that the
avatar doctrine provided a way to assim-
ilate smaller regional deities into the
larger pantheon by designating them as
forms of Vishnu. This inference is
supported by the Boar avatar, which
seems to have absorbed an ancient cult
in central India by making the boar an
incarnation of Vishnu. In modern times
the Boar avatar is worshiped little,
although it had a significant following
in the past, particularly in central
India. This is partly supported by the
sculptural record; the caves at Ellora
and Udayagiri have particularly
fine sculptural renditions of this
avatar. For further information see
Arthur Llewellyn Basham, The Wonder
That Was India, 1968.
Bose, Subhash Chandra
(1896–1945) Bengali politician and free-
dom fighter. Before World War II, Bose
had unsuccessfully contested with
Mohandas K. Gandhi for the leadership
of the Congress Party. Bose was more
impatient than Gandhi for the British to
leave, and he was more willing to expel
them by force. During World War II, Bose
used Japanese patronage to form the
Indian National Army (INA), whose
objective was to expel the British from
India by armed force. Starting in
Singapore the INA marched 5,000 miles
through Southeast Asia, but they were
ultimately defeated by the British army
at the city of Kohima in eastern India.
Although there is eyewitness testimony
that Bose died from burns stemming
from a plane crash in the final days of
the Pacific war, even today many
Bengalis believe that he is still alive and
living incognito.
Brahma
Brahma is the first member of the
Trimurti, the “three forms” of divinity
made up of the dominant male deities
in the Hindu pantheon: Brahma as the
creator of the universe, Vishnu as the
preserver or sustainer, and Shiva as the
destroyer. Brahma is usually portrayed
with four heads (the fifth having been
cut off by Bhairava, a wrathful form of
Shiva), and his animal vehicle is the
hamsa, or Indian goose.
According to one widely held myth,
during the time of cosmic dissolution
between world cycles, Vishnu floats in
the middle of the cosmic ocean, lying
on the giant serpent Shesha. When the
time for creation comes, a lotus
sprouts from Vishnu’s navel and opens
to reveal Brahma inside. Brahma takes
up the work of creation, and at the end
of the world cycle, Brahma returns to
the lotus, which is reabsorbed into
Vishnu. Because of his spontaneous
appearance at the beginning of every
cosmic age, one of the names for
Brahma is Svayambhu (“self-born”).
Unlike the Judeo-Christian belief, the
world is not created from nothing.
Brahma merely arranges the existing
elements of the universe into a coher-
ent and ordered cosmos.
Brahma is a major figure in the pan-
theon and is prominent in many
episodes in Hindu mythology. His myth-
ic presence often obscures the fact that
he is never worshiped as a primary
deity. In fact, he has only one temple
devoted to him in all of India, in
[[119]]
Brahmacharin
Pushkar. Some Hindus have attributed
this lack of worship to his status as the
creator. After all, since creation has been
completed, why should one bother with
Brahma, whose work is done? In the
puranas, texts on Hindu mythology, this
lack of worship is usually ascribed to a
curse—sometimes by the god Shiva but
in other stories by the sage Bhrgu.
Brahmacharin
(“seeker of Brahman”) A term with sev-
eral possible meanings depending on
the context. In the dharma literature,
which gives instruction on religious
duties, a brahmacharin is a person in a
period of religious study. This period is
the first of the four ashramas (“stages of
life”) of a twice-born man, that is, a man
born into one of three groups in Indian
society: brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya.
Such men are eligible to receive the ado-
lescent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” According to the ideal,
after his initiation and adornment with
the sacred thread—the most visible sign
of a twice-born man—the brah-
macharin shall live in his guru’s house-
hold and study the Veda, the oldest
Hindu religious text, in addition to per-
forming other religious acts. Since brah-
macharins are focused on gaining
religious knowledge, this is supposed to
be a very austere time of life marked by
strict celibacy, hard work, service to the
teacher, meticulous observance of all
religious rites, and avoidance of luxuries
such as beds, cosmetics, and bodily
ornaments. Once this period of study is
over, the student will marry and enter
the second ashrama, that of the house-
holder. The system described in the
dharma literature is an idealized model,
and one cannot be sure that it was ever
strictly followed. Although many con-
temporary brahmin boys still undergo
the “second birth,” other elements—
such as the ascetic lifestyle and empha-
sis on the study of the Veda—are largely
ignored in contemporary times.
Some of the term’s original mean-
ing remains in an ascetic context.
[[120]]

Brahmacharin can also be defined as a
novice or junior monk, whose duty is to
serve and learn from the senior monks,
or as the name of two particular ascetic
groups. One of these groups is the pres-
tigious Swaminarayan sect, whose
members are recruited solely from the
caste of brahmins. The other is an orga-
nization called the Brahmachari
Sanyasis, devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva who are distinct from the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Brahmachari
Sanyasis have an ashram on Mount
Girnar and in the bathing (snana)
festival known as the Kumbha Mela,
the Brahmachari Naga (fighting)
Sanyasis have a recognized place
among the other Naga groups. For
further information see G. S. Ghurye,
Indian Sadhus, 1964.
Brahmacharya
(“going after Brahman”) In its most tra-
ditional sense, this word refers to the
lifestyle of a young man belonging to a
particular class during his life as a stu-
dent (brahmacharin). This period is the
first of the four ashramas (“stages of
life”) of a twice-born man, that is, a
man born into one of three groups in
Indian society: brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya. Such men are eligible to
receive the adolescent religious initia-
tion known as the “second birth.” His
life as a student will then commence,
and he will move into his guru’s house-
hold and study the sacred texts, the
Vedas. This is conceived as a period of
intense study, religious practice, and an
austere lifestyle marked by the restraint
of desires, for which the hallmark is
celibacy. Although the model of the
four ashramas is largely archaic in mod-
ern times, the word brahmacharya still
connotes this sort of austere religious
lifestyle, and it is often used as a syn-
onym for celibacy.
Brahmahatya
(“brahmin murder”) In the dharma lit-
erature, which gives instruction on reli-
gious duties, brahmahatya is one of theBrahma Marriage
four great crimes that makes one an
outcast from society. This crime’s seri-
ousness stems from notions of brahmin
sanctity and status; with the exception
of self-defense, the deliberate murder of
a brahmin holds serious repercussions.
Even the gods are subject to this act’s
negative karmic consequences. Hindu
mythology records that the god
Bhairava wanders the earth for years
after cutting off one of the heads of the
god Brahma. The skull sticks to his
hand as a visible sign of his crime until it
finally falls off at Kapalamochana. In
the more lenient prescriptions in the
dharma literature, the punishment for a
brahmin murderer is parallel to that of
Bhairava. The murderer has to carry the
skull of the dead man for twelve years,
wearing only a rough garment to cover
his loins, and during that period he has
to live on alms, begging at no more
than seven houses per day. After twelve
years he is deemed pure, unless the
murder was intentional, in which case
the term of punishment is doubled.
According to several commentators,
however, when a brahmin is intention-
ally murdered by a kshatriya, vaishya,
or shudra, the only possible expiation
(prayashchitta) is death.
Brahma Kumaris
Modern Hindu religious organization
founded in the 1930s by a Sindhi jeweler
named Dada Lekhraj. In 1947, after the
partition of British India into India and
Pakistan, the organization relocated its
headquarters from Sindh (in modern
Pakistan) to Mount Abu in the Indian
state of Rajasthan. Although the sect
has only about 100,000 members—
minuscule by Hindu standards—it is
noteworthy for several reasons. Unlike
most Hindus, the Brahma Kumaris
aggressively seeks out and converts new
members, and thus it has a much higher
profile than other religious sects. The
organization preaches a doctrine fore-
telling the imminent end of the world,
which must be prepared for by radical
asceticism. It is also noteworthy that
since its beginning, the majority of its
adherents have been women.
The movement began following a
series of apocalyptic visions by Dada
Lekhraj. These visions not only con-
vinced him of the coming tribulation
but also reinforced his conviction that a
human being’s real identity lay not in
the body but in the soul. This latter real-
ization resulted in the organization’s
adoption of complete celibacy. When
this ideal was adopted by some of his
young women followers, it initially led to
a tremendous uproar, because they
renounced their primary traditional
roles as wives and mothers. The move-
ment persisted despite these troubles,
which bound the followers together
even more tightly. By the time Dada
Lekhraj died in 1969, the movement had
developed a strong missionary bent. All
of these factors make it unusual and, in
the eyes of many ordinary Hindus, mar-
ginal and suspicious. For further infor-
mation see Lawrence Babb, Redemptive
Encounters, 1987.
Brahma Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a
marriage according to the Dharma
Shastras, the treatises on religious
duty (dharma). In a Brahma marriage
the bride’s father gives away his
daughter, along with any ornaments
he can afford, to a learned man of
good character. This man is respect-
fully invited to accept her with
absolutely no conditions or fees. This
form is considered the most suitable
for Brahmans because it is free from
lust or any sort of financial induce-
ments, hence the name Brahma mar-
riage. For these reasons it is also
deemed the best of the four approved
(prashasta) forms of marriage.
The Brahma marriage is one of the
two forms practiced in modern India. It
is by far the more socially respectable,
since the asura marriage—in which the
groom gives money to the bride and her
family—carries the connotation of sell-
ing the bride. Yet even with the Brahma
[[121]]
Brahma Muhurta
After death, a liberated person’s soul is believed to escape through an opening in the skull
called the brahmarandhra. This is thought to correspond to the fontanel,
an opening in an infant’s skull (right) that closes in adulthood (left).
marriage, there has been significant
divergence from the classically mandat-
ed form. In many modern Indian
weddings, it has become common for
the bride’s family to give the groom’s
family a dowry as a condition for
the marriage, which can easily be
interpreted as selling the groom. See
also marriage, eight classical forms,
and prashasta marriages.
Brahma Muhurta
(“time of Brahma”) The forty-eight-
minute period (muhurta) immediately
before sunrise, which is thought to be
the most auspicious time of the day.
This auspiciousness makes it the
best time for worship, meditation, or
any type of religious practice; serious
spiritual aspirants rise before it begins
so that they may take full advantage
of the time.
Brahman
In its first appearances in the Rg Veda,
the earliest text in the sacred literature
[[122]]

known as the Vedas, the term Brahman
both denotes the power inherent in, and
gives potency to, the sacred word. In the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the Vedas, brahman was the
name for one of the four types of priests
who officiated at a sacrifice (the others
being hotr, udgatr, and adhvaryum). In
the Upanishads and afterward,
Brahman is the generally accepted term
for the highest reality in the universe,
which is both the material cause and the
final cause of all that exists. In the world-
view of the Upanishads, the speculative
and most recent texts in the Vedas,
Brahman is the single binding unity
behind the world’s apparent diversity.
These texts also affirm Brahman’s iden-
tity with atman, the individual soul, and
thus the identity of the essence of
macrocosm and microcosm. As
described in many of the Upanishads
and later systematized by the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya (9th c.), the ulti-
mate form of Brahman is without
qualities (nirguna), formless, nameless,
indefinable, and grammatically a neuterBrahma Sampraday
noun. In contrast, particular deities are
seen as lower, provisional, qualified
(saguna) forms of Brahman. This under-
standing was modified by the influence
of later devotional trends, in which ideas
of the highest Brahman became identi-
fied with a particular deity, who was
seen as the ultimate source of all things.
Brahmana
General name for the second literary
stratum in the Vedas, the earliest and
most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Although the composition of
these differing parts of the Veda is not
completely linear, the Brahmanas gen-
erally come after the hymns of praise to
the gods known as samhitas and pre-
cede the speculative texts known as the
Aranyakas and the Upanishads. In the-
ory, each Veda has a Brahmana as an
appendix, which is intended to give fur-
ther explanation of the Vedic rituals.
Although the Yajur Veda is the only one
for which this is actually true, this
understanding gives the Brahmanas
the authority of revealed scripture
(shruti) and thus makes them unques-
tionable. There are several different
Brahmanas, of which the most impor-
tant are the Aiteraya Brahmana and
the Shatapatha Brahmana; the latter’s
tone and contents (including the Isha
Upanishad) clearly mark it as the most
recent of the Brahmanas.
The Brahmanas are primarily ritual
manuals, and they give exacting,
painstaking instructions for performing
these Vedic rituals. These texts indicate a
fundamental shift in religious practice,
from the earlier emphasis on sacrifice
as a means of invoking and pleasing the
Vedic gods to an importance on the
power of ritual itself. This new emphasis
makes the sacrificial priests the most
powerful people of all, since even the
gods themselves are subject to the ritu-
als. The power of correctly performed
ritual paves the way for the Aranyakas
and the Upanishads, which asks more
speculative questions about the rituals
themselves. At times these differing
religious genres are juxtaposed—as in
the Shatapatha Brahmana, in which the
Isha Upanishad is embedded. Such jux-
tapositions indicate that although the
stress varied in differing types of texts,
there was some overlap during the time
they were composed.
Brahmanda

Brahmarandhra
(“aperture of Brahman”) In traditional
mystical physiology, an opening in the
crown of the head—perhaps corre-
sponding to the fontanel in young chil-
dren. Although this hole usually closes
up, it is widely believed that if at the time
of death the departing soul can be chan-
neled through this aperture, it will bring
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
The earliest mention of this idea can be
found in Katha Upanishad 6.16, and
exercises to facilitate this practice are
stressed in certain varieties of yoga. The
desire to open this aperture is the reason
behind one of the actions sometimes
performed during cremation. In many
cases the pyre’s heat will itself split the
skull, but when it does not, a long pole is
used to break it open in an effort to
release the soul.
Brahma Sampraday
One of the four branches of the Bairagi
Naga class of ascetics. The Bairagi Nagas
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, organized in military fashion
into different anis, or “armies.” Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century,
their primary occupation was as merce-
nary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these occupations have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times. The
Brahma Sampraday traces its immedi-
ate spiritual lineage through the
Gaudiya Vaishnava sect, founded by the
Bengali devotee Chaitanya, but claims
ultimate descent from the southern
Indian philosopher Madhva. This latter
[[123]]
Brahmasutra Bhashya
claim seems highly suspect, in part
because the guardian deities of the two
sects are different; Chaitanya and his
followers worship the gods Krishna and
Radha, whereas Madhva and his follow-
ers worship Lakshmi-Narayan. There
are also differences in their observances.
Although the Madhva ascetics have a
long history in southern India, they have
virtually no presence in the north, where
the Chaitanyite ascetics are well repre-
sented. Ghurye speculates that this
claim is based on the desire of the
Gaudiya Vaishnavas to establish ties to
an ancient lineage; this would give them
an unassailable identity and thus a place
in the bathing (snana) procession at
religious festival Kumbha Mela. See
G. S. Ghurye, Indian Sadhus, 1964.
Brahmasutra Bhashya
A commentary (bhashya) written by the
philosopher
Shankaracharya
on
Badarayana’s Brahma Sutras, a collec-
tion of 555 brief aphorisms (sutras) that
form the basis for the philosophical
school known as Vedanta. This com-
mentary is the defining text for the
Advaita Vedanta school of Indian phi-
losophy. Shankaracharya begins his
investigation by establishing the Self as
the basis of all knowledge, since the one
thing that can never be doubted is the
reality of the one who knows. He identi-
fies this knowing consciousness as the
eternal Self, or atman, which never
changes over time despite the vicissi-
tudes of the physical bodies it inhabits.
According to Shankaracharya, the per-
ceivable world is clearly subject to
change and thus is not the Absolute
Reality, which the philosopher identi-
fies as the unqualified, unchanging
Brahman. Following the Upanishads,
Shankaracharya identifies atman as
identical to Brahman. He states that for
human beings the reason for both
unhappiness and the bondage of the
soul is the ignorance of this relationship,
which causes one to mistake this per-
ceivable reality for the Ultimate Reality.
With the destruction of this mistaken
[[124]]

understanding, all bonds are broken,
and the person attains final liberation.
Brahma Sutras
Variant name for Badarayana’s Vedanta
Sutras, which date from the third to the
fifth century B.C.E. This collection of 555
brief aphorisms (sutras) is the basis for
the philosophical school known as
Vedanta, so named because it claims to
reveal the ultimate meaning of the reli-
gious scriptures known as the Vedas.
They are given the name Brahma Sutras
because they attempt to summarize and
systematize the philosophic and reli-
gious ideas in the speculative texts
known as the Upanishads, particularly
the ideas about the Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman. The sutras are so
brief that they presuppose commentary,
of which the most famous is the
Brahmasutra Bhashya, written by the
philosopher Shankaracharya.
Brahmayajna
(“sacrifice to Brahman”) One of the five
great sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the texts on religious duty
(Dharma Shastras). These five great
sacrifices are prescribed daily religious
observances for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder who has
been born into one of three groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya. Such men are eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” Each of the five sacri-
fices (yajna) is directed toward a differ-
ent class of beings, from the Ultimate
Reality down to animals, and is satisfied
by different actions. The brahmayajna is
directed toward the Ultimate Reality
(Brahman) and is satisfied by teaching
and studying the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts. In the time since
the Dharma Shastras were composed,
Hindu life has undergone significant
change, but many brahmins still study
the Veda—if not daily, at some point in
their youth.Brahmo Samaj
Brahmi
The most commonly used script in the
inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka (r.
[[269]]
–232 B.C.E.), the greatest figure in the
Maurya dynasty. Ashoka’s empire
encompassed all of the subcontinent
except the deepest parts of southern
India and went west into modern
Afghanistan. Brahmi script was used in
all regions of the Mauryan empire
except in the northwest, where the
Kharoshthi script was used. Ashoka’s
rock edicts and pillar edicts are the ear-
liest significant Indian written docu-
ments and give invaluable information
about contemporary social, political,
and religious life. Brahmi is the ancestor
of the modern Indian scripts, including
Devanagari. It is also the ultimate
source for all indigenous southeast
Asian alphabets, which developed from
trade with southern India in the early
medieval period. Over the course
of time, Brahmi was replaced by
later scripts, was forgotten, and
became unreadable. Although Ashoka’s
inscriptions ensured that Europeans
were aware of Brahmi, their content was
a mystery until 1837, when James
Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi
alphabet by working backward from
later, known scripts.
Brahmin
In the traditional Hindu theory of the
four major social groups (varnas), the
brahmins are the group with the high-
est status, based on the belief that they
are purer than all others. This belief is
based on the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta, in which the brah-
mins are created from the Primeval
Man’s mouth. The mouth is part of the
head and thus the highest part of the
body, and it is also associated with
speech, one of the definitively human
faculties. From the earliest Hindu
recorded history, brahmins have been
associated with speech and the sacred
word; they were the scholars, priests, rit-
ual technicians, and protectors of sacred
learning. This is still true in modern
times, although there are also many
brahmins who have other occupa-
tions, such as trade, business, and
government service.
Aside from their traditional associa-
tion with sacred learning, their other
source of social status is their ritual
purity, which is believed to be greater
than that of all other human beings. This
ritual purity is inherent, conferred by
birth. According to tradition, even an
uneducated brahmin should be consid-
ered a “god on earth,” whereas a learned
brahmin is more sacred still. This ritual
purity makes brahmins preferable for
service to many of the gods of the Hindu
pantheon, since they are considered
the best intermediaries to “insulate”
the deities from ordinary people.
Although brahmins as a whole have the
highest status, within the brahmin com-
munity there are highly defined sub-
groups (jatis), which are often defined
by region of origin.
Brahmo Samaj
The earliest of the Hindu reform groups,
founded in Calcutta in the early nine-
teenth century by Ram Mohan Roy
(1774–1833). His purpose was to purge
contemporary Hinduism of its “corrupt”
practices, such as sati (widow burning),
the ban on widow remarriage, image
worship, and caste. In his effort to find a
traditional authority for such reforms,
he chose the Upanishads as his key reli-
gious texts. After his death the move-
ment was eventually headed by
Debendranath Tagore (father of the
Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore)
and later by Keshub Chander Sen; dis-
agreements over ritual matters split the
movement under both leaders. By the
late 1800s the Samaj’s influence had
largely passed, although in an interest-
ing twist, it became the vehicle through
which the mystic Ramakrishna met
many of his disciples.
The Brahmo Samaj’s social program
reflected and responded to contempo-
rary European critiques of popular
Hinduism, some levied by Christian
[[125]]
Braj
missionaries and others based on
the rationalist emphasis of the
Enlightenment. The Brahmo Samaj’s
openness put it at the forefront of legal
reform—in particular, influencing the
[[1829]]
 law banning sati. But at the same
time, its members were mostly
Westernized urban intellectuals, far
removed from the life and religious
concerns of Hindus. For further
information see Spencer Lavan, “The
Brahmo Samaj: India’s First Movement
for Religious Reform,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Braj
Northern Indian region on the Yamuna
River, south of the modern city of Delhi.
According to Hindu tradition, Braj is the
land where the god Krishna lived during
his time on earth. The Braj region does
not have clearly defined boundaries,
and the name has never referred to an
official administrative area. Instead it
has been defined by popular piety.
Krishna’s devotees (bhakta) place great
emphasis on visualizing his exploits as a
way to attain communion with him, and
thus places throughout the Braj region
are associated with very specific inci-
dents in Krishna’s life. As it now stands,
the southern and eastern borders of the
region are just over five miles southeast
of the city of Mathura, and its northern
and western boundaries are nearly five
times that distance. For extensive infor-
mation on Braj and its culture, see A. W.
Entwistle, Braj, 1987.
Braj Bhasha
The “language of Braj”; a dialect of
medieval Hindi primarily spoken in the
Braj region, south of the modern city of
Delhi. Braj is the land associated with
the god Krishna, and the devotion that
flourished there between the fifteenth
and eighteenth centuries made Braj
Bhasha a major literary language. Aside
from being the language of Krishna wor-
shipers, it also functioned as a lingua
franca—a common language used by
[[126]]

diverse peoples—for religious devotees
(bhakta) in a much larger area of northern
India, although it varied at the borders.
Brhadaranyaka (“Great Forest
Book”) Upanishad
By general consensus, the oldest of the
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the most recent stratum
of the Vedas. The Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad’s chronological priority is
supported by at least four pieces of evi-
dence: its length, its lack of organiza-
tion, its archaic language, and its
relationship to earlier Vedic texts. The
opening passage gives an extended
comparison between the world and the
sacrificial horse, showing clear parallels
with the earlier Brahmana literature.
Moreover, by its very name (“great forest
book”), the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad
clearly points to a transition from the
Aranyaka (“forest books”) literature,
which followed Brahmana literature.
This upanishad first addresses many of
the questions raised in later texts and is
therefore an important source for the
development of the tradition. Unlike
most of the later Upanishads, it is writ-
ten in prose rather than poetry, with the
instruction often in the form of dialogue
between various speakers.
Brhadeshvar
Temple built in the southern Indian city
of Tanjore around the year 1000 B.C.E. by
the Chola king Raja Raja (r. 985–1014).
The temple is dedicated to the god Shiva
in his form as Brhadeshvar (the “great
lord”). It was built in the Dravida style
characteristic of southern Indian tem-
ples, in which the buildings are of mod-
est height but cover an immense area
and are surrounded by a boundary wall
with massive towers (gopurams) over
each wall’s central gateway. The
Brhadeshvar temple is famous as a cen-
ter for traditional arts and culture, par-
ticularly as a home for the dance style
known as Bharatanatyam. It also con-
tains some exceptional murals, anBronzes
extremely unusual feature in Indian
temples. See also Chola dynasty.
Brhannala
This was the identity assumed by
Arjuna, one of the five Pandava princes,
during the year they lived incognito
after twelve years of forest exile. The
Pandavas are the heroes of the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, which details the struggle
for power between the Pandavas and
their cousins the Kauravas. At one point
in their struggle, Arjuna’s older brother,
Yudhishthira, has lost all the brothers’
freedom and possessions to the Kauravas
in a game of dice. As a penalty for this
loss, the Pandavas have to go into exile
for twelve years and spend the thirteenth
year back in society, unrecognized. It is
understood that if the brothers are dis-
covered during that year, they will be
banished again. Arjuna, the epic’s most
heroic warrior, disguises himself as a
eunuch named Brhannala, knowing that
no one will suspect him in such guise. He
spends the year living in the women’s
quarters of the palace, singing and danc-
ing as a eunuch. At the end of the year,
still in his eunuch’s garb, Arjuna takes
part in a great battle in which he defeats
the troops of the Kauravas.
This form of marriage is considered
aprashasta (“reprehensible”) because of
the implication of selling one’s children.
Even though it does take place in mod-
ern India, communities practicing this
form have very low social status. In
modern times, giving brideprice is an
admission that the bride’s family
deserves compensation for the loss of a
wage earner, implying that her labor is
necessary for the family. In contrast, the
higher-status type of marriage, the
Brahma marriage, transfers both the
bride and wealth (in the form of a
dowry) to the groom’s family with the
understanding that both families have
enough money that her paid labor
is unnecessary.
Brindavan
In Hindu mythology, Brhaspati is a sage
chosen by the deities (devas) as their
guru, or spiritual teacher. Brhaspati is
also one of the names used to designate
the planet Jupiter, since in Hindu astrol-
ogy this planet is the most significant,
and thus the symbolic “guru” among
the planets.(“tulsi forest”) Small town in the
Mathura district of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, which is the town in which the
god Krishna is supposed to have lived
during his childhood. Although every
place in Brindavan is associated with the
life of Krishna and is full of temples ded-
icated to him, one particularly important
place is the Chir Ghat, at which Krishna
stole the gopis’ clothes as they were
bathing (snana) in the Yamuna River.
(The gopis were female cowherds who
were companions to Krishna during his
youth.) An interesting architectural site
is the Gobind Deo Mandir, built in 1590,
which has a vaulted ceiling. This latter
temple is also notable for its lack of exte-
rior ornamentation, perhaps to avoid
antagonizing the nearby Moghuls. For a
description of the sacred life in
Brindavan, see John Stratton Hawley, At
Play with Krishna, 1981. See also
Moghul dynasty.
BridepriceBronzes
Brhaspati
The money the groom’s family gives to
the bride’s family as a condition for mar-
riage. This exchange of money for the
bride is the defining feature of the asura
marriage, one of eight recognized forms
of marriage in the Dharma Shastras, the
treatises on religious duty (dharma).
For most of Indian history, stone has
been the preferred medium for creating
images of the Hindu deities for worship.
One of the significant exceptions to this
trend can be found in southern India,
primarily under the Chola dynasty
[[127]]
Buddha Avatar
Depiction of the god Vishnu’s Buddha avatar.
Some Hindus claim that the Buddha was
actually an incarnation of Vishnu.
(9th–14th c.), in which another impor-
tant medium was bronze. The images
were made using lost wax casting,
which allows for great detail. They were
cast in bronze with a high copper con-
tent, which tended to give them a green-
ish tinge as the metal oxidized. Some of
the images are only a few inches high,
albeit with exquisite detail, whereas the
largest are over four feet tall and even
today are the primary images worshiped
in temples. These images were subject
to the same established rules of con-
struction (shilpa shastra) as stone
sculptures. Despite this strict form,
many of the bronzes are masterful works
of art with a presence rarely found in the
stone sculptures. Although images were
made of all of the deities in the pan-
theon, among the best known bronzes
are figures of the god Shiva as Nataraja,
“the Lord of the Dance.”
Buddha Avatar
The ninth avatar, or “incarnation,” of
the god Vishnu. As the only attested his-
torical figure (and one who clearly dif-
fered with the Hindu orthodoxy of his
time), the Buddha avatar shows how the
avatar doctrine was used to envelop and
assimilate existing religious figures.
Although this designation as an avatar
was an attempt to appropriate a signifi-
cant religious figure by projecting him as
an incarnation of Vishnu, this attempt’s
[[128]]

transparency can be seen in the differ-
ing opinions over this avatar. In the
opening chapter of his Gitagovinda, the
poet Jayadeva claims that Vishnu incar-
nated as the Buddha to condemn the
animal sacrifices prevalent in Vedic
times. Other accounts portray him as
misleading the wicked by instructing
them to deny the authority of the Vedas
(which the historical Buddha explicitly
denied) and drive themselves into
hell. Despite being named as one of
the avatars, the Buddha was never
worshiped
by
Vaishnavas,
and
Buddhists themselves have certainly
never accepted this assertion.
Buddha Purnima
The full moon in the lunar month of
Baisakh
(April–May).
Buddhists
throughout the world celebrate this full
moon as the anniversary of the Buddha’s
birth, enlightenment, and death.
Although many Hindus respect the
Buddha as a sage and religious teacher,
he is not central to Hindu religion.
Therefore, this is not a major festival,
although this particular full moon is still
named for him. More recently, the day of
this full moon has been described as the
best day of the year for bathing (snana)
in sacred rivers, a practice that the
Buddha
would
certainly
have
denounced. Given the auspiciousness
connected with every full moon, this
may be an effort to “take back” the day
as a Hindu holiday by emphasizing a
distinctively Hindu practice.
Buddhi
This word refers to the mental faculty
often translated as “intellect,” but it car-
ries connotations beyond mere knowl-
edge. The buddhi is the intellectual
capability for awareness, mental per-
ception, and decision-making, and as
such it is the basis for all cognitive
thought. In the account of evolution
found in the Samkhya philosophical
school, buddhi is one stage in the evolu-
tion of the human personality and the
external world. In the Samkhya account,Busti
buddhi is the first faculty to emerge
from prakrti, or “primal matter,” and is
also known by the name mahat (the
“great one”). The mental processes facil-
itated by buddhi spur the development
of the next stage of evolution, ahamkar,
or “subjective consciousness.” In more
colloquial language, buddhi describes
the overall quality of a person’s mind,
whether it is wholesome or unwhole-
some, sound or unsound.
Bull
Although the cow is the Hindu symbol
for motherhood, with all of the
emotional baggage that accompanies it,
the associations connected with bulls are
not nearly so important. In a religious
context, the bull is associated with the
god Shiva because his animal vehicle is
the bull Nandi, who can invariably be
found guarding the door at Shiva’s
temples. In pre-modern times, of course,
adult bulls were a relatively small
percentage of the total cattle population,
since most young bulls were routinely
castrated to become the oxen that were
essential agricultural work animals.
Bundi
City and district in the southeastern part
of the state Rajasthan, about 100 miles
south of the state capital, Jaipur. Before
[[1947]]
, when India gained independence,
Bundi was a small kingdom. In the late
seventeenth century, Bundi became a
center for the Rajasthani style of minia-
ture painting, perhaps by attracting
artists from the Moghul court who were
seeking outside patronage. Aside from
the portraits and court groups character-
izing this genre under the Moghuls,
Rajasthani miniature painters portrayed
Hindu religious themes, particularly inci-
dents in the life of the god Krishna.
Whereas some styles have flat, mono-
chromatic backgrounds, the Bundi style
shows an intense focus on nature, such
as detailed depiction of the trees (usually
banana trees) surrounding the subjects,
in addition to flowers, birds, and lotus-
filled ponds. For further information see

Burial
Although cremation is the most com-
mon means by which Hindus dispose of
corpses, occasionally bodies are buried.
One such case is with the bodies of very
young children, as if it is recognized that
they never developed into real individu-
als. The only other people usually buried
are ascetics, for which there are varying
interpretations. One idea is that they are
not actually dead but in a state of deep
meditation (samadhi). In such cases the
ascetic is often buried in a sitting posture
because he is considered still present.
Another reason for burying ascetics may
reflect the general assumption that
renouncing the world had made them
“dead” to it, making further ceremonies
unnecessary. Indeed, one part of some
ascetic initiations is to perform one’s
own funeral rites. Burial is often reserved
for ascetics with disciples who will keep
their graves as shrines. Those who are not
buried are usually weighted down with
rocks and thrown into bodies of water.
Busti
(“settlement”) In its literal meaning, any-
where people live—a settlement, village,
or community. In modern usage it has
come to denote an illegal settlement,
such as one built by squatters who have
put up dwellings on vacant land using
whatever materials are available, from
brick to cardboard to plastic. At first, such
settlements have no civic amenities such
as water, power, roads, or sewers, and in
most cases the living conditions are
abysmal. In many cases such “slums”
become people’s hereditary homes, par-
ticularly in Bombay, where real estate is
exorbitantly expensive. These residents
have usually gained access to electricity
and water, typically via illegal hookups.
In rarer cases squatters have gained title
to the land through exerting political
pressure, after which conditions have
generally improved.
