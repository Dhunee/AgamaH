Iconic Image
A pictorial or representational likeness
of a deity, such as a statue or picture.
This is in contrast with an aniconic
image, in which there is no such repre-
sentational image, and the connection
between image and deity is symbolic.
Ida Nadi
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conceptions of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to reside
on a different plane of existence than
the actual body, but with certain corre-
spondences to it. It is visualized as a set
of six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are found Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini.
The ida nadi is the vertical channel
on the left side of the body. As with
the rest of the subtle body, the ida nadi
has certain symbolic correspondences;
in particular, it is identified with the
moon and is thus visualized as being
light in color.
Ikshvaku
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Ikshvaku was a
king who was the founder of the Solar
Line. The Solar Line is one of the two
great Indian mythic lineages in ancient
India, along with the Lunar Line; the
most illustrious members of the Solar
Line were the god-king Rama and his
brothers. Ikshvaku is the grandson of
Vivasvan (Surya), the sun, and thus he
and his offspring are descendants of
the sun.
Ilangovadigal
Poet traditionally named as the author
of the Tamil epic poem Shilappadigaram
(“The Jeweled Anklet”). The poem high-
lights several themes important to
Hindu culture, particularly the need for
kings to be righteous in their judgments,
and the power gained by a wife through
devotion to her husband.
The main characters in the poem are
a young couple, Kannaki and Kovalan.
When Kovalan is executed because of a
tragic misunderstanding, his wife
Kannaki pronounces a curse on the city
of Madurai, which causes many of
the citizens to die before Kannaki
retracts it at the behest of Madurai’s
patron goddess.
Ilangovadigal is believed to have
lived in the first or second century C.E., a
date that makes his authorship improb-
able, since the poem was probably writ-
ten several centuries later.
Impalement
One of the favored means of execution
that seems to have been particularly
prevalent in ancient southern India. To
impale someone is to kill them by pierc-
ing them with a sharp stake.
The most stunning instance is
reported to have taken place in the city
of Madurai, where 8,000 Jain ascetics
were impaled by one of the kings in the
Pandya dynasty, after the latter had
renounced Jainism to become a Shaiva,
that is, a devotee (bhakta) of Shiva. A
tradition persists that the ultimate
responsibility for this can be traced to
the Nayanar saint Sambandar, who had
converted the king and whose surviving
poetry shows a deep animus for the
Jains. If this report is true, it also indi-
cates one of the rare cases of religious
persecution in Hindu India, which on
the whole has been remarkably tolerant
of differing ways of religious life.
[[293]]
Impurity
Depictions of this mass impalement can
be seen in murals painted at the
Minakshi temple in Madurai—whose
construction far postdates the alleged
event—as well as in popular art of differ-
ent kinds.
Impurity
See ashaucha.
Inauspiciousness
This concept refers to events or condi-
tions that in their very essence hinder or
are inimical to life, prosperity, and gen-
eral well-being. Along with purity and
impurity (ashaucha), auspiciousness
and inauspiciousness are fundamental
categories in Hindu life.
Inauspicious conditions can be
caused by a variety of factors. At times
the inauspiciousness lies in the very
moment itself—in an hour or day con-
sidered to be unlucky, in unusual
events such as eclipses, or in astrologi-
cal conjunctions that are considered
inherently unlucky. In such “danger-
ous” times, one’s activities should be
severely curtailed, except for things that
are absolutely necessary. Certain nor-
mally innocuous activities can become
inauspicious in conjunction with partic-
ular times, and at these times such activ-
ities should be avoided.
Inauspiciousness can also arise from
certain conjunctions in one’s natal
horoscope, or from erecting a home or
building in an inappropriate place. As a
quality, inauspiciousness is conceived of
as a physical entity that is generated
by certain conditions, and which then
attaches to individuals, families, or
larger communities.
Some of these inauspicious condi-
tions can be avoided by refraining
from certain activities at certain times,
yet there are certain conditions that
cannot be avoided—in particular, the
inauspiciousness arising from eclipses
or other astrological conjunctions.
Whereas impurity (ashaucha) can
be removed or destroyed through
[[294]]

purification, inauspiciousness can only
be transferred from one person to
another, most often through the medi-
um of gifts (dana). For more informa-
tion see Gloria Goodwin Raheja, The
Poison in the Gift, 1988; and David F.
Pocock, “The Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan
(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Independence Day
Indian national holiday celebrated on
August 15—one of the few holidays cele-
brated according to the solar calendar—
which marks the date in 1947 on
which India gained independence from
Great Britain.
Indigenous Aryan Theory
The theory that the Aryans were indige-
nous to the Indian subcontinent, rather
than immigrants from other lands. The
word Arya (“noble”) is the name used for
themselves by the people who com-
posed the Vedas, the earliest Hindu reli-
gious texts.
Nineteenth-century European schol-
arship discovered structural relation-
ships between Sanskrit and classical
European languages and speculated
that all these languages came from a
common parent. Based on further
analysis, these researchers hypothesized
that people speaking this parent lan-
guage originated in central Asia, some-
where near the Caspian Sea. From there,
some went west to Europe, some went
southwest to Turkey, and some went
south toward Iran, and later to India.
The conclusion that these Indian pil-
grims came from Iran is based on com-
parisons between the Avesta and the
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious
texts. These texts show broad linguistic
similarities, and thus indicate that the
people speaking the languages were
closely related. This entire theory is thus
based solely on the observed similarities
between languages, and assumptions
about how it changed.
Indigenous Aryan theory supporters
reject this claim and maintain that theIndra
Aryans are the original inhabitants of
India, and as proof point to the artifacts
found in the Indus Valley civilization,
an ancient urban network in northeast-
ern India. Both of these claims are highly
tenuous and do not address the philo-
logical evidence behind the original
Aryan theory. The Indigenous Aryan
theory has political implications that
have helped to spur its growth. Some
supporters are reacting against the
Aryan migration theory’s perceived
colonialist bias, since the theory was
developed by Europeans and assumes
that the dominant groups in modern
India must have come from outside.
Other supporters of this theory are the
proponents of Hindutva, who claim
that all Indians are “really” Hindus, and
thus one social group, whatever their
particular religious beliefs. This asser-
tion has profound political implica-
tions in modern India, where Christians
and Muslims are not only religious com-
munities, but social and political ones.
By connecting Hindu identity and good
Indian citizenship, Hindutva propo-
nents are marginalizing Christians and
Muslims as outsiders.
Indira Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). As with all the
eleventh-day observances, this is dedi-
cated to the worship of Vishnu, on this
day in his form as the Shalagram. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise specific
benefits. This ekadashi falls during the
pitrpaksha, the fortnight dedicated to
the ancestors, and faithfully observing
this festival day is believed to result in
the rescue of millions of one’s forebears
from woeful incarnations and bring
them rebirth in heaven. The name
“Indira” is an epithet of Lakshmi,
Vishnu’s wife.
Depiction of the god Indra, king of heaven and
one of the eight guardians of the earth.
Indra
One of the oldest and most powerful
Hindu deities. His status has changed
over the years and this evolution shows
how Hinduism has transformed.
In the earliest Hindu scriptures, the
hymns in Rg Veda, Indra is the Vedic deity
par excellence. As with most Vedic deities,
Indra is associated with certain natural
phenomena, in this case the power of the
storm; he was seen as inhabiting the
region (antariksha) between the earth
and sky, the region where storms take
place. In many ways Indra seems a para-
digm for the virtues and powers cele-
brated in the Vedas, and (as many have
inferred) celebrated as virtues by the
Aryans themselves. Indra is the invincible
warrior and the performer of great deeds.
One of the central hymns in the Rg
Veda (1.32) describes Indra’s battle with
the serpent Vrtra, who is finally killed
and cut into pieces, allowing the pent-up
waters that Vrtra has blocked to flow
freely over the land.
Indra is a drinker of the intoxicating
beverage soma, whose influence leads
him to expanded reveries on his own
greatness; he is the ultimate man’s man
in a culture that is usually believed to
have stressed manly virtues. Of the 1,028
hymns in the Rg Veda, nearly a quarter
are devoted to Indra, who is described as
the power encircling the earth.
[[295]]
Indradyumna
Some of Indra’s attributes and func-
tions remain constant as the Hindu tra-
dition changed and developed. In later
Hindu mythology, Indra’s realm is still
the atmospheric region between the
earth and sky, and he is still considered
the god of the storm, the bestower of
rain, and the wielder of the divine thun-
derbolt. Indra is also one of the eight
Guardians of the Directions, holding
sway over the eastern quarter.
Yet some things about Indra changed
around the first millennium; most
importantly, Indra has been “demoted”
to being merely the ruler of the heaven-
ly realms and the king of the gods. Far
from being the supreme, unchallenged
power in the universe, his position is
much more precarious, for he is seen as
affected by the workings of karma.
Indra is actually subject to replacement
when he is spiritually exhausted or
when a challenger on earth grows spir-
itually strong enough to unseat him.
Many of the stories in the classical
Sanskrit texts have their plot advanced
by Indra’s throne becoming hot (a sign
that a human being is gaining the
power to replace Indra), and with Indra
taking some action to counter this
threat. In cases where the challenger is
a celibate ascetic, whose source of
power is the power of renunciation,
Indra usually dispatches an apsara
(divine nymph) whose heavenly
charms can seduce the ascetic and by
destroying his celibacy destroy his
power as well. In other cases the threat
can come from people completing one
hundred great sacrifices; here Indra
somehow forestalls the hundredth sac-
rifice, as he does by stealing the sacred
horse of King Sagar. Indra is the lord
and ruler of the gods, but his position
can only be retained by keeping a sharp
eye on all possible threats.
This loss of “divine” position is seen
by the way Indra is portrayed in certain
mythic tales. In the story of Ahalya he is
portrayed as a lecher and an adulterer,
seducing Ahalya by assuming the form
of her husband, the sage Gautama.
When Gautama discovers what has
[[296]]

happened, he curses Indra to have a
thousand vulvas on his body, although
the curse is later modified to give Indra
a thousand eyes. Indra’s helplessness
before his own lust and his inability
to withstand Gautama’s curse are
sure signs that his divine position
has slipped.
Although he is still regarded as the
bestower of rain and the wielder of the
thunderbolt, another indication of his
diminished power can be seen in his
encounter with the adolescent god
Krishna. When Krishna persuades the
village elders to cease making offerings
to Indra, the latter sends torrential rains
that threaten to destroy the village. In
the face of this threat, Krishna calmly
lifts Mount Govardhan, and for seven
days and nights holds it over their heads
to block the rain. Although Indra
expends all his strength, he is unable to
prevail against the adolescent Krishna,
clearly demonstrating where the real
divinity lies.
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Indra is revealed
to be the divine father of Arjuna, one of
the five Pandava brothers who are the
epic’s protagonists. Arjuna shares his
father’s strengths and weaknesses; he is
heroic and gallant, the archetypal war-
rior who relishes the clash of battle and
is unceasing in defense of his personal
and family honor. He can also be selfish,
egocentric, and boorish, and has many
extramarital liaisons, some of which
produce offspring. Both are wonderful
warriors, if that is what is needed at
the time, but they lack other qualities
to make them productive in times
of peace. This story of Indra and Arjuna
is further evidence that Indra has
fallen from the most important deity
to a minor one who is not an object
of worship.
Indradyumna
In Hindu mythology, a righteous king
who is a great devotee (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu. He has been cursed to
become a giant elephant by the sageIndus
Agastya, who becomes angry when the
king, deep in meditation, fails to greet
the sage with proper respect. After much
pleading, Agastya decrees that the curse
will be broken when Vishnu touches the
elephant on the back. As a result of this
curse, Indradyumna roams the earth as
an elephant for many years.
On one occasion when he is drink-
ing at a lake, his hind leg is seized by a
giant crocodile. The crocodile is actual-
ly a gandharva or celestial musician
named Huhu, whom another sage had
cursed to become a crocodile. Their
struggle lasts for a thousand years, with
the elephant unable to get free, and the
crocodile unable to overpower the ele-
phant. Finally Vishnu himself appears,
kills the crocodile, and restores
Indradyumna to his previous form. The
release of Indradyumna from both the
curse and the crocodile is known as
Gajendramoksha, the “release of the
elephant king.”
Indrajit
(“Conqueror of Indra”) In the Ramayana,
the earlier of the two great Indian epics,
Indrajit is the son of the demon-king
Ravana by his wife Mandodari. In some
later versions of the Ramayana, he is
portrayed as the son of the god Shiva
himself, born after his mother had mar-
ried Ravana. Like his father, Indrajit is a
great devotee (bhakta) of Shiva, and
because of his devotion Shiva teaches
Indrajit how to make himself invisible.
For a warrior, this power is obviously
very valuable, and through it Indrajit is
able to conquer Indra’s heavenly realm
and take Indra as a prisoner back to
Lanka, hence his name.
The god Brahma goes to Lanka, the
kingdom of Ravana, to arrange for Indra’s
release, in return for which Indrajit
demands physical immortality. When he
is told that this is impossible, Indrajit
requests a different power—that when he
performs a certain sacrifice he will
receive horses and a chariot so that he can
kill whatever enemy he faces, and while in
the chariot he cannot be killed.
When the god-king Rama and allies
are storming Lanka, in an effort to
regain Rama’s kidnapped wife Sita,
Indrajit begins to perform this sacrifice.
Warned about this danger by Brahma,
Rama sends his brother Lakshmana to
interrupt it. Lakshmana successfully
disrupts the sacrifice, and in the ensuing
battle kills Indrajit.
Indrani
(Feminine form of Indra) The wife of
the god Indra, the ruler of heaven.
Perhaps reflecting Indra’s diminished
status in later Hindu mythology, Indrani
is not a prominent figure. Her only
important role is as an object of desire
in the story of Nahusha, who through
his meritorious deeds has displaced
Indra as the king of heaven. Nahusha
assumes that he is entitled to Indrani as
well as Indra’s throne, and makes
advances toward her. For his hubris, the
sage Agastya curses Nahusha to be
reborn as a giant serpent.
Indraprastha
The name given to the earliest of the
cities built on the site now occupied
by modern Delhi; Indraprastha was
built on the banks of the Yamuna
River, in the southeastern part of
modern Delhi.
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Indraprastha is
named as the capital of the Pandavas,
the five brothers who are the epic’s pro-
tagonists. According to the epic, the
city is built after their uncle, King
Dhrtarashtra, has divided his kingdom
between the Pandavas and his own
sons, the Kauravas.
Although the epic is replete with
descriptions of Indraprastha, there is
little hard connection between the
archeological site and events described
in the epic.
Indus
River whose source lies in the high
Himalayas, but which flows through
[[297]]
Indus Valley Art
Pakistan for most of its length. The
Indus is traditionally considered one of
the seven sacred rivers of India—the
others are the Ganges, Yamuna,
Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, and
Cauvery—although in modern times
this has diminished, especially since the
creation of Pakistan in 1947 rendered it
inaccessible to most Hindus.
Despite its diminished religious sig-
nificance, the Indus remains important
from a historical perspective, since
many archeological sites from the Indus
Valley civilization have been discovered
on its banks.
Indus Valley Art
Despite the plethora of artifacts that
have been recovered from the cities of
the Indus Valley civilization, objects
that could be interpreted as works of
art are surprisingly sparse. No traces of
decoration have been found inside or
outside the buildings, nor has any mon-
umental architecture been discovered.
The art objects that have been found
in Harappa, a city on the Ravi River in
Pakistan, have all been on a smaller
scale: several stone statues of male tor-
sos, the head and torso of a bearded
man, a copper statue of a young woman
naked except for bangles and jewelry
(said to be a “dancer,” because her arms
and legs are lifted), statues of women
with elaborate headdresses believed to
be icons for a Mother Goddess cult, and
the images of plants, animals, and
humans carved on the Indus Valley
Seals. The latter show delicate and quite
realistic work, indicating a great deal of
skill in working the stone, as well as the
ability to make realistic figural images.
Indus Valley Civilization
(3000–2000 B.C.E.) An ancient and highly
developed urban culture, so named
because the first two sites discovered,
Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, both lie
on the Indus River in what is now
Pakistan. Further searching has
uncovered other sites along much of the
[[298]]

Indus, as well as a web of settlements
stretching east to the upper Ganges
basin, south through the modern state
of
Gujarat
and
into
modern
Maharashtra, and along the coast of
modern Pakistan. The greatest concen-
tration of these settlements has been
found along the banks of the Ghaggar
River, a small and seasonal watercourse
that runs through the state of
Rajasthan. Some historians claim that it
is the bed of the ancient Saraswati
River. Evidence from the sites seems to
indicate that the sites further to the
south developed later, but remained
vital after the cities in the Indus River
Valley, particularly Harappa and
Mohenjo-Daro, had fallen into oblivion.
The discovery of these sites in the early
twentieth century prompted significant
historical revision, since before then it
had been generally assumed that the
people known as the Aryans were the
earliest developed culture in India.
The most striking feature of these
cities is their uniformity—their general
city plan was nearly identical from place
to place (although they differed in
scale), the bricks used throughout all the
cities were exactly the same size, and
there was a standardized set of weights
and measures. Each of the cities also
had a large central granary, which stored
the grain necessary to feed such a siz-
able urban population. Such evident
uniformity over such long distances
bears clear witness to a strong and
centralized government, which some
analysts have speculated was religious
in nature.
Another striking feature of all the
cities was an advanced sanitation sys-
tem. All the houses had channels for
water, and an elaborate network of
drains and sewers ran throughout the
city, even in those sections where the
houses were the smallest, and people
presumably the poorest. Mohenjo-Daro
also has a great tank built of brick and
sealed with pitch, which the archaeolo-
gists have dubbed the “Great Bath.” Why
were the people who built these cities so
concerned with sanitation and bathing?Indus Valley Civilization
Ruins in Mohenjo-Daro. These structures are some of the earliest discovered evidence of the
Indus Valley civilization, a society believed to have emerged around 3000 B.C.E.
Some experts believe this reflected reli-
gious concern for ritual purity, rather
than hygiene.
Many of the artifacts from these
cities are remarkably well preserved,
and give us a fairly comprehensive pic-
ture of their material culture: what they
ate (wheat and barley were the primary
food grains), what they wore (cotton),
which animals they had domesticated
(cattle, fowl, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys,
and dogs), and the implements of every-
day life.
Archeological excavations have also
found more than 2,000 small seals,
which are assumed to have served as the
insignia for mercantile families. Many of
the seals bear writing, although it has
never been deciphered, as well as realis-
tic pictures of animals and human
beings. Three of the seals display a
horned figure sitting with his upper legs
splayed and his heels touching one
another. Some viewers have cited the
figure on these seals as proof that the
Indus Valley culture is the ultimate
source for the god Shiva, a figure who
does not appear in the Vedas, the earli-
est Hindu religious texts, but who later
becomes one of the primary Hindu
deities. In the same way, recovery of sev-
eral statues of women with grossly exag-
gerated female characteristics—breasts,
buttocks, and genitalia—have prompted
others to claim that this culture was the
source for the later Hindu cult of the
Mother Goddess.
One of the controversies connected
with the Indus Valley culture is what
people were living there and whether
their descendants still live in India. The
generally accepted theory among Western
scholars describes a period of contact
between the people in these cities and a
[[299]]
Indus Valley Religion
pastoral group of outsiders called the
Aryans. The language of the Aryans,
Sanskrit, shows certain structural rela-
tionships with classical European lan-
guages and even closer connections to
the Avesta, religious texts of ancient
Iran. Based on an analysis of the rela-
tionships between these languages and
the rate at which these languages have
changed, scholars have inferred that all
these languages came from a common
mother language, and that people
speaking this parent language originated
in central Asia, somewhere near the
Caspian Sea. From there, some went
west to Europe, some went southwest to
Turkey, and some went south toward
Iran, and later to India. This entire theory
is thus based almost solely on the
observed similarities between lan-
guages and assumptions about the rate
of linguistic change—some of which are
necessarily arbitrary.
The one piece of material evidence
for this theory comes in the remains of
horses found at the Indus Valley sites.
The horse was an established part of
Aryan life, according to references based
on the Aryan religious texts, the Vedas,
whereas it seems to have been absent
from the Indus Valley cities—it is not
portrayed on any of the carved seals,
which show many other animals, and
the only bones that have been recovered
from the Indus Valley cities are found in
the most recent archeological strata.
This theory describes a period of con-
tact and possible conflict between the
Aryans and Indus Valley peoples, after
which the Aryan culture and religion
became the dominant force in Indian
life. The Indus Valley cities were com-
pletely forgotten until they were exca-
vated in the early twentieth century.
The Aryan migration theory accounts
for the dissemination of various lan-
guages, but is not universally accepted.
Many modern Indians subscribe to the
Indigenous Aryan (IA) theory, which
contends that the Aryans are the original
inhabitants of India, and as proof points
to the artifacts found in the Indus Valley
civilization. Some IA supporters are
[[300]]

reacting against the Aryan migration
theory’s perceived colonialist bias,
since the theory was developed by
Europeans and assumes that the domi-
nant groups in modern India must have
come from outside. Other supporters
are the proponents of Hindutva, who
identify being Hindu with being an
Indian. The IA theory allows Hindutva
proponents to claim that all Indians are
“really” Hindus and thus one social
group, whatever their particular reli-
gious beliefs. This assertion has pro-
found political implications in modern
India, where Christians and Muslims
are not only religious communities,
but social and political ones. By con-
necting Hindu identity and good
Indian citizenship, Hindutva propo-
nents are marginalizing Christians and
Muslims as outsiders.
Such claims are intriguing, but there
is slim evidence for them. The real truth
is that researchers have recovered lots
of material objects, but what these
things mean is open to interpretation.
At the very least, we know that this
culture flourished for about a thousand
years. Its final collapse—because of
a prolonged drought, according to
one theory—took place around 2000
B.C.E. For further information see
Walter Ashlin Fairservis, The Roots of
Ancient India, 1975.
Indus Valley Religion
Although some experts have made
definitive claims about the religion of
the Indus Valley civilization, it must be
remembered that all these claims are
highly speculative, since they are solely
based on the remains from the cities.
Artifacts such as grains, animal bones,
traces of fabric, and building founda-
tions give us a good basis for knowing
about the material life of this culture—
what people ate, what they wore, and
the types of dwellings they lived in.
The notion of religion, however, is far
more abstract. It is thus not only harder
to infer what types of religion were prac-
ticed from the artifacts that have beenIndus Valley Seals
recovered, but these same artifacts can
also be used as evidence for widely dif-
fering conclusions. The objects them-
selves are mute and can be interpreted
in many ways. Still, among these objects
are several artifacts that are intriguing.
Among the artifacts found at sites in
the Indus Valley civilization have been
ceramic female figures with grossly
exaggerated female characteristics—
breasts, buttocks, and genitalia. These
figures strongly resemble the Bronze
Age European image known as the
“Venus of Willendorf,” which has been
associated with the worship of female
fertility and procreative power. Given
these similarities, it seems likely that a
similar cult existed in the Indus Valley
civilization. The statues give no indica-
tion of how widespread this cult was—
whether it was related to fertility cults in
other places or was simply a parallel
development. There is no proof that this
cult was the basis for the later Hindu
worship of the Goddess as the supreme
reality. Any such claims are making
broader inferences from this limited
material evidence—at best, such claims
are highly speculative; at worst, they
are irresponsible and driven by an
underlying agenda.
The other intriguing artifacts from
the Indus Valley civilization have come
from seals, of which several hundred
have been found. Many of the seals have
pictures of animals or objects from
everyday life, but three of the seals from
Harappa bear the image of a horned fig-
ure sitting cross-legged on a small plat-
form. Some viewers have described this
figure as a “Proto-Shiva,” since it has
several features associated with the
Hindu god Shiva—the sitting posture is
associated with the practice of yoga, and
the figure’s horns indicate his form as
Pashupati, the “Lord of Beasts.”
Proponents of this theory point to
the Indus Valley culture for the roots of
Shiva, rightly noting that although Shiva
becomes prominent in later Hinduism,
he is virtually absent from the Vedic
pantheon. Virtually the only place that
Shiva appears is in the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad, one of the latest of the mys-
tical texts known as the Upanishads,
which describes the god Rudra—later
identified with Shiva—as the supreme
power in the universe.
Although it is possible that the wor-
ship of Shiva lies in the Indus Valley cul-
ture, anyone not inclined to believe this
at the outset will be hard-pressed to find
this particular evidence persuasive.
There is also mysterious writing on the
seals, and if and when this writing is
deciphered these relationships may
become clearer. See also Veda.
Indus Valley Seals
The most enigmatic objects from the
Indus Valley civilization are small
square or rectangular-shaped pieces of
soapstone, which are believed to have
been official seals for merchants and
other individuals. Archaeologists have
unearthed more than two thousand of
these seals, which generally combine a
pictorial image with an inscription.
Most of the seal images are common
domestic animals, particularly the bull,
but a few portray mythical beasts such
as a unicorn, or even more intriguing
human figures. One well-known exam-
ple of the latter shows a human figure—
perhaps a mythic hero—strangling a
tiger with each hand. Other figures
include a horned man, in one case
standing in front of a table and in another
sitting in a yoga-like position. He is
sometimes identified as an early form of
the god Shiva and cited as evidence that
this deity’s cult came from the Indus
Valley cities.
Far less is known about the seal
inscriptions, since the writing system
for these inscriptions has never been
deciphered, although many different
theories have been advanced. One rea-
son for the disagreement is the divi-
sion of opinion regarding the Indus
Valley culture itself. Those who believe
that Indus Valley culture preceded the
arrival of the Aryans, and was distinct
from it, tend to look for evidence in
the Dravidian language family, which
[[301]]
Infanticide
is linguistically distinct from the Indo-
Aryan language family. Those who
espouse the Indigenous Aryan view,
which identifies the Indus Valley culture
with that of the Aryans, tend to seek
their evidence in the earliest Sanskrit
texts known as the Vedas.
None of these theories have proved
irrefutable, and part of the difficulty in
deciphering this script comes from the
inscriptions themselves. Linguists have
identified 419 different symbols, which
seems too many for the script to be
alphabetic, but too few for each of these
symbols to stand for a single word, as is
the case in Chinese. The seals’ small size
also means that these inscriptions tend
to be extremely short. Such brevity
makes the text difficult to understand,
since one lacks the contextual patterns
that a longer text would supply. In their
efforts to decode these inscriptions, lin-
guists are working with a series of short
and unrelated textual fragments. The
script could probably be definitively
deciphered with the discovery of a bilin-
gual inscription, but in the absence of
such a key, the problems may prove to
be insurmountable. For further infor-
mation see F. Raymond Allchin, The

Infanticide
The practice of parents killing their child
is uncommon and subject to sharp con-
demnation. In some cases these infants
are illegitimate, and infanticide or aban-
donment is an attempt to avoid the
social repercussions of what is consid-
ered an immoral act.
There are several examples of this
practice in Hindu mythology, of whom
the best known is Kunti. Kunti has been
given a mantra by the sage Durvasas,
which gives her the power to conceive
and bear children by the gods. On a
[[302]]

whim, Kunti impulsively uses the
mantra to invoke the Sun, by whom
she conceives and bears her son Karna.
In her panic at unexpectedly becoming
a mother—she was still unmarried,
and understandably concerned about
what people might think—she puts
the child in a box and abandons him
in the Ganges.
In other cases, infants are killed by
their parents because of the family’s
desperate poverty. Almost without
exception, the children killed in such
cases are daughters. If caught, the par-
ents would be subject to a murder
charge. But infanticide is often hard to
prove if a baby was not born in a hospi-
tal, where births are formally registered.
For poor families, daughters are often
seen as a tremendous financial burden,
because the expense that will be neces-
sary to arrange their marriages is often
more than people can pay. This attitude
toward daughters is also reinforced by
the traditional Indian marriage pattern,
in which a family’s sons bring their
brides into the family home, continue
the joint family, and care for their
parents in their old age. Since after
marriage daughters become members
of their husband’s family, they are often
seen as “temporary” residents in the
homes of their parents. For further
information see Elizabeth Bumiller,
May You Be the Mother of a Hundred
Sons, 1990.
Inference
See anumana.
Infinite Regress
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to be
avoided in constructing an argument.
An infinite regress is not only an infinite
series, but one in which there is no final
cause to make it happen or not happen.
A standard Western example of an
infinite regress is the man who informs
the philosopher that the world is sup-
ported on the back of a giant tortoise.
Upon being asked what supported theInitiation
tortoise, the man replies, “another
tortoise.” Several similar queries bring
the same reply, until in frustration
the man bursts out “It’s no use trying to
trick me—after this, it is tortoises all
the way down!”
In an Indian context, the infinite
regress fallacy is seen as an extended
case of the fallacy of self-residence, and
equally objectionable.
Inherence
In the Nyaya philosophical school,
inherence (samavaya) is the name for a
weak relational force that is assumed to
connect objects and their attributes—
for example, connecting the color red
with a particular ball, and thus making
the ball red. See samavaya.
Inheritance
Traditional Hindu law has several differ-
ent patterns for inheritance. A few
communities in southern India practice
matrilinear succession, in which
inheritance is passed through the
mother’s line.
In much of the rest of India,
inheritance is patrilineal. Patrilineal
inheritance takes two major forms,
according to the prescriptions found
in two major legal texts: the Dayabhaga
in the region of Bengal; and throughout
much of the rest of India, variants
on the Mitakshara .
The Mitakshara vests joint family
property only in males born into the
male line. All males have equal shares
in the family property, although the
head of the family is normally in
charge of administering it. Under this
arrangement, the death of a male
heir automatically increases the share
of all the other surviving males,
whereas the birth of a male decreases
this share. The Mitakshara gives
women no right to inherit family
property, although women generally
have rights to personal wealth
(stridhan) that was theirs to bequeath
and inherit.
The Mitakshara system was based on
the principle of survivorship, under
which only living people could inherit
property. The Dayabhaga model stresses
succession, under which sons do not
become shareholders of the family
property at birth, but upon the death of
their father. If a son happens to die
before his father, the son’s heirs (includ-
ing his wife and daughters) become
inheritors, not in their own right, but as
representatives of the deceased heir.
Under the Dayabhaga model both
widows and daughters could have a
share in family property, and they are
allowed to act as agents in their own
right. In theory this seems far more
advantageous to women, but in fact it is
believed to have had some gruesome
consequences. When the British first
came to Bengal late in the eighteenth
century, they were horrified by the
prevalence of sati, the rite in which a
widow would be burned on her hus-
band’s funeral pyre. Based on admittedly
incomplete evidence, it seems that sati
was not nearly so common in many
other parts of India. One theory to
explain this discrepancy is that sati was
the family’s way to keep their daughter-
in-law—who was an outsider to the
family—from being able to gain control
over their ancestral property.
Initiation
In general, an initiation is a ritual
in which a person is given certain
new rights, capacities, and responsibili-
ties. In a Hindu religious context,
there are two important rites of
religious initiation.
One of these is the upanayana sam-
skara, an adolescent religious initiation
performed on a “twice-born” male—
that is, a member of the brahmin, ksha-
triya, or vaishya group—which is also
known as the “second birth.”
The other rite of initiation, diksha,
is conferred on a person at the pleasure
of a guru or religious preceptor and
has no limitations on who or when it
can be received.

Inscriptions
Inscription of the edicts of Ashoka.
[[304]]

InscriptionsInstallation
The oldest Hindu inscriptions are the
edicts of Ashoka, which were either
carved on rock faces or on stone
pillars; many of these inscriptions are
still readable today, despite being
more than two thousand years old.
Inscriptions on pillars were ordered
by rulers, and were concerned with
more sweeping issues, probably due
to the inscriptions’ public quality
and their often monumental nature.
Aside from stone, the inscriptions
were often done on copper plates.
These were often used to record land
grants, deeds, and other sorts of
bequests, since their permanence
made them more preferable than paper
for safeguarding property rights. In
themselves such inscriptions generally
contain very specific historical informa-
tion, which can help to fill out more gen-
eral knowledge about their time.This is a general term that refers to
the rites for both constructing and
establishing the image of a deity in
a temple setting (devapratishtha), and
for ritually “awakening” the image
so that it becomes a seat for the
deity (pranapratishtha).
Intentional Language
General term for a cryptic and coded
language (Sandhabhasha) intended to
conceal information from people who
have not been initiated into that partic-
ular religious group. See Sandhabhasha.
Intercalary Month
The Hindu ritual year is largely based on
a lunar calendar, whose twelve lunar
months are finished in about 354 solar
days (as opposed to our 365-day calen-
dar). This disparity with the solar calen-
dar means that each lunar year begins
eleven days earlier than the previousIsha (“Lord”) Upanishad
lunar year. The discrepancy meant
that the two calendars would increas-
ingly diverge, such that (for example)
“spring” festivals could occur at any
time of the year.
It has been resolved by the addition
of an intercalary month about every
[[21]]
⁄2 years—more precisely, every thirty-
two months, sixteen days, one hour
and twenty-six minutes. This intercalary
month can take place during any of
the year’s twelve lunar months and
takes the name of the regular lunar
month preceding it.
As an unusual phenomenon, the
extra month is generally seen as a ritually
dangerous time, and one of its common
epithets is the “impure month” (mala-
masa). During this month it is believed
that one should not initiate any new
projects, or perform any religious cere-
monies whose timing is fluid and can be
postponed, particularly marriages.
Worship is highly encouraged during
this time and keeping religious fasts and
giving charity (dana) are also thought to
be highly efficacious.
All of these are means of countering
the inauspiciousness of this calendrical
time—fasts and worship are ways to
gain divine favor and protection, while
charity acts as a channel to remove any
potential bad fortune, by transferring it
to the recipient.
When this extra month comes in the
lunar month of Ashadh, it is called
Purushottama Mas, and especially
marked by the devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu as a time for worship and
other spiritual exercises.
Internal Sacrifice
In general, a type of worship in which
concrete external actions have been
replaced by internal and purely mental
ones. See antaryaga.
Intoxicants
In general, Hindu culture condemns
anything that could lead to loss of
control, including intoxicants such as
alcohol and mind-altering drugs. The
level of disapproval associated with
these substances depends on the
substance itself and the circumstances
under which it is consumed. For
example, consumption of distilled
spirits (“foreign liquor”) is seen as a
sign of adopting outside values, while
consuming undistilled, fermented
beverages such as “country liquor” and
toddy is considered a low-class activi-
ty. However, there are a handful of
Hindu temples at which liquor is the
everyday offering to the deity and
worshipers consume it as prasad, the
sanctified food or drink that carries the
deity’s blessing.
The attitude toward intoxicating
drugs is also complex. Although they are
also subject to general disapproval,
Hindu mythology portrays Shiva as
regularly consuming both bhang, made
from crushed marijuana, and the
intoxicating datura plant. Some of
Shiva’s devotees (bhakta) do the same in
emulation of their chosen deity, and
many ascetics regularly smoke hashish
(charas) mixed with tobacco, a habit
interpreted by some as an intentional
separation from the normal social
system. Consuming bhang is a fairly
common feature of certain religious
festivals, such as Shivaratri and
Holi, although there are many people
who abstain.
Isha (“Lord”) Upanishad
At eighteen verses, one of the shortest
of the early speculative texts known
as the Upanishads; the name of this
upanishad comes from the first word of
the text. It is believed to be one of the
late upanishads due to its brevity, its
composition in verse rather than prose,
and the use of verses that appear in
other upanishads. As with many of the
later upanishads, the Isha Upanishad
propounds a loosely defined monism, in
which the source of all things is ascribed
to a single power. This power can be
discovered through a flash of mystic
insight when the seeker is able to
[[305]]
Ishitvam
transcend the illusion that objects
are unconnected and recognize the one
real power in the universe. The insight
is believed to give a definitive under-
standing into the workings of the
universe and to bring the individual final
release of the soul (moksha) from the
cycle of reincarnation (samsara).
Ishitvam
(“superiority”) One of the eight superhu-
man powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be earned when a person
reaches a high degree of spiritual attain-
ment. This particular power stems from
the control over matter (prakrti), which
along with purusha are the two princi-
ples of the Samkhya philosophical sys-
tem. This control over primal matter
allows one to create, destroy, and
rearrange material objects.
Ishtadevata
(“chosen deity”) The specific Hindu
divinity that an individual has chosen for
more or less exclusive worship and
devotion. In many cases, this choice is
done without denying the existence of
the other Hindu deities, although they
are sometimes interpreted as secondary
manifestations of the ishtadevata. On
the whole, Hindus have been willing to
acknowledge a plurality of divine names
and forms, but each person generally
directs attention and worship to only
one of these deities. The particular deity
one worships is ultimately a matter of
personal choice, although family and
regional loyalties usually play a strong
role in this choice.
Ishvara
(“lord”) Primarily an epithet of the god
Shiva, especially when the word is used
at the end of compound names, such as
Rameshvar, “the Lord of Rama,” or
Mahakaleshvar, “the Lord of Death.” In
its more general meaning as “lord,” ish-
vara can also be part of the name taken
by earthly rulers, such as the Chalukya
monarch Someshvara (r. 1242–1268).
[[306]]

Ishvarakrishna
(4th c.) Indian philosopher who is
traditionally cited as the author of the
Samkhyakarikas, a collection of sayings
that explain the basic position of the
Samkhya philosophical school. The
Samkhya school is one of the six
schools in traditional Hindu philoso-
phy, and its position is an atheistic
philosophical dualism, in which two
fundamental principles, prakrti (“nature”)
and purusha (“person”), are the source
of all things.
Ishvara Puri
(c. 1500) Ecstatic devotee (bhakta) of the
god Krishna, who is famous as the guru
of the Bengali saint Chaitanya. Little is
known about Ishvara Puri’s background,
although his surname “Puri” indicates
that he took formal ascetic initiation in
the Puri branch of the Dashanami
Sanyasis. After meeting Ishvara Puri in
[[1508]]
 in the pilgrimage town of Gaya,
Chaitanya was fired with devotion to
Krishna, and he began to perform the
public ecstatic recitations of Krishna’s
name that have become an established
element in the religious life of the com-
munity that claims him as its founder,
the Gaudiya Vaishnavas. See also ISKCON.
ISKCON
Acronym for the International Society
for Krishna Consciousness, a Hindu
missionary community commonly
known as the Hare Krishnas. This
name comes from ISKCON’s emphasis
on the importance of repeating the
divine name, particularly the formula
known as the mahamantra (“Hare
Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,
Hare Hare”). ISKCON was founded by A. C.
Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, and its reli-
gious roots lie in the Vaishnava piety of
his native Bengal. The Bengali Vaishnava
tradition has long emphasized the
importance of publicly chanting
Krishna’s name, particularly in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava community founded
by the Bengali saint Chaitanya.ISKCON
ISKCON comes out of this Bengali tra-
dition, but in other ways it shows ten-
sions that mark it as a twentieth-century
phenomenon. Its strong missionary
activities make it a highly unusual Hindu
religious organization, as does its mem-
bership—Prabhupada founded ISKCON in
New York City, most of ISKCON’s members
are Western converts from Judaism and
Christianity, and the bulk of its mission-
ary activities have been performed out-
side of India. The roots of ISKCON ’s
membership, and the general fervor
associated with converts, have led to
some theological contradictions. On
one hand, ISKCON doctrine tends to den-
igrate human capacity, putting the
emphasis on the saving power of God’s
grace. On the other hand, ISKCON devo-
tees (bhakta) believe that they gain
religious merit by living a rigorously
regulated lifestyle that mandates a
strict vegetarian diet, abstinence from
liquor and nonmedicinal drugs, sexual
activity only for procreation, and a
well-established daily religious routine;
many devotees also adopt Indian cloth-
ing and hair styles. In these two oppos-
ing emphases—complete surrender to
God’s grace, and strict adherence to a
prescribed “holy” lifestyle—ISKCON shows
surprising parallels to evangelical
Christianity. Since Prabhupada’s death in
[[1977]]
, the organization has been run by
these Western converts, and thus ISKCON
can be characterized as a “countercul-
tural” Euro-American phenomenon,
despite its Indian origins. ISKCON has a
significant presence in Brindavan, the
village celebrated as Krishna’s childhood
home, where the group has built a
magnificent temple; they are also active
in Mayapur in Bengal, which they
claim as Chaitanya’s birthplace. After a
period of growth in the 1970s, ISKCON had
serious legal problems in the 1980s,
including losses in civil suits and
allegations of money laundering and
murder. For a sympathetic perspective
on the movement, see Larry Shinn,
The Dark Lord, 1987; and Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
