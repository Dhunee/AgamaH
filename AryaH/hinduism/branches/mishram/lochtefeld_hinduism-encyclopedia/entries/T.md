Tad Ekam
(“That One”) Epithet used in Rg Veda
hymn 10.129, the so-called Creation
Hymn, to designate the first living being
on the earth. The four Vedas are the old-
est Hindu religious texts, and based on
its style and content, the Rg Veda is the
oldest of the Vedas. Most of the hymns in
the Rg Veda are invocations addressed to
various divinities, sung to propitiate
these divinities so that human beings
may enjoy the good things of this life.
The Creation Hymn takes a far more
speculative tone, standing in marked
contrast to the confidence and opti-
mism found in the earlier hymns. In the
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by
imagining a time before the existence of
Being and Nonbeing and speculates on
how the world came to be.
In the end, the poet ascribes all cre-
ation to a single impersonal agent, That
One (Tad Ekam). This hymn is notewor-
thy for ascribing the creation of the
world to a single power, an idea that
foreshadows the notion of Brahman in
the Upanishads, the speculative texts
that form the final stratum of the Vedic
literature. The name Tad Ekam, which is
grammatically a neuter noun, also fore-
shadows the notion found in the
Upanishads that Brahman is an imper-
sonal force. After describing how That
One formed the cosmos and knew all its
secrets, the poem ends with the conjec-
ture that perhaps That One may not be
omniscient and omnipotent after all.
This hymn thus further foreshadows the
Upanishads in its speculative tone and
its admission that the ultimate answer
may be unknown.

Tagore, Rabindranath
(1861–1941) Poet and Nobel laureate in
Literature, an honor bestowed in 1912
for his Gitanjali (“Garland of Songs”).
Tagore came from an influential and
extremely wealthy landed family and
was thus able to focus all his energy on
his literary work. Aside from his prodi-
gious literary output, he lectured exten-
sively both in India and in other
countries; in the latter he emphasized
the need to retain spiritual values,
whereas in India he more often gave his
attention to the need to fulfill people’s
material needs. In 1921 he established
the Vishva-Bharati University at
Shantiniketan in the state of West
Bengal. The university was dedicated to
providing an education that would satisfy
both of these needs and thus develop an
integrated human being. For further
information see Krishna Kripalani,

Tagore: Religion as a Constant Struggle
for Balance,” in Robert D. Baird (ed.),
Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Tagore Jayanti
Holiday marking the birth date of the
Bengali poet, writer, and thinker
Rabindranath Tagore, celebrated on
May 8, the day he was born in 1861. As
with most twentieth-century figures,
Tagore’s birthday is celebrated accord-
ing to the solar calendar of the common
era, rather than the lunar calendar that
governs most religious observances.
Although Tagore is best known for his lit-
erary work, he was also considered a
religious preceptor (guru), and thus his
birthday carries extra meaning.
Tai
Tenth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Makara (the zodiacal
sign of Capricorn), which usually falls
within January and February. The exis-
tence of several different calendars is
one clear sign of the continuingTala

importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient,
well-established
literary
tradition. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Takshaka
In Hindu mythology, a venomous ser-
pent-king from whose bite King
Parikshit is killed. After insulting a pow-
erful sage, Parikshit is cursed to die of a
snakebite within seven days. Parikshit
takes all possible precautions to avoid
his fate: He builds a house on a huge pil-
lar, has all things entering the house
carefully searched, and surrounds him-
self with physicians who can cure
snakebite. Six days pass without inci-
dent, but as the seventh day ends, peo-
ple begin to relax and bring in some fruit
to eat. Takshaka has concealed himself
as a tiny worm in one of the pieces of
fruit and, when the fruit is cut open,
changes into his real shape, bites the
king, and kills him.
Despite his fearsome role in this story,
an earlier story illustrates that Takshaka
is not entirely evil. Takshaka’s mother,
Kadru, bets her sister Vinata that the
tail of a certain celestial horse is black,
whereas Vinata claims it is white; the sis-
ter agrees that the loser will become a
servant to the winner. Kadru asks her
children, the serpents, to hang from the
back of the horse to make it appear as if
it is black and thus takes unfair advan-
tage. Some of her children, including
Takshaka, refuse to take part in such
deceit, and Kadru curses them to be
killed by Janamjeya, King Parikshit’s
son. Takshaka manages to escape this
curse—one of the few times that this
happens in Hindu mythic stories—but
most of his siblings are not so lucky.
Tala
In Indian music and dance, the most
general term for “rhythm,” either as
an accompaniment to music or dance
or played on a drum as a solo instru-
ment. The rhythmic systems in all
varieties of Indian music are extremely
rich and complex and require years of
study to master.

Talikota
Talikota
City in the Bijapur district of the state of
Karnataka, which in 1565 was the site of
a battle between the Vijayanagar
dynasty king Rama Raja and a coalition
of Muslim sultans from farther north in
the Deccan peninsula. Rama Raja’s dis-
astrous defeat brought the Vijayanagar
dynasty to an abrupt end. The sultans
sacked the empire’s capital at Hampi,
and it has never been inhabited since
that time.
Tamas
(“darkness”) One of the three funda-
mental qualities (gunas) believed to be
present in all things, the other two being
sattva (“goodness”) and rajas (“pas-
sion”). According to this model, the dif-
fering proportions of these qualities
account for the differences both in the
inherent nature of things and in individ-
ual human capacities and tendencies.
Of the three, tamas is always negative
and is associated with darkness, disease,
ignorance, sloth, spoilage, and death.
The notion of these three gunas origi-
nated in the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, and
although much of Samkhya meta-
physics connected with the gunas has
long been discredited, the idea of the
gunas and their qualities has become a
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
Tamil Epics
Collective name for three early Tamil
epic poems: the Shilappadigaram, the
Manimegalai, and the Shivaga-
Sindamani. These poems were com-
posed in about the sixth and seventh
centuries of the common era, when reli-
gious forms and cultural influence
(among them, the composition of epic
poems) were seeping in from the north
and influencing indigenous forms. Aside
from Sanskrit, Tamil is the only major
ancient literary language. All three of
these poems provide important infor-
mation about life in their contemporary
[[684]]

times, including religious life. In brief,
the Shilappadigaram (“The Jeweled
Anklet”) is a tragedy that highlights sev-
eral important themes that have pervaded
Hindu culture, particularly the need for
a king to rule righteously and the power
gained by a wife through her devotion to
her husband. The Manimegalai focuses
on a young woman of the same name,
who is wooed by the local prince but
eventually becomes a Buddhist nun.
Although the story clearly has a Buddhist
bias, Manimegalai has numerous debates
with people from competing religious
traditions. Finally, the Shivaga-
Sindamani describes the adventures of
Shivaga, a man who excels at every pos-
sible manly art, who with each new
challenge wins a new wife for his harem
but in the end renounces everything
to become a Jain monk. Although the
later two epics are respectively biased
toward Buddhist and Jain religious
values, they all give valuable informa-
tion about contemporary religious life.

Tamil Language
One of the four Dravidian languages,
along with Kannada, Telegu, and
Malayalam; all four languages are spo-
ken primarily in southern India. Tamil is
the predominant language in modern
Tamil Nadu, which is one of the “lin-
guistic states” formed after the Indians
gained independence. This state was
formed to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Although all four lan-
guages have literary and cultural signifi-
cance, Tamil has by far the richest
history as a literary language. Tamil liter-
ature begins in the early centuries of the
common era with the Sangam litera-
ture, eight collections of poetry that
focused equally on the external descrip-
tion of battle or internal descriptions of
love. The Sangam literature was fol-
lowed by the three Tamil epics: the
Shilappadigaram, the Manimegalai,
and the Shivaga-Sindamani. Between
the seventh and tenth centuries cameTamil Nadu
the devotional (bhakti) literature com-
posed by the Alvars and the Nayanars,
with the former expressing their devo-
tion to the god Vishnu and the latter to
the god Shiva. Their devotional poetry
was unprecedented in Hindu religious
history because it utilized everyday ver-
nacular language as a spectacular vehi-
cle for profound religious expression.
The Alvars’ poems became a founda-
tional text for the Shrivaishnava com-
munity, and the Nayanars’ for Shaiva
Siddhanta, and thus both of these col-
lections continue to be important in
Hindu religious life. Even today Tamil is
a vibrant literary language and a source
of intense regional pride to the people
living there; some of the most violent
recent demonstrations in southern
India were the so-called language riots,
protesting the imposition of Hindi as
the government language, a move that
was seen as a conscious attempt to mar-
ginalize Tamil language and culture.
Tamil Months
Although the lunar calendar is by far the
most important means for determining
the Hindu religious calendar, these
lunar months are also set in the frame-
work of a solar calendar. The latter is
used for the calculation of the inter-
calary month, which helps keep the
lunar and solar calendars in rough cor-
respondence. In northern India the
months of the solar calendar correlate
with the zodiac, with each month
named after the sign into which the sun
is reckoned as entering at the beginning
of that month. In southern India the
divisions of the solar calendar are exactly
the same as in the north, but the twelve
months are given different names. The
Tamil months take their names from
some of the nakshatras, or features in
the lunar zodiac, or from modifications
of the lunar months. The Tamil year
begins with the month of Chittirai,
which corresponds to the northern
Indian solar month of Mesha (the zodia-
cal sign of Aries), which by the Indian
calculations, falls within April and May.
The eleven months following Chittirai
are Vaikasi, Ani, Adi, Avani, Purattasi,
Aippasi, Kartigai, Margali, Tai, Masi,
and Panguni. Such different calendars
are one clear sign of the continuing
importance of regional cultural
patterns. This regional culture is partic-
ularly important in the Tamil cultural
area because Tamil is one of the few
regional languages with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition.
Tamil Nadu
(“land of the Tamils”) Modern Indian
state at the southern tip of the subconti-
nent, on the Bay of Bengal. Tamil Nadu
is one of the so-called linguistic states,
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Tamil Nadu was thus
formed from the Tamil-speaking areas
of the former state of Madras. Tamil
Nadu has a long and rich history, and
the Tamil literary tradition stretches
back to the early centuries of the com-
mon era. Successive regional dynas-
ties—the Pallavas, Cholas, and
Pandyas—built a host of temples in the
characteristic Dravida architectural
style, and even today Tamil Nadu has
hundreds of temple towns, that is,
towns in which the urban hub is an
enormous temple complex that includes
shops, markets, offices, and residential
space. Modern Tamil culture is the prod-
uct of this long and ancient tradition,
and Tamils pride themselves in having
been influenced little by outsiders—nei-
ther by the Hindu influences from
northern India, nor by the Muslim cul-
ture whose influence was so profound in
regions farther north. Tamil Nadu has so
many cultural sites and holy places that
it is impossible to name them, but the
most important are Rameshvaram,
Chidambaram, Madurai, Tiruchi-
rappalli, Kanchipuram, Mahabalipuram,
Kumbhakonam, Thiruvaiyaru, Tanjore,
and Kanyakumari; there is also a net-
work of six temples to the god Murugan
scattered in different areas of the state,

Tamoyoga
One of the three classes of beings in the
Dvaita Vedanta philosophical school,
founded by the philosopher Madhva
(1197–1276). Madhva’s fundamental
assumption was that God was utterly
transcendent, above and beyond the
world and human beings. The strength
of this conviction led him to stress theTanmatras
importance of grace as the sole means
of salvation because human beings were
unable to save themselves. Given this
dire view of human capacities, Madhva
divided the beings of the world into
three classes: The muktiyogas were des-
tined for final liberation, the nityasam-
sarins were destined for eternal rebirth,
and the tamoyogas were predestined for
eternal damnation.city’s Brhadeshvar temple, and his
son Rajendra (r. 1014–1042 C.E.),
whose greatest monument is the temple
at
Gangaikondacholapuran.
The
Brhadeshvar temple is dedicated to
Shiva as the “Great Lord”; some of
the most notable of the other temples
built or improved by the Cholas
were at Kumbhakonam, Thiruvaiyaru,
Chidambaram, and Shrirangam.
TandavaTanka
Name denoting one of the two broad
categories in Indian dance. The tandava
style is athletic and dramatic and con-
veys violence and power, whereas the
other dance form, lasya, is soft and lyri-
cal and conveys a mood of love. The tan-
dava style received its name from the
tandava dance of the god Shiva.
According to tradition, this is the dance
through which Shiva destroys the world
when its time has come. Not all of the
dance’s mythic connotations are violent,
since this athletic dance is also said to
be the one through which Shiva van-
quished the goddess Kali in a dance
contest, when her feminine modesty
prevented her from imitating his style.Name for a small chisel used by stone
workers, one of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography. The tanka
is mainly associated with Shiva and
is a minor artifact because it generally
appears only when the deity has
multiple arms and is holding a number
of objects.
Tanjore
City and district in the southern Indian
state of Tamil Nadu, the eastern bound-
ary of which is the Bay of Bengal. The
Tanjore district lies in the Cauvery River
delta, south of the river’s main channel;
even today this extremely fertile area
grows a large percentage of India’s rice.
This district was the core homeland of
the Chola dynasty, and the land’s agri-
cultural fecundity was the underlying
source of the dynasty’s power, which at
one point stretched through most of
southern India and even extended to
Malaysia. The Chola dynasty used
their wealth and power to build
enormous temples throughout Tamil
Nadu, but especially in the Tanjore
district and Tanjore city, their capital.
The Chola zenith came with King Raja
Raja (r. 985–1014 C.E.), who built Tanjore
Tanmatras
The tanmatras are the subtle elements,
the subtle forms of the five gross ele-
ments (earth, air, fire, water, and
akasha) from which the gross elements
are derived. The senses corresponding
to the subtle elements are gandha
(smell) for earth, sparsha (touch) for air,
rupa (shape) for fire, rasa (taste) for
water, and shabda (sound) for akasha.
The tanmatras first appeared in the
account of the evolution of the universe
propounded by the Samkhya school,
one of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy. In the Samkhya
account, the subtle elements are the
stage of evolution preceding the evolu-
tion of the gross elements. The Samkhya
school espoused an atheistic dualism in
which the two fundamental principles
were purusha (spirit) and prakrti
(matter); all of this evolution was associ-
ated with prakrti because, according
to the Samkhyas, the purusha
never changed. The Samkhya account
of evolution was appropriated by
other groups—although these groups
often adapted it to reflect theistic
assumptions in which the world
came from God—and thus the notion
[[687]]
Tantra
of the subtle elements became an
accepted philosophical convention.
Tantra
General term for a genre of secret ritually
based religious practices. These are
most often laid out in texts also known
as tantras (“loom”), so named because
these texts weave a distinctive picture of
reality. In popular Hindu culture, tantric
practitioners (tantrikas) are associated
with illicit sexuality, with consuming
forbidden things such as meat and
liquor, and with having the ability to kill
or harm others through black magic.
Such power and perceived amorality
make tantrikas objects of fear, a quality
that some people have used to their
advantage. A more neutral assessment
of tantra would stress three qualities:
secrecy, power, and nondualism, the
ultimate unity of all things.
Secrecy in tantra serves two func-
tions. On the one hand, it conceals the
rites and practices from the uninitiated,
who are seen as unqualified to receive it,
and on the other, it creates a religious
subcommunity with a particularly
defined identity and sense of privilege.
This sense of exclusivity, of being privy to
something to which few have access, is
one of the reasons that tantra is seen as a
higher religious practice. Even when the
text of a tantra has been written down, it
is always assumed that the texts are life-
less without the instruction of a qualified
person. This stress on personal transmis-
sion means that diksha (a type of initia-
tion) is the only way to gain access to this
tradition, and thus tantra stresses the
importance of the guru-disciple rela-
tionship even more strongly than does
the Hindu tradition as a whole. Gurus are
free to initiate anyone they deem quali-
fied. Although many tantrikas are twice-
born men, that is, members of the three
highest classes (varnas)—brahmins,
kshatriyas, and vaishyas—who have
received the adolescent religious initia-
tion known as the second birth, in theory
tantric practice is open to all people,
regardless of gender or social status.
[[688]]

Power in tantra is manifested in vari-
ous ways. One of these comes in the
transmission of the teaching itself, in
which the guru’s empowerment is
believed necessary to “activate” the
transmitted
material,
particularly
mantras. Tantric practice is also claimed
to be far more powerful than regular reli-
gious practice and thus more efficacious
in bringing final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The usual claim is that tantra’s
potency can bring such liberation in a
single lifetime, whereas other forms of
religious practice take untold aeons.
Such powerful forces must be kept secret
from the uninitiated, thus the stress on
secrecy. It is widely accepted that the
spiritual attainments gained through
tantric practice also bring superhuman
powers (siddhi), as a natural byproduct
of such attainment. Although aspirants
are discouraged from seeking such pow-
ers because the act of seeking is seen as
rooted in selfish desire, those who gain
such powers without seeking are
believed to be able to exercise them
without being corrupted.
For tantrikas, nondualism—the
assertion that all reality is ultimately one
thing—is both a philosophical affirma-
tion and the operative principle behind
their religious practice. Tantrikas usually
conceive of this unity theistically, seeing
their chosen deity (ishtadevata) as the
material, efficient, and final cause of all
reality. For tantrikas, definitively realiz-
ing the essential oneness of all things
removes the mistaken understanding
that causes bondage and rebirth and
brings final liberation. Tantric practice
affirms this nondualism, often through
rituals stressing the unification of oppo-
sites. For this reason, some tantrikas
make ritual use of things that are nor-
mally forbidden, most notably the “Five
Forbidden Things” (panchamakara):
fish, wine, meat, parched grain, and sex-
ual intercourse. In theory, this rite is a
means to break down duality because it
violates societal norms forbidding con-
sumption of intoxicants, nonvegetarian
food, and illicit sexuality, in a conscious
effort to sacralize what is normallyTaraka
forbidden. Although this rite collapses
conventional boundaries of good and
bad, pure and impure, the goal is to
replace external rites (bahiryaga) with
interior ones (antaryaga), thus explod-
ing the duality of subject and object. The
paradigm for this interior practice is
tantric yoga. This is usually some vari-
ant of kundalini yoga, in which the two
divine principles of Shiva and Shakti
are ultimately united in the expert’s
subtle body. The final vehicle for tantric
practice comes in rituals using symbolic
diagrams (yantra), of which one exam-
ple is the shrichakra. These are often
particular to specific tantric lineages
(parampara) and thus ground the
aspirant in a particular tradition. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Tantrika
Name denoting a practitioner of tantra,
a secret ritually based religious practice.
Tapas
(“heat”) Term denoting any physical
asceticism, or what in earlier times was
referred to as mortification of the flesh.
The term tapas encompasses rites of
denial, such as fasting (upavasa) or
celibacy, as well as rites of enduring
physical pain, such as the “five fires”
(panchagni) rite. In this rite a person
sits during the hot season surrounded
by four fires, with the fifth fire being the
sun overhead. Other rites include
enduring cold from bathing (snana) in
snow-fed rivers, and enduring any other
sort of physical discomfort. The word
tapas can also describe bizarre and even
masochistic behaviors, such as remain-
ing standing for years on end; keeping
an arm upraised until the muscles atro-
phy, and it cannot be lowered; lying on
beds of thorns and nails, and so forth.
The governing assumption behind all of
these practices is that they generate
spiritual power (seen figuratively as
“heat”) and that a person who generates
and amasses enough of this power
will gain supernormal powers or the
ability to demand boons from the
gods themselves. Even though many
contemporary Hindus are skeptical of
the more extreme practices and may
dismiss them, there is still great cultural
respect for ascetic self-control, and
combined with the right personality,
such practices can still confer considerable
religious authority.
In Hindu mythology Indra, king of
the gods, pays close attention to those
amassing such powers to protect him-
self from being replaced by someone
more powerful. When an ascetic starts to
amass enough power to displace him,
Indra’s heavenly throne becomes hot
through the “heat” generated by the
tapas. Indra must search for the aspirant
and defuse this power in one of two
ways—either by giving the aspirant a
boon, which in many cases is the reason
for performing the tapas in the first
place, or by sending a celestial nymph
(apsara) to seduce the ascetic, whose
power will be discharged along with his
semen. This mythology reflects the
basic Hindu belief that the starting point
for ascetic power is celibacy, which con-
serves a man’s vital energies by conserv-
ing his semen.
Taraka
In Hindu mythology, an extremely pow-
erful demon, who endures such severe
physical asceticism (tapas) that he
receives a boon that he can be killed
only by a son of the god Shiva. This
boon seems to make Taraka invulnera-
ble because at the time, Shiva is lost in
meditation and is still grieving for his
dead wife Sati. For a long time Taraka
grows more powerful and more arrogant
until he is eventually able to defeat the
gods in battle and exile them from heaven.
In their despair the gods turn to the god
of love, Kama, and beg him to shoot
Shiva with an arrow of desire so that he
[[689]]
Tarakeshvar
will marry the goddess Parvati, and thus
make it possible to bring about Taraka’s
death. Shiva, however, destroys Kama
before he can shoot, burning him to ash
with a stream of fire from his third eye.
Shiva later marries Parvati, and their
son, Skanda, kills Taraka in battle.
Tarakeshvar
City and sacred site (tirtha) thirty miles
northwest of Calcutta in the state of
West Bengal, which because of its prox-
imity to Calcutta, is the most widely vis-
ited pilgrimage place in the state.
Tarakeshvar is famous for the temple of
Baba Tarakanath, who is the god Shiva
in his form as the “Lord of Liberation.”
Shiva is present at Tarakeshvar in the
form of a linga, the pillar-shaped object
that is Shiva’s symbolic form. The
Tarakeshvar linga is claimed to be a
“self-manifested” (svayambhu) image,
which was not made by human hands
but established through an act of divine
self-revelation. The site’s charter myth
describes how the linga of Shiva is
buried in the earth but is discovered
when a cow habitually lets down her
milk on the spot above it as an act of
worship. The charter myth also
describes how a man afflicted with ago-
nizing hemorrhoids finds relief by
drinking the water that has been poured
on the linga as an offering and thus is
blessed by Shiva’s touch. With these two
stories, the charter conveys the image of
a deity who is present and responsive to
his devotees (bhakta) as well as the
sense of a place where human beings
can go to find relief from their afflic-
tions. One of the most unusual manifes-
tations of this is the practice of dharna,
in which pilgrims lie on the temple’s
outer porch, fasting (upavasa) for as
long as it takes the deity to communi-
cate with them, usually in a dream. For
further information see E. Alan Morinis,
Pilgrimage in the Hindu Tradition, 1984.
Tarapith
[[690]]

(“Tara’s seat”) Town and sacred site
(tirtha) in the state of West Bengal,
about 130 miles northwest of Calcutta.
Tarapith is famous as one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess that spreads throughout the
subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha marks
the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth,
taking form there as a different goddess;
in the case of Tarapith, the body part
was Sati’s cornea (tara). Tarapith’s pre-
siding goddess, Tara, is a fierce form of
the Goddess, who has strong associa-
tions with tantra, a secret ritually based
religious practice. In modern times
much of the shrine’s fame comes from
an unusual ascetic named Vamakhepa
(1843–1911), whose apparent irrational-
ity and lack of respect for generally
accepted norms—he once urinated on
the temple’s image of Tara to show his
contempt for a deity made of iron—was
a perfect match for Tara herself. Tarapith
is said to bestow supernormal powers
(siddhis) on those who worship there;
this makes Tarapith not only a very pow-
erful place but also a potentially danger-
ous one. For further information see
E. Alan Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984. See also pitha.
Tarjini Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
tarjini hasta is the name for a particular
hand gesture (hasta) in which the hand
is closed except for the index finger,
which is pointing upward as if to
admonish or scold the viewer. The word
tarjini is derived from a verb that can
mean either “to threaten” or “to cen-
sure”—both of which can be understood
from this gesture.
Tarka
(“reasoning”) In Indian logic, tarka
denotes the mode of argument that
focuses on the identification and classi-
fication of fallacies. When it is used in
argumentation, tarka does not advance
one’s own point of view but is used to
discredit an opponent’s assertion, either
by reducing it to absurdity, by showing
that the argument does not fulfillTat Tvam Asi
necessary conditions, or by showing
that it suffers from a fallacy that
renders it untenable.
Tarpana
(“satisfying”) Tarpana is a memorial rite
performed for the satisfaction of one’s
ancestors, in which one offers them
libations of water to quench their thirst.
Tarpana satisfies the “sacrifice to the
ancestors,” which is one of the Five
Great Sacrifices. These five sacrifices are
mandatory daily religious observances
(nitya karma) for a “twice-born” house-
holder, that is, a householder who has
been born into one of the three “twice-
born” groups in Indian society—brah-
min, kshatriya, or vaishya—and who
has received the adolescent religious
initiation known as the second birth.
Tarpana is also sometimes an occasional
religious act (naimittika karma), which
should be performed on occasions
when one is bathing (snana) at pilgrim-
age places (tirthas). The rite itself is
quite simple. The performer first bathes
to become ritually pure, scoops up
water in his joined hands, then tips his
fingers forward to let the water drain
out. Some sources also specify that the
water should be mixed with sesame
seeds, a substance associated with
offerings to the dead. Tarpana was
considered a companion rite to the
memorial ceremony known as shraddha,
although as an obligatory daily act,
tarpana was performed much more
frequently. In the shraddha ritual, one
symbolically feeds one’s ancestors to
satisfy their hunger, whereas in the
tarpana ritual, one gives them water to
quench their thirst.
Tat Tvam Asi
(“You are that”) In the Hindu philosophical
tradition, one of the “great utterances”
(mahavakyas) expressing the ultimate
truth. The truth referred to here is the
identity of atman (the individual Self)
and Brahman (Supreme Reality); this
identity is the heart of the speculative
Bather performs the tarpana memorial rite in the

texts called the Upanishads. This partic-
ular passage is found repeatedly in the
sixth book of the Chandogya
Upanishad, in which the boy
Shvetaketu is being instructed by his
father. The boy’s father uses a series
of analogies to convey his instruction
regarding the identical natures of the
atman and Brahman, ending every
such analogy with this concluding
phrase, which contains the wisdom
of the whole.
In addition to its textual importance,
this and three other mahavakyas—as
utterances that capsulize fundamental
truth—were appropriated as identifying
symbols by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics. Each
division had a different mahavakya, just
as each had a different Veda, a different
primary sacred center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Tat
tvam asi is the mahavakya associated
with the Kitawara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.

Teej
Teej
Teej is a name denoting two different
Hindu religious observances, both falling
in the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). Kajari Teej falls on
the third day of the dark (waxing) half of
the month and Hartalika Teej two weeks
later, on the third day of the bright
(waxing) half. Both of these observances
have a mythic charter connected with
the god Shiva and his wife Parvati, but
the latter is far more important. Kajari
Teej is a festival marking the coming of
the monsoons, a season that once
rendered travel impossible. For lovers
who were together, the monsoon
months were very sweet, but for those
who were apart, the coming of the rains
foretold a time of separation. One of the
standard poetic images is the woman
watching the darkening sky, wondering
whether her beloved will make it home
in time. On this day people sing songs
in the Kajari raga, a melodic mode asso-
ciated both with the rains and with
songs of separation and longing. On this
day people also welcome the rainy season
by setting up swings and swinging on
them. The festival is celebrated through
much of India, but especially in the
Benares and Mirzapur districts of the
eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.
Hartalika Teej (also known as
Hariyali Teej) is a religious observance
practiced by young unmarried women
in order to gain a good husband and
have a happy marriage. In Hindu culture
the model for the ideal husband is the
god Shiva, who despite his wild appear-
ance and his unusual habits, is com-
pletely devoted to his wife. One sign of
this devotion is that Shiva and his wife
Parvati are married only to each other,
no matter which forms they take—as,
for instance, when one or the other is
cursed to be born as a human being. As
the ideal divine couple, Shiva and
Parvati are the patron deities of this reli-
gious observance. Women observing
this festival should worship Shiva and
Parvati (as the model couple whose hap-
piness they hope to share), decorate
[[692]]

their houses, put on new clothes, and
pass the night singing songs of auspi-
ciousness. This festival reveals the cul-
tural importance of marriage for Indian
women. Because the identity for many
Indian women is still formed primarily
through their traditional roles as wives
and mothers, for many women their
marriage is the most important event in
their lives.
The charter myth for Hartalika Teej
not only underlines the importance of a
happy marriage but also points to the
woman’s role in gaining her husband.
After the death of the goddess Sati, she is
reborn as Parvati in the house of
Himalaya, the mountains personified.
Very early in life, Parvati vows that she
will have no husband except for Shiva.
Her parents try to discourage her from
this wish because Shiva has taken a
vow of asceticism and passes his time
deep in meditation on Mount Kailas.
Undeterred, Parvati goes up into the
mountains and begins to do harsh physi-
cal asceticism (tapas) of her own. The
power generated by her asceticism even-
tually awakens Shiva, and on Hartalika
Teej he comes to where she is staying,
disguised as an aged brahmin. He first
tries to discourage Parvati by making dis-
paraging remarks about Shiva’s lifestyle
and personality, but Parvati refuses to lis-
ten and remains unshaken in her resolve.
Eventually Shiva reveals his true form to
her, and on that day they are betrothed to
be married.
Teli
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organized
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group had a monopoly. In
traditional northern Indian society, the
Telis were a Hindu jati whose hereditary
occupation was making vegetable oil by
pressing oil seeds.Tengalai
Temple car from the city of Shrirangapatnam, in the state of Karnataka. It is used to transport an image of
the temple’s primary deity during festival processions.
Temple Cars
Name for the ceremonial carts in which
the movable image of a deity (utsava
murti) can be transported throughout
the town or, in the case of the temples of
southern India, around the processional
streets that often ring the temple in con-
centric layers. In some cases the carts
are made new every year, as at the tem-
ple of the god Jagannath in the city of
Puri; in other cases (as one finds in
many of the southern Indian temples)
the temple car is one of the deity’s
standard accouterments, and it is made
from precious metals and is richly deco-
rated. In either case the deity is being
treated in a manner parallel to that of a
king, and the car is a means to move the
deity in procession to view his or her
earthly domain.
Tengalai
One of the two main subsects in
the Shrivaishnava religious community,
the other being the Vadagalai. The
[[693]]
Thakur
Shrivaishnavas are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, and their roots lie in the
devotional hymns of the Alvars, a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in
southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. Two centuries
later, the Alvars’ devotional outpouring
was organized and systematized by
the philosopher Ramanuja (11th c.),
who is considered the Shrivaishnava
founder. Ramanuja was convinced that
Brahman, or Supreme Reality, was a
personal deity rather than an impersonal
abstract principle, and he was also
convinced that devotion (bhakti) was
the most important form of religious
practice. Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, his
philosophical position, stressed both of
these convictions and thus opposed the
Advaita Vedanta school, founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, which
believed that the Supreme Being was
impersonal and that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path.
The split between the Tengalais and
the Vadagalais came several centuries
after Ramanuja and stemmed from dif-
fering perspectives on what the individ-
ual must do to gain final liberation of the
soul (moksha). The Tengalais empha-
size the need for absolute surrender
(prapatti) to the grace of God, through
which devotees will be saved with no
action of their own; the Vadagalais stress
that devotees must also exert them-
selves on their own behalf. The Tengalai
founder was Pillai Lokacharya (14th c.),
who is also the community’s most
important figure.
Thakur
(“master”) The model for traditional
Indian society was as a collection of
endogamous subgroups (i.e., groups in
which marriages occurred only between
members of the same group) known as
jatis (“birth”). These jatis were orga-
nized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary
occupation, over which each group had
a monopoly. In northern India, the
Thakurs were a jati considered to be
[[694]]

kshatriyas, who have traditionally func-
tioned as landlords and village leaders.
Its most famous member was the Nobel
laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
Thandai
(“cooling”) A refreshing sweetened drink
made of milk or yogurt, ground nuts,
and spices often used as the medium
for the consumption of ground marijuana
(bhang). As with all milk products, the
thandai is considered to have cooling
properties; this effect may be intended
to balance the bhang, which is
considered to be “hot” because of its
intoxicating properties.
Thanesar
City and sacred site (tirtha) adjoining
the sacred site of Kurukshetra in the
northern part of the state of Haryana.
Thanesar is a famous site in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two
Sanskrit epics. The epic’s climax comes
at Kurukshetra in an eighteen-day battle
between two factions of an extended
family, along with their allies and sup-
porters. On one side, there are the five
Pandava brothers, who are the epic’s
protagonists, and on the other, their
cousins the Kauravas, who are the
antagonists. According to the epic, on
the eve of the battle, the Pandavas wor-
shiped the god Shiva in a temple at
Thanesar, and after their worship Shiva
assured them that they would be victori-
ous. Aside from the temple, Thanesar
also has a renowned bathing tank said to
contain all the sacred rivers of India, at
which the primary bathing (snana) day
is Sunday. Nearby is the Gita Mandir,
at which Arjuna, one of the Pandava
brothers, is said to have received
the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita
from Krishna in the moments before
the battle began.
Thanjavur
A variant name for the southern Indian
city of Tanjore. See Tanjore.3HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood
Thief CastesThree Debts
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups (i.e., groups in which marriages
occurred only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group had a monopoly. Although it
sounds bizarre, this specialization
extended to all occupations, and there
were hereditary occupational groups
whose profession was thievery and ban-
ditry. The most famous individual from
these was Tirumangai (9th c.), by far the
most picturesque of the Alvars, a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. In the nineteenth century the
British composed a list of several hun-
dred such groups, who were subject to
relentless scrutiny, opposition, and in
many cases resettlement.According to tradition, repayment of
three “debts” was incumbent on all
“twice-born” men, that is, men born
into one of the three “twice-born”
groups in Indian society—brahmin,
kshatriya, or vaishya—who had under-
gone the adolescent religious initiation
known as the second birth. The first of
these debts was to the gods and was
repaid by offering sacrifices. The second
debt was to the sages and was satisfied
by studying the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative religious texts. The
final debt was to the ancestors (pitrs)
and was satisfied by procreating a son,
to ensure that the ancestral rites would
be carried out without interruption.
Thiruvaiyaru
Temple town and sacred site (tirtha) in
the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu,
about 170 miles south and west of
Madras. Thiruvaiyaru’s major temple is
dedicated to the god Shiva, but the site
is most famous for being the home of
the late-eighteenth-century saint and
musician Tyagaraja.
Thoreau, Henry David
(1817–1862) American writer and
philosopher, who by his own account
was powerfully influenced by the Hindu
religious text known as the Bhagavad
Gita, particularly the text’s instruction to
perform one’s duties selflessly for the
good of society, without any thought of
personal reward. Thoreau refers to this
text in both Walden and A Week on the
Concord and Merrimack Rivers, and in
letters to his friends, Thoreau talks
about his desire to practice yoga.
[[3]]
HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood
Modern religious organization founded
by Yogi Bhajan; the movement’s two
names reflect differing emphases in the
phases in Yogi Bhajan’s teaching. His ini-
tial teachings were the traditional disci-
plines of hatha yoga and kundalini
yoga, with his followers organized into a
group known as the Happy, Healthy,
Holy Organization (3HO). Hatha yoga is a
system of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas; this practice is widely
believed to provide various physical
benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Kundalini yoga is the religious
discipline whose primary focus is awak-
ening the kundalini, the latent spiritual
force that exists in every person in the
subtle body. The kundalini is awakened
through a combination of yoga practice
and ritual action and is believed to bring
further spiritual capacities and final lib-
eration (moksha) of the soul.
These two disciplines remain an
important part of Yogi Bhajan’s teach-
ings, for he claims to be a master of
tantra, a secret, ritually based religious
practice. In the 1970s his teaching
widened to include traditional Sikh
teachings and symbols. The most
prominent of these symbols are the “five
[[695]]
Thug
K’s” that all Sikhs are supposed to wear,
so called because each of them begins
with the letter k: uncut hair (kesh), a
comb (kangha), a bangle on the right
wrist (kara), shorts (kacch), and a cere-
monial sword (kirpan). Many of Yogi
Bhajan’s followers keep the Sikh symbols
far more strictly than most people born
as Sikhs, but the movement has two
important divergences with the tradi-
tional Sikh community. One of these is
its emphasis on tantra, which has little
importance in the Sikh community. The
most significant difference, however, is
the religious authority that Yogi Bhajan
holds over his followers, which is very
different from the decentralized, essen-
tially democratic form of the traditional
Sikh community.
Thug
In the colonialist mythology describing
the savagery of the East and the demonic
qualities of Hinduism, one of the most
compelling stories is that of the Thugs, a
group of robbers who were devotees
(bhakta) of the goddess Kali. According
to popular belief, the Thugs were wide-
spread throughout India and frequented
the highways, seeking travelers as their
prey. They would travel with their vic-
tims, sometimes for days on end, and
then kill them—sometimes after giving
them sweets laced with drugs, and
sometimes simply by taking them by
surprise. The victims would be strangled
with a silken scarf, and whenever possi-
ble, no blood would be shed, for the vic-
tims’ blood was considered an offering
to the goddess Kali and thus should not
be spilled and wasted. The victims’
worldly possessions were claimed by the
Thugs themselves, in a division of the
spoils between deity and devotee. This
demonic practice persisted until the
[[1830]]
s, when it was finally uprooted and
destroyed by the British.
Although the tale of the Thugs makes
a gripping story, much of it has been dis-
pelled by more careful recent scholar-
ship. One of the major factors in the rise
of the Thugs was the radical economic
[[696]]

dislocation caused by the arrival of the
British themselves. Many of the people
marginalized by these forces took to
wandering and, in their desperation,
resorted to banditry. These small-scale
and essentially local depredations were
transformed into a widespread religious
conspiracy. The myth of the Thugs cer-
tainly showed concern about the pre-
vailing law-and-order situation in
central India, but it may also have
reflected British colonial fears about
their ability to control their territory.
Even though there are references to the
Thugs in texts predating British contact,
on the whole, this was one of the more
enduring colonial stereotypes. For fur-
ther information see C. A. Bayly, Indian
Society and the Making of the British
Empire, 1988; and The Raj, 1990.
Thursday
(Brhaspativar) The fifth day of the week,
whose presiding planet is Jupiter
(Brhaspati). Since in Hindu mythology
the sage Brhaspati is the religious pre-
ceptor (guru) of the gods, another com-
mon name for Thursday is Guruvar. In
Hindu astrology (jyotisha) Jupiter is an
extremely powerful planet, and because
in religious life one’s spiritual preceptor
is often likened to a god, this makes
Thursday a ritually important and pow-
erful day. One of the “deities” to be hon-
ored and served on this day is one’s
religious preceptor.
Another deity worshiped on this day
is the goddess Lakshmi, who is wor-
shiped mainly by women. Lakshmi is
the wife of the god Vishnu and the
embodiment of wealth, prosperity, and
good fortune, which she brings with her
wherever she goes and removes when
she leaves. As the human counterpart to
Lakshmi, married women worship her
to obtain these things or to retain them
if they already have them. Because it is
well known that good fortune is not per-
manent and can often change, Lakshmi
is also seen as a capricious and some-
what fickle divine presence. One of the
taboos for women, at least in parts ofTilak, Bal Gangadhar
northern India, is changing their jewelry
on that day because this is said to annoy
Lakshmi and raise the danger that she
might depart because of her vexation.
Tiger
In Hindu mythology, a tiger or lion is the
animal vehicle of the powerful forms of
the Goddess, such as Durga. Modern
iconography shows both lions and tigers
with no apparent difference between
them, perhaps reflecting the fact that
the Hindi word sher can refer to either
animal. In either case, the fact that the
Goddess rides such a dangerous animal
is clearly a symbol of her power and
capacity, because in her mythology
these animals are often described as her
allies, doing battle on her part in
response to her command.
Tika
In modern Hindi, a word denoting
either a commentary on a text or a col-
ored mark (often red vermilion) on one’s
forehead. These forehead marks are
applied for various reasons: for sheer
ornamentation, to indicate sectarian
affiliation, or as an outward symbol of
having worshiped in a temple that day
(since a common element in this wor-
ship is to receive some of the vermilion
daubed on the feet of the deity’s image,
as a sign of grace and one’s subordinate
status). The former of these two mean-
ings is the original sense of the word, but
the latter meaning is far more common
in contemporary times. The connection
between these two meanings could be
the notion that just as a primary text is
ornamented and highlighted by a com-
mentary, in the same way a forehead
mark could ornament the body.
Tilak
A mark on the forehead, also colloquially
known as a tika, made from colored
powders mixed with oil, sandalwood
paste, or cosmetics. These forehead
marks are applied for various reasons:
for sheer ornamentation, to indicate
This ascetic’s tika markings indicate that he

sectarian affiliation, or as an outward
symbol of having worshiped in a temple
that day. See tika.
Tilak, Bal Gangadhar
(1856–1920) Maharashtrian political
activist who was once characterized as
“the father of Indian unrest.” Unlike his
Maharashtrian contemporaries Ranade
and Gokhale, who stressed working
within existing institutions, Tilak never
compromised his conviction that the
British had no right to rule India. He
resigned from Gokhale’s reformist group
in 1890 and devoted himself to educat-
ing and organizing ordinary people in
Maharashtra. One vehicle for such
organizing comprised two newspapers,
one written in English and one in
Marathi. The other involved organizing
and promoting two new festivals. One
of these festivals was devoted to
the Maratha king Shivaji, a regional
hero who had spent his life fighting
[[697]]
Time
domination by the Moghul empire. The
other festival was Ganesh Chaturthi,
which Tilak promoted as a visible way to
assert and celebrate a Hindu nationalist
identity during the time of British impe-
rial rule. Given British power, outright
rebellion was simply impossible, and
the British government heavily restricted
all forms of political dissent. The Ganesh
festival provided a way to circumvent
these restrictions because the British
had a long-standing policy of not inter-
fering with religious observances. Tilak
was imprisoned several times on the
charge of inciting political assassina-
tions, but he always returned directly to
the political fray. Aside from his political
agitation, his greatest intellectual work
is a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,
a religious text, in which he stresses the
need for this-worldly activism to defeat
evil, including violence if necessary. See
also Moghul dynasty.

tional Hindu culture, see cosmic time,
calendar, and lunar month.
Tirruppavai
One of the two collections of poetry
composed by the poet-saint Andal
(9th c.), the other being the Nacciyar
Tirumoli. Andal was the only woman
among the Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. Andal’s chosen deity was
Ranganatha, the particular form of
Vishnu presiding at the temple of
Shrirangam, yet both collections of her
poetry are dedicated to Krishna, a dif-
ferent form of Vishnu.
This seeming divergence may reflect
her conviction that all manifestations of
[[698]]

Vishnu were the same or else may indi-
cate a difference between personal
devotion and literary expression.
Ranganatha was a specific form of
Vishnu presiding over a specific place—
which at the time was true for
most southern Indian temples—whereas
Krishna was a form of Vishnu for whom
there was already a large body
of literature, but who was not geograph-
ically limited. The contents of the
Tirruppavai are poems of separation in
which Andal mourns the absence of
Krishna, using the language and images
of the forlorn lover, feverishly hoping for
Krishna’s return.
Tirtha
(“crossing place”) The most general
name for any holy place. Just as a ford on
a riverbank provides a safe place to cross
from one side to the other, in the same
way a tirtha provides a way for one to
“cross over” from mundane life to a
sanctified one or, on an even greater
scale, to “cross over” from this ephemeral
and ever changing world to the
unchanging, blissful, final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Many tirthas are
actual places—and many of them are on
the shores of India’s sacred rivers, partic-
ularly the Ganges—and in its most col-
loquial meaning, the word tirtha
connotes a pilgrimage place. Yet the tra-
ditional pilgrimage literature is emphatic
that tirthas are not just restricted to
mere physical places: The word can also
refer to holy people (such as ascetics,
saints, gurus, and sages) as well as to
virtues such as charity, wisdom, com-
passion, and purity of heart.
A tirtha is first and foremost a place
or thing that gives one access to sanctity
and religious power, and in the case of
the physical places (rivers, mountains,
cities, temples, or images), this power is
accessible to all. Such holy places are
seen not only as giving easier access to
the divine but also as being areas where
religious merit is more readily and
bountifully obtained. When one surveys
the literature connected with certainTirthayatra
areas, one of the most common themes
is the claim that the merit from religious
acts performed at place X (the physical
tirtha) equals that of a thousand (or a
million, or a billion) such religious acts
done in ordinary places. The rarefied
atmosphere at tirthas has a similar effect
on evil acts, multiplying their conse-
quences manifold. In this way the action
of a tirtha can be compared to that of a
microphone; just as a microphone mag-
nifies any sound, whether harsh or
pleasant, in the same way a tirtha mag-
nifies, for good or ill, the conse-
quences of any action. The pilgrimage
literature thus commonly reminds peo-
ple of the religious merit that their acts
can bring, and it warns them that care-
less or evil actions can have equally
severe consequences. For this reason,
people performing religious pilgrimage
(tirthayatra) were encouraged to live an
austere, self-conscious life, both to save
themselves from any lapses and to make
the journey a self-conscious process of
transformation. For further information
see Diana Eck, Banaras, 1999; E. Alan
Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984; A. W. Entwistle, Braj,

Journeys, 1988; and Peter van der Veer,
Gods on Earth, 1988.
Tirtha Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva. The Dashanamis were
supposedly established by the ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya,
in an effort to create a corps of learned
men who could help revitalize Hindu
life. Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case, tirtha
(“sacred site”). On initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in
one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Tirtha
Dashanamis belong to the Kitawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Sharada math in the city of Dwaraka,
on the shore of the Arabian Sea. The
Tirtha division is unique in that it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins. (The other such divisions are
Saraswati, Ashrama, and part of the
Bharati order.)
Tirtha Shraddha
Name for a particular type of shraddha
(ancestral memorial rite) performed
when visiting a pilgrimage place
(tirtha). A shraddha has two major fea-
tures: symbolically feeding one’s ances-
tor(s) by offering balls of cooked grain
(pindas), and feeding real food to a
group of brahmins representing one’s
ancestors. Tirtha shraddhas belong to a
class of action known as occasional
actions (naimittika karma) because
they are incumbent only under certain
conditions. Under ordinary circum-
stances one would not have to perform
this action, but it becomes required
when one visits a pilgrimage place. The
traditional pilgrimage literature, much
of it clearly written by the brahmins who
received such meals and other gifts, is
emphatic that this obligation should not
be neglected.
Tirthayatra
(“Journey to a tirtha”) The general term
denoting religious pilgrimage, which is
seen as an act generating considerable
religious merit (punya). The major focus
of such travel was a visit to a “crossing
place” (tirtha), a sacred site or person
through which one could more easily
communicate with the worlds beyond.
One of the major themes in the tradi-
tional pilgrimage literature was the
inherent holiness of whatever place was
being described at that time, which
was invariably described as bringing
[[699]]
Tiruchendur

incalculable benefits, even for actions
performed unknowingly or in jest. A sec-
ond and seemingly contradictory theme
was the stress on the inner state of the
pilgrims themselves and the warning
that they would gain no benefits unless
they were serious about their visit. In its
ideal, pilgrimage to the holy places was
not a pleasure tour but a vehicle for spir-
itual development, through bathing
(snana) in holy rivers, visiting and wor-
shiping powerful deities, enduring
hardships, making offerings to the
ancestors, gift-giving, and living a sober,
disciplined life.
In fact, the traditional literature
affirms both sides of this tension—the
need for individual commitment and
the inherent sanctity of the places them-
selves—although the emphasis may
shift depending on the needs of the
moment. One explanation, combining
both of these themes, is that these holy
places amplified the effects of all of one’s
actions there, whether good or bad.
Pilgrims were thus encouraged to
[[700]]

benefit from performing meritorious
actions but warned of the heightened
consequences from evil deeds, which
were much more severe than normal.
In earlier times pilgrimage required a
large investment of time and money.
People would often spend months or
years on pilgrimage, usually visiting a
series of pilgrimage places. This was
seen as a religiously meritorious use of
one’s money, a notion still current in
contemporary times. For most people,
such an opportunity would come only
once in their lifetime, generally in their
later years, and this long-awaited fulfill-
ment must have heightened their expe-
rience. The advent of railroad travel in
the late 1800s largely reshaped this pat-
tern, although it persisted in the
Himalayas until well into the twentieth
century. With the advent of railroad travel,
people were able to visit places with
relative ease and speed. This conve-
nience encouraged multiple visits, but
also ones in which the person stopped
at fewer places on the way.
The most recent change in pilgrim-
age patterns has come with the develop-
ment of tourism, which is being
marketed by state governments as a way
to generate income for the local people.
It cannot be denied that “seeing the
sights” has always been a part of pil-
grimage, which provided a religiously
sanctioned motive for travel. Yet the
ideal, then as now, was that this journey
should not be undertaken merely for
enjoyment, but for serious purposes.
Some contemporary Hindus worry that
the growth of tourism has commercial-
ized the sanctity of their holy places;
other more sanguine souls consider the
stress on tourism simply a stronger
manifestation of trends that have always
existed, which will have no effect on the
truly pious.
Tiruchendur
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bay of Bengal in Tamil Nadu, sixty miles
up the coast from Kanyakumari.
Tiruchendur is part of the network of sixTirumalai Nayak
temples in Tamil Nadu built to honor
Murugan, a hill deity who has been
assimilated into the larger pantheon as a
form of the god Skanda, the son of
Shiva. Five of these temples have been
definitively identified, and each is asso-
ciated with a particular region, a specific
ecosystem, and a particular incident in
Murugan’s mythic career. In the case of
Tiruchendur, it is said to be where he
killed a demon enemy and thus presents
him in his warrior aspect. The sixth of
these temples is said to be every other
shrine to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The
cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic vehi-
cle for Tamil pride and identity, and
because the number six has connota-
tions of completeness—as in the six
directions or the six chakras in the sub-
tle body—it also connotes that nothing
outside is needed. For further informa-
tion see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of
Murukan,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
Tiruchirappalli
City on the Cauvery River in the central
part of the state of Tamil Nadu, and the
capital of the district with the same
name. The city’s strategic position
meant that it was contested by various
southern Indian dynasties, of which the
most recent were the Nayaks of
Madurai, who built an imposing fort
on a stone outcrop in the center of the
city. It is most famous, however, for
the great temples of Shrirangam and
Jambukeshvar, both of which are on an
island in the Cauvery, north of the city.
The former is a temple to the god
Vishnu, which has important symbolic
associations with southern Indian kings
and kingship; the latter is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his aspect as “Lord of
the Rose-Apple (jambu) Tree.”
Tirukkural
One of the most important pieces of
early Tamil literature, along with the
slightly later Naladiyar. The Tirukkural
Depiction of Tirumalai Nayak.
is a collection of brief verses on reli-
gious, social, and moral life, organized
according to various themes; it is attrib-
uted to the poet Tiruvalluvar and is
believed to have been written late in the
fifth century. The Tirukkural’s underly-
ing assumptions are theistic, and in this
it differs from the Naladiyar, the tone of
which is primarily ethical, with no men-
tion of divinity. Many of these epigrams
have become proverbial expressions in
Tamil and have become the cultural
property of Tamils from all religious
communities. See also Tamil language
and Tamil epics.
Tirumalai Nayak
(r. 1623–1659) Greatest ruler in the
southern Indian Nayak dynasty, who
took advantage of the collapse of the
Vijayanagar dynasty to rule much of
modern Tamil Nadu from the capital
city of Madurai. The peace and prosper-
ity during Tirumalai’s reign was
expressed with two large pieces of mon-
umental architecture—his royal palace,
[[701]]
Tirumalisai
and the enormous Minakshi temple,
named after the goddess considered to
be Madurai’s patron deity. Interestingly,
the temple was the real ritual center of
the city, as is clearly shown by its place-
ment and the processional streets sur-
rounding it.their truth or falsity, these stories reveal
a great deal about the passionate
devotional commitment of his time.

TirumalisaiTirunavukkarashu
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tirumalisai was the son of a sage and a
celestial nymph (apsara), who was
abandoned by his parents at birth. He
was found and raised by a man of very
humble status who called his foster son
by the name of their village. For further
information see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil
Literature, 1975.(7th c.) This was the given name of the
Nayanar poet-saint most commonly
referred to as Appar (“father”). Appar
was one of the earliest of the Nayanars, a
group of sixty-three southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and who lived in south-
ern India in the seventh and eighth cen-
turies. Along with their contemporaries
the Alvars, who were devotees of
Vishnu, the Nayanars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion through
their passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language.
Tirumangai
(9th c.) By far the most picturesque of
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between the
seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. According to
tradition, Tirumangai was born into a
caste of thieves, and theft, robbery, and
deceit play an important role in the sto-
ries associated with him. One story
reports that after taking a vow to feed
[[1]]
,008 Vaishnavas for a year, he resorted
to highway robbery to raise the neces-
sary funds; on another occasion he took
to robbery to raise funds to enlarge the
temple at Shrirangam. In these and
other works, he had the continual help
of Vishnu, his chosen deity; regardless of

Tirupati
Town in the far southern part of the state
of Andhra Pradesh, about 160 miles
northwest of Madras. It is most famous
for the Holy Hill (Tirumalai) eight miles
to the north, which is the location of the
temple to Venkateshvara and for which
Tirupati is the major gateway.
Tirupati/Tirumalai Devasthanam
Official name for the managing commit-
tee of the Venkateshvara temple, near
the town of Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh. This temple is the
richest one in India, based largely on the
popular belief that any wish made in the
deity’s presence will invariably come
true. In earlier times all of the temple
receipts were taken by the priests run-
ning the temple, but since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947, the temple
committee has been responsible for
them. The committee has channeled
these funds into hundreds of charities,
but particularly into education and tem-
ple building: the former in schools fromTiruttontar Puranam
the primary to the university level, and
the latter in providing the funds to help
build many of the larger Hindu temples
in the United States and Europe.
Tiruppan
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tiruppan was a foundling who was
adopted by a musician. As he grew up,
he developed deep devotion for Vishnu
in his form as Ranganatha at the temple
of Shrirangam, but because his family
status was unknown, he never went into
the temple itself out of fear that his pres-
ence might render it impure. Tiruppan
finally gained entrance when one of the
temple’s brahmin priests, who had ear-
lier insulted him, received a divine com-
mand to carry Tiruppan on his
shoulders to Ranganatha’s image. As
with many stories in the lives of the
bhakti saints, the lesson here clearly
emphasizes the superiority of devotion
over birth. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;
and John Stirling Morley Hooper, Hymns
of the Alvars, 1929.
Tirupparankunram
Tirtha (sacred site) ten miles southwest
of Madurai in central Tamil Nadu.
Tirupparankunram is famous for one of
the six temples in Tamil Nadu built to
honor Murugan, a hill deity assimilated
into the pantheon as a form of Skanda.
It is said to be where he marries
Devasena, the bride given by Indra and
the gods after he has proven his mettle
in battle, and thus reflects his accep-
tance into the larger pantheon. Five of
these temples are definitively identified
and scattered throughout the state, but
the sixth is said to be every other shrine
to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The cult of
Murugan is thus a symbolic vehicle for
Tamil pride and identity, and because
the number six has connotations of
completeness—as in the six directions,
or the six chakras in the subtle body—it
also connotes that nothing outside is
needed. For further information see
Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage Centers in the
Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in Journal of
the American Academy of Religion, Vol.
[[40]]
, No. 1, 1972.
Tiruttani
Tirtha (sacred site) in the hills of Tamil
Nadu, seventy-five miles of Madras. It is
famous for one of the six temples in
Tamil Nadu built to honor Murugan, a
hill deity assimilated into the pantheon
as a form of Skanda. Tiruttani is cele-
brated as the place where he marries his
tribal bride Valli, which gives him a fam-
ily connection with southern India. Five
of these temples are definitively identi-
fied and scattered throughout the state,
but the sixth is said to be every other
shrine to Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The
cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic vehi-
cle for Tamil pride and identity, and
because the number six has connota-
tions of completeness—as in the six
directions or the six chakras in the sub-
tle body—it also connotes that nothing
outside is needed. For further informa-
tion see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage

Tiruttontar Puranam
(“history of the holy servants [of Shiva]”)
Another name for the Periya Purana, a
hagiographical account (an idealizing
biography of saints or venerated figures)
of the lives of the sixty-three Nayanars,
written by the twelfth-century figure
Cekkilar. The Nayanars were a group of
Shaiva poet-saints who lived in southern
India in the seventh and eighth cen-
turies. See Periya Purana.
[[703]]
Tiruvachakam
Tiruvachakam
(“holy utterances”) Collection of poetry
composed in the ninth century by the
Tamil poet-saint Manikkavachakar,
who was a passionate devotee (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. Manikkavachakar’s
work comes in the tradition of the
Nayanars (a group of sixty-three Shaiva
poet-saints who lived in southern India
in the seventh and eighth centuries),
although he is not counted as one of
them because he was about a century
later than the last Nayanar, Sundara-
murtti. The hymns in the Tiruvachakam
bear witness to Manikkavachakar’s
intense devotion to Shiva, and in their
devotional fervor, they can be seen as
the culmination of the earlier devotional
(bhakti) tradition. Manikkavachakar’s
hymns are also the basis for the devel-
opment of the philosophical tradition
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, which
makes Manikkavachakar a pivotal figure
in southern Indian Shaivism. For further
information see Glenn Yocum, Hymns to
the Dancing Siva, 1982. See also Tamil
language and Tamil epics.
Tiruvalluvar
(5th–6th c.) According to tradition, the
author of the Tirukkural, one of the
most important pieces of early Tamil lit-
erature. The Tirukkural is a collection of
brief verses on religious, social, and
moral life, organized according to vari-
ous themes. Many of these epigrams
have become proverbial expressions in
Tamil and have become the cultural
property of Tamils from all religious
communities. See also Tamil language
and Tamil epics.
Tiruvannamalai
Temple town and sacred site (tirtha) in
the northern part of the state of Tamil
Nadu, about 100 miles southwest of
Madras, the capital. Tiruvannamalai is
most famous as a temple to the god
Shiva in his form as Arunachaleshvar,
“the Lord of Arunachal [Hill],” the
hill on which the temple is built.
[[704]]

Tiruvannamalai is also one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a net-
work of five southern Indian sites sacred
to Shiva. In each of these sites, Shiva is
worshiped as a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form, and at
each site the linga is believed to be formed
from one of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). Tiruvannamalai’s linga is
associated with the primordial element
of fire, making this an extremely
powerful image. Aside from the image
and the temple, Tiruvannamalai is also
famous as the place in which the mod-
ern Indian saint Ramana Maharshi
spent most of his life, from 1896 until his
death in 1950.
Tiruvaymoli
(“Holy words”) Collection of 1,102
stanzas written in the tenth century
by the poet-saint Nammalvar.
Nammalvar was one of the Alvars, a
group of twelve poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. All of the Alvars
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized
Hindu
religious
life.
Nammalvar’s Tiruvaymoli is an out-
pouring of ecstatic Vaishnava devo-
tionalism and forms the concluding
section of the Nalayira Divya-
prabandham, the collected composi-
tions of the Alvars. For further
information see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil

Tiruvayur
Southern Indian temple town about
thirty-five miles east of the city of
Tanjore in the state of Tamil Nadu. The
town is most famous for an enormousTortoise Avatar
temple to the god Shiva, and as with
many southern Indian temples, the tem-
ple is located in the heart of the city and
forms a substantial part of the city itself.
Tithi
A lunar day, that is to say, one of the thirty
days occurring during a single lunar
month, from full moon to full moon.
Because these thirty lunar days take
place in about twenty-eight solar days,
each lunar day is thus slightly shorter
than a solar day. Even in contemporary
times, most Hindu religious obser-
vances are determined by the lunar cal-
endar, which makes the determination
of these lunar days an important matter.
Most people keep track of these holidays
with a panchang, an almanac that gives
all the lunar days.
Toddy Palm
Palm tree that is both the source of the
slightly fermented beverage tapped
from its sap known as toddy, and the
long, flat leaves that were traditionally
used for writing down all sorts of texts,
including religious ones. The former use
led this tree to be considered unclean,
since alcoholic beverages are proscribed
in “respectable” Hindu society; the man-
uscripts written on the leaves, however,
could be the holiest of texts. The poet-
saint Ravidas uses this palm to illustrate
how the power of the divine name can
transform something normally believed
to be base and vile. In doing so he is also
referring to himself, who as a tanner and
leather worker was believed to be
defiled because his work involves han-
dling the skins of dead animals.
Tondaradippodi
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All of the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life. According to tradition,
Tondaradippodi was born as a brahmin
named Vipra Narayana, and his family’s
hereditary labor was to arrange the flow-
ers for the worship of Ranganatha, a
form of Vishnu who is the presiding
deity at the temple of Shrirangam. He
became enamored of a courtesan who
cast her spell on him, and for a time paid
attention to nothing else. In the end he
was saved by Ranganatha, to whom
Vipra Narayana devoted himself for the
rest of his life, taking as a symbol of this
his new name (“Dust of the Feet of the
Slaves [of God]”). For further informa-
tion see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature,
[[1975]]
; and John Stirling Morley Hooper,
Hymns of the Alvars, 1929.
Tortoise Avatar
Second avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,
the Tortoise avatar came into being in a
time of crisis and served to restore the
cosmic balance that had been thrown
out of equilibrium. In this case the
source of trouble was the sage
Durvasas, who had cursed the gods to
become mortal and their heavenly lus-
ter to fade. To counter this, the gods
made a pact with the demons that they
would jointly churn the Ocean of Milk to
obtain the nectar of immortality, which
would be equally divided.
The image of churning here is based
on traditional dairy practices, in which
the person churning uses a string to
rotate a churning paddle. In this
instance, however, the churning takes
place on a cosmic scale: The churning
stick is Mount Mandara, the mountain
that is at the center of the earth; the
churning string is the divine serpent
Vasuki, who encircles the world; and
Vishnu himself, in the form of a tortoise,
dives to the bottom of the ocean to pro-
vide a stable base for the churning stick.
The gods and demons pull Vasuki back
and forth, spinning the mountain and
churning the Ocean of Milk. The churn-
ing separates the Ocean of Milk into

Tota Puri
The god Vishnu’s Tortoise avatar. He takes this
form to help the gods regain their immortality.
various components, both good and
bad. One product is the deadly halahala
poison, which is neutralized by having
Shiva hold it in his throat. Some of the
other products are the Kaustubha jewel,
the wishing cow Surabhi, the goddess
Lakshmi, and finally the physician of
the gods, Dhanvantari, who emerges
from the sea bearing the pot containing
the nectar of immortality.
The demons grab the pot of nectar
and begin to escape, but Vishnu takes
the form of the enchantress Mohini and
beguiles the demons into giving the pot
back to her. She gives the pot to the
gods, who take off with the demons in
hot pursuit. According to more recent
traditions, in their flight the gods stop at
four different holy places on earth—
Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and
Nasik—over a twelve-(divine) day span;
this latter incident is cited as the charter
myth for the celebration of the Kumbha
Mela at these sites on a twelve-year
basis (because a divine day is believed to
equal a human year).
The gods finally manage to escape
their pursuers and divide the nectar
among themselves, but they fail to
notice that the demon Sainhikeya slips
[[706]]

into their midst in disguise. As the
demon begins to drink, the sun and
moon alert Vishnu, who uses his discus
to cut off the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s
two halves become immortal because
they have come into contact with the
nectar, and both halves are considered
malevolent celestial beings: the head as
Rahu, the body as Ketu. Rahu has par-
ticular enmity for the sun and moon,
since these deities are responsible for
his demise, and tries to swallow them
whenever he meets them in the heav-
ens. He always succeeds, but because he
no longer has a body to digest them,
they escape unharmed through Rahu’s
severed neck. This, of course, is the tra-
ditional explanation for solar and lunar
eclipses; the association with the malev-
olent Rahu has thus led eclipses to be
seen as highly inauspicious times. See
also ocean, churning of the.
Tota Puri
An ascetic initiated into the Puri order
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, as can be
seen from his surname. Tota Puri was
one of the teachers of the Bengali saint
Ramakrishna, who appeared to instruct
Ramakrishna in Advaita Vedanta as part
of the latter’s continuing exposure to
many different types of religious prac-
tice. In his earlier religious practice,
Ramakrishna had been a fervent devo-
tee (bhakta) of the goddess Kali, where-
as the Advaita Vedanta philosophy
claims that behind all things lies a single
impersonal reality that has no defining
attributes except for being, conscious-
ness, and bliss (sacchidananda). In the
Advaita understanding, because all con-
ceptions of particular deities have spe-
cific attributes, they are thus conditioned
forms of the ultimate Brahman
(Supreme Reality).
Although this conception ran
counter to his own previous experience,
Ramakrishna
practiced
diligently
under Tota Puri’s direction. When
Ramakrishna attained enlightenment
through the practices of Advaita, he
discovered that the essence of thisTribhanga
experience was the same as that gained
from his earlier devotional practices.
This inner experience of identity was
a pivotal experience for Ramakrishna
and reinforced his conviction that all
forms of religious practice led the seeker
to the same place. After Ramakrishna’s
experience of enlightenment, Tota
Puri disappeared.immature person. Traditional wisdom is
unanimous that a person should not
consciously seek such powers, because
the very act of seeking is seen as being
rooted in selfish desires. In contrast,
when one has gained such powers as a
byproduct of spiritual attainment, one is
believed to be able to keep them in
proper perspective.
Transcendental MeditationTreta Yuga
Religious organization founded by
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose teach-
ings on meditation comprise its major
thrust. As its name would indicate,
Transcendental Meditation (TM) stresses
the multiple benefits of meditation: For
the individual, it promotes physical,
mental, and spiritual health, whereas for
the larger environment, it is claimed to
have pacific effects, resulting in reduced
crime and hatred. All of these results can
be obtained only by diligent practice,
but the initiation itself is easy to
obtain—all one has to do is to attend a
seminar sponsored by a TM instructor
and pay the required fee to obtain one’s
mantra, or sacred utterance. In more
recent years, TM has offered programs
leading to the acquisition of super-
human powers (siddhis) at its head-
quarters at Maharishi International
University in Fairfield, Iowa. The claims
of these programs have been toned
down since a disgruntled buyer—who
had been unable to learn to levitate—
won a lawsuit for damages.
Although meditation and the use of
mantras are well-established Hindu
practices, many traditional Hindus are
uncomfortable with other elements of
TM’s marketing. One controversial point
is the practice of buying (or selling) a
mantra, which was traditionally trans-
mitted from teacher (guru) to disciple
only after significant association. A
similar problem comes from the notion
that one can buy and sell superhuman
powers. These powers are seen as highly
seductive because they can be used for
both good and evil and as having
the potential to destroy a spirituallyA particular age of the world in cosmic
time. According to traditional belief,
time has neither a beginning nor an end,
but alternates between cycles of cre-
ation and activity, followed by cessation
and quietude. Each of these cycles lasts
for 4.32 billion years, with the active
phase known as the Day of Brahma, and
the quiet phase as the Night of Brahma.
In cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is
divided into one thousand mahayugas
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each
mahayuga is composed of four con-
stituent yugas (cosmic ages), named the
Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga,
and Kali Yuga. Each of these four yugas
is shorter than its predecessor and ush-
ers in an era more degenerate and
depraved. By the end of the Kali Yuga,
things have gotten so bad that the only
solution is the destruction and recre-
ation of the earth, at which time the
next Krta era begins.
The Treta Yuga is the second of the
four yugas, lasting for 1,296,000 years.
Although the Treta Age is still relatively
auspicious, it is less so than the Krta
Age, symbolized by its identification
with the metal silver—not as valuable as
the gold associated with the preceding
Krta Yuga, but more valuable than the
bronze and iron associated with the two
following yugas. In popular belief the
Treta Yuga is believed to be the time
when the god Rama reigned on earth.
Tribhanga
(“three breaks”) Name denoting one of
the best-known poses in Indian dance
[[707]]
Tridosha
and sculpture, in which the line of the
body has three distinct breaks, or
changes in direction. In this pose, the
body’s weight is mainly supported on
one foot, with the corresponding
knee and shoulder inclined toward
one side and the hips inclined in the
opposite direction.
Tridosha
In ayurveda, the term for the set of three
bodily humours, vata (“air”), pitta
(“bile”), and kapha (“phlegm”). Each of
these humours is associated with cer-
tain physiological tendencies, particu-
larly with regard to digestion and
metabolism. Every person has all three
of these humours, although one of them
is generally dominant. In a healthy per-
son the three humours are in general
equilibrium, but an imbalance can lead
to illness or chronic health problems.
The solution to these lies in regaining
the proper balance between the doshas,
or humours, for which one of the major
solutions is eating a proper diet.
Trika
Kashmiri religious community whose
members were devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; the greatest figure in the
Trika school was the tenth-century
philosopher and aesthetic theorist
Abhinavagupta. Trika Shaivism is a
tantric tradition—that is, a secret, ritually
based religious practice—whose philo-
sophical underpinnings merge two
philosophical positions, theism and
monism. Theism is the notion that a
divinity is the Supreme Reality in the
universe, whereas monism conceives a
more abstract principle as the basis of
all reality. For Trika Shaivism, the sole
true reality is the god Shiva, who is both
Supreme God and the source for emana-
tions from which the material universe
is formed. Final liberation of the soul
(moksha) comes through a process of
“recognition” (pratyabhijna), in which
one realizes that the entire universe is
nothing but a manifestation of Shiva
[[708]]

alone. Here one “recognizes” something
that has always been true but until that
time had been obscured by a mistaken
understanding. For further information
see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The
Triadic Heart of Siva, 1989. See also
tantra and Shaiva.
Trilochan
(15th c.?) A sant poet who is generally
associated with the poet-saint Namdev.
The name sant is an umbrella term for a
loose group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who shared several
general tendencies: a stress on individu-
alized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; a
disdain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; a faith in the power of
the divine name; and a tendency to
ignore conventional caste distinctions.
Trilochan’s only existing poems are a few
verses in the Adigranth, the sacred
scripture of the Sikh community. These
verses describe his devotion to Vithoba,
the presiding deity of the temple at
Pandharpur in Maharashtra, who was
also Namdev’s chosen deity. Thus, the
poems seem consistent with Maha-
rashtrian origins. Trilochan is also men-
tioned as a devotee (bhakta) by other
bhakti poets, most notably by the poet-
saint Ravidas.
Trimbak
Sacred site (tirtha) at the headwaters of
the Godavari River, in the Nasik district
of the state of Maharashtra. Trimbak is
famous as the site for Tryambakeshvar,
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, the most
sacred spot for devotees (bhakta) of the
god Shiva.
Trimurti
(“three forms”) The three deities of
Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, often repre-
sented as three faces on a single image, to
symbolize the ultimate identity of all three
forms of divinity and divine activity:
Brahma as creator, Vishnu as preserver
and sustainer, and Shiva as destroyer.Tripurari
Triphala
Another name for the Urdhvapundra,
the characteristic forehead mark of
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. Although
there is considerable variation, the basic
form is three vertical lines, in contrast to
the three horizontal lines worn by
Shaivite ascetics. See Urdhvapundra.
Tripundra
Sectarian mark of three horizontal lines,
most commonly applied to the forehead
but which can also be applied to the
back, heart, shoulders, arms, and legs.
The tripundra marks the person wearing
it as a devotee (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
and although this mark is most com-
monly worn by renunciant ascetics,
householders also wear it. According to
one interpretation, the three lines repre-
sent the three prongs of Shiva’s trident;
according to another, they symbolize
Shiva’s third eye. The three lines are
drawn by dipping the first three fingers of
the right hand into a sacred ash known as
vibhuti (“power”) and then drawing
them across the forehead. In earlier times
vibhuti was made from wood ash that
had been sifted through cloth until it was
as fine as talcum powder. This is still done
today, primarily by ascetics who usually
use the ash from a dhuni, or smoldering
ascetic fire, which has sacred character-
istics; vibhuti can also be bought in stores
selling religious supplies.
Tripura
(“three cities”) In Hindu mythology, the
triple city built by the three sons of the
demon Taraka: Kamalaksha, Tarakaksha,
and Vidyunmali. Shiva eventually
destroyed the demons’ three cities, and
as a result one of Shiva’s epithets is
Tripurari, the “Enemy of the Three City.”
Tripurari
Epithet of Shiva as the enemy (ari) of the
Triple City (Tripura). According to the
mythic charter, three demons are

three horizontal lines that indicate he
is a devotee of the god Shiva.
dismayed by their continuing defeats at
the hands of the gods, and they begin to
perform harsh asceticism (tapas) to find
the means to counter this. The god
Brahma finally comes to them, willing
to reward them with boons. However,
when the demons learn that absolute
invulnerability is impossible, they lay
down the condition that each of them
should build a city that can move over
the earth, which will come together only
once in a long time, and that these cities
can be destroyed only by a single arrow
that pierces through them all at the
same time.
This boon renders the demons prac-
tically invulnerable, and they proceed to
build three magnificent cities—one of
iron, one of silver, and one of gold. They
grow rich and prosperous, but over time
they are corrupted by power and began
to oppress the earth. Finally the gods
petition Brahma for help, and Brahma
informs them that the only one with the
strength to fulfill this condition is the
god Shiva. The gods build him a bow
and arrow, and when the conjunction of
the three cities takes place, Shiva sends a
[[709]]
Trishanku
single arrow through all three, kindling a
fire that burns the cities and destroys
their inhabitants.
This story illustrates one important
facet of Shiva’s character—unlike the
god Vishnu, who often manages to trick
those he subdues, Shiva is much less
complex and attains his end by using
power against which no one can stand.
In some of the stories, one of the three
demons is himself a devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva, and when the arrow is loosed and
hurtles to destroy the Triple City, Shiva
himself rescues his devotee and his
family. This is in character, for Shiva is
portrayed as gracious to his devotees
and will do just about anything for
them. It also shows that the demons are
conceived not as completely debased
but as another race of beings with
different powers and capacities, and
who have as much potential as deities
and human beings.
Trishanku
(“three sins”) In Hindu mythology, a cel-
ebrated king of the Solar Line. He is
named Satyavrata at birth but is cursed
by the sage Vasishtha to bear the name
Trishanku because of three major sins:
He abducts another man’s wife, he
incurs the anger of his father, and he
eats beef (which he has earlier obtained
by slaughtering Vasishtha’s cow). Along
with this uncomplimentary name,
Vasishtha also curses Trishanku to be a
chandala (untouchable), which Trishanku
suffers for some time before being
restored to his kingship.
After regaining his throne, Trishanku
is a good king, but he desires to be taken
bodily into heaven. Vasishtha and his
sons ridicule this desire, but Trishanku
finds an ally in the sage Vishvamitra,
who has a long history of conflict with
Vasishtha. Vishvamitra performs the
sacrifice to take Trishanku to heaven,
but when he arrives there, he is pushed
back down by Indra, the ruler of heaven,
and Trishanku falls head downward.
Vishvamitra orders Trishanku to remain
where he is, and since Indra will not let
[[710]]

him up and Vishvamitra will not let him
down, he is suspended in midair. Indra
begins to construct a separate heaven
for Trishanku, but when Vishvamitra
threatens to create a new Indra for the
new heaven, Indra relents and takes
Trishanku to heaven in his material
body. The name Trishanku has since
become proverbial to refer to a person
trapped between two options.
Trishiras
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Trishiras is a demon
ally of Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Along with Ravana’s brothers,
Khara and Dushana, Trishiras leads a
frontal attack against the god Rama, the
epic’s protagonist. The attack is an effort
to avenge the insult to Ravana’s sister
Shurpanakha, who has been mutilated
by Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
Although he is a valiant warrior, Trishiras
is eventually killed by Rama, as are
Khara and Dushana. The failure of such
frontal attacks convince Ravana that
Rama is too powerful to kill in combat,
so he decides to take revenge by kidnap-
ping Rama’s wife Sita.
Trishul
(“three points”) The trident, which is
an important weapon associated with
both the god Shiva and the Goddess.
The trident is a modified form of
the spear (shula).
Tristhalisetu
(“The bridge to the Three Holy Cities”)
Pilgrimage text written by the great
scholar Narayana Bhatta (approx.
[[1513]]
–1570) that was intended to give the
readers precise instructions for correctly
performing the pilgrimage rites at three
important sites: Allahabad, a bathing
(snana) place at the junction of the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers; Benares,
which is renowned as a city of culture
and religious learning; and Gaya in
Bihar, a major site for the shraddha
rites for the dead. The text begins with aTryambakeshvar
section devoted to pilgrimage in general,
giving the rules for its performance, and
continues with three sections giving the
prescriptions for pilgrimages to
Allahabad, Benares, and Gaya. The
Tristhalisetu is an important example of
the class of commentarial literature
known as nibandhas (“collections”).
The nibandhas were compendia of
Hindu lore, in which the compilers
culled references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts, and then compiled these
excerpts into a single volume, often with
their own commentary. Narayana
Bhatta was one of the most learned men
of his time, and he was attempting to
define everything precisely, based on his
sources, so that people would know how
to do the right thing. The initial section
of this text has been edited and translated
by Richard Salomon as The Bridge to the
Three Holy Cities, 1985.
Triveni
(“Triple stream”) Traditional epithet for
the confluence of the Ganges and
Yamuna Rivers in the city of Allahabad,
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Although
only two rivers can be seen at the con-
fluence, the name Triveni comes from
the traditional belief that they are joined
by a third river, the Saraswati, which
flows underground and is unseen to the
naked eye.
Trivikrama
(“[taking] Three Steps”) Epithet of the
god Vishnu in his avatar, or incarna-
tion, as a dwarf (Vamana). The name
exists because diminutive Vamana begs
three paces of land from the demon-
king Bali and then grows to such a large
size that these three paces measure out
the universe. See Vamana avatar.
Triyuginarayan
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in
the Mandakini River valley in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas,
fifteen miles down from Kedarnath. The
site for Triyuginarayan is on the top
of a mountain, surrounded by forest.
Triyuginarayan’s major temple is dedi-
cated to the god Vishnu in his form as
Narayana, and in front of the temple is a
pit in which a fire is said to have been
smoldering for the past three cosmic
ages (triyugi). According to its charter
myth, Triyuginarayan is the site at which
the deities Shiva and Parvati were mar-
ried, a ceremony to which this continu-
ously smoldering fire (in its guise as
Agni, the fire-god) stands as the witness.
Trnavarta
In Hindu mythology, Trnavarta is one of
the demon assassins sent by Kamsa, the
demon-king of Mathura, in an attempt
to kill his nephew, the child-god
Krishna. Trnavarta is a whirlwind that
sweeps Krishna up into the air, but
Krishna holds tight to Trnavarta until he
simply blows himself out.
Truth, Power of
In popular Hindu belief, truth is seen as
having magical power of its own, a
power to which people can appeal in
their time of distress. One way of
appealing to this power is through the
famous act of truth, a conditional state-
ment in which the first part is a true
statement about one’s past behavior and
the second part a request for some spe-
cific result (for example, “If I have always
given to those who begged from me,
may this fire not burn me”). The power
of truth was also invoked in trial by
ordeal and was seen as the power
that made the ordeal a valid means of
testing people.
Tryambakeshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
village of Trimbak in the Nasik district
of the state of Maharashtra, at the head-
waters of the Godavari River. The tem-
ple is named for its presiding deity, the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
“Three-Eyed Lord.” Shiva is present at
[[711]]
Tuesday
Tryambakeshvar in the form of a linga,
the pillar-shaped image that is his sym-
bolic form. The Tryambakeshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. The charter myth for
Tryambakeshvar begins with the sage
Gautama, who unwisely hits an old cow
with a stick, killing it, and thus incurs
the sin of cow slaughter. Gautama is told
that to expiate his sin, he first has to
amass enough merit to bring the Ganges
down to earth, and after he has purified
himself by bathing (snana) in the
Ganges, he has to make and worship 10
million Shiva lingas formed from the
sand on its banks. Gautama undertakes
his penance (prayashchitta) diligently.
Upon worshiping the 10 millionth linga
he is rewarded by a vision of Shiva, who
grants his wish that both the Ganges and
Shiva will remain there forever—the for-
mer in her form as the Godavari, the lat-
ter as Tryambakeshvar.
Tuesday
(Mangalvar) The third day of the week,
presided over by the planet Mars
(Mangal). The planet Mars is deemed
inauspicious, both because of its red
color (reminiscent of blood) and
because of its associations with war and
disorder. Tuesday is widely considered
an unlucky day, and many people
abstain from certain kinds of activity on
it. Travel is particularly discouraged
unless absolutely necessary. Cutting the
hair and beard is also discouraged, and
in much of northern India, barbers take
Tuesday off. To counter the day’s poten-
tial inauspiciousness, many people also
perform rites of protection, such as
worshiping strong protective deities
such as Hanuman—who is close
enough to human beings to understand
the problems they face, but divine
enough to be able to protect them.
Paradoxically, the literal meaning of the
name for Tuesday is the “auspicious”
(mangal) day. Giving it this euphemistic
name may simply be a bit of reverse
[[712]]

magic; that if one calls it the lucky day, it
may, in fact, turn out to be.
Tukaram
(1598–1650) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered on the worship of the god
Vithoba, at his temple at Pandharpur in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Tukaram was a
shudra (in traditional Hinduism, there
are four main social groups, the shudras
being the lowest and least influential)
born in the small village of Dehu, where
his father was a petty merchant.
Tukaram continued in the family busi-
ness, which eventually failed because he
had little interest in worldly life. He
longed instead for the life of a renun-
ciant, in which he could completely
devote himself to God. As with many of
the other bhakti saints, he is reported to
have suffered considerable persecution
by traditionally minded brahmins, who
were uneasy about a person of his low
status gaining spiritual greatness. An
unlettered man, he is most famous for
the songs known as abhangs, which are
still widely sung in Maharashtra. He had
many disciples, including the poet-saint
Bahina Bai, and according to tradition,
he ended his life by being taken up to
heaven in a chariot of fire. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba,1960; and Justin E. Abbott
(trans.), The Life of Tukaram, 1980.
Tulsi
A small shrublike plant commonly
denoted the “holy basil.” For devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, the tulsi
plant is a form of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi,
who is cursed to take birth as a plant.
According to the story, Lakshmi sits with
Vishnu’s wives, the goddesses Ganga
and Saraswati. Ganga makes amorous
eyes at Vishnu, and when Saraswati
protests this indecency, a quarrel breaks
out. By the time it is over, Ganga and
Saraswati have cursed each other to be
born on earth as rivers. Vishnu has beenTulsi Vivah
cursed to be born as a stone (the shala-
gram); and Lakshmi, who tries only to
mediate the quarrel, is cursed to be born
as a plant. This plant is thus a form of
Lakshmi, and pious Vaishnavas culti-
vate a tulsi plant as an act of devotion.
The plant is especially dear to Vishnu,
and it is believed that all parts of the
plant are purifying. Any parts of it used
in worship are especially meritorious—
whether grinding the leaves to a paste to
mark one’s body, taking the leaves as
prasad (food offered to a deity as an act
of worship), or using tulsi wood for
implements or sacrificial fuel.
Tulsidas
(1532–1623) Poet-saint and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Rama, whose great-
est work, the Ramcharitmanas, retells
the epic Ramayana in the vernacular
language of his day. According to evi-
dence in his poetry, Tulsidas was born
into a desperately poor brahmin family,
but his life was transformed by the
power of Rama’s name. This can be
taken as a reference to his teacher, who
is believed to have been a Ramanandi,
but it can also be taken literally. Tulsidas
continually stresses that the name of
Rama embodies the divinity’s power and
thus makes that power accessible to
devotees. According to tradition, he
lived a fairly hard life despite his fame,
and because of his emphasis on devo-
tion, he reportedly faced problems from
other brahmins, who were concerned
about maintaining their social status.
As with all of the Ramayana’s vernac-
ular retellings, Tulsidas did not merely
translate the story of Rama but inter-
preted it according to his own religious
convictions. The two most important
shifts are his overwhelming emphasis
on the importance of devotion (bhakti)
and the saving power of the name
of Rama, to which Tulsidas gives
greater importance than Rama himself.
Tulsidas also brings in mythic material
from a variety of other sources, most
notably the Shiva Purana and the
Adhyatmaramayana. This material is
largely added to the first and last chap-
ters, where Tulsidas makes his greatest
changes from the original epic. One the-
ory to explain why Tulsidas brought in
this other material is that he was trying
to transcend narrow sectarian bound-
aries, and a sign of this is that much of
the text is narrated by the god Shiva, in
the form of a dialogue to his wife
Parvati. For part of the final book, Shiva
is supplanted as narrator by the crow
Bhushundi, who symbolizes the power
of devotion to rescue even a common
carrion-eating crow. Aside from the
Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas composed
many other works in varying regional
languages and dedicated to various
deities; the most important are the
Kavitavali, the Vinaya Patrika, the
Ramavali, and the Shrikrishnavali.
Tulsidas himself refers to writing down
his poems, and although the manuscript
tradition is uncertain for some of his
texts, the transition from song to written
text took place much faster than for
most of his contemporary poet-saints,
many of whom were illiterate. For fur-
ther information see F. Raymond Allchin
(trans.), Kavitavali, 1964; W. Douglas P.
Hill (trans.), The Holy Lake of the Acts of
Rama, 1971; and John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs
of the Saints of India, 1988.
Tulsidas Jayanti
Festival falling on the seventh day
of the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Shravan (July–August), cele-
brating the birthday of the medieval
devotional (bhakti) poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623). Tulsidas composed many
different texts, and he is one of the few
medieval poet-saints believed to have
been literate and to have actually writ-
ten down his work. His most celebrated
text is the Ramcharitmanas, a vernacu-
lar retelling of the epic Ramayana.
Tulsi Vivah
Festival marking the marriage of the
goddess Lakshmi and the god Vishnu,
[[713]]
Tumari
the opening, with the remaining top
parts forming the vessel’s handle.
Because of its simplicity and use of read-
ily available materials, the tumari was a
symbol of ascetic life.
Tungabhadra River
Important tributary of the Krishna
River, which has its source in the
Western Ghats in southern Karnataka
and then flows north and east toward
the Krishna. The most important place
on its banks is Hampi, the ruined city
that was the capital of the Vijayanagar
empire. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
Tungnath
Tulsi plant used in Tulsi Vivah festival.
celebrated on the eleventh day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month
of Kartik. It is also celebrated as
Devotthayan Ekadashi. On this day
devotees (bhakta) place a shalagram (a
black stone containing the spiral-
shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea
creature, understood as a “self-mani-
fest” form of Vishnu) in a pot containing
a tulsi plant (considered a form of
Lakshmi). Thus they symbolically unite
Vishnu and Lakshmi and perform the
marriage ceremony for them, complete
with festive songs.
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas in the
valley between the Mandakini and the
Alakananda Rivers, fourteen miles by
footpath north of the village of
Ukhimath. The temple’s presiding deity
is the god Shiva in his manifestation
as the “Lofty Lord.” Tungnath is one of
the Panchkedar, a network of five
sacred sites spread throughout the
Garhwal region; the other four are
Kedarnath, Kalpeshvar, Rudranath,
and Madmaheshvar. This network of
five sites is seen as a symbolic represen-
tation of Shiva’s body, understandably
so, since Shiva is believed to dwell in the
Himalayas. Of these five, Tungnath is
believed to be Shiva’s arm.
Turiya
Tumari
Vessel used by renunciant ascetics. In
earlier times it would have been made of
a gourd, although today the shape is
often replicated in brass or some other
metal. The tumari is taller than it is wide,
with an open top over which the carry-
ing handle arches. Unlike another piece
of ascetic equipment, the kamandalu,
which has both a spout and a covered
top, the tumari is an open vessel. When
made of a gourd, it would simply have
entailed cutting parts off of the top for
[[714]]

(“fourth”) The name for the innermost
quarter of the Self (atman), as described
in the Mandukya Upanishad, one of the
speculative religious texts that form the
latest stratum of the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu sacred texts. As with most of the
Upanishads, the Mandukya Upanishad’s
underlying concern is to investigate
ultimate questions, in particular the
nature of the Self. The upanishad
describes the Self as having four
quarters, each of which removes another
layer of egoism. The first quarter is
waking consciousness, which isTwilight Language
characterized by perceptions of subject
and object; the second is dream
sleep, which is sheer subjectivity; the
third is deep sleep, which has neither
subject nor object; and the last is a
mysterious state simply called “the
fourth” (turiya), which is the Self. This
state is identified as the ultimate truth,
and knowledge of this brings final
liberation of the soul (moksha).
Tvashtr
(“maker of carriages”) In the Vedas, the
oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, Tvashtr is a minor deity
known as the workman of the Vedic
gods. The Vedic hymns frequently men-
tion wheeled chariots as military
devices, and his name’s literal meaning
shows the esteem in which this craft was
held, as the apex of creative work. In the
Vedas, Tvashtr is famous for crafting the
weapons of the gods, especially the
mace with which the storm-god Indra
slays the serpent Vrtra (Rg Veda 1.32). In
later times Tvashtr is identified with
the minor deity Vishvakarma, who in
later Hindu life becomes the architect
and craftsman of the gods. Since Tvashtr
has a much older textual presence
than Vishvakarma, this seems to be
an attempt to identify one divine
workman as another, based on their
similar functions.it was known as the second birth, and
thus the initiates were “twice-born.” The
first birth was biological and based on
nature, whereas the second was cultural
and marked higher religious status.
Although in its strictest sense this word
refers only to such initiates, in a more
general sense it can denote any person
belonging to a varna whose members
are eligible for this initiation—that is,
any brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya.
Twice-BornTwilight Language
(dvija) In its most specific sense,
this word denotes a man from the
highest traditional social groups
(varnas)—brahmin, kshatriya, and
vaishya—who has undergone the ado-
lescent ritual initiation known as the
upanayana samskara. This initiation
gives the entitlement and the obligation
to study the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts, and definitively divides
society between those who have this
entitlement and those who do not—
namely, all children, women, and men not
belonging to these three groups. Because
of this initiation’s ritual significance,
Sadhu carrying a tumari.
One of the translations for the term
Sandhabhasha. Sandhabhasha is a
symbolic language used in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
in which the elements of tantric
worship are described in a coded
language often drawn from the private
parts and functions of the human
body. This is done to hide the tradition’s
particulars from the uninitiated.
See Sandhabhasha.
[[715]]
Tyag
Tyag
(“renunciation”) Practice of renuncia-
tion stressed most by ascetics, but even
among this group, some stress it more
than others. Some ascetics carry this to
extreme lengths. One famous ascetic,
Swami Karpatri, was famous for receiv-
ing the food he was given as alms into
his cupped hands, signifying the renun-
ciation of an eating-vessel. The most
extreme examples are ascetics who have
given up all clothing as a symbol of
renunciation of conventional standards,
including shame. The ultimate purpose
in such renunciation varies with the
individual, but one of the common
themes is to serve as a model of how lit-
tle one really needs to live a happy and
fulfilling life and thus to illustrate the
fundamental values that people often
forget in the bustle of everyday life.
Many ordinary people also share this
value in seeking to simplify their lives
through giving up attachments and
entanglements.
