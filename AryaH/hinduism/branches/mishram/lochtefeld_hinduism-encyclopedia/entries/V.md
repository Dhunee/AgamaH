Vachaspati Mishra
(ca. late 15th c.) Commentator and com-
piler of the dharma literature. He com-
posed dozens of texts in his working life,
including a number of digests (nibandha)
organized around various subjects,
including daily religious rites, purifica-
tion, pilgrimage, death rites (antyeshthi
samskara), political life, judicial proce-
dures, and funeral rites. In these digests
Mishra would draw material relating to
the theme from a number of different
religious texts, weigh them, and some-
times interpret their position on a reli-
gious issue. Mishra was much respected
for his learning and piety, and his texts
were an important resource to those
who followed him.
Vadagalai
One of the two main subsects in the
Shrivaishnava religious community, the
other being the Tengalai. The Shri-
vaishnavas are devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu, and the community’s roots
lie in the devotional hymns of the
Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between
the seventh and tenth centuries. Two
centuries later, the Alvars’ devotional
outpouring was organized and system-
atized by the philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.), who is considered the
Shrivaishnava founder. Ramanuja was
convinced that Brahman, or Supreme
Reality, was a personal deity rather than
an impersonal abstract principle, and he
was also convinced that devotion
(bhakti) was the most important form of
religious practice. Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions and
[[728]]

thus opposed the Advaita Vedanta
school, founded by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, which believed that
the Supreme Being was impersonal and
that realization (jnana) was the best
spiritual path.
The split between the Tengalais and
the Vadagalais came several centuries
later and stemmed from differing per-
spectives on what the individual must
do to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The Vadagalais not only
stress the saving power of God’s grace,
but also assert that the individual must
respond to that grace and take an active
role in his or her salvation. This belief is
in complete contrast to the Tengalais,
who emphasize the need for absolute
surrender (prapatti) to the grace of God,
through which devotees are saved with
no action of their own.
Vagish
(“Lord of Speech”) Epithet of the poet-
saint Appar, reflecting the power of his
devotional poetry. Appar was one of the
earliest of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three southern Indian poet-saints
of the seventh and eighth centuries who
were devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. See Appar.
Vaidyanath
Form of the god Shiva, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of Physicians” (vaidya).
A temple is named for him at Deoghar
in the state of Bihar. Shiva is present at
Vaidyanath in the form of a linga, the
pillar-shaped image that is his symbolic
form, and the Vaidyanath linga is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, a network of
sites deemed especially sacred to Shiva,
and at which Shiva is uniquely present.
Vaidyanath’s charter myth is associated
with the demon-king Ravana, who is
said to be a great devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva. Ravana travels to Shiva’s home on
Mount Kailas and practices harsh
asceticism for years, hoping to gain a
vision of Shiva. When his asceticism
proves unsuccessful, the ten-headedVaisheshika
Ravana proceeds to cut off his heads,
one by one, and to offer them to Shiva.
As he is about to cut off the last of his
heads, Shiva appears before him and
grants Ravana a boon. Ravana asks for
Shiva to come and live in his palace in
Lanka, a request that would have made
Ravana invincible. Shiva agrees to come
in the form of a linga, but warns Ravana
that wherever the linga touches the
earth, it will stay there forever. As
Ravana begins traveling back to Lanka,
he feels the urge to urinate (which in
some versions is described as being
caused by Shiva himself, because the
other gods have begged Shiva not to go
to Lanka). Given the condition of his
boon, he cannot put the linga down;
moreover, since urination renders one
ritually impure, the linga would be
defiled if he holds it while answering
nature’s call (or touches it before he has
taken a purifying bath). Ravana ends up
handing the linga to a cowherd, giving
him strict orders to keep it off the
ground. The linga is so heavy, however,
that the cowherd eventually has to let it
rest on the ground, where it sticks fast,
and remains there to this day.
unconquerable during the Mahabharata
war. The loss of this weapon leaves
Karna at a disadvantage against Arjuna,
and Karna is eventually killed.
Vaikasi
Second month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Vrshabha (the zodiacal sign of
Taurus), which usually falls within May
and June. This name is a modification of
Baisakh, the second month in the lunar
calendar. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the
continuing importance of regional cul-
tural patterns. One way that the Tamils
retain their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil language, Tamil
months, and Tamil Nadu.
Vaikuntha
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
heaven in which the god Vishnu lives.
Vaishali
Vaijayanti Shakti
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, this is the name of an
all-conquering weapon that the storm-
god Indra gives to the warrior Karna.
Karna has been born wearing earrings
and a suit of armor, and Karna’s father,
the sun-god Surya, has ordained that as
long as Karna wears these, he cannot be
harmed. Indra gains them from Karna
by taking the guise of a brahmin, and
begging for them as alms from Karna,
who is famous for his generosity.
Despite being warned in a dream,
Karna cannot bring himself to refuse
and gives them to Indra. When Indra
gives him a boon in return, Karna asks
for the Vaijayanti Shakti. Karna keeps
this weapon in reserve to kill his neme-
sis, Arjuna, but is forced to use it
against another mighty warrior,
Ghatotkacha, when the latter proves
City and region in northern Bihar; the
region’s western border is the Gandaki
River, and its southern border the
Ganges river. Although now the region
is extremely backward, at the time of
the Buddha, Vaishali was one of the
largest cities in India and a center of
intellectual culture of the time. Vaishali
is famous as the birthplace of Mahavira.
He was the last of the Jain tirthankars,
the founding figures in the Jain religious
tradition. Tradition also holds Vaishali
as the site of the second Buddhist
council, convened one hundred years
after the death of the Buddha (ca. 386
B.C.E.), at which the Buddhist community
split between the Sthaviravadins and
the Mahasanghikas.
Vaisheshika
(“noting characteristics”) One of the
six schools of traditional Hindu
[[729]]
Vaisheshika
One of the many forms of Vishnu. Vishnu’s followers are known as Vaishnavas.
philosophy, and a school whose special
concern was the elucidation of physics
and metaphysics. The Vaisheshika
analysis of the categories for the
universe was later combined with the
stress on reasoning in another of the six
schools, the Nyayas, to form the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school, sometimes called
the Naiyayikas. The Vaisheshika school
was atomistic—that is, it espoused the
belief that all things were made up of a
[[730]]

few basic constituent things—and this
atomism was the root of the school’s
metaphysics. Philosophically speaking,
the Vaisheshikas were realists—that is,
they thought that the world was made
up of many different things and that
these things actually existed as per-
ceived, except in cases of perceptual
error. They believed that all things were
composed of nine fundamental sub-
stances—the five elements, space, time,Vaishnava
mind, and Selves—and that whatever
exists was both knowable and name-
able. The Vaisheshikas subscribed to the
causal model known as asatkaryavada,
which posited that when a thing was
created, it was a whole new aggregate,
completely different from its con-
stituent parts. This causal model tends
to multiply the number of things in the
universe because each act of creation
brings a new thing into being. It also
admits that human efforts and actions
are one of the causes influencing these
effects, making it theoretically possible
to act in a way that brings final libera-
tion of the soul (moksha).
According to the Vaisheshika analy-
sis, the objects of experience can be
divided into six categories: substances,
qualities, activity, universals, particu-
lars, and inherence (samavaya); some
later Vaisheshikas add a seventh category,
absences. The first three categories
can be perceived, whereas the others
must be inferred, but the concept of
inherence is central to their system of
thought. Inherence is the subtle glue
connecting all the elements of the uni-
verse: wholes and their parts, sub-
stances and their qualities, motions and
the things that move, general properties
with their particular instances, and most
important, pleasure and pain to the Self.
The philosophical problems with inher-
ence—particularly the notion that it was
one single principle and not a collection
of things—caused them great difficulty
and were responsible for the rise
of Navyanyaya school, which attempted
to explain these relationships in a
more sophisticated way. For further
information see Karl H. Potter and
Sibajiban Bhattacharyya (ed.), Indian
Philosophical Analysis, 1992; and
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Vaishnava
Name denoting a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, in any of his myriad
forms. Vaishnava theology is most
prominently characterized by the doc-
trine of the ten avatars, or divine incar-
nations: Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man-Lion,
Vamana (dwarf), Parashuram, Rama,
Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki. It is gener-
ally accepted that the avatar doctrine
provided a way to assimilate smaller
regional deities into the larger pantheon
by designating them as forms of Vishnu,
and it is in the form of these avatars that
Vishnu is most commonly worshiped.
Of the ten avatars, the two most impor-
tant ones have been Rama and
Krishna, although in the early cen-
turies of the common era, the Boar
avatar and the Man-Lion avatar were
influential regional deities.
Early Vaishnava religion is cloudy
and mysterious. Although Vishnu
appears in several hymns in the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, he was
clearly a minor deity, and it is difficult to
get from there to being the supreme
power in the universe. Some scholars
have speculated that the cult of
Krishna—a deified local cowherd
hero—originally came from outside
the Vedic religious matrix, and that
Krishna was identified with Vishnu as a
way to assimilate Krishna’s cult into
respectable Vedic religion. Such ideas
are intriguing but have little hard evi-
dence to support them. Inscriptional
evidence clearly shows that the worship
of Krishna was well-established by the
first century B.C.E. These devotees are
generally described as Bhagavatas
(“devotees of the Blessed One”), a name
that for the next thousand years is used
to refer to Vaishnavas in general. One
particular subset of this early Bhagavata
community was known as the
Pancharatrikas (“followers of the
Pancharatra”), who later evolved dis-
tinctive cosmological doctrines. These
mainstream Bhagavatas expressed their
devotion to Krishna by composing texts,
including parts of the Bhagavad Gita,
the Harivamsha, and various puranas,
culminating with the Bhagavata
Purana in about the tenth century.
The tone of Vaishnava devotion took
a dramatic turn with the advent of the
[[731]]
Vaishnava
Alvars, a group of twelve devotional
(bhakti) poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. Singing their hymns in the
Tamil language, the vernacular tongue
of their times, the Alvars propounded a
bhakti that was marked by passionate
devotion to God and characterized by a
profound
emotional
attachment
between deity and devotee. Along with
their
Shaiva
counterparts,
the
Nayanars, the Alvars spearheaded the
revitalization of Hindu religion vis-à-vis
the Buddhists and the Jains, and in the
process, transformed the tradition as the
devotional wave they had begun moved
northward. The period between the
twelfth and sixteenth centuries saw the
development of various Vaishnava com-
munities, often stemming from a partic-
ular charismatic religious figure.
This process began in southern
India, where the philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.) founded the Shrivaishnava
community, while the philosopher
Madhva (1197–1276) founded the com-
munity that bears his name. The next
great center was in Maharashtra, par-
ticularly in the Varkari Panth, which
was centered on the temple of Vithoba
in Pandharpur; some of this commu-
nity’s greatest figures were Jnaneshvar
(1275–1296?), Namdev (1270–1350),
Chokamela (d. 1338), Eknath (1533–
[[1599]]
), and Tukaram (1598–1650). The
Maharashtra region also saw the rise of
the Mahanubhav sect, from the thir-
teenth century. At Puri on India’s east-
ern coast one finds the worship of
Jagannath, a tribal deity assimilated
into the pantheon as a form of
Krishna. This was well established by
the twelfth century, as the poet
Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda clearly shows.
Finally, in northern India one finds sev-
eral vibrant religious groups. A very early
figure is the twelfth-century philosopher
Nimbarka, whose Nimbarki community
bears his name; several centuries later
came Vishnuswami, about whom little
is known. The greatest explosion of
northern Indian devotionalism came
in the sixteenth century, with the
[[732]]

philosopher Vallabhacharya founding
the Pushti Marg, the Bengali saint
Chaitanya founding the Gaudiya
Vaishnava community, and the poet-
saint Harivamsh (d. 1552) founding the
Radhavallabh community. All these
were based in the Braj region that is
Krishna’s mythic home, and all of them
worshiped Krishna: The Pushti Marg
and the Gaudiya Vaishnavas considered
him to be the supreme divinity, whereas
the Nimbarkis and the Radhavallabh
community worshiped him in conjunc-
tion with his consort Radha, whom they
considered Krishna’s wife and equal. It is
also in northern India that the worship
of Rama has its deepest roots, as exem-
plified in the songs of the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?). Many of these
schools with long histories are still vital
in modern times.
The final Vaishnava community that
must be addressed is comprised of
ascetics. Vaishnava asceticism is a more
recent development than that of the
Shaivas (though dates are uncertain),
and it is largely located in the northern
part of India (the Shaivas are spread
throughout the country). Vaishnava
ascetics are known as Bairagis (“dispas-
sionate”) and are primarily organized
into four sampradays (religious sects
distinguished by unique bodies of
teachings), each connected with a major
Vaishnava figure. By far the most power-
ful is the Shri Sampraday of the
Ramanandi ascetics, which traces its
spiritual lineage through the poet-saint
Ramananda to the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, whom they
claim was Ramananda’s guru. The
Sanaka Sampraday of the Nimbarki
ascetics traces its spiritual lineage to the
philosopher Nimbarka. The Rudra
Sampraday of the Vishnuswami ascetics
traces its lineage through the philoso-
pher Vallabhacharya to an earlier figure,
Vishnuswami. Finally, the Brahma
Sampraday, an ascetic subset of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava ascetics, traces its
spiritual line through the Bengali saint
Chaitanya to the southern Indian
philosopher Madhva.Vaishya
Each of these sampradays is differen-
tiated not only by its founder, but also by
its tutelary deity or deities. The
Ramanandis worship the god Rama,
whereas the others worship the god
Krishna and his consort Radha, but dif-
fer in the position that they give to
Radha. Scholars have noted that these
historical claims are either highly sus-
pect or completely spurious and that the
distinctions among the sampradays are
largely academic. Given that the over-
whelming majority of these ascetics are
Ramanandis, the others seem important
only for symbolic reasons, to include a
representative from each of the great
Vaishnava religious figures.
Vaishno Devi
Presiding goddess of the Vaishno Devi
shrine, located in a cave on Trikut
mountain in the hills near Jammu, and
one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
Pilgrims to Vaishno Devi travel by road
via Jammu to the village of Katra,
whence they walk the ten miles to the
shrine itself. As with many of the images
of the Shiwalik goddesses, the images at
Vaishno Devi are “self-manifested”
(svayambhu), in the form of three stone
outcrops. These outcrops are consid-
ered to be Mahakali, Mahalakshmi,
and Mahasaraswati, the three forms
of the Goddess mentioned in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
authoritative source for the mythology
of the Goddess. The presence of all three
goddesses is believed to make this site
extremely powerful, and according to
popular belief, Vaishno Devi grants
whatever request her devotees (bhakta)
make. According to some accounts,
those whose wishes are granted are
highly advised to make a second trip,
both to thank the Goddess and to bear
witness to her grace. The number of vis-
itors to the site has increased dramati-
cally in the recent past, perhaps
reflecting anxieties about modern
Indian life.
There are several stories connected
with Vaishno Devi’s charter myth. The
name Vaishno is a derivation of Vishnu,
reflecting the claim that Vaishno Devi
was born as a partial avatar of Vishnu.
One sign of this connection is that
Vaishno Devi is a vegetarian goddess, for
whom no animal sacrifices can be per-
formed. According to another story,
Vaishno Devi was the spot at which the
arms of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth. Since this story is never fur-
ther connected to Vaishno Devi, this
seems a transparent attempt to tie into
the network of the Shakti Pithas, a
group of shrines sacred to the Goddess,
which stretch throughout the subconti-
nent. The longest version of the charter
myth reports that the cave is discovered
by a brahmin named Shridhara.
Shridhara, a great devotee of the
Goddess (who tested him in various
ways), is disturbed by the fact that he
has no children. The Goddess reveals
the location of the Vaishno Devi cave to
him in a dream. After an extensive
search he finally finds the cave and is
soon blessed with four sons, emphasiz-
ing the claim that Vaishno Devi will
grant the desires of her devotees, what-
ever they may be. For further informa-
tion see Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993. See also pitha.
Vaishya
In the traditional Hindu social theory of
the four major social groups (varnas),
the vaishyas were the third group—less
influential than the brahmins and
kshatriyas, but with greater status than
the shudras. In this model of society,
the vaishyas’ social function was eco-
nomic activity, to provide the material
basis for social life. This image is
reflected in the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta, in which the
vaishyas are described as being created
from the Primeval Man’s (purusha’s)
thighs—a standard euphemism for the
genitals, and thus the most direct con-
nection with fruition and procreation.
In fact, the jatis (endogamous social
subgroups, often determined by hered-
itary occupation) considered to be
[[733]]
Vaitarani
vaishyas did all sorts of economic activ-
ity, from farming to animal husbandry
to all sorts of trades and services.
Vaitarani
In Hindu mythology, a river flowing
through the underworld over which
souls must cross on the way to their
audience with the god Yama, the god of
the dead. For righteous people the
crossing is fairly easy, and they are widely
believed to get over by holding the tail
of a cow. For wicked people, on the
other hand, the Vaitarani is a river of
pus, blood, spit, and other polluting
substances, in which various ferocious
beasts lie in wait.
Vajapeya
Along with the Rajasuya, one of the
two most famous of the Vedic sacrifices.
The Vajapeya sacrifice was essentially
intended to provide an established
king with continuing strength and
vitality, magically rejuvenating him
after a long reign and in the face of
advancing age. In ancient times the
rite was elaborate and entailed the
sacrifice of animals; when it is
performed in modern times it is
performed in one day, and the animal
sacrifice is symbolic.
Vajra
Name for the thunderbolt, conceived
as one of the divine weapons. It has
two symmetrical sides, sometimes
pointed, with a handle in the middle.
The vajra is an enormously important
symbol in Buddhism, particularly the
tantric forms (i.e., secret, ritually based
religious practices) found in Tibet, but
it appears very seldom in Hindu
iconography. It is attested to be an
attribute of certain forms of the gods
Ganesh and Vishnu, but on the whole it
is not as important as some of the other
symbols. See also tantra.
[[734]]

Vajreshvari Devi
(“Goddess of the Thunderbolt”)
Presiding deity of the Vajreshvari temple
in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, and the
only one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses
whose temple is in an urban center.
Kangra has a long tradition as a center of
Goddess worship and may have been a
site for practitioners of tantra, a secret,
ritually based religious practice. The
charter myth identifies Vajreshvari Devi
as one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess, which
spreads throughout the subcontinent.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess; in the case of
Vajreshvari Devi the body part was Sati’s
breast—certainly a highly charged part
of the female body, thus making it a
more attractive place for tantric practi-
tioners. Another indication of her possi-
ble connection comes from her name, in
which the image of the thunderbolt car-
ries associations with Buddhist tantric
practice. For further information see
Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the Mother,
[[1993]]
. See also pitha.
Vajroli Mudra
Yogic practice attributed to Nathpanthi
ascetics, as part of their effort to attain
physical immortality through the prac-
tice of hatha yoga. The dominant
metaphor used in describing the
process of gaining immortality in this
manner is the union of sun and moon,
in which the sun stands for the
processes of change and destruction,
and the moon for stability and immor-
tality. In some cases this union was
described in very abstract terms, as a
process in the subtle body, at other
times in the most concrete possible
fashion, for which the best example is
vajroli mudra. This is urethral suction
or the “fountain-pen technique,” in
which a man, having ejaculated into
his female partner, draws his semen,
now refined through contact with the
woman’s uterine blood, back into hisValmiki
body, along with a certain amount of
his partner’s blood. Despite some com-
mentators’ discomfort and denials
(characteristic of most references to
sexual activity as part of Hindu spiritu-
al practice), vajroli mudra is consistent-
ly named as one of the Nathpanthi
practices. For further information see
George W. Briggs, Gorakhnath and the
Kanphata Yogis, 1982.
Vakataka Dynasty
(4th–6th c.) Central Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in the
center of modern India. The Vakataka
zenith came between the fourth and
sixth centuries, during which their sway
extended through most of the Deccan
plateau. At the turn of the fifth century,
the Vakataka king Rudrasena II married
Prabhavati Gupta, creating a marriage
alliance with the northern Indian Gupta
dynasty that gave the two dynasties
sway over much of India. Prabhavati
Gupta ruled as regent following
Rudrasena’s untimely death, during
which the Vakataka kingdom was a vir-
tual part of the Gupta empire, but in the
time after that the Vakatakas regained
greater autonomy.
Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531) Philosopher, teacher, and
founder of the religious community
known as the Pushti Marg. Vallabha-
charya propounded a philosophical
position called Shuddadvaita (“pure
non-dualism”), in which the Ultimate
Reality was conceived as personalized,
in the form of Krishna, rather than the
impersonal Brahman propounded by
the Advaita Vedanta school. Since
Vallabhacharya had personalized his
conception of the Supreme Reality, the
supreme religious goal was conceived in
terms of relationship with that divine
person. This stress on devotion was
soon articulated in elaborately arranged
forms of image worship in the Pushti
Marg’s temples. The devotees (bhakta)
would visualize themselves as Krishna’s
companions during his daily activi-
ties—waking, eating, taking the cows
to graze, coming home, etc.—and thus
gain the opportunity to take part in the
divine play (lila). This emphasis on
visualization and participation was
fostered through the development of
vast liturgical resources, which were
composed by eight poets (the ash-
tachap) who were associated with
Vallabhacharya and Vitthalnath, his
son and successor. For further informa-
tion see R.K. Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacarya, 1976.
Vallabhite
Popular name for the followers of
Vallabhacharya. As the suffix clearly
shows, this term is one term formed by
non-Hindus that was used to describe a
particular Hindu group. In earlier times
it was used by British government offi-
cials, but today it is used mainly by
scholars, usually foreigners. Vallabha’s
own followers would be far more likely
to describe themselves as belonging to
the Pushti Marg.
Valli
In the mythology of southern India, the
god Skanda (in his southern Indian
form as Murugan) becomes enamored
of and marries Valli, a young girl from a
group of tribal hunters. The marriage
takes place despite his earlier marriage
to the goddess Devasena, who has been
given to him by Indra and the estab-
lished Hindu gods. Murugan’s marriage
with Valli is a sign of his connection with
the land and probably reflects his earlier
past as a tribal deity. The marriage is
described as taking place at Tiruttani in
Tamil Nadu, but he is also described as
settling at Kataragama in Sri Lanka.
Valmiki
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is
regarded as the first poet, and who is tra-
ditionally cited as the author of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Sanskrit epics. According to legend,
[[735]]
Valmiki Jayanti
composed. After this first verse
composition, the god Brahma appears,
and at Brahma’s encouragement Valmiki
composes the Ramayana.
Valmiki Jayanti
Festival celebrated on the full moon
in the lunar month of Ashvin
(September–October). This day is con-
sidered to be the birthday of the poet
Valmiki, who according to tradition is
the author of the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two Sanskrit epics.
Vamachara
The god Vishnu’s Vamana avatar, a dwarf.
Vishnu takes this form to release the universe
from the control of the demon Bali.
Valmiki is a bandit in his early life. One
day, one of his victims asks him
whether his family will also share the
sins he is committing, and when
Valmiki finds out that they will not, he
has a change of heart. He sits down in a
secluded place and begins to do japa
(recitation), but his heart is so black-
ened by his sins that the only words he
can say are “mara mara” (“death,
death”). After a long time the syllables
become reversed, and by reciting
“Rama Rama” he expiates his former
sins. This recitation is so long that a
colony of white ants (in Sanskrit,
named “valmika”) builds a hill over
him, and when he emerges from this he
is given the name Valmiki.
After his emergence, Valmiki builds
an ashram on the banks of the Tamasa
River and lives a quiet life. He gives shel-
ter to Sita after she has been exiled from
Ayodhya by her husband, Rama, and
also cares for her sons, Lava and Kusha.
One day when Valmiki is walking by the
Tamasa River, he sees a hunter shoot a
pair of courting Krauncha birds, and in
his intense anger, his rebuke to the
hunter comes out in verse; according
to legend, this is the first poem ever
[[736]]

(“left-hand practice”) In the secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice known as
tantra, this term denotes a type of
tantric practice that makes ritual use of
forbidden substances, such as the Five
Forbidden Things (panchamakara), or
promotes behavior that the orthodox
would consider scandalous or objec-
tionable. When seen in a tantric context,
the use of such normally forbidden sub-
stances is not mere license, but a power-
ful ritual tool. One of the most pervasive
tantric assumptions is the ultimate
unity of everything that exists. From a
tantric perspective, to affirm that the
entire universe is one principle—often,
conceived as the activity of a particular
deity—means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic thinking.
The “Five Forbidden Things” provide a
ritual means for breaking down duality
because in this ritual the adept breaks
societal norms forbidding consumption
of intoxicants, nonvegetarian food, and
illicit sexuality, in a conscious effort to
sacralize what is normally forbidden.
Within the tantric tradition itself there is
a long-standing debate about the pro-
priety of such acts, and whereas the
vamachara practice uses these elements
in their actual forms, in the dakshi-
nachara (“right-hand”) practice, other
items are substituted for the forbidden
ones. This distinction between “right”
and “left” hand also reveals the perva-
sive polarity between right and left inVana Dashanami
Indian culture, with the former being
deemed better.
Vamakhepa
(1843–1911) Ascetic devotee (bhakta) of
the Goddess in her fierce and powerful
form as Tara; his presence and supposed
miraculous powers are largely responsi-
ble for the importance of Tarapith as an
important regional sacred site (tirtha) in
West Bengal. From his earliest child-
hood, Vamakhepa was occupied with
thoughts of the Goddess, and from an
early age he took up residence in the
cremation ground at Tarapith, where he
undertook the worship of Tara. Various
stories describe his power to heal people
of all sorts of ailments, as well as his
complete disregard for all accepted
standards—according to tradition, he
once urinated on the temple’s image of
Tara, to show his contempt for a deity
made of iron, and was struck in punish-
ment by the Goddess.
Vamana Avatar
Fifth avatar of Vishnu, this one in the
form of a dwarf (“vamana”). As with all
of Vishnu’s avatars, the Vamana avatar
comes into being in a time of crisis and
serves to restore the cosmic balance
that has been thrown out of equilibri-
um. In this case the source of trouble
stems from a demon (asura) named
Bali, who has grown so powerful that
he is able to rule the entire universe,
doing as he wishes. As in many other
cases, Vishnu is able to counter and
conquer this disruptive force through
cunning and trickery, rather than simple
overt power.
The mythic tale describes how Bali is
sponsoring a great sacrifice, to which all
the gods and sages have come. Vishnu
comes in the form of a dwarf, disguised
as a mendicant brahmin. Bali gives
many rich gifts to those attending, as
part of the gift-giving (dana) associated
with sacrifice, and he offers to give
Vamana anything that he asks for.
Vamana refuses the offer of riches, land,
and material wealth, and asks only for
three paces worth of land to set up his
own sacrificial altar. Bali is amused by
the request and grants it flippantly
despite the warnings of Shukra, his reli-
gious preceptor (guru), that he should
not do this.
As soon as Bali pours water on
Vamana’s hand, marking that the gift has
been given irrevocably, Vamana suddenly
begins to grow. He grows so large that he
takes up all the space in the cosmos and
then begins to take his three steps. With
his first step he traverses the earth,
with his second the heavens, and with
his third step there is nowhere else to
go. Bali realizes that he has been
defeated, and as a gesture of submis-
sion indicates that Vishnu’s third step
should fall on his head. Vishnu’s third
step pushes Bali down into the nether-
world, where he still remains as the
ruler. As for many of the other avatars,
Bali’s fate gives an important lesson:
Vishnu’s purpose is not to destroy him,
but to restore the cosmic balance that
has been lost through one being gaining
disproportionate or inappropriate power.
Through his submission to Vishnu, Bali
remains a powerful being, but on a
diminished scale.
The motif of measuring out the uni-
verse in three steps is part of the oldest
stratum of Vishnu’s mythology. In one of
the few hymns to Vishnu in the Rg Veda
(1.154), the oldest Hindu religious text,
he is described as a protective and
benevolent deity, who with three steps
defines the boundaries of the universe.
This manifestation of Vishnu is named
Trivikrama (“[taking] three steps”); it
seems likely that the motif from this
hymn was grafted onto the Vamana
story as part of the process of assimila-
tion into the pantheon.
Vana Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were suppos-
edly established by the ninth-century
[[737]]

philosopher, Shankaracharya, in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
different name—in this case, vana (“for-
est”). Upon initiation, new members
are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identities,
these ten “named” divisions are divid-
ed into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquar-
ters in one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other par-
ticular religious associations. The Vana
Dashanamis belong to the Bhogawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri, on
the bay of Bengal.

Vanamalin
(“wearing a garland of forest flowers”)
Epithet of the god Krishna. See Krishna.
Vanaprastha
(“forest-dweller”) According to the
dharma literature, the vanaprastha was
the third of the idealized stages of life
(ashrama) for a twice-born man, that is,
a man born into the brahmin, ksha-
triya, or vaishya communities, who had
undergone the adolescent religious ini-
tiation known as the “second birth.”
According to this idealized pattern, after
engaging in religious learning as a celi-
bate student (brahmacharin), the first
stage; marrying and raising a family as a
householder (grhastha), the second
stage; a man should, in the third, gradu-
ally disengage himself from the world by
giving up his attachments and with-
drawing to a more secluded place. The
renunciation in this third stage of life isVarkari
less severe than the last stage, the
Sanyasi—the texts are very clear that he
should remain with his wife and that he
should continue to perform the pre-
scribed daily domestic sacrifices.
Although in contemporary times it is
fairly common for older people to live a
more retired life, bequeathing the bulk
of the family affairs to their children, few
people live by the strict prescriptions for
the vanaprastha. The prescription for
this third stage of life is generally con-
sidered to be a reaction to the growth of
asceticism in the centuries before the
turn of the common era, particularly the
monastic asceticism of the Buddhists
and Jains, which they claimed was reli-
giously superior to the life of a house-
holder. The vanaprastha is a transitional
stage that paves the way for an ascetic
life, but it is set in one’s old age and thus
allows for the fulfilling of one’s duties to
family and society.
Varada Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the left hand is held with the fin-
gers pointing downward and the palm
exposed to the viewer, with the fingers
either fully extended or slightly curled.
The word varada means “boon-grant-
ing,” and the gesture is meant to indi-
cate beneficence and generosity.
Varaha Avatar
The third avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, in the form of a boar. See
Boar avatar.
Varanasi
Traditional name for the sacred city of
Benares. The name Varanasi may be
generally used to denote the whole city,
but in a more specific context this refers
to one of the concentric sacred zones
surrounding the Vishvanath temple, the
city’s ritual center. The smallest of these
zones is called Avimukta, the second is
Varanasi, and the largest is named
Kashi. The sacred zone of Varanasi is
conceived as the area between the
Varana and the Asi rivers—the traditional
boundaries of the city of Benares—but
Varanasi’s boundaries do not stretch
inland as far as those of Kashi.
Varkari
Religious community of devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, in his man-
ifestation as Vithoba. Varkari worship
has centered on Vithoba’s temple at
Pandharpur in the southern part of the
state of Maharashtra. The community’s
history begins with a series of extraordi-
nary devotional (bhakti) poet-saints,
dating from the twelfth to the seven-
teenth century: Jnaneshvar, Namdev,
Eknath, Tukaram, Chokamela, Gora,
Janabai, Bahina Bai, and many others.
One of the ways that these saints
expressed their devotion was in pilgrim-
age to Pandharpur, and this pilgrimage
is still the major ritual act in the Varkari
community. Twice a year Varkaris come
on pilgrimage to Pandharpur and time
their travel so that all the pilgrims arrive
on the same day—the eleventh day
(ekadashi) in the bright half of Ashadh
( June–July) in the summer, and the
eleventh day in the bright half of
Kartik (October–November) in the fall.
Individual pilgrims travel in small
groups called dindis, often made up of
people from the same neighborhood or
locality. The dindis are organized into
larger groups known as palkhis, each of
which is associated with one of the
Varkari poet-saints and is led by a
palanquin (palkhi, an enclosed single-
person litter borne on the shoulders of
bearers by means of poles) bearing the
sandals of that saint. Each palkhi
departs from a place associated with its
particular saint—for example, the
palkhi of Jnaneshvar leaves from the
town of Alandi in which he lived—and
thus he and all the other saints are still
symbolically journeying to Pandharpur
twice a year. During their journey pil-
grims sing the devotional songs com-
posed by these poet-saints. In this way,
the pilgrims are emulating the saints
[[739]]

before them, both by treading in their
physical footsteps and by singing their
songs of devotion. Although the pil-
grimage concludes with the entry to
Pandharpur and the worship of
Vithoba, the most important part is the
journey itself. For more information

Varna
(“color”) Theoretical system dividing
Indian society into four major groups,
each with a differing occupation and
status: brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya,
and shudra. The highest status was held
by the brahmins, who were priests and
scholars, next came the kshatriyas, who
were kings and soldiers, then the
vaishyas, whose purview was economic
life, and finally the shudras, who were
supposed to serve the others. This pic-
ture is articulated as early as the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, in par-
ticular by a hymn in the Rg Veda (10.90)
[[740]]

known the Purusha Sukta. The Purusha
Sukta describes the creation of the world
and of society as stemming from the
sacrifice of the Primeval Man
(purusha), with the brahmins coming
from his mouth, the kshatriyas from his
shoulders, the vaishyas from his thighs
(a common euphemism for the geni-
tals), and the shudras from his feet.
This four-fold scheme is conceptually
neat, but the real picture was far more
complex. For one thing, none of these
four varnas was as uniform as this
scheme might lead one to suppose:
Each of the varnas had multiple occupa-
tionally
defined
subcommunities
known as jatis, which often competed
for status with one another, even though
they may have been members of the
same varna. The other discrepancy was
that local circumstances had a great
effect on any particular community’s
social status. As one example, the
Vellala community in Tamil Nadu had a
great deal of status and power, even
though they were technically shudras,
because they were a landholding com-
munity. On the opposite end, it is not
uncommon for brahmins in northernVasant Panchami
India to earn their living by trading
or other businesses. This four-fold
varna plan does give the general status
picture, but the specifics are much
more detailed.
Varnashrama Dharma
In the dharma literature, varnashrama
dharma is the ordering of dharma or
religious duty based on the hierarchical
social ordering of the four major social
groups (varnas) and the four successive
stages of life (ashramas). According to
this theory, all people would be able to
discern their social status and appropri-
ate function based on their social class
and stage of life. The interrelationship
between these two sets of categories is
often used to denote traditional Hindu
society, in theory if not always in fact.
The term survives in modern times,
but because the doctrine of the
ashramas is now largely ignored, those
who uphold varnashrama dharma are
primarily defending the hierarchical
social divisions commonly known as the
caste system.
Varuna
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative religious texts, Varuna is
a deity associated with the sky, with
waters, with justice, and with truth.
Varuna belongs to the earliest layer of
the Indo-Aryan deities; this is clearly
shown by comparisons with the
Avesta, an ancient Iranian sacred text
that shows many parallels with the
Vedas, and with even older epigraphic
sources. As portrayed in the Vedas, how-
ever, Varuna’s influence has clearly
declined—there are far fewer hymns
addressed to him than to deities such as
Indra, Agni, and Soma, and he seems to
have played a far less important role
than these other deities in Vedic religion.
In the Vedas, Varuna is portrayed as
the guardian of rta, the cosmic order
through which the world proceeds. As
the deity associated with the high heaven,
he also watches over the deeds of
human beings and punishes them for
any transgressions. The best known
hymn to Varuna, Rg Veda 7.86, shows
Varuna’s connection with justice, moral
order, and the waters. The hymn is the
lament of a person who has committed
some offense against Varuna and whose
sin has become visible through being
afflicted with dropsy, in which the body
retains its fluids and swells. The speaker
begs Varuna to reveal the forbidden act,
“committed under the influence of
liquor, anger, or heedlessness,” so that
Varuna may be propitiated and the suf-
ferer healed.
Despite his virtual eclipse early in the
tradition, in the later tradition, Varuna
retains his association as the god presid-
ing over the waters. He is also consid-
ered to be one of the eight Guardians of
the Directions, each of which is associ-
ated with one of eight points on the
compass. Varuna presides over the west-
ern direction.
Vasant Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day
(panchami) of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Magh
(January–February), celebrated as the
first day of spring (vasant). This day is
considered sacred to the goddess
Saraswati, patron deity of the arts,
music, and learning. In her honor, cele-
brants sing songs in melodic modes
(ragas) associated with spring. Given
Saraswati’s connection with learning,
this is also traditionally reckoned as the
day on which young children should
begin their studies.
Vasant Panchami is also associated
with Kama, the god of love, since the
coming of spring brings the reappear-
ance of flowering plants, with their
scents and colors. This is supposedly
the day that Kama attempts to instill
erotic desire in the god Shiva’s heart,
first by bringing spring to Mount
Kailas, where Shiva is meditating, and
then shooting Shiva with one of his
flower arrows. Shiva awakens from his
meditation, becomes angry at Kama,
[[741]]
Vashitvam
and reduces him to ashes with a burst
of flame from his third eye. Despite
being destroyed, in the end Kama is
successful—after being awakened,
Shiva becomes aware of Parvati’s
ascetic practice and eventually becomes
her husband.
Vashitvam
(“control”) One of the eight superhuman
powers (siddhi) traditionally believed to
be conferred by high spiritual attain-
ment. This particular power gives one
the ability to control others, while
remaining free from outside control.
Vasishtha
In Hindu mythology, one of the Seven
Sages whose names mark exogamous
clan “lineages” (gotra; in exogamous
groups members must marry outside
the group); the others are Gautama,
Bharadvaja, Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Atri, and
Vishvamitra. All brahmins are believed
to be descended from these seven sages,
with each family taking the name of its
progenitor as its gotra name. In modern
times, these gotra divisions are still
important, since marriage within the
gotra is forbidden. After her marriage,
the new bride adopts her husband’s
gotra as part of her new identity.
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Vasishtha is a
very powerful sage who is the guru to
the kings of the Solar dynasty, including
King Dasharatha and his son, Rama.
Vasishtha is also famous for his long-
standing
feud
with
the
sage
Vishvamitra, which causes numerous
confrontations. The feud’s genesis is
ultimately rooted in the difference in
status between kshatriyas and brah-
mins. Vishvamitra is a king who stops
with a host of retainers at the forest
ashram of the brahmin Vasishtha. Upon
asking for food, Vishvamitra is amazed
at the ability of Vasishtha’s cow, the
Kamadhenu, to provide food for every-
one. Vishvamitra first tries to buy the
Kamadhenu, then tries to take it by
[[742]]

force, but his minions are defeated by
the magic powers generated by
Vasishtha’s tapas (ascetic practices).
Vishvamitra finally admits defeat and
begins to do ascetic practices to gen-
erate power of his own. Two of their
most celebrated clashes are over King
Trishanku and his son, Harishchandra;
in each case the real issue is the mutual
antipathy of these two sages. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Vastra
(“clothing”) The seventh of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the deity
is offered clothing, either through sym-
bolic presentation or through physically
dressing the image. The underlying
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is
to show one’s love for the deity and min-
ister to the deity’s needs.
Vastradhari
(“wearing the clothes”) Name for a
newly initiated Sanyasi ascetic, one who
has put on the ascetic robes, but still has
to undergo a period of training as a dis-
ciple to his guru.
Vasudeva
The god Krishna’s father. His most
important role in Krishna’s mythology
comes on the night of Krishna’s birth,
when Vasudeva is able to spirit
the infant Krishna out of prison, his
birthplace, to the home of his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. Vasudeva
returns that night, bearing Yashoda’s
newborn girl, who is really the
goddess Bhadrakali in disguise. The
next morning Kamsa kills the child
by dashing it against a stone, but
from the body arises the goddess, who
taunts Kamsa that the person who will
slay him has escaped.Vatsyayana
Vasudeva
(2)(“son of Vasudeva”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, a patronymic formed from the
name of his father, Vasudeva, by length-
ening the initial vowel. See Krishna.
Vasuki
In Hindu mythology, a famous Naga
(mythical serpent). Vasuki’s most famous
mythic role comes in the story in which
the gods and demons churn the Ocean
of Milk to obtain the nectar of immortal-
ity (amrta). In the form of his Tortoise
avatar, the god Vishnu serves as the
churning-base, Mount Mandara serves
as the churning-stick, and Vasuki, with
his enormous length, as the churning-
rope. With the gods on one side and the
demons on the other, they pull Vasuki
back and forth until the sea of milk gives
up its treasures.
Vata
(“air”) Along with pitta (“bile”) and
kapha (“phlegm”), one of the three
humors (tridosha) in ayurveda, the tra-
ditional system of Indian medicine.
Every person has all three of these
humors, but usually one is predomi-
nant, and this marks a person in certain
ways, particularly with regard to health,
digestion, and metabolism. Vata is asso-
ciated with the element of air, which is
quick, light, and dry. People whose pre-
dominant humor is vata are said to have
quick minds, light bodies, and tend to
always be doing something. At the same
time, they lack substantiality and can
run down easily if not careful.
Vatsalya (“calf-like”) Bhava
The fourth of the five modes of devotion
to God that were most prominently
articulated by Rupa Goswami, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a fol-
lower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used differing types of human
relationships as models for differing
conceptions of the link between deity
and devotee. These five models showed
growing emotional intensity, from the
peaceful (shanta) sense that comes
from realizing one’s complete identity
with Brahman or Supreme Reality, to
conceiving of God as one’s master,
friend, child, or lover. In the Vatsalya
mode of devotion, devotees consider
themselves as God’s parents, lavishing
love and care on the deity as a cow cares
for her calf. This is an emotionally
intense mode of relationship, but with-
out the erotic element present in the
fifth mode, madhurya bhava.
Vatsyayana
According to tradition, the author of the
Kama Sutra . This text is usually associ-
ated with an exhaustive catalog of sexu-
al positions and pleasures, which it
certainly contains, but in fact, the text
goes far beyond this. Vatsyayana was
interested in exploring desire in all its
manifestations, and the text begins with
a consideration of the four aims of life
(purushartha): worldly goods (artha),
desire (kama), religious duty (dharma),
and liberation of the soul (moksha).
Vatsyayana argued that because desire
was one of the established ends of
human life, its pursuit was thus a good
thing, as long as this pursuit did not
interfere with the other ends.
Having established the legitimacy of
desire, Vatsyayana then talks about how
to foster it. The Kama Sutra’s second
book contains the text’s best-known
material, the discussion and categoriza-
tion of various types of sexual union. It
begins by characterizing various types
of sexual endowment, both male and
female, then proceeds to describe differ-
ent sorts of embracing, kissing, scratch-
ing, and biting as symbols of passion,
sexual positions, and oral sex. This is
followed by chapters on gaining a wife,
attracting other men’s wives (which
the text discourages, except in cases
where one’s passion is “too strong”),
courtesans, and general remarks
on attraction. The text is thus a manual
for all phases of erotic life, in which
sex can be refined into a vehicle for
[[743]]
Vatsyayana
aesthetic experience, as well as pure
carnal pleasure.
Vatsyayana
(2) (4th c.) Writer and commentator in
the Nyaya school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy, which since early in the common
era has been combined with another of
the six schools, the Vaisheshikas.
Vatsyayana is best known for his
commentary on Gautama’s Nyaya
Sutras, themselves the foundational
text for the Nyaya school.
Vayu
In Hindu mythology, the deity who is
wind personified. Vayu is a minor deity
who is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions; his direction is the north-
west. Aside from being the external
winds, Vayu is also believed to be pre-
sent inside the body, in the five “vital
winds” (prana) through which all phys-
iological processes are believed to occur.
Although Vayu is a minor deity, two of
his sons are extremely significant. His
son, Bhima, is one of the five Pandava
brothers who are the protagonists in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Sanskrit epics. Bhima is famous for his
size and strength, and also for his earthy
appetites, both of which reflect the
wind’s raw, uncontrollable nature. Vayu’s
other famous son is the monkey-god,
Hanuman. Even though mythically
Hanuman is most famous for his devo-
tion and service to the god Rama, in
practical terms he is one of the most
popular and widely worshiped deities in
northern India. This popularity may
stem from his intermediate status;
because Hanuman is also a servant, he
is less remote and majestic than Rama
and, therefore, accessible to human
petitions. Another important factor is
that this accessibility is coupled with
power and the ability to protect those
who call on him.
[[744]]

Veda
(“knowledge”) The oldest and most
authoritative group of Hindu sacred
texts, also designated by the term shruti
(“heard”). According to tradition, these
texts were not composed by human
beings, but are based in the primordial
vibrations of the cosmos itself. The
ancient sages, whose faculties of per-
ception had been honed through ardu-
ous religious practice, were able to
“hear” and understand these vibrations,
and transmitted them to others in a lin-
eage of learning. On one level, the term
veda is part of the names of four individ-
ual texts—the Rg Veda, Sama Veda,
Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda, each of
which has a differing focus and content.
The term veda is also a collective term
for the material in these texts or their
associated appendices: the Vedic hymns
(samhitas), the Brahmanas, the
Aranyakas, and the Upanishads.
Although these four groups of texts are
all considered part of the Vedas, they
have very different forms and character-
istics. The samhitas are hymns of praise
addressed to particular deities, and are
found mainly in the Rg Veda and the
Sama Veda. In contrast, the Brahmanas
are detailed ritual manuals, giving the
instructions for performing complex
sacrificial rites; the Aranyakas and the
Upanishads are speculative ponderings
on the nature of the cosmos. The Vedas
were considered so sacred that for 3,000
years they were not written down, but
transmitted orally, a mode of transmis-
sion that still persists today. The Vedas’
power comes not from their literal
meaning, but from their very sound,
which is the identical sound heard by
the sages long ago. To safeguard this tra-
dition, Hindus developed an elaborate
system of mnemonics to ensure that the
texts would not be altered or corrupted,
thus preserving their efficacy.
Vedanga
(“[subsidiary] member of the Veda”)
General name for six classes of works
considered auxiliary to the VedasVedanta Society
because they were intended to facilitate
its use. These six were guides to proper
articulation and pronunciation (shik-
sha), metrical forms (chandas),
Sanskrit grammar (vyakarana), etymo-
logical explanations of archaic words
(nirukta), determining astrologically
appropriate
times
for
sacrifice
(jyotisha), and ritual and ceremonial
guides (kalpa).
Vedanta
The latest of the six schools in traditional
Hindu philosophy. The name Vedanta
literally means “the end of the Vedas,”
and reflects their contention that they
were revealing the ultimate meaning of
these sacred texts. Vedanta proponents
gave particular attention to the
Upanishads, which were also the latest
stratum of Vedic texts, and thus their
“end” in a different sense. These texts
have served as authoritative sources for
several major schools, with widely dif-
fering philosophical positions. The best
known and most important of these is
the Advaita Vedanta school, propounded
by the philosopher Shankaracharya
and his followers. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical position known
as monism, which is the belief in a single
impersonal Ultimate Reality that they
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,
reality is thus “nondual” (advaita)—that
is, all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and
diversity. For the Advaitins, this assump-
tion of diversity is a fundamental
misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things and a manifestation of
avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
which causes human beings to be
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarna-
tion (samsara), and suffering.
Whereas the Advaita school conceives
of this Ultimate Reality in abstract imper-
sonal terms, the other Vedanta schools
are theistic—that is, they conceive the
Ultimate Reality as a personal God,
namely the god Vishnu. The two other
major schools are the Vishishthadvaita
vedanta (“qualified nondualism”) pro-
pounded by Ramanuja and the Dvaita
Vedanta (“dualist”) propounded by
Madhva. The major differences between
these two schools stem from assump-
tions about connections between God,
human souls, and the world. Ramanuja
tends to see these in a continuum, with
the world and human souls sharing in
the divine nature, whereas Madhva
stresses the great gulf between God and
all other things. Another minor school is
the dvaitadvaita vedanta (“dualism and
nondualism”) of Nimbarka, which
strives to find some middle ground
between Advaita Vedanta’s monism, and
Dvaita Vedanta’s dualism. Nimbarka
stressed that the world and souls were
dependent on God, in whom they exist,
and with whom they had a subtle con-
nection. Even from their names, it is
obvious that there are significant differ-
ences between these positions.
Vedanta Deshika
(13th c.) Writer and commentator in the
Vishishthadvaita Vedanta philosophi-
cal school. Vedanta Deshika was a fol-
lower of Ramanuja and interpreted
Ramanuja as teaching that there were
two sorts of liberation: a lower one in
which one was subject to no outside
forces, and a higher one in which one’s
entire being was focused on the Lord,
whom Ramanuja identified as the god
Vishnu. The human being is considered
both identical to and different from the
Lord, which means the perfect identity
is never possible; God’s transcendence
leads to the exaltation of devotion
(bhakti) and the stress on submission to
God’s grace.
Vedanta Society
The oldest Hindu missionary organiza-
tion in America, established in 1897 by
Swami Vivekananda. The society stresses
the philosophical teachings of Vedanta,
which it understands as referring solely
[[745]]
Vedanta Sutras
to the Advaita Vedanta school,
Vivekananda’s major emphasis. The
society’s tone has been nontheistic,
nonritual, and rationalist; its con-
stituency has been drawn from liberals
and intellectuals, such as the writer
Aldous Huxley.
Vedanta Sutras
Text ascribed to the sage Badarayana in
the third to fifth century B.C.E. Along
with the Upanishads and the Bhagavad
Gita, the Vedanta Sutras is one of the
three traditional sources for the Vedanta
school, one of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy. The text
itself is a collection of 555 brief apho-
risms (sutras), which are so terse that
they presuppose a commentary. The
sutras focus particularly on the ideas
about Brahman, hence their other
common name, the Brahma Sutra. In
content, the first section describes the
nature of Absolute Reality, the second
responds to objections and criticizes
other positions, the third details
the means to acquire knowledge, and
the fourth describes the benefits of
such knowledge.
Vedarambha (“beginning of Veda
[study]”) Samskara
Traditionally, the twelfth of the life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras). In this
ceremony, a newly initiated brah-
macharin—a young man who had
entered the celibate student phase of
life—would commence to study the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
This rite is not mentioned in the earliest
texts in the dharma literature, perhaps
under the assumption that Veda study
would commence at an appropriate
time, after learning had commenced
with the earlier vidyarambha samskara.
Vegetarianism
A dietary practice that carries extremely
high status among Hindu people, prob-
ably because of its associations with
[[746]]

strict brahmin practice; even people
who are nonvegetarian themselves will
commonly think of a vegetarian diet as
“purer.” Strict vegetarians eat no flesh or
eggs, but milk and milk products are
always eaten and are considered pure
and health-giving, probably because
they come from the cow. Those people
who keep the strictest diets will also
often refrain from onions and garlic,
which are considered to excite the pas-
sions. This religious commitment to
vegetarianism by a certain part of the
population, and the general status given
to “pure” vegetarian food, are both
responsible for the great variety of vege-
tarian cooking found in Indian culture.
Despite the higher status given to a veg-
etarian diet, most modern Hindus are
not vegetarian—a recent poll of urban
Hindus found that only about 25 per-
cent were pure vegetarian, although the
number may be higher in villages, which
tend to be more traditional.
Vellala
The landlord community throughout
much of traditional Tamil Nadu.
Although technically the Vellalas were of
shudra status, their control over the
land gave them considerable influence
and prestige in the region. The Vellala
community was the source for many of
the Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
whose stress on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to the god Vishnu transformed
and revitalized Hindu religious life. Most
of the Alvars’ influence undoubtedly
stemmed from the strength of their reli-
gious devotion, but this was undoubtedly
reinforced by Vellala status as a land-
holding community.
Velur
Village in the Aurangabad district of the
state of Maharashtra, a few miles from
the cave temples at Ellora. Velur is
famous as the site for the temple to the
god Shiva in his form as Ghrneshvar,
the “Lord of Compassion.” Shiva is pre-
sent at this temple in the form of a linga,Veshara
the pillar-shaped image that is his
symbolic form, and the Ghrneshvar
linga is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a
network of sites deemed especially
sacred to Shiva, and at which Shiva is
uniquely present.
Vena
In Hindu mythology, a wicked king
who prohibits all religious rites and gift-
giving except those dedicated to him. He
is finally killed by a group of outraged
sages, who through their magic powers
transform blades of sacred kusha grass
into spears. After Vena has been killed,
the problem of the royal succession arises.
The sages first churn from his thigh a
small, malformed, dark-skinned man
named Nishada, who is believed to be
the ancestor of the tribal people known
as the Nishadas. Nishada takes upon
himself all Vena’s manifold sins, thus
purging them from Vena. After Vena has
been cleansed, the sages churn his right
hand, from which emerges a radiant and
shining boy, who is King Prthu.
India. People come to Tirupati from all
over the country, largely because of the
popular belief that any wish made in the
deity’s presence will invariably be granted.
Aside from significant monetary
offerings, it is also very common for pil-
grims to have their heads shaved, as a
sign of their visit and to make an offer-
ing of the hair, as well. In the time since
independence the temple’s wealth has
been administered by a trust, which has
been particularly attentive in fostering
publishing, educational institutions,
and in helping to build Hindu temples
outside India.
Venu
(“bamboo”) A bamboo flute, which is
an important instrument in Indian
classical music. In Hindu iconography,
it is the characteristic instrument of
the god Krishna, who used its sweet
sounds to summon his devotees
(bhakta) to him, to spend their
nights dancing on the shores of the
Yamuna River.
VenkateshvaraVenus
(“the Lord of Venkata [Hill]”) Presiding
deity of the Venkateshvara temple near
the town of Tirupati in the state of
Andhra Pradesh; the temple is north
and east of Madras. Venkateshvara is a
local deity who has been assimilated
into the larger pantheon as a form of the
god Vishnu. The temple is in the
Tirumalai hills, a cluster of seven hills
believed to represent the seven cobra
hoods of Shesha, the mythic serpent
who serves as Vishnu’s couch.
Venkateshvara’s image is unusual, in
that his forehead is covered with a plate.
The two branches of the Shrivaishnava
community, the Tengalais and the
Vadagalais, each wear distinctive sec-
tarian markings, and this plate conceals
these markings on the image and thus
allows both communities to claim him
as their own.
Venkateshvara is also famous for
having the single richest temple inIn Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with love and pleasure. It is
considered a strong planet, with pro-
nounced benevolent qualities, although
like all the other planets, its powers will
vary according to context. Venus pre-
sides over Friday, and its positive quali-
ties make this an auspicious day.
Veshara
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture,
the others being the Nagara and the
Dravida. The Veshara style is primarily
found in western India and the Deccan
and was the least significant and wide-
spread of the three styles. Whereas the
Nagara style was characterized by verti-
cal uplift achieved by a temple’s towers
(shikharas), and the Dravida style by
lower temples covering enormous tracts
of ground, the Veshara style’s most iden-
tifiable feature is a barrel roof above the
[[747]]
Vetala
A pilgrim in Benares wears vibhuti markings,
which consist of three horizontal lines and
identify him as a devotee of the god Shiva.
sanctuary, which has its roots in the
rock-cut caves (chaityas) first sculpted
by the Buddhists. This sort of roof is
midway between the Nagara towers and
the Dravida horizontal tiers, just as the
Deccan was the intermediate region
between the two.
Vetala
In Hindu mythology, one of the classes
of malevolent spirits that can be sub-
sumed under the general rubric of
demons. Vetalas are usually described as
eating human flesh and are sometimes
said to haunt battlefields to get their fill.
Vibhishana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Vibhishana is
the youngest brother of Ravana, the
demon king of Lanka. In their youth
Vibhishana, Ravana, and their third
brother, Kumbhakarna, have per-
formed harsh physical asceticism
(tapas) to gain boons from the gods.
Whereas his brothers have chosen
boons designed to advance their mili-
tary ability and glory, Vibhishana asks
[[748]]

that he remain righteous in times of
danger, and this quality marks his life.
When Ravana holds a council of war
preceding the battle with Rama’s
army, Vibhishana is the only one to
vote against battle and instead advises
Ravana to return Rama’s kidnapped
wife, Sita, and to beg Rama’s pardon.
For these words, Ravana expells his
brother from the city, and Vibhishana
goes over to Rama’s army, where he
fights valiantly throughout the war.
After the death of Ravana, Rama
crowns Vibhishana the king of Lanka,
as a reward for his fidelity and his
virtue. Vibhishana is a perfect example
of the fact that demons (in this case
the type of demons known as rak-
shasas) are not inherently evil in
Indian mythology. They are powerful
beings who may clash with gods and
men, but they have many virtues as
well. In the Ramcharitmanas, the ver-
nacular retelling of the Ramayana
written by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?), Vibhishana is portrayed
as a great devotee (bhakta) of Rama, in
keeping with the emphasis of Tulsidas
on the primacy of devotion over all
other forms of religious life.
Vibhuti
(“power”) Name for the sacred ash with
which devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva mark their bodies, usually with
three horizontal lines (tripundra).
According to one interpretation, the
three lines represent the three prongs of
Shiva’s trident, according to another,
they symbolize Shiva’s third eye. Ash is
associated with Shiva in several different
contexts. On one hand, he is said to
smear his body with ashes from the cre-
mation ground, which indicates his lack
of concern for all conventional distinc-
tions between purity and impurity
(ashaucha); the ash could also symbol-
ize Shiva’s destruction of Kama, the god
of love, who is burned to ash by Shiva’s
third eye. In earlier times vibhuti was
made from wood ash that had been sifted
through cloth until it was as fine asVidyadhara
talcum powder. This is still done today,
particularly by ascetics who usually use
the ash from a dhuni or smoldering
ascetic fire, which is believed to give the
ash a sacred quality; in modern times
vibhuti has become available in stores
that sell religious supplies.
Vichitravirya
In Hindu mythology, the son of
Satyavati and king Shantanu. Vichi-
travirya dies after his marriage to
Ambika and Ambalika, but before he
has fathered any children. In her desper-
ation to perpetuate King Shantanu’s lin-
eage, Satyavati calls on her eldest son,
Vyasa, to sleep with the two wives. From
this union Vyasa sires Pandu and
Dhrtarashtra, whose descendants form
the major warring factions in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Sanskrit epics.
Vicious Circle
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to be
avoided in constructing an argument. A
vicious circle occurs when a series of
things stand in a cause-and-effect rela-
tionship to one another, with any one of
them standing as both cause and effect.
For example, when “a” causes “b,” and
“b” causes “c,” (somewhere down the
line) “x” causes “a.” This is seen as an
extended case of self-residence—saying
that “a” is both cause and effect—and is
equally objectionable.
Vidhi
Philosophical concept that is found in
the Mahabharata and Ramayana, the
two great Sanskrit epics. As portrayed
there, vidhi is an impersonal force con-
trolling and constraining both the gods
and human beings; this notion corre-
sponds best to the idea of fate.
Vidura
In Hindu mythology, the son of the sage
Vyasa and the serving maid of Queen
Ambika. Ambika and her sister
Ambalika are the wives of King
Vichitravirya, who has died without
heirs. In a desperate attempt to save
the lineage, Vichitravirya’s mother,
Satyavati, summons her son, Vyasa, to
sleep with his brother’s two wives.
Ambika and Ambalika both sponta-
neously recoil from Vyasa, and each of
their sons is born with a defect:
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion; Ambika covers her
eyes,causing her son Dhrtarashtra to be
born blind. Ambika is so repulsed by
Vyasa’s appearance that when she is told
to sleep with him again, she sends her
serving maid instead. In contrast to the
two sisters, Ambika’s maid gives herself
willingly to Vyasa, and as a reward deliv-
ers a handsome son named Vidura.
According to one legend, Vidura is a
partial avatar of Dharma, the god who
is righteousness personified. Vidura
always shows his righteousness in his
dealings with the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the epic’s two warring fac-
tions. As the Kauravas become more and
more wicked, this inclines him more
toward the Pandavas, for whom he
serves as a trusted and faithful adviser. It
is Vidura who realizes the danger in the
House of Lac—a house built entirely of
highly flammable materials—and
makes arrangements for the Pandavas
to escape from it. During the Maha-
bharata war, he remains neutral, but
after the war is over he again serves as
an adviser to King Yudhishthira, the
eldest of the Pandavas, and to
Yudhishthira’s brothers.
Vidyadhara
(“wisdom-bearer”) Class of semidivine
beings. The Vidyadharas are generally
believed to live in the Himalayas
and are thus often associated with
the god Shiva, whose home is also said
to be there. Vidyadharas are generally
benevolent toward human beings and
are often (as their name suggests)
associated with bringing wisdom to
those they favor.
[[749]]
Vidyapati
Ruins of Vijayanagar, capital of the Vijayanagar dynasty.
Vidyapati
(ca. 1400) Brahmin court poet in the
Hindu kingdom of Mithila in northern
Bihar. Although Vidyapati wrote works
in Sanskrit, he is best known for his love
poetry, which was written in the vernac-
ular Maithali language. In this poetry he
drew on the literary traditions of
Sanskrit love poetry, but his favorite
subjects for this poetry were the divine
lovers Radha and Krishna. Although
later Vaishnavas considered Vidyapati’s
love poetry as devotional works,
Vidyapati’s own religious writings defin-
itively describe Shiva as the Supreme
Being, clearly showing that he was a
Shaiva. For further information see
Edward C. Dimock Jr. and Denise
Levertov (trans.), In Praise of Krishna,
[[1981]]
; and R. S. McGregor, The Love
Songs of Vidyapati, 1987.
Vidyarambha (“beginning of
study”) Samskara
Traditionally, the tenth of the life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), in which the
[[750]]

child begins formal education, usually
by starting to learn the alphabet.
Although people in modern India may
not perform this rite according to its
prescribed form (which includes mak-
ing offerings to a sacrificial fire and giv-
ing gifts to brahmins), families in which
education is taken seriously usually
have a ritualized commencement of
study, often when the child is as young
as three.
Vighneshvar
(“Lord of Obstacles”) Epithet of the god
Ganesh, reflecting the belief that he
wields control over all obstacles, and
thus can make things easy or hard on a
person. See Ganesh.
Vihara
An early architectural form, in which a
central courtyard was surrounded by a
series of small rooms. This was originally
a Buddhist architectural form, intended
to create a living space for the monks—
individual cells in the small rooms and aVijnaneshvara
common area in the large center space.
The design was adapted into the earliest
forms of the Hindu temples, such as
those at Aihole.of grain should be given to a brahmin.
As for results, faithfully observing this
festival is said to bring victory (vijaya)
over poverty and unhappiness.
VijayaVijayanagar Dynasty
In Hindu mythology, one of the gate-
keepers of Vaikuntha, who with his
brother Jaya, is cursed by the sage
Sanaka to be born three times as an
asura (demon), and to be killed each
time by Vishnu. In their first birth
Jaya and Vijaya incarnate as Hiran-
yaksha and Hiranyakashipu, who are
killed by the Boar avatar and the
Man-Lion avatar, respectively. In
their second they are born as Ravana
and Kumbhakarna, who are killed by
Rama. In their final birth they take
form as Shishupala and Dantavaktra,
who are killed by Krishna. After this
they return to their duties as Vishnu’s
gatekeepers.(“City of Victory”) The last of the great
southern Indian Hindu kingdoms,
which took its name from its capital city,
near modern Hampi in Karnataka. The
kingdom was founded in 1336 by
Harihara, a regional governor in the
Tughluq dynasty who broke away to
carve out a kingdom in the central
Deccan plateau. The kingdom went
through several periods of expansion
and decay. In the early fifteenth century
it controlled most of southern India, but
then passed through a period of decline
and loss of territory; this was followed by
renewal in the early sixteenth century,
during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya,
and finally ended after the battle of
Talikota in 1565, in which the ruling
prince Rama Raja was decisively defeated
by a coalition of the sultans from the
northern part of the Deccan. The city of
Vijayanagar was abandoned almost
immediately, and although it has suf-
fered the ravages of time, it still contains
stunning examples of late medieval
Hindu art and architecture.
Vijaya Dashami
(“victory tenth”) Another name for the
festival of Dussehra, which falls on the
tenth day of the lunar month. The festi-
val has two mythic charters, one with
the god Rama and one with the
Goddess, and both these myths point to
this as the day on which the deity wins a
definitive victory. See Dussehra.
Vijaya Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Phalgun (February–March). As for all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, which usually involve fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those performing this
vow should fill an earthen pot with the
seven kinds of grain, set an image of
Vishnu on the pot, and for twenty-four
hours, remain engaged in chanting the
names of Vishnu. On the twelfth the pot
Vijnaneshvara
(12th c.) Author of the Mitakshara , a
voluminous commentary on the Yaj-
navalkya Smrti, itself an example of the
dharma literature, or texts on religious
duty. This particular commentary
played a pivotal role in the British
administration of India. The British were
largely content to have their Indian sub-
jects governed by traditional religious
laws, but to do so, they needed an
accepted standard. For large sections of
British India, the Mitakshara was given
the status of traditional law and was
used as a legal code. The only major part
of India in which Hindus were not sub-
ject to this was in Bengal, where the legal
authority was the Dayabhaga. One of
[[751]]
Vikramaditya
the major differences between the two
was in matters of inheritance. The
Mitakshara stresses inheritance by
survivorship, in which only living males
can inherit property, whereas the
Dayabhaga stresses inheritance by suc-
cession, in which a dead man’s heirs can
inherit in his name.
Vikramaditya
(“Sun of Prowess”) Title taken by King
Chandra Gupta II (r. 376–415) as a symbol
of his royal mastery. This monarch is tradi-
tionally identified as the Vikramaditya
who established the Vikram era, but
because the Vikram era was established a
little less than sixty years before the com-
mon era, this claim is clearly untenable.
Vikram Era
One of the most common dating systems,
particularly in northern India. It is general-
ly believed that the Vikram era takes its
name from King Vikramaditya of Ujjain,
who is supposed to have ruled over much
of India. The Vikram era date is fifty-six or
fifty-seven years later than that of the com-
mon era; the discrepancy stems from the
differing first days of the year in the two
systems. In the common era the year
begins on January 1, but in the Vikram era
the year begins with the sun’s transition
into Aries, considered in India as occurring
on April 14. Hence, to convert a Vikram era
date to a common era date, one subtracts
fifty-six years for dates between January 1
and April 14, and fifty-seven years for dates
between April 15 and December 31.
Vikramorvashiya
(“Urvashi won by valor”) Drama written
by the poet Kalidasa, generally consid-
ered the greatest classical Sanskrit poet.
The Vikramorvashiya is a musical play in
five acts, whose mythic theme is the liai-
son of King Pururavas and the celestial
nymph Urvashi, a story mentioned both
in Rg Veda 1.95 and in the Shatapatha
Brahmana. In both these earlier sources
the story ends unhappily, with the separa-
tion of Urvashi and Pururavas, but in
[[752]]

Kalidasa’s version the estranged lovers are
finally happily reunited. This change may
have been prompted solely from the
desire for a happy ending, which is one of
the most characteristic features of
Sanskrit drama.
Village Deities
According to popular Hindu tradition,
the universe has 330 million gods. The
richness of this mythic imagination can
be seen in the composition of the Hindu
pantheon, in which hundreds of major
and minor deities have been given form,
identity, and mythic history. Yet aside
from these deities, who have been given
an identifiable form, there are also a
host of village deities found throughout
India. In most cases, the village deity is
exactly that—the deity who protects,
watches over, and acts as a divine over-
seer for a particular village or locale.
One of their most common functions is
to protect the village from disease, either
of people or livestock, and to provide
remedies when disease strikes. They are
also the guardians of the village, defend-
ing it from ghosts and unseen powers,
as well as protecting the villagers from
danger and misfortune.
The authority of these deities is gener-
ally quite limited—in most cases, it does
not extend beyond the village itself. In
most cases, village deities have no well-
defined mythic history, form, or person-
ality. At times they will have a temple
dedicated to them, but in other cases the
village deity is believed to be associated
with a particular tree or is represented by
a post in the village square. Village deities
are usually nonvegetarian, demanding
animal sacrifices and offerings of
blood in exchange for their services.
Relationships with these deities are highly
pragmatic—the villagers make offerings,
and the deities protect, but beyond
these offerings there is usually little
organized worship. If these deities have
any organized priesthood, it is almost
always non-brahmin because the impu-
rity (ashaucha) generated by animal sac-
rifices would be unacceptable toVina
brahmins. These priesthoods are inter-
mediaries between the deity and the vil-
lagers, usually communicating with the
deities through dreams or possession. In
this way the deities’ wishes become
known, and problems or concerns can
find their solution.
In some cases, local deities have gained
greater stature and have been assimilated
into the pantheon. For female deities, this
process is fairly simple, since they can be
brought into the pantheon by claiming
that their temples are one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess that spreads throughout the sub-
continent. Each Shakti Pitha marks the site
where a body part of the dismembered
goddess Sati fell to earth, taking form there
as a different goddess; all these individual
goddesses are thus seen as manifestations
of a single great Goddess. Male deities are
more commonly assimilated into the pan-
theon as manifestations of the god Vishnu,
and three prominent examples of the for-
mer are Jagannath, Vithoba, and
Venkateshvara. Village deities are less
commonly said to be forms of the god
Shiva, but this has happened with
Khandoba, an important regional deity in
the state of Maharashtra. See also pitha.
Vimana
(“vehicle”) A word with different specific
meanings in different contexts, a com-
mon feature in the Sanskrit language. It
can refer to the vehicles used by a
deity—either in a mythic sense, because
each of the deities has an animal con-
sidered to be his or her vehicle, or in a lit-
eral sense as the cart used to carry them
in procession, or to the human being
who “carries” them through becoming
possessed. In the context of architec-
ture, the word vimana is used to refer to
that part of the temple that “carries” the
deity, that is, the sanctuary as a whole.
Vimarsha
(“reflection”) In Hindu tantra, a secret,
ritually based religious practice, vimar-
sha is one of the bipolar opposites that
are used to characterize the nature of all
The vina is a classical Indian musical instrument.
reality, with its counterpart being illumi-
nation (prakasha). These two terms are
particularly important for the creation
of the world, which is said to happen
when the pure and radiant conscious-
ness (prakasha) of the ultimate
Brahman becomes self-conscious
through the reflection (vimarsha) of this
original consciousness. From one single
consciousness, the absolute then
evolves into a binary divinity—the god
Shiva and his consort Shakti—whose
continued interaction combines to
create the world. This dyad of prakasha-
vimarsha is particularly important in the
Trika school of Kashmiri Shaivism. For
further information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Vina
Multistringed musical instrument
with a long hollow body and a sound-
ing box at the bottom; the top has a
[[753]]
Vinata
large hollow gourd projecting from
the back, which further amplifies the
sound. The vina is one of the classical
musical instruments, particularly in
southern India, where its mastery is
still held in high regard. In Indian
iconography, the vina is most strongly
associated with the goddess Sara-
swati, in keeping with her identity as
the patron deity of the arts, culture,
and learning.
Vinata
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of
the divine sage Daksha, and the sister
of Kadru. Vinata gives birth to a line of
eagles—of whom the most famous is
Garuda—whereas Kadru gives birth to
a line of serpents. The proverbial
antipathy between these two kinds of
animals is described as stemming
from conflict between these two sis-
ters. One day the sisters get into an
argument about the tail color of a cer-
tain celestial horse, with Vinata argu-
ing that it is white, and Kadru
asserting that it is black. The disagree-
ment becomes more intense, until
they finally agree that the person who
is wrong will become a slave to the
other. To ensure her victory, Kadru
persuades a number of her children to
hang from the back of the horse, which
from a distance makes the tail appear
to be black. When Vinata sees the
black snakes, she accepts her defeat,
and for many years has to serve Kadru
under extremely harsh conditions. She
is finally rescued by her son, Garuda,
who when he discovers what has hap-
pened, embarks on a program of
killing snakes that has never abated.
Vinaya Patrika
(“letter of petition”) One of the later
poetic works by the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?), in the form of a
series of 280 short poems written in
the Braj Bhasha dialect. The entire
work is presented as a letter of petition
to Tulsidas’s chosen deity, Rama,
[[754]]

using as his intermediary the monkey-
god Hanuman. The letter’s general
theme is a plea for deliverance from
the evils of the current degenerate age
(kali yuga). The first sixty-odd verses
are a series of invocations paying
homage to various deities, showing
the ecumenical quality that more gen-
erally marks Tulsidas’s devotion. The
remainder of the poem is directed to
Rama and stresses other themes that
run throughout Tulsidas’s poetry. One
theme is the corrupted nature of the
present cosmic age, the kali yuga,
which makes devotion the only effec-
tive means to salvation. Another per-
vasive theme is the power of God’s
name and its incomparable ability to
rescue the devotee (bhakta). Finally,
there are warnings to the hearers not
to waste the opportunity of a human
birth. Much of the poetry has an inti-
mate personal quality, and it seems to
reflect both the poet’s despair at his
own frailty and his eventual hope for
salvation. From this general tone, the
Vinaya Patrika is generally assumed
to have been written in the later part
of the poet’s life, although it cannot be
precisely dated.
Vindhya Mountains
Mountain range running from east to
west in central India. Despite their
modest height, they have traditionally
served as the cultural dividing line
between northern and southern India.
The Vindhyas themselves were seen as
an uncivilized and potentially danger-
ous place, inhabited by ghosts,
demons, and tribal peoples; these
dangers were exemplified by the
untamed nature of its presiding god-
dess, Vindhyavasini.
Vindhyavasini
(“dweller in the Vindhyas”) Powerful
form of the great Goddess. The
Vindhyas are a mountain range in
central India that are difficult to
reach, inhabited by tribal peoples,Viparitakhyati
and seen as a place at the margins of
civilized society. As the goddess who
dwells in that place, Vindhyavasini is
equally marginal, often seen as a
fierce and dangerous deity who
demands blood sacrifices from her
devotees (bhakta). The mythology of
Vindhyavasini is associated with vari-
ous places in the Vindhyas, but for
centuries, her primary temple has
been in the village of Vindhyachal
near the city of Mirzapur in the state
of Uttar Pradesh, although she is
worshiped in other places in northern
India. One of her charter myths iden-
tifies her as the goddess (in infant
form) exchanged for the infant god
Krishna and killed by Krishna’s
wicked uncle, Kamsa. After taunting
Kamsa that the child he seeks has
already escaped, she flies off and
takes up residence in the Vindhyas.
Since other accounts identify this
goddess as Bhadrakali, this points to
the fluidity of the Hindu pantheon, in
which the renditions differ in the var-
ious accounts, according to the pur-
pose of the writers. For further
information see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986; and Cynthia
Humes, “The Goddess of the
Vindhyas in Banaras,” in Cynthia
Humes and Bradley R. Hertel, Living
Banaras, 1993.
Vipaksha
In Indian philosophy, one of the parts
in the accepted form of an inference
(anumana). The accepted form of an
inference has three parts: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three
have their own constituent parts. The
vipaksha is part of the third term, the
examples, and is a negative example
given to show that the claim made in
the initial assertion is one that reflects
the action of particular causes. For
example, in the inference, “there is
fire on the mountain because there is
smoke on the mountain,” the vipak-
sha could be “unlike a lake” since
lakes are places with neither fire nor
smoke, and thus shows that these
conditions are not universally present
(fire is found in mountains, but not in
lakes). By convention, an inference
also had to have a positive example,
the sapaksha, to show that similar
things happened in similar cases (i.e.,
that there were other cases in which
there was both fire and smoke).
Viparitakhyati
(“contrary discrimination”) Theory of
error propounded by the Mimamsa
philosopher Kumarila, who lived in the
seventh century C.E. All the theories of
error aim to explain why people make
errors in judgment, such as the stock
example of mistaking the silvery flash of
seashell for a piece of silver.
Like Prabhakara and the Naiya-
yikas, Kumarila believes that the sim-
ple judgments “that object is silvery”
and “silver is silvery” are both true
and indisputable. Kumarila also
agrees with the Naiyayika that the
error comes from a discrimination
that is contrary to reality. His differ-
ence with the Naiyayikas comes with
the latter’s postulation of the inher-
ence-relationship as connecting sub-
jects and predicates (“silver color”
and “silver”). Kumarila’s theory is
identity-and-difference (bhedabhada)
in which all things are what they are
and are not what they are not. Thus
the perception (pratyaksha) of the
shell on the beach would involve its
similarities and differences from sil-
veriness, combined with silver’s simi-
larities
and
differences
from
silveriness. One can combine the sim-
ilarities and get a false judgment, or
the differences and come up with a
true one. As in the Naiyayika theory of
error, the root cause for combining
the similarities rather than the differ-
ences comes from karmic dispositions
stemming from avidya, specifically
the greed for silver that prompts us to
look for such items of value. For fur-
ther information see Bijayananda Kar,

Vira
(“hero”) In the context of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
the vira is one of the modes of ritual
expression. The tantric “hero” is said to
be one who not only partakes of the Five
Forbidden Things (panchamakara)—
wine, fish, meat, parched grain, and sex-
ual intercourse—in their elemental
forms, but also uses this inversion of
normal moral rules as a way to affirm
the ultimate unity of all things in the
universe. Aspirants adopting a heroic
mode will often worship a powerful but
dangerous deity, in which the ultimate
affirmation of this unity is to affirm one’s
identity with that deity. If one can do
this successfully, it is believed to confer
various powers, but if one fails it is said
to lead to illness, insanity, or death. This
is not a path without hazards, but
through it the heroes quickly attain their
desired goals.
Virabhadra
In Hindu mythology, a powerful being
who is created by the god Shiva to hum-
ble the demigod Daksha and to destroy
Daksha’s sacrifice. Daksha gives his
daughter, Sati, to marry Shiva, but later
he feels that Shiva has not shown him
proper respect. To humble Shiva,
Daksha plans a great sacrifice and
invites all the gods except Shiva. When
Sati asks her father why he has done so,
Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless
and despicable. Humiliated by these
public insults, Sati commits suicide—in
some versions, by leaping into the sacri-
ficial fire, and in others by withdrawing
into a yogic trance and giving up her life.
In the most common version of
Virabhadra’s creation, Shiva is so
enraged when he learns of Sati’s death
that he tears out two matted locks (jata)
from his head and dashes them to the
[[756]]

ground. One matted lock takes form as
Virabhadra, and the second takes form
as Bhadrakali, a powerful and terrifying
form of the Goddess. Just as Virabhadra
represents Shiva’s destructive aspect,
Bhadrakali represents the ferocious and
dangerous side of the Goddess, in con-
trast with the gentle and loyal Sati. At
Shiva’s orders, the two demolish
Daksha’s sacrifice, scattering the guests
and destroying the sacred fires, until
Daksha finally repents and worships
Shiva as the supreme deity. Although
Virabhadra’s actions in this story are
destructive, he is and remains Shiva’s
servant, carrying out his divine master’s
commands, a mandate that ultimately
upholds the created order.
Viragal
(“Hero-stone”) Stone erected in memory
of a warrior, often the village headman,
who perished in battle while defending
the village cattle from pillage. Such
stones can be found all over the Deccan
region, and Deleury speculates that the
origins of the Maharashtrian god
Vithoba lay in such a deified hero, who
was later assimilated into the pantheon
as a form of Vishnu.
Viraha
(“separation”) Well-established poetic
genre in classical Sanskrit poetry and in
much of vernacular devotional (bhakti)
poetry. The genre focuses on describing
the pain resulting from the separation of
lover and beloved, whether the separat-
ed lovers are two human beings or devo-
tee (bhakta) and deity. Such separation
is believed to bring on specific physical
symptoms, which the poets describe in
detail—lack of appetite, insomnia,
inability to attend to daily life, or to
think about anyone but the beloved. The
sort of love felt in such separation is
believed to engender an even more
intense love for the beloved than love in
union because the latter is sweetened by
the presence of the beloved, whereas the
former has to stand by itself.Visarjana
Viramamunivar
Pseudonym of Father Constanzio Beschi
(1680–1747), an Italian Jesuit who lived
in Tamil Nadu for thirty-six years. Like
many of the other early Jesuits, Beschi
learned the local language and adopted
the local way of life. As part of his mis-
sionary work, he translated parts of the
Old and New Testament into literary
Tamil, and his facility with the language
and its poetic conventions make this
work a significant milestone in later
Tamil literature.
Viramitrodaya
One of the latest and the largest of the
nibandhas (“collections”), compiled in
the early seventeenth century by the
scholar Mitra Mishra. The nibandhas
were compendia of Hindu lore, in
which the compilers culled references
on a particular theme from the Vedas,
dharma literature, puranas, and other
authoritative religious texts, and then
compiled these excerpts into a single
volume. The Viramitrodaya is a massive
compendium of Hindu lore, each of
whose twenty-two sections is devoted to
a particular aspect of Hindu life, such as
daily practice, worship, gift-giving
(dana), vows, pilgrimage, penances
(prayashchitta), purification, death
rites (antyeshthi samskara), law, and so
forth, finally ending with liberation
(moksha). Aside from citing the relevant
scriptural passages, Mitra Mishra also
provides extensive learned commen-
tary, and his work became an important
source for later legal interpretation, par-
ticularly in eastern India.
Virasana
One of the sitting postures (asana)
described in commentaries to the Yoga
Sutras; this is also one of the sitting pos-
tures in which deities are portrayed in
Hindu iconography. As described in the
commentaries to the Yoga Sutras, in this
position one foot rests on the ground,
under the opposite thigh, while the
other foot rests on top of the opposite
knee. In modern yoga manuals this pos-
ture is described quite differently, as a
sitting posture with the legs folded back
outside the body, with the feet pressed
against the thighs and buttocks.
Virashaiva
(“Heroic Shaivas”) Another name for
the Lingayat religious community,
stemming from the Lingayat insistence
that the god Shiva was the only real god.
See Lingayat.
Virata
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Virata is the king
who shelters the five Pandava brothers,
the epic’s protagonists, during the year
they spend incognito, following their
twelve years of exile in the forest. This
year is critical because according to the
agreement that the Pandavas have
made with their adversary, Duryodhana,
if they are discovered during this year
the cycle of exile and living incognito
will begin again. Due to Virata’s care
and foresight the Pandavas are not
discovered, even though Duryodhana
has sent legions of spies to find them.
During the Mahabharata war he con-
tinues to support the Pandavas and is
eventually killed by the archery
master Drona.
Visarjana
(“dismissing”) The sixteenth and last of
the traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the
devotee (bhakta) gives the deity leave to
go, as the concluding rite in worship.
Although the word dismissal sounds
presumptuous in any interaction with a
deity, this term really refers to the words
of parting that one would say to any
departing guest. The underlying motive
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show
one’s love for the deity and minister to
the deity’s needs.

Vishakhadatta
Vishakhadatta
(6th c.) Sanskrit dramatist whose
only surviving work is the play
Mudrarakshasa (“Rakshasa’s Ring”).
The play is of some historical interest,
for its major theme is the rise of
Chandragupta Maurya (r. 321–297
B.C.E.), founder of the Maurya dynasty,
although the play ascribes his success to
the machinations of his cunning brah-
min minister, Chanakya. The play
paints the king as a weak figure, with the
minister as the real power behind the
throne, although in fairness to the
historical king this portrayal seems
inaccurate. The drama’s plot is highly
complex, as with many Sanskrit plays,
but its climax comes when the principal
characters are dramatically rescued
from execution at the last moment.
The play has been translated into
English by Michael Coulson, and
published in an anthology titled Three
Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Vishishthadvaita (“Qualified Non-
Dualism”) Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school purporting to
reveal the ultimate meaning and pur-
pose (anta) of the Vedas, the oldest and
most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Vishishthadvaita’s greatest figure
is the eleventh-century philosopher,
Ramanuja, who was central to its for-
mation, although he was building on
earlier work. Ramanuja was convinced
that Brahman or Supreme Reality was a
personal deity, rather than an imper-
sonal abstract principle, and he was
also convinced that devotion (bhakti)
was the most important form of reli-
gious
practice.
Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions and
thus opposed the position of the
Advaita Vedanta school, founded by
the philosopher Shankaracharya.
The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief in a single
[[758]]

impersonal Ultimate Reality, which they
call Brahman. For Advaita proponents,
reality is “nondual” (advaita)—that is,
all things are nothing but the formless
Brahman, despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity in the perceivable
world. For the Advaitins, this assump-
tion of diversity is a fundamental misun-
derstanding of the ultimate nature of
things and a manifestation of avidya.
Although often translated as “igno-
rance,” avidya is better understood as
the lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage, rein-
carnation (samsara), and suffering.
Since for the Advaitins the real problem
is this mistaken understanding, this
means that realization (jnana) was the
best spiritual path to gain final libera-
tion (moksha).
According to Ramanuja’s formula-
tion, the material world and selves have
real and independent existence,
although their existence is ultimately
rooted in God, whom he identifies as
Vishnu. The world comes from God in a
process of evolution adapted from the
Samkhya model, but since matter is
unconscious, it is both similar to and
different from God. In the same way,
human beings share similarity to God in
having God as their source, and differ-
ence from him in being subject to igno-
rance and suffering. For Ramanuja and
his followers, God is not identical to
Selves or the world, all of which are per-
ceived as having real and independent
existence. This doctrine of identity and
difference makes the perceivable world
real, in a sense that the Advaita propo-
nents would never admit. This same
contention of simultaneous identity and
difference distinguishes Ramanuja’s
position from that of a later thinker,
Madhva, whose Dvaita Vedanta stressed
the great gulf between God and all other
things. Given this difference in capaci-
ties between deity and devotee (bhakta),
Ramanuja and his followers have
stressed bhakti as the most efficacious
means to salvation. Even after liberation
the souls retain enough of a distinctionVishnu

from God to make devotion possible;
liberation is seen not as loss of identity,
but as eternal communion with God.

Vishnu
(“all-pervasive”) Along with Shiva and
the Goddess, one of the three most
important deities in the Hindu pan-
theon. All three of these are notable for
being almost unmentioned in the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts,
and the ascendancy of these three and
the gradual eclipse of the Vedic gods
points clearly to a definitive shift in
Hindu religious life. Of the three, Vishnu
has the most significant presence in the
Vedas. Many of the hymns in which he is
mentioned describe him as a helper to
the storm-god Indra, the primary Vedic
god, and one of Vishnu’s epithets here is
Upendra (“junior Indra”). Yet he also
appears in some of the late hymns as an
independent agent, who is associated
with marvelous deeds for the good of
the cosmos, such as taking three steps to
measure out the universe. Vishnu is also
associated with the sun, both in his abil-
ity to move through the heavens, and to
fall on (and thus “observe”) all things.
In the divine triad of Brahma-
Vishnu-Shiva, Vishnu is identified as the
sustainer or maintainer of the cosmos.
One manifestation of this can be seen in
a common creation myth, which begins
with Vishnu lying on the back of his ser-
pent couch, Shesha, in the primordial
ocean at the time of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). A lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s
navel, which opens to reveal Brahma,
the creator, who begins the work of cre-
ation. Vishnu presides over the creation,
and when the time for dissolution comes
again, the entire process reverses, and
the universe is drawn back into Vishnu,
who is thus seen as the source of all.
The other way that Vishnu sustains
the cosmos is through the action of his
avatars or incarnations, who come into
the world to restore balance to a uni-
verse dangerously out of equilibrium,
[[759]]
Vishnuchittar
usually because of a demon grown dis-
proportionately strong. There are ten
generally reckoned avatars. The first
four are in nonhuman forms: the Fish
avatar, Tortoise avatar, Boar avatar,
and Man-Lion avatar. The other six are
in human form, often as sages or heroes:
Vamana avatar, Parashuram avatar,
Rama avatar, Krishna avatar, Buddha
avatar, and Kalki avatar; the last has yet
to come. In each of these cases, Vishnu
takes form to avert some sort of disaster
and to maintain the integrity of the cos-
mos. The doctrine of the avatars provided
a mechanism to assimilate existing
deities into the larger pantheon and to
give them recognizable status of their
own. Although most of the avatars are
no longer objects of worship (the Boar
and Man-Lion avatars each had a sub-
stantial following early in the common
era), in much of northern India the wor-
ship of Rama and Krishna has largely
eclipsed that of Vishnu himself, who
has largely faded into the background.
In southern India, Vishnu is still
an important object of worship, particu-
larly in the Shrivaishnava community.
Aside from the doctrine of the avatars,
important local deities have also been
assimilated into the pantheon as forms
of Vishnu; the most significant
examples are Jagannath, Venkateshvara,
and Vithoba.
In medieval Hinduism sectarian
rivalry developed between Vaishnavas
and Shaivas, with each claiming that
their chosen deity (Vishnu and Shiva,
respectively) was supreme. Although
Vaishnavas see Vishnu as the supreme
power in the universe, his mythic char-
acter and activity differ sharply from
Shiva’s. Whereas Shiva is associated with
ascetic life and practices (tapas), and
thus with the religious power generated
by such practices, Vishnu’s headdress is
a crown, and his persona is that of an all-
ruling king. Whereas Shiva destroys his
mythic adversaries using raw power,
from which all subtlety is absent, Vishnu
more often triumphs through cunning,
cleverness, and trickery. Each deity’s
adherents affirm their divinity as the
[[760]]

preeminent power in the universe, from
which all the other gods gain their
power, and both are seen as gracious
and loving to their devotees (bhakta).
Vishnuchittar
An epithet of the Alvar poet-saint
Periyalvar. The Alvars were a group
of twelve poet-saints who lived in south-
ern India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and
their stress on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil
language, transformed Hindu religious
life. See Periyalvar.
Vishnu Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
which were an important genre of smrti
texts, and the repository of much of tra-
ditional Indian mythology. The smrtis or
“remembered” texts were a class of liter-
ature that although deemed important,
were considered less authoritative than
the shrutis or “heard” texts. In brief, the
shrutis denoted the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts, whereas the smrtis included the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, the
dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
and the puranas. The puranas are com-
pendia of all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Most of the puranas are
highly sectarian, and as this one’s name
clearly shows, it is focused on the wor-
ship of Vishnu. It gives an exhaustive
account of Vishnu’s mythic deeds—
many of which have become the com-
mon mythic currency for many
traditional Hindus—as well as instruc-
tions for how, where, and when Vishnu
is to be worshiped.
Vishnuswami
(“[He whose] Lord is Vishnu”)
According to tradition, the founder of
the Rudra Sampraday of the VaishnavaVishva Hindu Parishad
ascetics. (The Rudra Sampraday is one
of the four branches, “sampraday,” of
the Bairagi Naga ascetics, who are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu; vaish-
nava refers to devotees of Vishnu.)
Vishnuswami was an ascetic, whom
some sources name as the guru of both
Jnaneshvar and Namdev. As his name
clearly shows, Vishnuswami was a
Vaishnava, although other than this lit-
tle is known about him. His ascetic line
and its position as one of the four
Vaishnava ascetic sampradays have
been appropriated by the followers of
Vallabhacharya, whose Shuddadvaita,
or “Pure Monism,” stresses the worship
of Krishna, with Radha as his consort.
Vishuddha Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret, ritually based religious practice
known as tantra, the vishuddha chakra
is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) believed to exist in the sub-
tle body. The subtle body is an alter-
nate physiological system, believed to
exist on a different plane than gross
matter, but with certain correspon-
dences to the material body. It is visu-
alized as a set of six psychic centers,
which are visualized as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along
the course of the spine, connected by
three vertical channels. Each of these
chakras has important symbolic asso-
ciations—with differing human capac-
ities, with different subtle elements
(tanmatras), and with different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet,
thus encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of Shiva (awareness)
and Shakti (power), the two divine
principles through which the entire
universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept of the subtle body is thus the
homology of macrocosm and micro-
cosm, an essential Hindu idea since
the time of the mystical texts known as
the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated from the bottom up, and the
vishuddha chakra is the fifth. It is visual-
ized as a sixteen-petaled lotus, located
in the region of the throat. The petals
each contain a seed syllable formed
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in
this case all sixteen of the Sanskrit vow-
els, the essential connecting elements
for any meaningful speech. On a sym-
bolic level, the vishuddha chakra is asso-
ciated with the human capacity for
speech and respiration. It is also identi-
fied as the bodily seat for the subtle ele-
ment of space (akasha), through which
hearing is believed to take place. For fur-
ther information see Arthur Avalon (Sir
John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; and Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973.
Vishva Hindu Parishad
(“World Hindu Organization,” hereafter
VHP) Modern Hindu religious organiza-
tion affiliated with the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a conserva-
tive Hindu organization whose express
purpose is to provide the leadership
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The
VHP was formed in 1964, when RSS leader
Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar met in
Bombay with a group of Hindu religious
leaders. Their immediate concern was
the upcoming visit of Pope Paul VI to
India, which they interpreted as a con-
cealed attempt to convert Hindus to
Christianity, and resolved to oppose by
forming an organization dedicated to
the propagation of Hinduism. For the
next fifteen years, the VHP focused its
attention on countering Christian mis-
sionary efforts in northeastern India,
with little fanfare and little impact on
the public consciousness.
A watershed in the VHP’s public image
came in 1982, following the conversion
of some untouchables to Islam in the
Tamil Nadu village of Minakshipuram.
The VHP used this much-publicized
event as evidence that Hindu identity
was endangered and countered it by
launching a series of innovative public
[[761]]
Vishvakarma
actions, first in Tamil Nadu, but later
extending throughout the entire nation.
The VHP’s renewed activity corresponded
with a more activist bent in its parent
organization, the RSS, as well as the deci-
sion by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
a political organization that is also an RSS
affiliate, to assume a more militantly
Hindu identity. Many of the VHP’s
national campaigns coincided with
national or state elections, and many of
these centered on the campaign to build
a temple to the god Rama in the city of
Ayodhya, at the site claimed to be
Rama’s birthplace. The site on which
they proposed to build the temple was
occupied by a Muslim mosque, the
Babri Masjid, which the VHP claimed
had been built only after tearing down
the original Rama temple. This temple
campaign thus carried powerful images
of past oppression, as well as the
assertiveness of a renascent Hindu iden-
tity. The VHP’s activism has enormously
boosted the BJP’s political fortunes, and
helped make it the dominant political
party through much of northern India.
The VHP’s activism has generated
sharply contrasting emotions through-
out India. Proponents point to its long
record of social service and its role in
helping strengthen and define a mod-
ern Hindu identity. Detractors point to
its disregard for the niceties of law,
which was epitomized by the destruc-
tion of the Babri Masjid in December
[[1992]]
, its often vitriolic anti-Muslim
rhetoric, and its ultimate control by the
RSS, despite its separate institutional
identity. Other critics have censured
the VHP for attempting to declare cer-
tain “required” Hindu rites as antitheti-
cal to the Hindu tradition and for
attempting to define and control the
nature of “Hinduism.” Other critics
question the organization’s claim to
speak for all Hindus, noting that its real
power lies in the hands of brahmins and
other privileged classes; these critics see
the VHP as an organization designed to
conceal its true purpose, the mainte-
nance of upper-class influence and priv-
ilege. For further information see Walter

Vishvakarma
(“doing all things”) A minor deity whose
mythic roles include being the architect
of the gods; creator of innumerable
handicrafts, ornaments, and weapons;
the finest sculptor; and the inventor of
the aerial chariots used by the gods. He
is the patron and paradigm for all the
skilled crafts in which materials are
shaped and formed, and in particular he
is said to have fixed the canons for carv-
ing images of the gods. According to one
story, Vishvakarma’s daughter, Sanjna,
is married to Surya, the sun, but
because of the sun’s radiance cannot
bear to be with him. Vishvakarma takes
the sun to his workshop and trims off
enough of his effulgence so that Sanjna
can bear his brightness. He then shapes
the cut-off pieces of the sun into the
god Vishnu’s discus (Sudarshana), the
god Shiva’s trident (trishul), various
other divine weapons, and the Pushpak
Viman, the most famous of the
aerial chariots.
Vishvakarma is sometimes identified
with Tvashtr, the workman of the gods
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Yet it seems that these are two dif-
ferent deities, homologized to each
other through their common function.
Tvashtr’s name means “builder of car-
riages,” and this seems to have been his
primary function, although he is also
noted for crafting the weapons of the
gods, especially the mace with which
the storm-god Indra slays the serpent
Vrtra. Still, his name seems to indi-
cate that his major function is in
building carriages, which is believed
to be highly significant in a Vedic con-
text, since many Vedic hymns mentionVishvanath
the use of military chariots. Vishvakarma,
on the other hand, has much more
wide-ranging skills, and this would
seem to indicate that the two are not the
same deity.
Vishvamitra
In Hindu mythology, one of the Seven
Sages whose names mark exogamous
clan “lineages” (gotra; in exogamous
clans, members marry outside their own
clan); the others are Gautama,
Bharadvaja, Kashyapa, Bhrgu, Atri,
and Vasishtha. All brahmins are
believed to be descended from these
seven sages, with each family taking the
name of its progenitor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra divisions
are still important because marriage
within the gotra is forbidden. After her
marriage, the new bride adopts her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
Vishvamitra is most famous for his
long-standing feud with the sage
Vasishtha, which causes numerous con-
frontations. The feud begins as a result
of the difference in status between ksha-
triyas and brahmins. Vishvamitra is a
king, who once stops with a host of
retainers at the forest ashram of the
brahmin Vasishtha. Upon asking for
food, Vishvamitra is amazed at the
ability of Vasishtha’s cow, the Kama-
dhenu, to provide food for everyone.
Vishvamitra first tries to buy the
Kamadhenu, then tries to take it by
force, but his minions are defeated by
the magic powers generated by
Vasishtha’s tapas (ascetic practices).
Vishvamitra finally admits defeat and
begins to do ascetic practices to gener-
ate power of his own. Two of their most
celebrated clashes are over King
Trishanku and his son, Harishchandra;
in each case the real issue is the mutual
antipathy of these two sages. See also

Vishvanath
Form of the god Shiva, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of the Universe” at the
Vishvanath Temple
Vishvanath temple in Benares. Shiva is
present at Vishvanath in the form of a
linga, the pillar-shaped image that is his
symbolic form; the Vishvanath linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva, and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. Benares, or Varanasi, is one of
the most sacred cities in India; it is
considered particularly sacred to Shiva,
and of all the Shiva temples there,
Vishvanath is the most important. The
original temple was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb, who built
a mosque on the site, and the only
remaining part of the original temple is
the Gyan Vapi (“well of knowledge”),
into which the original Shiva linga was
reportedly cast (to save it from desecra-
tion by Aurangzeb’s soldiers). The pre-
sent temple was built in 1776 by the
Maratha queen Ahalya Bai Holkar, on a
site adjoining the original temple. It was
later roofed with gold by Maharaja
Ranjit Singh of Lahore, and thus one of
its nicknames is the “Golden Temple.”
Even in preceding centuries the his-
tory and proximity of the Vishvanath

temple and Aurangzeb’s mosque made
for delicate relations between the Hindu
and Muslim communities, and like
many northern Indian cities Benares has
seen its share of bloodshed between
these two communities. In recent times
the destruction of the original Vishvanath
temple has been taken up as a political
issue by the Vishva Hindu Parishad
(VHP), a Hindu activist organization
calling for the “return” of this and other
northern Indian sites by force if neces-
sary. The VHP’s presence and activity have
significantly escalated tensions between
Hindus and Muslims as a whole. Given
the political gains that these confronta-
tional strategies have brought, it seems
likely that they will continue in the future
and that the Vishvanath temple will be a
site connected with conflict.
Vishva Nirmala Dharam
Religious organization founded by the
modern Hindu teacher Nirmala Devi
(b. 1923), to propagate her teachings
throughout the world.

Vishvedevas
This name can either be construed as
referring to all the gods, based on the
term’s literal meaning (“all the gods”), or
it can refer to a group of deities reck-
oned as the sons of Vishva, the daugh-
ter of the divine sage Daksha. The
number of sons differs according to dif-
ferent texts and is reckoned at either ten
or thirteen. The Vishvedevas are espe-
cially worshiped at the memorial rites
for the dead known as shraddhas,
although the Manu Smrti, one of the
authoritative texts in the dharma litera-
ture, prescribes offerings to them every
day. These prescribed daily offerings are
said to have been their reward for hav-
ing performed particularly harsh asceti-
cism (tapas).
Vismaya (“surprise”) Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the forearm and the fingers are
pointing upward, with the back of the
hand turned toward the viewer. ThisVitthala
particular hasta is meant to convey
any sort of surprise, including wonder
and astonishment.
Vital Winds
General term to designate the five inter-
nal winds collectively known as prana,
through which all human physiological
processes are believed to occur.
Vithoba
Presiding deity of the temple with the
same name in the city of Pandharpur in
the state of Maharashtra; other epithets
for Vithoba include Vitthala and
Pandurang. Vithoba was originally a
local deity—according to some theories,
a deified hero—who has been assimilated
into the larger Hindu pantheon as a
form of the god Vishnu. According to
the temple’s charter myth, Vishnu
comes to Pandharpur drawn by the filial
devotion of a young boy named
Pundalika. When Vishnu arrives
Pundalika is massaging his father’s feet,
and when Vishnu asks for the hospitality
due to any guest, Pundalika stops only
long enough to throw a brick over his
shoulder, to give the god a place to stand
out of the mud. Impressed that
Pundalika’s devotion to his parents
supersedes even his devotion to God,
Vishnu becomes rooted to that spot and
has remained there ever since; Vithoba’s
image shows him with his hands on his
hips (still waiting, perhaps, for
Pundalika). Aside from this story,
Vithoba has surprisingly little mythic
history, although he has become an
important regional deity.
Vithoba is most famous for the activ-
ities of his devotees (bhakta), the
Varkari Panth religious community,
who make pilgrimages to Pandharpur
twice a year. Pandharpur sits in the
Bhima River valley on the edge of the
Maharashtra-Karnataka border, and
pilgrims come from all directions.
Individual pilgrims travel in small
groups called dindis, often made up of
people from the same neighborhood or
locality. The dindis are organized into
larger groups known as palkhis, each of
which is associated with one of the
Varkari poet-saints, and which is led by
a palanquin (palkhi) bearing the san-
dals of that saint. Each palkhi departs
from a place associated with its particu-
lar saint—for example, the palkhi of
Jnaneshvar leaves from the town of
Alandi in which he lived, and thus he
and all the other saints are still symboli-
cally journeying to Pandharpur twice a
year. Each of these palkhis travels a pre-
scribed route, and pilgrims time their
departure and their travel to arrive in
Pandharpur on the same day—the
eleventh day (ekadashi) in the bright
half of Ashadh (June–July) in the sum-
mer, and the eleventh day in the bright
half of Kartik (October–November) in
the fall. Pilgrims compare their journey
to that of a small stream merging with
other streams, gradually forming a
mighty river converging on Pandharpur.
During their journey pilgrims sing
the devotional songs composed by
these poet-saints, among them
Jnaneshvar, Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram,
Chokamela, Gora, Janabai, and Bahina
Bai. In this way, the pilgrims are emulat-
ing the saints before them, both by
treading in their physical footsteps and
by singing their songs of devotion.
Although the pilgrimage ends with the
entry to Pandharpur and the worship of
Vithoba, the most important part is the
journey itself. For more information on
Vithoba and the Varkari sect, see G. A.

Vitthala
Common epithet of Vithoba, the presid-
ing deity of a famous temple at
Pandharpur in the state of Maharashtra.
The name Vitthala is a more literary
form, and according to Deleury, the old-
est attested name for the Pandharpur
deity. See Vithoba.

Vitthalnath
VitthalnathVivarana Advaita
(r. 1566–1585) Second guru of the
Pushti Marg (a religious community),
which was founded by his father,
Vallabhacharya. Vitthalnath continued
the consolidation of the Pushti Marg, in
particular the organization of its rites,
and in fostering the composition of
songs and poetry to accompany them.
According to tradition, the eight poets
known as the ashtachap were all active
during his tenure, although four of them
are more closely associated with his
father. The four poets associated with
Vitthalnath were clearly members of the
Pushti Marg, for among their poetry can
be found hymns praising him and his
leadership. He was succeeded by his son
Gokulnath, under whose direction the
lives of these and other saints were final-
ly written down, with each being given a
Vallabhite emphasis.One of the later schools of Advaita
Vedanta, a philosophical school, the great-
est figure in which was Shankaracharya.
The Advaita school upholds a philosophi-
cal position known as monism, which is
the belief in a single impersonal Ultimate
Reality, which they call Brahman. For
Advaita proponents, reality is “nondual”
(advaita)—that is, all things are nothing
but the formless Brahman, despite the
appearance of difference and diversity in
the perceivable world. For the Advaitins,
this assumption of diversity is a funda-
mental misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things and a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
which ultimately causes human beings
to be trapped in karmic bondage,
reincarnation (samsara), and suffering.
Because the real problem for the
Advaitins is this mistaken understanding,
this means that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path to gain final
liberation (moksha).
The Vivarana Advaita school is based
on the thought of Padmapada (9th c.),
one of Shankaracharya’s disciples,
but takes its name from a commentary
written by the thirteenth-century
Prakashatman. The latter is traditionally
a disciple of Padmapada’s, but this seems
problematic. As with the Bhamati
school, the Vivarana school took defini-
tive stands on several points on which
Shankaracharya had remained silent.
One of these was on the locus of igno-
rance, which the Vivarana school
describes as being located in Brahman.
In explaining how this can be, since it
seems to compromise the integrity of
Brahman, the Vivarana Advaitins invoke
the theory of reflectionism to explain the
apparent difference between Brahman
and the Self, although, in fact, the Selves
are identical with Brahman. Their posi-
tion seems based more than anything on
an uncompromising affirmation of
Brahman as the sole “reality,” in which
anything that exists must belong to it.
Vivaha (“uplift”) Samskara
Traditionally, the fifteenth of the life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
a man and woman became husband
and wife. Except for those rare individu-
als who remained lifelong celibates
(naisthika brahmacharin), marriage
was an essential element in the life
of every man (and woman), since the
children procreated through marriage
allowed him to retire one of the three
debts, this one to the ancestral spirits
(pitr). One mark of the importance given
to marriage can be seen in the literal
translation of the word vivaha—it
signifies that by which a man is
“uplifted” and made complete. Given
the stress on family in Indian society,
marriage has also been a gravely
important matter, and for many
Indians, it remains the most important
day of their life. The dharma
literature underlines the importance of
marriage by cataloging eight different
forms. See also marriage, eight
classical forms.

Vivekananda, Swami
Vivartavada
A philosophical model used to explain
the relationship between the Ultimate
Reality or Realities and the perceivable
world; this model describes the world as
an illusory transformation of this reality.
The vivartavada model is unique to the
Advaita Vedanta philosophical school.
The Advaitins are proponents of a
causal model called satkaryavada,
which assumes that effects already exist
in their causes, and that when these
effects appear, they represent transfor-
mations (parinama) of those causes. The
classic example is the transformation of
milk to curds, butter, and clarified but-
ter. According to asatkarya’s proponents,
each of these effects was already present
in the cause and emerges from it through
a natural transformation of that cause.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality lies behind all things and that all
things are merely differing forms of that
reality. Advaita proponents exemplify this
belief in their claim that reality is nondual
(advaita)—that is, that all things are “actu-
ally” nothing but the formless, unqualified
Brahman, despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity in the world. The
Advaitins’ belief that an effect already
exists in its cause comes from the princi-
ple that all things in the universe ultimate-
ly depend on Brahman as a first cause. At
the same time the Advaitins are unwilling
to admit that Brahman ever undergoes
actual change because this would nullify
its eternal and unchanging nature. For this
reason, they speak of an illusory transfor-
mation (vivartavada). For the Advaitins,
Brahman never really changes, because it
is eternal and thus unchanging; the
apparent changes are only illusory, based
on human ignorance through changing
patterns of superimposition (adhyasa). In
this way the Advaitins can maintain the
transcendence of Brahman and at the
same time account for the (apparent)
changes in the phenomenal world.
This position is contested by propo-
nents of another model, which describes
the perceivable world as an actual trans-
formation of this single reality. This posi-
tion is espoused by proponents of the
Samkhya, Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, and
Bhedabhada philosophical schools, who
like the Advaitins are also proponents of
satkaryavada. Each of these three schools
believes that the world as perceived is real,
that it has some single ultimate source
behind it, and that this first principle
undergoes a real transformation by which
the world comes into being. This parina-
ma relationship allows these schools to
explain the phenomenal world but in a
way that compromises the transcendence
of these first principles by making them
part of the world. Philosophically, their
difficulties come in describing how the
transcendent can become mundane, and
then become transcendent again.

Surya, the Sun. See Surya.
Vivekananda, Swami
(b. Narendranath Datta 1863–1902) Best-
known disciple of the Bengali mystic
Ramakrishna and also the first Hindu
missionary to the West. Narendranath had
received a good education and had origi-
nally intended to be a lawyer; on meeting
Ramakrishna he was initially skeptical and
questioning but in the course of a year
became transformed. After Ramakrishna’s
death he spent several years roaming
through India, gradually coming to the
conclusion that religious life had to
address India’s material needs as well as its
spiritual ones. Vivekananda is most
famous for his address to the First World
Parliament of Religions in Chicago in
[[1893]]
, in which Hinduism—in its rational,
Vedantic form—was first seriously
received by his Western hearers. For the
next four years, he lectured in America
and in England and returned to India to
widespread acclaim. He devoted the rest
of his short life to fostering the
Ramakrishna Mission, a religious organi-
zation intended to promote social uplift as
[[767]]

well as religious education. For further

of Swami Vivekananda, 1970; and George
M. Williams, “Swami Vivekananda,” and

Religious Change,” both in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Vraj
Variant form of the region known as
Braj. This is the land in which the
god Krishna is believed to have lived,
located in the southwestern part of the
state of Uttar Pradesh just south of
Delhi, the national capital. See Braj.
Vrat
Term denoting a religious vow, usually
thought to be derived from the verb
meaning “to choose.” As religious obser-
vances, vrats are an important part of
modern Hindu life. They may refer to
religious practices performed once a
year with particular festivals, such as the
vrat performed on Shivaratri, or to
more regular religious observances,
such as those connected to the monthly
lunar calendar (e.g., the ekadashi rites)
or those performed on the day of the
week associated with a particular patron
deity. The specific prescriptions for
these vrats vary widely, but there are
several common features. They usually
involve modification of diet—some-
times through fasting (upavasa), and
other times by eating or avoiding cer-
tain types of food. Another constant fea-
ture is worship of the presiding deity.
Part of this worship usually involves
reading or hearing the vrat’s charter
myth, which tells how the vrat was
established, how one should perform it,
and what sort of benefits it brings. Vrats
connected with festivals are performed
by all sorts of people, but weekly vrats
(such as the Santoshi Ma Vrat) are most
often performed by married women to
promote the health, safety, and prosper-
ity of their families. Although such
[[768]]

weekly vrats are theoretically voluntary,
they have become an expected element
in women’s religious life, through which
women by their sacrifices can safeguard
their family’s welfare. For further con-
sideration of women’s rites, see Mary
McGee, “Desired Fruits: Motive And
Intention in the Votive Rites of Hindu
Women,” in Julia Leslie, ed., Roles and
Rituals for Hindu Women, 1991; and
Doranne Jacobson and Susan S. Wadley,
Women in India, 1992.
Vratya
In the Atharva Veda, one of the earliest
Hindu religious texts, the vratyas were a
particular class of vagrant ascetics who
were priests of a non-Vedic fertility cult.
Not much is known about them because
there are no other sources, but they were
clearly outside the Vedic cult and thus
looked down upon. In later times, the
word is used to designate a person who
has lost caste through nonobservance of
one of the necessary samskaras (life-
cycle ceremonies).
Vrindavan
Variant form of Brindavan, the village in
southeastern part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh in which the god Krishna is
believed to have lived from infancy to
adolescence. See Brindavan.
Vrtra
(“obstruction”) The name of the demon
killed by the storm-god Indra in one of the
hymns from the Rg Veda (1.32), the oldest
Hindu religious text. In this hymn Vrtra is
described as a serpent obstructing the free
flow of waters, hence his name. The action
in this hymn is one of Indra’s defining
deeds, in which he destroys the serpent,
cuts it into pieces, and releases the waters
to run free. Some interpreters inclined to
read the Vedas as historical record have
seen in this hymn the breaching of the
dams constructed by the Indus Valley civ-
ilization by the incoming Aryans, but
there is little proof that such an incident
ever happened.Vyas
Vyakarana
(“analysis”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the auxiliary branches of
knowledge connected with the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts, and all
the Vedangas were associated with the
use of the Vedas. In its essence,
vyakarana is the study of Sanskrit gram-
mar, which was obviously essential to
understanding the Vedic texts (which
were written in Sanskrit). Vyakarana’s
role as the gatekeeper to the Sanskrit
language made grammar the queen
of the traditional learned sciences,
and in many contexts it is what is
meant by the term vidya (“knowledge”).
Aside from vyakarana, the other
Vedangas are shiksha (correct pronun-
ciation), chandas (Sanskrit prosody),
kalpa (ritual instructions), nirukta
(etymology), and jyotisha (auspicious
times for sacrifices).
Vyakhyana (“teaching”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended, and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the hand
gesture used to signify explanation or
exposition; for this reason, it is also
known as the sandarshana (“exposit-
ing”) mudra. Since the teaching gesture
indicates a person of higher spiritual
attainment, it is also known as the chin
(“consciousness”) mudra.
Vyana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily “winds” considered to be
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, udana,
and samana. Unlike all the others,
which are given specific locations in the
body, the vyana wind is believed to per-
vade throughout the body, to keep
things moving and mixed together.

Vyapti
(“pervasion”) In classical Indian philos-
ophy, vyapti is the key condition deter-
mining the validity of an inference
(anumana). The accepted form of an
inference has three terms: An assertion
(pratijna) containing the thing to be
proved, a reason (hetu) containing
evidence to support the assertion, and
supporting examples (drshtanta). In
the stock example “there is fire on
the mountain, because there is smoke
on the mountain,” the assertion is
that there is fire, and the reason is that
there is smoke—with the underlying
assumption that smoke invariably
accompanies fire. In a valid inference,
the reason accounts for every case of
the thing to be proven; vyapti, or perva-
sion, is the term for this invariable
association between cause and effect.

Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Vyas
In the traditional Ram Lila (name given
to any public dramatic presentation of
the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics), vyas is the name
[[769]]
Vyasa
given to the stage directors. The
Ramnagar Ram Lila is the longest, most
elaborate, and arguably the oldest of
these dramas. In the Ramnagar Ram
Lila, one vyas is responsible for the
svarups, the brahmin boys who are
playing the parts of the divinities, and
who are considered manifestations of
the deities when they are “in character.”
The other vyas is responsible for the rest
of the cast. Between them they shift
the action between chorus and cast, give
the actors minute directions for their
acting, and prompt them when they
forget their lines. As such, they are visi-
ble agents themselves and an important
part of the Ram Lila.
Vyasa
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is tradi-
tionally considered to be the author of
the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Sanskrit epics. Vyasa is the son of
the sage Parashara as a result of his dal-
liance with the ferrywoman Satyavati.
Later in life Satyavati marries King
Shantanu but only after extracting the
promise that their children will rule,
instead of Shantanu’s eldest son,
Bhishma. Satyavati’s first son dies in
childhood, and the second dies after his
marriage but before having any chil-
dren. In her desperation to preserve
Shantanu’s line, Satyavati calls on Vyasa
to sleep with her younger son’s wives,
Ambika and Ambalika. According to
tradition Vyasa is very ugly, and both of
the women involuntarily react when
Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambalika
turns pale, causing her son, Pandu, to be
born with an unnaturally pale complex-
ion, and Ambika covers her eyes, caus-
ing her son, Dhrtarashtra, to be born
blind. Vyasa also has sexual relations
with Ambika’s maidservant, who gives
herself to him willingly, and from her is
born Vidura. The descendants of Pandu
and Dhrtarashtra are the Pandavas and
Kauravas, respectively, who are the two
[[770]]

warring factions whose enmity drives
the Mahabharata. Thus Vyasa is not only
the author of the Mahabharata, but also
the source of the two families whose
struggle is described in it.White Yajur Veda
