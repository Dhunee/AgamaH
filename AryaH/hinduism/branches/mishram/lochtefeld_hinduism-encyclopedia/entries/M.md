Madhava
(from madhu “sweet”) Epithet of the
god Krishna, signifying the sweetness
that he brings to the lives of his devotees
(bhakta). See Krishna.
Madhava
(2) (14th c.) Author of the Sarvadar-
shanasangraha, a philosophical encyclo-
pedia composed in the late fourteenth
century. In this text, Madhava com-
piles the views of all existing philo-
sophical schools, placing them in
hierarchical order, based on his judg-
ment of their value. According to the
text, the materialist school is ranked
the lowest and least reliable, since its
proponents completely deny the
virtue of any religious life. The Advaita
Vedanta school, Madhava’s own, is
judged as the highest and most perfect
expression of the truth. Although the
Sarvadarshanasangraha is biased, it is
one of the few extant sources which
considers the perspectives of all the
existing schools.
Madhima
(“greatness”) One of the eight superhu-
man powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred by high spiritu-
al attainment. This particular power
gives one the ability to become as large
as one desires.
Madhu
In Hindu mythology, one of the two
demons who attempt to kill the god
Brahma; the other demon is Kaitabha.
The story is recounted in several mythic
sources with some marked differences
between stories. All versions agree that
Madhu and Kaitabha are born from the
god Vishnu’s ear wax during the period
of cosmic dissolution (pralaya). As the
creation of the world begins anew, a
lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s navel. It
opens to reveal the creator-god Brahma,
who is immediately menaced by Madhu
and Kaitabha. In all versions of the
myth, Brahma appeals for help, and
Vishnu tricks the demons and slays
them. The difference in the stories
pertains to the deity to whom Brahma
appeals for help. The story first
appears in the mythology of Vishnu;
here Brahma invokes Vishnu. Yet this
same story also appears in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest source in
which the Mother Goddess appears as
the supreme divine power. In this ver-
sion, Brahma’s hymn of praise is to the
Goddess, who in her form as Yoganidra
(“sleep of yoga”) has lulled Vishnu into a
cosmic stupor, rendering him unable to
come to Brahma’s aid. Pleased by
Brahma’s praise, the Goddess withdraws
her influence over Vishnu; he awakens,
and slays the demons.
Madhurya (“Honeyed”) Bhava
The second of the five modes of devo-
tion to God that were articulated by
Rupa Goswami, a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Krishna and a follower of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya. Rupa used
human relationships to describe the
connection between devotee and deity.
The five modes showed growing emo-
tional intensity, from the peaceful
(shanta) sense that comes from realiz-
ing one’s complete identity with
Brahman or Ultimate Reality, to con-
ceiving of God as one’s master, friend,
child, or lover. The Madhurya Bhava is
the last and most intense of the five
modes of devotion. In this mode, devo-
tees consider the relationship between
themselves and the deity as that of lover
and beloved. This mode appeared most
prominently with regard to the god
Krishna (in which the model devotees
were the cowherd women of Braj), and
[[395]]
Madhusudana Saraswati
Radha (who is a symbol for the human
soul.) This particular mode is seen as the
most intense and demanding because of
its emotional closeness. For that same
reason, it is also seen as the sweetest.
Madhusudana Saraswati
(16th c.) A renowned member of the
Sanyasi community, a group of renun-
ciant ascetics who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. His last name reveals
that he was a member of the Saraswati
sect, one of the most prestigious of the
ten Dashanami divisions; he is said to
have lived most of his life in Benares,
the greatest religious center of his
time. According to ascetic legend,
Madhusudana was responsible for the
creation of a class of fighting ascetics,
the Naga Sanyasis. According to tradi-
tion, Madhusudana created these fight-
ers because he was distressed at the
depredations the Sanyasis suffered at
the hands of hostile Muslim faqirs. After
consulting with Birbal, adviser to
Moghul emperor Akbar, Madhusudana
decided to form a fighting ascetic
order dedicated to protecting other
ascetics. Recruits came from the ranks
of the shudras.
Madhva
(1197–1276) Philosopher and founder of
the Dvaita Vedanta philosophical
school, whose long life was largely spent
in Udupi, a small town near the Malabar
coast in the state of Karnataka.
Madhva’s basic philosophy was the utter
transcendence of God. This conviction
led him to develop the theory of
dualism, which posits a qualitative
difference between God in his
transcendence and the corruptions of
material things. According to Madhva,
God is completely different from
humans and the material world, even
though both came from God and
depend on Him for their continuing
existence. Madhva differed sharply
from the major school, Advaita
Vedanta, which upheld the theory of
[[396]]

monism—the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality (called Brahman) lies
behind all things, which are merely
differing forms of this single reality.
Whereas Advaita collapses all things
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists
on maintaining differences.
Madhva’s emphasis on dualism led
him to articulate these differences,
known as the “fivefold difference”: the
difference between God and Self,
between God and the world, between
individual Selves, between Selves and
matter, and between individual material
things. Even though each Self contains
an aspect of God, fundamental differ-
ence gives the Self only limited capacity
for religious life. This limited power
means that final liberation of the soul
comes solely through the grace of God,
who alone has the power to effect it.
Final liberation was conceived both as
freedom from rebirth and as the soul’s
opportunity to remain in the divine
presence forever.
Madhya Pradesh
(“middle state”) Modern Indian state
located in the geographical center of the
subcontinent. Madhya Pradesh was
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 from the former Central Provinces,
Berar State, and several princely states.
Large parts of the state are inaccessible
and relatively undeveloped, particularly
in the Vindhya Mountain and Satpura
ranges. Madhya Pradesh also has a large
percentage of adivasis (indigenous trib-
al people), many of whom are very poor.
Madhya Pradesh contains many impor-
tant archaeological sites, including the
Chandella temples at Khajuraho and
the caves at Udayagiri. Sacred sites
(tirthas) include the Narmada River,
one of the seven sacred rivers of India,
and the holy city of Ujjain. For general
information about Madhya Pradesh and
other regions of India, see Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.Madurai
The Vishvanath Temple at Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, dates back to 1002 C.E.
Madmaheshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas, about
twenty miles north of the village of
Ukhimath. The temple’s presiding deity
is the god Shiva in his manifestation as
Madmaheshvar. Madmaheshvar is one
of the Panchkedar, a network of five
sacred sites in the Garhwal region; the
other four sites are Kedarnath,
Rudranath, Tungnath, and Kalpeshvar.
This network of five sites is seen as
a symbolic representation of Shiva’s
body; Madmaheshvar is believed to
be Shiva’s navel.woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods and to have a son
equal in power to that god himself. With
Pandu’s blessing, Kunti teaches the
mantra to Madri, who recites it to
the twin gods known as the Ashvins.
Thus she bears twins. They live happily
until springtime comes to the forest.
Under the intoxicating influence of
spring, Pandu embraces Madri; the
curse takes effect, and Pandu falls
down dead. Because of her role in
Pandu’s death, Madri consigns her
children to Kunti’s care, and ends her life
on Pandu’s funeral pyre.
MadriMadurai
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Madri is the junior
wife of King Pandu and the mother of
Nakula and Sahadeva. Neither of these
children are actually Pandu’s sons, since
he has been cursed to die the moment
he holds his wife in amorous embrace.
Rather, they have been magically con-
ceived through the effect of a mantra
given to Pandu’s other wife, Kunti, by
the sage Durvasas. The mantra gives the
Temple-town and sacred site (tirtha) on
the Vygai River, in the state of Tamil
Nadu in southern India. Madurai is
most famous for the large temple
dedicated to Minakshi, the goddess,
and her consort Sundareshvara.
Minakshi is a local deity who has
become a major regional goddess,
whereas Sundareshvara is considered
a form of the god Shiva. After the fall
of the Vijayanagar empire late in the
[[397]]
Madya
sixteenth century, southern India was
ruled by the Nayak dynasty, with the
capital at Madurai. Much of the
Minakshi temple was built by Tirumalai
Nayak (r. 1623-1659); his palace is
another of the city’s attractions. The
streets around the temple form four
concentric processional circuits, with
the temple directly in the middle. The
town was planned as a lotus with layers
of petals, with the image of Minakshi at
the center, around which all things
revolved. Symbolically, the Minakshi
temple was not only the center of the
city, but the center of the earth. See also
Vijayanagar dynasty.
Magh
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Magh is the eleventh
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within January and February. During
Magh there is a month-long bathing
(snana) festival, the Magh Mela, at the
confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers in Allahabad. The other major fes-
tivals in Magh are Sakata Chauth,
Shattila Ekadashi, Mauni Amavasya,
Vasant Panchami, Bhishma Ashtami,
Jaya Ekadashi, Ravidas Jayanti, Makara
Sankranti. In southern India, Pongal
and the Float Festival are celebrated
during Magh.
Madya
(“wine”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, wine is
the first of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara). Since “respectable”
Hindu society strongly condemns the
consumption of alcoholic beverages, its
ritual use in tantra must be understood
in the larger tantric context. One of the
most basic tantric assumptions is the
ultimate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that
the entire universe is one principle
means that the adept must reject all
concepts based on dualistic thinking.
One way to do this is to partake of the
“Five Forbidden Things,” consciously
breaking the societal norms forbidding
the consumption of intoxicants, non-
vegetarian food, and illicit sexuality—
making sacred that which is normally
forbidden. Tantric adepts cite such ritual
use of forbidden things as proof that
their practice involves a more exclusive
qualification (adhikara), and is thus
superior to common practice. In its ritual
use—which is usually in very small
quantities—the intoxication produced
by wine is an approximation of the bliss
of realization. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti
and Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the
Three Cities, 1990.
[[398]]

Magha
(7th c.) Sanskrit writer whose best-
known work, the drama Shishupala-
vadha, describes the death of
Shishupala at the hands of the god
Krishna.
In
Hindu
mythology,
Shishupala is a form of Jaya, Vishnu’s
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be
born as a demon three times and killed
each time by Vishnu. Shishupala is the
last of these births, after which the curse
is broken. Aside from its mythic theme,
the play is noted for a number of unusu-
al verses, designed to show the poet’s
skill. These include verses that are per-
fect palindromes and ones that use only
one or two consonants.
Magh Mela
Religious festival celebrated every year
during the entire lunar month of Magh
( January–February) in the city of
Allahabad. According to the Hindu fes-
tival calendar, Magh is one of the
months in which bathing (snana) in
sacred rivers is highly praised. This is
particularly
significant
because
Allahabad lies at the confluence of two
sacred rivers, the Ganges and the
Yamuna River. During this month, pil-
grims set up an encampment at the con-
fluence, which becomes a bustling
religious center. During their stay, pilgrimsMahabharata
live a strict and disciplined religious life.
This includes a morning bath, followed
by gift-giving (dana) and worship;
eating a restricted diet, and evenings
spent singing hymns (kirtan) and
listening to religious discourses. Some
pilgrims even take a strict vow, known as
kalpavas, to remain there for the entire
month, a vow which also entails a strict
ascetic lifestyle. More than a million pil-
grims attend this festival. Every twelfth
year, when the Magh Mela becomes the
Allahabad Kumbha Mela, attendance
increases. In 1989 an estimated fifteen
million pilgrims came for a single day,
with millions more coming during the
rest of the month.
Magic
In Hindu tradition there are many differ-
ent powers in the universe, and many
ways of influencing them, both seen and
unseen. The emphasis on magic goes
back to the Atharva Veda, one of the
oldest Hindu religious texts, which is
mostly a collection of spells. Even today
many Hindus accept that certain pow-
erful religious adepts have the power to
command unseen forces, as well as the
power to counteract the spells levied by
others. People who have gained high
levels of religious attainments are also
believed to have superhuman powers
(siddhi), allowing them to do things
that ordinary people cannot. These
superhuman powers are not seen as
magical, but rather as the normal exer-
cise of a level of understanding higher
than most people have attained. Indian
culture also has a long tradition of illu-
sion, sleight of hand, and other sorts of
trickery, baffling and entertaining
onlookers for centuries. For an extensive
account of these powers, see Lee Siegel,
Net of Magic, 1991.
Mahabalipuram
Village on the Bay of Bengal in Tamil
Nadu, about thirty miles south of
Madras. Although famous as a beach
resort today, during the Pallava dynasty
(6th–9th c.) Mahabalipuram was a
major port, second in importance only
to the capital at Kanchipuram.
Mahabalipuram has several impressive
religious monuments, erected during
the reigns of Narasimhavarman I
(630–668 C.E.) and Narasimhavarman II
(700–728 C.E.). One of the monuments is
a rock-cut sculpture depicting the myth
of the Descent of the Ganges, using a
natural vertical fissure to lay out the
river’s path. Other notable constructions
are the “Rathas,” a series of free-standing
temples carved from one giant boulder,
dedicated to the Pandavas, the protago-
nists in the epic Mahabharata. The
most recent attraction is the temple
along the shore, built during the reign of
Rajasimhavarman (early 8th C.). The
temple’s major deity is the god Shiva; a
smaller shrine also holds an image of
the god Vishnu. Although all of these
have been weathered by time and the
elements, they remain some of the most
visited sites in southern India.
Mahabharata
One of the two great Sanskrit epics,
traditionally ascribed to the mythical
sage Vyasa. The Mahabharata is much
longer than the other great epic, the
Ramayana. At almost 100,000 stanzas,
the Mahabharata is the world’s longest
epic poem. If the Ramayana can be
characterized as the tale of the “good”
family, in which brothers cooperate to
support and preserve their family, the
Mahabharata describes the “bad”
family, in which hard-heartedness and
the lust for power in an extended royal
family ultimately cause its destruction.
The epic is set in the region west of mod-
ern Delhi and describes a fratricidal civil
war. A greatly abridged account can be
given as follows:
Shantanu is the king of the Kurus. He
dies an untimely, heirless death. In a
desperate attempt to preserve the royal
line, Shantanu’s wife, Satyavati, calls
upon her elder son, the sage Vyasa, who
fathers children by Shantanu’s two
wives. The elder son, Dhrtarashtra, is
[[399]]
Mahabharata
born blind, and thus the rights to the
throne fall to his younger brother
Pandu. Pandu later abdicates his throne
because of a curse, and goes to live in
the forest with his two wives, Kunti and
Madri, leaving his elder brother to rule
in his place. In time Dhrtarashtra’s wife,
Gandhari, magically gives birth to one
hundred sons, of whom the oldest is
Duryodhana; the hundred sons are
called the Kauravas, and are the epic’s
antagonists. In the forest Kunti has three
sons, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna,
while Madri has the twins Nakula and
Sahadeva. These five sons are the
Pandavas, the epic’s protagonists. None
of these children are actually Pandu’s
sons, since he has been cursed to die the
moment he holds his wife in amorous
embrace. Rather, they have been magi-
cally conceived using a mantra given to
Kunti by the sage Durvasas, giving the
woman reciting it the power to call
down any of the gods and have a son
equal in power to that god himself.
When Kunti first receives the mantra,
long before her marriage, she impulsively
recites it while gazing upon the sun, and
gives birth to a shining child. Distraught
and desperate, Kunti puts him in a
box and abandons him in the Ganges
River. The child is adopted by the
charioteer Adhiratha, and grows up to
be the heroic Karna.
As the result of his curse, Pandu dies
an early death, and Kunti (his wife) and
his sons (the Pandavas) return to the
court at Hastinapur, where the boys are
raised as princes. From the beginning
there are bad feelings between
Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kauravas)
and his cousins, largely because
Duryodhana desires the throne, which
rightly belongs to Yudhishthira (one of
the Pandavas). After foiling several
attempts to kill them, the Pandava
brothers leave the kingdom to become
mercenaries. On one of their journeys,
Arjuna wins the hand of the princess
Draupadi, who becomes their common
wife (their mother commands that
Arjuna share whatever he wins with his
brothers). After some time Dhrtarashtra
[[400]]

(father of the Kauravas) renounces
the throne and divides his kingdom.
The Pandavas build a new capital
at Indraprastha, identified near
modern Delhi.
For a little while things are quiet, but
Duryodhana is not content to share his
kingdom. He invites Yudhishthira for a
game of dice, matching Yudhishthira
against Shakuni, the most skillful gam-
bler alive. Although Yudhishthira is a
model for truthfulness and virtue, his
fatal flaw is his love of gambling. In the
match Yudhishthira loses his kingdom,
all his possessions, his brothers, himself,
and finally his wife. In one of the epic’s
most powerful scenes, Duryodhana’s
brother, Duhshasana, drags Draupadi
by her hair into the assembly hall, her
clothes stained with her menstrual
blood. Draupadi’s humiliation moves
Dhrtarashtra to set them free, but also
sparks the enmity that helps drive the
rest of the plot. After some bargaining,
the parties agree that the Pandavas will
spend twelve years in exile and a thir-
teenth incognito. If they can remain
undiscovered during the thirteenth year
they will regain their kingdom. If they
are discovered, however, the cycle of
exile will begin again.
After thirteen years, Yudhishthira
and his brothers approach Duryodhana
for their rightful share, but are haughtily
rebuffed. All efforts at conciliation fail;
Duryodhana claims that he will not give
them enough land in which to stick the
point of a needle. Pushed to the wall, the
Pandavas prepare for battle. On one side
are Yudhishthira and his brothers, aided
by their counselor Krishna. On the
other are Duryodhana and many
respected figures, such as Drona,
Bhishma, and Karna. For eighteen days
the battle rages, until most of the impor-
tant people are dead. Yudhishthira and
his brothers survive. Yudhishthira is
crowned king and rules righteously for
many years. Late in life he installs his
grandson, King Parikshit, on the throne.
With his siblings he takes a final journey
into the Himalayas. During the journey
his brothers fall dead, one by one;Mahabhashya
Yudhishthira eventually enters the
divine realm.
The complete epic is more complex
than this summary. One of the features
of the epic is that it contains many unre-
lated tales, for which the main story acts
as a frame. Aside from being a tale of a
dysfunctional family, the Mahabharata
also contains a great deal of cultural wis-
dom, making the names of characters
symbolic even today. A televised serial of
the text, which ran for more than a year
in 1989–90, was wildly popular through-
out India. It is also interesting to note
that many traditional Indian families
will not keep a copy of the text in the
house, since it is believed that to do this
will foster discord in the family.
Mahabhashya
(“Great commentary”) A commentary
on the Ashtadhyayi of Panini, written
by Patanjali, the grammarian, in the
second century B.C.E. Panini’s text gives a
complete and accurate description of all
the forms of the Sanskrit language and
set the standard for the language after
[[401]]
Mahabrahman
his time. Although the Ashtadhyayi is
considered a masterpiece, it appears to
invite more detailed commentary
because it is written in a series of apho-
risms or sutra. Each of these aphorisms
provides the basis for those which fol-
low. Panini’s ultimate purpose is to give
a complete account of the language in
the briefest possible space. Aside from
expanding and expounding Panini’s
grammar, Patanjali also gives some use-
ful information of his own. The
Mahabhashya contains the earliest
known reference to the Greeks.
Mahabrahman
(“Great Brahman”) In traditional Indian
society, a debased class of brahmins
who officiate at rites for the dead, espe-
cially at the rites performed immediately
after death. In many of these rites the
Mahabrahman is identified with the
deceased person and is fed and given
gifts that are intended to help satisfy the
soul of the deceased. These acts are seen
as transferring the inauspiciousness of
death from the family to the
Mahabrahman. Such constant associa-
tion with death and its inauspicious
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable
way to make a living; Mahabrahmans
have extremely low social status, despite
being brahmins by birth. As compensa-
tion for taking on such inauspicious-
ness, Mahabrahmans usually demand
high payment from a family. For further
information see Jonathan Parry,
“Ghosts,
Greed
and
Sin: The
Occupational Identity of the Benares
Funeral Priests,” in Man, Vol. 15, 1980.
Mahadeva
(“great God”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
Mahadeviyakka
(12th c.) Poet-saint and religious leader
in the Lingayat religious community,
a bhakti (devotional) community cen-
tered on both the worship of Shiva
as the single supreme god and on the
[[402]]

rejection of all caste regulations. The
Lingayats were formed in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka, where they
still have a considerable presence. The
collections of poetry that form their
most important religious texts are com-
posed in the Kannada language.
Mahadeviyakka was a contemporary of
Basavanna and Allama Prabhu; her sta-
tus in the community is marked by the
suffix akka (“elder sister”). According to
tradition, she was devoted to Shiva at a
very young age and considered him to
be her true husband. This caused great
problems during a brief, unhappy mar-
riage, a mismatch between a carnally
inclined man and a woman who would
have no human lover. She eventually left
her husband, wandering naked as a sign
that she had cast away all attachments.
She later became associated with the
Lingayats, known as the “Lord’s men.”
The theme running through most of her
poetry is love for Shiva, sometimes as
her husband and sometimes as her
adulterous lover, both portraying her
struggles with the world. For further
information see A. K. Ramanujan,
Speaking of Shiva, 1973.
Mahakaleshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
sacred city of Ujjain in the state of
Madhya Pradesh. The temple is named
for its presiding deity, the god Shiva in
his manifestation as the “Lord of Death.”
Shiva is present at Mahakaleshvar in the
form of a linga, a pillar-shaped image.
The Mahakaleshvar linga is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas, a network of sites at
which Shiva is uniquely present. The
linga is in an underground room,
reached only by traversing a long, dark
passageway. This passage may symbol-
ize the darkness and terror of death.
Worship at Mahakaleshvar is believed to
protect one from an early or untimely
death, and at death, bring liberation of
the soul (moksha).
The city of Ujjain has a long history
as a sacred, economic, and political cen-
ter. One of the Seven Sacred CitiesMahamandaleshvar
(Saptapuri), it also has other important
religious sites. Historically, Ujjain is said
to have been the capital of King
Vikramaditya, founder of the Vikram
Era. Trade routes that passed through it
made it economically prosperous.
Mahakali
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythol-
ogy of the Goddess, the three parts of
this text describe the goddess in three
different manifestations: Mahasaraswati,
Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali. All of
these manifestations are extremely
powerful, but Mahakali is the most
ferocious of all. She is said to have
sprung from the forehead of the
Goddess, as a physical manifestation
of the deity’s rage when insulted by
the demon generals Chanda and
Munda, who denigrate her fighting
ability because she was a woman.
According to the story, Mahakali is
black in color, thin, and haggard, with
long teeth and nails, and utters terrify-
ing cries. She defeats the demon
armies by picking them up and stuffing
them into her mouth, consuming them
whole. She later kills Chanda and
Munda by cutting off their heads. Her
final adversary is Raktabija, who has
received the boon that any drop of his
blood falling to the earth will instantly
turn into a copy of him, rendering him
practically
unconquerable.
Kali
defeats this demon by drinking his
blood as it is shed, until finally it is
completely gone. For more informa-
tion on Mahakali and all the goddesses
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986; and John
Stratton Hawley and Donna Wullf
(eds.), Devi, 1996.
Mahakavya
An epic poem in Sanskrit literature.
According to tradition, there are six
such mahakavyas: the Kumarasambhava,
Meghaduta, and Raghuvamsha by the
poet Kalidasa; the Shishupala-vadha
by the poet Magha; the Kiratarjuniya by the
poet Bharavi, and the Naishadacharitra by
the poet-king Harsha.
Mahalakshmi
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, the three parts of this
text describe this goddess in three differ-
ent manifestations: Mahasaraswati,
Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali. Unlike
the goddess Lakshmi, who is a sedate
and propitious married goddess,
Mahalakshmi is seen as a powerful war-
rior goddess, the premier divine power
on the earth. She is formed from the col-
lected radiance (tejas) of all the gods, in
order to kill a demon named
Mahishasura, against whom the gods
have been unable to prevail. Her climac-
tic act in the Devimahatmya is killing
Mahishasura, despite his desperate
attempts first to defeat and then to
elude her. For more information on
Mahalakshmi and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Mahamandaleshvar
(“Great Lord of the Region”) Term of
respect given to a Mandaleshvar when
one of his disciples is chosen a
Mandaleshvar while the preceptor is still
living. Mandaleshvars are the learned
ascetics who lead the Naga akharas of
the Dashanami Sanyasis, a practice that
began in the nineteenth century. The
Dashanami Nagas are renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary sol-
diers. Their rough-and-ready qualities
made them effective soldiers, but gave
them little preparation for formal
argument with Christian missionaries.
Mandaleshvars were chosen from
among the more learned Paramahamsa
ascetics, so that the latter could provide
a more coherent and telling opposition;
he also serves as the Nagas’ teacher and
spiritual adviser. The enshrinement of
[[403]]
Mahamandapa
Mahant Bhagwan Das, renowned sadhu, attends the Kumbha Mela religious festival in Allahabad.
a Mandaleshvar’s disciple is thus seen as
boosting his teacher’s prestige to an
even more rarefied state.
Mahamandapa
The mahamandapa is an architectural
feature found in the Khajuraho varia-
tion of the Nagara architectural style.
Usually found in northern India, the

Nagara style emphasizes verticality, with
the whole temple building culminating
in a single highest point; in the
Khajuraho variant, the entire structure
gradually leads up to the central tower,
as foothills lead up to the mountains,
with the peak of this central tower
directly over the temple’s primary
image. In this style, the mahamandapa
is the name for the temple’s mainMahanubhav
entrance-hall, which was separated
from the main sanctuary (garbhagrha)
by a short vestibule named the antarala.
Mahamantra
A thirty-two syllable mantra, or sacred
formula, the recitation of which is the
primary religious act for devotees
(bhakta)
belonging
to
ISKCON
(International Society for Krishna
Consciousness), a group more popularly
known as the Hare Krishnas. The mantra
itself is “Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare; Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.”
Mahamaya
(“[she whose] power of illusion is great”)
Epithet of the Goddess in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important textual source for the notion
that God is female. This epithet reflects
her position as the sole and supreme
power in the universe, wielding the
power of illusion that obscures this fact
from human awareness. See Goddess.
Mahanirvani Akhara
The name of a group of the Naga class of
the Dashanami Sanyasis, a type of
renunciant ascetic. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akharas
or regiments on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers or traders;
both of these have largely disappeared
in contemporary times. This akhara is
described as taking part in a battle with
the forces of the Moghul emperor
Aurangzeb in 1664, and are credited
with saving the city of Benares from
being sacked.
The Mahanirvani Akhara is one of
the seven main Dashanami Naga akha-
ras and remains one of most influential.
The principal center of the Mahanirvani
Akhara is in Allahabad, site of the largest
and most important bathing (snana)
festivals, known as the Kumbha Mela.
Their strength in Allahabad has allowed
them to assume the most desirable spot
at the head of the bathing procession
during the Kumbha Mela. Each of the
akharas has a (guardian) deity who
defines their organizational identity; the
tutelary deity of the Mahanirvani Akhara
is the great sage Kapila.
Mahant
(“great”) Honorific title given to an
ascetic who is the leader of a monastery.
Mahants are chosen by their predeces-
sors and designate their successors.
While they are living, they have virtually
total control over the monastery and
its assets, even though they do not
own them. In any given ascetic
establishment, the mahant has very
high status, since he is the absolute ruler
of his small domain.
Mahanubhav
(“Great Experience”) A regional religious
community, whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and
who are found mainly in the central
regions of the state of Maharashtra. The
Mahanubhavs were founded by
Chakradhar in the thirteenth century.
Under his influence the community has
rejected many aspects of “mainstream”
Hindu religious life: social distinctions
based on caste, the worship of images,
and the religious authority of brahmins.
The community is also noted for
espousing an ascetic way of life.
Although the Mahanubhavs are consid-
ered Vaishnavas, they acknowledge only
one God, whom they call Parameshvar
(“Great Lord”), and whom they conceive
as having had five incarnations. Two of
these incarnations are established fig-
ures in the Hindu pantheon, the god
Krishna and the deified ascetic
Dattatreya. The other three are sectari-
an figures: their founder Chakradhar,
Chakradhar’s guru, and his guru’s guru.
Their modern practice stresses pilgrim-
age, vows, and almsgiving. Nevertheless,
through much of Maharashtra there is a
[[405]]

legacy of suspicion and mistrust of the
Mahanubhavs, perhaps rooted in their
anti-authoritarian history. For further
information see Anne Feldhaus, The
Religious System of the Mahanubhav
Sect, 1983.
Mahapataka
(“Great Sinner”) In the dharma litera-
ture, a person who has committed one
of the Four Great Crimes, namely mur-
dering a brahmin (brahmahatya), steal-
ing a brahmin’s gold (steya), drinking
liquor (surapana), or committing adul-
tery with the wife of one’s guru (guru-
talpaga). These crimes were considered
so heinous that the performer became
an outcast from society. Another indica-
tion of the gravity of these acts was that
their expiations (prayashchitta) were so
severe that they normally ended in
death; in some cases this outcome was
specifically prescribed. Aside from pre-
scribing such punishments for the actual
offenders, the dharma literature also
prescribed similar outcaste status for
anyone who knowingly associated with
such people for more than one year.
[[406]]

Mahapatra
(“great vessel”) In parts of northern
India, the name of a debased brahmin
group whose members gain their liveli-
hood primarily through receiving gifts,
particularly those given following a
death. Such brahmins do not actually
perform the rites for the dead, although
they are seen as symbolically represent-
ing the dead person. Their low status
stems from this connection with the
dead; the gifts they accept transfer the
inauspiciousness of death from the
family to the Mahapatra. This latter
assumption is reflected in the group’s
name—they are “vessels” into which
one can deposit such inauspiciousness,
and thus be rid of it. Such constant asso-
ciation with death and its inauspicious
qualities is seen as a highly undesirable
way to make a living, giving this group
extremely low social status, despite
being brahmins by birth. Despite their
debased status, they are a necessary part
of traditional society, in that they serve
as the means through which such inaus-
piciousness can be removed.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
Mahar
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. The Mahars
were
an
untouchable
jati
in
Maharashtrian society, performing vari-
ous services and labor for the landlord
communities. The Mahars are famous
for two figures: the medieval bhakti
poet Chokamela, and the modern jurist
and social reformer Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.
Maharashtra
Modern Indian state along the Arabian
Sea, stretching east over the Western
Ghats to encompass the northern part
of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is
one of the “linguistic” states formed
after Indian independence in 1947;
these states were created to unite people
with a common language and culture (in
this case, Marathi) under one state gov-
ernment. It was formed in 1960 by split-
ting the former state of Bombay into the
present states of Gujarat and
Maharashtra. Bombay, the capital, is the
financial and industrial center of mod-
ern India. The western regions are heav-
ily industrialized; the eastern regions are
more agricultural, dominated by sugar
plantations. Historically, Maharashtra is
the homeland of the Marathas, a group
whose eighteenth-century empire
stretched across much of northern
India. The Rashtriya Svayamsevak
Sangh and the Shiv Sena, two Hindu
nationalist organizations that have both
tried to influence Indian politics, were
founded in Maharashtra. Along with its
economic and political importance, the
state contains many important histori-
cal, cultural, and religious sites.
Historical and cultural sites include the
rock-cut caves of Ellora, a UNESCO World
Heritage Site; the Buddhist caves at
Ajanta; and the cave temple at
Elephanta in the Bombay harbor. Places
of religious importance include the
Godavari and Bhima rivers and their
attendant sacred sites (tirthas); the sites
associated with the saints of the Varkari
Panth religious community, particularly
the temple to the god Vithoba at
Pandharpur; and three of the jyotirlin-
gas, which are sites particularly holy to
the god Shiva: Bhimashankar,
Ghrneshvar, and Tryambakeshvar. For
general information about Maharashtra
and other regions of India, see Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Maharashtri
Southern Indian brahmins who make
up one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are Gujarati, Karnata,
Andhra, and Dravida. As their name
would indicate, the core region for
Maharashtri brahmins is the modern
state of Maharashtra. The Maharashtri
brahmins are themselves divided
into two subgroups: the Chitpavan, or
Konkanastha brahmins, who live in
the
coastal
regions,
and
the
Deshastha brahmins, who live further
inland in the Deccan.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
(b. Mahesh Prasad Verma, 1911) Hindu
teacher and founder of the religious
technique known as Transcendental
Meditation (TM). The Maharishi (“Great
Sage”) was trained as an engineer, but
eventually renounced the world after
meeting one of the Shankaracharyas, a
name given to the most important mod-
ern Hindu religious leaders. He stayed
with Shankaracharya for the next twelve
years, in pursuit of spiritual knowledge.
He established an ashram at Rishikesh
but was relatively unknown until his
association with the Beatles, the British
musical group who came to India with
him on pilgrimage. In the early 1970s, TM
instructors
traveled
throughout
American college campuses, touting the
[[407]]
Mahasaraswati
physiological and spiritual benefits of
meditation and providing people (for a
fee) with a mantra or sacred sound that
would bring them these benefits.
According to TM proponents, meditation
is also supposed to have pacific effects
on the larger environment, and result in
reduced crime, tension, and hatred.
During
this
period
Maharishi
International University was established
at the former Parsons College in
Fairfield, Iowa, as a center to teach TM. In
the late 1970s, Maharishi University
instituted a program training people to
develop the six classical superhuman
powers (siddhis). Since then several dis-
appointed patrons have won lawsuits
against the organization.
Mahasaraswati
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, the text describes this
goddess in three different manifesta-
tions: Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi,
and Mahakali. The opening story begins
at the creation of the cosmos. As the god
Brahma emerges from the lotus sprout-
ing from the god Vishnu’s navel, he is
beset by two demons named Madhu
and Kaitabha, who try to kill him.
Brahma tries to elude the demons, but
because Vishnu is fast asleep, overcome
by the power of the Goddess, he cannot
give Brahma any help. It is only when
Brahma praises the Goddess that she
leaves Vishnu, letting him awake. She
then clouds the demons’ minds so that
they can be tricked (and killed) by
Vishnu. In the pantheon, Saraswati is
the goddess associated with art, learn-
ing, and culture—anything involving the
life and activity of the intellectual and
aesthetic faculties. Mahasaraswati is
also connected with intellect, emphasiz-
ing her ability to control people’s per-
ceptions. For more information on
Mahasaraswati and the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.

Mahat
(“great one”) In the account of evolution
found in the Samkhya philosophical
school, mahat is the first evolutionary
stage. It consists of the initial distur-
bance of prakrti (primal matter)
transforming from its original state
of equilibrium. Mahat is called the
“great one” because prakrti remains
unchanged. Mahat is also known
as buddhi, the mental faculty for
awareness, apperception, and decision
making that is believed to be at the root
of mental processes. The mental
processes facilitated by buddhi spur the
development of the next stage in the
evolution, ahamkar or subjective con-
sciousness, after which the division of
the world into subjective and objective
spheres proceeds.
Mahavakya
(“great utterance”) Short statements
from the speculative texts known as the
Upanishads, called “great” because they
reveal the true nature of reality and of
the Self. One of the most famous
mahavakya is tat tvam asi (“that thou
art”), expressing the unity of the Self
with Brahman. Other well known utter-
ances are ayamatma Brahman (“This
Self is Brahman”), sarvam idam khalu
Brahman (“Truly, this universe is
Brahman”), aham brahmasmi (“I am
Brahman”), and prajnanam Brahman
(“Knowledge is Brahman”). These great
utterances are most important in the
leap philosophy propounded by the
philosopher Sureshvara. Leap philoso-
phers believe that complete freedom is
possible, but out of our immediate con-
trol, in that it cannot be gained by a pre-
cisely specified sequence of causes and
effects. According to Sureshvara’s under-
standing, when a person whose under-
standing has been purified hears one of
these mahavakyas, the profound truth
in the utterance brings the flash of
insight that brings final liberation of the
soul (moksha).Mahipati
Mahavidyas
A collective name for ten fierce and
powerful manifestations of the Goddess.
According to tradition, the goddess Sati
assumes these forms one after another,
in an attempt to persuade her husband,
the god Shiva, to allow her to attend a
sacrifice given by her father Daksha.
These ten forms are all frightful and
fearsome, even to Shiva, showing the
ultimate superiority of the Goddess over
Shiva. These ten forms are Kali, Tara,
Chinnamasta, Bhuvaneshvari, Bagala,
Dhumavati, Kamala, Matangi, Shodashi,
and Bhairavi. Some of these forms, par-
ticularly Kali, have become important
deities in their own right. For further
information see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Mahayuga
A unit of cosmic time. According to tra-
ditional Hindu reckoning, time has nei-
ther beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with the active phase known as
the Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
as the Night of Brahma. In one reckon-
ing of cosmic time, the Day of Brahma is
divided into one thousand mahayugas
(“great cosmic ages”), each of which
lasts for 4.32 million years. Each
mahayuga is composed of four eras,
named the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each is
shorter and more evil than its predeces-
sor; by the end of the Kali Yuga, things
have gotten so bad that the only solu-
tion is the destruction and recreation of
the earth, at which time the next Krta
Yuga begins.
Mahendravarman
(r. 600–630) Ruler in southern India dur-
ing the Pallava dynasty, when it was a
stronghold of Tamil culture. According
to tradition, Mahendravarman was born
a Jain, but became a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva under the influence of the
poet-saint Appar. Mahendravarman
was a cultured man and a patron
of the arts, as well as the author of
the play Mattvavilasa (“Sport of
Drunkards”), which was popular
throughout southern India. The rock-
cut temples at Mahabalipuram were
built during his reign. He fought
with the surrounding monarchs, espe-
cially the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II;
it was in battle with Pulakeshin’s forces
that Mahendravarman met his death.

Mahipati
(1715–1790) Writer and hagiographer of
the devotional (bhakti) poet-saints, par-
ticularly those saints connected with the
Varkari Panth, to which Mahipati him-
self belonged. The Varkari Panth is a reli-
gious community centered around the
worship of the Hindu god Vithoba,
whose temple at Pandharpur is in
the modern state of Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Mahipati was a
civil servant in his home town. One day
he was summoned to his job without
being able to finish his daily worship.
Mahipati did the business at hand, but
then resigned his position, vowing never
to use his pen except in the service of
the saints. Mahipati freely admitted that
much of his material on the saints was
drawn from earlier works, particularly
the Bhaktamal written by the poet-
saint Nabhadas. As with Nabhadas, he
presents each of his subjects as a para-
digm of devotion; the stories reinforce
and validate the power of devotion to
overcome all obstacles. His major
works are the Bhaktavijaya and the
Bhaktililamrta; the former has been
translated by Justin E. Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole as Stories of Indian
[[409]]
Mahishasura
Saints, 1982; parts of the latter by Justin
E. Abbott as The Life of Eknath, 1981,
and The Life of Tukaram, 1980.
Mahishasura
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important source for the mythology
of the Goddess, Mahishasura is the
buffalo-demon who is responsible for
the birth of the Goddess. Mahishasura
receives the boon that he cannot be
killed by any male and is able to van-
quish the gods. They are driven from
their heavenly realm and take shelter in
the mountains. While they are there, the
assembly of the gods let forth their col-
lected radiance (tejas), coalescing into
the figure of the Goddess, who repre-
sents all their collected power. The
Goddess rides off on a lion to challenge
Mahishasura. He falls in love with her,
but when he proposes marriage, she
declares she will only marry the man
who can defeat her in battle. A fierce
battle ensues; Mahishasura is defeated.
He tries to elude the Goddess by chang-
ing his form several times, but she keeps
striking each one with her sword, finally
killing him by cutting off his head.
Mahishi
In Hindu mythology, the name of a
buffalo-demoness killed by the god
Aiyappa. Mahishi receives the boon that
she can only be killed by a person not
born from the union of male and female.
To circumvent this boon, Aiyappa is
born of a union of the gods Shiva and
Vishnu, when the latter takes the form
of the enchantress Mohini. When
Mahishi is killed, the female figure of
Lila rises from her body. Lila wants to
marry Aiyappa; he agrees that he will
marry her in the year a celibate pilgrim
does not come to visit him at Shabari
Malai. Since women of childbearing age
are forbidden to visit Shabari Malai, and
those men who come are required to be
celibate, Lila is still waiting for this vow
to be fulfilled.

Mahishmati
Ancient city on the Narmada River in
central India. During the fifth century
B.C.E., Mahishmati was the outer bound-
ary for the expansion of the Aryan.
Mahmud of Ghazni
(998–1030) Turkish ruler whose capital
was at Ghazni (now in modern
Afghanistan). Between 1001 and 1027,
Mahmud made seventeen raids into
India, lured by the tales of India’s fabu-
lous wealth. His plundering was aided
by the fragmented political life in north-
ern India, which prevented Hindus from
forming any effective opposition.
Mahmud struck at many of the centers
in northern India, particularly pilgrim-
age centers, which were renowned for
their wealth: Multan, Mathura,
Thanesar, Kanauj (which never recov-
ered after being sacked in 1018), and
finally Somnath, from which he report-
edly took tremendous booty. Although
these raids often entailed iconoclasm
(the destruction of religious imagery),
as at the Shiva temple in Somnath,
Mahmud’s fundamental motives were
economic—replenishing his coffers
with as much plunder as possible,
and returning to Ghazni before the
advent of the hot season. As such he is
different from some of the later Muslim
kings, such the Moghuls, who actually
exercised political sway over much of
India. Aside from his pillaging raids,
Mahmud is associated with the scholar
Alberuni.
Alberuni
accompanied
Mahmud on one of these expeditions,
later using his observations to write an
account of Hindu life and culture. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Maithila
Northern Indian brahmins who make
up Pancha Gauda, one of the five north-
ern brahmin communities; the other
four communities are Kanaujia, Gauda,
Utkala, and Saraswat. Maithila brah-
mins are a small community, found only
in the Mithila region in the northernMala
part of modern Bihar. Despite the
community’s size, Maithila brahmins
are well known for their commitment
to learning and culture, as exemplified
by their most famous member, the
poet Vidyapati.unknown. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti
and Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1972; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the
Three Cities, 1990.
MaithunaMakarasana
(“copulation”) In the secret ritually-
based religious practice known as
tantra, sexual intercourse is the fifth
and last of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara); the panchamakara
are used in their actual forms in “left
hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
whereas they are represented by sym-
bolic substitutes in “right hand” (dak-
shinachara) tantric ritual. Many
traditions in Hindu tantra describe ritu-
alized sexual intercourse as a symbol of
the ultimate union of the god Shiva and
his wife Shakti. Ritual sexuality must be
seen in the larger tantric context. One of
the most pervasive tantric assumptions
is the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle means that the adept must
reject all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality; in this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding con-
sumption of intoxicants, nonvegetari-
an food, and illicit sexuality in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a
more exclusive qualification (adhikara),
and is thus superior to common prac-
tice. In some forms of this ritual the
woman is the initiate’s wife, who is
worshiped before intercourse as a
manifestation of the Goddess. In other
cases this ritual intercourse is por-
trayed as adulterous, usually with a
woman of very low status, to magnify
the social boundaries being trans-
gressed. This latter practice is uncom-
mon now, at least in southern India,
where Brooks describes it as virtually(“crocodile seat”) In Indian iconogra-
phy, a base on which an image may
be placed. The base is a figure of a
crocodile, with a flat part on its back for
the image.
Makara Sankranti
Religious festival that falls on the day the
sun makes the transition (sankranti)
into the zodiacal sign of Capricorn
(makara). According to Western astrol-
ogy, this occurs around December 20,
but in Indian astrology (jyotisha), this
occurs on January 14. This is one of the
few celebrations in the festival year
marked by the solar rather than the
lunar calendar. On Makara Sankranti,
the sun is reckoned as beginning its
“northward journey” (uttarayana). This
will continue until Karka Sankranti six
months later, when the sun enters
Cancer, and begins its “southward jour-
ney” (dakshinayana). Since the uttarayana
is believed to be more auspicious than
its counterpart, the day marking this
transition is deemed particularly aus-
picious. Makara Sankranti is primarily
a bathing (snana) festival; great num-
bers of people come to bathe in rivers
on that day, especially the Ganges. The
largest bathing festival on the Ganges
is at Sagar Island in state of West
Bengal (also known as Ganga Sagar),
celebrated as the place where the
Ganges empties into the sea at the Bay
of Bengal.
Mala
(“garland”) This word denotes any sort
of necklace. Garlands made of flowers
are ubiquitous throughout India, both
as offerings to a deity—around whose
neck they are placed as adornment—or
[[411]]
Malabar
Ascetic wearing a mala of sacred wooden beads.
given in the same way to any honored
guest as a sign of welcome and respect.
Garlands or necklaces made from more
permanent materials are important
pieces of religious paraphernalia, and in
some cases carry clear sectarian associ-
ations. Many Shaivas wear malas made
from rudraksha beads, an aniconic
form of their patron deity, Shiva. In the
same way, many Vaishnavas will wear a
mala made from the wood of the Tulsi
plant, since this plant is said to be a form
of the goddess Lakshmi, the spouse of
their patron deity Vishnu. Although
these materials serve as sectarian mark-
ers, malas used for ritual purposes can
be made from virtually any material.
Most favored are substances such as
amber, rock crystal, coral, semiprecious
stones, and gemstones—materials
which are durable, valuable, and not
formed by human hands.
For ritual purposes, malas are used
to keep count during mantra recitation
(japa), by moving one bead through the
[[412]]

finger and thumb with each recitation.
Such malas are usually strung with 108
pieces. Each mala has one bead set apart
from the others; mantra recitation
always begins with this bead. This bead
symbolizes Mount Meru, the mythical
mountain that is the cosmic pivot support-
ing the entire created order. According to
established practice, when one has
reached the end of the mala and has
come back to the Meru bead, one should
reverse directions. By virtue of never
passing over the Meru bead, one is thus
symbolically circling Mount Meru as the
center of the universe.
This connection with daily religious
practice makes malas powerful religious
objects, believed to be charged by their
owners’ spiritual energy. For this reason,
malas are almost never exchanged—
except for a mala given by a guru to a
disciple. Most malas are touched only by
the owner. People doing recitation will
often keep the hand and mala concealed
in a cloth bag (known as a gomukh or
“cow’s mouth”), as a barrier to poten-
tially corrupting outside forces. The
conviction that a mala absorbs its
owner’s spiritual energy also lies behind
the taboo on repairing and reusing a
broken mala. According to popular
belief, a mala breaks because it gradual-
ly draws off its owner’s negative spiritual
forces. Once broken, a mala should
therefore be discarded, to prevent the
owner from coming back into contact
with this potentially damaging energy.
Malabar
Traditional name for the southern
Indian coastal region bordering the
Arabian sea, in the modern states of
Kerala and Karnataka.
Malamasa
(“Impure month”) An intercalary
month inserted into the lunar calendar
about every 21⁄2 years, to correct the
discrepancy between the lunar and
the solar calendars. Although this
month is necessary to maintain theMallikarjuna
correspondence between the two calen-
dars—and thus, for example, to keep
the spring festivals in the spring—it is
considered an unusual event, impure
and ritually dangerous.
Malatimadhava
Play written by the Sanskrit dramatist
Bhavabhuti (early 8th c.), who was par-
ticularly noted for his ability to express
and transmit the play of emotions
through language. The play’s general
plot is the triumphant love between
Malati and her beloved Madhava (an
epithet of the god Krishna), despite
numerous obstacles along the way. The
drama is noted as an exquisite poetic
work, but also because the primary
villain is an evil ascetic, generally
believed to be a member of the extinct
ascetic sect known as Kapalikas. The
Kapalikas were devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva, emulating him in his wrathful
form as Bhairava: wearing the hair long
and matted, smearing the body with
ash (preferably from the cremation
ground), and bearing a club and a
skull-bowl (kapala). The Kapilikas are
cited as indulging in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs,
performing human sacrifice, and
orgiastic sexuality—which made them
feared. Bhavabhuti’s description is
one of the earliest references to
Shaiva asceticism, and thus historically
significant. The play has been translated
into English by Michael Coulson and
published in an anthology titled Three
Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Mali
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
The jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Malis’
hereditary occupation was tending gar-
dens, growing flowers, and making
flower garlands (mala).
Mallikarjuna
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on the
holy mountain Shrishaila in Andhra
Pradesh. The temple is named for its
presiding deity, the god Shiva in his
manifestation as the “[Lord] White as
Jasmine.” Shiva is present at Mallikarjuna
in the form of a linga, a pillar-shaped
image. The Mallikarjuna linga is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, a network of
sites at which Shiva is uniquely present.
Mallikarjuna’s charter myth is based on
a competition between Shiva’s two
sons, Ganesh and Skanda, who agree
that the first one to circle the earth will
be the first one to be married. Skanda
mounts his peacock and takes off, sure
that he is faster. Ganesh, however, sim-
ply walks around Shiva and his wife
Parvati, as a symbol that they are the
entire universe. When Skanda returns,
he is very angry to discover that he has
been beaten. He leaves Kailas, the
Himalayan mountain believed to be
Shiva’s abode, and goes to southern
India. Parvati is very upset at the
absence of her son, but none of the
envoys they send can persuade Skanda
to return. Finally, Shiva and Parvati go
themselves, landing on Shrishaila
mountain. Skanda has already departed
for a nearby mountain. Before following
after him, his parents consecrate the
first site as Mallikarjuna.
As with all the jyotirlingas, Mallikarjuna
is deemed a very powerful site. Worship-
ing this jyotirlinga is said to bring the
increase of wealth, freedom from dis-
ease, well-being, and any other desired
end. The site itself is a difficult place to
reach, deep in the jungle on the top of
Shrishaila mountain. For this reason,
the major festival celebrated here is
Shivaratri, the most important festival
to Shiva during the entire year, when
devotees (bhakta) come and stay for
several days.

Mallinatha
Mallinatha
(14th c.?) Sanskrit scholar and com-
mentator noted for his commentaries
on the plays written by the poet
Kalidasa (5th c.?); these commentaries
have become sources for interpreting
the texts. Although the subject of his
commentary was largely “secular” poetry,
Mallinatha himself was a Jain, and may
have been a monk. His work illustrates
the important role that the Jains played
in the preservation of Indian literary
culture. In addition to their commen-
taries, they copied and recopied the
manuscripts, a never-ending task due to
the fragile nature of the palm leaves on
which they were written.
Malviya, Madan Mohan
(1861–1946) Hindu activist and founder
of Benares Hindu University. Malviya
belonged to the first generation of
Hindus seeking to reclaim India from
British rule; these men were well
educated, politically active, and pas-
sionately committed to traditional
Hindu culture. Benares Hindu University
was founded in 1916 to uphold Hindu
cultural and philosophical traditions, as
well as to educate students in the sci-
ences, preparing them for the modern
world. Aside from his work in education,
Malviya organized and supported
Hindu religious causes, in particular a
ban on cow slaughter and opposition to
a proposed dam on the Ganges River at
the pilgrimage city of Haridwar. The
dam would have restricted the free flow
of the Ganges, so in 1914 and 1916, he
spent considerable energy organizing
opposition so that a compromise with
the government could be found. For a
glowing account of his life, see M. A.
Parmanand, Mahamana Madan Mohan
Malviya, 1985.
Malwa
Traditional name for the plateau in
Madhya Pradesh centered around the
city of Ujjain, the region’s traditional
capital. During the seventeenth and
[[414]]

eighteenth centuries, the Malwa region
was one of the centers for the
Rajasthani school of miniature paint-
ing. The Rajasthani style is generally
characterized by a flat perspective.
Visual power is derived from bands of
vivid colors that often serve as a back-
drop to the painting.
Mamsa
(“meat”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, meat is
the third of the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara); the panchamakara
are used in their actual forms in “left
hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
whereas they are represented by sym-
bolic substitutes in “right hand” (dak-
shinachara) tantric ritual. “Respectable”
Hindu society strongly condemns the
consumption of nonvegetarian food; its
ritual use therefore must be seen in the
larger tantric context. One of the most
pervasive tantric assumptions is the
ultimate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm that
the entire universe is one principle
means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality; in this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts
cite such ritual use of forbidden things
as proof that their practice involves a
more exclusive qualification (adhikara),
and is thus superior to common prac-
tice. For further information see Arthur
Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe) Shakti and
Shakta, 1978; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and
Douglas R. Brooks, The Secret of the
Three Cities, 1990.
Manas
(“mind”) In the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schoolsManasarovar
Pilgrims circling Mt. Kailas traditionally begin the journey with a bath at Manasarovar.
of Hindu philosophy, manas is one of
the stages in the devolution of prakrti
(primal matter), resulting in the world
that we see around us, in which human
souls are subject to reincarnation (sam-
sara). Manas evolves from the step
known as ahamkar—the stage marked
by the first sense of Self and subjectivity.
The mind (manas) develops as the
source of intellectual activity which, col-
ored by this feeling of subjectivity, cre-
ates the notion of an individual identity.
According to the Samkhyas, concurrent
with this mental identity comes the
development of the individual’s sense
organs (jnanendriyas) and the organs of
action (karmendriyas), as well as the
subtle elements (tanmatras) that are the
source for the world’s material objects.
Although later philosophical schools
largely rejected Samkhya cosmology,
manas became generally accepted as
one of the five human sense organs. As
the eye perceives sight and the ears per-
ceive sound, the manas perceives men-
tal objects (ideas), allowing the subject
to experience them.
Manasa
Manasa is a regional goddess consid-
ered to be a form of the Goddess. She is
worshiped mainly in eastern India, and
is primarily associated with snakes and
snakebites. As with Shitala, the goddess,
whose divine presence was considered
to be revealed by infection with small-
pox, Manasa’s divine presence comes
violently with snakebites, considered
a form of divine possession. This con-
ception shows the ambivalent nature
of many regional goddesses who are
both powerful and dangerous. When
Manasa appears, it is always traumatic,
and sometimes tragic; such is the nature
of human interactions with divinity.
Manasa is worshiped both to keep
people free from snakebites—a very
real concern in an agricultural country
with highly venomous snakes—or for
the recovery of a person who has been
bitten. Her worship is marked by
annual festivals at which people sing
songs in her honor, and which are
often marked by divine possession and
snake-handling.
Manasarovar
Lake and sacred site (tirtha) close to the
base of Mount Kailas in Tibet. Pilgrims
walking around Mt. Kailas traditionally
begin their circuit with a bath in the lake
before proceeding to the mountain. The
lake is traditionally thought to be one of
the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
[[415]]
Manava Dharma Shastra
Mandalas can be depicted as complex concentric designs.
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess, Sati,
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Manasarovar was the
palm of Sati’s right hand. See also pitha.
Manava Dharma Shastra
Another name for the text on religious
duty (dharma) and social order
ascribed to the mythical sage Manu. See
Manu Smrti.
Mandakini River
Himalayan tributary of the Ganges
River, which joins with the Alakananda
River at the hill town of Rudraprayag
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. As with
all the Himalayan tributaries of the
Ganges, the Mandakini is considered
sacred. Important pilgrimage places
(tirtha) along it include Kedarnath,
which is at its headwaters, Guptakashi,
and Rudraprayag.
[[416]]

Mandala
(“circle”) As with many Sanskrit terms, a
word with different meanings in differ-
ent contexts. In the context of geogra-
phy it can imply a region, as in the case
of the Braj region, known as the Braj
Mandala. In the context of the ras lila,
the circle dance between the god
Krishna and his devotees (bhakta),
mandala refers to the group of devotees
as well as to the shape of the dance itself.
By extension, mandala can refer to any
group of people, although it carries the
connotation of people who have gath-
ered for some serious religious purpose.
In the context of the secret ritually-
based religious practice known as
tantra, mandala refers to a symbolic
diagram used as an aid to meditation, as
a ritual accessory, or as a symbolic road
map of the spiritual quest. In this con-
text, mandala is more characteristic of
Buddhist tantra, with Hindu tantrikas
more frequently using the terms yantra
and chakra.Mandapa
Mandaleshvar
(“Lord of the Region”) Term of respect
for the ascetics chosen to head the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis in
their disputations with Christian mis-
sionaries. The Dashanami Nagas are
groups of renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva and who for-
merly made their living as traders and
mercenary soldiers. Their rough-and-
ready qualities made them effective sol-
diers but gave them little preparation for
formal argument. The Mandaleshvars
were chosen by the Nagas from among
the more learned Paramahamsa
ascetics, providing a more coherent and
telling opposition to Christian mission-
aries. An ascetic who becomes a
Mandaleshvar becomes the spiritual
adviser and the teacher of the
Dashanami Naga members of the
akhara, who deem him a spiritual
preceptor as much as their own gurus.
Mandana Mishra
(early 9th c.) Founder of the Bhamati
school of Advaita Vedanta, who is tradi-
tionally held to be a contemporary of
Shankaracharya, the Advaita school’s
greatest figure. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical theory known
as monism—the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,
which are merely differing forms of that
reality. Advaita proponents claim that
reality is non-dual (advaita)—all things
are nothing but the formless, unquali-
fied Brahman (the highest reality in the
universe), despite the appearance of dif-
ference and diversity. For the Advaitins,
the assumption of diversity is a funda-
mental misunderstanding of the ulti-
mate nature of things, a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding
that ultimately causes human beings to
be trapped in karmic bondage, reincar-
nation (samsara), and suffering.
Mandana suggests the vivarta (“illu-
sory manifestation”) causal relationship
to show how the unchanging Brahman
is connected with the world as it is per-
ceived. The concept of superimposition
(adhyasa) shows how humans project a
mistaken understanding onto the cor-
rect understanding. For example, a
piece of rope is mistaken for a snake.
Although this judgment is erroneous,
one is actually perceiving something
real, in this case the rope, but “superim-
posing” a different and mistaken identity
on it, thus “transforming” it into some-
thing it is not. In the same way, it is
argued, human consciousness begins
with the existent reality (Brahman),
which is actually there, but superimposes
onto it something which is not (the
judgment of a diverse world).
Mandana also differed from
Shankaracharya on several points, pos-
ing problems for his later followers. One
of these judgments was that the locus of
ignorance was in the Self, since it was
absurd to conceive of Brahman as sub-
ject to ignorance; another was that there
were multiple Selves, since the libera-
tion of one person did not cause the lib-
eration of all. Mandana’s comments
presuppose the existence of a common
(if illusory) world, upon which he felt
called to render a judgment; he ended
up describing it as anirvachaniya—“that
which cannot be described.” In his
analysis, Mandana also distinguished
between two kinds of ignorance—a pri-
mal “covering” that keeps one from per-
ceiving the truth, and a “projective”
ignorance through which human beings
actively obscure things.
Mandapa
(“pavilion”) The mandapa is an architec-
tural feature found in the Khajuraho
variation of the Nagara architectural
style. Usually found in northern India,
the Nagara style emphasizes verticality,
with the whole temple building culmi-
nating in a single highest point. In the
Khajuraho style, the entire structure
gradually leads up to the central tower,
as foothills lead up to the mountains,
with the peak of this central tower
directly over the temple’s primary

image. In this style, the mandapa is the
name for a hall of the temple that is usually
between the entrance hall (ardhaman-
dapa) and the main hall (mahamandapa).
Mandara
In Hindu mythology, the name of a
sacred mountain where the minor
god Kubera and his court reside. In the
myth of the Tortoise avatar, Mount
Mandara is identified as the churning-
stick used to churn the ocean of milk
(the mountain’s tremendous size makes
it an effective churn).
Mandir
(“home”) In northern India, the most
common name for a temple in which
the image of a deity has been installed
and consecrated for worship. Although
such temples often have facilities for
congregational worship, social life, or
cultural events, the building’s primary
function is to serve as the home for the
deities assembled there and considered
the temple’s real owners.
[[418]]

Mandodari
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Mandodari is the
wife of the demon-king Ravana, and the
mother of Indrajit, Atikaya and
Akshakumara. Despite being a loving
and loyal wife to Ravana, Mandodari
continually advises him that he has
done wrong in kidnapping Rama’s wife
Sita. She pleads with him to come to
terms with Rama before it becomes
necessary to fight. Ravana refuses to
do so, because of his pride and his deter-
mination to avenge the insult to his
sister Shurpanakha, who has been
mutilated by Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
In the end, this stubbornness costs
Ravana his life.
Mandu
Hilltop fort in southwestern Madhya
Pradesh, about seventy miles south of
Indore. Although Mandu is deserted
today, it was the capital of a small king-
dom until the sixteenth century, and
was eventually assimilated into the
Moghul empire as a vassal state. DuringManikarnika
the early seventeenth century Mandu
was one of the important centers for the
Rajasthani style of miniature painting.
The Rajasthani style is generally charac-
terized by a flat perspective. Visual
power is derived from bands of vivid col-
ors that serve as a backdrop to the paint-
ing. See also Moghul dynasty.
Mandukya Upanishad
One of the speculative religious texts
known as the Upanishads, which form
the latest stratum of the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu sacred texts. The Mandukya
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to
investigate ultimate questions, in partic-
ular the nature of the Self (atman). The
Mandukya Upanishad is generally con-
sidered one of the latest upanishads,
based on its brevity—a mere twelve
verses—and on its concise articulation
of philosophical monism. The first verse
praises the sound Om, calling it the
essence of the entire universe. The sec-
ond verse identifies the world with
Brahman, the Self (atman) with
Brahman, and characterizes the Self as
having four quarters. The succeeding
verses describe the four quarters of the
Self, each of which removes another
layer of egoism: The first layer is
described as waking consciousness,
characterized by perceptions of subject
and object; the next is dream sleep,
which is sheer subjectivity; then deep
sleep, which has neither subject nor
object; and finally a mysterious state
simply called “the fourth” (turiya),
which is the Self itself.
Further verses identify these first
three states as corresponding to the
three parts of the sound Om: the vowels
“a” and “u” (which combine to form the
vowel “o”), and the letter “m.” The fourth
state is said to be “beyond all letters”
and without duality. The upanishad
explicitly states that to know this brings
one final liberation, in which one spon-
taneously merges with the Self.
Mangalam
(“auspicious”) Term whose root mean-
ing can be applied to anything believed
to bring good fortune: a benedictory for-
mula, a favorable omen or portent, an
auspicious ceremony such as marriage.
It may apply to an object, such as the
mangal sutra, a necklace worn by mar-
ried women primarily in southern India
as a sign that they are married and that
their husbands are still living.
Mangal Sutra
(“auspicious thread”) Symbol worn by
married women primarily in southern
India indicating their married status.
Married women are considered to be
inherently auspicious, since their
potential generative power can be
expressed through socially sanctioned
procreation. Accounts from several cen-
turies ago describe this symbol as a sim-
ple thread, often colored yellow with
turmeric; in contemporary times the
mangal sutra is often an elaborate neck-
lace. Wearing a mangal sutra indicates
that a woman has a living husband, thus
she is a vessel of auspicious qualities.
For these reasons, a woman must
remove her mangal sutra upon being
widowed, as she must remove all the
other symbols of marriage.
Manikarnika
(“Jeweled earring”) Sacred site (tirtha)
in the city of Benares on the Ganges
River in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The site takes its name from the
Manikarnika Kund, a bathing (snana)
tank supposedly dug by the god Vishnu,
and into which fell an earring of the god
Shiva, thus sanctifying the tank by its
presence. In modern times the site is
better known for the cremation ground
at Manikarnika Ghat. In most Indian
cities the cremation ground lies at the
margin of the settlement, since its asso-
ciation with death makes it an inauspi-
cious place. However, the Manikarnika
cremation ground is in the center of
Benares. Despite the normal human
[[419]]
Manikkavachakar
desire to ignore and to deny the reality
of death, in Benares it is paraded in
full view—not to distress or depress
people, but to make them confront this
reality. Awareness of death has tradition-
ally been considered a great spur to
religious life. Since Benares is also one
of the Seven Sacred Cities, death
within the city also carries the hope of
ultimate liberation.
Manikkavachakar
(9th c.) Tamil poet-saint who was a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Shiva and
the author of the Tiruvachakam (“holy
utterances”). He is considered the fourth
great figure in the Tamil Shaivite tradi-
tion, along with the Nayanar poet-
saints, Appar, Sambandar, and
Sundaramurtti.
Manikkavachakar’s
hymns bear witness to the intensity of
his individual religious experience and
are seen as the culmination of the earlier
devotional (bhakti) tradition. These
hymns are also the basis for the devel-
opment of the Shaiva Siddhanta philo-
sophical school, making him a pivotal
figure in southern Indian Shaivism. For
further information see Glenn Yocum,
Hymns to the Dancing Siva, 1982.
Manimegalai
Tamil epic poem which was written as a
sequel to “The Jeweled Anklet”
(Shilappadigaram), connecting its
characters with those of the earlier play.
The story focuses on a young woman
named Manimegalai who, although
wooed by the local prince, becomes a
Buddhist nun. Manimegalai has numer-
ous debates with people from compet-
ing religious traditions, thus giving a
picture of sixth century southern Indian
religious life.
Manipura Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, the manipura chakra is
one of the six psychic centers (chakras)
believed to exist in the subtle body. The
[[420]]

subtle body is an alternate physiological
system, existing on a different plane of
reality than gross matter, but corre-
sponding to the material body. The six
psychic centers are visualized as multi-
petaled lotus flowers running roughly
along the spine, connected by three ver-
tical channels. Each of the chakras has
symbolic associations with various
human capacities, different subtle ele-
ments (tanmatras), and different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from the
letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, encom-
passing all sacred sound. Above and
below these centers are the bodily
abodes of Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power), the two divine principles
through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind the concept of the
subtle body is the homology of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mysti-
cal texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated starting from the bottom; the
manipura chakra is the third. It is visual-
ized as a ten-petaled lotus, located in
the region of the navel. The petals each
contain a seed, in this case the conso-
nants from retroflex “dha” to “pha.” The
manipura chakra is identified as the
bodily seat for the subtle element of fire,
the power of which is believed to bring
about digestion. For further information
see Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Manipuri
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathak, and Kathakali. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dance shows strong regional identifica-
tion; Manipuri is found only in the state
of Manipur, nestled between Burma and
Assam in eastern India. Developed in
the eighteenth century, Manipuri
reflects the importance of Vaishnava
devotionalism. One of the principalMan-Lion Avatar
dance genres involves acting out
episodes from the life of the god
Krishna, especially the Ras lila and his
dalliance with his lover Radha. In other
genres dancers play a two-headed drum
or cymbals, leaping dramatically during
the performance. This form has roots in
devotional Vaishnavism, particularly the
ecstatic singing and dancing associated
with the Gaudiya Vaishnava community
in Bengal. For further information see
Mohan Khokar, Traditions of Indian
Classical Dance, 1984.
Man Lila
A divine play (lila) between Krishna and
his devotees (bhakta). In this lila, one of
Krishna’s female companions feigns
wounded pride (man), usually because
he makes some sort of error, such as
calling her by another woman’s name.
For some time she pretends to be angry,
but is eventually won over by his charm
and undivided attention. This motif
of a woman feigning anger—to make
her lover flatter and fawn over her,
and to sweeten the joy of the eventual
reconciliation—has a venerable history
in Sanskrit poetry. In modern times,
this lila is often presented in devotional
theatrical presentations, which are
themselves known as lilas (“plays”),
since their function is to reveal the work
of the divine.
Man-Lion Avatar
Fourth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu; the man-lion’s form is usually
rendered as the head and shoulders of a
lion, and the torso and legs of a man. As
with all the avatars of Vishnu, the Man-
Lion avatar comes to restore the cosmic
balance, which has been thrown out of
equilibrium by the disproportionate
power of some individual. In this case
the source of trouble is the demon-king
Hiranyakashipu, who by the power of
his asceticism (tapas) has gained three
boons from the gods: that he cannot be
killed by man nor beast, by day or by
night, and neither inside nor outdoors.
Portrait of the god Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar.
Vishnu takes this form to defeat a demon who
has conquered heaven and earth.
These boons render him virtually
invulnerable; Hiranyakashipu proceeds
to conquer the earth and drive the
gods from heaven. He oppresses his
son Prahlada, who despite his
father’s power remains a sincere devotee
(bhakta) of Vishnu. The more devotion
Prahlada shows to Vishnu the more
abuse his father gives him, until
finally Hiranyakashipu, maddened at
the thought that someone refuses
to worship him, is at the point of
killing Prahlada.
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,
and the Man-Lion, a being which is nei-
ther man nor beast, bursts forth from a
pillar in the palace. The Man-Lion seizes
Hiranyakashipu in the palace doorway,
which is neither inside nor out, at twi-
light, which is neither day nor night, and
uses his sharp claws to tear out the
demon’s entrails, killing him. Once
Hiranyakashipu has been killed, Vishnu
installs the righteous Prahlada as the
king of the realm. This action reveals an
important truth about the Hindu view of
reality. Although Prahlada is a “demon”
(asura), he is not inherently evil, nor is
he simply a being to be exterminated.
All kinds of beings have their rightful
place in the Hindu cosmos—problems
[[421]]
Manmatha
come when they gain disproportionate
power and use it to their own ends.
Manmatha
(“churning the mind”) Epithet of the
Krishna, reflecting his ability to
bewitch and beguile his devotees
(bhakta). See Krishna.
Mansa Devi
Presiding deity in the village of
Manimajara, located in the Shiwalik
Hills, a short distance from Chandigarh,
and one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
According to local tradition, this is one
of the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Mansa Devi was Sati’s
head. The word mansa means “wish,”
and it is claimed that Mansa Devi
will grant whatever wish the devotee
(bhakta) brings to her. There is another
temple of Mansa Devi on the hill above
the bathing (snana) ghats in the sacred
city of Haridwar; here, too, the officiants
claim that the presiding deity will fulfill
all one’s wishes.
The charter myth for the Manimajara
Mansa Devi, set in the time of the
Moghul emperor Akbar, illustrates her
power and concern for her devotees.
Akbar appoints a Rajput chieftain to
manage the land around Manimajara.
One year the chieftain is unable to pay
his taxes because bad weather has
ruined the crops. The chieftain is put in
prison, but his plight moves one of
Mansa Devi’s devotees, who implores
her to intervene in his behalf. The chief-
tain is released and the taxes waived;
when the chieftain discovers how this
has happened, he is so grateful that he
erects a temple in honor of the goddess.

[[422]]

Manthara
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Manthara is the
hunchbacked maid of King Dasharatha’s
wife, Kaikeyi. Manthara’s whisperings
against Dasharatha’s son Rama, the
god-king who is the epic’s protagonist,
slowly poisons Kaikeyi’s mind. She
succeeds in convincing the queen that
after Rama has been crowned
Dasharatha’s heir, she and her son
Bharata will be little better than
slaves, if they are allowed to live at all.
Goaded by Manthara, Kaikeyi decides
to demand two boons Dasharatha
gave her years before. With the first
boon she dictates that Rama be sent in
exile to the forest for fourteen years,
and with the second she stipulates
that her son Bharata be crowned heir
in Rama’s place.
The epic’s oldest version, the
Ramayana of Valmiki, paints Manthara
as a genuine villain. There is little
explanation for her actions, although
given the belief in karma, her physical
disabilities would have been seen as
revealing moral and spiritual deformity
as well. In the Ramayana, written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
Manthara’s behavior is ultimately attrib-
uted to the gods who send the goddess
Saraswati to confound Manthara’s mind,
setting in motion the chain of events
leading to the demon Ravana’s death. In
typical fashion, Tulsidas puts a more
charitable spin on the event, relating it
to Rama’s ultimate purpose for being
born on earth.
Mantra
In its most basic sense, sacred sound. A
mantra is a collection of phonemes that
may or may not have syntactic meaning
as actual words, since their importance
comes not from the meaning of the
utterances, but from the very sounds
themselves. Mantras are believed to
confer power and varying spiritual
capacities on those who have been given
the qualification (adhikara) to use
them. The qualification comes fromManu Smrti
being given the mantra by one’s teacher,
believed to transmit not only the sounds
of the mantra, but the power associated
with it. This living transmission is
considered an essential feature in “pos-
sessing” the mantra; for this reason
mantras learned in other contexts are
believed to be ineffective. The idea
of mantra as sacred sound is traced
back to the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts. One of the most common
mantras, the Gayatri mantra, is actually
a verse from the Rg Veda (3.62.10).
The use of mantras is emphasized in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra. For further informa-
tion

Mantraraja
(“king of mantras”) Name given to a
particular eight-syllable mantra asso-
ciated with the god Vishnu, in which
he is addressed as Narayana. The
mantra itself is “Om Namo Narayana”
(“Om, homage to Narayana”). This
mantra is particularly important in
the Shrivaishnava religious commu-
nity, which developed in southern
India in the twelfth century. The
mantra is especially associated with
the community’s founder, Ramanuja.
Faithful recitation of this mantra is
said to bestow residence in Vishnu’s
heavenly abode, Vaikuntha.
Mantrashastra
The name for the body of learning that
focuses on mantras or sacred formulae:
their classification, meaning, and use.
Some of this learning exists in textual
form, but given the secret nature of the
subject matter, and the traditional insis-
tence on oral, personal transmission
from a religious teacher, much exists
only in oral form.
Manu
In Hindu mythology, the Manus are
fourteen semidivine kings, perceived as
the progenitors of the human race and
rulers over the universe. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years; the active phase is known as the
Day of Brahma; the quiet phase is
known as the Night of Brahma. In one
instance of cosmic time, each Day of
Brahma is divided into fourteen equal
periods, each ruled by one of the four-
teen Manus.
Manu Smrti
(“Laws of Manu”) One of the smrtis or
“remembered” texts, a class of literature
deemed important, but less authorita-
tive than the shrutis or “heard” texts.
This smrti is ascribed to the sage Manu
and is an example of one of the Dharma
Shastras—manuals prescribing rules for
correct human behavior and ideal social
life. The Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, reinforcing the
authority of these texts. Manu’s text is by
far the most influential of the Dharma
Shastras and is believed to have been
composed just before the beginning of
the common era.
Manu’s text shows the break between
the Dharma Sutras and the Dharma
Shastras, for it is plainly intended as a
blueprint for an entire society, rather
than a set of rules for a particular brah-
min group. The introductory chapter
details the creation of the world and the
consequent social order; the chapter
ends by summarizing the rest of the vol-
ume’s contents. The next five chapters
focus on the four major social groups
(varnas) and the four stages of life
(ashramas), using material from the
Dharma Sutras.
Manu’s themes in chapters seven
through nine sharply diverge from earli-
er sources. Chapter seven defines the
duties of a king. Chapters eight and nine
[[423]]
Manvantara
treat various legal matters that might
come before the king for adjudication.
Manu attempts to put all of these under
eighteen thematic headings. The mater-
ial in these chapters encompasses
all manner of criminal and civil law,
from assault and theft to contract
law and marital duties laying down
a legal framework for the stable
governance of society.
The remaining chapters are less orig-
inal. The tenth chapter discusses occu-
pations that members of the different
varnas may follow in times of distress
(apaddharma), when normal social
rules no longer apply. The eleventh
talks about gifts to brahmins and rites
of expiation (prayashchitta), remaining
faithful to the Dharma Sutras. Manu’s
final chapter has a more abstract and
speculative nature, focusing on the
workings of karma and describing the
consequences of various good and evil
acts. The text has been translated
numerous times; see Wendy Doniger
O’Flaherty and Brian K. Smith, The Laws
of Manu, 1991.
Manvantara
Manvantara is the name of an era in one
instance of cosmic time. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years; the active phase is known as
the Day of Brahma and the quiet phase
is known as the Night of Brahma. In
one instance of cosmic time, each
Day of Brahma is divided into fourteen
equal periods, each ruled by one of
the fourteen Manus. Manus are cele-
brated as the sovereigns of the earth
and are perceived as semidivine beings
who are the progenitors of the human
race. Currently we are living in the
seventh age, with seven yet to come.
The Manu of this present age,
Vaivasvata, was saved from pralaya
(universal destruction) by Vishnu in his
form as the Fish avatar. Vaivasvata is
[[424]]

regarded as the progenitor of the Solar
Line of Kings.
Maranashaucha
The ritual impurity (ashaucha) caused
by death (marana). All bodily effluvia
(hair, spittle, pus, blood, etc.) are con-
sidered to be sources of impurity, but a
corpse is the most impure thing of all.
Any death immediately causes the most
violent impurity, affecting the entire
family. For the family’s safety, this impu-
rity must be carefully contained and
managed through the funeral rites
(antyeshthi samskara). Here one sees
the significant ritual difference between
birth and death. Although birth also
brings impurity (sutakashaucha) on the
family, because of the bodily products
attending it, this impurity is considered
less violent, because the birth of a child
is an auspicious, life-affirming event.
Death, on the other hand, is seen as
bringing bad fortune, and thus the fam-
ily must not only take care of this impu-
rity, but must also get rid of the
inauspiciousness caused by the death.
Maratha
Traditional Indian society was a collec-
tion of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis. Jatis were
organized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation, over which each group held a
monopoly. The Maratha jati was one of
the dominant landholding communities
in the Maharashtra region, along with
the Kunbis. They were most concentrated
on the Konkan coast and the inland
region around the city of Pune. The
Marathas were tough peasant farmers
who by the middle of the eighteenth
century had forged a large but short-
lived empire, the Maratha confederacy,
extending over much of northern and
central India. By the latter part of the
eighteenth century, the confederacy had
fragmented into various smaller states.Maricha
Maratha Dynasty
(17th–19th c.) Central Indian dynasty in
the region of the western state of
Maharashtra, particularly along the
Konkan coast of the Arabian Sea. The
dynasty was founded by the Maratha
chieftain Shivaji, who spent most of his
life locked in a bitter struggle with the
Moghul empire. At Shivaji’s death in
[[1680]]
, the Marathas controlled only a
small strip of land in western
Maharashtra. After the death of the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb in 1707,
the Moghul empire began to disinte-
grate; the Marathas filled the political
vacuum. At its peak in the mid-1700s,
the Maratha Confederacy controlled
northern and central India from coast to
coast, stretching as far north as Delhi
and
the
Ganges
River
basin.
Expansionism was halted in 1761, when
the Maratha army was defeated by the
Afghans at Panipat in the state of
Haryana, a short distance north of
Delhi. Both groups of combatants sus-
tained major losses in the battle, render-
ing them unable to contest the arrival of
the British. A little more than a decade
later, the Maratha Confederacy had frag-
mented into constituent states, each
with its own capital. Of these, the
Bhonsle dynasty had its capital in the
city of Nagpur, the Holkar dynasty had
its capital in the city of Indore, the
Gaikwad dynasty had its capital in the
city of Baroda. The Scindia dynasty had
capitals in Gwalior and Ujjain, while the
Peshwa dynasty had its capital in Pune.
All except for the last survived as princely
states until Indian independence in
[[1947]]
. See also Moghul dynasty.
Margali
Ninth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Dhanush (the zodiacal
sign of Sagittarius), usually falling with-
in December and January. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Margashirsha
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Margashirsha is the ninth
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within November and December.
Margashirsha is generally considered an
inauspicious month; the only major fes-
tivals in Margashirsha are Bhairava
Jayanti, Utpanna Ekadashi, and
Mokshada Ekadashi.
Maricha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Maricha is the uncle
of Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka
who is the epic’s antagonist. After
Ravana’s sister Shurpanakha has been
insulted and mutilated by Rama and
Lakshmana, the epic’s protagonists,
Ravana decides to take revenge by
abducting Rama’s wife, Sita. He enlists
Maricha’s help to kidnap Sita. Maricha
takes the form of a golden deer. When
Sita sees the deer, she asks Rama to kill it
for her. Rama pursues the deer into the
forest, giving Lakshmana strict instruc-
tions to stay with Sita no matter what
happens. Rama pursues the deer some
distance from their home and finally
gets close enough to shoot it.
With his dying breath, Maricha cries
out Lakshmana’s name in a voice that
sounds like Rama’s, intending to draw
Lakshmana away and leave Sita unpro-
tected. Given his orders, Lakshmana is
at first unwilling to leave. He finally
leaves when Sita, in an uncharacteristic
display of suspicion and anger, accuses
Lakshmana of withholding help to
Rama because he wants to have her to
himself. At this unjust allegation,
Lakshmana is spurred into action.
Before he leaves he draws a magical
[[425]]
Marichi
protective circle around Sita, instructing
her that no harm can befall her as long
as she stays in the circle. Ravana, in the
form of an old ascetic, approaches Sita,
begging for alms. Out of respect for an
ascetic, Sita steps out of the circle to
offer the alms. Ravana reveals his true
form and carries her away.
Marichi
In Hindu mythology, one of the six
sons of Brahma, all of whom become
great sages. All are “mind-born,” mean-
ing that Brahma’s thoughts are enough
to bring them into being. The others
are Kratu, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha,
and Atri.
Mariyammai
Originally a local goddess in southern
India, whose cult has become a regional
phenomenon. Mariyammai embodies
many of the contradictions and tensions
associated with Hindu conceptions of
the Goddess in general. According to her
charter myth, Mariyammai is originally
a brahmin woman, who is beheaded
because of her husband’s jealousy. She is
brought back to life, but not before her
body has become switched with that of
another woman, this one an untouch-
able. Mariyammai’s brahmin head and
untouchable body symbolize the imper-
fect joining of brahminical Hindu and
southern Indian culture, as well as the
nebulous status of brahmins as the
“head” of southern Indian society.
Markandeya
A sage in Hindu mythology. Markandeya
is best-known for two mythic exploits,
one of which is associated with the god
Shiva and the other with the god
Vishnu. According to tradition,
Markandeya is a very intelligent and
religious boy who is devoted to Shiva
and proficient in all the branches of
learning. This seemingly unlimited
potential is even more poignant because
he learns that he is fated to die at
sixteen. Shortly before his sixteenth
[[426]]

birthday, Markandeya begins to wor-
ship Shiva with even greater fervor.
Because of the boy’s accumulated reli-
gious merits, the servants of Yama, the
god of death, cannot get near him. So
Yama himself has to go for Markandeya.
When Yama throws his noose over
Markandeya to draw out the boy’s soul,
it also loops over the statue of Shiva to
which Markandeya is clinging. Shiva
arises from the image and kills Yama,
although he later relents and brings him
back to life.
Markandeya’s other mythic exploit is
a vision of pralaya, the universal disso-
lution of the cosmos. One evening as he
is meditating, the sky grows dark, the
wind rises, and rain falls until the earth
is inundated with water. Markandeya is
swept this way and that, until he comes
to an enormous banyan tree with an
infant sitting in it. Markandeya is drawn
to the child and sees that the entire uni-
verse is inside this infant boy. He wan-
ders inside the child for some time until
he falls out of the child’s mouth; then he
sees the infant and the banyan tree
again. Markandeya realizes that the
infant is Vishnu, but before he can reach
him again, the child has disappeared.
Markandeya Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
the sectarian compendia of mythic
stories and sacred lore that are among
the most important sources for modern
Hinduism. Markandeya is said to have
been an ancient sage, but he was not
intimately connected with any particu-
lar deity. In this respect, the
Markandeya Purana is different from
most of the others, which have a clear
sectarian bias. This purana is noted
for one of its subsections, the
Devimahatmya. Describing the ulti-
mate power behind all things as female,
the Devimahatmya is the earliest
and most important textual source
for the mythology of the Goddess.
Scholars contend that although
this text is the first place that this
theological conviction appears, it mustMarriage Ceremonies
have existed earlier, since it appears in
this text fully developed.
Marriage, Eight Classical Forms
Dharma literature (texts prescribing
rules for correct human behavior and
ideal social life) recognizes eight forms
of marriage: Brahma, Daiva, Arsha,
Prajapatya,
Asura,
Gandharva,
Rakshasa, and Paishacha. The first four
forms were approved (prashasta). In
each case, the father of the bride was
responsible for arranging the marriage:
in the Brahma form, he gave his daugh-
ter as a gift without conditions; in the
Daiva form, she was given as a sacrificial
fee; in the Arsha form, in exchange for a
pair of cattle for sacrifice; and in the
Prajapatya form, with the condition that
the husband and wife perform their
duties together.
The other four forms were consid-
ered reprehensible forms of marriage
(aprashasta). Two of these four were
tolerated: the Asura form, in which
the bride was exchanged for money,
and the Gandharva form, in which bride
and groom plighted their troth by
mutual consent—that is, through con-
sensual sexual intercourse. The final
two forms were strictly forbidden:
Rakshasa, in which the bride was
forcibly abducted; and Paishacha, in
which a man took sexual advantage of a
woman who was insentient—the result
of drunkenness, a deep sleep, or drug-
ging. It is interesting to note that all of
these forms were deemed to create a
valid marriage—even the two that were
forbidden. The aim in sanctioning
such forbidden marriages was not to
encourage such actions, but to give
the woman the legal status of a wife.
In contemporary times most of these
forms of marriage are no longer
practiced except for the Brahma
marriage, which carries the highest
status, and the Asura marriage. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. Despite
In many traditional Hindu marriage ceremonies,
the groom’s turban is attached to the bride’s sari,
binding the couple together.
their age, they remain the best sources for
traditional Hindu religious rites.
Marriage Ceremonies
In India, virtually everybody gets mar-
ried. Marriage is a religious duty for
twice-born men, satisfying one of their
Three Debts, in this case the debt to
their ancestors. Twice-born men are
householders born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society,
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya. Such
men are eligible to receive the adoles-
cent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” For most Hindu women,
being wives and mothers defines their
identity. Marriage is also the event by
which families are formed and grow.
Since the family is considered the
bedrock of Hindu society, for most peo-
ple, marriage is the single most impor-
tant event in their lives.
The great significance of marriage
in Hindu culture means that this
life-changing event is attended with
potential peril because there is no
certainty of success. Other potential
dangers come from the inauspicious
nature of certain times, people, and
the belief that this inauspiciousness
may bring bad fortune for the future.
Finally, given that the bride and groom
are the center of attention in the days
before the marriage, there is the danger
[[427]]
Marriage Ceremonies
that other people’s ill will and envy may
unleash malevolent and unseen forces. As
with many of the other life transitions,
Hindu marriages are attended with con-
siderable attention to discerning the
unseen forces that could have a negative
affect on the couple’s future life and pro-
tecting the bride and groom from them.
The wedding is always performed at an
astrologically auspicious time, to start the
marriage on the best possible note. In the
days before the wedding, the bride is often
secluded, keeping her from coming in
contact with people or things deemed
inauspicious. On their wedding day both
the bride and groom are anointed and
adorned similar to the deities in a tem-
ple—according to popular belief, on their
wedding day, the couple become Lakshmi
and Vishnu, god and goddess. This
heightened status puts them in ritual dan-
ger when they are outside in the world,
both from the legion of sources for ritual
impurity (ashaucha), and because they
are believed to be more susceptible to the
evil eye (nazar) and other forms of witch-
craft. These dangers are countered by
amulets and various rites of protection
when the bride or groom must be in the
public eye, such as when the groom and
his group of friends travel in triumphal
procession to the wedding hall, as is com-
mon in northern India. Once inside, the
danger is less pressing, since they are in a
closed and ritually structured environ-
ment, surrounded by family and friends.
There is no single Hindu marriage
ceremony, as is clear from the eight clas-
sical forms of marriage recognized in
the dharma literature. Of these eight,
the two forms generally practiced today
are the Asura form, in which the groom’s
family gives money as a brideprice to
obtain the bride; and the Brahma form,
in which the bride’s family gives their
daughter to the groom, without making
any conditions on him at all (although
in contemporary times the groom’s
family can usually expect a dowry
with the bride). The Brahma marriage
carries much higher social status and
is the most popular form. Although in
such a marriage the wedding cere-
[[428]]

monies have regional and sectarian
variation, certain common rites reveal
important cultural assumptions.
The two major themes in a Hindu mar-
riage are the transfer of the bride from her
family to her husband’s family, and the
indissoluble merging of bride and groom
into a new entity, the married couple. The
transfer of the bride is done in the
kanyadan ritual, the “gift of the virgin”
performed by the bride’s father. The bride
and groom’s marital union is symbolized
by several common rites, including pani-
grahana, in which the groom takes the
bride’s hand as a sign of their union.
Another such rite, considered the defining
point of the marriage, is the saptapadi, the
“seven steps” which the bride and groom
take together. The seventh step completes
the bride’s transfer to the groom’s family; it
is at this point that the marriage becomes
indissoluble. In modern times the sapta-
padi is often performed in conjunction
with another ceremony, the agnipradak-
shinam (“circumambulating the fire”).
Instead of taking seven steps, the bride
and groom make seven revolutions
around a small fire. On one hand, the pres-
ence of fire shows that marriage is a yajna
or Vedic sacrifice. On the other, since the
fire is considered to be the Vedic god Agni,
he becomes the divine witness to the mar-
riage. During the circumambulations the
bride and groom are often physically
joined by tying part of his turban to the
edge of her sari. This visible bond between
them is yet another sign of the inner union
that has just been formed.
As described, in marriage the wife’s
identity is “assimilated” to her hus-
band’s, rather than some sort of mutual
transformation. In northern India, the
bride lives with her husband’s family
after the marriage; her new identity
stems solely from her relationship
with her husband, whereas his iden-
tity remains essentially unchanged,
although augmented by marriage. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.
For information on modern practice,Martand
see Lawrence Babb, The Divine
Hierarchy, 1975. See also marriage,
eight classical forms.
Marriage Prohibitions
As in other cultures, Hindus have well-
defined rules and prohibitions regard-
ing whom one should and should not
marry—marriages should be endoga-
mous, that is, between members of the
same social subgroup (in this case, the
jati). Within this larger community, it is
generally accepted that the bride and
groom should not come from the same
gotra or the same pravara—both mythic
lineages detailing relationships with
ancient sages. The other strong prohibi-
tion was on marrying those with whom
one had a sapinda relationship—com-
mon ancestry. According to one well-
known code of law, the Mitakshara , the
sapinda relationship ceases after the
seventh generation on the father’s
side, and the fifth generation on the
mother’s. People with common
ancestors beyond those boundaries may
contract a valid marriage.
This sapinda formula was routinely
ignored, particularly in parts of
southern India, where marrying one’s
maternal uncle’s daughter was not
only permitted, but considered com-
mendable. While some of the texts in
the dharma literature condemn the
practice as an abomination, others
note that this is a practice peculiar to
the south, where it is permitted only
as part of the family’s customary
practice (kulachara).
There is a long history for cross-
cousin marriage in southern India; it is a
common practice even today. Among
southern Indian brahmins, there is
some speculation that their relatively
small population—about four percent
of the total—made it impossible to find
brahmin spouses under the strict crite-
ria. Given the competing imperatives to
marry other brahmins and to observe
the lineage restrictions, this custom was
deemed less important.
The village of Martand is known for its ruins of an
eighth-century temple built to the sun god.
Mars
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with activity, war, and mis-
fortune. Due to these associations, Mars
is considered a strong yet malignant
planetary force. Tuesday, the day of the
week ruled by Mars, is considered an
inauspicious day, a day on which people
often perform rites of protection to
safeguard themselves from Mars’s bale-
ful influence.

Marut
known for its temple to the sun god,
built during the eighth century. The
temple ruins are in a mountain meadow,

Marut
Class of minor deities considered to be
the companions of Indra, god of the
storm. The Maruts are described as hav-
ing a flashing color, armed with golden
weapons symbolic of lightning, and
roaring like lions.
Marwari
Northern Indian trading community
named after its place of origin, the
Marwar region surrounding Jodhpur in
Rajasthan. The Marwaris have spread
all over northern India; many of them
have become extremely wealthy. The
Marwaris are stereotyped as ruthless
and cutthroat in their business prac-
tices, yet at the same time, they are
munificent in donations to religious
causes, reflecting traditional religious
piety. The most successful Marwari fam-
ilies, such as the Birlas, still control large
parts of the Indian economy. Marwari
support and patronage is an important
consideration for all northern Indian
political parties.
Masi
Eleventh month in the Tamil year, cor-
responding to the northern Indian
month of Kumbha (the zodiacal sign
of Aquarius), usually falling within
February and March. The existence of
several different calendars is a sign of
the continuing importance of regional
cultural patterns. One way that the
Tamils retain their culture is by preserv-
ing their traditional calendar. Tamil
is one of the few regional languages
in India with an ancient, well-
established literary tradition. See also
Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and

[[430]]

Materialist
The name for a philosophical school
espousing the belief that the individ-
ual and the physical body are identi-
cal. The body is composed of certain
physical elements, so with the death
of the body, the individual ceases to
exist. Since the materialists believed
there is no life after death, they also
believed there is no reason to engage
in religious activities in the hope of a
better afterlife. The materialist
believes that one should live well,
enjoy life to the fullest, and then die.
This viewpoint was first espoused by
Ajita Keshakambalin, who was a con-
temporary of the Buddha. Its later
adherents were called both Lokayata
(“worldly”) and Charvaka (after the
supposed founder). The materialists
were universally reviled by the other
philosophical schools, all of whom
considered their rejection of religious
life dangerous. One of their philo-
sophical theories, and a sign of their
rootedness in concrete experience,
was their position on the pramanas,
the means by which human beings
can gain true and accurate knowledge.
Most schools admitted at least three
such pramanas—perception (prat-
yaksha), inference (anumana), and
authoritative testimony (shabda). In
contrast, the materialists accepted
only perception, denying the validity
of the other two. Emphasis is placed
on experience and the belief that
what is directly before one’s eyes is
indisputable.
Math
(often translated as “monastery”) A
dwelling place for ascetics; usually a
large, well-settled dwelling for a number
of ascetics belonging to an established
order. The four most famous maths are
believed to have been established by the
philosopher Shankaracharya: the Jyotir
Math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath; the Govardhan Math in the
city of Puri, on the Bay of Bengal; theMatsya
Sharada Math in the city of Dwaraka
on the Arabian Sea; and the Shringeri
Math in the town of Shringeri in
southern India. These maths are the
headquarters for the four major
groups in the Dashanami sect
Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
Although most maths do not have the
status of these four, they all serve as
ascetic and religious centers.
Mathura
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Braj region of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, about ninety miles south of
Delhi. Mathura is known as the town
in which the god Krishna was born.
The Krishna Janam Bhumi, purport-
edly the site of his birth, can still be
seen today. Krishna was spirited out of
Mathura on that same night because
his wicked uncle Kamsa, who was
king of Mathura, had killed all of
Krishna’s older siblings at birth. When
Krishna came of age he returned to
Mathura, killed Kansa, and claimed
his patrimony. As with sites in the
Braj region, Mathura is full of associa-
tions with Krishna’s earthly life; these
allow his devotees (bhakta) access to
him, in that they can visualize the
places he visited, and thus through
imagination take part in his mythic
deeds themselves.
Mathurakavi
(10th c.) The last of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
emphasis on passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god, conveyed
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage, transformed and revitalized
Hindu religious life. According to tradi-
tion, Mathurakavi was the disciple of
Nammalvar, to whom he was led from
northern India by a great light in the
southern sky. By asking a question about
the supreme spirit, Mathurakavi was
able to rouse Nammalvar from a yogic
trance in which the latter had spent
much of his life. From that point
Mathurakavi served Nammalvar as his
guru. Whereas the other Alvars were
quite prolific, Mathurakavi wrote only
ten songs, all in praise of his master. For
further information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975; John Stirling
Morley Hooper, Hymns of the Alvars,
[[1929]]
; and A. K. Ramanujan (trans.),
Hymns for the Drowning, 1981.
Matrilinear Succession
(Marumakkatayam) Most of Hindu
society is overwhelmingly patrilineal
(organized around the father’s familial
line). However, the Nayars of the state
of Kerala in southern India base soci-
ety on matrilineal succession (the
mother’s familial line). Matrilineal suc-
cession was practiced from very early
times, although it had largely disap-
peared by the middle of the twentieth
century. Under a matrilineal system,
both descent and inheritance are
passed on through the mother’s line,
which is center of the family. The
woman’s husband lives in her family
home, but has no claim upon their
children, and no claim on any of their
marital property. A man has a certain
amount of control over his own fami-
ly’s ancestral property—which he is
often called to manage—but the prop-
erty ultimately is inherited by his sis-
ter’s children, rather than his own. In
many cases the woman’s “official” hus-
band never actually consummates the
marriage, and the woman is free to
form long-term liaisons with other
men, according to her choice.
Matsya
(“fish”) In the secret ritually-based reli-
gious practice known as tantra, fish is
the second of the “Five Forbidden
Things” (panchamakara), which, in
“left hand” (vamachara) tantric ritual,
are used in their actual forms, but are
[[431]]
Matsya Avatar
represented by symbolic substitutes in
“right hand” (dakshinachara) tantric
ritual. “Respectable” Hindu society
strongly condemns the consumption of
nonvegetarian food, so this ritual use
must be seen in the larger tantric
context. One of the underlying tantric
assumptions is the ultimate unity of
everything that exists. From a tantric
perspective, to affirm that the entire
universe is one principle means that the
adept must reject all concepts based on
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden
Things” provide a ritual means for
breaking down duality. In this ritual the
adept breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a con-
scious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara), and
is thus superior to common practice. For

Matsya Avatar
The first of the ten avatars or incarna-
tions of the god Vishnu, which all took
place at moments of crisis in the cos-
mos. See Fish avatar.
Matsyagandhi
(“[she whose] smell is fish”) In Hindu
mythology, another name for queen
Satyavati. Matsyagandhi is a fisher-girl
who stinks of fish. She attracts the eye of
a powerful sage, who later uses his
magic powers to give her a pleasant
scent. See Satyavati.
Matsyendranath
According to tradition, the guru of the
sage Gorakhnath and the founder of the
Nathpanthis, a group of renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
[[432]]

the god Shiva. He is also known as
Minanath. According to the Nathpanthi
tradition, Matsyendranath received his
teaching from Shiva himself, by taking
the form of a fish (in Sanskrit, the words
matsya and mina both mean “fish”), and
eavesdropping while Shiva was teaching
his wife Parvati. For further information
about Gorakhnath and the Nath tradi-
tion, see George Weston Briggs,
Gorakhnath and the Kanphata Yogis,

. See also tantra.
Matter, Primeval
The general translation given to the
Sanskrit word prakrti, one of the two
first principles in the Samkhya philo-
sophical school. See prakrti.
Mauni
Derived from the word muni (“sage”),
mauni designates a person who is
observing a vow of silence as a religious
act. Just as members of certain Christian
monastic orders observe a vow of
silence to turn their thoughts inward
and enrich their inner lives, in the same
way Hindu ascetics have taken vows of
silence as a tool for spiritual develop-
ment. At times these vows may be for a
finite period of time (a week, a month,
and so on), but even now there are
ascetics who have not spoken in
decades, communicating through
expression, gesture, and writing on a
piece of paper or a slate.
Mauni Amavasya
This festival falls on the day of the
new moon (amavasya) in the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February).
Those observing this holiday pass the
day in silence. The word mauni (speech-
less) is derived from the word muni
(sage); silence is seen as one of the reli-
gious practices helping to promote spir-
itual awareness. During the entire
month of Magh, bathing (snana) in the
Ganges (or another sacred river) is seen
as meritorious. Bathing on the day of
the new moon offers greater sanctity. AMaya Devi
well-known spot for this rite is at the city
of Allahabad, at the confluence of the
Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers.
Mauritius
Island nation in the Indian Ocean, 1,200
miles east of the African coast. Mauritius
has a significant Hindu diaspora popu-
lation. As in many other cases, Indians
were first brought to Mauritius as inden-
tured agricultural laborers, in this case
as workers on the sugar plantations.
Currently, they comprise nearly 75 per-
cent of the island’s population, running
the nation’s political system. The Hindus
on Mauritius have transferred India’s
sacred geography to their new land: A
southern lake named Grand Bassin is
claimed to have an underground con-
nection to the River Ganges, and the
lake has become a significant pilgrim-
age site.
Maurya Dynasty
The earliest of the great Indian empires.
At its zenith, the Maurya dynasty ruled
over most of the Indian subcontinent,
except in the deep south. The dynasty
was founded by Chandragupta Maurya
in the fourth century B.C.E., but reached
its peak under his grandson Ashoka,
who reigned from 269–232 B.C.E. The
kingdom was centered in the lower
Ganges basin, with its capital at
Pataliputra, near the modern city of
Patna in the state of Bihar. The Mauryan
empire is the first historically docu-
mented centralized Indian empire; it
was operated and maintained by a large
governmental bureaucracy. Despite its
size and organization, the empire was
short-lived. It began to disintegrate on
Ashoka’s death; fifty years later it had
virtually disappeared.
Maya
A Sanskrit word. Maya’s literal meaning
is “magic” or “illusion”; the connotation
it carries is a magic show or illusion in
which objects appear to be present, but
are not. In the Hindu philosophical
tradition, maya describes how human
beings become confused about the true
nature of the world and themselves.
Such illusion keeps them enmeshed in
bondage to their desires and continues
the cycle of reincarnation (samsara)
that comes from this; at the same time,
however, such people are unaware that
they are in bondage.
In Hindu theism—in which the high-
est power is conceived as a deity—maya
is generally described as one of God’s
powers, through which the deity can
accomplish his or her purposes; in this
understanding, maya is seen as an exist-
ing entity. The analysis of maya is a little
different in the Advaita Vedanta school,
which propounds a position known as
monism. Monism claims that a single
Ultimate Reality, called the unqualified
Brahman, lies behind all things. Despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity, the only thing that really exists is
this formless, unqualified Brahman. For
the Advaitins, the assumption of diversity
is a fundamental misunderstanding of
the ultimate nature of things. The
Advaita school accepts that God wields
maya as a power, but since God (as a
being with particular qualities) is con-
sidered lower than the highest, ultimate
Brahman, both God and maya are part
this lower reality. Thus, both are ulti-
mately not real. The Advaitins describe
maya as confusion from the lack of
correct understanding; the confusion
disappears when perfect liberation has
been reached.
Maya Devi
Local goddess considered to be a form
of Durga, whose home is in the northern
Indian town and sacred city of
Haridwar. According to local tradition,
the site where her temple is built is one
of the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess which spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; Maya Devi was Sati’s
[[433]]
Mayapur
navel. Although this claim is not attested
in other literature on the Shakti Pithas,
the site itself is believed to be very old.
One of the oldest names for the
Haridwar region is Mayapur, the “city of
Maya.” See also pitha.
Mayapur
City in West Bengal on the western side
of the Hugli River across from the holy
city of Navadvip, about sixty-five miles
north of Calcutta. Although both cities
claim to be the birthplace of the Bengali
saint Chaitanya, Navadvip’s claim is
older. However, the claim that Mayapur
was the birthplace of Chaitanya is sup-
ported by the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more
popularly known as the Hare Krishnas,
who have built a magnificent temple
complex at Mayapur as the headquar-
ters of the organization. For extensive
information about this site, see E. Alan
Morinis, Pilgrimage in the Hindu
Tradition, 1984.
Mayashiva
(“illusionary Shiva”) In Hindu mythology,
a demon named Jalandhara assumes
the form of the god Shiva in an attempt
to trick Parvati, the goddess, into having
sexual relations with him. Jalandhara
has been unable to conquer Shiva on the
battlefield, so he hopes that he can
diminish Shiva’s power by compromis-
ing the faithfulness of his wife.
Jalandhara comes to Parvati in Shiva’s
form, but she is so suspicious that
Jalandhara is unable to fulfill his desires.
Jalandhara’s power is eventually broken
in the same way, when Vishnu (in the
form of Jalandhara) manages to seduce
Jalandhara’s wife, Vrnda.
Meat Eating
An accepted part of the diet for most
Hindus. A 1996 poll of urban Hindus
found that only a quarter of the respon-
dents were vegetarians. However, this
figure may be higher in villages, where
people tend to be more traditional and
[[434]]

conservative. As the product of a dead
animal, meat is seen as impure, and
those who are concerned about reli-
gious purity (particularly brahmins)
will generally avoid it for that reason.
Even nonvegetarians recognize a hierar-
chy of animal foods. Some people will
eat only eggs; others will also eat chicken
and/or fish, whereas others will also eat
mutton. Pork is generally avoided by all
but the lowest-status people; pigs are
considered scavengers and deemed
unclean. Beef is taboo for religious
reasons, except for a very small Hindu
community in southern India. Even
those who eat meat generally do not eat
it in large quantities. Because of its
relatively high cost, it is generally
prepared as one dish among many,
rather than the central part of the meal.
Medhatithi
(mid-9th c.) Author of the most authori-
tative commentary on the Manu Smrti,
also known as the “Laws of Manu.”
Medhatithi was schooled in the tech-
niques of textual interpretation devel-
oped by the Purva Mimamsa school,
one of the six schools of Hindu philoso-
phy. Due to his interpretive abilities, his
commentary quickly became the
accepted standard.
Medicine

Sushruta Samhita.
Megasthenes
(3rd c. B.C.E.) Ambassador sent to the
court of Chandragupta Maurya by
Seleucus Nicator, a general in Alexander
the Great’s army who ruled the eastern
part of the empire after Alexander’s
death. Megasthenes lived for many
years in the Mauryan capital,
Pataliputra. His reports of life there are
the first European accounts of India. His
original account no longer exists, but
the fact of its existence is attested to
by the many references to it in the
works of later Greek writers; theseMela
writers, however, often voice doubts
about his credibility and veracity. See
also Maurya dynasty.
Meghaduta
(“Cloud-Messenger”) One of the great
poetic works by Kalidasa (5th c.?), gen-
erally considered to be the greatest clas-
sical Sanskrit poet. The Meghaduta is a
short poem consisting of one hundred
verses, written entirely in an extremely
long meter called mandakranta—sev-
enteen syllables to each quarter verse.
The poem tells the story of a yaksha
(nature sprite) who has been temporarily
banished to the southern part of India.
Separated from his beloved wife, who is
at their home in the kingdom of Kubera
in the Himalayas, the yaksha sees a
monsoon rain cloud moving northward
in its annual journey. He implores it to
carry a message of love to his beloved.
The yaksha describes the regions
through which the cloud travels. This
description gives a vivid picture of
everyday life and the cultural centers of
Kalidasa’s time. In some sources the
poem is called Meghasandesha, “The
Message [carried by] a Cloud.”
Meghanada
(“roaring like thunder”) In the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics, Meghanada is one of the
epithets of Indrajit, son of the demon-
king Ravana. See Indrajit.
Meher Baba
(b. Merwan Sheriar Irani, 1894–1969)
Modern religious figure who was born a
Parsi, but whose teachings draw on
Islamic mystical thought and Hindu
devotional (bhakti) teachings. Meher
Baba (“Divine Father”) claimed to be an
avatar or “incarnation” of the divine,
and his followers accept him as such. In
[[1925]]
 he took a vow of silence, which he
kept for the rest of his life, communicat-
ing through gestures and an alphabet
board. Despite his silence, he compiled
his teachings in a five-volume set of
Pilgrims in Allahabad gather in a
mela tent to listen to a guru.
discourses titled God Speaks. Like many
contemporary Hindu missionary fig-
ures, Meher Baba emphasized the need
for devotion to one’s guru or religious
preceptor, through which the disciple
would gain all things. For further infor-
mation from a devotee’s (bhakta) per-
spective, see Jean Adriel, Avatar, 1947.
Mehndipur
Village in the state of Rajasthan in the
southern region between the cities of
Agra and Jaipur. The village is best
known for the temple to the god Balaji,
considered to be a form of the monkey-
god Hanuman. People possessed by
malevolent spirits come to Balaji to be
cured through his power. For a thorough
discussion of the language of posses-
sion and exorcism, see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991
Mela
(“meeting”) In the widest sense, the
word mela can refer to any type of large
gathering, usually for some specific pur-
pose. In a religious context, the word
mela is generally translated as “festival”
or fair. Melas include commercial inter-
ests, religious activity, and entertain-
ment. Melas are usually attended by vast
numbers of religious pilgrims, traveling
to the site of the festival. By far the
largest of these melas is the Kumbha
[[435]]
Mena
Mela at Allahabad. In 1989, the Kumbha
Mela drew 15 million people on a single
day, and millions more during the
month of the festival.
Mena
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the
minor deity Himalaya, and the mother
of Parvati, the goddess. Mena christens
her daughter, Uma, through her excla-
mation “U Ma!” (“Oh, don’t!”) when
Parvati announces her desire to make
the god Shiva her husband. The Shiva
Purana details Mena’s initial discomfi-
ture with her unconventional son-in-
law, yet later suggests Shiva as the
paradigm for the ideal husband, since
he is completely devoted to his wife.
Menaka
In Hindu mythology, a beautiful celestial
maiden (apsara), who is a minion of
Indra, the king of the gods. Menaka’s
primary function is to seduce sages
threatening to replace Indra as the ruler
of heaven. In traditional Indian culture,
semen is seen as the concentrated
essence of a man’s vital energies; celibacy
is a means to conserve and retain these
energies. Menaka’s powers of attraction
are used to seduce these ascetics,
diminishing their accumulated spiritual
powers. Her most notable partner is the
sage Vishvamitra, who is twice smitten
by her charms. Their first liaison
results in the birth of the maiden
Shakuntala, celebrated in the drama
Abhijnanashakuntala, written by the
poet Kalidasa. During their second liai-
son, Vishvamitra lives with Menaka for
ten years, before leaving her for renun-
ciant life in the forest.
Menstruation
In traditional Hindu culture all bodily
discharges are considered to be a source
of ritual impurity (ashaucha). Women
are considered ritually unclean during
their menstrual periods; menstrual
fluid is considered a source of impurity.
However,
menstruation
is
also
[[436]]

considered a sign of auspiciousness or
good fortune, since it indicates women’s
reproductive capacities. The ritual
observances and taboos for menstruat-
ing women vary widely between differ-
ing social groups. In some groups,
women are subject to only a few restric-
tions, such as a ban on entering temples
during that time. In other groups,
women are expected to confine them-
selves to certain parts of the house and
to refrain from everyday activities such
as cooking. Although such strict practice
sounds oppressive, for many women
this interval was prized as a monthly
respite from their everyday duties,
which would be performed by the other
women in the household.
Mercury
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with mental quickness,
memory, and education, based on its
short orbit around the sun. Despite
these generally positive features,
Mercury is considered a weak planet,
easily influenced toward benevolence
and malevolence by other planets,
or by its position in the natal
horoscope (janampatrika). Mercury’s
association with the mind suggests that
the mind’s powers can be harnessed for
either good or evil ends. During the
week, Mercury is said to rule over
Wednesday; this day is not heavily
marked as auspicious or inauspicious,
reflecting the planet’s light powers.
Mercury
(2) Elemental mercury is a pivotal
substance in Indian alchemy. Hindu
alchemy analyzes the world as a series
of bipolar opposites in tension with
one another. Unifying these opposing
forces brings spiritual progress and
end of reincarnation (samsara). This
model of uniting or transcending
opposing forces is shared with Hindu
tantra, a secret, ritually-based religious
practice. This theme is shared with
hatha yoga, which is based on a seriesMewar
of physical exercises that are also
believed to affect the subtle body.
The governing metaphor for this
combination of opposites is the union of
sun and moon. Both the sun and the
moon are connected to other opposing
principles through an elaborate series of
associations. In keeping with this bipo-
lar symbolism, mercury is conceived as
the semen of the god Shiva and thus full
of healing power. It is also identified
with the moon (perhaps through its
bright silvery hue), with healing and
restorative power, and with the nectar of
immortality. Elemental sulfur is identi-
fied with the goddess Shakti’s uterine
blood. When mercury and sulfur are
mixed and consumed, the aspirant’s
body is purified and refined, eventually
rendering it immortal. Modern descrip-
tions of this practice warn that it should
only be carried out under the direction
of one’s guru (spiritual teacher); other-
wise these combinations will be harm-
ful, since by itself mercury is a deadly
poison. For further information see
Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta, Obscure
Religious Cults, 1962; and David Gordon
White, The Alchemical Body, 1996.
Meru
Mythical mountain in the center of the
continent of Jambudvipa, the inner-
most of the concentric landmasses that
make up the visible world in traditional
Hindu cosmology; Mount Meru is the
center of the entire world, the pivot of
the entire created order. It is said to
extend far up into the heavens and
have its roots far beneath the earth, and
on its crest is a divine city which is the
home of the gods. The mythical Meru is
often identified with the Himalayan
mountain known as Kailas. For this
reason Kailas has been an important
pilgrimage place (tirtha), despite its
inaccessible location.
Meter, Poetic
Indian poetry has well-developed metrical
forms, basically following two dominant
patterns. The first metric pattern is
based simply on the number of syllables
in a line. In the second pattern, each line
contains a certain number of metric
beats, based on the distinction between
“heavy” and “light” syllables. A heavy
syllable is any syllable with a long vowel
or a consonant cluster and is given two
metric beats; all other syllables are con-
sidered light and counted as one beat.
Sanskrit poetry tends to stress the
former pattern, and has codified meters
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables
per half-line, yet even within these syl-
labic constraints each meter usually has
a prescribed sequence of light and heavy
syllables as well. Two different Sanskrit
poetic meters may thus have the same
number of syllables, but vary in their
syllabic patterns. Although such subtle
differences could generate vast num-
bers of meters, in practice there were
only about a hundred. The vast majority
of Sanskrit texts are written in a single
meter, the anushtubh, which has eight
syllables per half-line.
Later devotional (bhakti) poetry,
particularly in northern India, tend to
favor poetic forms based on the number
of metric beats. The most popular forms
are the doha, which has twenty-four
metric beats in two lines, and the chau-
pai, which has four lines of sixteen beats
each. Although there are several poetic
forms based on the number of syllables
in each line, particularly the savaiya and
the kavitt, these were used less often.
Mewar
In the time before Indian independence
in 1947, Mewar was a princely state in
southern Rajasthan, the capital of
which was in the city of Udaipur. In
the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turies, Mewar was one of the important
centers for the Rajasthani style of
miniature painting. The Rajasthani
style is characterized by a flat perspec-
tive. Visual power is derived from vivid
bands of colors that often serve as a
backdrop to the painting.
[[437]]
Mimamsa Sutras
Minakshi
The east gate of the Minakshi Temple in the city of
Madurai. The temple is dedicated to the goddess
Minakshi, the city’s guardian.
Mimamsa Sutras
The founding text of the Purva
Mimamsa school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy. The
Mimamsa Sutras are traditionally
attributed to the sage Jaimini, who is
believed to have lived in the fourth
century B.C.E. The Mimamsa school
was most concerned with the investiga-
tion of dharma (“righteous action”),
believed to be revealed in the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu religious texts.
Much of Mimamsa thought is con-
cerned with principles and methods
for textual interpretation, to discover
and interpret the instructions contained
in the Vedas. The Mimamsa Sutras
were elaborated in numerous commen-
taries, the most famous of which
were written by Kumarila and
Prabhakara in the seventh century.

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
[[438]]

(“fish-eyed”) Presiding deity of the
Minakshi temple in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. Her name
refers both to the shape of her eyes (long
and oval), and to their fluttering move-
ment, both of which are considered
marks of feminine beauty in classical
India. Minakshi was originally a local
deity, the guardian for the city of
Madurai. As Madurai became impor-
tant, by virtue of being the Pandya
dynasty capital, so did Minakshi.
According to her charter myth, Minakshi
is born with three breasts—already
a sign that she is unusual—and is
raised by her parents as a man. As she
accedes to the throne in Madurai, she
vows that she will only marry a man
who can defeat her in battle. She
fights and conquers all the kings of
the earth, but when she approaches
the god Shiva, she is suddenly stricken
with modesty and transformed from
a powerful warrior to a shy and
bashful girl. At this moment her third
breast disappears, further signifying
the loss of her special status. Minakshi
and Shiva (in his manifestation as
Sundareshvara) are married. Their
wedding is celebrated every year in
Madurai during the Chittirai festival.
Despite her transformation in the
charter myth, Minakshi is still an unusual
goddess. The wedding of a goddess
usually marks her domestication and
implies subordination to her husband.
Minakshi, however, remains the more
important deity in Madurai, perhaps
reflecting her previous status as the
city’s guardian deity. For more informa-
tion see Dean David Shulman, Tamil
Temple Myths, 1980.
Minanath
Another epithet for Matsyendranath,
traditionally cited as the spiritual
teacher (guru) of Gorakhnath, the great
yogi. See Matsyendranath.Mirabai
Miniature Painting
The origins of Hindu miniature painting
lie in the royal art of the Moghul court,
where miniature painting and portrai-
ture were well-established genres. In the
seventeenth century other centers for
miniature painting began to arise, per-
haps spurred by Moghul artists seeking
patronage in Hindu vassal kingdoms.
Although portraiture and court scenes
continued to be important, the minia-
ture genre expanded to include other
themes such as the illustration of the
musical modes known as ragas, which
are associated with particular times
and/or seasons. Another prominent
theme was Hindu religious imagery,
reflecting the influence of the devotional
(bhakti) movement, which was in full
flower in northern India. Religious
themes first concentrated mainly on the
mythic exploits of the god Krishna and
portrayals of the god Shiva. At times,
these two major themes were com-
bined. Miniature paintings were also
used to illustrate manuscripts, thus
integrating literature, art, music, and
religious images.
The development of Hindu minia-
ture painting can be broadly divided
into three schools, each corresponding
to a geographical area: Rajasthani,
Deccani, and Pahari. The earliest devel-
oped school was the Rajasthani, which
flourished in seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries in the Malwa region of
the state of Madhya Pradesh and the
small kingdoms that surrounded the
region. The Rajasthani style is character-
ized by a flat perspective; visual power
is derived from vivid bands of colors that
often serve as a backdrop to the paint-
ing. The Deccani style was established in
central India and showed little variation
from Moghul court art. The Pahari
(“mountain”) style flourished in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms in the Shiwalik Hills
north and west of Delhi. The Pahari style
first appeared in Basohli, where the
influence of the Rajasthani school is evi-
dent, and later developed in Jammu,
Guler, Garhwal, and Kangra. The devel-
oped Pahari style differs from the
Rajasthani style in its emphasis on more
linear drawing—perhaps influenced by
European art—and a more restrained
use of color, giving the paintings a more
lyrical feel. For further information see
W. G. Archer, Indian Painting, 1957. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Minorities
In any society, minority groups are
defined according to a particular social
context. In India the two most promi-
nent minority groups are Muslims and
Christians. Muslims—about twelve per-
cent of the population—are viewed with
suspicion, due to India’s troubled rela-
tions with Pakistan. Christians and
Muslims are viewed as having religious
loyalties that lie outside of India—
Mecca for Muslims, and Rome or
Jerusalem for Christians. These two
communities have been perceived very
differently from other religious commu-
nities, such as the Sikhs and the Jains,
who are part of the Indian cultural tradi-
tion. Cultural and political organiza-
tions espousing forms of Hindu
nationalism (Hindutva), particularly the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh and its
affiliates, have often stressed the “other-
ness” of these communities. Such
organizations have as their express
purpose the unification of Hindus
from all regions, castes, and back-
grounds, but do so through criteria that
exclude these minorities.
Mirabai
(early 16th c.?) A poet-saint who was a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Krishna.
Although little is known about her,
Mirabai’s songs remain some of the
best-known devotional (bhakti) poetry.
According to tradition, Mirabai was
born into a royal family in a small king-
dom in Rajasthan. From her earliest
days, she was passionately devoted to
Krishna. Although her parents arranged
a marriage with the scion of another
[[439]]
Mitakshara
ruler, she considered Krishna to be her
true husband. After extended conflict
with her in-laws—in which they report-
edly attempted to poison her—her
release came with the death of her hus-
band, after which she was allowed to
leave her marital home. She spent her
later years visiting places associated
with Krishna and sharing in the “good
company” (satsang) of other devotees.
She went to Dwaraka, the city over
which Krishna is said to have ruled, and
met her end by being absorbed into the
image of Krishna at his temple there.
Mirabai’s poetry is marked by her
expressions of longing for Krishna. She
often speaks of herself either as his wife
or his waiting lover, seeking physical and
mystical union with him. Her poetry is
an intensely personal expression of her
religious fervor; the power of this long-
ing has made her a symbol of religious
devotion. For scholars, Mirabai’s poetry
raises perplexing questions of author-
ship, for the earliest manuscripts are
several hundred years older than when
she is supposed to have lived, but for
common people the songs bearing her
name are widely popular even today.
She has also been featured in at least ten
feature films, showing the staying power
of devotion even in the modern age. For
further information see A. J. Alston
(trans.), The Devotional Poems of
Mirabai, 1980; and John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs
of the Saints of India, 1988.
Mitakshara
A voluminous commentary on the
Yajnavalkya Smrti, written early in the
twelfth century by the scholar
Vijnaneshvara. This particular com-
mentary played a pivotal role in the
British colonial administration of India.
The British were content to have their
Indian subjects governed by their tradi-
tional religious laws, but to do so they
needed to know what these laws were.
For large sections of British India, the
Mitakshara was given the status of tradi-
tional law, functioning as a legal code.

The only major part of India in which
the Mitakshara did not hold sway was in
Bengal, where the legal authority was
the Dayabhaga. One of the major differ-
ences between the two was in matters of
inheritance. The Mitakshara stresses
inheritance by survivorship, in which
only living males can inherit property,
whereas the Dayabhaga stresses inheri-
tance by succession, in which a dead
man’s heirs can inherit in his name.
Mithila
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Mithila is the king-
dom ruled by King Janaka, foster father
of Sita, the goddess. The region is
known for its wealth, as well as for the
righteousness of its rulers; it is identified
with the Mithila region in the northern
part of the state of modern Bihar.
Mithuna
(“pair”) In architecture, the name for
what has been described as a “loving
couple.” A more candid characterization
is that of sculptures of men and women
engaged in sexual activity, either as a
pair or a larger group, with the occasion-
al animal thrown in for variety. The most
famous examples of such sculptures
are at the temples at Konarak in the
state of Orissa, and at Khajuraho in
the state of Madhya Pradesh. The
meaning behind such explicit sculp-
tures has been variously interpreted.
Some people claim that they sanction
carnal pleasure as a religious path,
some interpret them as representing
human union with the divine, and still
others view them as teaching that the
desire for pleasure must ultimately be
transcended to attain the divine. Any
of these may be true, or the sculptures
may simply reflect an affirmation of life
on all its levels.
Mitra Mishra
(early 17th c.) Author of the Viramitrodaya,
a compendium of Hindu lore. The
Viramitrodaya is an example of a class ofModes of Devotion
commentarial literature known as
nibandhas (“collections”). The compil-
ers of the nibandhas culled references
on a particular theme from the Vedas,
dharma literature, puranas, and other
authoritative religious texts, placing
these excerpts into a single volume.
Each of the Viramitrodaya’s twenty-two
sections is devoted to a particular aspect
of Hindu life, such as daily practice,
worship, gift-giving (dana), vows, pil-
grimage, penances (prayashchitta),
purification, death rites (antyeshthi
samskara), and law; the final section is
devoted to final liberation of the soul
(moksha). In addition to citing the
relevant scriptural passages, Mitra
Mishra also provides extensive com-
mentary of his own. His work became
an important source for later legal inter-
pretation, particularly in eastern India.
Mleccha
Sanskrit word traditionally used to
designate a foreigner or a non-Aryan.
The word mleccha is also used to
indicate a person who has become
an outcaste and thus has no place in
established society. The verb from which
the word mleccha is derived means
“to speak confusedly or indistinctly,”
indicating someone who has not yet
mastered the language.
Mnemonics
The best-known example of a mnemonic
system comes in the study of the Vedas,
the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Traditionally, the power of the Vedas is
not derived from the meaning of the
words, but in the very sounds them-
selves. It was imperative for the text to
be conveyed without error. This posed a
significant challenge. The Vedas have
been orally transmitted by an elaborate
system of learning strategies, keeping
the text unchanged for over three thou-
sand years, identical in all parts of India.
This remarkable feat was achieved by
memorizing the text in differing pat-
terns: as verses, as the individual words,
as pairs of words in sequential succes-
sion (ab, bc, cd, and so forth), and
according to some reports, backwards.
The ultimate aim of all of these patterns
was to render the text into sheer sound,
rather than phrases with definite syn-
tactic meaning, since the latter could be
subject to substitutions. Although this
effort has succeeded in preserving the
sacred sounds, in many cases the mean-
ings of these words have become
unclear, especially for words which
appear only once. This problem was evi-
dent as early as the fifth century B.C.E.,
when Yaska, the grammarian, wrote the
Nirukta, explaining the meaning of
many of these words.
Modes of Devotion
Devotion to God (bhakti) has been the
most important force in Hindu religion
for more than the past millennium.
However, the form and tone of this
devotion have varied considerably in
different times and places. The most
thorough articulation of different possi-
ble modes of devotion was done by
Rupa Goswami, who lived in the mid-
sixteenth century. Rupa was a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a mem-
ber of the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious
community founded by the Bengali
saint Chaitanya. Devotion to Krishna is
characterized by the emphasis on rela-
tionship, particularly the visualization
of mythic incidents from Krishna’s life,
through which one can enter his divine
world, and thus take part in his divine
“play” (lila) with the world.
Rupa distinguished five such modes,
which were characterized by growing
emotional intensity. The first was the
“peaceful mode” (shanta bhava), in
which the devotee found mental peace
through the realization of complete
identity with Brahman. This was seen as
an inferior mode, since the deity was
seen impersonally, and the devotee had
no personal relationship with God. The
other four modes were based on human
relationships, from the most distant to
the most intimate and loving: master

discovered remains of the ancient Indus Valley civilization.
and servant (dasa bhava), friend and
friend (sakha bhava), parent and child
(vatsalya bhava), and lover and beloved
(madhurya bhava). Although all of
these modes were legitimate forms of
relationship with the divine, the last was
considered the highest because it gener-
ated the most intense emotions.
Moghul Dynasty
(1525–1857) Muslim dynasty that ruled
large parts of India for almost 200 years.
The dynasty was established by Babar (r.
[[1625]]
–1630), a central Asian monarch
who had been displaced from his own
homeland in Afghanistan and defeated
the Lodi dynasty rulers at Panipat in
[[1625]]
. Babar’s son Humayan (1508–1556)
acceded to his father’s throne but spent
much of his life fighting an Afghan
threat. He finally recovered his kingdom,
but within six months died from injuries
sustained in a fall. Humayan was suc-
ceeded by his son Akbar (1542–1605),
considered the greatest of the Moghul
emperors, both for his long reign of
forty-nine years and for his efforts to
[[442]]

include his Hindu subjects as equal citi-
zens, not simply as conquered infidels.
Akbar was succeeded by Jahangir
(1569–1627), and Jahangir by Shah Jahan
(1592–1666). The last of the great
Moghuls was Aurangzeb (1618–1707),
who added parts of the Deccan region to
the Moghul empire. During Aurangzeb’s
reign, the Krishna Janam Bhumi in the
city of Mathura and the Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares were
destroyed. Such incidents have caused
much speculation as to whether the
destruction was the result of anti-Hindu
religious sentiments (the Moghuls were
Muslims) or an expression of Moghul
political dominance. After Aurangzeb’s
death the Moghul empire broke apart,
but the dynasty continued to wield
diminishing influence until the 1857
rebellion against the British, when it was
definitively removed.
Mohan
(“beguiling,” “bewildering”) Epithet of
the god Krishna, which may refer either
to his overwhelming attractiveness,Moksha
which is believed to beguile the mind, or
to his ability to wield maya or the power
of illusion, and thus cloud people’s
minds. See Krishna.
Mohenjo-Daro
Archeological site on the Indus River in
modern Pakistan, about two hundred
miles north of Karachi. Mohenjo-Daro is
one of the cities of the Indus Valley civi-
lization, a highly developed urban cul-
ture that flourished in the Indus Valley
region between the fourth and third mil-
lennia B.C.E. Harappa and Mohenjo-
Daro have been the most extensively
excavated of these cities, although
archeological work is proceeding at oth-
ers. Similarities at these different sites
reveal insights into this civilization’s
material culture. One of the features at
Mohenjo-Daro is the “Great Bath,” a
large water-tank built of brick and
sealed with pitch. Scholars speculate
that it was connected with ritual purity.
See also bath, Mohenjo-Daro.
Mohini
(“bewitching”) In Hindu mythology,
a
rapturously
beautiful,
divine
enchantress, seen as a manifestation of
the god Vishnu. Vishnu takes this form
to trick the demons into giving her their
share of the amrta, the nectar of immor-
tality, which has been churned from the
Ocean of Milk. Through her charms,
Mohini succeeds in getting the amrta
from the demons; she gives it to the
gods, thus depriving the demons of their
chance at immortality.
In most versions, the story ends here,
but the charter myth for the southern
Indian god Aiyappa adds an interesting
twist. According to the story, when Shiva
sees the enchanting figure of Mohini, he
cannot resist her. The product of this
union is Aiyappa, who is considered the
son of Shiva and Vishnu. Yet Aiyappa’s
unusual parentage occurs with good
reason, as with most such stories in
Hindu mythology. Aiyappa is born to kill
a demon named Mahishi, who has
received the boon that she can only
be killed by a person not born from
the union of male and female.
Mohini’s “true” identity (Vishnu) satis-
fies this condition, and when Aiyappa
comes of age he kills the demon. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Mohini Attam
The youngest form of classical Indian
dance, found mainly in the modern
state of Kerala. Mohini Attam was devel-
oped in the early eighteenth century
at the royal court in Travancore in
Kerala. This style of dance shows traits of
both Bharatanatyam and Kathakali, a
Keralan dance form. The dance is
named after the mythical enchantress
Mohini and projects a coquettish
sensuality. Some of the dance’s physical
poses are taken from Bharatanatyam,
whereas the stylized hand gestures
(mudras) come largely from Kathakali.
For further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Mohini Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright, waxing half of
the lunar month of Baisakh (April–
May). The festival is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu in his avatar as
Rama. Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, promising spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance;
observing this festival frees one from the
results of one’s evil acts.
Moksha
In Indian philosophy moksha is one of
the four purusharthas, or aims of life;
the others are artha (wealth, power, and
prosperity), kama (desire), and dharma
(righteousness). Moksha literally means
“release”—the human soul’s (atman)
final liberation from the cycle of reincar-
nation (samsara). The quest for libera-
tion involves questioning and ultimately
detaching oneself from pursuits of
[[443]]
Mokshada Ekadashi
normal social life. Although all four
purusharthas are legitimate and sanc-
tioned, liberation is usually seen as the
ultimate goal, the last goal to be pursued
after fulfilling the pleasures and pains
stemming from the other three. Moksha
is also unchanging, bringing one com-
plete and absolute freedom, whereas
the other three are ultimately tran-
sient, for they are pursued within the
ever-changing world of desires.
Mokshada Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright half of
Margashirsha (November–December).
As for all the eleventh-day observances,
this is dedicated to Vishnu. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites
usually involving fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promising specific
benefits for faithful performance.
Faithfully observing this festival is
believed to bestow final liberation
(moksha) of the soul.
Moneylending
An important element in the economic
activity of the traditional and modern
Indian merchant families. Since farmers
have profits only after the harvest, they
must be able to borrow during the other
times of the year. In modern times many
farmers borrow from banks, but in
earlier times their only resource was
these merchant families. Their interest
rates usually reflected the borrower’s
credit worthiness: unsecured loans
might have interest rates as high as 30 to
[[50]]
 percent per year because there was a
good chance for default, whereas the
interest on loans secured by collateral
might be as low as seven percent. To
some extent, these moneylending mer-
chants were economically bound to
their farmer-creditors, with one provid-
ing the capital and the other providing
the labor. Moneylenders could not
refuse credit to farmers after a bad year,
since this would have removed any hope
of future repayment. For further infor-
mation see Christopher Alan Bayly,
Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars, 1983.
Monday
(Somavar) The second day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is the
moon. The moon is associated with
coolness, healing power, and Soma,
the Vedic deity. The Hindu god Shiva
is manifested as Somnath, the Lord of
the Moon. Monday is considered one
of the most powerful and auspicious
days of the week. Worship on certain
Mondays is believed to bring even
greater religious benefits, such as
on a Somavati Amavasya, (a new
moon falling on a Monday), and on
the Mondays in Shravan (a lunar
month specially dedicated to Shiva).
The Sixteen Mondays Vow (Solah
Somvar Vrat) is performed on sixteen
consecutive Mondays. Like other
such vows, the Solah Somvar Vrat
entails reading the vow’s charter myth
in a ritual setting, combined with
worship and a regulated diet.
[[444]]

Monsoon
A season of torrential rains, whose name
comes from an Arabic word meaning
“season” (mausam). The monsoon is
preceded by a period of intense heat;
daily temperatures go over one hundred
degrees Fahrenheit. As the hot air rises,
it draws in a vast current of moisture-
laden air from the coastal regions of
southern India. The monsoon is one of
the year’s three major seasons and is a
vital part of people’s daily lives. Because
much of India’s farmland is not irrigated,
the monsoon rains are vital to agricul-
ture. The coming of the monsoon is
much awaited in real life; it also has a
prominent place in Indian culture. One
image of the monsoon comes from love
poetry, in which a woman is anxiously
scanning the sky, watching the clouds
roll up as she awaits her returning
beloved. In earlier times the rains made
travel almost impossible, making it a
bitter time for separated lovers but aMudra
sweet and happy time for united couples.
The poet Kalidasa’s epic Meghaduta
describes a man exiled in southern
India, who addresses one of the mon-
soon clouds, giving it a message to con-
vey to his beloved. The monsoon rains
are also associated with the god
Krishna. His dark skin color is com-
pared to a rain cloud. Also, his birthday
is celebrated at the end of the rainy
season, and his divine persona appro-
priates the image of the lover associated
with the rains.
Moon
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
associated with fecundity (fertility),
although its aspect can be either benev-
olent or malevolent—benevolent with
the waxing moon, and malevolent with
the waning moon. During the lunar
month, the full moon is considered the
most auspicious time of all. The new
moon, however, is considered a ritually
ambiguous time, and thus potentially
dangerous. During the week the moon
presides over Monday, generally consid-
ered an auspicious day and one that is
sacred to Shiva as Somnath, the Lord of
the Moon.
Morari Bapu
(b. Muraridas Prabhudas 1946) Modern
commentator and expositor (kathava-
cak) on the Ramcharitmanas. Written
by the poet-saint Tulsidas, the
Ramcharitmanas is a vernacular version
of the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Sanskrit epics. As with all vernac-
ular renditions of the Ramayana,
Tulsidas did not simply translate
Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic, but adapted it to
address his own religious concerns, par-
ticularly the importance of devotion
(bhakti) to God, one of the text’s central
themes. Morari Bapu claims no super-
natural powers or ability; his religious
fame rests solely on his commitment to
the text, and his power in expounding it.
At times he speaks to audiences of more
than 100,000 people, giving katha
(discourse) to the Hindu diaspora pop-
ulations in Europe and North America,
as well as in India.
Mrcchakatika
(“The Little Clay Cart”) Drama written
by the playwright Shudraka, probably in
the early fifth century. The play
describes the flowering of love between
a poor but noble brahmin, Charudatta,
and a wealthy and virtuous courtesan,
Vasantasena, set in the context of a
complicated political intrigue. The play
is noted for its portrayal of everyday
urban life, exemplified by the little
clay cart—a child’s toy. It has been
translated into several languages and is
periodically performed for modern
American audiences.
Mrtyunjaya
(“Conqueror of Death”) Epithet of the
god Shiva. The mythic charter behind
this particular name comes from the
story of the sage Markandeya. Devoted
to Shiva, Markandeya is an intelligent
and religious boy who is proficient in all
branches of learning. His story is
poignant because he is fated to die at
sixteen. When Markandeya learns of
this, shortly before his sixteenth birth-
day, he begins to worship Shiva with
even greater fervor. On the appointed
day, Yama, the god of death, comes to
claim Markandeya. When Yama throws
his noose over Markandeya to draw
out the boy’s soul, it catches the statue
of Shiva to which Markandeya is
clinging. Shiva arises from the image
and kills Yama, saving Markandeya’s
life. Although Shiva relents and restores
Yama to life, this particular form of
Shiva illustrates his power to protect his
devotees (bhakta) from all things,
including death.
Mudra
(“seal”) In Indian dance, theater, and
iconography, a mudra is a stylized hand
gesture that conveys a specific meaning,
ranging from concrete things such as
[[445]]
Mudra
animals, everyday objects, and the
Hindu deities, to abstract things such as
emotions. In the context of the perform-
ing arts, particularly dance, performers
tell detailed stories through gesture
alone. In the context of iconography,
many of these gestures are traits associ-
ated with particular deities. There
is some syntactic overlap between
the terms mudra and hasta (“hand”);
one of the distinctions between them
is that some of the hastas simply
describe the position of the hand, and
others have symbolic meaning, whereas
mudras always have very specific
symbolic meanings.
Mudra
(2) Fermented or parched grain. In the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, fermented grain is the
fourth of the “Five Forbidden Things”
(panchamakara), which, in “left hand”
(vamachara) tantric ritual, are used in
their actual forms, whereas in “right
hand” (dakshinachara) tantric ritual
they are represented by symbolic substi-
tutes. Fermented grain may have intoxi-
cating effects, but it is also reputed to be
an aphrodisiac. “Respectable” Hindu
society strongly condemns the use of
intoxicants and/or sexual license. Thus
the ritual use of this substance must be
seen in the larger tantric context. One of
the most pervasive tantric assumptions
is the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle means that the adept must
reject all concepts based on dualistic
thinking. The “Five Forbidden Things”
provide a ritual means for breaking
down duality. In this ritual the adept
breaks societal norms forbidding
consumption of intoxicants, nonvege-
tarian food, and illicit sexuality in a con-
scious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara), and
is thus superior to common practice. For

Cities, 1990.
Mudrarakshasa
(“Rakshasa’s Ring”) The only surviving
Sanskrit drama written by the
playwright Vishakhadatta, who is
believed to have lived in the sixth
century. The play chronicles the rise of
Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the
Maurya dynasty, and the machinations
of his cunning brahmin minister,
Chanakya. The drama’s plot is highly
complex, as with many Sanskrit plays,
but its climax comes when the principal
characters are dramatically rescued
from execution at the last moment.
Although the play is based on actual
events, historians feel that the portrayal
of Chandragupta Maurya as a weak king
is inaccurate. The play has been trans-
lated into English by Michael Coulson
and published in an anthology titled
Three Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Mueller, F. Max
(1823–1900) Linguist, translator, editor,
and ardent student of comparative
religion and mythology. Mueller was
an important figure in nineteenth-
century intellectual history. His primary
contribution was introducing Indian
ideas to Western audiences by translat-
ing primary texts into the Sacred Books
of the East series. His work allowed
Hindu and other Asian religious
traditions to show the sophisticated
thought often concealed by popular
religious practice. Mueller began
developing a “science of religion”—
a field of knowledge that could be
pursued as any other. As a professor
at Oxford, he helped to change scholarly
views on Hinduism and other Asian
religions, moving Western minds from
simply dismissing them as polytheistic
“idolatry” to taking them seriouslyMuktiyoga
as coherent and compelling pictures of
the world.
Muhurta
In traditional timekeeping, a muhurta is
a period of forty-eight minutes, of which
there are thirty during each day. The
Brahma Muhurta is the most auspi-
cious time period, coming directly
before dawn. The time before the
Brahma Muhurta is considered the least
auspicious in the day. This cycle exem-
plifies a pattern in the Indian view of
time. A period of inauspiciousness is
typically followed by a sudden regenera-
tion of fortune.
Mukhalinga
A form of the linga, the pillar-shaped
object symbolizing the god Shiva. A
mukhalinga has one or more faces
(mukha) sculpted on the shaft of the
linga. According to the manuals detail-
ing the form and construction of Hindu
images, the number of faces on the linga
should not exceed the number of door-
ways in the temple. Thus, a temple with
one doorway should have a mukhalinga
with one face, and so on, up to four. The
manuals also specify that these faces
should be placed facing the entrances.

Iconography, 1981.
Muktananda
(1908–1982) Modern Hindu teacher,
proponent of a religious path named
siddha yoga (“discipline of the adepts”),
and founder of the organization named
SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham America).
Muktananda left his family at age fifteen
to search for spiritual enlightenment.
His spiritual master (guru) was an
ascetic named Nityananda, who was
widely believed to be an avadhuta (a
person who has shaken off all attach-
ments). Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a
modified form of Kashmir Shaivism.
The organization’s signature teaching is
that the guru’s spiritual power can
immediately awaken the disciple’s latent
kundalini, hastening the process of
spiritual development. This doctrine
emphasizes the importance of the guru,
reinforced by Muktananda’s charismatic
presence. Although his home base was
an ashram just outside of Bombay,
Muktananda traveled throughout the
world, establishing ashrams and medi-
tation centers in North America,
Europe, and Australia. He was suc-
ceeded by Swami Chidvilasananda. For
further information on Muktananda’s
teaching, see his autobiography, Play of
Consciousness, 2000.
Muktibai
(1279–1297?) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba, at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Muktibai was the sister of the great
Varkari teacher Jnaneshvar.
Muktinath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) at the
headwaters of the Kali Gandaki River in
Nepal; the temple sits at nearly 13,000
feet at the foot of Annapurna, one of the
highest mountains in Nepal. Muktinath
is a sacred site to both Hindus and
Buddhists; each has a temple there. The
Buddhist temple is built over a vent of
natural gas, which produces a flame
when lit. The Hindu temple, dedicated
to the god Vishnu, is built over a natural
spring that is channelled outside the
temple through 108 spouts shaped like
heads of cows. The Kali Gandaki River is
also religiously important because the
river bed is one of the major sites of fos-
silized black ammonite. Known as the
shalagram, this ammonite is considered
a self-manifestation (svayambhu) form
of Vishnu.
Muktiyoga
In the Dvaita Vedanta philosophical
school propounded by Madhva, a
[[447]]
Muladhara Chakra
A man’s head is shaved in the traditional Hindu practice of mundan.
Removing one’s hair is believed to be purifying.
muktiyoga is a person who is predes-
tined to attain liberation. See also
Dvaita Vedanta.
Muladhara Chakra
In many schools of yoga, and in the
secret ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra, the muladhara chakra
is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) believed to exist in the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system existing on a dif-
ferent plane of reality than matter, but
corresponding to the material body. The
six psychic centers are visualized as
multipetaled lotus flowers running
roughly along the spine, connected by
three vertical channels. Each of the
chakras has symbolic associations with
various human capacities, various sub-
tle elements (tanmatras), and different
seed syllables (bijaksharas) formed
from the letters of the Sanskrit alpha-
bet, encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are the
bodily abodes of Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the two divine principles
[[448]]

through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind the concept of the
subtle body is the homology of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mysti-
cal texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated starting from the bottom; the
muladhara chakra is the first. It is visual-
ized as a four-petaled lotus, located in
the region at the base of the spine. The
petals each contain a seed syllable, in
this case the consonants from “va” to
“sa.” The muladhara chakra is associat-
ed as the bodily seat for the subtle
element of earth, to which excretions
are compared. The muladhara chakra is
also considered the locus for the
kundalini, the latent spiritual energy
present in all human beings, visualized
as a serpent wound three times around
the muladhara chakra. Despite its
associations with the most mundane
element and the most impure bodily
function, the muladhara is also
the source of potential for religious
attainment. For further informationMurari Gupta
see Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Mulamantra
(“root mantra”) A mulamantra is a
sacred sound or sounds (mantra) that
are considered to be the most subtle
form of a deity. Every Hindu deity has a
mulamantra. Different manifestations
of the deity usually have different
mantras, which are associated with
them alone. The mulamantra is usually
considered to be the highest and truest
form of the deity, since it is nothing but
sacred sound.
Munda
A demon general killed by the Goddess
in the Devimahatmya, a Sanskrit text
which is the earliest and most important
mythic source for the cult of the
Goddess. This text describes the
Goddess in several different manifesta-
tions. The seventh book tells how the
goddess Ambika’s anger takes form as
the terrifying goddess Kali. Kali attacks
the demon armies commanded by
Munda and his companion Chanda.
After destroying the armies, Kali
beheads the two generals. As a memorial
of this mythic deed, the Goddess is
worshiped by the name Chamunda, the
slayer of Chanda and Munda.
Mundan
(“shaving”) In general terms, mundan
refers to any type of haircutting or shav-
ing done for religious purposes, such as
the head-shaving traditionally done at
certain pilgrimage places (tirtha). In
Tirupati in southern India, the hair is
given as an offering to the presiding
deity; shaving is also a means of ritual
purification, as in the rites for the dead.
In a more specific sense, mundan is
often used as a synonym for the chu-
dakarana samskara, a life-cycle rite in
which a young child’s head is shaved,
removing the last residual impurities
from birth. See also hair.
Muni
A term of ancient provenance, dating
back to the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious text. In the Vedas this term
is used to denote an ascetic, sage,
or seer, particularly one keeping a
vow of silence.
Murali
In Hindu mythology, murali is the god
Krishna’s flute. As recounted in sectarian
texts such as the Bhagavata Purana, and
countless

devotional
(bhakti) poems, the sound of this flute
has an enticing quality that is irresistible
to Krishna’s devotees (bhakta). When
they hear its melody, they rush to
Krishna’s presence. The flute and its
siren song are seen as an extension of
Krishna’s own enticing presence.
Murals
Sanskrit literature contains numerous
references to mural painting. In early
medieval times, these were common
forms of decorating both temples and
the homes of the wealthy. The heat and
moisture of the Indian climate have not
been kind to such artwork; few exam-
ples remain today. The most famous
murals are at Buddhist sites—Ajanta in
central India and Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.
These murals convey themes about
everyday life. There are also traces of
painting in the caves at Ellora. Paintings
from the Chola era were recently discov-
ered at the Rajrajeshvar temple in
Tanjore; they are being restored. See
also Chola dynasty.
Murari
(“Mura’s enemy”) Epithet of the god
Krishna. Mura is an extremely powerful
demon who conquers all of the gods. He
is eventually killed in battle by Krishna.
See Krishna.
Murari Gupta
(16th c.) Author of the earliest version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
[[449]]
Murti
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account
describing the life of the Bengali saint
Chaitanya (1486–1533). Murari Gupta’s
text focuses on Chaitanya’s early life up
to his southern Indian pilgrimage end-
ing in 1513. The last part of the text
briefly mentions his pilgrimage to
Brindavan in 1514 and his final return
to Puri, where he lived for the rest of his
life. Like the other traditional accounts
of Chaitanya’s life, this does not purport
to be an “objective” biography; it is
rather a hagiography (idealized portrait)
written by a passionate devotee (bhakta).
Nevertheless, Murari Gupta was a con-
temporary and companion of Chaitanya;
his text reflects first-hand experience
and is the most reliable of these tradi-
tional sources.
Murti
(“shape,” “form”) The most common
name for a sculptural image of a Hindu
deity fashioned by human beings, rather
than those that are self-manifested
(svayambhu images) forms of the deity.
Murugan
(“fragrant, beautiful”) Hindu deity pri-
marily worshiped in southern India.
Murugan originally appears in the Tamil
Sangam literature, where he is a hill
deity associated with the hunt and wild,
unsettled places. One of Murugan’s
characteristic objects is the lance, sym-
bolizing the hunt. As brahminical Hindu
culture gradually came to southern
India, Murugan was drawn into the
established pantheon as a form of the
god Skanda, who is the son of the god
Shiva. By the tenth century Murugan’s
identity had evolved as that of a philoso-
pher and exponent of the Shaiva
Siddhanta philosophical school and as
the patron deity of Tamil language and
literature. For southern Indians, espe-
cially in the state of Tamil Nadu, wor-
shiping Murugan becomes a vehicle to
affirm their traditional culture. This has
been particularly true since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947, when the attempt to
[[450]]

impose Hindi as the national language
was seen as northern Indian cultural
imperialism and was met with
incredible resistance. The cult of
Murugan has five major pilgrimage cen-
ters—Palani, Tiruchendur, Tiruttani,
Tirrupparankunram, and Swami Malai.
All of these sites are located in different
parts of Tamil Nadu. This network of
sacred sites (tirthas) is a way in which
the cult of Murugan has come to sym-
bolize Tamil identity. For further infor-
mation see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage
Centers in the Tamil Cultus of
Murukan,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 40, No.1, 1972.
Musala
(“pestle”) A musala is a grinding pestle,
used with a mortar to husk and grind
grain. Miniature versions were used to
grind spices. Aside from its utilitarian
use, the musala’s long, club-like shape
could easily serve as a weapon. It is one
of the characteristic objects in Hindu
iconography, appearing with images of
various deities—the Goddess, Shiva,
and Vishnu.The Illustrated Encyclopedia
