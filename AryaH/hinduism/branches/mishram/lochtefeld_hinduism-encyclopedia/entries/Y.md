Yadava
In Hindu mythology, the tribe from which
the god Krishna is said to have come and
over which he ruled after he gained his
kingdom in the city of Dwaraka. In Indian
history, the Yadava dynasty controlled the
Deccan region in modern Maharashtra
between the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. In northern Indian society, this
is the name of a particular jati, an endog-
amous social subgroup that was orga-
nized (and whose social status was
determined) by the group’s hereditary
occupation. In past generations the
Yadavas had fairly low status, but they
have recently gained much greater politi-
cal power—Mulayam Singh Yadav has
twice been elected chief minister of Uttar
Pradesh and has also served as India’s
minister of Defense; Laloo Prasad Yadav
has been the chief minister of Bihar
(either directly or by proxy through his
wife) throughout the 1990s.
and ritual technicians, who knew how to
perform complex sacrificial rites, but
they were dependent for their livelihood
on the patronage of their sponsors.
Yajna
(“sacrifice”) A fire sacrifice, which was the
primary religious act in the earliest stra-
tum of Indian religion. This cult of sacri-
fice is elaborated in the greatest detail in
the Brahmana literature, in which sacri-
fice is portrayed as the means by which
the universe came into being. The perfor-
mance of sacrifice needed highly trained
priestly technicians (rtvij), who were dif-
ferently responsible for chanting parts of
the Rg, Sama, and Yajur Vedas, as well as
building and maintaining the sacred fire
that was the heart of the sacrificial action.
This cult of sacrifice was essentially based
on burning things in this sacred fire, con-
ceived as the god Agni, so that Agni could
convey the offerings to the other deities.
These rites were so elaborate and expen-
sive that they eventually fell into disuse; by
the turn of the common era, there was
also considerable ambivalence about the
animal sacrifices that were originally an
important part of many of these sacrifices.
These ancient rites are rarely performed
today, but in the present context the word
yajna can be used for any rite involving
the sacred fire, particularly one carried out
by a brahmin for a patron.
Yadunandana
(“joy of the Yadus”) Epithet of the god
Krishna. The Yadus were reckoned as
Krishna’s clan, and thus he was their joy.
See Krishna.
Yajamana
(“patron of the sacrifice”) In the cult of
sacrifice found in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, the yajamana was
the person who commissioned the sac-
rifice and paid for its performance, and
who thus stood to gain its anticipated
benefits. This term draws a crucial dis-
tinction between priest and patron and
points to the relationship between
them—the former were learned men
Yajnavalkya
In the Upanishads, the speculative texts
that form the latest textual stratum in
the Veda, Yajnavalkya is named as a sage
associated with the court of King
Janaka, who was able to show that he
had greater wisdom than the others. He
is also ascribed as the author of the
Yajnavalkya Smrti, one of the texts that
comprise the dharma literature, based
on the pattern of mythic ascription
found in these texts.
Yajnavalkya Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered” texts, a
class of literature deemed important but
[[775]]
Yajnopavit
less authoritative than the other textual
category, the shrutis or “heard” texts. This
smrti is ascribed to the sage Yajnavalkya
and is an example of one of the Dharma
Shastras, which were manuals prescribing
rules for correct human behavior and ideal
social life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras,
which are ascribed to recognizable indi-
viduals, the Dharma Shastras are usually
ascribed to mythic sages, as a strategy to
reinforce the authority of these texts. The
extant text is about a thousand verses,
divided into sections on religious custom
(achara), the administration of justice
(vyavahara), and expiation (praya-
shchitta). Estimates on its date of compo-
sition range from the first to the sixth
century, but it is clearly later than the
Manu Smrti because some parts of the
middle section are far more developed.
The Yajnavalkya Smrti was the subject of
numerous commentaries, one of which,
the Mitakshara, was given the status of a
legal code for the greater part of India dur-
ing the British empire.
Yajnopavit
Another name for the sacred thread. See
sacred thread.
Yajur Veda
Traditionally, the third of the four Vedas.
As with the Rg Veda and the Sama Veda,
the Yajur Veda was associated with sacri-
ficial rituals, and the text itself consists
mainly of the mantras to be uttered
while the sacrifice was being carried
out. The Yajur Veda exists in five major
recensions, of which four are “black”
and one is “white.” Their differences
stem from the placement of explanatory
notes on the mantras and their signifi-
cance: The recensions of the Black Yajur
Veda contain these notes in the text
itself, whereas the White Yajur Veda
gathers these notes into an appendix
known as a Brahmana—namely, the
Shatapatha Brahmana—and this
Brahmana literature becomes the next
major stratum of Vedic texts.
[[776]]

Yaksha
(feminine yakshi) A class of minor
deities who are essentially nature spirits
and are often narrowly associated with
particular places. Yakshas are reckoned
as the attendants of the deity Kubera,
who is regarded as the guardian of the
northern direction and the lord of
wealth. The yakshas are generally
regarded as beneficent toward human
beings, and because of their associa-
tions with the generative power of
nature and with Kubera’s wealth, they
are often regarded as bestowing wealth
and fertility. Yakshas have a long history
of appearances in Indian sectarian liter-
ature, where they are either portrayed as
guardian spirits or as examples of
depravity. Although it is fairly old, the
only extensive monograph on yakshas is
Ananda Coomaraswamy, Yaksas, 1971.
Yama
God of death and Death personified. Yama
is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions, associated with the southern
direction, and for this reason, the south is
considered an inauspicious direction.
Yama first appears in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, where he is
described as the first mortal. By virtue of
being the first person to suffer death, he
was seen as presiding over the World of the
Fathers, where the virtuous dead feasted
and enjoyed themselves (much as they
had on earth). As the tradition developed,
conceptions of Yama shifted in turn, until
he was considered the judge of the dead,
ruling mainly over the regions of punish-
ment, primarily hells, in which people suf-
fered until they were reborn. Yama is often
portrayed holding a noose, with which he
draws out the person’s spirit at the time of
death and leads it bound to judgment.
Modern poster images of Yama show him
seated on a throne as king of the dead,
majestic and dark in color; to his left sits
the scribe Chitragupta, who keeps a ledger
book recording the actions of human
beings. Yama’s role as the judge of the dead
makes him greatly feared in everyday
Hindu life. Ideally, this fear can have a pos-Yamuna River

itive outcome—reinforcing people’s incli-
nation to abstain from evil—and one of the
names for Yama is Dharmaraja, the “Lord
of Righteous Action.” Hindu mythology
also has tales of people who somehow
manage to outsmart Yama, of whom the
best known is Savitri, who manages to gain
back the life of her husband, Satyavan.
Yama
(2) In the ashtanga (“eight-part”) yoga first
codified by Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), yama
(“restraint”) is the first and most basic of
the eight constituent elements of yoga
practice. Patanjali lists these as five:
abstaining from harm to other living
things (ahimsa), abstaining from theft,
truthfulness, celibacy (brahmacharya),
and abstaining from avarice. These can all
be characterized as “restraints” because
their intent is negative—they do not call
for positive actions as much as they entail
refraining from certain thoughts or actions
deemed especially injurious.
Yamunacharya
(10th c.) According to tradition, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, who is
claimed to be the grandson of Nathamuni,
and the teacher of Ramanuja. Nathamuni
was the compiler of the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, the collected hymns
of the Alvars, a group of poet-saints who
lived in southern India between the sev-
enth and the tenth centuries. All the Alvars
were devotees of Vishnu, and they
expressed this devotion in passionate
hymns sung in the Tamil language; among
southern Indian Vaishnavas (devotees of
Vishnu), these hymns are so holy that they
are referred to as the “Tamil Veda.”
Ramanuja, on the other hand, was a
philosopher who organized and system-
atized this devotional outpouring into a
coherent philosophical position and thus
is considered the founder of the
Shrivaishnava religious community.
It is generally believed that Yamuna-
charya was Nathamuni’s grandson, and
thus he was heir to the religious tradi-
tion his grandfather had helped create.
There is much more doubt about the
claim that he was Ramanuja’s religious
preceptor (guru) because it seems more
likely that Yamuna’s influence on
Ramanuja was transmitted by Yamuna’s
disciples. Still, what is indisputable is
that these three are the three main fig-
ures in the development of the Shri-
vaishnava tradition, and thus that
Yamunacharya occupies a pivotal spot.
Yamuna River
Northern Indian river rising at Yamu-
notri in the Himalayas, and flowing
[[777]]
Yamunotri
west and south of the Ganges River,
which the Yamuna finally joins at
Allahabad in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. The Yamuna is traditionally
considered one of the seven sacred
rivers of India, along with the Ganges,
Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada,
Indus, and Cauvery. The Yamuna
flows through the Braj region south of
Delhi, which is traditionally associat-
ed as the homeland of Krishna, and
his devotees (bhakta) revere it even
more than the Ganges. For his devo-
tees, places throughout the Braj
region carry strong associations
with the life of Krishna, but the most
important sites are at Mathura
and Brindavan.
Yamunotri
Sacred site (tirtha) in the Himalayas
at the headwaters of the Yamuna
River. Ritually speaking, Yamunotri is
considered to be the source of the
Yamuna, although the actual source
lies farther upstream, at the foot of the
Bandarpunch Mountain. Its high alti-
tude also means that it is only accessi-
ble between late April and October,
after which it is closed for the winter
months—a
pattern
echoed
at
Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath,
the other three major Himalayan pil-
grim sites. One ritual center in
Yamunotri is the river itself, in which
pilgrims bathe (snana), braving the
frigid waters. There are also several
temples—the oldest built by one of
the kings of Nepal—but the temples at
Yamunotri are quite modest com-
pared with those at Gangotri, and the
only large one was built in the 1980s.
Aside from the holy river and its tem-
ples, Yamunotri is also noted for sev-
eral hot springs from which water
emerges almost boiling; some of these
hot springs have been channeled into
a tank, and many pilgrims take advan-
tage of the hot baths.
[[778]]

Yantra
(“instrument”) In astrology (jyotisha),
and in tantra, a secret, ritually based
religious practice, the word yantra
most commonly refers to a symbolic
diagram, often believed to confer
magic or spiritual power on those
who know how to use it. In some cases
such yantras are considered to be an
aniconic form of a deity, as is the case
of the most famous yantra, the
Shriyantra or Shrichakra, which is
used in ritual for the worship of the
goddess Tripura Sundari. The most lit-
eral meaning of the word is “device for
restraining,” and in an astrological
setting the yantras of the various
planets are used in rituals to change
their effects, usually to restrain or
diminish the power of planets judged
to be malefic or inauspicious.
Yashoda
In Hindu mythology, the god
Krishna’s foster mother, who receives
him on the night he is born, and cares
for him until he is old enough to
return to Mathura to claim his throne.
Yashoda is a paradigm for selfless
devotion, who loves Krishna as if he is
her own biological child. Her mythic
example of loving, motherly care has
provided the model for vatsalya
bhava, one of the five modes of devo-
tion most prominently articulated by
Rupa Goswami, a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Krishna and a follower of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya. In the vat-
salya mode of devotion, devotees con-
sider themselves as God’s parents,
lavishing love and care on the deity as
a cow cares for her calf.
Yaska
(5th c. B.C.E.?) Traditionally cited as
the author of the Nirukta, a text giv-
ing etymological explanations for
archaic words in the Veda. Almost a
quarter of the words in the Veda
appear only once. Even by Yaska’sYatra
A yantra is a symbolic diagram often believed to confer
magic or spiritual power on those who know how to use it.
time, the meanings for many of these
words had become either uncertain or
completely lost, as the spoken lan-
guage had changed. Although at times
it is clear that Yaska himself is guess-
ing—as when modern linguists
can make comparisons to the Iranian
Avesta, a related sacred text—his
work was immeasurably helpful to
later readers.
Yathakhyati
(“discrimination [of things] as they are”)
Another name for the theory of error
known as satkhyati. See satkhyati.
Yati
(from Sanskrit yam, “to restrain”) From
the time of the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious texts, the word yati has been
one of the terms used to designate an
ascetic, as someone who had gained
control over himself. At the time of the
Vedas there seems to be some ambiva-
lence for the yatis, since the storm-god
Indra is said to have fought with them,
but in later times the word takes on an
unequivocally positive connotation.
Yatra
(“journey”) Although in its literal mean-
ing the word yatra can refer to any sort
of travel, in modern Hindi its semantic
field is considerably narrower and con-
notes travel with some serious purpose,
rather than a stroll around the block or
a sightseeing trip. The word yatra’s
most important connotation is travel
for religious purposes, particularly pil-
grimage to the sacred sites (tirthas). A
yatra is thus a journey, but a particular
type of journey.
[[779]]
Yatri
Yatri
In an ascetic context, the word yatri
denotes a novitiate Bairagi, a renun-
ciant ascetic community comprising
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu. As
an everyday word it means a person per-
forming a yatra (“journey”; more specif-
ically, a trip with the significance of a
religious pilgrimage).
Yayati
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Nahusha and a king in the lunar dynasty.
Year, Structure of
The Hindu ritual year is determined
according to both a solar calendar and a
lunar calendar. Aside from the Gregorian
calendar and the common era, there are
two indigenous Hindu calculations of
the solar year, both of which have twelve
solar months. In northern India these
months correspond to the twelve signs
of the zodiac, and the months change as
the sun moves through them. As in the
Western zodiac, the year begins when
the sun enters Aries, although according
to Indian astrology this transition takes
place around April 14, rather than
March 21, as figured in Euro-American
astrology. In southern India there is an
identical solar calendar, whose names
are drawn from the names of certain
nakshatras or lunar asterisms. Aside
from the solar months, the solar year is
also divided into halves based on the
movement of the sun: the Uttarayana
for the period when the sun is moving
north, and the Dakshinayana in the
time the sun is moving south. The sun
begins its northward journey, consid-
ered the more auspicious time, on
Makara Sankranti, reckoned as falling
on January 14; it begins its southward
journey six months later on Karka
Sankranti on July 14.
Far more important for religious
purposes is the lunar calendar, which
has twelve lunar months: Chaitra
(March–April), Baisakh (April–May),
Jyeshth (May–June), Ashadh (June–July),
[[780]]

Shravan ( July–August), Bhadrapada
(August–September), Ashvin (September–
October), Kartik (October–November),
Margashirsha (November–December),
Paush (December–January), Magh (January–
February), and Phalgun (February–
March). In northern India, the calendar
usually begins in the first day of the
bright half of Chaitra, meaning that the
last days of the year are those in the
dark half of this same month.
Since these lunar months are based on
the phases of the moon (ending with the
full moon in northern India and the new
moon in southern India), the festivals
determined by this lunar calendar fall at
different times each year with respect to
the solar calendar. This is because the
twelve lunar months are completed in
about 354 solar days, and thus, each lunar
year begins eleven days earlier than the
last. About every 21⁄2 years this discrepancy
is corrected by the addition of an extra
lunar month, known as the intercalary
month, through which the solar and lunar
calendars are kept in general correspon-
dence. The intercalary month is added to
any lunar month in which the sun does
not enter a new sign of the zodiac and can
thus fall in any month of the year. In this
way, although the solar calendar is less
important in everyday life, it helps main-
tain the general correspondence between
the lunar calendar and the seasonal festi-
vals associated with that calendar.
At least in northern India, the three
major seasons (hot, monsoon, and cool)
have important links with the festival
calendar. In general, the most ritually
active time is the cool season between
October and February; in many places
this is also the time following the
harvest, when many people have more
time and money to spend on religious
observances. The hot season has many
rites associated with heat, whereas the
rainy season, as a time of peril, is often
connected with rites of protection.
Yellamma
Presiding goddess of the shrine on
Yellama hill, in the town of Saundatti inYoga
the Belgaum district of the state of
Karnataka. Yellama’s temple is infa-
mous for being a traditional center for
the dedication of devadasis (“[female]
servant of the Lord”), a class of women
kept in temples as singers and dancers
in the service of the temple’s presiding
deity and to whom they were usually
considered to be “married.” In Yellama’s
temple, however, both boys and girls can
be dedicated. Although for the past two
centuries the devadasi tradition has car-
ried associations with common prosti-
tution, in earlier times it was far more
common for a devadasi to live with a
single man for her entire life, although
she could not marry him because she
was considered dedicated to the deity.
At times this dedication is done
because of a demand by the goddess
herself, revealed through possession; in
other cases the parents do this, hoping
to gain some concrete benefit, particu-
larly healing from disease. Yellamma is
associated with fire and also with caus-
ing (and potentially curing) skin dis-
eases, which can be seen as symbolic
“burning.”
According to the traditional model,
devadasis held a definite social position
and had special legal rights—they were
entitled to family inheritance and to
perform religious rites, which other
women were not. These special rights
have disappeared with the outlawing of
the devadasi system, done, in part, by
the British, and definitively in post-
Independence India. Although such
dedications still take place, in many
cases they are little more than a cover for
procurement, with the girls being
shipped to brothels in Bombay, Pune,
and other central Indian cities. In most
cases the girls come from extremely
poor families, and the dedication to
Yellamma is a way to avoid paying for a
wedding, a major expense in contempo-
rary Indian society. The dedications take
place on the full moon in the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February),
and are reportedly widespread, but
because of secrecy, the laws prohibit-
ing this are rarely enforced. For further
consideration of the devadasi system, in
this case at the Jagannath temple in
Puri, see Frederique Apffel Marglin,
Wives of the God-King, 1985.
Yoga
The literal meaning of the word yoga is
“the act of joining,” and it is cognate
with the English word “yoke.” Just as the
latter word can serve as either a verb or
a noun—either the act of yoking, or the
thing to which animals are yoked—in
the same way the word yoga can refer
both to the act or process of spiritual
development and also to a specific set of
teachings fostering this development.
Both these meanings can be conveyed
by the word “discipline,” and this is one
of the preferred translations.
There are many specific teachings
styling themselves as yogas. The oldest
one is laid out in the Yoga Sutras attrib-
uted to the sage Patanjali; this system is
known as ashtanga (“eight-limbed”)
yoga, because of its eight constituent
parts. Other well-known yogas are the
three “paths” described by the god
Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, an
important religious text: the yogas of
action (karma), wisdom (jnana), and
devotion (bhakti). Another well-known
yoga is kundalini yoga, the practice of
which is entirely internal, in the alter-
nate physiological system known as the
subtle body. Kundalini yoga stresses
awakening the kundalini, the latent
spiritual power that exists in every per-
son, and through this gaining spiritual
benefits. These make up the main cate-
gories of teachings, but the members of
many particular religious communities
will describe their religious practice
as yoga: Thus there is the surat-shabd-
yoga of the Radha Soamis, the Raja
Yoga of the Brahma Kumaris, or the
Siddha Yoga of the SYDA Foundation.
In such cases the word is used to
identify a particular religious group’s
characteristic teaching, which usually
includes elements from the classical
articulations of yoga.
[[781]]
Yoga Mudra
Yoga Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the right hand is
placed flat on the left, with both palms
pointing up, and the joined hands are
laid on the crossed legs. In a sculptural
image, this mudra indicates that the fig-
ure is adept in yoga.
Yogananda, Paramahamsa
(b. Mukunda Lal Ghosh 1893–1952)
Modern Hindu teacher and founder of
the Self-Realization Fellowship. Yoga-
nanda was one of the earliest Hindu
missionaries to come to America. He
came to Boston in 1920, to address the
International Congress of Religious
Liberals in Boston and never returned
to India. He eventually settled outside
Los Angeles, where he established a
center and lived for the rest of his life. In
his early years in America he was con-
sidered something of a curiosity, and
there are photos of him taken with
President Calvin Coolidge. Yogananda’s
teachings were largely based in the ash-
tanga yoga of the classical Yoga Sutras,
but he also stressed the doctrine of kriya
(“active”) yoga, which is claimed to
accelerate spiritual attainment. Most of
Yogananda’s disciples and both his suc-
cessors were Americans, and the Self-
Realization Fellowship is essentially an
American organization with historical
roots in India. For further information
see Paramahansa Yogananda’s Auto-
biography of a Yogi, 1997.
Yoganidra
(“sleep of yoga”) Epithet of the Goddess
in the first episode of the Devi-
mahatmya, the earliest and most author-
itative text for the mythology of the
Goddess. In this episode, the Goddess
has lulled Vishnu into a stupor through
her power of illusion, making him
oblivious to Brahma’s cries for help
when he is menaced by the demons
Madhu and Kaitabha. Brahma is saved
when he praises the Goddess, after
[[782]]

which she withdraws her yogic sleep
from Vishnu; he then regains con-
sciousness and rescues Brahma by
killing the demons.
Yoga Sutras
(“aphorisms on yoga”) A set of brief say-
ings traditionally ascribed to the sage
Patanjali, which are the foundational
texts for the Yoga school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are usually
read with a commentary ascribed to the
sage Vyasa, and this commentary has
become accepted as an integral part of
the text. The text of the Yoga Sutras is
divided into four parts, with each part
devoted to a particular theme: The first
part focuses on concentration (samadhi),
the second part on the mechanics of
spiritual development (sadhana), the
third part treats various attainments
(vibhuti), including magic powers (sid-
dhi), and the last part describes the state
of yogic isolation (kaivalya), which the
text describes as liberation. The text pre-
supposes the cosmology taught by the
Samkhya school, another of the six
schools, and the Yoga school is often
considered the “practical” articulation
of Samkhya theory.
Yogi
Literally meaning “one possessing
yoga,” in practice the word refers only to
a yogic adept—someone who “possesses”
yoga in the sense of having mastered
it—rather than to anyone simply prac-
ticing yoga. True yogis are widely
believed to have superhuman powers
(siddhi) as a by-product of their long
spiritual development, which they can
and will exercise for the benefit of their
disciples—for physical healing of dis-
eases, for psychological help, or for giv-
ing guidance on both spiritual and
mundane matters. The yogi is seen as a
spiritually realized person, and their
authority stems completely from this
attribution, which paradoxically is not
subject to any sort of external verification.Yogmaya
Consequently, there are significant dif-
ferences of opinion on whether or not
any particular person is a yogi.
Yogi Bhajan
(b. Harbhajan Singh Puri, 1927) Modern
Hindu missionary and founder of the
[[3]]
HO/Sikh Dharma Brotherhood. He
first came to the United States in 1969,
leaving behind his position as a customs
official at the Delhi airport. His initial
teachings were the traditional disci-
plines of hatha yoga and kundalini
yoga, with his followers organized into a
group known as the “Happy, Healthy,
Holy Organization” (3HO). Hatha yoga is
a system of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas; this practice is widely
believed to provide various physical
benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Kundalini yoga is a religious
discipline, the primary focus of which is
awakening the kundalini, the latent
spiritual force that exists in every person
in the subtle body. The kundalini is
awakened through a combination of
yoga practice and ritual action and is
believed to bring further spiritual capac-
ities and ultimately final liberation
(moksha) of the soul.
These two disciplines remain an
important part of Yogi Bhajan’s teach-
ings, for he claims to be a master of
tantra, a secret, ritually based religious
practice, but in the 1970s his teaching
widened to include traditional Sikh
teachings and symbols. The most
prominent of these symbols are the “five
Ks” that all Sikhs are supposed to wear,
so called because each of them begins
with the letter k: uncut hair (kesh), a
comb (kangha), a bangle on the right
wrist (kara), shorts (kacch), and a cere-
monial sword (kirpan). Many of Yogi
Bhajan’s followers keep the Sikh symbols
far more strictly than most people born
as Sikhs, but the movement has two
important divergences with the tradi-
tional Sikh community. One of these is
its emphasis on tantra, which has little
importance in the Sikh community. The
most significant difference, however, is
the religious authority that Yogi Bhajan
holds over his followers, which is very
different from the decentralized, essen-
tially democratic form of the traditional
Sikh community.
Yogini Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Ashadh ( June–July). As for all the
eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu,
particularly in his form as Narayana.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites, which usually involve
fasting (upavasa) and worship and
often promise specific benefits for
faithful performance. On this day the
prescribed action is to give gifts to
poor brahmins; faithfully observing this
festival washes away the sin of cutting
down a pipal tree (ashvattha) and also
brings one birth in heaven.
Yogmaya
Powerful form of the Goddess, particu-
larly noted for her power to bewitch and
bewilder people—in other words, her
ability to wield maya, the power of illu-
sion. In some modern sources Yogmaya
is named as the deity who takes the
form of the infant girl exchanged for the
infant god Krishna and is later killed
by Krishna’s wicked uncle, Kamsa.
According to these sources, it is under
her spell the previous night that all the
inhabitants of Kamsa’s palace fall asleep,
and Krishna’s father, Vasudeva, is able to
spirit the infant away. Later in Krishna’s
career, Yogmaya is believed to facilitate
his clandestine meetings with the
women of Braj—when Krishna plays his
flute, the women come to him, but all
the others fall into the spell cast by
Yogmaya and are unaware of their
absence. Because of her ability to wield
maya, Yogmaya is a powerful deity; she
is worshiped on the fourth day of the fall
[[783]]
Yoni
Navaratri, the festival of the “nine
nights” that are sacred to the Goddess in
her varying forms.
Yoni
Although in modern Hindi this has
become a vulgar word for female
genitalia, its most literal meaning is
“womb,” both in a literal sense as the
place of gestation and in a metaphorical

Yudhishthira
(“firm in battle”) In the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics,
Yudhishthira is the eldest of the
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. Yudhishthira is magically
born when his mother, Kunti, uses a
powerful mantra to have a son by
Dharma, the god of righteousness.
Yudhishthira is in all ways his father’s
son; he is described in the epic as the
manifestation of Dharma on earth. He
is proverbial for his strict adherence to
the truth, is courteous to all, and is
committed to righteousness. His only
personal flaw is a love of gambling, a
love matched only by his complete lack
of gaming skill, and this flaw has major
repercussions.
Because of his virtues, Yudhishthira
is selected as heir to the throne by his
uncle, Dhrtarashtra. This choice raises
the jealousy of Dhrtarashtra’s son,
Duryodhana. He first tries to kill the
Pandavas by building the flammable
house of lac. The house is burned, but
the Pandavas are able to escape
unharmed. Some time later, Duryodhana
decides to win Yudhishthira’s rights to
the kingship in a game of dice. Here
Yudhishthira’s love for gambling gets the
better of his judgment, for he is playing
against Duryodhana’s maternal uncle,
Shakuni, who is very skilled. As Yud-
hishthira begins to lose, he keeps betting
bigger and bigger stakes, in an effort to
win back what he has lost. After losing
their kingdom and all their posses-

sions, Yudhishthira wagers himself and
his brothers. After losing this bet, he
wagers and loses the Pandava brothers’
common wife, Draupadi. This loss
leads to Draupadi’s humiliation, in
which she is paraded through the
assembly hall by Duryodhana and his
brother, Duhshasana, her clothes
stained with her menstrual blood. This
event sharpens the already strong enmi-
ties between the two groups. Shocked at
such treatment, Duryodhana’s father,
King Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas
back their freedom, but because of the
loss in the game of dice, the Pandavas
agree to go into exile for twelve years
and live incognito for the thirteenth,
with the condition that if they are
discovered in the thirteenth year the
cycle will begin anew.
Yudhishthira and his brothers peace-
fully pass their twelve years in exile.
During the thirteenth year, they live in the
court of King Virata, where they remain
undiscovered, despite frantic searching
by Duryodhana’s spies. When the thir-
teen years have passed, Yudhishthira and
his brothers return to claim their part of
the kingdom. Yudhishthira hopes for
some sort of peaceful settlement and
sends a message to Duryodhana saying
that they will be satisfied with a mere five
villages, one for each brother. When
Duryodhana responds that they will not
get as much land as could fit under the
point of a needle, Yudhishthira realizes
that they will not get their rights without
a battle. He reluctantly mobilizes his
brothers for war. He fights valiantly in
the great war and is crowned the king
after their victory.
After ruling for many years,
Yudhishthira sets out with his brothers
and their wife, Draupadi, for the
Himalayas, followed by a small dog. As
they climb the mountains Draupadi and
his brothers die one by one, but the dog
remains with Yudhishthira. At the top of
the Himalayas Yudhishthira finds the
god Indra, the king of heaven, waiting
for him in a golden chariot. Indra tells
Yudhishthira that he will take him to
heaven but that Yudhishthira will haveYuga
to leave the dog behind. Yudhishthira
flatly refuses to abandon his faithful
companion, even if it means that he will
not go to heaven. The dog then reveals
himself to be the god Dharma in dis-
guise. The lesson in this story is that
throughout his life Yudhishthira never
allows himself to stray far from right-
eousness; even at the end he refuses to
forsake it.
Yuga
A name denoting a unit of cosmic time,
with two possible meanings. According
to traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with the active phase known as
the Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
the Night of Brahma. In cosmic time,
the Day of Brahma is divided into one
thousand mahayugas (“great cosmic
ages”), each of which lasts for 4.32
million years, and this is one possible
meaning of the word yuga. The more
common use is to refer to a mahayuga’s
four constituent yugas, named the Krta
Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and
Kali Yuga.
