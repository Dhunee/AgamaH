Sacred Ash
Substance used in rituals and by devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva to mark
their bodies, in imitation of their patron
deity. The name given to this ash is vib-
huti. See vibhuti.
Sacred Sites
Sabarmati
Northern Indian river that rises in the
Aravalli Hills in the state of Rajasthan,
and flows south to the Gulf of Cambay in
the state of Gujarat. It is best known as
the site of the Sabarmati Ashram, across
the river from the city of Ahmedabad in
Gujarat. The Sabarmati Ashram was
home to Mohandas K. Gandhi for six-
teen years after he returned from South
Africa in 1915. He organized much of
the struggle for Indian independence
from this ashram.
Sacchidananda
Sanskrit compound word denoting the
three generally accepted attributes of
the supreme Brahman (the Ultimate
Reality of the universe according to
some Hindu traditions): being (sat),
consciousness (chit), and bliss (ananda).
The differences between the form of the
individual words and their form in the
compound are the result of sandhi or
euphonic combination.
In certain Hindu philosophical tradi-
tions, but particularly in the Advaita
Vedanta school, the supreme Brahman
is considered the Ultimate Reality
behind all things. Although Brahman is
considered to be without particular
qualities, these three attributes are
believed to be inseparable from its very
nature. It has the attribute of being,
because it is the reality from which all
other “being” comes. In the same way, it
is consciousness, as the source of all
conscious thought. Finally, bliss pro-
ceeds from its perfection, which is ulti-
mate and complete.
[[578]]

Hindu religious life is intimately con-
nected to the land of India itself, which
is studded with sacred sites, known as
tirthas. These can be lakes, rivers,
mountains, or any other natural feature;
they can also be cities, temples, or any
other created environment; they can
even be the presence of holy men and
women. Pilgrimage (tirthayatra) to any
sacred site is a means of spiritual and
religious advancement. See tirtha.
Sacred Thread
A circular cord made of three strands (in
which each strand itself has three
strands), which is worn over the left
shoulder, crossing the body to fall on the
right hip. The sacred thread is given to a
boy as part of the upanayana samskara,
which is the adolescent religious initia-
tion also known as the “second birth.”
Second birth entitles a boy to study the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
In the dharma literature this initiatory
rite is prescribed for all young men
belonging to the three “twice-born”
social groups (varnas)—that is, the
brahmins, kshatriyas, and vaishyas.
The sacred thread would have been the
most visible sign of a twice-born man,
for whom wearing the thread was
mandatory, since any religious acts per-
formed without wearing it were said to
be ineffective.
In modern times its presence gener-
ally means that the wearer is a brahmin,
since it is mainly the brahmins who
carry out this rite today. The sacred
thread is worn for extended periods of
time, although it must be changed at
certain times: after the wearer has suf-
fered violent impurity (ashaucha), such
as that of death; after performing anySadashiva
rite of expiation (prayashchitta); and
after eclipses or other highly inauspi-
cious times. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane, A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The
former is encyclopedic and the latter
more accessible; despite their age, they
remain the best sources on traditional
Hindu rites.
Sacrifice
Generally a rite involving a sacred fire
and, often, an offering in that fire. This
sort of ritual is rooted in the oldest part
of the Hindu tradition, although it has
undergone some profound changes,
particularly in the decline of animal sac-
rifice. This sort of sacrificial rite is
known as a yajna.
Sadachara
(“practice of good [people]”) One of the
traditional sources for determining reli-
gious duty (dharma) for matters not
treated in the dharma literature, or for
cases in which the literature itself gave
conflicting opinions. This was the least
authoritative source of dharma, after the
Vedas (the oldest Hindu scriptures) and
the dharma literature. Sadachara recog-
nizes that life has many ambiguities and
uncertainties, and at the same time pro-
vides a resource for determining the
appropriate action, by taking as a model
the practice of established and upright
people. Another term to designate this
sort of authority was shishtachara, the
“practice of learned [people].”
Sadasatkhyati
(“discrimination of the unreal as the
real”) Theory of error propounded by
the Samkhya philosophical school. All
theories of error attempt to explain why
people make errors in judgment, the
stock example being of mistaking the
silvery flash of a sea shell for a piece of
silver. The Samkhya theory of error is
based on dualistic metaphysics, in
which the fundamental error comes in
confusing purusha and prakrti—
roughly, spirit and nature—which are
the sources of all things. These are the
two Samkhya first principles—purusha
as conscious witness, and prakrti as
insentient matter—which are always
separate from each other, and whose
attributes can never coincide. For the
Samkhyas, the fundamental error is to
confuse these two completely different
principles—that is, to attribute powers
of motion and development to purusha,
and consciousness to prakrti. Purusha is
conceived as conscious, but completely
inactive and unchanging. It is the pas-
sive witness to the myriad transforma-
tions of prakrti going on around it.
This initial misidentification causes
the evolution of the entire world, both
the interior, subjective world and the
exterior world the subject perceives.
Against this background, confusing the
shell for silver is just an extension of this
original mistake and is rooted in it.
According to the Samkhyas, perfect
knowledge would protect one from all
sorts of errors, both cosmic and mun-
dane. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Sadashiva
In certain schools of tantra practice,
particularly in the Trika school of
Kashmiri Shaivism, the name for the
first step in the evolution of the cos-
mos. According to the Trika school, the
Ultimate Reality, conceived as Shiva, is
utterly nondual, and thus neither mas-
culine nor feminine. The first step in
cosmological evolution comes when
the divine consciousness becomes
conscious of itself through the reflec-
tion (vimarsha) of its original illumi-
nation (prakasha). Moved by this self-
consciousness, the unqualified divine
being transforms itself into a divine
being containing a masculine and femi-
nine nature, the first of many such bipolar
dyads from which the universe is born.
The masculine part of this first dyad is
Sadashiva, which is considered the
[[579]]
Sadhana
A man smokes from a chillum wrapped with a safai, a cloth used to cool the smoke before it is inhaled.
material cause of the universe. The
energy for creation comes from the
creative and dynamic power of the
dyad’s female principle, Shakti. For fur-
ther information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Sadhana
(“accomplishing”) The most common
colloquial Hindu term designating
established and regular religious prac-
tice. It is given this name because it
is through such practice that one
gains spiritual attainments. In modern
Hindi, the word can also be used to
refer to anything to which one has
devoted a great deal of time, attention,
and hard work.
[[580]]

is to fulfill one’s own dharma (svadharma),
which may supersede or even contradict
the requirements of the common dhar-
ma. For instance, it is generally accepted
that a king must occasionally disregard
truth to be an effective ruler. Since a
king’s primary duty is to maintain peace
and order in the country, so that other
people have the opportunity to do their
duties, he is required to do whatever it
takes to accomplish this.
Sadhu
(“virtuous man”) A general term that can
be used for any ascetic, although it more
often refers to an ascetic who has not
undergone formal initiation into an
established ascetic order.
Sadharana (“common”) DharmaSadhubela
In the dharma literature, the religious
duties required of all human beings,
including truth, generosity, and compas-
sion. One’s essential obligation, however,In the time before the partition of
India in 1947, Sadhubela was the name
of the most important ascetic center
for the Udasi ascetics; it was in SukkurSagara Dashanami
in the province of Sindh province, now
in Pakistan.
Sadhya
(“to be proved”) Element in the accept-
ed form of an inference (anumana) in
Indian philosophy. An acceptable infer-
ence has three terms: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three has
its own constituent parts. The sadhya is,
along with the paksha, one of the two
parts of the assertion. The paksha is the
subject of the hypothesis and names a
class of things, while the sadhya con-
tains the claim to be proven about that
class. In the standard example, in which
the hypothesis is “this mountain is on
fire,” the paksha is “this mountain” (the
class of things about which a claim is
being made); and the sadhya, or thing to
be proven, is “is on fire.”
Safai
Small cloth wrapped around the base of
a chillum, a clay cylinder used for smok-
ing a mixture of tobacco and hashish
(charas). The safai serves two purposes,
one ritual and one physical. On one
hand, it forms a barrier intended to pre-
vent passing the ritual impurity
(ashaucha) carried by saliva when the
chillum is being passed from person to
person. Ascetics who are very conscious
of purity or status will often wrap their
own safai around the base of the chillum
before smoking. Aside from helping to
protect personal purity, the safai also
serves a practical purpose–it is usually
dipped in water before being wrapped
around the chillum, which serves to cool
and mellow the smoke being drawn
through it.
Sagar
In Hindu mythology, a celebrated king
of the Solar Line. Sagar, the son of King
Subahu and his wife Yadavi, gets his
name because one of Yadavi’s co-wives
has given her poison (gara) while she is
pregnant with him. Sagar has a very
hard early life. His father is driven from
his kingdom even before he is born, and
Sagar is raised at the ashram of the sage
Aurva, where his mother has taken asy-
lum. When he comes to maturity Sagar
embarks on a series of military cam-
paigns in which he wins back all the
lands his father lost, and becomes a
righteous and religious king whose only
concern is his lack of progeny.
To beget sons, Sagar calls on the sage
Bhrgu, who gives Sagar’s two wives a
choice: one wife will bear 60,000 sons
who will all die childless, and one wife
will bear one son who will carry on the
line. Each of his wives chooses, and in
due course both have their children—
Keshini delivers her one son in the nor-
mal way, whereas Sumati delivers a
lump of flesh that is divided and put into
[[60]]
,000 pots, each of which develops into
a handsome son.
In his prosperity King Sagar contin-
ues to sponsor religious rites, and is on
the verge of completing his hundredth
horse sacrifice (asvamedha), which will
entitle him to the throne of Indra, the
god who is the king of heaven. To fore-
stall this, Indra steals the sacred horse
and hides it in the ashram of the sage
Kapila. Sagar sends his 60,000 sons
to search for the horse, but they make
the mistake of insulting the sage, who
burns them all to ash through his
yogic powers. To rescue their souls it
is necessary to bring down the Ganges
from heaven, a job that Sagar’s descen-
dants diligently attempt to complete.
After several generations of frustration,
his great-great-grandson Bhagirath is
finally successful.
Sagara Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva.
The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century philo-
sopher Shankaracharya in an effort
create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
[[581]]
Saguna
different name—in this case, sagara
(“ocean”). Upon initiation, new mem-
bers are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in
one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Sagara
Dashanamis belong to the Anandawara
group, which is affiliated with the Jyotir
math in the Himalayan town of
Joshimath.
Saguna
(“with qualities”) Anything having dis-
tinguishing qualities. In the context of
ideas about divinity it refers to particu-
lar deities with particular attributes. In
the religious traditions based on the
ideas of the Upanishads, the speculative
texts that are the final texts in the Vedas,
any manifestation of a deity with quali-
ties is seen as ultimately inferior to the
unqualified (nirguna) Brahman. This
assumption is adamantly opposed by
certain theistic traditions, such as the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community,
which insists that the highest deity, in
this case Krishna, has a particular form
(and thus certain qualities).
Sahadeva
Fifth of the five Pandava brothers who
are the protagonists in the great Hindu
epic, the Mahabharata. Sahadeva’s
mother is Madri, who is the junior wife
of King Pandu. None of the Pandava
brothers are actually Pandu’s sons,
since he has been cursed to die the
moment he holds his wife in an
amorous embrace. Madri conceives her
sons magically, using a mantra given to
her co-wife, Kunti, by the sage
Durvasas. The mantra gives the woman
who recites it the power to call down
any of the gods and to have by him a son
[[582]]

equal in power to the god. With Pandu’s
blessing Kunti teaches the mantra to
Madri, who meditates on the Ashvins,
the divine twins who are the physicians
of the gods, and thus bears the twins
Nakula and Sahadeva. As the sons of the
physicians of the gods, both are skilled
healers of animals and human beings.
Although they are among the five
Pandava brothers, they are less impor-
tant to the Mahabharata than their
three elder siblings.
Sahajiya
Religious community originating in
medieval Bengal. The Sahajiyas synthe-
size devotional practices to the god
Vishnu and the ritual practices of the
secret tradition known as tantra, partic-
ularly the extreme practices associated
with the “left-hand” (vamachara) tradi-
tion of tantra. The name sahajiya comes
from the word sahaja (“natural” or
“spontaneous”), indicating the group’s
belief that one’s natural passions, quali-
ties, and tendencies should not be sup-
pressed but should be channeled to help
one gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Over this foundation of
tantric ritual practice was added the
devotion to the god Krishna and his
consort Radha, a devotional thrust
strongly influenced by the Gaudiya
Vaishnava religious community, founded
by the Bengali saint Chaitanya. For fur-
ther information see Shashibhushan B.
Dasgupta, Obscure Religious Cults, 1962;
and Edward C. Dimock Jr., The Place of
the Hidden Moon, 1989.
Sahasradalapadma
In many schools of yoga, and in the reli-
gious tradition known as tantra, one of
the sites in the subtle body (an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the
material body). The subtle body consists
of a set of six psychic centers (chakras),
which are visualized as six multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along theSakata Chauth
course of the spine and connected by
three vertical channels. Each of these
chakras has important symbolic associ-
ations—with different human capaci-
ties, with different subtle elements (tan-
matras), and with different seed sylla-
bles (bijaksharas) formed from the let-
ters of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sound. Above
and below these centers are the bodily
abodes of Shiva (awareness) and Shakti
(power), the two divine principles
through which the entire universe has
come into being. The underlying
assumption behind this concept of the
subtle body is thus the homology of
macrocosm and microcosm, an essen-
tial Hindu idea since the time of the
mystical texts known as the Upanishads.
The sahasradalapadma is the site at
the apex of the subtle body, visualized
as a “thousand-petaled lotus” located in
the crown of the head. This is identified
as the bodily abode of Shiva, where he is
ever-present. In tantra, final liberation
(moksha) comes through the divine
union of Shiva and Shakti in one’s own
body. This is done through awakening
the kundalini, the bodily correlate of
Shakti that lies dormant at the base
of the spine, and drawing the kundalini
up to the sahasradalapadma to effect
the divine union. The sahasradalapadma
is identified with the seed syllable
Om, the symbol of completeness and
perfection. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Sai Baba
Name used by two different charismatic
Hindu teachers, now distinguished by
the addition of other names. The earlier
of the two is Shirdi Sai Baba (d. 1918), so
named for the town in the state of
Maharashtra where he lived much of his
life. The latter figure, Sathya (“true”) Sai
Baba (b. 1926), is a modern Hindu
religious figure of the type known as a
godman, who claims to be the reincar-
nation of Shirdi Sai Baba.
Sainhikeya
In Hindu mythology, demon who
appears in the story of churning the
Ocean of Milk. After the gods and
demons join forces to churn the Ocean
of Milk and obtain the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta), the gods succeed in trick-
ing the demons out of their share. As the
gods divide this nectar among them-
selves, the demon Sainhikeya slips into
the distribution line and is mistakenly
served some as well. As the demon
drinks it, the Sun and Moon alert the
god Vishnu to his presence and Vishnu
cuts off the demon’s head with his dis-
cus. Although the head and body are
separated, both parts become immortal
through their contact with the nectar.
The head becomes Rahu, while the
body becomes Ketu, both of which are
considered malevolent planets in
Indian astrology (jyotisha). According to
tradition, Rahu is also the cause of
eclipses: He roams the sky, chasing the
Sun and Moon, and tries to get revenge
by swallowing them, but the two planets
always pass unharmed out of his sev-
ered neck. See also Tortoise avatar.
Sakata Chauth
Festival falling on the fourth day
(chauth) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Magh (January–
February), which is celebrated as the
birthday of the god Ganesh. Those who
observe this festival are believed to gain
Ganesh’s blessings—wisdom, freedom
from troubles, and prosperity. The
fourth day of every lunar fortnight is
sacred to Ganesh, and vows marking
this day may be performed by his devo-
tees (bhakta). The biggest Ganesh festi-
val of the year is not his birthday, but
Ganesh Chaturthi, which falls on the
fourth day of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September).
[[583]]
Sakha (“companion”) Bhava
Sakha (“companion”) Bhava
The third of the five modes of devotion
to the Supreme Being that were most
prominently expressed by Rupa Goswami.
Rupa used different types of human
relationships as models for the possi-
ble relationships between deity and
devotee (bhakta). These five models
increased in emotional intensity from
the peaceful (shanta) sense that comes
from realizing one’s complete identity
with Brahman, or Supreme Reality, to
conceiving of God as one’s master,
friend, child, or lover. In the sakha
bhava, devotees consider themselves
as God’s friends and companions and
thus as taking part in his regular, every-
day activities.
Sakhi
(“friend,” “companion”) The motif of
friendship as a religious ideal was well
developed by the devotees (bhakta) of
the god Krishna, and to a lesser extent
by devotees of the god Rama. Both of
these deities are avatars (incarnations)
of the god Vishnu, and Vaishnava
devotion tends to stress not only wor-
ship of the chosen deity, but also the
notions of relationship and commu-
nion—both between the deity and
devotee, and among devotees them-
selves. Vaishnava religious practice
often involved elaborate visualization
exercises, in which devotees would
envision the deity’s daily activities—for
Krishna, the simple life of a village
cowherd, and for Rama, the life of a
prince. Some devotional manuals give
detailed daily schedules of the deity’s
activities to facilitate this process of
visualization. Such elaborate visualiza-
tion allowed the devotees to symboli-
cally enter the deity’s world and take
part in the deity’s divine play (lila) on
earth, building a relationship with God
through sharing the mundane ele-
ments of everyday life. In this sort of
visualization, devotees commonly con-
sidered themselves to be the deity’s
sakhis or companions—in some cases
male companions, and in other cases
[[584]]

female companions of the deity’s con-
sorts, Radha and Sita. Taking on the
persona of a sakhi provided a devotee
with a concrete place in the divine
world, in which he or she could both
observe and participate in the god’s
earthly activity.
Sakshin
(“witness”) The perceiving conscious-
ness believed to be the inner Self
(atman), which observes changes going
on around it but is utterly unaffected by
them. It is described in a primitive way
as early as the Upanishads, the specula-
tive texts that form the final layer of the
Vedas, the most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The Katha Upanishad
describes the Self as a thumb-sized per-
son inside the head. The Samkhya
philosophical school develops this
notion in a more subtle and sophisticated
way: of its two fundamental first
principles, one is the purusha, which is
the conscious but inert witness to the
transformations of prakrti, or nature.
Later philosophical schools such as
Vedanta reject the Samkhya school’s
dualism by collapsing all reality into a
single ultimate principle known as
Brahman. Vedanta’s conception of
Brahman as “being-consciousness-
bliss” (sacchidananda) also conceives of
the Self as the conscious and unchang-
ing witness to the material flux sur-
rounding it.
Sala
In Hindi, “wife’s brother.” The term can
be used as a serious insult if applied to
someone who is not related in this way.
Calling someone “sala” implies that the
other is in a position of relative sub-
servience, since he is a member of the
family that “gives” the bride. It also
implies that one is having sexual rela-
tions with that person’s sister, an allega-
tion that is an insult to a family’s honor,
whether or not it is true.Samavartana (“return”) Samskara
Salmala (“Silk-Cotton
Tree”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the
third of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Samadhi
(“trance”) In the ashtanga yoga first
codified by the philosopher Patanjali,
the last of the eight elements of yoga
practice. Along with dharana (“concen-
tration”) and dhyana (“meditation”),
samadhi is one of the three practices
that make up the “inner discipline”
(samyama), the culmination of yogic
training. Samadhi is described as a state
in which the mind is conscious of only
the object of concentration, and is
devoid of any notion of the self as per-
ceiver. Once one has attained samhadi
on the conscious plane, one supposedly
pursues it on more subtle inner planes.
The loss of subjectivity in samadhi is
believed to make people unaware of the
outside world, such that they will not
respond to stimuli and may sometimes
appear almost dead. For this reason, the
burial places of deceased ascetics are
usually referred to as samadhi shrines,
since it is popularly believed that
they are not dead, but only rapt in
deep meditation.
Samadhi Shrine
Burial place of a deceased ascetic. Part
of the process of ascetic initiation is the
initiate’s ritualized death, in which he
(or far more rarely, she) performs his (or
her) own funeral rites, followed by
rebirth with a new name and a new
identity. Consequently, upon the physi-
cal death of an ascetic the funeral rites
(antyeshthi) are not performed, since
the ascetic is (ritually speaking) already
dead. The body is often disposed of by
being weighted down with rocks and
thrown into a river, but well-known and
powerful ascetics are often buried, usu-
ally in a sitting position as if in medita-
tion. Such people are often buried in
places associated with their presence
during their lives—whether a room,
building, or particular outdoor site. In
popular wisdom such ascetics are
believed not to be dead but only rapt in
deep meditation (samadhi). The
samadhi shrines of very renowned
ascetics often have shrines built over
them, which can become places of pil-
grimage for those seeking the ascetic’s
continuing blessings (ashirvad).
Samana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily winds considered
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, vyana,
and udana. The samana wind is consid-
ered to reside in the navel, and to aid in
the process of digestion.
Samasthana
In yoga practice, sitting position in
which the legs are bent, with the soles of
the feet pressed flat against one another
and the outer edges of the feet on the
ground. See utkutikasana.
Samavartana (“return”) Samskara
The fourteenth of the life-cycle cere-
monies (samskaras), which marks the
end of a young man’s life as a celibate
student (brahmacharin) and the return
to his parental home. The most impor-
tant element in this rite is a bath, after
which the young man changes into new
clothes, marking his change in status.
The young man is supposed to ask his
guru’s permission before performing
the ceremony, and gives him his
teacher’s fee (dakshina), both as pay-
ment for services rendered and as a sign
of respect. Shortly after his return to his
natal home, the young man usually
gets married. In modern times this
rite is not often observed, due to the
decline of the traditional paradigm
of the brahmacharin stage of life,
although sometimes it is performed in
preparation for a marriage.
[[585]]
Samavaya
The four Vedas in Sanskrit. The Sama Veda is the second of the four Vedas.
[[586]]

SamavayaSama Veda
(“inherence”) Fundamental category
in the worldview of the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika philosophical school.
This school conceives of the world as
made up of atomistic parts, which are
connected to form larger things. The
fundamental function of samavaya is
as a subtle glue to connect various
things: wholes and their parts, sub-
stances and their attributes, motions
and the things that move, and general
properties and their particular
instances. It also connects both plea-
sure and pain to the Self. Thus
samavaya is the fundamental thing
holding the universe together. The
philosophical problems raised by the
idea of inherence—particularly the
claim that inherence was one single
principle, and not a collection of
things—were ultimately responsible
for the rise of Navyanyaya school,
which attempted to explain these rela-
tionships in a more sophisticated way.Traditionally considered the second of
the four Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts. The
Sama Veda is a collection of hymns,
arranged for singing as one of the com-
ponents of the Vedic sacrifices (yajna).
While drawn mostly from the Rg Veda,
the singing patterns are far more elabo-
rate than the simple chanting generally
associated with the Rg Veda. Thus it is
believed that the Sama Veda developed
later than the Rg Veda.
Sambandar
(7th c.) One of the earliest of the
Nayanars, a group of sixty-three south-
ern Indian poet-saints who were devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva. Along
with their contemporaries the Alvars,
who were devotees of Vishnu, the
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization
of Hindu religion through their passion-
ate devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed in hymns sung in the Tamil
language. Along with his contemporarySamkhya
Appar, Sambandar actively opposed the
unorthodox sects of the times, particu-
larly the Jains, whom he reviles in his
poems. The depth of his hatred can be
seen in a well-established tradition
that, after converting the king of
Madurai, of the Pandya dynasty, from
Jainism to Shaivism, Sambandar was
instrumental in having eight thousand
Jain ascetics executed by impalement.
The collected hymns of the three most
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,
and Sundaramurtti—comprise the
Devaram, the most sacred of the Tamil
Shaivite texts. See also Shaiva.
Samharakrama
(“destruction method”) Ritual in the
Shrividya school of the secretive reli-
gious practice known as tantra. This rit-
ual uses the shrichakra, a symbolic dia-
gram used in worship. The adept’s ritual
journey starts at the outer edges of the
shrichakra, which represents the appar-
ently “real” everyday world, and gradu-
ally moves toward the center, where a
single point (bindu) represents absolute
unity. This process is called “destruc-
tion” because the ritual process system-
atically deconstructs the notion of the
dualistic world and destroys the notion
of a Self that is separate from the
Absolute Reality. For further informa-
tion see Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The
Secret of the Three Cities, 1990.
Samhita
(“collection”) The most archaic textual
layer in the Vedas, comprising hymns to
the Vedic deities, benedictions, prayers,
spells, and litanies. The term indicates
that this group of texts is a collection of
various things important, not only for
their cognitive meaning, but for their
power as mantra (sacred sound). The
samhitas were chanted during rites of
sacrifice and remain the oldest living
part of the Hindu tradition. Following
the samhitas are the three later textual
levels: the Brahmanas, which are
essentially manuals detailing correct
performance of the sacrifice, and the
Aranyakas and the Upanishads, which
ask speculative questions about the
power behind the sacrifice.
Samkalpa
(“intention”) Important ritual sequence
at the beginning of many religious rites
in which the person performing the rite
states his or her identity, the time and
place at which the action is being per-
formed, the performer’s intention to
carry out this particular ritual act,
and the benefits desired from the action.
The samkalpa is important as the
formal commitment to perform the
stated action. For ritual actions that
promise several different possible
benefits—for example, birth in heaven
or final liberation—performing the
samkalpa is believed to give one the
result one desires.
Samkhya
(“enumeration”) One of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, whose
founding text is the Samkhyakarikas,
written by Ishvarakrishna in the third
century B.C.E. Samkhya espouses an
atheistic philosophical dualism positing
two fundamental principles as the
source of all things. The first of these is
called purusha (“person”), which is con-
scious, but completely inactive and
unchanging. It is seen as a passive wit-
ness to the transformations going on
around it. As the source of conscious-
ness, purusha is ultimately identified
with an individual’s true and eternal
Self. Purusha is inferred as plural, given
the plurality of conscious beings, com-
bined with the fact that one person can
gain enlightenment while all the rest
remain in bondage.
The other fundamental principle is
prakrti, (“nature”), which provides the
object to the purusha’s subject. Prakrti is
better conceived of as force or power
rather than a specific material object.
Prakrti contains within it forces with three
different primordial qualities (gunas):
[[587]]
Samkhya
sattva tends toward the good, rajas
towards activity or passion, and tamas
towards darkness and decay. In the pri-
mal prakrti these three forces are in per-
fect equilibrium, each perfectly balanc-
ing the others. The two principles of
purusha and prakrti are distinct, sepa-
rate, and alone.
When prakrti’s initial equilibrium is
disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern of
evolution that creates both the exterior
physical world and the interior psycho-
logical world. From prakrti emerges
mahat (“the great one”), which has as its
psychological counterpart the subtlest
form of mental activity (buddhi). From
buddhi evolves ahamkar, which con-
tains the first real ideas of individual
identity. From ahamkar evolves the
mind (manas), the sense organs (jna-
nendriyas), the organs of action (kar-
mendriyas), and the subtle elements
(tanmatras); from the last evolve the
gross elements that actually make up
the material world. All of these evo-
lutes—material or psychic—have a dif-
fering balance of the three gunas, which
ultimately determines their character as
wholesome, active, or unwholesome.
Throughout this process of evolution,
purusha remains unchanged, a mere
witness to prakrti’s unceasing transfor-
mations. Their mutual functioning is
described using the metaphor of the
lame man (purusha) being carried by
the blind man (prakrti).
The ultimate source of bondage,
according to the Samkhya school,
comes because people do not recognize
the difference between these two princi-
ples. Through this lack of discrimination
between the two, the Self (purusha)
appears as if it is an agent, and the evo-
lutes (from prakrti) as if they are con-
scious. The Samkhyas illustrate this mis-
understanding using the example of the
rose behind the crystal, in which the lat-
ter appears to be colored but is in fact
unchanged. Although for the Samkhyas
prakrti undergoes real transformations,
the primary problem is epistemologi-
cal—that is, how one comes to know
things—rather than ontological, or rooted
[[588]]

in the nature of things themselves. Since
the purusha never changes, there is no
question of making it into anything else
or regaining the way that it used to be;
the real problem is making the distinc-
tion between the differing realities of
these two principles. Once this has been
done, the evolution of prakrti is said to
reverse, leaving the purusha again in its
state of magnificent isolation (kaivalya).
Of course, once one has a developed (if
erroneous) idea of (conventional) per-
sonality, this discrimination becomes all
the more difficult. This mistaken idea
becomes the basis for one’s volitional
actions (karma) and one’s emotional
dispositions. One’s actions and disposi-
tions reinforce each other, and both of
these are undergirded by the notion of a
Self.
The Samkhya metaphysics were
adopted wholesale by the yoga philo-
sophical school, and the two schools are
usually mentioned together—Samkhya
as the theoretical foundation, and Yoga
as the practical component. One of
Samkhya’s lasting contributions to
Indian thought is the idea of the gunas, a
basic concept running through Hindu
culture. Another influential but less per-
vasive idea is their model of evolution,
which has been adapted by other
schools but often subsumed under the-
istic assumptions in which God is the
source of both consciousness and the
material world. The one philosophical
problem that the Samkhya could never
surmount was to explain the source of
bondage, given their starting assump-
tions. If purusha and prakrti are com-
pletely separate, how could the two of
them interact—much less mistake one
for the other—and how did the process
of evolution begin? Although their con-
tributions remain significant, they were
largely eclipsed by Vedanta, which
claimed that the problem is ignorance of
the Self and not-Self, and that the world
around us is not an actual evolution, but
only an illusory transformation (vivarta).
This philosophical model is called
Vivartavada. For further information
see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan andSamsara

Indian Philosophy, 1957; and Gerald
Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya
(eds.), Samkhya, 1987.
Sampraday
(“tradition”) Literally, “that which is
handed down,” or the transmitted body
of teachings that distinguishes one reli-
gious group from another. Belonging to
a particular sampraday is based on hav-
ing received teachings from one’s spiri-
tual preceptor (guru), thus becoming
part of a spiritual lineage, and continu-
ing the life of that sampraday by trans-
mitting the teachings to disciples.
Although the sampraday is often trans-
lated as “sect,” this loses its sense of
uniqueness within particular theistic
traditions. For example, one can speak
of different sampradays among Tamil
Shaiva brahmins, by virtue of their dif-
fering spiritual lineages, even though
they worship the same deity and share a
common cultural heritage.
Samsara
(“wandering”) The cycle of reincarna-
tion, one of the most fundamental
assumptions throughout all Indian reli-
gion. In the Indian worldview, reincar-
nation involves a series of births and
rebirths in different realms and forms,
all based on the quality and quantity of
karma, formed through previous
actions and patterns of thought. Beings
with good karma may be born into the
heavens, which are essentially realms of
pleasure and carefree enjoyment; those
with bad karma may be reborn as ani-
mals or as ghosts, or into realms of pun-
ishment, such as hells. Neither pleasure
nor punishment is eternal, although
they may last an extremely long time.
Beings in heaven enjoy the results of
their past actions, but when their good
karma is exhausted they must take
another, lower birth; beings in realms of
punishment are paying for their evil
deeds, but when this has been done they
will take another birth, presumably in
some higher status.
Between these two lies the human
realm, which comprises infinite possi-
bilities, based on various factors—such
as high status or low, wealth or poverty,
health or disability, and the religious
piety of one’s natal family. Varying mix-
tures of good and bad karma combine
for many different human circum-
stances, and according to popular
belief one’s present life and body are a
record of one’s past. The notion that
people are, in life, where they deserve
to be because of karma can be seen as
the basis for the caste system.
Fulfilling one’s particular social role
(svadharma), no matter how humble,
not only upholds the social order but is
a means for individual spiritual
advancement.
The human realm is widely believed
to be the best of all for spiritual life,
partly because human beings can
make rational choices, including the
decision to take part in religious life. In
this humans are different from ani-
mals, which are driven mainly by their
instincts, and from ghosts or hell-
dwellers, who are simply expiating
their past acts. At the same time
human life, unlike life in the heavens,
is full of reverses and sorrow continu-
ally reminding human beings about
the transience of life and possessions
and the need to engage in spiritual
development. Embodied existence is a
constant cycling from one realm to the
next, leaving one body and assuming
another, and the inherent uncertainty
of this condition has led to the search,
dating from the time of the speculative
texts known as the Upanishads, for an
unchanging state, completely out of
this cycle of rebirth. This unchanging
state is widely accepted as life’s
supreme goal, although in any genera-
tion very few actively seek it, with most
people content to relegate it to some
indefinite future lifetime. For further
information see Wendy Doniger
O’Flaherty (ed.), Karma and Rebirth in
Classical Indian Traditions, 1980.
[[589]]
Samskara
The chudakarana samskara, in which a child’s head is shaved as a rite of purification.
Samskara
(“making perfect”) Collective name for
the various life-cycle ceremonies in
Hindu society. Although status in Indian
society depends most on one’s birth,
[[590]]

this alone is not sufficient to become a
complete and finished person. In an
individual’s development, the raw mate-
rial given by nature must be refined
through the process of culture, or theSamvad
action of samskaras. This process of
transformation begins before birth,
with the three prenatal samskaras, and
continues to death with the antyeshthi
samskaras. In general, samskaras trans-
form people in two ways: by removing
latent or residual impurities, such as the
childhood chudakarana samskara, or
by generating new capacities and enti-
tlements, such as the upanayana (initia-
tion) and vivaha (marriage) samskaras.
Although different writers in the dhar-
ma literature disagree on the number of
samskaras, traditionally, sixteen are
accepted. Three were prenatal samskaras:
one to ensure conception (Garbhadhana),
one to ensure the birth of a boy
(Pumsavana), and one to ensure an easy
delivery and a healthy child (Siman-
tonnayana). Six samskaras were associat-
ed with childhood: ritual actions immedi-
ately after birth (Jatakarma), name-giving
(Namakarana), the first outing (Nishkra-
mana), the first solid food (Anna-
prashana), head-shaving (Chudakarana),
and piercing of the ears (Karnavedha).
Five samskaras were connected with life as
a celibate student (brahmacharin): begin-
ning of learning (Vidyarambha), adoles-
cent religious initiation (Upanayana), the
beginning of Veda study (Vedarambha),
the first shave (Keshanta), and the return
home at the conclusion of studies (Sama-
vartana). The final two samskaras were
marriage, and the last rites for the dead
(antyeshthi samskara).
These sixteen samskaras were the
rites for a twice-born man, whom this
literature considered the default person.
A twice-born man was one born into
one of the three “twice-born” varnas—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—who
were ritually eligible for the adolescent
religious initiation known as the “sec-
ond birth.” Women in the twice-born
groups would undergo all the rites
through the childhood rites, but would
have no further rites until marriage,
which was considered equal to all sam-
skaras for them. People born outside the
twice-born groups—namely, shudras
and untouchables—would perform few
if any of these rites.
These life cycle rites drive and gov-
ern the formation of the individual. In
modern times many of these sam-
skaras are still performed, but mainly
by brahmins who, because of their tra-
ditional role as priests and scholars,
conserve this practice to help main-
tain their traditional prestige. For fur-
ther information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane, A History of Dharma-
sastra, 1968; and Raj Bali Pandey,
Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The former is
encyclopedic and the latter more
accessible; despite their age, they
remain the best sources about tradi-
tional Hindu rites.
Samudra Gupta
(r. 335–376) The second monarch in the
Gupta dynasty, son of Chandra Gupta I.
During his reign Samudra Gupta made
significant territorial gains from the
Gupta dynasty’s home base in eastern
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar westward to
the Ganges basin and eastward into
Bengal and Assam. Orissa and much of
the Coromandel Coast gave tribute as
independent but vassal states. Samudra
Gupta left a personal account of his
prowess inscribed on a stone column at
Allahabad. This column had originally
been carved to display one of the Pillar
Edicts of the Maurya emperor Ashoka
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.), and in claiming it as
his own Samudra Gupta was attempting
to appropriate some of the Maurya
dynasty’s luster.
Samvad
(“dialogue”) Technical term for the
speaking parts in the Ramnagar Ram
Lila, a dramatic presentation of the
Ramayana staged annually at the forti-
fied town of Ramnagar, near Benares.
The dialogues are interspersed with
recitations from the Ramcharitmanas,
a vernacular retelling of the Ramayana
written by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?), and render the archaic
language of the Ramcharitmanas into
modern vernacular Hindi. The action in
[[591]]
Samyama
the Ram Lila alternates between con-
temporary and archaic text.
Samyama
(“inner discipline”) In the ashtanga
yoga first codified by the philosopher
Patanjali, a collective name for the last
three stages in yoga practice, namely
dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. These
stages are concerned with focusing and
disciplining the mind, and are the most
subtle and internalized elements in
yogic practice.
Sanaka
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma, who are
paradigms of asceticism; the other
three are Sanandana, Sanatana,
and Sanatkumara. When Brahma
emanates these four sages, he com-
mands them to begin the work of cre-
ation, but they are so detached from
worldly concerns that they refuse to
do so. They are celibate their entire
lives, study the Vedas from childhood,
and always travel together.
Sanakadi
(“Sanaka and the others”) In Hindu
mythology, a collective name for four
sages born of Brahma who are para-
digms of asceticism; the four sages
are Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana,
and Sanatkumara. When Brahma
emanates them, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanaka Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday)
of the Naga class of the Bairagi ascetics.
Bairagi ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu. The Nagas are fighting
ascetics hired by the other Bairagis to
protect them. The Naga class is orga-
[[592]]

nized in military fashion into different
anis or “armies.” Until the beginning of
the nineteenth century their primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these have largely
disappeared in contemporary times.
The Sanaka Sampraday traces its spiri-
tual lineage from the Nimbarki sect,
founded by Nimbarka. Members of this
sect worship Radha and Krishna as a
divine couple, with both deities holding
equal status.
Sanandana
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are par-
adigms of asceticism; the other three
are Sanaka, Sanatana, and Sana-
tkumara. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanatana
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are para-
digms of asceticism; the other three
ascetics are Sanaka, Sanandana, and
Sanatkumara. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together.
Sanatana (“eternal”) Dharma
In the dharma literature, the ultimate
and eternal moral order of the universe.
It is the eternal ideal pattern revealed in
the Vedas (the oldest and most authori-
tative Hindu religious texts). This pat-
tern must be upheld to maintain the sta-
bility of society. All aspects of religious
duty (dharma) aim ultimately towardSandhi
the maintenance and fulfillment of this
order, including common religious
duties (sadharana dharma), religious
duties stemming from social status
(varna dharma) and stage of life (ash-
rama dharma), and individualized reli-
gious duty (svadharma). In more recent
times, the term has been used
by Hindus to identify the religious
tradition known to the outside world
as “Hinduism.”
Sanatana Sampraday
Another name for the Nimbarki reli-
gious community. The philosopher
Nimbarka was the community’s histori-
cal founder, but, according to the
Nimbarkis, the actual founder was the
god Vishnu himself. One of Vishnu’s dis-
ciples was named Sanatana (“eternal”),
hence the name of the sampraday.
Sanatkumara
In Hindu mythology, one of four sages
born of the god Brahma who are par-
adigms of asceticism; the other three
are
Sanaka,
Sanandana,
and
Sanatana. When Brahma emanates
these four sages, he commands them
to begin the work of creation, but they
are so detached from worldly con-
cerns that they refuse to do so. They
are celibate their entire lives, study
the Vedas from childhood, and always
travel together
Sandhabhasha
Symbolic language used in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious prac-
tice. The literal translation of the term
is disputed; it is often translated as
“twilight language” because of its
shadowy and mysterious character,
but Agehananda Bharati is emphatic
that the term means “intentional lan-
guage.” The elements of tantric wor-
ship and practice are described in a
coded language drawn from the parts
and functions of the human body con-
sidered private by most standards.
Such coded discourse is used to hide
the tradition’s essentials from nonini-
tiates and also to project the speakers
into an altered understanding. For
noninitiates, such language reinforces
the general conception of tantric prac-
titioners as completely debased.
Douglas R. Brooks reports in The
Secret of the Three Cities, 1990, that
although widely used in Buddhist
tantra, Sandhabhasha is less common
among Hindus, who for their coded
language favor using common words
with contextually technical meanings.

Agehananda. Bharati, The Tantric
Tradition, 1977; Appendix A in Linda
Hess and Shukdev Singh (trans.), The
Bijak of Kabir, 1983; and Douglas

Cities, 1990.
Sandhi
Sandarshana (“expositing”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra), in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the hand
gesture used to signify explanation or
exposition, and for this reason it is also
known as the vyakhyana (“teaching”)
mudra. Since the teaching gesture indi-
cates a person of higher spiritual attain-
ment, it is also known as the chit (“con-
sciousness”) mudra.
(“junction”) In classical Sanskrit gram-
mar, a term for the euphonic (harmonic)
combination of words. In general this is
done by modifying the final phoneme of
one word, based on the initial phoneme
of the following word, to facilitate a
smooth verbal transition between the
two. An example is the compound word
sacchidananda, which designates the
three essential aspects of the ultimate
unqualified Brahman, and is formed
from the words sat (“being”), chit (“con-
sciousness”) and ananda (“bliss”).
[[593]]
Sandhya
Sandhya
(“union”) Morning and evening twilight,
the two transitional times between day
and night and thus, metaphorically, the
times when day and night are united.
The word also often denotes certain
rites performed daily at morning, noon,
and evening, the three times when dif-
ferent parts of the day are in union.
These rites are prescribed in the dhar-
ma literature as mandatory for all
twice-born men, that is, all men from
the brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya
groups who have undergone the adoles-
cent religious initiation known as the
“second birth.” At present time these
rites are performed only by the most
orthodox brahmins.
Sangam
(“coming together”) Meeting-place for
two rivers and the point at which their
capacity for purification is believed to
be heightened. The most famous such
site is the confluence of the Ganges
and the Yamuna rivers at the city of
Allahabad, but numerous other such
sites exist throughout the Indian sub-
continent.
Sangama Dynasty
See Vijayanagar dynasty.
Sangam Literature
Collection of classical literature from the
Tamil culture, composed during the
early centuries of the common era;
Sangam (also spelled Cankam) means
“academy.” The most famous texts in
Sangam literature are eight collections
of short poems. Three of these collec-
tions fall into the genre called puram
(“the outer part”); the other five are in
the genre called akam (“the inner part”).
Puram poetry was “public” verse,
describing the deeds of kings, war,
death, and other heroic actions. Akam
poetry was about an individual’s inner
experience, especially cultured love, of
which the Sangam poets distinguished
five developed moods: union, patient
[[594]]

waiting, unfaithfulness, separation, and
hardship. Each of these moods had well-
developed symbolic associations,
including associations with a specific
type of landscape, time of day and year,
flora, fauna, and types of people; such
richly developed symbolism gives these
poems incredible symbolic depth. The
akam poems are arguably the literary
antecedents to devotional (bhakti)
poetry, which first developed in Tamil
Nadu. For further information see A.K.
Ramanujan (trans.), The Interior
Landscape, 1994; and Glenn Yocum,
“Shrines, Shamanism, and Love Poetry:
Elements in the Emergence of Popular
Tamil Bhakti,” in the Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. 41,
No. 1, 1973. See also Tamil epics and
Tamil language.
Sanjaya
Minister of the blind king Dhrtarashtra,
an important older figure in the Hindu
epic the Mahabharata. Sanjaya tries
valiantly to avert the war that is the epic’s
climax by counseling the king to better
control his son Duryodhana, and to deal
more equitably with his nephews the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are the
epic’s protagonists. In the end, the king
ignores Sanjaya’s advice. Sanjaya is most
famous for his ability to see anything he
thinks about (“tele-vision”). This power is
given to him as a gift from the sage Vyasa
so he can describe the progress of the war
to Dhrtarashtra without actually having to
be there. After the war, Sanjaya goes to live
in the forest with Dhrtarashtra, and it is he
who informs the Pandavas about the blind
king’s death in a forest fire.
Sanjaya Belatthiputa
Agnostic thinker in early Indian philos-
ophy whose views are alluded to in
the Buddhist scriptures. The scriptures
portray Sanjaya as an advocate of
profound agnosticism with regard to
another world, the effects of good and
evil deeds, and just about every facet of
religious life.Sanskrit
Sanjna
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of
Vishvakarma, workman and architect
for the gods. Sanjna has been married to
Surya, the Sun, but finds his dazzling
radiance too much to bear. To help his
daughter adjust to her husband,
Vishvakarma trims off some bits of the
sun with his divine tools, removing
enough of his radiance that Samjna can
bear to be with him. The trimmed-off
parts of the sun are used to build the
Pushpak Viman, an aerial car, as well as
the god Vishnu’s discus (chakra), the
god Shiva’s trident, and various other
divine weapons.
Sankalpa
Spoken ritual performed before a reli-
gious act. The person about to perform
the act identifies himself by name, tells
the location of the act, and gives the
lunar calendar date and time. He goes
on to describe the religious act and what
benefits he wants to receive as a result.
Sankalpa is done before rituals such as
suicide and doing morning puja to the
Ganges. See samkalpa.
Sankarshana
(“dragging away”) Epithet of the god
Krishna’s brother Balarama, referring
to Balarama’s unusual prenatal devel-
opment—he is conceived by Krishna’s
mother Devaki but is magically trans-
ferred into the womb of her co-wife
Rohini. This is done to protect him
from harm, since Devaki’s wicked
uncle Kamsa has already killed her
first seven children, and will certainly
do the same if she carries Balarama to
term. See Balarama.
Sankat Mochan
(“freeing from distress”) Epithet of a partic-
ular form of the monkey-god Hanuman,
whose main temple is on the southern part
of Benares. Sankat Mochan has been an
increasingly popular form of Hanuman
since the 1970s. As with all manifestations
of Hanuman, Sankat Mochan is consid-
ered a strong protective deity, with the
power to rescue his devotees (bhakta)
from all kinds of trouble and misfortune.
Sankat Mochan
(2) A temple in the southern part of
Benares dedicated to the monkey-god
Hanuman in his form as Sankat Mochan.
The temple does not have a long history
but first became famous in the nineteenth
century through some Ramanandi ascetics
living there, whose piety drew visitors to
the spot. In modern times, the temple
has become popular because the image
of Hanuman is believed to be very pow-
erful, but also accessible—qualities that
lead petitioners to come with requests
and leave with the assurance that help
is forthcoming.
Sankranti
(“transition”) The transition of a celestial
body (sun, moon, or planet) from one
sign of the zodiac to another. Such tran-
sitions can give the celestial bodies or
the time in question positive or negative
qualities. The most important of these
celestial bodies is the sun, whose two
directional transitions—northward at
Makara Sankranti, and southward at
Karka Sankranti—define more and less
auspicious times for the entire year.
Sanskrit
(“perfected”) For much of Indian history,
Sanskrit was the language of the cultural
and religious elite. Even in the twentieth
century, it is still the language with the
highest religious status. Its name reflects
the religious conviction that it was the
perfect language—the language of the
gods. Sanskrit was essentially fixed in the
fourth century B.C.E. by the grammarian
Panini in his Ashtadhyayi. Since it has
not changed from Panini’s time, Sanskrit
is no longer considered a “natural”
language. Even in Panini’s time, Sanskrit
would have been a person’s second
language, learned by conscious study
after acquiring a grammatically simpler
mother tongue (one of the Prakrits)
[[595]]
Sant
An illustrated page of Sanskrit from the first chapter of the Devimahatmya.
The illustration depicts the opening episode, in which a king and a merchant visit a hermit.
through the normal process of language
learning. In a religious context Sanskrit
has primarily been the province of
brahmins, serving both as a sacred
language and a common language
through which the brahmins from vari-
ous areas could communicate with each
other. Its place of pride as the religious
language par excellence has been some-
what undercut by the influence of the
devotional (bhakti) religious movement.
One of this movement’s pervasive fea-
tures was poetry composed in vernacular
languages, which reflected the conscious
choice to speak in a language that every-
one could understand.
Sant
[[596]]

Literally, someone who has found the
truth, or who is searching for it. The
word is derived from the Sanskrit word
sat (“truth”). More generally it refers to
two major groups of devotional (bhakti)
poet-saints. One group was centered
around the temple of Vithoba at
Pandharpur in the state of Maharashtra,
and includes saints from the Varkari
Panth community such as Namdev,
Tukaram, Chokamela, and Eknath.
The other group included later poet-
saints from various places in northern
India, among them Kabir, Ravidas,
Dadu, and Guru Nanak, the founder of
the Sikh community.
As a group the sants shared certain
general tendencies rather than an
explicit body of doctrine. Sant religion
was inclined to stress an individual-
ized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine, rather
than participation in established cults.
One of the most common sant themes
was their disdain for external ritual,
and the general rejection of any wor-
ship using images. The northern
Indian sants are the most uncompro-
mising advocates of nirguna devotion,
in which the divine is seen as beyond
conception; but even among the
Pandharpur devotees (bhakta) the
stress was on devotion to the god
Vithoba, rather than actual worship.
The sants stressed the power of the
divine Name and its ability to remove
all obstacles. They disregarded caste
distinctions, viewing them as an arbi-
trary barrier dividing the human com-
munity. They stressed instead the value
of satsang, and the transforming
effects that such “good company”
could bring. Satsang thus formed an
egalitarian community through the
common bonds of faith and devotion,
as an alternative to the hierarchical
society established by birth.
It is sometimes suggested that all of
these themes can be traced to the sants’
social background, since many of themSantoshi Ma
came from very low caste communities. It
is certainly true that devotees of low social
status would have been forbidden even to
enter temples, much less worship the
images in those temples, and thus a reli-
gious path emphasizing the Name and
interior religious experience, which are
accessible to everyone, might have
seemed a more viable option. In the same
way, the socially oppressed might find the
notion of an alternative, egalitarian com-
munity immensely attractive. Yet to
reduce the sant tradition to a simple reac-
tion by marginal social groups cannot
explain why one of its major figures is
Eknath, a brahmin. Such reductionist
analyses ignore the sant movement’s real
thrust, namely the passionate search for
the divine that permitted no compromis-
es and no excuses. For further informa-
tion see Karine Schomer and W. H.
McLeod, The Sants, 1985.
Santal
Tribal (adivasi) community in northern
India, particularly in the border districts
of Bihar and West Bengal. As with most
tribals in India, many are very poor and
make a precarious living as cultivators.
Santoshi Ma
(“the mother who satisfies”) Goddess
who is one of the most fascinating
Hindu deities, and whose recent explo-
sive popularity illustrates both the flexi-
bility of the Hindu pantheon, and the
way that Hindu religion reflects and
responds to changes in Indian society.
Santoshi Ma’s popularity was largely
inspired by a film released in 1975, Jai
Santoshi Ma (“Victory to Santoshi Ma”).
The film first details the birth of Santoshi
Ma as the daughter of the god Ganesh,
but then cuts to the earthly problems
suffered by one of her devotees (bhakta),
Satyavati. Satyavati is a new bride hav-
ing problems adjusting to her marital
home, particularly because of tensions
with her wicked sisters-in-law. By the
end of the film, through Satyavati’s
steadfast devotion to Santoshi Ma, all of
her problems are resolved.
This film did not invent Santoshi Ma,
although it was largely responsible for
spreading her worship. The prescrip-
tions for Santoshi Ma’s religious vow
(vrat) had existed before the film was
made, and both the rite’s charter myth
and the film focus on the problems of a
new bride and their eventual resolution
through her steadfast devotion to
Santoshi Ma. Santoshi Ma’s ultimate
source is a mystery, but her iconography
suggests that she is an amalgam of other
female deities. She is seated on the lotus,
a feature associated with the goddess
Lakshmi; she wields the sword associated
with the goddesses Kali and Durga, as
well as the trident associated with the
god Shiva. She shows the attributes
associated with both married and
unmarried goddesses: Like the married
goddesses, she is nurturing and caring
to her devotees, playing the role of the
benevolent Indian mother, and like the
independent unmarried goddesses, she
is powerful and and potentially danger-
ous—one of the film’s climactic scenes
shows her utterly destroying a temple
after Satyavati’s sister-in-law intention-
ally ruined the sanctified food (prasad)
meant for her devotees. Yet she is also
believed to have the power to grant her
devotees’ requests, no matter how large.
Through her nurturing, benevolent
character coupled with power, she
crosses the usual boundaries associated
with Hindu goddesses.
Part of the popularity of Santoshi
Ma’s vrat comes from its simplicity,
cheapness, and promise of benefits. The
observance is usually kept by women
with the aim of attaining concrete goals
for themselves and their families: get-
ting a job, passing an exam, conceiving a
child, or arranging a marriage. The rite
involves weekly fasting (upavasa) and
worship. One of the social factors cited
in Santoshi Ma’s explosive popularity is
the steadily growing uncertainty in
Indian (and South Asian) life, which
makes very ordinary things difficult
to attain and necessitates the use of
all possible resources. In this context,
an inexpensive rite that promises
[[597]]
Santoshi Ma Vrat
concrete benefits for assiduous devotion
is an attractive option. See also Santoshi
Ma Vrat.
Santoshi Ma Vrat
Religious observance celebrated on
Fridays in homage to the goddess
Santoshi Ma (“the mother who satis-
fies”). This religious vow (vrat) is usually
kept by women with the aim of attaining
concrete goals for themselves or (more
commonly) their families: getting a job,
passing an exam, conceiving a child, or
arranging a marriage. When one’s wish
has been granted, a final ceremony
calls for the observant to feed eight
brahmin boys a meal of rice, yogurt, and
bananas. After this concluding rite,
one is no longer required to observe the
vow, although many women choose
to continue performing it as a means
to maintain the household’s general
good fortune.
The Santoshi Ma Vrat has become
extremely popular throughout northern
India since the late 1970s, one reason
being that it is simple and inexpensive.
On the day of the fast (upavasa) the wor-
shiper should not eat until the evening
meal, although tea and other beverages
are generally allowed. In the late after-
noon the worshiper should light a lamp
in front of a picture of Santoshi Ma, offer
her small amounts of chickpeas and raw
sugar—things that can be found in even
the poorest households—and read
aloud the rite’s charter myth, which tells
how a poor, unfortunate woman solved
all her family’s troubles through her
devotion to Santoshi Ma. After this, the
worshiper may eat the evening meal,
although it is also subject to restrictions:
Since Santoshi Ma is a goddess associat-
ed with sweetness, the food must not
contain any sour, spicy, or bitter season-
ings. This observance thus carries the
two common features of most religious
vows: some form of worship and modi-
fication of one’s diet, with the promise of
benefits in return.
[[598]]

Sanyasi
(“renunciant”) According to the dharma
literature, the last of the idealized
stages of life (ashrama) for a twice-born
man, that is a man born into the brah-
min, kshatriya, or vaishya communi-
ties. Boys born into these communities
are eligible for the adolescent religious
initiation known as the “second birth.”
After engaging in religious learning as a
celibate student (brahmacharin), mar-
rying and raising a family as a house-
holder (grhastha), and gradually detach-
ing himself from the world as a forest-
dwelling recluse (vanaprastha), a twice-
born man should finally renounce all
possessions and all attachments to
devote himself exclusively to the search
for ultimate truth. Although in a general
sense the word Sanyasi can (and some-
times does) refer to any such renun-
ciant, it is most used as the name of a
particular ascetic community, the
Dashanami Sanyasis, who are believed
to have been founded by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya, and who
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
Sanyasi Rebellion
Name given by the British to a long-term
struggle in the Bengal region in the latter
half of the eighteenth century. This was
the period in which the British East
India Company was consolidating its
economic, political, and military control
over the region, causing wide-ranging
dislocations in traditional Bengali soci-
ety. Among the entrenched powers with
which the British clashed were orga-
nized bands of soldier-ascetics, both
Hindus and Muslims. These soldier-
ascetics were significant local forces,
with both military and economic power
gained through mercenary services,
trading, and money-lending, and they
competed with the British East India
Company for political authority and
land revenue.
Conflict between the British and the
ascetics peaked shortly after the Bengal
famine of 1770–1771. The rebellion was
caused partly by competition for greatlySapindikarana
reduced agricultural revenue and by
British-sponsored changes in land own-
ership patterns, in which officials in the
East India Company replaced many of
the “unprofitable” traditional landowners
with their own Company employees.
Many of the traditional landowners
owed money to ascetic moneylenders
(Sanyasis), and had pledged their land
revenue as security. The Sanyasis were
upset when the landowners were
replaced and the debts not honored. For
their part, the Company’s officials were
reluctant to allow the ascetics, who trav-
eled in heavily armed bands, to pass
through the company’s territories while
on religious pilgrimage, as the ascetics
had traditionally done. Ultimately
the ascetic attacks were disorganized
and local, and the disparate Sanyasi
bands were unable to withstand
British resources and organization. A
fictionalized account of the Sanyasi
Rebellion appeared in the novel
Anandamath, by Bankim Chandra
Chatterjee (1838–1894), who used the
Sanyasi Rebellion as a coded call for
resistance to contemporary British rule.
Sapaksha
One of the parts of an acceptable
form of inference (anumana) in Indian
philosophy. An acceptable inference
has three terms: an assertion (pratijna),
a reason (hetu), and examples (drshtanta);
each of these three has its own con-
stituent parts. The sapaksha is part of
the third term, the examples. It is a pos-
itive example given to support the claim
made in the initial assertion, by showing
that similar things happen in compara-
ble cases. For example, in the inference,
“there is fire on the mountain, because
there is smoke on the mountain,” the
sapaksha could be “as in a kitchen,”
since this place has both fire and smoke,
and thus supports the initial assertion.
Conventionally, an inference also has to
have a negative example, to show that
the claim made in the assertion does not
happen in some other cases.
Saphala Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Paush (December–January). All the
eleventh-day observances are dedicated
to the worship of Vishnu. Most Hindu
religious festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, which usually involve fast-
ing (upavasa) and worship and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Those performing this rite
must stay up all night singing and telling
of Vishnu’s exploits. The name Saphala
means “successful,” and those who
faithfully observe this will be successful
in all their endeavors.
Sapinda
(“having a common body”) Term for
people having common ancestry, who
could thus be said to share the same
body through the ancestor. This rela-
tionship was held to cease after seven
generations on the father’s side, and
after five on the mother’s. Men and
women who were sapinda were theoret-
ically forbidden to marry, although this
prohibition has been routinely ignored
in southern India since very early times.
See also marriage prohibitions.
Sapindikarana
Funerary rite (antyeshthi samskara)
performed on the twelfth day after
death, which symbolically represents
the one-year anniversary of the death.
In this rite, the departed person is trans-
formed from a potentially dangerous
wandering spirit (pret) to a benevolent
ancestral spirit (pitr). Each day for ten
days following a person’s death, mourn-
ers leave a ball of cooked grain (pinda)
for the departed spirit. Gradually the ten
pindas “construct” a new body for the
departed person. Then sapindikarana is
performed on the twelfth day. A large
pinda, representing the departed, and
three smaller ones are collected, repre-
senting the departed’s father, grandfa-
ther, and great-grandfather. The rite’s
[[599]]
Sapindikarana
A groom and bride circle the sacred fire during the marriage ceremony,
a rite often combined with the saptapadi, or the seven steps.
central moment comes when the
departed’s pinda is divided into three
parts, one part is mixed with each of the
other three pindas, and finally all three
pindas are combined into one. At the
moment the three pindas are combined,
the departed is believed to have become
one (sapindi) with his ancestors, and to
[[600]]

have been transformed from a wander-
ing spirit into an ancestor as well. This
twelfth day rite is the last of the funerary
rites performed on a strict timetable.
Mourners may wait for years before per-
forming the final rite of asthi-visarjana,
in which bone and ashes from the dead
person’s cremation pyre are immersedSaraswat
in a sacred river, although with the
advent of better transportation this is
sometimes now performed before the
twelfth day rites. In addition, people
still perform annual memorial rites for
the deceased. For an excellent account
of this rite, see David M. Knipe,
“Sapindikarana: The Hindu Rite of Entry
into Heaven,” in Frank E. Reynolds and
Earle H. Waugh (eds.), Religious
Encounters With Death, 1977.
Saptapadi
(“seven steps”) The most important rite
in the Hindu marriage ceremony, in
which the bride and groom take seven
steps together to symbolize their marital
union. The seventh step completes the
transfer of the bride from her natal fam-
ily to the groom’s family and is also the
point when the marriage becomes per-
manent. As described in the dharma lit-
erature, the bride and groom would
perform this rite by taking seven steps in
a straight line. In contemporary times
this rite is often combined with the
agnipradakshinam (“circumambulat-
ing the fire”), in which the bride and
groom make seven revolutions around a
small fire—considered to be a form of
the god Agni and thus the divine witness
to the marriage. While circling the fire,
the bride and groom are often physically
joined by tying part of his turban to the
edge of her sari as a visible sign of their
marital union.
Saptasindhu
(“seven seas”) In traditional mythic
geography, the seven oceans surround-
ing the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) that make up the visible world.
Each of these seven seas is composed of
a different substance. The ocean acces-
sible to human beings is composed of
salt water, but the oceans beyond that
are composed of sugarcane juice, wine,
ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, milk, and
sweet water. Few specific details exist
about most of these oceans, but the
Ocean of Milk has a prominent place in
Hindu mythology, since it was by churn-
ing this that the gods obtained the nec-
tar of immortality (amrta). See also
Tortoise avatar.
Sarama
In the Rg Veda, the earliest Hindu sacred
text, a servant of the storm-god Indra. In
Rg Veda 10.108, Sarama is sent as an
emissary to Indra’s enemies, the Panis,
to inquire where they have hidden the
cows they have stolen, and to threaten
them with Indra’s wrath if they do not
reveal their location.
Saraswat
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or
intermarried, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group has a monopoly. This sort of dif-
ferentiation applied even to brahmins,
whose role has been to serve as priests,
scholars, and teachers. The Saraswats
are a brahmin jati counted as one of the
five northern Indian brahmin commu-
nities (Pancha Gauda); the other four
are the Gaudas, the Kanaujias, the
Maithilas, and the Utkalas. Unlike most
other brahmin communities, which had
a well-defined core region, the Saraswats
are found in several widely separated
locations. One group lived in the
coastal region of Sindh in modern
Pakistan, although after Partition in
[[1947]]
 most of the group migrated to
Bombay. Another group was located in
prepartition Punjab, although here too
they have tended to migrate away from
the part of Punjab in modern Pakistan.
A third branch, known as the Gauda
Saraswats, is found on a narrow strip of
coastline in the southern Indian state
of Karnataka. The Saraswat communi-
ty takes its name from Saraswati,
patron goddess of speech and learning,
and, as a group, is famous for its erudi-
tion and piety.
[[601]]
Saraswati
A depiction of Saraswati, the goddess associated with art, aesthetics, learning, sacred speech, and wisdom.
Saraswati
Goddess associated with art, aesthetics,
learning, sacred speech, and wisdom.
Saraswati is the patron deity of culture
in all its manifestations. The spoken
word is considered very powerful in
Hindu culture and Saraswati can either
promote or frustrate one’s efforts by
conferring or withdrawing the ability to
[[602]]

speak clearly. Her association with
sacred speech goes back to the time of
the sacrificial manuals known as the
Brahmanas, in which the cult of sacri-
fice was based on the precise perfor-
mance of sacred speech and ritual.
Her iconography emphasizes her
connection with the life of the mind:
She holds a book, a crystal (symbolicSarmanochegas
of a purified mind), a vina (musical
instrument), and a rosary (associated
with religious rites, and particularly
with the repetition of the sacred
sounds known as mantras). Her ani-
mal vehicle is the swan, whose white
color is a symbol of purity and whose
high flight is a symbol of transcen-
dence. Through Saraswati’s blessings
(ashirvad) human beings can tran-
scend their biological condition to
create works of art and culture.
Saraswati is usually believed to be
married, although different mythic
sources give her different husbands. In
some cases she is described as the wife of
the god Brahma, the creator; here their
joint activity encompasses the formation
of the material world and its transforma-
tion through human cultural activity. In
other stories she is described as the wife
of the god Vishnu, and thus a co-wife of
Lakshmi. Here the realms of Lakshmi and
Saraswati can be seen as giving differing
messages about the “good things” in life—
while Lakshmi grants wealth and materi-
al prosperity, Saraswati brings wisdom
and culture. A popular Indian saying
reports that Saraswati’s devotee (bhakta)
will never make money, while a follower
of Lakshmi (whose vehicle is the owl) will
be “blind” to spiritual wisdom. For more
information on Saraswati and all the god-
desses of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Saraswati Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth-century
philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated by a
different name—in this case, Saraswati
(the patron goddess of learning and cul-
ture). Upon initiation, new members
are given this name as a surname to
their new ascetic names, thus allowing
for immediate group identification.
These ten “named” divisions of
Dashanami Sanyasis are divided into
four larger organizational groups. Each
group has its headquarters in one of the
four monastic centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya, as
well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Saraswati Dashanamis
belong to the Bhuriwara group, which is
affiliated with the Shringeri math in the
southern Indian town of Shringeri. The
Saraswati division is elite in that it is one
of the few that will initiate only brah-
mins (the other such divisions are
Ashrama, Tirtha, and part of the
Bharati order).
Saraswati River
One of the seven sacred rivers of India,
along with the Ganges, Yamuna,
Godavari, Narmada, Indus, and
Cauvery. The Saraswati is particularly
interesting because no one is sure exactly
where this river is located. A river by this
name is mentioned in the hymns of the
Vedas, the earliest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts, and thus the
Saraswati River would seem to have
been in the northeastern part of India,
in which these hymns are set. In modern
times a Saraswati River flows through
the northern Indian state of Haryana
and dries up in the desert of the state of
Rajasthan. Archaeologists have found
extensive settlements from the Indus
Valley civilization on its banks, indicat-
ing that in earlier times the river was an
active tributary of the Indus. Popular
belief holds that the Saraswati continues
to flow underground, and joins the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers at their con-
fluence in Allahabad. This reputed con-
fluence of three sacred rivers is the
source for one of the site’s names,
Triveni (“triple stream”).
Sarmanochegas
According to the Greek writer Strabo, the
name of an ascetic who was part of a
delegation sent to Athens by a king of
the Pandya dynasty, met by Augustus in
[[603]]
Sarvadarshanasangraha
Athens in 20 B.C.E. In Athens, Sarmano-
chegas, tired of a life of bondage on
earth, committed religious suicide by
burning himself on a pyre.
Sarvadarshanasangraha
(“Collection of all [philosophical]
views”) A philosophical encyclopedia
composed by Madhava in the late four-
teenth century. In this text, Madhava
compiled the views of all the existing
philosophical schools, which he placed
in hierarchical order, based on his judg-
ment of their truth value. The material-
ist schools were ranked the lowest and
least reliable since their proponents
completely denied the virtue of any reli-
gious life. After this came various
Buddhist schools, whose low standing
can be attributed to the widespread per-
ception that they were nihilists (nas-
tikas). Madhava then moves through
the various Hindu philosophical
schools, finishing with the Advaita
Vedanta school—his own—which was
judged the highest and most perfect
expression of the truth. Although the
Sarvadarshanasangraha is a polemical
text with a clear bias, it is one of the few
extant sources that considers the per-
spectives of all the existing schools.
Sarvam Idam Khalu Brahman
(“Truly, this universe is Brahman”) In
the Hindu philosophical tradition, one
of the “great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing the ultimate truth, here the
sameness of the individual Self (atman)
with the Supreme Reality (Brahman).
Sarvasvara
Sacrificial rite found in the Vedas, the
oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The most notable feature
of the sarvasvara is that it involved the
suicide of the sacrificer, who concluded
the rite by entering the sacrificial fire.
The sarvasvara is an extreme example
of the class of ritual actions known as
kamya karma, which consists of
action performed solely because of the
[[604]]

performer’s desire (kama) to obtain cer-
tain benefits. This element of desire
makes kamya karma different from the
other two classes of ritual action, nitya
karma and naimittika karma, which
were each in some way obligatory. The
sarvasvara could be undertaken to obtain
any outcome, such as birth in heaven as
a god, or rebirth in a royal family. The sac-
rificer declares the benefit in the part of
the rite called the samkalpa. Although
the sarvasvara had extreme elements, it
was completely voluntary.
Sashanka
(7th c.) King of Bengal who was an
ardent devotee (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and a fierce opponent of
Buddhism, which was deeply entrenched
in his domain. According to reliable
historical reports, Sashanka not only
persecuted the Buddhists themselves
but also tried to destroy the tree in
Bodh Gaya under which the Buddha
gained enlightenment. This is one of
the few well-documented cases of reli-
gious persecution.
Sat
In Indian philosophical thought, the
most basic denotation for “that which
(really and truly) exists.” The term is a
present participle of the verb “to be,” so
a fairly common translation is “Being,”
but the word also carries connotations
relating to the idea of Truth—that things
that exist are both “real” and “true.” Sat
is the first of the three attributes tradi-
tionally ascribed to the unqualified, ulti-
mate Brahman as sacchidananda,
along with consciousness (chit) and
bliss (ananda).
Satavahana Dynasty
Central Indian dynasty whose core area
was in the Deccan plateau in the west-
ern state of Maharashtra, and whose
capital was in the city of Paithan. The
Satavahana dynasty was at its peak from
the first to the third centuries, when it
ruled an area spanning the modernSati
states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra
Pradesh. It was in the Satavahana
domains that the first cave temples were
constructed in the chaitya and vihara
architectural styles, which paved the
way for later architectural forms.
Satguru
(“true guru”) In the sant religious tradi-
tion, an epithet (label) that can refer
either to the Supreme Being or to a gen-
uinely realized religious teacher,
through whose instruction a disciple
attains the Supreme Being. The sants
were a loose group of central and north-
ern Indian poet-saints who lived
between the fifteenth and seventeenth
centuries and who shared several general
tendencies: stress on individualized
and interior religion, leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; disdain
for external ritual, particularly image
worship; faith in the power of the divine
Name; and a tendency to ignore con-
ventional caste distinctions. Many of
the sants, particularly in northern India,
thought of the divine as without quali-
ties (nirguna) and beyond human pow-
ers of conception. Given these aniconic
and occasionally iconoclastic tenden-
cies, it is not surprising that the sant tra-
dition highlights the importance of the
spiritual teacher (guru), since the guru’s
human form is the only image that a dis-
ciple has to work with. In human form,
the satguru guides the disciple’s spiritual
practice and thus becomes the vehicle
for spiritual attainment. Yet a true guru,
according to the tradition, always
remains a servant rather than a master,
maintaining and transmitting the teach-
ing of his or her particular lineage. The
sant notion of the satguru has been
adopted into many modern Hindu
movements, most notably the Radha
Soami Satsang.
Sathya Sai Baba
(b. Satya Narayana Peddi Venkappa
Raju, 1926) Modern Hindu teacher and
religious figure who presides as religious
teacher (guru) over millions of devotees
(bhakta), both Indian and foreign. He
was born in the small village of
Puttaparthi in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, where his main ashram is still
located. He first claimed to be an incar-
nation of Shirdi Sai Baba, a
Maharashtrian saint, at thirteen—a
move that gave him religious authority
and obviated the need to accept a
human guru and a spiritual lineage.
Sathya Sai Baba has since stated that he
will be reincarnated a third time, thus
eliminating awkward questions about a
successor. His fame rests upon his sup-
posed magic powers, particularly the
ability to heal and to materialize objects
from thin air. Sai Baba has many mid-
dle- and upper-class Indian devotees,
whom he obliges to perform service
(seva) to others. Some observers are
highly skeptical about his reputed pow-
ers and about Sai Baba in general. For
further information see Lawrence Babb,
“Sathya Sai Baba’s Saintly Play,” in John
Stratton Hawley (ed.), Saints and
Virtues, 1987; “Sathya Sai Baba and the
Lesson of Trust,” in Redemptive
Encounters, 1987; and “Sathya Sai Baba’s
Miracles,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
Sati
Hindu goddess, daughter of the demigod
Daksha and wife of the god Shiva, whose
death and dismemberment are pivotal
incidents in the mythology of both Shiva
and the Goddess. According to legend,
after Sati marries Shiva, her father Daksha
feels that Shiva has not shown him proper
respect and develops bad feelings toward
him. Inflated with pride, Daksha plans a
great sacrifice to which he invites all the
gods but deliberately excludes Shiva.
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she
insists that she wants to go, since it is in
her natal home. Shiva, after trying to dis-
courage her by pointing out that one
should not go without an invitation, final-
ly gives her his permission. When Sati
arrives at the sacrificial grounds and asks
[[605]]
Satkaryavada
Daksha why he has excluded her hus-
band, Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, excoriating Shiva as worthless and
despicable. Humiliated by these public
insults, Sati commits suicide—in some
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial fire,
in others by withdrawing into yogic trance
and giving up her life.
Shiva, furious at what has happened,
creates the fierce deity Virabhadra (or
in some versions, Virabhadra and the
fierce goddess Bhadrakali), and dis-
patches them to destroy Daksha’s sacri-
fice. They gleefully carry out his com-
mand, scattering the guests and killing
Daksha. The resulting carnage ends only
when the assembled gods praise Shiva
as the supreme deity. Daksha is eventu-
ally restored to life with the head of a
goat, and he too repents his arrogance
and worships Shiva. At Daksha’s request,
Shiva agrees to remain at the sacrificial
site forever and sanctify it. Shiva takes
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is his symbolic form, and can
still be seen at the Daksha Mahadev
temple in the town of Kankhal.
Although Shiva’s anger has been
pacified by this worship, he is disconso-
late at Sati’s death and wanders the
earth carrying her body on his shoul-
ders. In his grief, Shiva neglects his
divine functions, and the world begins
to fall into ruin. The gods, concerned
over the world’s imminent destruction,
go to the god Vishnu for help. Vishnu
then follows behind Shiva and uses his
razor-sharp discus to gradually cut away
pieces of Sati’s body, until finally there is
nothing left. When the body is com-
pletely gone, Shiva leaves for the moun-
tains, where he remains absorbed in
meditation until it is broken by Kama.
Sati is reborn as the goddess Parvati and
later remarries Shiva.
The myth connected with the figure
of Sati is important for several reasons.
First, it provides the charter myth for the
Shakti Pithas (“bench of the Goddess”),
a network of sites sacred to the Goddess
that spreads throughout the subconti-
nent. Each of these Shakti Pithas—
in some lists there are fifty-one, and in
[[606]]

others 108—marks the site where a part
of Sati’s body fell to earth, taking form
there as a different goddess. These
differing goddesses, spread all over the
subcontinent, are thus seen as manifes-
tations of this one primordial goddess,
united by the symbolism of the human
body. Aside from establishing this network,
the myth has several other important
messages: It graphically illustrates the
supremacy of devotion (in this case, to
Shiva) over the older sacrificial cult; it
illustrates some of the tensions in the
joint family, in which women feel the
conflict of loyalty between their natal
and their marital homes; and it is the
charter myth for the Daksha Mahadev
temple in the town of Kankhal, just
south of the sacred city of Haridwar,
where Daksha’s sacrifice is claimed to
have taken place. See also pitha.
Satkaryavada
One of the three causal models in Indian
philosophy, along with asatkaryavada
and anekantavada. All three models seek
to explain the relationship between causes
and their effects in the everyday world,
which has profound implications for reli-
gious life. All the philosophical schools
assume that if one understands the causal
process correctly, and can manipulate it
through one’s conscious actions, it is possi-
ble to gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Thus, disagreements over dif-
ferent causal models are not merely acade-
mic disputes but are grounded in basically
different assumptions about the nature of
things. The satkaryavada model assumes
that effects preexist in their causes, which
can thus be seen as transformations (real
or apparent) of those causes. The classic
example is the transformation of milk to
curds, butter, and clarified butter.
According to satkaryavada proponents,
each of these effects was already present in
the cause, and emerges from it through a
natural transformation of that cause.
This causal model tends to reduce the
number of causes in the universe, since
anything can be seen as a transforma-
tion of other things. Given these strongSatsang

relationships, if one can understand how
these relationships work, they can be
manipulated to one’s advantage. The dis-
advantage of this model is that it can lead
to fatalism. In a world in which everything
occurs through natural transformation, it
can seem as if the universe is running
under its own power, and that human
actions may not be able to influence such
strong relationships. The philosophical
schools espousing this model are the
Samkhyas, proponents of Bhedabhada,
Ramanuja’s Vishishthadvaita Vedanta,
and the various branches of Advaita
Vedanta. The first three believe that the
difference between cause and effect is a
genuine transformation of the cause,
whereas the Advaita school stresses that
this transformation is only apparent, and
that the real source of bondage (and liber-
ation) lies in avidya, the fundamental lack
of understanding that causes one to mis-
perceive the nature of things. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.), Pre-
suppositions of India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Satkhyati
(“discrimination of the real”) Theory of
error propounded by Ramanuja, the
eleventh century philosopher who was
the founder of Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta. This theory is also known as
yathakhyati (“discrimination [of things]
as they are”). All the theories of error aim
to explain why people make errors in
judgment, the stock example being mis-
taking the silvery flash of sea shell for a
piece of silver. Ramanuja’s analysis is
based on the understanding that all
things are composed of the five ele-
ments, and that the different propor-
tions of the elements account for their
differences. The viewer is correct in per-
ceiving the silvery flash, since this is a
property shared by both shell and silver.
The error comes in supposing that the
object is silver—that is, taking the part
of the judgment that is true, and making
an incorrect assumption based on that.
As for some of the other theories, the
ultimate reason one “sees” silver and
not other silvery things comes from
karmic dispositions stemming from
avidya, specifically the greed for silver
that prompts us to look for such items of
value. For further information see
Bijayananda Kar, Theories of Error in
Indian Philosophy, 1978; Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s Philo-
sophies, 1972.
Satsang
(“company of the good”) Quasi-con-
gregational meeting and worship that
was particularly emphasized in devo-
tional (bhakti) religious life as a way to
[[607]]
Sattan
associate with fellow devotees (bhakta).
The word covers an enormous range of
activities and contexts, from an informal
gathering for singing and conversation
in someone’s home, to highly orches-
trated meetings in which a guru may
preach to thousands of devotees, and
anything in between. In all these cases
the importance of satsang lies in the
wholesome religious atmosphere gener-
ated by the presence of good people,
which is believed to create beneficial
effects in terms of reinforcing one’s own
good qualities and reforming one’s
faults.
Sattan
(7th c.) Tamil poet who was the author
of the Manimegalai, a text that
was clearly written as a sequel to the
earlier poem “The Jeweled Anklet”
(Shilappadigaram). Sattan’s story
focuses on a young woman named
Manimegalai, who was wooed by the
local prince but eventually became a
Buddhist nun. Although the story’s bias
clearly favors the Buddhists, the
Manimegalai has numerous debates
with people from competing religious
traditions, thus giving a rounded if
somewhat subjective picture of contem-
porary religious life. See also Tamil epics
and Tamil language.
Sattva
(“goodness”) One of the three funda-
mental qualities (gunas) believed to
be present in all things. The other two
gunas are rajas (“passion”) and tamas
(“darkness”). According to this model,
the differing proportions of these
qualities account for the differences
between the properties of concrete
things, and in individual human
capacities and tendencies. Of the
three, sattva is invariably positive and
carries associations with goodness,
truth, wholesomeness, health, cogni-
tive thought, and deep-rooted reli-
gious life. The notion of these three
gunas originated in the metaphysics of
[[608]]

the Samkhya school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. Although much of Samkhya
metaphysics connected with the
gunas have been long discredited, the
idea of the gunas and their qualities
has become a pervasive assumption in
Indian culture.
Saturday
(Shanivar) The sixth day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is Saturn
(Shani). Saturn is by far the most feared
of all the planets, and Saturday is con-
sidered by far the most inauspicious day
of the week. In Hindu iconography,
Saturn is depicted as a terrifying black
figure holding a sword and riding a buf-
falo; he is also considered easily affront-
ed and extremely thorough in avenging
any offenses. Any misfortune Saturn
brings will last for fourteen years—a fig-
ure doubtless drawn from the fourteen
years of Saturn’s orbit.
Hindus counter this danger by avoid-
ance and rites of protection, just as they
do on Tuesday, the other day consid-
ered to be generally inauspicious.
Movements and activities are often
widely restricted on Saturday, and cer-
tain activities, in particular buying
things made from iron (whose black
color is associated with Saturn), are
avoided except when absolutely neces-
sary. As on Tuesday, people worship
protective deities and give as charity
(dana) items associated with Saturn:
iron, mustard oil, black sesame seed,
black cloth, and black lentils. Giving
away such items associated with Saturn
is believed to transfer any potential
inauspiciousness from Saturn to the
recipient, providing a way to get rid of
one’s bad luck.
Saturn
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a
strongly malevolent planet associated
with obstruction and death. Saturn’s
power and malevolent nature make
him extremely dangerous, particularlySatyavan
since any misfortune he brings will
last for fourteen years—a figure
doubtless drawn from the fourteen
years of Saturn’s orbit. During the
week Saturn presides over Saturday,
considered by far the most inauspi-
cious day of the week. On this day
people refrain from numerous activi-
ties and also commonly perform rites
of protection, such as giving alms
(dana) as a way to give away any
potential misfortune.
Satyabhama
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives
of the god Krishna, when he has
assumed his kingly station as the
ruler of Dwaraka.
Satyakama
(“He whose desire is truth”) Legendary
figure in the early speculative text
Chandogya Upanishad, renowned for
his adherence to the truth. Desiring to
take initiation as a celibate student
(brahmacharin), Satyakama asks his
mother about his extended family, so
that he can have this information to give
his teacher. His mother Jabala replies
that she does not know who his father is
and tells him to take her name, and call
himself Satyakama Jabala. Satyakama,
when asked by his teacher Gautama to
tell about his family roots, tells the
whole story. Impressed by his honesty,
Gautama initiates him at once. This
story is often cited in modern times, to
emphasize the importance of one’s
actions over one’s birth.
Satyagraha
(“Holding Fast to the Truth”)
Organized campaign of nonviolent
resistance or non-cooperation as a
political tool, a technique best refined
by Mohandas K. Gandhi. For Gandhi
himself, the basis of this technique
was rooted in his commitment to the
truth and his conviction that his oppo-
nents could be swayed by the power of
truth, if it was put before them.
Gandhi’s satyagraha campaigns would
begin by publicly pointing out the
injustice in question, in the hope that
this alone could lead to the matter
being rectified. If nothing was done, a
campaign would then begin, but the
adversary would always be informed
of what was to happen next. The real
goal was not to humble the adversary
but to persuade the other party to see
the rightness of one’s position and to
accept it. The most important thing of
all was to retain one’s own commit-
ment to the truth and never to com-
promise it, even if doing so could gain
one some immediate advantage. For
Gandhi, in the end the truth was the
only thing that mattered, and winning
or losing could only be measured inso-
far as one kept this in perspective.
Satyanarayan Vrat
Religious observance that may be
observed any day of the month but is
most commonly performed on the day
of the full moon. The presiding deity is
Vishnu, worshiped in his form as
Satyanarayan (“Lord of Truth”). The rite
is believed to destroy evil and to pro-
mote the prosperity of its sponsors
(those who hire a brahmin to perform
the rite), its performers, and even its
hearers. The rite’s major features involve
modification of diet and worship, the
two general characteristics of most
Hindu religious observances. On the day
this rite is performed, the observant
must keep a strict fast (upavasa) until
the ceremony is over. A pavilion is pre-
pared in which an image of Satya-
narayan is installed and worshiped (part
of the worship includes reading the rite’s
charter myth), and after which prasad is
given to all those present.
Satyavan
In Hindu mythology, the husband of
Savitri, a woman famous both for her
devotion to her husband and for her
cleverness in outwitting Death to regain
her husband after he dies.
[[609]]
Satyavati
Satyavati
In Hindu mythology, the mother of the
sage Vyasa. Satyavati is born in an
unusual way. Her mother, a celestial
nymph who lives as a fish in the
Ganges as the result of a curse, one
day swallows some semen that has
fallen into the Ganges, becomes preg-
nant, and delivers a son and a daugh-
ter. Satyavati grows into a beautiful
young woman, but because of her ori-
gins she always smells of fish, and
because of this is also called
Matsyagandhi (“fish-scent”). She
works ferrying passengers across the
Ganges and one day ferries the sage
Parashara, who is struck by her
charms. Parashara creates an artificial
fog to give the two of them privacy, has
sexual relations with her, and grants
that from that day onward Satyavati
will smell of musk instead of fish. The
son born of this union is Vyasa.
Satyavati continues to ply her trade,
and one day ferries King Shantanu, who
is also struck by her beauty. Before she
will marry him she demands that her sons
will rule Shantanu’s kingdom. Shantanu
agrees; and to give her absolute certainty,
his son Bhishma takes a vow that he will
never marry, so that his line will never
compete with hers. Satyavati has two
sons: Chitrangada dies in childhood, and
Vichitravirya dies after he marries the
princesses Ambika and Ambalika but
before having any children. In despera-
tion, Satyavati thinks of her first son
Vyasa, who conceives a son with each of
the wives: Pandu from Ambalika, and
Dhrtarashtra from Ambika. The descen-
dants of these two sons are the warring
families
in
the
Sanskrit epic
Mahabharata, of which Vyasa is famed as
the narrator.
Saumya
(“mild”) Term used to refer to the
deities in their benevolent, beneficent,
and gentle manifestations, as opposed
to their terrifying (ghora) manifesta-
tions. This distinction is particularly
applicable to Shiva and the Goddess,
[[610]]

both of whom can appear in either
form and whose worship can focus on
either aspect.
Saundaryalahari
(“waves of beauty”) Poetic text dedicat-
ed to the praise of the Goddess as the
supreme power in the universe. The text
is traditionally ascribed to the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya, who is also
believed to have written other hymns in
praise of Hindu gods and goddesses,
despite being the greatest exponent of
the philosophical school known as
Advaita Vedanta, in which the Supreme
Reality, called Brahman, is believed to
be completely devoid of specific attrib-
utes. If Shankaracharya did in fact
author these poetic texts, one possible
explanation is that Shankaracharya was
an intensely religious man and
expressed this devotion in various ways.
The text has been an enormously influ-
ential, particularly in those schools of
tantra (a secret, ritually based religious
practice) in which the Goddess is con-
sidered the single Ultimate Reality.
Savaiya
Syllabic meter in Hindi poetry, com-
posed of four lines of between twenty-
two and twenty-six syllables each. Its
loose form gives the poet some flexibility,
but the challenges of working with such
an extended meter place considerable
demands on the poet’s skill, making this
one of the more “literary” meters.
Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar
(1883–1966) Hindu nationalist leader
and thinker whose ideas have had last-
ing influence. Savarkar spent his entire
life opposing British rule, often by violent
means. He was also virulently opposed to
Muslims, whom he saw as invaders and
intruders in the Indian homeland. After
being expelled from college for organizing
a political rally, he spent four years in
London, where he and his compatriots
learned bomb-making and planned
political assassinations. In 1911 he wasSavitr
the Hindus were a nation, despite all of
their differences—social, regional, cul-
tural, linguistic, and religious—because
for them India was their motherland,
fatherland, and holy land. He called on
Hindus to transcend the particular iden-
tities that divided them and to gain
strength through unity to resist the
oppression of outsiders. Sarvarkar’s for-
mulation equates Hinduism and Indian
nationalism and thus marginalizes both
Muslims and Christians as “outsiders.”
His ideas profoundly influenced Dr.
K. B. Hedgewar, founder of the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
The RSS and its affiliates have continued
to stress some of Savarkar’s ideas, which,
during the 1990s, have gained a national
audience with the rise of the RSS-affiliated
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). For further
information see Lise McKean, Divine
Enterprise, 1996; and Christophe
Jaffrelot, The Hindu Nationalist Movement
in India, 1996.

sentenced to life imprisonment in the
Andaman Islands but was released
because of political pressure in 1924,
although he was barred from politics
until 1937. In the time after that he
served for seven years as president of
the Hindu Mahasabha, until failing
health finally forced him to resign.
Throughout his life he had sharp differ-
ences with Mohandas Gandhi, first
over the latter’s commitment to nonvi-
olence and later over the partition of
India, which Savarkar characterized as
the “vivisection” of the Indian mother-
land. Savarkar was brought to trial
when Gandhi was assassinated by one
of his former associates, Nathuram
Godse. Savarkar was acquitted, but the
accusation had a negative affect on the
rest of his life.
Savarkar’s keynote work, Hindutva ,
was composed and committed to mem-
ory while he was imprisoned in the
Andamans. His central thesis was that
Savikalpika
(“with conceptions”) In certain schools
of Indian philosophy—among some
Buddhists, the Nyayas, and the
Prabhakara school of Mimamsa—a
term referring to complex conceptual
knowledge in which the mind puts
together and interprets data from the
senses or from memory. Since such
knowledge involves the activity of the
mind, it is susceptible to error. The
opposite sort of knowledge, called
nirvikalpaka, nonconceptual aware-
ness, is produced directly by the opera-
tion of the senses without any interpre-
tation. According to these schools, if the
senses producing this awareness have
no defect, such an awareness is true.
Savitr
(“generator”) Epithet of Surya, the sun,
in his aspect as the progenitor and nour-
isher of all things. This particular name
appears in the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred
formula whose daily recitation is
required of all twice-born men.
[[611]]
Savitri
According to the dharma literature, a
twice-born man was one born into the
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya com-
munities, who was thus eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth.” See Surya.
Savitri
In Indian culture, a mythic figure and
the model for a virtuous and faithful
wife, who by her cleverness is able to
rescue her husband Satyavan from the
clutches of Death himself. Before Savitri
is betrothed to Satyavan, she has been
told that he will die within a year. Savitri
replies that she has chosen him for her
husband and will not be deterred. On
the day that he is fated to die, Satyavan
goes to the forest to cut wood, accompa-
nied by Savitri. After Satyavan falls
unconscious while working, Savitri sees
Yama, the god of Death, draw out
Satyavan’s soul and start his journey
back to the underworld. Savitri follows
them. When Yama tells her that she can-
not follow where they are going, she
meekly replies that it is her wifely duty
to follow her husband. Yama grants her
some wishes, although she is forbidden
to ask for her husband’s life. Savitri first
requests that her blind father-in-law
shall regain his sight, then that he shall
regain the kingdom from which he has
been exiled, and finally that she shall
have many sons. All of these requests
are granted, and when she points out
that the return of her husband will be
necessary for her to have many sons,
Yama acknowledges that he has been
outwitted, and leaves the two of them to
many happy years together.
ensure them a long married life. As a
woman whose entire energies were
directed toward the well-being of her
family, Savitri is a cultural model for
Indian women; her ability to save her hus-
band from death demonstrates her virtue
and cleverness as well. Women observing
this rite worship Savitri, Satyavan, and
Yama; keep a strict fast (upavasa) before
the worship; and after worship eat only
fruit for the rest of the day.
Sayana
(14th c.) A southern Indian brahmin
scholar most famous for his commen-
taries on the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts.
Sayana’s commentary is notable, in part
because it is an outstanding scholarly
work, but also because this is generally
believed to be the first time that the Veda
was ever written down, an estimated
three thousand years after some of the
hymns were composed. Part of Sayana’s
commentary was simply explanatory
because, in the time since the Vedas had
been composed, the meanings of many
of the words had been forgotten.
Sayana’s text is noted as a careful and
credible clarification of the text.
Sculpture
Branch of the visual arts most important
in Hindu religion for its use as
decoration in architecture and in the
construction of images of Hindu deities
for worship. Both these sculptural forms
were regulated by precisely defined
canons. See also shilpa shastra.
Seasons
Savitri Puja
Religious observance on the new moon in
the lunar month of Jyeshth (May–June),
celebrating the virtue of Savitri, who res-
cued her husband Satyavan from the
clutches of Yama, the god of Death. This
observance is usually kept only by
women, to promote the health and
longevity of their husbands, and thus
[[612]]

According to the most traditional enu-
meration, there are six seasons, each
spanning two lunar months: Vasanta
(spring) in the lunar months of Chaitra
and Baisakh; Grishma (hot season) in
Jyeshth and Ashadh; Varsha (rains) in
Shravan and Bhadrapada; Sharad (fall)
in Ashvin and Kartik; Hemanta (winter)
in Margashirsha and Paush; andSelf-Residence
Shishira (late winter) in Magh and
Phalgun. In actual practice, there are
three major seasons, at least in northern
India: the hot season (April–June), the
monsoon ( July–September), and the
cool season (October–March). All these
seasons are approximate, because they
are ultimately determined by larger cli-
matic phenomena. In the hot season the
sun bakes the northern Indian plains,
eventually setting in motion air currents
that suck moist air north from the
Indian ocean; the resulting monsoons
break the heat and provide rain for the
crops. The weather then gets gradually
cooler until January, when it becomes
gradually hotter until the hot season
returns. The monsoon arrives at differ-
ent times in different parts of the coun-
try—earlier to regions further south,
later to regions further north—and at
times the monsoons are sporadic or do
not come at all. Each of these three sea-
sons has general correlations with cer-
tain festivals.
The hot season is a time of gradually
increasing heat, and many of the festi-
vals during this time have associations
with heat: Holi, Navaratri, Ram
Navami, Shitalashtami, and Ganga
Dashahara. Although the rising heat
can make life difficult, it is considered a
generally auspicious time.
The rainy season is a time of both
physical and ritual danger. The sudden
influx of rain drives venomous animals
such as snakes and scorpions from their
holes, and their search for other habita-
tions often brings them into contact with
human beings. On a bacteriological level,
the runoff from the rains often leads to
the contamination of water supplies by
sewage and to a sharp rise in sickness and
death from gastrointestinal ailments, as
well as other infections. On the ritual
level, the gods are considered to be sleep-
ing during part of the rainy season and
thus less available to protect their devo-
tees (bhakta). At the same time, the com-
ing of the rains is greatly anticipated, and
the moisture is essential for crops to grow.
Consequently, although this is a time of
great fertility and abundance, it is also
associated with danger, and some of the
festivals are rites of protection: Nag
Panchami, Raksha Bandhan, Ganesh
Chaturthi, Anant Chaturdashi, and the
Pitrpaksha. Other ceremonies are associ-
ated with water or with the rains, such as
the Shravan festival and Janmashtami.
In the cool season the gods awaken
from their sleep, and crops that have been
fed by the rains are ready for harvest. This
is the most ritually active time of the year,
and is generally auspicious. Major festivals
include the fall Navaratri, ending with the
festival of Dussehra (Vijaya Dashami),
Diwali, Karva Chauth, Kartik Purnima,
Makara Sankranti, and Shivaratri. The
last major festival of the year is Holi, which
marks the unofficial beginning of the hot
season. In ending with Holi, a festival cel-
ebrating license, excess, and the dissolu-
tion of all social boundaries, followed by
an abrupt reestablishment of propriety
and social order, the lunar year thus mir-
rors the cycle of the cosmos, which is sub-
ject to degeneration and periodic renewal.
Seed Syllable
A syllable, or set of syllables, that are
believed to have an intimate connection
with a deity—either as a way of gaining
access to the deity’s power or as the sub-
tlest form of the deity itself. They are
seed syllables in that they contain the
deity in its briefest form, just as a seed
contains the potential for a plant. These
seed syllables are called bijaksharas.
See bijakshara.
Self-Residence
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies
in constructing an argument. Self-
residence occurs when the cause and
effect are believed to be the same thing.
Although the simplest forms of this
fallacy are almost never found, since
it is so patently unconvincing, one does
find extended forms of it, such as recip-
rocal dependence, vicious circle, and
infinite regress.

Self-Revealing Knowledge
Self-Revealing KnowledgeSen
In Indian philosophy, the notion
that certain things, such as knowledge,
are self-revealing and do not need
proof or substantiation to be known.
Whether such knowledge (or things)
exists, and what they would be if
they did, was a source of lively
disagreement among Indian thinkers.
See svaprakasha.(15th c.) Poet and saint of the Varkari
Panth, a religious community centered
around the worship of the Hindu god
Vithoba. According to tradition, Sen was
a barber—a very low-caste occupa-
tion—at the court of the king of Bidar.
Sen renounced this occupation to wan-
der and sing Vithoba’s praises. Little is
known about him, but he is mentioned
as a model of devotion in one of the
hymns by the northern Indian poet-
saint Ravidas, which indicates that he
was well known outside Maharashtra.
For traditional hagiography, see Justin
Abbott and Narhar R. Godbole, Stories of
Indian Saints, 1988.
Self-Validating Knowledge
In Indian philosophy, a name denoting
a sort of knowledge believed to carry
its own stamp of truth, which does
not need to be verified by anything
outside itself. See svatahpramanya.
Semen
As with all bodily fluids, semen is consid-
ered to make a person ritually impure
through emission or contact, although it is
obviously necessary for procreation,
which is an auspicious event. Semen is
also considered the concentrated essence
of a man’s vital energy, distilled drop by
drop from his blood; in Hindu mythology
the semen from the gods is portrayed as
having wondrous generative powers, as in
the story of the god Skanda, who sponta-
neously developed when the god Shiva’s
semen fell on the ground. Although a mar-
ried man is obliged to have intercourse
with his wife at certain times during her
menstrual cycle, this is also seen as a
potentially dangerous depletion of his
vital energy. Since in Indian culture
women are seen as having stronger sex
drives than men, men are faced with the
constant demand on their resources,
which must be carefully husbanded to
maintain their vitality. This problem of
depletion is particularly pronounced in
the unusual case when a man is younger
than his wife, for in that case her needs are
believed to be far greater than his capaci-
ty. Because all seminal emission depletes
one’s vital forces, there are strict taboos on
masturbation, which is seen not only as an
abject surrender to one’s baser instincts,
but as posing actual physical danger.

Sen, Keshub Chander
(d. 1884) Reformist Hindu and leader of
the Brahmo Samaj, to which he gave most
of his life. His emphases on the ideal of eth-
ical monotheism and rejection of many rit-
uals were heavily influenced by English
Unitarianism. In 1865, the Samaj split over
Keshub’s insistence that members should
no longer wear the sacred thread. Then in
[[1878]]
 Keshub had an inexplicable lapse in
principles when he arranged for the mar-
riage of his thirteen year-old daughter.
Most of his followers left him in protest,
and he spent his remaining years creating
what he called the New Dispensation, a
new religion using elements drawn from
various religious traditions. At his death he
had few followers but had been influential
through his earlier efforts to reform Hindu
society, and to look critically at Christian
culture and religion. In his curiosity for reli-
gious ideas, he happened to meet the
Bengali mystic Ramakrishna, and it was
through association with Keshub that
Ramakrishna began to attract disciples
from Calcutta’s middle class, most notably
Narendranath Datta, who became famous
as Swami Vivekananda.

pendent in 1097 and later seized much
of the Pala domain in Bihar. The Sena
dynasty survived until 1245, when it was
finally conquered by the Mamluks, who
had been seizing Sena territory since the
beginning of that century. The Senas
(and their predecessors, the Palas) are
particularly noted for a certain type of
sculpture in which the images were
carved from black chlorite schist that
was polished to a mirror finish.
Setubandha
(“Building the Bridge”) Early medieval
poem whose theme is taken from the
epic Ramayana and describes Rama’s
invasion of Lanka by building a bridge
across the ocean straits. The poem is
written in Prakrit, an umbrella term for
the grammatically simpler vernacular
languages that developed from Sanskrit
through natural linguistic change. The
poem has been falsely ascribed to
Kalidasa, the greatest Sanskrit poet. The
true author is unknown.
Seva
(“service”) Actions springing from an
attitude of loving devotion, manifested
as attendance on and service to a deity,
religious teacher (guru), or any superior
person. The notion of seva is particularly
important in the relationship between
religious teacher and disciple. The
teacher’s task is to further the disciple’s
spiritual development, which may
sometimes entail harsh criticism to
reform some of the disciple’s faults. The
ideal disciple will accept such direction
in a spirit of self-effacement and carry
out the teacher’s instructions faithfully
and without protest, as a sign of submis-
sion and service. Such arrangements are
often necessary for spiritual growth, and
a teacher can often give a much more
objective assessment of the disciple’s
true spiritual state and what must be
done for advancement. Still, when one
of the parties is not sincere, this model
has great potential for abuse. In such
circumstances the teacher’s call for obe-
dience and service—in which any “resis-
tance” to the teacher’s demands can be
cited as a sign of spiritual immaturity—
can be a way to take advantage of a
devotee (bhakta).
Sevagram
(“service village”) City in the eastern
part of the state of Maharashtra about
fifty miles south and west of Nagpur. It
is most famous for the ashram estab-
lished there by Mohandas K. Gandhi in
[[1933]]
, which was founded to promote his
[[615]]
Seven Sacred Cities
ideal of a decentralized village economy.
This economic model had political
and cultural symbolism, since it was
independent of the industrialized econ-
omy run by the British and intended to
counterbalance it by providing a model
of an economy based on indigenous
“Hindu” values.
Seven Sacred Cities
Seven sacred cities (tirthas) spread
throughout the Indian subcontinent
in which death is traditionally
believed to bring final liberation of the
soul (moksha). The seven cities are
Ayodhya,
Mathura,
Haridwar,
Benares, Kanchipuram, Ujjain, and
Dwaraka.
Shabara
In the Purva Mimamsa school of
Hindu philosophy Shabara was the
author of the earliest and most famous
commentary on Jaimini’s Mimamsa
Sutras, the school’s founding text. The
commentary is called Shabara-
bhashya. The date of the text is highly
uncertain, and estimates range from
the first century B.C.E. to the fourth or
sixth century C.E. As often happens,
later commentators have accepted
Shabara’s commentary as part of the
text itself and commented on it as well
as on the original sutras.
Shabarabhashya
(“Shabara’s commentary”) Extensive
commentary on the Mimamsa Sutras
of Jaimini, the founding text of the
Purva Mimamsa school of philoso-
phy. The date of the text is uncertain.
It is believed to have been written by
Shabara in either the first century
B. C . E ., or the fourth or sixth century
C . E . As often happens, later commen-
tators have accepted Shabara’s com-
mentary as part of the text itself and
commented on it as well as on the
original sutras.
[[616]]

Shabari
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, a tribal woman
who is a sincere devotee (bhakta) of
the god Rama. Shabari belongs to a
group known as the Shabaras, and so
her name conveys a sense of anonymi-
ty, since it is simply the feminine form
of the group’s name. Rama and
Lakshmana stop for some time at
Shabari’s dwelling during their search
for Rama’s kidnapped wife Sita.
Although as a tribal she has very low
social status, Rama graciously receives
her hospitality as a reward for the
devotion with which it is given. In the
Ramcharitmanas , the vernacular
retelling of the Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
Shabari tastes each fruit before she
gives it to Rama, to be sure that he will
get only the very sweetest—an act that
violates one of the most pervasive rit-
ual taboos barring the exchange of any
food that has come into contact with
saliva, and particularly from lower to
higher status people. Yet in the story
Rama eats the fruits very happily
because of the love with which they
are given. The message in this episode
is consistent with a primary theme in
the Ramcharitmanas, namely, the
power of devotion to override or over-
turn conventional social norms. Soon
after Rama and Lakshmana’s visit,
Shabari dies a happy death.
Shabari Malai
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
hills of the southern state of Kerala,
about seventy miles north of Trivan-
drum. Shabari Malai is renowned for the
temple to Aiyappa, a regional divinity
who has been assimilated into the larger
pantheon as the son of the gods Vishnu
and Shiva; he is born when Vishnu takes
the form of the enchantress Mohini.
Shabari Malai’s annual month-long pil-
grimage occurs from the middle of
December to the middle of January, with
the exact dates determined by astrologi-
cal calculations.Shaiva
This pilgrimage is most often taken
by men, since, according to the charter
myth, the site is forbidden to women
of childbearing age. The pilgrimage
itself is a highly structured ritual
process. Pilgrims carry out their spiri-
tual training for the journey in well-
defined village groups, each headed by
a local leader, who supervises their
strict religious discipline. Their
preparatory vows commence forty-five
to sixty days before the actual journey
begins, and entail strict celibacy and
avoiding the company of women, dis-
tinctive dress, a ban on shaving and
wearing shoes, a strict vegetarian diet,
daily worship, and the erasing of all
social and status distinctions among
members. In essence, the men training
for this pilgrimage live as renunciant
ascetics for this period and later revert
to their normal identities. The pilgrim-
age itself is an arduous and exhausting
journey over the twisted ridges of the
Periyar Hills, during which pilgrims
symbolically divest themselves of their
egos, to be filled with the grace of God.

Shabari Malai pilgrimage, see E.

heavens, the course of the soul after
death, proper religious life, and so
forth. With regard to the liberation of
the soul, it is often the most important
pramana, since this cannot be discov-
ered in any other way.
Shabdabrahman
(“Brahman-as-sound”) This term
refers to the notion that the Supreme
Reality (Brahman) exists in its most
subtle form, not as matter, but as
sound. This idea is particularly preva-
lent in tantra, a secret, ritually based
system of religious practice, and helps
to explain the tantric stress on
mantra, or sacred sound, as the essen-
tial means through which one gains
access to this reality. In this under-
standing, the primary mantra (mula-
mantra) of one’s particular deity
would be the clearest articulation of
shabdabrahman, with other mantras
conceived as derivative forms of
that primary mantra; these latter
mantras were the source for everyday
speech and the mundane sounds of
ordinary experience.
Shachi
Shabda
(“word”) In Indian philosophy, the
general term for authoritative testimo-
ny. This is generally accepted as one of
the pramanas, the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge, except by the materi-
alists, who reject all pramanas except
perception
(pratyaksha).
Such
authoritative testimony is of two sorts.
It most often refers to authoritative
scriptural texts, such as the Vedas, but
it can also refer to verbal instruction
given by one’s guru, which is consid-
ered to have equal authority, at least
by members of that spiritual lineage.
Shabda is an important pramana
because it tells people about those
things that the other pramanas cannot
uncover, such as the nature of the
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the god
Indra, also known as Indrani. See
Indrani.
Shaddarshana
(“six perspectives”) Collective name for
the six schools of classical Hindu phi-
losophy. These six were usually grouped
in three pairs: Nyaya and Vaisheshika,
Samkhya and Yoga, and Purva Mim-
amsa and Vedanta. See six schools.
Shaiva
Devotee (bhakta) of the Hindu
god Shiva, who along with Vishnu is
one of the major figures in the
Hindu pantheon. From the evidence at
hand, it seems that the earliest
sectarian
Shaivites
were
the
Kapalikas,
Kalamukhas,
and
[[617]]
Shaiva Nagas
Pashupatas. All three of these were
communities of renunciant ascetics,
perhaps to accord with the example
set by their patron deity. The informa-
tion for all three must be reconstruct-
ed, since the sects have all disap-
peared. Shaivas can still be found in
ascetic life in the Dashanami Sanyasis
and the Nathpanthis, two living
ascetic communities. The major cur-
rent through which Shaiva devotional-
ism (bhakti) came into mainstream
society was through the devotional
hymns of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three poet-saints who lived in
southern India in the seventh and
eighth centuries. Their passionate
devotion, conveyed in hymns in the
Tamil language, was later system-
atized into the southern Indian philo-
sophical school known as Shaiva
Siddhanta. As the bhakti movement
moved northward, it found Shaiva
expression in the Lingayat community
in modern Karnataka, as well as the
Krama and Trika schools of Kashmiri
Shaivism. Shaivism has had a long
association with tantra, a secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice, and the
influence of tantra is evident in the
Kashmiri schools as well as in the doc-
trines of the Nathpanthi ascetics.
Shaivism does not show the bewil-
dering sectarian variety characterizing
Vaishnavas, devotees of the god
Vishnu, and Shaivites tend to be less
strict about membership in a particular
sect. Nevertheless, Shiva has millions
of devotees in modern India, and a well-
established network of pilgrimage
places (tirtha), particularly in the
Himalayas.
Shaiva Nagas
Naga (“naked,” i.e., fighting) ascetics
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akha-
ras or regiments on the model of an
army. The other major Naga division
was the Bairagi Nagas, who were
devotees of the god Vishnu. Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century
[[618]]

the Nagas’ primary occupation was as
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests. Such
resources allowed many Naga leaders
to become rich and powerful men
despite often coming from lower
social strata, and in earlier times such
opportunities would have made a
career as a Naga an attractive proposi-
tion for an ambitious young man. Both
these sources of income have largely
disappeared in contemporary times,
although some Naga communities are
still landowners with extensive prop-
erties and thus both rich and influen-
tial. See also shaiva.
Shaiva Siddhanta
Southern Indian religious community
that was particularly developed in the
Tamil country, and whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. Shaiva Siddhanta is based on a
series of fourteen texts, all completed
by the fourteenth century C . E ., in
which the ideas about Shiva found in
Sanskrit texts were reinterpreted in
light of the devotional faith of the
Nayanars. The Nayanars were a group
of sixty-three poet-saints who lived in
southern India in the seventh and
eighth centuries. The most famous
and influential of these interpreters
was
the
ninth-century
poet
Manikkavachakar. Central to Shaiva
Siddhanta is the triad of Shiva as the
“Lord” (pati), human souls held in
bondage (pashu), and the “bonds”
(pasha) holding these souls. Shiva is
conceived as the supreme divinity,
who wields the bonds of maya, or illu-
sion, to keep souls in bondage. Yet he
is also pictured as gracious and loving
to his devotees, a far cry from the
capricious and somewhat dangerous
figure in his earliest mythology. As the
supreme lord, Shiva is the source of all
spiritual illumination and energy, and
also the power through which the
world is created, sustained, and reab-
sorbed again. Souls are conceived as
different from Shiva, since they areShakha
subject to imperfections, although
here too his power is their
ultimate source. The only path to
liberation is devotion to Shiva,
through whose grace the bonds of
maya can be broken or transcended.
Even after liberation souls remain dis-
tinct from Shiva, although they remain
in his presence. For further informa-
tion see M. Dhavamony, Love of God
According to Saiva Siddhanta, 1971.

Shaka (“Teak”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the
sixth of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Shaka Era
One of the dating systems in India,
which is claimed to mark the defeat of
the Shakas by King Salivahana. For any
given year in the common era, the
Shaka era date is either seventy-eight or
seventy-nine years earlier, a discrepancy
that stems from the differing days on
which the years begin in these two sys-
tems. In the common era the year begins
on January 1, but in the Shaka era it
begins with the sun’s transition into
Aries, determined in India as falling on
April 14. Hence, to convert a Shaka era
date to a common era date, one adds
seventy-nine years for dates from
January 1 to April 14, and seventy-eight
years for dates from April 15 to
December 31.
Shakata
(“cart”) One of the demon assassins sent
by Kamsa, the demon-king of Mathura,
to kill his nephew, the child-god
Krishna. Shakata takes the form of a
cart, intending to take the infant
Krishna unaware. Yet Krishna is not
fooled by this deception: With a kick of
his infant toes Krishna launches the cart
into flight, killing the demon with the
force of the blow.
Shakha
(“branch”) The name given to a local
“branch”
of
the
Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ), whose
membership is often drawn from a
particular neighborhood or section of
a city. The RSS is a conservative Hindu
organization whose express purpose
is to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India. The RSS has
historically characterized itself as a
cultural and character-building orga-
nization, and for much of its existence
has shunned direct political involve-
ment, although it has exercised con-
siderable influence through its many
affiliated organizations. Each shakha,
or local RSS unit, holds a daily meeting
for its members, who are known as
svayamsevaks (“volunteers”). The
meeting’s typical activities include an
opening ceremony in which the orga-
nization’s saffron banner is raised; tra-
ditional games or exercises, including
martial drill, and a discussion period
in which RSS ideals can be disseminat-
ed and propagated. The shakhas in
any given area are overseen by a full-
time RSS worker known as a pracharak
(“director”), who serves as a liaison
between the local units and the RSS
leadership, and who oversees RSS
activity in his area. Most of the
shakha’s members will never advance
beyond this local level, and those who
do are usually gifted leaders. Thus, the
primary stress at the shakha level is
on forming personal relationships
with other members, as a way to
develop loyalty to the organization.
Although the shakhas often have very
high attrition, the bonds developed
there are often very strong as well and
are particularly beneficial in helping
displaced and newly urbanized peo-
ple develop a sense of community. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987.

Shakra
Shakra
An epithet of the god Indra. See Indra.
Shakta
Worshiper of the Goddess in any of her
myriad forms. The name itself is
derived from shakti, the divine femi-
nine “power” that gives the Goddess
her vitality. Among the most famous
forms of the Goddess are Durga and
Kali, who are both powerful and dan-
gerous goddesses. Aside from these,
there are a host of other goddesses,
who are often the presiding deities of a
particular place. See also Lakshmi,
Nirriti, Parvati, Prithvi, Sati, Shiwalik
goddesses, and Ushas.
Shakti
(“power”) In Hindu iconography, the
name of the spear carried by the god
Skanda. The spear’s head is shaped
either like a leaf or a diamond, and it is
fitted with a wooden shaft.
Shakti
(2) Epithet of the Goddess. Shakti
is believed to be a divine feminine
power that is present in each person
as the kundalini. See also Goddess
and kundalini.
Shakti Pithas
(“benches” or “seats” of Shakti)
General term for a network of sites
connected with the worship of the
Mother Goddess. Although their num-
ber differs from source to source—
some list fifty-one, and others 108—in
both cases the sites are spread
throughout the subcontinent, from
Baluchistan (in modern Pakistan) to
Assam to the deep south. According to
the charter myth, each of these places
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to
earth, taking form as a different god-
dess in each place. This myth provides
a way to connect the myriad local
Hindu goddesses by conceiving them
[[620]]

as differing manifestations of a single
primordial Goddess. It also connects
the subcontinent into a single concep-
tual unit, knit together by this network
of sites as the body is connected by its
members. One should also note that
different places may claim the same
body part in the drive to enhance the
religious prestige of any particular
site. As but one example, according to
most “official” lists Sati’s vulva, the
most powerfully charged part of the
female body, fell at the temple of
Kamakhya in Assam, but the same
claim is made at Kalimath in the
Himalayas. Suffice it to say that there
is no single authoritative list of sites,
and competing claims are not unusu-
al. See also pitha.
Shakumbhari Devi
Presiding deity of the Shakumbhari Devi
temple in the district of Saharanpur in
Uttar Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. This site is one of
the Shakti Pithas, a network of sites
sacred to the Goddess that spreads
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a dif-
ferent goddess; in the case of Shakum-
bhari Devi, the body part is said to have
been Sati’s head. The temple is in a thin-
ly settled region, and the major time of
year that pilgrims come to visit is during
the Navaratri festivals.
Although Hindi literature identifies
Shakumbhari Devi as a form of Durga,
the site’s charter myth shows the nur-
turing capacities of the Goddess as
well as the warrior aspect more com-
monly
associated
with
Durga.
According to the story, a demon
named Durgam gains the boon that he
cannot be conquered by any of the
gods. After subduing all the gods,
Durgam prevents the storm-god Indra
from sending rain to the earth for one
hundred years. Seeing the earth’s dis-
tress, the gods approach the Goddess
and beg for her help. The Goddess,Shakuntala
filled with pity, takes a form with one
hundred eyes, because of which one of
her epithets is Shatakshi (“hundred
eyes”). From each eye comes a stream
of tears, and when these fall to the
earth, plants begin to grow again.
Further, when her tears do not reach
some places, she puts forth vegetables
(Shak) from her own body to nourish
the creatures of the earth. Her final
action is to kill the demon Durgam,
reasserting the Goddess as a strong
and protective figure. Although there
is little information on Shakumbhari
Devi in English, there are further refer-
ences to her in David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986. See also pitha.
Shakuni
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, the maternal
uncle of Duryodhana, the epic’s
antagonist. Shakuni’s most famous
episode in the Mahabharata is as a
player in the game of dice against
Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers who are the epic’s
protagonists. The epic describes
Shakuni as the world’s best dice player,
whereas Yudhishthira is enthusiastic
but
completely
unskilled.
As
Yudhishthira begins to lose, he keeps
betting bigger and bigger stakes in an
effort to win back what he has lost.
After losing his family’s kingdom and
all their possessions, Yudhishthira
wagers himself and his brothers, and
after losing this bet, he wagers and
loses their common wife, Draupadi.
As a result, Draupadi is paraded
through the assembly hall by
Shakuni’s nephews, Duryodhana and
Duhshasana, her clothes stained
with her menstrual blood, sharpening
the already strong enmities between
these two groups. Shocked at such
treatment, Duryodhana’s father, King
Dhrtarashtra, gives the Pandavas
back their freedom. Then, because of a
loss in a subsequent game of dice, the
Pandavas agree to go into exile for
twelve years and live incognito for the
thirteenth, with the condition that, if
they are discovered in the thirteenth
year, the cycle will begin anew. In the
ensuing Mahabharata war Shakuni
fights on the side of his nephew and is
eventually killed by the fourth
Pandava brother, Sahadeva.
Shakuntala
A figure in Hindu mythology and the
protagonist in the drama Abhijnana-
shakuntala written by the poet
Kalidasa. Shakuntala is the daughter
of the apsara Menaka and the sage
Vishvamitra, conceived when Menaka
is sent to seduce Vishvamitra in an
attempt to reduce his spiritual powers.
Shakuntala is raised at the ashram of
the sage Kanva, where she grows into a
beautiful young woman. One day she
attracts the eye of King Dushyanta,
who has been hunting in the forest,
and they are married by the gandhar-
va form of marriage (consensual sexu-
al intercourse), conceiving their son
Bharata. Shakuntala’s happiness,
however, is short-lived. As she is think-
ing one day about Dushyanta, who has
traveled back to his capital without
her, she fails to notice the arrival of the
sage Durvasas. In his anger at being
ignored, Durvasas lays a curse that her
beloved will completely forget her.
Shakuntala, horrified, manages to
convince Durvasas to modify the
curse: Dushyanta will remember
everything, as soon as Shakuntala
shows him proof of their union.
Shakuntala has Dushyanta’s signet
ring as proof, but she loses it on her
way to see Dushyanta. Dushyanta (as
expected) denies that he has ever met
Shakuntala, and she eventually ends
up working as one of the palace cooks.
Her salvation comes unexpectedly,
when she finds the missing ring in the
belly of a fish she is preparing for the
king’s dinner. When she shows him the
ring, Dushyanta immediately recog-
nizes Shakuntala and acknowledges
her as his wife, and the couple live
happily ever after.

Shalagram
Shamvuka
Believed to be a manifestation of the god Vishnu,
a shalagram is a black stone that contains the
fossilized spiral shell of a prehistoric sea creature.
Shalagram
Black stone containing an ammonite,
the spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehis-
toric sea creature. The shalagram is pri-
marily found in the upper reaches of the
Gandaki River in Nepal. The circular
ammonite fossil is understood to be
Vishnu’s chakra, and the shalagram is
thus understood as a “self-manifest”
(svayambhu) form of Vishnu. As with all
such “self-manifest” forms, the shala-
gram is believed to be especially holy,
since in it Vishnu has chosen to reveal
himself to his devotees (bhakta) rather
than coming to an image fashioned by
human hands. Because of its holiness,
the shalagram is often an object of wor-
ship. Its portability (and durability) made
it the preferred form of Vishnu for wan-
dering Vaishnava ascetics. One also finds
cases in which small images are claimed
to have been revealed when a shalagram
was broken open; these images carry the
glamour of a finished image as well as the
divine power that accompanies sponta-
neous manifestation.
Shambhu
(“causing happiness,” “granting pros-
perity”) Epithet of the god Shiva.
See Shiva.
[[622]]

Shudra ascetic who appears both in
the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, and in the poet
Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsha , whose
story line is based on the Ramayana.
According to the story a brahmin
comes to Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist, and complains that his son has
died because of the unrighteousness
running through the land. Since the
king is considered responsible for the
general moral climate in his kingdom,
Rama immediately asks the brahmin
for more information. He is told that a
man named Shamvuka has been
doing physical asceticism (tapas) in a
bid to generate spiritual powers
through his suffering, even though
Shamvuka is a member of the servant
(shudra) class, and these sorts of reli-
gious exercises are forbidden to peo-
ple of such low social status. Rama
finds Shamvuka hanging his head
downward over a smoking fire, and
when he refuses to desist from his
ascetic practices, Rama kills him. This
episode conveys several important
messages. One of these is the Indian
cultural belief that physical suffering
generates spiritual and/or magic
powers. When this belief is combined
with a profoundly hierarchical model
of society, it becomes important for
the higher-class people to control the
people who are allowed to do this,
lest the lower classes gain power over
their “betters.” Finally, this story
shows the Ramayana’s general ten-
dency to uphold established social
values and boundaries.
Shankara
(“auspicious”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. With the honorific suffix
acharya (“teacher”), this is also the
name of the most significant figure in
the Advaita Vedanta philosophical
school, Shankaracharya, who is pop-
ularly considered to be Shiva incar-
nate. As noted above, the generally
accepted meaning of the nameShankaracharya
Shankara has intensely positive con-
notations, yet the verb shank, from
which this name is almost certainly
derived, has associations with doubt,
uncertainty, and anxiety. This sort of
ambivalence has a long association
with Shiva; the earliest accepted refer-
ence, in the Shvetashvatara Upan-
ishad, mentions both his death-deal-
ing arrows, and his kindness to his
devotees (bhakta). The traditional
meaning of this name may thus be a
form of propitiation—knowing that
Shiva wields awesome and unpre-
dictable power but describing him as
“auspicious” in the hope that he will
show his kinder side.
Shankaracharya
(788–820?) Writer and religious thinker
who is unquestionably the most sig-
nificant figure in the Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school, and arguably the
single greatest Hindu religious figure.
Very little is known about his life—
even his dates are a matter of specula-
tion—but popular tales abound.
According to one story, he was the god
Shiva incarnate, who descended to
earth to reveal the knowledge of the
absolute. This connection is shown by
his name—Shankara is one of the epi-
thets of Shiva, and acharya (“teacher”)
is an honorific suffix. He is traditional-
ly believed to have been born in a
Nambudiri brahmin family at Kaladi
in the state of Kerala, to have become
an ascetic at a very young age, and to
have traveled widely engaging in reli-
gious disputes, particularly with the
Buddhists, whose religious influence
he put in permanent decline. He is
believed to have established the ten
Dashanami Sanyasi orders and the
four maths that are their centers, to
have written commentaries on the
three texts central to the Vedanta
school—namely the Upanishads, the
Vedanta Sutras , and the Bhagavad
Gita—and to have gone finally to the
high Himalayas, where he died at the
age of 32.
Many of these claims cannot be sub-
stantiated, but the significance of his
work cannot be denied. His commen-
tary on the Vedanta Sutras, the
Brahmasutra Bhashya, gives the classic
formulation of Advaita Vedanta, with its
emphasis that the Ultimate Reality is the
unqualified (nirguna) Brahman, which
is eternal and unchanging, and to which
the human soul is identical. The chang-
ing phenomenal world (the world we
see and sense) is an illusion, created
through the superimposition (adhyasa)
of mistaken ideas upon the unqualified
Brahman. Since Shankaracharya believes
that one is released from bondage by
replacing this mistaken understanding
with the correct one, insight and not
action is the means to liberation. This
moment of understanding can be
described as a flash of realization, but it
seems mistaken to characterize Shanka-
racharya as a mystic. This is because
he strongly emphasizes the authority
of the sacred texts as a source of accu-
rate knowledge about the ultimate
truth. Although this stress on insight
devalues the ultimate worth of ritual
action, except in a preparatory role
by removing defilements, Shankara-
charya also believed that required ritual
actions should be performed from a
sense of duty.
Shankaracharya is as philosophically
significant for his silence as for his
speech. He gives no definitive answer
on many philosophical issues: about
whether selves are one or many, about
whether the locus of ignorance (avidya)
was Brahman or the individual, about
the nature of ignorance itself, and about
the real nature of the material world. His
refusal to take a position on these issues
left many different routes open to those
who came after him. Shankaracharya
himself tended to emphasize epistemo-
logical issues—how human beings
come to know things, and particularly
how to correct the mistaken ideas
through which human beings are held
in bondage. The image that comes
through his writing is of a deeply reli-
gious man whose primary concern was
[[623]]
Shankaracharyas
ascetic center and Kanchipuram’s gen-
eral status as a religious center.
Although by this reckoning there are
five places, at present there are only
four Shankaracharyas, since Swami
Swaroopanand Saraswati holds the seat
for both Badrinath and Dwaraka. The
other Shankaracharyas are Swami
Nishchalanand (Puri), Swami Bharati
Tirtha (Shringeri), and Swami Jayendra
Saraswati (Kanchipuram). Their trad-
itional office gives the Shankara-
charyas a great deal of religious status
and prestige, and because of this they
have become highly influential figures,
even in an intensely decentralized reli-
gious tradition.

to help his hearers destroy their illusions
and gain final liberation of the soul
(moksha). Given this underlying goal
and his acute philosophical mind, one
can argue that he was aware of such
metaphysical questions but chose to
ignore them, since they were unrelated
to his primary goal. For further informa-
tion on Shankaracharya’s thought, see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara
and His Pupils, 1981.
Shankaracharyas
The philosopher Shankaracharya
(788–820) is traditionally said to have
established centers for the Dashanami
Sanyasi ascetics, devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, at four places in India:
Badrinath, Puri, Shringeri, and
Dwaraka. The head monk at each
of these centers has been given the
title Shankaracharya, as a sign of the
status of his office. The head of the
Kamakotipith, an ascetic center in the
southern Indian city of Kanchipuram,
has also come to be described as a
Shankaracharya, even though this site is
not one of the original four; this reflects
the Kamakotipith’s importance as an
[[624]]

Shankaradigvijaya
(“Shankara’s victory tour”) A written
account of the life of the philosopher
Shankaracharya traditionally attrib-
uted to the fourteenth-century writer
Madhavacharya, although evidence
within the work points to composition
several centuries later. The story is clearly
hagiographical, for it is filled with fan-
tastic legends intended to highlight
Shankaracharya’s achievements and his
ultimate identity with the god Shiva
himself. According to this story, after
gaining full wisdom, Shankaracharya
embarks on a “victory tour” (digvijaya)
of India. During this tour he travels
throughout the country, debates all
opponents, and defeats them all con-
vincingly, thus establishing the
supremacy of his Advaita Vedanta
philosophical school. The motif of the
digvijaya (literally, “conquest of [all]
directions”) was a common theme in
works about political and military lead-
ers, and here it has been adapted to tell
a religious story.
Shankha
(“conch shell”) In Hindu religious
imagery, one of the identifying objects
always carried by the god Vishnu, along
with the club (gada), lotus (padma), and
discus (chakra). Vishnu’s conch isSharada Math
considered both a musical instrument
and an instrument of war, since through
its powerful sound he is said to have
struck terror in the hearts of his ene-
mies. The conch is also commonly
carried by certain powerful forms of the
Goddess. The reason for this can be
found in her charter myth, in which she
is formed from the collected radiance of
all the gods and receives duplicates of all
their weapons.
Shanta (“peaceful”) Bhava
The first of the five modes of devotion to
God that were most prominently articu-
lated by Rupa Goswami, a devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna and a fol-
lower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used five different models of
human relationships to explain the vari-
ety of links followers might have with
the deities. These five models showed
growing emotional intensity, from the
peaceful (shanta) sense that comes from
realizing one’s complete identity with
Brahman, or Supreme Reality, to con-
ceiving of god as one’s master, friend,
child, or lover. The shanta bhava, in
which one finds mental peace through
the realization of complete identity with
Brahman, is the only one of these modes
in which the devotee does not have a
personalized relationship with God.
Given Rupa’s assumption that Krishna
was the highest manifestation of god-
head, and that true religious life
involved having a relationship with him,
the shanta bhava was thus judged inferi-
or to the other four modes.
Shantanu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Sanskrit epics, Shantanu is the
father of Bhishma by his first wife, and
the husband of Satyavati in his second
marriage. Satyavati has agreed to marry
Shantanu on the condition that her sons
reign, despite the fact that Bhishma is
the eldest and thus is rightly entitled to
the throne. Shantanu agrees to this con-
dition, and to please his father Bhishma
vows never to marry, so that he will have
no heirs to compete with Satyavati’s.
Bhishma upholds his promise until his
death, but Shantanu’s willingness to put
aside the rightful heir has terrible conse-
quences. When Satyavati’s son Vichitra-
virya dies childless, she calls on her
elder son Vyasa to sire children by his
wives. From this union comes Pandu
and Dhrtarashtra. The struggle for royal
power by their respective sons culmi-
nates in the Mahabharata war, in which
the family is destroyed.
Shantiniketan
(“abode of peace”) Town in the Birbhum
district of West Bengal, about ninety
miles northeast of Calcutta. It is most
famous for Vishva-Bharati University,
founded in 1921 by the Indian poet and
Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore
(1861–1941). As an educational institu-
tion, the university was dedicated to
providing an education that would satisfy
people’s material and spiritual needs
and thus develop an integrated human
being. It did this in part by promoting
the arts and by stressing the intercon-
nection between nature and human
beings, both themes that were close to
Tagore’s heart.
Sharada Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
for Hindu ascetics (often translated as
“monasteries”) traditionally believed to
have been established by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya; the oth-
ers are the Jyotir Math, Shringeri Math,
and Govardhan Math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Sharada
Math is in the western quarter, in the
city of Dwaraka in the state of Gujarat,
on the shore of the Arabian Sea.
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as
the founder of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
the most prestigious Hindu ascetic
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)
ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of the god
[[625]]
Sharva
Shiva who are divided into ten divisions,
each with a different name. These
ten divisions are organized into four larger
organizational groups—Anandawara,
Bhogawara, Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—
each of which has two or three of the ten
divisions and is associated with one of the
four maths. Of these, the Sharada Math is
associated with the Kitawara group.
Sharva
(from shara, “arrow”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. In his earliest description in the
Shvetashvatara Upanishad, the god
Rudra (later identified with Shiva) is
identified as a god whose primary
weapons are infallible arrows. This char-
acterization of Shiva as an archer has
continued ever since; his bow Pinaka is
one of few divine weapons famous
enough to have a name. See Shiva.
Shastra
(“order”) A shastra is the name given to a
technical treatise explaining the standards
of a particular cultural or artistic discipline
in Hinduism, as in Bharata’s Natya-
shastra, a technical manual that discusses
dance and the theater. When it is placed at
the end of a compound (as in “Shilpa
Shastra”), the word shastra can also serve
to denote the whole body of teaching on
that particular subject. All of the classical
arts were placed under well-defined
canons, each with its own specific rules
and standards to guide artists: Sculpture
and architecture were under Shilpa
Shastra, music under Sangita shastra, and
dance and theater under Natya shastra.
Given the prevailing emphasis on uphold-
ing such strict rules, artistic genius meant
doing something unusual within the larger
confines of the tradition rather than creat-
ing something entirely new or original.
Shastri Narayanswarupdas Swami
The ascetic name of the spiritual leader
of the Akshar Purushottam Samstha,
a branch of the Swaminarayan
religious community. He is more
commonly known by his title Pramukh
[[626]]

Swami (“President
Pramukh Swami.
Swami”).
See
Shatakatrayam
(“The Three Hundred”) Collection of
Sanskrit poems ascribed to the poet-
philosopher Bhartrhari, who is believed
to have lived in the fifth century. The text is
a three-part collection of poems about
political life, love, and renunciation, which
explore all of the conventional ends of life:
The first two sections are about power
(artha), sensual or physical desire (kama),
and righteous action (dharma), whereas
the final section is concerned with libera-
tion of the soul (moksha). Much of the
poetry carries a cynical, slightly bitter
tone, suggesting the world-weariness of a
man who has seen too much of the harsh
realities of life. For further information see
Barbara Stoller Miller (trans.), The Hermit
and the Love-Thief, 1978.
Shatakshi
(“[having] one hundred eyes”) Epithet of
the goddess Shakumbhari Devi, based
on a story that tells of a time when the
earth is parched with drought, and she
takes a form with a hundred eyes, water-
ing the earth with her tears. See
Shakumbhari Devi.
Shatapatha
(“Hundred-Path”) Brahmana
One of the two most important texts in the
Brahmana branch of sacred Vedic litera-
ture, along with the Aiteraya Brahmana.
The Brahmanas were primarily manuals
describing the correct performance of
Vedic ritual sacrifices. Each Brahmana was
in theory connected with one of the
Vedas, which gave them Vedic authority,
but in fact they were quite different from
the Vedas in scope and content. According
to tradition, the Shatapatha Brahmana
was connected with the “white” recension
of the Yajur Veda, a variant form of the text
in which the explanatory notes connected
with the Vedic mantras have been collected
into a separate appendix. This is inShaving
A man shaves an infant boy’s head. Hair is believed to trap impurities.
contrast with the “Black” Yajur Veda, in
which these notes have been incorporated
into the body of the text itself. Aside from
giving instruction on the practice of rituals,
the Shatapatha Brahmana includes a wide
variety of texts, one of which is the Isha
Upanishad. The upanishad’s presence in a
Brahmana text clearly shows that there
was considerable overlap in the times of
composition of various Vedic literary
styles, rather than clear-cut “periods.”
Shatrughna
(“Foe-slayer”) In the Ramayana, the earli-
er of the two great Indian epics,
Shatrughna is the second son of King
Dasharatha and his wife Sumitra, and the
youngest brother of Rama, the epic’s pro-
tagonist. Whereas Rama’s brothers Laksh-
mana and Bharata play important roles in
the epic—the former as Rama’s minion
and shadow, the latter serving as Rama’s
regent during his exile—Shatrughna is vir-
tually invisible and does not play an
important part in the larger epic narrative.
Shattila Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Magh ( January–February). As with all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of the god
Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals have
certain prescribed rites, which usually
involve fasting (upavasa) and worship
and often promise specific benefits
for faithful performance. On this day
one should bathe an image of Vishnu
with the five auspicious things (milk,
curds, honey, ghee, and sugar water),
placing some sesame seed (tila) into
each. One should also eat food con-
taining sesame seed. During the night
one should sleep before the image of
the deity. This ekadashi’s name comes
from the six (sat) ways in which
the sesame seed has been used.
Faithfully observing this festival is said
to cause one to be reborn in Vishnu’s
realm, Vaikuntha.
Shaving
An act of ritual purification as well as
an act of hygiene. The hair of the head
and face is believed to trap impurity
(ashaucha), and shaving one or both
is a significant part of many rites of
[[627]]
Shesha
purification. Body hair, however, is
rarely shaved, since the Sanskrit lan-
guage has different words for these
two types of hair, and they are consid-
ered to be different things entirely.
During the period of impurity associ-
ated with death (maranashaucha) the
mourners will not shave for the entire
ten days, signifying their continuing
impurity, but at the end of that period
they will shave completely to signify
their final purification. Hindu men
will sometimes also refrain from
shaving as a sign of austerity while
they are keeping religious vows, and
shave when the vow has been com-
pleted. One example occurs during
the lunar month of Shravan, in which
men who are devotees (bhakta) of the
god Shiva will often refrain from
shaving. Another example can be
found in the ritual preparation for the
annual pilgrimage to Shabari Malai;
men must keep a strict ascetic disci-
pline for forty-one days before the pil-
grimage, in which one element is a
ban on shaving.
Shesha
(“remnant”) Mythical thousand-head-
ed serpent upon which the god
Vishnu reclines, as on a couch;
Shesha is also considered to support
the various regions of the earth, par-
ticularly the underworlds. His name
comes from the fact that he is consid-
ered a partial incarnation of Vishnu
and is thus related to Vishnu, both as
incarnation and through his status as
Vishnu’s couch. As with most of the
gods’ animal associates, Shesha does
not play a prominent role in his own
right. The one mythic episode in
which he does play an important part
is that of churning the Ocean of Milk
in which Shesha serves as the churn-
ing-rope to turn Mount Mandara,
with all the gods pulling from one
side, and the demons pulling from the
other. Yet here too he is only instru-
mental, necessary for the episode to
unfold but with the main focus lying
[[628]]

elsewhere. Shesha is seen as having a
protective role. In Hindu astrology
(jyotisha) he is identified as the pro-
tective deity for the fifth day of each
half of the lunar month. See also
Tortoise avatar.
Shibi
In Hindu mythology, sage-king who is
famous for his virtue and commit-
ment to his word. Shibi’s reputation
reaches the ears of the gods, who
decide to test it. The god Dharma,
who is righteousness personified (or
in some other versions, the god Agni)
takes the form of a dove, and is pur-
sued by the god Indra, in the form of a
hawk. The dove flies into Shibi’s lap
and entreats him for asylum, which
Shibi grants. The hawk observes that it
is inappropriate for Shibi to deprive
him of the food he needs to eat, and
demands in exchange an equal weight
of flesh cut from Shibi’s body. Shibi
agrees, but no matter how much of his
flesh he throws into the balance, the
dove is still heavier. Finally Shibi sits
his whole body into the balance, as a
sign that he will sacrifice his life for
the dove. At this point the gods
resume their divine forms and bless
Shibi for his steadfastness.
Shikhandi
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, the rebirth of
the maiden Amba, daughter of the
king of Kashi. Amba and her sisters
have been kidnapped by Bhishma to
be
married
to
his
nephew
Vichitravirya, but when she informs
Bhishma that her heart already
belongs to King Salva, Bhishma gal-
lantly releases her. Yet Salva refuses to
marry her, for since she has been kid-
napped he is not certain of her virgin-
ity. Amba then returns to Bhishma,
who refuses to marry her because of
his vow to remain a lifelong bachelor.
In her anger Amba swears to get
revenge on Bhishma and performsShiksha
harsh physical asceticism (tapas) to
generate the spiritual powers neces-
sary to do this. Her austerities eventu-
ally please the god Shiva, who
promises her that she will be reward-
ed in her next birth. Amba then raises
a pyre and burns herself to death.
Amba is reborn as Shikhandi to
King Drupada, whose wife has
received a boon that she will give birth
to a girl, but that the girl will later be
transformed into a boy. When
Shikhandi is born, it is announced
that the child is a boy and the child is
given the training appropriate for a
prince. It is only upon fixing
a marriage for Shikhandi that the
issue of the child’s gender comes up
and it is finally resolved when
Shikhandi exchanges sexes with a
nature
spirit
(yaksha)
named
Sthunakarna, who becomes a
woman, and Shikhandi a man. The
switch is originally intended to be for
only a short period, but is later
extended until Shikhandi’s death, at
which time Sthunakarna again
becomes male.
During the Mahabharata war
Shikhandi challenges Bhishma in bat-
tle but the latter refuses to fight him,
since Shikhandi has been born a
woman. Shikhandi takes advantage of
this gallantry to shoot a barrage of
arrows at Bhishma, as does the warrior
Arjuna, who hides behind Shikhandi
for protection. With this assault,
Bhishma finally decides that the time
has come for him to give up the fight
and die. In the battle that follows after
Bhishma falls, Shikhandi is killed by
Ashvatthama, the son of Drona, who
fights on the side of the Kauravas in
the war. Based on Shikhandi’s role in
shielding Arjuna from harm, in mod-
ern Hindi the name Shikhandi is used
to designate a scapegoat, someone
behind whom another person hides
and escapes blame.
Shikhara
Temple tower that was the central fea-
ture of the Nagara architectural style,
prevalent in northern and eastern India.
The temple’s tallest tower was always
directly over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, although there were
often also smaller, subsidiary towers to
lead the eye up to that primary one.
Within this general pattern there are two
important variations, exemplified by the
temples at Khajuraho and Orissa. In the
Khajuraho style a group of shikharas is
unified into one continuous upward
swell, which draws the eye upward like a
series of hills leading to a distant peak.
In contrast, the Orissan style tends to
emphasize the differences between the
temple’s parts, with a low entrance hall
(jagamohan) next to a beehive-shaped
temple tower (deul), which is often
three or four times taller than the
entrance hall.
Shiksha
(“learning”) One of the six Vedangas.
These were the supplemental branch-
es of knowledge connected with the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts, and all the Vedangas were asso-
ciated with the use of the Vedas.
Shiksha was concerned with articula-
tion, proper pronunciation, and the
laws of euphonic combination (sand-
hi), that is, sounds combined in a cer-
tain way to have a pleasant effect.
Although this may sound trivial, it
was a central concern in the cult of
sacrifice laid out in the Brahmana
literature. This was because the
power of these sacrifices was believed
to depend on the proper delivery of
the Vedic mantras, with any mistake
being potentially ruinous. Aside from
shiksha, the other Vedangas are vya-
karana (Sanskrit grammar), chandas
(Sanskrit prosody), kalpa (ritual
instructions), nirukta (etymology),
and jyotisha (favorable times for
sacrifices).
[[629]]
Shilappadigaram
Image of the god Vishnu. Crafted according to the
rules of shilpa shastra, the image’s proportions are
strictly defined and he holds identifying objects.
Shilappadigaram
(“the Jeweled Anklet”) The greatest epic
poem in classical Tamil literature. It is
traditionally ascribed to the poet
Ilangovadigal (2nd c.) but almost cer-
tainly was written several centuries
later. The poem is a symbolic theater for
several important themes that have per-
vaded Hindu culture, particularly the
need for a king to rule righteously and
the power gained by a wife through her
devotion to her husband. The story tells
the tale of a married couple, Kannaki
and her husband Kovalan. In his infatu-
ation with a dancer, Kovalan squanders
the family’s wealth, selling nearly all
[[630]]

their possessions. When he finally
returns to his wife, their only remaining
valuables are one pair of her jeweled
anklets. The couple decides to travel to
the town of Madurai to sell the anklets,
and use the proceeds to reestablish their
family as traders.
When they reach Madurai, however,
tragedy strikes. The night before the
couple’s arrival, a dishonest jeweler has
stolen an identical pair of anklets from
the queen of Madurai, and when
Kovalan goes to sell the anklets, the
same jeweler accuses him of being the
thief. Kovalan is executed, and when
Kannaki hears of this she comes into the
city, bearing the other anklet as a sign of
his innocence. She gains an audience
with the king, who falls dead with
remorse when he realizes the disaster he
has caused. Still furious, Kannaki rips off
her left breast, pronounces a curse on
the city, and hurls the breast onto the
street; the breast bursts into flames that
consume the city. In the end, Madurai’s
patron goddess persuades Kannaki to
withdraw her curse, and Kannaki dies a
few days later.
One of the forces assumed to be
operating here is the power of a woman’s
devotion to her husband. Even though
Kovalan squanders all their money
through unfaithfulness, Kannaki readily
takes him back when he returns, and is
willing to give up her last resource to
help him. The power of her devotion
gives her the ability to cause widespread
destruction through a single curse, and
the strength of this power is still an arti-
cle of faith among many Hindus even
today. For further discussion of the
themes in this play, and more general
consideration of images of Hindu
women, see Sarah Mitter, Dharma’s
Daughters, 1991. See also Tamil lan-
guage and Tamil epics.
Shilpa Shastra
General name for rules and standards
governing the mechanical arts and
handicrafts—traditionally numbered at
sixty-four—through which anything wasShishtachara
formed, made, or fashioned. In the con-
text of art and architecture, the term
shilpa shastra is most often associated
with two specific areas, which by the
medieval era had had their conventions
strictly fixed. One of these governed the
creation of sculptural images, according
to which the images of the deities had to
be carved to exactly defined propor-
tions, along with their identifying attrib-
utes. The other area was in regard
to buildings, whether individual struc-
tures such as temples, or collections
of buildings in city planning. The layout
of temples was modeled after the
human body (and thus mirrored the
sculptor’s precision regarding the
images of the divine); entire towns
were similarly modeled to create a
harmonious urban environment.
Shipra River
A distant tributary of the Yamuna River,
which has its headwaters in the
Vindhya Mountains in Madhya Pradesh.
The Shipra is considered a holy river
because it flows through Ujjain, a cen-
tral Indian city with great religious and
historical significance.
Shirdi
Small town in the state of Mahara-
shtra, about 120 miles northeast of
Bombay. It is famous as the home of
the modern saint Shirdi Sai Baba, who
appeared there as an adolescent boy in
[[1872]]
 and lived there until his death in
[[1918]]
. He was greatly esteemed by peo-
ple from all religious communities,
and the shrine built in the place in
which he lived receives considerable
traffic even today.
Shirdi Sai Baba
(d. 1918) Hindu ascetic and religious
teacher whose disciples came from
many different religious communities—
Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, and Christian. His
origins are mysterious, for in 1872 he
simply appeared in the town of Shirdi in
Maharashtra, as a boy of about sixteen.
He was dressed in the manner of a
Muslim faqir (religious mendicant, or
beggar), but claimed to have forgotten
his birthplace and his family. Because of
his dress a local priest forbade him from
staying at a Hindu temple, so he moved
into a small, unused mosque, where he
lived for the rest of his life. He kept a per-
petual fire burning in a fire pit, and for
religious rituals performed both Muslim
prayers and Hindu worship. He was
most famous for his supernatural pow-
ers: healing (for which he often gave
people ash from his fire pit to eat), fore-
telling the future, multilocation (the
ability to be in two places at the same
time), and appearing in dreams to guide
his followers. His response to people’s
immediate needs made him famous
through much of India, but he always
maintained that his purpose in per-
forming miracles was to attract people
to spiritual life. He gradually attracted
disciples, and in the time since his death
the town of Shirdi has become an
important regional pilgrimage place
(tirtha). Although he referred to himself
as Sai Baba, he is now usually called
Shirdi Sai Baba, to distinguish him from
Sathya Sai Baba, another religious
leader who claims to be Shirdi Sai Baba’s
reincarnated form.
Shishtachara
The “practice of learned [people],”
which was one of the traditional sources
for determining religious duty (dharma)
for matters not discussed in the dharma
literature, or for cases in which the liter-
ature itself gave conflicting opinions.
Although Shishtachara was the least
authoritative source of dharma, after the
Vedic scriptures and the dharma litera-
ture, making it an authority recognizes
that life has many ambiguities and
uncertainties and at the same time pro-
vides a resource for determining the
appropriate action by taking as a model
the practice of established and knowl-
edgeable people. Another term to desig-
nate this sort of authority was sadachara ,
the “practice of good [people].”
[[631]]
Shishupala
Shishupala
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Shishupala is the son
of the king of Cedi. He is also described
as a reincarnation of Jaya—one of the
gatekeepers of the god Vishnu’s heavenly
dwelling, Vaikuntha—who has been
cursed by the sages to be born three
times as a demon and killed by the god
Vishnu each time. Shishupala is born
with three eyes and four hands, but as
his horrified parents are about to aban-
don him, a celestial voice informs them
that the child will grow up into a power-
ful king. The heavenly voice also says
that Shishupala can be killed by only
one person on earth, that Shishupala’s
third eye will disappear when he sees
that person, and that two of his hands
will disappear when the person takes
him in his lap. After some time the god
Krishna pays a visit to Cedi, and when
the signs take place as foretold,
Shishupala’s parents know that Krishna
is the only person who can kill their son.
Shishupala’s mother is Krishna’s aunt,
and when she begs him not to kill her
son, Krishna promises to forgive
Shishupala’s misdeeds one hundred
times. Krishna sticks to his word, but
such forbearance only makes Shish-
upala more reckless, and after the one
hundred and first insult, Krishna
throws his discus and cuts off
Shishupala’s head.
Shishupala-Vadha
(“Slaughter of Shishupala”) Sanskrit
drama written by the seventh-century
poet Magha, which is traditionally reck-
oned as one of the six mahakavyas. The
play’s theme is the death of the mythic
figure Shishupala, whose mother has
been promised by Krishna that he will
forgive her son one hundred times. This
promise only makes Shishupala more
reckless, and after the one hundred and
first insult, Krishna throws his discus
and cuts off Shishupala’s head. Aside
from its mythic theme, the play
is notable for a number of unusual
verses, such as verses that are perfect
[[632]]

palindromes (verses that are the same
when read backward or forward), or that
use only one or two consonants, as a
sign of the poet’s skill.
Shishya
(“to be taught”) A word that in its literal
meaning can refer to any student but in
its most common sense refers to the dis-
ciple of a religious instructor (guru).
Shitala
Hindu goddess who is both worshiped
and feared. Shitala was traditionally
believed to be the physical representa-
tion of smallpox, a deadly virus, and a
person infected with the disease was
thought to be possessed by the goddess,
a notion reinforced by the fever and
delirium that often accompany this dis-
ease. Shitala is also associated with
heat—both because of the fever caused
by smallpox and because her major
religious observance, Shitalashtami,
comes near the advent of the hot sea-
son. Shitala is considered a jealous,
spiteful goddess whose wrath is visited
upon those who ignore and displease
her. The literal meaning of her name,
“Cool One,” can be seen as an attempt to
appease her wrath through flattery.
Shitala has retained prominence even
though the World Health Organization
has declared that smallpox has been
completely eradicated. In a fascinating
example of religious change, one writer
details how Shitala has shifted the dis-
ease through which she shows herself,
and now appears in the guise of tuber-
culosis. See Margaret Thrice Egnor, “The
Changed Mother, or What the Smallpox
Goddess Did when There Was No More
Smallpox,” Contributions to Asian
Studies XVIII, 1984.
Shitalashtami
Religious observance celebrated on the
eighth day of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Baisakh
(April–May), in honor of the goddess
Shitala. In northern India this festivalShiva
falls at the advent of the hottest time
of year; the climate thus mirrors the
heat and fevers brought on by contact
with Shitala herself, in her form as
smallpox. Although Shitala is conceived
as spiteful and jealous, she cannot be
ignored, since this will be sure to
provoke her wrath.
Shiv Sena
(“Army of Shivaji”) Militant Hindu orga-
nization formed in Bombay in the late
[[1960]]
s by Bal Thackeray. It was originally
a movement made up of people native
to Maharashtra, a modern Indian “lin-
guistic state” formed to unite people
with a common language, to resist the
perceived dominance of outsiders, in
this case migrants from Tamil Nadu who
were taking away jobs from the
Maharashtrian “sons of the soil.” This
nativist bent is reflected in its name, tak-
ing as its symbol the Maharashtrian
hero Shivaji, who successfully resisted
the power of the Moghul Empire. In
more recent times the movement has
associated itself with Hindutva or
Hindu nationalism, projecting itself as
defending the interests of the larger
Hindu community against the “out-
siders,” in particular Muslims. The Shiv
Sena’s potential for violent action is well
known, and they have always been
ready to defend their interests with
physical force, as well as working
through official channels. The Sena’s
ability to provide “muscle power” has
given them political strength in
Maharashtra, both in the municipal
government of Bombay, and most
recently as a partner (with the Bharatiya
Janata Party) in running the state
government. This political strength
is being translated into a strong
presence in other areas, particularly
in labor unions, in which the Sena-
affiliated union is gaining greater
influence and membership. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Shiva
(auspicious) Along with the god Vishnu
and the Goddess, one of the three most
important deities in the Hindu pan-
theon. All three are notable for being vir-
tually absent from the Vedas, and their
collective rise to dominance (and the
gradual eclipse of the original Vedic
gods) points clearly to a definitive
change in the Hindu tradition. Of the
three, Shiva is not mentioned at all
in the Veda. He is identified with the
god Rudra, who first appears in a few of
the late Vedic hymns and who is later
identified in the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad as the single supreme deity
behind all things. The word Shiva
(“auspicious”) first appears in this
upanishad, but as an adjective modify-
ing the feminine noun body.
Despite Rudra/Shiva’s appearance in
the upanishad as a supreme divinity, his
position is not clear-cut. He is described
as a master of archery who dwells in the
mountains (and thus away from human
beings) and is implored not to use his
arrows to harm either man or beast. It is
certain that Rudra/Shiva is not a Vedic
deity, and some have claimed that his
roots lie in the ancient urban-cultural
center known as the Indus Valley civi-
lization, citing as evidence one of the
seals found in Harappa, an ancient city
of Pakistan, which shows a horned fig-
ure sitting cross-legged as if in medita-
tion. This identification is possible but
hardly compelling. A more likely possi-
bility is that he entered the pantheon as
a god worshiped by ascetics, who have
always been associated with mountain
dwellings. His connection with ascetics
is reinforced by several ascetic charac-
teristics attributed to Shiva, such as the
matted locks and ash-smeared body.
Ascetic origins would also account for
his marginal status among the gods,
since this would have rendered him an
“outsider” to Vedic sacrificial cult, which
was the “established” religion of the
time. Shiva’s dramatic entry into the
pantheon comes in the story of the
death of his wife Sati. In this story, his
[[633]]

in matted locks and his body smeared with ash, Shiva is often regarded as the model for the Hindu ascetic.
[[634]]
Shivaga-Sindamani
father-in-law Daksha’s insulting remarks—
that Shiva was an ascetic with no money,
job, or family, and was unfit to join
respectable society—finally resulted in
the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice as a
sign of Shiva’s supremacy.
Shiva has retained this ambivalent,
sometimes marginal quality in his
iconography, his mythology, and his
character. Perhaps his most basic and
important characteristic is that he is a
divinity whose nature allows him to
move beyond the opposing forces (or
dualities) within himself and the world
by being at all times the possibility of
both forces at once. Shiva can represent
both the wild and dangerous side of life
and the respectable and refined side. On
the one hand, he is the typical ascetic,
with matted hair, ash-smeared body,
and a home on Mount Kailas in the
remote Himalayas. On the other hand,
he is Hindu society’s ideal for the good
husband, who dotes upon his wife
Parvati. His body is adorned with
snakes and clothed with a bloody ele-
phant skin, but he also wears the
Ganges River and the crescent moon,
which are associated with beauty, purity,
and auspiciousness. His mythic deeds
stress his overwhelming power, against
which no enemy can stand, and his sud-
den and sometimes impetuous temper,
seen best in the destruction of Kama,
the god of love; yet this sudden violence
contrasts with his grace and favor
toward his devotees (bhakta), by whom
he is given the name “quickly satisfied”
(Ashutosh) and to whom he will give
almost everything. Although he is por-
trayed as simple and without deceit (as
Bholanath, the “simple lord”), he is also
traditionally described as the expositor
of the tantras, the most secret and
hidden religious practice of all. This
transcendence of all opposites can be
seen in the images that commonly
represent him: in his form as Nataraja,
in which many of these contrary attrib-
utes are shown, or as Ardhanarishvara,
in which the image is half male and half
female. This transcendence of duality
is also visible in the linga, the
pillar-shaped object that is his symbolic
form, whose base and shaft are inter-
preted as symbolizing male and female
reproductive organs. Finally, one can
see this transcendence in the tantric
conception of the subtle body (the
system of psychic centers, or chakras,
that run throughout the human body),
in which religious practice aims for the
union of Shiva and Shakti. As Wendy
Doniger O’Flaherty points out, through
his actions Shiva embodies all the
contradictory possibilities for human
experience, and in mythic form provides
a resolution that one ordinary human
life can never provide.
In medieval times Shiva’s devotees
developed a doctrine of avatars (incar-
nations of Shiva who take the form of a
variety of saints, sages, and minor
deities who appear on earth to restore
balance and perform other necessary
acts), probably in response to the older
and better developed notion of avatars
of Vishnu. Unlike Vishnu’s avatars,
Shiva’s do not seem to have been a way
to create a place for smaller existing
deities in the larger pantheon. Of Shiva’s
twenty-one avatars, the most important
one is Hanuman, who is the only one
with a well-established independent
cult. The others were sages (such as
Durvasas) and important beings, but
the worship of Shiva’s avatars has never
upstaged the worship of Shiva himself,
as has often happened with Vishnu. For
further information on the mythology of
Shiva, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty
Shiva, 1981; and Stella Kramrisch, The
Presence of Shiva, 1981. See also Shaiva.
Shivaga-Sindamani
By far the latest of the three Tamil epics,
written perhaps in the late sixth century.
The story describes the adventures
of Shivaga, a man who excels at every
possible manly art, who with each
new challenge wins a new wife for
his harem but in the end renounces
everything to become a Jain monk.
Although the story clearly has a Jain
bias, the Shivaga-Sindamani paints a
[[635]]

useful picture of contemporary south-
ern Indian life.
Shivaji
(1627–1680) Maratha chieftain who
carved out an independent kingdom in
western Maharashtra and Goa, and was
able to hold onto it despite the efforts of
the Moghul emperor Aurangzeb to take
it back. Shivaji’s father Shahji was a
Moghul governor in the city of Bijapur,
and Shivaji began his operations as a
robber chief there. He gained the sup-
port of the local Maratha people, and his
first important conquest was a hill fort
near the city of Pune. From there he
expanded his territory and consolidated
his power, building forts to hold the ter-
ritory. Shivaji was a devout Hindu,
which undoubtedly helped gain him
support from the common people. In
modern times his Hindu roots, and his
opposition to Moghul rule, have
[[636]]

transformed him into a Hindu national-
ist hero, particularly in Maharashtra. See
also Moghul dynasty.
Shivananda, Swami
(1887–1963) Hindu ascetic, teacher, and
founder of the Divine Life Society.
Shivananda’s first calling was to be a
doctor; after getting his degree, he spent
some time practicing medicine in
Malaysia, spurred by a passion to serve
others. Later in life he felt the call of
renunciation and, in 1924, settled in
Rishikesh, where he was based for the
rest of his life. Shivananda’s message
stressed the teachings of the Advaita
Vedanta school, which is devoted to a
belief in monism (the belief in a single
Ultimate Reality where all things are
united), and the practice of yoga for a
disciplined life. He saw his own mission
as teaching others, a mission fostered by
the Divine Life Society’s publications,Shiwalik Goddesses
which continue to be important today.
Shivananda’s learning and religious
charisma made him greatly respected,
and in keeping with his original voca-
tion, one of the charitable works spon-
sored by the Divine Life Society is a free
medical clinic. For further information
see David Miller, “The Divine Life
Society Movement,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Shiva Purana
One of the eighteen traditional puranas,
which were an important genre of smrti
texts and the repository of much of tra-
ditional Indian mythology. The smrtis,
or “remembered” texts, were a class of
literature, which, although deemed
important, were considered less author-
itative than the shrutis or “heard” texts.
In brief, the shrutis included the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, whereas the smrtis
included the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana, the dharma literature, the
Bhagavad Gita, and the puranas. The
puranas are the collection of all types of
sacred lore, from mythic tales to ritual
instruction to exaltation of various
sacred sites (tirthas) and actions. Most
of the puranas stress the worship of
one deity as supreme over all others
and as this one’s name clearly shows
it is focused on the worship of Shiva.
The Shiva Purana is one of the
longer and larger puranas. It gives an
exhaustive account of Shiva’s mythic
deeds—many of which have become
the common mythology for many
traditional Hindus—as well as instruc-
tions for how, where, and when Shiva is
to be worshiped.
Shivaratri
(“Night of Shiva”) The most important
annual festival for devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, celebrated on the four-
teenth day of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March).
Worshipers
of
Shiva on this night are said to receive
unlimited religious benefits. The obser-
vances for this festival fall into three
general categories: fasting (upavasa),
wakefulness, and worship. Those fast-
ing on Shivaratri must abstain from all
grains—which define the difference
between a “snack” and a “meal”—but
are free to eat all other things. During
the night observers stay awake, prefer-
ably at a temple, relating and listening to
Shiva’s mythic exploits, and worship
Shiva early the next morning. Shivaratri
is a major Indian festival, and in many
places the readings and discourses are
broadcast through loudspeakers, so
that those nearby may also share the
religious merit.
The charter myth for this festival
describes the power of any religious
observances performed on this day,
even if unknowingly. According to the
story, a hunter lost in the woods on the
evening of Shivaratri climbs a tree for
safety, and spends the night. Unknown
to him, at the base of the tree is a linga,
the pillar-shaped object which is Shiva’s
symbolic form. The hunter passes a cold
and miserable night, and through his
shivering shakes the tree, sending dew
and leaves from the tree as offerings
onto the linga; upon descending the tree
he kneels to pick up an arrow he has
dropped during the night and thus
kneels before the linga. Despite a life-
time of bad karma generated by his
livelihood as a hunter, the religious
merit from this unknowing observance
brought this hunter to the abode of
Shiva on his death, and to a later rebirth
as a king.
Shiwalik Goddesses
Local goddesses from the Shiwalik hills
separating the Himalayas from the
northern Indian plain. Some have little
importance beyond the borders of their
particular villages, whereas others have
become important regional deities. As
with all the goddesses of India, the
Shiwalik goddesses are considered to be
manifestations of the same feminine
divine energy—the Goddess. As one
[[637]]
Shiwalik Hills
sign of this identity, many of these sites
are claimed to be Shakti Pithas—places
where a part of the dismembered god-
dess Sati fell to earth and took form as a
different goddess. Shiwalik goddesses
are also thought of as relatives. Kathleen
Erndl mentions seven goddesses, known
as the Seven Sisters: Vaishno Devi,
Jwalamukhi, Vajreshvari Devi, Chinta-
purni, Naina Devi, Chamunda, and
Mansa Devi. Modern Hindi language
sources list nine—the seven just men-
tioned plus Shakumbhari Devi and
Kalika Devi. This group of nine is scat-
tered in three different Indian states
along the Shiwalik Range: Seven are in
Himachal Pradesh, Vaishno Devi is in
Jammu and Kashmir, and Shakumbhari
Devi is in Uttar Pradesh. The pantheon
here is fairly flexible, and the goddesses
mentioned in these lists will probably
vary over time, partly reflecting the suc-
cess or failure to establish the holiness
of these sites. For further information on
the Shiwalik goddesses and worship of
the Mother Goddess in northwestern
India, see Kathleen Erndl, Victory To The
Mother, 1993. See also pitha.
Shiwalik Hills
Himalayan foothills running through
the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh,
Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and
Kashmir. The hills are an ecological
transition zone between the plains
and the mountains but have their own
religious ecology as well. Whereas the
sites high in the Himalayas are often
associated with Shiva, the primary
sacred sites (tirthas) in the Shiwaliks are
associated with the Goddess. See also
Shiwalik goddesses.
Shraddha
(“faithful”) Ancestral memorial rite, per-
formed either for one specific person
(ekoddishta), or for a group in which the
primary beneficiaries were one’s three
paternal ancestors (parvana).
An ekoddishta shraddha is usually
first performed on the eleventh day after
[[638]]

a person’s death, although it may be
repeated on the anniversary of the
death. It is also usually performed every
year during the Pitrpaksha, a two-week
period specifically devoted to such rites,
on the lunar day during this period that
corresponds to the lunar day of death.
A parvana shraddha can be per-
formed on a number of different occa-
sions, for a number of different rea-
sons. In the dharma literature and its
commentaries, shraddhas are classi-
fied as falling in all three categories of
ritual action: nitya, naimittika, and
kamya. Certain shraddhas are obliga-
tory (nitya) because they are pre-
scribed for certain particular times,
such as during the Pitrpaksha. Other
shraddhas are occasional (naimittika)
because they are necessary only under
certain conditions, such as the obliga-
tion to give a tirtha shraddha when
one visits a pilgrimage place (tirtha).
Finally, certain shraddhas are freely
performed because of the desire (kama)
for certain benefits from them—usually
conceived as the well-being of one’s
ancestors—and these are desiderative
(kamya) shraddhas.
Whatever the motive for giving the
shraddha, the general procedure always
has two particular features: symbolically
feeding one’s ancestor(s) by offering
balls of cooked grain (pindas), and feed-
ing real food to a group of brahmins (the
group with the highest social status in
Hinduism) representing one’s ancestors.
Each of these parts is given a great deal
of ritual elaboration, and there is con-
siderable disagreement about which
should come first, but in modern times
offering the pindas generally precedes
the meal. Many texts exalt the spiritual
merits generated from feeding brah-
mins, but this is hardly surprising, since
most of these texts were written by brah-
mins, and for many brahmins living at
pilgrimage places these shraddhas were
(and remain) an important part of their
livelihood. However, many people deem
this livelihood parasitic, and it is also
potentially inauspicious, since it is
gained through rites performed for theShrauta Sutras
dead. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane, A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.
Shraddhanand, Swami
(b. Lala Munshi Ram, d. 1926) Key figure
in the development of the Arya Samaj, a
modern Hindu reformist movement.
Shraddanand was born in Punjab and
got a law degree from the Government
College in Lahore, but was most influen-
tial through his support for the Arya
Samaj’s educational institutions. His
greatest work was establishing the
Gurukul Kangri near the sacred city of
Haridwar in 1901. The Gurukul
(“teacher’s household”) was a boarding
school where Arya Samaj children could
be raised with “progressive” Arya values,
far from the corrupting influences of tra-
ditional mainstream Hindu society. This
model was based on the Vedas, the ear-
liest Hindu religious texts, which the
Arya Samaj took as the sole religious
authority, and in which a student would
live as a member of his teacher’s family.
Educationally, the curriculum stressed
the arts and sciences necessary for a
“modern” education, but also traditional
Sanskrit learning, particularly of the
Vedas. Shraddhanand became a Sanyasi
in 1917 but continued to support politi-
cal causes, particularly Indian social and
political leader Mohandas Gandhi’s
[[1919]]
 call for non-cooperation with the
British government. His fervor and
strength of character made him an
unpopular figure, and he was assassi-
nated by a Muslim in 1926.
Shramana
(from the Sanskrit verb shram, “to
strive”) General term denoting religious
adepts from the middle of the first mil-
lennium before the common era whose
beliefs stressed renunciation, ascetic
practices, and the search for intuitive
insights. Shramana religious practice
was individualist, experiential, free-
form, and independent of society. All of
these qualities put them in religious
competition with the brahmin priests,
whose practice stressed mastery of
sacred texts and performing enormously
complex rituals; the need for sponsors
for these rituals made brahmin religion
“establishment” religion, serving its
patron classes. Indian grammarians use
the pair shramana and brahmin to illus-
trate typically bitter opponents, along
with examples such as mongoose and
cobra, and their difference seems to be
between a religious model stressing
individual charisma (shramana), and
one stressing highly trained technical
expertise (brahmin). Part of the shra-
mana tradition remained outside the
Hindu fold by virtue of resolutely reject-
ing the authority of the Vedas; the Jains,
Buddhists, Ajivikas, and other religious
groups developed as a result of this
rejection of the Vedas. Part of the shra-
mana tradition was absorbed into tradi-
tional Hinduism in the dharma litera-
ture, which found a place for renunciant
asceticism in the form of the Sanyasi,
the last of the four traditional stages
of life (ashramas). For further informa-
tion on the shramanas and the
development of this tradition, see
Padmanabh S. Jaini, “Sramanas: Their
Conflict with Brahmanical Society,” in
Joseph Elder (ed.), Chapters in Indian
Civilization, 1970.
Shrauta Sutras
(“aphorisms on Vedic rituals”) A set of
brief sayings (4th c. B.C.E.) explaining the
ritual instructions for performing the
public sacrifices prescribed in the
Vedas, the earliest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts. Such sacrifi-
cial instructions had been prescribed in
the Brahmana literature—itself consid-
ered part of the Veda—but with the pas-
sage of time the Brahmanas had become
too complex and difficult to understand.
The Shrauta Sutras were essentially
manuals for the priests presiding over
the Vedic sacrifices, composed to ensure
that the sacrifices would be performed
correctly. Aside from instructions for
[[639]]
Shravan
performing the sacrifice, the Shrauta
Sutras also contained an appendix with
the exact measurements for the sacred
altar, known as the Sulva Sutras. In the-
ory, the Shrauta Sutras were the first part
of a Kalpa Sutra, which would also con-
tain prescriptions for domestic rites
(Grhya Sutras) and appropriate human
behavior (Dharma Sutras), with each
Kalpa Sutra being connected to one of
the four Vedas. But in practice the story
of the Shrauta Sutras is far more
complex, since aside from the three
complete Kalpa Sutras that have
survived, by Apastamba, Baudhayana,
and Hiranyakeshin, there are other
Shrauta Sutras, indicating a more
independent composition.
Shravan
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Shravan is the fifth month
in the lunar year, usually falling within
July and August. In northern India
Shravan is associated with the rains, the
breaking of the heat and revival of the
land, and a general feeling of release.
The major holidays in Shravan are Nag
Panchami, Kamika Ekadashi, Tulsidas
Jayanti, Putrada Ekadashi, and Raksha
Bandhan. In addition, the entire
month is deemed sacred to the god
Shiva, with all Mondays and the
Shravan Vrat marked out as times for
particular observances.
Shravan Vrat
Religious vow (vrat) performed during
the entire lunar month of Shravan
(July–August), which is dedicated to the
god Shiva. During this month devotees
(bhakta) will perform various acts of
homage, abstinence, and worship,
although the strictness of this obser-
vance depends largely on individual
inclination. Some worshipers observe a
vow on each Monday of Shravan to wor-
ship Shiva (Monday is the day of the
week over which he presides). The
observant will fast (upavasa) during the
[[640]]

day, worship Shiva and members of his
“family” (Ganesh, Parvati, and Nandi),
and sometimes stay up late into the
night reciting Shiva’s mythic deeds.
Some devotees will also refrain
from cutting their hair and shaving
their beards during this month, in
imitation of Shiva’s primary identity as
the great ascetic.
Another observance falling in
Shravan is the festival of kanvars, in
which devotees draw pots of water from
the Ganges, suspend them from a bam-
boo pole (kanvar), and carry this water
to a Shiva temple, where it is offered to
Shiva. This practice occurs in many
places throughout northern India, but
the most famous place is at Deoghar in
the state of Bihar. There Shiva is present
in his form as Vaidyanath (“Lord of
Physicians”), and the image of
Vaidyanath at Deoghar is one of the
twelve jyotirlingas (images considered
especially sacred). Pilgrims going to
Deoghar draw their water from the
Ganges at Sultanganj, and then walk to
Deoghar to offer the water, a distance of
over sixty miles. This particular obser-
vance combines devotion to God with
the willingness to suffer hardship; it is
often performed to fulfill a vow made
when asking for some divine favor. See
also Solah Somvar Vrat.
Shri
(“auspicious,” “bringing good fortune”)
Epithet of the goddess Lakshmi, reflect-
ing her identification with luck, fortune,
and prosperity. See Lakshmi.
Shri Aurobindo
Name taken by the Indian philosopher
and social activist Aurobindo Ghose after
retiring from political life to become an
ascetic. See Aurobindo Ghose.
Shrichakra
Symbolic diagram (yantra) used in wor-
ship by the Shrividya school, a branch
of the secret, ritually based religious
practice known as tantra. TheShrinathji
Shrichakra is a set of nine interlocking
triangles with four pointing up and five
pointing down. The figure is surrounded
by a double series of lotus petals, then
an enclosing circle, and finally angular
exterior walls. In the center of the dia-
gram is a single point known as the
bindu, representing the ultimate divinity
that is the source of all things. The
shrichakra is considered a subtle form of
the goddess Lalita Tripurasundari, a
goddess who is identified with different
local goddesses throughout southern
India. Lalita Tripurasundari is consid-
ered a “textual” goddess since she
appears as an object of worship in the
Shrichakra diagram but has no temple
or image. The Shrichakra is used as a rit-
ual aid during the rite known as
samharakrama, in which the adept
symbolically destroys the external
world and ideas of a separate Self to
become completely identified with
this goddess, who is considered the
source of all reality. For extensive
information on the Shrichakra, see
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Shrichandra
(b. 1494–1612?) Historical founder of the
Udasi (“indifferent”) ascetic community.
Shrichandra was the elder son of Guru
Nanak, the first of the Sikh community’s
ten gurus. By all accounts, Shrichandra
was a devout and pious man, but Nanak
passed over Shrichandra to designate
one of his followers, Angad, as the second
Sikh guru. According to tradition this was
because Guru Nanak, believing that his
followers should live married lives in reg-
ular society, disapproved of Shrichandra’s
status as ascetic. Due to his pedigree and
his piety, Shrichandra gained a consider-
able following of his own, but the Udasis
have always been considered as belong-
ing in the Hindu fold. During the
Kumbha Mela, an important bathing
(snana) festival held in different places in
northern India, the Udasis march third in
the bathing procession, behind the
Sanyasis and the Bairagis.
Shrikrishnavali
(“Series [of poems] to Krishna”) Series
of sixty-one short poems dedicated to
the god Krishna, written in the Braj
Bhasha form of Hindi by the poet-saint
Tulsidas (1532–1623?). This collection is
unusual, since Tulsidas is renowned as a
devotee (bhakta) of the god Rama, and
most of his literary work describes
Rama’s exploits. The Shrikrishnavali is a
poetic cycle about Krishna’s life, so it
begins with poems devoted to Krishna’s
childhood and youth in the Braj region.
Most of the text, however, describes the
sorrow of the cow herd girls (gopis) after
Krishna’s departure for his kingdom in
Mathura, and their scornful rejection of
Krishna’s messenger Uddhava, who tries
to convince them that since Krishna is
the supreme deity, he is everywhere.
This work is an example of the ecumeni-
cal, or universal, tendencies found
throughout Tulsidas’s work. Not only
did he compose poems in praise
of another deity, thus transcending
sectarian barriers, but he also tran-
scended linguistic barriers by writing
these poems in Braj Bhasha, the most
widely read language of his time, rather
than his own native Avadhi.
Shrinathji
The name of a particular image of the
god Krishna, the presiding deity of the
Shrinathji temple in Nathdwara,
Rajasthan. According to tradition, the
image was originally hidden on top of
Mount Govardhan, a famous mountain
in the Braj region that is mythically
associated with Krishna’s humiliation of
the storm-god Indra. The image’s loca-
tion was revealed in a dream to
Vallabhacharya, the founder of the reli-
gious community known as the Pushti
Marg. Vallabhacharya built a temple to
house the image on Mount Govardhan,
and his descendants have remained
Shrinathji’s hereditary servants since
that time. The image was taken to
Rajasthan in 1669, a move prompted by
fears that it would be destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb. According
[[641]]
Shringeri
Shrirangam, an island in the Cauvery River, contains the Ranganathaswamy Temple,
dedicated to the god Vishnu.
to tradition Shrinathji revealed his
wish to stay in Nathdwara by sinking
his wagon’s wheels deep into the earth,
so that it could not go further. A new
temple was erected and dedicated in
[[1672]]
, and the image has remained there
ever since.
Whether or not one accepts the claim
of the divine mandate, much of the story
seems reasonable. Given the proximity
of Braj to Agra, the Moghul capital,
keepers of well-known images might
have been concerned about their safety,
and since the neighboring state of
Rajasthan was controlled by the
Moghuls’ Hindu vassals, this would have
been an obvious place to go. Even today
Nathdwara is in a remote and thinly set-
tled region of Rajasthan, which indicates
that in earlier times it would have been a
place of refuge. The Nathdwara temple
is particularly important to the Pushti
[[642]]

Marg, a religious community devoted
to the god Krishna, who play the major
role in administering it. For more
information see Rajendra Jindel, Culture
Of a Sacred Town, 1976. See also

Shringeri
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in eastern
Karnataka, about 160 miles west of
Bangalore. Although Shringeri is a very
small town, it is religiously significant as
the home of the Shringeri Math, one
of the four Dashanami maths, the
monastic centers believed to have
been established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The ascetics of the
Shringeri math have a reputation for
very strict adherence to traditional prac-
tice, and the town has a long standing as
a center for religious learning.Shri Sampraday
Shringeri Math
One of the four maths or monastic cen-
ters traditionally believed to have been
established by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya; the others are the
Jyotir Math, Sharada Math, and
Govardhan Math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Shringeri Math
is in the southern quarter, in the city of
Shringeri in the southern Indian state of
Karnataka. Shankaracharya is tradi-
tionally cited as the founder of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, the most presti-
gious Hindu ascetic order. The
Dashanami (“ten names”) ascetics are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, who
are divided into ten divisions, each with
a different name. These ten divisions are
organized into four larger organizational
groups—Anandawara, Bhogawara, Bhuri-
wara, and Kitawara—each of which has
two or three of the ten divisions, and
each of which is associated with one of
the four sacred centers. Of these, the
Shringeri Math is associated with the
Bhuriwara group.
Shrirangam
Island in the Cauvery River, just north of
the town of Tiruchirappalli in the state
of Tamil Nadu. The site is most famous
for the Ranganathaswamy Temple, ded-
icated to the god Vishnu in his form as
Ranganatha, who is sleeping on the
back of his serpent couch Shesha in the
sea of cosmic dissolution (pralaya). The
temple is built in the Dravida style of
architecture, in which the temple build-
ings are of modest height but cover an
immensely large area and are surrounded
by a boundary wall with massive towers
(gopurams) over each wall’s central
gateway. In the temple’s outer zones one
often finds shops and houses, making
such temples veritable cities in their
own right. The Ranganathaswamy tem-
ple has a series of seven concentric pro-
cessional streets, making it one of the
largest temples in India. It was built in
stages by the various dynasties that
controlled this part of southern India—
Chera, Pandya, Chola, Hoysala, and
Vijayanagar—although the bulk of the
construction was done by the last two.
Since Vishnu’s image is that of the divine
king, it is hardly surprising that each of
these regional dynasties patronized this
site, as a way of using this divine
imagery to support and validate their
own right to rule.
Shrirangapatnam
Demolished fortress city just outside the
city of Mysore in the state of Karnataka.
Shrirangapatnam formerly served as the
capital of Tipu Sultan (r. 1782–1799), the
last ruler of Mysore. Throughout his
reign he fought against the encroach-
ment of outside powers. However, in
[[1799]]
 he unsuccessfully took up arms
against the British and was killed in bat-
tle, leaving the city largely destroyed.
The city got its name from a temple
there to the god Ranganatha, a form of
Vishnu in which he is sleeping on his
serpent couch Shesha in the sea of cos-
mic dissolution (pralaya). The temple
survived the demolition and is still func-
tioning today. Ranganatha is considered
a divine king, and his most famous
image, on the island of Shrirangam in
Tamil Nadu, has strong associations
with southern Indian kings and king-
ship. Even though Tipu was a Muslim,
invoking Ranganatha’s powerful sym-
bolism would have been an astute polit-
ical move, to legitimate his rule in the
eyes of his Hindu subjects.
Shri Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday)
of the Bairagi Naga ascetics. The Bairagi
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, organized in military fashion
into different anis or “armies.” Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century
their primary occupation was as merce-
nary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these have largely disappeared in con-
temporary times. The Shri Sampraday
[[643]]
Shrishaila
traces its spiritual lineage through the
poet-saint Ramananda to the southern
Indian philosopher Ramanuja, who is
claimed to have been Ramananda’s guru.
This claim can also be seen in the name
of the sampraday, since Ramanuja’s fol-
lowers, the Shrivaishnavas, focus their
worship on Vishnu and Shri (Lakshmi).
Yet the Ramanandi ascetics worship an
entirely different pair of deities—Rama
and Sita—and the claim of any connec-
tions between the Ramanandis and the
Shrivaishnavas was formally renounced
at the Ujjain Kumbha Mela in 1921, at
the insistence of the Shrivaishnavas. As
with another Bairagi order, the Brahma
Sampraday, the claim to be connected
to a famous religious figure seems to be
a way to gain the authority and prestige
of an ancient and established tradition.
Even without this claim, the Shri
Sampraday is the largest and the most
important of the Bairagi Naga orders.
For further information see Peter van
der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988.
Shrishaila
(“holy mountain”) Sacred mountain in
the center of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, about 185 miles south and
slightly east of Hyderabad. The site is
remote and difficult to reach but is
famous for a temple sacred to the god
Shiva, in his manifestation as Malli-
karjuna, “[Lord] White as Jasmine.”
Shiva’s image as Mallikarjuna is in the
form of a linga, the pillar-shaped image
that is his symbolic form, and the
Mallikarjuna linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites deemed
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is uniquely present.
Shrivaishnava
Southern Indian religious community
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu and Shri (Lakshmi), and whose
religious life is rooted in the devotional
hymns of the Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
[[644]]

centuries. All the Alvars were devotees of
Vishnu, and their stress on passionate
devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language, transformed and revi-
talized Hindu religious life. Two cen-
turies later, the Alvars’ devotional out-
pouring was organized and system-
atized by the philosopher Ramanuja,
considered the Shrivaishnava founder.
Ramanuja was convinced that Brahman,
or Supreme Reality, was a personal
deity, rather than an impersonal
abstract principle, and was also con-
vinced that devotion was the most
important form of religious practice.
Vishishthadvaita Vedanta, his philo-
sophical position, stressed both of these
convictions, and thus opposed the
Advaita Vedanta school founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, which
stressed that the Supreme Being was
impersonal and that realization (jnana)
was the best spiritual path. In the time
after Ramanuja the Shrivaishnava com-
munity split into two smaller groups, the
Tengalai and the Vadagalai. The schism
stemmed from a disagreement over
whether human action was necessary to
attain final liberation, or whether the
hope came in complete surrender (pra-
patti) to God’s grace; the Vadagalais held
the former position, and the Tengalais
the latter.
In practice, the Shrivaishnava com-
munity has been strongly influenced by
the doctrine of divine “emanations”
originated by the Pancharatra religious
community, particularly the notion that
a properly consecrated image becomes
a form of the deity itself. Shrivaishnava
piety has tended to center around
temples, and particularly the service of
the temple’s image, which is considered
a genuine form of the deity. Given
this stress on learning and temple-
based worship, it is not surprising
that the community has been dominated
by brahmins, and the few non-
brahmins in the community have
distinctly inferior status. For further
information see K. Rangachari, The
Sri Vaisnava Brahmans, 1931; andShuddadvaita
John Braisted Carman, The Theology of
Ramanuja, 1974.based religious practice known as
tantra. See Shrichakra.
ShrivatsaShrutashravas
An auspicious mark on the god Vishnu’s
chest, also found on Vishnu’s form as
Krishna, which is sometimes described
as a mole and sometimes as a curl of
hair. In statues and pictures, the
Shrivatsa is usually portrayed as a four-
petaled flower, and it is believed to be
the kaustubha jewel, which was one of
the precious things churned from the
Ocean of Milk along with the goddess
Lakshmi, the wishing-cow Surabhi, and
amrta, the nectar of immortality. See
also Tortoise avatar.In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Krishna’s paternal
aunt and the mother of Shishupala.
Shrividya
Southern Indian school of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
in which the principal deity is the
goddess Lalita Tripurasundari. The
Shrividya tradition is noted for its ritual
use of the shrichakra, a particular sym-
bolic diagram (yantra) composed of a
series of interlocking triangles. The
Shrichakra ritual is known as samhara-
krama, and is a systematic ritual decon-
struction of the perceivable world and
all illusions of duality, to attain union
with the single true reality. The interior
counterpart to this exterior ritual is the
practice of kundalini yoga, which is
based on the tantric idea of the subtle
body—the six psychic centers (chakras)
running along the spine—and seeks to
gain ultimate union within the aspirant’s
own body by bringing together the
microcosmic forms of the deities Shiva
and Shakti that exist within the body.
For a careful and considered picture of
the Shrividya tradition, see Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Shriyantra
Another name for the Shrichakra, a
symbolic diagram (yantra) used in
worship by the Shrividya school, a
particular branch of the secret, ritually
Shruti
(“[that which is] heard”) The most
authoritative type of Hindu sacred liter-
ature, made up of all the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts. The Vedas are
generally considered to have four types
of texts: the hymns to the gods known as
samhitas, the ritual manuals called the
Brahmanas, and the speculative texts
known as the Aranyakas and the
Upanishads. The term comes from the
traditional Hindu belief that these texts
were not composed by human beings
but are based in the primordial vibra-
tions of the cosmos itself. The ancient
sages, whose faculties of perception had
been sharpened through persistent reli-
gious practice, were able to “hear” and
understand these vibrations, and trans-
mitted them to others in a lineage of
learning. Thus, the belief that their ori-
gin is nonhuman makes the shruti the
highest religious authority.
Shuddadvaita
(“pure monism”) Philosophical school
first propounded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531). Vallabha called his school
shuddadvaita, or “pure monism,” to dis-
tinguish it from the Advaita Vedanta
school founded by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The latter school pro-
pounds “nondual” (advaita) monism, in
its claim that a single Ultimate Reality
lies behind all things, and that all things
are merely differing forms of that reality.
The Advaitins call this single reality
Brahman, which they conceive as form-
less, impersonal, and having no defining
attributes except for being, conscious-
ness, and bliss (sacchidananda). In the
Advaita understanding, since all
conceptions of particular deities have
[[645]]
Shuddhi
specific attributes, they are thus condi-
tioned forms of the ultimate Brahman.
In fact, any assumption that the world
as it appears is real is a fundamental
misunderstanding that ultimately
causes human beings to be trapped
in karmic bondage, reincarnation
(samsara), and suffering.
Shankaracharya’s philosophical posi-
tion was based primarily on the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
texts, and particularly on the
Upanishads, the speculative texts that
are the latest part of the Vedas.
Vallabhacharya used both of these
sources in framing his Shuddadvaita
school, but also used the Bhagavata
Purana, which he considered to be of
equal authority. The Bhagavata Purana
is one of the later sectarian collections
known as puranas. It is the most impor-
tant source for the worship of the god
Krishna, whom Vallabha considered to
be the ultimate manifestation of the
Supreme Being, rather than the unqual-
ified
Brahman
promoted
by
Shankaracharya. Aside from promoting
a personal conception of the deity over
an impersonal conception, another dif-
ference in the two schools concerned
the status of the world. For
Vallabhacharya, the world as perceived
is not an illusion but is real, because it
and human beings have both evolved
from God through the exercise of his
supreme power. Krishna is conceived
in the traditional threefold divine aspect
as being–consciousness–bliss. Living
beings possess being and conscious-
ness, but not the divine bliss, whereas
the material, nonliving, world has
only being. Since this conception
gives real value to the everyday
world, Vallabhacharya described it as
“pure monism.”
In Vallabhacharya’s system God is the
inner controller of all souls, which
makes human beings dependent on
God for thinking and perception
(pratyaksha). This dependence on God
highlights the importance of grace,
which he refers to as pushti, meaning
“that which nourishes the soul.”
[[646]]

Because of this emphasis on grace,
Vallabhacharya’s religious community is
also known as the Pushti Marg. The
Pushti Marg believes that God’s favor is
gained through devotion (bhakti),
which is open to all and for which there
are no prerequisites. The emphasis
on devotion has marginalized all
other forms of religious practice, and
the Pushti Marg is particularly known
for rejecting all ascetic endeavors,
such as celibacy, fasting (upavasa), or
renunciation. Its members tend to be
householders coming from merchant
families, particularly from the state of
Gujarat. The community’s primary
temple is at Nathdwara in the state of
Rajasthan. For further information see
Richard Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacarya, 1976.
Shuddhi
(“purification”) Any ritual purification
that removes impurities and thus
returns one to a state of ritual purity.
In a more specialized context the
term denotes the “reconversion” back
to Hinduism of people who had
either converted to another religion
or who had adopted practices
characteristic of other religious tradi-
tions. This practice was first instituted
in the 1890s by the reformist Arya
Samaj, led by Swami Dayanand
Saraswati. There was a tremendous
stir in the Sikh community when several
Sikhs were a part of a group thus
“purified,” and in Sikh accounts
this
threat
of
reabsorption
into the Hindu community was one
of the major forces behind the Singh
Sabha movement, which defined
the Sikhs as a separate religious commu-
nity. In modern times this practice has
been employed by the Hindu nationalist
organization Vishva Hindu Parishad,
which has used it to “purify” certain
groups who had adopted some
Islamic practices.Shukra
Shudra
Among the four major social groups
(varnas) in the traditional Hindu soci-
ety, the shudras are the lowest and least
influential. In this model, the shudras’
social function was to serve all the oth-
ers. This low social status is reflected in
the creation story known as the Purusha
Sukta, in which the shudras are
described as being created from the
Primeval Man’s feet. The feet are the
lowest and basest part of the body, and
the shudra was correspondingly seen as
the lowest level of caste Hindu society.
Unlike members of the “twice-born”
varnas—brahmin, kshatriya, and
vaishya—whose adolescent males were
entitled to have a ritual second birth
that entitled them to study the Veda,
shudras were always once-born, and
thus forbidden to study or even to hear
the Veda. In practice the status of shu-
dras differed widely from region to
region—in southern India, many of the
land-owning jatis (endogamous social
subgroups) were shudras, and they were
very influential communities. At the
very least, they were accorded a defini-
tive place in caste Hinduism, unlike the
untouchables, who were considered
completely impure, usually because of
their hereditary occupations.
Shudraka
(early 5th c.) Playwright and author of
the Mrcchakatika (“The Little Clay
Cart”). This drama describes the love
between a poor but noble brahmin,
Charudatta, and a wealthy but virtuous
courtesan, Vasantasena, set in the con-
text of a complicated political intrigue. It
is notable for its detailed portrayal of
everyday urban life, exemplified by the
little clay cart, which is a child’s toy. It
has been translated into several lan-
guages, and is periodically performed
for modern American audiences.
Shuka
(“parrot”) In Hindu mythology, a sage
whose life story upholds the traditional
doctrine of the four stages of life (ashra-
mas). Shuka was the son of the sage
Vyasa, born when Vyasa had a seminal
emission upon seeing a celestial nymph
(apsara) in the form of a parrot. From
boyhood Shuka was interested only in
spiritual life and had the firm desire
never to marry, but despite intensive
spiritual study he could not find con-
tentment. He eventually decided to visit
the sage-king Janaka, who advised
Shuka that he could rightly consider
renunciation only after having married
and raised a family. Shuka returned
home to his father and lived the house-
holder’s life; later in life he took
up renunciation again and became
perfectly realized.
Shuka Sampraday
Another name for the Charanadasi reli-
gious community, since their founder
Charanadas was believed to have
received initiation from the sage Shuka.
See Charanadasi.
Shukla Paksha
(“light half”) Name denoting the waxing
half of a lunar month, so called because
the moon’s light increases every night.
Shukra
In Hindu mythology, the religious
teacher (guru) of the type of demons
known as asuras. Shukra is a well-
known figure who appears most promi-
nently in the tale of the Vamana avatar.
In this tale, the Asura king Bali is per-
forming a great sacrifice. He is
approached by the god Vishnu, who has
taken the form of a dwarf (vamana), and
asks Bali for three paces of land to build
a sacrificial altar. Shukra suspects a
trick, and warns Bali not to grant it, but
Bali ignores Shukra’s cautionary advice.
As soon as Bali grants the gift, the dwarf
grows immensely large. With his first
two steps Vishnu measures out the cos-
mos, and with his third pushes Bali
down into the underworld, where he is
allowed to reign as king.
[[647]]
Shula
The god Shiva carrying a shula, or lance, beside his wife Parvati.
The type of shula with which Shiva is associated is the trishul, or trident.
Shula
A lance or pike; one of the characteristic
weapons in Hindu iconography. The
most famous example of this is the tri-
dent (trishul), which has three points,
although the center one may be larger
than the side ones. This weapon is most
intimately associated with Shiva, but it
is also commonly carried by certain
powerful forms of the Goddess. This
may reflect her charter myth, in which
she was formed from the collected radi-
ance of all the gods and received dupli-
cates of their weapons from all of them.
The lance with a single blade is associated
with the god Skanda, particularly in his
[[648]]

southern Indian manifestation as
Murugan. When carried by Skanda-
Murugan, the lance is usually called
shakti (“power”), rather than shula.
Shumbha
In Hindu mythology, demon killed by
the goddess Kali in the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important text for
the mythology of the Goddess. Together
with his brother Nishumbha, Shumbha
is a general in the army of a demon
named Mahishasura, the figure whom
the Goddess takes form to destroy. Due
to a divine boon given to Mahishasura,Shvetashvatara Upanishad
Shumbha and Nishumbha are able to
conquer the gods and assume control of
heaven, but they are unable to resist the
power of the Goddess.
Shurpanakha
([having] “nails [like] winnowing-fans”)
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Shurpanakha is the
sister of Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Although she is a minor charac-
ter in the epic, she plays a pivotal role in
advancing the action of the story. As
Ravana’s sister, Shurpanakha is a demon
woman of high status, and is free to
choose her own husband according to
her inclinations. As she roams through
the forest one day, she happens to see
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, and is
immediately smitten by his handsome
form. Assuming the shape of a beautiful
woman, she approaches him and
expresses her desire for him. Rama tells
her that since he is already married, his
brother Lakshmana will be a more
appropriate match for her. When
Lakshmana gives her reasons why he
too cannot marry her, Shurpanakha
becomes angry. Realizing that Rama’s
wife Sita is the real impediment to her
desires, Shurpanakha tries to harm her,
and in the struggle that follows,
Lakshmana mutilates her by cutting off
her ears and her nose. Shrieking with
pain and humiliation, Shurpanakha
returns to her brother Ravana’s court,
who swears that her insult will be
avenged. After their brothers Khara and
Dushana are killed in a direct attack on
Rama, Ravana decides to get revenge by
kidnapping Sita, an action that eventu-
ally causes his own death.
Shvetaketu
A character in the Chandogya Upan-
ishad, one of the speculative texts that
form the latest stratum of the Vedas.
In the upanishad, Shvetaketu is the
son of Uddalaka Aruni, and a para-
digm for a seeker of knowledge.
Shvetaketu’s education also symbolizes
the conception of true knowledge found
in the Upanishads and the way that this
differs from earlier conceptions.
According to a story in the upanishad’s
sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent away by
his father to study the Vedas, and when
he returns twelve years later having
mastered all the Vedas, he incorrectly
considers himself learned. Shvetaketu’s
father punctures his arrogance, showing
him the difference between memoriza-
tion and true knowledge, by asking
Shvetaketu questions about the nature
of the cosmos. When Shvetaketu cannot
answer these, he admits his ignorance
and accepts instruction from his father
on the nature of the Self (atman). This
instruction contains the teaching “That
thou art” (tat tvam asi). This is one of
the “great statements” (mahavakya) in
Indian philosophy, and asserts the
ultimate nondifference between Brahman
and atman, the cosmos and the indi-
vidual Self.
Shvetashvatara Upanishad
A text generally regarded as one of the
latest upanishads, the speculative reli-
gious texts that themselves form the
most recent stratum of the Vedas. This
judgment is based on both the Shvet-
ashvatara Upanishad’s form and on its
content. Stylistically, the earliest upan-
ishads tend to be written in prose, or
prose mixed with verse, whereas the
later upanishads, including the Shvet-
ashvatara, are completely in verse. In
terms of content, the earlier upanishads
tend to be long and rambling, whereas
in the later ones the ideas are far more
concise and clearly developed. The
Shvetashvatara Upanishad’s most origi-
nal idea is its description of the
Supreme Being in completely theistic
terms, in contrast to the abstract,
impersonal representations in the earlier
upanishads. It identifies Ultimate
Reality as the god Rudra, who was later
identified with the god Shiva, one of the
most important modern Hindu deities.
The text is also notable for an explicit
description of the process and results of
[[649]]
Shyam
yoga, which is the first known written
explanation of this tradition.
Although it is best noted for these
new ideas, the upanishad also reveals
continuity with the older tradition. The
second chapter begins with an extended
invocation to the god Savitr (Surya),
the sun, using verses drawn directly
from Vedic texts composed a thousand
years earlier. Such anachronisms
indicate that there was no clear dividing
line between the four differing types
of Vedic text—samhita, Brahmana,
Aranyaka, and upanishad—but rather
that these textual styles were composed
in overlapping periods.
Shyam
(“black”) Epithet of the god Krishna,
based on the dark color of his skin.
See Krishna.
Siddha
(“perfected one”) Name for a religious
adept who is believed to have attained
the perfect knowledge, enlightenment,
and ultimate spiritual realization.
Siddhapith
(“seat of the perfected”) Name denoting
a site believed to have particular power
in conferring spiritual attainments upon
those who carry out religious practices
there. This power is usually tied to a
mythic charter in which a deity became
resident at the site—and is thus still pre-
sent to assist people—but such sites
have often been further sanctified by the
presence of charismatic ascetics whose
lives and spiritual discipline serve as
examples to others.
Siddhasana
(“perfected posture”) One of the com-
mon sitting postures (asana) used for
meditation. In this position one foot
(often the left) is placed with the heel in
the area between the anus and genitals,
with the other foot resting on the oppo-
site calf, turned so that the heel is
[[650]]

straight up. This is called the “perfected”
posture partly because of its difficulty—
only those perfected in yoga can do it—
but also because it is believed to bring
substantial spiritual benefits.
Siddhi
(“attainment”) The most common word
used to denote a superhuman power
or faculty. The siddhis are first referred
to in yoga’s founding text, the Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali (3.45), and are
traditionally said to number eight:
minuteness (anima), lightness (lagh-
ima), greatness (madhima), acquisition
(prapti), irresistible will (prakamyam),
control (vashitvam), superiority (ishit-
vam), and suppression of desire
(kamavasayitvam).
The possession of such siddhis is
generally seen as the evidence of high
spiritual attainment, but the attitude
toward the powers is mixed. They give
one great abilities, but they are also seen
as being highly seductive, since they can
be used for both good and evil. The abil-
ity to keep from being beguiled by them
is the true sign of spiritual maturity, and
a spiritually immature person could eas-
ily fall into using them for selfish pur-
poses. For this reason, religious aspi-
rants are discouraged from aiming to
gain such powers, since the very act of
seeking is considered a selfish desire. In
contrast, when one has gained such
powers as a by-product of spiritual
attainment, one is believed to be able to
keep them in proper perspective.
Simantonnayana Samskara
Traditionally, the third of the life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras), and the last of
the prenatal samskaras. This was per-
formed when the pregnancy was further
advanced, although various writers gave
differing times for this. The major ele-
ment in this rite is the husband parting
the hair of his wife, supposedly to pro-
tect her from the misfortune and black
magic that are supposed to plague preg-
nant women. One can also interpretSinhastha Mela
parting the hair as symbolizing an easy
delivery, and since this was a rite of pro-
tection, it would also give the expectant
mother psychological assurance that
everything would be all right. One bit of
evidence supporting this interpretation
is that many of the dharma literature
writers classify this samskara as being
for the woman rather than the unborn
child, and as only needing to be per-
formed during the first pregnancy. This
samskara is seldom performed in
modern times.
Simhakarna
(“lion’s ear”) Another name for the hand
gesture (hasta) known as kataka hasta,
in which the fingers are loosely pressed
onto the thumb, creating a ring. This
particular name comes from the fanciful
notion that the shape of the hand
resembles a lion’s ear. See kataka hasta.
Simuka
(1st c. B.C.E.) Founder of the Satavahana
dynasty, which for over three centuries
ruled over much of central India and the
Malwa region from their capital in the
city of Paithan.
Singh, Ishvari Prasad Narayan
(r. 1835–1889) A Maharaja of Benares
who, with the help of local scholars,
wrote the dialogues (samvads) for the
characters in the Ramnagar Ram Lila.
The Ram Lilas are dramatized versions
of the epic Ramayana, which transcend
simple theater to become a form of wor-
ship. The Ram Lila at Ramnagar, the
fort that is home to the kings of
Benares, is the most famous and tradi-
tional of all these Ram Lilas. The
Ramnagar Ram Lila began because of
the royal family’s patronage, and the
annual performance is still sponsored
by them. Although they are no longer
the actual political rulers, the royal
family continues to play an important
ceremonial role. For further informa-

Singh, Udit Narayan
(r. 1796–1835) Maharaja of Benares
whose reign saw the first performances
of the Ram Lila at his palace in
Ramnagar. The Ram Lilas are drama-
tized versions of the epic Ramayana,
which transcend simple theater to
become a form of worship. The Ram
Lila at Ramnagar, the fort that is home to
the kings of Benares, is the most famous
and traditional of all these Ram Lilas.
According to tradition, the Maharaja
was a great devotee (bhakta) of the god
Rama and a patron of the Ram Lilas in
Benares itself, but on several occasions
found it difficult to get across the
Ganges because of the seasonal flood-
ing. As a solution to the problem, he
sponsored his own Ram Lila—no doubt
also symbolically intended to reinforce
his kingship—which has become the
oldest, most traditional, and most
important Ram Lila in Benares. Udit
Narayan
Singh
finalized
the
locations of the Ram Lila, which is
performed throughout the city, whereas
his son Ishvari Prasad Narayan Singh
was responsible for writing the
dialogues (samvads) spoken by the
characters. For further information see

Sinhastha Mela
Name for the Kumbha Mela festival held
in the holy city of Ujjain. The festival is
called Sinhastha because it is celebrated
when Jupiter is in Leo (Sinha). The
Sinhastha Mela’s climactic bathing
(snana) day comes on the full moon in
the lunar month of Baisakh (April–
May). The Kumbha Mela is a massive
religious festival celebrated at three-
year intervals in four different cities:
Haridwar, Allahabad, Ujjain, and
Nasik; the festival thus comes to each
city every twelve years. The Kumbha
Mela is chiefly a festival at which partic-
ipants bathe in sacred rivers. The festi-
val’s primary participants are ascetics,
who come from all over South Asia to
bathe in the sacred waters. According to
[[651]]

tradition, the Kumbha Mela was orga-
nized by the great philosopher Shan-
karacharya to promote regular gather-
ings of learned and holy men, as a
means to strengthen, sustain, and spread
Hindu religion.
The charter myth for the Kumbha
Mela is taken from the story of Churning
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has
been churned and the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta) has been extracted, the
[[652]]

gods and their demon opponents begin
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The
gods snatch the pot and run off with it,
but the one carrying the pot grows tired,
and in twelve days of carrying it sets it
on the ground in twelve different places.
Eight of the places are in heaven, but the
other four are on earth and these are the
four sites where the Mela is held. In each
place a bit of the nectar splashes on the
ground, sanctifying the site, and since aSita
divine day is considered to be a
human year, the twelve-year cycle is
established. According to popular
belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most
providential moment, the waters in
which people are bathing become the
nectar of immortality, and all those
who bathe in these waters gain
immeasurable religious merit.
Historically speaking, the two most
important sites have been Haridwar and
Allahabad; one measure of their domi-
nance is that they have held “half”
(ardha) Kumbha Melas after six years,
and that these have consistently drawn
bigger crowds than the “full” Kumbha
Melas at Ujjain and Nasik, which fall
during those times. In recent times,
however, political considerations have
increased the attendance at the
Sinhastha Mela. Ujjain is located in cen-
tral India, in the heartland of the Hindu
nationalist groups such as the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh, Vishva Hindu
Parishad, and Bharatiya Janata Party.
The city of Ujjain is also close to the
ancestral kingdom of Vijaya Raje
Scindia, the matriarch of a former royal
family and a prominent figure in the
Bharatiya Janata Party. In such a politi-
cal climate and local environment, the
Sinhastha Mela has been seen as a good
opportunity for religious-political the-
ater, in order to generate publicity, deliver
patronage, and give the people in these
organizations greater status and visibility.

Sita
(“furrow”) Daughter of King Janaka,
wife of the god-prince Rama (himself
the seventh avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu), and the major female
character in the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two great Sanskrit epics. Unlike
many other Hindu goddesses, Sita’s
identity stems almost completely from
her husband, and she has little indepen-
dent worship or personality of her own.
Her abduction by the demon-king
Ravana is the single major event driving
the plot of the Ramayana, prompting
her husband and his allies first to search
the earth for her and then to fight a cli-
mactic battle to regain her, concluding
with Ravana’s death. Throughout all the
tumult Sita simply waits to be rescued,
sure that this will provide her husband
with greater glory.
According to her charter myth, Sita is
not born in the normal way but is found
in a furrow by King Janaka as he plows
his field. Sita thus carries a strong asso-
ciation with the earth, fertility, and pros-
perity; as David Kinsley points out, her
marriage to Rama symbolizes the union
between the fecund earth and a right-
eous king that will make it prosper. Her
connection with the earth is also seen in
her disappearance, when in response to
Rama’s accusations of unfaithfulness,
she calls on the earth to swallow her up
as a witness to her chastity, and disap-
pears forever.
Sita’s primary virtue is her devotion
to her husband, and in her unflagging
love for him she is a model Hindu wife,
just as many of the Ramayana’s other
characters incarnate cultural ideals. An
early sign of her devotion is shown
when Rama has been wrongly exiled in
the forest for fourteen years. Even
though Sita has never known anything
but luxury and ease, she is determined
to accompany him into exile, based on
the conviction that a faithful wife
should always accompany her hus-
band. Rama objects, reasons, and even
forbids her, but Sita does not give in—
perhaps the only time that she does
not observe her husband’s wishes. She
goes to the forest with Rama and her
brother-in-law Lakshmana, cheerfully
taking on the difficult life of an ascetic,
since this means she can remain with
her husband.
The more difficult test of her devo-
tion to her husband comes when she is
abducted and held captive by Ravana.
She holds steadfast despite Ravana’s
unceasing persuasion, threats, and
attempts to convince her that Rama has
been killed. According to one story, the
only part of Ravana that she ever sees is
his feet, since as a devoted wife she kept
[[653]]
Sitamarhi
her eyes modestly downcast rather than
look directly at another man. When
Rama’s ally Hanuman discovers where
Sita is hidden, she refuses to let him
carry her away, since this will have
meant touching another man, as well as
depriving her husband of the opportu-
nity to rescue her.
Her devotion is severely tested after
her rescue, when Rama insists that she
must have been unfaithful to him dur-
ing her long captivity. This accusation
reflects the Indian cultural assumption
that women have much higher sex dri-
ves than men, and much less ability to
control these drives. Stung by this accu-
sation, she asks Rama to have a funeral
pyre built for her and enters it with the
wish that, if she is innocent, the fire will
not harm her. When the blaze dies down
she emerges unscathed, with the god
Agni (fire personified) as a witness to
her chastity. Despite this proof, Rama
banishes her from Ayodhya after their
return. When Rama later demands a
second ordeal, Sita calls on the earth
to swallow her up as a witness to her
purity, and disappears forever.
Sita’s ability to withstand both
ordeals reflects the widespread Indian
belief that women gain power through
their devotion to their husbands, power
that can be so great that they can even
curse the gods themselves. Encoded in
this notion are cultural messages about
the role of women and the importance
of their relationships with others. Sita
represents the model Indian woman,
whose primary loyalty is to her husband
and his family. This reflects the northern
Indian marriage pattern in which brides
are brought into the groom’s home and
become part of their marital families,
severing their connection with their
birth family. Wives are expected to place
other people’s welfare before their own,
so that they may live a happily married
life. In return for such self-sacrifice, a
wife becomes a model for all to respect
and honor.

Sitamarhi
City in the northern part of the state of
Bihar, about ten miles from the border
with Nepal. It is in the Panchala region
traditionally reckoned as the kingdom of
King Janaka, and Sitamarhi is believed
to be the place where the goddess Sita
was found in a furrow of the earth while
King Janaka was plowing.
Six Schools
Collective name for the six developed
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. All six schools consider the reli-
gious texts known as the Vedas to be the
most authoritative pramana, the means
by which human beings can gain true
and accurate knowledge. All six schools
also assume that philosophical reflec-
tion must ultimately serve religious
goals, to release the embodied soul
(atman) from an otherwise unending
cycle of transmigration. Aside from
these basic similarities, each of these
schools developed distinctive and char-
acteristic perspectives. Despite their dif-
ferences, by the early centuries of the
common era the schools had become
associated in pairs: Nyaya-Vaisheshika,
Samkhya-Yoga, and Purva Mimamsa-
Uttara Mimamsa, with the final school
more commonly known as Vedanta.
Of these, the Nyaya school focused
on examining and cataloguing the pra-
manas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge, and their conclusions
became accepted by all six schools. The
Vaisheshika school was a descriptive
ontology that categorized the world in
atomistic fashion, in which all things
were considered to be constructed from
smaller parts. This school had inherent
philosophical problems that con-
tributed to its eclipse. Samkhya is an
atheistic dualism based on the distinc-
tion between a conscious but inertSkanda
end of the millennium Vedanta had
become the most significant philosoph-
ical perspective, largely eclipsing the
others, although it had absorbed certain
influences from them. For further infor-
mation see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

book in Indian Philosophy, 1957.

purusha (“person,” or spirit), and an
unconscious but active prakrti
(“nature”). According to the Samkhya
proponents, failure to discriminate
between the two leads to the evolution
of the world and the individual person,
whereas correct understanding reverses
this process. Samkhya provides the the-
oretical basis for the Yoga school, which
essentially details techniques to help
one gain the correct understanding
between these two entities. Purva
Mimamsa stresses the study of the Vedas
as the source of instruction for human
beings, an emphasis that led it to
develop sophisticated theories of lan-
guage and methods for textual interpre-
tation. These tools were used by the
Vedanta school in its efforts to reveal the
ultimate meaning of the Vedas. Most of
the first millennium during the com-
mon era was a time of lively debate
among these schools, each of which
held varying positions on basic things
such as the reality of the world. By the
Hindu deity who is the son of the god
Shiva. Skanda is born to destroy the
demon Taraka, who has received the
divine boon that he can only be killed by
a son of Shiva. When Taraka makes this
request, Shiva is deep in meditation in
his grief after the death of his wife Sati,
and it seems unlikely that such a son can
ever be born. After Taraka grows too
strong, the other gods begin the process
of trying to encourage Shiva to marry,
which results in his wedding with the
goddess Parvati.
Despite the marriage of Shiva and
Parvati, Skanda is born in an unusual
way. According to the legend, Shiva and
Parvati are disturbed while making love,
and Shiva inadvertently spills his semen
on the ground (the verb skand means
“to leap” or “to ooze”). In Indian culture
semen is seen as a man’s concentrated
essence, and for a deity like Shiva this
means that the semen is inordinately
powerful, capable of destroying the
earth. The semen is first held by the god
Agni, who is fire personified, but it
proves too powerful for him. Agni then
puts it in the River Ganges, and after
[[10]]
,000 years the river deposits a shining
child in the reeds by its bank. The child
is discovered by the Krittikas (the
Pleiades personified), each of whom
want to nurse him. To oblige them
Skanda grows five extra heads. As a
mark of the Krittikas’ care, one of his
epithets is Kartikkeya. Skanda grows
rapidly, assumes command of Shiva’s
heavenly host (gana), and kills the
troublesome Taraka. His persona
remains that of a warrior prince, unlike
that of his brother Ganesh, who is a
scholar and sage.
[[655]]
Smallpox
In northern India Skanda is consid-
ered a member of Shiva’s household,
and although his power is acknowl-
edged, he is generally not a primary
object of worship. In southern India
Skanda has been identified with
Murugan, a regional deity associated
primarily with the hunt, but also with
war. In this atmosphere he has taken on
a much greater role, particularly in
Tamil Nadu, and has assumed the man-
tle of a philosopher and exponent of the
Shaiva Siddhanta school.
Smallpox
In traditional Hindu belief, smallpox
was personified as the goddess Shitala
(“Cool One,” a euphemism), and the
fever and skin eruptions accompanying
the disease were interpreted as signs of
possession by this goddess. In the time
since the World Health Organization has
declared smallpox officially eradicated,
in some regions Shitala has been identi-
fied with tuberculosis. See Shitala.
Smara
(“memory”) Epithet of the god Kama,
the deification of desire, reflecting the
importance of memory in generating
and maintaining desire. See Kama.
Smarana
(“remembering”) One of the standard
religious practices mentioned in lists
of religiously meritorious actions.
Smarana is most often associated with
deities but is also mentioned in con-
junction with sacred sites (tirthas), one’s
spiritual teacher (guru), or even particu-
lar acts of worship. This practice
involves thinking constantly upon the
deity, person, place, or object, and in the
case of a deity this often involves mental
recitation of the deity’s name. The pri-
mary emphasis in this practice is to cre-
ate habitual behavioral patterns that,
over the long term, will have beneficial
effects on one’s character.
[[656]]

Smarta
Name for a particular group of brahmins
distinguished not by region or family,
but by the religious texts that they hold
most authoritative. For the Smartas, the
most authoritative texts are the texts
known as the smrtis—either the texts
themselves or commentaries and com-
pilations based on them. The smrtis or
“remembered” texts were a class of liter-
ature that, although deemed important,
were considered less authoritative than
the shrutis or “heard” texts. In brief, the
shrutis denoted the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts, whereas the smrtis included the
dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
the Mahabharata, and Ramayana, and
the collection known as the puranas.
The Smartas thus stand in contrast with
sectarian brahmins, whether Shaiva
(devotees of Shiva) or Vaishnava (devo-
tees of Vishnu), for whom their particu-
lar sectarian scriptures have the highest
religious authority. Smarta brahmins
can therefore claim to be following the
oldest and best established religious
texts and thus in some way to be the
most orthodox. Since Smartas are dis-
tinguished by their authoritative texts
and practice rather than by the deity
they worship, individual Smartas may
worship different Hindu deities, and
many do. Yet particularly in southern
India, many Smartas perform the pan-
chayatana puja to the five divine
forms—Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Ganesh,
and the Goddess—which is intended to
show the ultimate unity behind the dif-
fering manifestations of divinity.
Smrti
(“[that which is] remembered”) An
important class of Hindu religious liter-
ature that, despite its sacrality, is
deemed less authoritative than the
other major category, shruti. According
to tradition, the shruti (“heard”) texts
were not composed by human beings
but are based in the primordial vibra-
tions of the cosmos itself. The ancient
sages, whose faculties of perception hadSnana

purity by bathing.
been sharpened through rigorous reli-
gious practice, were able to “hear” and
understand these vibrations, and trans-
mitted them to others in a lineage of
learning. The smrti texts, in contrast, are
attributed to human authors, who are
putting forth matters that are “remem-
bered” and thus carry with them the
possibility of error. The smrti literature
is wider and much more varied than the
shruti, which is restricted to the texts in
the Vedas; smrti literature includes the
dharma literature, the sectarian compi-
lations known as puranas, the two great
epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana),
the Bhagavad Gita, and the tantras,
which are manuals detailing the secret,
ritually based religious practice of tantra
followers. Although theoretically the
smrtis have less religious authority than
the shrutis, in practical terms they are
often far more important, in part
because their contents are much better
known. This is particularly true for sec-
tarian Hinduism, in which a group’s sec-
tarian literature will often be given the
highest religious authority.
Snana
(“bath”) Bathing is arguably the single
most commonly performed Hindu reli-
gious act, and it is a necessary one
before performing any rite or worship.
An early morning bath is the norm for
just about all Hindus, and this has been
true for centuries. The earliest European
visitors invariably remarked on this
practice, since some of these visitors
bathed only a few times in their lives.
For Hindus, bathing not only keeps one
clean but is a way to regain ritual purity
by using water (most commonly) to
remove any source of defilement.
[[657]]
Snataka
Bathing is normally the last part of one’s
morning rites, preceded by cleaning
one’s teeth and tongue, rinsing the
mouth (achamana), and (immediately
before bathing) voiding one’s bladder
and bowels. These latter acts are a nec-
essary part of life, but they also render
one ritually impure, a state that the bath
removes. People generally perform any
daily worship immediately after
bathing, while this ritual purity is
still unbroken.
Most people bathe only in the morn-
ing, although those scrupulously con-
cerned with purity (generally brahmins
or ascetics) will bathe more often. The
bath itself is usually quite brief and
some in cases consists of simply
immersing oneself in a natural body of
water, or pouring a bucket of water over
one’s head. In modern times people
often use soap, but the traditionally pre-
scribed cleansing medium is earth. It is
preferable to bathe in running water,
since the bath purifies by removing the
impurity (ashaucha) and carrying it
away and although bathing in a large
pond is seen as acceptable, bathing in a
bathtub is seen as simply spreading the
impurity around rather than getting rid
of it. Although the most common medium
for bathing is water, when this is impos-
sible one can ritually cleanse oneself
with oil, or one can perform ritual
cleansing with mantras by using sacred
sounds to remove defilement and bring
one to a state of ritual purity.
In the context of worship, snana is
the sixth of the sixteen traditional
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a deity
as part of worship, on the model of treat-
ing the deity as an honored guest. In this
offering, the deity is bathed, either liter-
ally or symbolically. The underlying
motive here, as for all the upacharas, is
to show one’s love for the deity and min-
ister to the deity’s needs.
Snataka
(“[one who has] bathed”) In the dharma
literature, this is the name for a
young man who had performed the
[[658]]

samavartana samskara, the life-cycle
ceremony that marks the end of
his stage of life as a celibate student
(brahmacharin) and return to his
parental home. The most important ele-
ment in the rite was a bath, after which
he changed into new clothes, marking
his change in status. Before doing this
he was supposed to ask his guru’s per-
mission, and also to give him his
teacher’s fee (dakshina), both as pay-
ment for services rendered and as a sign
of respect. A young man who had per-
formed this rite would be eligible to get
married, and the literature prescribes
that this should follow in short order.
Solah Somvar Vrat
A religious vow (vrat) that is a variant of
the worship of the god Shiva prescribed
for every Monday (Somvar), the day of
the week over which he is believed to
preside. In the Solah Somvar Vrat, the
observer vows to do perform this rite for
sixteen (solah) consecutive Mondays.
Each week’s observance is marked by
fasting (upavasa), worship, and reading
aloud the charter myth for this particu-
lar observance. As with most literature
pertaining to such rites, the text ends
with a catalog of the benefits brought by
the rite—in essence, it gives whatever
one desires.
According to the vow’s charter myth,
as Shiva and his wife Parvati are playing
dice in a temple, Parvati asks a nearby
brahmin which of them will win, and
when he replies that it will be Shiva, she
angrily curses him to be afflicted with lep-
rosy. The curse comes true (as with all
curses in Indian mythology) and the
brahmin is in a terrible state. Shiva takes
pity on the brahmin, tells him to perform
the Solah Somvar Vrat, and on the six-
teenth Monday, the brahmin is completely
cured. Some time later Parvati sees him
and is amazed at his recovery. When she
asks how he has been cured, the brahmin
tells her about the vow, which she later
uses to cure her son of disobedience (thus
emphasizing the power of the vow, since
it is even used by the gods themselves).Someshvara 1
Solar Line
In Hindu mythology, one of the two
great lineages, the other being the Lunar
Line. The Solar Line traces its descent
from Ikshvaku, the grandson of the Sun
himself. Its descendants include many
of the principal characters in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics. One of these descendants
is Rama himself. In many of the small
former princely states in Rajasthan, the
rulers claimed descent from the Solar
Line as a way to establish and support
their royal authority. Although they no
longer wield ruling power, many of these
royal houses still exist, and thus this lin-
eage is believed to be still extant.
Soma
Soma is one of the most enigmatic
deities in the Hindu tradition. The 120
hymns to soma in the Rg Veda, the old-
est Hindu sacred text, variously describe
soma as a plant, as the juice pressed
from that plant, and as the deified form
of both juice and plant. The Vedic
hymns give detailed descriptions of how
the sacrificial priests pressed it, strained
and filtered it, and finally consumed it,
which then brought visions upon them.
These hymns portray soma as some sort
of mind-altering substance, although
there is no general agreement on what
the soma plant might be. Its identity has
been lost since late Vedic times, and
since then various substitutes have been
used in rituals.
Although the hymns describe soma
as hallucinogenic, one need not take
this literally. One can explain such
visions in purely psychological terms, as
induced or fostered by the priests’
heightened expectations in the sacrifi-
cial arena. If one assumes that soma was
actually mind-altering, it could not have
been an alcoholic beverage—since it
was prepared and consumed on the
same day, this would have given no time
for fermentation. One theory is that
soma was hashish (charas), which is still
consumed in certain ritual contexts. The
most
intriguing
theory
was
proposed by R. G. Wasson, who
contended that soma was Amonita mus-
caria, a mind-altering mushroom that
has a long history of use in Asian
shamanic traditions. Although Wasson’s
theory would explain soma’s ability to
take immediate effect, many Indologists
have taken issue with this claim. See
Robert Gordon Wasson, Soma, 1971; for
contrary remarks, see J. Brough, “Soma
and Amonita Muscaria,” in The Bulletin
of the School of Oriental and African
Studies, Vol. 34, 1971.
Somavati Amavasya
Religious observance celebrated when a
new moon (amavasya) falls on a
Monday, which can thus occur in any
month in the year. On the new moon
day the sun and moon travel together
during the daylight sky, and when this
happens on the Monday, whose presid-
ing planet is the moon, this confluence
is deemed particularly favorable.
Another auspicious connection arises
because Monday’s presiding deity, the
god Shiva, also has mythic connections
with the moon. A Somavati Amavasya is
thus judged a particularly beneficial
time to worship Shiva, as well as to
bathe (snana) in a sacred river such as
the Ganges, or to perform any other reli-
gious act.
Someshvara I
(r. 1042–1068) Monarch in the Chalukya
dynasty. Aside from his long reign, he is
most noted for performing religious sui-
cide by intentionally drowning himself
in the Tungabhadra River when his
mental faculties began to wane.
Although in general suicide was strongly
condemned, suicide by a person suffer-
ing from a terminal disease or enduring
chronic pain was a well-attested excep-
tion to this rule. This sort of suicide was
performed according to a well-defined
ritual, which was intended to put the
performer in the proper frame of mind.
In about the twelfth century this was
declared one of the rites “forbidden in
[[659]]
Somnath

the Kali [Age]” (Kalivarjya), although it
had been permitted in earlier times.
Somnath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
state of Gujarat. The temple is named
for its presiding deity—the god Shiva in
his manifestation as the “Lord of the
Moon.” Shiva is present at Somnath in
the form of a linga, the pillar-shaped
image that is his symbolic form, and the
Somnath linga is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites deemed
especially sacred to Shiva, and at which
he is uniquely present. According to the
site’s charter myth, the moon is married
to all of the twenty-seven nakshatras, or
signs in the lunar zodiac, but he loves
Rohini nakshatra so much that he stays
with her all the time, and neglects his
other twenty-six wives. His father-in-law
Daksha protests to the moon, but when
he refuses to give them equal time,
Daksha lays a curse on him that he will
lose all his light. The moon overcomes
this curse by worshiping Shiva at
Somnath for six continuous months and
is given the boon that he will only shrink
during half the lunar month, and that
[[660]]

during the other half he will grow. As
a sign of this gift, Shiva takes
residence there as Somnath, and
remains to this day.
Aside from its importance as a sacred
site, the Somnath temple is a potent
political symbol. The original temple
was razed and pillaged by Mahmud of
Ghazni in 1024, who reportedly carried
off astounding booty. The present tem-
ple at Somnath was built after Indian
independence in 1947 and consecrated
in 1951. As a symbol, Somnath is thus
associated with past oppression and
depredation, and with the revitalization
of Hindu culture in India. For this rea-
son, the Somnath temple is a popular
image for proponents of Hindutva, an
idea that identifies Hindu identity and
Indian citizenship.
Sonar
In traditional northern Indian society, a
Hindu jati whose hereditary occupation
was gold smithing and jewelry making.
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organizedSons
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group held a monopoly.
Song of Manik Chandra
Traditional Bengali song describing the
adventures of the mythical king Manik
Chandra, his wife Mayana, and their son
Gopi Chand; the latter figures are the
primary characters, since Manik
Chandra dies early in the story. The text
is a romance but also contains many of
the doctrines associated with the
Nathpanthi ascetics. In particular,
Queen Mayana has power over Yama
(death personified), which was one of
the primary aims of the Nathpanthi
ascetics. Furthermore, she acquired this
power through the spiritual instruction
given by her guru Gorakhnath, the
Nathpanthi founder.
Her power over death is shown in
various ways. When her husband dies,
Mayana descends to Yama’s realm and
physically abuses both Yama and his
minions. In his flight Yama changes into
various forms to escape Mayana’s wrath,
but she is never deceived and continues
to harass him. On other occasions, she
shows her power over death by her
inability to be killed. She mounts her
husband’s funeral pyre, and although
the fire burns for seven days and nine
nights, not even her clothing is
scorched. Many years later, Mayana sur-
vives seven fearsome ordeals, such
as boiling in oil. When asked how
she acquired these magical arts, she
replies that Gorakhnath himself taught
her. The appearance of such ideas in
an essentially popular tale shows how
deeply these ideas had sunk into the
popular mind.
Sons
It is difficult to overstate the importance
traditional Hindu culture has placed on
the need for sons, and the cultural bias
for sons over daughters. Religious
motives underlie one important reason
for this bias, since only sons are entitled
to perform the memorial offerings for
the dead known as shraddhas. The men
in each generation are responsible for
making these offerings to their ances-
tors. They are in turn obliged to have
sons of their own, so that the family lin-
eage and the chain of ancestral offerings
remains unbroken through the genera-
tions. Sonless couples are not completely
out of luck, since sons can be obtained
through adoption.
The other major reason behind the
preference for sons lies in far more prag-
matic motives. According to the tradi-
tional Indian marriage pattern, daugh-
ters move into their marital homes and
become members of their marital fami-
lies, whereas sons bring their brides into
the home and through their own fami-
lies continue the family line. Thus, par-
ents sometimes see their daughters as
“temporary” family members, while
their sons are “permanent.” The sons
will dwell in their natal house their
entire lives, support their parents in
old age, and produce the family’s
future generations. These traditional
practices and beliefs still hold very
strong, although the forces of modernity
have affected the joint family. It has
become more common for husbands
and wives to live separately from the
husband’s parents.
The religious, economic, and social
factors behind this preference for sons
have sometimes had terrible conse-
quences. Consciously or unconsciously,
sons may be favored over daughters in
many significant ways. Sons are often
given better access to education and
economic opportunities, because men
are traditionally required to support
their families. A similar presumption lies
behind the inequities in traditional
Hindu inheritance laws, which give
the sons a much larger share of the
inheritance. In poorer families, sons
may even get preference for basic needs
such as food and access to medical care.
Despite these patterns, in contemporary
times many families treat all their
children with equal love and care. Given
the trend toward smaller families, the
[[661]]
Sopashraya
birth of a daughter can be cause for as
much rejoicing as that of a son.
Sopashraya
(“using a support”) One of the sitting
postures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,
the foundational text for the practice of
yoga. The name of this posture derives
from a wooden support used by the
sitter to keep erect, often portrayed as
a crutch-shaped prop under the chin.
Soratha
Metrical form in northern Indian devo-
tional (bhakti) poetry, made up of two
lines of twenty-four metric beats, divided
unevenly after the eleventh beat. The
metric pattern for the first line is 6+4+1,
with the pattern for the second line
being 6+4+3. The soratha is thus an
inversion of the metrical form doha.
Although the soratha was a common
poetic form, the doha was far more pop-
ular and widely used.
South Africa
One of the countries with significant
Hindu diaspora populations. This is
particularly true in Natal province,
where Hindus were first brought as
indentured agricultural laborers, but
there is a significant Hindu presence in
other parts of the country as well. South
Africa is best known as the place where
Mohandas K. Gandhi first developed
and refined his program of nonviolent
resistance, or satyagraha, which he
employed in the service of the Indian
community there. In contemporary
times the South African Hindu commu-
nity, as with many Hindu diaspora com-
munities, has loosened religious ties to
India, and is in the process of forming a
Hindu religious life in another geo-
graphical setting.
Space
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
[[662]]

earth, fire, water, and wind. Akasha or
“space” is not conceived in the sense of
“outer space,” but rather the space
between or within visible objects on
earth. For example, an “empty” pitcher
was not actually empty, but was filled
with space, until it was displaced by
some fluid. This elemental sense of
space was thus something closer to what
might be considered the “atmosphere,”
and was actually seen as having fluidlike
properties. In some philosophical
schools, each of the elements is paired
with one of the five senses; here akasha
is associated with hearing, since it
is believed to convey the sound from
place to place.
Sphota
(“disclosure”) Crucial element in the
theory of language propounded by
Bhartrhari (7th c.). Bhartrhari was the
founder of the Grammarians, a philo-
sophical school that conceived of
Brahman, the Supreme Reality, as being
manifested in sound, particularly the
sound of the spoken word. According to
this theory, a verbal utterance had three
elements: the sound or sounds pro-
duced by the speaker and heard by the
listener; a phonological pattern, of
which that utterance is an instance; and
finally the sphota, which was expressed
by the sounds and signified the object of
that utterance. According to Bhartrhari,
sphota had to be postulated to explain
how words could carry meaning. They
do so because they are connected to the
sphota, which designated a particular
object, and in producing the sounds the
speaker expressed that sphota.
Sri Lanka
Island nation off the southeastern coast
of India, formerly known as Ceylon.
Local tradition claims that Sri Lanka was
the place at which the biblical Adam
alighted from paradise. Yet despite the
island’s idyllic natural beauty, its human
geography has been far more troubled.
Since 1981 the nation has been in theStages of Life
throes of civil war between the Sinhalese
and the Tamils, the island’s two major
ethnic groups. The Sinhalese comprise
about 70 percent of the population, are
largely Buddhist, live mainly in south-
ern, western, and central Sri Lanka, and
consider themselves the island’s tradi-
tional inhabitants. The Tamils comprise
little more than 20 percent of the popu-
lation, are both Hindu and Christian,
and are concentrated in the north and
east. The Tamils came to Sri Lanka in
two different ways—about half are
descended from medieval invaders, who
established Tamil kingdoms in northern
Sri Lanka after crossing the straits from
southern India, others were brought to
Sri Lanka in the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, to serve as laborers
on tea plantations.
Since independence in 1948, the
Tamils have been at a distinct disadvan-
tage vis-à-vis the Sinhalese, whose
majority has allowed them to control
virtually all aspects of national life. This
precarious position was often further
undermined by anti-Tamil riots, partic-
ularly in Colombo, the nation’s capital.
In 1981 Tamil groups began a struggle
for an independent nation in the Tamil-
majority areas. The Sinhalese majority
was deathly opposed to this notion, and
since then Sri Lanka has been marked by
periods of vicious civil war. Given their
slimmer resources, the Tamils have
tended to wage guerrilla warfare. Their
soldiers are famous for wearing a
cyanide capsule around their necks with
which to commit suicide if captured.
These soldiers are also notorious for
their willingness to serve as human
bombs, striking against civilian popula-
tions in urban areas. In 1991 one such
human bomb was responsible for the
assassination of former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi in revenge for
Gandhi’s perceived treachery in cooper-
ating with the Sri Lankan government.
Although the Tamil regions have been
offered limited autonomy by Chandrika
Kumaratunga, Sri Lanka’s present prime
minister, the conflict has been so bitter
that it is not likely to be easily resolved.
Sri Lanka has traditionally been part
of the Indian cultural orbit and has a
long history of cultural exchanges with
India. According to local tradition,
Buddhism was brought to Sri Lanka
from India in the third century B.C.E. by
Mahinda, who was the son of the
Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Another sign
of this connection is that Sri Lanka con-
tains an important Hindu pilgrimage
place (tirtha), Kataragama, located
near the island’s southern coast.
Kataragama’s perceived power draws
Hindus from abroad as well as Sri
Lankans from all religious communities.
Although Kataragama is Sri Lanka’s
only major Hindu site, the northern
regions strongly reflect the Tamil culture
of the region’s population, which stems
from their geographic roots. See also
Tamil Nadu.
Stages of Life
As described in the dharma literature,
there were four stages (ashramas) in the
life of a twice-born man, that is, a man
born into one of the three “twice-born”
groups in Indian society—brahmin,
kshatriya, or vaishya—who are eligible
for the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” In the first
stage, immediately after this initiation,
the young man would live as a celibate
student (brahmacharin) studying the
Vedas in his guru’s household. The sec-
ond stage was that of the householder
(grhastha), in which he would marry,
raise a family, and engage in worldly life.
In the third stage, as a forest-dwelling
hermit (vanaprastha), he would gradu-
ally detach himself from worldly entan-
glements. The final stage was as a total
renunciant (Sanyasi), who had given up
all things in a search for the ultimate
religious truth. These four stages are an
idealized progression and should not be
understood as describing actual prac-
tice, since most men never pass beyond
the householder stage of life and have
no desire to do so.
Beneath this idealized progression
lies the tension between two differing
[[663]]
Steya
modes of religious life—that of the
householder, which is based in the
world, and that of the ascetic, which
renounces the world. The latter ideal
originated with the religious adepts
known as the shramanas and evolved
into the monastic asceticism of the
Buddhists and Jains, which was por-
trayed as a superior religious path than
the householder’s life. Both these groups
were highly influential—the Jains had a
significant presence in southern Indian
society up to the eighth century C.E.—
and it is generally accepted that the pat-
tern of the four ashramas was evolved as
a way to appropriate and transform this
stress on ascetic life. The doctrine of the
four stages provided a place and time for
asceticism, but as the last stage, at the
end of one’s life. The clear message was
that one should engage in the search for
religious truth only after fulfilling one’s
social and ancestral duties.
Steya
(“theft”) In the dharma literature, one
of the Four Great Crimes whose com-
mission made one an outcast from soci-
ety; steya was theft of a brahmin’s gold,
above a certain specified amount. One
guilty of this crime was to go to the king
bearing an iron club and receive a blow
to the head intended to be fatal. This
blow would absolve the sin, whether or
not one actually died, although one
was also expected to restore the stolen
property. For lesser amounts of gold the
punishment was less severe and satis-
fied by fasting (upavasa) and other
penance (prayashchitta). The stress on
the seriousness of this sin clearly reflects
the interests of the brahmins, who
undoubtedly wrote most of the
dharma literature.
Sthala Murti
(“fixed image”) Image of a deity that is
fixed in a certain place and does not
move from it (in the case of stone
images, this is often because such
images are so large and heavy that
[[664]]

moving them is virtually impossible).
The other sort of image is the utsava
murti, a movable image used during
festival processions.
Sthunakarna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Sthunakarna is a
nature spirit (yaksha) who exchanges
sexes with Shikhandi, the rebirth of
the maiden Amba, daughter of the
king of Kashi.
Stridhan
(“woman’s wealth”) Term denoting any
property owned or inherited by a
woman, which usually included any
gifts given to her by her family or money
that she earned herself. In the patrilineal
inheritance systems prescribed by texts
such as the Mitakshara and the
Dayabhaga, stridhan was not consid-
ered part of the family property, but a
woman’s personal property that she
could dispose of as she pleased.
Stridhan could be inherited, but the
inheritance patterns were different than
those for family property. The primary
inheritors were a woman’s daughters;
for women with no daughters, the own-
ership would devolve to her husband
and his heirs, or to her birth family.
Stridharma
Term denoting “women’s religious duty”
(dharma), the set of social roles, rules,
and duties broadly conceived as apply-
ing to all women. In the dharma litera-
ture, it was generally assumed that
appropriate women’s roles were as
daughters, wives, and mothers, and that
their lives would be primarily defined by
their relationships with men—whether
fathers, brothers, husbands, or sons. As
described in the dharma literature, their
position seems to have had status, but
little authority. One well-known passage
from the Manu Smrti warns that a
woman must never be independent, but
always under the guardianship of a man;
this is followed by an equally famousSubtle Body
passage warning that the treatment of
women was a marker of the family’s
honor, and that a household in which
the women were badly treated would
disappear. In real life women exercised
considerably more power than in this
theoretical model, but such power usu-
ally came later in life, when a woman’s
sons had formed families of their own,
and she had thus become the matriarch
of an extended family.
Subhadra
The divine sister of the god Jagannath,
who is invariably pictured with him and
their brother Balabhadra. The most
important site for these three deities is
the Jagannath temple in the city of Puri,
at which Jagannath is the presiding
deity. Although Jagannath is identified
with the god Krishna, he is generally
considered an autochthonous (“of the
land”) deity who was originally the local
deity of Puri. He has been assimilated
into the Hindu pantheon by his identifi-
cation with Krishna.
One piece of evidence for this theory
is the deities’ invariable appearance,
with Jagannath (Krishna) on the right,
his brother Balabhadra (Balarama) on
the left, and Subhadra as a smaller figure
in the center. Such a triadic grouping
is virtually unknown in Krishna devo-
tion, which tends to stress either
Krishna alone or the divine couple
of Krishna and Radha. The female figure
of Subhadra is also very unusual, since
as Jagannath’s sister she is ineligible
for the amorous adventures usually
associated with Krishna. Although
Jagannath is the most important of
the three deities, the identifications with
the other two also reveal larger
syncretizing tendencies. Balabhadra is
sometimes identified as a form of
the god Shiva, and Subhadra as the
powerful goddess Durga. In this way,
Puri’s divine trio embody the three
most important Hindu deities. For
further information on Subhadra and
her brothers, the best source is
Anncharlott Eschmann, Hermann
Kulke, and Gaya Charan Tripathi, The
Cult of Jagannath and the Regional
Traditions of Orissa, 1978.
Subodhini
(“Greatly enlightening”) A name given to
commentaries on various texts—pre-
sumably because of the commentary’s
ability to illuminate the text. The most
famous of these commentaries, to
which the name Subodhini is often
understood to refer, is the one by
Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) on the
Bhagavata Purana. The Bhagavata
Purana is one of the later sectarian
compendia known as puranas, and it is
the most important source for the
mythology of the god Krishna, whom
Vallabhacharya considered the Supreme
Being. Vallabhacharya’s Subodhini lays
out the basic doctrines of his religious
community, known as the Pushti Marg
because of their stress on god’s grace,
which they called pushti, meaning “that
which nourishes the soul.”
Subrahmanya
(“dear to brahmins”) Epithet of the god
Skanda, particularly in his southern
Indian manifestation as Murugan. See
Skanda and Murugan.
Subtle Body
Alternate human physiological system
that exists on a different plane than
gross matter, but has certain correspon-
dences with the anatomy of the material
body. Different parts of the subtle body
contain the microcosmic forms of the
deities Shiva and Shakti, the bipolar
forces believed to be the powers behind
the cosmos. The subtle body is thus
based on the principle of the homology,
or essential similarities, of macrocosm
and microcosm, a fundamental Hindu
idea since the time of the Upanishads.
The Sanskrit texts describing the subtle
body assume that there are different
planes of reality, and thus that the subtle
body actually exists, but given the net-
work of symbols associated with it, one
[[665]]
Subtle Body
Vishnu, surrounded by worshipers, wielding Sudarshana, his discus weapon.
need not accept its literal reality for it to
be religiously meaningful.
The subtle body is visualized as a set
of six psychic centers (chakras), running
roughly along the course of the spine:
the muladhara chakra at the base of the
spine, the svadhishthana chakra in the
genital region, the manipura chakra in
the navel region, the anahata chakra in
[[666]]

the heart region, the vishuddha chakra
in the throat region, and the ajna chakra
is in the forehead between the eyebrows.
Associated with each of these chakras is
an elaborate symbolic system: All six can
be seen as symbols for a human physio-
logical capacity; the first five are associ-
ated with one of the subtle elements
(tanmatras), and the sixth with thought.Sudarshana
The lotus petals on each chakra contain
a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sounds. Some
models of the subtle body are even
more developed, with each chakra
associated with a certain color and a
certain presiding deity.
These centers are capped at the top
of the head by the “thousand-petaled
lotus” (sahasradalapadma), which is
the abode of Shiva in the human body.
Connecting all of the centers are three
vertical channels (nadi)—the ida nadi
on the left, the pingala nadi on the
right, and the sushumna in the center.
Coiled three times around the mulad-
hara chakra is the kundalini, the latent
spiritual force in all human beings.
This is considered an aspect of the uni-
versal Shakti, or feminine divine
power, but in most people is regarded
as dormant, symbolized by its coiled
state. The separation of Shakti and
Shiva at the opposite ends of the subtle
body also symbolizes the ordinary per-
son’s unenlightened state, since enlight-
enment transcends this duality, and the
two deities are united and identical.
The subtle body is a fundamental
aspect of tantra practices and some
forms of yoga. In the types of yoga that
focus on the subtle body, including
kundalini yoga, the ultimate aim is to
awaken and straighten the kundalini,
moving it up the sushumna through
the chakras to the abode of Shiva.
Since the kundalini is nothing but raw
energy, the process must be carefully
controlled to prevent the aspirant from
unleashing uncontrollable forces, and
manuals warn against doing this with-
out being under the supervision of a
spiritual teacher (guru). The union of
Shiva and Shakti in the aspirant’s body
mirrors the action of these divine
forces in the macrocosm, and with this
union the aspirant gains bliss and final
liberation of the soul (moksha). For fur-
ther information see Arthur Avalon (Sir
John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1959]]
; Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Suchi Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the hand is closed except for
the index finger, which is pointing
downward to indicate something to the
viewer. The word suchi means “needle”
but is derived from a verb that can mean
either “to pierce” or “to indicate”—both
meanings that imply focusing on a
particular place.
Sudama
In Hindu mythology, one of the god
Krishna’s childhood friends who is a
symbol for god’s grace and providence.
In later life Sudama is desperately poor
and, at his wife’s urging, goes to beg for
help from his childhood friend, who is
now the king of Dwaraka. Sudama is so
poor that the only gift he can bring for
Krishna is a small packet of parched
rice, but Krishna greets him and gra-
ciously accepts it. The two have an
enjoyable visit in which they reminisce
about old times, and Sudama goes home
without asking for anything. Some of the
stories explain this lapse as stemming
from shame, but in others Sudama is
portrayed as having had such a nice
time that he simply forgets. During his
homeward journey Sudama worries
over the reception he will get from his
wife, but when he arrives he discovers
that his hut has been transformed into a
palace by Krishna’s divine power, and
from that day he is never poor again.
Sudarshana
In Hindu mythology, the name for the
god Vishnu’s discus weapon (chakra),
which is fashioned by Vishvakarma, the
workman and architect of the gods.
According to the story, Vishvakarma has
married his daughter Sanjna to the sun,
but she finds her husband’s brightness
too much to bear. To help his daughter
adjust, Vishvakarma trims off some bits
[[667]]
Sudarshana Sampraday
of the sun with his divine tools, remov-
ing enough of his radiance that Sanjna
can bear to be with him. He then fash-
ions the trimmed-off portions into
Vishnu’s Sudarshana chakra, Shiva’s tri-
dent, and various other divine weapons,
as well as the Pushpak Viman, an aerial
car. Sudarshana’s divine source makes it
a fearful weapon, and it is thus able to
decimate any enemy.
Sudarshana Sampraday
Another name for the Nimbarki reli-
gious community, since their founder
Nimbarka was believed to be an incar-
nation of Sudarshana, Vishnu’s weapon.
Sugriva
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, a monkey king
and an ally of the god Rama in his
struggle to regain his kidnapped wife
Sita. Sugriva and his brother Bali
jointly rule the kingdom of Kish-
kindha but become enemies because
of a misunderstanding. On one occa-
sion the two are fighting a magician
who has taken refuge in a cave. Bali
goes in, after instructing Sugriva on
certain signs that will indicate which
of them has been killed. Sugriva waits
outside the cave for a year, and then
sees the sign indicating his brother’s
death, which the cunning magician
has engineered during his own death.
Thinking that his brother is dead,
Sugriva rolls a stone over the mouth of
the cave to trap the magician, and
returns home. Bali eventually manages
to get out of the cave and, thinking that
his brother has used this opportunity
to get rid of him, forces Sugriva into
exile and keeps Sugriva’s wife as his
own. Sugriva lives in exile until he
makes an alliance with Rama, who kills
Bali by shooting him while Bali fights
with Sugriva. After regaining his king-
dom, Sugriva is a faithful ally to Rama,
and with his monkey armies aids in the
conquest of Lanka.
[[668]]

Suicide
An act whose permissibility and conse-
quences have elicited varying opinions
over time. In medieval times commen-
tators distinguished between several
types of suicide, depending on the cir-
cumstances surrounding the act. Any
suicide prompted by an overpowering
emotional impulse such as rage or grief
was always strictly forbidden, and those
who did this were said to reap dire
karmic consequences. Another case
entirely was suicide performed as an
expiation (prayashchitta) for one’s sins,
which was often prescribed to expiate
one of the Four Great Crimes. A third
type was suicide by people suffering
from a terminal disease, or who were in
chronic pain. This sort of suicide was
performed according to a well-defined
ritual, intended to put the performer in
the proper frame of mind. This third
category was one of the rites designated
as “forbidden in the Kali [Age]”
(Kalivarjya), although it had been per-
mitted in earlier times. The most
fascinating sort of suicide was at pil-
grimage places (tirtha), particularly at
Allahabad. This was also done accord-
ing to a very specific ritual, and part of
the ritual required the performer to
name the benefit for which the rite was
being performed—in some cases libera-
tion of the soul (moksha), in other cases
life in heaven for many eons. This prac-
tice is well documented up to the seven-
teenth century, although it is no longer
done in contemporary times.
Sulfur
A pivotal substance in Indian alchemy,
the conceptual foundation for which is
its analysis of the world as a series of
bipolar opposites in tension with one
another, and the conviction that unify-
ing these opposing forces brings spiritu-
al progress and the end of reincarnation
(samsara). Hindu alchemy shares this
model of uniting or transcending
opposing forces with Hindu tantra, a
secret, ritually based system of religious
practice, and with hatha yoga, which isSun
based on a series of physical exercises
that are also believed to affect the
subtle body.
In the alchemical tradition, the gov-
erning metaphor for this combination of
opposites is the union of sun and moon.
Both are connected to other opposing
principles through an elaborate series of
associations, in keeping with this bipo-
lar symbolism. In Hindu alchemical
conceptions, sulfur is conceived of as
the uterine blood of Shakti, and thus a
powerful element. It is also identified
with the sun, with heat, dryness, and
withering force. When sulfur is mixed
and consumed with elemental mercury,
which is identified with the god Shiva’s
semen, the aspirant’s gross body is puri-
fied and refined, eventually rendering it
immortal. Modern descriptions of this
practice invariably warn that it should
only be carried out under the direction
of one’s guru (spiritual teacher), since
otherwise the combination will be
harmful. This warning is not surprising,
since by itself mercury is a deadly poison.

hushan B. Dasgupta, Obscure Religious
Cults, 1962; and David Gordon White,
The Alchemical Body, 1996.father of Rama. As Rama, his wife Sita,
and his brother Lakshmana are going
into exile, Sumantra accompanies
them to the River Ganges to make sure
that the trio will comply with their
orders. When the three board the boat
on which the boatman Guha will take
them over the river, Sumantra bids
Rama a tearful farewell.
Sulva SutrasSumitra
(“aphorisms on measurement”) A col-
lection of brief sayings giving the exact
rules for constructing the sacrificial
altars for the public Vedic sacrifices. The
Sulva Sutras were connected to the
Shrauta Sutras, which laid down the
ritual prescriptions for these rites, of
which the preparation of the site was
an obvious necessity. Given the
premise that the sacrifice would be
unsuccessful unless it was performed
exactly right, such precise attention
to the altar’s construction seems a
necessary consequence.
Sumantra
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Sumantra is one of
the ministers of King Dasharatha, the
Sumati
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
King Sagar. Through a sage’s boon,
Sumati and her co-wife Keshini are
given a choice in the number of children
they would bear—one will bear a single
son through whom the lineage will con-
tinue, whereas the other will bear sixty
thousand sons who will die before they
have any offspring. Sumati chooses the
latter, and when her sixty thousand
handsome sons go out to search for
their father’s sacrificial horse, they are
burned to ash by the fury of the sage
Kapila. Although these sons die without
issue they still have a profound affect on
the world, since Keshini’s descendants
bring the River Ganges down to earth to
bring peace to their souls.
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Sumitra is one of the
three wives of King Dasharatha and the
mother of Rama’s half-brothers, the
twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna. In
their fidelity and service to Rama, her
sons are important characters in the
epic, but aside from bearing them,
Sumitra has little importance.
Sun
In Hindu astrology (jyotisha), a planet
generally associated with strength and
vitality, although it can be malevolent,
possibly reflecting the relentless
destructive power of the Indian sun. The
sun’s vitality makes it a strong planet,
and as in Western astrology the sun’s
position in the zodiac plays a major role
in fixing a person’s natal horoscope
[[669]]
Sundaramurtti
The Sun Temple at Konarak, Orissa. It was built in the thirteenth century
to resemble the chariot that was believed to carry the sun.
(janampatrika). The sun presides over
Sunday, a day of the week that is not
strongly marked as either auspicious or
inauspicious. See also Surya.
Sundaramurtti
(8th c.) The last of the Nayanars, a
group of sixty-three southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhak-
ta) of the god Shiva. Along with their
contemporaries the Alvars, who were
devotees of Vishnu, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of
Hindu religion through their passion-
ate devotion (bhakti) to a personal god,
conveyed through hymns sung in the
Tamil language. Along with his prede-
cessors, Appar and Sambandar,
Sundaramurtti actively opposed the
heterodox sects of the times, particu-
larly the Jains, whom he reviles in his
poems. The collected hymns of the
three most important Nayanars—Appar,
Sambandar, and Sundaramurtti—com-
prise the Devaram, the most sacred of
[[670]]

the Tamil Shaivite texts. Sundaramurtti
is also important for his catalog of the
sixty-three Nayanars, which forms
the first literary source for Tamil
Shaivite hagiography.
Sundareshvara
(The “Handsome Lord”) Epithet of the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
husband of the goddess Minakshi.
Minakshi is the presiding deity of the
Minakshi temple in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. See Shiva.

(Ravivar) First day of the Hindu week,
whose presiding planet (and deity) is
the sun (ravi). As a day, Sunday is con-
sidered generally auspicious but not
particularly powerful, probably because
the sun is acknowledged as a deity but is
not widely worshiped as a primary one.Surat-Shabd-Yoga
Sun TempleSurapana
The most famous temple to the sun is at
Konarak in Orissa state, right on the
shore of the Bay of Bengal. The temple
was built by King Narasimhadeva (r.
[[1238]]
–1264), a monarch in the Ganga
dynasty, and the entire temple was
intended to be a likeness of the sun’s
chariot. It has twelve great wheels
carved on the sides at the temple’s low-
est level, and in front, statues of several
colossal horses. As at the temples of
Khajuraho, the lower levels here are
covered with erotic and sexually explicit
carvings, to which people have given
differing interpretations: Some claim
that these sanction carnal pleasure as a
religious path, some interpret them alle-
gorically as representing human union
with the divine, and still others view
them as teaching that the desire for
pleasure must ultimately be transcended
to attain the divine.
The temple was built on a massive
scale; according to one estimate, the
central spire would have been over 200
feet high. It is uncertain whether this
spire was ever actually completed, since
the sandy soil on which the temple plat-
form was built would have been unable
to support the weight of such an enor-
mous structure. This same unstable soil
has been the greatest contributor to the
temple’s increasing deterioration. The
primary structure left at the site is the
jagamohan (assembly hall), which was
filled with sand in the nineteenth century,
in an effort to prevent further collapse.
For further information see Roy Craven,
Indian Art, 1997.(“liquor-drinking”) In the dharma liter-
ature, one of the Four Great Crimes
whose commission made one an out-
cast from society. Although in modern
times the word sura is the term for
“wine,” here it was believed to refer to a
particular type of spirituous liquor
made from rice flour. For members of
the three highest social groups—brah-
mins, kshatriyas, and vaishyas, the
most commonly prescribed penance
(prayashchitta) for habitually drinking
sura was to drink this same beverage
boiling hot, until one died. Interestingly,
this penalty does not apply to members
of the lowest social class, the shudras.
This difference reflected their lower sta-
tus, in which they were not held to the
same sorts of scrupulous standards as
the “twice-born.” Despite the harsh
penalty for drinking sura, there were
other sorts of intoxicants that kshatriyas
and vaishyas could drink without penalty,
although brahmins who drank these
had to perform mild penances.
Suparna
(“having beautiful wings”) Epithet of the
god Vishnu’s vehicle, the divine eagle
Garuda. See Garuda.
Superhuman Powers
Widely believed to be attainable, either
through voluntarily suffering harsh phys-
ical asceticism (tapas) or as products of
high spiritual attainment. See Siddhi.
Surasa
In Hindu mythology, Surasa is the mother
of all the Nagas, a class of minor
divinities conceived in the form of ser-
pents. In the Ramayana, the earlier of
the two great Indian epics, Surasa takes
the form of a gigantic serpent to test the
fortitude of the monkey-god Hanuman,
who jumps over the sea to Lanka to
search for Sita, the god Rama’s kid-
napped wife. Surasa tells Hanuman that
no one can go by without passing
through her mouth, and in response
Hanuman makes himself larger and
larger. Surasa in turn opens her jaws
wider and wider, and finally Hanuman
becomes very small and darts in and out
of her mouth. Surasa, pleased with
Hanuman’s ingenuity and courage, gives
him her blessing.
Surat-Shabd-Yoga
Mystical discipline in the Radha Soami
religious community, which stresses the
[[671]]
Surdas
joining (yoga) of the spirit (surat) with
the Divine Sound (shabd). The Divine
Sound emanates from the Supreme
Being and is always present. Most peo-
ple cannot hear it due to their preoccu-
pation with worldly things. With proper
training and devotion to a true guru
(satguru), anyone can eventually
become attuned to the Divine Sound,
and resonate in harmony with it. The
most important part of this path is con-
tact with a true guru, since only a true
guru has access to the divine and is con-
sidered a manifestation of the divine
itself. Devotion to a true guru is the sin-
gle most important factor in a person’s
spiritual development, and this spiritual
progress hinges on complete surrender
to the guru’s grace.
This metaphor of the Divine Sound,
and human resonance with it, has much
in common with the images used by
Guru Nanak, the first of the Sikh gurus,
and with the Nathpanthis before him.
The overwhelming stress on a guru
makes it possible for this religious
discipline to be practiced by just
about anyone, and most of the Radha
Soami followers are householders living
in the world rather than ascetics. For
further information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1990;

soami Reality, 1991.
Surdas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are
devotees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all
eight poets are also named as members
of the community and as associates
of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. In this literature, as
recounted in the Chaurasi Vaishnavan
ki Varta (“Lives of eighty-four
[[672]]

Vaishnavas”), it was at Vallabhacharya’s
order that Surdas began to compose
poems about Krishna’s lila, his playful
interactions with the world and
his devotees. He then proceeded to
compose the 5,000-odd poems of
the Sursagar.
The oldest manuscripts paint a much
different picture of Surdas, for most of
them contain only a few hundred
poems, which are usually quite short.
The most important themes in the early
poetry are supplication (vinaya) and
separation (viraha), and although one
also finds the depictions of Krishna’s
childhood for which Surdas has become
most famous, these themes are more
important later in the poetic tradition.
Surdas’s poetry thus shows a wide range
of themes, from his own spiritual life to
devotional “glimpses” of Krishna; the
latter most commonly explore the reli-
gious tension between the image of
Krishna as a charming child and his alter
ego as lord of the universe. As in much of
Vaishnava devotional poetry, Surdas
composed these poems to invite his
hearers to enter Krishna’s world.
The difference between these
pictures raises doubts about the
connection between Surdas and
Vallabhacharya. Although songs by
Surdas have been worked into the rites
of the Pushti Marg, Surdas composed
no poetry in praise of Vallabhacharya,
unlike the other ashtachap poets. It
seems just as likely that, as the popular-
ity of Surdas’s poems grew, he was
“claimed” by the Pushti Marg as a fellow
Krishna devotee. In fact, there is very lit-
tle definitely known about him, includ-
ing whether or not he was actually blind,
as is generally accepted. Only two of the
oldest poems mention blindness; one of
these is clearly metaphorical, and the
other is part of a litany of the woes of old
age. As with so many of the bhakti
poets, one knows a great deal more
about the poems than the poet. For

Hawley, Krishna: The Butter Thief, 1983;

Sureshvara
Philosopher in the Advaita Vedanta
school, and one of two attested
disciples of the school’s founder,
Shankaracharya (788–820?), the other
being Padmapada. The Advaita school
upholds a philosophical position known
as monism, which is the belief that a sin-
gle Ultimate Reality lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely dif-
fering forms of that reality. Advaita pro-
ponents exemplify this belief in their
claim that reality is nondual (advaita)—
that is, that all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity. For Advaita proponents, the
assumption that the world is real as per-
ceived is a fundamental misunderstand-
ing of the ultimate nature of things and
a manifestation of avidya. Although
often translated as “ignorance,” avidya
is better understood as the lack of gen-
uine understanding, which ultimately
causes human beings to be trapped in
karmic bondage, reincarnation (sam-
sara), and suffering.
In Hindu thought, Sureshvara is the
only explicit proponent of leap philoso-
phy, although one can see traces of this
in the other figures in Advaita Vedanta,
particularly in his teacher. Leap philoso-
phy affirms that one can attain com-
plete freedom from bondage, which in
the Indian context is identified as the
end of reincarnation and final liberation
of the soul (moksha), but that such free-
dom cannot be gained by a precisely
specified sequence of causes and
effects. According to Sureshvara, since
the ultimate problem stems from one’s
mistaken understanding, the only solu-
tion can come from purified, correct
understanding. Sureshvara’s path, such
as it is, is to use a negative dialectic to
distinguish clearly what the Self is not,
and when one’s mind has been pre-
pared, to gain a flash of mystic insight
through hearing one of the mahavakyas
(“great utterances”) that identify the
Self with Brahman. Sureshvara affirms
that actions can have no part in this
process, since action is bound up with
the world and is pervaded by igno-
rance. For further information see A. J.
Alston (trans.), The Naiskarmya Siddhi
of Sri Suresvara, 1959; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara
and His Pupils, 1981.
Sursagar
(“Ocean of Sur”) Corpus of poetry in the
Braj Bhasha language ascribed to the
northern Indian poet-saint Surdas.
Traditional versions of the Sursagar are
divided into twelve parts, to mirror the
structure of the Bhagavata Purana,
which is the most important Sanskrit
source for the mythology of the god
Krishna. Surdas was a Krishna devotee
(bhakta), and this arrangement is a way
to confer the luster of an authoritative
Sanskrit text on vernacular religious
poetry. Just as the Bhagavata Purana
lavishly describes Krishna’s youthful
exploits, the Sursagar is most commonly
associated with poems painting
intimate and affectionate pictures
of Krishna’s childhood.
Although the poetry published in
editions of the Sursagar is ascribed to
Surdas, most of it is certainly pseudony-
mous. The oldest manuscripts of
Surdas’s poetry have at most a few hun-
dred poems, and the size of this corpus
roughly doubles every century, reaching
the five thousand poems in the present
Sursagar. The general tone of the earliest
poems also shows a marked thematic
difference. Although they include
Krishna’s childhood, a far greater per-
centage express the poet’s pangs of sep-
aration (viraha) from Krishna or com-
plaint (vinaya) about his spiritual trou-
bles. Even the earliest manuscripts show
no common body of poems, and it
seems likely that from the very begin-
ning the “Surdas” poetic tradition was
drawn from the songs of wandering
singers, a characterization that fits well
with the image of the poet himself. For

Saints of India, 1988.
Surya
The sun, both in its physical form as a
celestial phenomenon and personified
as a deity. The sun has been an impor-
tant deity as far back as the Vedas, the
earliest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts, and has retained a posi-
tion of some importance since that time.
One example of this is the Gayatri
Mantra, a sacred formula that is sup-
posed to be recited every day by twice-
born males, that is, men from the three
“twice-born” groups—brahmin, ksha-
triya, and vaishya—who have under-
gone the adolescent religious initiation
known as the “second birth.” The
Gayatri Mantra invokes the sun as the
generator and nourisher of all things,
and requests him to stimulate the minds
[[674]]

of those who perceive him. Surya is still
worshiped by many Smarta brahmins as
one of the “five-fold” (panchayatana)
deities (the others being Shiva, Vishnu,
the Goddess, and Ganesh), a practice
attributed to the Advaita philosopher
Shankaracharya. For some time Surya
was also the primary deity for certain
communities, particularly in eastern
India, although his cult has been largely
eclipsed in recent times. The most
spectacular example of this worship
is the temple of the sun at Konarak
(now ruined), whose claims to fame
stem from its enormous size and
the profuse erotic sculptures on its
exterior walls. For further information

Suryapraksha
(“effulgence of the sun”) Name given to
the banner that is the symbolic emblem
of the Mahanirvani Akhara, a particular
group of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis. The Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into different akharas or regi-
ments on the model of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Nagas’ primary occupation was as
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests; both
of these have largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have particular features that signify
their organizational identity, and this
particular banner—one with strong
connections to a martial identity—is
one such feature.
Suryavarman II
(r. 1112–1153) Ruler of the Khmer peo-
ple in Cambodia, whose reign saw the
construction of the massive temple
complex at Angkor Wat. Although
Suryavarman and his people were
native Cambodians, the temples at
Angkor Wat were dedicated to Hindu
deities, showing the vast influence of
contemporary Indian culture.
Sushruta
(4th c.) Physician and writer who is tra-
ditionally regarded as the author of the
Sushruta Samhita. Along with the
slightly earlier Charaka Samhita, the
Sushruta Samhita is one of the two
major sources for ayurveda, an Indian
medical tradition.
Sushruta Samhita
Along with the slightly earlier Charaka
Samhita, one of the two major sources
for the Indian medical tradition known
as ayurveda. Underlying ayurveda is the
theory of the three bodily humors—vata
(wind), pitta (bile), and kapha (phlegm).
Each is composed of different elements,
and although everyone has all three
humors, their varying proportions are
used to explain differing body types,
metabolic dispositions, and personali-
ties. The cause of disease is an imbal-
ance of these humors—whether
caused by environmental sources or
personal habits—whereas the state of
this equilibrium is the state of health.
The Sushruta Samhita has been edited
and translated into various languages,
and served as a source for secondary
studies, such as Debiprasad Chatto-
padhyaya, Science and Society in Ancient
India, 1977.
Sushumna
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conceptions of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the
material body. It is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are the bodily abodes of the two
divine principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power)—the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini—
conceived in the form of a coiled ser-
pent. In the types of yoga that focus on
the subtle body, the ultimate aim is to
awaken the kundalini, and move it up
through the chakras to the abode of
Shiva. The union of Shiva and Shakti in
the aspirant’s body mirrors the action
of these divine forces in the macro-
cosm, and with this union the aspirant
gains bliss and final liberation of the
soul (moksha).
The sushumna is the middle of the
three vertical channels in the subtle
body—the side channels are the ida
nadi and the pingala nadi—and it is by
far the most important of the three. The
sushumna provides the pathway for the
rising kundalini as it awakens and
straightens during the aspirant’s spiritu-
al exercises, piercing through the
chakras on its way. In most people the
[[675]]
Suta
sushumna is closed where it intersects
the chakras, which blocks the flow of
energy from moving smoothly through
it. When the chakras have been pierced
and opened by the rising kundalini, the
passageway has been opened for the
kundalini to rise to the abode of Shiva,
and effect the union of Shakti and Shiva
that will bring ultimate realization. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,

Tantra, 1973; Swami Agehananda
Bharati, The Tantric Tradition, 1975; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of
the Three Cities, 1990.
Suta
In Hindu mythology, a disciple of the
sage Vyasa, who is said to have recounted
the puranas to other renunciants in the
Naimisha forest. The puranas are an
important genre of religious texts that
collect all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Individual puranas are usu-
ally highly sectarian and intended to
promote the worship of one of the
Hindu gods, whether Vishnu, Shiva, or
the Goddess. The traditional puranas
are numbered at eighteen, and in
many of them Suta is named as the
narrator, in accordance with the legend
mentioned above.
Sutakashaucha
The impurity (ashaucha) caused by
childbirth (sutaka). All bodily effluvia
(hair, spittle, pus, blood, etc.) are
considered to be sources of impurity,
and because birth is attended with
these it is considered impure, even
though it is always regarded as an
auspicious and happy event. There is
also impurity caused by death, known as
maranashaucha, but the presence of
the corpse renders this impurity more
violent; needless to say, it is also consid-
ered inauspicious.
[[676]]

Sutra
(“thread”) In a metaphorical sense, a
sutra is a short phrase or aphorism that
can easily be committed to memory.
Many early philosophical and grammat-
ical texts were collections of such sutras,
which are so brief that they virtually pre-
suppose a commentary to explain their
meaning. In many cases the commen-
tary would have been an oral exchange
between teacher and student, thus
effecting the living transmission that is
still the norm in tantra, a secret, ritually
based religious practice. Memorizing
such sutras was a way to gain mastery
over an entire text, and the sutras could
also serve as an aid to memory for the
commentary, thus enabling a person to
preserve the “thread” of the argument.
In a more literal sense, the word sutra
can also refer to the cord or cords strung
through the centers of palm leaf manu-
scripts, which kept the pages of the text
in their proper order.
Svadharma
(“one’s own dharma”) In the dharma lit-
erature, svadharma is an individual’s
unique religious duty (dharma), based
on that person’s social position, stage of
life, and gender. The governing assump-
tion behind this notion is that every per-
son has a social role to fulfill, and each of
these roles is necessary for the mainte-
nance of society, no matter how humble
it might be. For each person, his or her
svadharma carries the highest authority,
and supersedes all other religious laws.
As one example, violence is generally
prohibited, but it is a necessary part of a
ruler’s svadharma—both to protect the
land from external invaders, and to pun-
ish criminals within the country. In both
cases the use of violence helps to main-
tain social order, which is the king’s pri-
mary duty. In the same way, society
depends on a host of other people fulfill-
ing their particular social roles. This
notion of social responsibility and inter-
connectedness is tied to religious fulfill-
ment through the notion of the Path of
Action (karmamarga). According to thisSvakiya
idea, selflessly performing one’s social
duty, for the good of the world rather
than through selfish desire, was also a
path to ultimate spiritual fulfillment and
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
According to this conception, since
every svadharma is potentially a path to
final liberation, each person has a path
that only he or she can tread.svadhishthana chakra is associated with
the human capacity for reproduction. It
is also identified as the bodily seat for
the subtle element of water, the fluid
medium through which reproduction is
possible. For further information see
Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe),
Shakti and Shakta, 1978; and Philip S.
Rawson, The Art of Tantra, 1973.
Svadhishthana ChakraSvadhyaya
In many schools of yoga, and in the eso-
teric ritual tradition known as tantra,
the svadhishthana chakra is one of the
six psychic centers (chakras) believed to
exist in the subtle body. The subtle body
is an alternate physiological system,
believed to exist on a different plane
than gross matter but with certain corre-
spondences to the material body. It is
visualized as a set of six psychic centers,
which are conceived as multipetaled
lotus flowers running roughly along the
course of the spine, connected by three
vertical channels. Each of these chakras
has important symbolic associations—
with differing human capacities, with
different subtle elements (tanmatras),
and with different seed syllables (bijak-
sharas) formed from the letters of the
Sanskrit alphabet, thus encompassing
all sacred sound. Above and below these
centers are the bodily abodes of Shiva
(awareness) and Shakti (power), the two
divine principles through which the
entire universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept of the subtle body is thus
the fundamental similarity and inter-
connectedness of macrocosm and
microcosm, an essential Hindu idea
since the time of the mystical texts
known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally list-
ed from the bottom up, and the svad-
hishthana chakra is the second. It is
visualized as a six-petaled lotus located
in the region of the genitals. The petals
each contain a seed syllable formed
from a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, in
this case the consonants from “ba”
to “la.” On a symbolic level, the(“study”) Study of the sacred texts,
which connotes oral recitation, since
these texts were traditionally studied by
reciting them. This is one of the meth-
ods named in the Yoga Sutras as one of
the preparatory elements to yoga, since
the text claims that such study attenu-
ates one’s karmic hindrances and fosters
the ability to enter trance. Even in mod-
ern times the act of reciting a religious
text is seen to have multiple spiritual
benefits and, if performed over a long
period of time, to be able to transform
the person reciting.
Svakiya
(“belonging to oneself”) Mode of con-
ceiving the relationship between lover
and beloved, in which the man
and woman are married to each
other. The svakiya relationship is
socially respectable—sanctioned by
society, upholding social propriety,
fruitful, and procreative in its course.
Although this mode of relationship
is rich and celebrated, this very
social approval is said to make it
less intense than the adulterous parakiya
relationship, in which the lovers gain
nothing but their love itself. Although
in most cases the union between
the god Krishna and his consort
Radha is described as parakiya, some
Vaishnava communities—such as the
Radhavallabh community—claim that
this relationship is svakiya, perhaps
reflecting reservations about endorsing
adultery, even by the deities.
[[677]]
Svaprakasha
lilas in the town of Brindavan—they are
actually considered to be forms of the
deity, revealed within the context of the
lila. As one sign of this status, a regular
feature of such performances is time set
aside for darshan, in which the actors sit
perfectly still for the viewers to view
them as an act of worship, in the same
way that people would interact with an
image in a temple.
Svastika
In Indian traditions the image of a svastika, arms
pointed in a clockwise direction, symbolizes life,
prosperity, and good fortune.
Svaprakasha
(“self-revealing”) In Indian philosophy,
the notion that certain things such as
knowledge are self-revealing and do not
need anything else in order to be known.
The issue about whether these things
existed, and what they were if they did,
was a source of lively disagreement
among Indian thinkers.
Svarup
(“own-form”) In popular devotional dra-
mas such as the Ram Lila, which is
based on the story of the Ramayana,
svarup is the name for the child-actors
(most often brahmin boys) playing the
parts of the gods and goddesses.
Viewing these performances is not sim-
ply entertainment but also an act of reli-
gious devotion, since such dramas are
considered to be ways in which the gods
reveal themselves to their devotees
(bhakta). When the actors are in make-
up and in character—or wearing
crowns, as in the case of the Krishna
[[678]]

Although in the modern mind the
svastika is indelibly associated with
Adolph Hitler’s Germany, it has a long
and venerable history as an Indian sym-
bol, predating the Nazis by several thou-
sand years. The name is compounded
from su (“good”) + asti (“to be”) + ka
(“making”), and a general translation
would be something like “bringing good
fortune.” In Hindu India the svastika is a
symbol of life, prosperity, and good for-
tune, at least when the arms are point-
ing in a clockwise direction. Circling an
object in this direction presents one’s
right side to the central object, and since
this side is considered purer, the svastika
with arms pointing clockwise is consid-
ered more auspicious than its counter-
clockwise counterpart.
Svastikasana
(“svastika-posture”) One of the sitting
postures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras. In this posi-
tion, the right foot is inserted into the
space between the left thigh and calf,
and the left foot into the space between
the right thigh and calf (one of the feet is
pointing upwards, and the other down-
ward). The opposing directions of the
feet and the crossed legs evokes images
of the svastika, hence the name.
Svatahpramanya
(“self-validating”) In Indian philosophy,
the notion that certain things, such as
knowledge, are self-validating. This
means that they can be definitively
known to be true in themselves, withoutSvayamsevak
reference to any of the other pramanas,
the means by which human beings can
gain true and accurate knowledge. The
issue about whether these things existed,
and what they were if they did, was a
source of lively disagreement among
Indian thinkers.
Svayambhu
(“self-born”) Epithet of the god Brahma.
This name underscores his role as the
fashioner of the worlds—as the agent
responsible for arranging the cosmos,
he cannot himself be a created being.
According to Hindu mythology, at the
beginning of each cycle of creation
Brahma emerges from the calyx of a
lotus that sprouts from the god Vishnu’s
navel; at the time of cosmic dissolution
he again enters the lotus, and is reab-
sorbed into Vishnu’s body. See Brahma.
Svayambhu
(“self-manifested”) Images
Name denoting any image of a Hindu
divinity believed to exist by virtue of
divine self-revelation, rather than by
being made or established by human
hands. These images are believed to be
intensely holy and powerful, and to have
a more pronounced sense of the deity’s
presence. They mark instances where
these deities have revealed themselves
out of grace, in order to become accessi-
ble to their devotees (bhakta), and
they are places where the deities are
believed to be particularly present and
“awake,” and thus more receptive to
requests for favors.
Svayambhu images can be found for
each of the three major Hindu deities.
Images of the Goddess are often natural
rock formations, such as the image of
the goddess Kamakhya, which is a nat-
ural cleft in the rock, or the stone images
of many of the Shiwalik goddesses; they
can take other forms as well, such as the
image of the goddess Jwalamukhi,
which is a burning vent of natural gas.
For the god Vishnu, the best-known
self-manifested form is the shalagram, a
black stone containing the spiral-
shaped fossil shell of a prehistoric sea
creature, which is believed to be a sym-
bol of his discus (chakra). The god
Shiva’s pillar-shaped symbol known as
the linga appears in the widest variety of
self-manifested forms. Many of these
self-manifested lingas are found in nat-
ural rock formations, such as at
Kedarnath; Amarnath, where the linga
appears as a pillar of ice; and the bana
linga, which is a naturally rounded
stone, usually small enough to be easily
portable. Further, in the Hindu religious
groups that stress the subtle body, both
Shiva and the Goddess are believed to
be present within one’s own body. In
some cases for all these deities, carved
images are claimed to be self-manifest
forms; in their usual motif the statue’s
location is revealed to a favored devotee
in a dream. A self-manifested image
is a powerful claim for any site and will
bolster its importance as a place of
divine access.
Svayamsevak
(“volunteer”) Rank-and-file member of
the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
The RSS is a conservative Hindu organi-
zation the express purpose of which is
to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India; for most of its
history it has characterized its mission
as cultural and character-building
rather than religious or political. The
svayamsevaks are the rank-and-file
members of the local RSS branches
(shakhas), and are thus “foot soldiers”
who make up the organization’s core
membership. The shakhas in any given
area are overseen by a full-time RSS
worker known as a pracharak (“direc-
tor”), who serves as a liaison between
the local units and the RSS leadership,
and oversees RSS activity in his area.
The svayamsevak is the lowest level
of RSS membership. Most members do
not advance beyond this rank, since to
do so requires complete commitment to
the RSS and its ideals; those who do,
however, are usually gifted leaders. The
[[679]]
Svayamvara
primary stress at the shakha level is on
forming personal relationships with
other members, as a way to develop loy-
alty to the organization. Each shakha, or
local unit, holds a daily meeting.
Activities include an opening ceremony
in which the organization’s saffron ban-
ner is raised; traditional games or exer-
cises, including a martial drill; and a dis-
cussion period in which RSS ideals can
be disseminated and propagated.
Svayamvara
(“self-choice”) In Hindu mythology, a
form of marriage in which the bride
would choose the groom she wanted,
indicating her choice by placing her gar-
land around his neck. In the stories in
which a svayamvara occurs, the bride-
to-be is usually of royal lineage, as are
her suitors, so the bride’s choice was an
exercise fraught with potential political
consequences. One famous mythic
svayamvara was that of Nala and
Damayanti, in which Damayanti prefers
Nala even to the gods who have come as
suitors. This story also illustrates the
dangers of such a choice, when an
unhappy suitor cursed the couple to
endure separation and privation.
Swami Malai
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on a hill
in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu,
just outside the temple-town of
Kumbhakonam. Swami Malai is part of
the network of six temples in Tamil
Nadu built to honor Murugan, a hill
deity who has been assimilated into the
larger pantheon as a form of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva. Five of these
temples have been definitively identi-
fied, and each is associated with a par-
ticular region, a particular ecosystem,
and a particular incident in Murugan’s
mythic career. In the case of Swami
Malai, it is said to be where he taught the
meaning of the sacred syllable (Om) to
his father Shiva, and thus presents him
in the aspect of a teacher, which is one of
his identifying features in Shaiva
[[680]]

Siddhanta (a series of fourteen texts, all
completed by the fourteenth century
C.E., which reinterpret the ideas about
Shiva found in Nayanar devotional
poetry). The sixth of these temples is said
to be every other shrine to Murugan in
Tamil Nadu. This belief seems to stress
Murugan’s presence throughout Tamil
Nadu and sacrilize the entire landscape,
giving mythic significance to every
Murugan temple, no matter how small.
The cult of Murugan is thus a symbolic
vehicle for Tamil pride and identity, and
since the number six has connotations
of completeness—as in the six direc-
tions, or the six chakras in the subtle
body—it also suggests that nothing out-
side is needed. For further information
see Fred Clothey, “Pilgrimage Centers in
the Tamil Cultus of Murukan,” in the
Journal of the American Academy of
Religion, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1972.
Swaminarayan Sect
Modern religious community devoted to
the god Vishnu; its practice is based on
the life and teachings of Sahajananda
Swami (1781–1830), who was born near
the sacred city of Ayodhya in eastern
India but spent much of his life in the
western Indian state of Gujarat.
Sahajananda took initiation as an
ascetic and soon became a mahant, or
ascetic leader. His followers revered him
first as a religious preceptor (guru), and
later as a partial incarnation of the god
Krishna himself. They believed that
manifestations of the god Vishnu, such
as Krishna, are born on earth in times of
extreme trouble. It was in this latter
aspect that he was given the name
Swaminarayan (“Lord Narayan”), and
his followers believed that he was the
highest manifestation of God in human
form. The Swaminarayan sect has sev-
eral million lay devotees (bhakta), most
of whom are affluent Gujarati mer-
chants. In keeping with the commu-
nity’s ascetic roots, however, its most
important figures are the ascetics who
run the organization and who serve as
teachers and advisers to them. For furtherSYDA
information see Raymond Brady
Williams, A New Face of Hinduism, 1984.
SYDA
(Siddha Yoga Dham America) Religious
organization founded by Swami
Muktananda (1908–1982), which has
ashrams and centers around the world.
Siddha Yoga’s metaphysics are a modi-
fied form of Kashmiri Shaivism, but its
signature teaching is the notion that the
guru’s grace can immediately awaken
the disciple’s latent kundalini (spiritual
power, the most vital substance of the
subtle body) and speed the process of
spiritual development. This teaching
puts an even greater emphasis on the
importance of the guru as spiritual
teacher, and the overwhelming empha-
sis pervades the whole movement.
Although it has Indian members, most
of its followers are non-Indian converts,
who may be engaged in a spiritual
search but who have little interest in
becoming culturally Indian. The organi-
zation was headed by Muktananda until
his death in 1982; for most of the time
since then it has been presided over by
his successor, Chidvilasananda.
