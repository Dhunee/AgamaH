Radha
In later devotional (bhakti) literature,
Radha is the woman portrayed as the
god Krishna’s lover and companion.
Radha’s love for Krishna is a symbol of
the soul’s hunger for union with the
divine, expressed through the poetic
conventions of erotic love.
Although a few references to Radha
in poetry date back to the seventh cen-
tury, her first developed portrayal is in
Jayadeva’s lyric poem the Gitagovinda,
written around the twelfth century. The
Gitagovinda tells the story of Radha and
Krishna’s passion, their conflict and sep-
aration, and their eventual reconcilia-
tion. Jayadeva’s portrayal of Radha is
unique. In the poem Radha wishes to
have Krishna all to herself, as his sole
lover and companion. She sulks jealously
when he flirts with other women and
angrily dismisses him when he comes to
her marked with the signs of another
tryst. In the end, however, they reconcile
and make passionate love as a symbol of
their union.
This picture of love, separation, and
reunion between Radha and Krishna
gains a sharper focus through the con-
text set by Jayadeva’s hymn Dashavatara
Stotra . In it Jayadeva lists the achieve-
ments of Krishna’s ten incarnations
(avatars) immediately after the text’s
introductory verses. The concluding
verses of the hymn explicitly refer to
Krishna as the ultimate source of the
ten avatars, reminding hearers that the
person taking part in this drama of
jealousy, repentance, and reconcilia-
tion is none other than the Lord of the
Universe Himself, who in ages past has
acted to preserve the world from
destruction. Unlike earlier depictions
[[542]]

of Krishna in which his connections
with his devotees (bhakta) are por-
trayed as a form of “play” (lila), the
Krishna found in the Gitagovinda
seems less lofty and detached, more
intimately and intensely involved with
Radha as the object of his affection.
The poem renders Krishna as one who
feels emotions deeply and truly and
meaningfully reciprocates the feelings
of his devotee.
Jayadeva’s poetic focus is on the
inner dynamic between the two lovers,
and he reveals little about Radha outside
this relationship. In the time after the
Gitagovinda, Radha’s character devel-
oped in various ways. Some poets
describe her as married to another man,
thus giving Radha’s trysts with Krishna
the color of adulterous, forbidden love.
This love is considered more intense in
Indian poetics, since the lovers have
nothing to gain from the liaison but the
love itself and stand to lose everything
should they be discovered. Here Radha
stands as the symbol of one willing to
risk and lose all for the sake of love itself.
The other way in which Radha’s char-
acter is developed runs contrary to this
adulterous portrayal. In some traditions
Radha is not drawn as a simple woman
consumed with love for Krishna, but as
his wife, consort, and divine power
(shakti), through whose agency Krishna
is able to act in the world. This deified
image of Radha was particularly impor-
tant for the Nimbarka religious commu-
nity, which conceived of Radha and
Krishna as forms of Lakshmi and
Narayana. Another group espousing
this equality was the Radhavallabh
community, whose members particularly
stressed the love Krishna felt for Radha.

Goddesses, 1986.
Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli
(1888–1975) Modern Indian philosopher
and statesman. Like many elite IndiansRadhakrishnan, Sarvepalli
Radha, the god Krishna’s lover and companion.
[[543]]
Radhashtami
of his generation, Radhakrishnan was
educated at Christian missionary
schools, and the contrast between the
Hindu piety of his home and the
Christian doctrine he encountered at
school sparked his interest in compara-
tive philosophy. He spent the rest of his
life as an interpreter and apologist for
classical Hindu thought, particularly
the Vedanta school, and as a proponent
of philosophical idealism, the notion
that absolute truth can be found
through intuition alone. Aside from his
work as a college teacher and adminis-
trator, he also served as the vice presi-
dent of India from 1952 to 1962, and as
president from 1962 to 1967. For further
information on his thought, see his An
Idealist View of Life, 1981; Paul A.
Schilpp, The Philosophy of Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan, 1952; and Robert N.
Minor, “Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
‘Hinduism’ Defined and Defended,” in
Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in Modern
India, 1998.
Radhashtami
(“Radha’s eighth”) Festival falling on the
eight day of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September); this day is cele-
brated as the birthday of Krishna’s con-
sort Radha. Radha is seen differently by
various Vaishnava religious communi-
ties: For some she is a human woman,
the symbol of the perfect devotee
(bhakta) who forsakes all else to be with
her lover, for others she is considered
the queen of heaven and an equal to
Krishna himself. In either case, her
closeness to him is shown by her birth
on the same month and lunar day as
Krishna, but in the opposite half of the
month. Radhashtami festival is celebrated
with particular fervor in Barsana, the
village in the Braj region in which Radha
is said to have been born.
Radha Soami
Modern Hindu religious community
founded in 1861 in the city of Agra by
[[544]]

Shiv Dayal Singh, more commonly
referred to as Soamiji Maharaj. Soamiji’s
family had been influenced by Tulsi
Saheb, a devotional (bhakti) saint who
lived in that region, and Soamiji’s teach-
ings reflect the importance of that
contact. The two pillars of Radha Soami
doctrine are the importance of the
spiritual teacher (guru) and the practice
of a spiritual discipline called surat-
shabd-yoga.
According to Radha Soami teachings,
contact with a guru is the single most
important factor in a person’s spiritual
development, and this spiritual progress
hinges on complete surrender to the
guru’s grace. It is essential for the devo-
tee (bhakta) to be associated with a
“true guru” (satguru), since not only
does such an individual have access to
the divine, he is considered a manifesta-
tion of the divine itself. Surat-shabd-
yoga stresses joining (yoga) the
devotee’s spirit (surat) with the Divine
Sound (shabd). The Divine Sound
emanates from the Supreme Being and
is always present. Most people cannot
hear it, due to their preoccupation with
worldly things, but with proper training
and devotion to a true guru, anyone can
eventually become attuned to the
Divine Sound and resonate in harmony
with it.
In the era since Soamiji Maharaj, the
Radha Soami Satsang has split numer-
ous times, usually based on disagree-
ments over spiritual authority. Given the
Radha Soami emphasis on the satguru
as the Supreme Being, disagreements
over spiritual succession—in effect, dis-
agreements over the identity of the
Supreme Being—made schisms virtually
inevitable. It also seems clear that the
underlying forces in many of these
schisms were disagreements over
far more mundane things, such as
power, status, and property. Various
branches of the Radha Soamis
have made successful missionary
efforts and established centers in
Europe and the United States. For
further information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991;Rahu

[[1987]]
; and Mark Juergensmeyer, Radha-
soami Reality, 1991.
Radhavallabh Sampraday
Religious community whose members
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu
(that is, Vaishnavas), and whose founder
was the sixteenth-century poet-saint
Harivamsh. Harivamsh held distinctive
views on the status of Radha, which his
community has preserved. Whereas
earlier poetry had often portrayed
Radha as the god Krishna’s adulterous
mistress, the Radhavallabhans conceive
of her as his lawful wife and as a deity
whose status was equal with Krishna’s.
Their devotion was focused on Krishna
and on his status as the “beloved of
Radha” (Radhavallabh).
Raga
In Indian music, a concrete melodic
mode of at least five notes. Any musician
playing a raga is limited by the con-
straints of its established form. The
order of these established notes in the
raga does not follow their musical order
but differs according to whether the
note sequence is ascending or descend-
ing. There are over 200 recognized ragas,
but only about thirty are in general use.
Each raga has very particular symbolic
associations—particularly with the time
of day or with the seasons—and is also
believed to convey a particular aesthetic
mood (rasa) to listeners. As in all the
Indian arts, the musician who plays a
raga endeavors to convey a certain
mood to an audience and to awaken
corresponding feelings within them.
Raghu
In Hindu mythology, Raghu is a famous
king of the Ikshvaku dynasty and the
grandfather of King Dasharatha. One of
Dasharatha’s sons is Rama, the protago-
nist of the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics.
Raghuvamsha
(“Raghu’s Lineage”) One of the great
poetic works by Kalidasa, who is gener-
ally considered to be the finest classical
Sanskrit poet. The Raghuvamsha is a
quasi-historical epic in nineteen cantos,
devoted to the kings of the Solar Line,
and particularly to its most eminent
member, the god-king Rama. The story
of Rama in Kalidasa’s poem is fairly close
to that of the epic Ramayana, although
Kalidasa describes Rama as an avatar or
divine incarnation in a way that Valmiki
does not. Kalidasa’s poem also uses the
kings of the Solar Line as examples of
devotion to the four aims of life
(purushartha): wealth (artha), pleasure
(kama), religious duty (dharma), and
release (moksha). In Kalidasa’s portrayal,
the kings at the end of the line are
completely immoral and devoted
solely to pleasure. Such abject neglect
of their duty to rule righteously brings
on the destruction of the line and
provides a exemplary lesson for hearers
of the poem.
Rahu
A malevolent “planet” in Hindu astrology
(jyotisha) that has no counterpart in
Western astrology and was originally the
head of a demon. According to the story,
as the gods drink the nectar of immor-
tality they have churned from the ocean
of milk, the demon Sainhikeya slips into
their midst in disguise. As the demon
begins to drink, the sun and moon alert
Vishnu, who uses his discus to cut off
the demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two
halves become immortal, however, after
coming into contact with the nectar. The
severed head becomes Rahu, and the
decapitated body another evil planet,
Ketu. Rahu is regarded not as a physical
planet, but as the ascending node of the
moon. This is the point where the
moon’s northward path intersects the
path of the sun in the sky, causing an
eclipse. Rahu has particular enmity for
the sun and moon, as the deities
responsible for his demise, and tries to
swallow them whenever he meets them
[[545]]
Raidas
in the heavens. He always succeeds, but
since he no longer has a body to digest
them, they escape unharmed through
Rahu’s severed neck. This, of course, is
the traditional explanation for solar and
lunar eclipses; their association with the
malevolent Rahu has led eclipses to be
seen as highly inauspicious times. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Raidas
A variant name for the Hindu poet-
saint Ravidas.
Rajabhiseka
(“royal anointing”) Royal consecration
ceremony that replaced the earlier raja-
suya rite. The Rajabhiseka includes ritu-
als of anointing that were believed to
have transformative power, but were
less complex than the Rajasuya, and did
not involve the ritual slaughter and sac-
rifice of animals.
Rajadharma
General name for the “king’s dharma,”
or religious duty, which fell to him (or far
more rarely, her) by virtue of his role as
ruler. This notion proceeded from the
assumption in the dharma literature
that every person had a unique role to
play in society, a role that provided for
social stability but also brought individ-
ual fulfillment. The king’s most basic
duty was to maintain order in the realm,
since such peace enabled all others to
fulfill their own individual religious
duties (svadharma). The dharma litera-
ture conceives of maintaining order pri-
marily through inflicting punishment
(danda), designed to remove some evil-
doers and frighten the rest into good
behavior. If the king succeeded in main-
taining social order, then he could oth-
erwise do as he pleased, with the proviso
that taxation should not be so high that
it was burdensome to the people.
Beyond this, the Indian theory of king-
ship was largely pragmatic.
[[546]]

Rajagrha
Ancient name for the city corresponding
to modern Rajgir, in the Nalanda district
of the state of Bihar. Although contem-
porary Rajgir is a small and insignificant
city, at the time of the Buddha it was the
capital of the Magadhan empire and the
center of the region’s political and intel-
lectual life. According to Buddhist tradi-
tion, Rajgir was the site of the first
Buddhist council, held shortly after the
Buddha’s death and organized to docu-
ment his teachings. This story is almost
certainly apocryphal, since the Buddhist
scriptures went through a much longer
period of development, but its setting
illustrates Rajagrha’s centrality in the
middle of the first millennium before
the turn of the common era.
Raja Raja
(r. 985–1014) Monarch under whose rule
(and that of his son Rajendra) the Chola
dynasty reached the apex of its power,
stretching its influence from the Tanjore
district of Tamil Nadu throughout
southern India and into southeast Asia
all the way to Malaysia. Raja Raja directed
the wealth that such power brought
toward the construction of massive
temples. Of these, he is most noted
for the Brhadeshvar temple in the city
of Tanjore, dedicated to the “Great
Lord” Shiva.
Rajas
(“passion”) One of the three fundamen-
tal qualities (gunas) believed to be pre-
sent in all things, the other two gunas
being sattva (“goodness”) and tamas
(“darkness”). According to this model,
differing proportions of these qualities
account for differences in the properties
of concrete things, and in the range of
individual human capacities and ten-
dencies. Unlike sattva and tamas, which,
respectively, carry exclusively good and
bad associations, rajas and its effects can
be either positive or negative, depending
on context. Rajas is negative, for example,
when it leads to an enslavement to theRajasthani
passions that may blind one to careful
and conscious thought. Alternately, the
energies derived from passion can also
engender useful activity and industri-
ousness. The notion of the gunas origi-
nated in the metaphysics of the
Samkhya school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, and
although much of Samkhya meta-
physics connected with the gunas has
long been discredited, the idea of the
gunas and their qualities has become a
pervasive assumption in Indian culture.
Rajashekhara
(10th c.) Dramatist notable for writing
plays both in Sanskrit and Prakrit.
Rajashekhara’s Sanskrit plays were highly
literary, and it seems that they were
probably intended for reading rather
than performance.
Rajasimhavarman
(8th c.) Ruler in the Pallava dynasty
who, like his predecessors, was a great
patron of the arts. His reign saw the con-
struction of the last of the magnificent
shore temples built on the Bay of
Bengal, at Mahabalipuram in Tamil
Nadu. The temple’s major deity was the
god Shiva, but a smaller shrine also held
an image of the god Vishnu. Although
these temples have been weathered by
time and the elements, they remain
some of the most visited sites in south-
ern India.
Rajasthan
(“land of kings”) Modern Indian state on
the border of Pakistan between the
states of Punjab and Gujarat, created by
combining a network of princely states
with Ajmer, formerly under British con-
trol. These principalities were the rem-
nants of small kingdoms, usually
maintained by force of arms, giving
Rajasthan its well-entrenched martial
tradition. Many cities in Rajasthan have
large forts originally built as defensive
strongholds, which in modern times
have been popular tourist attractions.
A miniature painting in the
Rajasthani style, circa 1730.
Geographically, the state is split diago-
nally by the Aravalli Hills, creating two
distinct climatic zones. The south gets
more rainfall and has traditionally been
more thickly settled, whereas the north
blends gradually into the Thar Desert—
rendered cultivable in recent years by a
system of irrigation canals. While the
state’s most important pilgrimage site is
the city of Pushkar, other locales of
interest abound. Among them, the tem-
ple of Hanuman at Mehndipur has
gained regional importance as a site for
curing mental illness, and the Karni
Mata temple in the village of Deshnok is
noted for its sacred rats. For general
information about Rajasthan and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference
is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed.,
Lonely Planet, 1998.
Rajasthani
One of the two influential “schools” of
Indian miniature painting, the other
being the Pahari. Distinctions between
the two schools are largely geographical
and thus somewhat arbitrary, since the
[[547]]
Rajasuya
Basohli paintings of the Pahari school
are stylistically closer to those of
Rajasthan than to works in the later
Pahari style.
The Rajasthani was the earliest
developed school; it flourished in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms of the Malwa region
such as Mandu, and in the kingdoms
that now comprise regions in modern
Rajasthan—particularly Bundi, Kota,
and Mewar, but also Jaipur and
Bikaner. The Rajasthani style is gener-
ally characterized by a flat perspective
and by visual power derived from vivid
colors, bands of which often serve as a
backdrop to the painting. For further
information see W. G. Archer, Indian
Painting, 1957.
Rajasuya
Royal consecration ceremony that is
one of the most famous of the sacrificial
rites that appear in the Vedas, the earli-
est and most authoritative Hindu reli-
gious texts. The ceremony is believed to
have developed in the latter part of the
Vedic era. Preparations for this rite could
last for a year, and the rite itself served
to raise the king to semidivine status. As
with many Vedic sacrifices, an impor-
tant part of the rajasuya sacrifice was
the ritual slaughter and offering of ani-
mals. This rite has long fallen into dis-
use, partly because of the trouble
required to prepare for it and partly
because of general disapproval over ani-
mal sacrifices. The coronation rite that
has replaced it is the rajabhiseka.
Rajatarangini
(“River of Kings”) Historical chronicle of
the kings of Kashmir, written in verse by
the Kashmiri poet Kalhana. The
Rajatarangini is an unusually descrip-
tive and accurate history of Kashmir and
the region’s political, social, and reli-
gious institutions; the text’s only short-
coming is that it pays little attention to
the outside world. Kalhana’s historical
emphasis is unusual for Indian writers,
[[548]]

and the Rajatarangini is one of the few
indigenous Indian histories.
Rajendra I
(r. 1014–42) Monarch under whose rule
(and that of his father, Raja Raja) the
Chola dynasty reached the apex of its
power, stretching its influence from the
Tanjore region in Tamil Nadu, through-
out southern India, and into southeast
Asia all the way to Malaysia. In 1023
Rajendra defeated one of the kings of
Bengal to extend his empire all the way
to the Ganges but was unable to main-
tain authority over this expansive
domain for long. He also fought a cam-
paign against the Shrivijaya Empire in
modern Malaysia, to retain control of
trade from China. Like his father,
Rajendra was a great patron of temple-
building and other public monuments,
including the great temple at Ganga-
ikondacholapuran, built to commemo-
rate the victory that opened the way to
the Ganges.
Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shri
(b. Mohan Chandra Rajneesh, 1931–
[[1990]]
) Controversial Hindu teacher who
mixed traditional Hindu teachings with
ideas gleaned from modern psychology.
He is most popularly associated with a
permissive attitude toward sexuality
that attracted many of his followers,
both Western and Indian, although the
former tended to predominate. This was
part of a more generally indulgent atti-
tude in which people were encouraged
to act upon their desires, as a way to
remove impediments to ultimate real-
ization. For some time his ashram was
located in Pune in the state of
Maharashtra, but in 1981 he relocated
to southern Oregon, propelled by local
opposition and an investigation by
Indian tax officials. For several years the
new site was highly successful, but local
opposition to his teachings and unease
about his lifestyle—he reportedly owned
ninety-three Rolls-Royces and was pro-
tected by Uzi-toting bodyguards—Raksha Bandhan
caused the spectacular collapse of this
community in 1985. Rajneesh returned
to India, where he eventually took up
residence in Pune again. In his last years
he changed his name several times—
once claiming that the spirit of
Gautama Buddha had entered him—
and at the time of his death had taken
the name Osho.
Rajput
(“king’s son”) Traditional Indian society
was modeled as a collection of endoga-
mous, or intermarried, subgroups
known as jatis (“birth”). These jatis were
organized (and their social status deter-
mined) by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation, over which each jati had a
monopoly. The Rajputs were a martial
Hindu jati that at times ruled large parts
of western India, and have always
claimed to be kshatriyas—buttressing
this claim by creating genealogies link-
ing their families to the mythical Solar or
Lunar Lines of kings. Their origin is
uncertain, for they first appear around
the end of the first millennium, and
many scholars speculate that they were
descended from the Hunas and later
assimilated into the small kingdoms.
The four main Rajput clans were known
as the Agnikula (“fire lineage”), because
they claimed descent from a single
mythical king who had arisen from a
sacrificial fire pit in Mount Abu,
Rajasthan. These four ruling clans were
the Pariharas in southern Rajasthan, the
Chauhans in the region around Delhi,
the Solankis in Gujarat, and the Pawars
in western Madhya Pradesh.
Whatever their origin, the Rajputs
were warrior princes whose martial
code stressed death before dishonor
and swift reprisals against any insult.
During the Moghul Empire era
(1525–1707) Rajput kings were often
feudal vassals, given kingdoms in
exchange for their loyalty and service.
After the breakup of the Moghul Empire
many of them continued to reign as the
rulers of small princely states. They
remain an important ruling class even in
modern times, through the medium of
parliamentary politics.
Rajrajeshvar Temple
Massive temple in the city of Tanjore in
state of Tamil Nadu, dedicated to the
god Shiva in his form as “Lord of Kings.”
Tanjore was the capital of the Chola
dynasty, and this temple, built approxi-
mately 1000 C.E. by the Chola king Raja
Raja, conveys the confidence of a king-
dom on the rise. Architecturally speak-
ing, the temple is an enlargement of the
simplest sort of Hindu temple, with a
garbhagrha covered by a spire, but it is
breathtaking in its scale. The tower over
the central shrine is 190 feet high and
looks even higher, since the construc-
tion minimizes any distracting elements
that would arrest the eye’s upward
journey. It is capped by a single piece
of stone weighing an estimated
eighty tons, which required a four-mile-
long ramp to put in place. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Raksha Bandhan
Festival day celebrated on the full moon
in the lunar month of Shravan
(July–August); this festival’s theme is the
bond of protection (raksha) between
brother and sister. On this day sisters tie
(bandhan) a string around the brother’s
right wrist, which is sometimes just a
simple thread and sometimes an elabo-
rately constructed ornamental bracelet.
Sisters then mark a tilak (tika) on the
brother’s forehead as a sign of respect
and feed their brothers sweets. For their
part, brothers give their sisters money,
clothing, jewelry, or other gifts.
As with the festival of Bhaiya Duj,
Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the protec-
tive bond between brothers and sisters.
In the long term, brothers are seen as
the family members who will protect
their sisters’ interests—since in many
cases daughters long outlive their
fathers and their brothers are the natal
relatives on whom they must depend.
Sisters perform these rites to protect
[[549]]
Rakshasa
their brothers from misfortune—the
string tied around the wrist is believed
to ward off evil. The festival of Raksha
Bandhan is also performed by men and
women who are not related by blood but
who are close to one another. Tying on
the string “makes” them brother and sis-
ter, and thus rules out the potential for
any romantic involvement, which would
be seen as a form of incest.
Rakshasa
In Hindu mythology, a particular type of
asura (demon). Rakshasas are generally
considered to be extremely powerful—
not only in terms of their prodigious
physical strength but also in their con-
siderable skill in the magical arts. They
are also generally characterized as
malevolent toward human beings,
whom they not only kill but also eat.
According to one myth, rakshasas are
born from Brahma’s anger when he
becomes hungry while reciting the
Vedas. The capital of the rakshasas is in
Lanka, and their most celebrated leader
is Ravana, whose death at the hands of
Rama is the climax of the Ramayana,
the earlier of the two great Hindu epics.
Rakshasa Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty. The
rakshasas are a class of demon, and the
rakshasa form of marriage took place
when a man had intercourse with a
woman after carrying her away by force.
Not surprisingly, this was one of the four
reprehensible (aprashasta) forms of
marriage and was forbidden because of
the woman’s lack of consent, even
though it was deemed a valid marriage.
(Here the writers’ concern seems to have
been to give the “bride” legal status as a
wife rather than to legitimate the actions
of the “groom.”) Theoretically valid, this
form of marriage has been forbidden
since the dharma literature was first
codified in the centuries before the
common era. Although the rakshasa
[[550]]

marriage has never been one of the
accepted forms of marriage, there are
groups in which a ritualized battle and
capture of the bride is part of the wed-
ding ceremony. One could even inter-
pret the barat, the procession of the
groom and his family to the wedding
location, as a ritualized triumphal entry
following conquest. See also marriage,
eight classical forms, marriage cere-
monies, and marriage prohibitions.
Rakshasi
A female form of the type of demon
known as a Rakshasa.
Raktabija
In the Devimahatmya, the earliest and
most important textual source for the
worship of the Goddess, Raktabija is the
name of one of the demons vanquished
by the goddess Kali. Raktabija has
received the boon that any drop of his
blood falling to the earth will instantly
turn into another version of himself,
rendering him practically unconquer-
able. Kali defeats this demon by drink-
ing his blood as it is shed, until finally it
is completely gone, and so is he.
Raktadantika
(“bloody teeth”) Powerful and protective
form of the Goddess, particularly noted
for killing demons and drinking their
blood. During the fall festival of
Navaratri, in which the Goddess is wor-
shiped in a different form on nine suc-
cessive nights, Raktadantika is her
manifestation revered on the fifth night.
Rama (Rama Avatar)
The seventh avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, the crown prince of the
Solar Line and the protagonist of the
Ramayana, one of the two great Indian
epics. As with all of Vishnu’s avatars,
Rama is born to destroy a being power-
ful enough to throw the cosmos out of
balance, in this case Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. The focal conflictRama (Rama Avatar)
in the Ramayana is Rama’s quest to
regain his wife Sita, who has been kid-
napped by Ravana. The climactic
sequence of the epic features Rama’s
struggle with Ravana, Ravana’s death,
and the reestablishment of cosmic equi-
librium, signified by Rama’s ascension
to divine kingship.
Unlike the god Krishna, whose
divine play (lila) often subverts or
ignores accepted social values, Rama is
a pillar of society. As a whole the
Ramayana tends to espouse and uphold
the traditional social values of religious
duty (dharma), social hierarchy (varna),
and the stages of life (ashrama). As the
epic’s protagonist, Rama is the epitome
of all these values. He is solid, depend-
able, stable, righteous, and predictable.
In Hindu culture Rama is the model of
the perfect son, and he shows this by
being utterly devoted to his parents,
giving far greater weight to his duties
as a son than as a husband. Unlike
Krishna, who has multiple liaisons
with his female devotees (bhakta), all in
the name of divine play, Rama is
married and monogamous. When
the time comes for battle, he is the
fiercest of combatants, incarnating
the warrior (kshatriya) ideal of using
strength to uphold justice, protect
the righteous, and punish the wicked.
In all these things he personifies some
of the most deeply embedded values
of Hindu culture.
Yet there are also some unsettling
incidents, particularly in the Valmiki
Ramayana, the epic’s earliest version.
These incidents either feature Rama
inexplicably stepping out of character
or else point to problematic tensions in
traditional Hindu values. In an attempt
to help the monkey-king Sugriva
against his rival Bali, Rama shoots Bali
in the back from a concealed place—
an action incompatible with the notion
of fair and honorable warfare. His
actions in enforcing the existing social
order also show its oppressive and
restrictive nature. In one incident, Rama
kills a low-status shudra whom he finds
The god Vishnu’s Rama avatar. In the Hindu epic
the Ramayana, Vishnu appears as Rama to defeat
Ravana, the demon king.
performing physical asceticism (tapas),
a privilege reserved for his betters, and
has molten lead poured in the ears of
another shudra who was discovered lis-
tening to the sacred Vedas—a forbid-
den act for such a person. Both
incidents show the hierarchical nature
of idealized Hindu society, and the
king’s role in preserving and sustaining
this hierarchy. When Rama and his
brother Lakshmana are propositioned
by Ravana’s sister Shurpanakha, they
first mislead and ridicule her, then
mutilate her by cutting off her ears
and nose. These actions seem incom-
patible with the kshatriya ethic of
respect for women and the righteous
use of force, and prompt Ravana to kid-
nap Sita in revenge.
Perhaps the most troubling ques-
tions arise from Rama’s behavior toward
his wife Sita. Immediately after being
liberated from enslavement, she under-
goes an ordeal by fire, from which her
emergence unscathed upholds her
[[551]]
Ramakrishna
claim that she remained chaste while
being held captive. Despite this defini-
tive proof, Rama later insists on a
second test, in which Sita, in protest, is
swallowed up by the earth. Thus, the
picture of Rama conveyed by the epic
is of a figure righteous by the standards
of his time but on occasion rigid
and inflexible.
In later versions of the Ramayana,
particularly the Ramcharitmanas by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?),
this picture subtly shifts, possibly in an
attempt to soften or remove these trou-
bling incidents. Certain changes in
Tulsidas’s text also highlight the central-
ity of devotion (bhakti) over all other
religious attitudes. Tulsidas’s Rama is
more explicitly portrayed as God incar-
nate, a figure who is aware of his divine
status and whose actions are undertaken
for the benefit of his devotees. This
Rama is still concerned with social val-
ues, particularly the kshatriya obligation
to uphold and protect religious duty
(dharma). Yet this ethic is in tension
with—and sometimes in opposition
to—the importance of bhakti, which is
portrayed as the ultimate religious goal.
These subtle shifts in the later text point
to an occasional conflict between two
differing ideals—dharma and bhakti—
both of which are affirmed as essential.

Ramakrishna
(1836–86) Bengali mystic and saint who
was one of the most remarkable figures
in the nineteenth-century revival of
[[552]]

Hinduism. Ramakrishna was the son of
a village priest and received little formal
education during his life. He retained
much of his rustic simplicity and spent
his adult life as a temple priest at the
Kali temple at Dakshineshwar, outside
the city of Calcutta. From his childhood
Ramakrishna had been devoted to the
Goddess Kali, and characterized him-
self as being “intoxicated with God.”
He sought and found the divine, first
through Kali but later through a variety
of other religious paths, including the
abstract monism of the speculative
Upanishads, devotion to the god
Vishnu, Christianity, and Islam. Out of
these experiences came his conviction
that the inner experience in all reli-
gious traditions was the same and led to
the same divine presence. Although
Ramakrishna did not publicize himself,
he became known in Calcutta’s religious
circles through his association with
Keshub Chander Sen, the leader of the
reformist Brahmo Samaj. This associa-
tion brought him disciples who would
spread his teachings, particularly
Narendranath Datta, better known as
Swami Vivekananda. For a devotee’s
perspective on Ramakrishna, see
Christopher Isherwood, Ramakrishna
and His Disciples, 1965; for a modern
psychological reading, see Jeffrey Kripal,
Kali’s Child, 1995.
Ramakrishna Mission
Hindu religious organization founded
in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda to prop-
agate the religious message of Vive-
kananda’s teacher, Ramakrishna. Since
its inception, the Ramakrishna Mission
has been equally dedicated to spiritual
uplifting and to social service, based on
Vivekananda’s realization that India
needed material development as much
as it needed religious instruction. The
mission has sought to fulfill part of this
charge by publishing inexpensive edi-
tions of religious texts, including but not
restricted to the teachings of Rama-
krishna and Vivekananda, and by spon-
soring social service in the fields ofRamanandi
education, medical care, and other
charitable works. For further informa-
tion see George M. Williams, “The
Ramakrishna Movement: A Study in
Religious Change,” in Robert D. Baird
(ed.), Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Ramana Maharishi
(1879–1950) Modern Hindu sage, whose
life and message reiterated the funda-
mental insight of the ancient specula-
tive Upanishads, namely, that the inner
Self (atman) is identical with Supreme
Reality (Brahman). Ramana was born
into a middle-class Indian family and
during his youth demonstrated no
unusual abilities. In 1895 he obtained a
copy of the Periya Puranam, a text
chronicling the lives of the poet-saints
known as the Nayanars, and in reading
about their lives Ramana began to desire
to renounce the world. This inclination
was realized the next year, when he
imagined the death of his body and
reached the conclusion that his real
identity was the Self. He left his family
and went to the temple of Tiru-
vannamalai, also known as Arunachala,
where he remained until his death fifty-
four years later. For some time at the
start he was deep in meditation and
barely attended to his physical needs.
Soon he attracted disciples, through
whom his family eventually discovered
his whereabouts, although Ramana
refused to return home with them when
they came to see him. His mother
moved to Tiruvannamalai in 1916, and
after her death five years later Ramana
relocated his dwelling to be near her
grave. Although he spoke very seldom,
he managed to compose two short
works—Self-Enquiry and Who am I?—in
which he stated his basic insights. For
further information see T. M. P.
Mahadevan, Ramana Maharshi, 1977.
Ramananda
(14th c.?) Sant poet-saint who is tradi-
tionally cited as the spiritual teacher
(guru) of the poet-saints Kabir,
Ravidas, Pipa, and others. The Sants
were a group of poet-saints from central
and northern India who shared several
general tendencies: stress on individual-
ized, interior religion leading to a per-
sonal experience of the divine; disdain
for external ritual, particularly image
worship; faith in the power of the divine
name; and a tendency to ignore conven-
tional caste distinctions. Ramananda is
said to have been a charismatic spiritual
leader, and is claimed to have been a
direct disciple of the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, who sent
Ramananda north to help spread the
devotional movement. The latter claim
is almost certainly false, given that the
only verse incontestably attributable to
Ramananda is found in the Adigranth,
the scripture of the Sikh community.
This verse does not reflect Ramanuja’s
Shrivaishnava tradition, in which the
primary deity is Vishnu, but instead
shows the influence of the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who stressed yoga. There are
other verses ascribed to Ramananda in
later sources, but their authenticity is
doubtful, and little can be definitely
known about his life.
Ramanandi
Renunciant ascetics, devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu, who are by far the
most numerous and most influential of
the Vaishnava ascetics. The Ramanandis
claim that their order was founded by
the religious teacher Ramananda, about
whom little is definitely known. For
some time the Ramanandis maintained
that Ramananda had been a disciple of the
southern Indian philosopher Ramanuja,
and thus that their sect had sprung out
of Ramanuja’s Shrivaishnava religious
community, but this claim was for-
mally renounced after a dispute at the
Kumbha Mela festival in the city of
Ujjain in 1921. Ramananda is also tra-
ditionally thought to have been the
guru of many northern Indian bhakti
figures, most notably Kabir, Ravidas,
Pipa, and Sen, although on this matter
too there is little hard historical evidence.
[[553]]
Ramanand Sagar
All of the stories about Ramananda,
however, point to someone who was
firm in his commitment to devotion and
was willing to initiate people from all
walks of society.
The tutelary deity for the Ramanandi
ascetics is Rama, particularly as described
in the Ramcharitmanas, a vernacular ver-
sion of the epic Ramayana written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?).
Tulsidas portrays Rama as God incar-
nate, come to earth for the benefit of his
devotees, and the text’s primary theme
is on the power of devotion. Yet within
the larger confines of the Ramanandi
fold there are several distinct variations
on practice, which have little or nothing
in common with one another. One
strand is that of the tyagis, who stress
renunciation and asceticism. A second
strand is that of the Nagas, who in earli-
er times were fighting ascetics but
whose military organization is now
important only during the bathing
(snana) processions for the Kumbha
Mela. The final strand is that of the
rasiks (“aesthetes”), whose religious
practice is based on highly complex
patterns of visualization in which they
imagine themselves as present in the
court of Rama itself; this sort of visual-
ization was undoubtedly imitated
from the patterns of Krishna devotion
as practiced in the Braj region. The
rasik tradition is by far the most liter-
ate and sophisticated; the tyagis and
the Nagas perform similar sorts of rites
as other ascetics, although their inter-
pretation and their chosen deity is
unique to their order. For further
information see Peter van der Veer,
Gods on Earth, 1988.
Ramanand Sagar
Director of the televised production of
the Ramayana, which was completed in
the late 1980s. The episodes were aired
each Sunday morning for about a year,
and were wildly successful despite prob-
lems with production quality. (Some of
these problems undoubtedly derived
from the difficulties of preserving the
[[554]]

immediacy of the oral experience of
traditional storytelling in the modern
medium of television.) In the mid-
[[1990]]
s Sagar devoted his attention to
other mythological television serials,
with an extended series on the life of
the god Krishna.
Ramanuja
(11th c.) Southern Indian philosopher
who was the greatest exponent of the
philosophical position known as
Vishishthadvaita (“qualified nondual-
ism”) Vedanta, and the most important
figure in the Shrivaishnava religious
community. Ramanuja lived most of his
life at the temple-town of Shrirangam
in the state of Tamil Nadu, in service of
the temple’s resident deity, Ranganatha,
a form of Vishnu. Ramanuja was con-
vinced that Brahman, or Supreme
Reality, was a personal deity rather than
an impersonal abstract principle, and he
was also convinced that devotion
(bhakti) was the most important form of
religious practice. Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, his philosophical position,
stressed both of these convictions.
According to Ramanuja, in his essential
nature God is completely transcendent
and free from imperfections. The world
develops from God through a process of
evolution, an idea adapted from the
Samkhya philosophical school. The
world is thus similar to God, since it
proceeds from him, but also different,
since matter is unconscious and
insentient. In the same way, human
beings are similar in nature to God,
because they have him as their source,
though unlike God they are subject to
ignorance and suffering. For Ramanuja
and his followers, God is not identical
to human selves or to the world, all of
which are perceived as having real and
independent existence. The differ-
ences in capacity between God and
human beings makes devotion the
most effective means to gain final lib-
eration (moksha) of the soul, a libera-
tion that is conceived of as eternal
communion with God. For furtherRamayana
information see Sarvepalli Radha-
krishnan and Charles A. Moore (eds.), A
Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, 1957;
and John B. Carman, The Theology of
Ramanuja, 1974.
Ramavali
(“Series [of poems] to Rama”) A series of
[[330]]
 short poems dedicated to the god
Rama, written in the Braj Bhasha form
of Hindi by the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?). The Ramavali is one of
Tulsidas’ longest extant works—shorter
only than the Ramcharitmanas. The
seven sections in the Ramavali parallel
the structure of the Ramayana, but dif-
fering sections receive unequal empha-
sis. Tulsidas gives his greatest attention
to Rama’s childhood and paints lyrical
images of the child Rama’s divine play
(lila). Here Tulsidas clearly borrows
from devotional poetry to the god
Krishna, in which such childhood
images are well established. Yet the
Ramavali’s portrayal of Rama de-
emphasizes the mischievous qualities
associated with Krishna, to stress
instead the generally milder nature of
Rama, and to highlight the devotee’s
(bhakta) quiet delight in sharing his
divine presence.
Ramayana
One of the two great Sanskrit epics, tra-
ditionally ascribed to the mythical sage
Valmiki. The Ramayana is much shorter
than the other great epic, the
Mahabharata, and in many ways is a
less complex work. The Ramayana’s text
was composed later than the core story
of the Mahabharata, but the
Mahabharata’s final recension was
compiled after the Ramayana had been
fixed. The Mahabharata is the story of
an “evil” royal family for whom greed
and power-mongering ultimately lead
to destruction. In contrast, the
Ramayana is the tale of a “good” royal
family, and many of the epic’s characters
are symbols of established Indian family
values: Rama is the perfect son and the
virtuous king, Lakshmana and Bharata
his ideal younger brothers, and Sita the
model wife. Despite this, the story is not
without some troubling moral issues,
particularly connected with Rama’s
treatment of Sita.
The story has been altered some-
what over the years, with the most
important change being the elevation
of Rama to divine status as an avatar or
incarnation of the god Vishnu. The ear-
liest Ramayana, attributed to the sage
Valmiki, mentions Rama’s divinity only
in the first and last books, whereas in
other portions of the poem he is
described merely as a great hero. Given
the position of these references to
divinity, scholars speculate that they
could easily have been added to the
original core story of exile, abduction,
and revenge.
The text of the Ramayana is divided
into seven sections (khandas), each of
which has a different focus. In the open-
ing section, the Balakhanda (“childhood
section”), the text describes the birth of
Rama and his brothers (Lakshmana,
Bharata, and Shatrughna) to King
Dasharatha, and their lives as young
princes. Rama and his brothers take part
in an archery contest, sponsored by
King Janaka, at which Rama’s prowess
as an archer wins the hand of Janaka’s
daughter Sita. They are married and live
happily at Dasharatha’s court.
The Ayodhyakhanda (“Ayodhya sec-
tion”) tells how Dasharatha makes
preparations to anoint Rama as his suc-
cessor but how, on the night before the
ceremony, these plans are spoiled by
Rama’s stepmother Kaikeyi. Many years
before, Kaikeyi receives the offer of two
favors from Dasharatha, which she has
never used. At the suggestion of her
hunchback maid Manthara, Kaikeyi
demands of Dasharatha that Rama be
banished to the forest for fourteen years,
and that her son Bharata be crowned in
his place. This disaster seems grounded
in malice but is presented as the culmi-
nation of a curse placed on Dasharatha,
which predicts he will die bereft of his
sons. When informed of his stepmother’s

wish, Rama immediately prepares to
leave, refusing to seize the throne by
force, and Sita and Lakshmana
announce their intention to accompany
him. Bharata is put on the throne but
only as a regent in Rama’s place, and the
heart-broken Dasharatha dies of grief.
In the Aranyakhanda (“Forest sec-
tion”), Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita settle
into life in forest exile. Rama and
Lakshmana kill many of the demons
(rakshasas) who plague the forest-
dwellers, thus bringing peace to the
area. One day the female demon
Shurpanakha comes to their dwelling,
is smitten by the two young men, and
asks them to marry her. The brothers
first mock her, then mutilate her by cut-
ting off her ears and nose. Shurpanakha
goes to her brother Ravana, the demon-
king of Lanka, and demands revenge for
the attack. When frontal assaults fail,
Ravana commands his uncle Maricha to
assume the form of a golden deer in
order to lure Rama away from his hut. At
Sita’s behest, Rama pursues the deer
after giving Lakshmana strict orders not
to leave Sita’s side. Rama slays the deer,
which with its dying breath calls out
Lakshmana’s name in a voice that mim-
ics Rama’s. Sita hears the call and flies
into a rage when Lakshmana refuses to
leave her. She finally drives him off, in
an uncharacteristic show of temper, by
accusing him of neglecting his brother
in a time of peril so that he can have Sita
to himself. When Lakshmana departs,
Ravana comes to Sita disguised as a
mendicant ascetic. He lures her out of a
protective magic circle that Lakshmana
has drawn around her, then kidnaps her.
Ravana’s escape is briefly delayed by a
virtuous vulture named Jatayu, who
attempts to rescue Sita. In the ensuing
combat Jatayu is mortally wounded, but
he lives long enough for Rama and
Lakshmana to find him and learn the
identity of Sita’s abductor.
The Kishkindhakhanda (“Kishkindha
section”) narrates Rama’s and Laksh-
mana’s trip south to the Kishkindha
forest. There they become allies with
the monkey-king Sugriva, whose lost
kingdom Rama helps to regain by slay-
ing Sugriva’s brother Bali. After enjoy-
ing the spoils of kingship, Sugriva and
his monkey subjects, particularly his
lieutenant Hanuman, begin searching
throughout the country for any trace
of Sita. Hanuman decides to leap over
the sea, to Lanka, to see if he can find
her there.
The Sundarakhanda (“Beautiful sec-
tion”) begins with Hanuman leaping the
sea to Lanka and describes how, after
much searching, he finally manages to
locate Sita. Meanwhile, Ravana unsuc-
cessfully tries to convince Sita to accept
him as her husband. The demon’s
actions are motivated by his desire
to avoid a curse, which states that he
will drop dead if he ever rapes a woman
who resists him. Hanuman reassures
Sita that all will be well, and after
many adventures makes his way back
to Rama, to inform him that Sita has
been found.
The Lankakhanda (“Lanka section”)
describes the beginning of a war
between the forces of Rama and Ravana.
Aided by armies of monkeys and bears,
Rama builds a causeway across the sea
to Lanka and begins to besiege the city.
In his struggle he is helped by Ravana’s
youngest brother Vibhishana, who
opposes Ravana’s evil deeds and casts in
his lot with Rama. Ravana is assisted by
his brother Kumbhakarna and his son
Indrajit, but in the end Ravana and his
demon allies are killed in battle. After
being rescued, Sita undergoes a trial by
fire to prove her chastity, and when the
fire refuses to burn her, she is shown to
have been completely faithful to Rama.
They return in triumph to Ayodhya,
where Bharata renounces the throne,
and the couple rule happily.
In the “Final section” (Uttarakhanda),
which was almost certainly added later,
Rama has further doubts about Sita’s
virtue. While roaming the capital one
night, he hears a washerman abusing
his wife for staying out all night. The
washerman says that he is not as big a
fool as their king. Rama is troubled by
this and, although he is supposedly
[[557]]
Rambha Ekadashi
convinced of Sita’s innocence, sends her
into exile to please his subjects—here
showing a distrust uncharacteristic of a
figure who supposedly represents the
epitome of virtue. While in exile, Sita
gives birth to twin sons, Lava and
Kusha, whose prowess makes them
known to Rama, and they are eventually
acknowledged as his heirs. Yet after all
her suffering, Sita is not amenable to
reconciliation. As a final proof she calls
on her mother, the Earth, to bear wit-
ness to her virtue, and as a sign that this
is true Sita sinks beneath the earth,
never to be seen again. Soon after, Rama
himself leaves his body and takes again
his true form as Vishnu.
The Ramayana has been an extremely
influential text, primarily because of the
social virtues modeled by its characters.
The epic is known throughout the sub-
continent, and its popularity can be
seen by its numerous retellings in ver-
nacular languages, of which the most
famous are the Tamil Ramayana of
the poet Kamban (9th c.), and the
Ramcharitmanas
of
the
poet-
saint Tulsidas (17th c.). The epic
continues to be a prominent text in
the modern day, as witnessed by its
astounding popularity as a weekly tele-
vision serial produced in the mid-1980s
under the direction of Ramanand
Sagar. The Valmiki Ramayana has been
translated numerous times, the most
recent partial translation of the work is
by Robert Goldman and Sheldon
Pollack. See also Tamil epics.
Rambha Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). As with all
the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of the god
Vishnu, on this particular day in his
form as Krishna. As with most Hindu
festivals, Rambha Ekadashi requires that
certain rites be performed. These rites
involve fasting (upavasa) and worship,
and promise specific benefits for faithful
[[558]]

performance. This ceremony is named
after Rambha, a famous apsara or celes-
tial damsel. Its charter myth tells how, by
faithfully observing this rite, a certain
king was born in heaven and served by
Rambha and other apsaras.
Ramcharitmanas
(“Holy Lake of Rama’s Deeds”) Vernacular
retelling of the Ramayana, the earlier of
the two great Sanskrit epics. The
Ramcharitmanas was written by the
poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623), in the
language known as Avadhi, an eastern
variant of medieval Hindi. Evidence
indicates that Tulsidas began the text
in Ayodhya in 1574. At nearly 10,000
lines, this text is by far his longest work
and is generally considered to be his
greatest. For the most part the poem is
structured in groups of six to eight
verses written in the chaupai form, fol-
lowed by a verse in the shorter doha
form. (The doha verse either sums up
the essence of the preceding chaupai
verses or serves to foreshadow later
developments.) There are also verses
written in longer meters such as
savaiya, as well as invocations in fluid
Sanskrit poetry at the beginning of
each of the seven sections. Tulsidas
was a masterful epic poet, as evi-
denced both by the sheer size of his
text and the high poetic quality of the
verses contained in it.
As with all the Ramayana’s vernacu-
lar retellings, Tulsidas did not merely
translate the story of Rama but inter-
preted it according to his own religious
convictions. His two most important
changes to the poem are the over-
whelming emphasis on the importance
of devotion (bhakti), and the saving
power of the name of Rama, to which
Tulsidas gives greater importance than
Rama himself. Tulsidas also includes
mythic material from a variety of other
sources, most notably the Shiva Purana
and the Adhyatmaramayana. This
material is largely added to the first and
last chapters, in which Tulsidas makes
his greatest changes from the originalRameshvar
epic. One theory to explain why Tulsidas
brought in this other material argues
that he endeavored to transcend narrow
sectarian boundaries, for example, by
having the god Shiva narrate much of
the text in the form of a dialogue to his
wife Parvati. Later, in part of the final
book, Shiva is supplanted as narrator by
the crow Bhushundi, who symbolizes
the power of devotion to rescue even a
common carrion-eating crow.
The Ramcharitmanas has popularly
been called the “Bible of northern
India,” reflecting its enormous influence
on ordinary people’s piety. Although
according to legend Tulsidas faced some
opposition from brahmins who thought
it sacrilegious to translate the Ramayana
into a vernacular tongue, the text has
been immensely popular with ordinary
people. Even now there are many people
who can recite large sections from
memory (“discourses” (katha) on the
text can draw hundreds or thousands
of people) and many of the verses have
become proverbial expressions in
modern Hindi. Aside from reading or
hearing the text, millions of people see
it each autumn, in the dramatic pre-
sentation known as the Ram Lila. The
oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,
held at Ramnagar in Benares, uses the
text from the Ramcharitmanas, and
takes great pride in this traditionalism.
For further information see Philip
Lutgendorf, The Life of a Text, 1991.
Ramdev
(1404–58) According to legend, a Rajput
prince whose piety and ability to per-
form miracles won him renown during
his lifetime, and who was considered an
incarnation of the god Krishna after his
death. His tomb in the village of
Ramdevra, east of the city of Jaisalmer
in the western part of the state of
Rajasthan, has become a pilgrimage site
for devotees (bhakta) who come seeking
various favors. Little is known about
Ramdev’s life, and unlike many of the
other medieval saints, he has no poetry
or body of literature attributed to him,
nor did he serve as the leader of any
organized religious community. His
original followers came to him because
he was able to meet their needs, and for
this reason pilgrims come to him still.
Ramdevra
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
northwest corner of the state of
Rajasthan, about sixty miles east of the
city of Jaisalmer. Ramdevra is famous for
the grave of the fifteenth-century saint
Ramdev, as well as the grave of his low-
caste disciple Dadi Bhai. During his life-
time Ramdev was famous for his piety
and generosity, and was credited with
performing various miracles to aid those
in need. Since his death he has come to
be regarded as an incarnation of the god
Krishna. Although pilgrims can come
throughout the year, most come during
the annual religious fair (mela), at which
time the near-deserted town takes on
the semblance of a bustling city. Many
of the visitors come to ask Ramdev
for something, often related to
concerns over health or prosperity.
Others come to show gratitude, espe-
cially those whose past wishes have
been granted, and to maintain their
relationship with him.
Rameshvar
Manifestation of the god Shiva, in his
form as “Rama’s Lord” at Rameshvaram
in the state of Tamil Nadu. The image of
Rameshvar at this site is a linga, a pillar-
shaped object said to represent Shiva’s
symbolic form. The Rameshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy
and powerful, and at which Shiva is
thought to be uniquely present. The
site’s mythic charter is drawn from the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two
Sanskrit epics. According to tradition,
Shiva is worshiped here by the god
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, although
there are differing accounts of when this
happened. In some stories, it is to gain
Shiva’s blessing immediately before
[[559]]
Rameshvaram
Rama’s attack on the demon kingdom of
Lanka. In other accounts the worship
comes after the conquest of Lanka, as a
rite of thanksgiving. In either case, both
sets of stories portray Rama as a devotee
(bhakta) of Shiva and thus buttress
Shiva’s status as the greatest god of all.
Rameshvaram
(“Rama’s Lord”) Sacred site (tirtha) on
an island off the coast of the state of
Tamil Nadu in the Palk Strait, which sep-
arates Sri Lanka from the mainland.
Rameshvaram is one of the most impor-
tant sacred sites in India, for several dif-
ferent reasons. It is one of the four
dhams associated with the philosopher
Shankaracharya, which mark the geo-
graphical boundaries of the subconti-
nent. It also has specific mythic
associations that make it holy both to
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva and Vishnu,
two of the most important Hindu
deities. For Shiva’s devotees, the pillar-
shaped image (linga) of Shiva there rep-
resents the god in his manifestation as
Rameshvar (“Rama’s Lord”). This image
is also one of the jyotirlingas, a network
of twelve lingas deemed especially holy
and powerful, and at which Shiva is said
to be uniquely present. For Vishnu’s
worshipers, Rameshvaram is held to be
the place from which the god Rama
staged his attack on the demon king-
dom of Lanka. According to tradition,
upon Rama’s return with his rescued
wife Sita, the image of Rameshvaram
was consecrated in gratitude for his suc-
cess. Rameshvaram also has very old
connections with the sacred city of
Benares, and even today pilgrims come
from there bearing Ganges water to
offer to Shiva.
Ramgarh
Architectural site in the Vindhya Hills,
[[160]]
 miles south of Benares. An inscrip-
tion in one of the caves at Ramgarh,
estimated to be from the third
century B.C.E., contains the earliest
datable reference to devadasis, a
[[560]]

special class of women who served the
deities of certain temples.
Ram Janam Bhumi
Site in the city of Ayodhya, where some
claim the god Rama was born; since the
early 1980s this spot has witnessed some
of India’s most intense postindepen-
dence religious conflict. The site has
long been a source of controversy
between the Hindu and Muslim com-
munities, and British sources record
hostilities there in 1855 and 1934. Until
[[1992]]
 Ram Janam Bhumi was occupied
by the Babri Masjid, a mosque con-
structed in 1528 by command of Mir
Baqi, a general of the Moghul emperor
Babar (1483–1530). Local tradition holds
that the mosque was built after the raz-
ing of an existing Hindu temple there,
although there is little evidence for this
claim. A few months after India gained
independence in 1947, several local
Hindus secretly installed images of the
child Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother
Lakshmana in the mosque, claiming
that the images had miraculously
appeared in a ball of light. The govern-
ment, having only recently quieted the
Hindu-Muslim massacres that accom-
panied the partition of British India into
India and Pakistan, was loath to ignite
religious passions, and its solution,
therefore, was to padlock the com-
pound’s gates and send the case to the
courts for resolution, where it lan-
guished for almost forty years.
The early 1980s saw renewed contro-
versy over the site, when the Vishva
Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu nation-
alist organization, first began calling for
the site’s “liberation,” proclaiming that
the existing mosque was an insult to all
Hindus. The VHP’s campaign portrayed
the mosque as a symbol of Muslim icon-
oclasm and depicted government efforts
to protect it as an attempt to appease
the Muslim community and retain their
votes. In 1986, the VHP’s drive to liberate
the site was aided by Rajiv Gandhi’s
national government. Together, the VHP
and the Gandhi administrationRam Lila

succeeded in unlocking the com-
pound’s gates so that Hindus could
worship there, though observers called
the action a clear bid to attract the
Hindu vote.
Pressure throughout the 1980s, cul-
minated in a series of campaigns to
begin construction of a new temple at
Ram Janam Bhumi. Many of these cam-
paigns coincided with national elec-
tions, and the emotion that they
generated boosted the electoral fortunes
of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a
political group with close links to the
VHP. The final campaign came on
December 6, 1992, a day that was sched-
uled to have “symbolic” meaning, and
ended a little over five hours later with
the mosque’s demolition. The whole
operation was carefully planned—
demolition crews ordered the destruc-
tion of all television cameras prior to
leveling the building in order to prevent
any media coverage by outsiders. The
razing was also carried out with the
blessing of the BJP-led state government,
which made no attempt to protect the
temple. Riots ensued, particularly in the
city of Bombay, where over three
thousand people were killed, most of
them Muslims.
Even after the destruction of the
Babri Masjid, the site remained an area
of contention between Muslims and
Hindus. Immediately after the demoli-
tion, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
promised to rebuild the mosque but did
nothing to accomplish this during the
next five years he was in office.
Meanwhile, various Hindu groups have
been calling for the construction of a
Ram Janam Bhumi temple, including
traditional religious leaders such as the
Shankaracharyas. Seeing nothing but
trouble ahead, the government again
sent the matter to the courts for resolu-
tion, where it remains to this day and
may remain for decades to come. For
further information see Christophe
Jaffrelot, The Hindu Nationalist
Movement in India, 1996.
Ram Lila
Any public dramatic presentation of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. The epic’s basic plot
[[561]]
Ramnagar
revolves around the unjust exile of the
god-king Rama; the abduction of
Rama’s wife Sita by Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka; and Rama’s
search to regain Sita, a struggle that
ultimately ends in Ravana’s death. Ram
Lilas are prominent during the autumn
in northern India, and usually corre-
spond with the festival of Dussehra
(October–November), which celebrates
Rama’s victory over Ravana and thus the
symbolic triumph of good over evil. Late
in the nineteenth century the Ram Lilas
were important symbolic vehicles for
demonstrating pride in Indian culture.
Additionally, they were considered a
coded symbol of resistance to British
rule. Today, Ram Lilas can be found
throughout northern India in many of
the larger cities, while neighborhood
associations often sponsor their own
local productions.
The longest, most elaborate, and
arguably the oldest Ram Lila is held at
Ramnagar, the fortified town where the
kings of Benares reside. The Ramnagar
Ram Lila was begun in the early nine-
teenth century, during the reign of Udit
Narayan Singh, and the Maharaja of
Benares still plays an important symbolic
role in the production even though he
no longer wields temporal power over
the city. It lasts for thirty-one days, dur-
ing which the action moves to different
places in and around Ramnagar.
Thousands of faithful viewers follow the
drama for the entire month, but on peak
days the audience can reach 100,000.
For further information on the Ram Lila,
see Norvin Hein, The Miracle Plays of
Mathura, 1972; and Anaradha Kapur,
Actors, Pilgrims, Kings, and Gods, 1990.
Ramnagar
Fortified city just south and across the
Ganges from the sacred city of Benares
in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The
Maharajas of Benares built their fort on
this site because it was relatively easy to
defend, and continue to live there,
although they no longer possess ruling
power. Ramnagar is famous as the site of
[[562]]

the oldest and most traditional Ram Lila,
a production of the epic Ramayana
dramatized in a month of nightly
shows. Aside from sponsoring this Ram
Lila and underwriting its costs, the
royal family also continues to play an
important symbolic role in the produc-
tion itself. For further information see
Anuradha Kapur, Actors, Pilgrims,
Kings, and Gods, 1990.
Ram Navami
Festival celebrated on the ninth day of
the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April). Ram
Navami is celebrated as the birthday of
the god Rama, the seventh avatar of the
god Vishnu, and this festival also ends
the spring Navaratri festival of the
Goddess. The Goddess festival of
Navaratri, observed twice yearly in the
spring and in the fall, ends each time
with a celebration for Rama. The reason
for this festival sequence is not entirely
clear but probably reflects cultural
imperatives to contain the explosive but
uncontrolled fertile feminine energy
personified by the Goddess with the sta-
ble and predictable masculine energy of
Rama. Ram Navami is widely celebrated
across India, but especially in Ayodhya,
the city traditionally deemed his birth-
place. In their celebrations, devotees
(bhakta) may worship in their homes,
fast (upavasa), attend religious dis-
courses (katha), or go to temples for
darshan and worship. With the recent
growth of Hindutva (militant, politi-
cized Hinduism) this holiday has
become a day for large demonstrations
and political action. This has been
particularly true in Ayodhya, where the
continuing struggle to build the Ram
Janam Bhumi temple at the site of
Rama’s birthplace has made this day
particularly significant.
Ramprasad
(early 19th c.) Bengali poet-saint and
devotee (bhakta) of the goddess Kali,
who is justly renowned for the powerRam Rasik Sampraday
and expressive quality of his poems. As
with many of the devotional (bhakti)
figures, little is definitely known about
his life. According to tradition, he
worked for a short time as a clerk before
his indulgent employer, finding him
spending his days composing poetry to
Kali, became his literary patron to allow
him to write full time. Ramprasad’s
poetry invokes the Goddess in many of
her different personae—as the goddesses
Uma, Durga, and Bhairavi—but the
majority of his poems are addressed to
Kali. Despite Kali’s fearsome qualities,
Ramprasad persistently addresses her as
“mother,” and, like a child, clings to her
despite all her attempts to discourage
him. The end result is that his unflinch-
ing and unquestioning devotion to Kali
removes all fear and brings him libera-
tion. For further reading, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975;

(trans.), Grace and Mercy in Her Wild
Hair, 1999.
Ram Rajya Parishad
(“Organization for Ram’s Reign”)
Northern Indian political party formed
immediately after Indian independence
in 1947. It was founded by Swami
Karpatri, an influential modern Hindu
ascetic. The term Ram Rajya carries
mythical significance, referring to the
period of righteous rule by the god-king
Rama, the protagonist of the epic
Ramayana, after his return from four-
teen years of exile in the forest.
According to popular belief, Rama’s
reign was marked by perfect peace, jus-
tice, and social harmony.
The Ram Rajya Parishad sought to
reshape India according to the vision of
this mythical time, and the party’s polit-
ical platform was solidly rooted in con-
servative Hindu religious ideas. The
party strongly supported the caste sys-
tem, with its traditional division of
social status and labor, and believed that
it was essential for a smoothly function-
ing society. This position would have
condemned most low-caste people to a
life of servitude, although the party did
leave them a few meager windows for
advancement. One of these was manag-
ing shoe factories, since leather is con-
sidered religiously impure by the higher
castes, and thus working with leather is
the traditional occupation of certain low
status groups. Aside from their views on
the validity of the caste system, the Ram
Rajya Parishad also supported other
conservative Hindu causes, particularly
a total ban on cow slaughter and a com-
plete ban on the production and con-
sumption of liquor. The Ram Rajya
Parishad’s constituency came mainly
from conservative, upper-class Hindus,
particularly those in the Ganges River
basin. Its conservatism gave those out-
side this group no incentive to support
it. Although it had limited electoral suc-
cess in years immediately after indepen-
dence, within a dozen years the party
had been reduced to a completely mar-
ginal presence.
Ram Rasik Sampraday
Religious lineage among the Ramanandis,
a community of renunciant ascetics. All
Ramanandis are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Rama, but members of the
Ram Rasik Sampraday stress the wor-
ship of Rama and his wife Sita as the
divine couple. They focus their wor-
ship on the time of domestic bliss
when the newly married couple lived in
Ayodhya, before Rama’s unjust banish-
ment from that city. Rasik (“aesthete”)
devotion involves complex forms of
visualization, in which devotees imag-
ine themselves to be servants and com-
panions of Rama and Sita, and spend
their days in service to the divine cou-
ple. Rasik devotees also draw up exact-
ing “schedules” of the deities’ daily
routines—in some cases, down to the
quarter-hour—so that through this
imaginative exaltation they can savor
the bliss of being God’s companions.
(This form of dedication is clearly influ-
enced by devotional patterns to the god
Krishna, particularly the divine rever-
ence found in the Gaudiya Vaishnava
[[563]]
Ramsnehi
religious community.) Because Rasik
worship is complex and highly devel-
oped, it has remained an elite phenom-
enon largely confined to a small
group of ascetics. For further informa-
tion see Peter van der Veer, Gods on
Earth, 1988; and Philip Lutgendorf,
The Life of a Text, 1991.
Ramsnehi
Renunciant ascetic community made
up of devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu—in his form as the god Rama—
whose practice stresses the love (sneha)
of Rama. The Ramsnehis have three
main centers, all located in the state of
Rajasthan. These centers are unique in
that each pays homage only to its own
founder, and no founder or preceptor is
honored by all three. Ramsnehi religious
practice focuses on the repetition of the
name of Rama, but has also been influ-
enced by the Jains. Because of this latter
influence the Ramsnehis voluntarily
take on many restrictions to avoid
destroying life.
Ranade, Mahadev Govind
(1842–1901) Lawyer, judge, and one of
the great Hindu social reformers of
nineteenth-century India. Along with
his younger contemporary, Gopal
Krishna Gokhale, Ranade was marked
by his commitment to reform Hindu life
by seeking the cooperation of the British
government and by working within
established institutions. Ranade was
among the first generation of Indians to
be educated in British schools and, after
earning his degree at Bombay
University, chose a career in law. In thirty
years as a judge Ranade worked dili-
gently to reform certain religious prac-
tices that were deemed social abuses,
particularly issues concerning child
marriage and widow remarriage. He was
also a founding member of the
Prarthana Samaj, a Hindu reformist
organization that sought to attain simi-
lar goals. In addition to his interests in
law, Ranade applied himself to the study
[[564]]

of economics, to provide practical guid-
ance for economic development.
Ranganatha
(“the rocking lord”) A particular form of
the god Vishnu, in which the god is
depicted as sleeping on the back of
his serpent couch, Shesha, floating in
the sea of cosmic dissolution (pralaya).
The most famous example of this image
is housed in the Ranganathaswamy
temple in Shrirangam, in the state of
Tamil Nadu.
Rasa
(“tastes”) In Indian aesthetics, the nine
moods that can be generated in an audi-
ence by various types of artistic expres-
sion: erotic, comic, compassionate,
cruel, heroic, terrifying, loathsome,
marvelous, and peaceful. These nine
rasas correspond to the nine bhavas
(“states”): sexual excitement, laughter,
grief, anger, energy, fear, loathing, won-
der, and peace. The nine bhavas are
considered to be the most basic unadult-
erated emotions, and although each of
the rasas corresponds to one of the
bhavas, there is an important difference.
Human emotive states come and go in
response to circumstances largely
beyond our control. Such emotive states
often cannot be sustained, and they are
generally not objects of aesthetic satis-
faction. The case is very different for an
aesthetic mood (rasa), which can be sus-
tained, since it is artificially generated
through artistic expression. This
emphasis on creating and sustaining
such a mood for an audience is the
dominant goal of the performing arts in
the Hindu tradition.
Rasayana
(“method of essences”) Alchemical
school specializing in the use of certain
chemicals, particularly compounds
made from elemental mercury, in a
quest to transmute the body and render
it immortal. Some scholars have charac-
terized rasayana as the Buddhist schoolRashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
of alchemy, with the Hindu school
known as dhatuvada. The reported dif-
ference is that the latter relied solely on
the consumption of mercurials, whereas
the former used mercurials only to pro-
long life until the body could be trans-
muted through meditation, ritual, and
extramaterial means. Despite these dif-
fering conceptions of the end of the
process, the two schools overlap consid-
erably on many other points. Both also
probably draw from a common alchem-
ical tradition. For further information
see David Gordon White, The Alchemical
Body, 1996.
Rashtrakuta Dynasty
(8th–10th c.) Central Indian dynasty
whose core area was in the middle of
Maharashtra, and whose capital was
the Maharashtrian city of Achalpur. The
Rashtrakutas were originally vassals of
the Chalukya dynasty, but overthrew
them in the middle of the eighth century
and remained the premier power south
of the Vindhya Mountains until the
middle of the tenth century. The dynasty
directly ruled most of the modern states
of Maharashtra and Karnataka, along
with parts of the states of Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, but had vassal
states through the entire Deccan
plateau, southern India, and Ceylon.
Their hegemony ended in 973, when
they were overthrown by the later
Chalukya dynasty. The Rashtrakutas’
greatest monument is the Kailasanatha
temple at Ellora in the state of
Maharashtra, which was completed late
in the eighth century.
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
(“National Volunteer Corps,” hereafter
RSS ) Hindu nationalist organization
founded in 1925 by Dr. K. B.
Hedgewar. Since its inception the RSS
has ascribed to the ideals of Hindutva,
the notion that the Hindus are a
nation despite their regional, linguis-
tic, and cultural differences. The RSS
has historically characterized itself as
In their daily meetings, members of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh practice martial drills that
include sparring with sticks.
a cultural and character-building
organization and, for much of its exis-
tence, has shunned direct political
involvement, although it has exercised
considerable influence through its
many affiliated organizations.
RSS training stresses loyalty, obedi-
ence, discipline, and dedication to the
advancement of the Hindu nation, but
does not encourage the development of
independent thought. The heart of its
program are the daily meetings of its
neighborhood units known as shakhas
(“branches”). At these meetings mem-
bers, known as svayamsevaks (“volun-
teers”), spend part of their time playing
games, part of their time practicing mar-
tial drill—including sparring with
sticks—and part of their time discussing
and absorbing RSS ideals. The shakhas in
any given area are overseen by a full-
time RSS worker known as a pracharak
(“director”), who serves as a liaison
between the local units and the RSS lead-
ership and who oversees RSS activity in
his area.
As an organization, the RSS is pro-
foundly elitist, and its self-proclaimed
[[565]]
Rasik
mission is to provide leadership for a
renascent Hindu India. Most of its
members will never advance beyond
the local level, but those who do are
generally remarkably efficient, effective
leaders. Although the RSS has shunned
direct activism that would tarnish its
self-proclaimed cultural emphasis, it
has exercised considerable influence
through the formation of affiliated orga-
nizations, for which it has provided the
leadership cadre. These organizations
are spread throughout every level of
Indian society, from labor and student
unions to service organizations, reli-
gious organizations such as the Vishva
Hindu Parishad (VHP), and political par-
ties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Although the RSS has produced some
remarkably effective leaders, it has also
generated considerable controversy.
One reason is that it is a highly authori-
tarian organization, run on the model of
the Hindu joint family. All authority is
vested in a single supreme leader, the
sarsanghchalak, and proceeds down-
ward from there. In this way the RSS is
profoundly undemocratic, and many of
its opponents—particularly in the polit-
ical arena—have felt uneasy about hav-
ing it as the controlling hand behind
its affiliated organizations. Other
opponents have also worried about its
anti-Muslim and anti-Christian tone—
non-Hindus were not allowed to join the
organization until 1979—a tone rooted
in the organization’s Hindutva ideals. A
final reservation about the RSS comes on
social grounds. The RSS has long con-
demned untouchability, and has also
long asserted that caste distinctions did
not exist within its ranks—in keeping
with its Hindutva roots, it proclaims that
all its members are Hindus and Hindus
only. Nevertheless, critics have noted
that most RSS members come from
brahmin and other privileged castes,
and that all of its leaders have been
brahmins. These critics contend that
such public disavowal of caste distinc-
tions is a mask to perpetuate brahmin
control and to conceal whose interests
the RSS truly serves. For further informa-

Rasik
Person able to appreciate a developed
artistic mood (rasa); someone who is
cultured and sophisticated. In the con-
text of religious practice, the word refers
to a person who has transposed this
appreciation of aesthetic mood into a
devotional setting. Rasik devotees
(bhakta) would engage in elaborate
visualizations of their chosen divinity
and mentally accompany that divinity
during the day. These meditative visual-
izations were said to give the devotee a
sense of participation in the divine play
(lila) of God’s presence on earth and
thus sharpen his or her enjoyment of
it. The two religious communities that
laid the greatest stress on this ability
were the Pushti Marg and the Ram
Rasik Sampraday, whose objects of
devotion were the gods Krishna
and Rama, respectively. This type of
worship is almost exclusively focused
on these deities, or on other forms of
the god Vishnu.
Raskhan
(late 16th c.) Poet-saint and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna who was
born a Muslim, specifically a Pathan
(Afghan) and whose name may have
been Saiyid Ibrahim. According to leg-
end, Raskhan spent the early part of his
life in Delhi, where he became enam-
ored of a handsome boy. When the
object of his affections proved unattain-
able, he migrated to Brindavan, theRath Yatra
town where Krishna is said to have lived
as a child, and spent the rest of his life
sublimating that attraction through his
devotion to Krishna. The main themes
in his poetry are the attraction of the
cowherd women (gopis) to Krishna,
sparked by Krishna’s physical beauty
and, especially, the enthralling music
of his flute. With Raskhan one finds
a person who was a Muslim by birth
but who used images and attitudes
belonging to Hindu culture in an
absolutely genuine manner.
Ras Lila
In the mythology of the god Krishna, the
ras lila is the “circle dance” that Krishna
and his devotees (bhakta), the gopis,
perform on autumn nights on the shore
of the Yamuna River. In this dance—a
symbol of communion with the divine—
Krishna offers a form of himself to every
woman present, in order to convince
each one that God is paying attention to
her and to her alone.
Rat
An animal with a prominent place in at
least two religious contexts. On one
hand, the rat is famous as the animal
vehicle of the elephant-headed god
Ganesh, and reinforces Ganesh’s iden-
tity as the Lord of Obstacles. If Ganesh’s
elephant head represents his power to
remove obstacles by simply knocking
them aside, his rat vehicle shows a
stealthier approach. Rats are famous
for their ability to work their way
around obstacles, slipping through the
smallest cracks in granaries to get to
the grain inside. In their ability to slip
around and between obstructing
objects, they stand as a worthy comple-
ment to Ganesh’s power.
Rats are also important to the temple
of the goddess Karni Mata in the village
of Deshnok, in the state of Rajasthan.
The Karni Mata temple is inhabited by
thousands of rats, considered to be
Karni Mata’s sons and thus sacred ani-
mals. According to tradition, when the
rats die they are reborn as members of
the families that comprise the temple’s
hereditary servants, and thus the rats
and the temple priests are all members
of one extended family.
Rath Yatra
Festival falling on the second day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar month
of Ashadh ( June–July). The primary
deity worshiped in this festival is
Jagannath, who is considered a form of
the god Krishna. This festival is cele-
brated all over India but especially in the
sacred city of Puri, where the principal
temple of Jagannath is located. During
the festival in Puri, Jagannath, his brother
Balabhadra, and his sister Subhadra
are carried in procession through the
city’s main street to another temple
about a mile away. They stay in this
nearby temple for a week, and then
return to the Jagannath temple.
The deities are processed by their
devotees (bhakta) in three enormous
wooden chariots (rath), which the devo-
tees pull using long ropes. The largest of
the three, belonging to Jagannath, is
forty-five feet high, thirty-five feet broad
and wide, and travels on sixteen wheels
each seven feet high. The English word
“juggernaut” is a corruption of Jagannath,
and the connotation of a juggernaut as
an unstoppable force undoubtedly
derives from the momentum that these
carts attained once they began to
move. One of the staple fictions of
British colonial lore described Jagannath’s
frenzied devotees committing suicide
by throwing themselves under the
car’s wheels, so that they would die in
the sight of God. Despite such tales
being widely repeated, suicides of this
sort were extremely uncommon. Still,
there was some risk in pulling the
carts, since people losing their footing
in the massed crowd would be unable
to get up, and could potentially be
crushed by the wheels. For further
information see T. N. Madan (ed.),
Religion in India, 1991.

Rati
Relief sculpture of the demon king Ravana from Angkor, Cambodia. As the antagonist of the Hindu epic,
the Ramayana, Ravana acquires great magical powers, which he abuses until Rama kills him in battle.
Rati
(“pleasure,” particularly sexual pleasure)
The wife of Kama, god of love. Rati is
both Kama’s wife and his ally, reflecting
the way that sexual pleasure can both
accompany and amplify desire.
Ratri
Name of the goddess of Night. See Night,

Ravana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Ravana is the ten-
headed demon king of Lanka. To destroy
Ravana, the god Vishnu is born in his
incarnation as Rama. Ravana is a reincar-
nation of Vishnu’s gatekeeper Jaya, who
has been cursed by a sage to be reborn
three times as a demon and to be killed
by Vishnu each time. As a rakshasa, a
type of demon, Ravana possesses enor-
mous physical strength and various
magic powers. He augments these natur-
al abilities by performing intense physi-
cal asceticism (tapas), which in Indian
[[568]]

culture is widely believed to generate
spiritual power and bring boons from the
gods. When the god Brahma finally
appears and directs Ravana to choose his
boon, Ravana requests that he be able to
be killed by no one but a human being.
This seems to make him practically
immortal, since his powers are such that
no ordinary human will be able to harm
him, much less kill him. Ravana then pro-
ceeds to terrorize the gods, secure in the
knowledge that they will not be able to
harm him. He begins with his half-broth-
er, the minor deity Kubera, who loses his
home and all his possessions to Ravana.
Ravana’s virtual invulnerability goes
to his head, and the powerful demon
begins to disregard all rules of decency
and morality. He is particularly guilty of
molesting and abducting women, acts
which result in various curses being laid
upon him by his helpless victims, many
of them predicting his death. As a result
of one of these curses his sister
Shurpanakha is mutilated by Rama’s
brother Lakshmana. Ravana is deter-
mined to avenge this insult, and decides
that the best way will be to abductRavidas Jayanti
Rama’s wife Sita. Although his wife
Mandodari and his brothers rebuke him
for this act and advise him to return Sita
and make peace with Rama, Ravana
stubbornly refuses to listen. His inflated
pride and desire to avenge the insult to
his sister deafen his ears to their good
counsel, and he eventually pays for his
stubbornness with his life when Rama
kills him in battle.
As with all demons, Ravana is not
completely villainous by nature but
rather greatly powerful and greatly
flawed at the same time. According to
some stories he is a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva, and the hymn to the
dancing
Shiva
known
as
the
Shivatandava Stotra is often attributed
to Ravana.Given his low social status, Ravidas
was almost certainly illiterate. His poet-
ic songs were likely first transmitted
orally, though their personal appeal
made him one of the most popular sant
poets. The two oldest attested sources
of his work are the Adigranth, the scrip-
ture for the Sikh community, and the
Panchvani collections, compiled by the
Dadupanth. In modern India, Ravidas
has also served as a model for the
depressed classes; his followers call
themselves Ravidasis. For further
information see John Stratton Hawley
and Mark Juergensmeyer, Songs of
the Saints of India, 1988; and
Winand M. Callewaert and Peter
Freidlander (trans.), The Life and Works
of Raidas, 1992.
RavidasRavidasi
(ca. 1500) Sant poet-saint who lived his
life in the city of Benares and is tradi-
tionally believed to have been a younger
contemporary of the poet-saint Kabir.
The Sants were a loose group of central
and northern Indian poet-saints who
shared several general tendencies: stress
on individualized, interior religion lead-
ing to a personal experience of the
divine; disdain for external ritual, partic-
ularly image worship; faith in the power
of the divine Name; and a tendency to
ignore conventional caste distinctions.
Both tradition and references in his
poetry describe Ravidas as a leather
worker (chamar), a social group whose
contact with dead animals and their
skins rendered them untouchable. He is
believed to have supported himself by
his hereditary trade, and much of his
poetry speaks on issues of worldly birth
and status. He never denied the impor-
tance of heredity but ultimately felt that
his devotion to God had helped him to
transcend his birth and given him status
based on different criteria. His poetry
reflects this staunch personal faith, as
do his frequent warnings to his listeners
that life is short and difficult, and that
they should pay great attention to reli-
gious practice.Name taken by followers of the
untouchable poet-saint Ravidas. The
Ravidasis emphasize many ideas found
in the poetry of Ravidas, such as the
irrelevancy of ideas of purity and impu-
rity (ashaucha), the futility of trying to
contain the divine in texts and rites, and
his vision of a society in which all people
can have equal status, whatever their
background. It is unlikely that the
Ravidasis were established by Ravidas
himself, nor is Ravidas an object of wor-
ship for them, although he is held as a
model for religious equality, based on
the messages in his poetry. In modern
times the Ravidasis have focused on
opposing all sorts of caste-based
discrimination and have also taken
up the empowerment of various low-
caste groups. This movement is very
recent, and to date little has been
published about it; for some informa-
tion see the introduction to Ravidas in
John Stratton Hawley and Mark
Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs of the
Saints of India, 1988.
Ravidas Jayanti
Festival falling on the full moon
in the lunar month of Magh (January–
[[569]]
Rawal
February), celebrated as the birthday of
the medieval bhakti poet-saint Ravidas,
born near Benares. Ravidas’s birth into
the untouchable caste of leather work-
ers (chamar) afforded him a very low
social status. His poetry is set in a per-
sonal voice and contrasts this lowly sta-
tus with the honor and renown he
gained through his devotion to God. In
modern times many members of the
depressed classes see Ravidas as a
model, and his birthday is celebrated
with great fervor.
Rawal
Title given to the head priest (pujari) at
the temple of Badrinath in the
Himalayas. The Rawal is invariably a
Nambudiri brahmin, who must remain
unmarried to retain his position.
In Hindu belief, Badrinath is one of
the four dhams (“divine abodes”)
connected with the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Seeking to combat the
spread of Buddhism and revitalize
Hindu religion, Shankaracharya report-
edly chose one Hindu sacred center in
each corner of the subcontinent, and at
each established a Dashanami Sanyasi
monastic center (math) to train learned
monks. Badrinath is associated with
the Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath, forty miles south,
which is also the place where the deity
Badrinath is symbolically transported
for the winter.
According to Badrinath temple
records, for several hundred years the
position of head priest was filled by
Dandi Sanyasis, who were also
Nambudiri brahmins, the same caste
into which Shankaracharya is supposed
to have been born. When the last of
these died without a successor in 1776,
the local king who served as the protec-
tor of the shrine invited a non-ascetic
Nambudiri brahmin to serve as the tem-
ple’s priest. This priest was given the title
rawal (from the word raja, “deputy”),
and his extended family has run the
shrine since then. The rawal was the
only person allowed to touch the image
[[570]]

of Badrinath, and was responsible for
performing worship during the six
months that the temple is open.
Because of these duties, the rawal was
required to remain a bachelor, lest the
ritual impurity arising from the birth of
a child (sutakashaucha) render him
unable to attend to his duties. Until the
Badrinath Temple Act of 1939 estab-
lished a temple board as the ultimate
authority, the rawals had sole rights to
the offerings given at the shrine.
Rawat
A particular subgroup of the warrior
princes known as the Rajputs; the
Rawats’ major area of influence was in
southwestern Uttar Pradesh state.
Reciprocal Dependence
In Indian logic, one of the fallacies to
be avoided in constructing an argu-
ment. Reciprocal dependence occurs
when two things each stand as cause
and effect to the other—when A depends
on B, and B in turn depends on A. This
is seen as an extended case of self-
residence, and equally objectionable.
Reconversion
General name for the rites by which
people who have converted to other reli-
gious traditions are accepted back as
Hindus. See shuddhi.
Reflectionism
Theory used in later schools of Advaita
Vedanta to explain how one single pri-
mal ignorance could afflict multiple
ignorant selves. Reflectionism is rooted
in the idea of an image appearing in a
mirror; different from the original, it is
nonetheless based on it. In the same
way, according to this explanation, the
ignorance affecting each individual is
simply a reflection of a primal igno-
rance. For further information see Karl
H. Potter, Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.Reservations
Reincarnation
One of the fundamental assumptions of
Indian religious life. See samsara

Religious Persecution
In popular belief India is visualized as a
land of perfect religious tolerance in
which all schools of thought have been
allowed to grow unchecked. Although
true in its basic form, this picture is
greatly simplified. There is a long history
of competition between differing reli-
gious communities and schools of
thought, sometimes fueled by scathing
polemics designed to persuade listeners
that one was correct and the others
false. What has been quite rare, however,
are acts of violence accompanying these
arguments, or the notion that people
should have to fear for their lives
because of their ideas. In the literature
of the Nayanar and Lingayat communi-
ties—both devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva—language toward the Jains has a
genuinely hostile edge, and the Nayanar
leader Sambandar has been persistently
implicated in the impalement of 8,000
Jains in the southern Indian city of
Madurai. In the same way, the northern
Indian king Sashanka, who was also a
devotee of Shiva, harbored a pathologi-
cal hatred of Buddhists. Sashanka
reportedly not only persecuted
Buddhists themselves, but also tried
to destroy the tree in Bodh Gaya
under which the Buddha purportedly
gained enlightenment.
Sectarian competition aside, people
whose religious faith has led them to
ignore generally accepted social con-
ventions have been quite likely to
encounter stiff opposition. Stories of the
devotional (bhakti) poet-saints are
replete with tales of the troubles they
faced from guardians of conventional
morality, usually said to be brahmins. In
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
there was a running and often bloody
conflict between two groups of militant
ascetics—the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, and the Bairagi
Nagas—although in that case the
motives might just as well have been
economic, namely, the control of trade
in the Ganges valley. A final example of
religious persecution appears in the rise
of Hindutva in the 1980s. Propelled by
verbal attacks on Muslims and
Christians, this persecution has all too
often prompted physical violence.
Renuka
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the sage
Jamadagni and mother of the Para-
shuram avatar, the fifth avatar or incar-
nation of the god Vishnu.
Republic Day
Indian national holiday, falling on
January 26, that marks the day the
Indian constitution was adopted in
[[1950]]
. As a holiday connected with
Indian independence, it is one of the few
celebrated according to the common
calendar. Republic Day is comparable
to the Fourth of July in the United States
and is celebrated with massive parades
in India’s major cities. The largest occurs
in New Delhi—from which it is televised
to the rest of the nation—and includes
singers and performers from all over the
country, as well as large displays of mili-
tary hardware, including fly-overs by the
newest jet planes.
Reservations
Modern government policy designed to
rectify the long-standing economic and
social disadvantages faced by certain
poor or low-status groups by offering
them preferential treatment in employ-
ment and education. This is usually
done by setting aside, or “reserving,” for
such groups certain percentages of
[[571]]
Rg Veda
government jobs or places in institu-
tions of higher learning, which admit
people from disadvantaged communi-
ties under much lower standards than
those for the general public. Those
groups who qualify for such reservations
are generally referred to as Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, after the
“schedule” or official government list on
which the names of these groups
appear. The Scheduled Castes are low-
status caste Hindus, who in earlier times
would have been called untouchables,
while the Scheduled Tribes are aborigi-
nal peoples (adivasis), who mainly live
in central India.
Although the reservations policy has
been implemented for some time, it
remains a continual source of contro-
versy. Proponents claim that it is moving
socially disadvantaged people into
the mainstream of Indian life and help-
ing to correct centuries of injustice.
Opponents decry the fact that less-
qualified people are being deliberately
chosen, making a mockery of the notion
of merit. Critics also argue that the peo-
ple who benefit the most from such poli-
cies are the best-off members of such
communities—the so-called creamy
layer, designating their position at the
top—whereas the truly disadvantaged
remain in the same positions as they
have always been. Aside from the philo-
sophical debates about this policy, it has
had a recognizable impact on people’s
livelihoods. Such reservations have
made competition even more ferocious
for the remaining spots, and made
reservations a politically volatile issue.
Given the benefits derived from reserva-
tions, there has also been considerable
lobbying to include other, less-disad-
vantaged groups under its rubric, as a
way to spread benefits to other sectors
of Indian society.
Rg Veda
The oldest and most important of the
four Vedas, which are themselves the
most ancient and authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The Rg Veda is a group of
[[572]]

[[1]]
,028 hymns collected in ten books.
Judging by their content, the hymns
were clearly composed over a long period
of time, but the actual dates are the sub-
ject of sharp disagreement. Traditional
Hindus assert that the Vedas were not
composed either by God or by human
beings but, rather, simply heard by
ancient sages through their advanced
powers of perception, and then trans-
mitted orally from generation to gener-
ation. Because of their origin, the Vedas
thus belong to the class of religious texts
known as shruti (“heard”). Scholarly
consensus maintains that the Vedas
were begun in the earlier part of the
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps
[[1800]]
–1500 B.C.E., and were finished
somewhere around the end of the
second millennium B.C.E., perhaps
[[1200]]
–900. All these dates are highly
speculative, since the hymns themselves
have no internal evidence to allow pre-
cise dating, which has instead been
based primarily on a comparative study
of changes in the language of certain
Vedas. Some of the hymns, for example,
are thought to have been created rela-
tively later than others, both because
their language is less archaic and closer
to classical Sanskrit and because the
locations mentioned in them reflect a
broader geographical area.
Most of the hymns in the Rg Veda are
addressed to a particular deity. The pri-
mary deities are Indra, Agni, and Soma,
although Varuna is prominent in the
earliest hymns. It is generally accepted
that the hymns were chanted at sacri-
fices as a way to invoke these deities.
Evidence from the hymns themselves
describes these sacrifices as large public
rites, usually involving the slaughter of
animals, which were burned on a sacri-
ficial fire, and the preparation and con-
sumption of the mysterious beverage
soma. In this context, the Vedic hymns
reflect a body of sacred learning known
to only a small group of religious spe-
cialists. Accordingly, these hymns were
never meant for universal public dis-
semination, since all except twice-born
men were forbidden to hear them.Rishikesh
The Rg Veda’s tenth and final book
differs sharply from the preceding ones.
Its language is closer to classical
Sanskrit, and its content is far more
speculative than that of the earlier
books, hinting at a major conceptual
shift. This book features the famous
Creation Hymn (10.129), in which the
poet speculates on how the world came
to be, only to conclude that the answer
may be unknown even to the creator.
Another notable hymn in this book is
the Purusha Sukta (10.90), which
describes both the earth and human
society as the product of a primeval sac-
rifice. The former hymn foreshadows
the religious and cosmological specula-
tion found in the texts known as the
Upanishads. The latter, which contains
the first known articulation of the four
major social groups (varnas), along with
their symbolic functions, is distin-
guished as foreshadowing the later
dharma literature.
Rhythm, in Music
See tala.
Right Hand Tantra
Name for a type of tantra, a secret, ritu-
ally based religious practice. Certain
tantric rituals make use of substances
that are normally forbidden, such as
liquor and nonvegetarian food, in an
effort to unify the world by destroying all
conceptual dualities, including that
between sacred and forbidden. These
substances are used in their actual
forms in “left hand” (vamachara) tantric
ritual, and by substitution in “right
hand” (dakshinachara) tantric ritual.
See dakshinachara.
Rishabha
According to Jain tradition, Rishabha
was the founder of the Jains. He is con-
sidered the first of the Jain tirthankaras,
the founding figures in the Jain reli-
gious tradition. He is one of three Jain
tirthankaras who are mentioned in
the Yajur Veda, one of the earliest
The city of Rishikesh lies on the Ganges River.
It contains many ashrams and is a
popular place for ritual bathing.
Hindu religious texts. The figure most
often credited with developing the
teachings used by the Jains today is
Mahavira, who is considered the twenty-
fourth tirthankara.
Rishi
Common word to designate a sage, seer,
or inspired religious leader. It is most
often used to indicate religious figures of
the distant past, and is not usually
applied to contemporary figures.
Rishikesh
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayan foothills of the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Rishikesh lies about fifteen
miles up the Ganges River from the
sacred city of Haridwar. As with many
sites on the Ganges, Rishikesh is famous
primarily as a bathing (snana) place,
although it is also noted as a dwelling-
place for ascetics, particularly at the
ashrams in the area around Lakshman
Jhula. As a sacred site, Rishikesh is also
notable for having no single charter
myth. According to one story, this is the
place where the god Rama kills several
demons, enabling the sages to carry out
[[573]]
Rishi Panchami
their sacrifices undisturbed. Another
story names this as the place where
Rama does penance (prayashchitta) for
killing the demon-king Ravana. A third
story names Rishikesh as the site where
a sage named Raibhya receives a vision
of the god Vishnu. The most famous
temple in Rishikesh is named after
Rama’s brother Bharata.
Rishi Panchami
Festival falling on the fifth day
(panchami) of the light (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). This festival is
dedicated to the Seven Sages (rishi)
born of Brahma: Bhrgu, Pulastya,
Kratu, Pulaha, Marichi, Atri, and
Vasishtha. Worshiping these seven sages
on this day is said to bring prosperity
and happiness.
Rishyashringa
A sage in the Ramayana, the earlier
of the two great Indian epics. King
Dasharatha commissions Rishyashringa
to perform a great sacrifice, to enable
the king’s wives to conceive. At the con-
clusion of Rishyashringa’s sacrifice, a
shining figure emerges from the sacrifi-
cial fire, places a pot of milk-rice before
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to
his wives. Dasharatha divides the con-
tents among his wives Kausalya,
Kaikeyi, and Sumitra, and in due time
they all bear sons. Kausalya is the moth-
er of Rama, the Ramayana’s protagonist.
Kaikeyi is the mother of Bharata, and
Sumitra is the mother of Lakshmana
and Shatrughna.
Rites of Passage
General term for rites that recognize and
mark transitions in an individual life-
cycle, and that often signify a change of
state or status. See samskara.
Rites of Protection
For many Hindus, the world is a ritually
dangerous place. Certain hours, days,
[[574]]

and periods of the year are considered
inauspicious. At these times the very
tone of the cosmos is disagreeable and
all sorts of bad fortune can befall the
ignorant or the unwary. Rites of protec-
tion are used to counter these dangers,
as well as the problems of one’s past
karma, which can be diagnosed through
an inauspicious conjunction in one’s
birth horoscope (natal horoscope).
Some inauspicious times are unlucky
only for certain types of activities.
Potential misfortune can be avoided
simply by refraining from these activi-
ties. However, certain events that cannot
be avoided, such as eclipses, are also
believed inauspicious. In such cases,
one can prevent the negative effects of
inauspiciousness by transferring it to
another person, usually through the
medium of gifts (dana); giving gifts is
also the preferred means for getting rid
of inauspiciousness stemming from a
bad conjunction in one’s birth horo-
scope. People also safeguard themselves
by performing prayer and worship as
positive protective forces.
Inauspicious forces are also generat-
ed by human jealousy, greed, and
hatred, which can find their agency in
black magic, the evil eye (nazar), or
other sorts of witchcraft. Finally, some
Hindus believe there are a host of non-
human beings, such as spirits, ghosts,
and witches, who sometimes seek to
harm human beings through the exer-
cise of supernormal powers. Despite the
power and prevalence of all of these
malevolent forces, if one is aware and
careful of them there are ways to
counter them.
For problems stemming from human
malice, there are well-established solu-
tions. One is to avoid those people who
are considered inauspicious, such as
widows. Another strategy is to avoid
inciting people’s jealousy by never pro-
claiming one’s good fortune too openly,
praising a child too lavishly, or flaunting
one’s wealth too freely. In many cases,
people will counter potentially vulnera-
ble moments in the life cycle by various
protective rites. It is still common forRoy, Ram Mohan
people to wear talismans or amulets,
which are believed to protect the wearer.
Another common protective measure is
to carry iron, which is believed to render
the person carrying it impervious to
witchcraft. Young children will often
have a black smudge of lamp-black put
on their faces, to symbolically disfigure
them and take away the motive for jealousy.
Another protective strategy is to hang up
an object (such as a clay pot with a
painted face) intended to absorb all the
bad feelings, which is then discarded.

Daksha lays a curse on the Moon to lose
his luster. The curse is later modified so
that the moon will alternately wane and
wax, but that its disappearance will
never be final.
Rohini
(2) In Hindu mythology, birth mother of
Balarama, the god Krishna’s brother.
Balarama’s birth is unusual. After his
conception the fetus is magically trans-
ported from the womb of Devaki to that
of Rohini. This is done to protect him
from harm, as Devaki’s wicked uncle
Kamsa has already killed her first seven
children and will certainly do the same
to Balarama if she carries him to term.
Roy, Ram Mohan
Rock Edicts
Name for a set of inscriptions commis-
sioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka
(r. 269–32 B.C.E.). The inscriptions were
official pronouncements on royal policy,
and advice and instructions to his sub-
jects on a variety of topics, including
religious tolerance. In general, the rock
edicts were carved into large boulders or
rock faces in places that would have
been at the borders of the Mauryan
Empire, thus symbolically defining its
boundaries. The text was fairly consis-
tent throughout the empire, even
though different examples of these
edicts were found in widely separated
places. The other major class of Ashokan
inscriptions, the pillar edicts, were
inscribed on pillars of polished Chunar
sandstone and set up on the major
roads running through the empire,
where they would have been visible to
passersby. See also Maurya dynasty.
Rohini
In Hindu mythology, a daughter of the
demigod Daksha who, along with her
twenty-six sisters, is married to the
Moon. The Moon favors Rohini over all
her sisters, despite Daksha’s entreaties
to give them all equal time. In the end
(1774–1833) First major Indian propo-
nent of Hindu social and religious
reform, who founded the organization
Brahmo Samaj for this purpose. He
came from a wealthy Bengali family and
was a successful businessman and civil
servant. He moved to Calcutta in 1815,
at the time when the British were first
beginning to take serious notice of tradi-
tional Indian society, especially the
aspects they considered “evil.” Roy’s
reformist interests largely meshed with
that of the British. From an early age Roy
had rejected the practice of using images
in worship, perhaps through exposure
to Sufi ideas, and his first public crusade
was against such worship of gods and
goddesses. Like most Indian reformers,
Roy used Sanskrit texts selectively, and
for him the most important ones were
the speculative Upanishads, which
(under the influence of the English
Unitarians) he translated to reflect a
monotheism (belief in the existence of
only one God). In his later years he pro-
moted many different educational and
social works, but is especially known for
his opposition to sati, the custom of
burning a widow on her husband’s
funeral pyre. Although later seen as too
heavily influenced by the British, his
reinterpretation of the past provided a
[[575]]
Rta
model for others to use. For further con-
sideration see Robert D. Baird (ed.),
Religion in Modern India, 1998.
Rta
In the Vedas (the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu texts) rta is the cos-
mic order and regularity that allows the
rhythms of time and the seasons to
occur in orderly succession. According
to the texts, rta also had a moral dimen-
sion, which human beings had an oblig-
ation to support. One such moral
dimension was truth, which was seen
as upholding the cosmos, whereas its
opposite, anrta, came to signify false-
hood. The connection between natural
and moral world came through the
Vedic god Varuna, who was both
the guardian of rta and the deity who
punished untruth, usually by affliction
with dropsy.
Rtvij
In the Hindu sacred texts (Vedas), one
of the priests who officiated at sacri-
fices. The four chief priests at sacrifices
were the hotr, udgatr, adhvaryum,
and brahman.
Rudra
(“howler”) Fearsome deity who first
appears late in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, later identified
with the god Shiva. Several hymns in the
Rg Veda are dedicated to Rudra, where
he is identified with the storm-god
Indra, and the fire-god Agni. A more
developed picture of Rudra appears in
the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, one of
the later speculative texts known as the
Upanishads. In the third chapter
(adhyaya) of this text, Rudra is identified
as the ruling power in the universe and
the source and origin of the gods them-
selves. Rudra’s depiction in this upan-
ishad shows considerable ambivalence,
both mentioning the destructive arrows
that he bears and imploring him to
appear in a form that is auspicious
(shivam) and peaceful. This ambivalence
[[576]]

perhaps reflects the religious tension
associated with the figure of Shiva, who
was a deity outside the Vedic sacrificial
cult but was gradually absorbed into
established religion and is now one of
the primary Hindu deities.
Rudraksha
(“eye of Rudra”) The dried seed of the
tree Elaeocarpus ganitrus, which is con-
sidered sacred to the god Shiva.
Rudrakshas are often strung into gar-
lands and worn by Shiva’s devotees
(bhakta). The seed itself is round with a
knobby, pitted surface, with a natural
channel in the middle through which a
thread can easily be drawn. Each seed
also has natural longitudinal lines run-
ning from top to bottom, which divide
the seed into units known as “faces”
(mukhi). The most common rudrakshas
have five faces, but they can have up to
fourteen. Each differing number of faces
has been given a symbolic association
with a particular deity. The rarest form
is the ekmukhi rudraksha, which has no
faces at all and is considered to be a
manifestation of Shiva himself. This
rudraksha is so valuable that street sell-
ers routinely make counterfeit versions
by carving them out of wood. Another
rare form is the Gauri-Shankar, in
which two rudraksha seeds are longitu-
dinally joined; this is considered a
manifestation of Shiva and Shakti.
Aside from the number of “faces,” the
quality of rudrakshas is judged by their
color and size. The color runs from
reddish brown to a light brown, with the
former considered more desirable, while
the smaller sizes are preferable to the
larger ones.
Rudranath
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas in the
valley between the Mandakini and the
Alakananda rivers, about thirty miles from
the district headquarters at Chamoli. The
temple’s presiding deity is the god Shiva in
his manifestation as “Lord Rudra.”Rukmini
Rudranath is one of the Panchkedar, a
network of five sacred sites spread
throughout the Garhwal region; the other
four sites are Kedarnath, Kalpeshvar,
Tungnath, and Madmaheshvar. This net-
work of five sites is seen as a symbolic rep-
resentation of Shiva’s body, since Shiva is
believed to dwell in the Himalayas.
Rudranath is believed to be Shiva’s face.
Rudraprayag
Himalayan town and sacred site (tirtha)
at the junction of the Mandakini and
Alakananda rivers, two Himalayan tribu-
taries of the Ganges River. As with all the
other river junctions in the Garhwal
region, Rudraprayag is considered an
especially holy place for bathing (snana),
although the raging currents make it
dangerous. Above the junction of the
rivers is a temple to Shiva in his form as
Rudra. According to local tradition, this
marked the place where the sage Narada
performed physical asceticism (tapas) to
gain his skill as a bard. Shiva, pleased
with Narada’s efforts, instructed Narada
in music and remained at the spot.
Rudra Sampraday
One of the four branches (sampraday) of
the Bairagi Naga ascetics. The name
Bairagi denotes ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. The name
Naga describes a class of fighting ascetics
recruited to protect the other Bairagi
ascetics who, because they were saintly,
scholarly men, could not protect them-
selves. Bairagi Nagas were organized in
military fashion into different anis or
“armies.” Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century the Nagas’ primary occu-
pation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests. The Nagas lent money at
interest, engaged in trade, and often
owned large amounts of property. They
were particularly powerful in parts of the
country where the centralized govern-
ment had broken down. Their roles as
mercenaries and in trade have both large-
ly disappeared in contemporary times.
Rudraksha seed. Devotees of the god Shiva
often identify themselves by wearing
necklaces made of these seeds.
The Rudra Sampraday traces its spir-
itual lineage through the philosopher
Vallabhacharya and the earlier religious
teacher, Vishnuswami. The followers of
Vallabhacharya tend to be householders
rather than ascetics; Vallabhacharya
himself was married and had many chil-
dren. It is the smallest and least impor-
tant of the Bairagi Naga sampradays,
and the only event at which it figures is
the bathing (snana) processions at the
Kumbha Mela.
Rukmini
In Hindu mythology, the chief queen of
the god Krishna in his later life as the
king of the city of Dwaraka. Rukmini is
the daughter of the king of Vidarbha,
and although both she and her parents
favor her marriage to Krishna, her
brother, who is Krishna’s bitter enemy,
makes arrangements to marry her to his
friend Shishupala. On her wedding day,
with all the guests assembled, Krishna
carries Rukmini off in his chariot. They are
married, and, according to tradition,
have ten sons.
