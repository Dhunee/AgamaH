Hair
According to traditional Hindu notions
regarding purity and impurity (ashaucha),
head and facial hair trap and retain rit-
ual impurity. In ordinary cases this
impurity is removed by simple washing
in running water, just as for the rest of
the body. In cases of particularly violent
impurity, such as that connected with
death (maranashaucha), men will often
conclude the period of impurity by com-
pletely shaving both their heads and
beards. They may also have their nails
cut, probably reflecting that conviction
that any dispensable parts of the body
should be removed as a way to get rid of
any residual impurity.
Shaving the head is also the major
feature in the chudakarana, the tonsure
ceremony that marks the ritual conclu-
sion of infancy to remove any residual
impurities left from childbirth. Among
adults such head shaving is usually
restricted to men; women usually offer a
token lock of hair as a symbol for the
whole, although women may have
their heads shaved to fulfill a religious
vow. While shaving the head is fairly
common, shaving the body hair is not—
the Sanskrit language has different
words for these two types of hair, and
they are considered to be different
things entirely.
Hala
(“plow”) In Hindu iconography, the
branch of study concerned with the rep-
resentation of various figures, the hala is
an ordinary Indian plow, which repre-
sents farming; it is also considered a
weapon. The hala is most often associated
with the avatars of the god Vishnu, but
the only figure who always bears it is
Krishna’s brother Balarama, for whom
one of the epithets is Haladhara (“bear-
ing a plow”).
Haladhara
(“bearing a plow”) Epithet of Balarama,
elder brother to the god Krishna.
Balarama was given this name because
of his strong associations with farmers
and farming, and also because he
occasionally used the plow itself as
a weapon.
On one occasion he is said to have
menaced the Yamuna River with his
plow when he was displeased with the
course she was taking. This threat to dig
a new channel for her induced the
Yamuna her to change her course to one
with which Balarama was happier.
Halahala
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
deadly poison produced when the
gods and demons churn the Ocean
of Milk. The gods and demons churn
the ocean to produce amrta, the nectar
of immortality. Yet their action pro-
duces not only the amrta, but also its
antithesis, the halahala poison. This is
an event of great peril, since if left
unchecked this poison is so powerful
that it will destroy the earth. The poi-
son is neutralized by the god Shiva,
who holds it in his throat without swal-
lowing it. The poison turns his throat
blue, hence one of his epithets is
Nilakanth, “the blue-throated [one].”
See also Tortoise avatar.
Halebid
Village in the southern Indian state of
Karnataka, about sixty miles northwest
of the city of Mysore. As at its sister city,
Belur, Halebid is known for a magnifi-
cent collection of temples from
the Hoysala dynasty, who ruled
western Karnataka from the eleventh
to thirteenth centuries C.E. The
most notable site at Halebid is the
magnificent Hoysaleshvar Temple,
[[269]]
Hampi
Ruins of the city of Hampi. These structures were once a part
of the capital of the powerful Vijayanagar empire.
dedicated to Shiva in his form as Lord
of the Hoysalas.
At both Belur and Halebid, the tem-
ples were built from a particular type of
stone—variously described as chlorite
schist, steatite, or soapstone—that is
quite soft when newly quarried, but
gradually hardens with exposure to air.
This initial malleability makes the stone
easy to carve, and resulted in the lush
detail characteristic of Hoysala temples.
Architecturally speaking, Hoysala
temples have certain unique features:
a central hall connecting three star-
shaped sanctuaries, and temple towers
(shikharas) composed of well-defined
horizontal tiers, rather than the
continuous upward sweep characteris-
tic of the northern Indian Nagara archi-
tectural style.
Hampi
Deserted city in central Karnataka,
about 170 miles northwest of the state’s
capital, Bangalore. Hampi was the capi-
tal of the Vijayanagar empire (1336–1565
C.E.), which at its peak in the early six-
teenth century controlled most of the
[[270]]

Indian peninsula south of the Narmada
River. The empire’s wealth primarily
stemmed from its control of the spice
and cotton trade—both highly valuable
commodities at the time—and the
city of Hampi was built on a scale to
reflect its importance. The empire came
to an abrupt end after the battle of
Talikota in 1565, when the last
Vijayanagar king, Rama Raja, was
defeated by a coalition of Muslim sul-
tans from further north in the Deccan.
The city was sacked by the invading
sultans, and has been deserted ever
since. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
Hamsa
The name for the Barheaded Goose
(Anser indicus), a bird with several
important symbolic associations; the
most significant is purity and transcen-
dence, since the bird’s color is largely
white. It flies at very high altitudes,
and it is reputed to nest in Lake
Manasarovar in the high Himalayas,
the region believed to be the land of
the gods. Since it is popularly believed to
be able to separate milk and water—Hanuman
drinking for former, and discarding the
latter—the hamsa is also a symbol for
a discriminating person, who is able
to take counsel from many different
people, and to separate the good from
the bad.
Perhaps because of these associa-
tions, the hamsa is also the name for a
particular type of Hindu ascetic. The
Hamsa ascetics were described as peri-
patetic—they were directed to stay no
more than one night in a village or five
nights in a town. They were also directed
to perform different sorts of ascetic
practices, such as subsisting on cow’s
urine or dung, fasting (upavasa) for a
month at a time, or observing the chan-
drayana rite, a fast in which one
increases and decreases one’s food con-
sumption according to the waxing and
waning of the moon.
Hanuman
Monkey-headed Hindu god. Hanuman
originally appears in the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics,
where he is described as a minister
of the monkey king Sugriva and a
devoted servant of Rama, the god-king
who is the epic’s protagonist. Despite
Hanuman’s seemingly minor place in
the Hindu pantheon, he is an enor-
mously popular deity in modern India,
because he gives humans a god essen-
tially like themselves (or as they would
like to be) but on a greater scale and
with greater capacity.
Hanuman is said to have been born
of a union between the wind-god, Vayu,
and the nymph Anjana. After his birth
the infant Hanuman is continually hun-
gry, and one day he attempts to eat the
sun. Indra, the king of the gods and
ruler of heaven, is incensed at Hanuman’s
action, and strikes the infant with a
thunderbolt, breaking his jaw (hanu).
Vayu becomes very angry upon learning
of his son’s injury and ceases to perform
his usual activities. Since in Indian phys-
iology winds are responsible for all inter-
nal functions—including digestion,
respiration, and elimination—Vayu’s
Image of Hanuman, a monkey-headed god who is
a devoted servant of the god Rama. He plays a
pivotal role in the Hindu epic the Ramayana.
strike means that no one can live a nor-
mal life. After a short time the gods real-
ize their predicament and beg Vayu for
forgiveness; he is placated when each of
the gods promises to give Hanuman a
divine gift.
By virtue of these divine gifts,
Hanuman gains great powers. He is
immensely strong, and his image por-
trays him with bulging muscles. He is
also skilled as a healer, both through his
skill with herbs and natural medicines,
and his magical abilities to protect peo-
ple from evil supernatural beings.
Among his most unusual divine gifts are
the power to live as long as he likes and
to choose the time of his death.
His greatest virtue, and many would
say the real source of his power, is his
devotion (bhakti) to Rama. In the
Ramayana, Hanuman plays a pivotal
role in advancing the story. Hanuman is
sent out with a troop of other monkeys
to search for Sita, Rama’s kidnapped
wife, and after a long and arduous
search finally finds her imprisoned in
the kingdom of Lanka.
[[271]]
Hanuman Chalisa
Hanuman plays an even greater role
in the Ramcharitmanas (a vernacular
version of the Ramayana written by
Tulsidas), in which he is transformed
from a powerful monkey servant to the
devotee (bhakta), whose only aim is to
serve Rama with loving devotion. This
devotion precludes any type of worldly
attachment, including marriage and
family, and Hanuman remains a model
for a religious lifestyle stressing celibate
asceticism. In Indian culture, celibacy is
perceived as a source of power, since it
prevents the loss of a man’s vital forces
that takes place with ejaculation.
Yet for Hanuman’s devotees, his
greatest virtue is not his strength, but his
ability to act as an intermediary to
Rama, who is usually perceived as far
more remote from human affairs.
Because Hanuman is also a devotee,
people feel an affinity and kinship with
him, even though his powers are far
greater than theirs. In fact, they believe
that messages conveyed by Hanuman
have a better chance of reaching Rama’s
presence and getting action. In a text
aptly named the “Letter of Petition”
(Vinaya Patrika), the poet-saint
Tulsidas appoints Hanuman as his mes-
senger, in the full confidence that his
plea will be heard in the divine court.
Hanuman’s intimate access to divine
power, his own undeniable strengths,
and his perceived accessibility and sym-
pathy have all combined to make him
one of the most widely worshiped
deities in India, and one who crosses
sectarian boundaries.
Because of his service to Rama, he
is usually counted as a Vaishnava or
devotee of the Vishnu. Yet in an
interesting twist, Hanuman is also
considered to be an avatar or ”incarna-
tion” of the god Shiva, and is thus
revered by the Shaivites, Shiva’s
devotees. As a protective deity,
Hanuman is often worshiped on
astrologically inauspicious days, to
keep these inauspicious forces at
bay. His prodigious strength, celibate
lifestyle, and single-minded devotion
have made him the patron deity
[[272]]

of Indian wrestlers, who strive to imitate
him as they train.
Finally, he plays an important role as
a healer and sustainer. On one hand, he
is famous as an exorcist, helping people
get rid of evil spirits. On the other, he
preserves life for those who know his
special mantra, which gives them the
power—as he had—to choose their time
of death. Given his importance in mod-
ern Hindu life, Hanuman is only now
receiving the attention he deserves. For
more information see Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1982.
Hanuman Chalisa
(“Hanuman’s forty”) Forty poetic stanzas
in praise of the god Hanuman, written in
Hindi. A signature line (bhanita) at the
end of the text attributes it as written by
the poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623),
best known as the composer of the
Ramcharitmanas, a vernacular version
of the epic Ramayana.
Short texts like the Hanuman Chalisa
are often sung as a devotional act, or as
an established part of worship, and in
many cases people can recite the text by
heart. The text is written in the chaupai
meter, the predominant meter in the
Ramcharitmanas.
The text begins with a description of
Hanuman’s physical features, then
relates his devotion to Rama and
his heroic deeds in the Ramayana. The
closing verses reiterate Hanuman’s
power, promise benefits as a result of the
recitation of the verses, and reclaim
Tulsidas’s wish that Hanuman will reside
in his heart.
Hanuman Jayanti
Festival of the god Hanuman’s birthday.
In southern India, this is celebrated on
the full moon in the lunar month of
Chaitra (March–April), whereas in
northern India it is more commonly cel-
ebrated on the fourteenth day of the
dark (waning) half of the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). This latter
date reflects the date of Shivaratri, theHaridwar
most important festival of Shiva, which
is celebrated on the fourteenth day of
the waning half of the month Phalgun
(usually in February). The two festivals
are associated because Hanuman is
sometimes deemed an avatar or “incar-
nation” of Shiva, come to earth to serve
the god-king Rama.
Although Hanuman’s primary myth-
ic importance is as a faithful and power-
ful servant of Rama, in everyday
religious life Hanuman is a very impor-
tant deity, with a wide following. His
birthday has no prescribed celebrations,
but usually his devotees (bhakta) often
mark it with worship, festive proces-
sions, and devotional reading of reli-
gious texts, particularly the Hanuman
Chalisa and the Ramayana.
Hara
(“taking away,” “Destroyer”) Epithet of
the god Shiva. See Shiva.
Harappa
Ancient city and archeological site on
the Ravi River in Pakistan, about one
hundred miles southwest of the modern
city of Lahore. Harappa is one of the
cities of the Indus Valley civilization, a
highly developed urban culture that
flourished in the Indus Valley region
between the fourth and third millennia
B.C.E. Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have
been the most extensively excavated of
these cities, although archeological
work is proceeding in some of the oth-
ers, and the similarities between these
different cities have revealed a great deal
about this civilization’s material culture.
Hare Krishnas
Colloquial name for the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness
(ISKCON). See ISKCON.
Hari
(probably derived from the Sanskrit
verb hr, “taking away [evil]”) Epithet of
the god Vishnu, particularly in his
avatar or “incarnation” as the god
Krishna. See Vishnu and Krishna.
Haridasa
(ca. late 16th c.) Poet, singer, and devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Krishna, who
founded the sect known as the
Haridasis. According to tradition,
Haridasa was the teacher of Tansen, the
consummate musician at the court of
the Moghul emperor Akbar. Most of the
songs of Haridasa describe the love
between Radha and Krishna. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Haridwar
Sacred city (tirtha) on the Ganges River
about 140 miles northeast of Delhi.
Haridwar is one of India’s Seven Sacred
Cities. Dying in one of these cities is
believed to ensure the final liberation of
one’s soul. It is located on the edge of the
Shiwalik Hills, the foothills to the
Himalayas, and is the place where the
Ganges is believed to leave the moun-
tains and enter the northern Indian
plain. As with all the places where the
Ganges makes some natural transition,
Haridwar is considered especially holy,
and has been a pilgrimage destination
since at least the sixth century, when the
Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang reported
enormous pilgrim crowds.
Haridwar’s primary importance is as
a bathing (snana) place, and it draws
large crowds on festival days. For cen-
turies it has been an important site
for performing asthi-visarjana, the
last of the funerary rites (antyeshthi
samskara), in which the ashes of
the deceased are immersed in the
Ganges. Haridwar is also important as
the gateway to the pilgrimage sites in
the Garhwal region of the Himalayas,
and during the pilgrim season
(April–October) it serves as an impor-
tant transit and supply point to places
farther up in the mountains.
Finally, Haridwar has a long history
as a dwelling place for ascetics. It is a
major center for several ascetic groups,
[[273]]
Harihara
Crowds gather in Haridwar to bathe in the Ganges River.
[[274]]

particularly the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, trader-soldiers
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. It also serves as the winter quar-
ters for many ascetics who spend their
summers in the Himalayas. The pres-
ence of so many ascetics has had a pro-
found effect on the city’s general
character, both in the hundreds of
ashrams that are spread throughout the
city, and in the prohibitions on the sale
of eggs, meat, and liquor.his own kingdom. After gaining power,
Harihara reconverted to Hinduism,
despite having become an outcast
through his acceptance of Islam. His
example not only shows the fluidity of
religious identity in early medieval
India, but also Hindu pragmatism in
relation to the ruling powers. Although
Harihara had earlier become an outcast,
his power as ruler gave him the authori-
ty to reconvert without orthodox oppo-
sition. See also Vijayanagar dynasty.
HariharaHarihara
(early 14th c.) The founder of the
Vijayanagar (“city of victory”) empire,
established in 1336, which ruled over
much of southern India for the following
two centuries. The empire took its name
from the capital city that Harihara built
near the city of Hampi in the modern
state of Karnataka.
As a boy, Harihara was captured by
soldiers of the Bahmani sultanate to the
north, and had converted to Islam in
captivity, which rendered him an outcast
in the eyes of traditional Hindus. As a
man, Harihara was sent to regain the
southern region for the sultanate, but
instead used the opportunity to establish(2) A deity seen as a combination of the
gods Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).
Behind this hybrid deity lay the convic-
tion that both of these divinities were
differing manifestations of the same
divine power.
This underlying unity was represented
in several different ways. One way was to
create a figure whose right half had the
attributes of Shiva, and whose left half
had those of Vishnu. Another method,
found most often in modern poster art,
is to display both Vishnu and Shiva in
their full forms, riding on their respec-
tive animal vehicles. Vishnu’s elephant
and Shiva’s bull are conjoined at theHarishchandra
head, in a way that one can discern the
heads of both animals, but only one can
be perceived at any given moment. Both
the elephant-bull and the divided figure
show that Vishnu and Shiva are manifes-
tations of the same divine energy, and
that the particular deity one perceives
depends on one’s perspective at the
moment. The joint Harihara figure
presents an important religious truth,
but this idea is far too abstract to
become popular or widespread. In
their everyday religious lives people
have tended to worship one or the
other of these deities, rather than their
idealized union.
Harijan
(“child of God”) Name used by
Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) to des-
ignate those social groups formerly
known as untouchables. The name
reflected Gandhi’s conviction that these
people were human beings like any oth-
ers, and thus children of God.
Unfortunately, the word harijan
can also carry a pejorative sense in
modern India. It is used for any child
whose father is unknown—with the
child’s paternity ascribed to God—and
is thus a euphemism for “bastard.” In
modern times, the people whom
Gandhi called Harijans prefer to used
the name dalit (“oppressed”), since
they feel that this more accurately
describes their social status.
Hariray
(mid-17th c.) A noted disciple of
Gokulnath (1551–1640 C.E.), the third
guru of the Pushti Marg, a religious
community founded by his grandfather
Vallabhacharya.
Aside from being a disciple, Hariray
is considered Gokulnath’s scribe. He is
the commentator on a text called the
Chaurasi Vaishnavan
ki Varta
(“Account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”),
and probably compiled the text itself
under Gokulnath’s direction. This text
describes the lives of eighty-four
Vaishnavas, or devotees (bhakta), of the
god Vishnu, all associates and disciples
of Gokulnath’s father Vitthalnath or his
grandfather Vallabhacharya. The text’s
real purpose is not to provide biogra-
phies of these figures, but to illustrate
the importance of the Pushti Marg and
its leaders. Besides the Chaurasi
Vaishnavan ki Varta, a number of poems
are also attributed to Hariray, but these
may be the work of a later figure.
Harishchandra
In Hindu mythology, a king who is
famous for his truthfulness and integrity.
In modern Hindu culture, he has
become the symbol for someone who
patiently endures undeserved suffering.
Harishchandra’s suffering is a result
of the long-standing feud between the
sages Vasishtha—his family priest—and
Vishvamitra. When Vasishtha praises
the virtue of Harishchandra, Vishvamitra
becomes determined to prove him
wrong. Disguised as an old brahmin,
Vishvamitra conjures up an imaginary
son using his magical powers and gets
Harishchandra to promise that he will
give whatever is necessary for the
boy’s wedding.
When the time comes to redeem
this promise, Vishvamitra demands
Harishchandra’s kingdom. Vishvamitra
expects that the king will balk at this
demand, but Harishchandra immedi-
ately fulfills it. Vishvamitra then
remarks that when giving a gift to a
brahmin it is customary to give a gift of
money (dakshina) and demands a
large sum. To raise this amount,
Harishchandra first sells his wife
(Chandramati) and son into slavery
and finally sells himself to an outcast,
who puts him to work burning bodies
at the cremation ground.
After enduring these miseries for
some time, Harishchandra’s son is
bitten by a snake and dies. When
Chandramati brings the body to be
burned, he does not recognize her. He
refuses to cremate the boy until the
cremation fee is paid, since this will
[[275]]
Harivamsh
cheat his master of his rightful income.
Chandramati has no money for the
fee, and after listening to her lamenta-
tions Harishchandra recognizes her
and becomes doubly miserable. The
couple finally decides that suicide is
their only escape from their misery
and make a pyre on which to burn
themselves. When Harishchandra is
about to light the pyre, the gods
appear before them, praising his right-
eousness and his commitment to his
word, and Harishchandra’s outcast
master is revealed as dharma (“right-
eousness”) incarnate. Harishchandra’s
son is restored to life, his kingdom is
restored back to him, and everyone
lives happily ever after.
Harivamsh
(d. 1552) Poet, singer, and founder of the
Radhavallabh religious community,
which is based on the figure of Radha.
Initially portrayed as the god Krishna’s
human consort, she was later consid-
ered his adulterous mistress. The
Radhavallabh community took a very
different perspective, stressing Radha’s
nature as a deity, her equality and iden-
tity with Krishna, and her status as his
lawful wife. The Radhavallabhs focused
on the love (hit) of Radha for Krishna,
and because of this emphasis the poet is
also known as “Hit Harivamsh.”
Harivamsh’s poetry treats many of
the traditional themes found in Krishna
devotionalism, but from the perspec-
tive of a female companion (sakhi). He
compiled a collection of eighty-four
poems known as the Hit-chaurasi,
which are notable both for their highly
Sanskritized language and for their
incorporation of the alamkara (“poetic
ornamentation”) tradition of earlier
Sanskrit poetry. For further information
see Charles S. J. White, The Caurasi Pad
of Sri Hit Harivams, 1977.
Harivamsha
(“lineage of Hari”) A text traditionally
considered to be an appendix to the
[[276]]

Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. The Harivamsha is one of
the important puranas, which describe
the mythology of the Hindu deities, as
well as many other facets of popular
Hindu life.
In particular, the Harivamsha is
devoted to the mythology of the god
Krishna (also known as Hari). It is espe-
cially important for the traditional sto-
ries connected with Krishna’s childhood
in the Braj region, for which it is the ear-
liest identifiable source. The episodes
described in the Harivamsha are further
developed in the Bhagavata Purana, a
later work that is considered the most
influential text for the cult of Krishna.
Harsha
(r. 606–647) Ruler in the Pushyabhuti
line, a dynasty whose capital was the
city of Kanyakubja in eastern Uttar
Pradesh. Harsha is generally considered
the greatest Pushyabhuti ruler; he con-
trolled a large part of northern India and
to some extent restored the glory of the
Gupta dynasty (350–550).
Historically, Harsha’s reign is well-
documented, in part by the Chinese pil-
grim Hsuan Tsang, whose account gives
invaluable information about Indian life
at that time. Harsha was an able and
energetic ruler who spent much of his
later life evaluating the condition of his
empire. He was also a cultured and lit-
erate man—he was the author of three
Sanskrit plays—whose court was
graced by significant literary figures,
especially the playwright Bana. After
his death, his kingdom quickly disinte-
grated when he died without an heir.
See also Pushyabhuti dynasty.
Harshacharita
(“The Deeds of Harsha”) A drama writ-
ten by the playwright Bana (7th c.),
which chronicles the emperor Harsha’s
rise to power. Bana was a member of
Harsha’s court, and thus a contempo-
rary; his tale contains some evident
exaggeration, but also a great deal ofHastinapur
historical detail. Bana was a careful
observer, and the detailed descriptions
in the Harshacharita give significant
information about courtly and everyday
life in his times.
Hartalika Teej
Hindu women’s festival also known as
Teej. See Teej.
Haryana
Modern Indian state that surrounds
Delhi, the nation’s capital, in every
direction but the east. Haryana is one of
the so-called linguistic states formed
after Indian independence, to unite
people with a common language and
culture (in this case, Hindi) under one
state government. Haryana was created
in 1966, from the Hindi-speaking
regions of the former Punjab state. It
has traditionally been an important
agricultural region, since the land is fer-
tile and productive, but more recently it
has also benefited from the attempt to
create “satellite cities” around Delhi, in
order to spread out the development in
the capital region. These efforts have
greatly raised the land values in the
areas closest to the capital. Aside from
this localized land boom, Haryana is a
largely rural state.
Haryana’s major religious sites,
which are right next to one another, are
Kurukshetra and Thanesar. The former
is cited as the battleground for the war
described in the epic Mahabharata; the
latter is named as the place that the god
Shiva was worshiped by the Pandavas,
the Mahabharata’s protagonists.
From a true historical perspective,
the level plains around the town of
Panipat have seen three decisive battles
that influenced the course of Indian his-
tory. In 1526, Babar, a central Asian
monarch who had been displaced from
his own homeland in Afghanistan,
crushed the Lodis to end the Lodi
dynasty and establish his own Moghul
dynasty. In 1556 Babar’s grandson
Akbar decimated the Sur dynasty, which
had temporarily occupied the Moghul
capitals at Delhi and Agra, and thus
reestablished Moghul rule. In 1761 an
invading Afghan army defeated the
Marathas, ending the period of Maratha
territorial expansion. For more informa-
tion, an accessible reference is Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Hashish
See charas.
Hasta
(“hand”) In Indian dance, sculpture,
and ritual, a hasta is a particular hand
position. In some cases, this hand posi-
tion may have symbolic meaning, as in
varada hasta or the “gift-giving” ges-
ture; in other cases the hasta’s name
may simply describe the shape of the
hand, as in kataka hasta, in which the
tips of the fingers are loosely joined to
the thumb. In the context of dance, all
of these gestures have been given multi-
ple symbolic meanings, and the dancer
can use these gestures to tell a story
through her gestures.
There is some overlap in meaning
between the words hasta and mudra
(“seal”), which are both used to describe
hand gestures, and the two are some-
times used interchangeably. Of the two,
mudras tend to be more strictly defined,
and to be far more stylized than hastas.
They stress the positions of the fingers,
rather than of the entire hand; the fin-
gers are always in very specific posi-
tions. Mudras always have very specific
symbolic meanings.
Hastinapur
Archeological site about sixty miles
northeast of Delhi. This site has yielded
pottery and other artifacts believed to
be from the ninth to sixth centuries
B.C.E., which would make them contem-
porary with the latest parts of the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu religious texts. In the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, Hastinapur is the capital of
[[277]]
Hatha Yoga
[[278]]

the Kauravas, a group of one hundred
brothers who are the epic’s antagonists.
Although the name of the site and the
place named in the epic matches, noth-
ing has been found to provide a connec-
tion between these two.for Shakti, and the phoneme tha to the
moon, which is a symbol of Shiva. Hatha
yoga is interpreted as the union of the
sun and moon—that is, these two cen-
ters of power are believed to exist in the
subtle body.
Hatha YogaHeavens
System of religious discipline (yoga)
based on a series of bodily postures
known as asanas. Practicing this yoga is
widely believed to provide various phys-
ical benefits, including increased bodily
flexibility and the ability to heal chronic
ailments. Yet in the Yoga Sutras written
by Patanjali, the earliest systematic
treatment of yoga, these asanas are only
one part of an eight-step program that
also includes such practices as breath-
ing exercises and meditation. The pur-
pose of hatha yoga is to train and
strengthen the body so that the practi-
tioner can sit comfortably in medita-
tion. Although Hatha yoga’s emphasis is
on the body, it assumes a spiritual and
religious context that in contemporary
times has often been either evaded or
ignored—leading some Hindus to dis-
parage such yoga as simply a technique
to develop better sexual control.
A more esoteric meaning of hatha
yoga comes from the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who understand hatha yoga as
referring to processes in the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to reside
on a different plane of existence than
the actual body, but with certain corre-
spondences to the actual body. It is visu-
alized as a set of six psychic centers
(chakras) running roughly along the
course of the spine; above and below
these centers are found the two divine
principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini.
The aspirant aims to combine kundalini
with the Shiva principle at the crown of
the head; through this union, the physi-
cal body will become immortal.
According to the Nathpanthis, the
phoneme ha refers to the sun, a symbolIn Hinduism, there are believed to be
many additional planes of existence
besides the visible earthly realm. These
other planes of existence include the
heavens, which are realms of reward,
pleasure, and enjoyment. Beings are
born in heaven as a reward for their past
good deeds, and the life of the gods liv-
ing in these heavens is invariably
described as long and pleasurable. Yet
heaven is not permanent, and when
one’s karmic merit is exhausted and
one’s stay in heaven is done, one
inevitably descends from heaven to take
birth in a lower form.
In general, heaven is viewed as a dis-
traction to serious religious life. Birth in
heaven comes only through accumulat-
ing and expending an enormous
amount of religious merit generated by
past good deeds, and thus is a tremen-
dous drain on one’s accumulated spiri-
tual resources. Furthermore, once one
has been born in heaven, life is so easy
and carefree that people generally feel
no inclination to engage in religious life.
For both reasons, life in heaven is con-
sidered a goal to which people should
not aspire.
Hedgewar, Dr. K. B.
(1889–1940) Founder and first
supreme leader (sarsanghchalak) of
the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh
(RSS), which he formed in the central
Indian city of Nagpur in 1925. The RSS
is a conservative Hindu organization
formed for the express purpose of
providing leadership for a revitalized
Hindu India; for most of its history it
has characterized its mission as cul-
tural, rather than religious or political.Hemp
The character of Dr. Hedgewar and
the RSS are inextricably linked to the tur-
bulent years immediately after World
War I, and the profound dislocation in
Indian society that came with the strug-
gle for independence. In his youth,
Hedgewar had been involved in the
independence movement, and for some
time even supported Mohandas
Gandhi’s Congress Party. But by the
early 1920s, he had become disillu-
sioned with Gandhi’s methods. He had
also been deeply influenced by the
Hindu nationalist Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar, whose central thesis was that
the Hindus were a nation, despite their
profound regional, social, linguistic, and
religious differences.
On the festival of Vijaya Dashami
(Dussehra) in 1925, Hedgewar formed
the RSS to help create this Hindu nation
by unifying Hindus previously separated
by divisions of caste and class. This date
is highly significant, since according to
popular Hindu belief any endeavor
begun on Vijaya Dashami will invariably
succeed. Hedgewar led the RSS until his
death, fifteen years after the organiza-
tion was founded.
Aside from training a leadership
corps, the RSS was also formed to protect
Hindu interests. On one level, it endeav-
ored to do this by developing more
assertive, tough members, and by train-
ing them to use traditional weapons
such as the wooden staff. On quite
another level, the RSS has a long history
of charitable work with refugees and vic-
tims of natural disasters, and one of its
missions is service to the Hindu com-
munity.
In either case the RSS has often been
perceived as anti-Muslim—until 1977,
non-Hindus were barred from being
members—and many of its members
view the Muslim community as aliens in
India, if not actual enemies. Throughout
his life, Hedgewar kept the RSS strictly
aloof from politics, and his insistence
that it was a cultural and character-
building organization helped keep it
from being banned by the British. Under
its banner as a cultural organization, the
spread from the state of
Maharashtra to other parts of India,
aided in part by deteriorating Hindu-
Muslim relations in the years prior to
independence in 1947. For further
information see Walter K. Andersen
and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; Tapan
Basu et al., Khaki Shorts and Saffron
Flags, 1993; and Christophe Jaffrelot,
The Hindu Nationalist Movement in
India, 1996.

Hells
In Hinduism there are believed to be
many additional planes of existence
besides the visible earthly realm. These
alternate planes of existence include the
hells, which are conceived of as places of
punishment for one’s past misdeeds.
Traditional Hindu accounts describe
the hells in great detail, often linking
particular sorts of punishments to
particular sinful actions. Just as with
heavens, life in a hell is ultimately
an impermanent state, although the
time of punishment is usually described
as enormously long and incredibly
painful. Still, when the time of punish-
ment is done and one’s bad deeds
have been expiated, one will be reborn
in a higher form.
Needless to say, birth in any of
the hells is something to be avoided if
at all possible, and for this reason people
are urged to perform penances
(prayashchitta) for their sins while they
are still living, so that the consequences
of these sins may not burden them in
their next lives.
Hemp
Colloquial name for Cannibus indica,
more commonly known as marijuana.
In earlier times the plant’s long fibers
were used in the manufacture of rope
and cloth. In contemporary times it is
mainly used for its narcotic properties,
either by crushing and processing the
leaves to make bhang or by collecting
the plant’s resins as hashish (charas).
[[279]]
Hero-Stones
The use of hemp as a narcotic is illegal,
except for specific places and times,
including certain pilgrimage sites and
festivals. However, many ascetics
continue to smoke hashish regularly.
Hero-Stones
Monuments erected on the site where a
person met a heroic death. These stones
are known as viragal. See viragal.
Hetu
(“reason”) In Indian philosophy, this is
an important part of formulating an
inference (anumana). In this context,
the word has two differing meanings,
one general, the other more obscure.
The accepted form for an inference has
three terms: a hypothesis (pratijna), a rea-
son (hetu), and examples (drshtanta);
each of these three have their own con-
stituent parts. In its most general sense, the
word hetu refers to the reason or evidence
that supports the assertion in the initial
hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis
that a mountain is on fire would be sup-
ported by the reason that there is smoke on
the mountain.
In a narrower sense, hetu can also
refer to the part of a reason that proves
the hypothesis. For example, if one
proves the statement “the mountain is
on fire” with the reason “the mountain
has smoke,” the part of the reason that
indicates that there is smoke is the hetu.
Hetvabhasa
This is the term for a fallacious argument.
For a valid inference (anumana), certain
conditions must be met, or the inference
will be invalid. The accepted form for an
inference has three central terms: the first
is a hypothesis (pratijna), which contains
a subject class (paksha) and a thing to be
proved (sadhya); the second is a reason
(hetu) giving evidence for the hypothesis;
and last come examples (drshtanta),
which give further evidence for the
hypothesis. In the stock example, the
hypothesis that “there is fire on this
mountain” is making a certain claim
[[280]]

(sadhya)—namely, that there is fire—
about a certain class of things (paksha)—
namely, this mountain. The inference’s
second part gives the reason (hetu)
“because there is smoke on this moun-
tain,” which also makes a claim about the
subject class—namely, this mountain.
One condition necessary for a valid
inference is for the subject class to
fall within the reason given, so that in
all cases the reason would apply to it.
The statement “there is fire on this
mountain because there is smoke on
that mountain” is an example where
the subject class and the reason given
are clearly separate.
Yet the most important condition for a
valid inference is that the reason given
must account for every case of the thing
to be proved, such that it cannot be
explained in any other way. This is known
as pervasion (vyapti) and is a critical test
for the hetu. For the Indian logicians,
claiming that smoke implied the presence
of fire was a valid inference, since smoke
was always produced by fire.
On the other hand, the claim that fire
implied the presence of smoke was
invalid. This was because the logicians
could name a case in which fire was not
invariably accompanied by smoke, and
thus failing this requirement of “perva-
sion”—the case of the red-hot iron ball,
which was considered fiery, but not
smoky. This counterexample is known as
an upadhi (“obstruction”). It gives an
example when one thing does not
inevitably bring another, and thus shows
that the hetu fails to pervade the sadhya,
since there is a class of fiery things that do
not smoke. For further information see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Hijra
Name for a class of male transvestites,
most of whom have undergone self-
castration as a ritual renunciation of
their sexuality. Hijras often serve as
homosexual prostitutes, and they are an
established feature of the decadent
underside in most Indian cities. TheirHimalayas
Panorama of the Himalayas in Nepal. Hindus consider the Himalaya mountains
sacred since they are believed to be home to the gods.
most important social function is to
sing and dance at houses in which a
male child has been born, although they
may also be called to perform on other
auspicious occasions.
Their ritual role in connection with
births shows a strong association with
fertility, and at any function their pres-
ence is believed to confer health and
prosperity on the sponsoring family, for
which the hijras will demand appropri-
ate compensation. At the same time, the
life of the hijras seems fraught with con-
trary notions: Although they are ritually
associated with fertility, they are them-
selves sterile, and their sexuality is non-
procreative. Though they are associated
with auspiciousness and prosperity,
they are a socially marginal group with
very low social status. For the only reli-
able study to date, see Serena Nanda,
Neither Man Nor Woman, 1999.
Himachal Pradesh
(“Himalayan State”) Modern Indian state
located in the Himalayan region between
the state Jammu and Kashmir and the
kingdom of Nepal. Himachal Pradesh was
created in 1966 when the former state of
Punjab was divided into Punjab,
Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. As its
name implies, Himachal Pradesh is a
mountain state, with its lower regions in
the Shiwalik Hills and its upper regions in
the high Himalayas. Most of the state’s
people live in the long, fertile river valleys
between the mountain ranges, and in the
hot season its hill stations provide wel-
come relief from the scorching heat.
Himachal is the home for seven of
the nine Shiwalik goddesses. These
seven goddesses are all the presiding
deities of a particular site, and some of
them have become quite important in
northern Indian religious life. Himachal
Pradesh is also home to a spectacular
Dussehra festival in the town of Kulu,
at which all the gods in the Kulu Valley
are brought to Kulu to honor the god
Rama on his victory over the demon-
king Ravana. For general information,
an accessible reference is Christine
Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Himalaya
A minor deity who is the personified
form of the Himalaya Mountains.
Although the Himalaya Mountains are
one of the defining features of the Indian
subcontinent, the deity Himalaya has a
very insignificant place in Indian
mythology. His most important role is as
the father of the goddess Parvati, who
when she reaches maturity is married to
the great god Shiva. Himalaya is
described as exceedingly wealthy,
because of the mineral riches that the
mountains contain. See also Himalayas.
Himalayas
(“abode of the snow”) Mountain range
that arcs across the northern border of
India, although the only Indian states with
significant Himalayan regions are Jammu
and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh, and, further east, Sikkhim.
[[281]]
Hindi
In a Hindu religious context, the
Himalayan regions in the first three
states are the most significant; the
mountains in these three contiguous
states are all part of an extended
Himalayan cultural region, fronted by
the Shiwalik Hills. They are consid-
ered sacred, both as the literal abode
of the Hindu gods (in particular Shiva,
who is believed to live on Mount
Kailas) and also as the source of
sacred rivers such as the Ganges,
Yamuna, and Indus. These high
mountains are also a traditional home
for Hindu ascetics wishing to
renounce the everyday world and
search for personal spiritual realiza-
tion; the physical hardships these
ascetics must endure in the moun-
tains are also believed to generate
spiritual power.
Given their religious importance,
the Himalayas are full of sacred
sites (tirthas); among the most impor-
tant are Amarnath, Yamunotri,
Gangotri, Kedarnath, Badrinath, and
Nanda Devi.
Hindi
Modern Indian language classified as a
member of the Indo-European lan-
guage family; Hindi is the “official”
language of the Republic of India.
Hindi is spoken throughout most of
northern and central India as a second
or “link” language and as a “mother”
tongue in much of the states of Uttar
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is
also one of the broadcast languages
for the television and radio networks
run by the Indian government and by
virtue of these mediums can be found
throughout the nation.
As with many of India’s regional
languages, Hindi has a long history as
a literary language, particularly in an
earlier version known as Braj Bhasha,
which was the dominant language in
which northern Indian devotional
(bhakti) poetry was written. The slow
demise of Sanskrit in contemporary
times has helped make Hindi an
[[282]]

important language for fiction,
learned scholarship, and writing on
Indian culture.
In modern India, speaking a certain
language often carries political impli-
cations, since an important factor in
preserving regional identities has been
the stress on maintaining one’s region-
al language. For this reason, many peo-
ple are not about to let Hindi replace
their regional languages. This senti-
ment is particularly marked in south-
ern India, where the imposition of the
Hindi language is decried as a new
form of imperialism.
Hindu Mahasabha
Hindu religious and political organiza-
tion, formed at the 1915 Kumbha Mela,
a gigantic religious festival. The Hindu
Mahasabha was originally formed to
help foster Hindu causes, such as a
call for a complete ban on cow
slaughter, promoting the use of the
Hindi language in the DevaNagari
script, and addressing the problem of
caste discrimination.
In the early 1920s, the movement
became more overtly political and
by the early 1930s espoused an
unabashed Hindu nationalism, exem-
plified by its leader, Vinayak Damodar
Savarkar. The dark underside of this
Hindu nationalist crusade was a pro-
nounced animus toward Muslims,
which was only strengthened by the
deteriorating relations between the
two communities in the years preced-
ing World War II.
Although the Hindu Mahasabha was
eager for official recognition by the rul-
ing British government and sought to be
recognized as the sole legitimate speak-
er for the Hindu community, these
hopes were never realized. The British
government included them in talks only
after negotiations with the Indian
National Congress Party had broken
down, and cut relations with the
Mahasabha after fences had been
mended with the Congress.
After independence in 1947, theHinglaj
party’s image was damaged by its asso-
ciation with Mohandas Gandhi’s assas-
sin, Nathuram Godse. It continued
to field political candidates until the
early 1960s, but never gained significant
political power. For further information
see Kenneth W. Jones, “Politicized
Hinduism: The Ideology and Program
of the Hindu Mahasabha,” in
Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in
Modern India, 1998.
Hindutva
(“Hindu-ness”) An idea first propounded
by the political activist Vinayak
Damodar Savarkar. It first appeared in a
pamphlet titled Hindutva/Who is a
Hindu? and is the fundamental basis of
modern Hindu nationalism.
Savarkar’s thesis was that the
Hindus were a nation, despite their
sharp regional, cultural, linguistic,
and religious differences; further-
more, he defined a Hindu as anyone
who considered India both fatherland
and holy land. This loose definition
was broad enough to encompass all
of the variety found in Indian Hindu
culture. But it was also clearly reach-
ing for the lowest common denomi-
nator. For most Indians, identity is
invariably based on concrete region-
al, linguistic, or sectarian grounds,
rather than an abstract notions of
being “Hindu.”
Yet it is important to note who this
loose definition excludes—Muslims
and Christians, India’s most visible
minorities, who are marginalized by
virtue of their “alien” holy lands. By
this definition, Hindus “belong” in
India simply by virtue of who they are,
whereas Muslims and Christians, no
matter how long their families may
have lived in India, are always consid-
ered to be outsiders.
Hindutva ideology is a fundamental
assumption of the Rashtriya Svayamsevak
Sangh (RSS), a contemporary conserv-
ative Hindu organization, and the
organizations that are affiliated with
the RSS, particularly the Vishva Hindu
Parishad, and to a lesser extent the
Bharatiya Janata Party. Hindutva ideals
are also a prominent feature of parties
such as the Shiv Sena, which combine
Hindu and regional identity. For further
information see Christophe Jaffrelot,
The Hindu Nationalist Movement in
India, 1996.
Hinglaj
Sacred site (tirtha) located on the
coast of the Arabian Sea in the
Baluchistan Province of modern
Pakistan. Hinglaj is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites located
throughout the subcontinent that are
sacred to the goddess Sati. Each Shakti
Pitha marks the site where a body part
of the dismembered goddess fell to
earth, and then took form as a differ-
ent goddess; in the case of Hinglaj, the
body part was the crown of Sati’s head.
Hinglaj is the furthest west of all the
Shakti Pithas, and thus represents the
furthest boundaries of the traditional
Hindu cultural area.
The presiding goddess at Hinglaj
is known by various names, the most
common being Hinglaj Devi. She is
considered an extremely powerful
goddess—partly because of her
dangerous location on the periphery of
India, but also because the crown of the
head (brahmarandhra) is considered
the highest and most powerful part of
the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate phys-
iological system believed to reside on a
different plane of existence than the
actual body, but with certain correspon-
dences to the actual body. It is visualized
as a set of six psychic centers (chakras)
running roughly along the course of the
spine. Above and below these centers
are found the two divine principles,
Shiva (awareness) and Shakti (power)—
the latter at the base of the spine, and
former in the crown of the head.
Because of Hinglaj’s association with
mastery of the subtle body, a visit to her
shrine was considered essential for any-
one striving for perfection in yoga. By
[[283]]
Hiranyagarbha
the 1800s the area around her shrine
had become completely dominated by
Muslims and thus well outside the
Hindu culture area. To travel outside of
this area is to risk loss of one’s Hindu
identity. To counter the danger of travel-
ing outside this area, it became tradi-
tional for ascetics who had gone there
on pilgrimage to be branded with her
symbol on their return to India, as a way
to purify them and remake them as
Hindus. The political tensions between
India and Pakistan since their indepen-
dence in 1947 have made it almost
impossible for Hindu pilgrims to visit
the shrine. For further information see
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and
the Kanphata Yogis, 1973. See also pitha.
Hiranyagarbha
One of the earliest Hindu cosmological
myths. See Golden Embryo.
Hiranyakashipu
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu
is a demon king who is killed by the
god Vishnu, in his avatar or incarna-
tion as a Man-Lion. As a result of his
harsh physical asceticism, Hiranyakashipu
gains a series of divine powers, which
render him virtually invulnerable:
notable of these powers is that he
cannot be killed by man or beast, by
day or by night, and neither inside
nor outdoors.
Protected
by
these
powers,
Hiranyakashipu first conquers the
entire earth and then drives the gods
from heaven, growing prouder and
more oppressive as his power increas-
es. He particularly oppresses his son
Prahlada, who despite his father’s
power remains a sincere devotee
(bhakta) of Vishnu. Incensed at the
thought that someone refuses to wor-
ship him, Hiranyakashipu finally gives
Prahlada the ultimatum to worship
him or die.
Prahlada calls on Vishnu for help,
and Vishnu appears in the form of a
Man-Lion—a man from the torso down,
[[284]]

with the head and shoulders of a lion—
which is neither man nor beast. The
Man-Lion seizes Hiranyakashipu in the
palace doorway, which is neither
inside nor out, at twilight, which is nei-
ther day nor night, and uses his sharp
claws to tear out the demon’s entrails,
killing him. The story of Hiranyakashipu
is meant to illustrate the danger of
pride, and the mythic reality that no
power, however powerful, can keep
one from the consequences of one’s
evil deeds.
Hiranyakeshin
(4th c. B.C.E.?) Sage, writer, and commen-
tator, also considered a disciple of the
writer Apastamba. Apastamba is the
author of a type of text known as a Kalpa
Sutra. He is only one of three authors,
along
with
Baudhayana
and
Hiranyakeshin, whose surviving works
contain all three elements prescribed for
a Kalpa Sutra: prescriptions for Vedic rit-
uals (Shrauta Sutras), for domestic rites
(Grhya Sutras), and for appropriate
human behavior (Dharma Sutras).
All three of these men belonged to
the same school, the Taittiriya school of
the Black Yajur Veda. According to tradi-
tion, Baudhayana was the oldest,
Apastamba
his
disciple,
and
Hiranyakeshin Apastamba’s disciple.
This chronology is supported by the
texts themselves, since Baudhayana’s
text is much less organized than the oth-
ers, and more archaic in its language.
Hiranyaksha
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyaksha is a
demon king who is killed by the god
Vishnu, in the latter’s avatar or incarna-
tion as a Boar. Hiranyaksha has per-
formed harsh physical ascetic practice
(tapas) and as result, gained various
divine powers. He eventually grows so
powerful and proud that he spirits away
the earth herself, hiding her at the bot-
tom of the cosmic ocean. It is at such
times of cosmic crisis that Vishnu takes
form on earth, to restore the equilibriumHoli
of the cosmos through his actions.
Vishnu takes the form of a giant boar
and dives to the bottom of the ocean,
where he slays Hiranyaksha, places the
earth on the tip of his tusk, and lifts her
from the waters. With the reappearance
of the earth, the process of creation
resumed. See also Boar avatar.
Hitopadesha
(“beneficial teaching”) A well-known
moralistic story that is drawn from
Panchatantra , a set of moralistic fables
aimed at conveying practical and worldly
wisdom. The Hitopadesha was compiled
in the twelfth century as an introductory
reader to Sanskrit.
The frame story for the both of these
texts describes a king who is distressed
by his sons’ lack of learning and good
moral character; these doubts lead to
grave misgivings about their abilities to
be good and fair rulers after his death.
He resolves this problem by hiring a
teacher who teaches the boys using
fables, often with several shorter fables
embedded in a longer tale. The
Hitopadesha was intended to give prag-
matic advice about how to be successful
in the real world and maintains that
caution and self-interest are the keys to
success in life.
Holi
Major religious festival celebrated on the
full moon in the lunar month of
Phalgun (February–March), which in
northern India comes very close to the
end of the lunar year. Holi is essentially a
festival of reversal and is celebrated with
great enthusiasm throughout much of
India. As the lunar year’s final major fes-
tival, the celebrations for Holi mirror the
pattern of cosmic dissolution found in
other units of time, whether the solar
day or the basic unit of cosmic time, the
mahayuga. In this pattern, the order in
the cosmos steadily deteriorates until all
order finally disappears, but after a cer-
tain time is suddenly, completely, and
perfectly reformed.
The festival of Holi is celebrated in
two parts: a bonfire on the evening
before Holi, and the “festival of colors”
on the morning of Holi itself. Material for
the bonfire is collected in the weeks
before Holi and although the things put
on this bonfire pile are supposed to be
old and worn-out (with the symbolism of
getting rid of the old), much newer
things are often put on it as well, and this
is a time in which people guard their
possessions carefully.
The days before Holi see the break-
down of various social taboos. In his The
Divine Hierarchy, author Lawrence Babb
reports the use of obscenity and bawdy
discourse during this time, including
stamping the word “penis” all over town
using stamps carved from potatoes. As
Holi gets closer, pranks such as pelting
passersby with water balloons become
more and more common. Such behavior
is ultimately harmless, but is still com-
pletely unacceptable in ordinary times
and symbolizes the coming cosmic dis-
solution. On the night of Holi, the bon-
fire is lit, symbolizing the destruction of
the old, and people may direct obsceni-
ties toward the fire as a vehicle for get-
ting rid of enmities from the previous
year. Mythologically, the bonfire comes
from the burning of the demon Holika,
who tries to trick her brother Prahlada
into being burned on a bonfire, but is
herself consumed by the flames.
The morning after the bonfire is the
high point of Holi, the “festival of colors.”
For weeks before Holi, the shops in the
markets display mounds of powders in
various colors, most commonly in vivid
greens, reds, and purple; the colors are
used as powder, or are mixed with water.
People play with the colored water using
syringes or balloons. In the gentlest type
of play, each person takes a small pinch
of colored powder and gently applies it
to the other person’s forehead. Needless
to say, the play with colors can often
become much rougher, with people
smearing and soaking each other with
colors, dyeing each other’s clothing in
multiple hues, and often staining the
skin for weeks afterward.
[[285]]
Holi
The evening before the festival of Holi, men in Delhi arrange
colored powders to prepare the site for a bonfire.
[[286]]
Holkar, Ahalya Bai
This and all other Holi-related antics
are always described as “play” (khel),
and the operating assumption is that
one cannot become angry with the peo-
ple with whom one is playing, no matter
how outrageous the behavior or how
pointed the insults. The festival of Holi is
the one day in the year when the bound-
aries of the usual social hierarchy are
completely disregarded, along with the
taboos on physical touching that are pri-
marily based on the inherent concern for
ritual purity. Another characteristic of
Holi is that it is one of the few occasions
when socially respectable people con-
sume bhang, an intoxicating prepara-
tion made from ground-up marijuana.
The morning passes in a welter of
noise, confusion, and color, with (at
street level) absolutely no rules, symbol-
izing the chaos of cosmic dissolution. Yet
in the afternoon, cosmic (and social)
order are suddenly restored. People take
baths, change into new clothes, and go
out visiting without fear of being col-
ored, and any person bold enough to
pelt someone with dyes at this time is
subject to severe disapproval.
In recent times, particularly in the
larger cities, the license associated with
Holi has been taken as an opportunity
for all sorts of antisocial behavior: public
drunkenness, molesting women, destroy-
ing property, and the chance to settle old
grudges by physically harming people.
The chaos is so intense that in larger
cities many people stay in their houses
on Holi, “playing” with members of their
immediate family in the gentler spirit
that is characterized as “true” Holi.
Given the threat to public order, the
government has taken some action, but
the very nature of the holiday makes it
difficult to regulate—since it is a festival
of reversal, the government is one more
force to be disregarded on that morning.
Various government agencies have also
tried to discourage the practice of mak-
ing bonfires, although here the concern
stems from worries about deforestation
rather than the breakdown of social
order. For further information see
McKim Marriot, “The Feast of Love,” in
Milton Singer (ed.), Krishna: Myths, Rites,
and Attitudes, 1966; and Lawrence Babb,
The Divine Hierarchy, 1975.
Holika
In Hindu mythology, the wicked sister of
the demon-king Hiranyakashipu.
Holika helps Hiranyakashipu try to
kill his son Prahlada, who is a
steadfast devotee (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. Because of a divine power, she
cannot be harmed by fire. She tricks
Prahlada into sitting on her lap in a
bonfire, expecting that she will be
unharmed and he will die. Fortunately
Vishnu transfers her power from
Holika to Prahlada, and she is
consumed by the fire, while he remains
completely unscathed.
The myth of the burning of Holika is
the model for the bonfires for the festi-
val of Holi. On a mythic level, the bon-
fire symbolizes the triumph of good over
evil; on another level, since the materi-
als in the fire are supposed to be old and
broken things, the bonfire symbolizes
getting rid of one’s baggage from the
previous year, and starting anew.
Holkar, Ahalya Bai
(r. 1761–1795) Hindu queen in the
Holkar dynasty. The family ruled one
of the successor states resulting from
the breakup of the Maratha empire,
whose capital was in the central Indian
city of Indore.
She came to power at a time when
the influence of the Moghul dynasty
had been greatly reduced and moved to
fill the political vacuum that this created.
During her long reign she managed to
wield genuine political power over
much of north-central India. She also
served as a highly visible royal patron at
several Hindu pilgrimage sites, includ-
ing Benares, where she funded the
reconstruction of the Vishvanath tem-
ple, and Haridwar, where she is said to
have paid for the construction of a ghat,
which is a structure that leads to a
sacred bathing (snana) area. For further

New History of the Marathas, 1986.
Homa
In its most specific meaning, homa
refers to the “sacrifice to the gods”
(devayajna), which is one of the Five
Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the dharma literature, or
texts on religious duty. Homa refers to
the act of making offerings of clarified
butter into a sacrificial fire, a rite that is
directed toward satisfying the gods.
Today, the word homa is often used with
a far more general meaning, to refer to
any religious rite in which offerings are
placed in the sacred fire.
Homosexuality
Although
homosexuality
is
not
unknown in Indian culture, it has never
had a very prominent presence. The
Kama Sutra contains a brief account of
homosexual oral sex and the classes of
men who performed this, but it is little
more than a passing mention.
In modern times, the male transves-
tites known as hijras often serve
as homosexual prostitutes, and they
are an accepted if marginal presence
in Indian life.
Although according to the dominant
Hindu ethos the search for pleasure—of
any kind—is an aim of life (purushartha),
other factors have channeled the
expression of sexual desire in other
directions, especially toward traditional
marriage. One of these is the general
desire for progeny, particularly sons;
another is the notion of the family as the
basic unit for social life. In addition, the
traditional male concern with losing
vitality through seminal emission is a
reason to abstain from sexual relations.
Finally, the cultural assumption that
ultimate wisdom comes only when one
has renounced all desires would have
affected sexual desire of all kinds.

Hookswinging
One of the more extreme vows per-
formed by devotees (bhakta) of the god
Skanda during the annual pilgrimage at
Kataragama, in the southern part of the
island of Sri Lanka. This vow is per-
formed in return for finding healing
from physical ailments or deliverance
from distress. Those keeping this vow
inserted hooks into their back and thigh
muscles; ropes are attached to these
hooks, and the devotees are suspended
over the heads of passersby.
These ardent devotees are reportedly
rewarded for their suffering with a state
of ecstasy in which they feel no pain and
suffer no bleeding. In this state, they are
also believed to be mouthpieces for the
god Skanda, and other pilgrims seek
their advice for every conceivable kind
of problem. For further information see

Place in Ceylon, 1966; and Bryan
Pfaffenberger,

Kataragama
Pilgrimage,” in Journal of Asian Studies,

Hotr
Type of priest mentioned in the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire. These rites were so complex
that they required specialized ritual
technicians: the hotr, the adhvaryum,
the udgatr, and brahman. Of these, the
hotr was the sacrificial priest who recited
the verses from the Rg Veda that were
used in the sacrifice.Hoysaleshvar Temple
House of Clay
Realm of punishment described in a
verse in the Rg Veda (7.89), the earliest
Hindu religious text. As described in this
verse, the House of Clay is a place to
which evildoers—particularly those
guilty of speaking falsely—will be sent
by the god Varuna, who is considered
the guardian of righteousness and cos-
mic order (rta).
As its name indicates, the House of
Clay is a gloomy and joyless place. What
is notable in the original verse is the lack
of any notion of reincarnation (sam-
sara), which later became a central
Indian assumption. At the time it was
seen as an undesirable and permanent
state after death.
House of Lac
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, this is one of the
stratagems through which the epic’s
antagonist, Duryodhana, tries to kill the
five Pandava brothers, who are his
cousins and the epic’s protagonists.
Duryodhana builds the Pandavas a
magnificent palace, without telling
them that it is constructed completely of
lac, a highly flammable substance. After
the Pandavas have settled into the
palace, Duryodhana has his minions set
it on fire in an effort to burn them alive.
The Pandavas are saved by the sagacity
of their uncle Vidura, who not only
warns them of the danger, but has con-
structed an underground passage allow-
ing them to escape from the house and a
tunnel to convey them far away without
being discovered. When the house is set
afire, the Pandavas escape through the
tunnel and for some time are safe from
Duryodhana, since they are presumed
to have died in the fire.
Hoysala Dynasty
(11th–14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
that ranged over the southern part of
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
The capital city was Dorasamudra,
which is now called Halebid.
Sightseers at the Hoysaleshvar Temple in Halebid.
The temple is known for the detailed and
elaborate stone carvings that ornament its facade.
The Hoysalas were originally hill
chiefs who were vassals to the
Chalukyas (a central Indian dynasty
that ruled from the seventh to eighth
century C.E.), but who became indepen-
dent in 1093. At their peak they ruled
much of the states of Karnataka and
northern Tamil Nadu, but by the begin-
ning of the fourteenth century had seen
their power decline. By the middle of the
century, their kingdom had been
annexed by the Sangamas, whose capi-
tal was at Vijayanagar.
The Hoysalas are most famous for
the magnificent temples they constructed
at the cities of Belur and Halebid, which
are treasure-houses of medieval south-
ern Indian sculpture.
Hoysaleshvar Temple
Largest and most magnificent of the
Hoysala temples at Halebid, the
dynasty’s capital city; the temple itself
was
built
in
[[1141]]
–1182.
The
Hoysaleshvar Temple is dedicated to
the god Shiva, in his form as “Lord of
the Hoysalas.”
Hoysala temples were built from a
particular type of stone—variously
described as chlorite schist, steatite, or
soapstone—that is quite soft when
newly quarried, but gradually hardens
with exposure to air. This initial
[[289]]

malleability makes the stone easy to
carve and facilitated the lush detail
characteristic of Hoysala temples. The
Hoysaleshvar Temple is known for the
quantity of lush detail, which surpass-
es other Hoysala temples. See also
Hoysala dynasty.

Vishnu, particularly in his avatar or
incarnation as the god Krishna. See

Hsuan Tsang
(605–664) Chinese Buddhist scholar and
translator, whose account of his extend-
ed stay in India (629–645) provides one
of the few reliable sources for Indian life
in that period.
Hsuan Tsang’s purpose in coming
to India was to find reliable copies of
the Buddhist scriptures, which had
become severely garbled and corrupt-
ed during their transmission to China.
He was a highly learned man and dur-
ing his stay spent years studying in
Buddhist educational institutions,
particularly the Buddhist university at
Nalanda. He traveled all over northern
India and because of his piety and
learning was honored by the kings he
met, including the Emperor Harsha.

ki: Buddhist Records of the Western
World, Samuel Beal (trans.), 1969.
Huhu
In Hindu mythology, Huhu is a partic-
ular gandharva, or celestial musician.
He has the misfortune to displease a
Hindu sage, when his amorous water
play with some celestial damsels
breaks the sage’s meditation. The sage
curses Huhu to become a giant croco-
dile, and he remains in this state for
many years. The crocodile preys on the
creatures in the lake, and one day
seizes the leg of a giant elephant. This
elephant is really King Indradyumna,
who has also assumed this form as the
[[290]]

result of a curse. The elephant and the
crocodile struggle for one thousand
years, so evenly matched that neither
can best the other. Huhu is finally
released from his curse when the god
Vishnu himself comes down from
heaven and kills him. See also
Gajendramoksha.
Human Sacrifice
The practice of human sacrifice was
uncommon in the history of Hindu
religious life, but not unknown. One of
the common mythic motifs in the wor-
ship of certain fierce and powerful
deities is for devotees (bhakta) to offer
their own heads to the Goddess as the
ultimate sacrifice and act of devotion,
but experts are uncertain how fre-
quently this rite was performed. One
mythic example of this is the demon-
king Ravana, who cuts off nine of his
ten heads before the god Shiva grants
him divine power. The resolve to com-
mit this action is also attributed to the
Bengali saint Ramakrishna, although
the goddess Kali intervened before he
could carry it out.
The one place where human sacri-
fice was undoubtedly a regular prac-
tice was at the temple of the goddess
Kamakhya in Assam. This temple is
one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess that
spreads throughout the subcontinent.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where
a body part of the dismembered god-
dess Sati fell to earth, taking form
there as a different goddess. In this
case, the body part was Sati’s vulva,
and the presence of such a highly
charged part of the female body made
Kamakhya a very powerful goddess.
When the new temple was dedicat-
ed in 1565, she was reportedly offered
the heads of 140 men, and this prac-
tice continued until the British halted
it in 1832. The men offered as human
sacrifices were reportedly volunteers,
who believed that they had been
called by her to do this; in the time
between announcing their intentionHypogamous Marriage
to be sacrificed and their deaths they
were treated as virtual divinities, since
they were considered to have been
consecrated to the goddess. For fur-
ther information see E. A. Gait, A
History of Assam, 1963. See also pitha.

Hundi
In earlier times, the name for a letter
of credit issued from a mercantile
house. By the early 1800s, these letters
functioned as a virtual currency, since
in some cases they would pass
through twenty or thirty transactions
before being returned for payment.
Hundis are significant because they
allowed families to transact business
over large areas without having to
actually carry large sums of money
with them and thus helped to foster
long distance trade.
In modern times, this is also the
most common term for a temple
collection box, where visitors deposit
their offerings.
Hygiene
Orthoprax Hindus (that is, Hindus who
stress correct religious practice) lay
great stress on cleanliness of their bod-
ies and their immediate environment.
Although to the outside eye this scrupu-
lous attention would seem to indicate a
concern for hygiene, these actions are
performed primarily to protect and
retain religious purity.
In many cases, concerns for hygiene
and purity overlap, as in the pervasive
practice of bathing (snana) and the
regulations concerning bodily cleanli-
ness. Both of these simultaneously
remove dirt and impurity (ashaucha),
but in other cases these concerns
clearly diverge.
One example of this divergence is
the way that household refuse is often
simply put out in the street—a prac-
tice that keeps the home pure and
clean, but which fosters unhygienic
conditions directly outside the home.
Another example of this disjunction
can be seen in the traditional use of
cow dung as a purifying substance, or
the way that the Ganges River is
always considered pure, even in its
lower reaches where it is full of sewage
and industrial effluents. These exam-
ples clearly show that purity and
hygiene are very different concepts
and that, from a religious perspective,
purity is by far the more important of
the two.
Hypergamous Marriage
A marriage in which the wife comes
from a group with lower social status
than the husband. Although the ideal
Hindu marriage is between a man and
woman of equal social status, hyperga-
mous marriage was admitted as a possi-
bility in the dharma literature, although
it was not encouraged. In most cases, it
was specified that a man’s first wife
should be of equal social status, but that
he was then permitted to marry women
of lower status.
In modern India, where the predom-
inant form of marriage is still arranged
marriage, most marriages are still
between men and women of equal sta-
tus. However, a hypergamous marriage
is likely to generate less opposition than
a hypogamous marriage, where a
woman marries a man from a lower sta-
tus group. In the dharma literature,
hypergamous marriage was known as
anuloma, “with the hair” (i.e., in the nat-
ural direction).
Hypogamous Marriage
A marriage in which the wife comes
from a group with higher social status
than the husband. Such marriages were
strictly forbidden in the dharma litera-
ture, and this prohibition illustrates the
role of women in determining a group’s
social status.
[[291]]
Hypogamous Marriage
It is deemed acceptable for women
to marry people of higher social status
(hypergamous marriage), because it is
believed that they are improving the sta-
tus of their group by becoming associat-
ed with a higher status group. Marriage
to a man of lower status was strictly for-
bidden, since the exchange of women
implies some sort of equality between
the two groups, and thus drags the com-
munity’s status down. In the dharma lit-
erature, hypogamous marriage was
known as pratiloma, “against the hair”
(i.e., in an unnatural direction). For fur-
ther information see Jadunath Sarkar, A
History of the Dasanami Naga Sanyasis,
