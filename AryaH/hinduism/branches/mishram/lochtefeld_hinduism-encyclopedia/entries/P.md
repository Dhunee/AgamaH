Pacification of Planets
Indian astrology (jyotisha) recognizes
nine “planets”: the sun, moon,
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn; the remaining two are Rahu and
Ketu, which do not correspond to any
Western astrological features. Each of
these planets is considered helpful or
harmful by nature. The relative strength
of any planet is believed to depend on
its position in the horoscope and vis-à-
vis the other planets. All are seen as
minor divinities rather than as simple
material objects, and thus a potentially
harmful planet can be “pacified”
through rites intended to minimize its
disruptive potential. One common
means of pacification is to wear the
gemstone corresponding to the particu-
lar planet, so that the stone can neutral-
ize the planet’s force. More inauspicious
cases demand stronger measures, often
involving rites in which the planetary
inauspiciousness is given away through
the medium of gifts (dana). For further
consideration see Gloria Goodwin
Raheja, The Poison in the Gift, 1988. See
also Suryia.
Padma
(“lotus”) One of the richest symbols in
Indian philosophy and iconography,
both Hindu and Buddhist, and an
invariably auspicious object. Its size and
colors make it one of the most beautiful
Indian flowers, but the lotus is also a
potent symbol for spiritual realization. It
is rooted in the mud—symbolizing the
corrupting world with which all beings
must contend—but it blooms above the
surface of the water, signifying transcen-
dence. The lotus plant’s underwater
[[486]]

stems grow as long as necessary to get
the flower bud above the water’s sur-
face—whether three, five, or ten feet—
symbolizing the human ability to
overcome obstacles to spiritual
progress. Finally, lotus leaves are cov-
ered with a waxy coating, upon which
water beads up and flows off; one reli-
gious text, the Bhagavad Gita (5.10),
uses this as a simile for the man who
renounces all attachment and is
untouched by the things of the world.
Aside from its symbolic content, the
lotus is also an important element in
Hindu iconography. It is one of the four
identifying objects carried by the god
Vishnu, along with the conch shell
(shankha), club (gada), and discus
(chakra). It is also commonly carried by
the Goddess, both in her forms as Durga
and related powerful goddesses, and in
her beneficent and benevolent form as
Lakshmi, who is usually portrayed as
standing on a lotus. The lotus even fig-
ures in one of the common Hindu cre-
ation myths, in which a lotus sprouts
from Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal
Brahma, who proceeds to create the
earth. When the universe has run its
course and is about to be destroyed,
same process happens in reverse.
Padmapada
One of the two attested disciples of
Shankaracharya—the other being
Sureshvara—and the founder of the
Vivarana school of Advaita Vedanta.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality, Brahman, lies behind all things,
and that all things are merely differing
forms of that reality. Advaita proponents
claim that reality is nondual (advaita)—
that is, that, despite the appearance of
difference and diversity, all things are
nothing but the formless, unqualified
Brahman. For the Advaitins, the
assumption of diversity is a fundamen-
tal misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things, and a manifestation of
avidya (lack of genuine understanding).Paduka
Man sitting in the padmasana, or lotus posture. This sitting position is often used in yoga and meditation.
The defining characteristic of
Padmapada’s Vivarana school is that he
places the locus of ignorance in
Brahman, in contrast to the Bhamati
school, which placed it in the individual.
To explain how Brahman can be the
locus of ignorance the Vivarana
Advaitins invoke the theory of
Reflectionism: Just as an image appear-
ing in a mirror is based on the original,
but different from it, so human selves
are identical with Brahman, but appear
to be separate. The basis of Padmapada’s
position is an uncompromising affirma-
tion of Brahman as the sole “reality,” to
which anything that exists must belong.

Potter (ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to
Samkara and His Pupils, 1981; and
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Padmasana
(“lotus posture”) Well-known sitting
position (asana) used in yoga and in
meditation; the lotus posture is also one
of the sitting positions in which deities
are portrayed in Hindu iconography. In
this position the person sits cross-
legged, with each foot placed on the
thigh of the opposite leg. One of its ben-
efits is that it is extremely stable and well
suited for meditation, since the angle of
the lower legs keeps the upper part of
the legs flat on the ground, making a
wide base to support the body. Done
properly, it also keeps the spine quite
straight, which is thought essential to
keep from constricting the channels in
the subtle body. In Indian iconography,
the lotus position is sometimes repre-
sented at the base of a statue by the
sculpture of a lotus, which forms the
base on which the image is placed.
Paduka
A wooden sandal used mainly by
ascetics. It consists of a wooden sole and
a mushroom-shaped front post, which
is gripped with first two toes for stability.
Padukas are used by ascetics not only
because of their cheapness and durabil-
ity, but because they are completely free
of animal products such as leather,
which are considered impure. Aside
[[487]]
Padya
from their functional use as footwear,
after death an ascetic’s padukas will
often be kept by his (or, more rarely, her)
disciples, as a sign of their guru’s sym-
bolic presence.tending to give the paintings a more lyri-
cal feel. For further information see
W. G. Archer, Indian Painting, 1957; and
“Pahari Miniatures: A Concise History,”
in Marg, Vol. 28, No. 2, 1975.
PadyaPaishacha Marriage
(“for the feet”) The third of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the deity as an
honored guest. In this offering, the deity
is offered water for washing the feet,
which would be a traditional act of hos-
pitality for a guest coming in from out-
side. The actual act of offering can be
performed in various ways and often
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.
In some cases the water will simply
be presented before the deity’s image
with the understanding that the deity
has taken it, whereas in other cases
the devotee (bhakta) will physically
wash the feet of the image. In either
case, the underlying motive is to show
love for the deity and to minister to the
deity’s needs.One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty.
Paishachas are a class of demons, so a
marriage named after them is already
suspect. The Paishacha marriage takes
place when a man has intercourse with a
woman who is drunk, unconscious, or
asleep. Not surprisingly, this is one of
the four reprehensible (aprashasta)
forms of marriage, and because of the
woman’s lack of conscious awareness,
this form was forbidden, even though it
was deemed a valid marriage. Here the
writers’ concern seems to have been to
give the “bride” legal status as a wife,
rather to legitimate the actions of the
“groom.” Although theoretically valid,
this form of marriage has always been
forbidden, and thus it has never been
one of the common forms of marriage.
See also marriage, eight classical forms.
Pahari
One of the two influential “schools” of
Indian miniature painting, the other
being the Rajasthani. The distinctions
between schools are geographical and
thus somewhat arbitrary, since, for
example, the Basohli paintings belong
to the Pahari school, but are stylistically
closer to those of Rajasthan than to the
later Pahari style.
The Pahari style flourished in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
the small kingdoms in the Shiwalik Hills
north and west of Delhi. It first appears
in the kingdom of Basohli, where the
influence of the Rajasthani school is the
clearest, and later developed in the king-
doms of Jammu, Guler, Garhwal, and
Kangra. The developed Pahari style dif-
fers from the Rajasthani in its emphasis
on more linear drawing—perhaps influ-
enced by European art—and a more
restrained use of color, both features
[[488]]

Paithan
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Godavari River in the state of
Maharashtra, about 175 miles east of
Bombay. Although of reduced impor-
tance in modern times, it has a long his-
tory as a trading city and was an
important stopping-point on the central
Indian trade route from southern India
to Ujjain. Since the sixteenth century,
Paithan has been famous as the home of
Eknath, one of the important figures in
the Varkari Panth, a religious commu-
nity centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Varkari religious practice
primarily consists of two pilgrimages, in
which all the participants arrive in
Pandharpur on the same day. Eknath
still symbolically travels to PandharpurPalani
twice each year; a palanquin (palkhi)
bearing his sandals is at the head of the
procession bearing his name.
Paksha
One of the parts in the accepted form of
an inference (anumana) in Indian phi-
losophy. The accepted form for an infer-
ence has three terms: an assertion
(pratijna), a reason (hetu), and exam-
ples (drshtanta); each of these three has
its own constituent parts. The paksha is
part of the first term, the assertion, and
comprises the class of things about
which the assertion is to be proved. For
instance, in the stock example, “There is
fire on that mountain, because there is
smoke on that mountain,” the paksha
in this case is “that mountain,” or the
class of things about which the asser-
tion must be proved. The class that
forms the paksha must also appear in
the second term of the inference, the
reason, as the common link between
the two parts (as in “this mountain is on
fire, because this mountain is smok-
ing”). The paksha thus forms the com-
mon link between the assertion and the
reason, thereby ensuring that the latter
is relevant to the former.
In the context of a lunar month, the
word paksha refers to the month’s two
“parts.” The Shukla Paksha is the wax-
ing half, while the Krishna Paksha is the
waning half.
Pakudha Kacchayana
An atomistic early Indian philosopher
whose views are mentioned in the
Buddhist scriptures. As these scriptures
portray him, Pakudha believed that
seven things were eternal, unmoving,
and unchanging—the four elements,
ease, pain, and the soul. According to
Pakudha, when a sword cuts a person’s
head in two, no one is deprived of life,
rather the sword merely penetrates the
interval between two elementary sub-
stances (presumably the soul and the
material part of the person’s body). This
example seems to suggest an antisocial
ethos, but beyond this, very little is
known about him.
Pala Dynasty
(8th–12th c.) Eastern Indian dynasty
whose ancestral homeland was in Bihar
but whose core territory also spanned
most of modern Bengal. The Pala
dynasty’s zenith came at the turn of the
ninth century, when they controlled the
entire northern Indian plain all the way
into the Punjab region. Their rise to
power came as a result of political insta-
bility in the Gangetic plain, and the
Palas were quickly supplanted by the
Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty
while
retaining sway over Bengal and Bihar for
several centuries more. Their territory in
Bengal was eventually taken by the Sena
dynasty, and the Palas were finally con-
quered by the Gahadavalas in the mid-
dle of the twelfth century. The Palas and
Senas are both noted for a particular
type of sculpture, in which the images
were made from black chlorite schist
polished to a mirror finish.
Palani
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in the east-
ern part of the state of Tamil Nadu,
about sixty miles northwest of Madurai.
Palani is part of a network of six temples
in Tamil Nadu dedicated to Murugan, a
hill deity who has been assimilated into
the larger pantheon as a form of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva. Five of these
temples have been definitively identi-
fied, and each is associated with a par-
ticular region, a particular ecosystem,
and a particular incident in Murugan’s
mythic career—in the case of Palani,
Murugan lived there as a young ascetic.
Every other shrine to Murugan in Tamil
Nadu can be considered the sixth of
these temples. The cult of Murugan is
thus a symbolic vehicle for Tamil pride
and identity, and since the number six
has connotations of completeness—as
in the six directions, or the six chakras
in the subtle body—it also connotes
that nothing external is needed. For
[[489]]
Palanquin
between the sixth and ninth centuries.
The greatest Pallava rulers were king
Mahendravarman and his successors
Narasimhavarman I and II. The reign
of the Pallava dynasty was marked by
the explosion of southern Indian cul-
ture: the development of Tamil litera-
ture, the devotional (bhakti) religious
fervor of the groups known as the Alvars
and the Nayanars, and the magnificent
religious monuments at Mahabalipuram.
Throughout much of its existence the
Pallava empire carried on a running bat-
tle with the Chalukya and Pandya
Dynasties, neither of which could pre-
vail against it, but it was eventually
absorbed by the next great southern
Indian empire, the Chola dynasty. See
also Tamil language and Tamil epics.
Palm Leaves
A palanquin is used to carry images of a
temple’s deity in ritual processions.
further information see Fred Clothey,
“Pilgrimage Centers in the Tamil
Cultus of Murukan,” in Journal of the
American Academy of Religion, Vol. 40,
No. 1 (1972).
Palanquin
Platform or litter supported by poles on
the shoulders of two or more men, and
used as a respectful way to carry some-
thing or someone in procession. A
palanquin can be used to carry the
image of a deity in a ritual procession, or
an ascetic leader or spiritual teacher
(guru) by his (or more rarely, her) disci-
ples, or the sandals (padukas) or other
possessions connected with one’s spiri-
tual leader, as in the Varkari Panth’s pil-
grimage to Pandharpur.
Pallava Dynasty
(6th–9th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
whose capital was at the city of
Kanchipuram, and which ruled over
much of the southern Indian peninsula
[[490]]

Until commercially produced paper
became readily available, palm leaves
were the most common writing medium
in traditional India. The palm leaves
were cut into narrow strips held together
by a cord (sutra) running through a hole
punched in the middle of the leaf. Palm
leaf books usually had a top and bottom
made from strips of wood, to protect the
leaves, and these covers were often
ornately decorated. The fragile nature of
these palm leaves made regular copying
necessary to preserve manuscripts, even
though such frequent copying generally
introduced errors. If left untended, the
life span of a manuscript was at most
fifty years, due to the deteriorations
caused by the climate and the damage
from a species of termite known as
“white ants,” which fed on palm leaves.

Pancha Dravida
Collective name for the five main south-
ern Indian brahmin communities,
whose names largely correspond to the
regions in which they live: the GujaratisPanchala
in the state of Gujarat, Maharashtris in
the state of Maharashtra, Karnatas in
the state of Karnataka, Andhras in the
state of Andhra Pradesh, and Dravidas
in deep southern India, in the states of
Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Pancha Gauda
Collective name for the five main north-
ern Indian brahmin communities: the
Gaudas and Kanaujias, who stretch
over most of northern India; the
Maithilas in the northern state of Bihar;
the Utkalas in the coastal state of
Orissa; and the Saraswats, traditionally
found in several widely separated loca-
tions. One group lived in the coastal
region of Sindh in modern Pakistan,
although after Partition in 1947 most
migrated to Bombay. Another group
was located in prepartition Punjab,
although here too they have tended to
migrate away from the part of Punjab in
modern Pakistan. A third branch, known
as the Gauda Saraswats, is found on a
narrow strip of coastline in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka.
Panchagavya
(“five [products of the] cow”) A mixture
of cow’s milk, curds, clarified butter
(ghee), urine, and dung. Since each of
these products comes from the sacred
cow, it is considered a ritually purifying
substance. Panchagavya is drunk for
purification during rituals of expiation
(prayashchitta), and it can also be used
in other rituals used to purify people,
objects, and places.
Panchagni-Tapa
(“five-fires asceticism”) Form of volun-
tary physical mortification, usually per-
formed in the hot season, in which the
person sits surrounded by four fires, the
fifth fire being the sun overhead.
Although this practice is now uncom-
mon, it is very old and routinely named
in the puranas and other religious texts
as one of the standard ascetic practices.
As with all forms of physical ascetic
endurance (tapas), this rite is performed
under the assumption that voluntarily
enduring pain and/or hardship is a
way to gain spiritual, religious, and
magical power.
Panchak Nakshatra
A group of five (pancha) consecutive
nakshatras (the twenty-seven signs in
the lunar zodiac) in Indian astrology
(jyotisha). The lunar houses are divided
equally throughout the solar zodiac,
with 2.25 lunar houses for each solar
sign. In a single lunar month the moon
moves through each of these lunar
houses in turn, spending about a day in
each. The Panchak Nakshatra is believed
to be a highly inauspicious time, and
people who pay attention to astrology
will often severely curtail any nonessen-
tial activities until this time has passed.
Panchakroshi Yatra
A circular journey (yatra) in which pil-
grims circumambulate the outer bound-
ary of Kashi (the largest of the three
concentric ritual areas contained in the
city of Benares) and visit 108 shrines
along the way. The journey’s length is
reckoned at five kroshas (roughly ten
miles), hence the name. The journey
measures out the boundaries of the
sacred city, and thus pilgrims symboli-
cally circle the entire world. Although
the best known Panchakroshi Yatra is in
Benares, and the name is most com-
monly associated with this place, many
other sacred sites (tirthas) have similar
pilgrimage routes, and this process of a
circular journey around a sacred spot is
a common ritual motif.
Panchala
Name of the region corresponding to the
middle part of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, centered on the Ganges River
valley around the city of Kanauj.
Panchala is mentioned as a kingdom as
early as the sixth century B.C.E., and
although it became a tributary to the
great empires such as the Mauryas
[[491]]
Panchamahayajna
(4th–3rd c. B.C.E.), it retained an inde-
pendent identity until the third century.
See also Maurya dynasty.
Panchamahayajna
(“[the] five great sacrifices”) Set of
five ritual actions—brahmayajna, pit-
ryajna, devayajna, bhutayajna, and
nryajana—that are prescribed in the
dharma literature, (texts on religious
duty). These five actions are prescribed
daily religious observances for a “twice-
born” householder, that is, a householder
who has been born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—and
who has received the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” Each sacrifice (yajna) is directed
toward a different class of beings—from
the Absolute Reality down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions: to
Brahman by teaching and studying the
Veda, to the ancestral spirits (pitr) by
offerings of water (tarpana), to the gods
(deva) by offering clarified butter into
the sacred fire, to the animals and social
outcasts (bhut) by putting out food for
them, and to human beings (nr) by
showing hospitality to guests. In the
time since the dharma literature was
composed, Hindu life has seen signifi-
cant changes in emphasis, and although
some of these are still important in
modern Hindu life—particularly the
stress on hospitality to guests—in most
cases the others have been either elided
or replaced by other religious forms.
Panchamakara
“The Five Forbidden Things,” literally,
“the five m’s”: A group of five things used
for worship in the secret, ritually based
religious practice known as tantra. This
name arises because the names for all
five of these begin with the letter “m”—
madya (wine), matsya (fish), mamsa
(meat), mudra (fermented or parched
grain), and maithuna (copulation).
They are used in their actual form in
“left hand” (vamachara) tantra, and by
[[492]]

substitution in “right hand” (dakshi-
nachara) tantra.
All five are condemned by
“respectable” Hindu society (the last
because it is characterized as adulter-
ous), and their use in tantric ritual must
be seen in a larger context. One of the
most pervasive tantric assumptions is
the ultimate unity of everything that
exists. From a tantric perspective, to
affirm that the entire universe is one
principle—often conceived as the activ-
ity of a particular deity—means that the
adept must reject all concepts based on
dualistic thinking. The “Five Forbidden
Things” provide a ritual means for
breaking down duality, since in this ritual
the adept violates societal norms forbid-
ding consumption of intoxicants, non-
vegetarian food, and illicit sexuality, in a
conscious effort to sanctify what is nor-
mally forbidden. Tantric adepts cite
such ritual use of forbidden things as
proof that their practice involves a more
exclusive qualification (adhikara) and is
thus superior to common practice. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; Swami Agehananda Bharati, The
Tantric Tradition, 1977; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
Panchang
In Indian astrology (jyotisha), an
almanac documenting the position of
the various celestial bodies during the
course of a calendar year, including the
days of the moon’s monthly cycle, its
progression through the nakshatras,
and the position of the planets. Most
Hindu religious festivals fall according
to a lunar calendar, and thus a panchang
is needed to determine when they will
arrive. A panchang is also important for
helping people to determine auspicious
and inauspicious times for the perfor-
mance of certain activities. The greatest
care is taken in fixing marriage times, to
avoid any possible inauspiciousness
that could affect the marriage, but
in many cases a panchang will bePanchayat
consulted before initiating any impor-
tant activity.
Pancharatra
(“five nights,” of uncertain meaning)
The name denotes a particular group of
Vaishnavas (devotees of the god
Vishnu). Although there is plenty of evi-
dence that the Pancharatra community
is very old, very little is known about its
origins. In the earliest Vaishnava sectari-
an texts, the Pancharatra community is
unfavorably compared to another
group, the Bhagavatas, with the former
described as marginal and the latter as
“Vedic” and respectable. Despite this
seeming disapprobation, in their earli-
est appearances Pancharatras do not
seem theologically different from the
Bhagavatas, although their differences
may have been rooted in differing
practices. In their later history, the
Pancharatras become associated with
an elaborate theory of creation, final-
ized somewhere around the sixth century
and based on the successive appearance
of four divine emanations: Vishnu-
Narayana, Sankarshana, Pradyumna,
and Aniruddha. The successive activity
of these divine emanations brings the
world into being, but each is also associ-
ated with a particular facet of spiritual
life through which human beings can
reverse the process of creation and gain
liberation. The Pancharatra school is
also important for its theory of primary
and secondary avatars, in which the lat-
ter can include any properly consecrat-
ed image of the deity. The doctrine of
secondary avatars has become a pivotal
idea in the later Shrivaishnava commu-
nity, through which Pancharatra ideas
have continued to influence modern
Hindu life.
Panchatantra
(“Five Treatises”) A collection of moralis-
tic fables intended to impart practical
and worldly wisdom. The fables them-
selves are framed by the story of a king
who is distressed by his sons’ lack of
learning and good moral character,
which gives him grave misgivings about
their ability to rule well after his death.
He resolves this problem by hiring a per-
son to teach the boys through fables,
each of which usually has several shorter
fables embedded in it to give moral
lessons along the way. These fables are
intended to provide pragmatic advice
about how to be successful in the real
world, particularly in the art of state-
craft. This pragmatic focus can lead one
to characterize the text’s advice as
opportunistic, particularly since it
encourages caution and self-interest as
the keys to success. The Panchatantra
exists in several versions, of which the
most famous is the Hitopadesha. The
text has been translated numerous
times; a version found its way to Europe,
where it became the basis for the fables
of La Fontaine.
Panchavati
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, the place where
three of the epic’s central characters—
the god-king Rama, his wife Sita, and
his brother Lakshmana—live during
much of their fourteen years of forest
exile. It is from here that Sita is kid-
napped by Ravana, the demon-king of
Lanka. Although the events in the
Ramayana cannot be definitively set in
any specific place, there is a village
named Panchavati, outside the city of
Nasik in the state of Maharashtra,
which is identified with the mythic site.
Panchayat
In traditional India, a group of five (pan-
cha) elders from a particular community,
who were the final authority for the
members of that community. Each jati
(endogamous subcommunity, often
defined by hereditary occupation) was a
self-governing body, for which the pan-
chayat would make all the important
decisions. In modern India this institu-
tion is being hailed as a paradigm for
decentralized government, in which the
[[493]]
Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja
people themselves take responsibility
for their communities, but since there
are multiple jatis in any traditional
Hindu village, this also means that there
were multiple centers of authority.
Panchayatana (“five-abode”) Puja
Type of worship (puja) performed by
Smarta brahmins, a group of brahmins
distinguished, not by region or family,
but by the religious texts they hold most
authoritative—in this case, those known
as the smrtis rather than sectarian reli-
gious texts. The panchayatana puja is
marked by the simultaneous worship of
five different deities—usually Vishnu,
Shiva, Surya, Ganesh, and the Goddess.
Individual Smartas may choose one or
another from among these as their pri-
mary deity, but all these deities are ritu-
ally honored since they are all
considered manifestations of the divine.
Panchkedar
(“The Five Kedars”) The collective name
for a network of five sites, sacred to the
god Shiva, spread throughout the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas:
Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath,
Madmaheshvar, and Kalpeshvar. Each
site is identified with a part of Shiva’s
body, thus providing a series of connec-
tions between the deity’s body and the
land itself—understandably so, since
Shiva is believed to dwell in the
Himalayas. Kedarnath is identified as
Shiva’s back, Madmaheshvar his navel,
Tungnath his arm, Rudranath his face,
and Kalpeshvar his matted locks (jata).
Panchvani
(“Five Voices”) Manuscript collection
compiled by the Dadupanth, a religious
community founded by the northern
Indian poet-saint Dadu (1554–1603).
The collection contains the works of five
different devotional (bhakti) poet–
saints: Dadu, Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas,
and Hardas. Rajasthan’s desert climate
has helped to preserve these manu-
scripts, some of which date from the
[[494]]

early seventeenth century. The Panchvani
manuscripts are among the earliest
written sources for these poets, which
makes them an important resource for
the historical study of northern Indian
devotional poetry. For further informa-
tion on the literary resources of the
Dadupanth, see Winand Callewaert
(trans.), The Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi
Rajab, 1978; and The Sarvangi of
Gopaldas, 1993.
Panda
A hereditary priest who assists pilgrims
with any rituals they may need or desire
to perform, and also with any other
needs that the pilgrims may have. Each
panda family in any given pilgrimage
place (tirtha) has the exclusive rights to
serve pilgrims coming from a particular
geographical area or areas; pilgrims are
supposed to seek out the panda serving
their native region, whether or not the
pilgrims still live in that place. On every
visit, pilgrims will make an entry in the
panda’s pilgrim register (bahi), detailing
the names of those who visited and the
reason that they came. Some of these
registers date back hundreds of years,
and the documents are the ultimate
proof of the hereditary connection
between panda and pilgrim families. In
earlier times this hereditary relationship
was essential for the pilgrims, since their
connection with their pandas provided
resources while traveling—lodging,
food, and other sorts of support. The
pandas would minister to their clients,
arrange for any needed rites, and even
lend them money, if necessary. Pilgrims
would usually give the panda a token
gift when they departed, along with a
pledge for some larger amount, which
the pandas would travel to their homes
to pick up.
Although pandas are often character-
ized as greedy and rapacious—based on
their tendency to demand what they
think a client is able to pay—in its ideal
form both parties benefit from the rela-
tionship. In recent years, the pandas
have become less central figures inPandharpur
Varkari Panth pilgrims en route to Pandharpur.
many pilgrimage places, and conse-
quently, their status and their income
have declined. Many pilgrimage places
have been developed as sites for reli-
gious tourism, and hotels and facilities
that have been built at these places have
rendered pilgrims less dependent on
their pandas for accommodation. At the
same time, recent years have seen a gen-
eral decline in the performance of ritual
acts, except for the most important, par-
ticularly those connected with death.
Pandava
(“sons of Pandu”) A collective name
for the five brothers who are the
protagonists of the Mahabharata:
Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula,
and Sahadeva. Although they are
named after king Pandu, none are actu-
ally his son, since Pandu has been
cursed to die the moment he holds his
wife in amorous embrace. Rather, they
are magically conceived through a
mantra given by the sage Durvasas to
Kunti, Pandu’s senior wife. The mantra
gives the woman who recites it the
power to call down any god and to have,
by that god, a son equal in power to him-
self. Kunti uses this mantra to bear
Yudhishthira by the god Dharma,
Arjuna by the storm-god Indra, and
Bhima by the wind-god Vayu. With
Pandu’s blessing Kunti also teaches the
mantra to her co-wife Madri, who med-
itates on the Ashvins (divine twins who
are the physicians to the gods), and
delivers the twins Nakula and Sahadeva.
The basic theme of the Mahabharata
is the story of the struggle for royal
power between the Pandavas and
their cousins, the Kauravas, which
culminates in a war that destroys the
entire family.
Pandharpur
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bhima River in the state of
Maharashtra, about 185 miles east and
south of Bombay. Pandharpur is best
known for the temple to the god
Vithoba, and has been a center of wor-
ship for the Varkari Panth religious
community for at least seven hundred
years. Varkari rituals center around a
twice-yearly pilgrimage to Pandharpur,
[[495]]
Pandrenthan
in which the pilgrims all arrive on the
same day. Each pilgrim procession starts
from a different place and is identified
with one of the poet-saints who helped
form the community. At the front of
each procession is a palanquin (palkhi)
bearing the sandals of that group’s par-
ticular saint, who is thus symbolically
leading them into Pandharpur. For more
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; I. B. Karve, “On the
Road,” Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 22,
No. 1, 1962; and Digambar Balkrishna
Mokashi, Palkhi, 1987.
Pandrenthan
Historical site south of the city of
Shrinagar in Kashmir. Pandrenthan is
famous for one of the few old Hindu
temples still standing in Kashmir, a tem-
ple dedicated to the god Shiva built in
the twelfth century C.E. The shrine itself
is fairly small and simple. The floor plan
is basically square, with each side 17.5
feet long and an entrance on each side
giving the temple an open feel. Each
doorway has a gable over it projecting
out from a pyramidal roof known
to builders as a hip roof. The temple
is built entirely of stone but has
overlapping courses, in an attempt to
mimic wooden construction.
Pandu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambalika. Pandu and
his brother Dhrtarashtra are born as the
result of a desperate attempt to preserve
the royal line of King Shantanu after
Shantanu’s son Vichitravirya dies with-
out heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s death, his
mother Satyavati calls upon her eldest
son, Vyasa, to sleep with Vichitravirya’s
wives, Ambika and her sister Ambalika,
in the hope that the women will con-
ceive. According to tradition Vyasa is
very ugly, and each woman reacts invol-
untarily when Vyasa appears in her bed:
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind, and
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
[[496]]

Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion. Given Dhrtarashtra’s
blindness, Pandu is the best suited to
rule; he marries Kunti and Madri and
lives quite happily as the king.
This idyllic time abruptly ends one
day while he is hunting in the forest and
shoots a deer while it is mating. To his
horror, he discovers that the deer is the
sage Kindama, who has taken this form
for sport with his wife; with his dying
breath, the sage curses Pandu that he
will die the moment he touches his wife
in an amorous embrace. Since he has no
children, and the curse condemns him
to die without an heir, Pandu abdicates
the throne in favor of his brother
Dhrtarashtra and goes with his wives to
live as an ascetic in the Himalayas. At
this time Kunti tells him about the
mantra she has received years before
from the sage Durvasas, which gives the
woman who recites it the power to call
down any of the gods and to have by him
a son equal in power to himself. With
Pandu’s blessing Kunti and Madri bear
five heroic sons, the five Pandava broth-
ers. They all live happily together until
one day when Pandu, swayed by the
intoxicating influence of spring, ignores
Madri’s warnings and embraces her. The
sage’s curse takes effect and Pandu falls
dead, although, through the power of
the mantra, his family line continues.
Pandurang
(“pale”) Epithet of the god Vithoba,
whose primary place of worship is in the
holy city of Pandharpur in the state of
Maharashtra. See Vithoba.
Pandya Dynasty
(6th–14th c.) Southern Indian dynasty
whose capital was in the city of Madurai
in the state of Tamil Nadu. The Pandyas
existed as a regional power as early as
the late sixth century, when they fought
the Pallava dynasty of Kanchipuram for
control of the peninsula. The Pandyas at
one time became vassals to the Chola
dynasty when the latter reigned over allPanth
of southern India, but with the decline of
the Cholas the Pandyas became the
dominant regional power, eventually
absorbing the Chola kingdom in 1279. At
their zenith in the thirteenth century the
Pandyas controlled most of the southern
part of India, but were in turn conquered
and annexed early in the fourteenth cen-
tury by the Sangama dynasty, also known
as the Vijayanagar dynasty after their
capital city.
Panguni
Twelfth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Mina (the zodiacal sign of
Pisces), which usually falls within March
and April. This name is a modification of
Phalgun, the twelfth month of the lunar
calendar. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the con-
tinuing importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Pani
A group of northern Indian people men-
tioned in a hymn in the Rg Veda (10.108),
the oldest Hindu religious text. This ref-
erence speaks poorly of this group, since
it portrays them as cattle thieves. The
hymn is spoken as a dialogue between
the Panis and Sarama, the divine dog
who is the servant of the god Indra and
who has been sent by Indra to recover
the cattle the Panis have stolen. This
hymn may refer to an actual incident
and an actual group of people, but it is
impossible to say. Certainly the Vedas
were not written as a strict historical
record, and it is perilous to read them as
such. At the same time, as the earliest
textual records they preserve references
to the culture and to contemporary
times that can be found nowhere else.
Panigrahana
A minor rite, performed in many Hindu
marriages, in which the groom grasps
the bride’s right hand as a symbol of
their impending marital union. See also
marriage customs.
Panini
(4th c. B.C.E.) The greatest Sanskrit
grammarian, whose descriptive account
of that language in his Ashtadhyayi
(“Eight Sections”) became the prescrip-
tive norm for the language in later gen-
erations. Panini was not the earliest
grammarian, since he names several in
his text; his genius lay rather in his skills
as an organizer and systematizer. Each
of the Ashtadhyayi’s eight sections is
written as a series of brief aphorisms
(sutras), each of which provides the
foundation and necessary background
for those that follow. Panini’s use of this
form allowed him to provide a complete
account of the language in the briefest
possible space, and the text’s condensed
form made it easier to memorize. As
with most sutra texts, the Ashtadhyayi’s
terseness of expression presupposes a
commentary, of which the most famous
is the Mahabhashya, written by the
grammarian Patanjali in the second
century B.C.E.
Panth
General term used for a particular reli-
gious community, such as the
Dadupanth, Varkari Panth, or the
Nanak Panth—an older name for the
Sikh community, which has simply been
abridged to “Panth” by contemporary
Sikhs. The word is derived from the
Sanskrit word for “path” and is here
used metaphorically to indicate a fixed
pattern of belief and behavior, often
rooted in a particular individual’s teach-
ings. There is a certain amount of
semantic overlap between the words
panth and sampraday, both of which
denote religious communities, and
there is no hard-and-fast rule dividing
the two. In general, however, the term
[[497]]
Pap
panth is more closely associated with
movements in the sant religious tradi-
tion, which tended toward rebellion
against the prevailing religious estab-
lishment, whereas sampraday is more
commonly applied to groups that
evolved within these established reli-
gious communities.
Pap
(“evil”) A word sometimes used as an
adjective to describe people and
actions, but most often used as a noun,
either to denote a particular deed as evil
or to refer to the collective evil one has
accumulated through the bad deeds in
one’s karmic career. Since, according to
karma theory, all one’s deeds will even-
tually come to fruition, the evil that one
has done is seen as already existing,
even if only in a potential state. The
opposite of pap is punya, the most gen-
eral term denoting religious merit.
Papamochani Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Chaitra (March–April). The name
Papamochani means “freeing from
evil,” and the faithful observance of
this festival is believed to do exactly
that. As with all the eleventh-day
observances, it is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu. Most Hindu festivals
have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship (puja), and often promise spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance.
On this day one should worship Vishnu
with the full complement of the sixteen
upacharas (“offerings”).
Papankusha Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Ashvin (September–October). As with
all the eleventh-day observances, it is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
[[498]]

prescribed rites, which usually involve
fasting (upavasa) and worship (puja),
and often promise specific benefits for
faithful performance. This ekadashi’s
name indicates that it is the goad
(ankusha) to drive away all evil (pap),
here fancifully conceived as an elephant.
Thus, faithfully observing this festival is
believed to cleanse one of all one’s sins.
Parakiya
(“belonging to another”) Particular type
of relationship between lover and
beloved, in which the woman is seen as
married to another person. Parakiya is
said to generate the most intense pas-
sion, since the people pursuing it have
nothing to gain but love itself—if
caught, they risk ridicule and shame,
and in any case their liaison has no real
future. This is not the conventional, safe
love with one’s own spouse (svakiya)
that is sanctioned by marriage, carries
social approval, and usually entails pro-
creation, but rather a dangerous love
pursued solely for pleasure. This type of
relationship is a standard image in
Sanskrit poetry, and is also the domi-
nant theme for describing the relation-
ship between the god Krishna and his
human consort Radha, which is seen as
symbolizing the relationship between
god and the human soul.
Paramahamsa
(“supreme Hamsa”) One of four types of
Hindu ascetic. The four types were
based on their supposed means of liveli-
hood, which in practice has been much
less important for ascetic identity than
sectarian or organizational affiliation.
The Paramahamsa is the most presti-
gious of the four, the others being (in
order of increasing status) Kutichaka,
Bahudaka, and Hamsa. Paramahamsas
have no fixed abode and always live in
an uninhabited place. They are said to
have transcended all questions of reli-
gious duty (dharma), purity, and impu-
rity (ashaucha), to have broken all
attachments to the world, and to beParashara Smrti
continually immersed in contemplation
of the Supreme Brahman.
The word Paramahamsa has a more
specialized meaning among the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetic devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva whose organi-
zation is divided into ten sections, each
designated by a particular name. Here
the name Paramahamsa refers to an
ascetic who comes from one of the
three twice-born (dvija) varnas—that
is, who is a brahmin, kshatriya, or
vaishya, the three social groups with
higher symbolic status—and who has
been initiated as a Sanyasi in one of
the six divisions that will accept non-
brahmins. Paramahamsas have higher
status in these divisions than the Naga
or fighting ascetics, who will initiate
shudras, but lower status than the
Dandis, who are invariably brahmins.
Parashara
In Hindu mythology, a legendary sage
who is the grandson of the sage
Vasishtha. He is credited with authoring
the Parashara Smrti, an important and
early work in the dharma literature.
Parashara is best known as the father of
the sage Vyasa, whom he begets through
a maiden named Satyavati. Satyavati
makes her living ferrying people across
the Ganges River, and although she is a
beautiful young woman, she always
smells of fish because her mother is a
celestial nymph who has been cursed to
live as a fish in the Ganges. Struck by
Satyavati’s beauty while she is ferrying
him across the river, Parashara creates
an artificial fog to give them the privacy
to have sexual intercourse. As a reward,
he gives her the boon that, from that day
onward, she will smell of musk instead
of fish.
Paramatman
(“the highest self”) Term generally used
as a synonym for Brahman, the unqual-
ified and undifferentiated reality that is
seen as the source of all things, and the
sole true power in the universe. This
name, through its inclusion of the Self
(atman) as part of the term, also empha-
sizes the identity in kind between
Brahman and atman, between Supreme
Reality and the individual Self.
Parampara
(“succession”) The general term for
the spiritual lineage maintained by
the
transmission
of
knowledge
and power from guru to disciple.
Such lineages form the basis for
tracing spiritual descent within
religious communities, particularly
in secret traditions such as tantra.
In a religious context, one’s spiritual
lineage is an important factor in
establishing an identity and connec-
tions with others in the school, in the
same way a biological lineage places one
within a family.
Parashara Smrti
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed impor-
tant but less authoritative than the other
textual category, the shrutis, or “heard”
texts. This smrti is ascribed to the sage
Parashara, and is an example of one of
the Dharma Shastras, which were man-
uals prescribing rules for correct human
behavior and ideal social life. Unlike the
Dharma Sutras, which are ascribed to
recognizable individuals, the Dharma
Shastras are usually ascribed to mythic
sages as a strategy to reinforce the
authority of these texts. At 592 verses,
the Parashara Smrti is relatively short,
and it treats only two themes, religious
custom (achara) and expiation
(prayashchitta). The text is estimated
to have been written between the
first and fifth centuries, but in the four-
teenth century it received an extensive
commentary by Madhava, and the
resulting work, known as the
Parasharamadhava, has continued to
be influential since then.
[[499]]
Parashu
The god Vishnu’s Parashuram avatar, carrying his
battle-axe. He appears in this form to punish the
warrior class’ abuse of power.
Parashu
(“battle-axe”) A characteristic object in
Hindu iconography, and one that
appears in various forms—sometimes
with a very light, thin handle and a larger
head, at other times with a handle the
size of a club (gada) and a very small,
thin head. This weapon has the
strongest mythic associations with
Vishnu’s sixth avatar or incarnation,
Parashuram, who uses it in his war of
extermination against the the ruling
kshatriya class when their pride has
grown too strong. The battle-axe is also
commonly carried by the god Ganesh
and signifies his power to cut through
obstacles and impediments. It also com-
monly appears in various images of the
deities Shiva, Vishnu, and the Goddess,
as one among their galaxy of weapons.
Parashuram Avatar
Sixth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu. As with all the avatars of Vishnu,
[[500]]

the Parashuram avatar comes to restore
a cosmic equilibrium that has been
thrown out of balance, in this case from
the overweening abuse of power by the
warrior (kshatriya) class. Parashuram is
the son of Jamadagni, a brahmin sage
whose most precious possession is
Surabhi, a cow that will grant its owner
any desired wish. One day when
Parashuram is away, the king comes to
Jamadagni’s ashram. When he sees the
cow, he desires it, and when Jamadagni
refuses to give it to him, the king takes it
by force.
When Parashuram learns of this, he
becomes fiercely angry. Taking up his
parashu (or battle-axe, a weapon partic-
ularly associated with him), he enters
into battle with the king and eventually
kills him. When the king’s sons remain
rebellious in opposition to him,
Parashuram makes twenty-one journeys
around India, destroying all of the ksha-
triyas that he can find, in an effort to
wipe them from the face of the earth.
The major theme of this story is the con-
flict between the brahmin and kshatriya
classes, and the realities of living in a
society in which brahmins had religious
authority but kshatriyas had the power
of enforcement. This story reveals a
strong concern for the sanctity of a
brahmin’s possessions and highlights
the perils of taking them by force. The
writers behind the story were almost
certainly brahmins, and their remarks
on the perils of taking a brahmin’s pos-
sessions doubtless reflect an insecurity
about their ability to supersede govern-
mental power.
In addition to the story of extermi-
nating the kshatriyas, Parashuram
appears in the epic Mahabharata as the
person who teaches the heroic Karna
the art of weapons and warfare. The epic
portrays Parashuram as powerful and
irascible, and as possessing such contin-
uing hatred of kshatriyas that he refuses
to take them as students. When
Parashuram discovers that Karna is a
kshatriya and not a brahmin, as he
has claimed to be, he lays a curse on
Karna that, in his hour of greatestParinamavada
need, he will forget everything he has
learned as his student.
Parashurameshvar Temple
Temple constructed about 750 C.E. in
the city of Bhubaneshvar in the state
of Orissa, dedicated to the god Shiva
in his aspect as the “Lord of
Parashuram.” This title refers to
Parashuram’s long period of asceti-
cism, in which he worshiped Shiva as
his chosen deity and was rewarded
with Shiva’s grace. The temple is an
early example of the Orissan variant
of the northern Indian Nagara temple
style. The Nagara style emphasizes
verticality, with the whole temple
building culminating in a single high
point, and the Orissan variant of this
style has a single enormous tower
(deul) over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, with shorter subsidiary
buildings leading up to it. The
Parashurameshvar temple is the first
example of this basic pattern—a low,
flat assembly hall (jagamohan), fol-
lowed by a much taller and narrower
tower (deul), in this case about forty
feet high. Although later Orissan tem-
ples are much larger—some of the
deuls tower over 200 feet—and often
include additional buildings and struc-
tures, they all retain this basic pattern.
Parashuram Jayanti
Festival marking the birthday of
Parashuram avatar, Vishnu’s sixth
avatar. This takes place on the third
day of the bright (waxing) half of the
lunar month of Baisakh (April–May),
the same day as the festival of
Akshaya Trtiya.
Parikshit
Mythic king in the Lunar Line, who
serves as an example that one’s fate can-
not be escaped. Parikshit is the grand-
son of Arjuna, one of the five Pandava
brothers who are the protagonists in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics.
Parikshit inherits the throne from
Yudhishthira, Arjuna’s elder brother,
and according to tradition rules right-
eously for sixty years, but it is his death
that is best remembered. Fond of hunt-
ing, Parikshit one day comes across a
meditating sage while he is chasing a
wounded deer. When the sage refuses to
answer to his inquiries about the deer,
Parikshit grows angry and, with his bow,
drapes a dead cobra around the sage’s
neck. The sage remains unaware of this,
but his son finds out about it when his
playmates jeer at him. Furious, the son
lays a curse that the person responsible
will be fatally bitten within seven days
by the great serpent Takshaka. When he
discovers that the king is responsible,
the son repents his curse to the King.
Parikshit takes all possible precau-
tions to avoid his fate. He builds a house
on a huge pillar, has anything brought
into the house carefully searched, and
surrounds himself with physicians who
can cure snakebite. After six days with-
out incident, the king begins to relax his
vigilance. As the seventh day is ending,
Takshaka conceals himself as a worm in
a piece of fruit, changes into his real
shape when the fruit is cut open, and
bites the king, killing him.
Parinamavada
(“transformation-relationship”) Philo-
sophical perspective that explains the
relationship between the Ultimate
Reality or realities and the perceivable
world, and describes the world as a gen-
uine transformation of this reality.
This position is espoused by propo-
nents of the Samkhya, Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta, and Bhedabhada philo-
sophical schools. All three of these are
proponents of a causal model called
satkaryavada. The satkaryavada model
assumes that effects preexist in their
causes, and that, when these effects
appear, they are transformations (pari-
nama) of those causes. The classic
example for this model is the transfor-
mation of milk to curds, butter, and clar-
ified butter: each of these effects was
[[501]]
Parivartini Ekadashi
already present in the cause, emerges
from it through a natural transformation
of that cause, and is causally related to it.
All three schools believe that the
world as perceived is real and has some
single ultimate source behind it: for the
Samkhyas, the first principles are
purusha and prakrti, for the
Vishishthadvaita school, the god
Vishnu, and for the Bhedabhada school,
Brahman. All believe that real things
come into being because these first
principles undergo real transforma-
tions. Parinamavada allows for an expla-
nation of the phenomenal world that
compromises the transcendence of
these first principles by making them
part of the world. Philosophically, their
difficulties arise in describing how the
transcendent can become mundane,
and then become transcendent again.
The transformation relationship is
vehemently opposed by the Advaita
Vedanta philosophical school, which
upholds a philosophical position
known as monism (the belief that a
single Ultimate Reality lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of that reality). Advaita
proponents claim that reality is non-
dual (advaita)—that is, that all things
are “actually” the formless, unquali-
fied Brahman, despite the appearance
of difference and diversity in the
world. Since Brahman is the only real
thing, and Brahman never changes,
the parinama model is a fundamental
misunderstanding of the ultimate
nature of things, since it assumes real
change. The Advaita proponents’
explanation for the nature of the rela-
tionship and the world is known as
vivartavada (“illusory manifesta-
tion”), in which the ultimate appears
to become transformed but in reality
never changes. For further informa-
tion see Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook
in Indian Philosophy, 1957; and Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
[[502]]

Parivartini Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month of
Bhadrapada (August–September). As are
all the eleventh-day observances, this is
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu. This
day is particularly devoted to the wor-
ship of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi, the god-
dess presiding over wealth and
prosperity. In her form as Mahalakshmi
(as told in the Devimahatmya) she is
able to kill demons that the gods cannot,
and restore to gods the kingdom they
have lost. This festival occurs during the
time Vishnu is believed to be sleeping on
the serpent Shesha, on an ocean of milk,
with Lakshmi massaging his feet. The
name Parivartini means “turning,” and
on this day Vishnu is believed to be stir-
ring in his sleep. See also ocean, churn-
ing of the; and cosmology.
Parivrajaka
(from Sanskrit parivraj, “to wander
about”) A term that can be used to
denote any wandering religious mendi-
cant. Continual wandering is a very old
Indian ascetic practice. It shows the
conscious renunciation of the fixed and
stable world of the householder, partic-
ularly in earlier societies, and it prevents
the wanderer from forming any sort of
attachments, even to places. This exem-
plifies the fourth and final stage of life
found in the dharma literature, the
sanyasi, in which a person has
renounced all attachments of everyday
life to search for spiritual attainment.
Parmananddas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devotees
(bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight
are also named as members of the com-
munity and as associates of either theParvati
community’s founder, Vallabhacharya,
or his successor Vitthalnath. Little is
known about Parmananddas himself,
although tradition asserts that he was a
Kanaujia brahmin, and the corpus of
poetry attributed to him is much larger
in later sources, suggesting that his
name was used by later writers. The evi-
dence from the earliest sources suggests
that he was a devoted follower of
Vallabhacharya. Much of his poetry is
specifically written for the Pushti Marg,
such as hymns in praise of
Vallabhacharya, or hymns to be sung for
the worship of Krishna throughout the
day, a form of piety that came to charac-
terize the Pushti Marg. To date, his
works have not been translated, perhaps
because of their sectarian character.
Parvana
A particular type of the memorial rites
for the dead known as shraddhas. A par-
vana shraddha can be performed at spe-
cific times throughout the year, such as
the new moon, but is most commonly
performed during the Fortnight of the
Fathers (Pitrpaksha), which falls during
the waning moon in the lunar month of
Bhadrapada. Whereas an ekoddishta
shraddha is performed for any particu-
lar deceased individual, the parvana
shraddha invokes first the paternal
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,
then the same ancestors on the mother’s
side. The rite is performed to give bene-
fits to all of these ancestors, although
the father’s ancestors are considered the
primary recipients.
Parvata Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. The Dashanamis were supposedly
established by the ninth century
philosopher Shankaracharya, in an
effort create a corps of learned men
who could help to revitalize Hindu
life. Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case,
parvata (“mountain”). Upon initiation,
new members are given this name
as a surname to their new ascetic
names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths) sup-
posedly established by Shankaracharya.
The Parvata Dashanamis belong to the
Anandawara group, which is affiliated
with the Jyotir math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath.
Parvati
(“daughter of the mountain”) Wife of
the god Shiva, and an important
Hindu goddess, Parvati is the daughter
of the minor deity Himalaya (the
Himalaya Mountains personified), and
his wife Mena. Parvati appears in
human form to draw Shiva out of the
ascetic isolation in which he has been
lost since the death of his first wife,
Sati, and to induce him to father the
son necessary to kill the demon
Taraka. According to her myths, even
in her childhood Parvati vows that she
will have only Shiva for her husband.
Her parents try to discourage her,
since Shiva has taken a vow of asceti-
cism and is absorbed in deep medita-
tion on Mount Kailas.
Parvati’s first effort to arouse Shiva’s
desire ends in a dismal failure. Kama,
the god of love, tries to shoot Shiva with
an arrow of desire, but Shiva lets loose a
stream of fire from the third eye in his
forehead, burning Kama to ash.
Undeterred, Parvati goes into the moun-
tains and begins a program of harsh
physical asceticism (tapas) of her own:
standing on one foot for immense peri-
ods of time, enduring the heat of sum-
mer and cold of winter, and practicing
severe fasting (upavasa) and self-denial.
The spiritual power generated by her
asceticism eventually awakens Shiva,
and he comes to her, disguised as an
aged brahmin. He tries to discourage
[[503]]
Parvati
Parvati with her husband Shiva and their sons Ganesh and Skanda.
Parvati by making disparaging remarks
about Shiva’s lifestyle and personality, but
Parvati, unshaken in her resolve, refuses
to listen. Eventually Shiva reveals his true
form to her, and they are married.
Although in his devotion to his wife
Shiva is the Hindu symbol for the ideal
[[504]]

husband, their family life is unusual.
Since Shiva is the symbol for the perfect
ascetic, the couple has no fixed home or
means of support, and occasionally
Parvati is portrayed as complaining of
being an ascetic’s wife. Symbolically, their
marriage represents the domestication ofPashupati
the ascetic and his entrance into social
and family life. Their union highlights
the cultural tension between the two
most important Hindu religious ideals:
the householder and the renunciant
ascetic. Perhaps to illustrate the contra-
diction of being a married ascetic, Shiva
and Parvati have children but not in the
normal way: Skanda develops from
Shiva’s semen, which falls on the ground
during their interrupted love-making,
while Ganesh is formed of the enlivened
dirt from Parvati’s body.
Parvati, as with all married Hindu
goddesses, is generally seen as benign
and benevolent. In some mythic stories
she can be spiteful, but on the whole she
projects a nurturing and motherly pres-
ence. Her mythology is almost com-
pletely connected with that of Shiva,
showing her subordination as the model
wife, and her worship is generally con-
nected with him as well. She occupies
an important position in tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
since in tantric texts Parvati is usually
portrayed as the person questioning
Shiva and then as the student receiving
his instruction. For more information
on Parvati and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Paryanka
(“bedstead”) One of the postures
(asanas) described in commentaries to
the Yoga Sutras, in which the person is
lying down with the arms stretched
around the knees.
Pasha
(“noose”) In Indian iconography, one of
the weapons carried by some of the
divinities, especially Ganesh and Yama.
For Ganesh, as the “Lord of Obstacles,”
the noose signifies his ability to bind
(and release) obstacles, whereas Yama,
the god of death, uses the noose to draw
the soul from the body at the time of
death. In the Shaiva Siddhanta religious
community, pasha is also the name
given to Shiva’s power of illusion (maya),
through which he entraps and enthralls
unenlightened people (pashu). The triad
of pasha, pashu, and Shiva as lord (pati)
are the defining features of the Shaiva
Siddhanta school.
Pashu
(“beast”) In the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, and in the
secret, ritually based religious practice
known as tantra, the term for an unen-
lightened person, who is said to have a
human form but to be little better than
an animal. This lack of awareness
comes not just through inherent dull-
ness, but through the activity of maya,
the power of illusion wielded by Shiva
as lord (pati). The triad of pashu, pati
and the bonds of illusion (pasha) are
defining features of the Shaiva
Siddhanta school.
Pashupata
An extinct ascetic community, of devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva in his
form as Pashupati, “the Lord of Beasts.”
Although the Pashupatas have now dis-
appeared, according to the Chinese pil-
grim Hsuan Tsang they were once the
most important ascetic sect in northern
India. According to historical reports, its
members would engage in strange and
antisocial behavior intended to bring
disgrace upon themselves, although
without lust or malice in their hearts.
This practice was in imitation of one of
Shiva’s mythic tales, in which he
exposed himself to the wives of the
Sages in the Pine Forest but was without
desire for them. For further information
see Daniel H. H. Ingalls, “Cynics and
Pasupatas: The Seeking of Dishonor,” in
Harvard Theological Review, 55, 1962.
Pashupati
(“Lord of Beasts”) Epithet of the god
Shiva in his form as the “Lord of Beasts.”
See Shiva.
[[505]]
Pashupatinath
The Pashupatinath Temple in Katmandu, Nepal, is dedicated to the god Shiva
as “Master of the Lord of the Beasts.”
[[506]]

PashupatinathPatala
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in
Katmandu, Nepal. The temple is named
for its presiding deity, who is the god
Shiva in his form as Pashupatinath, “the
Master of the Lord of Beasts.” This is a
considered an extremely powerful site,
and one of its charter myths connects it
to Kedarnath, a sacred site high in the
Himalayas. According to the story, the
five Pandava brothers, who are the pro-
tagonists in the epic Mahabharata, are
making their final journey into the
Himalayas in search of a vision of
Shiva. They finally see him at a dis-
tance, but when they try to get closer,
Shiva takes the form of a bull and
begins running through the snow. The
bull burrows into a snow bank, and
when the Pandavas follow, they find the
body of the bull in the snow. The ridge
of rock that forms the Kedarnath linga
is considered to be the hump of this
bull. The bull’s head continues travel-
ing over the hills, eventually stopping
in Nepal, where it takes form as the
deity Pashupatinath.A generic name for the realms of the
underworld, traditionally numbered at
seven to parallel the seven heavens that
are believed to exist above the visible
world. These underworld realms are not
considered to be hells but rather planes
of existence other than the visible world,
populated by the Nagas and other non-
human beings.
Pataliputra
Capital city of the Mauryan empire,
identified with modern Patna, the
capital of Bihar state. See also
Maurya dynasty.
Patanjali
(2nd c. B.C.E.) Sanskrit grammarian
and author of the Mahabhashya
(“Great Commentary”) on Panini’s
Ashtadhyayi. Panini’s text was written
as a series of short phrases or aphorisms
intended to be a complete description of
the language in the briefest possible
space. Panini’s text was a marvel of
economy and was easy to memorize butPattuppattu
was so cryptic that it virtually presup-
posed a commentary, which Patanjali
provided. Patanjali’s Mahabhashya
is not only important for his explication
of Panini’s grammar, but also because
his examples often provide useful
historical information.
Patanjali is also the person named
as the author of the Yoga Sutras, but
since these are believed to have been
composed several centuries after
the Mahabhashya, the authors are
believed to be two different people
with the same name.
Pati
(“master”) In the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, the name
given to the god Shiva as the highest
being, who wields the noose (pasha) of
illusion to enthrall and bewilder unen-
lightened people (pashu). The triad of
pashu, pati and pasha are the defining
features of the Shaiva Siddhanta school.
Patita
(“fallen one”) In the dharma literature,
the term for someone who had commit-
ted one of the Four Great Crimes; mur-
dering a brahmin (brahmahatya),
stealing a brahmin’s gold (steya), drink-
ing liquor (surapana), and adultery
with one’s guru’s wife (gurutalpaga).
These crimes were considered so
heinous that the performer became an
outcast from society. Another indication
of the gravity of these acts was that their
expiations (prayashchitta) were so
severe they normally ended in death,
and in some cases this outcome was
specifically prescribed. Aside from pre-
scribing such punishments for the actual
offenders, the dharma literature also
prescribed similar outcast status for
anyone who knowingly associated with
such people for more than one year.
Pattadakal
Pattadakal was an important urban cen-
ter and a sister city to the Chalukya cap-
ital at Badami. Although nearly deserted
today, the site is important for a collec-
tion of temples built in a variety of archi-
tectural styles during that era. The
Virupaksha temple, dedicated in 740 C.E.
during the reign of King Vikramaditya,
clearly shows the influence of the south-
ern Indian Dravida architectural style: a
mostly low and extended profile, with a
series of terraced roofs over the main
sanctuary. It is believed to have been
modeled after the temples in the city of
Kanchipuram, which had been con-
quered by Vikramaditya, who brought
its architects and builders back to
Pattadakal with him. At the same time,
there are temples showing the early
development of the Nagara style, in
which the major architectural feature is
a series of upswept towers (shikharas),
with the tallest tower directly over the
image of the temple’s primary deity. The
best example of this is the Galaganatha
temple, dedicated to the god Shiva,
which has a tall vertical tower perched
on a larger, cube-shaped base.
Pattuppattu
(“Ten Songs”) Collective name for a
group of ten Tamil poems written in
the style of the eight anthologies of
the Sangam literature and believed to
have been composed later. The dates
for the literature are the subject of con-
troversy, but the prevalent scholarly
consensus is that it was written in the
early centuries of the common era. Like
this literature, the Pattuppattu songs
fall into two general genres, puram (“the
outer part”) and akam (“the inner part”).
Puram poetry was “public” verse,
describing the deeds of kings, war,
death, and other heroic actions, whereas
akam poetry was about an individual’s
inner experience, especially love and
sexuality. See also Tamil language and
Tamil epics.
Historical site in the state of Karnataka,
about twenty miles east of the city of
Badami. During the Chalukya dynasty,

Paush
PaushPerception
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Paush is the tenth month in
the lunar year, usually falling within
December and January. In northern
India, Paush is the coldest month of the
year. It is considered inauspicious, and
its only holidays are Saphala Ekadashi
and Putrada Ekadashi.In Hindu philosophy, perception
(pratyaksha) is universally accepted as
one of the pramanas, the means by
which human beings can gain true
and accurate knowledge. Perception
is the only pramana accepted by all
the schools, but most of the others
also accept inference (anumana)
and authoritative testimony (shabda).
See pratyaksha.
Peacock
Indian bird with several divine associa-
tions. It is the animal vehicle of the god
Skanda, the son of Shiva, who is the
leader of the divine armies. The pea-
cock’s quickness and resplendent
appearance are felt to mirror these qual-
ities in the young god. The peacock also
has strong associations with the god
Krishna, who is usually depicted as
wearing a decorative crown containing
peacock feathers. This association may
come from the peacock’s connection
with the monsoon, which is the peacock
mating season, during which they utter
piercing calls in the forests and are
believed to dance with delight on the
hillsides. Krishna’s dark color often leads
to comparisons with rain clouds, and
like the peacock he spends his nights
dancing in the company of his devotees
(bhakta), in the celebration known as
the ras lila.
Penance
The dharma literature gave consider-
able attention to penance and expiation,
based on the almost universal Hindu
belief in the inexorable workings of
karma. According to this notion, all
good and bad deeds would eventually
have their effect, either in this life or the
next. Penances were a way to lessen the
future consequences of one’s past mis-
deeds, by undergoing voluntary suffer-
ing and expiation in one’s present life.
See prayashchitta.
[[508]]

Periyalvar
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. The Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
stress on passionate devotion (bhakti)
to a personal god, conveyed through
hymns sung in the Tamil language,
transformed and revitalized Hindu reli-
gious life.
According to tradition, Periyalvar
was born into a brahmin family. From
his youth he showed deep piety, and his
primary means of devotion was to grow
and pick flowers for the image of his
chosen deity, Krishna. The most
famous story about Periyalvar tells of a
dream in which God commanded him to
take part in a scholarly debate to be held
by one of the Pandya kings. Periyalvar,
despite his reservations about his lack
of learning, obeyed this command after
he woke. When he spoke, the words
flowed out under divine inspiration, and
the bag containing the prize money flew
off the hook and into his hands as a sign
of his victory. For further information
see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature,
[[1975]]
; and John Stirling Morley Hooper,
Hymns of the Alvars, 1929. See also
Pandya dynasty.
Periya Puranam
Hagiographical account of the lives of
the sixty-three Nayanars, written by the
twelfth-century figure Cekkilar. The
Nayanars were a group of Shaiva poet-
saints, who lived in southern IndiaPhallic Emblem
between the seventh and ninth cen-
turies. Together with their Vaishnava
counterparts, the Alvars, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu
religion within Tamil Nadu, which was
mostly Buddhist and Jain. Both the
Nayanars and the Alvars stressed pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god—Shiva for the Nayanars, Vishnu for
the Alvars—and conveyed this devotion
through hymns sung in the Tamil lan-
guage. According to tradition, Cekkilar
was a minister at the court of the Chola
dynasty king Kullottunga II (r. 1130–50).
Cekkilar, distressed by the king’s admi-
ration for a Jain epic poem, composed
his text in an effort to wean the king
away from it. His text portrays these
saints as models of devotion to Shiva
and as salutary examples to others
although at times extreme in their devo-
tion. One example of this intense devo-
tion is Kotpuli Nayanar, who killed his
entire family when he discovered that,
in order to save their lives in a time of
famine, they had eaten rice that
belonged to Shiva’s temple. Although
this is an extreme case, the message is
clearly that devotion to God must
eclipse all other loyalties.
Peshwa
Originally, title given to the brahmin
ministers who served as advisers to the
kings in the Maratha empire.
Traditionally, these ministers were
Chitpavan brahmins, which gave this
small group influence far disproportion-
ate to its numbers. During the resur-
gence of the Maratha confederacy in the
early eighteenth century, the Peshwas
became de facto rulers, although they
continued to govern in the name of the
Maratha kings. At this time, the position
of Peshwa became hereditary. After the
Maratha confederation split into differ-
ent royal states around 1770, the
Peshwas retained control over the
ancestral Maratha homeland in the
western part of the state of
Maharashtra, where they reigned until
it was conquered by the British in 1818.
Pey
(7th c.) With Bhutam and Poygai, one of
the first three Alvars, a group of twelve
poet-saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All Alvars were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu, and their stress on
passionate devotion (bhakti) to a per-
sonal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, transformed
and revitalized Hindu religious life.
According to tradition, the three men
were caught in a torrential storm and
one by one took shelter in a small dry
spot, with each making room for the
next. As they stood next to one another
they felt a fourth presence, that of
Vishnu. The Alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy was
sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s manifesta-
tion. Overwhelmed with ecstasy, each
burst into song, which formed the first of
each of their compositions. For further
information see Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil
Literature, 1975.
Phalgun
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Phalgun is the twelfth
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within February and March. Phalgun
concludes with the festival of Holi,
which is the unofficial end of the cool
season. The other holidays in Phalgun
are Janaki Navami, Vijaya Ekadashi,
Shivaratri, and Amalaki Ekadashi.
Phallic Emblem
Designation for the linga, the pillar-
shaped object that is the symbolic form
of the god Shiva. The precise sculptural
form of the Gudimallam linga, which
dates from at least the second century
B.C.E., leaves little doubt that this phallic
element is one aspect of the symbol.
What is often overlooked is that an
equally important part of the linga’s
image is the base (pitha) in which
the shaft is placed, said to represent
the female organs of generation. In his
[[509]]
Philosophy
symbolic form Shiva is thus both male
and female—an appropriate form for a
deity who is famous for transcending
any and all duality.
Philosophy
The Euro-American conception that
there is a fundamental distinction
between philosophy and religion
reflects unique historical and cultural
circumstances that have no parallel in
many other cultures. The Western philo-
sophical tradition is rooted in Greek
thought and culture, whereas Western
religious traditions primarily have been
shaped by ideas coming out of the
Jewish tradition. The ideas from these
two different sources developed side by
side in Western culture, sometimes in an
uneasy alliance and sometimes at odds
but they were always seen as separate. In
many other cultures, this distinction does
not exist, and such imported concepts
become less helpful in encountering
these cultures. Indian and Hindu culture
have a long history of critical and specula-
tive thought, which could be called philo-
sophical. Yet such thought is never
exercised simply for its own sake, but
always with an underlying religious pur-
pose—to enable one to gain the ultimate
religious goal, final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The different perspectives on
how to do this, known as darshans, are
usually designated as “philosophical
schools.” See also six schools.
Although these edicts were found in
widely separated places, the text in each
edict was fairly consistent throughout
the Mauryan empire. The pillar edicts
were inscribed on pillars of polished
Chunar sandstone and placed on the
major roads running through the
empire, where they would have been
visible to passersby. In this respect they
were different from the rock edicts,
which were carved into large boulders in
places near the borders of the Mauryan
empire, thus symbolically defining its
boundaries. See also Maurya dynasty.
Pinaka
In Hindu mythology, the name of the
archery bow belonging to the god Shiva.
Pinda
(“lump”) A ball of cooked rice or other
grain, one of the important objects used
in rites for the dead. A pinda is offered to
the departed spirit each day for the first
ten days after death, in the belief that
the ten pindas progressively help form a
new body for the dead person (a sec-
ondary meaning of the word pinda is
“body”). Pindas are also used in the
memorial rite known as shraddha,
which can be performed years after the
actual death; in this rite, the performer
offers pindas to his or her ancestors as
symbolic nourishment.

Pillar Edicts
Set of inscriptions commissioned by the
Mauryan emperor Ashoka (r. 269–32
B.C.E.), containing official pronounce-
ments on royal policy, and advice and
instructions to his subjects on a variety
of topics, including religious toleration.
[[510]]

(“giving pindas”) In general usage, a syn-
onym for the memorial rite known as
shraddha. It is given this name because
an important element in shraddha is
offering the balls of cooked grain,
known as pindas, considered symbolic
nourishment for the ancestors.
Pindara River
A Himalayan tributary of the Ganges.
The Pindara River flows west from the
Pindari glacier and joins the
Alakananda River at the town of
Karnaprayag. As with all the HimalayanPitha
tributaries of the Ganges, the Pindara is
considered sacred along its length, but
this region is so mountainous and so
thinly settled that Karnaprayag is the
river’s only noteworthy spot.
Pingala Nadi
One of the vertical channels (nadi) in
the traditional conception of the subtle
body. The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system believed to exist on
a different plane than gross matter, but
with certain correspondences to the
material body. It is visualized as a set of
six psychic centers (chakras) running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three parallel vertical
channels. Above and below these cen-
ters are the bodily abodes of the two
divine principles, Shiva (awareness) and
Shakti (power), the latter as the latent
spiritual energy known as kundalini. In
this model of the subtle body, the pin-
gala nadi is the vertical channel on the
right side of the body. As with the rest of
the subtle body, the pingala nadi has
certain symbolic correspondences; in
particular, it is identified with the sun
and is thus visualized as being a tawny
red in color.
goddess Bhavani (an epithet of Parvati),
showing the breadth of the Sant tradi-
tion. A few of Pipa’s verses have been
preserved in the Adigranth, the sacred
text of the Sikh community, and in their
language and religious thrust the verses
are consistent with these traditions.
Pipal
Common name for Ficus religiosa, the
fig-tree also known as the ashvattha,
which has a long history of being con-
sidered a sacred tree. See ashvattha.
Pippalada
In Hindu traditional lore, one of the
ancient sages in the Atharva Veda, one
of the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Pippalada is also mentioned in the
Prashna Upanishad, one of the specula-
tive religious texts that forms the latest
part of the Vedas, as a religious teacher
who instructs sages such as Sukesha,
Kashyapa, and Bhargava. Pippalada
supposedly gets his name from his
fondness for Pippali fruits, the fruit
of the Ficus religiosa, the sacred pipal
(ashvattha).
Pitambara
Pipa
(15th c.?) Poet-saint in the Sant religious
community. The name Sant is an
umbrella term for a group of central and
northern Indian poet-saints who share
several general tendencies: focus on
individualized, interior religion leading
to a personal experience of the divine;
disdain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of
repeating one’s patron deity’s name; and
the tendency to ignore conventional
caste distinctions.
According to tradition, Pipa was born
into a Rajput royal family in the Malwa
region but eventually renounced his
throne and went to Benares to become a
disciple of the poet-saint Ramananda.
The hagiographer Nabhadas reports
that Pipa was a disciple of the powerful
(“clothed in yellow”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, because of his penchant for
wearing yellow garments. See Krishna.
Pitavasana
(“yellow-clad”) Epithet of the god
Krishna, because of his penchant for
wearing yellow garments. See Krishna.
Pitha
(“bench”) In its widest meaning, the
base or foundation of any object. It can
denote the material base or foundation
upon which the image of a deity is
placed. In some cases the foundation
becomes an integral part of the image
itself, as in the linga, the pillar-shaped
object that is the symbol of the god
Shiva. The form of the linga, an upright
[[511]]
Pitr
During Pitrpaksha, Hindus offer rice balls and water to their ancestors.
shaft set in a horizontal base, represents,
not only the union of male and female,
but also their transcendence, since
Shiva is both male and female at once.
At a more symbolic level, a pitha can be
the “seat” or residence of a particular
deity, that is, the place at which the deity
metaphorically sits. The best example of
this is the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites sacred to the Goddess, spread
throughout the subcontinent. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking up residence in each
place as a different goddess.
Pitr
(“father”) Any and all ancestral spirits,
to whom funerary offerings are due as
one of a man’s expected duties. See
ancestral spirits.
Pitrpaksha
The fortnight (paksha) dedicated to the
worship of the ancestral spirits (pitr),
observed in the dark (waning) half of the
[[512]]

lunar month of Ashvin. This is the period
during the year in which Hindus
remember and give offerings for their
dead: offerings of water and rice-balls
(pinda) on each day of the fortnight, and
as well as special observances on the
day of the fortnight corresponding to
the day of the ancestor’s death. These
offerings are believed to sustain the
dead by symbolically feeding them, and
also to placate the dead by demonstrat-
ing that the living still remember and
care for them.
Because of its strong connection
with the dead, this fortnight is generally
considered an inauspicious time, and
people often restrict their everyday
activities in symbolic recognition of it.
Many people will not cut their hair,
beards, or nails during this time, nor will
they wear new clothes. These precau-
tions stem from the conviction that
making alterations in one’s appearance
during an inauspicious time will have
adverse future affects, since it will carry
the taint forward. Many people also cur-
tail other normal activities during thisPlanets
time, such as buying any article or initi-
ating any new project, unless it is
absolutely necessary. The period is also
deemed a good time for religious obser-
vances, particularly giving gifts (dana)
to brahmins. On the one hand this is a
way to propitiate the ancestors, whom
the brahmins represent, and thus what-
ever is given to brahmins is given sym-
bolically to the ancestors. On the other
hand, giving such gifts is also a rite of
protection against misfortune in an
inauspicious time, since the receiver is
believed to take away the bad luck along
with the gift.
Pitryajna
(“sacrifice to the ancestors”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahayajna)
prescribed in the dharma literature, the
texts on religious duty. These Five Great
Sacrifices are daily observances for a
“twice-born” householder, that is, one
who has been born into one of the three
“twice-born” groups in Indian society—
brahmin, kshatriya, or vaishya—and
who has received the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” Each of the five sacrifices (yajna)
is directed toward a different class of
beings—from the Absolute Reality down
to animals—and is satisfied by different
actions. The pitryajna is directed toward
one’s ancestors, and is satisfied by offer-
ing them libations of water (tarpana). In
the time since the dharma literature was
composed Hindu life has undergone
significant changes, and some of these
five rites have been completely elided.
Although in certain contexts pitryajna is
still an important rite—particularly at
pilgrimage sites and in formal rites for
the dead—it is no longer performed on a
daily basis.
Pitta
(“bile”) Along with vata (“air”) and
kapha (“phlegm”), one of the three
humours (tridosha) in ayurveda, or
traditional Indian medicine. Every per-
son has all three of these humours, but
usually one is predominant, and this
marks a person in certain ways, particu-
larly with regard to health, digestion,
and metabolism. Pitta is associated with
the elements of fire and water, since
bile is a liquid involved in digestion,
which is believed to take place through
interior burning. Pitta is hot, intense,
and mobile, and those for whom this is
the predominant humor are said to have
a strong will, be good leaders, and be
blessed with good digestion. At the same
time, this inner fire gives them bodily
difficulties in hot weather, and to do
their best they must also learn how to
harness their fiery temperaments.
Plakshadvipa
In traditional mythic geography, the sec-
ond of the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
See also cosmology.
Planets
Indian astrology (jyotisha) recognizes
nine planets that affect human beings:
the five visible ones (Jupiter, Venus,
Mercury, Saturn, and Mars), the Sun
and Moon, and two planets not known
to Western astrology, Rahu and Ketu. Of
these, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury are,
by themselves, always benevolent. The
moon is changeable, depending on its
position in the lunar cycle, and the oth-
ers are considered to have malefic ten-
dencies, although only Rahu and Ketu
are invariably malevolent. Rahu and
Ketu move throughout the zodiac, but
the others are all fixed in place. Each of
the planets is part of an elaborate series
of associations, including parts of the
body, family relationships, and personal
qualities. The influence of all these
planets can be heightened or weakened
according to their position in a person’s
natal horoscope, or their position vis-à-
vis the other planets. The astrological
tradition also recognizes a practice
known as pacification of planets,
through which their good qualities
can be heightened, or their malevolent
[[513]]
Pole Star
qualities weakened and contained. This
can be done either through wearing par-
ticular gemstones that are believed to
correspond to these planets, or by per-
forming certain protective rituals.
Pole Star
In Hindu mythology, the personified
form of the boy Dhruva, who is a symbol
for unrelenting pursuit of a goal. Dhruva
is a king’s son, but for some unknown
reason his father favors Dhruva’s half-
brother over him. Distressed by this
insult, Dhruva takes a vow to attain a
place above all others and goes off to the
forest to perform austerities (tapas).
After Dhruva endures many bodily mor-
tifications, the god Vishnu appears and
grants him a boon. In response to
Dhruva’s request for a place above all
others, Vishnu promises Dhruva that
after his death he will be installed as the
Pole Star, the pivot around which all the
other stars in the sky will turn.
Pollution
In Hindu religious life, a term designat-
ing religious contamination and ritual
impurity (ashaucha). This notion of
impurity is strictly concerned with the
presence or absence of contamination
and carries no necessary sense of moral
or ethical lapse. See ashaucha.
Polyandry
Having more than one husband. This
practice is extremely uncommon in
Indian society, either now or in the past.
The best-known mythical example
comes from the epic Mahabharata, in
which Draupadi is married to all five of
the Pandava brothers, the epic’s protag-
onists. Textual scholars have argued that
this type of marriage was so unusual
that it must have been rooted in some
ancient practice, but there is no proof
for this claim. In contemporary times
polyandry can be found only at the
outer fringes of Hindu society, such as in
the state of Assam and in some of the
Himalayan regions, where traditional
[[514]]

practices have allowed for one woman
to marry several brothers, following
Draupadi’s example.
Polygamy
Given the overwhelmingly patriarchal
character of Hindu society, polygamy
has probably existed since very early
times. The practice is attested in both
the great epics, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, as well as in the histori-
cal record. The dharma literature
permits men to marry wives of lower
social status, under the condition that
their first wife was of equal status.
Despite the existence of polygamy,
it was probably unusual and restricted
to men of high status and financial
resources, who would be able to support
several families. For “regular” men,
one of the few reasons for taking a sec-
ond wife was when the first wife was
unable to bear children, in an attempt to
sire the sons needed to preserve the
lineage and ensure performance of the
ancestral rites.
Pongal
Southern Indian harvest festival mark-
ing the change of seasons and the tran-
sition of the sun into the zodiacal sign of
Capricorn, and thus beginning its
northward
course
(uttarayana).
According to Indian astrology this usually
takes place on January 14th; in northern
India this day is celebrated as Makara
Sankranti. Both mark the sun’s change
in motion from the southerly direction
to the northerly, or from the direction
considered less auspicious to the one
considered more auspicious.
The festivities for Pongal last for
three days. The first day is the Pongal of
Joy (Bhogi Pongal), on which people
visit and exchange sweets and gifts. The
second day is dedicated to the Sun
(Surya Pongal). On this day married
women cook rice in milk, and when the
pot comes to a boil they shout “Pongal”
(“It has boiled”). The milk-rice is made
into sweets, which is first offered to thePrabhakara
Sun and to the god Ganesh, and
then given to friends. On the final day,
Pongal of Cows (Mattu Pongal),
worshipers walk in a circle around cows
while the cows are decorated, garlanded,
and worshiped.
Possession
Possession by gods, ghosts, and spirits is
an accepted element in the traditional
Hindu worldview, although whether this
is good or bad depends on the nature of
the being responsible. Possession is the
most common means for village deities
and certain forms of the Goddess to
communicate with human beings,
although the highest gods in the pan-
theon virtually never use this medium.
Possession by a deity can bring a person
high religious status but is generally said
to be physically exhausting; through
the medium the deities can interact
with human beings, both to make their
wishes known and to give their help and
advice to those who need it. One of the
more unusual cases of this occurs at the
annual pilgrimage at Kataragama in Sri
Lanka. Devotees (bhakta) suspend
themselves from trees by hooks stuck
into the flesh of their backs and, while
suspended, are believed to be speaking
for the god Murugan.
Possession by departed spirits (bhut
or pret) or by witches and other malefic
beings is always seen as an inopportune
event and a dangerous imposition on
the sufferer that must be remedied as
soon as possible through healing or
exorcism. As Sudhir Kakar masterfully
shows, the language of possession and
exorcism can be interpreted as an
“idiom,” using traditional Indian cultural
categories, for what modern psychia-
trists might call the diagnosis and treat-
ment of mental illness. For further
information see Sudhir Kakar, Shamans,
Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Poygai
(7th c.) With Pey and Bhutam, one of the
first three Alvars, a group of twelve poet-
saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and their
passionate devotion (bhakti) to a per-
sonal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language, trans-
formed and revitalized Hindu religious
life. According to tradition, the three
men were caught in a torrential storm
and, one by one, took shelter in a small
dry spot, with each making room for the
next. As they stood next to one another,
they felt a fourth presence, who was
Vishnu. The alvars were such great
devotees that their combined energy
was sufficient to provoke Vishnu’s mani-
festation. Overwhelmed with ecstasy,
each burst into song, which formed the
first of each of their compositions. For
further information see Kamil Zvelebil,
Tamil Literature, 1975.
Prabhakara
In Indian philosophy, one of the two
great seventh-century commentators in
the Purva Mimamsa school, one of the
six schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy; the other great commentator was
Kumarila. The Mimamsa school was
most concerned with the examination
and pursuit of dharma (“righteous
action”), the Mimamsa school believed
all necessary instructions were con-
tained in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts. Much of Mimamsa
thought is concerned with principles
and methods for textual interpretation
seeking to uncover and interpret these
instructions. Although both Kumarila
and Prabhakara were committed to dis-
covering the boundaries of dharma by
interpreting the Vedas, there are signifi-
cant differences in their philosophical
positions, seen most clearly in their
theories of error.
Prabhakara believes in a concept
similar to the Nyaya concept of inher-
ence (samavaya), a weak relational
force that is assumed to connect objects
and their attributes—for example, con-
necting the color red with a particular
[[515]]
Prabhupada, A.C. Bhaktivedanta
ball, thus making the ball red. This
assumption leads him to characterize
error as akhyati (“nondiscrimination”),
the inability to make sharp distinctions.
For example, a person mistakes the sil-
very flash of sea shell for a piece of silver.
To Prabhakara, the person errs by
uncritically connecting two simple judg-
ments: “that object is silvery” and “silver
is silvery.” By themselves, both of these
statements are true, what is false is their
combination into the complex judg-
ment “that object is silver.” Kumarila is
closer to the bhedabhada (“identity-
and-difference”) philosophical position,
which holds that all things both identify
with and differ from all other things.
Kumarila explains error as viparitakhyati,
the mistaken pairing of the similarities
between two things, rather than the
failure to note their differences.
Prabhupada, A.C. Bhaktivedanta
(b. Abhay Charan De, 1896–1977)
Devotee (bhakta) of the god Krishna
and founder of ISKCON (International
Society for Krishna Consciousness),
more popularly known as the Hare
Krishnas. ISKCON has its roots in the
Gaudiya Vaishnava religious community
founded by the Bengali saint Chaitanya,
in which the primary religious action
was the repeated recitation of Krishna’s
name, often in public settings.
Prabhupada was initiated into Krishna
devotion in his university years, at
which time his guru commanded him to
bring the worship of Krishna to the
West. At the age of 58, after a successful
career as a pharmacist, he boarded a
steamer for the United States, arriving
with a few books, a typewriter, and eight
dollars in his pocket. His timing was
exquisite—or, as he put it, reflected
Krishna’s grace—for he came during
the countercultural movement in the
second half of the 1960s; by the time of
his death he had thousands of followers.
In his later years he focused on translat-
ing and commenting on important
Vaishnava texts, particularly the
Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata
[[516]]

Purana, and this emphasis on publish-
ing has continued after his death.
For an insider’s perspective on his life,
see Satsvarupdas Dasa Goswami,
Prabhupada, 1983; and Robert D. Baird,
“Swami Bhaktivedanta and Ultimacy,”
in Robert D. Baird (ed.), Religion in
Modern India, 1998.
Prabodhachandrodaya
(“Rising of the moon of wisdom”)
Sanskrit drama written by Krishna-
mishra, probably in the latter half of
the eleventh century. Clearly allegori-
cal, the play celebrates the triumph of
Vaishnava piety, that is, of the devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. The play is
particularly notable for its third act, in
which representatives for four non-
Vaishnava sects appear: a materialist, a
Jain monk, a Buddhist monk, and a
Kapalika (a member of an ascetic com-
munity that worshiped the god Shiva).
The last is portrayed as thoroughly
depraved, indulging in meat, wine, and
sexual gratification, and having a pen-
chant for violence. In the play, all four
heretical characters plot to capture
another character, named Faith, for
their king, named Passion. However,
they discover that Faith is a devotee of
Vishnu and is outside their powers. In
the end Faith is reunited with her son
Tranquillity and a character named
Compassion. Although the reader may
safely assume that this play is written
from a biased perspective, it is instruc-
tive in the attitudes it reveals toward
ascetics and all other non-Vaishnava
religious groups.
Pracharak
(“director”) In the Rashtriya Svayam-
sevak Sangh (RSS), a conservative Hindu
organization whose express purpose is
to provide the leadership cadre for a
revitalized Hindu India, the pracharaks
are the full-time RSS workers who pro-
vide the link between the local units,
known as shakhas (“branches”), and the
RSS higher authorities. The RSS is a highlyPradakshina
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada was the founder of ISKCON,
a religious community devoted to the god Krishna that is popularly known as the Hare Krishnas.
authoritarian organization, with all
power ultimately vested in a single,
unelected leader, the sarsanghchalak,
and the pracharaks are the crucial link
between this highly centralized leader-
ship and the highly decentralized local
units. The pracharaks are responsible
for coordinating and managing RSS
activities in their area, as well as for
reporting on these at RSS meetings at
various levels; they may also be sent out
on loan to provide leadership to RSS-
affiliated organizations. As a rule,
pracharaks are completely devoted to
the RSS cause, and most have been asso-
ciated with the RSS since childhood.
Their ethos is one of service and sacri-
fice to the RSS, and by implication to the
country as a whole: They are generally
unmarried, have no other employment,
receive no salary from the RSS (although
the local unit generally provides their
living expenses), and are famous for liv-
ing a simple and spartan lifestyle. Most
of them are also well educated and are
selected for their ability to get along
well with others. For further informa-
tion see Walter K. Andersen and
Shridhar D. Damle, The Brotherhood in
Saffron, 1987; and Daniel Gold,
“Organized Hinduisms: From Vedic
Truth to Hindu Nation,” in Martin Marty
and R. Scott Appleby (eds.), Funda-
mentalisms Observed, 1991.
Pradakshina
(“toward the right”) Circumambulation
of an object or person as a sign of wor-
ship, reverence, or respect. This is
always done in a clockwise direction, so
that the walker’s right side (considered
the purer and more auspicious side) is
always turned toward the object or per-
son being circled. Just about anything
can be so circled—one’s parents or
teacher, the image of a deity, a temple,
a city, or the entire Indian subconti-
nent. In many larger temples, particu-
larly in the Nagara architectural style,
the pradakshina is the name for one of
the architectural features. In this case,
it is a semicircular processional pas-
sageway surrounding the temple’s
main image, so that people can cir-
cumambulate the main image either
before or after worship. Pradakshina is
also the fifteenth of the sixteen tradi-
tional upacharas (“offerings”) given to
[[517]]
Pradhana
a deity as part of worship, on the model
of treating the deity as an honored
guest. The underlying motive here, as
for all the upacharas, is to show one’s
love for the deity and to minister to the
deity’s needs as one would to a living
person’s needs.
Pradhana
(“principal”) In the Samkhya philo-
sophical school, pradhana is another
name for prakrti, the “primal matter”
that the Samkhyas consider the first
principle from which all material things
have evolved. In the secret, ritually
based religious practice known as
tantra, the word pradhana is used to
denote the goddess Shakti, as the active
principle behind the formation of the
universe. Grammatically, the word is
feminine, indicating a connotation of
fertility and fecundity.
Pradosh Vrat
(“twilight vow”) Religious observance
celebrated on the thirteenth day of each
lunar fortnight, mainly by women, often
for the birth of children or to sustain the
general family welfare. The vow (vrat) is
dedicated to the god Shiva, and its most
important part takes place on the
evening of the thirteenth day (the word
pradosh is interpreted as meaning “twi-
light”) when worshipers present Shiva
with the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas), following which they may
take their only meal of the day. In
some cases worshipers stay awake
through the night so that the observance
may finish on the fourteenth day of
the month, a lunar day connected
with Shiva. When the thirteenth day
falls on a Monday (associated with
Shiva), Saturday (associated with
Saturn), or Sunday (associated with
the Sun), this rite is believed to be
especially efficacious.
Pradyumna
In Hindu mythology, the son of the god
Krishna and his divine queen Rukmini.
[[518]]

Pradyumna is the rebirth of the god
Kama, who has been completely annihi-
lated by the fire from the god Shiva’s
third eye. After Kama’s death, Shiva reas-
sures Kama’s wife Rati that her husband
will be reborn as Pradyumna to kill the
demon Sambhara. Through his magic
powers Sambhara is well aware of the
threat; when he finds the child, he
throws it into the ocean and thinks that
he has killed it. Pradyumna is swallowed
by a great fish, which is caught and pre-
sented to king Sambhara; when the fish
is split open, the child enchants his wife
Mayavati, in whose form Rati has taken
birth to aid her husband. Pradyumna
kills Sambhara in a ferocious battle and
is reunited with Rati.
Prahlada
In Hindu mythology, the son of the
demon-king Hiranyakashipu, and a
great devotee (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. Through harsh physical asceti-
cism (tapas) Hiranyakashipu has gained
a series of divine boons that render him
virtually invulnerable, yet despite his
power, his son Prahlada refuses to aban-
don his devotion to Vishnu. Prahlada’s
devotion in the face of his father’s ever-
growing pride generates an escalating
pattern of abuse that culminates in the
demand that Prahlada worship him
rather than Vishnu. At that point Vishnu
comes to Prahlada’s aid as the Man-lion
avatar, slays Hiranyakashipu, and
establishes Prahlada as king in his place.
Prajapati
(“Lord of Creatures”) Deity appearing
late in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
sacred texts, who is described as the
creator of the universe and is consid-
ered superior to the Vedic deities. The
means by which Prajapati carries out
creation are different in different
places. In Rg Veda 10.121 he is
described as the Golden Embryo from
which all things developed, whereas in
Rg 10.90, also known as the Purusha
Sukta, he is described as the primal personPrakashatman
(purusha) who is sacrificed by the gods
and from whose parts the world devel-
ops. In later Hindu practice the name
Prajapati can also be used to refer to the
god Brahma, as fashioner of the uni-
verse, or to the gods Vishnu or Shiva, as
the universe’s supreme deities.
Prajapatya Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty. In
Hindu mythology Prajapati was the
name of the creator, and this name sug-
gests that the purpose of this marriage
was for people to fulfill their duties to
the ancestors by procreating. A
Prajapatya marriage takes place when a
father gives away his daughter to a man
with the condition that they will per-
form their civic and religious duties
together. This was one of the four
approved (prashasta) forms of mar-
riage, because it was arranged by the
girl’s father. However, it was considered
less commendable than the other
approved forms, because the girl was
given in marriage with conditions. In
Indian culture, the best way to give a
daughter is to impose no conditions. See
also marriage, eight classical forms.
Prajnanam Brahman
(“Wisdom is Brahman”) In the Hindu
philosophical tradition, one of the “great
utterances” (mahavakyas) expressing
the ultimate truth. The truth here is the
identity of prajnanam (ultimate wis-
dom) and Brahman (Supreme Reality);
this identity is the heart of the specula-
tive texts called the Upanishads. Aside
from their importance in a philosophi-
cal context, as encapsulating funda-
mental truths, the four mahavakyas
were also appropriated as identifying
symbols by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics. Each divi-
sion had a different mahavakya, just as
each had a different Veda, a different
primary monastic center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Prajnanam
Brahman is the mahavakya associated
with the Bhogawara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.
Prakamyam
(“irresistible will”) One of the eight
superhuman powers (siddhi) tradition-
ally believed to be conferred by high
spiritual attainment. This particular
power removes all obstructions to the
movement of one’s body, such that one
can go wherever one desires, even pass-
ing through solid objects as if moving
through water.
Prakasha
(“illumination”) In Hindu tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
prakasha is one of the bipolar oppo-
sites that are used to characterize the
nature of all reality, with its counter-
part being reflection (vimarsha).
These two terms are particularly
important for the creation of the world,
which is said to happen when the pure
and radiant consciousness (prakasha)
of the ultimate Brahman becomes
self-conscious through the reflection
(vimarsha) of this original conscious-
ness. From one single consciousness,
the absolute then evolves into a binary
divinity—the god Shiva and his con-
sort Shakti—whose continued interac-
tion combines to create the world. For
further information see Jaideva Singh,
Pratyabhijnanahrdayam, 1982. See
also cosmology.
Prakashatman
(13th c.) Proponent of the Advaita
Vedanta school, one of the six schools of
traditional Hindu philosophy. Praka-
shatman’s Vivarana, a commentary on
the work of the Advaita philosopher
Padmapada, provides the name for the
Vivarana school of Advaita Vedanta.
Prakashatman is traditionally described
as Padmapada’s disciple, but since the
latter is an attested pupil of Shanka-
racharya (9th c. C.E.), the time difference
makes this unlikely.
[[519]]
Prakrit
Since Brahman is believed to be the
locus of all things, Vivarana Advaitins
conclude that ignorance must also be a
part of Brahman. However, they try to
maintain Brahman’s integrity by invok-
ing a theory of reflectionism to explain
the apparent difference between Self
and Brahman, even though they are ulti-
mately identical. Just as an image
appearing in a mirror is based on the
original but different from it, so human
Selves are identical with Brahman but
appear to be separate. The basic posi-
tion of the Vivarana school is an uncom-
promising affirmation of Brahman as
the sole “reality,” in which anything that
exists must belong to it.
Prakrit
(“formed”) Collective term for the gram-
matically simpler vernacular languages
that developed from Sanskrit through
the natural process of linguistic change.
The existence of Prakrits is evident as
early as the fifth century B.C.E., at which
time several different dialects are spo-
ken. The Prakrits were contrasted with
Sanskrit (“perfected”), the language of
temple, court, and other elite contexts,
which was subject to strict grammatical
canons and did not change. Even those
fluent in Sanskrit would have learned it
as a second language—as a static,
learned language, it is inherently artifi-
cial—and would have spoken in Prakrit
with lower status people (such as ser-
vants, commoners, and most women).
Despite its “lower” status, Prakrits are
vitally important historically: They were
the languages for royal inscriptions up
to the Gupta era (ca. 350–550), and one
of the Prakrits, Pali, is famous as the lan-
guage for the Theravada Buddhist
canon. See also Gupta dynasty.
Prakrti
(“nature”) One of the two fundamental
principles in the Samkhya school, the
other being purusha (“person”).
Samkhya espouses an atheistic philo-
sophical dualism, in which purusha and
[[520]]

prakrti—roughly, spirit and nature—are
the source of all things. Prakrti is better
conceived of as force or power rather
than a specific material object. It con-
tains within it three different forces with
three different qualities (guna): sattva
tends toward the good, rajas towards
activity or passion, and tamas towards
darkness and decay. In the primal
prakrti these forces are in perfect equi-
librium, each perfectly balancing the
others, but when prakrti’s equilibrium
is disturbed, it sets in motion a pattern
of evolution that creates both the exte-
rior physical world and the interior
psychological world. All of these evo-
lutes—material or psychic—have a dif-
fering balance of the three gunas,
which ultimately determines their
character as wholesome, active, or
unwholesome. For further information
see Gerald Larson and Ram Shankar
Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya, 1987;
and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Pralaya
In Hindu mythology, the dissolution of
the universe that comes at the end of the
kalpa or Day of Brahma. Pralaya is con-
sidered the “night” of Brahma, and lasts
for the same amount of time as the day
(by one estimate, 4.32 billion years). The
approach of this “night” is preceded by
the destruction of the earth, first by fire,
and then by torrential rains that trans-
form the entire planet into one vast
ocean. During this time the only living
thing is the god Vishnu, who reclines on
the back of his serpent vehicle Shesha,
deep in a yogic trance. When the time
again comes for creation, a lotus sprouts
from his navel, which opens to reveal
Brahma, and the world begins anew.
Pramana
In Indian philosophy, a means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge, generally classified
as one of three types: PerceptionPrana
Pramukh Swami, the present spiritual leader of the Swaminarayan religious community.
(pratyaksha), which includes magical or
yogic insight as well as direct sensory
perception; inference (anumana),
which ultimately depends upon direct
experience; and testimony (shabda),
which can be either scriptural or the
instruction of one’s teacher. Some philo-
sophical schools also include a fourth
source, analogy (upamana), but those
who do not recognize this categorize it
as another form of inference. The first
three are accepted by all philosophical
schools except for the materialists, who
recognize only perception. The Purva
Mimamsa school affirms two additional
pramanas—presumption (arthapatti),
and knowledge from absence (abhava)—
which they argue give one knowledge.
The root meaning of this term comes
from the verb “to measure”; thus these
are tools for measuring and interpreting
the world we experience.
Pramukh Swami
(“President Swami,” b. 1921) Title of
Shastri Narayanswarupdas Swami, the
present spiritual leader of the
Swaminarayan religious community.
Swaminarayan Hinduism is based on
the life and teachings of Sahajananda
Swami (1781–1830), who because of his
piety and charisma was deemed by his
followers an avatar of the god Vishnu.
Pramukh Swami is the uncontested
head of the Akshar Purushottam
Samstha, a branch of the Swaminarayan
movement that separated from the par-
ent group in 1906. He is a strict ascetic
who serves as religious teacher (guru) to
an estimated million followers all over
the world. His devotees (bhakta) are
predominately members of the Gujarati
community and mostly affluent mer-
chants, making the movement finan-
cially robust.
Prana
(“breath”) As a collective noun, the
name for the five “winds” considered to
be responsible for basic bodily func-
tions. The first of these, located in the
chest, is labeled by the general term
prana. Because it performs those func-
tions necessary for sustaining life—res-
piration, the movement of food into the
stomach, and the circulation of blood
through the body—its name is often
used to designate all five winds. Of the
other four winds, apana (in the anal
region) is concerned with elimination,
[[521]]
Pranapratishtha
samana (in the navel) aids digestion,
udana (in the throat) conveys things out
of the mouth—like speech, song, burps,
etc.—and vyana circulates throughout
the body, mixing things together. These
winds are the focus of the yoga exercise
known as pranayama, the aim of which
is to achieve control over the central
forces of life.
Pranapratishtha
(“establishing the prana”) Pranapratishtha
is the final rite in the consecration of a
deity’s image, usually performed by
brahmins, since they have the necessary
ritual purity and training. The image is
infused with the breath of life (prana)
through the performance of ritual and
the intoning of sacred sounds known as
mantras. After this rite is performed, the
deity is believed to be resident in the
image, which thereafter must be treated
with the care such a spiritual entity
requires.
Prapatti
(“throwing oneself down”) Prapatti
refers to a devotee’s (bhakta) complete
surrender to God’s power as the only
means of salvation. This attitude is
particularly stressed among the
Shrivaishnavas, a southern Indian
religious community who are followers
of the god Vishnu and whose founder
was the great philosopher Ramanuja
(11th c.). Although ultimate power is
believed to be vested in God’s grace by
the practitioners of prapatti, believers
nevertheless possess a concern for
continuing religious practice. Thus,
prapatti is not meant to replace conven-
tional religious activities such as wor-
ship. These activities are still performed,
but with the consciousness that God’s
grace will be sufficient. They are there-
fore not seen as a means toward salva-
tion, but as reflections of the grace one
has already obtained.
Prapti
Pranava
Name denoting the sacred sound Om.
See Om.
Pranayama
(“restraint of breath”) In the ashtanga
(“eight-part”) yoga first codified by
Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), pranayama is
the fourth of the eight constituent
elements of yoga practice. Pranayama
requires a conscious control of respir-
ation, specifically halting one’s breath-
ing before inhaling and exhaling.
When both of these actions have
become automatic, this is described as
“total” restraint. This practice is sup-
posed to weaken and destroy the prac-
titioner’s unwholesome karma, and
render the mind fit for concentration.
Removing karma is necessary for liber-
ation of the soul, since all karma (both
good and bad) ties one to the cycle of
birth and rebirth.

(“acquisition”) One of the eight super-
human powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred by high spiritual
attainment. This particular power gives
one the ability to gain any object simply
by desiring it.
Prarthana Samaj
Hindu reformist organization centered
in Bombay, whose most important fig-
ure was M. G. Ranade (1842–1901). The
Prarthana Samaj’s reformist mission
focused more on social issues than on
theological or worship-related ones.
Their primary aim was to rid Hindu
society of “evils” such as child marriage
and the ban on widow remarriage.
Although its members were educated
and progressive, they were also reli-
giously conservative and devout Hindus
with deep roots in the tradition. They
saw their work as a slow and gradual
process of reforming Hinduism by
removing its most objectionable prac-
tices rather than by radically remaking it
from start. In this they differed from thePrashna (“Question”) Upanishad
Brahmo Samaj, who attempted to
remake the tradition wholesale by
giving it a strong, quasi-monotheistic
emphasis, a quality heavily influenced
by European missionaries. The
Prarthana Samaj lost its steam by
the early 1920s, when social reform
associations became absorbed into the
Indian National Congress.
Prasad
(“favor”) Prasad is food or drink that has
been offered to a deity as part of normal
worship and, having been sanctified by
the deity’s power, is later distributed to
worshipers as a symbol of the deity’s
grace. In this process, the deity is
believed to have “consumed” part of the
food offering, and thus—in keeping
with everyday ideas about the contami-
nating power of saliva—to have
“imprinted” the food with its substance.
Since this substance has been “charged”
with divine presence, it is given to devo-
tees (bhakta) as an emblem of the
deity’s grace, and worshipers consume it
in the belief that this sanctifies them. Its
sacred qualities mean that prasad is
treated differently than regular food: It
cannot be refused and can never be
thrown away. If one cannot eat it, the
favored method of disposal is to feed it
to a cow. See also jutha.
Prashasta (“Approved”) Marriages
In the dharma literature, or the texts on
religious duty, these are the four
approved forms of marriage: the
Brahma marriage, the Daiva marriage,
the Arsha marriage, and the Prajapatya
marriage. These forms are deemed com-
mendable because in each case the
father of the bride is responsible for
arranging the marriage: In the Brahma
form the bride is given as a gift without
conditions, in the Daiva she is given as a
sacrificial fee, in the Arsha she is given in
exchange for a pair of cattle for sacrifice,
and in the Prajapatya she is given with
the condition that the husband and wife
perform their duties together. The
Brahma is the only one of these four
practiced in modern India and is the
idealized form of marriage. See also
marriage, eight classical forms.
Prashastapada
(5th c.) Author of the Padarthadharma-
sangraha.This text is the most influential
commentary on Kanada’s Vaisheshika
Sutras, the founding text of the
Vaisheshika school, one of the six
schools of traditional Hindu philoso-
phy. The Vaisheshika school was atom-
istic, believing that all things were made
up of a few basic constituent sub-
stances: the five elements (earth, fire,
water, wind, and akasha) along with
space, time, mind, and individual selves
(atman). The five elements combined to
form the things in the world, though
selves were considered ultimately differ-
ent from matter.
Prashna (“Question”) Upanishad
One of the later and more developed
upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the latest stratum of the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas. As
with most of the upanishads, the Prashna
Upanishad’s underlying concern is to
investigate ultimate questions, in particu-
lar the nature of the Self (atman).
Considered one of the later upanishads,
the Prashna Upanishad is similar to the
earliest upanishads, the Brhadaranyaka
and the Chandogya, but is far shorter, and
the text is much more focused. Like the
older upanishads, the Prashna is written
as a dialogue. It takes the form of a con-
versation between the sage Pippalada and
six questioners. In each section (called a
prashna in the text) one of the hearers asks
a question, to which Pippalada replies.
The six sections all have different themes:
the nature of time, prana as the most
important human power, the nature of life
after death, sleep, meditation, the sound
Om, and the nature of the Self. In this
way, it uses the older dialogue form to
advance a far more developed and
cohesive philosophical perspective.
[[523]]
Pratihara Dynasty
Pratihara Dynasty
(“assertion”) In Indian logic, a part in the
generally accepted form of an inference
(anumana), or logical statement. The
accepted form for an inference has
three terms: an assertion (pratijna), a
reason (hetu), and examples (drshtanta).
Each of these three also has its own con-
stituent parts. The pratijna’s two con-
stituent parts are the paksha and the
sadhya. The paksha is the subject of the
assertion and names a class of things,
while the sadhya is the claim to be
proven about that class. For example, in
the assertion “this mountain is on fire,”
the paksha is “this mountain” (the class
of things about which a claim is being
made), and the sadhya, or thing to be
proven, is “is on fire.”all concepts based on dualistic thinking.
The “Five Forbidden Things,” therefore,
provides a ritual means for breaking
the duality of sacred and forbidden,
by sacralizing several things that are
ordinarily forbidden.
These five things are used in their
actual form in “left hand” (vamachara)
tantra, and by substitution in “right hand”
(dakshinachara) tantra. Substitution
allows the adept to perform the ritual
and at the same time to avoid the disap-
proval that would result from breaking
certain social rules. Although tantric
texts allow for substitution in this rite,
they are usually quite specific about
what sorts of things are acceptable
substitutes, a signature quality of strictly
defined ritual systems. For further infor-
mation see Swami Agehananda Bharati,
The Tantric Tradition, 1975; and Douglas
Renfrew Brooks, The Secret of the Three
Cities, 1990.
PratilomaPratyabhijna
(“against the hair”) Forbidden marriage
union, in which the husband has lower
social status than the wife. See hypoga-
mous marriage.(“recognition”) Doctrine advanced by
many different schools of tantra, a
secret, ritually defined religious prac-
tice, and particularly by the Kashmiri
philosopher Abhinavagupta, the most
influential figure in Trika Shaivism. It
holds that the final realization of the
Absolute is simply a “re-cognition” of
one’s essential unity with the Divine.
This unity has always existed and has
never been altered, the only factor pre-
venting it from being clearly seen being
the obscuring power of false under-
standing. Final unity with the Divine,
therefore, comes not through doing any-
thing, but simply through realizing what
has always been the case. This doctrine
clearly shows the influence of the
Advaita Vedanta philosophical school,
but with an important shift. The Advaita
school upholds a philosophical position
known as monism, which is the belief
that a single abstract ultimate princi-
ple—which they call Brahman—lies
behind all things, and that all things are
only particular manifestations of that
one principle. The “Recognition” school
See Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty.
Pratijna
Pratinidhi
(“substitute”) In the context of tantra, a
secret, ritually based religious practice,
anything that can correctly be used as a
substitute. Certain tantric rites make rit-
ual use of substances or actions that are
normally forbidden; the most famous of
these rites, the Five Forbidden Things
(panchamakara), incorporates violating
the social taboos on drinking wine, con-
suming nonvegetarian food, and engag-
ing in illicit sex. The ritual use of such
normally forbidden things must be seen
in the larger context of tantric practice.
One of the most pervasive tantric
assumptions is the ultimate unity
of everything that exists. From this
perspective,
adepts
affirm
that
the entire universe is one principle—
often, conceived as the activity of a
particular deity—and therefore reject
[[524]]
Pravahana Jaivali
Yoga asanas contribute to the development of pratyahara, or withdrawal from the senses.
adopts this general principle but con-
ceives of Ultimate Reality theistically,
as the god Shiva. For Trika Shaivism,
Shiva is the sole true reality, who is
both supreme god, and the source of
the material universe. For further
information see Jaideva Singh, Pratya-
bhijnanahrdayam, 1982.
Pratyahara
(“withdrawal [of the senses]”) In the
ashtanga (“eight-part”) yoga first cod-
ified by Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), pratya-
hara is the fifth of the eight
constituent elements of yoga practice.
Pratyahara occurs when one with-
draws the senses from the sense
objects they ordinarily perceive. It is
done after one has mastered the sit-
ting positions (asanas)—and thus can
sit comfortably for long periods—and
after one has gained control of
“breath” (pranayama), which allows
heightened command of one’s physio-
logical capacities. Having gained rela-
tive mastery over the body, one is then
ready to focus attention inward.
Pratyaksha
(“concerning the eye”) In Indian philos-
ophy, pratyaksha is the general term for
sense perception. All philosophical
schools accept perception as one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge, and it is the only pramana
accepted by the materialist school.
Although the word’s literal meaning
implies only information from the eyes,
this pramana includes sense data from
the other four human senses, as well as
“perceptions” obtained through magical
cognition, yogic insight, or any other
supernormal abilities or phenomena.
Pravahana Jaivali
A character in the Chandogya Upanishad,
one of the speculative religious texts
that form the latest stratum of the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
In the text, Pravahana Jaivali is a mem-
ber of the warrior (kshatriya) class who
serves as teacher to members of the
scholarly-priestly (brahmin) class. His
first students are Silaka Shalavatya and
Caikitayana Dalbhya, then Shvetaketu
Aruneya and his father Gautama. This is
[[525]]
Pravara
one of several episodes in the Upanishads
in which kshatriyas instruct brahmins,
thus inverting the accepted pattern
that holds brahmins as religious
authorities. These episodes reveal the
nature of wisdom as conceived in the
Upanishads—it is conferred, not by
birth or social position, but by individ-
ual striving and realization.
Pravara
A lineage system, primarily among
brahmins, which builds on the assump-
tions of the gotra system (the tracing of
brahmin lineage to one of seven mythi-
cal sages). In his daily worship a brah-
min would not only mention the name
of his gotra, who is the sage believed to
be the family’s immediate progenitor,
but also the names of other sages
believed to be remote ancestors. Both
these “lineages” were passed down only
through men, since it was customary for
a married woman to adopt her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
The only context in which gotra and
pravara were really important was in
fixing marriages, because of the
kinship conferred by these mythic
lineages. Marriage within the gotra
was strictly forbidden, since the
assumption that such people were
directly related made this marriage
incestuous. Marriage within the pravara
was also forbidden, although in
medieval times different groups inter-
preted this prohibition differently.
For some groups, any shared pravara
ancestry would forbid the marriage, but
for other groups one shared “ancestor”
was deemed permissible. The more
lenient interpretation may well have
been spurred by practical difficulties in
making matches.
Prayaga
(“Place of Sacrifice”) The traditional
Hindu name for Allahabad, the city at
the junction of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers. See Allahabad.
[[526]]

Prayashchitta
A general term meaning atonement for
one’s misdeeds. The Hindu religious tra-
dition gives considerable attention to
penance and expiation, based on the
almost universal Hindu belief in the
inexorable
workings
of
karma.
According to this notion, all good and
bad deeds will eventually have their
effect, either in this life or the next, and
thus one must either atone for the evil
one has done or face its consequences
in the future. Prescriptions for such
expiation can be found as far back as the
Vedas, and the acts prescribed for
atonement fall into several categories:
confession, repentance (which was usu-
ally seen as preparation for expiation,
rather than absolution of the evil itself),
restraint of breath (pranayama), physi-
cal asceticism (tapas), fire sacrifice
(homa), recitation of prayers (japa),
gift-giving (dana), fasting (upavasa),
and travel to sacred sites (tirthayatra).
The prayashchitta literature is quite
well developed, both in detailing
differing kinds of offenses and their
potentially mitigating circumstances,
and in laying out the types of atonement
to be performed for each offense. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968.
Prayoga
(“use,” “application”) In the context
of Hindu ritual, any prescribed proce-
dure to be followed during worship,
meditation, or when performing other
ritual actions.
Pregnancy
As in all societies, Hindus regard the
impending birth of a child as a time of
eager expectation tinged with anxiety.
Part of this anxiety stems from purely
physical worries that the pregnancy and
birth proceed normally, and that the
mother and child remain in good physi-
cal health. Expectant mothers are usually
encouraged to rest and are often givenPrinsep, James
food considered especially nourishing
(such as milk products and nuts) to
build their strength. From the mother’s
perspective, pregnancy is an extremely
significant event, since the birth of chil-
dren (especially sons) will solidify her
status in her marital family; but this
significance also contributes its own
quotient of expectation and anxiety.
Since the mother’s emotional state
during pregnancy is believed to affect
the child, all efforts are made to shelter
the expectant mother from unpleasant
thoughts and situations and to generate
happy thoughts.
Aside from protecting the expectant
mother’s physical and psychological
health, Hindus take numerous precau-
tions to guard her from other sorts of
misfortune. As at other life transitions,
during pregnancy and the child’s first
days the mother and her child are con-
sidered particularly vulnerable to black
magic, particularly the witchcraft of
those who might be jealous of the
expectant or new mother. Another
avenue for harm comes from inauspi-
cious events, such as an eclipse, during
which a pregnant woman should stay
inside (away from its malevolent rays)
and remain perfectly still, lest her child
be born with missing limbs. These hos-
tile forces can also be countered by vari-
ous rites of protection, such as wearing
amulets, charms, or iron (considered to
render one impervious to spells), by cut-
ting back on social interaction to avoid
possible contact with inauspicious peo-
ple and things, and by attention to reli-
gious rites.(“departed,” “deceased”) The spirit of a
person who has recently died but is still
inappropriately connected to the world
of the living, often as a troubling or
malevolent presence to the departed’s
family or the general population. Prets
are believed to be the spirits of people
who died in childhood and whose
untimely death left them with certain
unfulfilled desires, particularly longings
relating to marriage and family life. Prets
make themselves known to the living in
two ways, either through dreams or
possession. In some cases they have
specific requests and can be placated
through worship and offerings. In such
instances, dreams offer a method of
communicating with the living, so that
necessary actions can be performed for
the pret. In other cases, the spirit may
resort to bodily possession in an
attempt to realize unfulfilled desires
directly. These spirits are typically
malevolent and require an exorcism to
be removed. For further information on
the care of unquiet family spirits, see
Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful Journeys,
[[1988]]
; for a psychological interpretation
of spirits, possession, and healing, see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991.
Prenatal RitesPrinsep, James
Life-cycle rituals (samskaras) performed
by a husband before his child’s birth, as
prescribed in the dharma literature, the
texts on religious duty. According to this
literature, there were three such rites:
Garbhadhana, which ensured concep-
tion; Pumsavana, which guaranteed that
the newly conceived child would be a
boy; and Simantonnayana, which was
performed late in the pregnancy to
ensure the child’s good health and the
mother’s easy delivery. Although the
dharma literature prescribes these rites
as obligatory, none of them are widely
performed now except by the most
orthodox brahmins.
Pret
(1799–1840) British official and amateur
Indologist. In 1837, Prinsep became the
first modern person to decipher the
Brahmi script, and was thus able to
translate the edicts of the Mauryan
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–32 B.C.E.).
Unfortunately, his career was cut short
by an early death, a pattern distressingly
familiar for colonial administrators in
British India. See also Maurya dynasty.
[[527]]
Priyadas
Priyadas
(early 18th c.) Author of the Bhaktirasa-
bodhini (“Awakening the Delight in
Devotion”), a commentary on the
Bhaktamal of Nabhadas, completed in
[[1712]]
. In his text, Nabhadas had given
very brief (six line) biographies of over
two hundred contemporary bhakti
(devotional) figures. These original
biographies are notably free of mar-
velous and miraculous events, with their
major emphasis being the devotee’s
(bhakta) personal qualities, to serve as a
model for others. In his commentary,
Priyadas gives greatly expanded
accounts for each one of the devotees
mentioned by Nabhadas, and usually
describes events to which Nabhadas
makes no reference. At least in the case
of the poet-saint Ravidas, Nabhadas
clearly drew his material from the texts
written by the biographer Anantadas,
but in many other cases his sources
are not clear. The accounts by Priyadas
are larded with miracles and wonders,
and the prevalence of such events,
combined with his chronological dis-
tance from his subjects, makes him
a less reliable source for the lives of
these devotees.
Progress Philosophy
(“jativada”) Progress philosophy affirms
that one can attain complete freedom
from bondage—which in the Indian
context is identified as the end of rein-
carnation (samsara) and final liberation
of the soul (moksha)—and that one can
also specify the necessary and sufficient
conditions that allow human beings to
bring about this freedom. As a rule,
progress philosophy tends to stress
gradual spiritual attainment, in which
very small beginnings can gradually lead
one to the ultimate goal. Progress
philosophers thus tend to stress partic-
ular religious paths that will lead one
to the final goal, and also tend to place
a great significance on actions (espe-
cially ritual actions) as essential parts
of this path. In the Hindu tradition,
most philosophical schools are progress
[[528]]

philosophies: the combined Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school, the combined
Samkhya-Yoga school, the Purva
Mimamsa school, and even the
Bhamati and Vivarana schools of
Advaita Vedanta.
Prohibition
Most traditional Hindus have clearly
and strongly disapproved of consuming
liquor, a substance which, because it
may lead to a loss of control, is seen as
impure. Among wealthier Indians,
drinking alcoholic beverages is seen as a
habit that signals the acceptance of
Western values and alienation from
one’s roots, whereas among poorer citi-
zens, particularly laborers, drinking is
often seen as a misuse of money needed
to support a family. For all these reasons,
the imposition of total or partial prohi-
bition has become an effective part of
electoral platforms designed to appeal
to traditional and conservative Hindus.
In 1997, prohibition had been estab-
lished in three Indian states: Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh, and Haryana. Of these
three, Gujarat is the only one with a
long-standing history of prohibition,
while prohibition in Andhra Pradesh in
[[1995]]
, and in Haryana in 1996, was
imposed to fulfill campaign promises
made during the state elections in those
years. In both cases, the imposition of
prohibition also stimulated widespread
bootlegging and illegal distilling.
Prostitution
Prostitutes or courtesans were a regular
feature of ancient Indian life. But far
from simply offering sexual pleasure,
these prostitutes were in many cases
women of culture and learning. One of
the sections in the Kama Sutra pertains
to such individuals, and the author
Vatsyayana portrays prostitutes as
women who, while clearly outside nor-
mal society, have far greater indepen-
dence than most women. One finds a
similar picture in The Little Clay Cart
(Mrcchakatika), a drama in which thePuja
courtesan Vasantasena is sought by all
the men of the city because of her beauty,
wealth, and mastery of the sixty-four
aesthetic arts. This picture is doubtless
idealized and was probably realistic for
only a tiny fraction of the women plying
the sex trade, however.
The existence of prostitution also
appears in relation to a group of women
connected to certain temples. Called
servants of the deity (devadasis), these
women were not allowed to marry.
Instead, they were considered to be
married to the god, for whom they
would sing, dance, and perform various
rites, just as any Hindu wife would for
her husband. These women could hold
property and resources of their own, but
their status was clearly unusual, and it
was not uncommon for them to develop
long-term liaisons with local men for
mutual enjoyment. In some cases this
degenerated into prostitution—through
which such women became a source of
income for the temple—but in other
instances they were successful in retain-
ing some autonomy. Since Indian inde-
pendence in 1947 there has been a
prohibition on initiating devadasis, but
some older women remain who were
initiated before that time. In 1995, a
furor developed when the Jagannath
temple management committee began
to explore the possibility of new initia-
tions. For further information see
Vatsyayana (tr. Alain Daniélou), Kama
Sutra of Vatsyayana; and Frederique
Apffel Marglin, Wives of the God-King,
[[1985]]
. See also Yellamma.
Prthivi
The most common name for the Earth,
which, in addition to its material form, is
conceived of as a goddess. This particu-
lar name for the Earth goddess comes
from a mythic story connecting her to
the righteous king Prthu.
Prthu
In Hindu mythology, an ancient king
who rules over all the Earth, and whose
reign is considered a golden age. Prthu is
magically born from the right hand of
king Vena, a man so wicked that he has
prohibited all sacrifices to the gods.
After Prthu’s birth the people in his king-
dom suffer famine, since the Earth has
refused to produce food in protest
against Vena’s wickedness. Prthu chases
the Earth, who has taken the form of a
cow. She finally agrees that, if Prthu will
spare her life, she will produce food
again. It is in memory of this deed that
the Earth is given the name Prthivi
(“related to Prthu”).
Puja
(“homage”) The most common word for
worship in modern Hinduism. The root
of the word carries the sense of rever-
ence or respect, but puja is primarily
focused on actions, particularly offer-
ings to the deity, who is treated as an
honored guest. Although, according to
one list, there are sixteen such offerings
(upacharas), in practice the worship
performed in any particular setting is
subject to wide variation—based on
regional or local custom, individual
inclination, and the person’s social sta-
tus and learning. At the heart of puja,
however, is a series of transactions
between the deity and devotee (bhakta).
One such transaction comes in darshan,
the exchange of glances between
an image of the deity and a devotee,
which initiates the relationship between
the two. The other transactions come
from offerings given by the devotee, to
which the deity responds by giving
prasad sanctified by divine contact,
most often food or drink for the devotee
to consume.
Aside from the transactions, the
other most common feature of most
puja is the emphasis on purity, both of
worshiper and of context. The only
exception to this arises in certain forms
of tantra, a secret, ritually based reli-
gious practice in which the performer
deliberately inverts normal ideas of
purity and impurity (ashaucha) as a way
of symbolically destroying all duality.
[[529]]
Pujari
brahmin priest acts as an intermediary
between the high deities and other wor-
shipers, shielding the deity from poten-
tially contaminating contact. His high
ritual purity also makes the brahmin a
universal donor, from whose hand all
people can receive prasad without fear
of pollution. For further information see
C. J. Fuller, “Hindu Temple Priests,” in
T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Pujari
Puja offerings, including flowers and red tika
powder, are left for a deity as a sign of honor
and respect.
Devotees commonly purify themselves
before worship, and the purity of the
site, and the objects used in worship,
must be either established (in the case
of a place or things not generally used
for worship) or maintained (as in the
case of a temple or other regularly estab-
lished place).
In its most basic conception, the
temple is a home for the deity, a ritually
pure environment. Most temples have at
least two different “purity zones,” an
outer zone into which the devotees may
enter, and an inner zone closest to deity,
restricted to the temple priests. In their
purity requirements, deities show as
much variation as one finds in the
human community, and stricter con-
cern for purity indicates higher status,
just as for human beings. Whereas vil-
lage deities are often served by non-
brahmin priests and typically take
offerings of meat, blood, and liquor, the
higher deities are always served by brah-
min priests, and the food offered to
them is invariably vegetarian. As the rit-
ually purest of all human beings, the
[[530]]

In its most basic meaning, the word
pujari denotes “one who does puja
(worship).” In theory this word could
refer to any worshiper, but in general
usage the meaning is more restricted. It
usually designates a man performing
worship as his means of livelihood,
either as a priest in a temple, or as a
religious “technician” hired to perform
ceremonies for others. For further infor-
mation see C. J. Fuller, “Hindu Temple
Priests,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion in
India, 1991.
Pulaha
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts bring them into
being. The others are Kratu, Angiras,
Pulastya, Marichi, and Atri.
Pulakeshin II
(r. 609–42) Greatest king in the
Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much
of the Deccan peninsula from the
Chalukya capital at modern Badami.
Pulakeshin was a contemporary of the
Pushyabhuti emperor Harsha, whom
Pulakeshin defeated in battle to con-
tain Harsha’s southward expansion.
Pulakeshin also defeated the Pallava
dynasty king Mahendravarman, who
was killed in battle with Pulakeshin’s
army. He, in turn, was finally defeated
and killed by Mahendravarman’s son
Narasimhavarman. For several cen-
turies afterward, the Chalukya and
Pallava Dynasties warred with onePunjab

another, and although each was strong
enough to defeat its opponent at various
points in this conflict, neither was capa-
ble of keeping the other under subjuga-
tion. See also Pushyabhuti dynasty.
Pulastya
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts are enough to bring
them into being. The others are Kratu,
Angiras, Pulaha, Marichi, and Atri.
Pumsavana (“engendering a
male”) Samskara
In traditional calculation, the second of
the life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras).
The Pumsavana samskara was one of
the prenatal samskaras performed
before birth, done to ensure that a
newly conceived child would be a boy.
Various writers give differing prescrip-
tions as to the correct time during
the pregnancy to perform this rite, but
they generally specify that it be
performed when the moon is in a male
constellation, at which time the woman
should have several drops of the juice
from the banyan tree inserted into her
right nostril (a common practice in
traditional medicine). This samskara is
seldom performed in modern times.
Pundit
Term still used in modern times to
denote a scholar or learned man. In tra-
ditional usage, the word pundit denoted
a person proficient in Sanskrit and
Sanskrit learning.
Punjab
Modern Indian state that lies south of
the state of Jammu and Kashmir on the
border of Pakistan. Modern Punjab is
one of the so-called linguistic states, cre-
ated to unite people with a common
language and culture (in this case,
Punjabi) under one state government.
The present state of Punjab was created
in 1966, when the former state (also
called Punjab) was divided into three
areas: Punjab (the Punjabi-speaking
region), the state of Haryana (from the
[[531]]
Punya
Hindi-speaking regions), and Himachal
Pradesh (from the hill regions). The
Punjab region is replete with history, for it
has been the traditional route by which
invaders have gained access to the north-
ern Indian plains. The first of these were
the Aryans, who coined its name from the
five rivers (pancab) flowing through it.
The abundant water from these rivers,
carried by an extensive irrigation net-
work, has made the Punjab exceptionally
fertile, and today it remains the largest
wheat-growing area of India.
The Punjab is famous as the birthplace
of the Sikh religious community, and is
today the only Sikh-majority state. The
partition of India into Hindu and Muslim
states in 1947 hit the Sikhs the hardest,
since the division essentially carved their
homeland in half. In the aftermath of the
partition millions of people became
refugees, and many of them fell victim to
the atrocities of the time. For most of the
[[1980]]
s, Sikh proindependence groups
waged an undeclared war against the
Indian government. In one of the most
dramatic events of this period, the Akal
Takht, the traditional symbol for Sikh tem-
poral power, was stormed by the Indian
army in June 1984, and the Indian prime
minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated
four months later. By the mid-1990s this
movement seemed to have been quelled,
although no one can predict whether this
is permanent. Punjab is most famous for
the Sikh Harmandir (Golden Temple) in
Amritsar, a short distance from the
Jallianwala Bagh, site of a massacre that
was one of the pivotal events in the strug-
gle for Indian independence. For general
information about Punjab and all the
regions of India, an accessible reference is

Punya
(“holy”) Word most often used as a noun
to mean “religious merit”—sometimes to
denote the religious distinction arising
from a particular deed, but more often
to refer to the collective body of religious
merit one has accumulated through the
[[532]]

good deeds in one’s karmic career.
(According to the theory of karma, all of
one’s deeds will eventually be realized,
so the merit one has earned in the past is
stored up to bring benefits in the future.)
Its opposite is pap, the most general
word for religious demerit.
Purana
(“old”) An important genre of smrti texts,
and the repository of traditional Indian
mythology. The smrtis, or “remembered,”
texts were a class of literature that,
although deemed important, was consid-
ered less authoritative than the shrutis, or
“heard” texts. In brief, the shrutis denoted
the Vedas, the oldest and most authorita-
tive Hindu religious texts, whereas the
smrtis included the two great epics, name-
ly the Mahabharata and the Ramayana,
the dharma literature, the Bhagavad Gita,
and the compendia known as the puranas.
According to one traditional defini-
tion, a purana should contain accounts
of at least five essential things: the cre-
ation of the earth, its dissolution and
recreation, origins of the gods and patri-
archs, the reigns of the Manvantaras,
and the reigns of the Solar and Lunar
Lines. In practice, the puranas are com-
pendia of all types of sacred lore, from
mythic tales to ritual instruction to exal-
tation of various sacred sites (tirthas)
and actions. Individual puranas are
usually highly sectarian and intended to
promote the worship of one of the
Hindu gods, whether Vishnu, Shiva, or
the Goddess. By tradition the major
puranas number eighteen, but there are
hundreds of minor works. Along with
the epics, the puranas are the store-
houses of the mythic tales that are the
common religious currency for tradi-
tional Hindus. In this respect the
puranas are much more influential than
any of the Vedas, because the tales in
the puranas are common knowledge.
The contents of the Vedas, though more
authoritative, are less well known.
Judgments on the importance of indi-
vidual puranas vary according to sec-
tarian persuasion, but some of thePuri
Rath Yatra festival in Puri.
most important puranas are the Agni
Purana, Shiva Purana, Brahma Purana,
Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana,
Harivamsha, and Markandeya Purana.

puranic texts, see Cornelia Dimmitt and

Mythology, 1978.
Purana Kassapa
In early Indian philosophy, philosopher
opposed to moral rules, whose views are
mentioned in Buddhist scriptures.
According to these texts, Kassapa
believed that there was no religious
merit in good acts, and no demerit in
evil acts—that neither of these had any
affect on the Self at all. Beyond this, very
little is known about him.
Purandaradas
(1480–1564) A devotee (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu who was the founder of the
Haridasas, a sect of saint-composers in
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
Aside from the literary merits of the
poetry Purandaradas wrote, the musical
structure of his songs is believed to have
laid the foundations for the Karnatic
school of Indian music, the predomi-
nant musical form in southern India.
Purattasi
The sixth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Kanya (the zodiacal sign
of Virgo), which usually falls within
September and October. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Puri
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the Bay
of Bengal in the state of Orissa. Puri is
best known for its temple to the god
Jagannath, a local deity assimilated
[[533]]
Puri Dashanami
into the pantheon as a form of the god
Krishna and therefore, by extension, a
form of Vishnu. The temple was com-
pleted in 1198 C.E. and is currently
receiving much needed restoration,
after several pieces fell off the tower in
the early 1990s. The most important
annual festival held in Puri is the Rath
Yatra. During this festival, Jagannath,
his brother Balabhadra, and his sister
Subhadra are carried in procession
through the city’s main street in enor-
mous wooden carts. They travel to
another temple about a mile away,
where they stay for a week, and then
return to Puri. Aside from the spectacle,
the ceremony is an important ritual
theater used to demonstrate the rela-
tionship between Jagannath and the
kings of Puri, who were considered to
be deputies ruling in his name.
Although the kings no longer wield
actual power in modern times, by
virtue of their status they still play an
important ritual role.
Aside from containing the temple
of Jagannath, Puri is one of the four
dhams, which symbolically mark the
geographic boundaries of India. It is
also the home of the Govardhan
Math, one of the four Dashanami
Sanyasi sacred centers supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. Puri’s character as a
holy city has made it an attractive
place for religiously inclined people to
make their homes, most notably the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533),
who lived there for much of his adult
life. The cultural life generated by the
worship of Jagannath also made Puri
a center for the arts, and it is the
traditional home of the classical
dance form known as Orissi. For fur-
ther information see Anncharlott
Eschmann, Hermann Kulke, and Gaya
Charan Tripathi, The Cult of
Jagannath and the Regional Tradition
of Orissa, 1978; and Frederique Apffel
Marglin, “Time Renewed: Ratha Jatra
in Puri,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
[[534]]

Puri Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The
Dashanamis were supposedly estab-
lished by the ninth century philosopher
Shankaracharya in an effort to create a
corps of learned men who could help to
revitalize Hindu life. Each of the divi-
sions is designated by a different
name—in this case, puri (“city”). Upon
initiation, new members are given this
name as their new surname, thus allow-
ing for immediate group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are also
divided into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquarters
in one of the four monastic centers
(maths) supposedly established by
Shankaracharya, as well as other partic-
ular religious associations. The Puri
Dashanamis belong to the Kitawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Shringeri Math in the southern Indian
town of Shringeri.
Purity
(shaucha) Along with its opposite,
impurity (ashaucha), purity is one of the
fundamental concepts in Hindu culture.
Although to outsiders purity can be eas-
ily confused with cleanliness, it is funda-
mentally different—purity is a religious
category marked by the presence or
absence of pollution or defilement,
whereas cleanliness is a hygienic cate-
gory. In some cases these categories can
overlap, but in most their disjunction
becomes clear. For example, from a reli-
gious perspective, bathing (snana) in
the Ganges River makes one pure,
whereas from a hygienic perspective the
lower reaches of the Ganges are quite
heavily polluted.
On a personal level, purity can be
best described as the absence of defile-
ment, gained through removing impuri-
ties in some manner, most often by
bathing. After becoming purified, one
remains pure until coming into contact
with a source of impurity. These sourcesPurohit
of impurity include essential bodily
functions, such as urination and evacu-
ation; sexual activity; contact with
impure things both inside and outside
one’s home; and even contact with cer-
tain groups of people deemed impure.
Thus, although purity is always easy to
regain, it is impossible to retain, since it
is breached by many of the actions of
everyday life. It is also important to real-
ize that impurity brings no moral stigma
to an individual—becoming impure
means simply that one has come into
contact with some contaminant, and
that this must be removed. The only
times when purity is particularly impor-
tant are in worship and in eating—the
former to keep from contaminating
the deities and their environs, the latter
to protect oneself, since the circum-
stances surrounding what one eats
are considered to have long-term effects
on an individual.
Aside from its personal dimension,
purity has a social dimension as well.
Higher status groups, such as brah-
mins, are considered to have inherently
higher ritual purity. This social dimen-
sion of purity comes with birth and is
the religious basis determining the
hierarchical divisions in the traditional
social system. To some extent, a
group’s purity level corresponds to its
hereditary occupation. People who
had continual contact with substances
considered impure (such as latrine
cleaners, corpse burners, and scav-
engers) were seen as tainted by work,
and rendered impure. Brahmins, as
scholars and priests (the latter a task
that brought them in contact with the
gods), were the purest. Between these
extremes fell the other groups, whose
relative status in a specific locale was
determined by local factors. For theo-
retical consideration of the impor-
tance that purity plays in modern
Hindu life, see Louis Dumont, Homo
Hierarchicus, 1980; for another analy-
sis of social ordering, see McKim
Marriot,

Purochana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Purochana is a minis-
ter of Duryodhana, the epic’s antago-
nist. He advises Duryodhana to build the
House of Lac as a means to kill the
Pandavas, the five brothers who are
Duryodhana’s cousins, and the epic’s
protagonists. After the Pandavas move
into the House of Lac, Purochana sets
fire to it. The Pandavas, whose uncle
Vidura has alerted them to the danger,
are able to escape through a secret
underground passage, but Purochana
himself is killed in the fire.
Purohit
(“[one] placed in front”) The most
important of the priestly functionaries
in the cult of sacrifice found in
the Brahmanas. The purohit was
[[535]]
Pururavas
responsible for supervising the other
sacrificing priests, such as the rtvij
and the hotr, and for making sure that
the animal sacrifices were completed
without error. The purohit would often
be attached to a particular ruler and
was also called to perform rites for
communal well-being. In modern times
this latter meaning has persisted, the
word is often used to denote one’s family
priest, who will perform various rituals
for the family.
Pururavas
In Hindu mythology, a prominent king
of a royal lineage who trace their ances-
try to the moon. Pururavas is a righteous
king who performs one hundred horse
sacrifices (ashvamedha), and the merit
from these gives him great power. He is
best known for his dalliance with the
celestial nymph (apsara) Urvashi, by
whom he has several children. Although
the two are forced to spend sixty years
apart because of a curse, in the end they
are happily reunited.
Purusha
(“person”) One of the two fundamental
first principles in the Samkhya philo-
sophical school, the other one being
prakrti (“nature”). Samkhya upholds an
atheistic philosophical dualism in
which the twin principles of purusha
and prakrti—roughly, spirit and
nature—are the source of all things.
Purusha is conceived as conscious but
completely inactive and unchanging. It
is the passive witness to the myriad
transformations of prakrti going on
around it, and as the source of con-
sciousness purusha is ultimately identi-
fied with a person’s true Self (atman).
Thus purusha is inferred as plural, given
the plurality of conscious beings and
the fact that one person can gain final
enlightenment while all the rest remain
in bondage. According to the Samkhyas,
the ultimate source of bondage lies in
people’s failure to distinguish between
purusha and prakrti and in identifying
[[536]]

the Self with the latter rather than the
former. For further information see
Gerald Larson and Ram Shankar
Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya, 1987;
and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Purushartha
The Aims of Life, traditionally num-
bered at four: material wealth and
power (artha), pleasure (kama), reli-
gious duty (dharma), and final libera-
tion (moksha). All of these were seen as
legitimate goals in traditional Hindu
society. See Aims of Life.
Purusha Sukta
(“Hymn to the Primeval Man”) The most
common name for the hymn in the Rg
Veda (10.90) that describes the creation
of the material and social world as the
result of a primordial sacrifice.
According to the text, in the beginning
there was one primeval man, who was
dismembered in sacrifice. Different
parts of his body became different parts
of the physical universe, as well as the
four traditional major social groups
(varnas): the brahmins came from the
primeval man’s mouth, the kshatriyas
from his shoulders, the vaishyas from
his thighs (a common euphemism for
the genitals), and the shudras from his
feet. This hymn clearly reflects the sacri-
ficial paradigm that was so central to the
later Brahmana literature, and is thus
believed to be one of the latest hymns in
the Rg Veda. It is also notable for giving
the first known articulation of the four
varnas, as well as the symbolic functions
associated with each: for brahmins,
speech and the authority of the sacred
word; for kshatriyas, protection and
military valor; for vaishyas, generation
and production, and for shudras, service
to others.
Purushottama Mas
Religious observance that occurs when
the intercalary month falls during thePurva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa
lunar month of Ashadh. The intercalary
month is an extra lunar month inserted
into the calendar about every thirty
months, to maintain general agreement
between the solar and lunar calendar. It
begins after any “regular” lunar month
in which the sun has not moved into the
next sign of the zodiac, and takes the
name of the preceding month. Since the
intercalary month is an unusual phe-
nomenon, it is generally considered to
be inauspicious, and the most common
colloquial name for this month is the
malamasa, the “impure month.” When
this extra month falls in the lunar month
of Ashadh, however, devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu take the opposite per-
spective and treat it as an exceedingly
holy time, dedicated to Vishnu in his
form as Purushottama (“best of men”).
Vaishnavas celebrate this month by
reading the sacred texts, chanting
Vishnu’s divine names, and other sorts
of worship. The month of Ashadh, and
its intercalary month, are especially
important for the Jagannath temple in
the city of Puri, whose presiding deity,
Jagannath, is considered a form of
Krishna and therefore, by extension, a
form of Vishnu. During every year
Ashadh is the month in which the Rath
Yatra festival is performed in Puri, and in
years when the intercalary month falls in
Ashadh, new images of Jagannath and
his siblings are created.
Purva (“Earlier”) Mimamsa
One of the six schools of traditional
Hindu philosophy, most commonly
referred to simply as Mimamsa (“inves-
tigation”); it was given the name Purva
Mimamsa to distinguish it from the
Uttara (“Later”) Mimamsa school, better
known as Vedanta. The Mimamsa
school’s name is quite apt, for it empha-
sizes the investigation of dharma
(“righteous action”), particularly as
revealed in the Vedas, the earliest and
most authoritative Hindu religious texts.
Mimamsas affirmed that the Vedas were
the source of perfect knowledge, and
believed that the Vedas had not been
composed either by God or by human
beings but were rather simply heard
by the ancient sages through their
advanced powers of perception, and
then transmitted orally from generation
to generation.
Since they accepted the Vedas as the
primary source of authority and assumed
that the Vedas contained codes and pre-
scriptions pertaining to dharma, the
Mimamsas then developed complex
rules for textual interpretation to dis-
cern these, and it is for these rules that
they are best known. Mimamsas
believed in the existence of the soul and
in the necessary connection of actions
with their results inherent in the notion
of karma—two ideas attested to in the
Vedas. In cases where the result of an
action comes some time after the act, the
Mimamsas believed that the result existed
as an unseen force called apurva. This
force would invariably bring on the result,
thus maintaining the Vedic truth. The
Mimamsas were less unified on the exis-
tence of God. Jaimini (4th c. B.C.E.?), the
author of the Mimamsa Sutras and the
founder of the school, seems to ignore the
issue completely, and 1,000 years later
another Mimamsa luminary, Kumarila,
argued against the existence of God.
Aside from developing methods for
interpreting the Vedas, Mimamsas also
contributed to logic and epistemology.
One of their notable contributions was
postulating two new pramanas, which
are the means by which human beings
can gain true and accurate knowledge.
All the philosophical schools accepted
perception (pratyaksha) as a pramana,
and most also accepted inference (anu-
mana) and authoritative testimony
(shabda). The two new modes devel-
oped by the Mimamsas were “presump-
tion” (arthapatti) and “knowledge from
absence” (abhava). The Mimamsas jus-
tified these additions by claiming that
they accounted for knowledge that
could not be subsumed under the exist-
ing pramanas. Arthapatti is an inference
from circumstance, in which a judg-
ment is made about one case based
solely on similarities to related cases. An

example would be the presumption that
a traveler had reached his or her desti-
nation after the train’s arrival time had
passed. According to Indian philosophy,
this is not a true inference, since the lat-
ter must always be confirmed by direct
perception. In the same way, abhava or
the perception of any absence (e.g., the
absence of some object before one)
could not be accounted for by any of
the existing pramanas, and thus
required this new one to explain it.
Aside from Jaimini, the two most sig-
nificant figures among the Mimamsas
are Kumarila and Prabhakara, who
both lived in the seventh century. For
further information see Karl H. Potter,
Presuppositions of India’s Philosophies,
[[1972]]
; and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and
Charles A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in
Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Pushan
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts,
Pushan is one of the deities identified
with the Sun. Due to this connection,
Pushan is described as the witness to all
[[538]]

things; he is also considered to be the
keeper and protector of flocks, and
bringer of prosperity. By the turn of the
common era, and perhaps significantly
earlier, his presence had almost com-
pletely disappeared, and today he
remains only historically important.
Pushan
(2) In Hindu mythology, the name of an
aditya (minor deity) who attends the
sacrifice sponsored by the demigod
Daksha. The sacrifice is a disaster, since
Daksha insults the god Shiva by not
inviting him to the ceremony. When
Daksha’s daughter Sati, who is also
Shiva’s wife, inquires why Shiva has
been excluded, Daksha begins to insult
her in full view of the company.
Mortified and humiliated, Sati commits
suicide. When Shiva learns of this,
he comes with his ghoulish minions
and utterly destroys the sacrifice. In
the process many of the guests
suffer injuries or indignities, and
Pushan’s teeth are broken and lost.Pushti Marg
Pushkar
(“blue lotus”) City and celebrated sacred
site (tirtha) a few miles north and west
of the city of Ajmer in the state of
Rajasthan. Pushkar’s center is a natural
lake, and its major importance is as a
bathing (snana) place—according to
tradition, its lake is so holy that Pushkar
is said to be the religious preceptor
(guru) of all other sacred sites. Pushkar’s
lake is surrounded by temples. Of these,
the best-known is dedicated to the god
Brahma and is his only temple in all of
India. Two nearby temples dedicated to
the Goddess are said to be Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites spread
throughout the subcontinent and
sacred to the Goddess. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth.
The two temples in Pushkar mark the
places where both of Sati’s wrists fell.
Pushkar’s largest festival is known as
Kartik Purnima (October–November),
and falls on a full moon (generally asso-
ciated with enhancing the sanctity of
bathing places). Aside from being a time
for bathing, this event is also marked by
the holding of an enormous livestock
market, particularly for camels and
horses. The state government is currently
promoting this as a tourist attraction,
and it has drawn over 200,000 people in
recent years. See also pitha.
ways and often depends on the wor-
shiper’s inclinations. In some cases the
flowers will simply be presented before
the deity’s image, with the understand-
ing that the deity has taken them,
whereas in other cases flowers will
be placed on the deity’s image, or a
garland hung around its neck. In
either instance, the underlying motive
is to show love and respect for the
deity and to minister to its needs as
one would to a living person. This par-
ticular act of respect and love can also
be accorded to other human beings;
garlanding a person with flowers is a
sign of high esteem or congratulations.
Pushpak Viman
In traditional mythic geography, the
name of the seventh and outermost
of the concentric land masses (dvipas)
making up the visible world. See
also cosmology.(“Flower chariot”) In Hindu mythology,
the most famous of the aerial cars.
Pushpak Viman is built by the divine
architect Vishvakarma. Vishvakarma’s
daughter Sanjna has married the Sun
but is so overwhelmed by his brilliance
that she begs her father to reduce his
luster so she can stand to be with him.
Vishvakarma does this by trimming
some bits off the sun, which are later
fashioned into the Pushpak Viman as
well as several divine weapons. For
some time the Pushpak Viman is held
by the minor deity Kubera, who obtains
it as a reward for performing intense
physical asceticism (tapas). It is later
taken from Kubera by the demon-king
Ravana, who uses its powers to wreak all
sorts of tyranny, culminating in the
abduction of Rama’s wife Sita. After
slaying Ravana, Rama uses the Pushpak
Viman to return to the city of Ayodhya
and then returns the car to Kubera.

philosopher Vallabhacharya (1479–1531),
whose teachings remain the sect’s pri-
mary influence. Vallabhacharya charac-
terized his philosophical position as
“pure monism” (Shuddadvaita); his fun-
damental position is that the god
Krishna is the Supreme Being and the
[[539]]
Pushyabhuti Dynasty
ultimate source of everything that exists.
The world, and human beings, thus
share in his divine nature, although only
in a limited fashion, and the human soul
is imbued with divinity as its inner light
and controller.
Since Krishna is the ultimate source
of everything and thus everything
depends ultimately on God, the school’s
primary religious emphasis is on the
importance of God’s grace. This grace is
seen as nourishing (pushti) the devotee
(bhakta) and is best attained by devo-
tion (bhakti), which is conceived of as
the only effective religious path. This
emphasis on grace and devotion has
meant that the Pushti Marg have put lit-
tle stress on asceticism or renunciation,
and the bulk of Vallabhacharya’s
followers came from affluent merchant
communities. The stress on devotion
was soon articulated in elaborately
arranged forms of image worship in the
Pushti Marg’s temples. Devotees would
visualize themselves as Krishna’s com-
panions during his daily activities—
waking, eating, taking his cows to
graze, coming home, etc.—and thus
gain the opportunity to take part in the
divine play (lila). This emphasis on
visualization and participation was fos-
tered through the development of vast
liturgical resources, which were com-
posed by eight poets (the ashtachap)
who were associated with Vallabhacharya
and Vitthalnath, his son and successor.
The third leader, Vitthalnath’s son
Gokulnath, further consolidated the
developing community, whose major
sacred site is now in Nathdwara in the
state of Rajasthan. For further informa-
tion see R.K. Barz, The Bhakti Sect of
Vallabhacharya, 1976.
Pushyabhuti Dynasty
(6th–7th c.) Northern Indian dynasty
whose capital was at Kanyakubja, the
modern city of Kanuaj in the Ganges
river basin, and whose territory ran
through the northern Indian plain from
the Punjab to Bihar. The Pushyabhutis
filled the northern Indian political
[[540]]

vacuum after the demise of the Gupta
empire and in some measure regained
its greatness. The dynasty’s greatest
ruler was the emperor Harsha
(r. 606–47), whose reign was chronicled
in panegyric fashion by the playwright
Bana, and perhaps more factually by the
Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hsuan Tsang.
The latter’s journals give a detailed
picture both of Harsha himself, in whose
court Hsuan Tsang stayed for some time,
and of everyday life in Harsha’s
kingdom. See also Gupta dynasty.
Pustaka
A book, traditionally made of palm
leaves connected by a string running
through a hole punched in the middle,
with a wooden cover on top and bottom
to keep the leaves from being bent or
broken. In Indian iconography, the book
is most strongly associated with the
goddess Saraswati, in keeping with her
identity as the patron deity of the arts,
culture, and learning. It also commonly
appears as one of the objects held by the
god Brahma.
Putana
In Hindu mythology, Putana is one of
the demon assassins sent by Kamsa,
the king of Mathura, in an attempt to
kill his nephew, the child-god Krishna.
Through her magic powers, Putana
assumes the form of a beautiful young
woman and, after cooing over Krishna
for awhile, puts him to suckle at her poi-
soned breast. When Krishna latches on,
however, it is Putana who is in dire trou-
ble—Krishna sucks at her breast so hard
that he sucks the life right out of her. As
she dies, she reverts to her original form,
gigantic and hideous, and the crash of
her falling body shakes the earth and
fells trees.
Putrada Ekadashi
Religious observance that occurs twice
per year: on the eleventh day (ekadashi)
of the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Shravan (July–August), andPuttaparthi
on the eleventh day of the bright (wax-
ing) half of the lunar month of Paush
(December–January). As with all the
eleventh-day observances, these are
dedicated to the god Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, which usually involve fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. Faithfully observing the
ekadashi rites on these days is believed
to give one a son (putra), which is a
major concern in traditional Indian cul-
ture. Sons are necessary for this world
and the next, not only to care for their
parents in their old age, but also to
perform certain ancestral rites after
one’s death. The strength of this
desire for sons is demonstrated by the
