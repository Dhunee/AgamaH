Obscenity
Traditional Hindu culture can be char-
acterized as straightlaced, even prudish,
with regard to sexuality; any public
mention of sexuality is taboo in polite
society. The exception of ritually sanc-
tioned obscenity comes before and dur-
ing the festival of Holi, which usually
occurs in March. Holi is a “festival of
reversal,” in which most social taboos
are temporarily suspended. Holi comes
very close to the end of the lunar year,
and symbolizes the end of time, when all
norms and standards have been lost. In
recent times the license and lawlessness
associated with Holi have led many peo-
ple to stop celebrating it in public, par-
ticularly in the cities.
Ocean, Churning of the
Famous mythic event in which the gods
and demons churned the Ocean of Milk
to produce the nectar or immortality.

Offerings
One of the pervasive realities in Hindu
religious life is the importance of transac-
tions or exchanges—both between
human beings, and between humans and
superhuman beings. The importance of
these exchanges makes various offerings a
fundamental part of Hindu worship. One
set of sixteen offerings, known as the
upacharas, are given to a deity as part of
worship, on the model of treating the deity
as an honored guest—inviting the deity
inside, offering the deity a seat, a drink of
water, and so forth. In the naivedya, one
offers the deity food, perhaps the most
fundamental courtesy of all.

Om
A sacred sound. According to tradition,
it should be uttered before and after
reading the Vedas (the oldest Hindu reli-
gious texts), saying any prayer, or per-
forming any sacred rite. When uttered at
the beginning of a rite, it is believed to
remove obstacles, and when uttered at
the end it is seen as a concluding affir-
mation. Because of its pervasive ritual
use, the sound Om is regarded as the
essence of all holy speech. As early as
the Mandukya Upanishad, the sound’s
phonetic elements (A, U, and M) were
interpreted as corresponding to differ-
ent states of consciousness, and ulti-
mately designating the Self (atman). See
also four states of consciousness.
Omens
The notions of auspiciousness and
inauspiciousness are deeply rooted in
Hindu life, and are based on the
assumption that by their very nature
certain things bring good fortune, and
certain other things bring ill fortune.
The notion of omens is an extension of
this idea; omens are important not
because they cause good or bad fortune
in themselves, but because they indicate
conditions that are present. According
to this belief, auspicious conditions will
automatically give rise to favorable
omens, and inauspicious conditions to
unfavorable omens. Omens serve as
indicators to help judge the current state
of affairs and make any necessary
adjustments. For example, if on leaving
the house to do some business one sees
a person deemed inauspicious, one
should return to the home and begin
again, lest the work be fruitless.
Omkareshvar
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) on an
island in the Narmada River in the state
of Madhya Pradesh, about fifty miles
southeast of the city of Indore. The tem-
ple is named after its presiding deity, the
god Shiva in his manifestation as the
“Lord of [the sound] Om,” an utteranceOrdeal, Trial By
claimed to symbolize the entire uni-
verse, according to the early specula-
tive texts known as the Upanishads.
Omkareshvar is one of the twelve
jyotirlingas, a network of sites at
which Shiva is uniquely present.
According to the site’s mythic charter,
Shiva appears there to reward the sage
Mandhata, who has performed harsh
asceticism (tapas) to gain a vision of
Shiva. The image at the site is a “self-
manifested” (svayambhu) form of
Shiva—an unshaped, roundish black
stone emerging from the earth, while
nearby is a white stone considered to
be a manifestation of Shiva’s wife,
Parvati. Viewing this image is believed
to grant all of one’s desires, just as it did
for Mandhata. Worship at the site con-
tinues all year, but during Kartik
Purnima, the full moon in the lunar
month of Kartik (October–November),
there is a major bathing (snana) festival
at the site.
Onam
The festival of Onam, in the southern
Indian state of Kerala, is celebrated
in the Malayalam month of Chingal,
which corresponds to the northern
Indian
month
of
Bhadrapada
(August–September). Onam is a four-
day harvest festival highlighted by races
in elaborately carved boats known as
“snake boats,” some of which are large
enough to carry 100 paddlers. The most
famous of these boat races are held in
the Keralan town of Aleppey.
Oraon
Northern Indian tribal (adivasi) com-
munity. The Oraons are concentrated
in the southwestern corner of modern
Bihar, in the geologic region known as
the Ranchi Plateau. The land is quite
poor, and for many life is very difficult.
For a discussion of the difficulties of
Oraon life, see Sudhir Kakar, Shamans,
Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Ordeal, Trial By
Trial by ordeal was one of the traditional
means for establishing a person’s guilt or
innocence. Ordeals were considered a
“divine” proof, but could only be used in
cases when human proofs such as evi-
dence or eyewitness testimony were
inadequate or unobtainable. Crimes
committed in secret or in lonely places,
questions of sexual consent, or money
left for deposit were proven by these tri-
als, following a carefully established rit-
ual procedure. The trial could be done in
four different ways: fire, water, balance,
or poison.
The fire ordeal entailed carrying a
red-hot iron ball, licking a red-hot plow-
share, or removing a ring or coin from a
vessel of boiling oil, with guilt or inno-
cence established by whether or not one
was burned. The water ordeal entailed
remaining underwater for a specified
length of time, with guilt determined by
the inability to do so. The balance ordeal
was done by successive weighings, with
the conviction that a guilty person
would become progressively heavier.
The poison ordeal was performed either
by consuming poison, or by safely
removing a coin from an earthen pot
containing a cobra; innocence was
established by surviving.
There were fairly strict prescriptions
governing which of these ordeals certain
people were allowed to perform.
Women, the elderly, and the infirm were
subjected to the test of balance; brah-
mins were generally forbidden from
undertaking ordeal by poison. In every
case the actual ordeal was preceded by
the person proclaiming his or her inno-
cence, followed by declarations praising
the saving power of truth and the
damning force of untruth. Historians
speculate that these required declara-
tions helped make the ordeal more reli-
able. For instance, in the ordeal of
licking a red-hot plowshare, a guilty per-
son might be significantly more nervous
and thus have less moisture on the
tongue. Similarly, the nervousness dur-
ing the water ordeal may have impeded

a person’s ability to hold his breath.
Whether or not these speculations have
any merit, the most important feature in
the original Hindu context was the belief
in the power of truth itself.

Orissa
A state in modern India on the eastern
coast between the states of Andhra
Pradesh and West Bengal. Orissa traces
its roots to the kingdom of Kalinga and
the bloody conquest by the Mauryan
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–232 B.C.E.).
During the early medieval period the
Kesari and Ganga dynasties built stun-
ning temples, many of which exist today.
Modern Orissa is largely undeveloped,
and a large percentage of its people are
indigenous tribal peoples (adivasis).
Historically, Hindu culture has been
manifest in the coastal regions, whereas
the interior has been tribal land. Orissa’s
sacred sites include the Ganga-era
temples in the state capital of

Bhubaneshvar, the sacred city of Puri,

Orissi
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Kathak,
Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali,
and Manipuri. Dance in Orissa dates to
the second century B.C.E.; the present
Orissi style has its roots in the dance
performed at the temple of the god
Jagannath in Puri. The temple itself was
built in the eleventh century; the sub-
sidiary part, known as the natamandira
(“dance-hall”), was built about a century
later. The latter period was the era of the
poet Jayadeva, whose lyric poem, the
Gitagovinda, is the only non-scriptural
poem that can be recited in the temple.
According to tradition, Jayadeva’s wife,
Padmavati, was one of the dancers in
the temple, and it was she who first
danced parts of the Gitagovinda as an
offering to Jagannath. As dance at theOwl
temple evolved, two categories of tem-
ple dancers emerged: those allowed to
dance in the inner sanctum, and those
allowed to dance in the natamandira.
In the seventeenth century, a third
type of dance emerged—boys dressed
as dancing girls performed for general
entertainment both outside and inside
the temple. The latter dance tended to
be more athletic and acrobatic, where-
as the women’s dance was more gentle
and lyrical.
The modern Orissi style combines
both elements. The most characteristic
stance is the chauka (“square”), in which
the feet are spread wide and pointed in
opposite directions, with the knees
bent so that the upper leg is parallel to
the ground. The arms are held in a mir-
roring position, bent at the elbow with
the upper arms horizontal, and the
lower arms and hands pointing straight
down. The dance’s stylistic impression
is one of roundness and fluidity, creat-
ed by rippling movements in the upper
body during the dance. As in all the
Indian dances, Orissi has a well-devel-
oped vocabulary of gesture and expres-
sion, making complex story-telling
possible. The modern Orissi dance form
has been shaped by the shift from tem-
ple to stage in the twentieth century;
this change of venue has been primarily
responsible for its “classical” form
becoming more rigidly defined than in
the past. For further information see

Classical Dance, 1984.

else, such as deeper wisdom. In modern
Hindi, calling someone an “owl” is a mild
insult, referring to the other as a “fool.”
