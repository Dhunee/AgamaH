Calendar
One of the most fundamental Hindu
religious beliefs is that different times
carry different qualities. Whereas some
times are considered more auspicious
and propitious, others are more inauspi-
cious and dangerous. These judgments
may either describe the general qualities
of specific times or determine the prop-
er time for carrying out particular activ-
ities. Thus Hindus have given
considerable attention to organizing
time and predicting auspicious
moments. Many modern Hindus simul-
taneously use several different calen-
dars, although they may use them for
different purposes. To begin with, every-
day timekeeping is done with the
Gregorian calendar of the common era,
which may reflect the influence of the
British empire or, more simply, the influ-
ence of modern commerce and commu-
nications. It is notable that the only
holidays celebrated according to this
calendar are national holidays such as
Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti,
and Republic Day—all of which are
fixed on particular days. Beyond this
there are many other methods of mea-
suring time, some of which overlap with
each other and some of which are found
only in certain regions of the country.
Several of these systems are based on
the movement of the sun. The most
basic unit, of course, is the solar day,
which traditionally begins and ends not
by the clock but by the rising of the sun.
The week contains seven solar days. The
movement of the sun divides the year
into halves, with the uttarayana period
occurring when the sun is moving
northward and the dakshinayana period
taking place when the sun is moving
[[130]]

southward. There are also two separate
versions of the solar year, each of which
has twelve solar months. In northern
India these months correspond to the
twelve signs of the zodiac and mark the
sun’s passage through them. In southern
India one finds an identical calendar,
the Tamil solar year, in which the names
of the months are drawn from the
names of certain nakshatras, or signs of
the lunar zodiac.
Whereas the solar calendar is usually
used for astrological purposes, the lunar
calendar is important for religious life.
The lunar calendar is used to measure
the two eras still used for dating history:
the Vikram era (fifty-six or fifty-seven
years later than the common era) and
the Shaka era (seventy-eight years earlier
than the common era). The lunar year is
made up of twelve lunar months, each
of which has thirty lunar days. Since the
cycle of the moon is only about twenty-
eight solar days, a lunar day is slightly
shorter than a solar day. The lunar
month is divided into two halves of fif-
teen days each: the “dark” (krishna pak-
sha) half, when the moon is waning and
that ends with the new moon; and the
“light” (shukla paksha) half when the
moon is waxing and that culminates in
the full moon. In northern India the
lunar month begins with the moon’s
dark half, and ends on the full moon,
whereas in the south the reverse is often
true. Since the solar year has about 365
days and the lunar year about 354, if left
uncorrected each lunar year would
begin eleven solar days earlier than the
previous one. To correct this discrepancy,
an intercalary month is added about
every two and a half years. This helps to
keep the lunar months falling at around
the same time every year, although the
celebration of a particular festival can
vary by several weeks from one year to
the next.
Almost all Hindu festivals are
celebrated according to the lunar
calendar. Some festivals’ celebrations
are associated with certain lunar days
and thus occur twenty-four times in a
twelve-month lunar year: The eleventhCaste
day (ekadashi) of each half of the lunar
month is sacred to the god Vishnu; the
eighth day (ashtami) is devoted to the
Goddess, particularly in her form as
Durga; the evening of the thirteenth day
(trayodashi) and the fourteenth day
(chaturdashi) are sacred to the god
Shiva; and the fourth day (chaturthi) is
dedicated to the god Ganesh. The time
for celebrating annual religious festivals
is set according to the lunar month, the
half of the moon, and the particular
lunar day. For example, the god
Krishna’s birthday is celebrated on
Bhadrapada Krishna eight, the eighth
day of the dark (waning) half of the lunar
month of Bhadrapada. The birthdays of
many important historical religious fig-
ures such as Guru Nanak, the founder of
the Sikh community; the Buddha, and
the devotional poet-saints are also cele-
brated according to the lunar calendar.
These overlapping calendars mean
that any particular day can be designat-
ed by several different markers: the day
of the week and the day in the common
era (as in many societies), the day
according to the traditional solar calen-
dar, and the day according to the lunar
calendar. Depending on the context—
business, astrological, or festival—any
one of these may be given preference.

ness, and Tamil months.
Campantar
Tamil form of the name for the poet-
saint Sambandar. See Sambandar.
Caste
The best-known term to denote the tra-
ditional Hindu social structure in which
groups are arranged in a hierarchy of
status, usually based on the perceived
purity of each group’s traditional occu-
pation. The word “caste” is actually
derived from the Portuguese word for
“chaste.” The Portuguese observed that
different groups in Indian society kept
themselves separate from each other, par-
ticularly when eating and in marriage.
They used the term “caste” to describe
this social phenomenon.
Among Hindus themselves the most
important concept for social ordering is
known as the jati (“birth”). One
becomes a member of a jati by being
born into it. The jatis were usually divided
according to traditional occupation,
which (in theory) would be performed
by that jati alone. A jati’s social status
generally stemmed from the status of its
occupation, and jatis such as latrine
cleaners and tanners were thought to be
defiled by their trade. Society as a whole
was conceived on the model of the body,
with the different jatis comparable to
different body parts. While each part
had a differing status and role, every one
was necessary for the whole to function
smoothly. These differences in status
were marked and reinforced by strict
rules to keep each group distinct from
the others. The strictest regulations were
in regard to marriage, and in earlier
times members of a jati would marry
only within that group. It was almost as
if the jatis were seen as separate
“species” of human beings that had to
be kept apart. Marrying within one’s jati
is still the ideal, although there is now
considerably more intermarriage than
in the past.
The best-known model for ordering
Indian society is that of the four major
social groups (varna) described in the
dharma literature: brahmin (priest),
kshatriya (warrior-king), vaishya (mer-
chant), and shudra (servant). However,
the number of different jati groups
makes the social hierarchy far more
complex. A small village might have
dozens of jatis, all performing certain
tasks, whereas a city might have hun-
dreds of jatis, some highly specialized.
Even within the brahmin varna, there
are different brahmin jatis (for example,
Saraswat, Chitpavan, Kanyakubja, and
Kanaujia). For other varnas the picture
is even more complex. For instance,
some jati groups fall between the
vaishya and shudra varnas, and jati
groups of humble status who have
achieved political success may claim
[[131]]
Castration
kshatriya lineage. The same jati’s social
position can vary from region to region,
depending on if they comprise a major-
ity or a minority of the population or
have status as a land-holding community.
As in most of Hindu life, a group’s status
is usually influenced by local factors; in
the past fifty years, such status determi-
nations have also been affected by
changes in Indian society, which have
tended to relax social distinctions. For
further information see McKim Marriot,
“Hindu Transactions: Diversity Without
Dualism,” in Bruce Kapferer (ed.),
Transaction and Meaning, 1976.
Castration
Castration of human beings has been
almost completely absent in Indian his-
tory, with the notable exception of the
hijras. Hijras are male cross-dressers
who dress and behave as women and
have usually undergone self-castration
as a ritual renunciation of their sexuality.
Hijras are often homosexual prostitutes,
and they are an established part of the
decadent underside of most Indian
cities. Their most important ritual func-
tion is to sing and dance at the houses in
which a male child has been born, but
they may also be called to perform on
other auspicious occasions. Despite the
hijras’ associations with certain auspi-
cious occasions, they are marginal to
society and have very low social status.
For a reliable study of the hijras, see
Serena Nanda, Neither Man Nor Woman,

Causal Chains
The underlying ultimate concern in all
Indian philosophical schools is to
uncover and understand the causal
forces that keep human beings
enmeshed in samsara, the continual
cycle of reincarnation. One of the ways
that Indian philosophers attempted to
do this was to formulate various chains
of cause and effect detailing the process
through which human beings become
subject to the bondage of karma. By
[[132]]

understanding this process, they hope
to be able to manipulate it, ultimately
leading to the final liberation of the soul
(moksha). The oldest causal chains were
formulated by the Buddha and the Jains.
In each of these theories, avidya, or lack
of genuine understanding, starts the
causal chain. In the Buddhist and Jain
traditions, these causal chains can be
broken by a religious discipline that
begins with moral action and at more
advanced levels involves meditation
and wisdom.
Causal chains in Hindu philosophy
have much in common with these
beliefs, particularly the notion that
avidya is the basic problem. In the
Nyaya Sutras, the Nyaya philosopher
Gautama propounded a five-fold causal
chain: pain, birth, activity, defect, and
wrong notion. Each of these elements
is caused by the one succeeding it
and is eliminated with the destruction
of its cause. The Vaisheshika school,
which was traditionally paired with
the Nyayas, also used this model. The
causal chain in the Samkhya philosoph-
ical school, as described by its founder,
Ishvarakrishna, ascribes bondage to
the process of evolution, stemming
from the confusion between purusha
(conscious spirit) and prakrti (primal
matter). According to Samkhya,
these two first principles are always
separate from one another, but humans
can confuse them. The Yoga school,
traditionally paired with the Samkhya,
used this model as well. The philosopher
Ramanuja, founder of the Vishishthadvaita
Vedanta school, proposes an evolution-
ary scheme similar to the Samkhya
model, although instead of Samkhya’s
dualism, all things evolve from a single
source, Brahman.
The only major Hindu philosophical
school without a causal chain is Advaita
Vedanta. All of the other schools explain
the relationship between the Ultimate
Reality (in most cases, Brahman) and
the perceivable world with the doctrine
of parinamavada. This philosophical
perspective accepts the reality of the
world as it is perceived and also assumesCauvery
that the changes in the material world
involve the genuine transformation
(parinama) of one thing into another,
which can be explained by cause and
effect. The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality lies behind all things,
which are merely differing forms of that
reality. For the Advaitins, this single real-
ity is the formless, unqualified
Brahman. Advaitins explain the appear-
ance of difference and diversity in the
everyday world as an illusory rather
than a genuine transformation of
Brahman, a philosophical outlook
known as vivartavada. This illusory
transformation is caused by a quality of
the human mind, which leads to the
mental superimposition (adhyasa) of a
mistaken understanding in place of the
real one. For the Advaitins, as for all of
the other schools, the ultimate problem
is still avidya, or mistaken understand-
ing, which must be replaced by correct
understanding. Whereas all of the other
schools give some importance to
actions, the Advaitins believe that avidya
is the sole cause and its removal the sole
solution. For further information see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Causal Models
In Indian philosophy, there are three
different models describing the relation-
ships between cause and effect:
satkaryavada, asatkaryavada, and
anekantavada. The first model,
satkaryavada, assumes that effects pre-
exist in their causes. Effects are thus
transformations (real or apparent) of
these causes. The classic example is the
transformation of milk to curds, butter,
and clarified butter. According to
satkaryavada’s proponents, each of
these effects was already present in the
cause and emerges from it through a
natural transformation of that cause.
The second model, asatkaryavada,
assumes that effects do not preexist
in their causes—they are completely
distinct. In the classic examples for this
model, one creates a clay pot by putting
together the two halves of the pot, or
one weaves a cloth from strands of
thread. According to asatkaryavada’s
proponents, with each of these acts, cer-
tain material and instrumental causes
create an entirely new object.
The third model, anekantavada (“the
view that things are not single”), seeks to
occupy the middle ground between the
other two models. Anekantavada stresses
the importance of one’s perspective and
the way it can color a judgment. In view-
ing the transformation of milk to curds,
butter, and clarified butter, an anekan-
tavada proponent would claim that
these substances were contained in the
causes (supporting the satkaryavada
notion) but that the qualities of these
substances were newly created each
time (supporting the asatkaryavada
notion). Thus causes and effects are
simultaneously both the same and dif-
ferent, depending on the way one looks
at them.
All of these philosophical schools
believe that if one understands the
causal process correctly and can manip-
ulate it through one’s conscious actions,
it is possible to gain final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Each of these causal
models thus has profound implications
on religious life. Satkaryavada believes
that causal relations are strong, but they
may be so strong that humans cannot
affect the causal chain; the asatkaryavada
believes that causal relations are weak,
with the danger that human action is
too unreliable to bring about a desired
effect; anekantavada purports to find a
middle ground but can be construed as
inconsistent or self-contradictory. For
further information see Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.
Cauvery
Southern Indian river rising at the base
of the western ghats in the state of
Karnataka, then flowing east through
the state of Tamil Nadu before entering
[[133]]
Caves, Artificial
The Kailasanatha Temple in the state of Maharashtra is surrounded by artificial caves sculpted into solid rock.
the Bay of Bengal. It is traditionally
considered one of India’s seven sacred
rivers along with the Ganges, Godavari,
Indus, Narmada, Saraswati, and Yamuna.
Important sacred sites (tirthas) on the
Cauvery include Shrirangapatnam
and Tiruchirappalli as well as the
Cauvery Delta in Tamil Nadu’s Tanjore
district, which is filled with temple
towns. Since 1947, when India gained
independence, the rights to the
Cauvery’s water have become a major
dispute between Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka. Farmers in Tamil Nadu have
been demanding a more significant
share of the waters impounded in reser-
voirs in Karnataka.
Caves, Artificial
This was a common architectural form
in the western part of the state of
Maharashtra, particularly in the early
centuries of the common era. The earli-
est form was the chaitya or rock-cut
cave temple, which is specifically associ-
ated with Buddhist architectural sites. A
chaitya typically had a large chamber
sculpted into the side of a hill, usually
[[134]]

with a Buddha image at the far end and
a window above the entrance to admit
more light. These caves were excavated
and sculpted from the top down so that
no scaffolding was necessary. The sides
and central pillars were carved to mimic
wooden construction. Early Hindu
architecture adapted the chaitya form
but eventually moved beyond it to con-
struct free-standing temples. The most
impressive Hindu rock-cut temples are
the caves at Ellora, particularly the
Kailasanatha temple (late 8th c.), dedi-
cated to the god Shiva in his form as the
Lord of Mount Kailas. The Kailasanatha
temple was sculpted out of solid rock
but carved to look as if it were built of
masonry. This temple marked the
height of the artificial cave as an archi-
tectural type, although the temples at
Elephanta were done later. After this
period, the emphasis tended to be on
free-standing temples.
Cekkilar
(12th c. C.E.) Author of the Periya
Puranam, a hagiographical account of
the sixty-three Nayanars. The NayanarsChaitanya
were a group of sixty-three Shaiva poet-
saints who lived in southern India
between the seventh and ninth cen-
turies. Along with their Vaishnava coun-
terparts, the Alvars, the Nayanars
spearheaded the revitalization of Hindu
religion in opposition to the Buddhists
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the
Alvars stressed passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god—Shiva for
the Nayanars, Vishnu for the Alvars—
and conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
According to tradition, Cekkilar was a
minister at the court of the Chola
dynasty’s
king
Kullottunga
II
(r. 1130–1150 C.E.). Cekkilar was dis-
tressed by the king’s admiration for a
Jain epic poem and composed his own
text to distract the king. His text portrays
the Nayanars as models of devotion to
Shiva, although they are sometimes
extreme in their actions. Yet in every
case, the love between devotee (bhakta)
and deity manifests itself in the circum-
stances of everyday life, leading the
saints to final liberation.
Celibacy
In traditional Indian culture, celibacy
was widely seen not only as a sign of
sanctity but also as a source of power.
On one hand, since sexual desire is often
the symbol for all types of desire, renun-
ciation of sexual activity is thus a sign for
the renunciation of the world in general.
On a more literal level, retention of
semen through celibacy is believed to
prevent the loss of a man’s vital energy.
In traditional Indian physiology, semen
is believed to be distilled from blood
and is therefore the concentrated
essence of a man’s vitality. Although
semen can and must be expended for
procreation, all other losses should be
carefully weighed. Thus there are strong
taboos on masturbation. This vital energy,
stored and conserved through celibacy,
can then be used for spiritual advance-
ment. The paradigm for the celibate
ascetic is the god Shiva, one of whose
symbols is the linga, a pillar-shaped
image with clear phallic associations.
Shiva is the model husband and the
consummate ascetic. The linga repre-
sents his stored celibate energy, as the
product of his tapas (ascetic practices).
In the same way, celibacy is a way for
human men to conserve their vital ener-
gies, whether one is a lifetime celibate
(naisthika), a student (brahmacharin),
or—as in many cases—a married man
who has already had children.
Chaitanya
(1486–1533 C.E.) Bengali saint, devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna, and the
founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava reli-
gious community. Chaitanya was such a
pivotal figure that there are many tradi-
tional sources for his life, although their
hagiographic character makes them his-
torically unreliable. According to one of
these traditions, Chaitanya embodied
Krishna himself. Krishna became
Chaitanya to experience the longing of
Radha, his beloved consort whom
Chaitanya imagined himself to be. Thus,
for his followers Chaitanya was con-
ceived as Krishna and Radha in the
same body.
Chaitanya was born in the town of
Navadvip in the state of West Bengal
and given the name Vishvambar.
Traditional sources portray the young
man as a gifted teacher but with no
inclination toward Krishna. In 1508 he
went to Gaya, a sacred site (tirtha) asso-
ciated with rites for the dead, to perform
rites for his dead father. In Gaya,
Vishvambar met his teacher, Ishvara
Puri, and something profound hap-
pened there, for he returned to
Navadvip a passionate devotee of
Krishna. On his return, Vishvambar
began to hold the public kirtan (devo-
tional chanting) that has become the
hallmark of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
school. Devotees sang and danced in the
streets and wept uncontrollably.
Through this ecstatic emotional wor-
ship, they sought to regain the devotional
atmosphere associated with the gopis,
Krishna’s cowherd women, and thus
[[135]]
Chaitanya-Charitramrta
share in the gopis’ intimate relationship
with Krishna.
In 1510 Vishvambar formally became
an ascetic, taking the name Krishna
Chaitanya, and for the rest of his life
propagated the worship of Krishna. For
much of that time, he resided in the
sacred city of Puri. This was reportedly
in deference to his mother, since she felt
that Krishna’s childhood home,
Brindavan, was too far away. Despite his
mother’s wishes, Chaitanya did take sev-
eral lengthy trips: a two-year tour of the
holy places in southern India between
[[1510]]
 and 1512, and in 1514, a trip to
Brindavan, in which Chaitanya had fre-
quent mystical experiences. After his
return to Puri, he met the brothers Rupa
and Sanatana Goswami. Chaitanya
directed them to settle in Brindavan and
re-establish the holy sites associated
with Krishna’s life. Driven by Chaitanya’s
charisma and ecstatic devotion, Rupa,
Sanatana, and their nephew Jiva
Goswami became pivotal figures in the
development of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
school. While Chaitanya was absorbed
in his devotion to Krishna until his
death, Rupa, Santana, and Jiva Goswami
gave this devotion a systematic organi-
zation. For further information see
Sushil Kumar De, Early History of the
Vaishnava Faith and Movement in
Bengal,
[[1961]]
;
and
Janardana
Chakravarti, Bengal Vaishnavism and Sri
Chaitanya, 1975.
Chaitanya-Charitramrta
(“nectar of Chaitanya’s deeds”) A name
shared by at least three separate texts, all
devoted to recounting the life of the
Bengali saint Chaitanya (1486–1533).
The earliest was written by Murari
Gupta, an associate of Chaitanya. Most
of this text focuses on Chaitanya’s early
life up to his southern Indian pilgrimage
ending in 1513, but it also briefly men-
tions his pilgrimage to the town of
Brindavan in 1514 and his final return
to the sacred city of Puri, in which he
lived until his death. The second
account was written nine years after
[[136]]

Chaitanya’s death by Kavikarnapura,
who freely acknowledged his debt to
Murari Gupta. The final account was
written by Krishnadas Kaviraj about
ninety years after Chaitanya’s death.
Kaviraj’s account focuses mainly on
Chaitanya’s later life, particularly his
time in Brindavan. This last version is
marked by the philosophical influ-
ence of Chaitanya’s most important
disciples, the Goswamis (Rupa Goswami,
Sanatana Goswami, and Jiva Goswami),
whose ideas were a major influence
in shaping the Gaudiya Vaishnava
religious community. None of these
texts gives an “objective” biography;
the works are hagiographies written
by passionate devotees (bhakta). See
also philosophy.
Chaitra
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Chaitra is the month in
which the lunar year both begins (dur-
ing the two weeks of the bright or wax-
ing, half of the moon) and ends (during
the two weeks of the dark, or waning,
half of the moon, which precedes the
bright half). Thus, the waning half of
Chaitra ends one lunar year, while the
waxing half that follows it begins the
next lunar year. This month usually falls
within March and April. This is one of
the months of spring, and in northern
India the weather is warm and pleasant
at this time. The major festivals in
Chaitra are Papamochani Ekadashi, the
spring Navaratri, Ram Navami,
Kamada Ekadashi, Hanuman Jayanti,
and in Tamil Nadu, the Chittirai festival.
Chaitya
(“place of worship”) A rock-cut cave
temple. This architectural form is closely
associated with Indian Buddhism but
was also used in early Hindu temple
architecture. The earliest chaityas were
simple caves, but these grew more elab-
orate as the form developed. In its later
stages, the builders would not only cutChakra
out the side of the hill to make a cave;
they would also sculpt pillars and
other architectural details that
mimicked free-standing construction.
Another characteristic architectural
feature was a ceiling carved into the
shape of an arch. The true arch, built
from the bottom up and used in
Roman architecture, was not used in
ancient India. A third common feature
was a large window opening over the
doorway to let in additional light.
During the construction, the builders
began removing stone at the top of the
structure and worked their way down;
this eliminated the need for any scaf-
folding during the building process,
but it also meant that the builders had
to work carefully to avoid mistakes.
This construction method creates
structures considered gigantic sculp-
tures rather than buildings. The earliest
examples are Buddhist caves carved
into the side of the western ghats in
Maharashtra. The form was later used
to create Hindu temples, specifically
at Ellora (in which the oldest caves
are Buddhist) and on the island
of Elephanta.
Chakora
The red partridge (Perdrix rufa).
According to popular belief, the chakora
bird eats nothing but moonbeams. It is
thus happy and content during the
night but tormented by hunger during
the day. In court poetry the chakora bird
often symbolized a cultured and dis-
criminating person who appreciates the
finer things in life. In bhakti (devotion-
al) poetry the chakora is often a symbol
for a devotee (bhakta), since the chakora
bird is said to be in love with the moon.
Thus it is joyful when the moon is out
but pines for it during the day, just as a
devotee is blissful in the deity’s pres-
ence and in its absence is consumed
with longing.
Chakra
(“wheel”) In Hindu iconography the
chakra is the discus-weapon carried by
several of the Hindu deities. It is often
associated with the god Vishnu and is
one of the four objects he invariably
carries, along with the club (gada), lotus
(padma), and conch shell (shankha).
The discus was an actual weapon in the
Indian military arsenal, and its sharp
edges made it fearsome in close com-
bat. Vishnu’s discus (named Sudarshana)
is even more fearsome in its power.
According to tradition it was fashioned
by the divine craftsman, Vishvakarma,
from pieces trimmed off of the sun;
thus it carries the power of the sun’s
blazing energy. The discus is also carried
by certain powerful forms of the
Goddess. In her charter myth, she was
formed from the collected radiance of
all the gods and received duplicates of
all their weapons.
In the esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, a chakra is a psychic
center in the subtle body. The subtle
body is an alternate physiological sys-
tem that corresponds to the material
body but is believed to reside on a dif-
ferent plane of existence. The subtle
body is visualized as a set of chakras,
or psychic centers, that are arranged
in a column from the base of the spine
to the top of the head and connected
by three vertical channels. Each
chakra is pictured as a multipetaled
lotus flower. All tantric traditions
speak of six chakras: muladhara, svad-
hishthana, manipura, anahata, vishud-
dha, and ajna; some traditions name
additional ones. Each of these chakras
has important symbolic associations—
with a different human physiological
capacity, subtle element (tanmatra),
and with differing seed syllables (bijak-
shara) formed from the letters of the
Sanskrit alphabet, together encompass-
ing all sacred sounds. For further infor-
mation see Philip S. Rawson, The Art of
Tantra, 1973.
[[137]]
Chakravyuha
A shoemaker in Agra. Shoemaking and leather tanning are traditional occupations of the Chamar social group.
Chakravyuha
(“circular phalanx”) A circular military
formation described in the Mahabharata,
one of the two great Hindu epics (along
with the Ramayana). The Chakravyuha
was widely believed to be unconquer-
able because each person in the forma-
tion was protected by those behind
him. During a battle in the Mahabharata
war, Abhimanyu becomes trapped in
the chakravyuha by his enemy. Because
his father, Arjuna, is the only person
who knows how to get out, Abhimanyu
is killed.
Chalukya Dynasty
(7th–8th c. C.E.) Central Indian dynasty
whose capital was at Badami, in
the Deccan plateau in modern
Karnataka. The greatest Chalukya ruler
was Pulakeshin II, who defeated the
northern Indian emperor Harsha, stop-
ping his southern advance. He also
killed the Pallava dynasty ruler
Mahendravarman, setting off a series of
wars between the Chalukyas and the
Pallavas in which each dynasty was able
to defeat the other in battle, but neither
was strong enough to retain control of
the other’s empire. Aside from the
[[138]]

Chalukya dynasty based at Badami,
there were two other smaller dynasties
by the same name, both of which flour-
ished between the tenth and thirteenth
centuries. One of these later dynasties
was in the Gujarat region, and the other
was in the Karnataka region.
Chamar
In traditional northern Indian society,
the chamars were a jati (“birth”) whose
hereditary occupation was tanning
leather and making shoes. The jatis
were subgroups of traditional Indian
society whose social status was deter-
mined by their hereditary occupation.
The chamars were traditionally consid-
ered among the lowest of the untouch-
ables since their work brought them in
continual contact with dead animals
and their skins, which are considered
extremely impure. The most famous
chamar is the poet-saint Ravidas, whose
poetry focuses on the difference
between worldly status and devotion.
Champaran
Region in the northern part of the state
of Bihar, between the Gandaki RiverChanda
and the border of Nepal. Now it is com-
posed of two provinces, eastern
Champaran and western Champaran.
The Champaran region is famous as the
place where Mohandas K. Gandhi engi-
neered the first successful satyagraha
(nonviolent resistance campaign)
against British rule. At the time, the
province was largely agricultural, as it
remains today, and most of the inhabi-
tants were very poor. The farmers had
traditionally designated a portion of
their land for growing indigo to give to
the landlords as rent. This arrangement
was disrupted by the invention of a
much cheaper synthetic indigo. The
landlords responded by ordering the
tenants to stop growing indigo but pro-
ceeded to raise the rent on their land,
based on the traditional agreement that
allowed them to do so if a tenant grew
no indigo. The trouble began in 1912,
but Gandhi did not arrive until 1917.
After a campaign lasting nearly a year,
the tenants won concessions from the
landlords guaranteeing no further rent
increases and a 25 percent rebate on the
previous increases. For further informa-
tion see Mohandas K. Gandhi, An
Autobiography, 1993; a more readable,
though highly partial, account can be
found in Louis Fischer, Gandhi, 1954.
Chamunda
Presiding deity of the Chamunda Devi
shrine on the banks of the Bana Ganga
in the state of Himachal Pradesh, and
one of the nine goddesses whose shrines
are scattered through the Shiwalik Hills.
Although each of these goddesses has a
separate identity, they are all ultimately
seen as differing manifestations of a sin-
gle Goddess. Chamunda’s charter myth
is drawn from events in the
Devimahatmya, a Sanskrit text that
describes the Goddess’s several different
forms and is the earliest and most
important mythic source for the cult of
the Goddess. The Devimahatmya’s sev-
enth book tells how the goddess
Ambika’s anger takes material form as
the terrifying goddess Kali, who
advances into battle against the demon
generals Chanda and Munda, whom
she eventually beheads. Since the shrine
on the Bana Ganga marks the place
where both Chanda and Munda were
destroyed, the goddess is worshiped
here as Chamunda.
The name Chamunda designates a
fierce and dangerous goddess who has
often been identified with the goddess
Kali. In the poet Bhavabhuti’s eighth-
century drama Malatimadhava , the
heroine, Malati, is kidnapped by devo-
tees (bhakta) of the goddess Chamunda
to be offered as a human sacrifice to
her. The events in the drama reflect the
ambivalence with which such powerful
goddesses—and their devotees—have
been seen. For further information see
David R. Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986;
and Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993.
Chanakya
According to tradition, the chief minis-
ter of the founder of the Maurya
dynasty,
Chandragupta
Maurya
(r. 321–297 B.C.E.). As the king’s counsel,
Chanakya became famous for his skill
in statecraft, and is believed to have
been instrumental in establishing the
dynasty. Under the name Kautilya,
Chanakya is also celebrated as
the author of the Arthashastra , the
classic Indian treatise on the strategies
and mechanics of ruthlessly efficient
central government.
Chanda
A demon general killed by the Goddess
in the Devimahatmya, the Sanskrit text
that is the earliest and most important
mythic source for the cult of the
Goddess. This text describes the
Goddess in several different manifesta-
tions. The seventh book tells how the
goddess Ambika’s anger takes form as
the terrifying goddess Kali. Kali attacks
the demon armies commanded by
Chanda and his companion Munda,
and after destroying the armies she
[[139]]
Chandas
beheads the two generals. As a memorial
of this mythic deed, one of the names
under which the Goddess is worshiped
is Chamunda, as the slayer of Chanda
and Munda.
Chandas
One of the six Vedangas. These were the
auxiliary branches of knowledge intended
to facilitate the use of the Vedas, the
oldest Hindu religious texts. Chandas
was concerned with the study of metri-
cal forms and verse, which were central
to the composition of the Vedas. One
indication of the importance of meter is
that in many sources (such as in Panini’s
grammar, the Ashtadhyayi) the word
chandas is used to designate the Vedas
themselves. Aside from chandas, the
other Vedangas are shiksha (correct pro-
nunciation), vyakarana (Sanskrit gram-
mar), kalpa (ritual instructions),
nirukta (etymology), and jyotisha (aus-
picious times for sacrifices).
Chandella Dynasty
(10th–14th c. C.E.) Northern Indian
dynasty that in its heyday controlled
much of the Ganges River valley and
northern Madhya Pradesh. The
Chandellas are famous for the magnifi-
cent temples that they built in the village
of Khajuraho, largely between the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. These
temples have survived to the present,
perhaps due to their remote and inac-
cessible location. They are excellent
examples of the developed form of the
Nagara architectural style and are
world-famous for their astounding dis-
play of erotic sculptures.
Chandi
(“fierce”) Epithet used for the fierce and
powerful goddesses Durga and Kali. A
variant form of the name Chandi is
Chandika, and under this name Chandi
is identified as one of the Navadurgas,
the “nine [forms of the goddess] Durga”
worshiped during the nine nights of the
Navaratri festival. Chandika is the goddess
[[140]]

worshiped on the festival’s ninth and
final night and is thus the most powerful
of these divine forms.
Chandidas
(15th c. C.E.) Bengali poet and devotee
(bhakta) of the god Krishna. In his
poems Chandidas uses the conventions
of Sanskrit love poetry to express devo-
tion to Krishna, most often through the
figure of Radha as Krishna’s favored
devotee and lover. His poems are still
recited in Bengal and according to tradi-
tion were admired by Chaitanya, the
Bengali devotee who was the founder of
the Gaudiya Vaishnava religious com-
munity. Despite his poetry’s continuing
acclaim, little is known about the life of
Chandidas himself. This same name was
used by a Bengali poet of the Sahajiya
sect, who wrote several centuries later
than the original Chandidas and whose
poetry is clearly distinguished by doctri-
nal differences. For selections from the
poetry of Chandidas, see Edward C.
Dimock Jr. and Denise Levertov (trans.),
In Praise of Krishna, 1981.
Chandika
A variant of the name Chandi, which
designates a powerful and terrifying
form of the Goddess. Chandika is one of
the Navadurgas, the “nine [forms of the
goddess] Durga” worshiped during the
nine nights of the Navaratri festival.
Chandika is the goddess worshiped
on the festival’s ninth and final night
and is thus the most powerful of these
divine forms.
Chandiprakasha
(“effulgence of Chandi”) Name given to
the spear that is the symbolic weapon of
the Atala akhara, a particular group
within the Naga class of Dashanami
Sanyasis. The Dashanami Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into different akharas, or reg-
iments, on the model of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the Nagas’ primary occupation was asChandragupta Maurya
mercenary soldiers, although they also
had substantial trading interests. These
functions have largely disappeared in
contemporary times. All of the akharas
have certain symbols that signify
their organizational identity, and the
Atala akhara is represented by this
particular spear.
Chandogya Upanishad
Along with the Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad, one of the two earliest
upanishads, the religious texts that form
the most recent stratum of the Vedas.
Internal textual factors indicate that
the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is the
older of the two, and since large sections
of both texts are the same, the
Chandogya Upanishad is thought to
be dependent on the Brhadaranyaka.
Both texts are also much larger than the
other upanishads and much less
organized, rambling from topic to topic
without an apparent focus. Both
are written in prose rather than poetry,
with the text itself often presented as
a dialogue between various speakers.
Their profoundly speculative discus-
sions about the nature of the
universe became important sources for
the later upanishads.
Chandra Gupta I
(r. 320–35 C.E.) Founder of the Gupta
dynasty, which like the Maurya dynasty
had its capital in Pataliputra, identified
with the modern city of Patna in the
state of Bihar. The Gupta capital was
later moved to Allahabad. At the height
of the dynasty, under Chandra Gupta II
(r. 376–415), the Guptas controlled all of
northern India and modern Pakistan, as
well as the Coromandel Coast all the
way to modern Madras. The Gupta
dynasty flourished between about 350
and 550 C.E., and its reign is associated
with the development of Indian culture
and a revival of Hinduism in northern
India. Both were accomplished through
the patronage of the Gupta kings, who
are remembered both as patrons of high
Coins from the Gupta dynasty.
culture and ardent devotees (bhakta)
of Shiva.
Chandra Gupta II
(r. 376–415 C.E.) Third in the line of great
monarchs in the Gupta dynasty, after
his father, Samudra Gupta, and his
grandfather, Chandra Gupta I. The
Gupta dynasty reached its territorial
peak under Chandra Gupta II. During
his reign the Shaka kingdom of the
Malwa region was finally conquered,
after which the Guptas controlled by
conquest or tribute all of northern India
and modern Pakistan, as well as the
Coromandel Coast all the way to mod-
ern Madras. The Gupta dynasty flour-
ished between about 350 and 550 C.E.,
and its reign is associated with the
development of Indian culture and a
revival of Hinduism in northern India.
Both were accomplished through the
patronage of the Gupta kings, who are
remembered both as patrons of high
culture and ardent devotees (bhakta) of
Shiva. This is especially true of Chandra
Gupta II, since one of the major figures
associated with his court is Kalidasa,
considered the greatest of the Sanskrit
poets. See also Shaka era.
Chandragupta Maurya
(r. 321–297 B.C.E.) The founder of the
Maurya
dynasty.
The
young
Chandragupta began his empire by
[[141]]
Chandramati
overthrowing the last member of the
Nanda dynasty and occupying the capi-
tal in Pataliputra, identified with the
modern city of Patna in the state of
Bihar. From there he took control of the
Ganges River basin, moved south into
the region of the Narmada River, and
then turned his attention to northwest-
ern India, taking advantage of the power
vacuum left by the recent incursion of
Alexander the Great. In 303 B.C.E. he
defeated Alexander’s general Seleucus
Nicator in battle, then agreed to a treaty
in which he received large parts of mod-
ern Afghanistan. Despite the battle, rela-
tions seem to have been friendly
between the two, for Seleucus Nicator
sent an ambassador to Pataliputra,
Megasthenes, who lived there for many
years. Chandragupta was reportedly
advised by a brilliant brahmin minister,
variously called Kautilya or Chanakya,
who is considered the author of the
Arthashastra . According to legend,
Chandragupta renounced his throne to
become a Jain monk and eventually died
through ritual starvation.
Chandramati
In Hindu mythology, the long-suffering
wife of King Harishchandra. Harish-
chandra is famous for his truthfulness
and integrity; in modern Hindu culture
he is also the paradigm for a person
who patiently endures undeserved suf-
fering. Harishchandra’s suffering grows
out of the competition between the
sages Vasishtha and Vishvamitra. As his
family priest, Vasishtha praises Harish-
chandra’s virtue. Vishvamitra is deter-
mined to prove Vasishtha wrong and
subjects Harishchandra to a series of
trials in which he loses his kingdom, his
possessions, and has to sell himself and
his family into slavery. Through all of
the trials he and Chandramati have to
suffer, Harishchandra retains his integrity.
After enduring many hardships, includ-
ing the death of their only son, they are
eventually restored to their original
happy state, including the resuscitation
of their son.

Chandrayana
(“moon’s path”) Penitential rite
(prayashchitta) lasting for one lunar
month in which the penitent’s food con-
sumption mirrors the monthly course of
the moon. A person observing this rite
begins by eating fourteen mouthfuls of
food on the first day of the waning
moon, then one less mouthful on each
successive day until the new moon day,
when a complete fast (upavasa) is
observed. On each successive day dur-
ing the waxing moon, the penitent eats
one more mouthful, finishing at fifteen
on the day of the full moon. This is a
fairly severe penance, given the scant
amount of food allowed in the middle of
the month. In the dharma literature,
this penance was prescribed as an
atonement for certain sorts of sexual
misconduct: sexual intercourse with a
woman belonging to the same gotra
(mythic lineage), marrying a woman
belonging to one’s maternal grandfa-
ther’s gotra, or marrying the daughter of
one’s maternal uncle or paternal aunt.
Charaka
(1st–2nd c. C.E.?) The attributed author
of the Charaka Samhita, which along
with the slightly later Sushruta
Samhita, is one of the two major
sources for ayurveda, a traditional
school of Indian medicine. According to
tradition, Charaka was the physician at
the royal court in the city of Takshashila,
in modern Pakistan.
Charaka Samhita
Along with the later Sushruta Samhita,
one of the two major sources for the tra-
ditional Indian medical school known as
ayurveda. Although its authorship is
attributed to Charaka, it is more likely a
compendium from earlier sources,
given its reference to several different
medical systems and approaches. The
underlying medical framework of
ayurveda is the theory of the three bodily
humors—vata (wind), pitta (bile), and
kapha (phlegm). Although everyone hasCharvaka
all three humors, each of these is com-
posed of different elements whose vary-
ing proportions are used to explain
individual body types, metabolic dispo-
sitions, and personalities. Diseases
result from an imbalance of these
humors—caused by one’s environment
or personal habits—whereas equilibri-
um is the state of health. The Charaka
Samhita has been edited and translated
into various languages and has served as
a source for secondary studies, such as
Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Science
and Society in Ancient India, 1977.
Charanadas
(“slave of [God’s] feet”; 1733–1782 C.E.)
Founder of the Charanadasis, an ascetic
religious community. Charanadas was
born in the town of Dehra in the prince-
ly state of Alwar (in the modern state of
Rajasthan). The Charanadasis are also
known as the Shuka Sampraday because,
according to tradition, Charanadas
received initiation from the puranic
sage Shuka. Charanadas formed his
community in protest against the cor-
ruption and worldliness of the Pushti
Marg, the religious community founded
by Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 C.E.),
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Krishna. Like the Pushti
Marg, the Charanadasis are Vaishnavas,
but their patron deity is not Krishna
alone but also his consort, Radha.
Charanadas countered the Pushti Marg
by stressing upright and appropriate
behavior and an insistence on learning.
His disciples translated and wrote com-
mentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the
Bhagavata Purana, both important
Vaishnava texts.
devotees (bhakta) of the god Krishna.
Like the Pushti Marg, the Charanadasis
are Vaishnavas, but their patron deity is
not Krishna alone, but also his consort,
Radha. The Charanadasis have stressed
both learning and an upright way of
life. Their main center is in Delhi, as is
the samadhi shrine of Charanadas,
their founder.
Charanamrta
(“foot nectar”) Literally, the water (or
other liquid) in which the feet of one’s
guru or images of a deity are bathed.
The disciple or devotee (bhakta) con-
sumes it as a sign of subordinate status
and as a way to receive grace and bless-
ings. By extension, the word can refer to
any liquid for devotees to consume as a
symbol of the deity’s grace, whether or
not it has been used for bathing (snana).
Charas
Name for hashish. This is usually mixed
with tobacco and smoked in a straight
pipe called a chillum. Smoking hashish
is typical in certain segments of the
ascetic community. For many ascetics,
smoking is a social activity and a rite of
hospitality as well as a religious act that
emulates the god Shiva, whose love for
the drug is well known. In their travels
many ascetics process the marijuana
that grows wild throughout the
Himalayas into hashish to use and sell.
Drug use is forbidden for most people,
but among ascetics—who are deliber-
ately marginal members of society—it is
a fairly common and tolerated behavior.
Charity
See dana.
Charanadasi
Vaishnava ascetic sect founded by the
reformer-saint Charanadas (1733–1782
C.E.). Charanadas formed his own com-
munity as a protest against the corrup-
tion of the Pushti Marg, the religious
community founded by Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531 C.E.) whose members are
Charvaka
One of the traditional names given to
the materialist philosophical school.
Its primary assertion was that a person
is identical to his or her physical body
and is destroyed with the body’s
demise. See materialist.
[[143]]
Chataka
Vishnu sleeping on a serpent couch. According to Hindu tradition, during the four months that Vishnu
sleeps, the world is denied his protective powers and the Chaturmas Vrat is observed during this time.
Chataka
In Sanskrit poetry and literature, the
name for the cuckoo bird, usually
invoked as a symbol of longing.
Chatterjee, Bankim Chandra
(1838–1894) Bengali writer and Indian
nationalist who was one of the major
figures in the nineteenth-century
revival of Bengali literature and in
making the area a hotbed of opposition
to British rule. As a young man,
Chatterjee perceived how the influence
of English language and culture was
superseding that of Indian culture
among educated Indians. He sought to
reverse this through his writing and
political activism by encouraging
Indian intellectuals to rediscover their
classical culture. He became a seminal
figure in both literature and politics,
paving the way for the poet Rabin-
dranath Tagore and political activists
Aurobindo Ghose and Subhash Chandra
Bose. Chatterjee’s most famous novel,
Anandamath , focused on the late
eighteenth-century Sanyasi Rebellion,
[[144]]

in which bands of militant ascetics,
both Hindu and Muslim, fought with
the British East India Company for
control of Bengal. Although historical
inquiry attributes this conflict to social
and economic tensions in contempo-
rary Bengal, Chatterjee portrays it alle-
gorically as a struggle by Mother India’s
loyal children to expel the British
invaders. Chatterjee also wrote the
words to “Vande Mataram” (“Homage to
Mother [India]”), a patriotic song often
described as the unofficial Indian
national anthem.
Chatti
A pilgrim shelter, particularly in the
Himalayas. The word chatti is a variant
form of the word for “umbrella” and was
used because these shelters were often
simply roofs supported by pillars, to
keep the pilgrims dry in case of rain. Up
until the middle of the twentieth
century, many Himalayan pilgrims still
traveled on foot and used a network of
chattis along the pilgrimage routes.
These chattis were eight to twelve milesChaturmas Vrat
apart, an easy day’s walk for younger pil-
grims, yet manageable for the elderly.
Each chatti was maintained by a nearby
family, which would sell the pilgrims
wood and food grains and provide them
with cooking utensils. This arrangement
brought income to mountain families
during the pilgrimage season and freed
pilgrims to carry only their personal
belongings. The advent of paved roads
and bus transportation has largely ren-
dered this network obsolete, although it
survives in certain place names, such as
Janaki Chatti and Hanuman Chatti.
Chatuh-Sampradayi Nagas
Collective name for four groups (sam-
praday) of militant (Naga) ascetics who
are all devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu. They all trace their spiritual lin-
eage to a different Vaishnava religious
community, each of which is connected
with a major Vaishnava figure. By far the
most populous and powerful of these
groups is the Shri sampraday of the
Ramanandi ascetics, which traces its
descent through the poet-saint
Ramananda to the southern Indian
philosopher Ramanuja, whom they
claim as Ramananda’s guru. The Sanaka
sampraday of the Nimbarki ascetics
traces its spiritual lineage to the philoso-
pher Nimbarka. The Rudra sampraday
of the Vishnuswami ascetics traces its
lineage through the philosopher
Vallabhacharya to an earlier figure,
Vishnuswami. Finally, the Brahma sam-
praday of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
ascetics traces its spiritual line through
the Bengali saint Chaitanya to the
southern Indian philosopher Madhva.
Each of these sampradays is differentiated
not only by its founder but also by its
patron deity or deities. The Ramanandis
worship the god Rama, whereas the
others worship the god Krishna and, to
different extents, his consort, Radha.
Scholars doubt that these groups
were ever actually connected to the peo-
ple whom they claim as their founders.
The distinctions among the sampradays
appear to be largely academic. Given
that the overwhelming majority of these
ascetics are Ramanandis, the others
seem important only for representing
the other great Vaishnava religious fig-
ures. The distinctions between groups
are only significant during the bathing
(snana) festival known as the Kumbha
Mela, at which they determine the order
of certain groups in the bathing proces-
sions. For more information see Peter
van der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988.
Chaturbhujdas
(late 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
named as members of the community
and as associates of either its founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor,
Vitthalnath. Chaturbhujdas is claimed
as an associate of Vitthalnath—an idea
supported by references in his poetry—
and is also said to be the son of
Kumbhadas, one of the earlier ash-
tachap poets. In his poetry Chatur-
bhujdas presents himself as a companion
to Krishna and his consort, Radha, giv-
ing latter-day devotees a picture of their
daily routine.
Chaturmas Vrat
A period of time spanning four lunar
months, beginning on the festival of
Devshayani Ekadashi (June–July) and
ending on the festival of Devotthayan
Ekadashi (October–November). The
four months in between these festivals
are considered ritually inauspicious,
since during that time the god Vishnu is
considered to be sleeping, and the pro-
tective power in the universe is less
attentive. Thus people generally do not
perform auspicious life cycle rites such
as weddings during this period. This
time also coincides with the coming of
the monsoon, which is essential for
[[145]]
Chau
helping crops to grow but also brings
danger from waterborne infections and
venomous snakes. Chaturmas Vrat’s
inauspicious qualities and the difficulty
of travel caused by the monsoon make
this a time when wandering ascetics
should stay in one place. Religious wor-
ship during this period tends to stress
rites of protection, to shield one from
these ritual and physical dangers. See
also inauspiciousness.
Chau
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are Bhara-
tanatyam, Kathak, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Different
forms of Chau are found in the border
areas shared by the states of Orissa,
Bihar, and West Bengal. In all three
regions, the dancers wear masks (chau),
making this type different from other
classical dance forms. The expressions
on the masks set a mood and conceal
the dancers’ faces. Consequently, Chau
performers use their bodies and ges-
tures to develop the moods established
by their masks. The prevailing themes in
Chau dance are drawn from the mythi-
cal adventures of gods and heroes, par-
ticularly the mythology of the god Shiva.
For further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Chaupai
(“four-footed”) Poetic form in northern
Indian poetry. As its name suggests, the
chaupai is made up of four lines. The
rhyme scheme is aabb, which has led
some to consider it a compound of two
two-line segments. Based on the dis-
tinction between “heavy” and “light”
syllables, each line contains sixteen
metric beats arranged in a pattern of
[[6]]
 + 4 + 4 + 2. A heavy syllable contains a
long vowel or a consonant cluster and is
counted as two metric beats; all other
syllables are light and count as one beat.
The chaupai is one of the most impor-
tant meters in medieval Hindi literature,
[[146]]

particularly for longer narrative works,
and it is a significant meter in bhakti
(devotional) poetry. Its most famous
use appears in the Ramcharitmanas,
the Ramayana retold by the poet-
saint Tulsidas.
Chaurasi Vaishnavan Ki Varta
(“account of eighty-four Vaishnavas”)
Sectarian hagiography supposedly com-
posed by Gokulnath, the third guru of
the Pushti Marg, a religious community
of Krishna devotees (bhakta) founded
by the philosopher Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531). It is more likely that the
text was written by Gokulnath’s disciple
Hariray, who also wrote a commentary
on the work. The text describes the lives
of eighty-four paradigmatic Vaishnavas,
all of whom were allegedly associated
with the sect’s first two gurus,
Vallabhacharya and Vitthalnath. The
text’s primary purpose is to illustrate
the importance of the Pushti Marg,
particularly the importance of the
Pushti Marg’s leaders on these eighty-
four religious figures. This makes it an
interesting sectarian work, but it is not
historically reliable.
Chauri
A small whisk used to brush off flies and
insects. The name is derived from the
word for the long tail hairs of a yak
(chamara), from which it was originally
made. In ancient India the chauri was
an emblem of royalty, and thus it is also
often seen in statues of religious figures
such as the Didarganj Yakshi.
Chayagrahi
(“shadow grabber”) A demoness in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. Chayagrahi lives in the
ocean and catches birds flying overhead
by grasping their shadows in the water
and pulling the helpless creatures down
to her waiting jaws. This method brings
her a steady food supply, but her big
mistake is trying to capture the monkey-
god, Hanuman, in this way. HanumanChildhood Rites
tries to leap over the ocean to Lanka, the
capital of the demon-king Ravana, to
search for his abducted mistress, Sita.
Chayagrahi grabs him and drags him
down, but he quickly kills her and con-
tinues on his way.
Chera Dynasty
Hindu dynasty that ruled much of the
modern state of Kerala from the second
century B.C.E. to the eighth century C.E.
The Cheras were in continual conflict
with the Pandyas and the Cholas, the
two other dynasties in the deep south,
and were eventually absorbed when the
Cholas gained control in the ninth cen-
tury C.E. See also Chola dynasty.
Chidambaram
(“clothed in thought”) Temple town in
the South Arcot district of the state of
Tamil Nadu, about 125 miles south of
Madras. The town of Chidambaram is
famous for the temple of the same
name, dedicated to the god Shiva in his
form as Nataraja, the lord of the dance.
This temple is also renowned as con-
taining the subtlest of the five elemental
lingas (bhutalingas), the linga made
from space. The temple is built in the
classical Dravida style, with temple tow-
ers (gopurams) rising in each of the car-
dinal directions, and the walls enclosing
the temple between them. The present
temple was erected in the tenth century
C.E., when Chidambaram was the capital
of the Chola dynasty, and is reputed to
be one of the oldest temples in southern
India. As lord of the dance, Nataraja
symbolizes the connection between
religion and the arts. Nataraja is the pri-
mal dancer whose dance encompasses
creation, destruction, and all things in
between. Human dancers imitate him
literally, by performing the dance posi-
tions he codified, and figuratively, by
participating in a creative activity. The
temple’s eastern wall has relief carvings
of the 108 basic dance positions
(karanas) that are still central to classi-
cal Indian dance, particularly to the
Bharatanatyam school, which is the
major dance form in Tamil Nadu.
Nataraja also has a group of hereditary
servants, the Dikshitars. According
to their tradition, the Dikshitars
were members of Shiva’s heavenly host
(gana) and accompanied him down
from heaven when he took up residence
in Chidambaram.
Chidvilasananda
(b. Malti Shetty, 1955) Modern Hindu
teacher and successor to Swami
Muktananda. Muktananda taught a
type of spiritual discipline called siddha
yoga, the “discipline of the adepts,”
which stresses chanting, meditation,
learning, and above all, devotion to
one’s spiritual master. Chidvilasananda
is the current leader and preceptor of
SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham America), the
organization founded by her teacher.
During her childhood, her parents and
other members of her family were
Muktananda’s disciples, and she spent
much of her life in his service, eventual-
ly serving as his translator during his vis-
its to America. She and her brother,
Subhash (who later took the name
Nityananda), were both designated
by Muktananda as his successors, but
her brother left the organization a
few years after Muktananda’s death.
Chidvilasananda continues to travel
between an ashram in Ganeshpuri, near
Bombay, and ashrams and centers
around the world.
Childhood Rites
A collective name for the samskaras of
early childhood, as specified in the
Dharma Shastras, or treatises on reli-
gious duty (dharma). These rites include
the jatakarma (birth ceremonies),
namakarana (naming), nishkramana
(first outing), annaprashana (first feed-
ing), chudakarana (tonsure), and kar-
navedha (piercing the ears). Virtually
all Hindu communities have cere-
monies for ritually marking births and
childhood, but few people perform
[[147]]
Child Marriages
the rites prescribed by the Dharma
Shastras other than brahmins. For
further information see Pandurang
Vaman Kane (trans.), A History of
Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj Bali
Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. The
former is encyclopedic and the latter
more accessible; despite their age they
remain the best sources for traditional
Hindu rites.
Child Marriages
Until well into the twentieth century, in
many families it was traditional to marry
off their children before the onset of
puberty. An early marriage was deemed
particularly important for women, lest
they come of age before they were mar-
ried. Some apologists claim that this
practice evolved as a way to preserve the
honor of Hindu girls against the depre-
dations of Muslim raiders. Though this
may have been partially true, such
depredations were not widespread
enough to evolve such a well-accepted
social practice. Traditional Indian cul-
ture ascribes a much stronger sex drive
to women than to men, and an early
marriage would ensure that they did not
disgrace the family under the influence
of their irresistible urges. These mar-
riages were possible because arranged
marriages were the norm, as they
remain to this day.
Many of the Hindu reformist move-
ments that began in the late nine-
teenth century considered child
marriages one of the “corruptions” of
contemporary Hindu life and lobbied
vigorously to forbid it. Modern Indian
law sets the minimum age for marriage
at sixteen for women and eighteen for
men. These guidelines are often flout-
ed, particularly in rural areas, where
one still hears of marriages between
infants. Although child marriages still
occur, it is a very low-status practice in
modern Indian society, associated with
poverty, backwardness, and a lack of
education. In contrast, men and
women from the upper classes often
do not marry until their late twenties,
[[148]]

after pursuing advanced degrees. See
also marriage ceremonies.
Child Widows
This term refers to girls who had been
married as children and whose hus-
bands (whether older men or boys their
own age) died before the girls reached
puberty and the marriage had been con-
summated. Although the lives of such
child widows varied according to the
status of their families, their lives were
often quite grim, given the traditional
prohibitions on widow remarriage and
the strict behavioral codes mandated for
widows. Reformers in the nineteenth
century, such as Ram Mohan Roy,
championed the drive to promote
societal acceptance of second marriages
for child widows. Due to the sharp
decline in the frequency of child mar-
riages, child widows are extremely
uncommon in modern times. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Chillum
Implement used for smoking. The
chillum is a graduated cylinder of baked
clay that is usually about six inches long,
which is about an inch in diameter at
the top and half that at the bottom. A
pyramid-shaped piece of clay is wedged
point-down in the cylinder to cut down
on the airflow. The top part of the cylin-
der is filled with tobacco, cannabis, or a
mixture of tobacco and hashish (cha-
ras). Smoking is a communal activity in
which the chillum is passed from one
person to another. The bottom of the
chillum is covered with a cloth called a
safai, which is sometimes changed from
person to person and is often dipped in
water to mellow the smoke. Chillum eti-
quette holds that one should not place
one’s mouth directly on the bottom of
the implement, which would render it
impure. Because of this, the chillum is
generally held between one’s fingers,
often in highly elaborate and symbolic
ways. Among many ascetics, smoking
the chillum is a part of daily life, aChintapurni
congregational exercise, and also the act
of emulating the god Shiva, the paradig-
matic ascetic, whose love for drugs is
well known.
Chinmayanand, Swami
(b. Balakrishna Menon, 1915–1993)
Modern Hindu ascetic and teacher.
Chinmayanand became an ascetic under
the influence of Swami Shivananda,
whose articles Chinmayanand had first
read while serving a prison sentence for
his involvement in the independence
movement. For several years he devoted
himself to the study of ancient texts and
became one of the leading authorities of
the Vedas. Part of his legacy is the
Chinmayanand Mission, which carried
the abstract, intellectual, and peaceful
message of the Vedanta philosophical
school to the world. Another part of his
legacy is the Vishva Hindu Parishad, a
modern militant Hindu organization.
He was one of its founding members in
[[1964]]
, and for some years he was the only
ascetic on its governing council.
Chinmoy, Shri
(b. 1931) Modern Hindu teacher and
missionary, who since 1964 has spent
much of his life addressing Western
audiences. His teachings are largely
drawn from classical ideas on yoga and
stress the importance of vegetarianism,
discipline, and service to one’s guru. His
own lifestyle is austere and largely unos-
tentatious, as an example to his follow-
ers. On one hand he is notable for his
attention to the arts—painting, poetry,
and music, particularly the bamboo
flute—and on the other for performing
prodigious feats of strength to demon-
strate the power of mind over matter. He
is based in New York City, although like
many modern Hindu teachers, he trav-
els throughout the world.
Chin (“consciousness”) Mudra
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra) in which the tips of the thumb
and index finger are touching, with the
rest of the fingers extended and the
palm facing the viewer. This is the
hand gesture used to signify explana-
tion or exposition. For this reason it is
also known as the vyakhyana (“teach-
ing”) mudra and the sandarshana
(“expository”) mudra.
Chinnamasta
(“She whose head [masta] has been cut
off [chinna]”) Particular manifestation
of the Goddess, one of the Mahavidyas
(a group of ten powerful goddesses), and
an important deity in the esoteric ritual
tradition known as tantra. The image of
Chinnamasta is one of the most striking
in Hindu iconography: a naked headless
woman often seated on a copulating
couple, holding her head on a platter
and gushing three streams of blood
from her neck—two into the mouths of
Chinnamasta’s attendant deities and
one into the lips of her own severed
head. The story behind this figure is that
Chinnamasta severs her own head to
satisfy the demands of her attendants
because they have not drunk their fill of
blood in battle. This image graphically
portrays the interconnections between
nourishment, sex, and death and the
power of the Goddess over all of
these things. Although Chinnamasta is
powerful, she does not have many
temples dedicated to her. One of the
most important is the temple of the
goddess Chintapurni, identified as a
form of Chinnamasta in the Shiwalik
Hills. For further information see
David R. Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986;
and Kathleen Erndl, Victory to the
Mother, 1993.
Chintapurni
(“She who fulfills one’s wishes”)
Presiding goddess of a temple in a vil-
lage by the same name in the state of
Himachal Pradesh. Chintapurni is one
of the Shiwalik goddesses, a group of
local deities in the Shiwalik Hills who
are all considered to be manifestations
[[149]]
Chir Ghat
Depiction of Krishna having stolen the gopis’ clothes while they were bathing.
This episode from Hindu mythology is believed to have taken place at Chir Ghat.
[[150]]

of a single feminine divine energy.
Chintapurni is considered to be a form
of the goddess Chinnamasta, and this
temple is one of the few dedicated
exclusively to her.tree from which Krishna humbled the
gopis. As pilgrims recall the story, they
tie strips of cloth to the tree to relieve the
gopis’ embarrassment and share in their
feeling of communion.
Chir GhatChitpavan
(“Clothing Ghat”) A bathing (snana)
place on the Yamuna River in the town
of Brindavan, which is identified as the
site for one of the most famous stories
about Krishna. The story tells how the
gopis, Krishna’s female companions,
have taken a religious vow to bathe each
morning in the Yamuna during the cold
months and dedicate the religious merit
from this vow toward gaining Krishna as
their beloved. Although their austerity is
laudable, they are also bathing naked,
which is taboo in Hindu culture. Krishna
spies them in the water and climbs up in
a tree with their clothes. He then refuses
to return the clothes until the mortified
women come out of the water to ask for
them, symbolically demonstrating the
nakedness of the soul before God and
humans’ inability to control the divine.
A gigantic tree still stands by the Chir
Ghat, which is believed to be the sameA brahmin jati that is a subset of the
Maharashtri brahmins, who were them-
selves one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida). Jatis
were endogamous subgroups of tradi-
tional Indian society whose status was
determined by the group’s hereditary
occupation. This sort of differentiation
applied even to brahmins, whose role
has been to serve as priests, scholars,
and teachers. The core region for the
Chitpavan brahmins is in western
Maharashtra, particularly the coastline
and the region around Poona. Although
never very numerous, they were histori-
cally significant both as the chief minis-
ters (peshwas) to the Maratha kings and
also for producing some of the great figures
in the struggle for independence: M. G.
Ranade, G. K. Gokhale, B. G. Tilak, and
V. D. Savarkar. Because this group of
brahmins was largely located on theChokamela
Konkan coastline, they are also known
as Konkanastha.
Chitrakut
City in the Banda district of Uttar
Pradesh, about sixty miles south and
west of the city of Allahabad. In the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics, Chitrakut is the place in
which Rama, the epic’s hero, his wife
Sita, and his brother Lakshmana live
during the early part of their exile. It
is here as well that Rama instructs
another brother, Bharata, to rule as
regent until the fourteen years of Rama’s
exile have ended.
Chitswami
(late 16th c. C.E.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these eight poets were used for liturgical
purposes by the Pushti Marg, a religious
community whose members are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the Pushti
Marg’s sectarian literature, all eight are
also named as members of the commu-
nity and as associates of either the com-
munity’s founder, Vallabhacharya, or
his successor, Vitthalnath. Chitswami is
traditionally associated with Vitthalnath,
a link confirmed by his poems written in
praise of this guru. Aside from such
explicitly sectarian compositions,
Chitswami also wrote poetry in praise of
Krishna, which tends to be more
elaborate and uses more Sanskrit than
his contemporaries. To date, his works
have not been translated, perhaps
because interest in them is limited to
a small sect.
Chittirai
First month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Mesha (the zodiacal sign of
Aries, which by the Indian solar calendar
usually falls within April and May). This
name is a modification of Chitra, the four-
teenth of the twenty-seven nakshatras in
the lunar zodiac. See also Tamil months.
Chittirai
(2) Ten-day festival celebrated in the
southern Indian city of Madurai during
the Tamil month of Chittirai
(March–April). Madurai is famous for its
gigantic temple dedicated to the god-
dess Minakshi, and the Chittirai festival
celebrates Minakshi’s marriage to the
god Shiva in his form as Sundareshvara.
According to mythology, Minakshi is a
fierce goddess who vows that she will
marry only a man who bests her in bat-
tle. She fights and conquers all of the
kings of the earth, but when she
approaches Shiva, she is suddenly and
spontaneously stricken with modesty.
The powerful warrior is transformed
into a shy and bashful girl, and she
becomes his wife.
Although the wedding of a goddess
normally marks her domestication and
subordination to her spouse, in this case
Minakshi remains the more powerful
deity. She is the patron of Madurai, with
a temple dedicated to her, whereas
Shiva is merely her consort. The wed-
ding is celebrated with great festivity
throughout the city, and one of the high
points is the public procession of the
deities around the city in the temple
chariots. For further information see
Dean David Shulman, Tamil Temple
Myths, 1980; the festival is also the
subject of a film, The Wedding of
the Goddess, produced by the South
Asia Center of the University of
Wisconsin at Madison.
Chokamela
(d. 1338 C.E.) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. Chokamela was born an
untouchable Mahar, and he is the only
untouchable among the Varkari saints.
Despite Chokamela’s deep devotion to
Vithoba, his low social status prohibited
him from ever entering the god’s temple,
since his very presence would have ren-
dered it impure. The hagiographical
[[151]]
Chola Dynasty
literature tells many tales where Vithoba
comes outside to meet him. Chokamela’s
memorial shrine is at the steps of the
temple, the same steps that marked
his boundary during his life. It seems
that Chokamela accepted the restric-
tions that came with his social status,
but some of his poetry expresses
social protest. For further information
see G. A. Deleury, The Cult of Vithoba,
[[1960]]
; and Eleanor Zelliot, “Chokamela
and Eknath: Two Bhakti Modes of
Legitimacy for Modern Change,” in
Journal of Asian and African Studies, Vol.
[[15]]
, Nos. 1–2, 1980.
Chola Dynasty
(9th–13th c. C.E.) Southern Indian
dynasty whose ancestral homeland
was the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu.
The earliest Chola capital was in the city
of Tanjore itself, but was later moved
to Gangaikondacholapuran under
Rajendra I (r. 1014–1042 C.E.). The
Tanjore district is in the Cauvery River
delta and is extremely fertile rice-grow-
ing land. The Chola monarchs used this
agricultural strength as the foundation
for their empire. The Cholas were origi-
nally vassals of the Pallava dynasty but
became independent late in the ninth
century. In the tenth and eleventh cen-
turies, the Cholas were the dominant
power in southern India, controlling
much of peninsular India and Sri Lanka
and sending naval expeditions as far as
Malaysia. The Cholas were noted for
their public works, particularly the con-
struction of massive temples in the
Tanjore district and other parts of Tamil
Nadu; one of the most impressive was
the Brhadeshvar temple built by Raja
Raja (r. 985–1014 C.E.). On a smaller
scale, the Chola dynasty also patronized
exquisite sculptures, especially bronzes.
This dynasty’s rapid rise was marked
by an equally swift demise. By the
middle of the thirteenth century, they
had been attacked several times by
the Pandya dynasty and were finally
conquered in 1279.
[[152]]

Chudakarana
(“tonsure”) Samskara
The eighth of the traditional life cycle
ceremonies (samskaras). In the chu-
dakarana samskara, the hair is shaved
off of the child’s head, although fre-
quently a tuft of hair (chuda) is left. This
is the last of the childhood samskaras,
marking the ritual end of infancy, and it
is still often performed in modern India,
particularly by brahmin families. The
timing for this rite is usually determined
by family custom (kulachara), although
in many cases it is performed when the
child’s age is an odd number (most com-
monly at one, three, or five years old).
Since most Indian babies are born with
hair, and hair is commonly believed to
trap impurities, the chudakarana is seen
as a rite of purification where the last of
the residual impurities from childbirth
are removed. As in many other cultures,
this cut-off hair is believed to retain a
powerful connection with the child.
Traditional belief holds that in the
wrong hands, this hair could be used to
work black magic against the child.
Given this concern, the hair is usually
carefully gathered and disposed of, most
often by putting it into running water.
Chunar
Sandstone quarry about twenty-five
miles south of modern Benares. This
quarry is notable as the source of the
stone for the pillars erected by the
Mauryan king Ashoka. The pillars were
set up on the major trade routes within
his empire and were inscribed with royal
proclamations known as the pillar
edicts. See also Maurya dynasty.
Churail
(perhaps from the Sanskrit word cur,
meaning “to steal”) Feminine malignant
spirit believed to be the ghost of a
woman who dies childless, in childbirth,
or with her desires somehow unsatis-
fied. These frustrated desires lead such
spirits to seek revenge by harming others,Conch Shell
particularly children, to destroy the hap-
piness they were denied. For further
information about churails and other
unquiet spirits of the dead, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988; and Sudhir Kakar,
Shamans, Mystics, and Doctors, 1991.
Cinnabar
Common name for mercuric sulfide,
which takes the form of red crystals or
clumps. Cinnabar is important in Indian
alchemy, particularly that of the mercu-
rial (dhatuvada) school because it is a
chemical union of the two elements rep-
resenting the god Shiva (mercury) and
his consort, Shakti (sulfur). According
to Hindu alchemy, the world is a series
of bipolar opposites in tension with one
another. By unifying these opposing
forces, one may achieve spiritual
progress and the end of reincarnation
(samsara). In Hindu alchemy this is
done by physically consuming various
substances. In this case, mercury is said
to be Shiva’s semen and sulfur Shakti’s
uterine blood; their combination and
consumption is believed to spur the
aspirant’s progress.
Collyrium
A salve for the eyes, traditionally made
from soot, camphor, beeswax, and
various fragrances. Part of its function
is cosmetic—it is used to outline and
define the eyes. It is also widely believed
to have medicinal qualities that improve
one’s vision and heal various minor
eye ailments.
Commensality
This word refers to patterns of social
exchange, particularly those associated
with eating. In traditional Hindu society,
the hierarchical status distinctions
between different social groups were
both marked and maintained by strict
rules on exchanges and sharing.
Traditional marriage customs illustrate
the role of social groups, in which people
married those who belonged to their
own particular jati (“birth”), or social
subgroup. Another arena in which these
concerns were quite visible was that of
food. Cooked food is believed to be
extremely susceptible to ritual impurity
(ashaucha) and can transmit impurities
to the person eating it. To shield
themselves from this source of impurity,
groups with higher social status
would not accept cooked foods from
groups with lower social status. In
contrast, lower-status groups would
accept cooked foods from groups with
higher status.
These concerns over maintaining
social status set up certain eating pat-
terns whose influence is still evident.
Higher-status groups, particularly brah-
mins, would generally eat with mem-
bers of their own community and only
when a brahmin had cooked the food.
For groups highly concerned with ritual
purity, the best meal is one cooked at
home by a family member, because this
ensures the food’s purity. Even in mod-
ern times, the most orthodox brahmins
will eat food cooked outside the home
only when it cannot be avoided. It is
always considered preferable to eat food
brought from home, whether one is on a
long journey or merely at lunch in the
office. Although in earlier times, the
groups with the highest status would
generally not eat with others, this cus-
tom has changed. Thus brahmin office
workers may eat lunch with colleagues
from many different communities, but
they would never think of inviting them
for a meal at their homes. For further
information on the way that exchanges
reveal status differences, see McKim
Marriot, “Hindu Transactions: Diversity
Without Dualism,” in Bruce Kapferer
(ed.), Transaction and Meaning, 1976.
Conch Shell
With the end of its spiral removed, this
was used as both a musical instrument
and a weapon of war, since the sound of
certain conch shells was believed to
strike terror into people’s hearts. This is
[[153]]
Consecration
Coomaraswamy was largely responsible
for publicizing Hindu miniature paint-
ing as a genre distinct from the contem-
porary Muslim court painting. Due to
the strength of this and other interpre-
tive scholarly works, he became curator
of Indian and Muslim art at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston. He held this post
from 1917 to 1931, and his catalog of the
museum’s collection shows painstaking
and objective scholarship. In his later
years, he began to publish works on aes-
thetics, myth, religion, and culture,
focusing not only on India but also on
traditional Europe.
Corbelling
The architectural technique of corbelling was
used to form the arched entrance to the
Mukteshvar Temple in Bhubaneshvar.
one of the four objects invariably carried
by the god Vishnu and thus one of his
identifying markers. See shankha.
Consecration
This term can refer to two different rites
performed in the creation of Hindu
images. One of these is devapratishtha,
or “establishing the deity,” the rites by
which an image of a deity is constructed
and established as an object of worship.
The word consecration can also be used
to refer to pranapratishtha, the more
important ritual, in which the image is
infused with the breath of life and
becomes the seat for the deity.
Coomaraswamy, Ananda
(1877–1947) Intellectual and art histori-
an who was one of the first Indian schol-
ars to address a predominantly Western
audience. He was born in modern Sri
Lanka, the son of a Hindu father and an
English mother. Although he was
trained as a geologist, by 1910 he had
found his true vocation, the study of art.
[[154]]

In the realm of architecture this term
refers to the creation of a dome or arch
through overlapping masonry courses.
This technique was widely used in
Indian temples, particularly those con-
structed in the Nagara style of architec-
ture in Orissa and the rest of northern
India. Corbelling was the prevailing
method of creating the shape of an arch,
since the true arch—in which each
part is supported in tension with the
others—was unknown in classical
Hindu architecture.
Coromandel
Traditional name for the southern
Indian coastal region bordering the Bay
of Bengal, in the modern states of Tamil
Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
Corpse
In the Hindu worldview, a corpse is the
source of the most virulent possible rit-
ual impurity (ashaucha). Although
Hindus accept death as an inevitable
part of life, the dangers caused by a
corpse cannot be ignored. The dead
body must be appropriately handled,
both to protect the living from danger
and to help the deceased make a
smooth transition to the next life. For
this reason the last rites (antyeshthi
samskara) are begun on the day of
death itself. Among the earliest of theseCosmic Time
rites is the cremation of the dead body,
since the impurity will continue to affect
those around the body until it has been
consumed by fire. A second reason for
immediate cremation is to get rid of a
potential host for wandering spirits,
who according to popular fears, can
reanimate a corpse.
Coryat, Thomas
(1577–1617) English traveler in India
popularly known as the English faqir.
Coryat came to India from Persia and
spent several years traveling around the
Moghul empire in northern India as well
as residing in the Moghul court at Agra.
Although at times his need for patron-
age made him play the role of a buffoon
and flatterer, Coryat was a careful
observer who was full of curiosity. He is
believed to have been the first European
traveler to visit the pilgrimage city of
Haridwar, and he was impressed with
the rites performed there. He is also
believed to have gone into the Shiwalik
Hills all the way to the temple at
Jwalamukhi. Unfortunately, Coryat
died of dysentery before he could
record these observations, and the only
available references to these later
journeys come from his companion,
the Reverend Edward Terry. See also
Moghul dynasty.
Cosmic Egg
(brahmanda) One of the traditional
cosmological metaphors, which first
appears in the Markandeya Purana.
This text describes a single swollen
egg floating on the waters of the sea
of pralaya, or cosmic dissolution.
When this egg is broken open by
Brahma, its constituent parts (yolk,
white, shell, and various membranes)
form both the material universe and all
the creatures in it. Although this account
is clearly symbolic, it vividly expresses
the Hindu conviction that all things
have come from a single source,
and thus the entire cosmos is an
organic whole. For further elaboration see
Cornelia Dimmitt and J. A. B. van Buitenen
(eds. and trans.), Classical Hindu
Mythology, 1978.
Cosmic Time
In traditional Indian cosmology, time
has neither beginning nor end. Instead
it proceeds in unceasing cyclic alterna-
tions between creation and activity, fol-
lowed by cessation and quietude. The
universe thus has neither an ultimate
beginning nor an ultimate end—cre-
ation will always be followed by destruc-
tion and then destruction by a new
creation. Within the confines of this
assumption, there are several different
and sometimes competing systems for
measuring cosmic time.
The largest generally accepted
measure of time, spanning 4.32 billion
years, is the kalpa, or day of Brahma.
This is the ultimate limit for the
existence of the created world, although
within this period the universe
undergoes periodic renewals. At the
conclusion of the day of Brahma comes
the universal dissolution (pralaya), in
which the universe is completely
destroyed and reabsorbed into the god
Vishnu. The day of Brahma is followed
by a night of equal length, during which
the only living thing is Vishnu; the god
sleeps on the back of his serpent couch,
Shesha, which floats on the surface of
the cosmic ocean. When the night of
Brahma is ended, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel. This lotus opens to
reveal the god Brahma, who takes up
the work of creation, and the cycle of
activity begins anew. Because of his
spontaneous appearance at the begin-
ning of every cosmic age, one of the
names for Brahma is Svayambhu (“self-
born”). Unlike the Judeo-Christian con-
cept of creation, Brahma does not create
the world from nothing but merely
arranges and fashions existing elements
into a coherent and ordered cosmos.
The day of Brahma is broken up into
smaller units according to various sys-
tems. By far the most common system is
that of the four yugas, or cosmic ages.
According to this idea, the day of
[[155]]
Cosmology
Brahma is made up of one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas, named the Krta
yuga, Treta yuga, Dvapara yuga, and
Kali yuga. Each of these is shorter than
its predecessor and ushers in an era
more degenerate and depraved. The
passage of the four yugas begins with a
time of sudden and dramatic renewal at
the onset of the krta yuga, followed by a
steady and persistent decline. Although
the kali yuga is the shortest of the four
ages, it is also the time of the greatest
wickedness and depravity, in which any
evil is possible. It is also, not surprisingly,
considered to be the period in which we
are now living. By the end of the kali
yuga, things have gotten so bad that the
only solution is the destruction and
recreation of the earth, at which time
the next krta era begins. Even though
the kali yuga is the shortest age, it still
lasts for 432,000 years, and the preced-
ing yugas are two, three, and four times
the length of the kali age. The increasing
degeneracy of each of the four yugas is
symbolized by the metals associated
with them: gold (krta), silver (dvapara),
bronze (treta) and iron (kali). Another
indication is the status of human beings,
who are said to become shorter, more
wicked, and shorter-lived in each suc-
ceeding age. The paradigm of the four
yugas leaves little room in traditional
Hinduism for the notion of progress,
since according to this system, things
will never be better than they
have already been. It idealizes a lost
and unattainable past rather than a
utopian future.
An alternate system of measuring
cosmic time connects the human and
the divine calendars, with one human
year equal to a single day for the gods.
The six months when the sun travels
toward the north (uttarayana) is the
divine day, whereas the six months
when it travels south (dakshinayana) is
the divine night. Since an Indian solar
year is 360 solar days, a divine year
would thus last for 360 human years.
[[156]]

The life span of Brahma is one hundred
divine years and thus 36,000 human
years, after which the world is destroyed
and created anew.
A third system is that of the
Manvantaras, or ages of Manu. This sys-
tem divides the day of Brahma into
fourteen equal ages, with each one last-
ing a little less than 309,000 years. Each
age is identified by the particular divine
sovereign (manu) who rules during that
age. None of these three systems corre-
spond to one another, and there is no
real effort to reconcile them. This lack of
correspondence indicates that their
function was primarily mythic, to
establish a coherent cosmic chronology
and pattern rather than to describe
actual events.
Cosmology
Hindu culture has no single cosmology
but rather several different systems,
each of which is well established in its
own right. The oldest model appears in
the Rg Veda (10.90), the oldest Hindu
religious text, and is known as the
Purusha Sukta (“Hymn to the Primeval
Man”). This hymn describes the cre-
ation of the world and all living beings
as the result of the sacrifice of the
primeval man (purusha). Different parts
of his body become different parts of the
physical universe and the traditional
social groups. Another Vedic metaphor
is that of the Golden Embryo, which is
the only existing thing until it develops
into Prajapati, the creator of the uni-
verse. A third version, that of the Cosmic
Egg, is found in the later religious texts
known as the puranas, which are com-
pilations of mythology and lore.
According to this image, the entire uni-
verse is originally contained in the
Cosmic Egg. Once it is broken, the egg’s
constituent parts (shell, white, yolk, and
membranes) become all of the things of
the earth. The final cosmological image
from the puranas, and perhaps the most
common, begins with the god Vishnu
floating in the sea of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya), lying on the back of his serpentCow
couch, Shesha. When the time for cre-
ation comes, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel and opens to reveal the
god Brahma, who begins the process of
creation. This process reverses at the
onset of the cosmic dissolution, with
Brahma being reabsorbed into Vishnu’s
body. Despite their differing symbols, all
of these models share the conviction
that the universe has come from a single
source and thus that the entire cosmos
is an organic whole.
Although there are many models for
the origin of the cosmos, there is wider
agreement about its geography. The uni-
verse is generally considered to have
three tiers, and each of these tiers can
have multiple levels. The visible world is
considered the middle tier, sandwiched
between the heavens of the upper world
(often numbered as seven) and the
realms of the underworld. Some of the
latter are hells, whereas some of these
lower worlds are simply considered to
be alternate realms of existence. The vis-
ible world is often described as a series
of concentric landmasses (dvipas) sepa-
rated from each other by seven oceans
(the saptasindhu), each composed of a
different substance. The innermost of
these landmasses is Jambudvipa, whose
center is the mythical Mount Meru,
often identified with Mount Kailas in
the Himalayas. In traditional cosmology
Mount Meru stands at the center of the
universe and is compared to the central
calyx of a lotus. Mount Meru is sur-
rounded by mountain ranges, with a dif-
ferent region in each of the cardinal
directions. The region south of Mount
Meru is the land known as Bharata, the
traditional name for the Indian subcon-
tinent. Bharata is said to be superior to
the other three regions of Jambudvipa
because only in Bharata are religious rit-
uals correctly performed. In its mythic
geography, therefore, India is consid-
ered the center of the universe and the
best possible place to live to pursue reli-
gious life. For further information see

Cow
Animal revered by almost all modern
Hindus, although there is one small
Hindu community in the state of Kerala
that eats beef. Aside from this anomaly,
reverence for the cow is one of the few
unifying beliefs for almost all Hindu
communities. Demands for a complete
ban on cow slaughter have become a
time-honored way for political groups to
generate support from the orthodox
Hindu community, although these
demands carry far more weight in
northern India, where a significant
Muslim minority has few scruples
about slaughtering and eating beef.
Organized calls for such a ban began as
early as the 1880s with the growth of
tension between the Hindu and Muslim
communities. This sentiment, generally
called the Cow Protection Movement,
has continued to the present day.
Demands for a complete ban on cow
slaughter have regularly surfaced since
[[1947]]
, when India gained independence,
and this is one of the loaded causes of
Indian political life. Reverence for the
cow goes to such lengths that one of the
charitable acts performed by pious
Hindus is to contribute to goshalas,
institutions for old and infirm cows.
There is considerable speculation
and some disagreement about the
source of these feelings about the cow.
Some arguments have stressed the cow’s
value in an agricultural society, as a
source of both draft animals and repro-
ducible wealth. Other arguments have
stressed the cow’s ability to transform
agricultural waste into milk products
and dung, a common fuel in much of
northern India. Still others have noted
the way that feelings about the cow are
imbued with the symbolism of mother-
hood, since both are said to provide
milk for a child’s nourishment. This last
point is probably the most important,
since it is very clear that conservative
Hindu feelings for the cow are based pri-
marily on high emotional content rather
than on rational considerations of costs
and benefits.
[[157]]
Cow Dung
Girls carry dried cow dung mixed with straw to be used as fuel.
Cow Dung
This is considered both ritually pure and
purifying, perhaps because of its origin
in the sacred cow. A piece of ground can
be purified (as when preparing a site for
a ritual) by smearing it with cow dung.
Cow dung is one of the ingredients in
the “five products of the cow” (pancha-
gavya), which is drunk as a means of
purification from sin. In addition to its
spiritual significance, cattle dung is very
important for daily life in the villages of
India. When mixed with clay it forms a
hard, dustless, and easily cleaned sur-
face that is preferable to an earthen
floor. It is also a reliable source of fuel
available to even the poorest people.
Cow Protection Movement
General term for a grassroots conserva-
tive Hindu effort to ban the slaughter of
cattle, particularly the cow. The tradi-
tional Hindu devotion to the cow has
been articulated in calls for a ban on
cow slaughter for more than a century.
The call was first raised in 1875 by
Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the
founder of the reformist Arya Samaj. It
[[158]]

continued to be a basic demand of later
conservative Hindu-oriented groups,
including the Hindu Mahasabha,
the Ram Rajya Parishad, and the
Vishva Hindu Parishad. The call for this
ban occasionally surfaces even in
contemporary times, since it carries
strong support from many religiously
conservative Hindus.
The cow protection demand contin-
ues to have profound political implica-
tions. Swami Dayanand Saraswati’s
work in the late nineteenth century
coincided with the awakening of Indian
political consciousness and the begin-
nings of the struggle to regain power
from British imperial rule. Under British
power, overt political dissent was subject
to heavy government restrictions, and
outright rebellion was impossible. Since
the British did not generally interfere
with “religious” issues, the demand for a
ban on cow slaughter was a way for
Hindus to assert and define their identity
and by implication affirm that India was
a Hindu land.
The Cow Protection Movement also
caused friction between the Hindu and
Muslim communities, since HindusCreation Hymn
worship cows, whereas Muslims eat
them. Hindus saw Muslim beef con-
sumption as a flagrant violation of their
religious sensibilities, and Muslims saw
the demand for a ban on cow slaughter
as a thinly veiled attempt to reinforce
Muslim status as second-class citizens.
Communal relations were often particu-
larly volatile around the annual Muslim
festival of Id, at which it is traditional for
each family to sacrifice an animal and
in which many of the more affluent
Muslim families would sacrifice cattle.
As the relationship between these two
communities deteriorated in the 1930s,
cow slaughter (or rumor thereof) was
often cited as the spark for communal
riots in which hundreds of people
were killed.
This tension persists in modern
India, although it has rarely erupted into
violence since the partition of the sub-
continent in 1947. Modern India was
founded as a secular state where the
government does not favor any particu-
lar religious community. This founding
ethos has made the Indian government
reluctant to pass legislation banning
cattle slaughter, despite continued calls
from traditional Hindus. The Indian
Muslim community, facing the reality of
its minority status in a Hindu majority
state, has had to be far more discreet
about when and how such cow slaugh-
ter takes place.
Cow Slaughter
A complete ban on cow slaughter has
been one of the more durable issues
taken up by Hindu interest groups, from
before India gained independence in
[[1947]]
 all the way up to the present day.
Although debate on this issue has con-
tinuously emerged and faded, it remains
a reliable hot button for stirring Hindu
passions. This issue has predictably car-
ried far more weight in northern India,
where there is a significant Muslim
minority with no religious objection to
slaughtering and eating beef. The first
widespread demand for such a ban
came during the Cow Protection
Movement in the 1930s. This movement
aggravated tense communal relations
between the Hindu and Muslim com-
munities, resulting in significant blood-
shed. Since independence it has been a
perennial demand by religious leaders
and ascetics, and it has been an issue in
the platform of Hindu political organi-
zations such as the Jana Sangh, Shiv
Sena, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), and
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the past,
such demands had little effect since the
proponents did not have the power to
implement them. As the BJP and the Shiv
Sena have gained control of state and
local governments, they have tried to
implement this policy. In late 1995 the
VHP initiated a national drive to ban cow
slaughter completely. Like many of the
VHP’s campaigns, this was undertaken
just before upcoming elections, in this
case at the national level. This campaign
was seen as an attempt to polarize the
Hindu electorate in an effort to influ-
ence the national election.
Creation
See cosmology and cosmic time.
Creation Hymn
Popular name for a hymn in the Rg Veda
(10.129), which is one of the most
unusual hymns in the Vedas. The four
Vedas are the oldest Hindu religious
texts, and based on its style and content,
the Rg Veda is the oldest of these. Most
of the hymns in the Rg Veda are invoca-
tions addressed to various divinities.
These hymns are sung to invoke and
propitiate these divinities so that
human beings may enjoy the good
things in life. In marked contrast to the
confidence and optimism found in the
earlier hymns, the Creation Hymn takes
a far more speculative tone. In the
Creation Hymn, the poet begins by
imagining a time before the existence of
Being and Nonbeing, and he speculates
on the origin of the world. In the end the
poet ascribes all creation to a single
impersonal agent, “That One” (Tad

Ekam). However, the poem concludes
with the thought that even That One
may not know the secrets of the cosmos.
In its speculative tone and its admission
that the ultimate answer may be
unknown, it foreshadows the final
stratum of the Vedic literature,
the Upanishads.
Cremation
For most Hindus cremation is the
approved method for disposing of a
dead body, although one finds burials in
certain circumstances and subcommu-
nities. The body is usually cremated on
the day of death, often only a few hours
after the person has expired. Although
one could see this as a hygienic measure
in a hot climate, for many Hindus the
religious reasons are even more com-
pelling. First, a corpse is considered to
be a source of violent impurity
(ashaucha) that is removed by destroy-
ing the body by fire. A second reason for
immediate cremation is to get rid of a
potential vehicle for wandering spirits,
who according to popular fears, can
reanimate a corpse.
The rites leading to cremation begin
immediately after death. As for all Hindu
[[160]]

rituals, there is great variation in differ-
ent regions and communities, but the
following description gives a general
picture of these rites, at least in northern
India: The body is bathed, laid on a bier
(often made from bamboo, which is
cheap, strong, and readily available),
and covered with a cloth (white for a
man or a widow, a colored sari for a
married woman). In many cases the big
toes are tied together with a thread, due
to the belief that this prevents an alien
spirit from reanimating the body. The
mourners carry the bier to the crema-
tion ground, chanting the traditional
dirge Ram Nam Satya Hai, Satya Boli
Gati Hai (“God’s name is Truth, Truth
spoken is Passage”). On the way, the
mourners will often halt several times,
not only to rest but also on the chance
that the deceased was merely uncon-
scious. When they arrive at the crema-
tion ground (which is often by a river or
source of water), the corpse is bathed
again and set on a pyre. The chief
mourner (traditionally the eldest son)
circles the pyre, pouring water from a
clay pot, which is then broken. Since
poetic images often compare the
ephemeral quality of human bodies to
that of clay pots, this action clearlyCuckoo
signifies the final destruction of the
body. The chief mourner then ignites the
pyre and remains there while the body
burns. If the skull does not crack from
the heat of the fire, he is given a long
bamboo stick to pierce the skull. This is
believed to release the vital winds
(prana) of the deceased, which have col-
lected in the head. The chief mourner’s
final duty is to collect bones and ash
from the pyre (asthi-sanchayana), often
on the following day, and to immerse
these remains in the Ganges or some
other sacred river (asthi-visarjana).
The wooden pyre is the traditional
means for cremation and remains the
preferred method, despite the develop-
ment of more efficient and cheaper elec-
tric crematoria. This has led to an
unusual ecological problem in modern
India, particularly in the big cities. Many
poor people cannot afford to buy
enough wood to cremate the body with
a pyre but, because of tradition, are
unwilling to use electric crematoria.
They will perform incomplete crema-
tions in which part of the body is left
unburned. This is a bad state of affairs,
both from a religious and a public health
perspective, because the bodies are a
source of religious impurity and con-
tribute to the contamination of the
rivers. For further information see
Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj
Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969. For
accounts of modern practice, see
Lawrence Babb, The Divine Hierarchy,
[[1975]]
; and Ann Grodzins Gold, Fruitful
Journeys, 1988.
Cremation Ground
Literally a place where bodies are cre-
mated, but in Hindu culture it also has a
significant symbolic meaning. The cre-
mation ground is pervaded by associa-
tions with death and impurity
(ashaucha), making it an intensely
inauspicious place that is often believed
to be inhabited by malevolent wander-
ing spirits. The cremation ground is usu-
ally located at the boundary of a
community, both to remove any contact
with this source of inauspiciousness
from everyday life and perhaps to sym-
bolically deny the reality of death by rel-
egating the cremation ground to the
margins of the “settled” world.
One well-known exception to this
rule occurs in Benares, where the cre-
mation ground at Manikarnika Ghat is
in the middle of the city. This promi-
nence symbolically forces the inhabi-
tants to confront the reality of death, but
since Benares is also the home of the
god Shiva, it also raises the hope that
death will bring final liberation of the
soul (moksha). Similarly, although most
people avoid the cremation ground as
inauspicious, certain religious adepts
voluntarily choose it as their place of
residence and religious practice. This
may include certain types of ascetics
who are simply emulating terrifying
forms of Shiva who are said to reside in
cremation grounds. Practitioners of the
esoteric ritual tradition known as tantra
may live in a cremation ground to assert
the radical unity of all reality and tran-
scend the concepts of purity and impu-
rity, which they consider artificial. See
also cremation.
Cuckoo
(Cuculus melanoleucus or jacobinus)
Indian songbird intimately connected
with both love and the monsoon rains.
The cuckoo’s mating season comes dur-
ing the monsoon,when its piercing calls
are fancifully interpreted as piu, piu
(“beloved, beloved”). These cries are
said to excite the hearts of human
lovers—either to passion if they are
together or to bitter pain if the monsoon
is keeping them apart. The cuckoo’s
behavior in the rainy season is supposed
to reflect its love for the monsoon.
According to popular belief, the cuckoo
drinks only raindrops, which means that
for much of the year, it is tormented by
thirst. In devotional (bhakti) poetry, the
cuckoo is often used as a symbol for the
devotee (bhakta), who is tormented by
the deity’s absence but who waits

(1814–1893) First director of the
Archeological Survey of India and the

Cunningham first came to India in
[[1831]]
 as an officer in the Royal
Engineers, but his hobby was the study
of ancient India’s material artifacts.
This passion eventually resulted in the
formation of the A.S.I., which Cunningham
headed until his retirement in 1885. By
surveying sites, cataloging their con-
tents, and translating inscriptions, his
work was fundamental to preserving
India’s heritage.

Curses
In Hindu mythology, one of the stan-
dard devices either to advance the
story’s plot or to account for some
inexorable event. Such curses are
often the work of sages and other spir-
itual adepts, but they can also be
levied by any person who has perfect-
ly fulfilled his or her social role, such
as a faithful wife, loving son, or devot-
ed parent. Making a curse expends the
spiritual powers that a person has
accumulated. At least in mythical
tales, such curses invariably come
true no matter what a person might do
to try to prevent them. For example, in a
mythic story, King Parikshit secludes
himself on a high pillar to escape
death by snakebite but is killed when
a divine serpent conceals itself as a
worm in a piece of fruit. Once pro-
nounced, a curse cannot be simply
nullified, although it can be modified
to blunt its overall effect. For a consid-
eration of the function of curses in
Indian mythology, see Robert Goldman,
