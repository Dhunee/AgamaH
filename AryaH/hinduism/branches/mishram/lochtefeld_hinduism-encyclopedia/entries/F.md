See Panchatantra .many families have a customary age for
performing the chudakarana samskara,
the “tonsure” or head-shaving rite of
passage that marks the definitive end of
infancy. Some families perform this in
the first year, others in the third, or the
fifth, or even the seventh. Religious
practice varies widely among families,
although it tends to be very stable with-
in families, since this is one of the ways
in which families create a distinctive
identity for themselves.
FallaciesFamily Deity
In defining the parameters for what is
and is not a valid argument, certain
types of arguments have been dismissed
outright by Indian logicians, since these
arguments are held to be based on
invalid premises. The key flaw shared by
these objectionable arguments is the
fallacy known as self-residence, in
which the cause and its effect are the
same thing. Varieties of this fallacy
include reciprocal dependence, a
vicious circle, and an infinite regress.
The presence of any of these fallacies is
sufficient grounds to dismiss an argu-
ment as invalid.See kuladevata.

Family Custom
(kulachara) Hindu religion is fluid
enough that a family’s customary prac-
tices can heavily influence a person’s
individual religious life. For example,
family custom plays an important role
in worship. The Hindu pantheon con-
tains many different gods, and the one
that an individual worships as “God” is
often strongly influenced by the family’s
practice, although other factors such as
personal inclination can also play a role.
Family custom also plays an important
role in setting parameters for religious
practice, both in everyday religious life,
and in setting rules for performing the
rituals of the life cycle. For example,
Family Relationships
Hindus consider the family the basis of
society. The idealized Hindu family is a
multigenerational joint family, com-
posed of elderly parents, their adult
sons, and their sons’ families. The sons
are considered the core of the family,
since the daughters will live with their
husbands’ families after marriage and
are considered to belong to them. When
the families become too large, or ten-
sions between brothers develop to an
unbearable level, these joint families
divide into smaller households, upon
which the general pattern continues.
Hindu families have different names for
all possible family relationships. These
differing names reveal the exact nature
of the relationship and the person’s pre-
cise relationship in the family—as one
example, although in English the word
“aunt” can designate the sister of either
one’s father or one’s mother, there are
different names for both in northern
Indian languages. Some of this is related
to the higher status connected with the
father’s or the husband’s side of the fam-
ily, and some of it has to do with prox-
imity, since these relatives are more
likely to be living with one another in a
joint family or close by. These differ-
ences mark the lines of importance in
Indian families, which give greater
emphasis to the father’s side. One note-
worthy term is the word for the wife’s
[[225]]
Fani, Muhsin
brother (sala), which in modern times
often serves as a term of abuse.
Fani, Muhsin
(ca. mid-17th c.) Traditionally thought
to be the author of the Dabistan-i-
Mazahib (“School of Manners”), which
was probably written about 1665. The
Dabistan is an invaluable outside source
for the religious life of the times and
gives one of the earliest descriptions of
the Sikhs, as well as many other contem-
porary groups. Fani was a Persian, and a
Parsi by birth, who came to India
because of his intense curiosity about
religious life, and his desire to see what-
ever he could. He is believed to have
been a careful observer and relatively
objective. He states that he had simply
translated (into the Persian in which the
text was written) what his friends and
informants had told him, and the text
seems to support this claim.
Faqir
(variant of fakir, from the Arabic poor)
In the strictest sense of the word, this
refers to a Muslim ascetic, as is hinted
by the Arabic origin of the word.
Colloquially, the word has been used
much more broadly, as an appellation
for any ascetic (witness Winston
Churchill’s characterization of Mohandas
Gandhi as a “half-naked faqir”). Both
usages are still current in modern India.
Although since the partition of India in
[[1947]]
 the word more commonly desig-
nates a Muslim, Hindu ascetics still
describe someone who is detached from
all things and dependent on God for
support as a “faqir baba.”
Fasting
See upavasa.
Fatalism
Philosophical position attributed to the
Ajivika school. The Ajivikas believed
that all things were preordained by
an impersonal destiny (niyati), and
[[226]]

therefore that one’s conscious actions
had no effect on one’s future. Although
this position would seem to undercut
any reason for religious practice,
the Ajivikas were also noted for per-
forming strict asceticism, in the belief
that they were only doing what had been
predetermined for them. For further
information see Arthur Llewellyn
Basham, History and Doctrines of the
Ajivikas, 1981.
Fathers, World of the
The earliest reference to the transmigra-
tion of souls, which is found in both the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad (6.2) and
the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10),
makes a qualitative distinction between
two different paths for the soul. The
path to the world of the gods ultimately
led to the sun, and the person traveling
it did not return again; the path to the
world of the fathers led to the moon,
and the person traveling it was eventually
reborn on earth. The leitmotiv running
through all the Upanishads is the need
for individual spiritual realization, and
this is the key to getting on the path to
the world of the gods. Those who gain
such realization attain the final and ulti-
mate end, whereas those who simply do
good deeds will return to earth,
although their good deeds will give them
karmic benefits.
Festival Calendar
Since few festivals are celebrated by all
Hindus, establishing a single festival cal-
endar is problematic. Festival celebra-
tions are subject to the same differing
forces that drive the rest of Hindu life.
On one hand, there are significant
regional differences in the celebration of
festivals, and on the other there are
major sectarian variations. Some of the
sectarian festivals may be celebrated
within particular regions or they may be
celebrated across the nation. It is also
true that the general public is aware of
most festivals—by virtue of these days
being public holidays, or being markedFestival Calendar
on the calendar—but far fewer people
celebrate any particular festival as a reli-
gious holiday. Finally, some holidays are
so significant that they are celebrated by
almost everyone, although here too
some people will observe them with far
greater energy. For example, although
the Goddess festival known as the fall
Navaratri is celebrated throughout the
country, it is kept with particular gusto
in Bengal, where the cult of the Mother
Goddess is particularly important.
With these considerations in mind,
the festival calendar for the lunar year is
given below, with the holidays given in
order during the successive lunar
months. The purpose in this entry is
only to lay out the order of these festi-
vals during the year; further details for
the lunar months and each festival can
be found in the individual entries.

The festival calendar is further
complicated by the fact that the lunar
year begins on the first day of the bright
(waxing) half of the lunar month
of Chaitra. This creates an unusual
situation since, at least in northern
India, the lunar months end on the
full moon, making the two weeks of
the waning moon the first half of the
lunar month. The waning fortnight
in Chaitra comes at the end of the lunar
year, and the waxing fortnight that fol-
lows is the first fortnight of the follow-
ing year. Thus, the month of Chaitra is
both the first and the last month of the
lunar year.

Feticide
a military coup ousted a Parliament
dominated by Indians, and installed a
native Fijian as prime minister. Because
of these restrictions, many Indians still
work as tenant farmers for Fijian land-
lords, but they also play an important
role as shopkeepers and professionals.
Fire
Depiction of the god Vishnu’s Fish avatar.
Vishnu takes this form to protect living
creatures from floods that engulf the earth.
Feticide
This refers to selective abortion of
female fetuses, which was made possi-
ble by the advent of reliable prenatal
sex determination technology. This
practice is driven by the desire for sons
in Hindu culture, a desire spurred by
economic, social, and religious con-
cerns. Selective abortions were out-
lawed in India in 1995.
Fiji
One of the countries with significant
Hindu diaspora populations. Indians
were first brought to Fiji in 1879 as
indentured laborers to work in the sug-
arcane fields. In the 1990s Indians com-
prised about 45 percent of Fiji’s
population. Despite their near parity in
terms of population, Indians in Fiji have
been legally relegated to a minority role
and for the most part have been prohib-
ited from owning land. The split
between the Indian and Fijian commu-
nities became transparent in 1987, when
[[228]]

One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, wind, water, and akasha. In
some philosophical schools, each of the
elements is paired with one of the five
senses. Fire is associated with sight,
since the eye’s action in apprehending a
visual object is compared to flame dart-
ing out and scorching something.
Within the body, fire is also associated
with digestion, which is generally con-
ceived of as “cooking” the foods in the
digestive system.
Fish Avatar
The first of Vishnu’s ten full avatars or
“incarnations” on earth. Each avatar
appears when the cosmos is in crisis,
usually because of a demon (asura) who
has grown disproportionately strong,
and whose power is throwing the uni-
verse out of its natural balance.
According to the doctrine of the avatars,
Vishnu takes material form when the
earth has fallen out of equilibrium, to
destroy the source of evil and restore the
cosmic balance.
The tale of the fish avatar begins
in the distant past, when the righteous
king Manu discovers a small fish in the
water he holds between his cupped
hands as he performs the tarpana or
water-offering rite for his ancestors. The
compassionate king puts the tiny fish
into a pot of water, but the fish soon out-
grows it. As the fish keeps growing,
Manu transfers it to larger and larger
vessels, and finally puts the fish into the
Ganges. When the fish grows too large
for the Ganges and has to be put into the
ocean, Manu realizes that the fish isFour States of Consciousness
Vishnu himself, and begins to sing
Vishnu’s praises.
The fish then informs Manu
that the destruction of the world is
imminent—first through blazing fire
that will scorch all life, then through
floods that will turn the entire earth
into a single cosmic sea. Vishnu informs
Manu that the gods have built a boat
from the Vedas, and directs Manu to
collect all the creatures of the earth
and put them on the boat for safekeep-
ing. He promises Manu that all the
creatures on this boat will survive the
coming destruction, and when the
world returns to normal with the
advent of the Krta Age, Manu will be
the ruler of the earth.
Manu does as he has been directed,
and when the destruction of the world is
imminent, Vishnu appears in the form
of a great horned fish. Manu ties the
boat to the fish’s horn and, protected by
Vishnu’s power, all the beings on the
boat survive to repopulate the earth.
Five Forbidden Things
See panchamakara.
Float Festival
Festival celebrated in the city of
Madurai in the southern Indian state of
Tamil Nadu, on the full moon in the
lunar month of Magh ( January–
February). This is the birthday of King
Tirumalai Nayak (r. 1623–1659), dur-
ing whose reign large parts of
Madurai’s Minakshi Temple was built.
During the festival the goddess
Minakshi and her consort Sundareshvara
(an epithet of Shiva) are taken in pro-
cession to an artificial lake east of
Madurai, where they are put on richly
decorated floats and drawn back and
forth over the lake’s waters.
Four Dhams
(“[divine] abodes”) Four major pilgrim-
age sites in the four geographical cor-
ners of India, which lay out the
boundaries of India’s sacred geography:
Badrinath in the Himalayas; the city of
Puri in the east, on the Bay of Bengal;
Rameshvaram in the south; and
Dwaraka in the west. Each site is associ-
ated with one of the four Sanyasi maths
all supposedly founded by the great
philosopher Shankaracharya: Badrinath
has the Jyotir math in the town of
Joshimath (about thirty-five miles
south of Badrinath), Puri has the
Govardhan math, Dwaraka has the
Sharada math, and Rameshvaram has
the Shringeri math (in Shringeri). The
first three of these maths are close to
their associated sacred sites (tirthas),
but Shringeri is about 450 miles away
from Rameshvaram.
Four Great Crimes
In the dharma literature, four actions
are deemed such heinous offenses that
the person performing them becomes
an outcast from society. These four
actions are murdering a brahmin
(brahmahatya), stealing a brahmin’s
gold (steya), drinking liquor (sura-
pana), and adultery with the wife of
one’s guru (gurutalpaga). Aside from
expulsion from society, another indica-
tion of the gravity of these acts was that
their penalties were so severe that they
normally ended in death, and in some
cases this outcome was specifically pre-
scribed. In addition to prescribing such
punishments for the actual offenders,
the dharma literature also prescribed
expulsion for anyone who knowingly
associated with such people for a period
longer than one year.
Four States of Consciousness
Flood, Legend of
See Fish avatar.
A hierarchy of states of experience that
is first outlined in the Mandukya
Upanishad. In its description, the upan-
ishad moves from greatest duality to
utter nonduality; these four states are
[[229]]
Friday
also correlated with the phonetic
elements of the sacred sound Om.
Om symbolizes the four states of
consciousness and is the sum and
quintessence of them all. The first stage
of consciousness is waking conscious-
ness, in which one perceives both
subject and object; then dreaming,
in which one’s experience is totally
subjective; then deep sleep, in which
(until waking) even consciousness
of oneself as subject has been lost.
The final state is so removed from
human experience that it cannot be des-
ignated by language, and so is simply
called “the fourth” (turiya). In the
Mandukya Upanishad, this fourth state
is clearly identified as the ultimate truth,
the atman or inner Self, knowledge of
which brings final liberation of the soul.
Friday
(Shukravar) The fifth day of the Hindu
week, whose presiding planet is Venus
(Shukra). Friday is also the day of
the week dedicated to the Goddess and
is thus potentially a powerfully
auspicious day. Although the Goddess
can be worshiped in many forms, one
of the most popular in northern India
is Santoshi Ma. Worship of Santoshi
Ma has spread dramatically since its
origin in the mid-1970s.
Full Moon
(Purnimasa or Purnima) In northern
India, the full moon is the final day of
the lunar month, whereas in southern
India it is often considered the mid-
point. In either case, the full moon car-
ries associations of fullness, completion,
and abundance and is always an auspi-
cious time. One sign of its auspicious-
ness is the commonly accepted belief
that the religious merit generated from
rites performed on the day of a full
moon is equal to rites performed for an
entire month. There are festivals associ-
ated with the full moon of each lunar
month, but the most important are in
Baisakh (Buddha Purnima), Ashadh
[[230]]

(Guru Purnima), Shravan (Raksha
Bandhan), Kartik (Kartik Purnima),
and Phalgun (Holi).
