Jabali
A famous sage in Hindu mythology and
son of the sage Vishvamitra. Despite his
biological origins, Jabali eventually
becomes associated with his father’s
sworn enemy, the sage Vasishtha. As a
member of Vasishtha’s group, Jabali
becomes one of the advisers to King
Dasharatha, the father of the god-king
Rama in the epic Ramayana.
Jada
(“inert,” “insentient”) In a philosophical
context, the word jada is used to desig-
nate physical matter, which is inert and
devoid of cognitive functions. In a more
extended sense, the word can refer to
any person completely lacking religious
capacities, sensibilities, or interest, and
who is, thus, from a religious perspec-
tive, simply inert.
Jagadamba
(“Mother of the Universe”) Epithet of the
Goddess, highlighting her creative and
generative capacities. See Goddess.
Jagadisha
(“Lord of the Universe”) Epithet of the
regional deity Jagannath, and by exten-
sion the god Vishnu, to whom
Jagannath has been connected as a form
of Krishna, the eighth avatar or incar-
nation of Vishnu. Jagadisha is the name
given to Jagannath in the Dashavatara
Stotra, the opening hymn in the
Gitagovinda, a lyric devotional poem
composed by the poet Jayadeva. In
modern northern India, the name
Jagadisha is used in one of the most
[[308]]

popular and best-known devotional
hymns, the Jagadisha Arati, a hymn
directed more particularly to Vishnu.
Jagamohan
In the temple architecture of Orissa,
one of the major forms of the northern
Indian Nagara style, the jagamohan is
the entrance porch to the temple, which
provides a transitional space between
the outside world and the sacred space
further in. In Orissan temples, the jag-
amohan tended to be low and squat, in
sharp contrast to the deul, or main
internal area, a beehive-shaped tower
under which the image of the temple’s
primary deity resided.
Jagannath
(“Master of the Universe”) Presiding
deity of the Jagannath temple in Puri.
Puri is and has long been a major center
for Hindu culture, a circumstance that
has
underlined
and
reinforced
Jagannath’s importance as the city’s
presiding deity. Although Jagannath is
identified as a manifestation of the
god Krishna, his roots lie elsewhere.
He is generally considered to be an
autochthonous (“of the land”) deity,
who was originally the local deity of Puri
but who has been assimilated into the
wider pantheon as a form of Krishna,
and therefore, by extension, a form of
Vishnu. This assimilation shows
Jagannath’s importance and influence
in the local setting, since he could not
be simply marginalized. It is also an
example of the Vaishnava tendency
for such assimilation, most often
through the doctrine of the avatars or
divine incarnations.
In the Puri temple and other icono-
graphic representations, Jagannath
invariably appears as a member of a trio:
Jagannath (Krishna) appears on the
right,
his
brother
Balabhadra
(Balarama) is on the left, and the small-
er figure in the center is their sister
Subhadra. This triadic grouping and the
depiction of a female figure are veryJageshvar
unusual in Krishna devotion, as is the
form of these images, which clearly
come from a folk or tribal tradition. All
three deities are made from logs so
roughly cut that the facial features are
almost indistinguishable, their arms are
unnaturally short and stubby, and the
images are brightly painted. Each of
these peculiar elements is seen as fur-
ther evidence of Jagannath’s indigenous
roots. A final piece of evidence for his
local origins is seen in his connection
with his hereditary servants, the daitas,
a tribal people who are considered
virtually untouchable. Despite their
marginal status in conventional society,
the daitas are responsible for sculpting
new images of the trio when they are
periodically replaced. The daitas also
consider Jagannath their blood relative,
further pointing to his ambiguous roots.
The myth explaining these images is
based
on
the
virtuous
King
Indradyumna. Indradyumna has a
vision of Vishnu in a dream, in which
Vishnu directs the king to make an
image of Jagannath from an enormous
log that he has found. While the king is
wondering how to do this, a mysterious
man appears, who is actually
Vishvakarma, the architect of the gods.
The mysterious man offers to carve the
statues, on the condition that he will not
be disturbed until he is finished. He then
disappears into his workroom for two
weeks, but the people are mystified by
what he is doing, since they hear no
sounds of carving. This seeming inactiv-
ity piques the people’s curiosity, and
finally one of the queens prevails on the
king to look inside. When the king opens
the door, he finds no one there, and the
statues only half-finished. In another
dream that night, the king is ordered to
paint and consecrate the statues as they
are, and this form has reportedly
remained the same ever since. For fur-
ther information on the history and
influence of Jagannath, by far the best
source is Anncharlott Eschmann,
Hermann Kulke, and Gaya Charan
Tripathi, The Cult of Jagannath and the
Regional Tradition of Orissa, 1978.
Jageshvar
Temple complex and sacred site (tirtha)
in the village with the same name, locat-
ed in the Kumaon foothills of the
Himalayas in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
The Jageshvar temple complex contains
[[124]]
 different temples, concentrated in an
area about the size of a football field.
Virtually all of these temples are dedicated
to some form of the god Shiva, and the
few that house other deities are either
temples to the Goddess—considered to
be Shiva’s wife—or in one case to the god
Hanuman, who is sometimes considered
an avatar or incarnation of Shiva. Most of
these temples are extremely small—
either an open image of Shiva’s aniconic
symbol, the linga, or a temple building
no larger than a telephone booth. The
three largest most important temples are
to Shiva in his forms as Kedarnath, as
Mrtyunjaya (“Conqueror of Death”), and
as Jageshvar, from which the site gets its
name. The name Jageshvar means “The
Wakeful Lord” and signifies that this par-
ticular form of Shiva is always alert to the
needs of his devotees (bhakta) and will
quickly fulfill any request.
Local tradition claims that Jageshvar
is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a net-
work of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva, and at which Shiva is uniquely pre-
sent. This claim is not supported by the
traditional list of the jyotirlingas, but
Jageshvar has been a pilgrimage site for
more than a thousand years. The
Mrtyunjaya temple has been dated to the
eighth century C.E., while the Jageshvar
temple was built about two centuries
later. Since that time, further building at
the Jageshvar complex has come through
patronage by several different groups of
hill kings, most recently those of the
Chand dynasty, who ruled the region
between the fifteenth and eighteenth
centuries. The temple complex’s indis-
putable antiquity, its association with
royal power, and its identity as a place
where Shiva readily grants one’s wishes,
have all combined to make it the most
important pilgrimage place in the
Kumaon region.

Jahnavi
end, Jahnu bypasses this dilemma by
releasing her through his ear. She con-
tinues on her way to the sea, but
acquires the name Jahnavi by virtue of
being “born” from Jahnu.
Jahnu
Sculpture of the goddess Ganga, the Ganges River,
who is also known as Jahnavi.
Jahnavi
(“daughter of Jahnu”) Epithet of the
Ganges River, which Hindus consider to
be the physical form of the goddess
Ganga. The name Jahnavi refers to an
incident during her creation in which
she encounters Jahnu, a great ascetic
who has amassed great power through
performing harsh physical asceticism
(tapas). After the Ganges has been
brought down to earth by the sage
Bhagirath, but before she makes her
way to the ocean, the playful river picks
up and carries away Jahnu’s belongings
while the sage is meditating nearby.
Jahnu is enraged at this disrespect; to
punish Ganga, he drinks all of the water
in the river. When the gods realize what
has happened, they are very concerned.
They somehow manage to placate
Jahnu, and the sage agrees to release
her. The problem then is how to release
the Ganges in a way that will not defile
her, since vomiting her up or voiding her
as urine are both unacceptable. In the

Jaimini
(4th c. B.C.E.?) Figure traditionally cited
as the author of the Mimamsa Sutras,
the central texts of the Purva Mimamsa
school, one of the six schools of Indian
philosophy. The Mimamsa school is
most concerned with the examination
and pursuit of dharma (“righteous
action”). In their pursuit of dharma,
the Mimamsa also believed that all
necessary instructions were contained
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious
texts. Given these twin assumptions,
much of Mimamsa thought is devoted to
the principles and methods of textual
interpretation used to unlock the
instructions that they were confident
the Vedas contained.Jambudvipa
Jajman
Common form of the Sanskrit word
yajamana, “patron of the sacrifice.”
From the time of the earliest Vedic sacri-
fices, there was a sharp distinction
between the people who performed the
sacrifice (basically hired technicians)
and the people who actually paid the
money to sponsor it and were consid-
ered the rite’s true beneficiaries. In con-
temporary times, jajman is the term
used by pandas, the priests at pilgrim-
age places (tirtha), to refer to their pil-
grim clients, with whom they have a
hereditary relationship. This usage
admits the reality that the pilgrims are
their patrons, since the priests’ liveli-
hood comes from serving them, but the
term also carries associations of mutual
obligation. Pandas are entitled to fees
from their pilgrim clients but must also
render services to them, while pilgrims
are bound to uphold this hereditary
relationship but can depend on their
pandas for help.
and incendiary temper. In one of the
most famous episodes, when his wife
Renuka returns home late because
she has spent some time watching a
king and his wife sport in the water,
Jamadagni orders his sons to kill her. All
of them refuse except Parashuram, who
cuts off his mother’s head. Jamadagni is
pleased with Parashuram and tells him
to choose whatever reward he wants.
Parashuram requests that his mother be
restored to life again, which she is.
Jamadagni is also famous as the
owner of a divine cow that can pro-
vide all sorts of food on demand. The
local king grows covetous of the cow
and offers to buy it. When Jamadagni
refuses to sell her, the king’s men grow
angry, kill Jamadagni, and take the
cow back to the palace. It is in retalia-
tion for this heinous act that
Parashuram attempts to exterminate
the kingly class (kshatriyas) from the
face of the earth.
Jambhavan
Jallianwala Bagh
A park (bagh) in the center of the
northern Indian city of Amritsar at
which several thousand people were
killed or wounded in 1919. A crowd had
gathered at this park despite a strict
ban on public meetings established the
day before. The British officer in
charge, General Dyer, interpreted the
gathering as willful defiance of the law
and commanded his men to fire on the
crowd. This incident was highly signifi-
cant in the struggle for Indian indepen-
dence (finally achieved on August 15,
[[1947]]
), for it undercut British claims
that their presence was necessary to
keep the country from chaos and, in
the minds of many Indian leaders,
removed any moral authority by which
the British could justify their rule.
Jamadagni
In Hindu mythology, a great sage and
father of Parashuram avatar. Like many
sages, Jamadagni is a man of explosive
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Jambhavan
is one of the ministers of Sugriva,
king of the monkeys. Jambhavan is
generally described as a bear, although
in some sources he is said to be a mon-
key. In the search for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, it is Jambhavan
who convinces the monkey-god
Hanuman to attempt to jump over the
ocean to Lanka, reminding Hanuman of
his birth, deeds, and the divine boons
he has been given. Although at first
Hanuman doubts his ability, he is con-
vinced by Jambhavan’s encouragement
and, with a mighty spring, leaps over the
sea to Lanka, where he eventually dis-
covers Sita.
Jambudvipa
(“rose-apple”) In traditional mythic
geography, the first and innermost of
the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world. At
the center of Jambudvipa stands Mount
[[311]]
Jambukeshvar
Meru, the center of the entire universe.
Mount Meru is surrounded by mountain
ranges, and the part of Jambudvipa
south of Mount Meru is the land known
as Bharata, the traditional name for the
Indian subcontinent. See also Cosmology.
Jambukeshvar
Sacred site (tirtha) and southern Indian
temple-town near the city of
Tiruchirappalli in the state of Tamil
Nadu, directly opposite the great
temple complex of Shrirangam. The
temple at Jambukeshvar is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his role as “Lord of the
Rose-Apple (jambu) Tree;” the image of
Shiva is placed under one of these trees.
Jambukeshvar is also one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a
network of five southern Indian sites
sacred to Shiva. In each of these
sites Shiva is represented as a linga,
the pillar-shaped object that is his
symbolic form, and at each site the
linga is believed to be formed from one
of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). At Jambukeshvar,
Shiva’s image is associated with water,
and the linga is set into a pool created
by a natural spring.
Jammu
One of the three distinct cultural areas
in the modern Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir; the other two are
western Kashmir and Ladakh. Jammu
and Kashmir is a former princely state
once ruled by the Dogras, a small
regional dynasty. Although the Dogra
kings were Hindus, they ruled over
the minority populations of the
mostly Muslim Kashmiris and the
mostly Buddhist Ladakhis; this ethnic
and religious division continues in
modern times. The Jammu region is
geographically part of the northern
Indian plain, and the surrounding
regions south of the Shiwalik Hills are
Hindu majority regions. However,
Jammu is also in close proximity to the
[[312]]

Punjab, the center of Sikhism, a
monotheistic religion that combines
elements of Hinduism and Islam; conse-
quently Jammu is also home to a signifi-
cant Sikh population. By far the most
celebrated shrine in the Jammu region
is the one dedicated to Vaishno Devi,
a goddess who is reputed to grant all
of one’s wishes. In the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, Jammu was
also one of the centers for the Pahari
school of miniature painting. Aside
from being the name of this region,
Jammu is also the name of the region’s
largest city, the state’s traditional
winter capital. For general information
about Jammu and all the regions of
India, an accessible reference is

Janabai
(d. c.1350) Female poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba at his temple at
Pandharpur in the modern state of
Maharashtra. According to tradition,
Janabai came to Pandharpur with her
parents when she was seven but refused
to go home with them, saying that she
wanted to remain close to the Lord. She
became the servant of another Varkari
saint, Namdev, who made her a mem-
ber of his circle of devotees (bhakta).
Janabai is famous for her devotional
songs, which remain popular today. For
further information see Justin E. Abbott
and Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories
of Indian Saints, 1982; and G. A. Deleury,
The Cult of Vithoba, 1960.
Janaka
The foster father of the goddess Sita. He
discovered her one day while plowing a
furrow in a field. In Hindu mythology,
Janaka is the paradigm of the sage-king,
a person who despite his wealth and
position was as perfectly dispassionate
as any ascetic living in the forest.Janamjeya
Janaki Navami
Festival falling on the ninth day
(navami) of the dark (waning) half
of the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March). This festival cele-
brates the birth of Sita, wife of the
god king Rama and heroine of the
epic Ramayana. Sita is not born in the
usual manner, but is found by King
Janaka in a furrow as he plows a field
(hence the name Janaki, a female form
of Janaka). As the wife of Rama, himself
an avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu, Sita is believed to be a form of
Lakshmi, Vishnu’s wife. In her absolute
devotion to her husband, Sita is consid-
ered a model for Indian women; women
performing the prescribed religious rites
for this day are promised children and
prosperity.
Janakpur
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the
western part of Nepal, seven miles
north of the border with the Indian state
of Bihar. Janakpur is said to be the
capital of King Janaka, a noted sage and
the foster father of the goddess Sita
in the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics. According to tra-
dition, Janaka’s capital was destroyed
during the war described in the
Mahabharata—the other great Hindu
epic—and disappeared without a
trace. The present site of Janakpur
dates from the early eighteenth century
and is said to have been discovered by
two Vaishnava devotees (bhakta),
Chaturbhuj Giri and Sur Kishor.
Chaturbhuj Giri had a vision of the god
Rama in a dream and was directed to
dig beneath a banyan tree. When he did,
he found four images of Vishnu, each in
a differing divine manifestation. Sur
Kishor was a great devotee of Sita, and
through her agency discovered the spot
as well. Other ascetics began to come to
this site, which is still an important stop
on the annual pilgrimage cycle of the
Ramanandi ascetics. The ascetics were
followed by shepherds and merchants,
and the town of Janakpur gradually grew
Janaki Mandir in Janakpur, Nepal. This temple
marks the site where the goddess Sita first appeared.
up from there. For extensive treatment
of this site and the veracity of these
stories, see Richard Burghart, “The
History of Janakpur,” in Kailash, Vol. 6,
No. 4, 1978.
Janamjeya
In Hindu mythology, the son of King
Parikshit; Janamjeya rules after his
father’s untimely death from the bite of
the serpent Takshaka. Janamjeya has a
pronounced hatred of serpents because
of Takshaka’s role in his father’s death,
and during his reign he performs a great
sacrifice known as the Sarpasatra,
through which most of the snakes on
earth are killed. Takshaka manages to
stop the sacrifice before all of the earth’s
serpents are completely wiped out by
pleading with a brahmin to help him.
The brahmin comes to Janamjeya’s sac-
rifice as a guest and requests that the
sacrifice be stopped. Since, according to
tradition, a brahmin guest’s request can-
not be refused, Janamjeya is compelled
to curtail the rite.

Janardana
Janardana
(“exciting his devotees”) Epithet of the
god Krishna. See Krishna.
Jana Sangh
Modern Indian political party, founded
in 1951 by Shyam Prasad Mookerjee.
Despite Mookerjee’s earlier roots in the
Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist
organization, the Jana Sangh’s leader-
ship largely came from workers
dispatched by another conservative
Hindu organization, the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS). By the mid-
[[1950]]
s the Jana Sangh had become the
political arm of the RSS, with RSS mem-
bers filling most of the party’s important
positions. In its political platform the
Jana Sangh espoused many populist
Hindu causes, such as a ban on cow
slaughter and the prohibition of alco-
holic beverages, but the party was also
noted for its sympathetic orientation
toward farmers, who formed one of its
important constituencies. The Jana
Sangh’s high point came in the 1977 gen-
eral elections, when it won ninety-three
seats in Parliament. It was the largest
single party in the coalition of political
parties that ousted Indira Gandhi’s
Congress Party and ended their two
years of martial law. This triumph quick-
ly turned to failure: the Janata govern-
ment dissolved over the so-called
dual-membership controversy, which
was rooted in concerns over Jana Sangh
members simultaneously being mem-
bers of the RSS. Legislators from other
parties saw this as creating a conflict of
interest and were also wary of their gov-
ernment being directed by the RSS,
which was considered a Hindu chauvin-
ist organization. These outside legisla-
tors demanded that Jana Sangh members
renounce all RSS ties, which the latter
were unwilling to do. All attempts at
compromise eventually failed, and after
the Congress Party came back to power
in 1980, the Jana Sangh legislators and
other remnants of the Janata govern-
ment formed a new party, the Bharatiya
Janata Party. For further information

Politics, 1990.
Janeu
The sacred thread worn by all “twice-
born” (dvija) men, as a visible symbol of
having undergone the adolescent reli-
gious initiation known as the “second
birth.” The janeu is a circular cord made
of three strands (in which each cord also
has three strands), which is worn over
the left shoulder, crossing the body to
fall on the right hip. See sacred thread.
Jangama
(“moving”) Priestly subgroup in the
Virashaiva or Lingayat community,
whose members are mainly concentrated
in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
The Virashaivas are a devotional com-
munity who stress the worship of Shiva
as the only real deity; aside from being
essentially monotheistic, they have also
rejected all forms of image worship
except for Shiva’s symbol, the linga. The
Virashaivas were founded by the poet-
saint Basavanna, partly in rebellion
against the prevailing caste system, and
he created the jangamas as a parallel
priesthood to care for his community’s
members. The major function of the
jangamas is to officiate at lifecycle cere-
monies for the members of the commu-
nity, such as birth, coming-of-age,
marriage, and death. Jangamas may be
married and raise families, but this
Virashaiva subcommunity also serves as
the major source of recruits for the celi-
bate Virashaiva monks (viraktas), who
have the highest status as religious lead-
ers in the community.
Janmashtami
Festival on the eighth day (ashtami)
of the dark (waning) half of the lunar
month of Bhadrapada (August–
September), which is celebrated as the
god Krishna’s birthday. As with allJaratkaru
holidays connected with Krishna, this
festival is particularly observed in the
Braj region, where Krishna is sup-
posed to have lived, although it is also
celebrated throughout the country.
Devotees (bhakta) often stay up late
into the night, since Krishna is said to
have been born at midnight, and the
observances are often punctuated with
singing, chanting, parades, and dramas
enacting events in Krishna’s life. It is
during the month around Janmashtami
that the dramas known as the Krishna
lilas are presented in the town of
Brindavan, traditionally believed to
have been Krishna’s childhood home.
According to tradition, Krishna is the
eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. He
is born in a prison in the city of Mathura
in which his parents are held by Devaki’s
brother, the wicked king Kamsa. Kamsa
has imprisoned the pair in an attempt to
thwart the prophecy that he will be
killed by his sister Devaki’s eighth son.
Kamsa has killed all of Devaki’s older
children at birth and intends to do the
same with Krishna, but when Krishna is
born wondrous things begin to happen:
the jailers fall into a deep sleep, the
locked prison doors miraculously
open, and Vasudeva is able to spirit the
infant out of the prison to the home of
the couple who will become his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. Vasudeva
returns that night, bearing Yashoda’s
new-born baby girl, who is really the
goddess Bhadrakali in disguise. The
next morning Kamsa kills the child by
dashing her against a stone, but from
the body arises a fearsome form of the
Goddess, who taunts Kamsa by telling
him that the person who will slay him
has already escaped.
Japa
(“muttering,” “whispering”) Individual
recitation, usually the repeated utter-
ance of a particular mantra or divine
name(s), often while using a string of
beads (mala) to perform a definite num-
ber of such repetitions. Such recitation
is usually performed as an individual
religious act, in a tone of voice audible
to the reciter but not others who may be
present. Japa is a particularly important
practice in Hindu traditions stressing
the benefits of reciting the divine
name—such repetitions are believed to
have gradual spiritual benefits. Japa is
particularly stressed in the Gaudiya
Vaishnavas community founded by the
Bengali saint Chaitanya, where public
recitation of the divine name is an
important part of religious life.
Jaratkarava Artabhaga
One of the sage Yajnavalkya’s interview-
ers in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad,
one of the earliest of the Upanishads.
The third chapter of this upanishad
presents a series of questioners, each
trying to test Yajnavalkya’s assertion that
he is the best brahmin of all. Artabhaga
finally questions Yajnavalkya about the
human sense faculties and their realms
of action, and eventually asks what hap-
pens to a person after death. Yajnavalkya
draws him aside in private, and talks to
him about karma (“action”), in what
is generally regarded as the oldest
reference to this fundamental Indian
religious idea.
Jaratkaru
In Hindu mythology, a sage famous not
only for his asceticism and knowledge
but also because he illustrates the
importance of male children in Hindu
culture. Jaratkaru is a lifelong ascetic
with no intention of marrying until he
has a vision of his ancestors suspended
over one of the hells by a grass rope,
through which a rat (time personified) is
gradually gnawing. His ancestors inform
Jaratkaru that his failure to have a son
means that the lineage will end with
him, along with the rites performed for
the deceased in that lineage, and that
they will then fall into hell. To forestall
this disaster, they instruct Jaratkaru to
marry and beget a son.
Jaratkaru is initially hostile to this
idea, but later specifies that if a woman
[[315]]
Jat
also named Jaratkaru is found and given
to him as alms, he will marry her. His
conditions eventually reaches the Naga
(snake) king Vasuki, who has a sister by
this name. The marriage is performed
under the condition that if she displeases
Jaratkaru, he will leave her. Given
Jaratkaru’s ascetic past, it is not surpris-
ing that things did not work out between
them. After being married several
months, his wife has the dilemma of
allowing Jaratkaru to sleep past sunset,
which will make him late for his evening
prayers, or to wake him and risk his dis-
pleasure. She chooses the latter;
Jaratkaru is displeased with her and
leaves despite her entreaties. Some time
later the wife Jaratkaru gives birth to a
son, Astika, and thus the sage’s obliga-
tions are fulfilled.
Jat
One of the hundreds of subgroups of
traditional Indian society known as jatis
(“birth”). Each jati was associated
with—and held a monopoly over—a
particular occupation, and that occupa-
tion determined the social status of the
jati’s members; this system led to the
modern caste system. The Jats are a
northern Indian jati whose members are
spread through many of the states of
northern India, particularly Haryana,
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.
In the Punjab the Jats are evenly split
between Hindus and Sikhs, but in other
areas the community is solidly Hindu.
The Jats’ hereditary occupation is farm-
ing, and they are often described as
tough and resilient peasants; these qual-
ities have also made them superior sol-
diers, both in the service of the British
Empire and in independent India.
Jata
A long matted lock of hair. Ascetics
often wear their hair in jatas for a num-
ber of religious and symbolic reasons.
On one level, the uncut hair is a symbol
of renunciation; its unkempt, matted
quality demonstrates the ascetic’s
[[316]]

distance from worldly concerns with
order and propriety. On another level,
ascetics wear jatas in imitation of the
god Shiva, the paradigmatic ascetic,
who is always portrayed wearing his hair
in matted locks. Although jatas are most
commonly worn by devotees (bhakta)
of Shiva, some strict renunciants who
are devotees of the god Vishnu also
favor this hairstyle. Finally, from a non-
religious perspective, jatas are simply a
very low-maintenance hairstyle. They
are usually rubbed with wood ash to
keep them relatively neat; as the hair
grows the jatas simply become longer,
and in many cases they can be neatly
twisted into a crown, or jatamakuta, on
the top of the head.
Jatakarma Samskara
The fourth of the traditional life-cycle
ceremonies (samskaras). The first three
were to be performed before and during
pregnancy, while the jatakarma sam-
skara was to be performed immediately
after the birth. This ceremony had sev-
eral elements, but the most prominent
were uttering the word “vak” (“speech,”
a synonym for Saraswati) into the
child’s ear and feeding the child honey,
ghee, and other items believed to bring
good luck. This samskara is seldom per-
formed in modern times, although there
are many other rites connected with
birth that are intended to protect the
mother and child and to kindle the
child’s potential.
Jatamakuta
A crown (makuta) made of matted locks
of hair (jata) twisted together and
bound on top of the head. In Hindu
iconography the jatamakuta is most
closely associated with the god Shiva,
who is the paradigmatic ascetic and
always wears his hair in matted locks. In
modern times, the jatamakuta is still a
hairstyle associated with many ascetics,
both Shaiva and Vaishnava.Jatra
An ascetic in Haridwar with his hair in matted locks (jata).
This hairstyle marks the wearer as a person who is detached from worldly concerns.
Jatayu
A virtuous vulture in the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics.
When Rama’s wife Sita is kidnapped by
the demon-king Ravana and is being
spirited away in Ravana’s aerial chariot,
Jatayu makes a valiant effort to rescue
her. In his battle with Ravana, Jatayu’s
wings are cut off; the force of his subse-
quent fall left him near death. With his
dying breaths he informs Rama and
Rama’s brother Lakshmana of what has
happened, and identifies Ravana as
Sita’s kidnapper. Although Jatayu fails to
rescue Sita, he is critical to the plot of the
epic because he gives Rama the crucial
information he needs to begin to
searching for her.
Jati
(“birth”) A traditional social subgroup in
Indian society. There were hundreds of
these groups, considered exogamous
because strict taboos existed against
marrying outside one’s jati—people
belonging to different jatis were looked
upon as different “species” of people.
Jatis were usually defined by the sub-
group’s traditional occupation, which
they and they alone had the right to
practice. The jatis were hierarchically
arranged in society, based on the per-
ceived purity or impurity (ashaucha) of
their occupations, and this hierarchy
formed the basis for the traditional
Hindu social structure known as the
caste system.
Jatra
Vernacular form of the Sanskrit word
yatra (“journey”). The word yatra is
most often used to describe journeys to
far-away places, whereas jatra is used to
denote visits to spots within the imme-
diate region.
[[317]]
Jauhar
Jauhar
A mass suicide in which women and
children threw themselves on a bonfire
to protect the family from dishonor
when the men were defeated or killed in
battle. Jauhar was considered the
women’s counterpart to death in com-
bat. If their husbands and fathers were
heavily outnumbered and faced certain
death in battle, women would perform a
mass suicide after the men left their
fortresses. This phenomenon was most
closely associated with the desert state
of Rajasthan, which has strong martial
traditions and a great stress on the
importance of family honor. It is partic-
ularly associated with the Rajasthani
city of Chittorgarh, where jauhars
occurred in 1303, 1535, and 1568.
Jaya
In Hindu mythology, one of the gate-
keepers of the god Vishnu’s heavenly
abode, Vaikuntha, who, with his brother
Vijaya, is cursed to be born three times
as a demon (asura) and to be killed each
time by Vishnu. The sage Sanaka places
this curse on them when they prevent
him from seeing Vishnu. In their first
birth the two are born as Hiranyaksha
and Hiranyakashipu, who are killed by
the Boar avatar and the Man-Lion
avatar respectively. In their second
incarnation they are born as Ravana
and Kumbhakarna, who are both killed
by Vishnu’s Rama avatar. In their final
birth they incarnate as Shisupala and
Dantavaktra and are killed by Vishnu’s
Krishna avatar. After the conditions of
the curse have been fulfilled, they return
to their duties as Vishnu’s gatekeepers.
Jayadeva
(12th c.) Poet and author of the
Gitagovinda, a lyric devotional poem
that uses the separation and eventual
reunion of the lovers Krishna and
Radha as a metaphor for the union of
the human soul with God. According to
tradition, Jayadeva lived at the temple of
the god Jagannath in the city of Puri,
[[318]]

where his wife Padmavati was a dancer.
She is said to have been the first to
dance to Jayadeva’s songs as an offering
to Jagannath, and the Gitagovinda has
been sung and danced as a regular part
of temple worship up to the present
time. For further information see
Barbara Stoller Miller (ed. and trans.),
The Love Song of the Dark Lord, 1977.
Jayadratha
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Jayadratha is a king
who is married to the princess Dussala.
Dussala is the only sister of the
Kauravas, a group of one hundred
brothers who are the epic’s antagonists.
Jayadratha once sought the hand of
Draupadi, and because of his bitterness
at having lost her to the warrior Arjuna,
he opposes Arjuna and his brothers, the
Pandavas, for the rest of his life. During
the Mahabharata war between the
Pandavas and the Kauravas, Jayadratha
takes the side of the Kauravas and is
eventually killed by Arjuna. At
Jayadratha’s birth a celestial voice has
prophesied that the head of the person
who causes Jayadratha’s head to fall to
earth will split into a hundred pieces.
Mindful of this, Arjuna, a peerless
archer, cuts off Jayadratha’s head with an
arrow in such a way that it lands in the
lap of Jayadratha’s father, Brhatkaya.
Brhatkaya is so startled that he allows
the head to fall from his lap to the
ground, and his own head breaks into a
hundred pieces.
Jaya Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half
of the lunar month of Magh (January–
February). As are all eleventh-day obser-
vances, this festival is dedicated to the
worship of Vishnu, on this day particu-
larly in his form as Krishna. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites,
usually involving fasting (upavasa) and
worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance:Jimutavahana
faithfully observing the “jaya,” or
“victory,” festival is said to ensure that
one’s desired goal will be attained.who has been brought into the pantheon
of gods as an avatar, or incarnation, of
the god Shiva.
JayapalaJhanki
(d. 1001) One of the last kings of the
Pratiharas, a northern Indian dynasty
whose capital was in Kanyakubja on the
Ganges River. By Jayapala’s time the
divided Hindu kingdoms in northern
India were being threatened by the
Turkish emirs, especially Mahmud of
Ghazni, who had settled in modern-day
Afghanistan. Jayapala was defeated and
captured in battle with Mahmud and
subsequently committed suicide; a
short time later, Jayapala’s son
Anandapala suffered a crushing defeat,
leaving a nearly complete collapse of
power in northern India. Because of this
absence of any effective opposition,
Mahmud was able to indulge in almost
yearly campaigns of pillage and plunder.(“glimpse”) A momentary “glimpse” of
the divine, in which the devotee (bhakta)
gains momentary access to the world of
the gods. Jhankis are most often con-
veyed through the performing arts:
through the mental images created
when devotional poetry is read, recited,
or sung, or through the images presented
in religious dance, drama, or film.
During these momentary encounters,
the devotee comes briefly into the pres-
ence of the deity, sharing the deity’s
world. This stress on the opportunity to
experience a brief physical presence in
the deity’s world is particularly strong in
the Vaishnava devotionalism connected
with the gods Krishna and Rama.
Worship of these deities often stresses
visualization of the deity’s life and every-
day actions as a way for devotees to gain
access to that divine world. Devotees of
both deities have created plays, or lilas,
to aid them in this process: for Rama,
they are the Ram Lilas, which are per-
formed throughout India during the
autumn festival season, and for Krishna,
they are the Krishna Lilas, performed
during the annual monsoon season in
Brindavan, Krishna’s childhood home.
Jayarashi
(7th c.?) Author of the Tattvopaplavasimha,
one of the only surviving texts of the
materialist philosophical school. One
of the philosophical peculiarities of
the materialist school was that they
accepted only perception (pratyaksha)
as a reliable pramana, or means
by which people can gain true and
accurate knowledge. In his text,
Jayarashi argued against the reliability of
inference (anumana) as one of the
pramanas by refuting the concept of
cause and effect. To make an inference,
such as inferring the result an action
will bring in the future based on the
result it brought in the past, one
must believe that the cause-and-effect
model is reliable.
Jejuri
Town in the Pune district of the central
Indian state of Maharashtra, about forty
miles south and east of the city of Pune.
Jejuri is primarily noted as the site of the
primary temple to Khandoba, an
important Maharashtrian regional deity
Jimutavahana
(early 12th c.) Author of the Dayabhaga,
a legal text primarily concerned with
inheritance, partition, and the division
of property. It eventually became the pri-
mary legal authority for the Bengal cul-
tural region; areas outside Bengal were
usually governed by a different legal text,
the Mitakshara . One of the major differ-
ences between these texts concerns the
nature of inheritance. The Mitakshara
stresses inheritance by survivorship, in
which only living males can inherit prop-
erty, whereas the Dayabhaga stresses
inheritance by succession, in which a
dead man’s heirs can inherit in his name.
[[319]]
Jiva
Jiva
(“life”) In philosophical and Vaishnava
(devotees of the god Vishnu) discussion,
jiva is the name used for the embodied
soul of a human being. In a more
general sense, the word can refer to
any living being.
Jivacchraddha
(“Shraddha for a living [person]”) A
particular type of shraddha, or memor-
ial service for the dead, although in
this case it is performed for a person
who is still living. In many cases, a
person performs the Jivacchraddha for
himself if he has no sons to fulfill the
responsibility or if he suspects that
the rite may not be performed properly
after his death. The person performing
this rite makes a small figure of sacred
kusha grass, representing the person for
whom the shraddha is being performed,
and then proceeds with the normal
shraddha ceremony.
Jivanmukta
In Indian philosophy, a person who has
attained final liberation of the soul while
still living (jivanmukti) and who contin-
ues to live in a state of liberation. The
concept of the jivanmukta is essential in
many branches of Advaita Vedanta, one
of the six schools of classical Indian phi-
losophy. The Advaita school upholds a
philosophical position known as
monism, which is the belief that a single
Ultimate Reality known as Brahman lies
behind all things, and that all things are
merely differing forms of that reality. For
Advaita proponents, the problem of
human bondage is that human beings,
blinded by avidya or mistaken under-
standing, do not recognize this ultimate
unity, but mistakenly persist in seeing
the world as made up of separate and
diverse things. The possibility of attain-
ing jivanmukta status is essential to the
Advaita school because it supports their
belief that bondage and liberation are
attained not by doing or becoming any-
thing, but rather by replacing a mistaken
[[320]]

understanding with a correct one. After
this has happened one will continue
to live, but because of the radical change
in consciousness one’s life will never
be the same.
Jivanmukti
(“liberation while living”) In later Indian
philosophy, the notion that one can
attain final liberation of the soul while
still living and continue to live after that
in a liberated state. The jivanmukta
(one who is liberated while still living) is
an important claim for many of the sub-
schools of Advaita Vedanta, one of the
six schools of classical Indian philoso-
phy. The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality known as Brahman lies behind
all things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of that reality. For
Advaita proponents, the problem of
human bondage is that human beings,
blinded by avidya or mistaken under-
standing, do not recognize this ultimate
unity. Liberation is not attained by
“doing” anything or by becoming some-
thing that one is not, but by realizing
what has always been the case, and thus
exchanging a mistaken understanding
for a correct one. Although this cogni-
tion forever changes how a person per-
ceives the world, it brings no ontological
changes, meaning that on a physical
level one continues to exist as before,
until the karma that has created one’s
present body is exhausted. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara and His
Pupils, 1981.
Jnana
In Indian philosophical thought, a
word with different meanings in
different contexts. The word jnana is
derived from the verb “to know,” and
one of its meanings, at least in a
perceptual context, is “awareness.” In a
more abstract sense it stands for what
it means to truly “know” something;Jnaneshvar
along with karmamarga and the
bhaktimarga, the jnanamarga is one of
the paths to liberation of the soul
mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. In this
latter context, an appropriate transla-
tion might be “wisdom” or “realization,”
since this is not the sort of “knowledge”
that comes from reading a book or
receiving instruction, but instead
reflects profound understanding gained
through great effort.
Jnanakarmasamucchaya
(“combination of awareness and
action”) Religious discipline for ending
the bondage and reincarnation (sam-
sara) of the soul, which was advocated
by members of the bhedabhada
(“identity-in-difference”) philosophical
school. According to this school, correct
awareness (jnana) and ritual action
(karma) were both necessary elements
in gaining final liberation of the soul.
The preparatory step was to perform
meritorious ritual actions—fasting
(upavasa), worship, and pilgrimage—to
weaken one’s negative karmic disposi-
tions, such as greed, anger, and igno-
rance. These weakened dispositions
were later completely destroyed through
meditation. The assumptions behind
this path were attacked by other philo-
sophical schools, particularly the
Advaita Vedanta school, which mini-
mized the value of ritual action and
claimed that final liberation came from
awareness alone.
Jnanamarga
(“Path of Realization”) One of
Hinduism’s three generally accepted
paths to gain final liberation of the soul,
along with the Path of Devotion (bhak-
timarga) and the Path of Action (kar-
mamarga). While the bhaktimarga
stresses devotion to God and the kar-
mamarga emphasizes selfless action in
the world, the jnanamarga stresses real-
izing the ultimate identity of one’s indi-
vidual Self (atman) and Ultimate Reality
(Brahman). This realization is usually
described as coming in a flash of insight,
which may take years of effort to attain
but which fundamentally shifts one’s
perspective on the world.
Jnana (“knowledge”) Mudra
A particular symbolic hand gesture
(mudra) in Indian dance, sculpture,
and ritual. In the jnana mudra, the tips
of the thumb and index finger are touch-
ing, with the palm and hand held across
the region of the heart. As its name
clearly shows, it is used to indicate a
profound understanding of the basic
workings of the universe.
Jnanasambandhar
Honorific epithet for the Nayanar poet-
saint Sambandar. See Sambandar.
Jnanendriya
(“organ of awareness”) In Indian philos-
ophy, jnanendriya refers to any of the
sense organs, traditionally considered to
be the eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and skin.
Jnaneshvar
(1275–1296?) Poet and saint who is the
first great figure in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community centered around
the worship of the Hindu god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur in the
modern
state
of
Maharashtra.
According to tradition, Jnaneshvar was
an outcaste brahmin. He incurred this
penalty because his father was a lapsed
ascetic—he left his wife to become an
ascetic, only to rejoin his family at his
guru’s command. Jnaneshvar came
from a very religious family: His sister
Muktibai is revered by the Varkaris in
her own right, and his elder brother
Nivrttinath is supposed to have been a
“spiritual grandson” of the great ascetic
Gorakhnath. Varkari tradition makes
clear that Jnaneshvar lived much of his
life in the town of Alandi, but the truth
of the accounts of many events associated
with his life is questionable—for exam-
ple, he is said to have caused a buffalo to
[[321]]
Jnaneshvari
recite the sacred text known as the Veda
in order to humble the pride of the local
brahmin priests. Jnaneshvar’s greatest
work was the Jnaneshvari, a Marathi-
language commentary on the Bhagavad
Gita, one of the most influential Hindu
religious texts. He is also famous for his
songs in praise of Vithoba, which the
Varkaris still sing today. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; and Justin Abbott and
Narhar R. Godbole (trans.), Stories of
Indian Saints, 1982.
Jnaneshvari
Marathi-language commentary on the
Bhagavad Gita, one of the most influen-
tial Hindu religious texts. The
Jnaneshvari was composed by the
Maharashtrian poet-saint Jnaneshvar,
whose intentions in writing it were to
make the Bhagavad Gita accessible to
the common people, who were not able
to read the text in the original Sanskrit,
and to give his own learned interpreta-
tion of the text’s contents. This emphasis
on giving ordinary people full access to
religious life was one of the consistent
themes in the (devotional) bhakti move-
ment and, like many other figures,
Jnaneshvar is reported to have faced
considerable opposition from the brah-
min priests, who thought that such
advanced teachings should not be
revealed to the common public.
Jogi
(variant of yogi, “adept”) An epithet for
various sorts of ascetics. It often refers
to the Nathpanthis, followers of the
teacher Gorakhnath. Their designation
as “jogis” comes from the fact that the
practice of yoga, particularly hatha
yoga, is one of the major emphases in
their religious life. The term may also
refer to the Aghoris.
Joking Relationships
Within the traditional Hindu joint family,
the types of relationships within a single
generation differ markedly according to
[[322]]

family status, particularly among the
family’s adult brothers and their wives.
As the eventual head of the family, the
oldest brother is usually portrayed as a
serious and grave authority figure,
toward whom everyone must act with
respect. The eldest brother’s wife is also
given considerable respect, but she is
also said to share a “joking relationship”
with her husband’s younger brothers, as
do all wives with their husband’s
younger brothers. Whereas women are
expected to behave decorously toward
relatives with higher status, joking rela-
tionships have much greater freedom of
expression. These are usually character-
ized as full of banter and casual conver-
sation that would be inappropriate with
a person of higher status.
Jones, Sir William
(1746–1794) Founder of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal and one of the fathers
of modern Indology. Jones came to
Calcutta from England in 1783 as a
Supreme Court judge during the gover-
norship of Warren Hastings, considered
one of the founders of the British
Empire in India. He was employed by
the East India Company, who, in its pur-
suit of trade and profit, acquired politi-
cal power over regions of India. Jones
immediately applied himself to the
study of Sanskrit, in part to discover the
particulars of traditional Hindu law,
since the East India Company’s general
policy was to allow different religious
communities to be governed by their
own traditional laws. Jones was a lin-
guistic genius who had mastered the
current and classical European lan-
guages, as well as Persian. He immedi-
ately recognized Sanskrit as a distant
relative of Greek and Latin, and through
his influence the serious study of
Sanskrit texts began. From a legal per-
spective, his most important work was a
translation of the laws of Manu (Manu
Smrti). This was one of the most impor-
tant texts in the dharma literature and
prescribed ideal rules and regulations
for all sorts of human conduct. ThisJuna (“Old”) Akhara
translation was intended to give the
British some idea of classical Hindu
law, but they failed to realize that
this text was composed not as a legal
manual but as a guide to religious
life. Jones died at age forty-eight from
an inflammation of the liver. His transla-
tion was published posthumously.
Joshimath
Town and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayas on the banks of the
Alakananda River, in the Chamoli
district of the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Joshimath is the location of the Jyotir
math, one of the four maths, or
dwelling places for ascetics, supposedly
established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The Jyotir math is
home to Dashanami Sanyasis, or twice-
born renunciant ascetics. According to
local legend, the Jyotir Math is the place
where Shankaracharya attained the ulti-
mate realization and composed his
commentaries on the Hindu scriptures.
Aside from the Jyotir math, Joshimath is
famous for its connection to a temple
dedicated to Narasimha, the god
Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar. This temple
was also reportedly established by
Shankaracharya and contains several
stunning sculptural images. Joshimath
is an important transit point on the
road to the temple at Badrinath, and
it is also the winter seat of Badrinath’s
presiding deity, where he (symbolically
represented by a traveling image)
resides and is worshiped during the
winter months, when Badrinath
becomes snowbound and inaccessible.
See also Narasimha avatar.
Juggernaut
Anglicized form of Jagannath, who is
the presiding deity of the temple with
the same name in the eastern Indian city
of Puri. The word “juggernaut,” which in
general English usage refers to anything
that requires blind devotion or horrible
sacrifice, comes from a widespread
myth surrounding the procession of
Jagannath, or Juggernaut, and his two
siblings around Puri during the Rath
Yatra each summer. The cars that carry
them in the procession are enormous—
Jagannath’s measures forty-five feet high
and thirty feet wide, and travels on six-
teen wheels that are seven feet high—
and are drawn by ropes pulled by
hundreds of people. One of the staple
fictions of British colonial lore described
Jagannath’s frenzied devotees (bhakta)
committing suicide by throwing them-
selves under the car’s wheels, in order to
die in the sight of the god. Despite the
legendary status of such stories, suicides
of this sort were in fact extremely
uncommon: most of those who died
under the wheels of the Juggernaut pro-
cession were pulling the ropes when
they lost their footing, fell into the cars’
path, and were prevented from escaping
by the crushing crowds.
Juna (“Old”) Akhara
Name of one of seven subgroups of the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant ascetics who are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Shiva. The sub-
groups are known as akharas and are
similar to regiments of an army. Until
the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Nagas were primarily mercenary sol-
diers but were also active in merchan-
dise trading; neither of these
characteristics applies in contemporary
times. Members of the Juna Akhara
revere the sage Dattatreya as their “tute-
lary deity,” the primary deity from
which they learn; each of the akharas
have different tutelary deities. Some
accounts say Bhairava was the patron
deity of the Juna Akhara in earlier times,
which would explain the fact that the
group is also known as the Bhairava
Akhara. The literal meaning of the pre-
sent name and its connection with
Bhairava imply that it is very old. In con-
temporary times it is a large organiza-
tion found only in northern India. In
some places it is given low status for
admitting members from the lower
social classes.
[[323]]
Jupiter
Up until the middle of the present cen-
tury, the Juna Akhara marched with the
Niranjani Akhara in the bathing (snana)
processions during the Kumbha Mela and
was thus considered a subsidiary part of
that akhara. For most of this century the
Junas were upset that they held subordi-
nate status despite the fact that they have
far more members than any other akhara.
The Junas began their attempt to gain the
status of a separate procession with the
[[1903]]
 Haridwar Kumbha Mela, but were
not accorded this position until 1962. The
akharas agreed that during a Haridwar
Kumbha Mela, the Junas would lead the
Sanyasi processions for the bathing on the
festival of Shivaratri. However, the
Niranjanis would be first for the other two
major bathing days—the new moon in
Chaitra and the Kumbha bath on April 14.
This arrangement broke down at the 1998
Kumbha Mela in Haridwar, when the Junas
demanded that they be allowed to go first
at the Chaitra bath as well, based on their
status as the largest akhara. On the day of
the second bath, this disagreement erupt-
ed into a full-scale riot between ascetic
groups and police in which many people
were hurt. There was great worry that such
violence would recur on the main bathing
day, but the day came off without incident
when the Juna Akhara boycotted the
bathing processions.
Jupiter
In Hindu astrology, a planet associated
with knowledge, power, and good charac-
ter. In Sanskrit, Jupiter’s name is guru,
and its importance in Hindu astrology
reflects the importance of the guru or reli-
gious figure in Hindu religious life. Jupiter
is the most powerful of the benevolent
planets—the others are the sun, moon,
Mercury, and Venus—although for each
person Jupiter’s powers vary according to
its place in the natal horoscope, or align-
ment of the heavenly bodies at the time of
birth, and the influence of friendly or
hostile planets. During the week, Jupiter
presides over Thursday which, because of
the planet’s astrological powers, is consid-
ered an auspicious, or lucky, day.
[[324]]

Jutha
In its most general sense, jutha refers
to any food that has come into contact
with saliva. Such contact is believed to ren-
der that food impure and unfit
for anyone else to eat. Since eating is tradi-
tionally done with one’s fingers, any food
on one’s plate after one has begun to eat is
considered contaminated by association,
even if it has not yet been taken into one’s
mouth. As with all bodily fluids, saliva is
considered particularly impure, a sub-
stance that “imprints” food with the nature
of the person eating it. Eating food from
the same plate is a sign of extreme close-
ness—most commonly done by husband
and wife, but also by very close friends.
Conversely, eating another’s person’s left-
overs is a sign of extreme status differ-
ence—it is done only by people who are
desperately poor, by disciples as a sign of
devotion to their guru or religious leader,
or by devotees (bhakta) receiving prasad
or sanctified food, the vehicle for grace
from their chosen deity.
Jwalamukhi
(“flame mouth”) Presiding deity of the
Jwalamukhi shrine in the state of
Himachal Pradesh, and one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses. According to the site’s
mythic charter, Jwalamukhi is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites sacred to
the goddess that spreads throughout the
Indian subcontinent. Each Shakti Pitha
marks the site where a body part of the dis-
membered goddess Sati fell to earth, tak-
ing form there as a different goddess; in the
case of Jwalamukhi the body part was Sati’s
tongue. The human tongue is an extreme-
ly powerful part of the body—connected
with speech, eating, and sex—and thus
Jwalamukhi is considered a very powerful
shrine. The cave containing the shrine has
a small vent of natural gas, which has been
lit for as long as people can remember. This
flame is believed to be a self-manifested
(svayambhu) form of the Goddess, here in
the form of her tongue. For further infor-
mation see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986; and Kathleen Erndl,
Victory To The Mother, 1993. See also pitha.Jyotirlinga
The Mahakaleshvar Temple in the city of Ujjain. This site contains one of the twelve jyotirlingas,
pillar-shaped images that mark places where the god Shiva is believed to have appeared in a shaft of light.
Jyeshth
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Jyeshth is the third month
in the lunar year, usually falling in
May–June. This is considered the first

Jyotirlinga
(“linga of light”) In several different
mythic sources, the first manifestation
of the god Shiva is described as a giant
[[325]]
Jyotir Math
pillar of fire, which stretches above the
heavens and below the earth. The gods
Brahma and Vishnu try to find this pil-
lar’s top and bottom but cannot. When
they admit their failure, the figure of
Shiva emerges from the pillar of light
and blesses them. Shiva’s devotees
(bhakta) believe that there are twelve
sites in India where this jyotirlinga came
down to earth; these twelve sites are
deemed extraordinarily holy, and at
each of them Shiva is believed to be
uniquely present. At each of these sites
the primary image is a linga, the pillar-
shaped image that is a symbolic form of
Shiva. Each of these lingas is considered
a different manifestation of Shiva, and
these twelve sites each take the name of
the linga that is their presiding deity.
The other eleven manifestations of
Shiva and their locations are: Somnath
and Nageshvar in the state of Gujarat;
Kedarnath in the Himalaya Mountains;
Vishvanath in the city of Benares;
Vaidyanath in the state of Bihar;
Mahakaleshvar in the central Indian
city of Ujjain; Omkareshvar in the state
of Madhya Pradesh; Bhimashankar,
Ghrneshvar, and Tryambakeshvar in
the state of Maharashtra; and
Rameshvar in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Jyotir Math
One of the four maths or sacred centers
traditionally believed to have been
established by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya; the others are the
Sharada math, Shringeri math, and
Govardhan math. These four sacred
centers are each associated with one of
the four geographical corners of the
Indian subcontinent; the Jyotir math is
in the northern quarter, in the town of
Joshimath in the state of Uttar Pradesh,
high in the Himalaya Mountains.
Shankaracharya is traditionally cited as
the founder of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
the most prestigious Hindu ascetic
order. The Dashanami (“ten names”)
ascetics are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva and are separated into ten divi-
sions, each with a different name. These
[[326]]

ten divisions are organized into four
larger groups—Anandawara, Bhogawara,
Bhuriwara, and Kitawara—each of which
has two or three of the ten divisions, and
each of which is associated with one of the
four sacred centers. Of these, the Jyotir
math is associated with the Anandawara
group of the Dashanamis.
Jyotisha
In its most general usage, the word
jyotisha refers to astrology. The word
itself is derived from jyotis (“light,” and
by extension the heavenly bodies) and is
concerned with the movement of the
celestial bodies, their varying configura-
tions, and the divisions of time that are
derived from them. This attention to the
heavens is a very old cultural concern,
for jyotisha is one of the six Vedangas,
the auxiliary branches of knowledge
connected with the sacred scriptures
known as the Vedas. As one of the
Vedangas, jyotisha was concerned with
identifying appropriate days and times
to perform Vedic sacrifices.
Even in modern times, many tradi-
tional Hindus take astrology very seri-
ously, based on the assumption that the
results of one’s previous karma lead one
to be born at a particular moment. One’s
natal horoscope, or the positioning of
the celestial bodies at the time of birth,
thus provides a karmic “itinerary” indi-
cating where one has been and what one
might expect in the future. People fre-
quently consider astrology when mak-
ing important decisions, particularly in
arranging marriages—to determine the
couple’s compatibility, to see whether
any trouble is lurking ahead, and to
arrange an auspicious or lucky time for
the ceremony itself. In the same way,
some Hindus will consult an astrologer
before beginning any important under-
taking, to be sure that the work will
begin at an auspicious time and will
therefore be more likely to succeed.
The basic principles of Indian astrol-
ogy are very similar to those of Western
astrology. The zodiac signs are nearly
identical. However, the two systemsJyotisha
have a different method for determining
each sign’s starting point, causing some
discrepancies between the two systems.
Aside from the sun, moon, and five visi-
ble planets in Western astrology, Indian
astrology has two additional planets,
Rahu and Ketu, which are both consid-
ered inauspicious and malevolent. In
addition to the twelve signs of the solar
zodiac, Indian astrology also has a lunar
zodiac with twenty-seven “lunar man-
sions” (nakshatras), each of which has
particular qualities. Although at the
most basic level astrological reckoning
is fairly simple, it can quickly become
highly complex and is thus generally left
to professional astrologers. This is still a
viable profession throughout much of
India, since the generally accepted
belief that some times are auspicious
and others inauspicious means that
ordinary people will hire specialists to
keep them informed of these times.
