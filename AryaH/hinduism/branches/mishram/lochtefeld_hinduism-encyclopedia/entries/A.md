Abhang
(“unbroken”) Poetic form characteristi-
cally used by the saint-poets of the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba. Each abhang is usu-
ally made up of four lines, with an abbc
rhyme scheme. Although each abhang is
a complete poem in its own right, they
are often strung together in groups, to
create either a longer narrative poem (in
which each abhang stands as one
segment) or a group of poems devoted
to a common theme. Such versatility
made it one of the dominant poetic
forms in the Marathi language, just as
the doha form is ubiquitous to medieval
and modern Hindi.
Abhava
(“[knowledge from] absence”) Abhava is
one of the two means of valid knowledge
(pramana) unique to the Purva
Mimamsa school of philosophy, the
other being presumption (arthapatti). All
Indian philosophical schools concern
themselves with codifying pramanas,
that is, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate knowl-
edge. Behind this concern lies the basic
Hindu religious goal of learning to live,
act, and think in a way that leads to the
final liberation of the soul from the cycle
of reincarnation (samsara). Almost all
schools accept perception (pratyaksha),
inference (anumana), and authoritative
testimony (shabda) as pramanas. The
Purva Mimamsa school claims that
abhava, or perception of the absence of
something (“there is no jug in this room”),
is a means of knowledge that cannot be
accounted for by the other pramanas.
Abhaya Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta) in which
the hand is held with the palm facing
out, with the fingers together and point-
ing upward. The word abhaya means
“without fear,” and the gesture is meant
to reassure the viewer that all will be
well. This hand gesture can be found in
most depictions of the Hindu gods and
goddesses, particularly when the deity
in question has multiple hands.
Abhijnanashakuntala
(“Recognition of Shakuntala”) Drama
written by Kalidasa (5th c. C.E.), who is
widely considered the greatest classical
Sanskrit poet. The Abhijnanashakuntala
describes the trials and troubles of the
mythical heroine Shakuntala and is con-
sidered Kalidasa’s greatest drama. In the
story, Shakuntala, the daughter of the
sage Vishvamitra and the celestial
nymph Menaka, attracts the eye of
King Dushyanta while he is away from
his kingdom on a hunting trip.
Shakuntala and Dushyanta marry by
mutual consent, in what is known as a
gandharva marriage. After their mar-
riage, Dushyanta returns to his king-
dom. Shakuntala remains at her home
and has the misfortune to irritate the
sage Durvasas, who curses her to be
forgotten by her beloved. Shakuntala
pleads with Durvasas, who is moved to
mitigate the curse such that
Dushyanta will remember everything
if Shakuntala can show Dushyanta a
sign of their union. Dushyanta had
given Shakuntala his signet ring, but
she loses it before she can see him.
Denied by Dushyanta, Shakuntala
endures numerous trials until she
finds the ring in the belly of a fish.
When Dushyanta sees the ring, he
immediately recognizes Shakuntala
(hence the play’s name), and they live
happily ever after.
The Abhijnanashakuntala has two
features that characterize most classical
Sanskrit plays. One is the preference for
a happy ending, although this resolution

Abhimanyu
Dancers performing in the Kathak style. Most Kathak performances include dances in the abhinaya genre,
in which performers use dance to act out a story from religious literature.
is usually preceded by trial and tribula-
tion. The other is that the drama’s
dialogue is in two different languages.
Characters from the higher classes
speak Sanskrit, the language of high,
learned culture. Characters from the
lower classes (including many of the
women) speak in Prakrit, an umbrella
term for the grammatically simpler
vernacular languages that developed
from Sanskrit through natural linguistic
change. This difference in dialogue
doubtless reflected the social realities of
the time in which the play was written,
when Sanskrit would have been the elite
language but was always learned as a
second language after learning one’s
[[2]]

“natural” language. The play has been
translated into English by Michael
Coulson and published in an anthology
titled Three Sanskrit Plays, 1981.
Abhimanyu
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Abhimanyu is one of
Arjuna’s sons by his wife, Subhadra.
Abhimanyu is known as a great warrior
who fights with valor in the
Mahabharata war. As he fights in battle,
he enters the enemy’s chakravyuha
formation, a battle array that is widely
believed to be virtually impenetrable.
According to tradition, Arjuna is one of
the few people who knows how toAbortion
counter the chakravyuha. While
Abhimanyu was in his mother’s womb,
he heard his father describe how to
penetrate it. Once Abhimanyu is in,
however, he realizes that he does not
know how to get out, and although he
kills a great number of the enemy, he is
eventually slain.
Abhinavagupta
(10th c. C.E.) Kashmiri writer famous
for his works on poetics and aesthet-
ics. Abhinavagupta was a pivotal figure
in the development of Trika Shaivism,
a particular religious community
devoted to the god Shiva. The writer’s
most famous religious work is the
Tantraloka, a twelve-volume work elu-
cidating the metaphysics and ritual of
Trika Shaivism. His Dhvanyaloka gives
similar attention to aesthetics and
poetics. See also Kashmir and Shaiva.
Abhinaya
(“bringing near”) In Indian drama, the
general name given to acting. Its ulti-
mate purpose is to convey an emotion
through a look or gesture and thus
“bring” it to the audience. In Indian
dance, this term refers to a piece in
which the dancer acts out a story, with
the aim to convey to the viewers the
emotions of her character. Particularly
with Indian dance, this sort of acting is
not mere artistry, however refined, but
carries explicit religious meaning. Not
only is the story’s content often drawn
from religious literature, but most
Indian dance forms were first per-
formed in temples as entertainment
for the resident deity.
Abhira
Sanskrit term for Ahir. See Ahir.
Abhisheka
(“anointing”) Ritual bathing (snana) or
anointing with water, particularly of
the image of a deity during worship. In
earlier times this term referred to the
ritual anointing of a king at his corona-
tion (rajabhiseka). In modern times
the term can also apply to anointing or
sprinkling individuals with water dur-
ing religious or life cycle rituals, partic-
ularly rites of initiation (diksha)
involving a change of status for the ini-
tiate—such as the shift from house-
holder to initiated ascetic or in the
ritual tradition known as tantra, an
initiation bestowing certain ritual and
religious qualifications (adhikara). In
both cases the anointing is intended to
honor the initiate, to evoke images of
royal coronation, and to suggest the
importance of the occasion.
Abortion
Hindu views toward abortion have
varied widely over the course of time.
It is unequivocally condemned in the
dharma literature, which prescribes
loss of caste for a person procuring an
abortion or for a woman having one.
This prescription may have been
based on the use of abortion to con-
ceal illegitimate births, but it may well
have been condemned because it
entailed the loss of a potential son.
In modern times attitudes have
changed somewhat, in part because of
family planning initiatives and in
more recent times because of the
technology available for sex determi-
nation. Abortion facilities are now
more widely available in India due to
the government’s emphasis on family
planning and population control, and
there is less social stigma associated
with the procedure. However, tradi-
tional proscriptions remain. With the
advent of methods for prenatal sex
determination, couples began selec-
tively aborting female fetuses because
sons are more highly valued in Hindu
society. This practice was widespread
and generated such concern that it
was outlawed in 1995, although the
law has reportedly only succeeded in
driving this practice underground.

Achala Ekadashi
Achala Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half of
the lunar month of Jyeshth
(May–June). As are all of the eleventh-
day observances, this is dedicated to
the worship of the god Vishnu. The
name Achala means “immovable”;
another name for this ekadashi is
apara, meaning “matchless.” The
name refers to the religious merit gen-
erated by observing this festival,
which, according to tradition, cannot
be nullified or overturned. Most Hindu
festivals have certain prescribed rites,
usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise spe-
cific benefits for faithful performance.
Individual observance varies depend-
ing on a person’s piety and inclina-
tions. Fasting, for instance, can vary
from abstaining only from certain
foods to refraining from all foods dur-
ing the day. Individuals may go to tem-
ples for worship, or they may worship
in their homes. Faithfully observing
this festival is believed to absolve one
of the evil effects of one’s past deeds,
particularly deeds that would result in
birth as a pret, or unquiet spirit, and
also to increase one’s fame, wealth,
and religious merit.
Achamana
(“sipping”) The act of sipping water that
has been poured or scooped into one’s
right hand. This is performed as a rite of
purification. Achamana is a symbolic
action that has been incorporated into
many religious rituals. It is also part of
the required early morning ablutions,
the purpose of which is to remove any
impurity (ashaucha) encountered while
sleeping. In the Hindu tradition, human
beings are considered impure upon
waking for a number of reasons. Since
sleep entails loss of consciousness, one
may not know whether one has come
into contact with impurity. Further, bod-
ily functions that may occur while sleep-
ing cause impurity. In addition, it is
popularly believed that one’s soul
[[4]]

(atman) leaves the body during sleep
and then reenters it before the body
awakens. While the soul is gone, the
body is believed to be a corpse, which is
an impurity that must be cleansed.
Achamaniya
(“to be sipped”) The fifth of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship, on
the model of treating the god as an hon-
ored guest. In this upachara, the deity is
offered water for rinsing and cleaning
the mouth. The actual act of offering can
be done in various ways and often
depends on the worshiper’s inclinations.
In some cases the water vessel will sim-
ply be presented before the deity’s
image, with the understanding that the
water has been taken, whereas in other
cases the devotee (bhakta) will actually
rinse the image’s mouth. In either case
the underlying motive is to show love for
the deity and to minister to its needs.
Achara
(“conduct”) Appropriate or approved
behavior according to customary law,
which is established in the dharma lit-
erature. The dharma assumes that soci-
ety is made up of different social
subgroups known as jatis, which are
usually defined (and hierarchically
arranged) by the group’s hereditary
occupation. Each jati had its own cus-
tomary code of appropriate behavior,
and there were often sharp differences
between them. For example, it was often
acceptable for members of lower-status
jatis to eat meat and drink liquor,
whereas these practices were forbidden
to higher-status groups. Aside from the
customary rules of one’s social group or
subgroup, notions of appropriate
behavior for a particular person would
also be shaped by age and gender con-
siderations: A young and sexually fertile
woman would be subject to far greater
restrictions than a postmenopausal
woman, since any sexual scandal (or
even the hint of it) could ruin a youngAct of Truth
woman’s opportunities for a good mar-
riage or produce an illegitimate child.
Acharya
Traditional term of respect for a
religious leader or a spiritual teacher;
the word connotes great learning as
well as a religious life. The term
literally means someone who knows
or teaches about achara, the
traditionally accepted way of life
prescribed in the dharma literature.
As a title in modern Hindu life, it indi-
cates the respect and social standing
conveyed by the English word doctor.
Achintyabhedabheda
(“inconceivable identity and differ-
ence”) Key philosophical concept of the
Gaudiya Vaishnava school, which was
founded by the Bengali saint Chaitanya
(d. 1533) and is devoted to the worship
of Krishna as the Supreme Being. The
concept was first enunciated by
Chaitanya’s disciple Jiva Goswami (late
[[16]]
th c.) and explains the relationship
between God (Krishna) and the human
soul, and between God and his divine
powers. In both cases these relation-
ships are described as simultaneously
involving sameness and difference. On
one hand, human souls are clearly dif-
ferent from God, as shown by their
imperfections and their susceptibility
to the action of karma, both of which
contrast with God’s utter transcen-
dence and perfection. Yet since it is
possible for human souls to gain ulti-
mate liberation (moksha) from the
action of karma, they must also share
some part of God’s nature, since liber-
ation would be impossible if human
souls were completely different. Even
though human souls partake in the
divine nature, their distinctness is
upheld even after liberation, when the
human soul does not merge with
Krishna but remains separate.
This same concept is used to
describe the second relationship,
between God and his divine powers.
The divine powers are often conceived
not just as attributes (e.g., the ability
to create, preserve, and destroy the
universe) but as actual embodied
deities, particularly in the form of
goddesses. These powers are both the
same as God, since they come from
Him, but also different since each of
the embodied powers does not con-
tain the glory of the whole. In both
cases the precise nature of this simul-
taneous identity and difference is
“inconceivable,” which here carries a
mystical sense. For further informa-
tion see Sushil Kumar De, Early History
of the Vaishnava Faith and Movement
in Bengal, from Sanskrit and Bengali
Sources, 1961.
Achyuta
(“imperishable”) Epithet of Vishnu,
referring to the devotees’ (bhakta)
beliefs that nothing can stand against
Vishnu and that his power will never
wane. Hindu deities often have many
names that sometimes denote unique
form of the deity and at other times
denote a special quality of the deity.
No two deities will ever share the same
epithet. The proliferation of names for
deities may be related in part to the
characteristics of the Sanskrit lan-
guage, which is rich with synonyms.
This allows words to fit into various
poetic meters. See Vishnu.
Act of Truth
In Hindu mythology, a ritual action that
is described as being able to neutralize
poison, bring rain, make a river flow
backward, or even compel the gods to
grant one’s wishes. The act of truth
draws its effectiveness from the power
of truth and is usually performed as a
last resort when all other avenues have
been blocked. The act of truth is a con-
ditional statement: the first part is a true
statement about one’s past behavior, the
second part a request for some specific
result (“If I have always given to those
who begged from me, may this fire not
[[5]]
Adharma
burn me”). The rite’s success stems from
the truthfulness of the first condition—
that the power of truth in the condition
actually causes the second part to come
true. One example of the act of truth
being used to compel the gods to grant a
wish occurs in the story of the lovers
Nala and Damayanti. Damayanti
intends to choose Nala as her husband
but finds that four of the gods have
taken Nala’s form, in an effort to foil her.
Damayanti’s act of truth affirms that she
had chosen Nala as her husband and
has never wavered in this choice, and it
then directs the gods to take their true
forms again. The gods take their true
forms, and Nala and Damayanti are
married.
As Sanskritist and Indologist W.
Norman Brown observes, in cases
where the act of truth is successful, the
people making the act of truth have
perfectly fulfilled their social roles,
and this perfection allows them to
make the conditional affirmation so
central to the act of truth. Successful
men have been either great kings,
ascetics, or householders; successful
women have usually been absolutely
faithful to their husbands (fulfilling
one idealized women’s role). One story
tells of a prostitute who affirmed that she
had serviced all of her clients without par-
tiality, thus perfectly fulfilling her particu-
lar social role. In any of these cases,
perfection of one’s role is believed to bring
spiritual merit as well as the ability to
unleash it by performing the act of truth.
For further information see W. Norman
Brown, “The Metaphysics of the Truth
Act,” in Mélanges D'Indianisme à la
Mémoire de Louis Renou, 1968.
Adharma
In the dharma literature, this term
designates the absolute opposite of
dharma, the fundamental values that
serve to uphold society. Although adhar-
ma can denote a particular unrighteous
action, it more widely implies a state of
affairs in which society has been com-
pletely corrupted; the values that
[[6]]

uphold society have been subverted,
overturned, or ignored and hence such
particular unrighteous actions become
possible, even likely.
Adhikamasa
See Intercalary Month.
Adhikara
(“qualification”) In any sort of Hindu
worship, but particularly in tantra,
adhikara indicates that one has the reli-
gious qualifications to perform certain
ritual actions. This refers partly to know-
ing how to perform the ritual, and thus
being “qualified” in that sense of the
word. More importantly, it refers to hav-
ing gained the ritual status that entitles
one to perform the ritual. This status is
usually conferred by some sort of formal
initiation or initiations given by one’s
teacher, who decides what type of and
how much adhikara to transmit based
on an assessment of the student’s abili-
ties, temperament, and desire to learn.
Adhiratha
The foster father of Karna in the great
Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Karna is
born when his mother, Kunti, uses a
special mantra given to her by the sage
Durvasas, which gives a woman the
power to conceive and bear children by
the gods. Kunti impulsively uses the
mantra to invoke the Sun, by whom she
conceives and bears Karna. In her panic
at unexpectedly becoming a mother—
she is still unmarried, and concerned
about what people might think—she
puts the child in a box and abandons him
in the Ganges. When Adhiratha goes to
the Ganges to bathe (snana), he finds the
child, and since he and his wife are child-
less, they raise the boy as their own.
There are a number of interesting
aspects to the story of Adhiratha.
Although he is not of high status, he
becomes the king of the country. He
comes from a social group whose tra-
ditional occupation is driving chariots.Adhyasa
The Shri Channakeshara temple in Somnathpur, India. A traditional feature of Hindu temple
architecture is the adhishthana, a raised base upon which the temple is built.
One can read this dissonance in the
epic’s recognition that the hierarchical,
occupationally based social model is an
idealized projection and not always the
reality. It can also be argued that since
Adhiratha is not fulfilling his particular
religious duty (dharma) but has
usurped that of the ruling class, both he
and the country are destined for ruin.
The reality of his family’s lowly status
and the uncertainty about his birth
trouble Karna for most of his life.
Adhishthana
(“foundation”) In Hindu temple archi-
tecture, the raised base on which a tem-
ple was built. These are particularly high
in the temples at Khajuraho, and their
height accentuates the upward thrust of
these temples. Whether high or low, the
adhishthana is important as the temple’s
foundation, the stable base on which all
else rests.
Adhvaryum
A type of sacrificial priest described in
the Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands of the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire—and the care and attention
devoted to detailing these sacrifices,
which leads to the inference that these
were the primary religious acts. These
rites were so complex that they
required specialized ritual techni-
cians: the adhvaryum, the hotr, the
udgatr, and the brahman. The
adhvaryum was the sacrificial priest
who chanted the hymns from the
Yajur Veda that were used in the sacri-
fice. He was also responsible for
preparing the sacred altar, assembling
the sacrificial materials, kindling and
feeding the sacred fire, and actually
offering the sacrificial animals.
Adhyasa
(“superimposition”) In Advaita Vedanta,
one of the six schools of classical Indian
philosophy, this is a key concept used to
explain the ultimate unreality of the
world around us, despite its apparent
[[7]]
Adi
reality. For the Advaita Vedanta school,
there is ultimately only one real idea in
the universe, namely Brahman. All
things are in fact that one thing, and this
never changes. Since Brahman is the
all in all, it can never actually be an
object of perception (pratyaksha). What
the Advaitins then have to explain
is how things in the world apparently
change, or seem diverse and different.
This is explained as stemming from
our mistaken perception and under-
standing. They call this notion
adhyasa, which is rooted in the human
tendency to “construct” a picture of
world. According to this explanation,
human beings superimpose a false
understanding (that reality is diverse
and differentiated) on top of the correct
understanding (that all reality is nothing
but
undifferentiated
Brahman).
According to the Advaitins, the world is
real because Brahman is real. What is
not real is the world as most unenlight-
ened people perceive it.
Advaitins illustrate this concept by
two well-known errors in judgment: the
case of a rope that one briefly mistakes
for a snake, or a post that one imagines
is a man. Although these judgments are
erroneous—as one quickly discovers—
they are not made up out of nothing. In
each case, one is perceiving something
real—the rope and post both actually
exist—but “superimposing” a different
and mistaken identity on these things,
and thus “transforming” them into
something they are not. In the same
way, it is argued, human consciousness
begins with the Supreme Reality
(Brahman), which is actually there, but
superimposes onto it something which
is not (the judgment of a diverse world).
According to the Advaitins, the real
problem is epistemological, that is, how
human beings come to know things,
rather than in the nature of the things
themselves. One comes to a true
understanding not when the things
themselves change—to refer back to the
example, the rope always was and
always will be a rope—but with the
destruction of the mistaken notions that
[[8]]

led to the initial error, and their
replacement by true understanding.
For the Advaitins, adhyasa is a
manifestation of avidya (lack of true
knowledge); this avidya is reinforced
and upheld by the karmic power of
one’s mistaken thoughts and actions.
Adhyasa immediately disappears at the
moment true understanding is gained,
when one comprehends that the world
(and oneself ) are both nothing but
Brahman. This moment of realization
brings ultimate wisdom that can never
be lost, just as that once one has
recognized the piece of rope, it can
never again become a snake. For further
information see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara and
His Pupils, 1981; and Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore
(eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Adi
Fourth month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian
solar month of Karkata (the zodiacal
sign of Cancer), which usually falls
within July and August. The existence of
several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by
preserving their traditional calendar.
Tamil is one of the few regional
languages in India with an ancient,
well-established literary tradition. See
also Tamil months, Tamil Nadu, and
Tamil language.
Adigranth
(“Primal Book”) One of the names for
the Sikh scripture, most often used by
people outside the tradition. Sikhs
themselves are more likely to use the
honorific title Shri Guru Granth Sahib,
which reflects the scripture’s status as
the spiritual leader (guru) of the Sikh
community. This status was conferred
by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh
(d. 1708), who proclaimed that after hisAditi
death the community would have no
more human leaders, but only their
scripture to guide them. The book’s reli-
gious authority can be seen in the way
that the Sikhs treat it. They accord the
Adigranth the status of a living person.
In Sikh temples the Adigranth is cere-
monially put to bed at night and woken
up in the morning. It is enshrined under
a canopy (a sign of royalty) for worship,
is fanned during hot weather and
warmed during cold, and if it has to be
taken anywhere, is carried on the bear-
er’s head, considered the purest part of
the body. In according this respectful
treatment to a physical book, the Sikhs
were probably influenced by Muslim
practice with regard to the Qur’an, since
in general Hindus pay little heed to a
book itself, however important the text
may be.
The Adigranth plays a central role in
Sikh life: Children are named by opening
the book at random and taking the first
consonant on the upper-left-hand page
as the first letter of the child’s name; Sikh
couples are married by circling the
book, as Hindu couples circle the
sacred fire (agnipradakshinam), and a
commonly performed death rite is an
unbroken reading (akhand path) of the
entire text.
The text itself was compiled in
[[1603]]
–1604 by Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh
guru. According to tradition he com-
piled the book in response to certain
rivals contesting his authority, some of
whom had compiled and were circulat-
ing books purporting to be the teachings
of Guru Nanak, the Sikhs’ founder and
first guru. There may be some truth in
this tradition, but it is now well estab-
lished that Arjan himself was working
from a compilation made a generation
before. The text’s opening verses are
known as the mul mantra, which gives a
collection of attributes and qualities
ascribed to the Supreme Being. After
this opening, the Adigranth has
three main parts. The first is the Japji,
a sequence of thirty-eight poems
written by Guru Nanak that is
considered the essence of the Sikh faith,
and which is recited by the faithful as
the morning prayer.
The second section contains the
hymns of the Sikh gurus, arranged by
raga, or melodic mode. Within each raga
the hymns are arranged according to
poetic meter, and within each meter the
hymns are arranged sequentially accord-
ing to which of the gurus composed
them. Since the Sikh tradition holds that
all ten gurus contained the same divine
spirit, they all identified themselves as
“Nanak.” But introductions to the songs
differentiate between them by calling
them Mahala (literally “house,” but figu-
ratively “body”) followed by a number—
from Mahala 1 for Guru Nanak to Mahala
[[5]]
 for Guru Arjan.
The final section of the Adigranth
contains hymns by various other devo-
tees (bhakta), both Hindu and Muslim,
whom the Sikh gurus believed to
be propounding the essential Sikh
message of monotheism and the need
to serve God. Among the Hindu
devotional (bhakti) poets whose works
can be found in this section are
Trilochan, Jayadeva, Pipa, Ramananda,
Sen, Namdev, Kabir, and Ravidas, with
significant collections for the last three.
Even for those not interested in the
Sikhs, this last section makes the
Adigranth an extremely important
document. Not only does this section
provide manuscript tradition that can
be precisely and accurately dated, but
the sacred status of the text has ensured
that it has remained unchanged since
the beginning of the seventeenth cen-
tury. Many other manuscript sources
for these poets are far more recent and
are made problematic by textual cor-
ruption and pseudonymous additions.
Adishesha
(“Primal Shesha”) Epithet of Shesha.

Aditi
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
the sage Kashyapa, who also married
[[9]]
Aditya
Adivasi man going to the market. The Adivasis consist of different tribal groups that are
settled throughout the forest and hill regions of India.
Aditi’s twelve sisters and through them
begat all living creatures. Aditi is first
mentioned in the Rg Veda, where she is
one of the few female figures, although a
minor one. The epic Mahabharata
describes her as giving birth to twelve
divine sons, the Adityas: Dhata,
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (Indra), Varuna,
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (Surya),
Pushan, Savitr (Surya), Tvashtr, and
Vishnu. Both Hindu epics, the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana, also
describe how Aditi gave birth to the
Vamana avatar, that is, the “divine
descent” of the god Vishnu, in his form
as a dwarf.
Aditya
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, a
group of twelve divine sons born to the
sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, from
whom these sons get their collective
name. The twelve are named Dhata,
Aryama, Mitra, Shakra (Indra), Varuna,
Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan (Surya),
Pushan, Savitr, Tvashtr, and Vishnu.
Several of these deities are important
figures in the religious scriptures known
[[10]]

as the Vedas, and Vishnu later gained
prominence as one of the primary
Hindu gods. On one hand, the Adityas
illustrate the Hindu concept that the
divine beings (devas) have many simi-
larities to humans, although they are
more powerful and live in a different
world, the heavens. On the other hand,
they also demonstrate how the Hindu
tradition changes over time. Among the
Adityas, Vishnu is one of a number of
divine beings who are all subject to
birth, death, and the operation of
karma, whereas in his later aspect as the
Supreme Being, he is considered not
only to be beyond all these forces, but to
wield control over them.
The twelve Adityas are the sun in
the twelve months of the year. In at
least one of the Puranas these twelve
Adityas are each connected with a
particular sign of the zodiac.
Adivasi
(“first inhabitant”) General term for
different groups of tribal peoples.
They are usually associated with
forests and other less developedAdultery
areas, often making their living by
hunting, woodcutting, gathering
honey and medicinal plants, and
through subsistence agriculture. The
largest concentrations are in Orissa,
Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar, on both
sides of the Vindhya Mountains sep-
arating northern and southern India,
but they are also found in regions
such as the Nilgiri Hills in southern
India. Adivasis are still largely unas-
similated into caste Hinduism. Many
are illiterate and desperately poor,
despite programs giving them reser-
vations for higher education and gov-
ernment employment. In recent years
they have been the focus of intense
missionary activity by both Christians
and Hindu missionaries sponsored by
the Vishva Hindu Parishad.
Adoption
One of the most important requirements
for every Hindu male is to have at least
one son, so that the funeral rites for him-
self and for his ancestors will be correctly
performed and maintained. These rites
are considered central for the well-being
of the dead, particularly the recently
departed. Even in modern times, only
men are allowed to perform funeral rites.
Given the importance of these cere-
monies, men with no biological sons
adopt a son to guarantee the performance
of the ceremony. The ideal candidate is a
blood relative, such as a brother’s son, who
is of equal social status with the adoptive
father. Through adoption the boy
becomes a member of another family, but
the legal texts disagree on his continuing
relationship with his natal family. Many
sources claim that an adopted son has no
right to the inheritance of his natal family
and no entitlement to offer funeral rites
for those ancestors, since by adoption he
has become part of another family. Other
texts speak of special arrangements by
which an adopted son is considered to
have two fathers, one biological, one
adopted. He inherits from, and performs
ancestral rites for both fathers.
Adultery
Given the traditional Hindu belief that
women are the vessels and guardians of
family status, rules about adultery out-
lined in the dharma literature are
mostly concerned with the conduct of
women, although these texts do pre-
scribe a penance (prayashchitta) for a
man who commits adultery with
another man’s wife. As outlined in the
dharma literature, adultery is much
more serious for women. It is notable
that in most cases the dharma does not
recommend the woman be driven from
her home. An adulterous woman is to
perform a rigorous penance until her
next menstrual period—sleeping on the
ground, wearing dirty clothes, and get-
ting very little food; during this time she
also loses her status as a lady of the
house and whatever domestic authority
she may have wielded. According to the
dharma literature, all of this is to end
with a bath at the end of her menstrual
period, after which she is accepted back
at her former status. Women who con-
ceive as a result of adulterous liaisons
are to be abandoned. In practice this
often means being secluded and cut off
from the family, although she still
receives food. Abandonment is also rec-
ommended in certain other cases: in
adulterous liaisons with a man’s student
or his guru, if a woman attempts to kill
her husband, or if she kills her fetus. The
reluctance to completely cast a woman
away, and the willingness to bring her
back to her former status after doing
penance, both reflect the importance of
marriage and family life in Hindu cul-
ture, as well as women’s importance in
the family.
Although these prescriptions in the
dharma literature seem relatively
humane, often there has been a consid-
erable difference between these pre-
scriptions and a particular group’s
actual practice. In general, the higher
the group’s social status (or the more a
group is trying to improve its social sta-
tus), the more harshly it treats such
infractions, since these infractions
[[11]]
Advaita Vedanta
injure its social standing. At present this
disjunction is also affected by the differ-
ing attitudes toward sexuality between
rural and urban contexts, with the latter
tending to be more permissive and the
former far more restrictive. These differ-
ences are illustrated by occasional
reports of adulterous women being
killed to restore the family’s honor; this
far exceeds even the harshest penalty
prescribed in the dharma literature.
Advaita Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the Vedas.
The Advaita school upholds a philo-
sophical position known as monism,
which is the belief that a single Ultimate
Reality lies behind all things. Advaita
proponents believe that reality is non-
dual (advaita)—that is, that everything
in the world is actually the formless,
unqualified Brahman, despite the
appearance of difference and diversity.
To support this claim, the Advaitins pro-
vide a convincing explanation for the
world one perceives to have many sepa-
rate and diverse things.
Advaitans account for this apparent
diversity by using the concept of
adhyasa (superimposition), in which a
false, mistaken understanding is pro-
jected upon a real object—in the classi-
cal Advaita example, seeing a rope in the
twilight and mistaking it for a snake. For
the Advaitins, the “snake” is not com-
pletely unreal, since it depends on the
rope for its existence—one cannot see
the snake unless the rope is there. At the
same time, the “snake” is clearly not real
since one does not persist in this error,
and once the illusion of the snake has
been dispelled, one can no longer see it.
In the same way, the Advaitins
believe that our idea of the phenomenal
everyday world is projected upon the
one thing in the universe that is truly
real—Brahman. Like the snake, the
world is unreal as it is perceived but real
insofar as it depends on Brahman. For
[[12]]

the Advaitins, the roots of adhyasa are
epistemological, that is, related to how
human beings come to know things, but
the results of adhyasa are both epistemo-
logical and ontological (related to how
things actually are). On one hand,
adhyasa obscures the Ultimate Reality
and prevents one from accurately per-
ceiving it, and on the other, its projective
character creates our notions of the
world. For the Advaitins, the source of all
this confusion is ultimately rooted in
avidya, or primal ignorance, under the
influence of which one forms mistaken
ideas about the world. The operation of
this ignorance is said to have no begin-
ning, but one of the things that keeps it
going is one’s karma, based on the con-
tinuing actions caused by this mistaken
understanding. Another source of this
ignorance is the power of illusion (maya)
wielded by God (Ishvara), which bewil-
ders human beings. For the Advaita
Vedantin, God is identified as a qualified
(saguna) form of Brahman—thus below
the highest unqualified (nirguna)
Brahman, and himself a product of
superimposition.
Since the Advaita school believes that
the source of bondage to karma results
from mistaken understanding, the only
way to destroy bondage is to gain the cor-
rect understanding. Although the
Advaitans say that people must perform
obligatory religious actions (nitya
karma) as a matter of duty, actions can
never bring about the understanding that
is necessary for salvation, although they
may aid the process by removing some of
the karmic obstacles. To support this
understanding, the Advaitins begin their
analysis with an appeal to the knowing
subject as the one thing that can never be
doubted, and claim that this self-con-
sciousness is evidence for the existence
of the inner Self, or atman. Aside from
this appeal to experience, they depend
heavily on the authority of the sacred
texts, particularly the Upanishads, to
uphold their key doctrines: that Brahman
is the source of all things; that the human
soul is ultimately identical to Brahman,
although hampered by obstructionsAgastya
based on past karma; and that gaining
true knowledge is the basis of liberation.
The first and greatest Advaita thinker
was the philosopher Shankaracharya;
other significant figures were his two dis-
ciples, Sureshvara and Padmapada, as
well as Mandana Mishra and Vachaspati
Mishra. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Advaita Vedanta up to
Samkara and His Pupils, 1981; and

A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Advani, Lal Krishna
(b. 1927) Modern Indian politician as well
as past president and leader of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a party
often considered the political wing of the
Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Advani joined the RSS as a young man and
was encouraged by the RSS to become
active in politics, first in the Jana Sangh
and later in the BJP. In the fall of 1990,
Advani embarked on a tour of northern
India to raise public support for building
a Rama temple in Ayodhya, on a site
which at the time was occupied by a
Muslim mosque. The public response to
this rath yatra (“chariot journey”) was
positive and brought great political bene-
fits to the BJP; the BJP has since run the
state governments in some of India’s
most important states and has become
the largest opposition party in
Parliament. During the 1990s the BJP’s
influence waxed and waned, but for
much of this time, Advani has been one of
the leading figures in the party. In the
spring of 1996, however, he was one of
many Indian political figures whose name
was connected with a major bribery scan-
dal. He immediately resigned his seat in
Parliament and promised that he would
not seek office until his name had been
cleared. The allegation was found to be
completely baseless, and Advani was
reelected to Parliament in March, 1998.
During the thirteen months of BJP govern-
ment rule in 1998–99, Advani served as
Home Minister (the Cabinet officer
responsible for all domestic affairs) and
has continued in this position during the
BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.
Aerial Cars
One of the standard images in Hindu
mythology. The most famous of the
cars is the Pushpak Viman, which is
originally owned by Kubera, a minor
deity associated with mountains and
their mineral wealth. The Pushpak Viman
is commandeered and stolen by Ravana,
the demon-king of Lanka. In modern
times, mythological references to
such aerial cars are often cited as
evidence that ancient Indians possessed
the technology for flying machines,
an assertion for which there is no
historical evidence.
Aesthetics
See Rasa.
Agama
In its most general meaning, this refers
to any authoritative text. In a philo-
sophical context, this word designates
one of the pramanas, the means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge. As a pramana, the
agama denotes testimony from a reli-
able source, particularly from scrip-
tures such as the Veda. Within specific
sectarian communities, such as the
devotees (bhakta) of the gods Shiva
(Shaivas) and Vishnu (Vaishnavas), the
word also commonly designates the
particular texts deemed most authori-
tative by that community.
Agastya
In Hindu mythology, Agastya is one of
the rishis (sages) of ancient India and
is attributed with various supernormal
powers. As with many of the rishis,
Agastya is marked as different even by
his birth, which is far outside the nor-
mal manner. According to the story,
Agastya is conceived when the semen
of the deities Mitra and Varuna is
placed in a pot and develops there into
[[13]]
Aghori
a baby boy. Agastya is described as pre-
ferring a detached, ascetic lifestyle, but
he compromises in deference to his
ancestors. The ancestors appear
to Agastya in a vision, imploring him
to marry and have children, so that
his sons can continue performing the
ancestral offerings; this is one of the
three debts that every Hindu man
must pay. Agastya consents and
marries Lopamudra.
Agastya’s ascetic lifestyle is said to
have generated immense powers,
which he demonstrates by performing
many marvelous deeds. According to
some accounts, he curses king
Nahusha to become a giant serpent, in
retribution for the insults Nahusha has
heaped upon him. Agastya also curses
King Indradyumna to become an ele-
phant, and the gandharva named
Huhu to become a crocodile; the two
are released many years later through
the god Vishnu’s divine grace.
Not all of his exploits stem from his
readiness to curse—a trait found in
many of the sages—and some are per-
formed for the benefit of human
beings. He is reported to have humbled
the Vindhya Mountains (here personi-
fied), which through envy of Mount
Meru have grown so tall that the sun
and moon are unable to get around
them. Agastya does this by asking
Vindhya to bow down to let him get
through on his journey to southern
India. Agastya promises that Vindhya
can stand up again when he returns,
which has yet to happen. In other cases
Agastya is reported to have used his
powers to help get rid of demons. On
one occasion, when a group of demons
is hiding in the sea by day and coming
out to pillage at night, Agastya exposes
them by drinking up the ocean and thus
taking away their place of refuge. On
another occasion he foils a demon who
has been taking the form of a goat to be
cooked and eaten by unsuspecting din-
ers. The demon has been killing the din-
ers by exploding out of their stomachs.
Agastya eats the demon as usual, but it is
then completely destroyed by Agastya’s
[[14]]

prodigious digestive powers. See also
Gajendramoksha.
Aghori
In one context this term refers to one of
the two loosely organized groups of the
Jogi ascetics, the other being the
Nathpanthis. There are three major
groups of ascetics devoted to the god
Shiva; they are the Aghoris, Nathpanthis,
and Dashanami Sanyasis. The difference
between these is that the Dashanamis are
said to have been founded by the
philosopher Shankaracharya, while the
Aghoris and Nathpanthis are believed to
be descended from earlier Shaiva ascetic
orders, particularly the Kapalikas,
Kalamukhas, and Pashupatas. The term
aghori also refers to ascetics whose
reputed practices make them both
respected and feared by the general pop-
ulation. The Aghoris draw their name
from one of the names of the god Shiva,
Aghora, which despite its literal meaning
(“not terrifying”), designates one of the
most frightful and powerful forms of
Shiva. As devotees (bhakta) of this form
of Shiva, the Aghoris are famous for their
disregard of all social conventions and
boundaries. They often eat from a vessel
made of a human skull and are popularly
reputed to eat anything, including dung
and human flesh. Such behavior gener-
ates fascination and sometimes respect
among the larger Hindu populace, but
also considerable fear; Aghoris are so far
outside the normal social boundaries
that most people would rather avoid
interaction with them.
Agni
(“fire,” cognate with Latin ignis) Hindu
deity present in every fire. Agni is also
one of the eight dikpalas, or Guardians
of the Directions, with responsibility for
the southeast quarter. As fire, Agni is
also one of the five elements in classical
Hindu cosmology.
Agni is important in the samhitas
(hymns) of the Rg Veda and in the
Brahmanas, a later strand of Vedic liter-Agni Akhara
Ceremonies often have a part in which
offerings (often of clarified butter) are
ladled into a sacrificial fire. Fire plays an
important role in many rituals, particu-
larly that of arati, in which lamps are
waved before the image of a divinity as
an offering of light. Agni also serves as
the divine witness to the single action
widely believed to seal a marriage. This
is agnipradakshinam, in which the
bride and groom make seven revolu-
tions around a lamp or fire. Even on the
most prosaic level, fire is still essential to
daily life since most Indians continue to
cook over an open flame—whether coal,
wood, dung, or bottled gas. This every-
day utility, combined with his abiding
ritual presence, have assured Agni a
continuing presence in Hindu life.
Depiction of the god Agni. Agni is identified with
fire and is believed to be present in all fires,
along with lightning and the sun.
ature emphasizing sacrificial rites. The
Rg Veda opens with a hymn to Agni and
describes him as “the household priest,
the god and officiant of the sacrifice,
[and]. . .the giver of blessings.” Agni
remained important in the Brahmanas
since, as the sacrificial fire, he was
essential to all ritual. Agni’s importance
in these texts stems from his presence in
all three levels of the Vedic universe—on
the earth as fire, in the middle atmos-
pheric realm (antariksha) as lightning,
and in the sky as the sun. This ability to
move between these levels made Agni
the intermediary between the gods and
human beings. From above, Agni served
as the messenger of the gods, while as
the sacrificial fire on earth, Agni not only
consumed the offerings but conveyed
them in the smoke to the gods above.
Because of his role in bringing about the
sacrifice, another epithet for Agni is the
“mouth of the gods.”
Unlike many of the other Vedic
deities, Agni has retained a certain
prominence even in the present day.
Although Vedic sacrifices are uncom-
mon, sacrificial motifs have been incor-
porated into many contemporary rites.
Agni Akhara
The name of a particular subgroup of
the Naga class of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, a particular type of renunciant
ascetic. The Dashanami Nagas are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, orga-
nized into different akharas or
regiments on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers, although
they also had substantial trading inter-
ests; both of these occupations have
largely disappeared in contemporary
times. The Agni akhara is a subunit of
the Juna akhara, one of the largest and
oldest of the Naga akharas.
The Agni akhara’s membership is
very different from that of the other
established akharas. Whereas the other
Naga Sanyasi akharas will accept men
from all levels of society—in some cases
even the lowest status group, the shu-
dras—the Agni akhara admits only
unmarried brahmins who have been
lifelong celibates. Perhaps as a conse-
quence of their more exclusive member-
ship criteria, the Agni akhara is the only
Dashanami Naga akhara that has no
naked (naga) ascetics. All of its members
remain fully clothed during the proces-
sion for their bath at the Kumbha Mela.
[[15]]
Agnihotra
The Agni akhara was first established in
Benares, and this remains their most
important site. All of the akharas have
particular features that define their
organizational identity, including
specific patron deities; the Agni akhara’s
patron deity is the goddess Gayatri,
considered the embodiment of the
Gayatri Mantra.
Agnihotra
(“fire sacrifice”) Religious rite in
which offerings are made to the
sacred fire, considered to be the god
Agni in material form. The term can
also refer to the maintenance and care
of the sacred fire itself. The roots of
worship based on a sacrificial fire go
back to the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu sacred texts. This
type of worship is still present in mod-
ern times, although much diminished
in emphasis.
Agnikula
(“fire lineage”) A collective name for
the four main clans of Rajputs
(warrior princes): the Pariharas,
Chauhans, Solankis, and Pawars.
According to tradition, this collective
name refers to the Rajputs’ descent
from
a
single
mythical
king
who had arisen from a sacrificial fire
pit at Mount Abu in the state
of
Rajasthan.
Although
their
historical origin is unclear, these
four clans ruled over much of
northwestern
India,
either
as
independent kings or feudal vassals,
after their appearance at the end
of the first millennium. The Pariharas
ruled southern Rajasthan. The
Chauhans ruled the region around
Delhi. The Solankis ruled in Gujarat.
The Pawars ruled in western Madhya
Pradesh. Although their days as
warrior princes have passed, they
remain influential in politics, both
as politicians and as constituent
communities.
[[16]]

Agnipradakshinam
(“circling the fire”) A common rite in
many modern Hindu marriage cere-
monies, usually performed as part of
the saptapadi, in which the bride and
groom take seven steps to definitively
seal their marriage. The saptapadi and
the agnipradakshinam are combined so
that the bride and groom make seven
revolutions around a small fire. As the
god Agni, the fire is the divine witness to
the marriage bond between bride and
groom, a bond often symbolized by
tying the end of the groom’s turban to
the fringe of the bride’s sari. The fire is
also a sign that the celebration of mar-
riage is a yajna, or sacrificial rite.
Agnipravesha
(“entering fire”) Death by fire, which
could occur in several different contexts.
This was often used to refer to the
practice of sati, in which a widow would
be burned on her husband’s funeral pyre.
Death by fire was also one of the man-
dated forms of religious suicide; this
could be done either as a means of relief
for someone afflicted by an incurable
disease, or as part of certain rites of
sacrifice such as the sarvasvara, which
was performed to send the sacrificer
to heaven. By the beginning of the
eighteenth century, religious suicide had
been condemned and had fallen into
disuse. In the nineteenth century, British
horror at the practice of sati led them to
ban it wherever they were able to do so.
Agnishtoma
Particular rite of sacrifice prescribed
in the later strands of the Vedas, the
earliest Hindu sacred texts. The
agnishtoma was most often performed
in the early spring and was dedicated
to the Vedic god Agni (fire). The rite’s
two central elements were the press-
ing and consumption of the mysteri-
ous sacrificial drink called soma (seen
as a material form of the Vedic god
Soma), and the slaughter of sacrificial
animals, which were burned on theAhamkar
sacrificial fire (the god Agni in material
form). A final chant during the sacrifice
was addressed to Agni. During the
Vedic period, this rite became largely
the province of kings since they were
the only people who could command
the necessary resources for it. With the
later reaction against animal sacrifice,
the rite fell out of favor, although it is
still performed occasionally in a modi-
fied fashion without sacrifice.
Agrahara
A brahmin residential enclave, usually
established by a land grant from a
wealthy land owner or royalty to a par-
ticular brahmin. Brahmins had the
highest status in traditional Hindu
society, based on the belief that they
had higher ritual purity. The purpose
of the agrahara was to protect this rit-
ual purity since it could be compro-
mised fairly easily. Agraharas were
most common in southern India,
where brahmins formed an extremely
small percentage of the general popu-
lation—on average, about four per-
cent. As a small minority, southern
Indian brahmins could maintain a
more controlled environment, thereby
reducing the possibility of having their
purity tainted. In northern India,
brahmins formed a significant part of
the population and tended to live
within the towns and cities, although
they often inhabited particular sec-
tions of these places.
Ahalya
In Hindu mythology, Ahalya is the wife
of the sage Gautama. She is turned into
stone by Gautama’s curse and later
restored to life by being touched by the
foot of the god Rama. Gautama’s curse is
brought on by the actions of the god
Indra, who lusts for Ahalya. One day,
when Gautama has gone to the river to
bathe (snana), Indra takes Gautama’s
form and goes to Ahalya in a bid to make
love to her. Accounts differ on whether
Ahalya is aware of her lover’s identity—in
some she is flattered by Indra’s attention,
in others she is genuinely deceived.
When Gautama discovers what has hap-
pened, he curses Ahalya to become a
stone and Indra to have a thousand vagi-
nas on his body, as a punishment for his
lust. Gautama is later mollified into mod-
ifying the curses, so that Ahalya will
remain a stone until she is touched by
Rama’s foot, and Indra will be covered
instead with a thousand eyes. This story
primarily illustrates the power of the
sages to curse even the gods, but the dif-
ferent versions also reveal varying
assumptions about the nature of women.
Aham Brahmasmi
(“I am Brahman.”) In the Hindu philo-
sophical tradition, this is one of the four
“great
utterances”
(mahavakyas)
expressing an ultimate truth. The
truth expressed in this utterance is the
idea that atman (the individual Self )
and Brahman (Ultimate Reality) are
one and the same—identical; this
truth is at the heart of the speculative
texts called the Upanishads. The four
mahavakyas, aside from their philo-
sophical importance as capsulizing
fundamental truths, were also appro-
priated by the four divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasi ascetics as iden-
tifying symbols. Each division had a
different mahavakya, just as each had
a different Veda, a different primary
sacred center, and a different
paradigmatic ascetic quality. Aham
Brahmasmi is the mahavakya associat-
ed with the Bhuriwara division of the
Dashanami Sanyasis.
Ahamkar
(“I-making”) In the Samkhya school of
Hindu philosophy, ahamkar is one of
the stages in the evolution of prakrti
(primal matter) away from its initial
undifferentiated unity toward differen-
tiation of the Self and other things.
The final result of this degradation
is the world that we see around us,
in which human souls are subject to
[[17]]
Ahimsa
Temple to the goddess Durga in the city of Aihole.
reincarnation (samsara). Prakrti evolves
first into mahat (“the great one”) and
then into ahamkar, which is the
first stage in which there is a sense
of
self
and
subjectivity.
This
sense of subjectivity colors the entire
devolution after that. Ahamkar
then evolves further, forming the
basis for both the subjective and
objectice world: on one hand, the
individual’s
organs
of
sense
(jnanendriya) and organs of action
(karmendriya) develop, and on the
other
hand,
the
five
subtle
elements (tanmatras), which are
the basis of the gross material
elements, evolve. In colloquial speech,
ahamkar is used to mean “self-pride,”
invariably in a pejorative sense.
Ahimsa
(“refraining from harm”) Ahimsa refers
to the conscious commitment to
refrain from harming other living
beings, either directly or indirectly. The
emphasis on ahimsa originated with
the Jains, for whom all actions carry
karmic consequences, but who also
believe that the karmic consequences
[[18]]

generated by intentional evil acts are
far more severe than those from unin-
tentional ones. Jain and Buddhist com-
mitment to ahimsa brought it further
into Indian society, and it has been an
important feature of Hindu practice for
well over two thousand years. In the
Yoga Sutras, Patanjali mentions ahim-
sa as one of the restraints (yama) and
thus recommends it as one of the basic
foundations for religious life. This
commitment to ahimsa is believed to
be one of the major forces responsible
for the decline of animal sacrifice,
which was one of the most important
types of religious practice as described
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scrip-
tures. Far more recently, in the twenti-
eth century, ahimsa was one of the
guiding principles of Mohandas
Gandhi during the struggle for Indian
independence. Although Gandhi did
not rule out the use of violence in prin-
ciple, his commitment to ahimsa
reflected his judgment that means and
ends are karmically linked, and that
the means one employs will determine
both the nature and tone of one’s ends.

Ahir
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (birth). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status largely determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group had a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Ahiras were
a jati whose hereditary occupation was
herding and selling milk.
Aihole
Historical site in the state of Karnataka,
just south of the modern city of Bijapur.
Aihole was an important city during the
Chalukya dynasty (4th–8th c. C.E.), and its
surviving buildings are some of the oldest
standing Hindu temples. These temples
represent an early stage in the evolution of
Hindu architecture from earlier architec-
tural forms, such as the rock-cut cave tem-
ple (chaitya) or enclosed courtyard
(vihara). One of the earliest temples (ca.
[[450]]
 C.E.) is a simple square pavilion (man-
dapa) with a tower (shikhara) over the
main image of the deity, one of the hall-
marks of later Hindu temples. A temple to
Durga built about a century later has the
general plan of a chaitya, but a shikhara
was also added. Although the temples at
Aihole are related to the earlier forms, they
also prefigure the mature development of
medieval Hindu architecture.
Aims of Life
(purushartha) Four general goals that
Hindu society has accepted as legitimate
ends for all human beings: artha (wealth
and power), kama (desire, especially sex-
ual desire), dharma (righteousness or
religious duty), and moksha (final libera-
tion of the soul from the cycle of reincar-
nation). Hindus have affirmed that all of
these are worthy ends, but have generally
accepted that the last goal is qualitatively
different from the other three, which are
more strongly interrelated. There is noth-
ing wrong with seeking money or plea-
sure, and Hindu culture affirms both of
these aims with the understanding that
their pursuit and enjoyment should
ultimately be regulated by a commitment
to dharma. Although there are paths to
moksha that allow one to remain in the
world, it is generally accepted that a per-
son pursuing moksha will be less atten-
tive to worldly desires because they are
incompatible with this ultimate goal.
Aippasi
Seventh month in the Tamil solar year,
corresponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Tula (the zodiacal sign
of Libra), which according to the Indian
calendar usually falls within October and
November. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the con-
tinuing importance of regional cultural
patterns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradition.

Tamil language.
Airavata
In Hindu mythology, the divine ele-
phant who is the vehicle of Indra, king
of the gods. The only significant role
Airavata plays in any myth is as the ulti-
mate cause for why the gods have to
churn the Ocean of Milk. One day the
powerful and irascible sage Durvasas
gives a garland to Indra. Indra places the
garland on Airavata, who throws it on
the ground. The reasons for this differ—
in one account Airavata is plagued by
the bees gathering on it, and in another
he is intoxicated by the scent of the flow-
ers. Durvasas understands this as an
insult and, in his anger, curses the gods
to be subject to old age and death. The
only way the gods can escape the effects
of the curse is to obtain the nectar of
immortality, which is done by churning
the Ocean of Milk. See also Tortoise avatar.
Aiteraya Brahmana
Along with the Shatapatha Brahmana,
the two most important texts in the
[[19]]
Aiyanar
Aiyappa
A shrine to Aiyanar, a regional deity in southern
India who is the protector of villages.
Brahmana stratum of Vedic literature.
The Brahmanas are primarily manuals
describing the correct performance of
Vedic ritual sacrifices. Because they were
composed later than the actual Vedas,
each Brahmana is connected in theory
with one of the Vedas, to give it authority
as a sacred Vedic text. According to tradi-
tion, the Aiteraya Brahmana is associated
with the earliest of the Vedas, the Rg Veda.
Aiyanar
Southern Indian regional deity. In the state
of Tamil Nadu Aiyanar is an important vil-
lage deity, generally considered to be the
guardian of the village tank, bringer of rain,
and protector of the village. It is likely that
he is an indigenous deity who has been
assimilated into the Hindu pantheon.
Aiyanar is sometimes identified with
Aiyappa, although there are some discrep-
ancies between the two—Aiyanar is a deity
associated with the protection of villages,
whereas Aiyappa is associated with the
hills, the jungle, and the hunt. For further
information see Louis Dumont, “A Folk
Deity of Tamil Nad: Aiyanar, the Lord,” in T.
N. Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
[[20]]

Hilltop deity of the southern Indian
state of Kerala, who at the local level is
often identified with Aiyanar, the Tamil
village deity. The most important of
Aiyappa’s shrines is at Shabari Malai in
the hills of central Kerala, to which there
is an important pilgrimage each winter
in December and January. Aiyappa’s
strong associations with the hills and
the hunt make it likely that he was origi-
nally a local deity of the hills of Kerala,
but in more recent times he has been
assimilated into the larger Hindu pan-
theon as the son of Shiva and Vishnu.
Although both of these gods are male,
Aiyappa’s conception is said to happen
when Vishnu takes the form of the
female enchantress Mohini, to beguile
the demons into parting with the
nectar of immortality. Because of his
parentage, Aiyappa is also called
Hariharaputra, “the son (putra) of Hari
(Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva).”
Due to his unusual conception,
Aiyappa is fated to kill a particularly
troubling buffalo demoness, Mahishi,
who has been given the boon that she
cannot be killed by anyone born from
the union of male and female. After his
birth the infant Aiyappa is abandoned
by a riverbank, and adopted by King
Rajashekhara, who names him
Manikanta. Manikanta’s stepmother is
very jealous of her stepson and wishes
to clear the path to the throne for her
own child. When Manikanta is twelve his
stepmother feigns an illness that she
says only tiger’s milk can cure. Everyone
is understandably reluctant to try to get
the tiger’s milk, but Manikanta finally
agrees to do so.
On his way to get the tiger’s milk,
Manikanta is met by messengers of
Shiva, who remind him that his life’s
ultimate purpose is to kill Mahishi. After
a long struggle, Manikanta dispatches
the demon, but while he is dancing on
the she-buffalo’s body, another female
figure rises out of it. She identifies her-
self as Lila, and wants to marry
Manikanta, but as a celibate student he
does not desire this. He appeases LilaAjatashatru
with the conditional vow that he will
marry her the year that a celibate pil-
grim does not come to visit him on
Shabari Malai—a vow that will never
come true since celibacy is the single
most important requirement for the
Shabari Malai pilgrimage. Manikanta
then placates Lila by establishing a tem-
ple for her on a neighboring hilltop.
Returning to his original task of
retrieving the tiger’s milk, Aiyappa then
bids Shiva to take the form of a tiger,
upon which he rides back to his steppar-
ents, inviting them to milk the tiger to
their heart’s content. This image of the
young boy returning astride the tiger is
one of the most common Aiyappa
images. For further information see

Tamil Nadu,” in Asko Parpola and Bent

Aja Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark (waning) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). As are all of the
eleventh-day observances, this is ded-
icated to the worship of Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain pre-
scribed rites, usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. The most important
requirement for this festival is to pass
the night in worship; taking part is
believed to free one from all evil. The
name Aja means “unborn” and is one
of the epithets of Vishnu.
Ajamila
In Hindu mythology Ajamila is an exam-
ple of a completely corrupted sinner,
who is saved from Death by the bound-
less power of God’s grace. Ajamila is a
fallen brahmin who does all the things
forbidden to brahmins—he eats meat,
drinks liquor, takes a low caste woman as
his mistress, and ignores all the purity
laws which brahmins are supposed to
keep. His only redeeming feature is his
love for his son Narayana, which is also
one of the names of Vishnu. As he lies
dying, Ajamila sees the minions of Death
coming for him, whose terrible forms
portend a dire fate. In his terror at this
vision and his longing for his son, Ajamila
calls out “Narayana” with his dying
breath, and because of this Vishnu sends
his minions to rescue Ajamila. Ajamila is
brought to Vaikuntha, Vishnu’s dwelling
place, where he lives happily.
Ajatashatru
(“[he whose] enemy is unborn,” 5th c.
B.C.E.) King in the Magadha region in the
modern state of Bihar. Ajatashatru
deposed and murdered his father,
Bimbisara, around 494 B.C.E., then
expanded his father’s territorial gains.
Ajatashatru first annexed the area
around the city of Benares and then
conquered the city of Vaishali, capital of
the kingdom of the Vrjjis. Ajatashatru
and his father both aimed at building an
empire in the Ganges River basin, and
they were among the first Indian kings
to conceive of a far-flung empire.
Ajatashatru
(2) In the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, a
great sage who was also the king of
Benares. Ajatashatru is notable for
instructing Gargya, a brahmin priest, on
the nature of Brahman, even though this
was inappropriate by contemporary
standards since Ajatashatru was a ksha-
triya warrior king and thus should have
been receiving instruction from Gargya.
The Upanishads have several episodes in
which, contrary to the norm, kshatriyas
instruct brahmins. Such episodes reveal
the nature of wisdom as conceived in the
Upanishads—it is achieved by individual
striving and realization and not con-
ferred by birth or social position.

Ajita Keshakambalin
Ajita KeshakambalinAjna Chakra
In classical Indian philosophy, the
reputed founder of a materialist
philosophical school and whose name
reflects his usual garb—a hair blanket
(kesha-kambal). Ajita was a contem-
porary of the Buddha, and informa-
tion about him comes from the
Buddhist scriptures. Ajita’s materialist
philosophy was that human beings are
composed of four elements, that these
elements disperse after death, and
that the individual then ceases to
exist. Given this philosophy, Ajita
believed that one should enjoy life
while one could, taking pleasure in the
good and accepting the bad, and that
all religious observances were a waste
of time and a futile hope. Ajita was the
first in a long tradition of materialists,
and one finds evidence of this materi-
alist perspective as late as the eighth
century of the common era.In many schools of yoga and in the esoteric
ritual tradition known as tantra, the ajna
chakra is one of the six psychic centers
(chakras) thought to be in the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate physiologi-
cal system, believed to exist on a different
plane of existence than gross matter but
with certain correspondences to the mate-
rial body. The subtle body is comprised of
a set of six chakras, which are visualized as
multipetaled lotus flowers running rough-
ly along the course of the spine, connected
by three vertical channels. Each chakra has
important symbolic associations—with
differing human capacities, different sub-
tle elements (tanmatras), and different
seed syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, thus
encompassing all sacred sound. Above and
below the chakras are the bodily abodes of
Shiva (awareness) and Shakti (power), the
two divine principles through which the
entire universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this con-
cept of the subtle body is thus the homolo-
gy of macrocosm and microcosm, an
essential Hindu idea since the time of the
mystical texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally enu-
merated from the bottom up, and the
ajna chakra is the sixth and highest of
these. It is visualized as a two-petaled
lotus located in the forehead just above
the top of the nose. Its petals contain the
bijaksharas Ham and Ksam, formed
from the last two letters of the Sanskrit
alphabet. The ajna chakra is associated
with the capacity for thought, consid-
ered a distinctively human capacity and
thus the most important human faculty.

Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and
Shakta, 1978; and Philip S. Rawson, The
Art of Tantra, 1973.
Ajivika
Ancient philosophical school tradi-
tionally believed to have been founded
by Gosala Maskariputra, a contempo-
rary of the Buddha. The Ajivikas were
fatalists who believed that all things
are inexorably predetermined by des-
tiny (niyati). Since, according to this
philosophy, all things are preor-
dained, religious practice has no effect
on one’s future lives, and in doing such
things people are only doing what they
are already predetermined to do. The
Ajivikas compared the process of rein-
carnation (samsara) to a ball of string,
which would unroll until it was done
and then go no further. The Ajivikas
shunned clothing and lived a strict
ascetic lifestyle, believing that this was
the lifestyle preordained for them. The
school had a significant presence in
southern India well into the common
era but finally disappeared around the
fourteenth century. For further infor-
mation see Arthur Llewellyn Basham,
History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas, a
Vanished Indian Religion, 1981.

Akasha
(“space”) One of the five elements in
traditional Indian cosmology, the oth-
ers being earth, fire, water, and wind. In
some philosophical schools, each of theAkhara
Boys in Shri Shaku Khashbaug competing in the village akhara, or wrestling ground.
Training in wrestling and participating in competitions are considered religious disciplines.
elements is paired with one of the five
senses; akasha is associated with hear-
ing since it is believed to convey sound
from place to place.
Akbar
(r. 1555–1605) Third and greatest ruler in
the Moghul dynasty, a Muslim dynasty
that controlled large parts of India
between 1525 and 1707, existing in
reduced form until 1857. Akbar’s long
reign was marked by generally good
relations with his Hindu subjects, many
of whom were put into positions of
authority and for whom he seems to
have had genuine sympathy and under-
standing. One of his most important
gestures was to repeal a poll tax on non-
Muslims, which had been customary
but was highly unpopular among
Hindus. Although more orthodox
Muslims insinuated that Akbar was a
closet Hindu, the goodwill and coopera-
tion that he fostered helped keep things
peaceful throughout his reign.
Akhand Path
(“unbroken recitation”) The unbroken
recitation of an entire religious text,
which is believed to bring religious ben-
efits; individuals may perform such
recitations for their own benefit, or they
may hire another person to perform the
recitation for them. The benefits of this
action are believed to come from the
perceived power of the sacred text itself.
The recitation may be done as a pious
act, simply for the merit in sponsoring
it, or as part of a festival observance; it
may also be a last resort in times of dire
emergencies or a religious act per-
formed after a death in the family. One
of the texts often recited without a break
is the Ramcharitmanas, a retelling of
the Ramayana by the sixteenth-century
poet-saint Tulsidas; in the Sikh com-
munity, the Adigranth is recited.
Akhara
In its most basic meaning, an akhara
is a “wrestling ground,” a place in the
village or city where young men come
to train, tone, and compete. Such
practices at an akhara are not merely
physical exercise but also a form of
religious practice, since wrestlers
often begin by worshiping Hanuman,
a deity associated with strength and
power. Among the Naga class of the
[[23]]
Akhyati
Dashanami Sanyasis, the word
akhara means something closer to
“regiment.” The Dashanami Nagas
were ascetics devoted to the god
Shiva and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary sol-
diers. These Nagas were organized
into different akharas based on the
model of an army, and here the word
primarily marks group affiliation,
although it can also refer to the build-
ings in which the group lives. The Nagas
are divided into seven main akharas—the
Juna or Bhairava, Agni, Avahana,
Niranjani, Ananda, Mahanirvani, and
Atala. Among the Bairagi Naga
ascetics—militant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu—
the largest division of forces is into anis
(“armies”), which are then subdivided
into akharas.
Akhyati
(“nondiscrimination”) Theory of error
propounded by Prabhakara, a member of
the Purva Mimamsa philosophical
school, who lived in the seventh or eighth
century C.E. All the theories of error aim to
explain why people make errors in judg-
ment, such as the stock example of mis-
taking the silvery flash of a seashell for a
piece of silver. Prabhakara explains this
error as rooted in the inability to make
sharp distinctions. The person uncritically
connects two simple judgments, “that
object is silvery” and “silver is silvery.” By
themselves, both of these statements are
true; what is false is their combination into
the complex judgment, “that object is sil-
ver.” According to Prabhakara, the prob-
lem lies not with the simple impressions
given by perception (pratyaksha) or
memory—both of which are true—but
with their uncritical connection, in which
the mind fails to recognize that other
judgments are possible. For further infor-
mation see Bijayananda Kar, The Theories
of Error in Indian Philosophy, 1978; and
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.

Akkadevi
Sister of King Jayasimha II (1015–1042
C.E.), a monarch in the Chalukya
dynasty that ruled large parts of the
Deccan peninsula. Akkadevi was impor-
tant not only through her family con-
nections but also because she served as
a provincial governor in her brother’s
kingdom. Her example shows that
women in powerful families have often
been able to overcome the seeming
social disadvantages imposed by their
gender, a maxim proven most recently
by Sonia Gandhi.
Akrura
In Hindu mythology Akrura is most
famous as the envoy from the royal
court at Mathura, who takes the god
Krishna away from Krishna’s childhood
home in Braj, never to return. Krishna’s
wicked uncle, King Kamsa, instructs
Akrura to lure Krishna and his brother
Balarama to a festival, where they will
be killed in a “friendly” bout with some
wrestlers. Akrura sees through the plot
and warns Krishna about it, but he
remains indelibly associated with
Krishna’s departure from Braj, which for
his devotees (bhakta) is the bitterest
moment in all of Krishna’s mythology.
For a moving, dramatic account of this
incident, see John Stratton Hawley, At
Play with Krishna, 1981.
Akshakumara
In the Hindu epic the Ramayana, this
is one of the sons of Ravana by his wife
Mandodari. Akshakumara fights
bravely and valiantly in the war
against Rama’s army but is eventually
killed by Rama’s servant, the monkey-
deity, Hanuman.
Akshamala
A string of beads used to keep count
when reciting prayers or mantras,
sometimes translated by the accessi-
ble but misleading term “rosary.” An
akshamala is one of the most common
religious articles, and the materialsAkshaya Vata
from which it is made can often reveal
sectarian affiliations. Shiva is often
depicted wearing beads made of the
seeds of the Elaeocarpus ganitrus tree,
which are known as rudraksha (“eye of
Rudra”). Devotees (bhakta) of Shiva
emulate this practice. Devotees of the
god Vishnu often carry beads made of
wood from the tulsi plant, which is
considered a form of Vishnu’s wife
Lakshmi. Other commonly used mate-
rials are sandalwood and crystal, but
akshamalas can also be made from
expensive materials such as coral and
amber. In Hindu iconography the
akshamala is one of the items com-
monly held by the goddess Saraswati,
in keeping with her identity as the
patron deity of learning and, by impli-
cation, sacred sound. The akshamala
is also one of the items commonly held
by the god Brahma, but in his case it
has less specific significance.
Akshar Purushottam Samstha
One of the prominent branches of the
Swaminarayan sect, which split off
from its parent body in 1906. The
Swaminarayan movement is based on
the teachings of Sahajananda Swami
(1781–1830), an ascetic who was a devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
Sahajananda’s followers eventually
revered him as a manifestation of
Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu),
based on the idea that avatars of Vishnu
appear on earth in times of extreme
trouble. This same reverence is given to
Sahajananda Swami’s ascetic succes-
sors, who are known by the title
Pramukh Swami (“President Swami”).
At present the Akshar Purushottam
Samstha has several million lay devotees
(bhakta) who are mainly Gujarati mer-
chants; their affluence has helped make
the movement financially strong. The
most important figures in the movement
are the small number of ascetics who
serve as teachers and spiritual advisers,
headed by the Pramukh Swami. For fur-
ther information see Raymond Brady
Williams, A New Face of Hinduism, 1984.
Akshaya Trtiya
(also called Akha Teej) Festival
celebrated on the third day of the
bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Baisakh (April–May). The
festival’s name reflects the belief that
the religious merit from rites per-
formed on this day is indestructible
(akshaya). This is thought to be the day
on which the Treta Yuga (a previous
cosmic age) began, and as a transition-
al day is believed to be highly
auspicious. This day is marked by wor-
ship of Vishnu and his consort
Lakshmi; it is also believed to be the
birthday of Vishnu’s sixth incarnation,
Parashuram avatar. Consistent both
with the worship of Vishnu and
the belief that this is a transitional
day, on Akshaya Trtiya the temple
doors are opened at the Four
Himalayan Dhams (the holy towns
of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath,
and Badrinath) after having been
closed all winter, and worship in
those places is resumed until after the
festival of Diwali in the fall. See also
Four Dhams.
Akshaya Vata
(“indestructible banyan tree”) In Hindu
mythology, a particular banyan tree that
existed before the creation of the uni-
verse and will be the only thing to sur-
vive the cosmic dissolution (pralaya) at
the end of the cosmic cycle. According to
one mythic account, the sage
Markandeya saw a vision of pralaya in
which the only thing remaining was this
single tree, under which lay the god
Krishna in infant form, sucking on his
toes. The akshaya vata is identified with
a particular banyan tree in Allahabad at
the junction of the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers, where it is now enclosed within
the fort built by the Moghul emperor
Akbar. Earlier writers report an
enormous tree on the site, but in mod-
ern times the tree is quite small. In some
stories it was cut down by one of Akbar’s
successors. According to the seventh-
century Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang,
[[25]]
Alakananda River
The Alakananda River near Badrinath Garhwal.
As a tributary of the Ganges, its waters are considered sacred.
one of the preferred methods for
committing religious suicide was to
jump from the branches of the vata
tree; this practice is also mentioned
four centuries later by the Islamic
scholar Alberuni.
Alakananda River
The longest and largest Himalayan tribu-
tary of the Ganges River; the Ganges forms
at Devaprayag, where the Alakananda
unites with a second major tributary, the
Bhagirathi River. As with all the Himalayan
tributaries of the Ganges, the Alakananda
River is considered sacred. Important pil-
grimage places (tirtha) along the river
include the temple town of Badrinath near
its headwaters, its junction with the
Pindara River at Karnaprayag, its junction
with the Mandakini River at Rudraprayag,
and Devaprayag.
[[26]]

Alakhiya Akhara
The name of one subgroup of ascetics
within the Naga class of the Dashanami
order of Sanyasis. The Dashanami
Nagas are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, organized into different akharas
or regiments that follow the model of an
army. Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas’ primary
occupation was as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trad-
ing interests; both of these occupations
have largely disappeared in contempo-
rary times. The Alakhiya akhara is a
subunit of the Juna akhara, one of the
largest and oldest of the Naga akharas.
The name Alakhiya comes from the
word alakh (“without characteristics,” a
name for the Supreme Being), which
many Shaiva ascetics utter when beg-
ging for alms.Alandi
Until the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, the Nagas were fight-
ing ascetics, drawn largely from the
ranks of the shudras, the lowest Hindu
varna. According to tradition, these
fighting ascetics were recruited to pro-
tect the learned ascetics who, because
they were saintly and scholarly men,
could not protect themselves. The
Nagas also had substantial trading
interests. Two and three hundred years
ago, these akharas were very powerful,
especially in parts of the country
where the centralized government had
broken down. The Naga akharas sold
their services as mercenaries, lent
money at interest, engaged in trade,
and often owned large amounts of
property. The one place where the
divisions and subdivisions of the
akharas are still quite important is at
the celebration of the Kumbha Mela, a
bathing (snana) festival. There is a
strict order for bathing, and individu-
als get a place in line based on their
affiliation. Two hundred years ago,
being first in line signified political,
economic, and/or military domi-
nance. The present bathing order
reflects each group's relative impor-
tance from that time.
Alamkara
(“ornamentation”) A term for figures of
speech in Sanskrit poetry, of which there
are more than one hundred types. Many
of these are the same as those used in
English poetics, such as metaphor, simile,
contrast, hyperbole, alliteration, and
puns. The Sanskrit literati distinguished
these figures of speech even further into
more specific types, such as a simile
expressing wonder, a simile expressed by
doubt, and poetic error, which is the
inverse of a metaphor (“that’s not the
moon, but her face . . .”). Other forms are
unique to Indian poetry, such as respec-
tive enumeration, an extended compari-
son in which one line mentions several
referents and the following lines
describe their attributes, always in the
same order as the first line. Another
form unique to Indian poetry is denial in
which the speaker’s real intent is
expressed by denial, but is accompanied
by enough suggestion to indicate the
true meaning. The use of alamkara
marked all kinds of Sanskrit poetry, both
religious and nonreligious, and many of
these forms were brought into the later
devotional poetry in the vernacular
Indian languages. For further informa-
tion on Sanskrit poetics, see Daniel H. H.
Ingalls, Sanskrit Poetry, 1968.
Alambhusha
In Hindu mythology, a celestial woman
who was the daughter of the sage
Kashyapa. As with many of the celestial
women, she was often sent by Indra,
the king of the gods, to seduce sages
whose spiritual merit was great enough
to pose a threat to Indra’s lordship. The
assumption behind this is that celibacy
builds spiritual power, through which
one can become a rival to the gods
themselves. Sexual activity quickly
drains this accumulated power,
although the release of such power usu-
ally has positive consequences.
Alambhusha is best known for her dal-
liance with the sage Dadhichi, by
whom she had a son named Saraswat.
Alandi
Maharashtra village famous as the
home of the poet-saint Jnaneshvar and
the site of his samadhi (burial) shrine.
Jnaneshvar was the first great figure in
the Varkari Panth, a religious commu-
nity centered around the worship of the
Hindu god Vithoba. Varkari religious
practice centers primarily around two
annual pilgrimages, in which all the
participants arrive in Pandharpur in the
modern state of Maharashtra on the
same day. Despite having been dead for
over 700 years, Jnaneshvar still symboli-
cally travels from Alandi to Pandharpur
twice each year; a palanquin (palkhi)
carrying his sandals is at the head of the
procession bearing his name.
[[27]]
Alberuni
Alberuni
(973–ca.1050 C.E.) Anglicized version
of the name of Abu Rayhan Biruni, a
central Asian scholar-scientist who
was one of the greatest intellectual fig-
ures of his time. Alberuni was a mem-
ber of the court of King Mahmud of
Ghazni—by most accounts, quite
reluctantly—and was forced to accom-
pany Mahmud on some of his pillag-
ing raids in India. Alberuni used this
involuntary “fieldwork” as an opportu-
nity to study Hindu life, culture, and
sciences, and his work shows him to
be a perceptive, careful, and dispas-
sionate observer. In 1030 C.E. he pub-
lished his findings in his Tahqiq ma
li’l-Hind, which was translated in 1888
by Edward Sachau as Alberuni’s India.
An abridged edition edited by Ainslee
Embree was published in 1971.
Alchemy
Esoteric tradition that seeks to trans-
form, transmute, and perfect the
body through the use of various
chemicals, with the ultimate goal of
rendering the body immortal. Both
Hindus and Buddhists have alchemical
schools. The reported difference
between the Buddhist rasayana school
and the Hindu dhatuvada school is
that the latter is solely materially
based, whereas the former stresses
meditation to gain final enlighten-
ment. These two schools agree on
many basic points of alchemy.
Hindu alchemists view the world as
a series of bipolar opposites in tension
with one another, and they are con-
vinced that unifying these opposing
forces brings spiritual progress and
the end of reincarnation (samsara).
Hindu alchemy shares this model of
uniting or transcending opposing
forces with Hindu tantra, an esoteric,
ritually based system of religious prac-
tice, and with hatha yoga, which is
based on a series of physical exercises
that are also believed to affect the sub-
tle body. Although all three traditions
[[28]]

share a common assumption, they
prescribe different forms of practice to
effect the final goal: in tantra, ritual; in
hatha yoga, physical exercises; and in
alchemy, physical consumption of var-
ious substances.
In the alchemical tradition, the
governing metaphor for this combina-
tion of opposites is the union of sun
and moon. In Hindu tradition the sun
and moon are connected to other
opposing principles through an elabo-
rate series of associations. The sun is
identified with heat, drying power,
fire, Shakti, and menstrual blood; the
moon with coolness, healing power,
water, Shiva, and semen. In alchemi-
cal practice the two essential chemical
elements are mercury and sulfur—the
former identified with Shiva’s semen
and the latter with Shakti’s uterine
blood. By properly mixing and con-
suming these elements, the aspirant’s
body is purified and refined, eventually
rendering it immortal. Modern descrip-
tions of this practice invariably warn
that it should only be carried out
under the direction of one’s guru (spir-
itual teacher), since otherwise these
combinations will be harmful. This
warning is not surprising since mer-
cury is a deadly poison. For further
information see Shashibhushan B.

Alchemical Body, 1996.
Alidhasana
(“shooting posture”) Bodily posture
(asana) characteristic of certain
images in Hindu iconography. This
position is like that of an archer draw-
ing a bow, in which one knee is thrown
forward, the other leg pushed back,
and the trunk twisted in the direction
of the front leg. The god Shiva in his
manifestation as Tripurari, “the
destroyer of the Triple City,” is often
shown in this posture. The god Rama is
also portrayed in his warrior pose.Alvar
Allahabad
(“City of Allah”) City at the junction of
the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. The city
was named Allahabad by the Moghul
emperor Akbar, who built a fort there in
[[1583]]
 to signify Moghul control of the
region. Traditionally, the place where the
rivers meet is considered a sacred
bathing (snana) place, and the city was
called Prayaga (“place of sacrifice”) by
the Hindus. This name is still used to
distinguish the sacred site (tirtha) from
the city surrounding it. Another name
for the junction is Triveni (“triple
stream”), reflecting the traditional belief
that the two visible rivers are joined at
the confluence by a third underground
river, the Saraswati. Near the bathing
place is a banyan tree believed to be the
akshaya vata (“indestructible banyan
tree”), which despite its powerful name
is at present very small.
As with all places where the Ganges
makes some natural transition—here
its confluence with another sacred
river—Prayaga is considered especially
holy, and bathing there is believed to
confer even greater religious merit
than a normal Ganges bath. This sanc-
tity can be further amplified by
bathing during particularly auspi-
cious times in the calendar. For
example, the annual Magh Mela is a
bathing festival held during the lunar
month of Magh ( January–February).
The holiest time for bathing is during
a festival called Kumbha Mela, which
is held approximately every twelve
years when Jupiter is in Taurus. The
Kumbha Mela is followed six years
later by the Ardha (“half”) Kumbha
Mela, which carries less sanctity than
the “full” Kumbha Mela but is still
considered a highly propitious event.
Allahabad’s Kumbha Mela in 1989 was
the largest religious festival on earth,
attended by an estimated fifteen mil-
lion people on a single day.
Allama Prabhu
(12th c. C . E .) Poet-saint and religious
leader in the Lingayat community, a
bhakti (devotional) community that
worships Shiva as the single supreme
god and rejects all caste regulations.
The Lingayats formed in the southern
Indian state of Karnataka, where they
still have a considerable presence,
and the collections of poetry that
form their most important religious
texts are composed in the Kannada
language. According to legend,
Allama was Shiva himself on earth,
and the honorific title “Master”
(Prabhu) indicates the respect that
his Lingayat contemporaries granted
him. In his poetry, Allama spoke from
the perspective of one who had
gained final liberation and had com-
pletely transcended all ritual and
worldly ties. For further information
see A. K. Ramanujan (trans.), Speaking
of Siva, 1973.
Alvar
Collective name for twelve poet-saints
devoted to the god Vishnu who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and tenth centuries. In conjunction
with the Nayanars, who were devoted
to the god Shiva, the Alvars spear-
headed the revitalization of Hindu
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and
the Jains. Both the Alvars and the
Nayanars stressed passionate devo-
tion (bhakti) to a personal god and
conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
The earliest Alvars were a group of
three seventh-century contempo-
raries: Poygai, Pey, and Bhutam,
whose propitious meeting on a rainy
night is described as sparking the
devotional flame. The next group:
Tiruppan, Tirumalisai, Tondaradippodi,
Kulashekhara, Periyalvar, Andal, and
Tirumangai, are believed to have lived
in the ninth century. They were followed
by Nammalvar and his disciple
Mathurakavi, who can be reasonably
placed in the beginning of the tenth
century, as can Nathamuni, who col-
lected all of the Alvars’ hymns in the
Nalayira Prabandham. Although the
[[29]]
Amalaka
Alvars described themselves only as
human devotees (bhakta), by the tenth
century they were revered by the
Shrivaishnava religious community as
anshavatars, or incarnations of Vishnu’s
attributes or companions. Their collected
hymns were (and are) popularly known as
the Tamil Veda and became a vital part of
later Vaishnava piety in southern India.
This is particularly true for the
Shrivaishnava tradition, in which one of
the major figures was Nathamuni himself.
Amalaka
In the Nagara style of Hindu temple
architecture, the amalaka is a stone
disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that
sits on top of the temple’s main tower.
According to one interpretation, the
amalaka represents a lotus and is thus
the symbolic seat for the deity wor-
shiped below. Another interpretation is
that it symbolizes the sun and is thus the
gateway to the heavenly world. The
amalaka itself is crowned with a kalasha
(finial), from which a temple banner is
often hung. See also heavens.
Amalaki Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Phalgun
(February–March). As are all of the
eleventh-day observances, this is dedi-
cated to the worship of Vishnu. Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites, usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise specific
benefits for faithful performance. On
this day, one should worship the amvala
tree since this is one of the places in
which Vishnu is believed to reside.
Amarkantak
Sacred site (tirtha) at the headwaters of
the Narmada River, in the Vindhya
mountains in the state of Madhya
Pradesh. As with all the junctions of
India’s sacred rivers, Amarkantak is
held to be an especially holy place for
[[30]]

religious actions. Most pilgrims go there
to perform common pilgrimage rites
such as snana (bathing) and shraddha
(memorial rites), but Amarkantak is also
one of the places mentioned in Sanskrit
texts as a site for religious suicide.
Amarnath
(“The Undying Lord”) Sacred site
(tirtha) and pilgrimage place located
high in the mountains of Kashmir, ded-
icated to the god Shiva in the form of
Amarnath (The Undying Lord). The
focus of the site is a limestone cave,
where each year melting snow trickling
through the limestone fissures naturally
forms a pillar of ice. At its largest, this
pillar can be more than seven feet tall,
but this can vary significantly from year
to year depending on the weather. The
most common aniconic image of Shiva
is the linga, a cylindrical form imper-
fectly described as a “phallic symbol.”
Hindus believe that the ice pillar in the
Amarnath cave is a svayambhu, or “self-
manifested,” linga of Shiva. Such lingas
are not made by human beings but are
places where Shiva decides to reveal
himself, out of love for his devotees
(bhakta). Any svayambhu image is
believed to be particularly holy because
Shiva is thought to be uniquely present.
These sites are often seen as places
where prayers and worship are particu-
larly efficacious.
The Amarnath cave is in a remote
spot that is inaccessible for most of the
year due to snow. The pilgrimage takes
place during the month of Shravan
( July–August), with travelers timing
their trip to arrive on the day
of the full moon. The pilgrimage
officially begins at the Dashanami
Sanyasi akhara in Shrinagar and is led
by the akhara’s leader (mahant), who
carries a silver mace as an emblem of his
authority. This preeminence is given to
ascetics because they are living symbols
of Shiva himself, who is the perfect
ascetic. Most pilgrims start their journey
at the town of Pahalgam. From there
they walk almost thirty miles toAmaru
The outside entrance of the limestone caves at Amarnath.
This is a sacred site in which the god Shiva is believed to reside.
Amarnath, crossing two mountain
ranges on the way. Although the region
is thinly settled for most of the year, dur-
ing the pilgrimage season, camps and
businesses spring up along the route;
many are run by local Kashmiri
Muslims, for whom this is a major
source of livelihood. The offerings at the
shrine are evenly split between the
mahant, the local pandas (Hindu
pilgrimage priests), and a group of
Muslims from a village near Pahalgam
who traditionally maintained the road,
although the state has done this since
India has gained independence. During
the early 1990s, parts of Kashmir were a
war zone between Indian government
forces and a variety of Kashmiri Muslim
groups, some of which pressed for
greater self-determination and others
for unification with Pakistan. These
problems have affected the pilgrimage,
which passes through some of the most
contested areas. In 1994 there were sev-
eral attacks on travelers, reportedly
prompted by pilgrims chanting anti-
Muslim slogans, and in 1995 the pil-
grimage took place under heavy security
provided by the Indian army. The 1996
pilgrimage had no political turmoil, but
several hundred people died of
hypothermia caused by a sudden unsea-
sonable snowstorm.
Amaru
(7th c.?) Sanskrit poet traditionally
thought to be the author of the
Amarushatakam (“Amaru’s Hundred”),
a collection of poems on the theme of
erotic love. The text’s name is doubly
misleading since present editions con-
tain almost 200 poems, and there is
strong evidence that it was compiled
from several earlier collections, making
its authorship uncertain. Although
Amaru’s poetry explores the joys of car-
nal love and is thus not explicitly reli-
gious, the themes of lover/beloved
and union/separation treated in this
poetry later became standard themes in
bhakti (devotional) poetry. In the
Shankaradigvijaya,
a
legendary
biography
of
the
philosopher
[[31]]
Amaruka
Shankaracharya, Amaru is described as
a king who becomes mythically con-
nected with the great sage. In response
to the challenge that he knows nothing
about sexuality, Shankaracharya uses
his yogic powers to animate Amaru’s
body immediately after the latter’s
death. In this form Shankaracharya
experiences this facet of human life,
although reportedly without desire on
his part. Shankaracharya has sexual
relations with Amaru’s wives, enjoys
the fruits of passion, and pens the
Amarushatakam to record his deeds.
Although this claim is highly doubtful,
it helps to illustrate some important
thematic connections between reli-
gious and erotic poetry. For further
information see Lee Siegel, Fires of
Love—Waters of Peace, 1983.
Amaruka
Another name for the legendary poet
Amaru. See Amaru.
Amarushatakam
(“Amaru’s Hundred”) Collection of
poems on the theme of erotic love, tra-
ditionally ascribed to the seventh-cen-
tury poet Amaru. The text’s name is
doubly misleading since present edi-
tions contain almost 200 poems, and
there is strong evidence that it was com-
piled from several earlier collections,
making its authorship uncertain.
Although the poetry explores the joys of
carnal love and is thus not explicitly reli-
gious, the themes of lover/beloved and
union/separation treated in this poetry
later became standard genres of bhakti
(devotional) poetry.
Amba
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata,
Amba is the elder sister of Ambika and
Ambalika. In the story she is abducted
with her sisters by Bhishma, to be mar-
ried to his stepbrother Vichitravirya.
Ambika and Ambalika happily marry
Vichitravirya, but when Amba confides
[[32]]

that she has already given her heart to
King Salva, Bhishma releases her to go to
him. When Amba returns to Salva, he
rejects her on the grounds that her vir-
ginity is suspect because she has been
abducted by another man. Amba
returns to Bhishma and demands that
he marry her, since he is responsible for
her plight. Bhishma refuses to do so
because he has promised his father,
King Shantanu, that he will never marry,
to ensure that his stepbrothers will have
no rivals for the throne. His refusal
leaves Amba with no source of support,
and she vows to get revenge. She is later
reborn as the man-woman Shikhandi,
behind whom Arjuna hides to shoot the
arrows that eventually kill Bhishma.
Ambakeshvar
Another name for Tryambakeshvar, the
presiding deity of a sacred site (tirtha) at
Trimbak, in the Nasik district of the state of
Maharashtra. Tryambakeshvar is one of
the twelve jyotirlingas, the “lingas of light”
that are considered especially sacred to
Shiva. See Tryambakeshvar.
Ambalika
In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata,
Ambalika is the daughter of the king of
Kashi and one of the wives of King
Vichitravirya. When Vichitravirya dies
childless, his mother, Satyavati, calls
upon her eldest son, Vyasa, to sleep with
Ambalika and her sister Ambika in the
hope that the women will conceive and
continue the family line. According to
tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa
appears in her bed. Ambalika turns pale,
causing her son Pandu to be born with
an unnaturally pale complexion, and
Ambika covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind.
Ambarisha
In Hindu mythology, a king of the
Ikshvaku dynasty about whom various
sources paint very differing pictures. In
the Ramayana, the earlier of the twoAmmonite
great Hindu epics, he is portrayed as a
man who is willing to sacrifice a boy,
Sunassepha, in place of a sacrificial cow
that Indra has stolen. At the moment of
the sacrifice, Sunassepha prays to the
gods, and Indra appears to bless both
Ambarisha and Sunassepha. In another
story, from the Bhagavata Purana,
Ambarisha is portrayed as a fervent
devotee (bhakta) of Vishnu. When the
sage Durvasas tries to disrupt
Ambarisha’s ekadashi (“eleventh day”)
observances, Ambarisha calls for help
from
Vishnu’s
discus
weapon,
Sudarshana. At Ambarisha’s prayer, the
discus pursues Durvasas throughout the
universe and gives him no place of
refuge. In the end, a humbled Durvasas
is forced to beg Ambarisha’s forgiveness,
and the latter informs Durvasas of the
powers of ekadashi observance.
Ambedkar, Dr. Bhim Rao
(1891–1956) Thinker, writer, and
social activist whose worldview always
reflected his birth as a Mahar, a caste of
untouchables in the state of
Maharashtra. Ambedkar’s father had
joined the British army, which brought
the family enough social mobility for
Bhim Rao to get an education: a B.A. in
Bombay, an M.A. and Ph.D. from
Columbia University in New York City,
and a D.Sc. from London University. He
also passed the British bar exam.
Ambedkar spent his life fighting for the
rights of the untouchable classes,
through both political lobbying and
social action. In 1932, through his
efforts, untouchables were given a sepa-
rate electorate as a minority group.
Mohandas Gandhi was bitterly opposed
to removing untouchables from the
larger Hindu body politic and began a
fast unto death. In the end Ambedkar
relented, but for the rest of his life he
maintained that Gandhi had used the
untouchables as pawns in India’s politi-
cal struggles with Britain. Ambedkar
claimed that for untouchables there was
no material difference between
Gandhi’s practices and traditional caste
Hinduism, because rather than having
any real political power, the untouch-
ables had to continue relying on the
“goodwill” of Hindus to look after their
needs. Ambedkar played an important
role in the formation of the Republic of
India, including being called upon to
author its constitution, but social
inequality continued to rankle him. In
[[1956]]
 he and many of his followers for-
mally converted to Buddhism as a way
to leave the caste system behind. These
“neo-Buddhists” still exist, and despite
their relatively small numbers, their mil-
itancy makes them an important group.
Ambika
(“mother”) Epithet of the Goddess. In
many cases it refers specifically to
Shiva’s wife Parvati, but it is also used
as the name of a powerful female deity
in the Devimahatmya, the earliest text
in which a female divinity is presented
as the Ultimate Reality in the universe.
Ambika
(2) In one of the great Hindu epics, the
Mahabharata, Ambika is the daughter
of the king of Kashi and the wife of King
Vichitravirya. When Vichitravirya dies
childless, his mother, Satyavati, calls
upon her oldest son, Vyasa, to have sex
with Ambika and her sister Ambalika in
the hope that the women will conceive
and continue the family line. According
to tradition, Vyasa is very ugly, and each
woman involuntarily reacts when Vyasa
appears in her bed. Ambika covers her
eyes, causing her son Dhrtarashtra to
be born blind, and Ambalika turns pale,
causing her son Pandu to have an
unnaturally pale complexion.
Ammonite
Spiral-shaped fossil shell of a prehis-
toric sea creature. The black stones in
which these fossil shells are embedded
are known as shalagrams and are
found in great numbers in the Kali
Gandaki River in Nepal. The name
ammonite comes from the Latin
[[33]]
Amritanandamayi
expression meaning “horn of Ammon,”
which refers to a form of the god
Jupiter that bears rams’ horns. In India
the ammonite’s circular form is under-
stood as a symbol of Vishnu’s discus
(chakra), and thus the shalagram is
considered a svayambhu “self-mani-
fested” image of Vishnu himself. As
with all svayambhu forms of a deity,
the shalagram is considered to be
extraordinarily holy and is usually kept
as an object of worship.
Amritanandamayi
(b. 1953, as Sudhamani) Modern Hindu
teacher and religious leader, whose
devotees (bhakta) worship her as an
incarnation of the Goddess. She was
born the daughter of a poor fisherman,
and from her earliest childhood she
focused on religious life. Her teachings
stress the importance of devotion
(bhakti), particularly to one’s spiritual
teacher (guru), and her devotees credit
her with healing and spiritual awaken-
ing. The Mata Amritanandamayi Math,
located in the city of Quilon in the state
of Kerala, was formed to spread her
teachings in India and abroad.
Amrta
(“imperishable”) In Hindu mythology
this is the nectar of immortality, which is
churned from the Ocean of Milk through
the combined efforts of the gods and the
demons. The word is also used
metaphorically to describe anything
believed to be especially purifying and
powerful, such as charanamrta (“foot
nectar”). Charanamrta are the liquids
(milk, water, etc.) given to devotees
(bhakta) to drink, which are often the
fluids in which their guru’s feet or the
image of a deity have been bathed. See
also Tortoise avatar.
Anahata Chakra
In many schools of yoga and in the
esoteric ritual tradition known as
tantra, the anahata chakra is one of
the six psychic centers (chakras)
[[34]]

believed to exist in the subtle body.
The subtle body is an alternate
physiological system, thought to be on
a different plane of existence than
gross matter but with certain corre-
spondences to the material body. It
is comprised of a set of six psychic
centers, which are envisioned as
multi-petaled lotus flowers running
roughly along the course of the spine,
connected by three vertical channels.
Each of these chakras has important
symbolic associations—with differing
human capacities, different subtle ele-
ments (tanmatras), and different seed
syllables (bijaksharas) formed from
the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet,
thus encompassing all sacred sound.
Above and below these centers are,
respectively, Shiva (embodying aware-
ness) and Shakti (embodying power),
the two divine principles through
which the entire universe has come
into being. The underlying assump-
tion behind this concept of the subtle
body is thus the harmony of macro-
cosm and microcosm, an essential
Hindu idea since the time of the mys-
tical texts known as the Upanishads.
The six chakras are traditionally
listed from the bottom up, and the
anahata chakra is the fourth. It is visu-
alized as a twelve-petaled lotus locat-
ed in the region of the heart. These
petals each contain a seed syllable
formed from a letter of the Sanskrit
alphabet, in this case the first twelve
consonants. On a symbolic level, the
anahata chakra is associated with the
circulation of blood throughout the
body. It is also identified as the bodily
seat for the subtle element of wind,
the action of which (through the opera-
tion of the five vital winds known as
pranas) is believed to be responsible for
circulating things through the body. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]

Tantra, 1973.Anandamath
Analogy
In certain schools of Indian philosophy,
analogy is considered to be one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate
knowledge. See upamana.
Ananda
(“bliss”) One of the three traditional
attributes of the Supreme Reality
(Brahman), usually described as being-
consciousness-bliss (sacchidananda).
Ananda, or bliss, is heavily stressed in
certain forms of tantra, an esoteric ritu-
al tradition. In tantra, ananda is both an
aspect of mundane physical enjoyment
and a way of describing the ultimate
realization. In this understanding, even
ordinary pleasures are reflections of ulti-
mate bliss. Ultimate bliss differs from
ordinary pleasure both because it is per-
manent, and because you lose your
sense of self and are aware only of bliss.
emphasizes yoga and meditation, which
are intended to set its practitioners on
the path (marga) to bliss (ananda). The
movement is the strongest in the state of
West Bengal, and has been dogged by
controversy in India, particularly after
Anandamurti was indicted for the mur-
der of two of his disciples. In the end he
was acquitted of all charges, but the
organization’s legal troubles made its
members withdraw from society. Many
Indians view them with suspicion, if not
outright hostility, and the movement is
associated with ritual murder and black
magic. In recent times, it has even been
suspected of terrorism, after a large
shipment of black-market arms was
mysteriously parachuted into a nearby
region in early 1995. Although it has
never been proved that the arms were
for the Society, this incident is one more
element in the surrounding cloud of
secrecy and suspicion.
Anandamath
Ananda Akhara
The name of a specific group of the Naga
class of the Dashanami Sanyasis, a par-
ticular type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, organized into six dif-
ferent akharas or regiments on the
model of an army. Until the beginning of
the nineteenth century, the Nagas’ pri-
mary occupation was as mercenary sol-
diers, although they also had substantial
trading interests; both of these occupa-
tions have largely disappeared in con-
temporary times.
For organizational purposes, the
Ananda akhara is considered a sub-
sidiary of the powerful Niranjani
akhara, one of the other seven akharas.
All of the groups have particular
features that define their organizational
identity, especially specific tutelary
deities; the tutelary deity of the Ananda
akhara is fire.
Ananda Marga Yoga Society
Modern Hindu organization founded
by Shri Anandamurti. The Society
Novel by the Bengali nationalist
author Bankim Chandra Chatterjee
(1838–1894). It is set in eighteenth-
century Bengal during the so-called
Sanyasi Rebellion, which invloved
bands of Hindu and Muslim militant
ascetics. Both groups fought with the
British East India Company for con-
trol over the region.
Historical inquiry suggests that the
roots of this conflict lay in the extreme
social tensions in Bengali society,
particularly changes in land ownership
patterns and the havoc wreaked by
the great famine of 1770–1771.
Chatterjee was an ardent Indian nation-
alist and portrayed the Sanyasi
Rebellion as a struggle by Mother India’s
loyal children to expel the parasitic
British invaders from her shores.
Although the novel was set in an earlier
era to avoid problems with the British
authorities, Anandamath is clearly alle-
gorical and nationalistic, and it is viewed
by contemporary critics as Chatterjee’s
way to symbolize the need for continuing
the struggle against British imperialism in
the mid-nineteenth century.
[[35]]
Anandamayi Ma
Anandamayi Ma
(1896–1982) Hindu mystic and saint,
who during her lifetime gained a wide
following in all parts of Hindu society
as a manifestation of the Mother
Goddess. She was born in Dhaka in
modern Bangladesh and from a very
young age showed strong spiritual ten-
dencies. These intensified after her
marriage, when she would slip into
blissful meditation, oblivious to her
surroundings and the passage of time.
The marriage was never consummated
and her husband became one of her
primary disciples. For some time she
lived in an ashram in the city of
Benares, which is famous as a sacred
site (tirtha). Later she built an ashram
just outside the city of Haridwar,
where her samadhi (“burial”) shrine
can be found.
associations: with one of the four Vedas,
with a particular quarter of the Indian
subcontinent, with one of the “great
utterances” (mahavakyas) expressing
ultimate truth, with a specific ascetic
quality, and with several of the ten
Dashanami divisions.
The Anandawara group is affiliated
with the Jyotir Math in the Himalayan
town of Joshimath and is thus connected
with the northern quarter of India. Their
Veda is the Atharva Veda, their
mahavakya is Ayamatma Brahman
(“This Self is Brahman”), and their
ascetic quality is to be satisfied with
whatever food they get without begging,
since they are not attached to worldly
pleasures. The particular Dashanami
divisions associated with this group are
Giri, Parvata, and Sagara.
Ananga
Anandapala
The last great king in the Pratihara
dynasty, which ruled large sections of the
northwestern part of the Indian subcon-
tinent between the eighth and eleventh
centuries. In 1001 C.E., Anandapala
assembled a coalition of Hindu princes
to do battle with Mahmud of Ghazni in a
desperate attempt to halt the latter’s
expansion. Anandapala and his allies
were annihilated in a battle near
Peshawar in modern Pakistan, and the
Pratihara dynasty’s power was completely
destroyed. With this powerful dynasty
out of the way, there was no political
force in northern India strong enough to
stop Mahmud. He began making annual
raids into India.
Anandawara
One of the four major groups of the
Dashanami Sanyasis,
renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; the other three divisions
are
Kitawara,
Bhuriwara,
and
Bhogawara. Each of these groups has its
headquarters in one of the four monastic
centers (maths) supposedly established
by the philosopher Shankaracharya.
Each group also has particular religious
[[36]]

(“bodyless”) Epithet of Kama, a deity
who is the personification of desire.
Kama was given the name Ananga
because his body was destroyed by the
fire from Shiva’s third eye. See Kama.
Ananta
(“endless”) Epithet of Shesha, the god
Vishnu’s serpent couch. See Shesha.
Anantadas
(late 16th c.) Poet and hagiographer
who wrote “introductions” (parchais)
for some of the best-known northern
Indian devotional (bhakti) poet-saints,
among them Ravidas, Kabir, Namdev,
Trilochan, Angada, and Pipa. His era
can be fixed with reasonable assurance
since Anantadas himself gives 1588 C.E.
as the date of composition for his
Namdev Parchai. Anantadas was con-
temporary with another famous
hagiographer,
Nabhadas,
whom
Anantadas names as a “guru brother”
to his own guru, making Nabhadas a
“spiritual uncle” of Anantadas.
Although both hagiographers provide
valuable information, the descriptionsAndal
Anasuya
by Nabhadas are quite brief, whereas
Anantadas gives extended information
about his subjects. Anantadas’s works
are by far the earliest detailed accounts
of these literary figures, although the
marvelous events included in the
introductions render them suspect as
historical sources. Because his collect-
ed works have never been published,
he remains virtually unknown. For fur-
ther information see David Lorenzen,
Kabir Legends and Ananta-Das’s Kabir

Anasuya is begged by the gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva to help them. A
woman named Silavati has cursed the
sun not to rise, and the creatures on
earth are very distressed. Anasuya suc-
ceeds in persuading Silavati to recall her
curse, and in their gratitude the three
gods tell her she can ask for whatever she
wants. Anasuya requests that each be
born as one of her sons, and this is granted:
Vishnu is born as Dattatreya, Shiva as
Durvasas, and Brahma as Chandra.
Anant ChaturdashiAncestral Spirit
Festival falling on the fourteenth day
(chaturdashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September). This festival falls
during the four-month period when the
deity Vishnu is believed to be sleeping
on Shesha, his serpent couch, while his
wife Lakshmi massages his feet. The
festival itself is named after Shesha, one
of whose epithets is Anant (“endless”).
On this day, devotees (bhakta) of Vishnu
should worship and meditate on this
particular image of Vishnu, with Shesha
and Lakshmi.
Before beginning worship, devotees tie
onto their forearm a string dipped in
turmeric, an eastern Indian spice, in
which fourteen knots have been made.
Each of these elements is symbolic: The
string is a symbol of Shesha, the color yel-
low is associated with Vishnu, and the
fourteen knots signify the fourteenth day.
Aside from worshiping Vishnu,
devotees should also fast (upavasa)
on this day. Carefully observing the
requirements for this festival is believed to
ensure prosperity and freedom from exile.
According to mythic tradition, keeping
this vow enables the five Pandava
brothers, the heroes of the epic
Mahabharata, to escape from exile and
regain their kingdom.(pitr) This term is a translation of the
word that literally means “fathers”;
these ancestral spirits are seen as a col-
lective group to whom every man has
duties. One of these duties is to perform
certain memorial rites for them, such as
the rite of sapindikarana. Like most
funerary rites (antyeshthi samskara),
the major objective is to transform the
recently deceased and potentially
malevolent spirit into a benign and
helpful ancestor. Another duty is to pro-
create sons, so that the rites may be
performed without interruption. Both
of these are weighty responsibilities,
and Hindu mythology is replete with
tales of lifelong ascetics, such as
Jaratkaru, who are rebuked by their
ancestral spirits for shirking their duty
to procreate. By virtue of their stable
ancestral status, these spirits are also
well-defined and generally benevolent.
Andal
(9th c.) The only woman among the
Alvars, a group of twelve poet-saints
who lived in southern India between
the seventh and tenth centuries. All the
Alvars were devotees (bhakta) of the
god Vishnu, and their stress on pas-
sionate devotion (bhakti) to a personal
god, conveyed through hymns sung in
the Tamil language, transformed and
revitalized Hindu religious life.
[[37]]
Andhaka
Temple of Venkateshvara in the town of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.
As with many female bhakti figures,
Andal had a particularly passionate rela-
tionship with her chosen deity, whom
she considered her betrothed husband.
This deity was Ranganatha, a particular
form of Vishnu resident at the temple of
Shrirangam in the state of Tamil Nadu.
According to legend, Andal was an
earthly manifestation of Vishnu’s wife
Bhudevi (“Earth Goddess”) and
appeared as an abandoned baby to her
foster father, Periyalvar, another of the
Alvars. When she came of age, she was
adamant that she would have no human
husband and merged into the image of
Ranganatha at Shrirangam.
Although many of the details about
her life are uncertain, Andal did
compose two collections of poetry,
the Tirruppava i and the Nacciyar
Tirumoli, both of which are dedicated
to Vishnu in his form as Krishna. For
further information see Vidya Dehejia
(trans.), Antal and Her Path of Love, 1990.
Andhaka
(“blind”) In Hindu mythology, a
demon born from the darkness that
arises when the goddess Parvati play-
[[38]]

fully covers her husband Shiva’s
eyes with her hands. Shiva names
him Andhaka because he arises from
darkness. Andhaka lusts after Parvati
and continues to pursue her, despite
repeated
remonstrances
that
approaching another man’s wife is
improper. Eventually he goes all the
way to Shiva’s home on Mount Kailas,
where the god kills him.
Andhra
Brahmin subcommunity that is one of
the five southern brahmin communi-
ties (Pancha Dravida). As their name
would indicate, the core region for the
Andhra brahmins is located in the
modern state of Andhra Pradesh.
Andhra Pradesh
Modern southern Indian state. Andhra
Pradesh is one of the so-called linguistic
states formed after independence to
unite people with a common language
and culture (in this case, Telegu) under
one state government.
In the case of Andhra Pradesh, this
was done by combining the princelyAngada
state of Hyderabad with the Telegu-
speaking provinces of the former state
of Madras. This merger did not hap-
pen without some drama; when inde-
pendence arrived, the Nizam of
Hyderabad, a Muslim ruler whose
subjects were mainly Hindus, was ini-
tially reluctant to join the Indian
union, although he acceded after
troops were deployed by the Indian
government. The state capital has
remained at Hyderabad, which is the
largest and most important city.
Andhra Pradesh is overwhelmingly
agricultural, with fertile land in the
Krishna and Godavari river deltas, but
it is relatively undeveloped, and there
is still a great disparity between the
rich and the poor. In recent years it has
become the home of an important
regional political party, the Telegu
Desam, as well as a base for the
Marxist revolutionary group known as
Naxalites, who are carrying on an
armed struggle against the landlords.
Andhra is also home to India’s
richest temple, the temple of
Venkateshvara at Tirupati, and to
Mallikarjuna, one of the twelve jyotir-
lingas, a group of sites especially
sacred to Shiva. For general informa-
tion about Andhra Pradesh and all the
regions of India, an accessible refer-
ence is Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Anekantavada
One of the three causal models in
Indian philosophy, along with
asatkaryavada and satkaryavada. All
three models seek to explain the work-
ings of causality in the everyday world,
particularly the relationship between
causes and their effects, which has
profound implications for religious
life. Philosophical theory assumes
that if one understands the causal
process correctly and can manipulate
it through one’s conscious actions, it
is possible to gain final liberation of
the soul (moksha). Disagreements
over differing causal models are
grounded in varying assumptions
about the nature of things.
The asatkaryavada model assumes
that effects do not preexist in their
causes; the satkaryavada model
assumes that they do. The third model,
Anekantavada (“the view that things
are not single”), seeks to occupy the
middle ground between these two.
Anekantavada stresses how one
looks at things and the way that this
can color a judgment. In viewing the
transformation of milk to curds, butter,
and clarified butter, an anekantavada
proponent would claim that the
substances in question were contained
in the causes (supporting the
satkaryavada notion), but that the
qualities each of these substances pos-
sessed were newly created each time
(supporting the asatkaryavada notion).
Thus, causes and effects are simul-
taneously both the same and different,
depending on the lens through which
one looks at them. This theory is an
attempt to find a middle ground
between the other two causal models
by showing that each is possible, but it
runs the risk of being seen as not taking
any position at all. The major propo-
nents of this position are the Jains, who
are outside the scope of the present
work. For further information see Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Anga
The traditional name for the region
and people of the border area in east-
ern India shared by the modern states
of West Bengal and Bihar.
Angada
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Angada is the son of
the monkey-king Bali and his wife Tara.
Even though Rama, the seventh incar-
nation of Vishnu, has killed his father
under questionable circumstances,
Angada is one of Rama’s loyal allies.
Angada takes part in the search for Sita,
and then in the battle in Lanka to free
[[39]]
Angiras
her, in which his major contribution is
combat with Ravana’s son Meghanada
(an epithet of Indrajit).
After the conquest of Lanka, Rama
appoints Angada as the crown prince
of Kishkindha, a forest in southern
India. Many of the characters in the
Ramayana are paradigms for Indian
cultural values. Angada exhibits
bravery, loyalty, and sincere devotion
to Rama, all of which bring their
eventual rewards.
Angiras
In Hindu mythology, one of the six sons
of Brahma, all of whom become great
sages. All are “mind-born,” meaning that
Brahma’s thoughts are enough to bring
them into being. The others are Marichi,
Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
important and at the time of the Kumbha
Mela take precedence over the others.
Ani
(2) In the region of Tamil, which lies at
the southern tip of the subcontinent on
the Bay of Bengal, the month of Ani is
the third month of the solar year. It cor-
responds to the northern Indian solar
month of Mithuna (the zodiacal sign of
Gemini), which usually falls within June
and July. The existence of several differ-
ent calendars is one clear sign of the
continuing importance of regional cul-
tural patterns. One way that the Tamils
retain their culture is by preserving their
traditional calendar. Tamil is one of the
few regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Angkor
Temple complex built in northwestern
Cambodia by the Khmer ruler
Suryavarman II (1112–1153 C.E.). The
Khmer people were indigenous to
Kampuchea, but the temples at Angkor
were dedicated to Hindu gods. This
reflects the prodigious influence of
Hindu culture, which by the end of the
first millennium C.E. had been spread
throughout Southeast Asia by Indian
(primarily southern Indian) merchants
and traders.Aniconic Image
Ani(“minuteness”) One of the eight super-
human powers (siddhi) traditionally
believed to be conferred as a result of
high spiritual attainment. This particu-
lar power gives one the ability to
become as small as an atom.
(according to tradition, a shortened form
of the Sanskrit word anika, meaning
“army”) A major organizational division
of the Bairagi Nagas, ascetic traders and
mercenary soldiers who were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu. At present
there are three Bairagi anis: the
Digambara, Nirmohi, and Nirvani. In
earlier times these anis were actual
fighting units, but in modern times these
distinctions are mainly important
to determine bathing (snana) order
in the bathing processions at the
Kumbha Mela. Of the three anis,
the Digambaras are by far the most
[[40]]

A symbol that is meant to represent a
deity. Although it is more common for
human or animal likenesses to stand for
deities, some deities are represented by
symbols or non-pictorial images.
Examples of this would be the linga or
the shalagram, both of which are well-
known symbolic forms of particular
deities—Shiva and Vishnu, respectively.
Anima
Animals
In the Hindu religion, it is believed
that some human beings can be
reincarnated as animals. According to
generally held notions about karma,
being born as an animal is an
unfavorable rebirth in punishment for a
previous grave sin. One is born as an
animal to expiate, or atone for, one’s evilAniruddha
deeds through suffering, in many cases
by being born as a particular type of
animal thousands of consecutive times.
Unlike the Jains, who see all matter
(even stones) as possessing souls, most
Hindus would consider this possible
only for sentient, or fully aware, beings,
including animal life. The conviction
that animals have souls is one of the rea-
sons why many Hindus are vegetarian,
since this diet does the least harm to
other living things.
For Hindus, the animal realm is con-
sidered a place of punishment. From a
karmic perspective, being born as an
animal is an unenviable state, since ani-
mal behavior is run entirely by instinct,
and thus as animals they can make no
conscious effort to better themselves.
From a more concrete perspective, ani-
mals in India often lead very difficult
lives—including, in many cases, the
“sacred” cow.
As with all other unfavorable karmic
states, one’s animal life will eventually
end, but only after one’s sins have been
fully expiated. This suffering and lack of
control over one’s destiny makes birth as
an animal a state to be avoided.
Animal Sacrifice
The practice of animal sacrifice can be
found in two different strands of the
Hindu tradition. The first, and by far the
earliest, is in the cult of sacrifice described
in the later strata of the Vedas, particularly
in the Brahmana literature. The cost of
these rites virtually ensured that they
could only be performed by royalty and
nobility, since some entailed the slaughter
of hundreds of animals.
Perhaps the most famous of these rites
was the horse sacrifice (ashvamedha),
which served to prove a king’s great power.
In the early centuries before the common
era, these sacrifices grew less frequent—a
trend often connected to the stress on
ahimsa by the Buddhists and Jains, two
groups that opposed the slaughter of any
life—and by the early centuries of the
common era, even Hindu commentators
denounced the Vedic sacrifices because
they entailed animal slaughter. In modern
times, these rites have largely fallen into
disuse, and even when they have been
revived and re-created, they usually do not
involve animal slaughter but substitutions
of some sort, such as vegetables or fruits.
The other context in which animal sac-
rifice can be found, and is still performed
quite regularly, is in the worship of village
deities, or certain powerful and terrifying
forms of the Goddess. In this worship the
animals (usually goats) are decapitated,
and the blood is offered to the deity, often
by smearing some of it on a post outside of
the temple.
In Hindu culture, blood is considered
a “hot” substance—highly impure,
extremely powerful, and readily contami-
nating other things. Any deity that
requires sacrifice is also “hot”—powerful
enough to grant favors to their devotees
(bhakta), but also marginal, potentially
dangerous, and requiring frequent animal
sacrifice to maintain their power.
The most extreme example is at the
temple of the goddess Kamakhya in
modern Assam, a region located in
northeastern India. This is one of the few
reported instances of human sacrifice,
although the custom was halted by the
British in 1832. When Kamakhya’s present
temple was consecrated in 1565, she was
supposedly offered the heads of 140 men,
all of whom had volunteered themselves
as offerings.
Although such blood-drinking deities
are often very powerful, many Hindus do
not approve of the impurity (ashaucha)
and slaughter connected with animal sac-
rifice. For this reason, one of the first ways
to make a particular deity acceptable to a
more cultured public is often to make the
sacrifices vegetarian, by substituting a
gourd or cucumber in place of the sacrifi-
cial animal.
Aniruddha
(“unobstructed”) In Hindu mythology,
the son of Pradyumna and the grand-
son of Krishna.
[[41]]
Anirvachaniyakhyati
Anirvachaniyakhyati
(“indescribable discrimination”) This
is a particular theory of error that
aims to explain why people make
errors in judgment, such as the stock
example of mistaking the silvery flash
of a seashell for a piece of silver. This
theory was advanced by the philo-
sophical school of Advaita Vedanta, a
group that would consider this judg-
ment to be a false one; they would also
believe, however, that until one real-
izes that the object is just a shell, one
actually sees the silver there.
The Advaita theory of error is based
on the fundamental concept of super-
imposition (adhyasa), in which one
perceives something that is actually
there (in this case, the shell). This
real object is the basis for the illusory
perception (the silver), which is a
mistaken projection. The Advaitins
claim that the “silver” is real insofar
as it is based on the shell, and false
insofar as one believes it to be
precious metal.
Of course, according to the
Advaitins, the shell and all the other
“real” things of the world are them-
selves ultimately illusory since they
are superimposed on Brahman, the
only thing in the universe that is truly
real. For further information see
Bijayananda Kar, The Theories of Error
in Indian Philosophy, 1990; and Karl
H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Anjali Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
the anjali hasta is a particular hand
gesture (hasta) in which the palms of the
two hands are joined together with the
fingers pointing upward, often with the
base of the thumbs resting against the
chest. This gesture conveys respect and
prayerful devotion.
In modern India this is also the
most common gesture of greeting and
salutation. Since traditional Indian society
was (and to some extent, remains) so
[[42]]

intensely conscious of purity, it is not
surprising that this greeting can convey
respect without requiring one to touch
another person, which could transmit
impurity (ashaucha) from one person
to another.
Anjana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, Anjana is the
mother of the monkey-deity Hanuman.
In her previous birth, Anjana was a
goddess, but as the result of a curse, she
is born as a monkey. With the birth of
Hanuman (fathered by Vayu, the god of
wind), the curse was lifted and she
returned to heaven.
Ankusha
(“elephant goad”) This is a weapon with
a wooden or metal handle, with a point
and a sharp hook that real elephant han-
dlers use to coax and goad elephants—
sometimes by poking them with the
hook, sometimes by hitting them with
the butt of the handle.
The ankusha is an important symbol
in Hindu iconography and is primarily
associated with the god Ganesh—per-
haps partly because of his elephant head.
This weapon also corresponds with
Ganesh’s stature as the Lord of Obstacles,
since he can use the ankusha to poke
and prod them out of the way.
Aside from Ganesh, the ankusha is
also a symbol associated with certain
powerful forms of the Goddess. This
may originate with the myth that
describes her as being formed from the
collected radiance of all the gods, and
receiving duplicates of their weapons
from them.
Annakut
(“Mountain of food”) Northern Indian
festival celebrated on the day after the
festival of Diwali (October–November).
This festival is more popularly known as
Govardhan Puja.Annaprashana (“food-eating”) Samskara
A woman displays the anjali hasta hand gesture.
This gesture conveys respect and is a common greeting and salutation.
Annaprashana
(“food-eating”) Samskara
Traditionally, this is the seventh of the
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras) in
which the young child is first given
solid food. In many of the traditional
texts on dharma, the Dharma Shastras,
parents are directed to feed the child
animal flesh. In modern times children
are more commonly fed rice; as the
most popular grain in much of
India, rice can be considered a symbol
for food in general.
[[43]]
Anrta
As in any society, the introduction of
solid food marks a major transition in
the infant’s young life, even though the
infant may not wean for some time after
that. Unlike many of the traditional
samskaras, this is still an important
childhood rite in modern India.
Anrta
In the Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures
that are still the most authoritative reli-
gious texts, anrta is characterized as the
opposite of rta, the cosmic order. Anrta is
particularly associated with falsehood and
untruth, and it involves acts of deliberate
perversions of speech. Hindus believe that
these mistruths undermine the estab-
lished order of the cosmos.
such cases the king’s first wife would gen-
erally have higher status, since this mar-
riage would often be used to cement a
political alliance.
Antarala
(“intermediate space”) The antarala
was a transitional space between a
temple’s main hall and the inner sanc-
tum (garbhagrha), where the image of
the temple’s primary deity would be
housed. The antarala is characteristic
of Nagara architecture, which is one
of three primary styles of Hindu tem-
ples. This space was found only in the
largest temples and in many smaller
ones was omitted entirely.
Antariksha
Anshavatar
A “partial” (amsha) incarnation of a divin-
ity, which is believed to have only part of
the divine power. See also avatar.
Anshuman
In Hindu mythology, the grandson of King
Sagar. After the death of his sixty thou-
sand uncles, who because of their disre-
spect were killed by the sage Kapila,
Anshuman was the sole surviving mem-
ber of the royal line. Anshuman and Dilip,
his son, labored mightily to bring the
Ganges (the earthly embodiment of the
goddess Ganga) from heaven down to
earth, so that by her touch the souls of
their relatives might find peace. Their
efforts were unsuccessful, but Dilip’s son
Bhagirath was finally able to bring the
Ganges to earth.
Antahpura
(“inner city”) In classical times, the name
for the women’s quarters of the palace, so
designated because they were the most
stringently protected. Although most
Hindus had only one wife, in earlier times
it was not uncommon for kings to have a
number of wives and concubines, who
would be housed in the antahpura. In
[[44]]

In the cosmology found in the Vedas,
the earliest Hindu scripture, the antarik-
sha is the middle region of the sky
between the earth and fixed stars; it cor-
responds to what might now be called
the atmosphere. This region is consid-
ered the theater of activity for Indra, god
of the storm and the most important
Vedic deity; it is also home to one mani-
festation of the Vedic god Agni (fire), in
his form as lightning.
Antaryaga
(“internal sacrifice”) In Hindu worship,
but especially in the secret ritual tradi-
tion known as tantra, antaryaga refers
to the internalization of worship. In this
process, worship involving external
actions is replaced by worship based on
mental acts.
This is a later phase of the initiate’s
spiritual path, and is attempted only
after the initiate has mastered the exter-
nal forms of worship. The process of
internalization becomes progressively
more subtle and sophisticated. This step
also demonstrates that the initiate has
achieved more highly developed reli-
gious capacities, in which external
objects are no longer needed.Antyeshthi (“last rites”) Samskara
A woman prepares a deceased man for cremation.
This ritual is one stage of the antyeshthi samskara, the traditional Hindu funerary rites.
Antinomianism
This word has its origins in the convic-
tions of an early Christian sect, whose
members believed that the only thing
needed for salvation was faith, and
not obedience to moral rules. In an
extended sense, this term describes
an attitude in which people ignore
accepted social rules.
In Indian society (as in all societies)
most people uphold the accepted
behavioral norms, but certain groups—
particularly renunciant ascetics and
practitioners of tantra, a secret ritual
tradition—emphasize the breaking of
society’s normally held rules. For the
ascetics, such intentional disregard was
(and is) a symbol of their separateness
from conventional society; they believe
that such rules no longer apply to them.
As a class, ascetics are well-known for
their unpredictable and sometimes
uncontrolled behavior.
The process is more controlled for
practitioners of tantra and most often
takes place in a formal ritual setting.
The stereotypical pattern is to partake
of the “five forbidden things”
(panchamakara), thus consciously
breaking societal norms by consuming
intoxicants and nonvegetarian foods, as
well as practicing illicit sexuality.
Although
tantric
antinomianism
deliberately breaks social taboos, in
theory it is an attempt to make sacred
what is normally forbidden. By doing this,
tantric practitioners destroy embedded
dualistic ideas that are exemplified by
notions such as pure and impure.
From a tantric perspective, the entire
universe is one principle—often the
activity of a particular deity—which
means that one must reject all concepts
based on dualistic thinking. Such
practices are also seen as proof that
tantra is superior to other sorts of
religious activities, since it uses things
that are normally forbidden. For
further information see Arthur Avalon
(Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and Shakta,
[[1978]]
; Swami Agehananda Bharati,
The Tantric Tradition, 1977; and
Douglas Renfrew Brooks, The Secret
of the Three Cities, 1990.
Antyeshthi (“last rites”) Samskara
The sixteenth and last of the traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras),
comprising what can be described as
[[45]]
Anulepana
funerary rites. These rites are not a sin-
gle action, but a series: deathbed rites
for the dying person, cremation for the
corpse, asthi-sanchayana (gathering
the ashes), sapindikarana (assimilation
to the ancestors), various memorial rites
known as shraddhas, and asthi-
visarjana (immersing the ashes in
a sacred river).
These rites have a twofold purpose.
The first is to get rid of the corpse,
which is a source of contagion and
impurity (ashaucha), and thus to pro-
tect the living from the dead. The sec-
ond is to ease the passage of the dead
person’s spirit into the next world.
Aside from these functions, perform-
ing familiar and ceremonial rites for
the dead undoubtedly gives psycho-
logical relief to the living and aids in
the process of grieving. What follows is
merely an overview of these rites; for
more detailed information see the
individual entries.
Ritual activities are the most con-
centrated during the first ten days
after death, which is believed to be the
period
of
greatest
impurity.
Cremation usually takes place on the
day of death, not only to prevent
decay and disease in a hot climate but
also to destroy the body so it will not
be reanimated by a wandering spirit.
Gathering the ashes (asthi-san-
chayana) is done on the second or
third day. In earlier times they would
have been kept in a safe place, some-
times for years, until a relative visiting
a sacred river could perform asthi-vis-
arjana (immersing the ashes); with the
advent of modern transportation, this
is generally performed a few days
after death.
During this ten-day period, the
spirit is given symbolic nourishment to
help build a “new” body. On the
eleventh day, the family performs the
first of the memorial ceremonies
known as shraddhas; in this case an
ekoddishta shraddha is performed in
which brahmin guests, considered
surrogates for the ancestors, are fed.
On the twelfth day after death, the
[[46]]

family
performs
the
rite
of
sapindikarana, through which the
deceased is incorporated into the
ranks of the ancestral spirits (pitr) and
is thus no longer considered a restless
spirit. This is followed by anniversary
shraddhas at regular intervals during
the first year; after this period there is
an annual shraddha once a year during
the Pitrpaksha (“fortnight of the
ancestors”), the waning moon period
in the lunar month of Bhadrapada
(August–September), which is solely
devoted to such memorials. For further

(eds.), Religious Encounters with
Death, 1977; Lawrence Babb, The

Grodzins Gold, Fruitful Journeys, 1988.
Anulepana
(“smearing”) The ninth of the sixteen
traditional upacharas offered to a deity
as part of worship, which are meant to
treat the deity as an honored guest. In
this offering, the deity is presented
scented unguents, or ointments, such as
sandalwood paste. These ointments are
not only used for their fragrance but are
also believed to be good for the skin.
Anuloma
(“with the hair”) See hypergamous
marriage.
Anumana
(“measuring after”) In Indian philoso-
phy this is the term for an inference,
which is generally accepted as one of the
pramanas, the means by which human
beings can gain true and accurate knowl-
edge. The word’s literal meaning reflects
the Indian conviction that any inferenceAnyathakhyati
must be grounded in perception
(pratyaksha), the most direct means of
knowledge, and must ultimately appeal
to perception for evidence.
A classic inference includes three
terms: a hypothesis (pratijna), a rea-
son (hetu), and examples (drshtanta),
each of which is made up of parts.
One part of the hypothesis is the idea
to be proved (sadhya), which is predi-
cated on a certain class of objects,
called the paksha. In the statement
“there is fire on this mountain,” the
sadhya is the assertion that there is
fire, and the paksha is the particular
mountain. The object mentioned in
the paksha must also appear in the
second term, the hetu, along with the
stated reason. In the example cited
above, the hetu could be “because
there is smoke on this mountain.”
As proof, it was necessary to cite pos-
itive and negative examples, known as
the sapaksha and vipaksha, respectively.
An appropriate sapaksha could be “like
kitchen,” since ancient kitchens had
both fire and smoke; a vipaksha could be
“unlike lake,” since lakes contain neither

Anushtubh
By far the most widely used meter in
Sanskrit poetry, composed of two
lines of sixteen syllables each with
eight syllables per half line. The metric
pattern for each half line is based on
the distinction between “heavy” and
“light” syllables. A heavy syllable is any
syllable with a long vowel or conso-
nant cluster; all other syllables are
light. According to the prescribed pat-
tern, the fifth syllable of each half line
should be light, the sixth heavy, and
the seventh alternately heavy and
light. The anushtubh’s simplicity
makes it the meter of choice for many
religious texts, including much of the
Bhagavad Gita.
Anyathakhyati
(“discrimination of something else”)
A theory of error that aims to explain
why people make errors in judgment,
such as the stock example of mistak-
ing the flash of a seashell for a piece
of silver. This particular theory of
error originated with the Naiyayika
philosophical school. Like the Purva
Mimamsa philosopher Prabhakara,
the Naiyayikas believe that the simple
judgments “that object is silvery” and
“silver is silvery” are both true and
indisputable. Whereas Prabhakara
explains the error as an error of omis-
sion, in which one fails to notice the
non-relationship between these judg-
ments, the Naiyayikas explain this as
an error of commission, by projecting
something that actually is not there.
In Naiyayikan metaphysics all
objects and their attributes are con-
nected by a dependent relationship
known as inherence (samavaya),
which in this case connects a silvery
color with two different objects: ele-
mental silver, and a shell. They believe
that the perceiver is projecting a wrong
inherence relationship (silver) onto the
perceived object (shell).
The Naiyayikas can claim this
projection is real because they
accept the reality of nonexistent
things (e.g., the nonexistence of
a crocodile in my bathtub). For
the Naiyayikas all such projections
are rooted in karmic dispositions
stemming from avidya, or primal
ignorance, specifically the greed
for silver that prompts people to
look for such items of value. For

Apabhramsha
(ed.), Presuppositions
Philosophies, 1972.
of
India’s
Apabhramsha
(“fallen away”) An important northern
Indian Prakrit, one of the vernacular
languages that developed naturally
from Sanskrit. Apabhramsha was the
latest addition to the Middle Indo-
Aryan languages and is considered a
direct precursor of early modern Hindi,
which was becoming established as
early as the twelfth century. Although
Apabhramsha has lesser status than
Sanskrit, it was nevertheless an impor-
tant regional literary language.
Apaddharma
Religious protocol that comes into effect
in times of distress, disturbance, natural
disaster, or social deterioration. The
practical effect of apaddharma is to sus-
pend most of the normal social rules,
particularly those governing interaction
and commensality between different
social subgroups (jatis). In ordinary cir-
cumstances these rules are affected by
concepts of purity, impurity (ashaucha),
and relative social status.
The underlying message here is
that the preservation of life is more
important than such rules, and that
they can be broken to save a life—as in
the case of escaping a fire or flood, in
which the usual concerns about phys-
ical contact with lower-status people
are suspended.
Apana
One of the five bodily “winds” consid-
ered to be responsible for basic bodily
functions, the others being prana,
vyana, udana, and samana. The apana
wind is believed to exist in the region of
the anus and is associated with dis-
charging material out of the body: urine,
feces, gas, semen, menstrual discharges,
and the birth of children.
[[48]]

Apastamba
(4th c. B. C . E .?) Sage, writer, and
commentator. Apastamba is known for
his influential work with the Kalpa
Sutra form, a type of text that consists
of three essential elements: instruc-
tions for Vedic rituals (Shrauta
Sutras), for domestic rites (Grhya
Sutras), and for suitable human
behavior (Dharma Sutras).
He is one of three authors, along
with Baudhayana and Hiranyakeshin,
who wrote complete Kalpa Sutras with
all three parts. All three of these
men belonged to the same school,
the Taittiriya school of the Black
Yajur Veda.
Apastamba’s Dharma Sutra is
extremely significant, for it is consid-
ered one of the major sources for the
law code attributed to Manu. This
code was an important legal docu-
ment even in the early twentieth cen-
tury, since India’s British rulers
considered it a source of “traditional”
Hindu law.
Appar
(7th c. C.E.) One of the earliest of the
Nayanars, a group of southern Indian
poet-saints who were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva. The Nayanars helped
to revitalize the Hindu religion through
their passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language.
Historians believe that Appar was born
into a Shaivite family but became a Jain
ascetic in his youth. The turning point
came when he suffered a serious illness.
Discouraged when Jain medicines were
unable to cure his illness, he prayed to
Shiva for help and was cured.
Along with his younger contemporary
Sambandar, Appar actively confronted
and opposed the heterodox sects of the
times, particularly the Jains, with open
defiance, debates, and miracles. His great-
est achievement is reported to have been
the conversion of King Mahendravarman
(r. 600–630 C.E.), one of the greatest kingsAranya Dashanami
in the Pallava dynasty, from Jainism
to Shaivism.
The collected hymns of the three most
important Nayanars—Appar, Sambandar,
and Sundaramurtti—comprise the
Devaram, the most sacred of the Tamil
Shaivite texts.
Appaya Dikshita
Sixteenth-century writer and commenta-
tor in the Bhamati branch of the Advaita
Vedanta philosophical school.
Aprashasta
(“reprehensible”) Marriages
According to the texts on religious duty
(dharma) known as the Dharma
Shastras, these are the four forms of
marriage subject to disapproval: the
asura marriage, gandharva marriage,
rakshasa marriage, and paishacha
marriage. Although all of these are
considered reprehensible, this disap-
proval comes in differing measures:
the asura (paying money for a bride)
and gandharva (betrothal by mutual
consent) marriages are tolerated,
while the rakshasa (forcible abduction)
and paishacha (taking advantage
of an insentient woman) forms
are forbidden.
Despite such harsh condemnation,
all of these marriages are held to be
legally valid. It is generally agreed that
this position was intended not to legiti-
matize unconscionable actions but to
give the woman the legal rights of a wife,
whatever the circumstances of her mar-
riage. The asura marriage is the only one
of these forms still practiced in modern
times, although it is done only by people
who are either very poor or of very low
social status.
become too powerful. Because ascetics
practice celibacy, and it is assumed
that celibacy builds spiritual power,
successful ascetics can become rivals
to the gods themselves. Sexual activity
will quickly exhaust the ascetic’s power,
although it can often bring other bene-
fits to the world, including the birth of
children, which always results from
such intimate encounters.
The apsaras are sent on their mis-
sions by Indra, the king of heaven,
since any ascetic who gains too much
power will be able to claim Indra’s
divine throne. One famous apsara is
Menaka, whose seduction of the
sage Vishvamitra results in the birth
of Shakuntala. Another is Urvashi,
who is renowned for her dalliance with
King Pururavas.
Apurva
According to the Purva Mimamsa
philosophical school, apurva is an
unseen force created by action—par-
ticularly ritual action. This unseen
force exists from the beginning of the
action to the result of that action, and
it invariably brings the intended result
into being. This doctrine was devel-
oped to connect actions with their
results, particularly when the result
came some time after the initial action,
and is especially relevant to karma.
The Mimamsas developed the concept
of the apurva because they wanted to sup-
port information found in the Vedas,
which in many cases specifies that certain
actions will eventually produce specific
results. For further information see
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A.
Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Aranya Dashanami
Apsara
In Hindu mythology, a class of celestial
nymphs renowned for their beauty,
grace, and irresistible attractiveness.
One of their main mythic functions is
to seduce ascetics and sages when they
One of the ten divisions of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, ascetics who
are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva. The
Dashanamis were supposedly estab-
lished by the ninth-century philoso-
pher Shankaracharya in an effort to

create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life.
Each of the divisions is designated
by a different name—in this case,
aranya (“forest”). Upon initiation,
new members are given this name
as a surname to their new ascetic
names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are
divided into four larger organizational
groups. Each group has its headquar-
ters in one of the four monastic
centers (maths) also established
by Shankaracharya. The Aranya
Dashanamis belong to the Bhogawara
group, which is affiliated with the
Govardhan Math in the city of Puri,
on the Bay of Bengal.
[[50]]

Aranyaka
(“Forest books”) General designation for
a type of literature contained in the
sacred texts known as the Vedas. The
Aranyakas are transitional in nature; in
their content they move away from the
focus on ritual and sacrifice found in
the Brahmana literature and foreshad-
ow the later, more speculative texts
known as the Upanishads.
Because of their name, the
Aranyakas are widely believed to have
been composed in the forests, perhaps
by ascetics who had left formal soci-
ety. The tone in these texts is question-
ing and speculative, and in stylistic
terms there is no clear break between
the Aranyakas and the Upanishads:
one of the earliest upanishads is
named
Brhadaranyaka
(“Great
Forest-Book”) Upanishad, which rein-
forces the connection.Architecture
Arati
The act of waving a lighted lamp before
a deity. The deity may be present
in many forms, such as a picture,
statue, symbol (svayambhu image)
such as the shalagram, or even a
natural phenomenon such as a river, as
in the case of the Ganges.
The arati lamp usually is a shallow
vessel holding a cotton wick soaked in
oil or clarified butter, with a ring-shaped
handle to protect one’s hands. This is
one of the sixteen traditional offerings
(upacharas) presented to a deity as part
of worship. This particular act is the
offering of light.
Arati is arguably the single most
common act of Hindu worship, per-
formed daily in Hindu homes and
temples throughout the world. Because
of this fact, the word arati is sometimes
used to refer to any act of worship,
even singing panegyric hymns during
worship. Before electric lights were
invented, when the temples were much
darker, arati also served to give the
devotees (bhakta) in the temples a
better view of the deity, which was
very important.
Aravalli Hills
A range of hills running diagonally from
the southwestern to the northeastern
corner of Rajasthan. They are important
for their physical characteristics, which
have a profound effect on the environ-
ment. On the northern side of the hills,
the land slopes gently into the Thar
desert and is arid and thinly settled. On
the southern side, the hills provide
more protection. As a result the land is
greener and comparatively richer than
on the northern side.
Sacred sites (tirthas) in the Aravallis
include the town of Pushkar, with its
holy lake, as well as the temple devoted
to Balaji, which is located in the village
of Mehndipur.
Archana
(“salutation”) Rites of welcome and
reverence, usually performed during
formal worship of a deity in a temple. In
a larger sense, this word can also refer to
those rites of reverence and salutation
performed for one’s elders, superiors, or
any honored guest.
Architecture
Hindu temple architecture in India has
developed over time into several dis-
tinct, mature styles. The earliest phases
are based on early Buddhist architectur-
al forms, such as the rock-cut cave tem-
ple (chaitya) or enclosed courtyard
(vihara). Some of these early Hindu
rock-cut temples include those at Ellora
and Elephanta; others are free-standing
but based on this form, as at Aihole.
Later Hindu architecture has three
basic styles: Nagara, Dravida, and
Veshara, of which the first two are the
most important. Each of these styles is
found in a certain area of India: the
Nagara in the north and east, the Dravida
in the south, and the Veshara in the west
and in Deccan. The basic differences
between them can be simplified to the
different styles of the temple towers.
The Nagara style emphasizes verti-
cality, with the whole temple building
culminating in a single highest point.
Different emphases in the ways of
treating the tower led to different
substyles: In the temples at Khajuraho,
the entire structure gradually leads up
to the central tower, whereas the
Orissa style stresses a single enormous
tower surrounded by much smaller
subsidiary parts.
In the Dravida style, the towers tend
to be composed of horizontal tiers, with
the visual emphasis on horizontal rather
than vertical. In the later Dravida
temples, the tallest structures are the
gopurams, the central gateways in
the walls enclosing the temples. A
Dravida-style temple may have a fairly
modest tower over the central shrine, but
the area covered by the temple is often
enormous, and many of them are cities in
their own right.
The Veshara style has a barrel roof
over the sanctuary, an architectural
[[51]]
Ardha (“Half”) Kumbha Mela
advanced halfway through the zodiac
toward the next full Kumbha Mela. It is
generally celebrated only at Allahabad
and Haridwar, marking the greater
importance of these two sites.
Although the full Kumbha Mela is
deemed more auspicious and gets
much larger attendance, the Ardha
Kumbha Mela is still attended by mil-
lions of pilgrims.
Ardhamandapa
(“half pavilion”) In the later Nagara style
of temple architecture, the ardhaman-
dapa was the entrance porch of the tem-
ple, which formed a transitional area
between the outside world and the
mandapa, or hall.
Ardhanarishvara

feature with roots in the Buddhist
chaityas (rock-cut cave temples). This
architectural style is midway between the
Nagara towers and the Dravida tiers.
Ardha (“Half”) Kumbha Mela
A religious celebration secondary to
the Kumbha Mela. The Kumbha Mela
is a gigantic religious festival that
entails bathing (snana) in sacred
rivers. It is celebrated at four sacred
sites (tirthas): Haridwar, Allahabad,
Ujjain, and Nasik. It occurs approxi-
mately every twelve years, based on
the position of the planet Jupiter in
the zodiac.
The Ardha Kumbha Mela is cele-
brated six years after the full (purna)
Kumbha Mela, when Jupiter has
[[52]]

(“the deity who is half woman”)
Particular form of the god Shiva, in
which the left side of the image has
female form, dress, and ornamentation,
and the right side has male characteris-
tics and dress.
The image has several possible inter-
pretations. As a divinity one of Shiva’s
attributes is his ability to transcend all
duality, and this half-woman, half-man
image symbolizes that power over even
the most basic human difference, sexual
identity. In the context of the esoteric
ritual tradition known as tantra, which
describes the universe as the product of
the interaction between the divine prin-
ciples of awareness (Shiva) and power
(Shakti), this image symbolizes not only
the radically different natures of these
two principles, but also their insepara-
bility in action.
The Ardhanarishvara is sometimes
referred to as the androgyne; this term
seems inappropriate, however, since
the image does not show the loss
of sexual characteristics associated
with androgyny but rather the full
development of each on their respec-
tive sides.Arjuna
Arghya
The fourth of the sixteen traditional
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a deity
as a part of worship. The upacharas are
based on the model of treating the deity
as an honored guest. The word arghya
literally means “to be respected”; in this
offering the image is given a drink of
water or some other beverage as a sign
of respect.
The actual act of offering can be
done in various ways and often depends
on the worshiper’s preferences. In some
cases the water vessel will simply be pre-
sented before the deity’s image, with the
understanding that the deity has taken
it, whereas in other cases the devotee
(bhakta) will actually give some water to
the image. In either case the underlying
motive is to show love for the deity and
to minister to its needs.
Arjuna
The third of the five Pandava brothers in
the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics. Arjuna is born when
his mother, Kunti, uses a powerful
mantra to have a son by Indra, the king
of the gods.
Arjuna is the prototypical kshatriya
warrior-king. He is described as peerless
in battle, a hero ever ready to defend the
truth, and a person always faithful to his
word—but at times arrogant, egocen-
tric, quick to anger, and inclined to use
force to settle disputes.
Arjuna is most famous as an archer,
as which he has no equal. When he and
his brothers are studying archery with
their teacher Drona, Arjuna outshines
them all with his dedication and ability,
but his spiteful side can be seen in the
story of Ekalavya. Ekalavya is a tribal
boy who wants to learn archery from
Drona, the royal archery teacher, but is
refused because of his low birth.
Undaunted, Ekalavya makes a clay
image of Drona, treats it as his teacher
(guru), and through his assiduous prac-
tice and his devotion to his guru
becomes the most skilled archer on
earth. When Arjuna discovers this, he
becomes jealous and complains to
Drona, since the teacher has promised
Arjuna that no one will surpass him as
an archer. Drona asks Ekalavya how he
has become so skillful, and when he
learns that Ekalavya has worshiped
Drona’s image as his guru, Drona notes
that he is entitled to a preceptor’s fee
(dakshina). As his fee he requests
Ekalavya’s right thumb, a gift that will
considerably diminish Ekalavya’s
shooting abilities since its loss will
impair his ability to draw a bow.
Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish without
hesitation but from that day on he is no
longer better than Arjuna.
Another instance of Arjuna’s narrow-
mindedness comes in his claim that
another great rival, Karna, cannot com-
pete in a royal shooting competition
because Karna is a foundling, and his
lineage is thus unknown. Karna is a
close companion of Arjuna’s cousin
Duryodhana, and because of this insult
the relations begin to deteriorate
between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the two branches of this
extended family. The final result is the
fratricidal civil war that is the climax of
the epic.
Throughout the Mahabharata,
Arjuna is associated with numerous
heroic exploits. To fulfill a promise given
to his teacher Drona, Arjuna defeats
King Drupada, who has earlier insulted
Drona. Through a feat of archery, he
wins the hand of Draupadi by drawing a
bow that others cannot even lift and
then hits a target suspended in the air.
He aids the fire god, Agni, in the burning
of the Khandava forest. He shields Agni
from the rain by creating a tent of arrows
that keeps the forest covered. During the
year that the Pandavas spend incognito,
after twelve years of exile in the forest,
Arjuna takes the guise of the eunuch
Brhannala and in this guise wins a great
battle against the Kauravas.
His greatest exploits occur during the
epic’s climactic eighteen-day war, in
which he defeats the Kaurava armies,
fights all their major figures, and finally
[[53]]
Arranged Marriage
kills his long-standing adversary Karna,
who is actually his own half brother.
After destroying the Kauravas in
the Mahabharata war, Arjuna serves
his elder brother, Yudhishthira,
who becomes king; after the conflict,
however, the need for such a warrior
has passed.
Arjuna is also known as a listener. At
the moment when the great war is about
to begin, Arjuna has sudden doubts
about the propriety of killing his friends
and relatives, even during a just war. To
allay his doubts and to help him regain
his resolve, his charioteer Krishna
recites the Bhagavad Gita, one of the
single most influential Hindu religious
texts. The Gita’s advice on the nature of
Self, struggle, and the search for God has
served to counsel those fighting literal
and metaphorical battles, most notably
Mohandas K. Gandhi during the struggle
for Indian independence.
Arranged Marriage
A marriage that is arranged by the
parents of the bride and groom,
although it has become fairly common
for the prospective couple to meet
beforehand to assess whether or not
they are compatible.
Although this practice seems strange
by mainstream American standards,
proponents of arranged marriages see
them as better and longer lasting than
love marriages. It is assumed that with
arranged marriages parents will be able
to take a more detached and rational
perspective. They will usually choose
spouses who come from similar social
and economic backgrounds, in many
cases from the same jati, or social sub-
group. Parents may compare their chil-
dren’s horoscopes for clues, and they
may also try to match people with com-
patible personalities. Ideally, all of this is
done with great care and with the
understanding that their highest priori-
ty will be their children’s long-term wel-
fare. Marriage is widely seen as the most
important event in a person’s life since it
is the basis of family life, and the family
[[54]]

is the foundation of society. Part of the
marriage negotiations between the two
sides includes whether or not the bride
will have a dowry, and if she will, what
this will be.
One of the assumptions with
arranged marriages is that men and
women will play fairly traditional roles.
This gives the couple some idea of what
to expect and what is expected of them,
but it can also be confining for people
who do not wish to fulfill such roles. At
least in northern India, the adjustments
often fall much more heavily on the new
bride, since she will become part of her
husband’s family.
Arranged marriages are still extremely
popular among modern Hindu families,
and many young people would not
dream of fixing their own marriages. A
practical consideration supporting the
popularity of arranged marriages is that
it is often difficult for young people to
meet and develop the friendships that
could lead to love marriages. Indian
society is still very sex segregated. Social
interaction between unrelated single
men and women is still uncommon in
villages and smaller towns, although this
pattern is breaking down in larger cities
since more women are working outside
the home.
In both contexts the biggest mixing
place tends to be the college or
university, but even there women and
men tend to associate in groups
rather than as individuals. In a society
in which contact is limited, and formal
dating even more unusual, an arranged
marriage is often the best way to find
a compatible spouse.
Arsha Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform
a marriage recognized in the Dharma
Shastras, the treatises on religious
duty (dharma). In an arsha marriage,
the bride’s father receives a pair of cattle
from the bridegroom with the under-
standing that the cattle are to be used
for sacrifice.Arthashastra
This was regarded as one of the four
approved forms of marriage (prashasta
marriages) but fell out of favor because
of the stigma of accepting any sort of gift
for the bride, even one explicitly desig-
nated for sacrifice. The form was named
after the rishis (sages) because of the
implicit sacrificial rites. See also mar-
riage, eight classical forms.
Artha
In Indian philosophy this is one of the
four purusharthas, or aims of life, with
the others being kama (desire), dharma
(religious duty), and moksha (final liber-
ation of the soul). The word artha has dif-
ferent shades of meaning in various
contexts, but all of these meanings center
on the definitions “aim,” “goal,” or “end.”
The word can thus refer to any goal of
human life, but as one of these
purusharthas, artha refers to riches,
power, and worldly prosperity. These are
the material things that allow one to ful-
fill one’s temporal goals, and unless one
gains them in some measure, any sort of
worldly happiness becomes problematic.
Hindu culture has traditionally sanc-
tioned wealth and power as a legitimate
human goal, although this endeavor
must be governed by a commitment to
dharma. When controlled by an overall
orientation to righteous action, the
quest for wealth is part of an integrated
life. Without this commitment the drive
for wealth becomes an all-consuming
desire that ultimately destroys a person.
Arthapatti
(“presumption”) All Indian philosophical
schools concern themselves with codify-
ing the pramanas, that is, the means by
which human beings can gain true and
accurate knowledge. Almost all schools
consider perception (pratyaksha), infer-
ence (anumana), and authoritative testi-
mony (shabda) as pramanas; the Purva
Mimamsa school, one of the six schools
of traditional Hindu philosophy, posited
two others: abhava (“knowledge from
absence”) and arthapatti.
Arthapatti is an inference from cir-
cumstance in which a judgment is
made about one case based solely on
similarities to related cases. An
example would be when a traveler is
presumed to have reached her destina-
tion, since the train’s arrival time has
passed. According to Indian philoso-
phy, this is not a true inference since
the judgment must always be con-
firmed by direct perception, in this
case that the train had actually
reached its destination. The Purva
Mimamsas justified this new pramana
by arguing that this knowledge could
not be accounted for by any of the
existing pramanas and thus required
this new one to explain it. The other
schools were not inclined to accept it,
since its presumptive nature could
often lead to error.
Arthashastra
(“Treatise on Power”) Text on power and
politics attributed to Kautilya, the
Machiavellian prime minister said to
have orchestrated the rise to power of
Chandragupta Maurya (r. 321–297
B.C.E.), the founder of the Maurya
dynasty. The Arthashastra was intended
as a guidebook for the king, to help him
control both the people in his kingdom
and the surrounding states.
The Arthashastra’s fundamental
assumption was that the king wanted to
remain in power and should do whatev-
er it took to retain it.
Within the kingdom, Kautilya advo-
cated a strict and authoritarian govern-
ment aided by an extensive network of
spies to gather intelligence and assess
the popular mood. These spies included
men posing as wandering ascetics, who
could move about without suspicion.
The book also advised the king to assign
special spies to his closest advisers
to monitor their ambition, and to
have these spies report only to the
king himself.
In regard to neighboring countries,
the Arthashastra assumed that each
king wanted to increase his kingdom at
[[55]]
Arundhati
the expense of his neighbors. Weaker
neighbors were to be conquered and
assimilated, whereas stronger ones
were to be pacified or stalled with the
eventual hope that these stronger
states could be countered by making
other alliances.
Although the Arthashastra was
never the “Bible” of any ruling Indian
dynasty, it detailed political philosophy
and practices that existed in ancient
and medieval India and can even
be
discerned
in
contemporary
parliamentary politics.
Arundhati
The wife of the sage Vasishtha. In Hindu
mythology Arundhati is a model of
devotion to her husband, and during
contemporary marriage ceremonies,
she is invoked by the groom as a model
of wifely fidelity. Arundhati is also per-
sonified as the minor star Alcor in the
constellation known as the Big Dipper
(known in India as the Seven Sages
because of its seven main stars); here
she accompanies the star personifying
her husband.
Aryabhatta
Ancient astronomer and mathemati-
cian, whose major work was composed
in 499 C.E. Among Aryabhatta’s accom-
plishments were his theories that the
earth was a sphere that rotated on its
axis, and that eclipses were caused by
the shadow of the moon. He also calcu-
lated the value of pi to four decimal
places and the length of the year to
seven decimal places. Both these feats
show not only great facility with mathe-
matics but also the use of the zero.
Although Aryabhatta is celebrated as
a scientist, in the ancient world there was
no differentiation between astronomer
and astrologer. Given the assumption
that the heavenly bodies influenced
human affairs, his astronomical conclu-
sions would have also been used in the
field of astrology.
[[56]]

Aryan
This word is derived from the Sanskrit
word arya (“noble”), which is used in the
earliest Hindu sacred literature, the
Vedas, to describe a certain group of
people that believed the Vedas were
sacred. In the beginning this word sim-
ply designated “our group” from “other
people,” whom the Veda names Dasyus
(“slaves”). These provide a description of
the slaves as having flat noses and curly
hair. Throughout history Hindu writers
have often described themselves as
“Arya,” although it is important to note
that this need not be understood as a
racial designation, since it could merely
be intended to mean “noble.”
Who were these Aryans? Nineteenth-
century
European
philological
research discovered structural rela-
tionships between Sanskrit and
classical European languages and
speculated that all these languages
came from a common parent. Based
on further analysis, these researchers
hypothesized that people speaking
this parent language originated in
Central Asia, somewhere near the
Caspian Sea. From there, some went
west to Europe, some went southwest
to Turkey, and some went south
toward Iran and later to India. The
conclusion that these Indian pilgrims
came from Iran is based on compar-
isons between the Avesta and the
Veda, the Iranian and Indian religious
texts. These texts show broad linguis-
tic similarities and indicate that the
people speaking the languages were
closely related. This entire theory is
thus based solely on the observed
similarities between languages and on
how they changed.
For the nineteenth-century philolo-
gists, “Aryan” was a linguistic category
used to designate people speaking
certain languages and involved no
assumptions about the speakers’
racial identity. Despite this fact,
the word quickly assumed a racial
connotation in European discourse,
with terrible consequences.Arya Samaj
The Aryan movement was once
described as an “invasion,” but in recent
years it has become more common to
describe it as a “migration.” According to
the accounts in the Vedas, the Aryans
were a pastoral people, and although
some Vedic passages mention war
chariots, the majority describe herds of
cattle. Given this picture of nomads fol-
lowing their cattle to pasture, the image
of an invading army seems improbable.
The Aryan migration theory
accounts for the dissemination of vari-
ous languages but is not universally
accepted. Many modern Indians
subscribe to the Indigenous Aryan (IA)
theory, which maintains that the Aryans
are the original inhabitants of India and
as proof points to the artifacts found in
the Indus Valley civilization. Some of
the people that believe the IA theory may
be reacting against the Aryan migration
theory’s perceived colonialist bias, since
the theory was developed by Europeans
and assumes that the dominant groups
in modern India must have come from
outside. Other supporters are the propo-
nents of Hindutva, who claim that all
Indians are “really” Hindus and thus one
social group, whatever their particular
religious beliefs.
This assertion has profound political
implications in modern India, where
Christians and Muslims are not only
religious communities but social and
political ones as well. By connecting
Hindu identity with good Indian
citizenship, Hindutva proponents are
marginalizing Christians and Muslims
as outsiders.
Arya Samaj
Reformist Hindu organization formed in
[[1875]]
 by Swami Dayanand Saraswati.
The Arya Samaj was formed in an era of
sweeping social, economic, and reli-
gious change—the last particularly
caused by Christian missionary evange-
lism—and represented an authentic
Hindu response to these changes.
For some time, more traditional
Hindus perceived this organization as a
genuine religious threat. Swami
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption
was that ultimate religious authority lay
only in the ancient scriptures called the
Vedas. This stance allowed him to attack
many of the “social evils” plaguing nine-
teenth-century Hinduism, such as child
marriages, sati, image worship, the
caste system, and a ban on widow
remarriage. He contended that these
practices were corrupt and illegitimate
since they could not be found in the
Veda, and the Arya Samaj worked cease-
lessly to get rid of such practices.
Unlike the Brahmo Samaj, an
earlier reformist organization, the ideas
of the Arya Samaj showed no
Christian influence. It certainly addressed
many concerns raised by Christian
reformers, but the Arya Samaj was
militantly
anti-Christian.
It
was
equally opposed to the “corruption”
of contemporary Hinduism.
Although the Aryas claimed that they
were simply getting back to the Veda, the
ultimate aim was not to reclaim that
long-gone era but to develop a form of
Hindu religious life more compatible
with “modern” times. The Aryas
replaced image worship with a fire sac-
rifice based on the rituals in the Veda.
The Arya Samaj was also notable for
promoting the ceremony of “purifica-
tion” (shuddhi), through which Hindus
who had become members of other reli-
gious communities were received back
into the Hindu community.
Dayanand and his followers were
quite militant in espousing such reforms
and saw themselves as developing the
leadership for the future of Hinduism.
To accomplish this the Arya Samaj
strongly emphasized education, and
one of its most lasting achievements has
been establishing schools and colleges
to educate its women and men.
Although the Arya Samaj was highly
controversial for its first sixty years, by
the late 1930s its revolutionary spirit had
somewhat cooled; at present the Aryas
have become a sectarian group more or
less assimilated into larger Hindu

Asamanjasa
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Hindu epics, the only men-
tion of Asamanjasa describes how he
throws children into the Sarayu River
and then laughs as they drown.
Fortunately for the Solar Line, which is
one of the two great lineages,
Asamanjasa’s son Anshuman is very
virtuous, and the line continues both
unbroken and uncorrupted.
Asana
A man practices the fetus position.
This asana, or bodily posture,
is one of many that are used in yoga.
society. For further information see

Asamanjasa
In Hindu mythology, the son of the
celebrated King Sagar and his wife
Keshini. Keshini has received a boon
that she will bear a single son through
whom the royal lineage will continue,
whereas her co-wife Sumati will bear
sixty thousand sons who will all die
before they are married. Asamanjasa is
that single son, but his character is so
bad that his lineage, the Solar Line,
seems to be in grave danger.
[[58]]

(“bodily posture”) In the ashtanga
(“eight-part”) yoga first codified by
Patanjali (1st c. C.E.?), asana is the
third of the eight elements of yoga
practice and involves different body
postures. In his text, Patanjali asserts
that one’s physical position should be
stable and comfortable, since the
ultimate end of these postures is to
enable one to concentrate without
physical distractions. A series of posi-
tions for developing and training the
body evolved from this text. The most
familiar of these is the lotus posture
(padmasana).
These physical exercises are the
best-known feature of yoga and are
often confused with the larger prac-
tice of yoga itself. Although these
postures have definite physical bene-
fits, such as increased bodily flexibil-
ity, their ultimate purpose is to
enable one to sit for long periods in
meditation without physical distrac-
tions. As such, they are a necessary
element for progress on the spiritual
path but should not be confused with
the end goal.
In a more general context, the word
asana can refer to various ways of sit-
ting, and by extension to the thing
upon which one sits. In general the
object upon which one sits—particu-
larly for meditation or any sort of reli-
gious practice—is believed to be
charged with power because of its
association with spirituality. Many of
these objects, especially animal skins,
are believed to confer certain powers
and thus have symbolic meaning as well.Ascetic
In the context of worship, asana is
the second of the sixteen upacharas
(“offerings”) given to a deity as a way
of treating the god as an honored
guest. In this case asana refers to offer-
ing the deity a place to sit, one of the
most basic acts of human hospitality.
Asat
This word denotes a general category
in Indian speculative thought and is
often translated as “nonbeing.” It is
the absolute opposite of sat and is
formed by the addition of the negative
prefix. If sat is “that which (really and
truly) exists,” then its opposite is “that
which does not exist.” Since the word
sat also carries connotations of
Truth—that things that exist are both
“real” and “true”—asat carries conno-
tations of falseness.
Asatkaryavada
One of the three basic causal models in
classical Indian philosophy, along
with satkaryavada and anekantavada.
All three models seek to explain the
workings of causality in the everyday
world, particularly the relationship
between causes and their effects,
which has profound implications for
religious life. All of the philosophical
schools assume that if one under-
stands the causal process correctly
and can manipulate it through one’s
conscious actions, it is possible to gain
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
Thus disagreements over differing
causal models are not merely
academic disputes but are grounded
in varying assumptions about the
nature of things.
The asatkaryavada model assumes
that effects do not preexist in their
causes; that is, they are completely
and utterly distinct from them. In
the classic examples for this model,
one can create a clay pot by putting
together the two halves of the pot, or
one can weave a cloth from many
strands of thread. Each of these acts
creates a new object that did not previ-
ously exist, which came into being
through certain material and instru-
mental causes.
Since each act of creation brings a
new thing into being, this causal model
tends to multiply the number of objects
in the universe. It also admits that
human efforts and actions are part of the
causes influencing these effects, making
it theoretically possible to act in a way
that brings final liberation to the soul.
The disadvantage of this model
is that it can lead to philosophical
skepticism. As the world gets fragmented
into more and more causes—most of
which one cannot control—one can
easily believe that one’s actions will
have no discernible effect, even over
time. To counter this danger of
skepticism, asatkaryavada proponents
stress the conditions that govern
the causal process and gear people’s
efforts accordingly.
This model is espoused by the Nyaya
Vaisheshikas and the Prabhakara
school of Purva Mimamsa, as well as by
the Buddhists. For further information
see Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions
of India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Ascetic
In the most general sense, this word
denotes a person who has renounced
regular society and conventional social
life in a quest to seek religious
insight and to gain final liberation of the
soul (moksha). Such spiritual seekers
sometimes emphasize asceticism or
physical discipline, but this is not a
necessary element.
Ascetics can be organized into
different subgroups based upon
organizational affiliation or the
particular Hindu deity that they
worship. The Bairagis, Dashanami
Sanyasis, and Nathpanthis are all
well-defined ascetic organizations
into which one must undertake formal
initiation; the Bairagis are devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, and the
other two are devotees of Shiva.
[[59]]
Asceticism
The sadhu (“straight”) is the other
major type of ascetic and the most diffi-
cult to define. Most sadhus are unaffili-
ated with any religious organization,
have undertaken no formal ascetic initi-
ation, and fall outside the other groups’
sectarian boundaries. A sadhu is a soli-
tary religious seeker, driven to attain
religious goals by doing whatever seems
best to him (or more rarely, to her).
Asceticism
In the most general sense, this word
denotes physical discipline, most often
the renunciation of regular society and
conventional social life in a quest to
seek religious insight and to gain final
liberation of the soul (moksha).
Historically, ascetic practice has
stressed several constant themes. One of
the most common has been celibacy,
for a variety of reasons. Not only does
sexual enjoyment use the senses to trap
a person, but the attachments caused by
home and family are seen as a distrac-
tion to serious spiritual life. Yet the
emphasis on celibacy is also motivated
by the belief that semen is a man’s con-
centrated essence, and thus it is some-
thing to be carefully hoarded. Although
semen must be expended for procre-
ation, it should not be spilled casually
since this drains away a man’s vitality. It
is believed that energy gained from
celibacy leads to greater spiritual
accomplishment.
Another hallmark has been the prac-
tice of tapas, or physical asceticism,
under the assumption that enduring
physical hardship not only builds char-
acter but also generates spiritual power.
At times tapas can assume grotesque
forms of self-mutilation and mortifica-
tion. At other times it may be a milder
physical discipline, such as a form of
hatha yoga, to train the body and mind
for extended practice.
In general, ascetic spiritual develop-
ment can proceed along a variety of dif-
ferent paths, which often reflect the
abilities and inclinations of the ascetics
following them. Some paths have
[[60]]

stressed the importance of traditional
learning, some have stressed worship
and devotion, some have stressed phys-
ical asceticism, and some have stressed
meditation and individual realization.
In almost all cases, this spiritual training
takes place under the direction of a reli-
gious preceptor (guru), who takes
responsibility for the spiritual develop-
ment of his disciples.
Asceticism in India has a long and
venerable history, although there is
considerable disagreement regarding
how long and how venerable. The most
ambitious claim is that the Indian
ascetic tradition comes from the
religion of the Indus Valley civilization.
This claim is based on one of the Indus
Valley seals, an ancient artifact that
shows a figure sitting cross-legged as if
in meditation.
Whether or not one accepts this
claim, there is ample evidence of
asceticism in the Vedas, the earliest
Hindu scriptures. The Vedas mention
renunciant figures, such as the vratya,
yati, and muni, and also refer to
ascetics living in the forest. Indeed,
the very name of one stratum of the
Veda, the Aranyakas or “Forest
Books,” suggests that it was composed
by such ascetics. Buddhist and Jain lit-
erature clearly shows that ascetic life
was well established by the fifth centu-
ry B.C.E., as do some of the later upan-
ishads. All of these ascetics, whether
Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain, were desig-
nated under the umbrella term shra-
mana, a word whose basic meaning is
“to strive.” It is generally accepted that
there was religious tension between
the two dominant religious paradigms,
the Brahmana ideal connected with
Vedic religion and the shramana ideal
associated with asceticism. The
Brahmana ideal was based on sacri-
fice, mastery of complex sacred texts,
and hereditary priesthood; further-
more, it was so expensive that it virtu-
ally required royal patrons—all of
these factors rendering it the “estab-
lishment religion.” These concepts
clashed with the shramana ideal,Ashadh
which was renunciant, individualist,
and stressed inner experience.
By the time of the Dharma
Shastras (treatises on religious duty),
this tension had been somewhat
resolved; asceticism had been relegat-
ed to the last of the four ashramas
(stages of life), that of the Sanyasi. Yet
even here the tension remains, since
according to these texts, a twice-born
man cannot become a Sanyasi until he
has seen his children’s children, which
would make him well advanced in
years. These texts restrict asceticism to
twice-born men who have fulfilled
their obligations as householders, but
they deny it to women and low-caste
men. Needless to say, the actual pic-
ture has never been quite as neat as
the idealized society found in the
Dharma Shastras.
Organizationally, initiated Hindu
ascetics can be divided into several
major groups. One division is based on
the ascetics’ patron deity; the Shaiva
are devotees (bhakta) of Shiva, and the
Vaishnava worship Vishnu.
The Kapalikas, Kalamukhas, and
Pashupatas are Shaiva ascetic groups
that have disappeared; the two Shaiva
groups that still survive are the
Dashanamis and the Nathpanthis. The
Dashanamis are the most prestigious of
all ascetics. They were supposedly orga-
nized by the great philosopher
Shankaracharya and have traditionally
emphasized learning. The Nathpanthis
trace their origin to Gorakhnath, a mir-
acle-working yogi about whom little
is definitely known. The Nathpanthis
are known for their stress on the
transformation of the physical body
through yoga.
Vaishnava ascetics are more recently
organized, and in northern India they
are broken into four groups (chatuh-
sampradayi Nagas), named after each
group’s reported founder: Ramananda
for the Ramanandis, Nimbarka for the
Nimbarkis, Chaitanya for the Madhva
Gaudiyas (Brahma Sampraday), and
Vishnuswami for the Vishnuswamis.
From at least the sixteenth century,
and perhaps much earlier, both the
Dashanamis and the Vaishnava ascetics
organized bands of fighters known as
Nagas (“naked”). These soldier-ascetics
were commissioned to protect the other
ascetics, but they also served as long-
distance traders and mercenary
soldiers. These Naga orders still exist
today, although they are no longer
prepared for battle. Another important
sect is the Udasis, who worship the
panchayatana (“five-fold”), a collection
of five Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu,
Durga, Ganesh, and Surya. Religiously
speaking, the Udasis thus fall between
the Shaivas and Vaishnavas.
In the past few centuries, reform-
minded ascetics have organized their
own ascetic bands, a process that still
continues today. For further informa-
tion see G. S. Ghurye, Indian Sadhus,

der Veer, Gods on Earth, 1988. See also

Ashadh
According to the lunar calendar, by which
most Hindu religious festivals are cele-
brated, Ashadh is the fourth month in the
lunar year, usually falling within June and
July. In northern India, this is usually the
hottest month of the year.
The major holidays celebrated in
Ashadh are Yogini Ekadashi, the Rath
Yatra, Devshayani Ekadashi, and Guru
Purnima. Devshayani Ekadashi also
marks the beginning of the Chaturmas Vrat.
This is a four-month (lunar) period
generally coinciding with the rainy
season. During this time the god
Vishnu is believed to be “sleeping,”
and because of this the period is con-
sidered inauspicious.
[[61]]
Ashaucha
Men wash the body of a deceased man to prepare it for cremation.
A dead body is considered to be a potent source of ashaucha, or impurity.
Ashaucha
(“impurity”) Name for the ritual impurity
caused by contact with any source of pol-
lution; these sources come in many dif-
ferent guises, both physical and social.
Purity and impurity are religious
categories and thus fundamentally dif-
ferent from cleanliness and dirtiness,
which are hygienic categories. For
example, cow dung is considered a
pure substance in traditional Hindu
society and is smeared on patches of
ground to purify it. It is also important
to realize that impurity is a natural part
of life—as just one example, everyone
goes to the bathroom every day—and
that becoming impure carries no sense
of moral imperfection or lapse.
Most bodily fluids are considered pol-
luting; one becomes impure through any
activity involving them, such as urination,
defecation, sexual activity, giving birth, or
being born. One can become polluted
through contact with people or things
deemed impure, such as people of lower
social status, animals, any sort of ordinary
filth, or even the dust from the road.
[[62]]

Impurity can also be caused by social con-
nections. The impurity from childbirth
(sutakashaucha) obviously affects the
mother and child because of the bodily
fluids involved, but it also affects all other
members of the immediate family.
If a person has come into contact
with something polluting, the solution
is to remove the source of impurity. The
most common means of purification is
to bathe in running water, which
removes less virulent impurities by car-
rying them away with the water’s flow.
The purifying power of bathing (snana)
makes it a prelude to many religious
rituals, in which one of the general pre-
conditions is scrupulous purity, both
for the person performing the ritual
and the place where it is performed.
The most polluting substance of all
is a corpse, which is one reason why
bodies are destroyed by cremation on
the day of death. The impurity from
death (maranashaucha) is the most
violent impurity of all, and contact with
a corpse affects the entire family for ten
days after the death.Ashoka Tree

Kolenda, “Purity and Pollution,” in T. N.
Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Ashirvad
(“benedictory formula”) General term
used to denote words of blessing,
whether formal or informal. One of
the basic assumptions of Hindu reli-
gious life is that certain spiritually
powerful
people—in
particular,
ascetics and learned brahmins—can
confer blessings and curses at will.
Both the blessings and curses are
believed to take effect immediately
and without fail, which is why a pru-
dent person will always treat ascetics
and learned brahmins with the
respect that they deserve.
Ashoka
(r. 269–232 B.C.E.) The greatest ruler in
the Maurya dynasty, who reigned over a
kingdom stretching from Afghanistan to
southern India from his capital at
Pataliputra. Ashoka’s father, Bindusara,
and his grandfather, Chandragupta
Maurya, had created a centralized
empire. Aside from the far south, the
only area outside its influence was the
region known as Kalinga (modern state
of Orissa).
Early in his reign, Ashoka’s armies
conquered Kalinga in a bloody cam-
paign, killing hundreds of thousands of
people; the carnage had a profound
effect on the young Ashoka. Several
years later Ashoka formally adopted
Buddhism and embraced the principle
of nonviolence (ahimsa). As a result he
formally renounced war as a means
of conquest.
Early historians believed that
Ashoka used his royal power to make
Buddhism the state religion, but this
position appears to misread the evi-
dence. Ashoka did seem to be attracted
to Buddhism, but his public pro-
nouncements on “Dhamma,” earlier
identified with Buddhist teaching, seem
to have been aimed at creating a cli-
mate of social responsibility, tolerance,
nonviolence, and harmony. These were
qualities that most reasonable people
would endorse, and some historians
have suggested that such vague guide-
lines indicate an attempt to unify a reli-
giously diverse empire.
Ashoka is by far the best-known figure
of his era, largely because he set up public
inscriptions all over his kingdom. Rock
edicts tended to be carved on rock faces
close to the empire’s borders, while pillar
edicts were inscribed on pillars erected
on the main roads.
The writing used for these inscrip-
tions varied in different regions of the
empire, although the language for all
was a Prakrit, one of the grammatically
simple vernacular languages that devel-
oped from Sanskrit. These inscriptions
are the earliest written Indian docu-
ments of any historical significance;
they reveal a great deal about Ashoka’s
public persona, his exhortations to his
subjects, and even something about the
man himself.
In modern India, Ashoka is the model
for the enlightened ruler, and the
Ashokan pillar capped with four lions has
been adopted as the emblem of the mod-
ern republic of India.
Ashoka Tree
(Jonesia ashoka) Flowering tree tradi-
tionally associated with love and fertili-
ty. When in bloom, the Ashoka tree is
covered with red flowers—a color typi-
cally associated with passion—that con-
trast with its green foliage. According to
tradition, the ashoka tree will not bloom
until it has been kicked by a young
woman’s foot, implying the transfer of
her fertile energy to the tree.
The Ashoka tree is also famous in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. When Sita is kidnapped by
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, she
is imprisoned in a grove of Ashoka trees,
where she pines away waiting to be res-
cued by her husband Rama.
[[63]]
Ashram
Religious leader at an ashram in Puri.
Ashram
The abode of an ascetic or religious renun-
ciant. The word is derived from a form of
the verb “to strive” and has several different
meanings: On one hand, an ashram is also
a place where one gives up one’s conven-
tional worldly striving; on the other hand,
it is a place at which one can seriously
strive for spiritual goals that are often less
emphasized in the material world.
In modern Hinduism (both in India
and abroad) the word can refer to a full
spectrum of living arrangements, from
a simple hut or cave inhabited by one
person to magnificent building com-
pounds that can house thousands of
people at a time.
Ashrama
(“stages, abodes”) See stages of life.
Ashrama Dashanami
One of the ten divisions of the Dashanami
Sanyasis, renunciant ascetics who are devo-
tees (bhakta) of Shiva. The Dashanamis
were supposedly established by the ninth-
century philosopher Shankaracharya in an
effort to create a corps of learned men who
could help to revitalize Hindu life. Each of
the divisions is designated by a different
[[64]]

name—in this case, ashrama (“hermitage”).
Upon initiation, new members are given
this name as a surname to their new
ascetic names, thus allowing for immediate
group identification.
Aside from their individual identity,
these ten “named” divisions are divided
into four larger organizational groups.
Each group has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths) sup-
posedly established by Shankaracharya,
as well as other particular religious associ-
ations. The Ashrama Dashanamis belong
to the Kitawara group, which is affiliated
with the Sharada Math in the city of
Dwaraka, located near the Arabian Sea.
The Ashrama division is considered
an elite group because it is one of the few
that will initiate only brahmins (the
other such divisions are the Saraswati
Dashanamis, Tirtha Dashanamis, and
part of the Bharati Dashanamis.)
Ashtachap
(“eight seals”) A group of eight northern
Indian bhakti (devotional) poets:
Surdas, Krishnadas, Parmananddas,
Kumbhadas, Nanddas, Chaturbhujdas,
Chitswami, and Govindswami.
In the sectarian literature of the
Pushti Marg, a Vaishnava community
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of Krishna, all eight of these poets are
named as members of the sect and asso-
ciates of the Pushti Marg’s early leaders.
Surdas, Krishnadas, Parmananddas, and
Kumbhadas are connected with the
Pushti Marg’s founder, Vallabhacharya
(1479–1531); Nanddas, Chaturbhujdas,
Chitswami, and Govindswami are asso-
ciated with Vallabha’s son and successor,
Vitthalnath (r. 1566–1585). Evidence of
their membership can be found in their
poetry, which confirms this claim for
many of the poets; for Surdas, however,
this claim seems highly unlikely.
Ashtadhyayi
(“Eight Sections”) Text composed by the
Sanskrit grammarian Panini (ca. 4th c.
B.C.E.); the text’s name stems from theAshtanga (“eight-limbed”) Yoga
eight sections it contains. Panini wrote
the Ashtadhyayi as a descriptive account
of contemporary Sanskrit, but in later
generations the text was transformed
into the prescriptive norm for the lan-
guage. Each of the Ashtadhyayi’s eight
sections is composed of a series of brief
aphorisms (sutras), which are usually
only a few words long, and refers to a
specific facet of Sanskrit grammar. Each
sutra in a given section builds upon all
the preceding sutras, and in turn pro-
vides the foundation and background
for understanding those coming after it.
This sequential description means that
Panini began with Sanskrit’s most
general linguistic features and moved
from there to more specific ones. This
method allowed Panini to provide a
complete account of the Sanskrit
language as briefly as possible, and the
text’s condensed form facilitated memo-
rization. As with most sutra texts, the
Ashtadhyayi’s terseness of expression
presupposes a commentary, since the
sutras themselves are so short and pithy
that they are simply cryptic to the unini-
tiated. The Ashtadhyayi’s most famous
commentary is the Mahabhashya,
written by the grammarian Patanjali in
the second century B.C.E.
Ashtalakshmi
Eight different forms of the goddess
named Lakshmi, representing her dif-
ferent aspects as the source of wealth
and prosperity. The eight are often por-
trayed as a set, although one may also
encounter them separately: Vijaya (“vic-
tory”) Lakshmi, Jaya (“conquest”)
Lakshmi, Dhana (“wealth”) Lakshmi,
Dhanya (“grain”) Lakshmi, Gaja (“ele-
phant”) Lakshmi, Aishvarya (“divine
power”) Lakshmi, Vina (a musical
instrument) Lakshmi, and Raja (“royal”)
Lakshmi.
Ashtanga (“eight-limbed”) Yoga
System of yoga (religious discipline) tra-
ditionally ascribed to Patanjali (1st c.
C.E.?). This author is believed to be dif-
ferent than the grammarian Patanjali,
who wrote the Mahabhashya commen-
tary on Panini’s Sanskrit grammar.
Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras are the basis
for the Yoga school of Indian philoso-
phy, one of the six schools. By the early
centuries of the common era (approxi-
mately 100–300 C.E.), the Yoga school
had become paired with the Samkhya
school. In this pairing, Samkhya provid-
ed the theoretical and metaphysical
explanations for the bondage and liber-
ation of the soul, while Yoga laid out the
concrete path for ending bondage and
gaining liberation.
Ashtanga yoga is made up of eight
parts, known as “limbs” (anga):
restraints (yama), observances (niyama),
bodily postures (asana), restraint of
breath (pranayama), withdrawal of the
senses (pratyahara), concentration
(dharana), meditation (dhyana), and
trance (samadhi).
Patanjali’s system is an eight-step
program for self-transformation, which
begins by cultivating certain whole-
some behavioral patterns (yama and
niyama). From there one progresses to
development and control of the mind,
which is considered a more subtle and
internalized practice. It culminates in a
mystic insight that brings liberation,
which in its original articulation is
described as yogic aloneness (kaivalya)
because Samkhya is atheistic.
Patanjali’s path shows general simi-
larities to another well-known program
for self-transformation, the Buddha’s
eightfold path. Although both Patanjali
and the Buddha are credited with origi-
nating their particular paths, it is likely
that they both drew from an existing
yogic tradition and shaped it to fit their
own assumptions.
Although Samkhya metaphysics
have long been discredited, the tech-
niques of the Yoga school are still vitally
important in modern Hindu religious
life. Many modern Hindu movements
stress yoga practice as a means of spiri-
tual discipline, purification, and self-
awareness. For further information see

Ashtavakra
A. Moore (eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Ashtavakra
(“eight bends”) In the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics,
Ashtavakra is a sage who is the son of
Khagodara. According to tradition,
Ashtavakra is an exceptionally preco-
cious child, and this gets him into seri-
ous trouble. While he is still in his
mother’s womb, Ashtavakra corrects his
father’s pronunciation of a certain
mantra. In response his father curses
him to be bent, and when the child is
born he has eight bends in his body.
Despite his unusual appearance,
Ashtavakra becomes a learned sage and
is widely believed to be the author of the
Ashtavakragita (“Song of Ashtavakra”).
This text describes the philosophical
concept of monism, which is the belief
that a single Supreme Reality (named
Brahman) lies behind the entire uni-
verse, and that all things are merely dif-
fering manifestations of this reality.
Ashutosh
(“quickly satisfied”) Epithet of the god
Shiva. This name reflects Shiva’s rela-
tionship with his devotees (bhakta), as
well as his ultimate nature. When his
devotees approach him with sincerity,
he demands neither expensive offerings
nor prolonged worship, and he extends
his favor immediately. See Shiva.
Ashvalayana
Sage and author of one of the Grhya
Sutras, the manuals of domestic rites.
Ashvalayana’s work is one of the earliest to
mention the various life-cycle ceremonies
(samskaras) and is thus an important
source on these rites.
Ashvamedha
(“horse sacrifice”) Vedic sacrifice per-
formed to display and prove royal power.
In this sacrifice a specially consecrated
[[66]]

horse was released to roam as it wished,
followed by an armed band of the king’s
servants. When the horse wandered into a
neighboring ruler’s territory, that king had
two choices: He could either acknowledge
subordinate status to the king who
had released it, or he could attempt to
steal the horse, and do battle with the
king’s servants.
After one year of wandering, the horse
was brought back to the royal capital and
killed by suffocation or strangulation, so
that its blood would not be shed. After the
horse had been killed, the chief queen
would lie down next to it and simulate sex-
ual intercourse. When the instructions for
this ritual were first translated in the nine-
teenth century, this simulated intercourse
generated considerable horrified interest
among European scholars, even though it
was clearly a subsidiary part of the ritual.
The rite’s major emphasis was a cele-
bration of royal power, since the king per-
forming it was able to control the territory
covered in a year by a free-roaming horse.
The queen’s role, in contrast, seems aimed
at symbolically assuring the fertility of the
land. Historical records indicate that the
ashvamedha was performed until the
tenth century C.E. As with all other cases of
animal sacrifice, concerns about the
karmic consequences of slaughtering a
living being has been an important factor
in its discontinuation. See also karma.
Ashvattha
The sacred fig tree, Ficus religiosa, which
in modern times is more commonly
known as the pipal. The ashvattha is
especially noted for its aerial roots,
which extend downward from some of
the limbs until they touch the ground, at
which point they take root themselves.
Because their roots can become sub-
sidiary trunks, ashvattha trees can
grow to be enormous. They have tradi-
tionally been favored as places for
ascetics to dwell, in part because of their
sacred associations and in part because
their dense foliage provides shelter from
the elements.Assam
Their unusual structure is noted in
chapter fifteen of the Bhagavad Gita, in
which the ashvattha is described as the
tree of life. The ashvattha is also believed
to be the type of tree under which the
Buddha attained enlightenment.
Ashvatthama
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Ashvatthama is the
son of Drona. When Drona becomes the
archery teacher to the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, the epic’s two central royal
families, Ashvatthama also receives
instruction along with the young
princes. He absorbs his father’s teaching
well and masters the use of terrifying
magical
weapons.
During
the
Mahabharata’s climactic civil war, he
fights on the side of the Kauravas and
kills many of the Pandava allies; this
includes Dhrshtadyumna, who has ear-
lier killed his father, Drona. After the war
is over, Ashvatthama retires to the forest
with the sage Vyasa.
Ashvin
According to the lunar calendar, by
which most Hindu religious festivals are
determined, Ashvin is the seventh
month in the lunar year, usually falling
within September and October. In
Ashvin the monsoon rains usually
taper off, and the weather becomes a
bit cooler.
The dark (waning) half of this month
is the Pitrpaksha, one of the most
inauspicious times of the year. The
bright (waxing) half contains one of
the most important festivals of the year,
the fall Navaratri, culminating in
Dussehra or Vijaya Dashami. Other
festivals during this month are Indira
Ekadashi, Papankusha Ekadashi, and
Valmiki Jayanti.
Ashvins
Twin deities named Satya and Dasya,
who are sons of the god Surya (the Sun)
and the physicians to the gods. In the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, the Ashvins are the divine
fathers of the Pandava twins, Nakula
and Sahadeva. Nakula and Sahadeva are
born when their mother, Madri, uses a
powerful mantra enabling a woman to
have a child by any one of the gods;
as the sons of the divine physicians,
the epic portrays these twins as having
their fathers’ ability to heal. In the
Hindu lunar calendar, the month of
Ashvin (October–November) is devoted
to them.
Assam
Before Indian independence in 1947,
this name designated the entire territory
east of Bengal province in northeastern
India; in the time since independence, it
was divided into seven different admin-
istrative regions, one of which is the
contemporary state of Assam.
Like all other states in the northeast-
ern corner, much of modern Assam is
culturally distinct from the rest of India.
One marker of this cultural divide is lan-
guage: whereas most Indians speak lan-
guages from the Indo-Aryan or
Dravidian language families, many
tribal people in Assam speak Tibeto-
Burman languages. The bulk of modern
Assam is in the Brahmaputra River val-
ley, which is where most of the Hindus
in the northeast reside.
Despite its remoteness from the rest
of India, Assam does have one very
important sacred place, the temple of
the goddess Kamakhya just outside the
capital of Gauhati. This is one of the
Shakti Pithas, a network of sites con-
nected with the worship of the Mother
Goddess that were established at places
where it is believed that body parts of the
dismembered goddess Sati fell to earth.
Kamakhya is considered the most power-
ful of all the Shakti Pithas since it is
believed to be where Sati’s vulva (a highly
charged female body part) fell to earth.
[[67]]
Asthi-Sanchayana
In the asthi-visarjana funeral ceremony, after cremation
the remains of a body are gathered and immersed in sacred water.
Asthi-Sanchayana
(“gathering the bones”) Name for a par-
ticular ceremony performed as one of
the last rites (antyeshthi samskara) con-
nected with death. Asthi-sanchayana is
usually performed on the second or third
day after cremation. In this rite, some of
the remains of the deceased—bits of
bone and ash—are gathered from the
site of the cremation pyre. These remains
are collected and kept in a safe place
until their final dispersal in the last of the
death rites, asthi-visarjana.
Asthi-Visarjana
(“scattering the bones”) Name for a partic-
ular ceremony performed as one of the last
rites (antyeshthi samskara) connected
with death. In this ritual, bits of bone and
ash collected from the cremation site in
the rite of asthi-sanchayana are immersed
in the waters of the Ganges or some other
sacred river. This is the final ceremony
for the dead, since in earlier times the
collected remains might be kept for years
before a family member was able to bring
them to a pilgrimage place (tirtha) to per-
form this rite. Modern transportation has
changed this pattern somewhat, making it
more common for asthi-visarjana to be
[[68]]

carried out immediately after death but
before the sapindikarana ceremony on
the twelfth day.
This rite is still widely performed in
modern India and remains important for
at least two reasons: On one hand, there is
the symbolism of redemption for the dead
through consigning their ashes to the
sacred waters, and on the other, providing
definitive ritual closure for the living.

Asura Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the Dharma Shastras,
the treatises on religious duty (dharma).
It is named after the asuras, a class of
powerful divine beings whose interests
are often at odds with those of the
gods (deva); thus, the name carries an
unfavorable connotation.
An asura marriage takes place when a
man gives money to the bride’s family and
the bride herself. This is one of the fourAtman
reprehensible (aprashasta) forms of mar-
riage because of the connotation that the
bride is being sold, yet like all the other
reprehensible forms, it is deemed to create
a valid marriage.
Despite this general disapproval, it is
one of the two classical forms that is still
practiced (the other being the Brahma
marriage), although because of the
stigma attached to the implication of
selling one’s child, it is only done by
people who are either very poor or of very
low social status. See also marriage, eight
classical forms.
Atala Akhara
The name of a subgroup of the Naga class
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, a particular
type of renunciant ascetic. The
Dashanami Nagas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, organized into different
akharas, or regiments, based on the
model of an army. Until the beginning
of the nineteenth century, the Nagas
were known as mercenary soldiers,
although they also had substantial trading
interests; both of these occupations have
largely disappeared in contemporary
times. The Atala Akhara has traditionally
been considered a subsidiary of the
Mahanirvani akhara, at least for their
marching order in the bathing (snana)
processions for the Kumbha Mela. During
the 1998 Haridwar Kumbha Mela, the
Atala akhara demanded to be separated
from the Mahanirvanis and to be allowed
to march in their own procession; when
this request was turned down, the Atala
akhara boycotted the bathing processions
in protest. The Atala akhara is one of
the seven main Dashanami Naga
akharas, although it is now the smallest
and least important. All of the akharas
have particular features that define their
organizational identity, especially specific
guardian deities; the guardian deity of the
Atala akara is the god Ganesh.
Atharva Veda
The Atharva Veda is the last of the four
Vedas, which are the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts. In
many ways the Atharva Veda is the
most unusual. Whereas the other
three—Rg Veda, Sama Veda, and Yajur
Veda—focus mainly on sacrificial ritu-
als, the Atharva Veda is largely a collec-
tion of spells and incantations that can
be used to counter or correct misfor-
tune, and also to bring about one’s
desired result. Its unusual contents
make it very different from the other
three, and since some early sources
mention only the first three Vedas, it
apparently gained authority as a Veda
sometime later.
Atikaya
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Hindu epics, Atikaya is one the sons
of the great demon Ravana by his wife
Mandodari. Like his father, Atikaya is
described as a great devotee (bhakta)
of Shiva and, because of his constant
devotion, he gains many wondrous
weapons and powers. Atikaya fights
bravely and valiantly in the war with
Rama’s army but is eventually killed by
Rama’s brother Lakshmana.
Atita
(“gone beyond”) In its most general
usage, this term denotes an ascetic
who has completely renounced all
things and thus “gone beyond” all the
social boundaries that enmesh normal
people. It is also the name of a partic-
ular low-caste community, some of
whom are ascetics and some of whom
are householders.
Atman
Reflexive pronoun in Sanskrit gram-
mar, that can be used for all three per-
sons in the singular and that carries
the sense of “self” or “oneself.” From
the time of the mystical texts known as
the Upanishads, the word atman has
also been used to designate each
human being’s inner essence—which
is eternal, unchanging, gives one

ty’s defining characteristics.
Atranji KheraAurangzeb
Architectural site near the city of
Aligarh that is located in the modern
state of Uttar Pradesh. Excavations at
Atranji Khera have revealed an ancient
urban center dating back to the sec-
ond millennium B.C.E. The settlements
here were not as developed as those in
the Indus Valley civilization, although
they are believed to be distinct from it
and thus another potential source for
ancient Indian culture.(r. 1658–1707) The last of the great
emperors in the Moghul dynasty, after
whose reign the empire, which at its
zenith stretched over most of the Indian
subcontinent, was fragmented into
smaller kingdoms. Aurangzeb was a very
strict and pious Muslim who is generally
painted as an enemy of Hinduism. He is
the “bad” Moghul emperor, as opposed
to his great-grandfather Akbar, the
“good” Moghul emperor. Aurangzeb
unquestionably ordered several notable
acts of iconoclasm, the most renowned
being the destruction of the Vishvanath
temple in the city of Benares; however,
the records from his reign also include
orders that the Hindus of that city
should not be hindered from practicing
their religion.
One possible theory that reconciles
these contradictions is that the destruc-
tion of the Vishvanath temple and other
acts of iconoclasm were done for politi-
cal rather than religious reasons, to pun-
ish local populations for rebellion and
noncooperation. One piece of evidence
for this theory is that the year before the
destruction of the Vishvanath temple,
the Mahanirvani akhara in Benares took
part in a battle with Aurangzeb’s soldiers.
Atri
In Hindu mythology, Atri is one of the
six sons of Brahma, all of whom
become great sages. All are “mind-
born,” meaning that Brahma’s
thoughts are enough to bring them
into being. The others are Marichi,
Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
Atri is also cited as one of the seven
sages; the others are Kashyapa,
Bhrgu,
Vasishtha,
Gautama,
Bharadvaja, and Vishvamitra. All
brahmins are believed to be descended
from these seven sages, with each
family taking the name of its progeni-
tor as its gotra name.
In modern times, these gotra
divisions are still important, since
marriage within the gotra is forbidden.
After her marriage the new bride
adopts her husband’s gotra as part
of her new identity. See also
marriage prohibitions.
Aughar
Name given to a novice in the ascetic
community known as the Naths, who
are devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva.
An aughar has been initiated as a mem-
ber of the Naths and has taken up their
ascetic way of life, but he has not yet
received his final initiation. In this final

Aurobindo Ghose
(1872–1950) Freedom fighter, philoso-
pher, and ascetic yogi. He is perceived
as a modern example of the concern for
ultimate truth that always runs beneath
the surface of Hindu life.
Until he was twenty, Aurobindo
lived much of his life in England, to
fulfill his father’s desire to see his son
get a “proper” English education.
Upon his return to India, Aurobindo
was more interested in politics than in
working, and after a few years quit his
job to take part in the political struggleAvahana Akhara
against the British government. His
political career lasted only four years,
but his intellect and energy soon made
him a leader in the Bengali language
and national politics.
His life was transformed again by a
stay in prison, during which he
remembered the advice of an ascetic
who had told him to focus on his inner
self. Aurobindo later had a vision of
Swami Vivekananda, who guided his
yoga practice, and after he was
released from prison, Aurobindo with-
drew from political life. In 1910 he
moved to the French enclave of
Pondicherry in southern India, where
he lived until his death in 1950.
Aurobindo spent these years develop-
ing his spiritual life, and in his later
years he was known as Shri Aurobindo.
His teachings focus on the insights
found in the Upanishads, and stress
the development of true knowledge,
which leads to self-realization.
Auspiciousness
This is the general term for events or
conditions that cause or promote life,
prosperity, and overall well-being.
Along with purity and impurity
(ashaucha), auspiciousness and
inauspiciousness are fundamental
concepts in Hindu life.
The life-giving qualities connected
with auspiciousness make it a state
that Hindus pursue—whether through
performing rituals, scheduling impor-
tant events such as marriage cere-
monies for astrologically favorable
times, or avoiding people and things
deemed to be inauspicious. For exten-
sive information of auspiciousness
and its importance in Hindu life, see
Frederique Apffel Marglin, Wives of
the God-King, 1985.
Avadhi
Avadhi is a language known in two dif-
ferent contexts. In a literary context,
Avadhi is a dialect of medieval Hindi
(and a sister language of Braj Bhasha)
found in the eastern part of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, in the region sur-
rounding Ayodhya (Avadh). It is recog-
nized as the language in which the
poet-saint Tulsidas (1532–1623?)
wrote his vernacular retelling of the
Ramayana, the Ramcharitmanas.
In a linguistic context, Avadhi is
one of the dialects of modern standard
Hindi spoken throughout the same
region. Although it shows similarities
to the language of Tulsidas, it has
evolved from that version.
Avadhuta
(“one who has cast away [all attach-
ments]”) In its most general sense,
an avadhuta is an ascetic who does
not adhere to any social or religious
rules but his (or far more rarely,
her) own. Needless to say, their
behavior is often unpredictable, seem-
ingly capricious, and sometimes
intentionally shocking.
As a more technical title, avadhuta
is a term of respect for the senior
members of the Naga class of the
Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and who formerly
made their living as traders and
mercenary soldiers.
Avahana
(“summoning”) The first of the sixteen
upacharas (“offerings”) given to a
deity as part of worship, which is done
to treat the deity as an honored guest.
Although the literal translation of this
word (“summoning”) seems inappro-
priate for interacting with a god, the
true sense of the word is inviting the
deity to become present for worship,
just as one would invite a guest into
one’s house for hospitality.
Avahana Akhara
The name of a particular group of the
Naga class of the Dashanami Sanyasis,
which is comprised of renunciant

ascetics. The Dashanami Nagas are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva,
organized into akharas, or regiments,
on the model of an army. Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century, the
Nagas’ primary occupation was as mer-
cenary soldiers, although they also had
substantial trading interests; both of
these occupations have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times.
The Avahana akhara is one of the
seven main Dashanami Naga akharas,
but for organizational purposes it is
considered a subsidiary of the Juna
akhara. Its name, which means “sum-
mons,” supposedly comes from its sta-
tus as the first organized ascetic group,
formed in response to the call from the
philosopher Shankaracharya to revital-
ize Hindu society.

Avani
Fifth month of the Tamil solar year,
which usually falls within August and
September. This month corresponds to
[[72]]

the northern Indian solar month of
Simha (the zodiacal sign of Leo). The
existence of several different calendars
is one clear sign of the continuing
importance of regional cultural pat-
terns. One way that the Tamils retain
their culture is by preserving their tradi-
tional calendar. Tamil is one of the few
regional languages in India with an
ancient, well-established literary tradi-
tion. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Avatar
(“descent”) In Hindu mythology, the
descent (of a deity), but more colloqui-
ally the incarnation, of a deity on earth.
The concept of avatars has been best
developed by the devotees (bhakta) of
the god Vishnu, who perceive him as
taking a specific form to help the world.
Examples of avatars can be found for
other divinities as well.
Hindus draw a distinction between
full avatars, which have the complete
power of the deity, and partial incarna-
tions, or anshavatars. Vishnu has ten
full avatars, each of whom has appeared
to restore the cosmic balance when theAvimukta
world has fallen out of equilibrium. The
root cause of such disequilibrium is usu-
ally a demon (asura) who has grown too
strong and uses that power to oppress
others. This imbalance prompts Vishnu
to take form as an avatar, destroy the
evildoers, and definitively restore the
cosmic balance.
Although there is some variation in
the list of Vishnu’s avatars, the generally
accepted list is as follows: Fish, Tortoise,
Boar, Man-Lion, Vamana (dwarf ),
Parashuram, Rama, Krishna, Buddha,
and Kalki. This list of avatars follows an
“evolutionary” sequence—the first three
are animals, the fourth a hybrid man-
animal, and the ones after that mythic
heroes and sages; the exception is the
Buddha, a real person who has been
incorporated into the Hindu pantheon.
The tenth form, Kalki avatar, is yet to
come, and his coming will herald the
end of the age. Vishnu’s partial avatars—
as sages, saints, and gods—are countless
and potentially limitless, providing a
ready-made way for new Hindu move-
ments to ascribe divine authority to
their founders.
Although the avatar concept is most
commonly associated with Vishnu, it
has been applied to other Hindu gods as
well. One example of partial avatars can
be seen in the Mahabharata, the later of
the two great Hindu epics, in which all
five of the Pandava brothers are partial
incarnations of various gods. In addi-
tion, devotees of the god Shiva have
developed a list of his twenty-one
avatars, who are saints, sages, and minor
deities. This list was probably developed
in response to the Vaishnava doctrine of
avatars, but Shiva’s forms are far less
important than Vishnu’s; Vishnu’s
avatars include Rama and Krishna,
who are major objects of worship in
their own right.
For the Vaishnavas, the avatar
doctrine is generally seen as a way
to assimilate existing cults into
the pantheon by claiming that
various deities are merely different
manifestations of Vishnu. The Shaiva
avatars were developed much later,
essentially so that Shiva would also
have these forms. See also Jagannath
and Balarama.
Avidya
(“lack of [true] knowledge”) Avidya is
the absence of true understanding
and is the fundamental problem in
almost all Hindu philosophical and
religious thought. The presence of
avidya leads people to misperceive the
true nature of reality and to act based on
these misperceptions.
The most fundamental of these false
perceptions is to identify the eternal Self
(atman) with the body. As a result of this
misidentification, egoism leads one to
try to protect and advance the Self (in its
particular embodied state) and incites
feelings and actions of greed, lust, and
hatred. These feelings create bondage
for the soul and entrap it in samsara, the
cycle of rebirth.
In most Hindu philosophical
schools, the avidya tends to be con-
ceived in epistemological rather than
metaphysical terms—that is, it is not an
actual thing in its own right but exists
as a function of how one comes to
know things, insofar as that knowledge
is inaccurate or incomplete. Once one’s
deficient awareness has been corrected,
the cause of bondage is removed,
resulting in the final liberation of the
soul (moksha).
Avimukta
(“unforsaken”) The word Avimukta
carries two shades of meaning: in a
more general sense, it is a name for the
city of Benares; in a more specific sense,
it refers to the part of Benares consid-
ered to be the sacred heart of the city, in
the region centered around the
Vishvanath Temple.
Avimukta gets its name from the
belief that Shiva never leaves this
place, and because of this its proponents
claim that it is the holiest spot on earth.
See Benares.

Avvaiyar
Avvaiyar
Poet whose compositions appear in
the Sangam literature, which are col-
lections of Tamil poems written and
compiled in the early centuries of the
common era (approximately 100–300
C.E.). Avvaiyar is notable as a female
poet, indicating that certain women at
that time took an equal part in cul-
tured and intellectual society. See also
Tamil language.
Ayamatma Brahman
(“This Self is Brahman”) In the Hindu
philosophical tradition, one of the
“great utterances” (mahavakyas)
expressing ultimate truth. The truth
here is the identity of atman (the indi-
vidual Self ) and Brahman (Ultimate
Reality); this identity is the heart of the
mystical texts called the Upanishads.
Aside from their importance in a
philosophical context as fundamental
truths, four mahavakyas were also
appropriated as symbols by the four
divisions of the Dashanami Sanyasi
ascetics. Each division had its own
mahavakya, just as each had a differ-
ent Veda, a different primary sacred
center, and a different ascetic quality.
Ayamatma Brahman is the mahavakya
associated with the Anandawara divi-
sion of the Dashanami Sanyasis.
Ayana
(“going”) In the estimation of the
Hindu calendar, the word ayana refers
to the movement of the sun during its
yearly course, which is divided accord-
ing to the direction of the sun’s move-
ment. The six months that the sun
moves in a northerly direction is called
the uttarayana, and its southward
movement in the following six months
is the dakshinayana. The transition
points at which the sun changes direc-
tion do not fall on the solstices, as fig-
ured in the Gregorian calendar, but
about three weeks later on Makara
Sankranti (around January 14) and
Karka Sankranti (around July 14).
[[74]]

The sun’s northward journey is
considered a more auspicious time
than the southward journey, although
many other factors can influence the
judgment of a particular day.
Ayodhya
(“unassailable”) Sacred city (tirtha) on
the Sarayu River, in the Faizabad dis-
trict of the state of Uttar Pradesh, and
one of India’s seven sacred cities.
Ayodhya is famous as the setting for
much of the Ramayana, the later of
the two great Hindu epics, whose prin-
cipal character is the god Rama. In the
Ramayana, Ayodhya is the capital city
of Rama’s father, King Dasharatha, the
birthplace and childhood home of
Rama and his brothers, and the city to
which Rama returns in triumph after
his exile is over.
Although historians have raised
doubts about the Ramayana’s histori-
cal veracity and the reality of the
events described there, Rama’s devo-
tees (bhakta) entertain no such
doubts. For them the cult of Rama is
deeply entrenched in Ayodhya, and
various places in the city are associated
with events in the epic that are
believed to have actually occurred.
In most cases this has had no ill
effects, with the exception of the Ram
Janam Bhumi, the site identified as
Rama’s birthplace. Until 1992, this site
was occupied by the Babri Masjid, a
Muslim mosque supposedly built after
the existing temple was demolished.
On December 6 of that year, the
mosque was destroyed by teams of
activists from the Vishva Hindu
Parishad, who tore it down in just over
six hours. The destruction sparked
Hindu-Muslim riots all over India, in
which thousands of people were killed.

Ayudhapurusha
An ayudhapurusha is the personified
form of a divine weapon or emblem,
which is conceived as either mascu-
line, feminine, or neuter according to
the gender of the Sanskrit word. For
example, the words shakti (“spear”)
and gada (“club”) are portrayed as
feminine, chakra (“discus”) as neuter,
and khadga (“sword”) and trishul
(“trident”) as male.
Ayurveda
(“knowledge of life”) Ayurveda is
the best known of the indigenous
Indian medical systems and is
primarily based on the two Sanskrit
medical texts: the Charaka Samhita
(1st c. C.E.) and the Sushruta Samhita
(4th c. C.E.).
The underlying assumption in both
of these texts and in ayurveda is the
theory of the three bodily humors—
vata (wind), pitta (bile), and kapha
(phlegm). Each of these is composed
of different elements, and although
everyone has all three humors, their
relative proportions are used to
explain varying body types, metabolic
dispositions, and personalities.
People in whom vata predominates
are said to have quick minds, slender
bodies, and to be full of energy, but
they are also said to get run down
more easily than others. Pitta-domi-
nant people are said to be strong-
willed and good leaders but also
hot-tempered and bothered by heat.
Kapha-dominant people are strong,
healthy, and stable but also have ten-
dencies toward lassitude and inertia.
Each of these humors can thus
have both wholesome and unwhole-
some manifestations, but when the
humors are in relative balance, the five
bodily winds (prana) that are consid-
ered responsible for basic bodily func-
tions will work effectively, and the
person will be healthy.
According to ayurveda, disease is
caused by an imbalance of these
humors that usually has perceivable
environmental roots. One possible
cause is environmental circum-
stances, such as the stresses that the
differing seasons (hot, cold, damp,
etc.) put on varying constitutions.
The other possible cause for an
imbalance is the person’s own
behavior—improper diet, poor sleep
habits, deficient or inappropriate
bodily exertion, and other habitual
stresses on the body.
In ayurveda, people are conceived
as beings in interaction with their
environment, and ayurveda’s propo-
nents recognize that many ailments
may have multiple causes. The ulti-
mate aim of any treatment, whether
diet, exercise, or medicine, is to restore
this lost equilibrium. The equilibrium
being sought will be different for
everyone, since it will necessarily
reflect each person’s individual make-
up. For further information see Gopi
Warrier, The Complete Illustrated
Guide to Ayurveda, 1997; and Judith
Morrison, The Book of Ayurveda, 1995.
