Dabistan-I-Mazahib
(“School of Manners”) An outside
source for the religious life of the times,
and gives the earliest detailed descrip-
tion of the Sikhs, as well as many other
contemporary religious communities.
The text traditionally is ascribed to
Muhsin Fani. Fani was a Persian who
traveled through much of northern
India, apparently motivated only by his
intense curiosity to encounter the
country’s different forms of religious
life. The text is also notable for the
seeming absence of authorial bias—
Fani reports that he had simply translated
what his friends and informants had
told him, and the Dabistan’s tone seems
to maintain this claim. The text has
been translated by David Shea and
Anthony Troyer as The Dabistan, or
School of Manners, 1843.
Dadhichi
A sage in Hindu mythology who is a par-
adigm for self-sacrifice. The gods
(devas) and the demons (supernatural
beings) are engaged in a long-running
war, in which neither side can prevail.
Indra, the king of the gods, finally
decides to seek advice from the god
Brahma. Brahma advises Indra that if
he obtains a bone from Dadhichi’s
body, it can be made into a weapon that
will defeat the demons. Indra is under-
standably uncertain that his request
will be granted, but when he appears
before Dadhichi, he not only gives his
consent, but immediately abandons
his body through yogic powers. Indra
takes Dadhichi’s bones, fashions a
weapon from them, and successfully
defeats the demons.
Dadhikra
A divine war horse described in a few of
the hymns in the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts. The Vedas were
the religious hymns of a group known
as the Aryans, and hymns throughout
the Vedas clearly show the importance
of horse-drawn chariots as weapons of
war. Given this importance, it is not
surprising that one finds a divinized
horse in these hymns, even if it is only a
minor figure.
Dadu
(1554–1603) Sant poet-saint and
founder of the religious organization
known as the Dadupanth. The sants
were a group of central and northern
Indian poet-saints who share several
general tendencies: a stress on individ-
ualized, interior religion leading to a
personal experience of the divine; dis-
dain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of the
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore
conventional caste (social order) dis-
tinctions. According to tradition, Dadu
was born into a family of cotton-
carders, a fairly low-status occupation.
He is also reported to have been born a
Muslim, although based on his poetry
he seems to have been relatively unaf-
fected by Islam. His songs highlight
many of the aforementioned sant
themes. His poems also stress nonvio-
lence (ahimsa), and as a practical appli-
cation of that principle, vegetarianism.
Another prominent theme is the reli-
gious value of work, since despite his
fame he is said to have carded cotton
until his death.
Some of Dadu’s poems give lists and
categories, as if systematizing his ideas
for instruction. This suggests that he
envisioned an established community
of disciples. According to legend, Dadu
met with the Moghul emperor Akbar,
who was so impressed by Dadu’s charis-
ma that he ceased his harming of living
beings. The tale is probably fictitious,
since there are similar stories for many
of the sant poets, which all illustrate the
[[163]]
Dadupanth
well-established theme of the temporal
ruler bowing to the spiritual adept. For
further information on traditional
sources, see Winand Callewaert (trans.),

Dadupanth
Religious organization founded by the
sant poet-saint Dadu (1554–1603). The
Dadupanth is strongest in Rajasthan,
the desert state in which Dadu is
believed to have lived. The Dadupanth
stresses religious themes common to
the sant poet-saints: the rejection of rit-
ual and image worship in favor of an
internal search for a formless deity,
stress on the power of the divine Name,
and a belief in the relative unimpor-
tance of conventional caste distinc-
tions. It also emphasizes certain points
that were particularly important to
Dadu himself, among them nonvio-
lence (ahimsa), vegetarianism, and the
religious value of work. The Dadupanth
has always been a numerically small
organization, but they are historically
important because of their manuscript
collections. These collections are
known as the “five voices” (panchvani),
because they contain the works of five
different devotional (bhakti) poets:
Dadu, Kabir, Namdev, Ravidas, and
Hardas. Rajasthan’s desert climate has
helped to preserve these manuscripts,
some of which date from the early sev-
enteenth century. The Panchvani man-
uscripts are among the earliest sources
for all of these poets, which makes them
an important resource for the historical
study of northern Indian devotional
poetry. For further information on the
literary resources of the Dadupanth, see
Winand Callewaert (trans.), The
Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi Rajab, 1978;
and The Sarvangi of Gopaldas, 1993.
Dadupanthi Nagas
Particular group of Naga (fighting)
ascetics associated with the religious
community (panth) established by the
[[164]]

western Indian poet-saint Dadu. The
Nagas are renunciant ascetics orga-
nized into different akharas, or regi-
ments based on the model of an army.
Until the beginning of the nineteenth
century the Nagas’ primary occupation
was as mercenary soldiers, although
they also had substantial trading inter-
ests; both of these have largely disap-
peared in contemporary times. In the
bathing (snana) processions at the
Kumbha Mela festivals (“Festivals of the
Pot”), the Dadupanthi Nagas march
with the chatuh-sampradayi Nagas,
who are devotees (bhakta) of the god
Vishnu, but are considered indepen-
dent of them. According to tradition,
the Naga section of the Dadupanth was
established by Sundardasa, one of
Dadu’s direct disciples.
Daita
Tribal (adivasi) community in the mod-
ern state of Orissa. The Daitas are
hereditary temple servants at the tem-
ple of the god Jagannath in the city of
Puri. Jagannath has been brought into
the larger Hindu pantheon by identify-
ing him as a form of the god Krishna,
but he is originally believed to have
been a local, tribal deity. This history is
partly inferred from Jagannath’s rela-
tionships with the Daitas themselves,
who are considered Jagannath’s rela-
tives, even though their social status is
very low. This relational connection
gives the Daitas several unique roles.
During the annual Rath Yatra, a cere-
monial procession in which Jagannath,
his brother Balabhadra, and their sister
Subhadra are processed around the city
in giant wooden chariots, the Daitas
convey the deities’ giant wooden
images from the temples to the chariots
and pull the ropes that draw the carts.
An even more important role comes
when new images of the deities are con-
structed, usually every twelve or nine-
teen years. The Daitas carve the new
images, each from a single massive log.
When the new image has been completed,
the oldest Daita removes a wooden plugDaksha
in the old image that seals an interior
cavity. He then transfers a mysterious
substance called the “life substance” to
a corresponding cavity in the new
image, which is sealed with another
wooden plug. The Daita chosen to make
this transfer is blindfolded and has his
hands wrapped in layers of cloth, so he
is unable to tell exactly what is trans-
ferred, and this “life substance” is con-
sidered so sacred that the person who
makes this transfer reportedly dies soon
afterward. After the “life substance” has
been removed, the old image is consid-
ered a “corpse.” The Daitas bury it,
observe a ten-day period of ritual death
impurity (maranashaucha), and the
heirs of the deceased claim his “belong-
ings”—primarily clothes and resin,
which they sell to pilgrims. Jagannath’s
continuing relations with the Daitas
point to his origins as a local, tribal god,
and this relationship gives the Daitas
continuing special privileges.
Daiva Marriage
One of the eight ways to perform a mar-
riage recognized in the dharma litera-
ture, the treatises on religious duty
(dharma). In a Daiva marriage the
father of the bride gives away his
daughter with her ornaments to a brah-
min (priest). The priest then officiates
at a sacrifice sponsored by the father.
According to some interpretations, the
girl is given as the dakshina, or fee for
these sacrificial services. This form of
marriage was named after the gods
(devas), and was one of the four
approved (prashasta) forms of mar-
riage. Even though a daiva marriage was
considered an approved form, it fell out
of favor because of the hint that the
bride had been given as a payment for
services, rather than without any condi-
tions whatsoever. See also Marriage,
eight classical forms.
Daksha
In Hindu mythology, one of the sons of
the god Brahma, and the father of the
Image of the Hindu god Daksha. His head was
replaced with the head of a goat as the result of a
conflict with the god Shiva.
goddess Sati. Sati has been given in
marriage to the god Shiva, and Daksha’s
most famous mythic story has to do with
this divine pair. According to legend,
when Daksha feels that Shiva has not
shown him proper respect, he wants to
put Shiva in his place—even though in
this mythic story Shiva is clearly identi-
fied as the supreme deity. Inflated with
pride, Daksha plans a great sacrifice to
which he invites all the other gods, but
as an insult purposely excludes Shiva.
When Sati learns about the sacrifice, she
insists on going to it, despite Shiva’s
warning that it is unwise to go without
an invitation. When she arrives at the
sacrificial ground, and asks why her
husband has been excluded, Daksha
responds with a stream of abuse
denouncing Shiva as worthless and
despicable. Humiliated by these public
insults, Sati commits suicide—in some
versions, by leaping into the sacrificial
fire, in others by withdrawing into a
yogic trance and giving up her life. Shiva
becomes furious when he hears of Sati’s
death, and in his rage creates the fierce
deities Virabhadra and Bhadrakali. He
comes storming with his minions (gana)
to the sacrificial ground, destroys the
[[165]]
Dakshina
sacrifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.
Daksha is eventually restored to life, but
with the head of a goat rather than a
human being. He repents of his arro-
gance and worships Shiva as the highest
god. In this story, Daksha is a symbol for
the foolish pride that eventually causes
one’s destruction.
In another mythic story, Daksha is
portrayed in a more sympathetic light.
Chandra (the moon) has married
Daksha’s twenty-seven daughters, but
was paying attention to only one of the
daughters, named Rohini. Daksha
remonstrates with Chandra to give each
of his wives equal time, and when
Chandra ignores this advice, Daksha
curses him to lose his luster. As Chandra
begins to wane, the other gods intercede
with Daksha, and implore him to modify
the curse. At their urgent prompting,
Daksha decrees that Chandra will only
wane for half the month and then wax
for the other half. He then directs
Chandra to take a bath at the Somnath
temple in Gujarat state, which will heal
him from the original curse. Here
Daksha is still powerful and imperious,
but his actions are rooted in his concern
for his daughters.
Dakshina
(“preceptor’s fee”) Gifts or fees given to
one’s teacher in return for the services
rendered. The paradigm for this goes
back to the dharma literature, or the
texts on religious duty (dharma), which
propose an idealized doctrine for the
four stages (ashramas) of a man’s life.
The first of these stages is as a celibate
student (brahmacharin), in which the
young man will live in his teacher’s
household and commence studying the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
At the conclusion of his studies, the stu-
dent will give his teacher dakshina as a
sign of appreciation. In modern times
this pattern has been extended to other
contexts, particularly the arts, and it has
become customary for students to
give gifts to their teachers on various
occasions, particularly on the full moon
[[166]]

known as Guru Purnima, which usually
falls in June or July. Dakshina is always
given in exchange for services, and is
thus essentially payment that is “owed”
for these services. In this aspect it is a
very different mode of exchange from
dana (charitable giving). Dana gener-
ates religious merit, but the donor
receives nothing tangible in return.
Dakshinachara
(“right-hand practice”) In the secret ritual
tradition known as tantra, this is the
term for a type of tantric practice that
does not avail itself of any forbidden
substances or promote any behavior
that the orthodox would consider scan-
dalous or objectionable. It stands in
opposition to the vamachara, or “left-
hand practice,” which uses such forbid-
den substances in its ritual, and shows
no such regard for conventional sensi-
bilities. The most common forbidden
substances are the Five Forbidden
Things (panchamakara), so called
because they all begin with the letter
“m” (in the sacred language of Sanskrit,
makara) madya (wine), matsya (fish),
mamsa (meat), mudra (fermented or
parched grain), and maithuna (copula-
tion). In left-hand tantra these forbid-
den things are used in their actual
forms, whereas right-hand practitioners
substitute
other
more
socially
acceptable things for them. This is one
more instance of the pervasive Hindu
polarity between right and left, which
carries inherent value judgments. In this
case, the left-hand practitioners are
seen as impure and dangerous, because
they intentionally violate social bound-
aries, whereas the right-hand are
socially respectable. For further

Cities, 1990.Dakshineshwar
Temple in Dakshineshwar dedicated to the goddess Kali.
Dakshinayana
The six months of the solar year in
which the sun is reckoned as moving
southward. In the Gregorian calendar,
this is the period between the summer
solstice and the winter solstice (roughly
December 20 to June 20) and is based on
the actual motion of the sun with
respect to the earth. The Indian reckon-
ing is based on the motion of the sun
through the zodiac, which is calculated
differently than in western astrology. The
Dakshinayana begins on Karka
Sankranti (the day the sun is thought to
enter Cancer, usually July 14), and ends
the day before Makara Sankranti (the
day the sun enters Capricorn, usually
January 14). The Dakshinayana is con-
sidered less auspicious than the
Uttarayana, the six months in which the
sun travels north, because the southern
direction is associated with the Yama,
the god associated with death, judg-
ment, and punishment for evildoers.
Dakshineshwar
Temple site about four miles north
of modern Calcutta, on the eastern bank
of the Hugli River. Dakshineshwar’s
[[167]]
Dalit
primary deity is the powerful and dan-
gerous goddess Kali, although like most
Hindu temples it also has images of
most of the deities in the pantheon.
Dakshineshwar’s importance comes not
from its age—the primary image was
consecrated in 1855, and it is thus a rel-
atively recent site—but through its
association with the Bengali saint
Ramakrishna, who lived there for most
of his life.
Dalit
(“oppressed”) Modern name for the
social groups that have the lowest social
status, groups that in earlier times
would have been called Harijan or
untouchable. This term is significant
because it is the name used by low-
status groups to designate themselves as
members of a disadvantaged group.
Adoption and popularization of this
term reflects their growing awareness of
the situation, and their greater assertive-
ness in demanding their legal and con-
stitutional rights. In certain parts of the
country, particularly in the state of
Maharashtra, the Dalits have formed a
militant organization called the Dalit
Panthers, modeled after the Black
Panthers in America.
Damaru
Hourglass-shaped hand drum, which
has membranes stretched over the top
and bottom of the hourglass, and at the
middle, two strings with a bead at the
end. The drum is played by holding it by
its narrow middle and rotating the hand
back and forth so that the beads strike
the drumheads. The pace of the rhythm
(tala) is determined by the speed of
hand movement. In Hindu iconography,
this drum is almost invariably associated
with the god Shiva. In his form as
Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance, the
drum signifies the rhythm by which
Shiva undertakes the creation of the
universe. Another iconic motif is to
show the damaru hanging from Shiva’s
trident. In modern times this drum is
[[168]]

often carried by ascetics, either because
of its association with Shiva, its portabil-
ity, or both. See also iconic image.
Damayanti
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of the
king of Vidarbha and the wife of King
Nala. The story of Nala and Damayanti
appears as a story within the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. It is recounted to the five
Pandava brothers, the epic’s protago-
nists, during a twelve-year exile in the
forest as a way to keep up their spirits by
telling how others had transcended
misfortune.
In the story, when Damayanti comes
of marriageable age, her father sends
invitations to the kings of the earth,
announcing her svayamvara, a rite in
which Damayanti will choose her own
husband. The kings of the earth come to
the svayamvara to seek her hand, as do
the gods (devas) themselves. Yet
Damayanti has already decided, with
the help of a swan who has praised King
Nala to her, to choose Nala. The gods try
to foil this by taking on physical bodies
identical to Nala, so that Damayanti will
not be able to tell the difference between
them. As a last resort, Damayanti makes
an act of truth, a ritual action whose
efficacy is based on the power of truth
itself. In her act of truth, Damayanti
declares that she has never loved any-
one but Nala, and directs the gods to
resume their true forms to prove that
this statement is true. The gods immedi-
ately do as she commands, compelled
by the power of truth. Nala and
Damayanti are married, and as a reward
for her fidelity the gods give Nala various
divine gifts. Hearing of the marriage, two
of the rejected suitors curse Nala to lose
his kingdom, and like all curses in
Indian mythology, this eventually comes
to pass. Because of the curse, Nala and
Damayanti are separated and suffer
long tribulations, including Nala having
his body magically changed so that no
one would be able to recognize him. In
the end Damayanti recognizes him byDance
his divine gifts, which could not be hid-
den, and the lovers are happily reunited.
Damodara
(dama “rope” + udara “waist”) Epithet of
the god Krishna, given in memory of a
particular incident in his childhood. In
an effort to curb Krishna’s mischief by
restricting his movements, Krishna’s fos-
ter mother, Yashoda, uses a rope to tie
her toddling boy to the heavy stone
mortar used in grinding grain. The mor-
tar’s weight is more than sufficient to
restrain any normal child, but for
Krishna it proves no hindrance, and he
proceeds to crawl about, dragging the
mortar after him. At one point the mor-
tar becomes wedged between two trees
growing closely together, and Krishna
pulls so hard that the trees are uprooted.
After the trees fall to the ground, they
immediately disappear, and in their
place stand two young men. These are
sons of the god Kubera who have been
cursed to take the form of a tree until
Krishna comes to save them.
Dampati
(“husband and wife”) In Indian art and
architecture, the figure of a married
couple. These are usually portrayed as
standing next to one another and are
usually devoid of any sexual connota-
tion. This is unlike the more famous
mithuna figures, which are engaged in
sexual activity.
Dana
(“giving”) Charitable giving. This is a
common religious practice, for it is
believed to be a pious act that generates
religious merit. Dana is especially preva-
lent at pilgrimage places and other
sacred sites (tirthas), since the sacred-
ness of these places is believed to mag-
nify the consequences of any act,
whether good or bad. Dana is one of the
traditional paradigms for exchange, the
other being dakshina (preceptor’s fee).
The difference between them is that
dakshina is a fee for services, whereas
dana is given freely and brings one no
tangible benefits. Aside from the intan-
gible religious merit generated by
dana, it is also a common way to get rid
of any inauspiciousness or ill fortune,
which is transferred to the receiver
along with the gift. This assumption
makes receiving dana karmically risky,
whereas there are no such stigmas
associated with dakshina. People who
live solely by receiving gifts, such as
beggars at pilgrimage sites, are thus in
an unenviable position, since they are
commonly described as “vessels”
(patras) for the depositing of ill for-
tune. Yet this transfer of inauspicious-
ness is a pervasive pattern in regular
society, and even within the family there
are means to transfer inauspiciousness
through well-established gift-giving pat-
terns, particularly the kanyadan, or gift
of a bride in marriage. For further infor-
mation on dana and gift-giving patterns,
see Gloria Goodwin Raheja, The Poison
in the Gift, 1988.
Danava
(“descendants of Danu”) In Hindu
mythology, the sons of Danu with her
husband, the divine sage Kashyapa.
Kashyapa is the chief of the Prajapatis, a
class of semi-divine beings, and Danu
herself is the daughter of the demigod
Daksha, so their children have divine
blood from both sides of their lineage.
The name Danava is a general term for
all the families of demons (supernatural
beings), or more properly, asuras. The
asuras are powerful divine beings, who
have legitimate interests of their own,
but whose interests often run counter to
those of human beings as well as those
of the gods (devas). Asuras are thus usu-
ally opposed to the gods—a sense of
opposition carried by the English word
“demon”—but they are not perceived as
inherently evil.
Dance
In traditional Hindu culture, all of the per-
forming arts had intimate connections
[[169]]
Dance
Dancers performing in the Manipuri style.
with religious life, and dance was no
exception to this pattern. In their art,
dancers merely follow the divine model,
since in Indian mythology Shiva is the pre-
eminent dancer; indeed, in his dancing he
first creates the universe and later destroys
it. Several classical dance forms can be
directly tied to specific Hindu temples. The
Bharatanatyam form developed in the
temples of Tamil Nadu beginning at the
Brhadeshvar temple in Tanjore, and is
immortalized in the sculptures of the Shiva
temple at Chidambaram. The Orissi style
came from the temple of Jagannath in the
city of Puri, on the Bay of Bengal. Some of
the other classical styles were traditionally
performed only in temples, or had their
beginnings in religious festivals: the
Kathakali form in the state of Kerala, the
Kuchipudi form in Andhra Pradesh, the
Chau form in eastern India, and the
Manipuri form in Manipur. The only
exception is the northern Indian Kathak
form, whose birth and performance lay in
a court rather than a temple setting, but
which in its subject matter often treated
religious themes, particularly ones drawn
from devotion to the god Krishna.
All of these styles share a highly artic-
ulated language of gesture (mudra) and
expression, through which the dancer
can tell a story to the audience. As in all
the classical arts, the dancer’s aim is not
only to entertain, but to create and con-
vey a particular aesthetic mood (rasa),
[[170]]

which will evoke a corresponding emo-
tion (bhava) from the audience. Beyond
these general similarities, each form has
a certain characteristic and stylistic
quality. Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and
Orissi are the most clearly related forms,
but where Bharatanatyam presents a
sharply geometric line, with a stiff upper
body, the lines presented by Kuchipudi
and Orissi are progressively softer,
rounder, and more fluid. Kathakali is
characterized by elaborate costumes
and stage makeup, and also by its partic-
ular stress on developing and control-
ling facial mobility. These things
facilitate ease and power of expression.
Manipuri and Chau are both highly
athletic forms, clearly showing the
influence of folk dance, and Chau is
unusual in that the dancers always
wear masks, which sets a prevailing
mood. Kathak is the only dance form in
which the legs are kept straight; this
form stresses intricate footwork in
which the bells on the dancer’s ankles
serve as a complement and counter-
point to the drum, combined with dra-
matic turns and spins.
As mentioned above, all the dance
forms except for Kathak developed in
some sort of religious context. In many
of these latter cases, dance was an offer-
ing presented to the deity, and was
primarily performed for the deity’s
entertainment, although the otherDandaniti
spectators could enjoy it, as well.
Although different schools have differ-
ent typologies, the most pervasive dis-
tinction is between “pure” dance
(nrtya), conveying nothing beyond the
dancer’s skill in movement, and “acting”
dance (natya or abhinaya), in which the
dancer tells some sort of story. Until the
twentieth century, the dancers were
usually temple servants known as
devadasis. The devadasis were officially
married to the temple’s deity and per-
formed various ritual services in the
temples as his “wives,” but they could
have liaisons with other men as they
wished. Any children from these liaisons
would also be in the service of the tem-
ple—their sons as musicians, and their
daughters as dancers. At times this
arrangement degenerated into common
prostitution, but in many cases it was
recognizably different. These women
had status and property of their own,
even though their status was unusual,
and thus marginal. In the twentieth cen-
tury the dance performance site has
moved from the temple to the stage,
which has had a number of effects on
transforming it from a form of worship
to a performing art. For further informa-
tion on the history of the dance and its
particular manifestations, see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984. For a masterful analysis of
the devadasis, see Frederique Apffel
Marglin, Wives of the God-King, 1985.
Danda
(“stick”) A symbol of authority in tradi-
tional Hindu culture. On one hand, this
stick referred to royal authority and was
visibly evident as a scepter or mace, but
was considered emblematic of the king’s
obligation to maintain social order by
inflicting punishment on evildoers. This
rule through punishment (dandaniti)
was the king’s role and duty in traditional
Indian ideas of kingship, for without
such rule normal social life would be
impossible. In a different context, the
staff can be a symbol of ascetic
authority. Among the Dashanami
Sanyasis, a group of ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Shiva, the
ascetics with the highest status carry a
staff as a sign of their authority, and are
known as Dandi Sanyasis.
Danda Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the arm and hand are extended
straight forward, like a stick (danda).
Dandakaranya
A particular forest (aranya) in the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Indian epics. This is where the god
Rama, the epic’s protagonist; his wife
Sita; and his brother Lakshmana live
during the latter part of their fourteen
years in exile, in their ashram (abode) in
the village of Panchavati. Many of the
epic’s pivotal events take place in this
forest: Rama and Lakshmana’s humilia-
tion and mutilation of the demoness
Shurpanakha, their destruction of the
demon army led by her brothers Khara
and Dushana, and Sita’s abduction
by Shurpanakha’s third brother
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka. The
Dandaka forest’s actual location is
uncertain, since many of the events in
the Ramayana cannot be set in any
particular place. One traditional
location for Panchavati, however, is just
outside of the city of Nasik in the state
of Maharashtra.
Dandaniti
(“rule through the stick”) In the dharma
literature, or the texts on religious duty
(dharma), dandaniti is the preservation
of social order by inflicting punishment
on evildoers. This rule through punish-
ment was the king’s role and duty in tra-
ditional Indian ideas of kingship, for
without such rule it was believed that
normal social life would be impossible.
[[171]]
Dandasana
Dandasana
(“staff-posture”) One of the sitting pos-
tures (asana) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras (aphorisms on
yoga). In this position, the upper body is
erect, the arms are straight with the
hands flat on the ground and pointing
forward, and the legs are outstretched
with the big toes, ankles, and knees
touching one another.
Dandavat (“stick-like”) Pranam
Type of reverential salutation in which
the person lies prostrate on the ground
with the arms extended (hence the com-
parison between the body and a stick).
This shows the highest reverence of all
greetings, since one’s entire body is in
contact with the ground.
Dandi Sanyasi
Among the Dashanami Sanyasis, or the
ascetic devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva, the Dandi Sanyasis are the
most prestigious of the three general
ascetic types; the others being the
Paramahamsa and the Naga Sanyasis.
Dandi Sanyasis take their name from the
staff (danda) that they are given at their
ascetic initiation and that they carry for
the rest of their lives as a sign of ascetic
restraint. The danda is always kept off
the ground to maintain its purity. The
Dandi Sanyasis tend to put the highest
stress on the importance of Sanskrit
(sacred language) learning and uphold
the traditional social and cultural values
it propounds. Of the ten Dashanami
divisions, Dandis tend to belong to
those divisions that will only initiate
brahmins—that is, the Saraswati,
Ashrama, and Tirtha divisions, and also
some sections of the Bharati division. In
many cases, Dandi Sanyasis are initiated
as ascetics only after having completed
the other three stages of life (ashra-
mas), fulfilling the idealized pattern in
the dharma literature, the texts on reli-
gious duty. Thus, their ascetic status
does not come only from the strictness
of their ascetic observance, for which
[[172]]

they are rightly famous. It also reflects
the continuing influence of their former
“worldly” status, which was supposedly
left behind upon ascetic initiation, and
their adherence to traditional idealized
cultural patterns. The philosopher
Shankaracharya, traditionally named
as the Dashanami order’s founder, was
himself believed to be a Dandi Sanyasi.
This pattern of leadership still
continues, since even now Dandi
Sanyasis are invariably chosen for the
Shankaracharyas, the religious leaders
who preside over the four monastic cen-
ters (maths). These centers supposedly
were established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, and in many cases
these present leaders have been lifelong
ascetics, as Shankaracharya is believed
to have been. For further information
see Dana Sawyer, “Monastic Structure of
Banarsi Dandi Sadhus,” in Bradley R.
Hertel and Cynthia Ann Humes (eds.),
Living Banaras, 1993.
Dan Lila
One of the types of divine play (lila)
between the god Krishna and his devo-
tees (bhakta). In this lila, the adolescent
Krishna intercepts the gopis, his cow-
herding female friends, who are on their
way to the city of Mathura to sell their
butter and curds. Krishna refuses to let
them pass until they give him some as a
gift (dana). The story of this lila is often
presented in religiously oriented theatri-
cal presentations, which are themselves
known as lilas (“plays”), since their func-
tion is to reveal the work of the divine.
This lila is but one instance in a long his-
tory of butter thievery. For further infor-
mation see John Stratton Hawley,
Krishna: The Butter Thief, 1983.
Dantavaktra
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Dantavaktra is
an asura or demon king who is the
rebirth of Vijaya, one of the gatekeep-
ers of the god Vishnu. Vijaya has been
cursed to be reborn three times as anDashanami
asura and to be killed each time by
Vishnu. In his previous incarnations
Vijaya is born as Hiranyakashipu,
who is killed by the Man-Lion avatar
(one incarnation of the god Vishnu)
and as Kumbhakarna, who is killed by
Vishnu’s Rama avatar. When Dantavaktra
is killed by Krishna, the curse is broken,
and Vijaya returns to his rightful place.
Darshan
(“seeing”) By far the most common reli-
gious act in popular modern Hinduism,
darshan designates direct eye contact
between the devotee (bhakta) and the
image of a deity, which is considered to
be a conscious, perceiving being. Such
intimate interaction is a way to commu-
nicate with the deity on a personal basis,
which is similar to the stress on the indi-
vidual found in bhakti (devotional) reli-
giosity. For further information see
Diana Eck, Darsan, 1985.
Darshan
(2) (“perspective”) In the context of
Indian philosophy, this is the word most
often used to designate a philosophical
“school.” The word itself comes from the
verb “to see,” and thus can be loosely
translated as a “point of view,” “perspec-
tive,” or “[way of] seeing.” In a diverse
and competitive philosophical culture,
this is a neutral way to describe a philo-
sophical position, whether or not one
agrees with it.
Dasa (“servant”) Bhava
The second of the five modes of devo-
tion (system of devotion to a deity) to
God that were most prominently
articulated by Rupa Goswami, a devo-
tee (bhakta) of the god Krishna and a
follower of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Rupa used differing types of human
relationships as models for differing
conceptions of the link between deity
and devotee. These five modes
showed growing emotional intensity,
from the peaceful (shanta) sense that
comes from realizing one’s complete
identity with Brahman, or Ultimate
Reality, to conceiving of God as one’s
master, friend, child, or lover. The
Dasa Bhava is the second of these, in
which devotees considered them-
selves as servants and the deity as
their master. This second mode of
devotion should be understood in
light of the relationship between mas-
ters and servants in Indian society,
which goes far beyond that of employ-
er and employee in modern American
society. A family’s servants will often
stay with a family for many years and
in some cases, such service becomes
hereditary. Longtime servants become
virtual members of the family; they
are respected, trusted, and sometimes
regarded as advisers.
Dashamukha
(“ten-faced”) In the Ramayana, the ear-
lier of the two great Indian epics, this
was one of the epithets of Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. This name is
descriptive, since Ravana has ten heads.
Dashanami
(“ten names”) Collective name for the
ten divisions among the Sanyasis, an
ascetic order supposedly founded by
the great philosopher Shankaracharya,
whose members are devotees of the
god Shiva. These ten divisions are each
distinguished by a different name,
which is taken as a surname by
an ascetic after his initiation in the
division. These ten names are Giri
(“mountain”), Parvata (“mountain”),
Sagara (“ocean”), Saraswati (the god-
dess of learning), Bharati (“India”), Puri
(“city”), Aranya (“forest”), Vana (“for-
est”), Tirtha (“crossing-place”), and
Ashrama (“hermitage”).
Although all of the ten divisions are
Dashanami Sanyasis, there are internal
status differences based on the distinc-
tion between three ascetic classes:
Dandi, Paramahamsa, and Naga. The
Dandi Sanyasis, named for the staff
(danda) that they must always carry,
[[173]]
Dasharatha
have the strongest connection with clas-
sical Sanskrit (sacred language) learn-
ing, are the strictest in their ascetic
practices, and tend to be the most con-
servative in their social views. Dandi
Sanyasis often follow ascetic initiation
only after having completed the other
three stages of life (ashramas), and thus
fulfill the idealized pattern in the dharma
literature, the texts on religious duty.
Dandi Sanyasis were virtually always
brahmins (priests) before becoming
ascetics, and almost all Dandis belong to
the Dashanami divisions that will only
initiate brahmins—that is, the Saraswati,
Ashrama, Tirtha, and some sections of
the Bharati divisions. The remaining
Dashanami divisions will admit mem-
bers from all four of the traditional
social classes: brahmins, kshatriyas,
vaishyas, and shudras. Members from
the first three groups, known as “twice-
born” because they are eligible for the
adolescent religious initiation known as
the “second birth,” are initiated as
Paramahamsa Sanyasis, whereas shu-
dras are initiated as Naga, or militant
ascetics. Thus, despite the supposed loss
of identity among ascetics after formally
“renouncing” the world, one can see the
continuing influence of a person’s for-
mer worldly status.
These ten divisions are collected into
four larger organizational groups:
Anandawara, Bhogawara, Bhuriwara,
and Kitawara. Each of these groups has
two or three of the ten Dashanami
orders, and each is centered in one of
the four sacred centers (maths) suppos-
edly established by Shankaracharya.
Each of these four groups is also associ-
ated with one of the four Vedas—the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, a different
geographical quarter of India, a different
“great utterance” (mahavakya), and a
different ascetic quality.
Dasharatha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Dasharatha is a king
of the Ikshvaku dynasty and the father
of Rama, the epic’s protagonist.
[[174]]

Dasharatha is generally portrayed as a
good king, but like many characters in
Indian mythology, his ultimate destiny
is governed by the result of a curse,
whose effects he is unable to avoid. As a
young man, Dasharatha is very fond of
hunting. On one occasion, he blindly
sends an arrow to the spot where he
hears the sound of an animal drinking
at a stream. When he investigates, he is
horrified to discover a young man struck
by his arrow, with the water pot he had
been filling by his side. With his dying
breaths the young man informs
Dasharatha that he is the sole source of
support for his blind parents and com-
mands Dasharatha to inform them of
his death. Dasharatha is a man of honor
and fulfills the boy’s last request. When
the boy’s father hears the story, he angri-
ly curses Dasharatha to die in similar
grief, bereft of his sons.
For many years it seemed as if this
curse would not come true, since
Dasharatha had no sons, even though
he had three wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi,
and Sumitra. Dasharatha sponsors vari-
ous religious rites for the birth of sons,
and finally commissions the sage
Rishyashringa to perform a great sacri-
fice. At the rite’s conclusion, a shining
figure emerges from the sacrificial fire,
places a pot of milk-rice before
Dasharatha, and directs him to feed it to
his wives. Dasharatha divides the con-
tents of the pot between Kausalya and
Kaikeyi, each of whom give some to
Sumitra. In due time Kausalya bears
Rama, Kaikeyi gives birth to Bharata,
and Sumitra (by virtue of receiving a
share from each of her co-wives) bears
the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
As his sons grow into manhood
Dasharatha is blissfully happy, and the
memory of the curse fades from his
mind. As a young man, Rama shows his
prowess and goodness, and Dasharatha
decides to anoint him as the heir-
apparent. Yet the night before this cere-
mony, the curse finally comes to
fruition. During the preparations pre-
ceding Rama’s investiture, the mind of
his stepmother Kaikeyi has been slowlyDashavatara Stotra
poisoned by the whisperings of her
maid Manthara. Manthara convinces
Kaikeyi that she and her son Bharata will
be mere slaves after Rama is crowned
the heir-apparent. This prompts Kaikeyi
to take drastic action. Many years
before, Dasharatha promised Kaikeyi
two blessings as reward for her help in
winning a great battle. She has never
asked for these, but she now requests
that Rama spend fourteen years in forest
exile, and that her own son, Bharata,
shall rule in his place. Dasharatha
pleads with Kaikeyi to change her mind,
but she is adamant that her wishes have
to be granted if Dasharatha will retain
the unbroken family honor. Dasharatha
later pleads with Rama to disobey him
and take over the kingdom by force, but
Rama refuses this as it is an unrighteous
action. Rama leaves for the forest, thus
upholding the family honor, but in his
sorrow at being separated from Rama,
Dasharatha dies of a broken heart.
Dashavatar
(“ten descents”) Collective name for the
ten avatars (incarnations on earth) of
the god Vishnu. In each case, Vishnu
takes form to restore the cosmic equilib-
rium when it has been thrown out of
balance by the action of a particular
demon. See also avatar.
Dashavatara Stotra
(“Hymn to the Ten Avatars”) The open-
ing canto of the Gitagovinda, a twelfth-
century lyric poem written by the poet
Jayadeva. The Gitagovinda is an allegory
of the union of the human soul with the
divine, described through the story of
the god Krishna and his human lover
Radha. At the narrative level, this tale
describes the couple’s initial passionate
lovemaking, followed by jealousy, anger,
and estrangement. It concludes with
their reconciliation and an even more
passionate reunion.
Although it is preceded by a short
introduction, the Dashavatara Stotra
is the text’s true beginning. The
The Dashavatara Stotra is the opening song
in the Gitagovinda, a twelfth-century
lyrical poem that tells the story of the god
Krishna and his human lover Radha.
Dashavatara Stotra is a hymn paying
homage to the ten avatars or earthly
incarnations of the god Krishna, each
of whom has been responsible for pre-
serving the cosmos in a time of crisis.
Jayadeva uses this opening hymn to
remind his readers that the Krishna of
his story is no mere mortal lover—
even though the story employs the
language and images commonly
found in Sanskrit love poetry—but
rather the lord and master of the uni-
verse, who has saved it from destruc-
tion again and again. The context
supplied by the images in this opening
hymn alert the reader that this text is
not merely a love story.
Jayadeva is unusual in describing the
god Krishna as the source of the ten
avatars, since Krishna is more commonly
considered an avatar of the god Vishnu.
This theological difference stems from
Jayadeva’s connection with the
Jagannath temple in the city of Puri.
Jagannath is said to be a form of
Krishna, but it is generally accepted that
[[175]]
Dasyu
[[176]]

Jagannath was originally an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity who hap-
pened to be Puri’s local deity. Identifying
him with Krishna was a way to assimi-
late Jagannath into the Hindu pantheon.
For Jayadeva, Jagannath-Krishna is thus
the supreme deity, not an avatar, and the
place usually occupied by Krishna in
Jayadeva’s enumeration of the avatars is
taken by Krishna’s brother, Balarama.

the Dark Lord, 1977.group of people speak Brahui, which is a
member of the Dravidian language fam-
ily. This Brahui-speaking community is
entirely surrounded by people speaking
Indo-Aryan languages, and the simplest
theory for this anomaly is that these
Brahui speakers are an isolated linguis-
tic fragment of that earlier time. These
theories are intriguing, but it is naive to
read the Vedas as an objective historical
account, or even to assume that any of
its references correspond to events out-
side the sacred world to which they were
the key.
DasyuDattatreya
(“slave”) The name used for non-Aryan
peoples in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
sacred texts. The words Aryan and
Dasyu are an “us” and “them” opposi-
tion—in essence, the people who com-
posed the Vedas called themselves
Aryans, and referred to the “outsiders”
as Dasyus. Although one cannot be cer-
tain whether these names refer to a par-
ticular group of people, or any group of
all, one theory is that the Aryans were a
people who had migrated from outside
of India, and the Dasyus were the
indigenous people in northern India.
The Vedas describe the Dasyus as living
in fortified cities, some of which were
destroyed by the god Indra. Some read-
ers have interpreted this image as the
Aryans’ destruction of the Indus Valley
cities, but there is little historical record
for such spectacular conquests.
Other hymns in the Vedas describe
the Dasyus as dark-skinned and nose-
less, which is generally taken to mean
flat-nosed. This has led some to identify
the Dasyus with the Dravidian language
speakers who now live in southern
India, since some of them share these
characteristics. According to this belief,
the Dravidian language speakers would
have been gradually displaced toward
the south as the Indo-Aryan language
speakers—in short, the Aryans—came
into India from the north. One piece of
linguistic evidence for this comes from
modern Pakistan, in which a smallIn the religious texts known as the
puranas, Dattatreya is a famous ascetic
and is considered to be a partial avatar
(incarnation) of the god Vishnu. Many
modern ascetics consider him a para-
digm for asceticism, and Dattatreya has
actually been installed as a deity in cer-
tain places associated with ascetics,
such as Mount Girnar. Dattatreya’s
mother is Anasuya, and he is born after
she has done a great favor to the gods.
According to the story, a faithful wife
named Silavati curses the sun not to
rise, and in consequence the creatures
of the earth are greatly troubled.
Anasuya succeeds in persuading Silavati
to recall her curse, and in their grati-
tude, the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and
Shiva inform her that she may ask for
whatever she wants. Anasuya requests
that each be born as one of her sons,
and this is granted: Vishnu is born as
Dattatreya, Shiva as Durvasas, and
Brahma as Chandra.
Datura
(from Sanskrit word dhattura) Name for
a genus of plants known as the thorn-
apple, which is a distant relative of the
potato. The datura plant contains poiso-
nous alkaloids, which when consumed
in small quantities produce intoxica-
tion, and in larger quantities, sickness
and death. Devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva eat the datura plant’s swollenDaughters
Seed of the datura, or thorn-apple.
Devotees of the god Shiva eat the
intoxicating seedpods, which can be lethal
if consumed in large amounts.
seedpods as intoxicants, in imitation of
their patron divinity’s narcotic revels.
Needless to say, because of its danger,
datura must be consumed with great
care, and under the direction of some-
one who knows its nature.
Daughters
The status of female children varies
widely in Hindu society, based on
regional customs, the position of the
social subgroup (jati/caste) to which a
family belongs, and the particular cir-
cumstances of individual families. In
general, although the birth of a daugh-
ter is a welcome event, it brings greater
responsibility than the birth of a son.
Parents have a religious duty to arrange
a daughter’s marriage, and this is still
taken very seriously, since her marriage
is seen as the key to her continued mate-
rial prosperity, as well as her fulfillment
as a human being. The gift of a daughter
(kanyadan) in marriage brings the par-
ents immense religious merit, but also
an onerous economic obligation.
Arranging a marriage in modern India
usually involves considerable time,
anxiety, and expense. The last comes not
only from the expenses of the wedding
ceremonies, but also from the practice
of giving a dowry (gift to the groom’s
family) with the bride, which is still quite
common. In many poor families, the
birth of multiple daughters is often seen
as a disaster, since their families will be
unable to marry them properly.
Aside from the expense and trouble,
in many parts of India daughters are
often seen as “temporary” members of
their natal families. After their marriages
they will live in their marital homes and
become part of their marital families,
whereas their brothers will bring their
brides into their natal home and will live
there for the rest of their lives. It is upon
these sons and their wives that the par-
ents will depend for support in their old
age, as well as for the performance of
ancestral rites after their deaths. This is
the traditional pattern throughout
much of India; although as the forces of
modernity have changed the joint family,
it has become more common for hus-
bands and wives to live separately from
their parents. This pattern also shows
considerable local variation. For exam-
ple, because the brahmin community in
southern India is so small, cross-cousin
marriage is fairly common there, and in
this circumstance a woman is actually
moving from one branch of her family
to another.
These economic and social factors
have sometimes led to unfortunate con-
sequences. Consciously or uncon-
sciously, one often finds that sons are
favored over daughters in many signifi-
cant ways: in their access to education;
in their opportunities, which are
deemed more important for men
because of their need to support a family;
in Hindu inheritance laws (in which
sons get a much larger share, under the
presumption that they will be support-
ing a family); and in poorer families, in
which sons are favored for even more
basic needs such as food and access to
medical care. Despite these general pat-
terns, it must be emphasized that many
families treat all their children with
[[177]]
Day, Structure of
equal love and care. This is particularly
true in contemporary times, and given
the trend toward smaller families, the
birth of a daughter is cause for just as
much rejoicing as the birth of a son. See
also arranged marriage.
Day, Structure of
In some sense, most divisions of time
are arbitrary, which is a feature that
appears in several different dimensions
of the traditional Indian divisions of the
day. The twenty-four hours of the solar
day can be divided using several differ-
ent measures of time, some of which do
not exactly correspond with one another,
and these differing times can also be
subject to judgments about their sym-
bolic values. In one system, the day is
divided into eight equal periods (pra-
hars) of three hours each. These eight
periods mark the general progress dur-
ing the day and night, with the first of
these prahars ending at sunrise. Shorter
units of time are reckoned in periods of
about twenty-four minutes called
ghatikas, of which there are sixty in
every twenty-four hours. The ghatika
supposedly takes its name from the clay
pots (ghata) that were used to make
water-clocks; these pots measured time
by the amount of water that dripped
through a small hole. Two ghatikas make
a muhurta, of which there are thirty
during each twenty-four hours. The
reckonings of the day in prahars and
ghatikas thus do not exactly correspond
to one another, since each prahar has
[[7]]
.5 ghatikas. Based on this, it would
seem that the former marks the more
general divisions of each day and the
latter more specific time periods.
The other way in which the times of
day can be viewed is with regard to their
symbolic value. The most auspicious
time of day is the “Time of Brahma”
(Brahma muhurta), the period immedi-
ately before sunrise. This is reckoned the
best time of the entire day for worship,
meditation, or any type of religious
practice. Although this is named a
muhurta, and thus should be limited to
[[178]]

forty-eight minutes, the Brahma muhurta
is often thought to encompass the entire
three hours in the day’s first prahar.
Hence, it is not unusual for devout
religious people to arise around 3 A.M.,
to take advantage of this period. In con-
trast, the immediately preceding prahar
(roughly midnight to 3 A.M.) is the most
inauspicious in the day, a time when
spirits and demons are loose. Sleep is
the most appropriate activity for this
time; other activities are appropriate
only when absolutely necessary. The
only time religious practices are done
during this time is when they are part of
an all-night ceremony (jagaran), or a
continuous reading (akhand path) of a
religious text. In following the most
inauspicious and chaotic period with
the most auspicious, the cycle of the day
(as well as the year) mirrors that of the
cosmos, whose gradual and continuing
degeneration are suddenly replaced
with complete renewal and regeneration.

Dayabhaga
(“division of inheritance”) Pivotal legal
text, written by the Bengali scholar
Jimutavahana (early twelfth century).
As its name would indicate, the
Dayabhaga was concerned with matters
of inheritance, partition, and the divi-
sion of property, and it eventually
became the primary legal code for the
entire Bengal cultural region. The inher-
itance pattern in the Dayabhaga stresses
succession, which is very different from
the predominant Hindu pattern of sur-
vivorship. Survivorship vests all surviv-
ing males in the male line with equal
shares of the family property, but gives
no inheritance to women. Under this
arrangement, the death of a male heir
automatically increases the share of all
the other surviving males, whereas their
share decreases when another male is
born. Under the succession model in the
Dayabhaga, sons do not become share-
holders of the family property at birth,
but upon the death of their father. If a
son happens to die before his father, theDayanand Saraswati
son’s heirs (including his wife and
daughters) become inheritors, not in
their own right, but as representatives of
the deceased heir. Under the Dayabhaga,
widows and daughters can thus have a
share in family property, and they are
allowed to act as agents in their own
right. In theory this arrangement seems
far more advantageous to women, but
in fact it had some gruesome conse-
quences. When the British first settled
in Bengal in the late eighteenth centu-
ry, they were horrified by the preva-
lence of sati, the rite in which a widow
would be burned on her husband’s
funeral pyre. It seems that sati was not
nearly so common in many other parts
of India, and one theory is that this rite
was the family’s way to ensure that
their daughter-in-law—who was an
outsider to the family—would not be
able to gain control over any of their
ancestral property.
Dayanand Saraswati
(1824–1883) Nineteenth-century reformist
ascetic and founder of the Arya Samaj, a
reformist Hindu organization. The late
nineteenth century was an era of
sweeping social, economic, and
religious change in northern India, and
the Arya Samaj was an authentically
Hindu response to these forces.
Dayanand’s mission for the Arya Samaj
was to reform and revitalize Hinduism
by purging it of the “false practices” that
had gradually crept in. Swami
Dayanand’s fundamental assumption
was that ultimate religious authority lay
only in the ancient scriptures called the
Vedas, and that any contemporary
religious practices not found in the
Vedas were mistaken, odious, and
deserved to be abandoned. This stance
allowed him to attack many of the
“social evils” plaguing nineteenth-
century Hinduism, such as child
marriages, sati (the rite in which a
widow would be burned on her
husband’s funeral pyre), “idolatrous”
image worship, untouchability, a ban
on widow remarriage, and the unequal
status of women. In claiming that such
practices were “corrupt,” Dayanand had
found not only a viable strategy for
reform, but a way to undercut the claims
of Christian missionaries, who pointed
to such evils as evidence that Hindu reli-
gion was inferior to Christianity.
Unlike its predecessor, the Brahmo
Samaj, which was heavily influenced by
Christianity, the Arya Samaj was a Hindu
response drawing from purely Hindu
sources. Dayanand belonged to the first
generation of Hindus aiming to reassert
the greatness of Hinduism as opposed
to the Christian missionary challenge,
and much of his writing is militantly
anti-Christian. One sign of his crusading
spirit is his support for the ceremony of
purification (shuddhi), through which
Hindus who had become members of
other religious communities were received
back into the Hindu community.
Although the Arya Samaj claimed that
they were simply getting back to the
Veda, the ultimate aim was not to
reclaim that long-gone era, but to
develop a form of Hindu religious life
more compatible with “modern” times.
Thus, even though Dayanand was “tra-
ditionalist” in his emphasis on the
Vedas, he was radical in insisting that
the Vedas should be accessible to all
people, including groups such as
women and the shudras, or the lowest
social group, both of whom had tradi-
tionally been forbidden to read or even
hear it. During his ministry Dayanand
spoke throughout India, attacking any
and all religions not rooted in the Vedas,
including contemporary Hinduism. His
eloquence, charisma, and commitment
brought him considerable success, but
also many enemies, and he was eventu-
ally assassinated by poisoning. For fur-
ther information see Dayanand

Day of Brahma
Day of Brahma
The Day of Brahma, or kalpa, is the
largest generally accepted measure of
time in Indian cosmology, and spans
[[432]]
 million years. This time period is the
ultimate limit for the existence of the
created world, although within it the
universe undergoes periodic renewals.
At the conclusion of the Day of Brahma
comes the universal dissolution (pralaya),
in which the created universe is com-
pletely destroyed and reabsorbed into
Vishnu. The Day of Brahma is followed
by a night of equal length, during
which the only living thing is the god
Vishnu, who sleeps on the back of his
serpent couch, Shesha, and floats on
the surface of the cosmic ocean. When
the Night of Brahma is ended, a lotus
sprouts forth from Vishnu’s navel,
which opens to reveal the god Brahma,
and with the new Day of Brahma the
universe begins anew.
The Day of Brahma can be divided
into smaller units based on two different
methods. One of these divides the Day
of Brahma into fourteen equal ages, in
which each age is identified by the par-
ticular divine sovereign (Manu) who
rules during that age. Another divides
the Day of Brahma into one thousand
mahayugas, each of which has four con-
stituent yugas (units of cosmic time),
each shorter than the last. See also
Cosmic Time.
Deathbed Rites
General term for the rites done for a
dying person. These rites have a twofold
purpose: to purify the person’s body,
and, more importantly, to calm the
mind. The first is generally done by
applying holy substances, such as
Ganges water or a Tulsi leaf. In some
cases, the dying person will also hold the
tail of a cow, since according to popular
mythology this will enable the person to
cross the Vaitarani River, the river lead-
ing to the afterlife. The emphasis on
calming the dying person’s mind comes
from the belief that one’s dying thoughts
have enormous karmic ramifications for

future lives. Ideally, the dying person
should be calm and composed, since
any sort of fear or agitation is believed to
have negative consequences. One
method to help promote such calmness
is to read passages from religious texts,
whether to remind the hearer of the
body’s impermanence, or to have the
last thing one hears be the name of God.
At the moment of death the dying per-
son is often placed on the earth—per-
haps so that the earth can absorb the
impurity (ashaucha) of the corpse, or
perhaps as a symbol that whatever a
person’s status in life, all human beings
eventually share the same fate. After
death the rites associated with crema-
tion begin, which are the next set of rites
in the series known as the antyeshthi
samskara (“last rites”).

Deccan
A region of the Indian subcontinent. In
its broadest usage, this word can refer to
all of India south of the Vindhya
Mountains, the range that divides
northern and southern India. More
specifically, this term denotes the dry
and hilly plateau in the northern and
eastern parts of the region south of the
Vindhyas, bounded on the east and west
by the highlands known as the Eastern
and Western Ghats. In Hindu cultural
terms, the Deccan is a transitional cul-
tural area between the northern Indian
plain and the deep south.
Deer
In Hindu iconography, an animal
strongly associated with the god Shiva,
particularly in his form as Pashupati,
the “Lord of Beasts.” In many of the four-
armed images of Shiva, one of the upper
arms will have the figure of the deer
emerging from it, symbolizing his con-
trol over all life. In Hindu bhakti (devo-
tional) poetry, the musk deer is often
used as a symbol for an ignorant,Demons
unenlightened person. According to this
image, just as the deer does not recog-
nize that the heady scent of musk comes
from its own body, but rushes all over
the forest in search of it, so are human
beings ignorant of God inside and ever
close to them, but looking outside them-
selves in search of the divine.
Dehu
Town in the Pune district of Maharashtra
state, sixty-five miles east and south of
Bombay. It is most famous as the
home of the poet-saint Tukaram, one
of most important figures in the
Varkari Panth. The Varkaris are a reli-
gious community centered around the
worship of the Hindu god Vithoba, at
his temple at Pandharpur in modern
Maharashtra. Varkari religious practice
centers primarily around two annual
pilgrimages in which all the partici-
pants arrive in Pandharpur on the
same day. Tukaram still symbolically
travels to Pandharpur twice each year;
a palanquin (palkhi) bearing his san-
dals is at the head of the procession
bearing his name.
Deities
This is a word with various possible
meanings in different contexts. On one
hand, it can refer to the gods (devas).
These are beings who live in one of the
heavenly realms, by virtue of their past
good karma (actions), but who are still
subject to the law of karma and who
therefore must someday be reborn in a
lower state. This word can also refer to
the Supreme Reality, which can best be
designated as “God,” although the
Hindu imagination has given it various
names: Brahman, the Goddess, Vishnu,
Shiva, Ganesh, and a host of other
deities in the pantheon, including vil-
lage deities.
Demons
another. The most prominent conflict is
between the suras (“gods”) and another
class of divine beings called asuras
(“not-gods”). Aside from the asuras,
there are other powerful beings such as
rakshasas, pisacas, and vetalas, which
have greater or lesser malevolence
toward the gods and human beings. The
English word most often used to denote
all these divine adversaries is the word
“demon.” Although this is a convenient
label and avoids the need for unfamiliar
Sanskrit terminology, it also carries
inappropriate and misleading associa-
tions. The word “demon” carries conno-
tations of absolute and radical evil, as
well as willful opposition to a single
supreme divinity. Neither assumption is
appropriate in the Hindu mythic uni-
verse, which is polytheistic, or believing
in more than one god. This polytheistic
universe has a host of divine beings,
whose individual interests may well
conflict with those of the gods, and
whose mutual opposition may spill over
into open war. This does not make such
opponents, or “demons,” inherently evil,
but rather the opponents of the Hindu
gods, from whose perspective Hindu
mythology is clearly recounted. These
“demons” may also be ill-disposed
toward humans, but they are not neces-
sarily or inherently so. Perhaps the
clearest recognition of their status is that
despite their occasional opposition to
the gods, they are never completely
destroyed, but simply demoted to a
more appropriate status. For example,
when the “demon” Hiranyakashipu is
destroyed by Vishnu’s Man-Lion avatar,
he is succeeded by his son Prahlada. In
the same way, after the god Rama kills
Ravana, the “demon” king of Lanka,
Rama appoints as successor Ravana’s
brother Vibhishana. Asuras and other
supernormal beings thus have a legiti-
mate place in the Hindu mythic world,
and as long as they do not overreach
themselves and throw the world into
imbalance, they are allowed to remain.
The Hindu mythic universe has various
classes of supernatural beings, some of
which are perpetually at odds with one
[[181]]
Deogarh
Deogarh
Small town in the extreme southern part
of the state of Uttar Pradesh, seventy
miles south of the city Jhansi, in a part of
Uttar Pradesh almost completely
enclosed by the state of Madhya
Pradesh. It is famous as the site for one
of the few surviving temples from the
Gupta dynasty, a fifth-century temple
dedicated to Vishnu as the Dashavatar
(“Ten Incarnations”). The temple itself is
a masonry cube about twenty feet on
each side, topped by a ruined tower that
would have originally been about forty
feet high. In its modest size and square
construction, this temple shows little
resemblance to the Hindu temples of a
later age. However, it prefigures later
architecture in its magnificent carvings:
in the images carved in panels on the
side walls, around the temple’s single
door, and on friezes at the top of the
walls. The portrayal of the divine figures
in these carvings is identical to that
done centuries later, which indicates
that the images used to represent these
deities were already fixed at the time the
temple was built.
Deoghar
(“God’s home”) Sacred site (tirtha) in
the southeastern corner of the modern
state of Bihar, about 130 miles south-
east of the city of Patna. Deoghar is
famous throughout India as the site for a
temple to the god Shiva, in his form as
Vaidyanath, the “Lord of Physicians.”
Vaidyanath is one of the twelve jyotir-
lingas, a group of sacred sites deemed
especially holy to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is believed to be uniquely present.
Deoghar hosts an enormous religious
gathering on the festival of Shivaratri
(February—March) and during the
lunar month of Shravan (July—August),
both of which are times deemed partic-
ularly sacred to Shiva. On both occa-
sions, pilgrims draw water from the
Ganges at Sultanganj, more than sixty
miles from Deoghar, and then walk
to Deoghar to present the water as
an offering to Shiva. This particular
[[182]]

observance combines devotion to God
with the willingness to suffer hardship; it
is often performed to fulfill a vow made
when asking for some divine favor. As in
many Hindu holy places, pilgrim traffic
peaks at Deoghar at certain festival
times and at other times of the year
drops off to almost nothing.
Deoras, Balasaheb
(1915–1996) Third sarsanghchalak
(“Supreme Leader”) of the Rashtriya
Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a conserva-
tive Hindu organization whose express
purpose is to provide the leadership
cadre for a revitalized Hindu India. The
RSS is a highly autocratic organization
that lays great stress on obedience to
authority, thus the sarsanghchalak
wields virtually complete power over it.
During Deoras’s tenure from 1973 to
[[1994]]
, he took a much more activist
stance than his predecessor, M.S.
Golwalkar, particularly in promoting
the growth of the RSS’s affiliate organiza-
tions, in giving the RSS an orientation to
social service, and in actively seeking to
recruit members and establish shakhas
(branches) in all parts of the country. For
further information see Walter K.
Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, The
Brotherhood in Saffron, 1987; Tapan
Basu et al., Khaki Shorts and Saffron
Flags, 1993; and Christophe Jaffrelot,
The Hindu Nationalist Movement in
India, 1996.
Deshastha
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
had a monopoly. This sort of differentia-
tion applied even to brahmins, whose
role has been to serve as priests, schol-
ars, and teachers. The Deshastha brah-
min jati is a subset of the Maharashtri
brahmins, who were themselves one of
the five southern brahmin communitiesDevadasi
(Pancha Dravida). The core region for
the Deshastha brahmins is in the
Deccan region in Maharashtra, whereas
the other major subcommunity, the
Chitpavan or Konkanastha, is found on
the coast.
Deshnok
Small village in the Bikaner district in
the state of Rajasthan, roughly twenty
miles south of the city of Bikaner.
Deshnok is famous for the temple to the
goddess Karni Mata, in which thou-
sands of rats have been given sacred sta-
tus and are treated as deities, in the
belief that they are Karni Mata’s sons.
Deul
(probably a form of deva , “deity”) In
the temple architecture of the state of
Orissa, this is the name for the bee-
hive-shaped tower under which the
image of the temple’s primary deity
resides. Unlike the architecture in
other parts of northern India, in which
a series of towers (shikharas) gradually
led up to the tallest tower, Orissan tem-
ples tend to have a fairly long and low
entrance porch (jagamohans) and an
extremely high deul, with this differ-
ence in visual forms accentuating the
contrast between the two.
Deva
The word deva literally means “shining
one,” although the most common (and
often most appropriate) translation is
“god.” This word is an epithet for any
superhuman being, although it can also
be used figuratively for any person of
high status, such as a king or a brahmin
(priest). The notion of “gods” in
Hinduism must be understood in
light of the generally assumed context
of reincarnation (samsara), which
assumes that a person can be reborn in
many different realms of reality. Some of
these are realms of punishment where
people atone for the effects of their bad
karma, while others are realms of plea-
sure (the heavens) where people enjoy
the results of their good karma. The
devas are the inhabitants of these heav-
ens, and are thus “gods,” since gods, by
definition, live in heaven.
Yet all these gods are still subject to
the vicissitudes of reincarnation—even
Indra, the ruler of heaven. Birth in
heaven is based on one’s good karma,
which is inevitably diminished by enjoy-
ing the rewards of life in heaven, just as
a savings account is depleted by contin-
uing withdrawals. When their good
karma has been exhausted, even the
gods are subject to rebirth in other
realms. So even though these gods are
superhuman, they are still subject to the
law of reincarnation. There is thus a
qualitative difference between these
gods (the devas) and the so-called Great
gods, such as Vishnu, Shiva, and the
Goddess. These latter deities are seen by
their devotees (bhakta) as totally out-
side the realm of space, time, and the
causes and effects of karma, and thus
correspond more directly to the Judeo-
Christian notion of “God,” as the ulti-
mate power in the universe.
Devadasi
(“[female] servant of the lord”) Name for
a class of women kept in temples as
singers and dancers in the service of the
temple’s presiding deity, to whom they
were usually considered to be “married.”
Their special status prevented them
from marrying human husbands,
although in many cases they would form
long-term liaisons with prominent local
men. Any daughters born from such
liaisons would in turn be dedicated to
the temple, while sons would be trained
as musicians. In many cases, devadasis
had unusual legal rights, such as the
ability to own, manage, and transfer
property, which for most women were
vested only in their husbands. At best,
these devadasis were literate and cul-
tured women, whose talents brought
them considerable status, while at worst
(as was often the case in the nineteenth
century) they were prostitutes whose
services enriched the temple. The latter
[[183]]
Devaki
situation prompted the British to for-
mally ban this practice, despite their
general reluctance to interfere in Hindu
religious affairs.
Devaki
In Hindu mythology, the god Krishna’s
mother. Krishna is considered the
eighth avatar (incarnation) of the god
Vishnu, and like all of the avatars, he
comes down to earth to restore the cos-
mic balance by destroying the forces of
evil that are upsetting it. Devaki is the
niece of King Kamsa, the evil king of
Mathura, and on the day she is married
a heavenly voice proclaims that her
eighth child will kill Kamsa. Kamsa seeks
to destroy this prophecy by imprisoning
Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva,
killing each of their children as they are
born. Devaki’s seventh child is magically
transferred to the womb of her co-wife,
Rohini, and is born as Balarama.
At the birth of the eighth child,
Krishna, the locked gates magically
open, and a deep sleep falls over all the
guards, allowing Vasudeva to spirit the
infant child to his foster parents, Nanda
and Yashoda.
Devanagari
Name for the most common northern
Indian script, in which the sacred
Sanskrit, modern Hindi, and Marathi
languages are commonly written to this
day. It is a descendant of the ancient
Brahmi script, and from it developed
the scripts used for the modern Bengali,
Gujarati, Oriya, and Punjabi languages.
Its most characteristic feature is that the
top element of most letters is a horizon-
tal line, which, when the letters are writ-
ten together, causes the letters to
“hang,” like laundry from a clothesline.
Its name literally means “[script of the]
city of the gods,” and according to one
theory, it was given this name because it
was developed in Benares, one of the
holiest cities in India.
[[184]]

Devapratishtha
(“establishing the deity”) Rite by which
the image of a deity is established in a
temple and consecrated for worship.
The image itself must be constructed
according to carefully defined sculptural
and artistic canons that date back to the
early centuries of the common era, as
the sculptures at the Deogarh temple
clearly show. The image, temple site,
and the performers must be purified
before the rite begins, and this purity
must be maintained throughout the
entire rite—which can last for days—to
ensure that the image remains pure. All
parts in the transmission and physical
installation of the image are carefully
done, but the climactic rite is the
pranapratishtha, in which the image is
infused with the breath of life and
becomes the seat for the deity. After this
point, the image is considered to be rit-
ually “alive,” and must receive regular
worship and ministrations.
Devaprayag
(“divine confluence”) Sacred town
(tirtha) in the northern part of the state
of Uttar Pradesh, in the Himalaya
Mountains about sixty miles up the
Ganges from the city of Haridwar.
Devaprayag is sacred because it is at the
confluence of the Bhagirathi and
Alakananda rivers, the largest Himalayan
tributaries of the Ganges. Devaprayag is
the final such river confluence in the
Himalayas, and it is at this confluence
that the Ganges is definitively formed as
one indivisible sacred stream.
Devar
In the northern Indian joint family, the
term designating a husband’s younger
brother. The traditional Indian joint
family is headed by a husband and wife.
The couple’s sons, the sons’ wives, and
unmarried daughters live with them.
The married daughters live with their
husbands’ joint families. The joint family
is not just a group of people living
together. The good of the family is givenDevasena
higher value than any individual’s
desires. Traditional Indian society was
highly status-conscious, a trait reflected
not only in the traditional hierarchical
conception of society, but also in similar
conceptions within the family. Based on
these assumptions, there are different
words for all sorts of relationships in the
Indian family. These words are based
partly on a person’s age in relation to the
speaker, whether he is related by blood
or by marriage, and whether blood rela-
tives come from the mother’s or the
father’s side of the family. Since a
woman’s devar is younger than her hus-
band, he is considered a person of less
exalted status, and thus someone with
whom she may have a more familiar
“joking relationship.”
Devara Dasimayya
Tenth-century devotee (bhakta) of
Shiva, who was much admired by
Basavanna and the other Lingayat lead-
ers. According to tradition Dasimayya
earned his living as a weaver, but spent
most of his energies propagating the
worship of Shiva. He encountered
particular opposition from the Jains
and the Vaishnavas, about which there
are many miraculous tales, but he
also served as a missionary to jungle
tribes. For further information see
A. K. Ramanujan (trans.), Speaking of
Siva, 1973.
Devaram
Name for the collected hymns of the
poet-saints Appar, Sambandar, and
Sundaramurtti. These were the most
important of the Nayanars, a group of
sixty-three Shaiva poet-saints who lived
in southern India between the seventh
and ninth centuries. Along with their
Vaishnava counterparts, the Alvars, the
Nayanars spearheaded the revitalization
of Hindu religion versus the Buddhists
and the Jains. Both the Nayanars and the
Alvars stressed passionate devotion
(bhakti) to a personal god—Shiva for
the Nayanars, Vishnu for the Alvars—
The town of Devaprayag. It is considered sacred
because it lies at the confluence of the Bhagirathi
and Alakananda Rivers, the two largest tributaries
of the Ganges in the Himalayas.
and conveyed this devotion through
hymns sung in the Tamil language.
Appar and Sambandar were the first of
the Nayanars, and Sundaramurtti was
the last. Although the hymns in the
Devaram are devotional, they form the
basis for the philosophical school
known as Shaiva Siddhanta, and are
thus considered the holiest of the Tamil
Shaivite texts. The hymns are also
marked by opposition and hostility
to non-Hindu traditions, particularly
the Jains, with whom the Nayanars
were apparently contesting for influence
and patronage.
Devasena
In southern Indian mythological tradi-
tion, Devasena is the wife of the god
Skanda, in his southern Indian form as
Murugan. Following the pan-Indian
custom
of
arranged marriage,
Devasena is given in marriage to Skanda
by Indra (king of the gods) and the other
[[185]]
Devayajna
Hindu gods. After his marriage,
Skanda contracts a “love-marriage”
with the tribal girl Valli. Skanda’s two
wives thus symbolize both sides of his
identity—Valli bears witness to his
connection with the land, and his ulti-
mate roots as a tribal deity, while
Devasena shows his assimilation into
the larger Hindu pantheon.
Devayajna
(“sacrifice to the gods”) One of the
Five Great Sacrifices (panchamahaya-
jna) that is prescribed in the texts on
religious duty (dharma literature).
These Five Great Sacrifices are pre-
scribed daily religious observances for
a “twice-born” householder, that is, a
householder who has been born into
one of the three twice-born groups in
Indian society—brahmin, kshatriya,
or vaishya—and who has received the
adolescent religious initiation known
as the “second birth.” Each of the five
sacrifices (yajna) is directed toward a
different class of beings—from the
Absolute Reality down to animals—
and is satisfied by different actions.
The devayajna is directed toward the
gods and is satisfied by homa, the
offerings of clarified butter into the
sacred fire. In the time since these
texts were composed, Hindu life has
undergone significant changes, and
since most Hindu homes no longer
maintain a sacred fire, this particular
rite has been largely omitted.
Devimahatmya
(“Greatness of the Goddess”) The
earliest and most important mythic
source for the cult of the Goddess as
the supreme divine power. The
Devimahatmya is itself a section of a
larger Sanskrit (sacred language) text,
the Markandeya Purana, and is gener-
ally accepted to have been composed in
the Narmada River region in the fifth or
sixth century. The Devimahatmya is
most notable for its assertion that God is
female. This notion has no clear source
[[186]]

in the earlier Hindu tradition, in which
female deities exist but are insignificant.
This conviction must have existed at
some level, because it emerges fully
developed in the Devimahatmya, and
the idea must have spent some time
developing before its full fruition in
this text.
The Devimahatmya itself is a text of
[[700]]
 verses, hence its other common
name, the Durgasaptashati (“700 verses
to Durga”). The text begins with a frame
story, in which a king and a merchant,
each beset by worldly trials, seek refuge
in the peace of the forest. There they
meet a sage, who listens to each of their
stories, and explains that all of their
troubles are due to Mahamaya (an epi-
thet of the Goddess). This is an epithet
for the Goddess as the wielder of illu-
sion, who is the sole power behind the
universe. When pressed for further
details, the sage tells three mythic sto-
ries, each describing the salvific activity
of the Goddess. These three tales form
the bulk of the text and the basis for the
worship of the Goddess.
The first story retells the myth of the
demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who are
born from the god Vishnu’s earwax dur-
ing the period of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). As the creation of the world
begins anew, a lotus sprouts from
Vishnu’s navel. It opens to reveal the cre-
ator-god Brahma, who is immediately
menaced by Madhu and Kaitabha. The
story of these two demons also appears
in the mythology connected with
Vishnu, but there are significant differ-
ences in this version. In all versions of
the myth, Brahma appeals for help, and
Vishnu eventually slays the demons. But
in the Devimahatmya, Brahma’s hymn
of praise is to the Goddess, who in her
form as Yoganidra (“sleep of yoga”) has
lulled Vishnu into a cosmic stupor,
rendering him unable to come to
Brahma’s aid. Pleased by Brahma’s
praise, the Goddess withdraws her
influence over Vishnu, he awakens and
slays the demons.
The second story centers around the
buffalo-demon Mahishasura, who is soDevshayani Ekadashi
powerful that none of the gods can con-
quer him. One day, when the gods are
recounting their defeats at the demon’s
hands, each of the gods begin to give off
a great radiance. This radiance collects
into a single glowing mass, and from it
the figure of the Goddess emerges. This
myth portrays the Goddess as the con-
centrated essence of all the gods, and
thus superior to any one of them. This
motif is accentuated by each of the gods
giving her a copy of their weapons, so
that symbolically she wields all of their
divine powers. The Goddess takes up
arms against Mahishasura and his army,
and after a terrifying battle, slays him.
The third story also portrays the
Goddess as a warrior-queen. In this
episode, she fights and destroys the
demon armies of Shumbha and
Nishumbha, along with their minions
Chanda, Munda, and Raktabija. This
story is notable for the first appearance of
the fierce goddess Kali, who springs forth
from the forehead of the Goddess as her
anger personified. Kali helps the Goddess
to defeat the demon armies by stuffing
them into her mouth and consuming
them. Kali is also instrumental in destroy-
ing the demon Raktabija, who has been
granted the wish that whenever a drop of
his blood falls to the ground, it will be
transformed into another full-sized copy
of himself. This makes him impossible to
kill by conventional means. Kali is able to
thwart this special power by drinking
Raktabija’s blood before it reaches the
ground. As with the second book, this
story has extended descriptions of
battlefield carnage.
All of these stories describe the
Goddess as the supreme divine power,
far superior to the male gods in the pan-
theon. The frame story ends with an
extended hymn of praise to the
Goddess, and descriptions of the bene-
fits gained from her worship. Both the
king and the merchant begin to wor-
ship her, and after three years both are
granted their desires. The king asks for a
larger and unconquerable kingdom,
alluding to the Goddess’s power to
bestow worldly wishes. The merchant,
however, requests final liberation, show-
ing his awareness of her power over illu-
sion, and the ultimate spiritual goal. For
further information see Thomas B.
Coburn, Devi Mahatmya, 1984.
Devotee
See bhakta.
Devotthayan Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Kartik (October–
November). This is celebrated as the day
on which the god Vishnu awakens from
his four-month slumber, having fallen
asleep on Devshayani Ekadashi
(“eleventh day festival”) in Ashadh
(June–July). When Vishnu has arisen
from sleep, the ritually dangerous
chaturmas (“four-month”) period is
over, and auspicious life-cycle rites such
as weddings and the sacred thread cere-
mony (“adolescent initiation”) may be
performed again.
Devshayani Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the bright (waxing) half of
the lunar month of Ashadh (June-July).
This is celebrated as the day on which
the god Vishnu falls asleep on his ser-
pent couch Shesha, and remains sleep-
ing for four lunar months, waking up on
Devotthayan Ekadashi. This four-
month period (chaturmas) is consid-
ered unlucky and ritually dangerous,
since it is a period when the god is con-
sidered to be insensible. Weddings are
generally not performed during this
period, nor is any other life-cycle rite
that can be postponed. This festival
coincides with the advent of the rainy
season, and the ambivalence connected
with the rains can be seen here. On one
hand, the rains are essential to the
crops, and thus foster life and fertility.
On the other hand, the rains also bring
all too real dangers from snakes, scorpi-
ons, and gastrointestinal infections.
[[187]]
Dhanga
Dhanga
(d. 1003) A monarch in the Chandella
dynasty, most famous for committing
religious suicide by drowning himself
at Allahabad, at the confluence of the
Ganges and Yamuna rivers. The
inscription that records this event
mentions that Dhanga did this at the
end of his life—when he had lived
more than one hundred years—while
meditating on the god Rudra, a form of
Shiva, and further notes that by com-
mitting suicide Dhanga gained final
liberation of the soul (moksha). This
description clearly shows that religious
suicide was a highly structured reli-
gious act, the object of which was to
help the performer die in a calm and
composed state of mind, ideally with
one’s last thoughts focused on a deity.
A crucial element in this ritual was the
statement of purpose (samkalpa), in
which the performer would state the
benefit desired from his performance.
Dhanga’s statement of purpose is
almost certainly the basis for his asser-
tion that he attained final liberation,
since this claim is not verifiable in any
other way.
Dhangar
The model for traditional Indian society
was a collection of endogamous sub-
groups known as jatis (“birth”). These
jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
had a monopoly. In traditional central
Indian society, the Dhangars were a
Hindu jati whose hereditary occupation
was herding sheep and goats. They
are particularly associated with the state
of Maharashtra.
Dhanus
[[188]]

(“bow”) In Hindu iconography, the bow
is a weapon associated with several
Hindu deities. It has strong mythic asso-
ciations with the god Shiva, who in one
of his mythic exploits destroys the Three
Cities (tripura) with a single arrow. It is
also commonly associated with the god
Rama, whose unfailing arrows slay
Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka.
Aside from these, it is also one of the
weapons commonly carried by power-
ful forms of the Goddess, such as
Durga. The reason for this can be
found in her charter myth in the
Devimahatmya, in which the Goddess
is formed from the collected radiance
of all the gods and receives duplicates
of all their weapons.
Dhanvantari
In Hindu mythology, Dhanvantari is
the physician of the gods and is cred-
ited as the founder of ayurveda, a tra-
ditional system of Indian medicine.
Dhanvantari is born when the gods
and demons (supernatural beings)
churn the Ocean of Milk to produce
the nectar of immortality. In the
course of their churning, many pre-
cious things are produced, including
the goddess Lakshmi, the wishing-cow
Kamadhenu, and the Kaustubha jewel.
As the churning reaches its climax,
Dhanvantari himself emerges from the
ocean bearing the pot of amrta, the
nectar of immortality that has been
the ultimate product of the whole
endeavor. See also Tortoise avatar.
Dharamshala
(“abode of dharma”) A no-frills rest
house for pilgrims. Dharamshalas
were often built by pious donors (this
was endowed as a religious act), to
provide pilgrims not only with a basic
place to stay during their pilgrimage,
but also a place with a wholesome
religious atmosphere. The facilities at
a dharamshala are generally quite
basic, and well below the standard set
by a hotel—in many cases it is a nearly
bare room in which the pilgrims cook,
eat, and sleep, often on their own bed-
ding. Until well into the twentieth
century, pilgrims were under no oblig-
ation to pay anything for staying,
although on departing they were
expected to leave a donation accord-
ing to their means and inclination. InDharma
most cases dharamshalas now have set
rates for lodging, but they are always
cheaper than hotels since the ameni-
ties tend to be less. There is also a
marked difference in their general
atmosphere and clientele. Most
dharamshalas still strive to promote
and maintain a wholesome religious
atmosphere: by having a temple in the
building; by holding worship in the
morning, evening, and on special occa-
sions; and by sponsoring scriptural
readings, lectures, and other religious
activities. These activities help to create
a religious community, and those who
are seeking this during their journey
will strive to stay in such places.
Dharana
(“concentration”) In the ashtanga yoga
(system of religious discipline) first cod-
ified by the philosopher Patanjali, dha-
rana is the sixth of the eight elements of
yoga practice. Along with dhyana and
samadhi, dharana is one of the three
parts known as the “inner discipline”
(samyama), the culmination of yogic
training. Dharana is described as stead-
fastness of mind. It is the ability to focus
on any object, whether a part of the
body or an external object, and to keep
the mind steadily focused there. This is
training for one’s mind and one’s aware-
ness and is an essential prerequisite for
focused meditation.
Dharma
One of the four purusharthas, or aims
of life, the others being artha (wealth,
power, and prosperity), kama (desire),
and moksha (liberation). The concept of
dharma is so fundamental to Hindu
culture that it cannot be adequately
translated by any single English word—
possible translations are “religious law,”
“religious duty,” “duty,” “religion,” “law,”
or “social order.” The root meaning for
the word dharma comes from a verb
meaning “to support” or “to uphold.”
Dharma is thus that which supports or
upholds society, which shows why all
Kama, the god of desire. He is one of many gods
who carry a dhanus, or bow. The five different
arrows in Kama’s arsenal each produce a different
emotion in the people they strike.
the aforementioned translations could
make sense in context. Dharma pro-
vides the overall regulatory framework
for life in the world and gives a sense of
ultimate purpose to keep one’s life in
balance. Although Hindu culture sanc-
tions the pursuit of both power (artha)
and pleasure (kama), it is always
assumed that both of these will be regu-
lated by an underlying commitment to
dharma, to keep one’s life integrated and
balanced.
The dharma literature, primarily the
Dharma Sutras (aphorisms on religious
duty) and Dharma Shastras (treatises
on religious duty), was largely con-
cerned with laying down guidelines for
an organized and orderly society, and
these guidelines take into account many
possible factors. Although these texts
spoke of an eternal (sanatana) dharma,
and of certain common duties (sadha-
rana dharma) incumbent on all human
beings, the most important thing for any
person was one’s personal dharma
(svadharma). One’s svadharma provided
a well-defined social status and role,
based on one’s social status (varna),
stage of life (ashrama), and gender (the
[[189]]
Dharma
particular dharma for women was strid-
harma). These texts were almost cer-
tainly composed by brahmin (priests)
men, and reveal everything about how
these men thought things should be, but
are far less reliable with regard to actual
social practices. The men who com-
posed this literature presupposed an
unequal society, in which birth into
high or low status groups was deter-
mined by the nature of one’s karma
(actions), whether good, bad, or mixed.
Although various groups had unequal
status, they were all necessary for soci-
ety to function harmoniously, and true
virtue lay in meticulously fulfilling one’s
prescribed social role. Doing so faithfully
was not only a source of religious merit,
but if one did one’s obligations dispas-
sionately from a sense of duty, it was
also described as one of the three paths
for liberation of the soul, the path of
Action (karmamarga). For further infor-
mation see Pandurang Vaman Kane
(trans.), A History of Dharmasastra,
[[1968]]

Life: Karma and Dharma,” in T. N.
Madan (ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Dharma
(2) A deity, seen as the personification of
dharma as religious duty. In the
Mahabharata, the latter of the two great
Hindu epics, the five Pandava brothers,
who are the epic’s protagonists, all have
divine fathers, and the eldest brother
Yudhishthira is the son of Dharma.
Yudhishthira and his brothers belong
to a kingly (kshatriya) family, but
Yudhishthira himself shows great con-
cern for truth, righteousness, and com-
passion. None of these are proverbial
kshatriya qualities, which tend to stress
courage and martial valor, and
Yudhishthira’s qualities are usually
explained by invoking the influence of
his divine father. A different sort of
Dharma cult arose in medieval Bengal,
from the commingling of Buddhist,
Muslim, and Hindu ideas. In this cult
Dharma was worshiped as the formless
single supreme Lord (probably reflecting
[[190]]

the influence of Islam), but the worship
of Dharma contained many similarities
with Bengali Hindu rituals. For further
information see Shashibhushan B.
Dasgupta, Obscure Religious Cults, 1962.
Dharma Literature
Many texts are explicitly or implicitly
concerned with the question of dharma,
or religious duty. These begin with the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu sacred texts,
which are believed to articulate the eter-
nal (sanatana) dharma. The first major
texts explicitly devoted to dharma are
the Dharma Sutras, texts written in an
aphoristic (sutra) style between the sev-
enth and second centuries B.C.E. At least
in theory, the Dharma Sutras were all
connected with particular schools of the
Veda, and were thus primarily intended
as a manual for behavior for members of
that school alone. The Dharma Sutras
were followed by the Dharma Shastras,
in which the material in the Dharma
Sutras was expanded and put into verse;
these latter texts included instructions
for all members of society and were thus
intended to be “legal” in their import.
Among the earliest was the Manava
Dharma Shastra (Manu Smrti), which
was composed around the turn of the
common era. The process of rethinking
and expanding this legal tradition
through commentary has continued
until present times, although the most
significant works were completed by the
sixteenth century.
Dharmaputra
(“son of Dharma”) One of the epithets
of Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five
Pandava brothers. The Pandavas are
the protagonists in the Mahabharata,
the later of the two great Hindu epics.
In the epic, Yudhishthira and his broth-
ers are the sons of various deities,
magically born when their mothers use
the power of a mantra (sacred sound).
Yudhishthira’s father is the god
Dharma, the guardian of righteous-
ness. His paternity is used to explainDharma Sutras
Yudhishthira’s concern with truth and
righteousness, which are defining
qualities in his character. These are
not usually considered to be kingly
(kshatriya) values, which stress courage
and martial valor.
Dharmaraja
(“King of Righteousness”) Colloquial
name for Yama, god of death and pre-
siding deity of the underworld. Yama is
responsible for judging and punishing
the dead, and this threat of punishment,
at least in popular belief, makes people
avoid committing evil. This name is also
one of the epithets of Yudhishthira, the
eldest of the five Pandava brothers,
since his father is the god Dharma, the
guardian of righteousness.
Dharmashastra
A general term to denote the study of
dharma (religious duty), whether refer-
ring specifically to the actual texts
(Dharma Shastras), or the treatises on
religious duty or more generally to the
extensive commentary-like literature on
these texts. Although the Dharma
Shastras are generally believed to have
been written between the second
century B.C.E. and the early centuries of
the common era, this literature contin-
ued to be written until modern times.
The literature detailed views on legal
matters, such as crime and punishment,
civil law, contracts, and rules of evi-
dence. It also concerned matters of
social order. The most extensive catalog
of all these sources is a five-volume set
by Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968.
Dharma Shastras
(“Treatises on Dharma”) In its most par-
ticular sense, this word refers to a partic-
ular set of Sanskrit texts. These texts
were explicitly written to give guidelines
for the organization of society, and for
correct human behavior in that society.
The Dharma Shastras were written soon
after the Dharma Sutras (aphorisms on
religious duty) and are clearly modeled
on them, but have several important dif-
ferences. With regard to form, the
Dharma Sutras are written in prose,
whereas the Dharma Shastras are writ-
ten in simple verse. The language of the
Dharma Shastras is close to classical
Sanskrit, and the writers were trying to
make their texts clear and easy to under-
stand. In their content, the Dharma
Shastras treat the same general subjects
as the Dharma Sutras, but they place
far more emphasis on working out
the practical details of a social life,
particularly the duties and functions of
the king.
The final difference is their connec-
tion with the earlier Vedic literature. The
Dharma Sutras were conceived as the
final element of a Kalpa Sutra (complete
handbook of religious practice), along
with the Shrauta Sutras (prescriptions
for Vedic rituals) and the Grhya Sutras
(prescriptions for domestic rites). Each
Kalpa Sutra was associated with one of
the Vedas (the oldest sacred Hindu
texts), and thus the “family property” of
the particular brahmins (priests) con-
nected with that Veda. A particular
Dharma Sutra was thus associated with
a particular group of brahmins, and was
primarily intended as a manual for their
behavior. In contrast, the Dharma
Shastras purported to lay down rules for
all members of society. They show little
concern for ritual matters, and no con-
nection with any particular Vedic
school, but rather profess to lay down
universal truths. In keeping with this
emphasis, the surviving Dharma
Shastras are all attributed to mythical
sages—Manu,
Yajnavalkya,
and
Narada—whereas the Dharma Sutras
are given human authorship. The
Dharma Shastras thus mark the study of
dharma (dharmashastra) as a discipline
distinct from the earlier Vedic literature,
and applied to society as a whole.
Dharma Sutras
(“aphorisms on dharma”) The earliest
texts specifically devoted to dharma—
[[191]]
Dharna
rules of conduct for various social
groups, moral duties, rights, and obliga-
tions. These were composed as collec-
tions of aphorisms, some so brief that
they virtually presuppose commentary,
and were written between the seventh
and second century B.C.E. According to
theory, the Dharma Sutras were the third
and final part of a Kalpa Sutra (com-
plete handbook of religious practice),
which would also contain prescriptions
for Vedic rituals (Shrauta Sutras) and
domestic rites (Grhya Sutras). Each
Kalpa Sutra was theoretically connected
with one of the four Vedas, the oldest
Hindu religious texts, and was thus the
“family property” of the brahmins
(priests) connected with that Veda. A
particular Dharma Sutra was associated
with a particular group of brahmins and
was primarily intended as a manual for
their behavior.
The real picture is far more complex,
since more than twenty collections of
Dharma Sutras have been identified,
although the most important are attrib-
uted to sages and writers Apastamba,
Gautama, Vasishtha, Baudhayana, and
the god Vishnu. These Dharma Sutras
were an attempt to provide an ordered
way of life by delineating each person’s
rights and duties depending on his or
her social status (varna) and stage of life
(ashrama). These texts were the basis for
the later Dharma Shastras (treatises on
religious duty), which expanded the
sutras, put them into verse, and were
intended to serve as an actual code of
law for the members of the community.
Dharna
Name for a rite intended to compel
another party to address one’s griev-
ances; the rite is usually adopted when
all other options have failed. The word
dharna comes from the Sanskrit (sacred
language) verb that means “to hold” or
“to maintain.” One element in the dharna
rite is just that—the persistent public
presence of the supplicant in proximity
to the people to whom he or she is
appealing. Thus, an aggrieved civil
[[192]]

servant in modern India may hold a
dharna near the Parliament building
in Delhi, and in some cases people
have camped there for months in an
effort to publicize their plight and
mobilize public opinion. In the same
way, people may hold a dharna at the
temple of a deity to seek guidance or
help; the most prominent example of
this is at the Tarakeshvar temple in the
state of West Bengal.
Aside from persistent presence,
dharna’s other common characteristic is
self-inflicted suffering, usually done
through fasting (upavasa) or other
forms of ascetic self-denial. Pilgrims to
Tarakeshvar refrain from eating or
drinking until the god Shiva grants them
a vision, although in practice the temple
priests often limit such exertions to
three days. On the political level,
Mohandas K. Gandhi perfected the “fast
unto death” as a tool to help attain his
political ends. One of the cultural
assumptions that helps make such self-
inflicted suffering persuasive is the
ancient Hindu belief that by voluntarily
enduring physical suffering (tapas) one
can generate spiritual and magical
power. The other working assumption
that makes the dharna effective comes
from the declaration at the rite’s begin-
ning. On the human level, dharnas are
usually undertaken to address very spe-
cific perceived injustices, which are
made public at the start. It is generally
believed that should the person per-
forming dharna die, then the person
against whom the dharna had been held
will be assessed the karmic demerit for
causing that person’s death. Such dhar-
nas are generally only undertaken when
one has no other alternative. Because of
this assumption, they remain a powerful
resource, even in contemporary times.
Dhatuvada
Hindu branch of the Indian tradition of
alchemy, which seeks to transform,
transmute, and perfect the body
through the use of various chemicals
with the ultimate goal of rendering theDhobi
Dhobis, or washermen, cleaning clothes by beating them on stone slabs.
body immortal. Just as both Hindus and
Buddhists appropriated the idea of yoga
(act of discipline), both traditions
also have alchemical schools. The
Dhatuvada school stressed seeking bod-
ily perfection solely through consuming
drugs and potions, particularly ones
compounded from mercury and
cinnabar. This is theoretically different
from the Buddhist Rasayana school,
since the latter is said to use such mate-
rial means only to prolong life until the
body can be transmuted through medi-
tation, ritual, and yoga. The conceptual
foundation for Hindu alchemy is its
analysis of the world as a series of bipo-
lar opposites, and the conviction that
unifying these opposing forces brings
spiritual progress and the end of rein-
carnation (samsara). The governing
metaphor for this combination of oppo-
sites is the union of sun and moon. In
keeping with this bipolar symbolism,
both the sun and the moon are connect-
ed to other opposing principles through
an elaborate series of associations. The
sun is identified with heat, drying
power, fire, the goddess Shakti, and
menstrual blood; the moon with coolness,
healing power, water, the god Shiva,
and semen. In alchemical practice, the
two essential chemical elements are mer-
cury and sulfur—the former identified
with Shiva’s semen, and the latter with
Shakti’s uterine blood. Through properly
mixing and consuming these elements,
the impure body is purified and refined,
eventually rendering it immortal.
Modern descriptions of this practice
invariably warn that it should only be car-
ried out under the direction of one’s guru
(spiritual teacher); otherwise these combi-
nations will be harmful. This warning is
not surprising, since by itself mercury is a
deadly poison. For further information
see Shashibhushan B. Dasgupta,
Obscure Religious Cults, 1962; and David
Gordon
White,
“Alchemy: Indian
Alchemy,” in Mircea Eliade (ed.),
Encyclopedia of Religion, 1993.
Dhenuka
In Hindu mythology, a fierce demon
(supernatural being) who appears in the
form of a cow (dhenu). Dhenuka is only
one of the demons slain by the god
Krishna—this time in concert with his
brother Balarama—during Krishna’s
childhood in the village of Brindavan. In
these episodes, Krishna dispatches the
most ferocious demons as if it were
child’s play, which in one sense it is.
Krishna’s presence in the world, and his
interaction with his devotees (bhakta),
is considered to be a lila (“play”), and
the ease with which he handles these
demons attests to this playful revelation
of his divine nature. For further consid-
eration of this theme, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975.
Dhobi
A washerman, traditionally one who has
cleaned clothes by getting them wet and
[[193]]
Dhrshtadyumna
then beating them on a stone slab. As
with all the occupations in traditional
India, this was a hereditary occupation-
al group (jati), although the names used
to designate them are different from
region to region. They were typically
believed to be of low status, since they
habitually handled clothes rendered
impure by sweat and other bodily fluids.
Dhrshtadyumna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Dhrshtadyumna is
the son of King Drupada and the brother
of Draupadi, King Drupada’s daughter.
Dhrshtadyumna and Draupadi are mag-
ically born by emerging from a sacrifi-
cial fire. Their father sponsors this rite of
sacrifice to give birth to a hero who will
kill Drona, who has taken away half of
Drupada’s kingdom after being insulted
by Drupada. Drona accepts the boy as a
pupil and teaches him the martial arts.
Even though a heavenly voice has
announced that the boy will eventually
kill him, he does this under the convic-
tion that fate cannot be avoided.
Dhrshtadyumna is instrumental in
arranging Draupadi’s marriage to the
five Pandava brothers, the epic’s protag-
onists, and he fights on their side during
the Mahabharata war. Dhrshtadyumna
fights fiercely in the war and eventually
kills Drona by cutting off his head, there-
by avenging his father’s defeat. Yet his
triumph is short-lived, for that very
night Dhrshtadyumna is killed by
Drona’s son Ashvatthama, who secretly
gains entry to the Pandava camp and
kicks Dhrshtadyumna to death.
Dhrtarashtra
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambika. Dhrtarashtra
and his stepbrother Pandu are the result
of a desperate attempt to preserve the
royal line of King Shantanu, after
Shantanu’s son Vichitravirya has died
without heirs. Upon Vichitravirya’s
death, his mother Satyavati calls upon
[[194]]

her oldest son, Vyasa, to sleep with
Ambika and her sister, Ambalika, in the
hope that the women will conceive.
According to tradition Vyasa is very ugly,
and each woman involuntarily reacts
when Vyasa appears in her bed. Ambika
covers her eyes, causing her son
Dhrtarashtra to be born blind, and
Ambalika turns pale, causing her son
Pandu to be born with an unnaturally
pale complexion. Despite his disability,
Dhrtarashtra assumes the throne after
Pandu’s abdication; the latter renounces
the world after being cursed by the sage
Kindama. Pandu’s two wives have five
sons, known as the Pandavas, and
Dhrtarashtra and his wife Gandhari
have one hundred sons, collectively
known as the Kauravas. The ultimate
source of conflict in the Mahabharata
stems from the conflict between these
two royal lines, each of which has a legit-
imate claim to rule.
Dhrtarashtra does little to forestall
this struggle. Although he is generally
portrayed as a good person, he is also
weak and unable to contain the ambi-
tions of his eldest son, Duryodhana.
Here Dhrtarashtra’s blindness is not
just literal, but also symbolic, as he
lacks the vision and clarity that would
have allowed him to recognize the
breakdown between these two fami-
lies and to therefore take steps to
avoid it. His disability not only keeps
him on the margin of daily life, but is
also a sign of his inability to influence
the course of events, whatever his
feelings about them. One of the few
times that he actually shows force is
when he offers boons to Draupadi
(daughter of King Drupada) after her
humiliation by Duryodhana and his
brother Duhshasana, through which
she regains freedom for herself and
her husbands.
Because of his blindness, Dhrtarashtra
does not actually fight in the Mahabharata
war, but receives regular reports from
his bard Sanjaya, who has the ability
to see events at a distance. After the
Kauravas are defeated, he goes with
Gandhari and several others to live inDhuni

seclusion in the forest. Six years later
he is killed in a forest fire.
Dhruva
(“fixed”) In Hindu mythology, a boy who
is a symbol for the unrelenting pursuit
of a goal. Dhruva is a king’s son, but for
some unknown reason his father favors
Dhruva’s half-brother over Dhruva.
Distressed by this insult, Dhruva takes a
vow to attain a place above all others,
and goes off to the forest to perform aus-
terities (tapas). After enduring bodily
mortifications for eons, the god Vishnu
appears to Dhruva to grant him a boon.
In response to Dhruva’s request for a
place above all others, Vishnu promises
Dhruva that after his death he will be
installed as the Pole Star, the pivot
around which all the other stars in the
sky will turn. Even now this star is
known by that name in India.
Dhuni
(from Sanskrit dhu, “to ignite”) A
smoldering fire that is kept burning by
ascetics. This fire serves multiple pur-
poses in ascetic life: It is a means to
stay warm in cold climates, a means to
perform physical asceticism by with-
standing heat, particularly in the sum-
mer, and its care and tending is also a
form of religious observance. The
dhuni is a natural gathering place, and
for many ascetics it is the center of
ascetic life, providing heat for warmth,
a fire for cooking and making tea, and
coals for lighting the chillum, a
straight pipe used to smoke tobacco
mixed with hashish (charas). The fire
itself is seen as the deity Agni in mate-
rial form. Agni is a witness to the con-
versation around the dhuni, which
should be of a serious and spiritual
nature. The dhuni’s sacred character
can be seen by certain restrictions that
were designed to maintain its purity:
one should not blow directly on the
fire (lest some saliva should contami-
nate it), but through a tube used for
this purpose; one should keep clean
the boundary around the dhuni (usu-
ally of made of hardened clay); and
one should not touch this boundary
[[195]]
Dhupa
with one’s feet. Certain ascetic centers
have a long history of a continuous fire.
One such example is the sacred village
Triyuginarayan in the Himalayas, where
a fire is claimed to have been burning for
the past three cosmic ages (yugas).
Dhupa
(“incense”) The eleventh of the sixteen
traditional upacharas (“offerings”)
given to a deity as part of worship,
which follows the model of treating a
deity as an honored guest. In this offer-
ing, the deity is offered incense to enjoy
the scent. The underlying motive here,
as for all the upacharas, is to show one’s
love for the deity and minister to the
deity’s needs.
Dhushmeshvar
Another name for the form of the
god Shiva known as Ghrneshvar. This
is one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a group
of sacred sites (tirthas) deemed
especially holy to Shiva, and at which
Shiva is believed to be uniquely present.
This site is located in Maharashtra state.
See Ghrneshvar.
Dhvani
(“echo”) In poetics—whether secular or
sacred—the suggestion or connotation
brought out by the poet’s language.
Indian literary theorists paid great
attention to this notion, since attention
to it allowed the poet to exercise much
greater emotive depths than the surface
meanings of the words would indicate
and pack a much deeper range of
images and associations into even a very
short verse.
Dhyana
(“meditation”) In the ashtanga yoga
(eight-point discipline) first arranged by
the philosopher Patanjali, dhyana is the
seventh of the eight elements of yoga
practice. Along with dharana (“concen-
tration”) and samadhi (“trance”),
dhyana is one of the three parts known
[[196]]

as the “inner discipline” (samyama), the
culmination of yogic training. Dhyana is
described as an extension of dharana, in
which the fixed concentration upon an
object acquired in dharana is continued
and extended without break. In more col-
loquial modern usage, the word dhyana
can be used to describe any sort of
focused meditation.
Dhyanashloka
(“meditation verse”) A verse or verses
specifying the physical attributes of a
deity to give the worshiper a mental
image upon which to meditate.
Dhyanashlokas are particularly impor-
tant in the esoteric ritual tradition
known as tantra, in which one of the
aims is to replace all outward acts of
worship with mental activities. In
this highly ritualized context, the
dhyanashlokas provide both a form and
a focus for one’s interior worship.
Diaspora Populations
Although the vast majority of Hindus
live in their traditional homeland of
South Asia, particularly in India and
Nepal, there is also a long history of
Hindus settling in other lands. By about
the fourth century C.E., Hindu traders
had spread Indian influence throughout
Southeast Asia, where the monuments
at the Angkor temple complex and the
culture of Bali bear witness to its pres-
ence. In the past century, poverty and
overcrowding in certain parts of India
(especially Bihar) led many of these
traders to sign up as agricultural con-
tract laborers in Fiji, South Africa, East
Africa, the West Indies, Mauritius, and
even Sri Lanka. All of these places have
substantial
Hindu
communities,
although their local status differs. In
some of these places Indians are consid-
ered equal citizens with the indigenous
peoples, and in others, such as Fiji, they
suffer legal obstacles. Aside from agri-
cultural labor, another possibility for
mobility and advancement came
through serving in the British army orDikshanama
civil service in other parts of the British
Empire, such as Singapore or Hong
Kong. Finally, the liberalization of immi-
gration and nationalization laws since
the end of World War II has led to the for-
mation of a substantial Hindu commu-
nity in North America, both in Canada
and the United States.
Didarganj Yakshi
Statue found in 1919 in Didarganj, a vil-
lage near Patna in the state of Bihar. The
image is believed to date from the third
century B.C.E. and is thus a product of
the Maurya dynasty. The statue is of a
voluptuous female figure, bare to the
waist, wearing abundant jewelry and
bearing a yak-tail whisk (chauri), which
was a contemporary sign of authority. It
is believed to be a statue of a yakshi, a
class of nature-spirits connected with
fertility and prosperity. It is notable as
one of the earliest known stone statues,
and there is speculation that this may
have come through contact with the
Greeks. The figure itself is masterfully
rendered in highly polished Chunar
sandstone from the sandstone quarries
near Benares; the sharply detailed ren-
dering of her clothing and jewelry con-
veys the illusion of softness and swelling
of the bare flesh.
Digambara
(“space-clad,” i.e., naked) In a general
ascetic context, this can refer to any
ascetic who is completely naked, which
is a sign of having renounced all posses-
sions and all worldly conventions.
Among the Bairagi Nagas, or renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta) of
Vishnu and who formerly made their
living as traders and mercenary soldiers,
the Digambaras are one of the three
Naga anis (“armies”), the others being
the Nirmohis and Nirvanis. In earlier
times these anis were actual fighting
units, but in modern times are mainly
important for determining bathing
(snana) order in the bathing proces-
sions at the Kumbha Mela (“Festival of
the Pot”). Of the three, the Digambaras
are by far the most important, and at the
time of the Kumbha Mela take prece-
dence over the others.
Diksha
(“initiation”) A religious initiation
involving the reception of secret reli-
gious teachings; the term is said to be
derived from the verb dis, “to point out.”
The word diksha carries a different
sense from the life-cycle rite known as
upanayana, the adolescent religious ini-
tiation that is the ritualized “second
birth” conferred on young men from the
three “twice-born” groups—that is,
brahmin (priestly), kshatriya (martial),
or vaishya (mercantile). Both are
religious initiations, and both involve
the creation of new capacities and
entitlements. Yet diksha is not a rite
usually seen as a transition point in the
life cycle, but a religious initiation in
which the initiate gains secret knowl-
edge from a religious teacher (guru),
usually given in the form of the verbal
formulas known as mantras. Whereas
upanayana takes place while a boy is
an adolescent, the time for diksha
is based not on physical age, but
on a person’s willingness and
readiness. Diksha is a particularly
important concept in the ritual
tradition known as tantra, in which
such personalized initiations are the
way of transmitting the tradition from
master to student.
Dikshanama
(“diksha name”) Name given to a
person after receiving initiation
(diksha), as a way of acknowledging and
reinforcing the new identity created by
the act of initiation. Sometimes, as in
the case of ascetic initiation, the
initiate’s former name will be replaced
with the dikshanama. In other cases the
name will be kept secret, as a source of
hidden power.
[[197]]
Dikshitar
Dikshitar
Southern Indian brahmin (priest) sub-
community. The Dikshitars are an
extremely small community and are
found mainly in the temple-town of
Chidambaram in the state of Tamil
Nadu. They are the hereditary servants
at the temple of Nataraja—the god
Shiva in his form as the “Lord of
the Dance.” According to their own
mythic understanding, the Dikshitars
were members of Nataraja’s heavenly
host (gana) when he lived in heaven.
They accompanied Nataraja when
he came down to earth, where they still
serve him.
Dilip
In Hindu mythology, one of the figures
in the charter myth describing how the
river Ganges descended from heaven to
earth. Dilip is the great-grandson of
King Sagar, and the father of the sage
Bhagirath, who finally accomplishes
this task. The story begins with King
Sagar, whose 60,000 heroic sons made
the mistake of insulting the sage Kapila,
and have been burned to ash by the fire
of Kapila’s yogic powers. Kapila tells
Sagar’s grandson Anshuman that the
souls of his dead uncles will find peace
only when the Ganges River (which is
considered to be the material form of
the goddess Ganga) comes down from
heaven and touches their ashes. After
this, the family labors unceasingly to do
this; Anshuman and Dilip die with this
goal unrealized, but Bhagirath finally
brings it to fruition by performing
asceticism until the gods agree to send
the Ganges to earth.
Dindi
Pilgrim group in the Varkari Panth, a
religious community that is centered
around the worship of the god Vithoba
at his temple at Pandharpur in modern
Maharashtra. The primary Varkari reli-
gious practice is taking part in two
annual pilgrimages, in which all the par-
ticipants arrive in Pandharpur on the
[[198]]

same day. On this pilgrimage, pilgrims
travel in groups called dindis. Dindis are
often made up of people from the same
neighborhood or area and are usually
formed along caste lines. During the pil-
grimage, members of a dindi travel as a
unit, walking and singing devotional
hymns together during the day, and
cooking and camping together at night.
These dindis thus create smaller
subcommunities within the larger
pilgrim body.
Di Nobili, Roberto
(1577–1656) Jesuit priest and missionary
who spent much of his life in Madurai in
southern India. Di Nobili came to India
to convert Indians to Catholicism and to
facilitate his attempt at following the
Jesuit pattern of learning the local lan-
guages, in this case Sanskrit (sacred lan-
guage) and Tamil. He also strove to
understand local culture and to gain the
ritual authority that came with brahmin
(priestly) status by emulating brahmin
practices (vegetarianism, modes of
dress, etc.), as a way to spread the
Gospel more effectively. He was a per-
ceptive and careful observer, but his
writings remained unpublished during
his lifetime. They have only been recently
rediscovered. See also Tamil language.
Dipa
(“lamp”) The twelfth of the sixteen tradi-
tional upacharas (“offerings”) given to
a deity as part of worship, following the
model of treating the deity as an hon-
ored guest. In this action, the deity is
given an offering of light by waving a
lighted lamp before it. This rite more
commonly goes by the name of arati, a
word that is often used to denote wor-
ship in general. The underlying motive
here, as for all the upacharas, is to show
one’s love for the deity, and to minister
to the deity’s needs.

Divine Life Society
Religious organization founded in 1936
by Swami Shivananda. It is headquar-
tered at the Divine Life Ashram, just
outside the holy city of Rishikesh on the
river Ganges in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. Although Shivananda himself
died in 1963, the society is still quite
active in spreading the ways of Hindu
life: through yoga (self-discipline) train-
ing programs at the Divine Life Ashram;
through publishing religious texts, both
traditional scriptures and the teachings
of Swami Shivananda; through estab-
lishing religious centers throughout the
world; and through various social ser-
vice projects in India itself. Swami
Shivananda was a Dashanami Sanyasi
(ascetic) in the Saraswati division,
which is one of the divisions that admits
only brahmins (priests). The Swami’s
brahmin background comes through in
the organization’s teachings, which
stress vegetarianism, rigorous spiritual
development, an emphasis on learning,
and a strict moral code. For all these rea-
sons the organization is widely respected in
Indian society, despite having a significant
number of foreign practitioners.
Divine Powers
When a single divinity is deemed to be
the supreme power in the universe, he
or she is generally said to wield five over-
arching divine powers: creation, order-
ing and maintaining the cosmos,
destruction, concealment, and giving
grace (divine self-revelation). The first
three powers describe the relationship
between the deity and the physical uni-
verse, whereas the fourth and fifth focus
on the deity’s relationship with individ-
ual devotees. By using the power of con-
cealment, the deity becomes hidden
in creation, and thus human beings
are kept in ignorance. This power
of concealment is often also described
as the deity’s maya, or the power of
illusion that keeps human beings from
[[199]]
Divorce
perceiving the divine reality that lies
behind all things. This power of illusion
is so strong that the only way human
beings can break through it is through
the deity’s grace, the final power. This
grace is an act of divine self-revelation,
in which the deity shreds the concealing
veil of illusion and reveals himself or
herself to human beings.
Divorce
Until the twentieth century, formal
divorce did not exist in traditional
Hindu society. This absence was
undoubtedly rooted in the Hindu per-
spective on marriage. Marriage was
seen as a permanent binding of hus-
band and wife (or more precisely,
assimilating her identity to his), in a
way that ruled out a dissolving of the
marriage while both members were
still living. When a wife failed to bear
children, the husband would some-
times take a second wife, but the origi-
nal marriage would remain intact.
Among the lower social classes, who
were often less concerned with main-
taining group status through appropri-
ate behavior, husbands and wives would
simply abandon their spouses for other
partners, but this was strictly forbidden
among “respectable” people.
Divorce is legally available in modern
India, but social and cultural factors
continue to weigh against it. Various fac-
tors make many women in unhappy
marriages reluctant to sue for divorce:
lack of support from their natal families,
who are often more interested in trying
to make the marriage work; the inability
to earn a living on their own; and the
near certainty that their husband’s fam-
ilies will be awarded custody of their
children, if they have any. Although atti-
tudes are slowly changing, it is also still
difficult for divorced women to remarry.
Divya Prabandham
(“Divine Composition”) Shorter name
for the Nalayira Divyaprabandham,
the collected hymns of the Alvars. The
[[200]]

Alvars were a group of twelve Vaishnava
poet-saints (devotees of the god
Vishnu), who lived in southern India
between the seventh and tenth cen-
turies. In conjunction with their Shaiva
(devotees of the god Shiva) counter-
parts, the Nayanars, the Alvars spear-
headed the revitalization of Hindu
religion vis-à-vis the Buddhists and the
Jains. Both the Alvars and the Nayanars
stressed passionate devotion (bhakti) to
a personal god—Vishnu for the Alvars,
Shiva for the Nayanars—and conveyed
this devotion through hymns sung in
the Tamil language. In the southern
Indian religious community known as
the Shrivaishnavas, the collected
hymns of the Alvars have such high sta-
tus that they are known as the “Tamil
Veda”—that is, the religious texts in
the Tamil language which carry the
authority of the Veda, the oldest Hindu
religious texts.
Diwali
One of the most important festivals in
the Hindu religious year, which falls on
the new moon in the lunar month of
Kartik (October–November). This festi-
val is dedicated to Vishnu’s wife
Lakshmi, a goddess who represents
wealth, prosperity, and good fortune.
According to popular belief, on this
night of the new moon Lakshmi roams
the earth, looking for households in
which she will be welcomed, and which
she will render prosperous by her pres-
ence. People spend the days before
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and white-
washing their homes to make them suit-
able for welcoming the goddess. On the
evening of Diwali people open all their
doors and windows to facilitate her
entry and place lights on their win-
dowsills and balcony ledges, as an invi-
tation to the goddess. In earlier times
these lights would be clay lamps or can-
dles, but today strings of electric lights
are also widely used. It is from these
lights that Diwali gets its name, as a
shortened form of Dipavali (dipa “light”
+ avali “series”). The charter myth forDog
Bright, spinning lights decorate homes and streets during the festival of Diwali.
According to Hindu tradition, these lights welcome Lakshmi, a goddess who embodies good fortune.
displaying these lights describes how a
poor old woman somehow gained a
royal boon that all houses but hers
would remain unlit on the night of
Diwali. When Lakshmi wandered the
land she went to the only house that was
lit to welcome her. Because of Lakshmi’s
presence, the old woman’s troubles
quickly ceased.
Lakshmi’s strong associations with
money and good fortune account for
several other practices often found on
Diwali. For many traditional merchant
families, Diwali is observed as the
beginning of the fiscal year. All out-
standing debts and obligations must be
cleared up beforehand, for on Diwali
new account books are begun. In some
cases the account ledgers are them-
selves ceremonially worshiped on this
day and are seen as material manifesta-
tions of Lakshmi. Another common
practice is gambling, although in most
cases it is done within the family, and for
small stakes. During the rest of the year
gambling is condemned as a potential
drain on one’s wealth, but doing so on
Diwali reaffirms the connection
between money and Lakshmi’s favor,
here in the guise of Lady Luck. Diwali is
also an occasion for eating sweets—the
more the better—and celebrating the
advent of the new year by shooting off
fireworks. India’s loose regulation of fire-
works gives celebrants access to rockets
and crackers of truly impressive size,
and in the larger cities people celebrate
the holiday with such zeal that it sounds
like an artillery barrage.
Dog
In general, the dog is considered an
extremely unclean and impure animal.
Today, keeping dogs as pets in India
is a practice that is gaining favor.
Traditionally, however, Indian dogs
roamed the streets as scavengers, eating
whatever they could find, including
each other. Such promiscuous eating
habits render them ritually impure, even
aside from the vermin and disease that
they often harbor, particularly rabies.
Aside from their practical importance as
scavengers, the dog is also the animal
vehicle of Bhairava, a wrathful form of
[[201]]
Doha
the god Shiva. Bhairava’s symbolic asso-
ciation with an unclean animal clearly
shows his marginal status in the
pantheon—he is powerful, but also
feared, because he is not bound by
normal rules.
Doha
Metrical form in northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poetry, made up of
two lines of twenty-four metric beats,
divided unevenly after the thirteenth
beat. The metric pattern for the first
line is 6 + 4 + 3, with the second line
being 6 + 4 + 1. The method of counting
the metric beats is based on the
distinction between “heavy” and “light”
syllables. A heavy syllable is any syllable
with a long vowel or a consonant cluster
and is reckoned at two metric beats; all
other syllables are reckoned as light, and
reckoned as one. Aside from the metric
pattern, there are rules about how each
half line should end—that the three
metric beats ending the first line cannot
be a heavy syllable (two beats) followed
by a light one (one beat)—which means
that it must either be a light syllable
followed by a heavy one, or three light
ones—and that the line’s final syllable
must be light. These conventions still
leave a great deal of fluidity, and the
doha is one of the most important
poetic forms for poets writing in Braj
Bhasha (the language of Krishna
devotion) and Avadhi (a dialect of
medieval Hindi). At times the doha can
stand alone, as in the epigrams of the
poet-saint Kabir, which have become
proverbial sayings in much of modern
India. The doha was also used in con-
junction with verses in other meters,
as in the Ramcharitmanas. In this
vernacular rendition of the epic
Ramayana, written by the poet-saint
Tulsidas, the doha usually comes after
four verses in the chaupai (four-line)
meter, and serves to sum up what has
transpired in the preceding verses.
[[202]]

Dom
The model for traditional Indian society
was as a collection of endogamous
subgroups known as jatis (“birth”).
These jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group has a monopoly. In traditional
northern Indian society, the Doms are a
jati whose hereditary occupation was
cremating corpses. They have extremely
low social status because of their habit-
ual contact with dead bodies, consid-
ered the most violently impure objects
of all. Despite their low status, some of
the Doms are unbelievably wealthy,
particularly the ones who control the
cremation ghats in the city of Benares,
for without their cooperation, a body
cannot be burned. The word ghat refers
to any flat area on the bank of a river. In
most cases ghats are used as places for
bathing (snana), but in some other
cases they are also places for burning
bodies, so that the ashes can be placed
in the river to ritually "cool" them.
Dorasamudra
Capital city of the Hoysala dynasty, who
ruled the region in southern part of the
state of Karnataka from the eleventh to
the thirteenth centuries. Today
Dorasamudra is known by the name of
Halebid and is a village about sixty miles
north and west of the city of Mysore.
Although largely uninhabited, the site is
known for a magnificent collection of
temples, in particular the Hoysaleshvar
Temple, dedicated to the god Shiva in
his form as Lord of the Hoysalas. The
Hoysala temples were built out of a par-
ticular type of stone—variously
described as chlorite schist, steatite, or
soapstone—that was quite soft when
newly quarried, but gradually hardened
with exposure to air. This initial mal-
leability made the stone easy to carve,
and facilitated the lush detail that char-
acterizes these temples.Dowry Death
Dowry
In the strictest terms, this word is used
in modern Indian society to designate
any wealth transferred from the bride’s
family to the groom’s as a condition for
the marriage to occur. As with most
marriages around the world, Hindu
marriages often involve giving gifts to
the couple, but Indians themselves draw
distinctions between different cate-
gories of gifts. It is customary for the
bride’s parents to give her gifts of cloth-
ing and jewelry for her wedding, accord-
ing to their means. This practice is
attested in the dharma literature’s (text
on religious duty) description of the
Brahma marriage. This is one of the
eight recognized ways to perform a mar-
riage and describes the bride as richly
adorned. These gifts are her personal
property, and serve both to give the
bride some wealth of her own and as a
last resort for the family. It is also com-
mon for the bride’s family to give gifts to
the groom and his family, of which the
greatest is the “gift of a virgin”
(kanyadan), i.e., the bride herself. In
many cases, the newlyweds also receive
gifts from other relatives, particularly
when they are setting up a household.
Both of these sorts of gifts carry no stig-
ma in Indian society and in the popular
mind are not considered “dowry.”
Unfortunately, not all wedding “gifts”
fall into these categories. Most mar-
riages in India are still arranged by the
parents, who are operating under differ-
ing imperatives. For the bride’s parents,
marrying off their daughter is a religious
duty, which is over and above their nat-
ural inclination to provide for their
daughter. This gives the groom’s parents
a distinct advantage, since they “take”
the bride, and this advantage can give
rise to ugly and even tragic situations.
The parents of a young man with a
promising career can usually expect
larger and richer gifts from the bride’s
family, since her future will be more
secure. In many cases these gifts are nei-
ther asked for nor negotiated, but sim-
ply given as part of the exchange
between two families of equal status. In
the worst cases, the groom’s family pre-
sents a list of demands, which the bride’s
family is expected to fulfill as a condi-
tion for the marriage. Given the pressure
to marry off their daughters, the bride’s
parents may promise more than they are
actually able to “deliver.” One conse-
quence of this failure is the much-publi-
cized dowry deaths, in which the bride
is killed.
Most decent people in India recoil at
the notion of “selling” their sons to the
highest bidder, or of using his marriage
as an opportunity for the family to get
rich. At the same time, it is generally
accepted that marrying one’s daughter
will entail considerable effort and
expenditure, and that at her wedding
one should give appropriate gifts. It is
from these assumptions that the evils of
dowry stem, and can be exploited by
unscrupulous people.
Dowry Death
Name given to a particular type of
violent crime against women. According
to the much-publicized pattern, it is
the killing of a new bride by her in-laws,
either for failing to bring enough
dowry with her into the marriage,
or when her parents could not deliver
the dowry that had been promised.
In many cases these women were killed
by being doused with kerosene and
lit, since this could be passed off as
an accidental death suffered while
cooking. These murders received great
publicity in India and abroad in
the mid-1980s, in part because of
their calculated and horrific nature.
The aforementioned pattern simplifies
the issues, however, by reducing it to
a question of money. It is true that
there have been many cases in which
women have been killed solely for
financial reasons—that is, for not
bringing enough dowry. Yet many of the
victims of these so-called dowry deaths
had been married for years, and their
deaths are better explained as the
result of an escalating pattern of
[[203]]
Draupadi
domestic violence, rather than
calculated extortion and murder.
a
Draupadi
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Draupadi is the
daughter of King Drupada, and the
wife of all five Pandava brothers, the
epic’s protagonists. This literary refer-
ence to polyandry (the marrying of one
woman to several brothers) is interest-
ing, since it seems to have been
extremely rare throughout Indian his-
tory, and the epic has to give an expla-
nation for how this happened.
Draupadi’s father vows that he will give
his daughter in marriage only to the
man who can lift a giant bow, and then
hit a target suspended in the air. This
feat is child’s play for Arjuna, one of the
Pandava brothers and the world’s great-
est archer, and he wins Draupadi as his
wife. The wedding party returns home,
but while they are still outside, their
mother Kunti calls out that whatever
they have won must be shared between
them. To obey their mother, each of the
brothers marry Draupadi. They agree
that each will live with her for a year,
during which time the others shall not
attempt to see her.
Draupadi’s most famous scene in
the epic comes after her husband
Yudhishthira has wagered and lost her
in a game of dice. Yudhishthira has been
gambling with his cousins Duryodhana
and Duhshasana, who seize Yudhishthira’s
gaming ineptitude as an opportunity to
win the kingdom all to themselves. After
the loss, Duhshasana comes to
Draupadi’s chamber and drags her by
her hair back to the gambling hall. Her
pain and humiliation are compounded
by the fact that she is in the middle of
her menstrual period and is not allowed
to change her stained robe. In the gam-
bling hall Draupadi is paraded and
humiliated before the crowd like an ani-
mal at auction, and her property status
is emphasized when Duryodhana offers
her his thigh (the euphemism for the
genitals) as her place to sit. The final
[[204]]

insult comes when Duhshasana tries to
disrobe Draupadi by unwinding her sari.
Here the god Krishna enacts a miracle:
No matter how much cloth Duhshasana
pulls away, Draupadi remains fully
clothed. Stunned and confused, he
finally gives up.
Shocked by her humiliation,
Duryodhana’s father Dhrtarashtra
asks Draupadi to choose a boon. She
chooses freedom for her husbands,
although they eventually agree to
spend a period in exile. Even before
this incident there has been tension
between the Pandavas and their
cousins. With these insults to
Draupadi, however, the seeds of dis-
cord are more deeply sown. Because
Duhshasana has dragged her by the
hair, Draupadi vows to leave her hair
unbound until she can wash it in
Duhshasana’s blood, while her hus-
band Bhima takes an oath to avenge
Duryodhana’s insult by smashing
Duryodhana’s “thigh.” Draupadi’s
hunger for revenge and uncompromis-
ing hatred for these two are a major
force driving the remainder of the epic,
pushing all the parties toward the
inevitable fratricidal war.
Dravida
One of the three developed styles in
medieval Hindu temple architecture;
the others being the Nagara and the
Veshara. The Dravida style is primarily
found in southern India, particularly in
the modern state of Tamil Nadu.
Whereas the temple tower in the Nagara
style stresses an unbroken verticality,
culminating in one high peak, towers in
the Dravida style are composed of a
series of horizontal tiers, emphasizing
the successive layers. Although earlier
southern Indian temples have as their
focus one central tower, as at the
Rajrajeshvar Temple in the city of
Tanjore, the focus shifted in about the
twelfth century to the building of walls
around the temple’s complex perime-
ters. These walls had enormous gopu-
rams or central gateways at the cardinalDreams
points, which were usually the temple’s
tallest structures by far. The enclosed
area inside the temple complex was
often enormous, as in the estimated 500
acres at the temple of Shrirangam, but
most of the construction was only a single
story. (There would be taller towers over
the temple’s primary images, however.)
In the developed examples of the
Dravida style, this lessened emphasis on
soaring height was compensated by its
enormous horizontal spread. The best
examples of this later type are the
Ranganathaswamy temple in Shrirangam,
and the Minakshi temple in Madurai.
Dravida
(2) Brahmin (priestly) group that is one
of the five southern brahmin communi-
ties (Pancha Dravida). As their name
would indicate, the core region for the
Dravida brahmins is in deep southern
India, in the modern states of Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. The most illustrious of
the Dravida subcommunities are the
Nambudiris, among whom the great
philosopher Shankaracharya is believed
to have been born.
Dravidian
In the strictest linguistic sense, the word
Dravidian is the name for a particular
family of languages in which the primary
members are the four southern Indian
languages: Tamil, Telegu, Kannada, and
Malayalam. Aside from these four lan-
guages, all located in the southernmost
part of the subcontinent, another lan-
guage in the Dravidian family is Brahui.
This is spoken by a small and fairly iso-
lated population in modern Pakistan, far
from any other Dravidian language
speakers, and completely surrounded
by people speaking Indo-Aryan lan-
guages. One theory to explain this irreg-
ularity is that the Dravidian languages
were originally spoken all over the sub-
continent, but were gradually displaced
toward the south as Indo-Aryan lan-
guage speakers—better known as the
Aryans—came into India. According to
Built in the Dravida architectural style, the
Minakshi Temple contains enormous gopurams,
the gateways to the temple grounds.
this theory, the Brahui-speaking com-
munity is an isolated remnant of that
earlier time, which somehow managed
to remain intact.
This notion also affects how south-
ern Indians form their identities. The
word Dravidian can be used to denote a
southern Indian or any person whose
mother tongue is one of the four primary
Dravidian languages. For southern
Indians with a strong regional identity, it
is a way for them to distinguish them-
selves from northern Indians and the
“imperialism” of northern Indian cul-
ture. It is also used with an underlying
tone of pride, that as Dravidians they are
descendants of the subcontinent’s origi-
nal inhabitants.
Dreams
As symbol and reality, dreams have
multiple uses in Hindu thought.
Philosophically, dreams are often used
as examples to illustrate the illusory
nature of the world as it is perceived.
Just as a dream disappears when one
[[205]]
Drona
wakes up and is perceived to have been
unreal the entire time, so does the every-
day understanding of the world disap-
pear when one has perceived the
ultimate truth. In quite a different
understanding, the dream state is the
second of the states of consciousness
mentioned in the Mandukya Upanishad,
or one of the religious texts known as
the Upanishads. In the Upanishads,
the dream state is the first step in turn-
ing one’s awareness away from the out-
side world and into one’s Self, where all
sense of ego is lost. Waking conscious-
ness is further away from one’s Self
than the dream state. The four-step
pattern in this upanishad, and in oth-
ers as well, is from waking conscious-
ness, to dreams, to deep sleep, and
from there to the realization of the
eternal Self.
On quite another level, dreams are
an important part of religious life in
popular Hinduism. They are often
believed to give omens for the future,
which may be interpreted as favorable
or unfavorable, according to the dream’s
content and context. Dreams are also
seen as providing a channel for commu-
nicating with spirits, ghosts, village
deities, and other nonhuman spiritual
beings. Unquiet spirits of the dead will
often appear to family members in
dreams to reveal what they need to find
peace. The same process is often found
with village deities, who usually mani-
fest themselves to specific people in the
village, either to give warnings or to
make demands.
Drona
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Drona is
famous as a teacher of all the arts of
war, but particularly for teaching
archery. He is the martial preceptor to
both the Pandavas and the Kauravas,
the two royal factions whose battle
for power is at the heart of the
Mahabharata. Drona is the son of the
sage Bharadvaja, born through an
[[206]]

involuntary seminal emission when
the sage sees a celestial nymph
(apsara). Drona’s skill in weapons is
gained from the god Vishnu’s Parashuram
avatar, who bequeaths both his
weapons and his skills to Drona as a
boon. Drona’s skill as an archer is leg-
endary, as is his prowess as an archery
teacher. Among his pupils he has a par-
ticular fondness for Arjuna (a
Pandava brother), whose commit-
ment and concentration so outstrip
his peers that Drona promises Arjuna
that he will be the world’s greatest
archer. This support for Arjuna can be
seen in the story of Ekalavya, a tribal
boy whom Drona refuses to teach
because of his low status, but who
becomes Arjuna’s equal as an archer by
worshiping a clay statue of Drona. When
Drona discovers this, he demands that
Ekalavya give him his right thumb as a
preceptor’s fee, to ensure that no one will
be Arjuna’s equal.
During the Mahabharata war, Drona
fights valiantly on the side of Duryodhana
(eldest son of Dhrtarashtra), but is
finally killed by King Drupada’s son
Dhrshtadyumna. In the epic, Drupada
and Drona have a long history of con-
flict. They have lived together as stu-
dents, but after their student life ends
Drupada becomes the king of Panchala,
whereas Drona is so poor he cannot
afford to feed his family. On one occa-
sion, when Drona asks Drupada for
alms, Drupada upbraids him most
insultingly. Drona vows revenge, and
after teaching the arts of war to the
Pandavas and Kauravas, Drona demands
Drupada’s kingdom as his teacher’s fee
(dakshina) from his students. When
Drupada is defeated, Drona takes half of
his kingdom; Drupada vows to get
revenge on Drona. Drupada subse-
quently performs a great fire sacrifice to
give birth to a son who will kill Drona.
Out of the fire come two luminous chil-
dren, one of whom is Dhrshtadyumna,
and the other his sister, Draupadi.Drupada
Dropsy
Bodily condition in which the body
retains excess water, and in conse-
quence swells up. In several hymns
in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu
religious texts, dropsy is described as
the punishment levied by the god
Varuna for speaking falsehood. Varuna
was conceived as the guardian of
cosmic order (rta), and intentionally
false speech was considered the
paradigm of anrta, the destructive force
that ran counter to the ordering force
of rta. In this case the punishment was
seen as fitting the crime, as if one had
been metaphorically inflated by the lies
one had told.
Drshtanta
(“example”) In Indian philosophy, the
examples that are one of the required
elements in the accepted form of an
inference (anumana). These examples
were provided as further evidence to
prove the reason (hetu) given to support
the hypothesis. As a rule, there had to be
two such examples. One was a positive
example (sapaksha) to show that similar
things happened in comparable cases,
and the other was a negative example
(vipaksha) to show that this did not
happen in other cases. In the most com-
mon example of an inference, “There is
fire on the mountain, because there is
smoke on the mountain,” the sapaksha
could be “like kitchen” (a place with
both fire and smoke), and the vipaksha
“unlike lake” (a place without fire or
smoke). The purpose of both examples
is to support the reason given, by show-
ing that this reason gives sufficient
cause to support the theory.
Drugs
The attitude toward drugs in Hindu
society shows the incredible variation
for which the Hindu religion is famous.
In general, the use of drugs is zealously
condemned among “respectable” people,
as is anything leading to a potential loss
of control. Yet Hindu mythology also
portrays the god Shiva as regularly con-
suming intoxicants, particularly bhang,
a preparation made primarily from mar-
ijuana, and datura, a genus of plants
containing poisonous alkaloids. Given
this mythic example, some of Shiva’s
devotees (bhakta) do the same as a vari-
ety of religious practice. Many ascetics
regularly spend much of their day smok-
ing hashish (charas) mixed with tobac-
co, although this is not always viewed as
normal ascetic practice. There are also
particular times and places when con-
sumption of drugs is more accepted,
even
among
“normal”
people.
Consuming bhang is a fairly common
element in the celebration of certain fes-
tivals, such as Shivaratri (“Night of
Shiva”) and Holi (the festival of reversal).
It is also sometimes consumed when
people are on pilgrimage, and govern-
ment-regulated stands selling bhang
can be found at several important pil-
grimage places (tirtha), including
Benares, Puri, and Haridwar. Despite
this more widespread use in particular
specialized contexts, there are many
people who do not use drugs under any
circumstances and would never consider
doing so. Such rigid refusal is still only one
part of the “orthodox” picture, in which
one can find many different attitudes.
Drupada
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Drupada is the king
of the Panchala region, and the father of
Dhrshtadyumna and Draupadi. Much
of Drupada’s life is absorbed by his
struggle with Drona, who has been one
of Drupada’s fellow students. After their
course of studies is finished, Drupada
assumes his throne and lives quite lav-
ishly, whereas Drona is so poor that he
cannot even afford to feed his family. In
distress, Drona approaches Drupada for
help, reminding him of their past con-
nection. Drupada arrogantly dismisses
him, telling him that such ties are of no
consequence. Drona swears that he will
get revenge, and after teaching the arts
of war to the Pandavas and Kauravas,
[[207]]
Duhshasana
the two royal factions whose battle for
power is at the heart of the
Mahabharata, demands Drupada’s
kingdom as his preceptor’s fee
(dakshina). After Drupada is defeated,
Drona takes half of his kingdom, where-
upon Drupada swears revenge. He per-
forms a great sacrifice to give birth to a
son who will kill Drona. Two children
emerge from the sacrificial fire:
Dhrshtadyumna, who eventually kills
Drona; and Draupadi, who becomes the
wife of all five Pandavas. During the
Mahabharata war, Drupada fights on the
side of the Pandavas, his sons-in-law. He
is eventually killed in battle by Drona
but is later avenged by his son
Dhrshtadyumna, who kills Drona.
Duhshasana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Duhshasana
is one of the hundred sons of
Dhrtarashtra, who are collectively
known as the Kauravas. The heart of the
Mahabharata is the struggle for power
between the Kauravas and their cousins
the Pandavas, and the latter are the
epic’s protagonists. Duhshasana is most
infamous for his misbehavior toward
the Pandavas’ common wife Draupadi
after the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira,
loses everything—including Draupadi—
in a game of dice. Duhshasana drags
Draupadi into the gambling hall by her
hair and with her garments stained by
her menstrual blood; he also attempts
to disrobe Draupadi by pulling off her
sari, but is frustrated here by the god
Krishna, who miraculously makes
Draupadi’s sari infinitely long.
Duhshasana’s behavior in this inci-
dent only fans the enmity between the
two families. Draupadi’s husband
Bhima, the Pandava brother renowned
for his physical strength, vows to avenge
this insult by ripping open Duhshasana’s
chest and drinking his blood, whereas
Draupadi vows that she will leave her
hair unbound until she can wash it in
Duhshasana’s blood. During the
Mahabharata war Duhshasana fights
[[208]]

with his brother Duryodhana and is
eventually killed by Bhima, after which
both Bhima and Draupadi fulfill their
dreadful vows. As an extra measure of
revenge before killing Duhshasana,
Bhima tears off the hand that had held
Draupadi’s hair and beats Duhshasana
with his own severed limb.
Durga
(“inaccessible, impassable”) A particular
form of the Hindu Mother Goddess,
although the name is often used as a
more general title for the mother god-
dess in her fierce and powerful form. As
depicted in images and pictures, Durga
rides on a lion and holds in her eight
hands the weapons of all the gods. Both
of these features correspond to the
description of the great goddess in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest and most
important mythic text used for the
worship of the Goddess as the
supreme divine power. The general
identification of Durga with this great
Goddess is underscored by the
Devimahatmya’s other common name,
the Durgasaptashati (“The 700 [verses]
on Durga”). As a form of the great
Goddess, Durga is a major divinity in the
Hindu pantheon and in modern Hindu
life. The eighth day in the waxing and
waning halves of the lunar month are
considered sacred to her, and her rites
are practiced on those days. Her most
important festivals are the Nine Nights
(Navaratri), which occur in both the
spring and the fall. In each of these festi-
vals Durga is worshiped in her nine
forms (Navadurga), one on each
consecutive night. The variety of
goddesses as which she is worshiped
again shows us how Durga is conceived
as the embodiment of the Goddess in all
her forms.
Durgasaptashati
(“700 [verses in praise of ] Durga”)
Another name for the Devimahatmya,
the earliest and most important mythic
text for the worship of the Goddess asDurvasas
Worshipers immerse an image of the goddess Durga in the Yamuna River, near New Delhi.
Durga is depicted riding a lion and holding a weapon in each of her eight hands.
the supreme divine power. It has this
name because the text is 700 verses
long, and Durga is one of the common
names designating this powerful god-
dess. The Devimahatmya is well-known
for its assertion that God is female. This
is a notion with no clear source in the
earlier tradition, where female deities
were insignificant. The text begins with
a frame story, but the bulk of the work is
three stories describing the salvific
activity of the Goddess, who is portrayed
as far superior to the pantheon’s male
gods. See Devimahatmya.
Durvasas
In Hindu mythology, a sage who is a par-
tial incarnation of the god Shiva.
Durvasas is the son of Anasuya, who for
her influence in persuading another
woman to remove a curse has been
given boons by the gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. Anasuya requests
that each be born as one of her sons,
and Vishnu is born as Dattatreya, Shiva
as Durvasas, and Brahma as Chandra. As
a mythic figure, Durvasas is noted for his
magic powers, which are not surprising
given his background. He is also known
for his bad temper and for his tendency
[[209]]
Duryodhana
to curse anyone who makes him angry.
One victim of his wrath is the maiden
Shakuntala, who in her reverie on her
newfound love with King Dushyanta
does not notice and pay homage to
Durvasas. She is cursed that her love
would completely forget her. In another
case Durvasas curses all the gods to be
subject to old age and death. This is
provoked by an “insult” from Indra’s
elephant Airavata, which had flung a
garland given by Durvasas to the
ground. As with most curses in Hindu
mythology, neither of these curses can
be withdrawn, but their severity is
reduced by mitigating conditions.
Shakuntala is told that King Dushyanta
will remember her if she shows him
some sign of their relationship, which
she does. The gods can avoid old age
and death by obtaining and consuming
the nectar of immortality (amrta).
As with all the sages, Durvasas can
also grant wonderful boons to people
with whom he is pleased. One such ben-
eficiary was Kunti, one of the heroines
in the epic Mahabharata. Durvasas
gives Kunti a powerful mantra (sacred
sound), which will allow her to have a
child by any of the gods simply by think-
ing about him. As soon as Kunti receives
this mantra, she tests it while looking at
the sun, and immediately bears the
golden child Karna. In her panic at
unexpectedly becoming a mother—she
is still unmarried, and understandably
concerned about what people might
think—she puts the child in a box and
abandons him in the Ganges. After her
marriage to Pandu (son of the sage
Vyasa and queen Ambalika), this
mantra is the only way that she is able to
have children, since Pandu has been
cursed to die the moment he sleeps with
one of his wives. She uses this mantra to
bear Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Bhima,
then teaches it to her co-wife Madri,
who bears Nakula and Sahadeva. Thus,
through the gift of Durvasas, all the
Pandava brothers—the epic’s protago-
nists—are children of the gods.
[[210]]

Duryodhana
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Duryodhana is
the eldest son of King Dhrtarashtra,
and thus the leader of the Kauravas,
one of the two royal factions whose
struggle for power is at the heart of the
epic. Duryodhana and ninety-nine
brothers are born in an unusual man-
ner. Their mother Gandhari gives birth
to a great lump of flesh, which is divid-
ed and put into one hundred pots of
clarified butter. In these pots the lumps
develop into infants. At the moment
Duryodhana is born there are a host of
evil omens, and when the court
astrologers are asked to interpret these,
they conclude that Duryodhana will be
the ruin of the country and his family,
and that it will be better to abandon
him to the elements. Fatherly feelings
prevent Dhrtarashtra from doing this,
which sets the stage for the final con-
flict. Even though the major force dri-
ving the epic’s plot is the animosity
between Duryodhana and his cousins,
the Pandavas, and this ends with the
Kauravas being utterly destroyed,
it would be inaccurate to paint
Duryodhana as an unredeemable vil-
lain. He is less evil than ill-starred—
proud, stubborn, unwilling to admit his
mistakes, and after a certain point,
unwilling to grant his cousins any
advantage. These character flaws are
magnified by the lack of strong guid-
ance from his father Dhrtarashtra, and
eventually spell his doom.
The rift between the cousins devel-
ops early, inflamed in part by the fact
that the Pandavas are more heroic than
Duryodhana and his brothers. As a
child, Bhima, the Pandava brother best
noted for his prodigious strength, used
to whip all hundred Kauravas at once.
Needless to say this does not endear him
to them. Later in adolescence, when
their archery teacher, Drona, requests
the capture of King Drupada as his pre-
ceptor’s fee, the Pandava brother Arjuna
succeeds in doing this, whereas
Drupada defeats Duryodhana in battle.Dushyanta
Another rift grows when the Pandavas
contest the right of Duryodhana’s friend
Karna to take part in an archery match,
claiming that Karna’s unknown parent-
age makes him unfit to compete with
kings. Duryodhana skirts that issue by
proclaiming Karna as the King of Anga,
but by then the bad blood between the
cousins is well-established.
This bad blood becomes apparent
in many different plots. Duryodhana
first tries to kill the Pandavas by build-
ing a flammable house of lac for them,
which is then set on fire. The Pandavas,
however, are able to escape unharmed.
Duryodhana later entices Yudhishthira
(a Pandava brother) into a game of dice.
Yudhishthira wagers and loses every-
thing that he has, including himself, his
brothers, and their common wife
Draupadi. After this loss Duryodhana
and his brother Duhshasana publicly
humiliate Draupadi, after which Bhima
swears a solemn oath to kill them both.
Dhrtarashtra gives the Pandavas their
freedom, which they promptly lose in
yet another game of dice. The outcome
of this loss is that the Pandavas agree to
spend twelve years in exile in the forest,
and live incognito for the thirteenth,
with the condition that if they are dis-
covered in the thirteenth year the cycle
will begin anew.
Despite the best efforts of Duryodhana’s
spies, the Pandavas manage to escape
detection during the thirteenth year,
and at its conclusion send envoys to
Duryodhana to claim their share of the
kingdom. Perhaps emboldened by
Yudhishthira’s comment that he and his
brothers will be satisfied with a mere
five villages, Duryodhana replies that he
will not give them enough land to put
under the point of a needle. In the face
of such stubbornness and injustice, the
Pandavas prepare for war to claim what
is rightfully theirs. During the war
Duryodhana fights valiantly, but in the
eighteen days of battle sees his forces
disintegrate around him. His final battle
is with Bhima, who in exchange for
Duryodhana’s earlier insult to Draupadi
(he had directed her to sit on his thigh,
which was a euphemism for the
genitals), smashes Duryodhana’s thigh
with his mace, killing him.
Dushana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Dushana is one of the
brothers of the demon-king Ravana.
Together with his brother Khara,
Dushana tries to avenge the honor of
their sister Shurpanakha, whose ears
and nose have been cut off by Rama’s
brother Lakshmana. In a fierce battle
with their demon (supernatural being)
army, Rama destroys the army and kills
Khara and Dushana. Seeing the failure
of her two brothers, Shurpanakha goes
to Ravana to beg for vengeance. Ravana
realizes he cannot kill Rama in battle but
resolves to avenge his sister by
kidnapping Sita, wife of Ravana. This
sets in motion the plot of the latter part
of the epic.
Dushyanta
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Dushyanta
is a king of the Lunar Line and
the husband of Shakuntala. Their
romance is also described in Kalidasa’s
drama Abhijnanashakuntala. Dushyanta
meets Shakuntala, who is living in a for-
est ashram (abode of an ascetic), while
he is hunting in the forest. They fall in
love and are married by their mutual
consent. After a short time Dushyanta
has to return to his kingdom, with
Shakuntala to follow soon after. In the
meantime, Shakuntala has been cursed
by the sage Durvasas that her beloved
will completely forget her, although
Durvasas later modifies the curse, and
says that Dushyanta will remember
everything if Shakuntala can show him
any proof of their union. The bulk of the
story in both episodes is concerned
with Shakuntala’s trials and tribulations
as she strives to regain her rightful place
as queen. In both versions, Dushyanta
is a minor character, but clearly an
essential one.
[[211]]
Dussehra
In Kulu, people celebrating the festival of Dussehra carry temple images in procession through the streets.
Dussehra
(variant of Dashahara, “ten days”)
Festival celebrated on the tenth day of
the bright (waxing) half of the lunar
month of Ashvin (September–October),
and one of the most important celebra-
tions in the year. The festival celebrates
the victory of good over evil, and is also
known as Vijaya Dashami (“Victory
Tenth”). The festival has two charter
myths, both of which mark the ultimate
triumph of good over evil. One charter
comes from the mythology of the
Goddess, and marks this as the day on
which Durga (form of the Hindu Mother
Goddess) slays the buffalo-demon
Mahishasura. This episode comes from
the Devimahatmya, and is the central
theme of the text—the goddess is born
[[212]]

to destroy Mahishasura when the gods
cannot, and the struggle between the
two is the climax of the text. Since the
nine days preceding Dussehra are the
fall Navaratri, the “nine nights” spent in
worship of the Goddess, it seems rea-
sonable that the tenth and concluding
day would be marked by the climactic
moment in the Devimahatmya, the
most important source of mythology for
the Goddess.
The other charter myth for this festi-
val comes from an entirely different
source, the mythology of Rama (the sev-
enth incarnation of Vishnu). This is cel-
ebrated as the day on which Rama slays
Ravana (demon-king of Lanka) and
regains Sita (wife of Rama) from captivity.
This victory is symbolized by burning
huge effigies of Ravana and his sonDvaita (“dual”) Vedanta
Meghanada (an epithet of Indrajit) on
the night of Dussehra, and these effigies
often contain fireworks to enhance their
pyrotechnic capacity. This time of year is
often celebrated with dramatic enact-
ments of the Ramayana (the Sanskrit
epic), known as the Ram Lila. In some
cases this lasts for ten days, ending on
Dussehra; in other cases (as in the Ram
Lila in Benares, the sacred city on the
banks of the Ganges River) it will last an
entire month, with Dussehra marking
the death of Ravana.
Dussehra is a highly auspicious day,
and popular tradition holds that any-
thing begun on this day will succeed.
Dussehra is thus a favored occasion for
initiating any important projects, begin-
ning endeavors, or forming organiza-
tions, even if it is only a token beginning.
Dussehra also marks the beginning of
the cool season, when the end of the hot
weather and the monsoon rains bring
better conditions for military action.
Both charter myths have connections
with battle and conquest, and in earlier
times Dussehra was particularly cele-
brated by the royal and martial classes.
On Dussehra it was customary for sol-
diers to worship their weapons. Given
the festival’s martial associations and
the guarantee that all things initiated on
that day would be successful, it was also
the day of choice for rulers to send out
their armies to invade neighboring terri-
tories. Even today one of the most spec-
tacular celebrations is in Mysore, where
the ruler presides over this festival in his
ritual position as king, even though he
no longer rules. The other great celebra-
tion is in Kulu, where all the deities in
the region journey to Kulu to celebrate
this festival (along with hordes of their
human retainers).
Dvadashakshara Mantra
(“[the] twelve-syllable mantra”) Twelve-
syllable mantra (sacred sound) used in
parts of the Vaishnava community. The
mantra is “Om namo bhagavate
narayanaya” (“Om, Homage to the
blessed Narayana”).
Dvaitadvaita Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the Vedas.
Dvaitadvaita Vedanta’s founder and
most important figure was the four-
teenth-century philosopher, Nimbarka.
Nimbarka stressed the worship of the
god Krishna and his companion Radha
as a divine couple, but on a philosophi-
cal level he was attempting to find some
middle ground between the monism of
the Advaita Vedanta school and the
dualism of the Dvaita Vedanta school.
The former claimed that a single
Ultimate Reality—called Brahman—lay
behind all things, and that all things
were merely differing forms of this sin-
gle reality. The latter emphasized the
utter distinction between God as
Ultimate Reality on the one hand, and
the world and human souls on the other.
Nimbarka stressed that the world and
souls were dependent on God, in whom
they exist and with whom they had a
subtle connection. Nimbarka thus sup-
ported the philosophical doctrine called
parinamavada, which stressed the real
transformation of the divine and the
capacity of human beings to transform
themselves back to their divine status.
Dvaita (“dual”) Vedanta
One of the branches of Vedanta, the
philosophical school claiming to reveal
the ultimate (anta) teaching of the
ancient sacred texts known as the
Vedas. Dvaita Vedanta’s founder and
most important figure was the philoso-
pher Madhva, who lived in southern
India in the thirteenth century.
Madhva’s basic theory is the utter tran-
scendence of God, and this conviction
leads him to suggest a philosophical
position known as dualism. Dualism
asserts a qualitative difference
between God in his transcendence and
the corruptions of material things.
According to Madhva, God is com-
pletely different from human Selves
and the material world, even though
[[213]]
Dvapara Yuga
both of these come from God and
depend on Him for their continuing
existence. In this dualism, Madhva dif-
fers sharply from the major school of
Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta. The Advaita
school upholds a philosophical posi-
tion known as monism, which is the
belief that a single Ultimate Reality—
called Brahman—lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely
differing forms of this single reality.
Whereas Advaita collapses all things
into one thing, Madhva firmly insists
on maintaining differences.
Madhva’s stress on dualism leads
him to clarify these differing types of
things, which is known as the “fivefold
difference”: the difference between God
and the Self, between God and the
world, between individual Selves,
between Selves and matter, and
between individual material things.
Even though each Self is believed to
contain an aspect of God, this funda-
mental difference gives the Self only a
limited capacity for religious life. This
limited power means that final libera-
tion of the soul comes solely through the
grace of God, who alone has the power
to effect it. Final liberation is conceived
both as freedom from rebirth and as the
soul’s opportunity to remain in the
divine presence forever.
With its stress on God’s utter tran-
scendence and the emphasis on grace
as the sole vehicle for salvation,
Madhva’s Dvaita Vedanta has often
been compared to the theology of John
Calvin. Madhva even stated that the
world had three classes of beings:
those eventually destined for libera-
tion (muktiyogas), those destined for
eternal rebirth (nityasamsarins), and
those destined for eternal damnation
(tamoyogas). Like Calvin, Madhva did
not see these categories as promoting
fatalism, but rather that the prospect
of never attaining liberation could urge
one to the faith necessary to pursue an
active religious life. For further infor-
mation see Karl H. Potter (ed.),
Presuppositions of India’s Philosophies,
[[1972]]
; and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

and Charles A. Moore (eds.), A
Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, 1957.
Dvapara Yuga
Particular age of the world in one of the
reckonings of cosmic time. According to
traditional belief, time has neither
beginning nor end, but alternates
between cycles of creation and activity,
followed by cessation and quietude.
Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32 billion
years, with an active phase known as the
Day of Brahma, and the quiet phase
known as the Night of Brahma. In one
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of
Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas (units of cosmic
time), named the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each of
these four yugas is shorter than its pre-
decessor, and ushers in an era more
degenerate and depraved. By the end of
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad
that the only solution is the destruction
and recreation of the earth, at which
time the next Krta era begins.
The Dvapara Yuga is thus the third of
the four yugas contained in a mahayuga,
and lasts for 864,000 years. The metal
associated with the Dvapara yuga is
bronze—less valuable than the gold and
silver associated with the earlier ages,
but better than the iron of the Kali yuga.
This is popularly believed to be the cos-
mic age in which the god Krishna
appeared on earth.
Dvarapala
(“door-protector”) Guardian images
placed on either side of the entrance to
a Hindu temple. These figures are usu-
ally portrayed as minor celestial beings
and conceived as the protectors of the
sacred space inside. Since any Hindu
temple is first and foremost the home
for the deity within, and since both
kings and gods often used the same
symbols to display and reinforce theirDwara
status, it is not surprising that the
deities would have some “servants”
guarding theirs door and restricting
access to them, in the same way as their
human counterparts.
Dvija
(“twice-born”) Name for a member of
the three “twice-born” groups in Indian
society, that is, a brahmin (highest in
status), kshatriya (second in status to
brahmins), or vaishya (third in status to
brahmins). This name exists because
these groups are ritually eligible to
receive the adolescent religious initia-
tion called upanayana, which is often
described as the “second birth.” See
twice-born.
Dvipas
According to traditional mythic geogra-
phy, the visible world is composed of a
series of seven concentric dvipas, a word
that literally means “islands,” but can be
translated to “landmasses.” All but one
of these are named after particular
plants. At the center is Jambu (“Rose-
apple”) dvipa, followed by Plaksha (“fig-
tree”) dvipa, Salmala (“silk-cotton tree”)
dvipa, Kusha (“kusha grass”) dvipa,
Krauncha (“curlew”) dvipa, Shaka
(“Teak”) dvipa, and at the outermost
edge, Pushkara (“blue lotus”) dvipa.
Each of these lands is separated from its
neighbors by one of the seven oceans
(the saptasindhu), with each ocean
composed of a different substance. The
innermost ocean, as experience shows,
is composed of salt water, the ones
beyond this are of sugar cane juice,
wine, ghee, yogurt, milk, and sweet
water, respectively. At the center of
Jambudvipa (and thus the world) is
Mount Meru, which is compared to the
central calyx of a lotus, and is surrounded
by the dvipas as its petals. The physical
world is thus seen as a symmetrical
whole, with the land of India (in the
southern part of Jambudvipa) posi-
tioned at the symbolic center.
Dvarapala, or gatekeeper, statue at the entrance of
the Brhadeshvar Temple in Thanjavur. These statues
depict minor deities that protect the space inside.
Dwara
(“door” or “gateway”) Among the
Bairagis, renunciant ascetics who are
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu,
the word dwara is used to denote a
branch or subsect of a particular order.
Each dwara is named after its ascetic
founder, who was himself usually a
noted disciple of the larger order’s
founder. For example, the Nimbarki
ascetics are one of the four estab-
lished orders among the militant
Vaishnava ascetics known as the
chatuh-sampradayi Nagas, along with
the Ramanandis, the Vishnuswamis,
and the Madhva Gaudiya (Brahma sam-
praday) ascetics. The Nimbarkis them-
selves are divided into nine dwaras, or
subsects, each named after the dwara’s
founder. The division of ascetics by
means of dwaras is another means of
subdividing ascetic orders, and creating
even more sharply defined ascetic iden-
tities and loyalties.
[[215]]
Dwaraka
Dwaraka
Sacred city (tirtha) on the western coast
of Gujarat, on the shore of the Arabian
Sea. In mythic terms, Dwaraka is most
famous as the capital city for the god
Krishna’s kingdom, at which he is
believed to have lived in the years fol-
lowing the Mahabharata war. Dwaraka’s
most important site is the Dwarakanath
Temple, dedicated to Krishna in his
form as the “Lord of Dwaraka.” Dwaraka
is also one of the four dhams (“divine
abodes”), sacred centers that approxi-
mately define the geographic bound-
aries of India; the three others are
Badrinath, Puri, and Rameshvaram.
Dwaraka is also the site of the Sharada
math, one of the four Dashanami
Sanyasi maths (monastic centers) sup-
posedly established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya. The Sharada math is
the headquarters of the Kitawara group
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, one of the
four major organizational groups, with
each one centered at one of the maths.
As with many other Hindu sacred sites,
Dwaraka is sanctified by a network of
mythic and religious associations.
Dyaus
A minor deity in the Vedas, the oldest
and most authoritative Hindu religious
texts. Dyaus is a god associated with
the sky, but his character is not well-
developed, since even at the time of the
Vedas he had been largely eclipsed by
other gods. Dyaus is part of the oldest
layer of Indo-Aryan deities, as evidenced
by the Greek form of his name, Zeus.
