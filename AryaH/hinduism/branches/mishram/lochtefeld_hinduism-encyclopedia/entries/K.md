Kabandha
(“headless trunk”) A demon in the
Ramayana (the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics) who attacks the god-king
Rama, the epic’s protagonist, and
Rama’s brother Lakshmana. In a previ-
ous life Kabandha has been a king of the
gandharvas, or celestial musicians; but
in a battle with the god Indra,
Kabandha’s head is pushed down into
his body. When Kabandha requests
some means by which he can eat, Indra
places a mouth in Kabandha’s belly.
Indra tells him that the curse will be
broken when Rama and Lakshmana cut
off his arms.
As Rama and Lakshmana travel
through a forest, searching for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, they are set upon
by Kabandha, who grabs each of them in
one of his long arms. Finding they could
not escape, Rama and Lakshmana each
slash off one of his arms, and with his
dying breaths Kabandha asks the broth-
ers to burn his body. As the body is
burning, the gandharva king arises from
the fire in his previous form and advises
the brothers to seek help from the mon-
key-king Sugriva.
Kabir
(mid-15th c.?) A poet who is widely
regarded as one of the greatest northern
Indian religious figures. Kabir is among
a group of central and northern Indian
poet-saints known as Sants who shared
several tendencies: emphasis on indi-
vidualized, interior religion leading to a
personal experience of the divine; dis-
dain for external ritual, particularly
image worship; faith in the power of the
divine Name; and a tendency to ignore
[[328]]

hierarchical distinctions between
castes. Kabir strongly adhered to these
beliefs—in his writings he uncompro-
misingly attacks any sort of religious
practice based on habit or tradition,
including asceticism, special modes of
dress, fasting (upavasa), image worship,
caste, and scripture.
In his poetry, Kabir identifies himself
as belonging to a caste of weavers (julaha),
and according to tradition he supported
himself through this occupation. Kabir’s
history makes it difficult to link him with
a particular religion. In Arabic, the name
Kabir (“Great”) is one of the names given
to Allah in the Qur’an, identifying him as
a Muslim. However, his poetry reveals
his great knowledge of Hindu religious
life. It is generally believed that the
members of Kabir’s julaha community
were recent converts to Islam who had
not yet been fully assimilated. Kabir’s
poetry, however, clearly shows that he
considered himself neither Hindu nor
Muslim. Part of Kabir’s popularity
undoubtedly stems from his blunt,
passionate affirmation that real
religious attainment is only gained by
internal, individual experience of the
divine, to which he gives the name Ram.
This is not the god-king who is the hero
of the Ramayana, but a name for the
indescribable,
absolute
Supreme
Reality. Both of these emphases reflect
the influence of the Nathpanthi
ascetics, who also stressed internal
experience and yoga.
In one of his songs, Kabir once boasted
that he had been so absorbed in the
divine that he had never put pen to
paper. His songs remain popular even
today, and many of his shorter epigrams
have become proverbial sayings. Kabir’s
oldest attested poetry survives in three
major collections: one in the Adigranth,
the Sikh scripture also known as the
“Primal Book”; one collected by the
Dadupanth, the religious organization
founded by the Sant poet-saint Dadu;
and the Bijak, which was compiled by
the Kabirpanth, a religious community
that claimed Kabir as its guru (religious
preceptor). The significant differencesKaikeyi
among these collections indicate that
they have no single source. For further
information see Charlotte Vaudeville
(trans.), Kabir, 1974; Linda Hess and
Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak of
Kabir, 1983; John S. Hawley and Mark
Juergensmeyer (trans.), Songs of the
Saints of India, 1988; Nirmal Dass, Songs
of Kabir from the Adi Granth, 1991; and
David Lorenzen, Kabir Legends and
Ananta-Das’s Kabir Parachai, 1991.
Kabirpanth
Religious community whose members
are followers of the northern Indian
poet-saint Kabir. Some Kabirpanthis are
ascetics, and some are householders.
The group’s most important center is
located in Benares (where Kabir is
believed to have lived) and houses an
ascetic community. Although in his
poetry Kabir rejects ritual, worship, and
reliance on anything but one’s own
unmediated experience—a context
implying the practice of yoga—the
Kabirpanth has taken on all of these
conventional religious trappings. The
community’s sacred text is the Bijak, a
collection of poems and epigrams
attributed to Kabir. Its sacred centers
have pictures of Kabir, who has become
an object of worship. Elaborate rituals
are performed on certain prescribed
days. This situation is ironic because it
appears that many of the practices Kabir
condemned have been adopted by the
community professing to follow his
teachings. Given Kabir’s continual
emphasis on the need for unmediated
personal experience of the divine, the
notion that he would be seen as the
founder of a sect would itself have been
outrageous to him. For further informa-
tion see David Lorenzen, “Traditions of
Non-Caste Hinduism: The Kabir Panth,”

Kadambari
Sanskrit romance novel authored by the
writer and dramatist Bana (7th c.), who
was a contemporary of the northern
Indian emperor Harsha. The love story
between the main characters, a princess
named Kadambari and a prince named
Chandripida, is but one element of the
book’s complex plot. The Kadambari
was left unfinished at Bana’s death. It
gives a detailed picture of Indian life
during Bana’s time.
Kadru
In Hindu mythology, the daughter of the
divine sage Daksha and sister of Vinata.
Kadru gives birth to a line of serpents,
whereas her sister’s children are born as
eagles, the most famous of whom is
Garuda. The well-known hostility
between these species is attributed to a
conflict between Vinata and Kadru: one
day they are arguing about the tail color
of a certain celestial horse, with Vinata
arguing that it is white and Kadru assert-
ing that it is black. The disagreement
becomes more intense until they finally
agree that whoever is wrong will become
a slave to the other. To ensure her victo-
ry, Kadru persuades a number of her
snake children to hang from
the back of the horse. From a distance
the tail appears to be black. (Some of
her children disapprove of such dishon-
esty and refuse to participate. In revenge
Kadru curses them to die in the snake-
killing sacrifice performed by King
Janamjeya.) When Vinata sees the black
snakes, she believes she has been
defeated and serves Kadru under
extremely harsh conditions for many
years. Vinata is finally rescued by her
son Garuda, who discovers the fraud
behind Vinata’s defeat and embarks on
a program of killing snakes that has
never stopped.
Kaikeyi
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kaikeyi is the second
wife of King Dasharatha, the mother of
Bharata, and foster mother to Rama,
the epic’s protagonist. Kaikeyi is directly
responsible for one of the most
[[329]]
Kailas
Mount Kailas, overlooking the Chiu Monastery in Tibet. Kailas is considered to be the mythic
Mount Meru, home of the god Shiva and the center of the universe.
villainous acts in the Ramayana: She
forces Rama into fourteen years of exile
in the forest, a major event in the epic’s
plot. Despite her evil action, she is not
considered an evil person, but rather a
person who acts out of love for her son
yet who is burdened with extremely bad
judgment and bad advice. When
Dasharatha announces that he intends
to anoint Rama as the heir to the throne,
Kaikeyi is as happy as everyone else.
Rama has always respected her as much
as his own mother, Kausalya, and has
treated Bharata as his equal. But as the
day of the ceremony approached,
Kaikeyi’s mind is slowly poisoned by her
maid, Manthara. Manthara convinces
Kaikeyi that after Rama has been
crowned the heir-apparent, she and
Bharata will be treated as little more
than chattel, or objects, if they are
allowed to live at all.
Kaikeyi’s concern for her son leads
her to drastic action. Many years before,
Dasharatha gave Kaikeyi two boons, or
rewards, for her help in winning a great
battle. She has never redeemed these
[[330]]

boons, but now demands that
Dasharatha exile Rama to the forest for
fourteen years and crown Bharata as
ruler in his place. Dasharatha pleads
with Kaikeyi, but she does not change
her mind. He is finally forced to grant
her wish. Kaikeyi’s request brings her
disgrace not only from her husband,
who curses her for separating him from
Rama, but also from her son. Bharata
rebukes Kaikeyi for depriving Rama of
what is rightfully his, and refuses to rule
until Rama orders him to serve in his
place during the exile. The only person
who does not condemn her is Rama,
whom the epic portrays as serenely
happy to obey his parents’ commands,
whatever they might be.
Kailas
Himalayan peak in southwestern Tibet
renowned as a pilgrimage place (tirtha)
for both Hindus and Buddhists. In
Hindu mythology, Kailas is believed to
be Mount Meru, the center of the uni-
verse. It is also believed that the top ofKaivalya
Mount Kailas is the place where the god
Shiva makes his home. For both Hindus
and Buddhists, the central act of pil-
grimage to Kailas is to walk around the
mountain, thus symbolically traversing
the entire earth. The journey begins at
Manasarovar, a lake near the moun-
tain’s base, which in Hindu mythology is
esteemed as the lake of the gods. Many
factors combine to make the sixty-five-
mile circuit an extremely difficult jour-
ney: The area is extremely remote, the
climate is harsh and unforgiving even in
June (the customary pilgrimage time),
and the circuit itself is physically strenu-
ous, with its highest point over 19,000
feet above sea level. Storms can suddenly
arise at any time of the year, and pil-
grims who are unprepared can easily die
of exposure. Given these difficulties, rel-
atively few people perform this pilgrim-
age; it raises the status of those who do.
For many years Chinese prohibitions on
travel in Tibet made it impossible for
people to undertake this pilgrimage.
Since the early 1990s these rules have
been relaxed and small groups of reli-
gious pilgrims are again making the
sacred journey.
Kailasanatha
The largest and most famous of the
rock-cut temples at Ellora in the state of
Maharashtra; the temple is dedicated to
the god Shiva in his form as the “Lord of
Mount Kailas.” The temple was con-
structed late in the eighth century by
kings of the Rashtrakuta dynasty and
completed during the reign of Krishna I.
The Kailasanatha temple is modeled
after other contemporary temples: its
main elements are an outer gateway, an
assembly hall, and a central shrine
(garbhagrha) surrounded by a proces-
sional path (pradakshina) to smaller
shrines. It is set on a high platform base
topped with a ninety-six-foot-high spire
representing Mount Kailas in the
Himalayas and covered with decorative
carving. The amazing point about this
temple is that the entire structure is a
sculpture—workers carved it out of a
single rock outcropping, starting at the
top and working down. It is estimated
that during construction, the builders
had to remove three million cubic feet of
stone from the temple and the excavated
courtyards surrounding it. See also
caves, artificial.
Kaitabha
In Hindu mythology, one of two demons
who attempt to kill the god Brahma (the
other is Madhu). The story is recounted
in several mythic sources, with some
important differences among them. All
versions agree that Madhu and Kaitabha
are born from the god Vishnu’s earwax
during the period of cosmic dissolution
(pralaya). As the creation of the world
begins, a lotus sprouts from Vishnu’s
navel. It opens to reveal the creator-god,
Brahma, who is immediately attacked
by Madhu and Kaitabha. In all versions
of the myth, Brahma appeals for help.
Vishnu tricks the demons (who are
strong but not too bright) and slays
them. The difference comes in the deity
to whom Brahma appeals for help. The
story first appears in the mythology of
Vishnu; here Brahma invokes that deity.
Yet this same story also appears in the
Devimahatmya, the earliest mythic
source for the cult of the Mother
Goddess as the supreme divine power.
In this version, Brahma’s hymn of praise
is to the Goddess, who in her form as
Yoganidra (“sleep of yoga”) has lulled
Vishnu into a cosmic stupor, rendering
him unable to come to Brahma’s aid.
Pleased by Brahma’s praise, the Goddess
withdraws her influence over Vishnu; he
awakens and slays the demons.
Kaivalya
(“isolation”) In Samkhya and Yoga, two
of the six schools of Hindu philosophy,
kaivalya is the state of final liberation. A
person who has attained kaivalya has
fully comprehended the difference
between two important principles: the
conscious but inert purusha, which is
identified as the Self, and the active but
[[331]]
Kajari Teej
unconscious prakrti. According to
Samkhya metaphysics, confusion
between these two eternally distinct
principles triggers the evolution of sub-
jective consciousness and the exterior
world, in which the eternal Self becomes
the witness to repeated rebirths. Of the
two schools, Samkhya provides the the-
oretical explanation for bondage and
liberation of the soul, whereas Yoga pro-
vides the method to liberation. The pur-
pose in performing yoga is to help the
person distinguish between these two
principles, removing obstructions to
understanding, particularly the karmic
tendencies rooted in egoism. According
to the Yoga Sutras, the foundational text
for the Yoga school, those who can dis-
tinguish between these two principles
and discern the soul’s identity with the
purusha attain independence from all
external causes, mastery over all states
of being, and omniscience. For further
information see Gerald Larson and Ram
Shankar Bhattacharya (eds.), Samkhya:
A Dualist Tradition in Indian
Philosophy, 1987; and Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore
(eds.), A Sourcebook in Indian
Philosophy, 1957.
Kajari Teej
One of two festivals called Teej. See Teej.
Kala
In Sanskrit and its daughter languages,
a word that can mean both “time” and
“death.” Kala is used as one of the alter-
nate names for the god Yama, the lord of
death and the master of all living beings.
Kalahasti
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh,
about fifty miles east of the town of
Tirupati and 125 miles northwest of the
city of Madras. Kalahasti is famous as
one of the bhutalingas (“elemental lin-
gas”), a network of five southern Indian
sites sacred to the god Shiva. At each of
these sites Shiva is worshiped as a linga,
[[332]]

the pillar-shaped object that is his
symbolic form, and at each site the
linga is believed to be formed from one
of the five primordial elements
(bhuta)—earth, wind, fire, water, and
space (akasha). Kalahasti’s linga is
associated with the element of wind,
and the manifestation of Shiva there is
Kalahasteshvar, the “Lord of Kalahasti.”
Kalahasti is also one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites throughout
the subcontinent that are sacred to the
Goddess. Each Shakti Pitha marks the
site where a body part of the dismem-
bered goddess Sati fell to earth, taking
form there as a different goddess; in the
case of Kalahasti the body part was Sati’s
left shoulder. Kalahasti’s sanctity is thus
reinforced by having two highly power-
ful and sacred sites to two different
deities. See also pitha.
Kalamukha
(“black face”) Extinct monastic sect
whose members were devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva and whose name may
refer to their practice of marking their
heads with a black streak. Little is
known about their doctrines or prac-
tices. While there are contemporary lit-
erary references to the Kapalikas,
another extinct Shaivite ascetic com-
munity, the only sources for the
Kalamukhas are a series of inscriptions.
From these inscriptions we know that
the Kalamukhas were strongest in the
Karnataka region, although they were
also present in other southern Indian
regions. They flourished between the
ninth and thirteenth centuries.
Kalasha
(“pitcher”) In the Nagara style of temple
architecture predominantly found in
northern India, the kalasha is an inverted
vase-shaped piece that crowns the tem-
ple towers (shikharas). In many cases,
kalashas were made of gold to provide a
decorative contrast above the stone. The
kalasha on the highest tower typically
has a banner fluttering from it. TheKali
architectural symbolism in Hindu
temples corresponds to the structure
of human body, so the kalashas stand
for the crown of the head, the highest
and purest part of the body. They are
also a symbol of the highest human
religious potential.
Kalhana
(12th c.) Kashmiri poet and author of the
Rajatarangini (“River of Kings”), a
poetic chronicle of the kings of
Kashmir. Kalhana’s chronicle is an
unusually descriptive and accurate his-
tory of Kashmir and its political, social,
and religious institutions. The text’s only
shortcoming is that it pays little atten-
tion to the outside world. Kalhana’s his-
torical emphasis is unusual for Indian
writers, and his chronicle is one of the
few indigenous Indian histories.
Kali
(“black”) Incomprehensibly fierce and
powerful divine form of the Mother
Goddess. Kali is the awful, uncon-
trolled power of the divine in its most
terrifying aspects. She is consistently
associated with images of blood, death,
and destruction; her dwelling place is
the cremation ground. Her iconogra-
phy portrays her as clothed with sev-
ered heads and limbs, and her form is
lean, gaunt, and haggard, with lolling
tongue and lips smeared with blood.
Paradoxically, millions of Kali’s devotees
(bhakta) refer to her as “mother.”
Kali’s roots are uncertain, but she is
generally assumed to be an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity. Her dark
color—associated with low social sta-
tus, her preference for dwelling in
inaccessible places, and her worship
by Indian aboriginal tribes and people
at the margins of society, all seem to
point to origins as a local goddess, per-
haps of tribal people. Some early
Sanskrit dramas, such as the poet
Bhavabhuti’s Malatimadhava , men-
tion fierce goddesses who received
offerings of blood from their devotees.
This same motif was a central element
in the stories about the Thugs in the
nineteenth century.
One of Kali’s earliest descriptions
comes in the Devimahatmya, the earliest
known source for the notion that God is
feminine. One of the Devimahatmya’s
episodes describes the birth of Kali (in
her form as Mahakali) as the anger of
the Goddess incarnate. In the story, Kali
first destroys the demon armies by stuff-
ing them into her mouth and eating
them whole, symbolizing her all-con-
suming power to destroy. Her other feat
in this text is the destruction of
Raktabija, a demon who receives the
boon that any drop of his blood that falls
to the earth will instantly turn into a
clone of him—a boon that renders him
practically unconquerable. Kali defeats
him by drinking his blood as it is shed
until it is completely gone. Both of these
episodes reinforce her image as a terrify-
ing and powerful goddess, her destruc-
tive capacity, and her associations with
substances and practices normally
considered to be defiling. As Kinsley
notes, Kali can also be seen as a sym-
bolic statement that human life is
uncertain and that tragedy and misfor-
tune can occur without warning, despite
the best-laid plans.
Worship of Kali has followed two
paths, one in agreement with these hor-
rific images and one in contradiction to
them. On one hand, Kali has been an
important deity for practitioners of the
secret, ritually-based religious practice
known as tantra. The tantras describe
reality as resulting from the interaction
between polar opposites, symbolized in
the deities of Shiva (consciousness) and
Shakti (“power”). Shiva provides the
ordering principle and is the Ultimate
Reality, but Shakti provides the energy
and dynamism that actually makes
things happen. Consequently, goddesses
take on an important role in tantric
practice. Among these goddesses Kali
stands preeminent, perhaps because
she is the most radical articulation of
feminine power and can thus be seen as
bringing the greatest power to bear on
[[333]]
Kali

that surround her: skulls, fire, her blood-smeared tongue, and severed heads and limbs.
[[334]]
Kalidasa
behalf of her devotees. Her power over
all things and Shiva’s helplessness with-
out this power is symbolized by the
images of Kali standing over the pros-
trate Shiva, clearly in a dominant posi-
tion. In this tradition, the tantric expert
is seen as a heroic figure who gains
power from the goddess.
The tantras also stress the reconcilia-
tion of opposites as a way to destroy all
conceptual dualism and affirm the ulti-
mate unity of the entire universe. To
carry this out, tantric rituals may
include practices involving substances
normally forbidden, such as the so-
called Panchamakara, or “Five
Forbidden Things,” as a way to affirm
the provisional nature of all judgments
of purity and impurity (ashaucha).
Again, Kali is the quintessential tantric
deity, since her iconography and
mythology involve things normally con-
sidered impure: drinking blood and
receiving animal sacrifices, living in the
cremation ground, and clothing herself
with severed limbs.
The other dominant image for the
worship of Kali is as a mother. This
image is preeminent in the Bengal
region, and has become widely estab-
lished there during the past few hun-
dred years. This image of Kali is rooted
in Indian images of motherhood, which
are greatly idealized in terms of a moth-
er’s devotion to her children. The central
belief is that if a devotee approaches Kali
as a submissive child, ready to take
whatever blows she gives, she will ulti-
mately turn her awesome forces toward
protecting her devotee. Kali’s most
famous devotees are the nineteenth-
century Bengali figures Ramprasad and
Ramakrishna; the former is famous for
a poem in which he states that there are
bad children but never a bad mother.
Religious adepts such as Ramprasad
and Ramakrishna have been able to
maintain this tension between Kali’s
horrific persona and her image as a
mother, but in popular devotion this
tension has been largely lost. Modern
images of Kali tend to sweeten or ignore
her horrific aspects, often portraying her
as young, beautiful, and almost benevo-
lent. For more information on Kali, see
David R. Kinsley, The Sword and the
Flute, 1975; and Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Kalibangan
Archeological site in the western state of
Rajasthan, a short distance from the
border with Pakistan. Kalibangan is one
of the cities of the Indus Valley
Civilization and is part of cluster of
cities in what many archaeologists
believe was the Saraswati River valley,
although at present the river disappears
into the desert. The site at Kalibangan is
nearly as large as the cities at Harappa,
Mohenjo-Daro, and Lothal. The city
plan is virtually identical to the others,
thus revealing the scope of this mysteri-
ous ancient culture.
Kalidasa
(5th c. ?) Generally considered the great-
est Sanskrit writer, noted both for his
command of the language and his ability
to evoke poetic emotion (rasa) in his
listeners. There is little definite informa-
tion about Kalidasa’s life; even the dates
of his birth and death have been widely
debated. According to legend, Kalidasa
was an illiterate village boy. As a joke he
was presented as a suitor for a learned
princess who had vowed that she would
only marry a man who could defeat her
in a silent debate—that is, a debate
using gestures instead of words.
Kalidasa “defeated” the princess
through coincidence and mutual mis-
understanding and became her hus-
band. When the princess discovered the
depths of Kalidasa’s ignorance, she
threw him out of the house, ordering
him not to return until he had become
educated. In desperation he went to a
temple of the goddess Kali and was
about to offer himself as a human sacri-
fice, when Kali appeared to him and
gave him absolute mastery of Sanskrit.
Upon his return, his wife is reported
to have asked him, “Have you gained
proficiency in [Sanskrit] speech?” (“Asti
[[335]]
Kalighat
kascit vagviseshatah?”). Kalidasa gave
his answer over time, using the three
words in his wife’s question as the first
words of his three greatest works—
Kumarasambhava , Meghaduta, and
Raghuvamsha. He is also the author of
the dramas Abhijnanashakuntala,
Vikramorvashiya, and the Malavikagnimitra.
These works reportedly gained him
the patronage of king Vikramaditya,
with whose court Kalidasa is
traditionally associated.
Legend also recounts that Kalidasa’s
miraculous gift of learning caused his
death. Since his wife had spurred his
search for learning, Kalidasa thought of
her as his guru or religious teacher. Out
of respect, he refused all sexual relations
with her. Enraged at his refusal, she
cursed him to meet his death at the
hands of a woman. Many years later, a
king composed a line of verse and
offered a large prize to the person who
could compose the best ending.
Kalidasa heard about this contest while
enjoying the company of a courtesan
and effortlessly composed the perfect
ending. In her greed for the prize, the
courtesan stabbed and killed Kalidasa.
Although her crime was discovered and
she was punished, this legend illustrates
the Hindu belief in the unstoppable
power of fate, particularly when driven
by a curse.
Kalighat
Temple dedicated to the goddess Kali in
the southern section of modern
Calcutta. This temple is several hundred
years old and is considered one of the
most important temples in Calcutta.
The city’s name is supposedly an
anglicized version of the temple’s name.
Local tradition claims that Kalighat
is one of the Shakti Pithas, a network
of sites sacred to the Goddess. Each
Shakti Pitha marks the site where a body
part of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess; in the case of
Kalighat the body part was one of Sati’s
toes. See also pitha.
[[336]]

Kalika Devi
Name of both a shrine in the Shiwalik
Hills (foothills of the Himalayas) and of
its presiding deity. Kalika Devi is one of
the nine Shiwalik goddesses and is
believed to be a form of the goddess
Kali. The temple itself is in the town of
Kalka, on the road between the cities of
Chandigarh and Simla. As is the
case with many of the other Shiwalik
goddesses, the image of Kalika Devi is a
natural stone outcropping. This is con-
sidered a self-manifested (svayambhu)
form of the Goddess. Unlike many of the
other Shiwalik goddesses, the Hindi lit-
erature on this shrine does not claim
that the temple is one of the Shakti
Pithas, a network of sites sacred to the
Goddess, mythically connected as
places where a body part of the dismem-
bered goddess Sati fell to earth. Instead,
the literature simply commends the
temple for its power and majesty. The
literature does note, however, that local
priests claim it as the place where Sati’s
hair fell to earth. This illustrates both the
influence that pamphlet literature can
have in channeling pilgrim traffic and
the need to tie one’s site into the net-
work of the Shakti Pithas.
The stone outcropping that forms
Kalika Devi’s image is considered to be
her head. According to tradition, Kali
took the form of a beautiful woman and
came to the temple to sing festive songs
during the festival of Navaratri. The
local monarch was so smitten by
her voice and beauty that he asked
her to marry him. Enraged at this insult,
Kali cursed the king to lose his kingdom.
As a further sign of her displeasure,
she caused the temple image to begin
sinking into the earth. At the plea of
an ardent devotee, she allowed the
head of the image to remain visible.
See also pitha.
Kalimath
(“Kali’s Dwelling”) Village and sacred
site (tirtha) in the Himalaya mountains
of Uttar Pradesh state. Kalimath is
located on a small tributary of theKaliya
Mandakini River about ten miles from
the village of Guptakashi; the
Mandakini is one of the Himalayan trib-
utaries that combine to create the
Ganges. According to local tradition,
Kalimath is one of the Shakti Pithas, a
network of sites sacred to the Goddess.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess. Local sources claim
that Kalimath is the place where Sati’s
vulva fell to earth. It took form there as
the goddess Kali, thus associating a
highly charged female body part with a
powerful and often dangerous form of
the Goddess. The temple’s image of the
Goddess is extremely unusual—a brass
plate a little more than a foot square,
whose center is cut out in a small trian-
gle, an aniconic symbol of the Goddess.
This plate supposedly covers a pit—
a clear symbol of the part of Sati’s body
which is supposed to have fallen
there—but the area under the plate
is deemed so sacred that looking under
it is forbidden.
The claim that Kalimath is the place
where Sati’s vulva fell to earth illustrates
the fluidity of the Indian sacred land-
scape. There is a much more widely
accepted tradition associating this spe-
cific body part with the temple of
Kamakhya in Assam. Such competing
claims are not uncommon in the Indian
sacred landscape, since people often
make these claims to enhance their par-
ticular site’s sanctity and prestige. It is
notable that many Hindus seem little
concerned with such apparent inconsis-
tencies, perhaps stemming from the
conviction that a single Goddess lies
behind all her individual manifesta-
tions. See also pitha.
Kalivarjya
The name for a collection of about fifty-
five acts “to be avoided in the Kali
[Age],” the last age in the cycle of cosmic
time after which it is believed the world
will be destroyed and recreated. This
was one of the strategies used by brahmin
scholars to forbid certain religious prac-
tices that were prescribed in the sacred
literature but were no longer acceptable
because of changing ideas. The
Kalivarjya prohibitions first appear in
texts around the twelfth century C.E.
Some of the practices considered
acceptable in earlier times but prohibited
during the Kali age include certain
animal sacrifices prescribed in the
Vedas (the earliest Hindu religious texts)
and suicide by a person suffering from a
terminal illness. For further information
see Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.), A
History of Dharmasastra, 1968.
Kaliya
In Hindu mythology, a thousand-headed
serpent who is defeated by the adoles-
cent god Krishna in one of the earliest
acts foreshadowing the god’s future
greatness. Kaliya has settled into a deep
pool in the Yamuna River, rendering the
pool and its surroundings uninhabitable
because of the noxious poison he
constantly emits. One day as Krishna
and his companions tend the cows,
Krishna decides to get rid of Kaliya.
Despite his friends’ pleas, Krishna
climbs to the top of a tall tree and dives
deep into the pool. A tremendous battle
ensues. Krishna finally subdues Kaliya
by dancing on his hoods, stamping each
of the serpent’s heads until blood runs
out of Kaliya’s mouths. Kaliya’s wives beg
Krishna to spare his life, and Krishna
grants this request but banishes him to a
more appropriate place. His mercy mir-
rors the Hindu world view that even
beings such as Kaliya have a rightful
place in the world. Although problems
arise when such beings are in the wrong
place, these can be corrected by sending
them to a more appropriate one. For fur-
ther elaboration of this idea, See John
Stratton Hawley, “Krishna’s Cosmic
Victories,” in Journal of the American
Academy of Religion, Vol. 47, No. 2, 1979.

Kali Yuga
not particularly precious, and whose
black color is associated with Saturn,
the malevolent planet. Kali Yuga is
considered the time when human
wickedness runs rampant, virtue
virtually disappears, and the world is
inexorably falling into ruin. Hindus
believe that the Kali Yuga began with the
commencement of the great war
described in the epic Mahabharata,
and not surprisingly, it is the age in
which we now live.
Kalka
Image of the god Vishnu’s Kalki avatar.
It is believed that Vishnu will appear in
this form at the end of the world.
Kali Yuga
A particular age of the world in one of
the reckonings of cosmic time.
According to traditional belief, time has
neither beginning nor end, but alter-
nates between cycles of creation and
activity, followed by cessation and qui-
etude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32
billion years, with the active phase
known as the Day of Brahma, and the
quiet phase as the Night of Brahma. In
one reckoning of cosmic time, the Day
of Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
yugas, the Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. Each of
these four yugas is shorter than its pre-
decessor and ushers in an era more
degenerate and depraved. By the end of
the Kali Yuga, things have gotten so bad
that the only solution is the destruction
and re-creation of the earth, at which
time the next Krta era begins.
Kali Yuga is the last of the four yugas,
lasting for “only” 432,000 years. It is
also considered to be the most
degenerate yuga, symbolized by its
identification with iron—a metal that is
sometimes useful, sometimes harmful,
[[338]]

Town in the Ambala district of the state
of Haryana, about ten miles north and
east of Chandigarh. Kalka is famous as
the site of the temple of Kalika Devi,
who is considered to be a form of the
goddess Kali and is one of the nine
Shiwalik goddesses.
Kalki Avatar
The tenth avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu, and the only one of these
incarnations who has not yet appeared.
In traditional art, Kalki is portrayed as
riding a white horse and brandishing a
sword. It is believed that he will come at
a time when the state of the world has
completely degenerated. His arrival will
signal its imminent destruction; his pur-
pose will be to purify the world by
destroying the wicked.
Kalpa
The largest unit of cosmic time, equiv-
alent to 4.32 billion years. According to
one concept, the kalpa is broken up
into one thousand mahayugas, each
lasting 4.32 million years. The kalpa, or
Day of Brahma, is the longest con-
ceived measure of time and is used to
determine the duration of the uni-
verse. After the kalpa is complete, it is
followed by an equally long “Night of
Brahma,” a period of universal disso-
lution (pralaya).Kalpavas
KalpaKalpataru
(2) (“proper,” “fit”) One of the six
Vedangas, auxiliary branches of knowl-
edge connected with the Vedas, the old-
est Hindu religious texts. The Kalpa
section prescribes the rites connected
with the Vedic rituals and gives rules for
performing ceremonial and sacrificial
acts. The other Vedangas are vyakarana
(Sanskrit grammar), chandas (Sanskrit
prosody), nirukta (etymology), shiksha
(correct pronunciation), and jyotisha
(auspicious times for sacrifices).(“wishing-tree”) Extensive collection of
writings on matters relating to religious
law, compiled by the scholar
Lakshmidhara in the middle of the
twelfth century. The Kalpataru is one of
the earliest examples of commentarial
literature known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”). The nibandhas were collections
of Hindu lore, in which the compilers
drew references on a particular theme
from the Vedas, dharma literature,
puranas, and other authoritative reli-
gious texts. Then they compiled these
excerpts into a single volume. Each of
the Kalpataru’s fourteen volumes is
devoted to a particular aspect of Hindu
religious life, including daily practice,
worship, gift-giving (dana), vows, pil-
grimage, penances (prayashchitta),
purification, and final liberation of the
soul (moksha). As one of the earliest
nibandhas, the Kalpataru formed
a model for later writers and was also
an important resource for them.
Lakshmidhara’s writing is unusual
because he used very few sources for his
work—primarily the epic Mahabharata
and a few of the sectarian collections
known as puranas. Unlike later
commentators, he does not cite the
Vedas, the earliest Hindu religious texts,
or the prescriptions found in the dharma
literature. His text also consists mostly
of these excerpted passages with very
little commentary of his own, whereas
later nibandha writers often give
voluminous explanations.
Kalpa Sutras
(“aphorisms on sacred law”) An impor-
tant class of smrti or “remembered [lit-
erature].” The Kalpa Sutras were first
composed around the sixth century
B.C.E. The sutras were collected to pro-
vide a unified religious and legal world-
view. According to the general scholarly
consensus, the theory used to associate
these sutras imposed an appearance of
conceptual order on what was more
likely an organic development of Hindu
religious law. The Kalpa Sutras are all
attributed to famous sages. In theory
each Kalpa Sutra contains three sepa-
rate parts: prescriptions for Vedic rituals
(Shrauta Sutras), prescriptions for
domestic rites (Grhya Sutras), and pre-
scriptions for appropriate human
behavior (Dharma Sutras). The real pic-
ture is far more complex since only three
sutras contain all three parts and are
attributed to a single author. The three
surviving Kalpa Sutras are attributed to
the sages Apastamba, Baudhayana, and
Hiranyakeshin and are all associated
with the same school, the Black Yajur
Veda. There are many other collections
that have one or another of these parts,
but not all three. Each of the Kalpa
Sutras is also theoretically connected
with one of the four Vedas, the earliest
Hindu religious texts. However, it is likely
that this claim was made to give author-
ity to the collection.
Kalpavas
(“residence for a kalpa”) Strict religious
vow taken during the annual Magh
Mela festival in the city of Allahabad
during the lunar month of Magh
(January–February). Allahabad is locat-
ed at the confluence of two sacred
rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna.
The festival’s primary religious act is
bathing (snana) at this confluence.
Although most people stay at this festi-
val only a brief time, kalpavasis, or peo-
ple taking the kalpavas vow, do not leave
[[339]]
Kalpeshvar
the site of the festival for the entire
month. Kalpavasis also take vows to live
a strict ascetic lifestyle, which includes
daily baths in the Ganges, a restricted
diet, particular dress and worship, and
attendance at the religious gatherings
known as satsang.boundaries of righteous action, or
dharma, desires and their satisfaction
are recognized as a normal, acceptable
part of life. It is when this governing
force is absent that the search
for pleasure becomes inappropriate
and destabilizing.
KalpeshvarKama
Temple and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Garhwal region of the Himalayas, about
ten miles down the Alakananda River
from Joshimath. The temple’s presiding
deity is the god Shiva in his manifesta-
tion as Kalpeshvar, the “Lord of the
Cosmic Age.” The Kalpeshvar temple is
one of the Panchkedar, a network of five
sites in the Garhwal region that are
sacred to Shiva; the other four sites are
Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath, and
Madmaheshvar. Shiva is believed to
dwell in the Himalayas. This network of
five sites is seen as a symbolic represen-
tation of his body. Kalpeshvar represents
Shiva’s matted locks (jatas).(2) Minor deity identified as the person-
ification of kama (“desire”). Kama is
comparable to the Greek deity Eros and
carries similar responsibility for igniting
human sexual attraction and sensual
desire. Kama is represented as a young
man riding on a parrot, armed with a
bow and arrows. The bow is a stalk of
sugar cane, the bowstring a line of
buzzing bees; his five arrows are five dif-
ferent flowers, each bringing a different
emotional effect to the person it pierces.
The five flowers and emotions are: lotus,
infatuation; ashoka, intoxication (with
love); mango, exhaustion; jasmine, pin-
ing; blue lotus, paralysis. Kama’s icono-
graphy carries strong associations with
spring, and the spring season (personi-
fied as another minor deity, Vasant) is
perceived as Kama’s friend and ally in
awakening desire through the regenera-
tion of the natural world and the showy
display of spring blossoms.
The most famous episode in Kama’s
mythology begins with the ascent to
power of a demon named Taraka, who
can only be killed by a son of Shiva.
Taraka seems impossible to defeat, since
Shiva has no sons and is in deep medita-
tion, grieving over the death of his wife
Sati. The other gods ask Kama to shoot
Shiva with an arrow of desire so he will
marry the goddess Parvati and produce
a son. Kama creeps up on Shiva and
shoots him with an arrow. When Shiva
realizes who has disturbed his medita-
tion, he releases a stream of fire from the
third eye in the middle of his forehead,
instantly burning Kama to ashes.
Through Shiva’s grace, Kama is eventu-
ally brought back to life. One of Kama’s
epithets or alternate names is Ananga,
or “bodiless,” because of the loss of his
Kalyanamandapam
(“marriage hall”) One of the common
architectural features of southern
Indian temples built in the Dravida
style. The kalyanamandapam is a hall
where the images of the temple’s primary
deity and that deity’s spouse could be
ceremonially united on festival days to
symbolize their married state.
Kama
In Indian philosophy, one of the four
purusharthas, or aims of life, with
the others being artha (wealth,
power, and prosperity), dharma
(righteousness), and moksha (libera-
tion). The most basic meaning of
kama is “desire,” with strong overtones
of sexual desire, but kama can also
refer to all types of attraction, including
aesthetic pleasure from the arts. The
most famous treatise on the fulfillment
of kama is the Kama Sutra , which
details the satisfaction of sexual
desires. When pursued within the
[[340]]
Kamakotipith
body (and the fact that desire seems to
strike in unseen ways). Despite being
destroyed by Shiva and seemingly foiled,
in the end Kama achieves his goal. His
attempt to draw Shiva out of his medita-
tion succeeds, and eventually Shiva
marries Parvati. For more information
on the interplay between Shiva and
Kama, see Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty,
Siva, 1981.
Kamada Ekadashi
Ekadashi, or eleventh-day, festival of
the bright, waxing half of the lunar
month of Chaitra (March–April). Most
Hindu festivals have certain prescribed
rites usually involving fasting (upavasa)
and worship, and often promise-specific
benefits for faithful performance. As
promised by its name (“wish-granting”),
faithfully observing this festival will
fulfill one’s desire (kama), whatever it
may be.
Kamadhenu
In Hindu mythology, a goddess in the
form of a cow (dhenu) who has the
power to grant all one’s wishes (kama).
The Kamadhenu is considered the
mother of all cattle. She is associated
with giving gifts of food, and thus is an
extension of the gifts of food given by all
cows. In Hindu mythology, Kamadhenu
is the property of the sage Jamadagni.
Her theft by a local king prompts Jama-
dagni’s son, Parashuram avatar, to circle
the earth twenty-one times, in an attempt
to wipe out the kshatriya (kingly) class.
Kamakhya
(“desiring eyes”) A particular manifesta-
tion of the Mother Goddess, whose tem-
ple on Nilachal Hill overlooks the
Brahmaputra River just outside the city
of Guwahati in Assam. This temple is
one of the Shakti Pithas, a network of
sites that spreads throughout the sub-
continent and is sacred to the Goddess.
Each Shakti Pitha marks the site where a
body part of the dismembered goddess
Sati fell to earth, taking form there as a
different goddess. The Kamakhya tem-
ple is the place where Sati’s vulva fell to
earth. Its image of the goddess is a nat-
ural cleft in the rock, around which the
temple has been built. Since Kamakhya
sprang from the most sexually charged
part of the female body, it is no surprise
that she is believed to be extremely pow-
erful. Like many powerful goddesses,
her productive capacity must be con-
stantly recharged through receiving sac-
rifices, especially the blood of living
beings. In modern times the usual sacri-
fice is a goat, but in earlier times the
offering of human sacrifices is well
documented. Kamakhya was reportedly
offered 140 men when her present tem-
ple was consecrated in 1565. This prac-
tice continued until the British halted it
in 1832. The men offered as human sac-
rifices were reportedly volunteers who
believed that they had been called by
her to do this. In the time between
announcing their intention to be sacri-
ficed and their deaths, they were treated
as virtual divinities, since they were con-
sidered to have been consecrated to the
goddess. For further information see
George Weston Briggs, Gorakhnath and
the Kanphata Yogis, 1973. See also pitha.
Kamakotipith
An important center for the Dashanami
sect of Sanyasi ascetics, located in the
southern Indian city of Kanchipuram.
According to local tradition, the
Kamakotipith was the first and most
important of the maths or monastic
centers, established by the philosopher
Shankaracharya, who later established
four other centers at Joshimath, Puri,
Shringeri, and Dwaraka. This claim to
primacy has generated fierce controversy.
Opponents who support one of the
other four maths, not only deny
Kamakotipith’s place as the first of the
maths, but also assert that Kamakotipith
is only a branch of the Shringeri math.
Support for these claims can be drawn
from the symbolism connected with the
number four—the four cardinal direc-
tions, the four sacred texts known as
[[341]]
Kamalakanta
Vedas, and the four organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis
themselves. The number four symbol-
izes completion and totality, which
makes a fifth sacred center problem-
atic. Despite their possible merit,
these contentions have not diminished
Kamakotipith’s status. It has a long his-
tory as an ascetic center, and its head
monk is routinely considered one of the
Shankaracharyas, the most important
modern Hindu religious leaders.
Kamakotipith’s importance probably
reflects the importance of Kanchipuram
itself, which was such a significant
sacred and political hub that any ascetic
center located there could gain consid-
erable authority.
Kamalakanta
(d. 1820) Bengali poet, devotee (bhakta)
of the goddess Kali, and teacher and
practitioner of the secret, ritually-based
religious practice known as tantra.
Kamalakanta spent most of his life as
the guru and learned adviser (pundit) of
the king of Burdwan, a region northwest
of modern Calcutta, whose capital is
also named Burdwan.
Kamandalu
A water pot traditionally used by
ascetics, usually having a removable lid
for ease in filling and a spout for pour-
ing. Kamandalus may be made from
various materials, such as gourds, wood,
metal, or baked clay. They are generally
wider than they are tall, making them
stable and less likely to tip over. In
India’s climate, water is an obvious
necessity. Even ascetics with very few
possessions will generally have some
means to carry and store it. Aside from
satisfying their physical needs, water is
an important element in ascetic reli-
gious life, since it is often an offering
used in worship as well as the preferred
medium for bathing (snana) and other
rites of purification. This religious
importance makes the kamandalu a
powerful object in its own right. A
[[342]]

kamandalu is considered especially sig-
nificant when it has been used for years
by a noted ascetic—objects kept in close
proximity to such a person are believed
to be charged with their spiritual power.
In modern times, kamandalus are still
important ritual objects, but their prac-
tical function has largely been replaced
by screw-top plastic vessels.
Kama Sutra
(“manual on desire”) By far the most
famous of the ancient erotic manuals,
traditionally attributed to the sage
Vatsyayana. This text is usually associated
with an exhaustive catalog of sexual
positions and pleasures, but in fact it
goes far beyond this stereotype.
Vatsyayana was interested in exploring
desire in all its manifestations. The text
begins with a consideration of the four
aims of life (purushartha): worldly
goods (artha), desire (kama), religious
duty (dharma), and liberation of the
soul (moksha). Vatsyayana argued that
since desire was one of the established
goals of human life, its pursuit was thus
a good thing, as long as this pursuit did
not interfere with the others.
Having established the legitimacy of
desire, Vatsyayana then discussed how
to foster it. The Kama Sutra’s second
book contains the text’s best-known
material, the discussion and categoriza-
tion of various types of sexual union. It
begins by characterizing types of sexual
endowment, both male and female.
Next it describes different sorts of
embracing, kissing, scratching, and bit-
ing as symbols of passion, along with
sexual positions and oral sex. This is fol-
lowed by chapters on gaining a wife,
attracting other men’s wives (which the
text discourages, except in cases where
one’s passion is “too strong”), courte-
sans, and general remarks on the nature
of attraction.
The text is a manual for all phases of
erotic life in which sex can be refined
into a vehicle for aesthetic experience as
well as pure carnal pleasure. The Kama
Sutra is also notable for its perspectiveKamika Ekadashi
on women, who are seen as having
equal sexual desire and gaining equal
pleasure. The ultimate aim is the sexual
satisfaction of both partners, rather than
one partner simply serving the other.
The Kama Sutra has been translated
many times.
Kamavasayitvam
(“suppression of desire”) One of the
eight superhuman powers (siddhi), tra-
ditionally believed to be conferred by
high spiritual attainment. This power
gives one the ability to control desires. It
also means that any declaration one
makes, such as pronouncing a blessing
(ashirvad) or a curse, will inevitably
come to pass. The basis for this latter
power seems to stem from the absence
of individual desire in such a person,
meaning that person will never be moti-
vated by self-interest. This power
reflects the pan-Indian belief that by
renouncing everything, one can eventu-
ally gain power over everything.
Kamban
(9th c.) Southern Indian poet most
noted as the author of the Tamil-
language version of the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Hindu epics.
Kamban’s text is known as the Kamba
Ramayana, and remains popular in
modern times. As with all vernacular
translations of the Ramayana, Kamban
did not simply translate Valmiki’s
Sanskrit epic from Sanskrit to a more
common language, but adapted and
even added to it as he saw fit. Of partic-
ular interest is his heroic portrayal of the
demon-king Ravana, who is the villain
in the original story. This shift may
reflect feelings of regional pride, since
Kamban was a southern Indian and
Ravana’s kingdom of Lanka is generally
identified as the island of Sri Lanka in
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the
Indian mainland.
A kamandalu is used to hold water
for use in religious rites.
Kamba Ramayana
Tamil language version of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two great
Hindu epics. The Kamba Ramayana was
written in ninth century by the southern
Indian poet Kamban. As with all vernac-
ular renditions of the Ramayana,
Kamban did not simply translate
Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic, but adapted
and added to it as he saw fit. Of particu-
lar interest is his heroic portrayal of
Ravana, the demon-king, who is the vil-
lain in the original story. This shift may
reflect feelings of regional pride, since
Kamban was from southern Indian.
Ravana’s kingdom of Lanka is generally
identified as the island of Sri Lanka in
the Indian Ocean, southeast of the
Indian mainland.
Kamika Ekadashi
Festival falling on the eleventh day
(ekadashi) of the dark, waxing half of
the lunar month of Shravan
(July–August). As with all eleventh-day
observances, Kamika Ekadashi is
[[343]]
Kamsa
dedicated to the worship of Vishnu.
Most Hindu festivals have certain
prescribed rites usually involving fasting
(upavasa) and worship, and often
promise specific benefits for faithful
performance. The name Kamika means
“desiring,” a theme supported by the
charter myth. According to this story,
the brahmins in a certain village
refuse to perform religious rites for a
landowner guilty of murdering another
brahmin. The landowner is freed from
that sin by observing the Kamika
Ekadashi and is thus able to have the
desired rites performed.
Kamsa
In Hindu mythology, the wicked king of
Mathura who is considered the brother of
Devaki, the god Krishna’s mother, and
thus Krishna’s uncle. According to leg-
end, Kamsa is born when a demon takes
the form of Ugrasena, Devaki’s father,
and under this guise has intercourse
with Kamsa’s mother.
On Devaki’s wedding day, a divine
voice warns Kamsa that his sister’s
eighth child will eventually kill him. In
an effort to prevent this prophecy, he
kills all of Devaki’s children as soon as
they are born. Yet on the night Krishna
is born, a deep sleep falls over the
inhabitants of the palace, the locked
doors magically open, and the infant is
spirited away to the home of his foster
parents, Nanda and Yashoda. When
Kamsa finds out what has happened,
he first sends his men to kill all the
newborn children in the country. When
that attempt fails to destroy Krishna,
Kamsa sends various demon assassins,
such as Putana, Shakata, Trnavarta,
Keshi, and Bakasur. Krishna dispatches
all of these with ease, and Kamsa even-
tually has to try other strategies. He
announces a grand festival and dis-
patches his chariot to pick up Krishna
and his brother Balarama, who by
then have grown into adolescents.
Kamsa’s plan is to lure the brothers to
the festival grounds where they can be
killed in a “friendly” match with some
[[344]]

experienced wrestlers. The two boys
derail this plot by killing the wrestlers,
after which Krishna leaps up into the
royal box and kills Kamsa as well.
Kamya Karma
(“desiderative [ritual] action”) One of
three general categories of ritual action,
the others being nitya karma and
naimittika karma. Kamya karma is a rit-
ual performed solely for the performer’s
desire (kama) to obtain the benefits of
this action. Unlike the other two cate-
gories, which must be performed at spe-
cific times or occasions, this one is
completely voluntary and based solely
on the desire for its benefits. One exam-
ple of a kamya karma is religious pil-
grimage, which one is not required to do
but which is believed to generate reli-
gious merit. Another example would be
performing a particular vrat, or religious
vow, which might be done daily, weekly,
monthly, or yearly.
Kanada
(2nd c. B.C.E.?) Philosopher who is tradi-
tionally named as the author of the
Vaisheshika Sutras and founder of the
Vaisheshika philosophical school, one of
six schools of Hindu philosophy.
Kanada’s date is uncertain, but he is
believed to have lived after the third
century B.C.E. In its earliest form, the
Vaisheshika school followed a doctrine
of atomism, asserting that there are sim-
ple building blocks that cohere to form
complex objects. This cohesion also
attaches objects to their qualities. As
Vaisheshika combined with the Nyaya
school, another of the six schools, the
Vaisheshikas gradually adopted the
Nyaya idea of God as the regulating
force behind these atomic relations.
Kanauj
Small city on the Ganges River, about
fifty miles upstream from the city of
Kanpur. Kanauj is now insignificant, but
the city, formerly known as Kanyakubja,
was once one of the most important inKanchipuram
northern India. Its existence is docu-
mented as early as the sixth century
B.C.E. The city was an important stop on
the trade route running through the
Ganges basin. It is referenced in
Ptolemy’s Geography, written around
[[150]]
 C.E. Kanauj was also an important
political center; in the early seventh
century it was the capital of the
Pushyabhuti dynasty, ruled by the
emperor Harsha. In later centuries the
Pala, Rashtrakuta, and Gurjara-
Pratihara dynasties fought over the city,
with the Gurjara-Pratihara eventually
gaining control. After suffering an attack
by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1017 C.E.,
Kanauj seems to have gone into perma-
nent decline. Its modern legacy is being
the location of the dominant branch of
brahmins in the Gangetic Plain. They
call themselves Kanaujia brahmins.
Kanaujia
One of the five northern brahmin com-
munities (Pancha Gauda); the other
four are Gauda, Maithila, Utkala, and
Saraswat. Kanaujia brahmins trace their
origin to the city of Kanauj. Kanaujia
brahmins are found in greatest density
in the eastern section of the state of
Uttar Pradesh, near the city of Kanauj;
subgroups can be found throughout
Bihar, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and
the inland regions of Orissa.
Kanchipuram
Temple-town and sacred site (tirtha)
about forty miles southwest of the city of
Madras in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Kanchipuram is important as one of
India’s Seven Sacred Cities. Dying in
one of these cities is believed to bring
final liberation of the soul (moksha).
At differing times Kanchipuram served
as a capital for the Pallava, Chola,
and Vijayanagar kings; each of these
dynasties left its mark in the city’s
architecture. Kanchipuram is filled
with
temples,
many
of
them
magnificent examples of the southern
Indian Dravida architectural style.
Kanchipuram’s importance as a political
center and its concentration of temples,
brahmins, and scholars made it one of
the greatest centers of Hindu life, learn-
ing, and religion.
Kanchipuram is also noted for its
temples to each of the three major
Hindu deities—Vishnu, Shiva, and the
Goddess. The Vaikuntaperumal Temple
is dedicated to Vishnu in his form as
“Lord of Vaikuntha,” his celestial realm.
The Goddess is worshiped as Kamakshi
(“desiring eyes”). Kamakshi is identified
with the goddess Kamakhya, whose
temple in Assam is the most powerful of
all the Shakti Pithas.
Shiva
is
worshiped
at
the
Kailasanatha temple, in his manifesta-
tion as the “Lord of Mt. Kailas,” and at
the Ekambareshvar temple. The image
of Shiva at the former site is one of the
bhutalingas (“elemental lingas”), a net-
work of five southern Indian sites sacred
to the god Shiva. In each of these sites
Shiva is worshiped as a linga, the pillar-
shaped object that is his symbolic form.
At each site the linga is believed to be
formed from one of the five primordial
elements (bhuta)—earth, wind, fire,
water, and space (akasha). The
Kanchipuram linga is associated with
the element of earth, the humblest but
most essential of all.
Another reason for Kanchipuram’s
prominence is its long tradition as a
center for asceticism. Kanchipuram’s
Kamakotipith is an ancient center for
the Dashanami sect. Its leader is consid-
ered to be one of the Shankaracharyas,
the most important contemporary
Hindu leaders. According to local tradi-
tion the Kamakotipith was the first and
most important of the maths, or monas-
tic centers, established by the philoso-
pher Shankaracharya, who later
established four other centers at
Joshimath, Puri, Shringeri, and
Dwaraka. This claim to primacy has
generated fierce controversy, with oppo-
nents not only denying Kamakotipith’s
place as the first of the maths, but also
asserting that Kamakotipith is only a
branch of the Shringeri math. Some

Kandariya Mahadev
constructed at the end of the wave of cre-
ativity that produced all of the Khajuraho
temples. It is the best-developed example
of the Khajuraho branch of the Nagara
architectural style, in which all of the
temple’s smaller towers lead to and cul-
minate in one central tower directly
over the sanctuary. Like most of the
temples at Khajuraho, the Kandariya
Mahadev temple is covered with erotic
sculpture—perhaps as a symbol for
union with the divine, perhaps as a reli-
gious affirmation of every aspect of
human existence.
Kandarpa
Epithet of the god Kama, a minor deity
identified as the personification of kama
(“desire”) who is comparable to the
Greek deity Eros. See Kama.
Kangra
Vaikuntaperumal Temple in Kanchipuram.
support for these claims can be drawn
from symbolism connected with the
number four—the four cardinal direc-
tions, the four sacred texts known as
Vedas, and the four organizational
groups of the Dashanami Sanyasis
themselves. The number four symbol-
izes completion and totality, which
makes a fifth sacred center problematic.
Kamakotipith reflects the importance of
Kanchipuram as a significant sacred and
political hub in which any ascetic center
could gain considerable authority. See
also pitha.
The name of a town and district in the
state of Himachal Pradesh; the town
was formerly the capital of a small hill
kingdom with the same name. Kangra is
famous for the temple of Vajreshvari
Devi, one of the nine Shiwalik goddesses.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, Kangra’s status as a courtly
center brought in patronage for the
Pahari school of miniature painting.
Kanha
Epithet of the god Krishna. The name
Kanha is actually a form of the name
Krishna, modified in the transition
between Sanskrit and vernacular lan-
guage. See Krishna.
Kandariya Mahadev
The largest of the temples at Khajuraho
in the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is
dedicated to the god Shiva in his mani-
festation as “Skanda’s Lord”; Skanda is
another deity who is considered to be
Shiva’s son, and the general of Shiva’s
army. The Kandariya Mahadev temple
was built by the kings of the Chandella
dynasty between 1025 and 1050. It was

Kanhaiya
Epithet of the god Krishna. As with
the name Kanha, Kanhaiya is actually
a form of the name Krishna that
has been modified in the transition
between Sanskrit and vernacular lan-
guage. See Krishna.Kanyadan
Kankhal
City and sacred site (tirtha) three miles
south of the city of Haridwar in the state
of Uttar Pradesh. Kankhal is most
famous for the Daksha Mahadev tem-
ple, dedicated to the god Shiva in his
form as “Daksha’s Lord.” This temple’s
charter myth is one of the most famous
of all the stories of Shiva. Daksha is one
of the sons of the god Brahma and the
father of Sati, the goddess whom
Daksha gives in marriage to Shiva. When
Daksha feels that Shiva has not shown
him proper respect, he plans a great sac-
rifice to which he invites all the gods,
but purposely excludes Shiva. When Sati
asks why her husband has been excluded,
Daksha responds with a stream of
abuse, denouncing Shiva as worthless
and despicable. Humiliated, Sati com-
mits suicide. Shiva is furious when he
hears of Sati’s death, and in his rage cre-
ates the fierce deities Virabhadra and
Bhadrakali. He then comes storming
with his minions (gana) to the sacrificial
ground, completely destroying the sac-
rifice, and cuts off Daksha’s head.
Daksha is eventually restored to life,
repents his foolish pride, and asks Shiva
to remain at that site forever, which he
agrees to do.
There are numerous smaller temples
near the Daksha Mahadev temple, some
of which are dedicated to figures associ-
ated with this story, such as Virabhadra.
Across the street from the Daksha tem-
ple is a large ashram, or religious com-
munity, built by devotees (bhakta) of
the Bengali mystic Anandamayi Ma.
The ashram also contains her samadhi
shrine, or burial place.
Kannada
One of the four Dravidian languages,
along with Tamil, Telegu, and
Malayalam; all four languages are spo-
ken in southern India. Kannada is the
predominant language in modern
Karnataka, one of the “linguistic” states,
formed after Indian independence in
[[1947]]
 to unite people with a common
language and culture under one state
government. Despite its recent political
significance, Kannada has a long history
as a literary and cultural language and is
particularly important as the language
for the devotional (bhakti) poetry of the
Lingayat religious community. See also
Tamil language.
Kanphata
(“split ear”) Colloquial name for the
Nathpanthi sect of ascetics, who are
followers of the sage Gorakhnath.
This particular name stems from the
Nathpanthi’s
most
characteristic
feature: When a Nathpanthi ascetic
is ready for final initiation, the cartilage
in his ears is slit with a razor to insert
the large earrings by which members
of this group are easily identified.
See Nathpanthi.
Kanvar
A bamboo pole with baskets or recepta-
cles suspended from each end. In earlier
times a kanvar would have been a natural
way for people to carry heavy loads. Its
major use today is for religious rites in
which pilgrims carry water from one
place to offer to a deity in another. The
kanvar is the device by which the water
is kept elevated the entire way. This
keeps the water’s original purity unbro-
ken, preserving it as an appropriate
offering for a deity. The most famous
example of this rite is at the temple of
Vaidyanath in the state of Bihar. It is
also found at temples in Haridwar in
Uttar Pradesh, Tarakeshvar in West
Bengal, and the hills of Maharashtra.
Kanyadan
(“gift of a virgin”) In its most specific
sense, the kanyadan is the part of the
traditional wedding ceremony in which
the bride’s father (or guardian) formally
transfers her to her husband’s family. In
a more general sense, the word refers to
giving a daughter in marriage to another
family. This “gift” is believed to be highly
commendable for the father, since the
bride is supposed to be given without
[[347]]

asking for anything in return. At the
same time, the status difference
between the bride’s family (as wife
“givers”) and the groom’s (as wife “tak-
ers”) can make this “gift” an extremely
expensive proposition for the bride’s
family. See Dowry.
Kanyakubja
(“[city of ] humpbacked maidens”)
Ancient name for the site now known as
Kanauj, which was the capital for several
northern Indian dynasties in the latter
half of the first millennium. The name
Kanyakubja comes from a tale about a
king who has a hundred daughters. One
day the daughters’ games disturb the
meditation of a local sage who is filled
with desire for them. The king worries
about angering the sage and promises
him one of his daughters in marriage.
Ninety-nine of his daughters flatly
refuse to marry the sage because of his
advanced age and gruff demeanor, but
the youngest agrees to do so in obedi-
ence to her father. The sage accepts the
youngest daughter and curses the others
to become humpbacked so they will
never be able to marry.
[[348]]

Kanyakumari
(“virgin girl”) City and sacred site
(tirtha) at the extreme southern edge of
the state of Tamil Nadu, at the conflu-
ence of the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea,
and Bay of Bengal. Kanyakumari is
important as a bathing (snana) place.
Kanyakumari is also the name of the
site’s major deity, a local goddess who
has been assimilated into the pantheon
as a manifestation of the goddess
Parvati. According to local tradition,
Kanyakumari set her heart on marrying
Shiva; when this was prevented she
vowed to remain a perpetual virgin
(kanya). Her manifestation here is clearly
different from all the other forms of
Parvati, who are invariably married to
Shiva, yet Kanyakumari’s unmarried sta-
tus also gives her independent power.
Kapala
A human skull. In Hindu art, a skull is
often carried by the god Shiva, who uses
it as a vessel to hold his food and drink.
As with many of Shiva’s attributes, such
as the snakes he wears as jewelry and
the ash from the cremation ground with
which he smears his body, the skull-
bowl is a sign of Shiva’s untamed natureKapalin
and his aloofness from the standards
and concerns of everyday life. Use of a
skull-bowl has also been adopted by
some Shaiva ascetics, both past and
present, in imitation of this myth. The
skulls are usually taken from cremation
grounds; the upper skull is separated to
be made into a bowl.
Kapalamochana
(“releasing the skull”) Bathing (snana)
tank and sacred site (tirtha) in the
northern section of the city of Benares.
According to Hindu mythology, when
the wrathful deity Bhairava cuts off the
fifth head of the god Brahma, insulting
the god Shiva, the skull sticks to
Bhairava’s hand as a visible sign of his
crime. Bhairava visits all the holy places
of the earth trying to get rid of the skull,
but to no avail. When he arrives in
Kapalamochana, the skull spontaneously
drops from his hand, liberating
him from his crime. This act indicates
that Kapalamochana is the holiest
place on earth.
Kapalika
Extinct monastic sect of Shaivite
ascetics, or devotees (bhakta) of the god
Shiva. Although none of the Kapalikas’
own written records have survived,
there are numerous descriptions of
them by other ascetic groups and by
dramatists of their time such as Bana
(7th c.) and Bhavabhuti (8th c.). The
sources describe the Kapalikas as wor-
shiping the god Shiva in his wrathful
form as Bhairava and as emulating
Bhairava’s characteristics: wearing their
hair long and matted, smearing their
bodies with ash (preferably from the
cremation ground), and carrying a club
and a skull-bowl (kapala). The Kapalikas
are cited as indulging in forbidden
behavior—drinking wine, eating meat,
using cannabis and other drugs,
performing human sacrifice, and
enjoying orgiastic sexuality. Needless to
say, most of the available sources do not
approve of them.
David Lorenzen argues that despite
the disapproval of their contemporaries,
all the Kapalika practices must be seen
in the context of tantra. Tantra is a
secret, ritually-based religious practice
that its initiates believe is far more pow-
erful and effective than ordinary reli-
gious worship. One of its most essential
themes is the ultimate unity of every-
thing that exists. From a tantric perspec-
tive, to affirm that the entire universe is
one principle—often, conceived as the
activity of a particular deity—means
that the adept must reject all concepts
based on dualistic thinking. One way to
do this is to partake of the “Five
Forbidden Things” (panchamakara),
consciously breaking societal norms
forbidding
illicit
sexuality
and
consumption of intoxicants and non-
vegetarian food. This is always done
within a carefully defined ritual setting,
in a conscious effort to sacralize what is
normally forbidden.
Seen in this context, the Kapalikas’
behavior is shocking but becomes more
understandable. Lorenzen also specu-
lates that in performing such behaviors
(which may have only taken place dur-
ing religious ceremonies), the Kapalikas
were identifying themselves with their
chosen deity, Bhairava. In the Hindu
pantheon Bhairava is known for his
uncontrolled excesses, particularly for
cutting off one of the heads of the god
Brahma, for which he has to perform
severe penances (prayashchitta). In this
understanding, the Kapalikas’ practices
are not motivated by hedonistic self-
gratification but by the desire to imitate
their chosen deity. The only developed
source on the Kapalikas is David
Lorenzen, The Kapalikas and the
Kalamukhas, 1972.
Kapalin
(“skull-bearer”) The name for any
ascetic bearing a human skull, either as
a begging bowl or as a piece of ascetic
paraphernalia. Such ascetics are devo-
tees (bhakta) of the god Shiva in his ter-
rible form. Their use of the skull is a
[[349]]
Kapha
symbol that, like Shiva, they have
transcended all earthly concerns of
purity, impurity (ashaucha), and
conventional standards of what is and is
not appropriate.
Kapha
(“phlegm”) Along with vata (“air”) and
pitta (“bile”), one of the three bodily
humours (tridosha) in ayurveda, the
traditional system of Indian medicine.
Every person has all three of these
humours, but usually one is dominant;
this marks a person in certain ways, par-
ticularly with regard to health, digestion,
and metabolism. Kapha is associated
with the elements of earth and water,
since phlegm has both liquid and solid
characteristics. It provides solidity and
fluidity. Those who exhibit this humor
are said to be strong, healthy, and have
great stamina. At the same time, this
solidity can take the form of inertia and
fatigue; “phlegmatic” people must do
their best avoid these tendencies.

is to bring the Ganges down to earth
and have their ashes touched by her
waters. Fulfilling this condition galva-
nizes several generations of Sagar’s
descendants—Anshuman, Dilip, and
Bhagirath—until the last is finally suc-
cessful in bringing the river to earth.
Kapila
(2) Philosopher cited as the traditional
founder of the Samkhya philosophical
school, one of the six schools of Hindu
philosophy. Little is known about him;
much of what is known has a legendary
tone that makes its value as historical
data questionable. Kapila may have
lived in the seventh century B.C.E. If
this is true, Kapila would have lived
about a thousand years earlier than
Ishvarakrishna. The latter is the first
Samkhya figure from whom we have a
well-attested text, the Samkhyakarikas,
which is the foundational text for
the school.
KapilaKapilavastu
A powerful and ornery sage in Hindu
mythology. Kapila’s most famous mythic
exploit occurs in the story of the
Descent of the Ganges. King Sagar is on
the verge of completing his hundredth
horse sacrifice (ashvamedha). This will
give him enough religious merit to claim
the throne of Indra, king of the gods.
Indra forestalls this threat by stealing the
sacrificial horse and tying it outside
Kapila’s ashram. Sagar dispatches his
sixty-thousand sons to find the horse.
When they finally locate it at Kapila’s
ashram, they find the sage deep in med-
itation. The sons assume that the sage’s
meditation is a ploy to keep from having
to answer their questions, so they begin
to abuse him physically. Kapila becomes
extremely angry. The accumulated
power generated by his long asceticism
(tapas) is released like fire, burning the
sixty-thousand sons to ash. Kapila later
informs Sagar’s sole surviving descen-
dant, Anshuman, that the only way toAncient city in southern Nepal, just over
the Indian border from the state of
Bihar. Buddhist sources identify it as the
capital city of Buddha’s father, King
Suddhodhana of the Shakya tribe.
Kapilavastu was part of the thriving
urban network in that region of India
during the fifth century B.C.E.
Kapu
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
married, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). These jatis were organized
(and their social status determined) by
the group’s hereditary occupation, over
which each group held a monopoly. In
traditional society, the Kapus were farm-
ers. In much of modern Andhra
Pradesh, particularly the region border-
ing modern Tamil Nadu, the Kapus are
the dominant landholding group.Karma
Karana
In Indian philosophy, the name for an
instrumental cause, or the cause by
which another thing is accomplished.
An example often given by the Nyaya
philosophical school states that when
a potter connects two pot-halves using
a stick, the stick is the instrumental
cause for the creation of the pot. In
Sanskrit grammar, the word karana has
a parallel sense; it designates the word
in a sentence that shows how the
action is accomplished.
Karandamakuta
(“basket-crown”) A small crown in the
shape of a basket, notable for its lack of
ornamentation. In Hindu art, the karan-
damakuta is the head covering worn by
a lesser deity. In contrast, the kirita-
makuta worn by the god Vishnu is
much larger and more elaborately deco-
rated, in keeping with his status as one
of the predominant deities in Hindu
religious life.
Karka Sankranti
Date on the Indian calendar marking
the sun’s transition into the zodiacal
sign of Cancer, and thus, the beginning
of the dakshinayana, the six months in
which the sun is traveling toward the
south. In Western astrology this happens
during the summer solstice (around
June 21), but in Indian reckoning it
occurs around July 14. The discrepancy
arises due to the different ways in which
the two systems mark the beginning of
the astrological year. In Western astrology
the beginning of the year is based on the
sun’s position in relation to the earth
and occurs during the vernal equinox
(around March 21). In Indian reckoning
the starting point of the zodiac comes
when the sun intersects the midpoint of
a group of stars named Ashvini, and is
based on the position of the sun with
regard to fixed stars. Karka Sankranti is
not marked by significant observances,
unlike Makara Sankranti, which occurs
six months earlier, marking the
beginning of the sun’s northward
journey (uttarayana). The southern
direction is associated with the god
Yama, who is death personified. Thus,
this southward movement is considered
less auspicious than its northward
counterpart.
Karma
(“action”) The notion of karma and its
connection with reincarnation (sam-
sara) are perhaps the most fundamental
concepts in Indian thought and are
ideas shared by all Indian religions:
Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh.
Although the literal meaning of karma is
“action,” it is believed to encompass
words and thoughts as well as deeds.
The basic assumption behind the
notion of karma is that of a dynamic
universe, in which any action that one
takes will have consequences that will
eventually affect oneself. In the simplest
explanation, good actions will have
good consequences, and evil actions
will have evil consequences, in an
extended chain of cause and effect.
Since thoughts are considered actions,
this determination of “good” and “evil”
actions also takes into account one’s
motives—a laudable action performed
for an ignoble motive is still a laudable
action, but will not generate as much
merit as the same action performed for
a pure motive.
Karma is seen as a purely physical
process, much like the law of gravity. It
does not require a divine overseer,
although in devotional Hinduism, God
is generally seen as having the power to
nullify one’s past karma. The effects of
one’s actions may come either in this life
or in future lives. The former case is easy
to believe, since most people accept that
their actions have consequences, but
the latter case is much more difficult to
support with concrete evidence. Since
the general tone of one’s life is seen as
more important than a few isolated acts,
one might compare the idea of karma
with the notion of a person’s “character.”
Both are determined by one’s habitual

Classical Indian Traditions, 1980; and

(ed.), Religion in India, 1991.
Karmamarga
(“path of action”) One of Hinduism’s
three generally accepted paths to gain
final liberation of the soul (moksha),
along with the Path of Devotion (bhakti-
marga) and the Path of Wisdom (jnana-
marga). Bhaktimarga stresses devotion
to God, and the jnanamarga stresses
the realization of the ultimate identity
of one’s individual Self (atman)
and Ultimate Reality (Brahman).
Karmamarga emphasizes selfless action
performed for the benefit of others.
Karmendriya
(“organ of action”) In Indian philoso-
phy, any of the five organs through
[[352]]

which human beings act on their envi-
ronment, traditionally considered to be:
voice, hands, feet, and the organs of
elimination and generation.
Karna
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Karna is the eldest of
the Pandava brothers, although he is
not aware of his true identity until a few
days before his death. He is born when
his mother, Kunti, in a moment of
youthful impulsiveness, looks upon the
sun while reciting a mantra, giving her
the power to have a son by any of the
gods. She is immediately visited by a
shining figure, who leaves her with an
equally shining son. Distraught and des-
perate at the birth of this child, which as
an unmarried woman she feels she can-
not keep, she puts him in a box and
abandons him in the Ganges.
The child is adopted by the chario-
teer, Adhiratha, who raises Karna as his
own son. Karna later comes to the court
of King Dhrtarashtra, where he
becomes friends with the king’s son,Karnataka
Duryodhana, the epic’s antagonist. While
at court, Karna begins a lifelong conflict
with Arjuna, one of the five Pandava
brothers. Arjuna’s comments about
Karna’s unknown parentage are meant to
deny Karna the recognition he deserves
as Arjuna’s equal. As do all the princes,
Karna studies with Drona, the archery
master. When Drona refuses to teach
Karna the secret of the Brahma weapon
Karna wants to use to kill Arjuna, Karna
goes to the sage Parashuram avatar for
this instruction. He presents himself as a
brahmin, since Parashuram hates the
kshatriya (ruling) class and refuses to
accept any of them as students.
Parashuram teaches Karna all that he
wants to know. During this period, howev-
er, Karna receives two curses that ulti-
mately determine his fate. Karna kills a
brahmin’s cow, so the brahmin curses him
to have his chariot wheel stick in the mud
and be killed upon it by his enemy. The
second curse comes from Parashuram.
One day as Parashuram sleeps with his
head in Karna’s lap, a beetle bores into
Karna’s thigh, which in the epic is a
euphemism for the genitals. Despite the
pain and blood, Karna remains still so he
will not disturb his sleeping guru. When
Parashuram awakens, he realizes that
Karna’s tolerance for pain means that he is
a kshatriya, thus Karna has gained instruc-
tion under false pretenses. Parashuram
curses Karna that at the critical moment,
he will forget everything he has learned.
Both of these curses eventually come true;
despite fighting with great valor in the
Mahabharata war, Karna is killed by
Arjuna when the wheel of his chariot is
stuck in the mud.
On the eve of the great war, Karna’s
mother, Kunti, comes to him and reveals
his true identity and implores him to
return and fight alongside his brothers.
Karna refuses, saying that things have
gone too far for such measures, but
promises Kunti that he will not harm
any of his brothers except for Arjuna,
whom he has sworn to kill. In his deci-
sion Karna is also bound by his loyalty to
Duryodhana, whose friendship and
support for many years overrides any
obligation to a family he has just discov-
ered. As a man willing to stand by his
friends and his principles, even in a
cause he knows to be flawed, Karna
endures as one of the tragic heroes of
the Mahabharata.
Karnaprayag
Himalayan town and sacred site (tirtha)
at the confluence of the Alakananda
and Pindara rivers, in the Chamoli dis-
trict of the state of Uttar Pradesh. As
with all the other river junctions in the
Garhwal region, this is considered an
especially holy place. Local tradition
ascribes the site’s name to the
Mahabharata hero Karna, who is
believed to have worshiped the sun
at this place. In return he received a
suit of armor that could not be pierced
and a quiver of arrows that could
never be exhausted.
Karnata
Southern Indian brahmins who make
up one of the five southern brahmin
communities (Pancha Dravida); the
other four are Gujarati, Maharashtri,
Andhra, and Dravida. The core region
for the Karnata brahmins is the modern
state of Karnataka.
Karnataka
One of the four southern Indian states,
whose inhabitants speak a Dravidian lan-
guage, in this case Kannada. Karnataka is
one of the “linguistic” states formed after
India’s independence in 1947, intended to
unite people with a common language and
culture under one state government. The
state was largely formed from the former
kingdom of Mysore. In medieval times,
Karnataka was the seat of important
Hindu kingdoms, particularly the Hoysala
and Vijayanagar dynasties; these dynas-
ties built cities at Belur, Halebid, and
Hampi, which are now important archeo-
logical sites. Karnataka is also the home of
the Lingayats, devotees (bhakta) of Shiva,
whose missionary work eventually
squeezed out the thriving Jain community.
[[353]]
Karnavedha (“ear-piercing”) Samskara
Sculptures decorate the Virupaksha Temple in Pattadakal,
one of many historical sites in the state of Karnataka.
Jain monuments, such as the massive
statue at Shravanabelgola, still stand.
Karnataka also contains important Hindu
holy places, such as Shrirangapatnam and
Shringeri math. Even though much of the
state’s economy is still highly agricultural,
Karnataka’s capital, Bangalore, is a world-
wide center for computer software devel-
opment. For general information about
Karnataka and other regions of India, see
Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th ed., Lonely
Planet, 1998.
Karnavedha
(“ear-piercing”) Samskara
The ninth of the sixteen traditional life-
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
an infant’s ears were pierced. This rite
was done not only for ornamentation
but also for protective purposes.
According to Sushruta, the author of
one of the oldest Indian medical texts,
piercing the ears protected children
against certain ailments. Although in
modern times most young girls have
pierced ears, this practice is far less
common for boys, suggesting that
ornamentation has taken precedence
over protection.
[[354]]

Karni Mata
Presiding deity of the temple by the
same name in the village of Deshnok in
the state of Rajasthan. Karni Mata is a
local form of the Mother Goddess; her
name refers to the place where an ear
(karni) of the dismembered goddess Sati
fell to earth. The temple is unusual in
that it is inhabited by thousands of rats,
which are considered Karni Mata’s sons.
According to the local tradition, Karni
Mata’s son drowned in a local pond.
When she tried to influence Yama, the
god of death, to give her son a favorable
rebirth, she was told that he had already
been reborn as a rat. At her request,
Yama allowed all of her male descen-
dants to be born as rats in the temple at
Deshnok. Yama agreed that in the next
life the rats would be reborn as family
members of the temple’s servants.
According to this myth, the rats and the
temple priests are all members of one
extended family.
Karpatri Maharaj, Swami
A modern-day ascetic noted for the strict-
ness of his ascetic practices. His name
comes from his habit of using his handsKarva Chauth
(kara) as the vessel (patra) in which he
received the food he took as alms. This is
considered one of the strictest ascetic
practices, since the amount of food one
can receive in this way is fairly small. The
lack of an eating vessel indicates complete
renunciation of material possessions.
Swami Karpatri was also known for his
conservative political views. After Indian
independence in 1947, he was one of the
founders of the political party Ram Rajya
Parishad (“Organization for Ram’s Reign”).
The party’s basic assertion was that people
had to follow the division of status and
labor found in the traditional caste system
in order to have a smoothly working soci-
ety. Aside from this conservative social
platform, the party also backed Hindu
causes such as the demand for a total ban
on cow slaughter. Despite being a Sanyasi
who had renounced the world, Swami
Karpatri still maintained some residual
attitudes from his former life. He had been
born a brahmin; even after renouncing the
world, he would only take food from brah-
min houses. Swami Karpatri exemplifies
how many ascetics still retain connections
with the “everyday” world—both in retain-
ing some concern for their former status
and in taking organized political action to
promote causes reflecting deeply
entrenched Hindu values.
Kartigai
Eighth month in the Tamil year, corre-
sponding to the northern Indian solar
month of Vrschika (the zodiacal sign of
Scorpio), which usually falls within
November and December. The existence
of several different calendars is one clear
sign of the continuing importance of
regional cultural patterns. One way that
the Tamils retain their culture is by pre-
serving their traditional calendar. Tamil is
one of the few regional languages in India
with an ancient, well-established literary
tradition. See also Tamil months, Tamil
Nadu, and Tamil language.
Kartik
According to the lunar calendar, by which
most Hindu religious festivals are deter-
mined, Kartik is the eighth month in the
lunar year, usually falling within October
and November. In northern India, Kartik
coincides with the harvest when the
weather is quite pleasant. Kartik is one of
the most ritually important months of the
year; its major festivals include Karva
Chauth, Rambha Ekadashi, Narak
Chaturdashi, Diwali, Govardhan Puja
(Annakut), Devotthayan Ekadashi, Tulsi
Vivah, and Kartik Purnima.
Kartik Purnima
Festival during the full moon in the lunar
month of Kartik (October–November),
celebrated as a bathing (snana) festival.
During the festival, an early morning bath
in the Ganges or any other sacred river is
believed to provide the bather with excep-
tional religious merit. People often journey
to sacred rivers to take advantage of this
opportunity. Also on this day, Sikhs cele-
brate the birthday of their religious leader,
Guru Nanak, born in 1469.
Karttikeya
(“son of the Krttikas”) Epithet of the god
Skanda, considered the son of Shiva.
Skanda is not born in the usual manner
but develops when Shiva’s semen falls
into the Ganges River. The name
Karttikeya comes from the six minor god-
desses known as the Krttikas, who are the
deified form of the constellation Pleiades.
After Skanda is born, these goddesses
become his foster mothers and nurse
him, which in Indian culture is believed to
create a mother-child bond. So that none
of the goddesses will feel slighted, Skanda
sprouts six heads, allowing him to nurse
from all of them at the same time.
Karva Chauth
Religious vow (vrat) observed on the
fourth (chauth) day of the dark, waning
half of the lunar month of Kartik
(October–November). Karva Chauth is
taken by married women to ensure their
husbands’ health, prosperity, and long life.
There are many such vows in which
women’s observances and sacrifices are
[[355]]
Kashi
channeled into maintaining the welfare
and prosperity of the family. Although
such vows are voluntary in the strictest
sense, there is great social pressure for
women to perform them, thus fulfilling
their expected role as “good” wives. Karva
Chauth is a very strict vow; women observ-
ing it neither eat nor drink until they see
the moon rising that evening. When the
moon appears, the women offer water to it
and then are permitted to drink. On this
evening, women may also worship the
deities Shiva and Parvati (the divine
example of a happily married couple) and
Karttikeya, their son. Women also give
each other small pots (karva) filled with
sweets, hence the festival’s name.
The charter myth for this observance
tells how a young bride, while performing
this fast at the home of her birth, grows
faint and nearly lifeless. Her brothers are
so worried about her health that one of
them climbs into a tree with a lantern,
while the others convince her that the
light is coming from the rising moon. The
young woman is greatly relieved, but as
soon as she drinks water her husband falls
down dead. Her brothers eventually have
to confess what they have done. As the
woman lays lamenting her newly gained
widowhood, she is discovered by the god-
dess Parvati, who assures her that her hus-
band will be restored to life if she faithfully
observes Karva Chauth the following year.
The young woman does as she is told and
regains her husband.
This tale contains significant cultural
information, particularly on people’s dif-
fering obligations. A brother’s duty is to
protect his sister. A wife’s primary duty is
to her husband, and her efforts should be
devoted to his welfare. As in many such
tales, the consequences of failing to keep a
religious observance are swift and severe,
and the rewards from faithfully perform-
ing it are equally grand.
Kashi
(“shining”) One of the traditional names
for the city of Benares. Benares is men-
tioned in the list of the Seven Sacred
Cities, where death brings final liberation
[[356]]

of the soul. In a more strict local sense, the
name Kashi designates the largest of the
three traditional sacred zones in Benares.
It includes everything within the
Panchakroshi Yatra road, a circuit
around the city that marks the outer limit
of the region. The name Kashi refers to the
mythic story of the jyotirlinga, the “pillar
of light” in which the god Shiva is said to
have first appeared. According to tradi-
tion, the pillar of light did not just land in
Kashi but was itself a form of Kashi, thus
indicating the city’s sanctity over all other
places on earth.
Kashmir
One of the three distinct cultural areas,
along with Jammu and Ladakh, in the
modern Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir is a former
princely state, in which the Hindu Dogra
kings also ruled over the minority popula-
tions of the mostly Muslim Kashmiris and
the mostly Buddhist Ladakhis. Since
Indian independence in 1947, this ethnic
and religious division continues to be a
source of trouble, and nowhere more than
in Kashmir. At independence, Pakistan
attempted to take the region by force and
claimed a section of Kashmir. In the time
since then, India and Pakistan have fought
several wars over it; Pakistan claims it by
virtue of their shared religion of Islam;
India claims it by virtue of a document
signed by the last of its kings, Maharaja
Hari Singh. The Kashmiris themselves
have been caught in this regional clash,
and their demands for greater self-deter-
mination have been largely ignored.
After the 1986 state elections, which were
widely regarded as rigged, tensions
in Kashmir came to a boil. Since 1990 the
tension has turned into an open rebellion,
assisted by covert aid from Pakistan.
Most Kashmiris became Muslims
during medieval times. Before that time
the region was a Hindu cultural area.
Kashmir still has some stunning exam-
ples of early Hindu architecture, such as
the sun temple at Martand, a temple to
the god Shiva at Pandrenthan, and the
shrine to Shiva at Amarnath cave whichKataragama
Some pilgrims to the sacred site of Kataragama participate in extreme ascetic practices,
such as swinging from hooks that are pierced through their backs.
is still an important pilgrimage site.
Kashmir also has a minority Hindu pop-
ulation, known as the Kashmiri Pandits.
Recent troubles have prompted many of
them to migrate south to other parts of
India. Although these two communities
profess different religious beliefs, they
share a common language and sense of
Kashmiri identity and culture. For gen-
eral information about Kashmir and
regions of India, see Christine Nivin et
al., India. 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Kashyapa
In Hindu mythology, Kashyapa is the
chief of the Prajapatis (a class of semi-
divine beings) and the father of Garuda,
the divine eagle who serves as the ani-
mal “vehicle” for the god Vishnu.
Kashyapa is also one of the Seven Sages
whose names mark exogamous clan
“lineages” (gotra); the others are
Gautama, Bharadvaja, Vasishtha,
Bhrgu, Atri, and Vishvamitra. All brah-
mins are believed to be descended from
these seven sages, with each family tak-
ing the name of its progenitor as its
gotra name. In modern times, gotras are
still important, since marriage within
the gotra is forbidden. After her mar-
riage, the new bride adopts her hus-
band’s gotra as part of her new identity.
See also marriage prohibitions.
Kataka Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual, a
particular hand gesture (hasta), in
which the tips of the fingers are loosely
joined to the thumb, to create a ring (the
word kataka literally means “bracelet”).
This hasta is common in the images of
Hindu goddesses, but also serves a use-
ful purpose: a fresh flower may be
inserted in her hand every day.
Kataragama
Sacred site (tirtha) located in the
extreme southeastern part of Sri Lanka
that is dedicated to the god Skanda in
his southern Indian manifestation as
Murugan. The site is notable for being
outside of the Indian mainland and as
an important place of worship for both
Hindus and Buddhists. According to
[[357]]
Katha
mythic tradition, the site was estab-
lished when Skanda went hunting in
the jungles of Sri Lanka, fell in love
with a tribal woman named Valli, and
vowed to remain forever in her home.
As the son of the god Shiva, Skanda is a
powerful deity in the Hindu pantheon.
His relationship with Valli shows his
accessibility and his love for his devo-
tees (bhakta).
The annual Kataragama pilgrimage
in July–August is a theater to demon-
strate these qualities: Many people
come seeking healing from physical
ailments or deliverance from distress,
while others come to fulfill vows for
benefits already received. Such vows
often take the form of extreme self-
mortification—by carrying the kavadi,
a yoke held in place by hooks piercing
the flesh; by piercing the tongue or
cheeks with tiny arrows, one of the
symbols of Skanda; or by hanging from
hooks embedded in the back and
thighs. These ardent devotees are
reportedly rewarded for their suffering
with a state of ecstasy in which they
feel no pain and suffer no bleeding. In
this state of ecstasy, the devotees are
also believed to be mouthpieces for the
god Skanda. Other pilgrims seek their
advice for every conceivable kind of
problem, under the assumption that
Skanda will give them the most appro-
priate answer. For further information
see Paul Wirz, Kataragama: the Holiest
Place in Ceylon, 1966; and Bryan
Pfaffenberger,
“The
Kataragama
Pilgrimage,” in Journal of Asian
Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2, 1979.
Katha
(“conversation”) Genre of public reli-
gious address based on recitation and
exposition of a religious text. Katha is
most often associated with the
Ramcharitmanas , a version of the
epic Ramayana written by the poet-
saint Tulsidas, but may be used to
explain other religious texts as well.
Kathas may be delivered in a number
of ways: The speaker may go through
[[358]]

large parts of the text, give detailed
analysis and commentary on a very
small portion of the text, select pas-
sages from throughout the text to
illustrate a particular theme, or pre-
sent a completely spontaneous and
free-floating exposition. For listeners,
attending such events is not only aes-
thetically satisfying but also consid-
ered to be a form of satsang or
religious association. Such gatherings
were (and are) one of the major ways
in which illiterate people memorize
large parts of these primary texts. For
further information see Philip
Lutgendorf, The Life of a Text, 1991.
Kathak
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Like much
of traditional Indian culture, classical
dances are identified with certain
regions; Kathak is primarily found in
northern India. Traditionally, Kathak
descended from the ras lilas of Braj,
devotional dances illustrating events
from the life of Krishna. This claim
has little historical support and may
simply reflect the desire to root all of
the Indian arts in religion. It is not dis-
puted, however, that Kathak devel-
oped as an art form in the courts of the
northern Indian princes, where it was
performed for the entertainment of
the monarch and his guests. In time,
two major Kathak centers developed:
Jaipur, famous for spectacular foot-
work; and Lucknow, known for its
attention to acting. Stylistically,
Kathak is marked by an upright pos-
ture, with the legs kept straight. The
dance emphasizes rapid, rhythmic
foot patterns, rhythms accentuated by
strings of bells worn on the dancer’s
ankles and complemented by multiple
turns; the torso is kept fairly immobile.
As with all forms of Indian dance,
Kathak includes a well-developed
“vocabulary” of facial expressions and
gestures of the arms and hands thatKatyavalambita Hasta
allow the dancer to convey a great
range of emotions to the audience. For
further information see Mohan
Khokar, Traditions of Indian Classical
Dance, 1984.
Kathakali
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam, Orissi, Kuchipudi,
Kathak, and Manipuri. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dances are identified with certain
regions; Kathakali is primarily found
in Kerala. Unlike many of the other
classical forms, Kathakali did not
develop in a temple setting. It
appeared as a developed style in the
seventeenth century, although it is
rooted in folk and religious dramas
dating
from
centuries
before.
Kathakali has traditionally been
danced only by men—the women’s
form in Kerala is Mohini Attam. A
Kathakali performance is one of the
most dramatic spectacles in the
Indian arts. Part of this drama comes
from the dancers’ training, stressing
controlled facial mobility to facilitate
ease and power of expression. The
dancers wear flamboyant costumes
and headdresses. The most striking
feature of all is elaborate makeup—
the heroes’ faces are painted a vivid
green, with fluted ridges made of rice
paste attached to their cheeks, while
villains are painted in green and red
and have knobs of pith attached to
their chins and foreheads. Stylistically,
the dance moves between athletic
jumps and majestic turns, with reli-
gious texts forming the dominant
source for stories. As with all Indian
dances, Kathakali has a well-devel-
oped “vocabulary” of gesture and
facial expression, which makes it pos-
sible for the dancers to engage in
complex storytelling. As with all other
classical dances, Kathakali has under-
gone certain changes in the past gen-
eration, spurred by a shift in the
venue from temple courtyards to
stage performance. For example, a
planned stage performance requires a
well-organized “program” and a desig-
nated time frame, whereas in earlier
times Kathakali performances would
often last all night long. For further infor-
mation see Mohan Khokar, Traditions of
Indian Classical Dance, 1984.
Katha Upanishad
One of the later and more developed
Upanishads, the speculative religious
texts that form the latest stratum of the
oldest Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas. As
with most of the Upanishads, the Katha
Upanishad investigates profound ques-
tions, in particular the nature of the Self
(atman). The text tells the story of a
boy, Nachiketas, whose father sends
him to Death in a fit of anger.
Nachiketas goes to Death’s abode, but
finds no one. He waits for three days
before Death returns. To make amends
for ignoring a brahmin guest—which
the text describes as a serious sin—
Death gives Nachiketas three boons, or
wishes. Nachiketas uses the first boon
to be restored to his father’s house and
the second to receive instruction in
performing a sacrificial fire. With the
final boon, he asks what happens to a
person after the death of the body.
Death first tries to evade the question,
then tries to bribe Nachiketas with
other gifts. When the boy insists on an
answer, Death begins to reveal his
secrets; these revelations make up the
bulk of the text. Death’s secrets focus
mainly on the reality of the Self, its eter-
nal and indestructible nature, its subtle
qualities, and the difficulties in realiz-
ing it. The Self is the ultimate truth, and
to know it is to know the only thing that
really matters.
Katyavalambita Hasta
In Indian dance, sculpture, and ritual,
the name of a particular hand gesture
(hasta) in which the arm hangs down
beside the body and the hand rests on
the hip in a relaxed manner.
[[359]]
Katyayana Smrti
Katyayana SmrtiKausalya
One of the smrtis or “remembered”
texts, a class of literature deemed
important but less authoritative than
the other textual category, the shrutis
or “heard” texts. This smrti is attrib-
uted to the sage Katyayana and is an
example of one of the Dharma
Shastras, manuals prescribing rules
for correct human behavior and ideal
social life. Unlike the Dharma Sutras,
which are ascribed to recognizable
individuals, the Dharma Shastras are
usually credited to mythic sages as a
strategy to reinforce the authority of
these texts. Katyayana’s complete text
has not survived, although more than
one thousand verses have been com-
piled from later works. Katyayana’s
text was the first to focus on the rights
of women: he gave particular atten-
tion to women’s personal property
(stridhan), both to explain their pow-
ers and to prescribe rules for its inher-
itance when a woman died.In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kausalya is the first
wife of King Dasharatha and the mother
of the god-king Rama.
Kaurava
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the Kauravas are the
hundred sons of King Dhrtarashtra and
the epic’s antagonists to the Pandava
protagonists. The Kauravas receive their
name as descendants of Kuru, an ances-
tor of King Shantanu. As in many cases
in Hindu mythology, the Kaurava sons
are born in an unusual manner. Their
mother, Gandhari, receives a blessing
(ashirvad) from the sage Vyasa that she
will give birth to one hundred sons. Her
pregnancy lasts for over two years.
When she grows impatient and tries to
hasten the delivery, she gives birth to a
great lump of flesh. Vyasa advises
Gandhari to divide the lump and place
each piece in a pot of clarified butter
(ghee). In due time, each of the 101
pots break open to reveal one hundred
handsome boys, as well as a single
daughter, Dussala. Of these hundred
sons, the most important are the two
eldest, Duryodhana and Duhshasana.
[[360]]

Kaustubha
In Hindu mythology, the gem that the
god Vishnu wears on his chest. The
Kaustubha jewel is one of the precious
things produced by churning the ocean
of milk. Other products include the god-
dess Lakshmi, the Kamadhenu or wish-
ing-cow, and the nectar of immortality
(amrta). Vishnu’s possession of the
Kaustubha jewel is a symbol of his
power and his mastery over the uni-
verse. See also Tortoise avatar.
Kautilya
According to tradition, Kautilya was the
author of the Arthashastra (“Treatise on
Power”), a text which is a handbook on
the exercise of royal power. The ruler
portrayed in the Arthashastra cares little
for ideals or dreams, but rather is willing
to do whatever is necessary to remain in
power. Aside from his authorship of the
Arthashastra, Kautilya is also identified
as the Machiavellian brahmin minister
who
orchestrated
Chandragupta
Maurya’s rise to power, but there are
serious doubts that these Kautilyas are
the same person.
Kavadi
A bamboo yoke topped with semicir-
cular splints of bamboo that is carried
on a devotee’s (bhakta) shoulders dur-
ing certain festivals devoted to the god
Murugan. A kavadi is usually decorat-
ed with flowers, pictures, ribbons, and
other ornaments. A devotee carrying a
kavadi is inviting Murugan to descend
and rest upon it, bestowing his grace
through divine possession. Carrying a
kavadi is usually done to fulfill a vow
often made when asking Murugan for
some favor, such as healing or deliver-
ance from other distress. This can beKavitt
an extremely strenuous rite: Fully
loaded kavadis sometimes weigh one
hundred pounds. The carriers some-
times secure the kavadis by using
metal hooks stuck into the flesh of
their backs and chests. Carrying the
kavadi is seen as an act of devotion
and can be found wherever the wor-
ship of Murugan is popular: in south-
ern India, at Kataragama in Sri Lanka,
in Malaysia, and in South Africa.
Kaveri River
See Cauvery.
Kavi
A word that most literally means “wise
man,” but more commonly refers to a
“poet” or “bard.” This secondary mean-
ing comes from the pan-Indian assump-
tion that the purpose of such poetic
writers was not merely to entertain but
to educate and to uplift.
Kavikarnapura
(mid-16th c.) Author of one version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of the
life of the Bengali saint Chaitanya.
Kavikarnapura’s text was written in 1542,
nine years after Chaitanya’s death, when
the effort to declare Chaitanya a saint
had already begun. Kavikarnapura freely
acknowledges his debt to an earlier bio-
graphy of Chaitanya, written by Murari
Gupta. He diverges from the earlier text
by portraying Chaitanya as an incarna-
tion of Krishna, descending to earth to
bestow grace on ordinary mortals. As
with the other traditional accounts of
Chaitanya’s life, the author does not
claim this to be an “objective” biography
but instead a hagiography written by a
passionate devotee (bhakta).
Kavitavali
(“series of poems”) The final poetic
work of the poet-saint Tulsidas
(1532–1623?). In the Kavitavali ,
Tulsidas gives a condensed version of
the epic Ramayana as well as poems
in which he clearly speaks in his own
voice. Evidence in the text indicates
that it was completed after 1615. The
poems are written in the savaiya and
kavitt meters, which are longer, more
complex, and less accessible than the
meters used in most of Tulsidas’s ear-
lier works. The Kavitavali is divided
into seven sections, paralleling the
internal structure of the Ramayana,
but the bulk of the Kavitavali’s poems
are in the last two sections. One of
these is the “Lankakhand,” which
describes the climactic battle symbol-
izing the struggle between good and
evil; in this section the kavitt meter is
used to render vivid battle scenes. The
final book is the “Uttarakhand,” com-
prising more than half of the entire
work. In this last section, Tulsidas has
written some autobiographical verses
and reiterates themes found through-
out much of his work: the degeneracy
of the present age (Kali Yuga), a stress
on devotion as the only means of sal-
vation, and the power inherent in
God’s name, through which any
obstacles can be overcome. Parts
of this latter section sound pes-
simistic, perhaps reflecting the trials
of advancing age, but through it all
comes a note of hope that the author’s
trust in God’s saving power will not
ultimately be in vain.
Kavitt
A particular meter, or rhythm pattern,
in Hindi poetry. Verses composed in
the Kavitt meter have four lines of
thirty-one syllables each, with the
break in each individual line often
coming after the sixteenth syllable.
This is an unusually long meter, thus
lending itself well to extended
descriptions employing alliteration;
in his Kavitavali , the poet-saint
Tulsidas uses this meter with great
affect to describe battle scenes.
[[361]]
Kavya
At an altitude of almost 12,000 feet in the Himalaya Mountains, pilgrims traveling to the
sacred site of Kedarnath must climb a steep path and contend with unpredictable weather.
Kavya
(“related to kavis”) The most general
name for courtly poetry or poetic prose,
most often composed in the Sanskrit
language. Such kavya was usually
[[362]]

written and performed in a court
setting, where innovative reworking of
traditional forms was valued more highly
than originality or self-revelation. The
primary building block in such poetryKedarnath
was the two-line verse, which was a self-
contained unit with regard to meaning.
Verses were composed in meters
ranging from four to twenty-six syllables
per half-line, and were ornamented
with various alamkaras (“figures of
speech”) in an effort to convey the mood
(rasa) appropriate to the subject matter.
Poetic forms range from single-verse
epigrams, such as those of Bhartrhari,
to extended epic poems (mahakavyas),
most notably those of Kalidasa.
Although such poetry contains frequent
references to religious life, it was
primarily intended for entertainment
rather than moral encouragement, an
emphasis which reflects the court
atmosphere in which it was composed.
The singular exception to this trend is
the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva, a text
said to have been composed at the
Jagannath temple in Puri, which focus-
es on devotion to the god Krishna as
lord of the universe.
Kayasth
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous, or inter-
marrying, subgroups known as jatis
(“birth”). The jatis were organized
(and their social status determined)
by the group’s hereditary occupation,
over which each group held a monopoly.
The Kayasths worked as scribes and
recorders. They were mostly associated
with maintaining business and
mercantile records, accounting, and
keeping businesses running smoothly
and profitably.
Kedarnath
Village and sacred site (tirtha) in the
Himalayas at the headwaters of the
Mandakini River, one of the tributaries
of the Ganges. The village is named for
its presiding deity, who is the god Shiva
in his manifestation as the “Lord of
Kedar.” Shiva is present at Kedarnath in
the form of a linga, a pillar-shaped
image. The Kedarnath linga is deemed
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva. Kedarnath’s sanctity is only
matched by the difficulty in getting to it.
Its high altitude—close to 12,000 feet—
means that it is only accessible between
late April and October, a characteristic
also of Yamunotri, Gangotri, and
Badrinath, the three other major
Himalayan pilgrim sites. A trip to
Kedarnath preserves some of the diffi-
culty
formerly
associated
with
Himalayan pilgrimage. Pilgrims travel
the last ten miles on foot or horseback,
during which the path climbs five thou-
sand feet. Those braving the trek must
contend with the unpredictable moun-
tain weather, but may also be rewarded
with spectacular vistas. The temple of
Kedarnath is surrounded by mountain
meadows and shaded by mountains
capped with snow year-round.
The Kedarnath linga is a natural
ridge of stone considered to be a self-
manifestation (svayambhu) of Shiva,
and is considered to be unusually pow-
erful. The particular shape of this linga is
tied to Kedarnath’s charter myth. One
version of this story is connected to the
five Pandava brothers, who are the pro-
tagonists in the Mahabharata, the later
of the two great Hindu epics. The
Pandavas make their final journey into
the Himalayas, searching for a vision of
Shiva. They finally see him at a distance,
but when they try to get closer, Shiva
takes the form of a bull and begins run-
ning through the snow. The bull burrows
into a snow bank. When the Pandavas
follow, they find the body of the bull in
the snow. The ridge of rock that forms
the Kedarnath linga is considered to be
the hump of this bull. The bull’s head
continues traveling over the hills, even-
tually stopping in Nepal, where it takes
form as Pashupatinath.
A completely different charter myth
draws on the traditional belief that Shiva
makes his home high in the mountains.
This myth identifies the Panchkedar (a
network of five Shiva shrines in the
Garhwal region) with five parts of
Shiva’s body, thus connecting the deity
with the land itself and making the land
[[363]]
Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad
holy. Of these five, Kedarnath is identi-
fied as Shiva’s back, Madmaheshvar
his navel, Tungnath his arm, Rudranath
his face, and Kalpeshvar his matted
locks (jata).
Kena (“By Whom?”) Upanishad
One of the shorter of the early specula-
tive texts known as the Upanishads,
whose name comes from the first word
of the text itself. The Kena Upanishad is
unusual in that the first two sections are
written in verse, and the third and fourth
in prose. This change gives the text a
somewhat disjointed feel, despite its
brevity, and raises the possibility that it
is a compilation of two earlier texts. As
with many of the later upanishads, the
Kena Upanishad propounds that the
ultimate source of all reality is ascribed
to a single power that can only be dis-
covered through a flash of mystic
insight. The verse sections describe this
power: “It is conceived of by one who
does not conceive of it, it is not con-
ceived by one who conceives, it is not
known by those who think they know it,
it is known by those who think they do
not know it” (verse 2.3). The prose sec-
tions are very different, narrating an
encounter between a mysterious being
(Brahman personified) and several of
the primary gods in the earlier Vedic lit-
erature—Indra, Agni, and Vayu. Despite
all their efforts, the gods are unable to
exercise their respective powers of
storm, fire, and wind, showing that their
divine power is not independently
theirs, but is derived from Brahman.
Kerala
One of the four southern Indian states,
whose inhabitants speak a Dravidian
language, in this case Malayalam. Kerala
occupies the narrow strip of land
between the Western Ghats and the
Arabian sea, in the region formerly
known as the Malabar coast. Kerala is
one of the “linguistic” states formed
after Indian independence in 1947, to
unite people with a common language
[[364]]

and culture under one state govern-
ment. It was created from the
Malayalam-speaking regions of the for-
mer Madras state, plus the princely
states of Travancore and Cochin. Kerala
has always been important as a trading
center. The desire for its spices and san-
dalwood have brought merchants from
the Middle East for thousands of years.
In modern times it has had India’s first
elected communist government, and is
the only Indian state to have 100 percent
adult literacy. Kerala’s most famous
sacred site is the temple of Aiyappa at
Shabari Malai. By custom the annual
pilgrimage to the site is restricted to
men as well as women past child-
bearing age. For general information
about Kerala and other regions of India,
see Christine Nivin et al., India. 8th
ed., Lonely Planet, 1998.
Keshanta (“shaving the beard”)
Samskara
The thirteenth of the sixteen traditional
life-cycle ceremonies (samskaras). The
ceremony was performed by a young
man in the brahmacharin (celibate stu-
dent) stage of life and marked the first
time he shaved his beard. According to
tradition, this rite was followed by giving
a gift to the teacher, ideally a cow. By rit-
ualizing his first shave, the keshanta
samskara was a way to mark the young
man’s changing status. After this he was
responsible for remaining clean-shaven,
as one more of the rules for maintaining
ritual purity. In modern times this rite is
no longer observed. See also shaving.
Keshava
([One with] “Flowing Hair”) Epithet of
the god Krishna. See Krishna.
Keshi
In Hindu mythology, Keshi is one of the
assassins sent by Kamsa, the demon-
king of Mathura, in an attempt to kill his
nephew, the child-god Krishna. In the
form of a savage horse, Keshi attacksKhajuraho
Krishna. Krishna easily fends him off
and kills him, earning himself the name
of Keshimanthana, “destroyer of Keshi.”
Keshimanthana
(“destroyer of Keshi”) Epithet of the
god Krishna. Keshi is one of the
demon assassins sent by Krishna’s uncle
Kamsa to kill the child Krishna. Keshi
appears in the form of a horse, but
Krishna easily destroys him, as he does all
the other demons.
Keshini
In Hindu mythology, one of the wives of
King Sagar. Through a sage’s boon,
Keshini and her co-wife Sumati are
given a choice in the number of children
they will bear—one will bear a single son
through whom the lineage will continue,
whereas the other will bear sixty thou-
sand sons who will die before they
have any offspring. Keshini chooses the
former, and through her son
Asamanjasa the line of King Sagar is
preserved. Her descendants are particu-
larly important, since her great-great-
grandson is the sage Bhagirath, who
succeeds in bringing the river Ganges
from heaven to earth.
Ketu
A malevolent “planet” in Hindu astrology
(jyotisha), and was originally the body
of a demon. According to the story, the
gods and the demons join forces to
churn the ocean of milk to obtain the
nectar of immortality. The gods manage
to trick the demons out of their share.
While the gods drink the nectar, the
demon Sainhikeya slips into their midst
in disguise. As the demon begins to
drink, the sun and moon alert Vishnu,
who uses his discus to cut off the
demon’s head. Sainhikeya’s two halves
become immortal, since they have come
into contact with the nectar. The severed
body becomes Ketu, and the severed
head becomes another malevolent
planet, Rahu. Ketu is not regarded as a
physical planet, but as the descending
node of the moon, or the place where it
intersects the ecliptic while passing
southward. Ketu is also associated with
comets and fiery meteors, generally
considered signs of ill omen. See
Tortoise avatar.
Khadga
(“sword”) In Hindu iconography, the
sword is an object associated with a
variety of deities. It carries strong asso-
ciations with Kali, symbolizing the cut-
ting off of her devotees’ (bhakta)
ignorance. Sometimes it is literally used
to cut off heads of the animals sacrificed
to her. The sword is also carried by other
images of the Goddess, including Durga
and Santoshi Ma, as well as certain
images of Shiva and Vishnu.
Khajuraho
Small village in the Chattarpur district of
the northern state of Madhya Pradesh,
renowned for a magnificent collection
of temples built about a thousand years
ago by the Chandella dynasty. It is
unclear why these temples were built in
such an inaccessible place, although its
remote location is believed to have
spared the temples from iconoclasm
during Muslim incursions. The most
famous Hindu temples at the site are the
Kandariya Mahadev, Lakshmana, and
Vishvanath. There are many smaller
temples to other Hindu deities and sev-
eral Jain temples as well.
The temples at Khajuraho were built
in the northern Indian Nagara style. The
building replicates a sacred mountain
with the highest point directly over the
primary image. The outside of the tem-
ples were decorated with sculptural
images, and the most famous of these
depict women in various explicit sexual
encounters. The significance of the erotic
sculptures is much debated. Some claim
that the sculptures sanction carnal plea-
sure as a religious path, while some
interpret them to represent human
union with the divine. Still others view
them as teaching that the desire for
[[365]]
Khandava Forest
pleasure must be transcended to attain
the divine. For further information see
Benjamin Rowland, The Art and
Architecture of India, 1971.
Khandava Forest
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, the Khandava forest
is consumed by Agni, a god whose mate-
rial form is fire itself. According to the
story, Agni becomes sick and is advised
that he can only be healed by eating the
creatures in the Khandava forest, many
of whom are enemies of the gods. Agni
makes seven attempts to “eat” the forest,
but is always thwarted by the storm-god
Indra, who rescues the forest by dousing
it with rain. Agni is perplexed and soli-
cits the help of the god Krishna and his
companion Arjuna, the world’s greatest
archer. To help Agni, Arjuna is given the
Gandiva bow and an inexhaustible
quiver of arrows. When Agni again
begins to burn the forest, Arjuna keeps
off the rain by shooting a flight of
arrows so thick that it forms a canopy
over the forest. In this way Agni is cured
of his illness.
Khandoba
Regional deity worshiped in the central
Indian Deccan region, particularly in
the states of Maharashtra and
Karnataka. Originally believed to be a
local deity, Khandoba is now considered
to be an avatar, or incarnation, of the
god Shiva; he takes this form to destroy
two demons named Mani and Malla.
After killing the demons he is persuaded
to reside at a temple in Jejuri,
Maharashtra, from where his worship
spread
throughout
the
region.
Khandoba is an important popular deity
because he is believed to grant people’s
wishes, particularly in response to vows.

Festival,” in Journal of Asian Studies, Vol.

Khara
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Khara is one of the
brothers of the demon-king Ravana.
With his brother Dushana, Khara tries to
avenge the honor of their sister
Shurpanakha, whose ears and nose
have been cut off by Rama’s brother
Lakshmana. In a fierce battle, Rama
destroys the demon army, killing Khara
and Dushana. Seeing the failure of her
two brothers, Shurpanakha goes to their
brother Ravana to demand vengeance.
Ravana realizes he cannot kill Rama in
battle, but resolves to avenge his sister
by kidnapping Sita, an action which dri-
ves the plot for the latter part of the epic.
Kharoshthi
(“ass-lip”) Name for one of the ancient
scripts used in the inscriptions of the
emperor Ashoka (r. 269–232 B.C.E.), the
greatest figure in the Maurya dynasty.
Ashoka’s empire encompassed all of the
subcontinent (except the deepest parts
of southern India) and parts of modern
Afghanistan. Ashoka’s Rock Edicts and
Pillar Edicts are the earliest significant
Indian written documents, giving
invaluable information about contem-
porary social, political, and religious life.
The Kharoshthi script was used exclu-
sively in the northwestern part of
Ashoka’s empire and was clearly derived
from the Aramaic alphabet used in
Achaeminid Persia. Although the script
was modified to adapt it to the sounds of
Indian languages, it clearly shows
Persian cultural influence. It was far less
pervasive than Brahmi script and had
virtually disappeared from India by the
early centuries of the common era.
Khatvanga
A club or staff topped with a human
skull, it is one of the characteristic
objects in Hindu iconography. At times
the shaft of the staff was made from
another human bone, such as a thigh or
an arm bone. This symbol is most closely
associated with the god Shiva. Its useKirtan
reflects his marginal, uncontrolled
nature and his utter disconnection with
the conventional values of ordinary
society. It is still sometimes carried by
ascetics, for whom Shiva is the model
ascetic, and a paradigm for emulation.
Khetaka
(“shield”) In Hindu iconography, the
shield is associated with a variety of
deities, including the Goddess, Shiva,
and Vishnu. The shield is often found in
images in which the figure carries a
sword (khadga).
as Kindama and his wife are in the form
of deer, King Pandu shoots the copulat-
ing pair with an arrow. In their dying
moments the sage and his wife revert to
their human forms. The sage curses the
horrified Pandu to die the moment he
takes his wife in an amorous embrace.
Since Pandu is childless, he abdicates
the throne in favor of his blind brother
Dhrtarashtra and becomes a celibate
renunciant. Pandu’s wives, Kunti and
Madri, eventually bear children through
magical means. The struggle for
power between their children and
Duryodhana, Dhrtarashtra’s son, is the
epic’s pivotal conflict.
Kichaka
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Kichaka is the brother-
in-law of King Virata. King Virata is host
to the five Pandava brothers (the epic’s
protagonists) during the year that they go
incognito after twelve years of forest
exile. During this time, Kichaka becomes
attracted to Draupadi, the Pandavas’
common wife, who serves as an atten-
dant to one of the royal ladies. Kichaka
continues his advances despite her
protests and strikes her when she tries to
escape. One of Draupadi’s husbands,
Bhima, is livid when he discovers what
has happened. He tells Draupadi to
arrange a secret meeting with Kichaka,
on the pretense of surrendering to his
desires. Bhima disguises himself as
Draupadi and when Kichaka arrives,
Bhima kills him with his bare hands.
Kimpurusha
Another name for the mythical animals
known as Kinnara. See Kinnara.
Kindama
In the Mahabharata, Kindama is a
forest-dwelling sage, whose curse on
King Pandu advances the epic’s plot.
Although celibate in his human form,
Kindama occasionally uses his magic
powers to transform himself and his
wife into animals, so that they can expe-
rience sexual pleasure. On one occasion,
Kinnara
(“What, Man?”) Mythical creatures
described as either having the head of a
horse and the body of a human being, or
the head of a human being and the body
of a horse. The Kinnaras are described as
servants of Kubera, a minor deity.
Kubera is one of the Guardians of the
Directions, a group of eight deities
believed to rule the cardinal and inter-
mediate directions. He is the ruler over
the northern direction, and thus identi-
fied as living in the Himalayas, where
the Kinnaras also live. The Kinnaras are
usually considered identical to the
mythical creatures known as the
Kimpurushas.
Kiritamakuta
A high crown, sometimes topped with
a knob, studded with jewels and
other ornamentation. In Hindu iconog-
raphy the kiritamakuta is associated
with the god Vishnu, particularly in
his manifestation as Narayana. For
Vishnu, the kingly imagery conveyed by
this crown reinforces his claim to be
ruler of the universe.
Kirtan
(“repeating”) A type of devotional
singing or chanting of short verses
which are usually different renditions of
the divine name. This is often done in a
[[367]]
Kirtimukha
Ruins of the Sun Temple in Konarak. Built during the Ganga dynasty,
the temple was designed in the shape of the chariot believed to carry the sun.
call and response fashion—the leader
sings one line, and the listeners repeat it.
The primary emphasis in this rite is the
repetition of the divine name. As the
identifying mark of the divinity, the
Name is believed to contain the divine
power, benefiting those who hear it as
well as those who speak it. Kirtan is
especially popular among the devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, who histor-
ically have put greater stress on the the-
ology of the Name. Kirtan is a common
activity during congregational meetings
known as satsang, the “company of
good people,” believed to have benefi-
cial spiritual effects on those who take
part in them.
Kirtimukha
(“mask of glory”) In Indian architecture,
a kirtimukha is a decorative motif in the
form of a devouring leonine monster. It
often appears as the main decorative
element on a temple tower or as a pro-
tective element over doorways.
Kishkindha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the
two great Indian epics, Kishkindha is a
[[368]]

forest-kingdom ruled by monkeys. The
monkey-king, Bali, rules when Rama
(the epic’s protagonist) first comes to
Kishkindha with his brother, Lakshmana,
searching for Rama’s kidnapped wife
Sita. Bali is killed by Rama, and is suc-
ceeded by his brother Sugriva, Rama’s
ally. Sugriva sends his subjects on a
wide-ranging search for Sita. One of
them, Hanuman, eventually discovers
her being held prisoner on Lanka.
Kitawara
One of four major organizational groups
of the Dashanami Sanyasis, renunciant
ascetics who are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva; the other three
divisions are Bhuriwara, Bhogawara,
and Anandawara. Each of these
groups has its headquarters in one of
the four monastic centers (maths)
supposedly established by philosopher
Shankaracharya. Each of the groups
are associated with one of the four
Vedas, one of the “great utterances”
(mahavakyas) expressing the ultimate
truth, a particular ascetic quality, and
several of the ten Dashanami divisions.
The Kitawara group is affiliated with the
Sharada math in Dwaraka, and is thusKota
connected with the western quarter of
India. The Kitawara’s Veda is the Sama
Veda. Their mahavakya is “tattvamasi”
(“That thou art”) and their ascetic quality
is to eat very little. The Dashanami
divisions associated with this group are
Tirtha and Ashrama.
Koil
(also known as Koyal) One of the names
for the Indian cuckoo. See cuckoo.
Kokila
One of the names for the Indian cuckoo.
See cuckoo.
Konarak
Village on the Bay of Bengal in the state
of Orissa, about forty miles east of the
state capital, Bhubaneshvar. Konarak is
famous for its Sun Temple. Now in
ruins, the temple was built by king
Narasimhadeva (r. 1238–1264), a
monarch in the Ganga dynasty. The
entire temple was intended to be a like-
ness of the sun’s chariot. Twelve great
wheels were carved on the sides at the
temple’s lowest level; in front of the tem-
ple are statues of several colossal horses.
As at Khajuraho, the temple’s lower lev-
els are covered with erotic carvings, giv-
ing rise to diverse interpretations: Some
claim the carvings sanction carnal plea-
sure as a religious path, while some
interpret them allegorically as repre-
senting human union with the divine.
Others view them as teaching that the
desire for pleasure must ultimately be
transcended to attain the divine.
The temple was built on a massive
scale. According to one estimate, the
massive central spire would have been
over 200 feet high. It is uncertain
whether this spire was ever completed,
since the sandy soil at its base would
have been unable to support the weight
of such an enormous structure. This
unstable soil has been the greatest
contributor to the temple’s increasing
deterioration. The primary structure left
at the site is the jagamohan (assembly
hall). During the nineteenth century,
the hall was filled with sand in an
effort to prevent further collapse. For
further information see Roy Craven,
Indian Art, 1997.
Konkanastha
Another name for the brahmin commu-
nity of the Chitpavan, a name that signi-
fies their historical home on the Konkan
coastline in the states of Goa and
Maharashtra. See Chitpavan.
Korravai
Fierce form of the Goddess, worshiped
in southern India and originally
believed to have been an autochtho-
nous (“of the land”) deity. Korravai is
associated with the hunt and the battle-
field, and thus with blood, death, and
carnage. Perhaps because of these asso-
ciations, she was later identified with
other fierce manifestations of the
Mother Goddess, particularly the god-
dess Kali.
Koshala
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, this is the name of
the region along the banks of the river
Sarayu in which Rama’s father, King
Dasharatha rules.
Kota
City on the Chambal River in the mod-
ern state of Rajasthan, about 100 miles
south of Jaipur. Before India’s indepen-
dence, Kota was the capital of a small
kingdom with the same name. Kota was
one of the centers of the Rajasthani
style of miniature painting, a genre
used to depict Hindu religious themes,
particularly incidents in the life of
Krishna. The Kota style is considered a
derivative of the Bundi style because
Kota was ruled by a junior member of
the Bundi royal family. Both styles are
marked by their attention to nature,
shown by detailed depictions of trees
surrounding the paintings’ subjects. The
[[369]]
Kratu
Kota style is marked by elements of the
landscape looming out of proportion,
giving the pictures a lush feel. For fur-
ther information see W. G. Archer,
Indian Painting, 1957; and Indian
Painting in Bundi and Kotah, 1959.
Kratu
In Hindu mythology, one of the six
sons of Brahma, all of whom become
great sages. All are “mind-born,” mean-
ing that Brahma’s thoughts are enough
to bring them into being. The other five
sages are Marichi, Angiras, Pulastya,
Pulaha, and Atri.
Krauncha (“Curlew”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography,
Krauncha is the fifth of the seven con-
centric landmasses (dvipas) making up
the visible world. See also cosmology.
Kraunchanishadana
(“curlew-sitting”) One of the sitting pos-
tures (asanas) described in commen-
taries to the Yoga Sutras. The Yoga
Sutras are attributed to the sage
Patanjali and give the earliest instruc-
tion of yoga. The Kraunchanishadana
posture begins in dandasana or “stick-
posture,” in which one sits with the
upper body erect, the arms straight with
the hands flat on the ground and point-
ing forward, and the legs outstretched.
From this posture one of the legs is folded
back to the outside, with the heel
pressed against the outer thigh. The
other leg is raised straight up and
pressed against the torso, with the
hands clasped at the bottom of the foot.
Krishna
Hindu deity usually considered as the
eighth avatar or incarnation of the god
Vishnu; in certain religious contexts,
however, as in the Gitagovinda, he is
described as the ultimate deity and the
source of all the avatars. In either case,
Krishna is one of the major deities in the
modern Hindu pantheon. Part of his
[[370]]

popularity may stem from the extraordi-
nary breadth of his manifestations,
allowing his devotees (bhakta) to wor-
ship him in many different ways. His
earliest appearance comes in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics, where he is a friend and
adviser to the five Pandava brothers
who are the epic’s protagonists. His epic
portrayal is highly complex, and his
character is not always truthful or good.
He is a regal king and heroic warrior, a
cunning opponent, and a Machiavellian
politician with his own underlying
agenda. Here Krishna plays the role of
a trickster, although late in the story,
in the section of the epic known as
the Bhagavad Gita, he eventually drops
the mask to reveal himself as the
supreme deity.
The later sectarian literature, partic-
ularly the Harivamsha and the
Bhagavata Purana, virtually ignore
this exalted, royal figure, preferring to
concentrate on Krishna’s birth, child-
hood, and adolescence. This latter
stratum of Krishna’s mythology has
been clearly imposed on the earlier,
heroic image, rendering Krishna a char-
acter with unusual mythic depth.
Religiously speaking, the image of
Krishna as child and lover has been far
more important than the stern and
somewhat amoral hero.
The characters in the story of
Krishna’s life, including his parents,
friends, and companions, are not aware
of his divinity, and throughout the story
they confront many surprises and bewil-
dering events. However, none of these
plot twists surprise the readers, since
they are aware that all of the characters
are taking part in Krishna’s divine play
(lila). According to tradition, Krishna is
the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva.
He is born in a prison in the city of
Mathura, where his parents have been
confined by his uncle, the wicked king
Kamsa. On Devaki’s wedding day, a
divine voice warns Kamsa that her
eighth child will eventually kill him. In
an effort to forestall this prophecy, he
puts the couple in prison, and kills all ofKrishna
Devaki’s children as soon as they are
born. Kamsa intends to do the same
with Krishna, but when Krishna is born,
a deep sleep falls on all the jailers, the
locked prison doors are miraculously
opened, and Vasudeva is able to spirit
the infant out of the prison to the home
of his foster parents, Nanda and
Yashoda. Vasudeva returns that night,
bearing Yashoda’s newborn baby girl,
who is really Bhadrakali, the Goddess,
in disguise. The next morning Kamsa
kills the child by dashing it against a
stone. From the body arises the Goddess,
who taunts Kamsa, telling him that the
person who will slay him has escaped.
Krishna lives happily at Nanda and
Yashoda’s home. His mythic images
from that early time stress either his per-
sona as the adorable child or unexpected
feats of strength and heroism. As an
infant he is placed under a cart, which
he strikes with his foot and kicks into the
air; he also slays a variety of demon
assassins sent by his uncle Kamsa, most
notably Putana, Keshi, and Trnavarta.
During all these feats his companions
are amazed but never realize that divin-
ity is in their midst. Nor, for that matter,
do his foster parents. In one story
Yashoda looks in Krishna’s mouth when
he has been eating some dirt and sees
the entire universe inside it. Through
the workings of Krishna’s power of illu-
sion (maya), she immediately forgets
the whole incident. The themes of for-
getfulness and hidden divinity are cen-
tral to Krishna’s childhood mythology.
The people in Braj treat Krishna with
easy familiarity, because they are
unaware of his true identity. Krishna is
said to prefer this sort of natural interac-
tion over all other worship.
As a boy Krishna becomes known for
his mischief, particularly his penchant
for stealing butter from the gopis (milk-
maids), although when he is caught he
can usually manage to charm his way
out of punishment. His adolescence is
marked by two heroic episodes—driving
off the serpent Kaliya, and defeating the
storm-god Indra by holding up Mt.
Depiction of Krishna, an incarnation
of the god Vishnu.
Govardhan—and by the development of
his persona as a lover. On moonlit,
autumn nights, he plays his flute Murali
on the banks of the Yamuna River.
Hearing its irresistible call, the village
women rush to meet him, whiling away
the night in the circle dance known as
the ras lila. Although she is not men-
tioned in the earliest texts, Radha
appears as Krishna’s special companion
and consort, symbolizing the relation-
ship between deity and devotee using
the imagery of lover and beloved.
Some parts of Krishna’s mythology
relate episodes from later in his life,
including his return to Mathura, the
slaying of Kamsa, taking his rightful
place as ruler, and marrying Rukmini
and a host of other wives. The earlier
strands of his mythic identity—the king,
hero, and cunning diplomat portrayed
in the Mahabharata—can be tied in
here, to make it seem like the account of
a single life. Some of the most poignant
devotional (bhakti) poetry details the
exchange between Krishna’s female
devotees, the gopis, and Uddhava,
Krishna’s companion sent back from
[[371]]
Krishnadas
Mathura. Uddhava reassures them that
Krishna is the indwelling God and is
omnipresent. For the gopis, this abstract
concept is a poor substitute for the
sweet boy they know so well. Their
attention remains focused on the
charming child of Braj, who never grows
up, never grows old, and who invites his
devotees to share his world.
The worship of Krishna emphasizes
relationship and communion, both
with the deity and one another. In the
most elaborate forms of worship,
Krishna’s devotees envision themselves
as entering Krishna’s world and spend-
ing the day doing the ordinary activities
of a village cowhand, such as getting up,
eating, taking the cows to pasture,
and bringing home the cows. Some
devotional manuals give detailed daily
calendars, for which the devotees
can visualize themselves going to par-
ticular places and doing particular
things at certain times—building a rela-
tionship with God through sharing the
mundane parts of everyday life.
Another common practice is communal
singing, usually collections of the divine
names known as kirtans, as a way to
build relationships and communion
among the devotees.
Another feature of Krishna’s charac-
ter and worship is the notion of lila or
“play.” As David R. Kinsley points out,
the infant Krishna dispatches the demon
assassins as a form of play, and they
never pose any serious threat. His rela-
tionship with the people of Braj is also a
sort of play. He comes as the divine pres-
ence in their midst, but keeps them
completely unaware of this, occasional-
ly hinting at it through his wondrous
deeds, but unwilling to ruin their natur-
al interactions with him by revealing
their difference in status. In the same
way, he is believed to be active in the
lives of his devotees, always present, but
dropping only teasing hints of his pres-
ence. Finally, lila is the name for a series
of dramas performed during the mon-
soon season in the town of Brindavan.
These productions, known as the ras lila,
are not mere drama but combine both
[[372]]

liturgy and drama. Krishna and his com-
panions are played by local brahmin
boys. While in costume, the boys are
believed to have become the characters
they portray. Part of the program is wor-
ship. The players, known as svarups
(“own-forms”), gather on stage to give
darshan to the audience. The most
common religious act in modern popu-
lar Hinduism, darshan allows direct eye
contact between the devotee and the
image of a deity, which is considered to
be a conscious, perceiving being. The
second part of the program is the lila, a
rendition of some episode in Krishna’s
mythology. The audience participates
by virtue of its presence, making
Krishna’s lila part of present-day experi-
ence by performing or attending these
productions. Given his stature as a
Hindu deity, there are many works on
Krishna. For further information see
Milton Singer (ed.), Krishna, 1966; David
R. Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute,

; Barbara Stoller Miller, The Love
Song of the Dark Lord, 1977; and John
Stratton Hawley, Krishna: The Butter
Thief, 1983. See also Vaishnavism.
Krishnadas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions
of these eight poets were used for
liturgical purposes by the Pushti
Marg, a religious community of devo-
tees (bhakta) of Krishna. In the
Pushti Marg’s sectarian literature, all
eight are also named as members of
the community and as associates of
either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor
Vitthalnath. Traditionally, Krishnadas
is associated with Vallabhacharya. Little
is known about Krishnadas, although
traditional accounts hold that he was
born in 1497. His poetry describes the
physical beauty of Krishna as an object
of aesthetic enjoyment. Within the
Pushti Marg, he is remembered as a
capable administrator and a defender of
the sect’s interests in Brindavan,Krishnamishra
Krishna’s childhood home, against the
followers of Chaitanya.
Krishnadas Kaviraj
Author of the most influential version of
the Chaitanya-Charitramrta (“Nectar
of Chaitanya’s Deeds”), an account of
the life of the Bengali poet-saint
Chaitanya, written about ninety years
after Chaitanya’s death. Krishnadas’s
text is the latest and most developed
biography of Chaitanya and focuses
mainly on Chaitanya’s later life, particu-
larly his visit to Brindavan, the northern
Indian village were the god Krishna
is supposed to have spent his
childhood. This text is marked by the
philosophical influence of the three
Goswamis—Rupa, Sanatana, and
Jiva—whose ideas played a major role in
shaping Chaitanya’s religious followers,
the Gaudiya Vaishnavas. As with the
other traditional accounts of Chaitanya’s
life, this text does not purport to give
an “objective” biography, it is rather
a hagiography (an idealizing and
idolizing portrait) written by a
passionate devotee (bhakta).
Krishna Deva Raya
(r. 1509–1530) Most important ruler in
the Vijayanagar dynasty, the last of the
great southern Hindu kingdoms.
During his rule, Vijayanagar reached its
zenith. Krishna Deva Raya defeated the
Deccani sultans to the north, although
he reinstated them as vassals. He con-
quered the eastern coast all the way to
Orissa and maintained good trading
relationships with the newly-arrived
Portuguese, although he refused to
become involved in their politics. His
reign was a time of artistic achieve-
ment and general prosperity, evident
in the artifacts of the time. His succes-
sors were not as successful, however.
Less than forty years after his death,
the coalition of the Deccani sultans
defeated Rama Raja at the battle of
Talikota. The Vijayanagar kingdom was
completely destroyed.
Krishna Janam Bhumi
Site in the city of Mathura believed to
mark the spot where the god Krishna
was born. The present temple was com-
pleted in the 1960s, but the site itself is
very old. One of the most religiously
volatile sites in all of India, the new tem-
ple abuts the Shahi Idgah, a mosque
built on the base of an earlier Krishna
temple. According to one tradition,
Muslim iconoclasts destroyed four suc-
cessive temples at the spot now occu-
pied by the mosque, marking the exact
location of Krishna’s birth. This claim
seems doubtful since the mosque was
built in 1661, and the temple it is said to
have replaced was destroyed by the
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb in 1669. In
the 1980s the Krishna Janam Bhumi was
one of the three sites selected by the
activist Vishva Hindu Parishad to be
reclaimed as a Hindu holy place, along
with the Vishvanath temple in Benares,
and Ayodhya’s Ram Janam Bhumi. In
all of these places, mosques were
claimed to have been built on the site of
an important Hindu temple, although
only the first two have historical evi-
dence that this occurred. During the
[[1990]]
s there have been several cam-
paigns to reclaim the Krishna Janam
Bhumi, but to this point the campaigns
have generated little support. Given the
popular backlash after the 1992 destruc-
tion of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the
government has been far more restric-
tive on the activities it allows at such dis-
puted sites. For further information see

Nationalist Movement in India, 1996.

Krishnamishra
(late 11th c.) Author of the Sanskrit
drama Prabodhachandrodaya (“Rising
of the moon of wisdom”), an allegory
celebrating the triumph of Vaishnava
piety. The play is noted for the third act,
in which four representatives of non-
Vaishnava sects appear: a materialist; a
Jain monk; a Buddhist monk; and a
Kapalika, a member of an ascetic
[[373]]
Krishnamurti, Jiddu
community who worshiped the god
Shiva. The last is portrayed as depraved,
indulging in meat, wine, and sexual
gratification, as well as having a
penchant for violence. Although the
reader may safely assume that this is a
biased perspective, it is instructive in
the attitudes it reveals toward ascetics
and all non-Vaishnava religious groups.
Krishnamurti, Jiddu
(1895–1986) Modern Indian thinker
whose teachings centered on the neces-
sity for personal realization through
critical self-awareness. His teaching had
strong roots in his own life experience.
When he was fourteen years old, one of
the leaders of the Theosophical Society,
Annie Besant, proclaimed him to be an
incarnation of the future Buddha
Maitreya. He later repudiated these
claims, and for the rest of his life
stressed the need to examine and
question all authority, including
himself. Much of his life was spent in
Europe and the United States, where his
books and lectures found their primary
audience. For further information see
Pupul Jayakar, Krishnamurti: A
Biography, 1986.
Krishna Paksha
The dark or waning half of a lunar month.
Krishna River
River running from west to east in south
central India. Its headwaters lie in
Maharashtra on the inland side of the
Western Ghats. It meanders through
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, forti-
fied by the Bhima River and the
Tungabhadra River, before entering the
sea in the Bay of Bengal. The temple of
the god Vithoba in the town of
Pandharpur, considered the most
important sacred site (tirtha) on the
whole river, lies on the Bhima River.

Krittikas
In Hindu mythology, the Krittikas are a
group of six minor goddesses who are
the personification of the constellation
Pleiades. Their important mythic
appearance is as the foster mothers of
the god Skanda. Skanda is considered
the son of the god Shiva, but is born in
an unusual way. When Shiva and Parvati
are disturbed while making love, Shiva
inadvertently spills his semen on the
ground. In Indian culture semen is seen
as a man’s concentrated essence.
Because he is a deity, Shiva’s semen is
inordinately powerful, capable of
destroying the earth. The semen is first
held by the god Agni, who is fire person-
ified, but it proves too powerful for him.
Agni puts the semen in the river Ganges.
After 10,000 years, a shining child is dis-
covered in the reeds along the riverbank.
The child is discovered by the Krittikas,
each of whom wants to nurse him. To
oblige them, the child Skanda grows five
extra heads. As a mark of their care, one
of his epithets is Karttikeya.
Krpacharya
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Krpacharya is a
famous archer who teaches both the
Pandavas and the Kauravas, the two
competing families in the epic.
Krpacharya is a supporter of the
Kaurava leader Duryodhana. During
the year the Pandavas spend in hiding,
he sends spies to try to find them. In the
Mahabharata war he fights on the side
of the Kauravas. His most important act
is setting fire to the Pandava camp dur-
ing the night attack following the
Pandava victory. All those trying to flee
the flames are killed. After the war he
stays for some time at the court of
Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother,
but later renounces the world to live in
the forest.Kshatriya
Krta Yuga
A particular age of the world in one of
the reckonings of cosmic time.
According to traditional belief, time has
neither beginning nor end, but alter-
nates between cycles of creation and
activity, followed by cessation and qui-
etude. Each of these cycles lasts for 4.32
billion years; the active phase is known
as the Day of Brahma, and the quiet
phase as the Night of Brahma. In one
reckoning of cosmic time, the Day of
Brahma is divided into one thousand
mahayugas (“great cosmic ages”), each
of which lasts for 4.32 million years.
Each mahayuga is composed of four
constituent yugas, named the Krta Yuga,
Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali
Yuga. Each of these four yugas is shorter
than its predecessor and ushers in an
era more degenerate and depraved than
the preceding one. By the end of the Kali
Yuga, things have gotten so bad that the
only solution is the destruction and
recreation of the earth, at which time
the next Krta era begins.
The Krta Yuga is the first of the four
yugas, and at 1,728,000 years, it is by far
the longest. It is also considered to be
the best of all the yugas, symbolized by
gold, the most valuable of all metals. In a
dice game played in ancient India, the
side designated Krta was the one for the
winning throw, representing the best
possible option. In the mythic descrip-
tions of the Krta Yuga, people live
extremely long times, are of tremendous
physical stature, and by nature, are com-
pletely virtuous.
Kshanika (“momentary”) Linga
A type of linga, the pillar-shaped object
symbolizing the god Shiva. A kshanika
linga is temporarily made for immediate
worship, from whatever materials are at
hand—whether earth, sand, grain, but-
ter, or any other substance that can be
heaped and molded. This use of tempo-
rary images reveals an important aspect
of Hindu religious life—that although
God is everywhere, many human beings
tend to work better when they have a

from Maharashtra to the Bay of Bengal.
concrete focus for their religious atten-
tion. This being so, God deigns to come
into the humblest objects, if they are
created with him (or her) in mind.
Kshatriya
In traditional Hindu social theory, the
kshatriyas were the second most influ-
ential of the four major social groups
(varnas). The kshatriyas’ function was
ruling, protecting, and creating social
order so that the other varnas could
carry out their tasks. This image is
reflected in the creation story known as
the Purusha Sukta. The kshatriyas are
described as being created from the
Primeval Man’s shoulders and associat-
ed with strength and power. In actual
practice, the kshatriya varna may have
been the most permeable of all, since
any person with the power to rule was
usually given de facto kshatriya status,
which could be solidified by a fictitious
genealogy in the following generations.
Perhaps the best example of this phe-
nomenon is the subgroup known as the
Rajputs (“king’s sons”), who at varying
[[375]]
Kshemaraja
times ruled large sections of northern
and western India, but whose origins are
unclear and obscure.
Kshemaraja
(11th c.) Kshemaraja was the primary
disciple of Abhinavagupta, the
Kashmiri writer famous for his works on
poetics and aesthetics, and a pivotal fig-
ure in the development of Trika
Shaivism. Based on a tantric philoso-
phy, Trika Shaivism states that the sole
true reality is the god Shiva, who is both
supreme god and the source of the ema-
nations that constitute the material of
the universe. Final liberation of the soul
(moksha) comes through a process of
“recognition” (pratyabhijna) in which
one realizes that the entire universe is
all a manifestation of Shiva alone.
Here one “recognizes” something that
has always been true, but until that
time has been obscured by a mistaken
understanding. Kshemaraja contin-
ued the development of the Trika
school. His most famous work is the
Svacchandatantra. See also tantra.
Kubera
In Hindu mythology, a minor deity who
is one of the eight Guardians of the
Directions, serving as guardian over the
northern quarter. Kubera is said to live
in the Himalaya mountains, where he is
served by mythical creatures such as
yakshas, nagas, and kinnaras. He is
enormously fat, and because of all the
mineral wealth contained in the moun-
tains, he is enormously wealthy. Kubera
is the half-brother of the demon-king of
Lanka, Ravana, and Kumbhakarna and
Vibhishana. All four are sons of the
demigod Vishravas, but Kubera has a
different mother. Despite their relation-
ship, Ravana steals Kubera’s aerial chariot,
the Pushpak Viman. Because of
Ravana’s notorious misdeeds, Kubera
supports the god-king Rama’s efforts to
conquer Ravana.
[[376]]

Kubja
(“hunchback”) In the mythology of the
god Krishna, Kubja is a hunchbacked
woman whom Krishna meets while
journeying to the city of Mathura to
reclaim his kingdom. Kubja carries a jar
of expensive salve that is meant for the
king, but when Krishna asks her for
some, she willingly gives it to him. As a
reward for her generosity and devotion,
Krishna straightens her spine, turning
her into a gorgeous young woman.
Kuchela
(“badly dressed”) Another name for
Sudama, one of the god Krishna’s child-
hood friends. See Sudama.
Kuchipudi
One of the classical dance forms of
India; some of the others are
Bharatanatyam,
Kathak,
Orissi,
Kathakali, and Manipuri. Like much of
traditional Indian culture, classical
dance shows strong regional identifica-
tion; Kuchipudi is primarily found in
Andhra Pradesh. As with much of
Indian dance, Kuchipudi has its roots in
religious life. It was developed in the vil-
lage of Kuchipudi as part of a religious
festival. The Maharaja of Golconda was
so pleased with the dance that he
awarded the village as a gift to the brah-
min families there, with the condition
that they continue to nurture the art,
which their descendants have done.
Stylistically, the dance shows the influ-
ence of Bharatanatyam, and like all
Indian dance, it shows the well-developed
vocabulary of gesture that is drawn from
the classical manuals. At the same time,
the form is softer and less geometric
than Bharatanatyam, showing the
influence of folk traditions. The lan-
guage for the dance-dramas is Telegu,
reflecting the local culture. As with all
classical dances, Kuchipudi has under-
gone certain changes in the past gener-
ation, spurred by the shift to stage
performance as the dance’s primary
venue. One of the most significantKumarasambhava
changes has been to open the dance to
women. For further information see
Mohan Khokar, Traditions of Indian
Classical Dance, 1984.
Kulachara
(“family practice”) Any religious practice
restricted to a family, either a group of
blood relatives or people sharing a com-
mon religious or sectarian lineage. The
authority given to kulachara allows for
almost infinite variation in religious
practice, particularly in the absence of
any established religious hierarchy
which has the authority to render judg-
ments on such practices. For most
Hindus, such family practice is the pre-
dominant influence shaping their indi-
vidual religious lives.
Kuladevata
(“family deity”) The particular deity
worshiped by a family, whether this
“family” be blood relatives, or people
who share the same religious lineage,
sect, or region. In most cases, the
kuladevata will be one’s primary deity.
Kulashekhara
(9th c.) One of the Alvars, a group of
twelve poet-saints who lived in southern
India between the seventh and tenth
centuries. All the Alvars were devotees
(bhakta) of the god Vishnu, emphasiz-
ing passionate devotion (bhakti) to a
personal god, conveyed through hymns
sung in the Tamil language. According
to tradition, Kulashekhara was the king
of the Travancore region in modern
Kerala. His religious commitment grew
so strong that he eventually abdicated
his throne. For further information see
Kamil Zvelebil, Tamil Literature, 1975;
and John Stirling Morley Hooper, Hymns
of the Alvars, 1929.
Kulu
The most important city in the Kulu
Valley in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
The city of Kulu is famous for its
Dussehra festival. Dussehra celebrates
the victory of the god Rama over the
demon-king Ravana; it is a celebration
of the victory of good over evil. Kulu’s
festival centers around the figure of
Rama from the Raghunathji temple in
the nearby village of Dhalpur. When
Rama is brought to the festival site in his
temple car, he is celebrated by hundreds
of deities who have come from temples
up and down the Kulu Valley, as well as
the people who have gathered to see the
deities and the spectacle of their proces-
sion. The deities’ actions are carefully
choreographed according to well-estab-
lished rituals.
Kumara
(“youth”) Epithet of the god Skanda,
who is usually portrayed in the form of a
young boy. See Skanda.
Kumara Gupta I
(r. 415–454) The fourth important ruler
of the Gupta dynasty, who managed to
keep his northern Indian empire intact
for most of his reign. At the end of his
reign, he had to contend with incursions
in the west by the central Asians, known
as the Hunas. While in battle with them,
he was killed. Pressure from the Hunas
continued in the years following
Kumara Gupta’s death and was one of
the important factors causing the even-
tual collapse of the Gupta empire sever-
al generations later.
Kumarapala
(r. 1143–1172) Jaina king of the
Chalukya dynasty in Gujarat, who was
so committed to nonviolence that he
imposed heavy fines on people who
killed fleas and other vermin.
Kumarasambhava
(“Birth of the Prince”) One of the
finest poetic works written by Kalidasa,
who is generally considered the
greatest classical Sanskrit poet. The
Kumarasambhava is an epic poem
[[377]]
Kumarila
based on a mythological theme. It
begins by describing the ascendancy of
a demon named Taraka, who receives a
divine boon that he can only be killed by
a son of Shiva. The poem describes the
extended courtship of Shiva and
Parvati, their marriage, and ends with
an account of their lovemaking. The text
ends before the birth of the god Skanda,
who in other mythical accounts of this
tale kills Taraka. This abrupt ending has
led some interpreters to consider the
play unfinished. Others simply view
these later events as a foregone conclu-
sion, by which the poet does not waste
his hearers’ time.
Kumarila
In Indian philosophy, one of the two
great seventh-century commentators of
the Mimamsa philosophy, one of the six
schools of Hindu philosophy; the other
great commentator was Prabhakara.
The Mimamsa school was most con-
cerned with the examination and pur-
suit of dharma (“righteous action”), for
which members believed all necessary
instructions were contained in the
Vedas, the oldest Hindu religious texts.
Consequently, much of Mimamsa
thought is concerned with principles
and methods of textual interpretation to
uncover and interpret the Vedic instruc-
tions. Although both Kumarila and
Prabhakara were committed to discov-
ering the boundaries of dharma by
interpreting the Vedas, there are signifi-
cant differences in their philosophical
positions, which show up most clearly in
their theories of error.
Prabhakara begins with the assump-
tion, similar to the Nyaya concept of
inherence (samavaya), that there is a
relatively
weak
correspondence
between an object and its attributes. An
example of this would be the relation of
the color red to a particular ball, such
that the ball is said to be red. According
to Prabhakara, false beliefs result from
akhyati (“nondiscrimination”). This
occurs when a person observes two dif-
ferent things with the same attributes
[[378]]

and concludes that they are the same.
Kumarila is closer to the bhedabhada
(“identity and difference”) philosophical
position, which holds that all things
have both identity and difference with
all other things. Kumarila explains error
as viparitakhyati (“contrary percep-
tion”), in which one mistakenly pairs up
the similarities between two things,
rather than noting their differences. For
example, a person mistakenly believes
that a shell with a silvery color is actual-
ly a piece of silver because he or she
chooses to focus on the similarities
between the shell and silver rather than
the differences. People are impelled to
make these choices by karmic forma-
tions, such as greed for silver.
Kumbhadas
(early 16th c.) One of the ashtachap, a
group of eight northern Indian bhakti
(devotional) poets. The compositions of
these poets were used for liturgical purpos-
es by the Pushti Marg, a religious commu-
nity whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of Krishna. In the Pushti Marg’s sectarian
literature, all eight poets are named as
members of the community and as associ-
ates of either the community’s founder,
Vallabhacharya, or his successor, Vitthal-
nath. Kumbhadas is traditionally associat-
ed with Vallabhacharya. Little is known
about Kumbhadas, although it is believed
that he was born in 1469. His poetry
describes the five modes of devotion
described by Rupa Goswami, particularly
the mode known as madhurya (“hon-
eyed”). Madhurya describes the relation-
ship between deity and devotee, using the
language of lover and beloved, in which
each has passionate love for the other.
Kumbhakarna
(“Pitcher-eared”) In the Ramayana, the
earlier of the two great Indian epics,
Kumbhakarna is the brother of Ravana,
the demon ruler of Lanka. As his name
indicates, his dominant facial feature
is his prominent ears. Kumbhakarna is
a reincarnation of Vijaya, Vishnu’sKumbha Mela
gatekeeper, who has been cursed to be
reborn three times as a demon, killed
by the god Vishnu each time.
Kumbhakarna and his brothers have
performed harsh asceticism (tapas) in
their youth to gain boons from the gods.
When the god Brahma finally comes to
give him boons, Kumbhakarna means to
demand “nirdevatvam” (that he cannot
be conquered by any of the gods). At the
critical moment he is foiled by the god-
dess Saraswati, who has power over
speech. She dances on his tongue and
confuses his speech, causing him to
request “nidravatvam” (sleepiness).
Because of this slip of his tongue,
Kumbhakarna will sleep for six months
at a time, wake up to gorge himself with
food and drink for a short time, and then
fall asleep again. Some of the dramatic
tension in the battle portions of the
Ramayana pertains to the violent efforts
to rouse Kumbhakarna, so that he can
take part in the battle. Once awakened
he fights valiantly, but is eventually
killed by Rama.
As is true for all the demons,
Kumbhakarna is not wholly evil. Before
engaging in battle with Rama’s army,
he rebukes Ravana for kidnapping
Rama’s wife, Sita. He also notes that as
the younger brother it is his duty to
uphold the family honor. Here we find
the demon Kumbhakarna upholding
idealized Indian family values—the
younger brother is supposed to sup-
port and defend his elder brother’s
interests as a way to keep the family
intact. This same virtue is in Rama’s
younger brothers, Lakshmana and
Bharata. Despite their enmity, the
epic’s “heroes” and “villains” have sig-
nificant shared values.
Kumbhakonam
One of the many temple-towns in the
Tanjore district of the state of Tamil
Nadu, reflecting the district’s impor-
tance as the home of the Chola dynasty
kings. Kumbhakonam has several large
temples. Built in the Dravida architec-
tural style, the temple buildings are of
modest height, cover an immensely
large area, and are surrounded by a
boundary wall with massive towers
(gopurams) over each wall’s central
gateway. Kumbhakonam’s most famous
site is not a temple, but a temple bathing
(snana) tank. A festival is held at the
tank every twelve years, at which time
the water in the tank is believed to
become the Ganges. An estimated
[[400]]
,000 people attended this event in
[[1992]]
; tragically, forty-eight people were
killed in a stampede. Outside the town is
the Swami Malai temple, one of the six
temples to the god Skanda.
Kumbha Mela
(“Festival of the Pot”) A religious festival
celebrated in four different locations:
Haridwar, Allahabad, Ujjain, and
Nasik. The first two sites are by far the
most important, with Allahabad consid-
ered the holiest of all. Attendance at
these festivals is great. In 1998, ten mil-
lion people were in Haridwar on the cli-
mactic day. Both of these sites also host
an Ardha (“half”) Kumbha Mela, gener-
ally six years after the full Kumbha Mela,
which are smaller in scale, but can still
draw millions of pilgrims. At Ujjain and
Nasik, the full Kumbha Melas are not as
well attended than at the other two sites.
The Kumbha Mela is a bathing
(snana) festival; it is for this reason
that all the Mela sites are found near
rivers. The Kumbha Mela’s primary
actors are ascetics from all over South
Asia who come to bathe in the sacred
waters. According to tradition, the
Kumbha Mela was organized by the
great philosopher Shankaracharya to
promote regular gatherings of
learned and holy men, as a means to
strengthen, sustain, and spread
Hindu religious beliefs. The Kumbha
Mela is also a time for these ascetics
to display their status vis-à-vis one
another. At each site, the order in
which the different ascetic sects
bathe is strictly enforced—the most
important sects bathe first. In more
recent times, this order has been
[[379]]
Kumbha Mela
The bathing procession in Haridwar during the Kumbha Mela festival.
The differing ascetic orders proceed toward the holy waters according to a traditionally sanctioned order.
enforced by the government. In earlier
times, it was the subject of much dispute,
often degenerating into armed conflict as
different ascetic sects vied with one
another for the place of pride.
The time for each Kumbha Mela fes-
tival is determined astrologically, based
on the positions of the planet Jupiter,
the sun, and the moon. The Mela is held
at Haridwar when Jupiter is in Aquarius
(Kumbha) and the sun enters Aries; at
Allahabad when Jupiter is in Taurus and
the sun and moon are in Capricorn; at
Ujjain when Jupiter is in Leo and the full
moon appears in the lunar month of
Baisakh; and at Nasik when Jupiter is in
Leo during the lunar month of Shravan.
These alignments occur about every
twelve years.
The charter myth for the Kumbha
Mela is taken from the story of Churning
the Ocean of Milk. After the ocean has
been churned and the nectar of immor-
tality (amrta) has been extracted, the
gods and their demon opponents begin
to quarrel over the pot of nectar. The
gods snatch the pot and make off with
it, but the person carrying the pot
[[380]]

grows tired, and in twelve days of carry-
ing it sets it on the ground four times—
namely, at the four sites where the Mela
is held. In each place a bit of the
nectar splashes on the ground,
sanctifying the site. According to popu-
lar belief, at each Kumbha Mela’s most
propitious moment, the waters in which
people are bathing become the nectar
of immortality, and all those who
bathe in these waters gain immeasur-
able religious merit.
Kumbha Mela is considered the
largest religious festival in the world.
Arrangements for the Melas at Haridwar
and Allahabad are made by the govern-
ment of Uttar Pradesh, coordinating
transportation, drinking water, and san-
itation for millions of pilgrims, as well as
building temporary cities for the
visitors. Ascetics come from all over
the subcontinent, some staying for
months. Many religious organizations
set up booths in an effort to publicize
their message.
Recently the government has begun
using the Mela to promote ideas such as
family planning and cleaning up theKundalini Yoga
Ganges, as well as promoting the Mela
as tourism, spurring economic develop-
ment. This combination of business and
religion has roots in the past; in the early
nineteenth century, the annual spring
bathing fair at Haridwar was also a trad-
ing fair, particularly for horses. For many
people, the opportunity to view the
spectacle of the Mela is at least as strong
an inducement as the promise of
bathing away their sins. See also
Tortoise avatar.
Kumhar
Traditional Indian society was as a col-
lection of endogamous subgroups (in
which marriage is decreed by law to
occur only between members of the
same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
Jatis were organized (and their social
status determined) by the group’s hered-
itary occupation, over which each group
held a monopoly. The Kumhars’ heredi-
tary occupation was making pottery.
Kunbi
Traditional Indian society was as a
collection of endogamous subgroups
(in which marriage is decreed by law
to occur only between members of
the same group) known as jatis
(“birth”). Jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each
group held a monopoly. The Kunbis’
traditional occupation was farming.
They were the dominant landholding
community in Gujarat.
Kundalini
(“spiral”) Kundalini, the latent spiritual
power that exists in every person, is one
of the most fundamental concepts in
tantra. It is the most vital element in the
subtle body, an alternate physiological
system believed to occupy a different
plane of existence than gross matter, but
which has certain correspondences to
the material body. The subtle body is a
set of six psychic centers (chakras),
visualized as multi-petaled lotus flowers
running along the spine and connected
by three vertical channels. Each of the
chakras symbolize human capacities,
subtle elements (tanmatras), and
sacred sounds. Above and below the
chakras are the bodily abodes of the
god Shiva (awareness) and the
goddess Shakti (power), the two divine
principles through which the entire
universe has come into being. The
underlying assumption behind this
concept is the homology (or the
similarity based on the common origin)
of macrocosm and microcosm, an
essential Hindu belief documented
in the texts of the Upanishads.
The kundalini is an aspect of the uni-
versal Shakti present in all human
beings; it is visualized as a snake coiled
three times around the muladhara
chakra, the lowest of the psychic cen-
ters. Although kundalini can be found in
all people, it is usually dormant, sym-
bolized by its coiled state. The object of
the religious disciplines (yogas) involv-
ing the subtle body is to awaken and
uncoil the kundalini, drawing it up
through the subtle body’s central chan-
nel (sushumna), piercing through the
chakras on its way. Kundalini’s ascent
represents the awakening of spiritual
energy. This awakening must be carried
out under a guru’s supervision to pre-
vent the aspirant from unknowingly
arousing uncontrollable forces. As each
chakra is pierced, it is believed to bring
either the destruction of obstructions or
the awakening of new capacities. When
fully extended, the kundalini rises to the
microcosmic realm of Shiva, the sahas-
radalapadma at the crown of the head,
to unite with Shiva in perpetual bliss.

Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), Shakti and

Kundalini Yoga
The religious discipline (yoga) focusing
on the kundalini, the latent spiritual
[[381]]
Kunti
power that exists in every person.
Through a combination of yoga practice
and ritual action, it is believed that the
kundalini is awakened and rises through
the chakras in the subtle body. This
action brings further spiritual capacities
and, ultimately, final liberation (mok-
sha) of the soul. One of the claims for
kundalini yoga is that it is much quicker
than other means of spiritual develop-
ment, harnessing more powerful forces.
For this same reason, it is viewed as
more hazardous, and should be done
only under the supervision of one’s reli-
gious preceptor (guru). According to
tradition, those who engage these forces
without proper supervision risk
unleashing forces they cannot control,
possibly bringing on insanity or death.
Kunti
In the Mahabharata, the later of the two
great Hindu epics, Kunti is the elder wife
of King Pandu, and the mother of
Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Bhima.
None of these children are actually
Pandu’s sons; they have been magically
conceived through the effect of a
mantra given to Kunti by the sage
Durvasas. The mantra gives the woman
who recites it the power to call down any
of the gods and conceive a son equal in
power to the god himself.
Kunti receives this mantra before her
marriage. In a moment of youthful
impulsiveness, she recites it while look-
ing at the sun. She is immediately visited
by a shining figure who leaves her with
an equally shining son. Distraught and
desperate at the birth of this illegitimate
child, she puts him in a box and aban-
dons him in the Ganges River. The child
is adopted by the charioteer Adhiratha
and grows up to be the heroic Karna.
Kunti’s other three sons are born
after her marriage, with Pandu’s bless-
ing: Yudhishthira from the god
Dharma, who is righteousness person-
ified; Arjuna from the storm-god
Indra; and Bhima from the wind-god
Vayu. Although these three grow up to
be heroic and kingly figures, they
[[382]]

develop a violent hatred for Karna
because of his unknown parentage.
One of the Mahabharata’s tragic
themes is this bitter rivalry between
men who do not know they are broth-
ers. Their hostility is especially difficult
for Kunti, aware of Karna’s identity. She
knows that the problems are rooted in
her impulsiveness and cowardice. On
the eve of the great Mahabharata war
she goes to Karna, reveals his identity
to him, imploring him to return and
fight with his brothers. Karna refuses,
saying that he has taken a vow to kill
Arjuna, but he will not harm her other
sons. After the war Kunti becomes a
recluse, living in the forest with several
other people of her generation. After
living there for some years, she is killed
in a forest fire.
Kurma Avatar
The Kurma avatar is considered the
second avatar or incarnation of the
god Vishnu. Taking the form of a
tortoise, he helps the gods churn the
Ocean of Milk so that they can obtain
the nectar of immortality (amrta). See
Tortoise avatar.
Kurmasana
(“tortoise-posture”) One of the sitting
postures (asanas) used in yoga; also
a posture in which images of the
deities are portrayed in Hindu
iconography. As described in commen-
taries on the Yoga Sutras, this posture
has the legs crossed with the feet
tucked under the thighs, and the crossed
heels forming a cavity around the
scrotum. In Indian iconography,
the Kurmasana is sometimes represent-
ed at the base of a statue by an
actual carving of a tortoise, forming
the base on which the image is placed.
In modern yoga manuals this posture
is described as a sitting position
in which the upper body is bent
forward, with the arms extended
sideways under the outstretched
legs, so that person looks vaguelyKutichaka
like a tortoise, with a head, “shell” (the
trunk), and four outstretched limbs.
Kurukshetra
City and sacred site (tirtha) in the north-
ern part of the state of Haryana, about
ninety miles due north of Delhi. In
Hindu mythology, Kurukshetra is the
site of the climactic battle in the
Mahabharata, the later of the two great
Hindu epics. This battle is still discussed
as if it was a recent event. Kurukshetra is
also famous as a bathing (snana) place.
A bathing pool attracts hundreds of
thousands of pilgrims during eclipses,
at which time it is believed to contain all
the sacred waters of India.
Kutichaka
(“delighting in staying in the house”)
One the of four types of Hindu ascetics.
The basis for these four types was their
livelihood, which in practice has been
much less important for ascetic identity
than sectarian or organizational affilia-
tion. The Kutichaka is the least presti-
gious of the four, with the others
being (in order of increasing status)
Bahudaka, Hamsa, and Paramahamsa.
The Kutichaka is described as an ascetic
who resides in a house (kuti) erected by
himself or his sons and begs for food
from his sons and relatives.
Kusha
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Kusha is one of the
twin sons of Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist. After their mother, Sita, has been
cast into exile at the ashram of the sage
Valmiki, Kusha is born in an unusual
fashion. One day when Sita takes her
son Lava to bathe in the river, Valmiki
notices that the child is gone and fears
that it has been seized by a wild animal.
To spare Sita’s motherly feelings, he
creates an identical child out of
kusha grass. When Sita returns with
Lava, his twin is given the name
Kusha. Later, Lava and Kusha go with
Valmiki to Rama’s court in Ayodhya.
It is in Rama’s court that they first
recite the epic poem composed by
Valmiki, the Ramayana. After Rama
gives up his throne, he divides his
kingdom between Lava and Kusha.
Kusha (“Kusha Grass”) Dvipa
In traditional mythic geography, Kusha
or “Kusha grass,” is the fourth of
the seven concentric landmasses
(dvipas) making up the visible world.
