considerable friction between the
Udasis and the Sikh community in the
early twentieth century because the
Sikhs were more self-consciously assert-
ing their separate identity. See also
Panchayatana Puja.
Udayagiri
Udana
In traditional Indian physiology, one of
the five bodily “winds” considered to be
responsible for basic bodily functions,
the others being prana, apana, vyana,
and samana. The udana wind is consid-
ered to reside in the throat and to be the
force that conveys things out of the
mouth—primarily speech and song, but
also burps and (presumably) vomit.
Udasi
Ascetic community founded by
Shrichandra (traditional dates 1492–
[[1612]]
), the elder son of Guru Nanak, the
first of the ten Sikh gurus. According to
one tradition, Nanak passed over
Shrichandra as his successor because
Shrichandra had become an ascetic.
Guru Nanak disapproved of this, believ-
ing that his followers should live mar-
ried lives in society. The Udasis have
always been an ascetic sect, and since
their formation they have been seen as
distinct from the two other major
ascetic communities, the Sanyasis and
the Bairagis. The latter are separated on
sectarian grounds: The Sanyasis wor-
ship the god Shiva, and the Bairagis the
god Vishnu, whereas the Udasis wor-
ship the Panchayatana grouping of five
Hindu deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesh,
Surya, and Durga) rather than one or
another alone. During the bathing
(snana) processions at the Kumbha
Mela, the Udasis march third, behind
the Sanyasis and the Bairagis. Through
the legacy of their founder, they have
retained some informal connections
with the Sikh community, but by and
large they have always been considered
to belong in the Hindu fold. There was
Village just north of the city of Bhopal in
the state of Madhya Pradesh. Udayagiri
is famous for its rock-cut cave sculp-
tures from the Gupta era (350–550 C.E),
particularly a twenty-foot sculpture of
the god Vishnu in his form as the Boar
avatar, with the earth balanced on his
tusk. See also Gupta dynasty.
Uddalaka Aruni
A character in the Chandogya
Upanishad, one of the speculative texts
that form the latest stratum of the
Vedas. In the upanishad, Uddalaka is
the father and teacher of the boy
Shvetaketu Aruneya, and the two are a
model for the transmission of secret
teachings passed between guru and dis-
ciple. According to a story in the upan-
ishad’s sixth chapter, Shvetaketu is sent
away by his father to study the Vedas,
and when he returns twelve years later,
having mastered all the Vedas, he incor-
rectly considers himself learned. His
father punctures his arrogance by asking
Shvetaketu questions about the nature
of the cosmos and thus shows him the
difference between memorization and
true knowledge. When Shvetaketu
cannot answer these, he admits his
ignorance and accepts instruction from
his father on the nature of the Self
(atman). This instruction contains the
teaching “That thou art” (Tat tvam asi).
This is one of the “great statements”
(mahavakya) in Indian philosophy and
asserts the ultimate identity between
Brahman and atman, the cosmos and
the individual Self.
Uddhava
In Hindu mythology, one of the god
Krishna’s friends and companions. In

Udgatr
standoff, with each side unable to con-
vince the other. Yet in at least one of the
accounts, Uddhava is converted to the
gopis’ point of view. For further infor-
mation see R. S. McGregor (ed. and
trans.), Nanddas, 1973.
Udgatr
The Mahakaleshvar Temple in Ujjain.
It is dedicated to the god Shiva
in the form of the “Lord of Death.”
the devotional (bhakti) literature,
Uddhava is most famous for the mes-
sage he carries from Krishna back to the
gopis, the cowherd women of Braj (a
northern Indian region on the Yamuna
River south of the modern city of Delhi)
who are Krishna’s devotees (bhakta) and
who love him more than life. Uddhava
tells the gopis not to be concerned with
Krishna’s physical absence, since as the
supreme divinity, Krishna is always with
them, even though he may not be visi-
ble. The gopis reply that such talk is fine
for intellectual folk such as Uddhava,
but that for simple women like them-
selves, who have had the delight of asso-
ciating with Krishna in the flesh, such
abstractions are absolutely useless.
Uddhava and the gopis are symbols for
two different types of religious life: one
cool and abstract, focused on an imper-
sonal divinity, and the other based on
passionate love for a particular deity.
Differing accounts of this story give dif-
ferent endings, according to the writers’
inclinations. In some of the stories,
including the earliest version in the
Bhagavata Purana, the story ends in a
[[718]]

Type of sacrificial priest in the
Brahmana literature, one of the later
strands in the sacred literature known as
the Vedas. The Brahmanas largely func-
tioned as manuals describing how to
perform sacrificial rites—which primar-
ily involved burning offerings in a
sacred fire—and the care and attention
devoted to detailing these sacrifices
leads to the inference that these were
the primary religious act. These rites
were so complex that they required spe-
cialized
ritual
technicians:
the
adhvaryum, the hotr, the udgatr, and
the brahman. Of these, the udgatr was
the sacrificial priest who chanted the
hymns from the Sama Veda that were
used in the sacrifice.
Udupi
Town and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Arabian Sea in the state of Karnataka,
about thirty miles north of Mangalore.
Udupi’s most famous temple is to the
god Krishna, but it is best known as the
home of the philosopher Madhva,
founder of the Dvaita Vedanta.
Ugrasena
In Hindu mythology, the king of
Mathura who is the grandfather of the
god Krishna. Ugrasena is supplanted by
the evil Kamsa, who is believed to be
Ugrasena’s son but is actually not.
According to legend, Kamsa is the son of
a demon who has taken Ugrasena’s
form, and who under this guise has
intercourse with Ugrasena’s wife.
Ujjain
City and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Shipra River in the state of MadhyaUlatbamsi
Pradesh, about 100 miles west of
Bhopal, the state capital. Ujjain is the
traditional center of the Malwa plateau
and has a long history as a commercial,
political, cultural, and sacred center. In
earlier times Ujjain was a major stop on
the central trade route, through which
goods from southern India were fun-
neled to other places farther north. Just
before the common era, Ujjain is said to
have been the capital of King
Vikramaditya, after whom the Vikram
era was named. Vikramaditya’s step-
brother, Bhartrhari, reportedly renounced
the throne to become an ascetic but is
best known for his poetry. In later days
Ujjain was the de facto capital of the
Gupta ruler Chandra Gupta II (r.
[[380]]
–414 C.E.), under whose patronage
the greatest Sanskrit poet, Kalidasa, is
said to have worked.
As a sacred center, Ujjain has multi-
ple attractions, and this is its major
source of contemporary importance. It
is one of the Seven Sacred Cities of
India. Dying in one of these cities is said
to bring liberation. Every twelve years
Ujjain plays host to the bathing (snana)
festival known as the Kumbha Mela,
although the mela there is smaller than
the ones at Haridwar and Allahabad.
Given its history, Ujjain is studded with
important religious sites. The most
important site is the temple to Shiva
in his form as Mahakaleshvar, the
“Lord of Death.” Shiva is present at
Mahakaleshvar in the form of a linga,
the pillar-shaped image that is his sym-
bolic form. The Mahakaleshvar linga is
one of the twelve jyotirlingas, a network
of sites deemed especially sacred to
Shiva and at which Shiva is uniquely
present. Ujjain is also famous for a tem-
ple associated with Matsyendranath,
the religious preceptor (guru) of
Gorakhnath, the founder of the
Nathpanthi ascetics. In addition, Ujjain
has a temple to the nine planets, as
well as one of the baithaks, a group of
[[108]]
 sacred sites associated with the
life and activity of the philosopher
Vallabhacharya. Ujjain’s most unusual
site is the temple to the deity Kal
Bhairav. Kal Bhairav is another name for
Bhairava, a horrific form of Shiva,
and the traditional offering at the tem-
ple is liquor—a substance proscribed
and condemned by “respectable”
Hindus and thus the ideal offering for a
marginal deity such as Bhairava. See
also Gupta dynasty.
Ukhimath
Himalayan town on the Mandakini
River in the hills of Uttar Pradesh,
across the river from Guptakashi.
Ukhimath is the winter seat of
Kedarnath, a form of Shiva whose sum-
mer home is a temple in the village of
Kedarnath, high in the mountains at the
Mandakini’s headwaters. The village is
at such high altitude that it is only acces-
sible between late April and October,
after the snows have melted; in October
the temple is ritually closed until
the next spring. When the temple at
Kedarnath has been closed for the
winter, the deity (symbolically repre-
sented by a movable image) takes
residence in Ukhimath for the winter
and then moves back to Kedarnath the
following spring.
Ulatbamsi
(“upside-down language”) Word denot-
ing paradoxical language in which the
speaker’s utterances are reversals of
“normal” events, such as “The cow is
sucking the calf’s teat,” “Mouse stalks
cat,” “Rain falls from earth to sky.” The
most famous composer of such utter-
ances was the devotional (bhakti) poet-
saint Kabir, who inherited a tradition of
coded language (sandhabhasha) from
the Nathpanthi and Sahajiya religious
communities. Ulatbamsi utterances are
not intended to be simply nonsensical,
nor is it simply a coded language in
which one term stands for another; they
are rather intended to stimulate the
hearer to active listening, interpretation,
and searching for a truth that lies
beyond right side up and upside
down. For a long discussion of
[[719]]
Uma
ulatbamsi, see Appendix A in Linda Hess
and Shukdev Singh (trans.), The Bijak
of Kabir, 1983.
Uma
Epithet of the goddess Parvati, wife of
the god Shiva. The name supposedly
comes from the exclamation uttered by
Parvati’s mother, Mena, when Parvati
announces that she intends to perform
asceticism to win Shiva as a husband.
According to the story, Mena covers her
ears with her hands and replies “U Ma!”
(Oh, don’t!) As with all forms of Parvati
(and all married goddesses), Uma is
a beneficent and benevolent presence,
maternal and life affirming, although
at times she can be capricious and
spiteful if insulted. For more informa-
tion on Uma and all the goddesses
of Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley,
Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Untouchable
Name denoting certain jatis who were
considered so impure that their very
presence was polluting to caste
Hindus, that is, Hindus belonging to
the four varnas (major social divi-
sions). Jatis are endogamous social
subgroups—groups in which members
are forbidden to marry outside of their
particular group—that were often
defined by the group’s hereditary occu-
pation. Untouchability usually stemmed
from occupations considered impure or
debased, such as working with leather,
in the case of the Chamars, or the
groups whose hereditary occupation
was to remove night soil, often by carry-
ing it in baskets balanced on their heads.
In traditional society, untouchables
were subject to numerous restrictions
and prohibitions on where they could
live, work, draw water, and even move
about. In many cases they had to
announce their presence to allow caste
Hindus to remove themselves from the
area. Although untouchability has been
illegal since independence, social atti-
tudes supporting it persist, and in a
[[720]]

country in which one’s name often con-
veys one’s jati, such discrimination is
difficult to escape. In many places these
people are still underprivileged and
desperately poor, as a legacy of the past.
In recent years they have become more
militant—among other things, adopting
the name dalit (“oppressed”) to describe
themselves—and have begun to
exercise their power at the ballot
box, trying to take advantage of their
considerable numbers.
Upachara
(“honoring,” “entertaining”) In its literal
meaning, this word denotes the act of
showing politeness, courtesy, or honor
to any superior. In the context of wor-
ship, the meaning has been extended to
refer to the things that are normally
offered to the deity as part of the stan-
dard hospitality that would be offered to
any honored guest. Although there are
differing enumerations of these offer-
ings, one of the most common lists has
sixteen of them: summoning (avahana),
offering a seat (asana), water for wash-
ing the feet (padya), thirst-quenching
beverages (arghya), water for rinsing the
mouth (achamaniya), bathing (snana),
clothing (vastra), affixing the sacred
thread (yajnopavit), fragrant unguents
(anulepana), flowers (pushpa), incense
(dhupa), lamp (dipa), food (naivedya),
reverential salutation (namaskara), cir-
cumambulation (pradakshina), and
dismissal (visarjana). To give all sixteen
offerings is a long and detailed ritual,
and the most common of the offerings is
the eleventh, the offering of light, which
is also known as arati.
Upadana
In Indian philosophy, the word
upadana denotes the “material cause”
for something, that is, the stuff from
which it is formed. Although this notion
seems obvious to modern materialist
ears, it carries several important
assumptions that not all Indian
philosophical schools were willing toUpanayana (“bringing-near”) Samskara
concede—namely, that there were real
objects in the world, that they were
made from other things, and that these
things underwent real transformations.
The notion of a material cause was held
by the “realist” schools, most notably
the Samkhya, Nyaya-Vaisheshika,
and Vishishthadvaita Vedanta. It was
opposed by the Buddhist schools, whose
assumption that reality was constantly
changing made the notion of real things
problematic. It was also opposed by the
Advaita Vedanta school, whose starting
assumption was that ultimately there
was only one “real” thing—the formless
Brahman (Supreme Reality)—and thus
that the notion of anything becoming
anything else was in error.
Upadhi
(“obstruction”) In Indian logic, a coun-
terexample that renders an inference
(anumana) invalid by showing that the
reason (hetu) given as evidence for the
initial assertion (sadhya) is not invari-
ably true. For example, the inference
that “there is smoke because there is
fire” was judged invalid because of the
counterexample of the red-hot iron ball,
which was considered fiery but not
smoky. Since the red-hot iron ball was a
class of fiery things that did not smoke,
it showed that the reason given for the
inference did not account for every case
of the thing to be proved (sadhya)—and
thus raised the possibility that there
were other such cases as well. This
invalid inference fails the requirement
known as pervasion (vyapti), in which
the reason must account for every
possible case; this is critical for validity
in an inference. Needless to say, the
search for such counterexamples was an
essential part of Indian logic, since
one such example could discredit an
opponent’s argument. For further
information and elaboration, see
Karl H. Potter (ed.), Presuppositions of
India’s Philosophies, 1972.
Upamana
(“analogy”) According to some philo-
sophical schools, upamana was one of
the pramanas, or the means by which
human beings can gain true and accu-
rate knowledge. The classic example of
this pramana describes a traveler going
to a certain region who is told that he
will encounter a certain animal that
looks somewhat like a cow; upon going
there this analogy helps him identify the
animal. Some philosophical schools
deny that this is a separate pramana
and classify it as a variety of inference
(anumana). Those who accept it as a
fourth pramana—primarily the Nyaya-
Vaisheshika school—stress that accord-
ing to the rules of inference, a valid
inference must be grounded in previous
perceptions. In the case of the traveler,
his ability to identify is not based on
any differences drawn from previous
perceptions of that type of animal, since
he has never before seen the type of
animal he actually encounters. He
knows what it is because it looks
“somewhat like a cow.” Thus an
additional pramana was needed to
account for this. See also philosophy.
Upanayana
(“bringing-near”) Samskara
Traditionally, the eleventh of the life
cycle ceremonies (samskaras), in which
a young man received a religious initia-
tion that functioned as a symbolic “sec-
ond birth,” conferring on him new
capacities and responsibilities. This cer-
emony marks the symbolic end of child-
hood and, as with many such rites of
passage, the creation of a new social
identity. After this rite the initiate
becomes a brahmacharin, the first of
the stages of life (ashramas) for a
“twice-born” man. This initiation gives
the entitlement and the obligation to
study the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts, and
according to the traditional model, the
young man would have done this while
living in the household of his guru. With
[[721]]
Upanishad
this entitlement came responsibilities,
particularly to observe purity laws, to
which younger children were not
subject. If nothing else, this rite is an
essential prerequisite to marriage, since
without it the young man is still
considered a child, and in some
contemporary cases it is performed
immediately before the wedding.
According to the dharma literature,
this rite was restricted to young men
from the three highest traditional social
classes (varnas), namely, brahmins,
kshatriyas, and vaishyas. Indeed, it is
the entitlement for this rite that makes
these three the “twice-born” groups. For
each group, a different age was pre-
scribed for initiation and a different
duration fixed for study, with brahmins
being both earliest to start and the
longest to study. The heart of the
upanayana samskara is investing the
young man with the sacred thread
(janeu), which he must wear from that
day forth, and teaching him the sacred
formula known as the Gayatri mantra.
This rite is still important and still widely
performed, although it tends to be
stressed most by brahmins. This is not
surprising, given their traditional posi-
tion as teachers and scholars and their
concern for conserving that status, even
in modern times. For further informa-
tion see Pandurang Vaman Kane (trans.),
A History of Dharmasastra, 1968; and Raj
Bali Pandey, Hindu Samskaras, 1969.
The former is encyclopedic and the
latter more accessible; despite their
age, they remain the best sources for
traditional Hindu rites.
Upanishad
The latest textual stratum in the Vedas,
the oldest and most authoritative Hindu
religious texts. The literal meaning of the
word upanishad is “to sit near [a
teacher],” but a better sense of its true
meaning would be “secret teaching.”
The Upanishads mark a clean break
from the immediately preceding Vedic
literature, the Brahmanas, in which the
essential concern was to lay out the
[[722]]

concrete procedures for performing
highly complex sacrificial rites. In con-
trast, the Upanishads were concerned
with more speculative and abstract
questions: the essential nature of the
cosmos, the essence of the human
being, and the relationship between
these two. The conclusion in the
Upanishads is that the essence of the
universe is an impersonal reality known
as Brahman, and that the essence of the
human being is called the “Self”
(atman). The fundamental insight and
essential teaching in the Upanishads
is the identity of Brahman and atman,
and thus of the macrocosm and the
microcosm. This identity is one of the
most fundamental Hindu religious ideas
and underlies religious thought up to
the present time.
The twelve or thirteen oldest upan-
ishads are not a cohesive set but a series
of independent documents, although
the later ones were clearly influenced by
the earlier ones. The two oldest are the
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and the
Chandogya Upanishad. Each is much
longer than all the others combined,
they are written in prose as a series of
dialogues between famous sages, the
Sanskrit language in them is clearly
more archaic, and their ideas are embry-
onic and undeveloped. Later upan-
ishads—such as the Isha, Kena, Katha,
Prashna, and Mandukya—are much
shorter, are written in verse, and have
well-developed ideas. Some of these
introduce the notion of theism, but not
until the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is
the Supreme Being identified as a god,
in this case Rudra. For much of their
history, the Upanishads would have
been transmitted orally from master to
student; this makes it unlikely that these
texts were widely known because they
would have been secret and carefully
guarded teachings.
The Upanishads are important
because of the speculative questions
they ask and because many of their
teachings are fundamental assumptions
in Hindu religious life, even today: the
notion of an eternal Self that gives aUrdhvabahu
being continuous identity; the idea of
reincarnation (samsara) commensurate
with one’s deeds; the concept that some
single unifying power lies behind the
world’s apparent diversity; and the con-
viction that this can be attained only
through individual realization, usually
described as a flash of mystic insight. As
texts carrying the religious authority of
the Vedas, the Upanishads were also
extremely important in the develop-
ment of Hindu philosophical schools,
particularly Advaita Vedanta, which
shares this overriding emphasis on
inner realization. For information on the
Upanishads themselves, see Robert
Ernest Hume (trans.), Thirteen Principal
Upanisads, 1965. See also philosophy.
Upasaka
(“servant”) A person engaged in
upasana—that is, having an intent focus
on serving and worshiping a deity.
Upasana
“food.” In other cases one will abstain
from certain types of food, such as for
the Santoshi Ma Vrat, in which the per-
son must not eat anything containing
sour or bitter flavors.
When fasting is performed as expia-
tion (prayashchitta), the prescriptions
are usually concerned with the amount
of food eaten rather than the particular
type. The best-known rite of this kind is
the chandrayana, a penitential rite last-
ing for one lunar month in which the
penitent’s food consumption mirrors
the monthly course of the moon. The
performer begins by eating fourteen
mouthfuls of food on the first day
of the waning moon, then one less
mouthful on each successive day, with
a complete fast on the new moon day.
On each successive day during the
waxing moon, the penitent eats one
more mouthful, finishing at fifteen on
the day of the full moon.
Upendra
(“service”) General term denoting reli-
gious practice or spiritual discipline as a
whole. Aside from the explicit notion of
serving the deity (or guru), the word
also connotes an intent focus on the
part of the performer—not so much the
particular things one is doing, but the
overall attitude of care and attention
with which one does them.(“junior Indra”) Epithet of the god
Vishnu. It is first used in some late
hymns in the Vedas, the earliest Hindu
religious texts, in which Vishnu is por-
trayed as a subordinate and companion
of the storm-god Indra, who is the pri-
mary Vedic deity. The epithet continues
to be used later despite Indra’s eclipse as
a significant deity, and thus its literal
meaning is no longer true. See Vishnu.
UpavasaUpside-Down Language
General term denoting fasting, which
is sometimes performed as a pre-
scribed action for particular religious
observances such as festivals and vows
(vrats), and which is also done as
a means of expiating one’s sins.
Although upavasa can refer to total
abstinence from food and drink, it
usually entails modification of one’s
diet. In some cases, as on the festival of
Shivaratri, such “fasting” entails
abstaining from cooked grains, which
are considered such an essential ele-
ment in a meal that in parts of India
the word rice is also used to mean
Term designating the type of utterances
known as ulatbamsi, so called because
these utterances intentionally describe
things contrary to the way they are in
the “normal” world. See ulatbamsi.
Urdhvabahu
(“[one whose] arm is upraised”) Name
for a person practicing a particularly
severe form of physical mortification, in
which one or both arms are kept contin-
ually raised. After some time the mus-
cles atrophy, and the arms cannot be
lowered again. Although urdhvabahu is
[[723]]
Urdhvapundra
An ascetic with the urdhvapundra mark on his forehead.
It consists of three vertical lines and indicates that he is a devotee of the god Vishnu.
not very common, it has a long-attested
history as an ascetic practice. As with all
such harsh physical asceticism, this is
believed to give one the great benefits of
spiritual awareness and magical power.
This belief is based partly on the cultur-
ally accepted notion that the willingness
to endure physical suffering generates
such spiritual power, but this belief
could also stem from the strength
of will needed to carry this out—a
strength of will that would presumably
have correlates in other dimensions
of one’s personality.
Urdhvapundra
Name denoting the characteristic fore-
head mark (tika) worn by the ascetic
devotees (bhakta) of the god Vishnu.
The urdhvapundra’s basic pattern is
made of three vertical lines, in contrast
[[724]]

to the three horizontal lines worn by the
Sanyasis, who are devotees of Shiva.
There are many variations in the design,
and many different materials can be
used: sandalwood paste, white clay, yel-
low clay, and red vermilion. The only
thing that is never used is the sacred ash
(vibhuti) characteristic of the Sanyasis.
The design and materials used for the
urdhvapundra are quite distinctive
among various Vaishnava ascetic com-
munities, and from this, one can easily
identify a particular ascetic’s affiliation.
For further information see A. W.
Entwistle,

Tilakas—
Sectarian Marks Worn by Worshipers of
Visnu,” IAVRI-Bulletin 11 and 12, 1982.
Urdhvaretas
(“[one whose] semen is drawn
upward”) Epithet for someone keepingUtkutikasana
a vow of celibacy, particularly a lifelong
vow. In the Hindu tradition, celibacy is
important not only for removing one
from enjoying the pleasures of the flesh
but because on a more basic level,
semen is considered the concentrated
essence of a man’s vital energies.
Expending semen is necessary for pro-
creation, but otherwise it should be
retained, as a way to conserve one’s vital
forces. In popular belief, when a man
has been celibate for a certain time, the
semen is drawn upward to the brain,
where it nourishes one’s intellectual
and spiritual faculties.
Urushringa
Architectural detail in the temple archi-
tecture of Khajuraho, one of the major
forms of the northern Indian Nagara
style. The Nagara style’s primary feature
is a shikhara, or tower. This primary
shikhara is often surrounded by smaller,
subsidiary towers, to lead the eye up to
the highest point, which is directly over
the image of the temple’s primary deity.
The urushringas are turrets built on the
sides of these towers, whose shape repli-
cates that of the tallest central tower and
that serve to draw the eye upward to the
highest tower.
Urvashi
In Hindu mythology, a particular celes-
tial nymph (apsara) who is most famous
for her association with King Pururavas.
Urvashi comes to stay with Pururavas
under several conditions, including that
she should never see him naked. When
she has been gone from heaven for a
while, the god Indra notices her absence
and schemes to get her back. One night
he sends several minor deities to steal
two lambs of which Urvashi is very fond,
and when Pururavas leaps up to regain
them, a flash of lightning reveals him
naked, and Urvashi leaves him. They are
separate for some time but are eventually
reunited—in some accounts for good,
and in others for only one night a year.
Ushas
In the Vedas, the oldest and most
authoritative Hindu religious texts,
Ushas is a goddess associated and
sometimes identified with the dawn.
She is described as lighting the path for
the sun and driving away the darkness
and evil; her presence is thus associated
with the regularity of the cosmic order.
Ushas is most notable not for what she
does—she is a minor deity, mentioned
in only a handful of the Vedic hymns—
but because she is one of the few god-
desses in the Vedas. The virtual absence
of female divinities in the Vedas is one of
the factors behind the notion that the
great Goddess, one of the three major
deities in later religious life, has her
roots in indigenous goddess worship.
For more information on Ushas and all
the goddesses of Hinduism, see David R.
Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, 1986.
Utkala
Northern Indian brahmin group that
makes up one of the five northern brah-
min communities (Pancha Gauda); the
other four are the Kanaujias, the
Maithilas, the Gaudas, and the
Saraswats. Utkala brahmins are found
only in the coastal regions of Orissa, on
the Bay of Bengal, but their ritual con-
trol over the pilgrimage sites there, par-
ticularly the city of Puri, have helped
them remain a significant group.
Utkutikasana
Sitting posture (asana) in yoga practice
in which the legs are contracted, with
the soles of the feet pressed against each
other and the outer part of the feet and
legs flat on the ground. This posture is
the one in which images of the deities
are portrayed in Hindu iconography,

samasthana in the commentaries to the

Indus Valley civilization; the figure in
this position is the mysterious horned

Utpanna Ekadashi
deity that some viewers have sought to
identify as a “proto-Shiva.”
Utpanna Ekadashi
Religious observance falling on the
eleventh day (ekadashi) of the dark
(waning) half of the lunar month of
Margashirsha (November–December).
As for all of the eleventh-day obser-
vances, this is dedicated to the worship
of Vishnu, and on this day especially, in
his form as Krishna. Most Hindu festi-
vals have certain prescribed rites, which
usually involve fasting (upavasa) and
worship and often promise specific ben-
efits for faithful performance. Those
observing this vow should fast com-
pletely on the tenth and perform full
worship during the brahma muhurta of
the eleventh. On this ekadashi, only
fruits should be offered as food for the
deity. Faithfully keeping this festival is
believed to bring liberation of the soul
(moksha). The name Utpanna means
“born,” and the charter myth for this
celebration is that of Anasuya, wife of
the sage Atri. Anasuya is famous for her
devotion to her husband, and the wives
of the gods become jealous of her.
Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati send
their husbands (Vishnu, Shiva, and
Brahma) to try to compromise her
fidelity; the gods come begging for food,
but they refuse to accept it unless
Anasuya gives it to them naked. Through
the power she has gained from her devo-
tion to her husband, Anasuya turns the
three gods into infants and then nurses
them until they are satisfied; these three
gods are later “born” into her household:
Vishnu as Dattatreya, Shiva as Durvasas,
and Brahma as Chandra.
Utsava Murti
(“festival image”) Image of a deity that is
able (and intended) to be moved. These
are used mainly during festivals, when
the image of the deity is paraded around
the town or city on the model of a kingly
procession, symbolically surveying his
or her realm. The other general class of
[[726]]

Hindu images is the sthala murti,
which is fixed in one place and never
moves from it.
Uttara (“Later”) Mimamsa
Another name for the philosophical
school also known as Vedanta, which
was called Uttara Mimamsa to distin-
guish it from Purva Mimamsa, another
philosophical school. See Vedanta.
Uttararamacharita
(“Later Acts of Rama”) Drama written by
the Sanskrit playwright Bhavabhuti
(8th c.), which retells the story of the
Ramayana, the earlier of the two
Sanskrit epics. Bhavabhuti’s play largely
follows the plot of the original Valmiki
Ramayana, with one important differ-
ence. Valmiki’s text ends with Rama’s
banishing Sita because of suspicions
about her virtue and Sita’s being swal-
lowed up by the earth, which is her
mother and witness to her chastity. The
Uttararamacharita, on the other hand,
ends with a complete reconciliation
between Rama and Sita. This change
may have been prompted solely by the
desire for a happy ending, which is one
of the characteristic features of Sanskrit
drama. It may also indicate that some
people were not comfortable with the
moral ambiguities of the original text, in
which Rama, although claimed to be
divine, sometimes acts in unscrupulous
and disturbing ways.
Uttarayana
Term denoting the six months of the
solar year in which the sun is believed to
be moving northward. In the common
era, this would be the period between
the winter solstice and the summer sol-
stice (roughly December 20 to June 20)
and would be based on the actual
motion of the sun with respect to the
earth. The Indian solar year is based on
the motion of the sun through the zodiac,
which is calculated differently than in
Western astrology. The uttarayana
begins on Makara Sankranti (the dayUttar Pradesh
the sun is calculated as entering
Capricorn, usually January 14) and ends
the day before Karka Sankranti (the day
the sun enters Cancer, usually calculat-
ed as July 14). The uttarayana is consid-
ered a more auspicious time than the
Dakshinayana (in which the sun is trav-
eling toward the south) because the
guardian deity for the southern direc-
tion is Yama, who is death personified.
Uttarkashi
(“northern Benares”) Himalayan town
and sacred site (tirtha) on the
Bhagirathi River in northern Uttar
Pradesh. As its name indicates,
Uttarkashi is claimed as the northern
form of the city of Benares, the city of
the god Shiva that is one of the most
sacred sites in India. Uttarkashi’s charter
myths also claim that in the present age,
Shiva no longer dwells in Benares, but
instead lives in Uttarkashi. To buttress
the claim to being the northern Benares
Uttarkashi shows many parallels and
homologies with Benares itself: In both,
the Ganges River flows in a northern
direction through the city; both have
their core region defined as the area
between the Varuna and Asi Rivers;
both are enclosed by a panchakroshi
pilgrimage route; and in both, the pri-
mary deity is Shiva in his form as
Vishvanath. Uttarkashi is a site of great
antiquity—inscriptions have been dis-
covered from the seventh century C.E.—
and although these parallels to Benares
might seem slavish, the basis of this
claim is not just that Uttarkashi is a holy
place, just as Benares is a holy place, but
that the holiness of Uttarkashi is equal
to that of Benares. Aside from its impor-
tance as a pilgrimage town, Uttarkashi
is also the district headquarters and
a major supply point to the other sites
in the region. The town was severely
damaged in an earthquake in early 1993
and has been rebuilding slowly since
that time.
Uttar Pradesh
(“northern state”) Modern Indian state
running along the border with Nepal.
Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous
state and is thus one of its most politi-
cally important. The state has a range of
different ecosystems, from the high
Himalayas to the rice-growing plains in
its eastern basin, which gives it
immense natural and social variety.
Uttar Pradesh also contains the sources
and much of the length for both the
Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, and the
state thus contains many of the holiest
sites in India. Although a full catalog
would be difficult to give, some of
the state’s major sacred sites (tirthas)
are the four Himalayan Dhams
(“[divine]
abodes”),
Yamunotri,
Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath;
the sacred cities of Haridwar,
Allahabad, and Benares; the city of
Ayodhya, the mythic home of the
god Rama; and the Braj region south
of Delhi, which is mythically associated
with the god Krishna. For general
information about Uttar Pradesh and
all the regions of India, an accessible
reference is Christine Nivin et al.,
India, 8th ed., Lonely Planet, 1998. See
also four dhams.
