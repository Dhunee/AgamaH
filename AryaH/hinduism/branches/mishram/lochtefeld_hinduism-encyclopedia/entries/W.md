Water
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, fire, wind, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the ele-
ments is paired with one of the senses;
here water is associated with taste.
Within the body, water is also associated
with certain bodily functions, especially
reproduction (involving the mixing of
fluids) and the elimination of fluid
wastes.
Wednesday
(Budhvar) The fourth day of the week,
the presiding planet of which is
Mercury (Budh). Although not inauspi-
cious, the day has few strong associa-
tions and is not linked to the worship of
any major deity. The planet Mercury is
seen as an auspicious but weak planet,
based on its small size and its quick
rotation around the sun.
Week, Structure of
The Hindu week has seven days, just
like the European calendar. Each of the
days has a presiding planet, is associat-
ed with one or more presiding deities,
and (in keeping with the general Indian
attitude toward time) is deemed more
or less auspicious. The most unlucky
days are Tuesday and Saturday, associ-
ated respectively with the planets Mars
and Saturn. Monday (the moon),
Thursday (Jupiter), and Friday (Venus)
are usually regarded as auspicious days
since these are judged to be benevolent
and powerful planets. Sunday (the sun)
and Wednesday (Mercury) have no
strong associations, because although
these bodies are seen as benevolent,
they are also seen as relatively weak in
their influence.
West Bengal
Modern Indian state. It was formed after
Indian independence in 1947, after the
partition of the state of Bengal into West
Bengal and West Pakistan, the latter now
known as Bangladesh. Most of the state
lies in the lowland of the Ganges River
delta, although in the north, Darjeeling
extends into the Himalayas. West
Bengal’s capital, Calcutta, was the
administrative center of British India
until the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury. It was also a hotbed of anti-British
resistance and has remained one
of India’s great artistic and intellectual
centers. West Bengal has a number
of important religious sites: Kalighat, in
the heart of Calcutta, and Dakshi-
neshwar, Tarakeshvar, Tarapith, and
Navadvip. For general information
about West Bengal and all the regions of
India, an accessible reference is

Lonely Planet, 1998.
West Indies
A cluster of Caribbean islands with a sig-
nificant Hindu diaspora population. As
in many other cases, they were originally
brought to the West Indies as indentured
agricultural laborers, particularly on
the sugar plantations, but have now
lived there so long that they have
become a part of the local community.
On some of the islands, particularly
Trinidad, Hindus have constructed
temples and established sacred
sites (tirthas) there, as a way of con-
necting their religious lives to their
local environment.
White Yajur Veda
Along with the Black Yajur Veda, this is
one of the two major forms of the Yajur
Veda, one of the oldest Hindu religious
texts. The major difference between
these two forms comes from the
[[771]]

differing placement of explanatory
notes on the Vedic mantras and their sig-
nificance. The “White” Yajur Veda gathers
these notes into an appendix known as a
Brahmana—namely, the Shatapatha
Brahmana, which gives its name to
the second major stratum of Vedic texts.
In contrast, the four recensions of the
Black Yajur Veda include these notes in the
text itself.
Widows
Given the traditional assumption that a
Hindu woman’s central role is as a wife
and mother, becoming a widow is
deemed the worst fate that can befall a
woman and is seen as the karmic
fruition of some ghastly former deed.
Because the underlying assumption of
the marriage ceremony is that the
bride’s identity becomes assimilated to
the groom’s, a woman without a
husband was seen as having lost her
identity. Furthermore, because she had
already taken on her dead husband’s
identity, remarriage was not an option
for her. Immediately after her husband’s
death a woman was supposed to remove
[[772]]

all the symbols of a married woman—
rubbing the red vermilion from the part
in her hair, breaking her glass bangles,
and in southern India, cutting the
thread on her mangal sutra. For the rest
of her life, she was forbidden to wear
jewelry, colored clothing, or other bodily
adornments, was supposed to keep her
hair cropped short, and was supposed
to devote herself to religious acts for the
benefit of her dead husband. Because
she had been widowed, she was also
considered an unlucky and inauspicious
person, banned from any and all auspi-
cious events, living out her life doing the
drudge work in the household. In cer-
tain parts of India, it was common prac-
tice to burn a widow on her husband’s
funeral pyre, a rite known as sati,
although there were many other regions
in which this practice was unheard of.
In real life, there was considerable
variation on this grim picture. The most
significant factors were a woman’s age at
the time she was widowed, whether she
had children, and the social status of her
husband’s family. A woman widowed in
old age would likely continue as matri-
arch of the family, a young widow withWoodroffe, Sir John
sons would retain family status through
her children, while even a child widow
in a wealthy family could have a fairly
comfortable life, although subject to
numerous restrictions. Where one or
another of these factors was lacking,
then a widow’s position would be much
more precarious, and there is no doubt
that in earlier times many widows led
very difficult lives. Even in modern
times a woman whose husband dies at a
young age is often considered to be
inauspicious, and thus a source of bad
fortune. Ameliorating the condition of
widows was one of the major goals of
nineteenth-century Hindu reformers,
and it has become more common for
widows to remarry, although some of
the most traditionally minded people do
not accept this.
Wind
One of the five elements in traditional
Indian cosmology, the others being
earth, fire, water, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the ele-
ments is paired with one of the five senses;
here wind is associated with touch. The
various “vital winds” (prana) inside the
body are also associated with a number
of bodily functions, including respira-
tion and circulation.
Witchcraft
The existence of witchcraft is generally
accepted in many segments of contem-
porary Hindu culture, even by many
“modern” urban Hindus. The root forces
behind witchcraft are malevolence,
envy, and greed, through which some
people try to harm others or to ruin
what they have gained. Witches may
work through spells, through the evil eye
(nazar), or through pronouncing curses
on others. Pregnant women and young
children are thought to be particularly
susceptible to their powers, and these
parties are also deemed particularly
likely to be cursed, because the envy
over their good fortune is said to excite
a witch’s passion. The appropriate
counteraction is to perform various
rites of protection, which will safeguard
the person from being affected. Those
afflicted by witchcraft may exhibit this
as an unusually persistent illness or as
strange behavior; for these people,
stronger remedies are needed. As Sudhir
Kakar masterfully shows, the language
of possession and exorcism can be
interpreted as an “idiom” (using tradi-
tional Indian cultural categories) for
what modern psychiatrists might call
the diagnosis and treatment of mental
illness. For further information see
Sudhir Kakar, Shamans, Mystics, and
Doctors, 1991; and David F. Pocock, “The
Evil Eye,” in T. N. Madan (ed.), Religion
in India, 1991.
Women
In the dharma literature, women from
all social groups were considered at the
same ritual level as shudras—they could
not undergo a second birth, were forbid-
den to hear the Vedas, were forbidden to
perform certain religious rites, and in
many places could not own property or
resources, except by extension through
their husbands. At the same time,
women played (and play) an immensely
important part in Hindu religious life, as
daughters, mothers, wives, and patrons.
According to the traditional dharma lit-
erature women had their own special
role to play, based on their status as
women. See also stridharma.
Woodroffe, Sir John
(1865–1936) Calcutta High Court Justice
who also, under the pseudonym of
Arthur Avalon, translated and published
works on tantra, a secret, ritually based
religious practice. Woodroffe was one of
the earliest European exponents of
tantra as a coherent religious path and
served as an apologist for the seemingly
“impure” or “immoral” ritual acts
described in the texts. In his expositions
of the tantras, Woodroffe was trying to
convince a dual audience, both of whom
were horrified at the licentiousness

described in the tantric texts, which
involve violating deeply embedded
taboos on nonvegetarian food, con-
sumption of alcohol, and illicit sexuality.
On the one hand, Woodroffe was
addressing the British, who were the
political masters of the time, and on the
other, educated Indians, many of whom
would have preferred to dismiss the
tantras as an aberration. His publica-
tions and lectures were instrumental in
helping make tantrism respectable,
although more careful scholarly work
has been done since that time.
World Parliament of Religions
Meeting in Chicago in 1893 to which
representatives from major world reli-
gions were invited, including Asian reli-
gions. It marks a watershed in the
Euro-American conception of non-
Christian religions, in which they were
no longer seen as simple idolatry but
taken seriously as genuine religious
paths. It is also notable that many main-
line Christian churches were not repre-
sented there, and that the main
Christian presence came from histori-
cally black churches. One of the
Parliament’s highlights was the address
by Swami Vivekananda, in which
Hinduism—in its rational, Vedantic
form—was first seriously received by his
Western hearers. Vivekananda’s pres-
ence was charismatic enough that he
spent the next four years living in
America and in 1897 founded the
Vedanta Society.
Worship
Two separate words can be used to
describe Hindu worship, with two
groups of assumptions that come with
it. The first and most common act of
worship is called darshan (“seeing”), in
which devotees (bhakta) view the image
of the deity, and believe that the deity
is also looking at them. Darshan is thus
an interaction between deity and
devotee, an exchange of glances
that carries understanding. Worship
[[774]]

involving offerings and objects
usually falls under the rubric of the word
Puja (“homage”).
Worship of Tools
A rite traditionally performed on the fes-
tival of Dussehra by members of certain
artisan groups. This festival has two dif-
ferent charter myths, both of which
mark the triumph of good over evil. It is
celebrated as the day that the god Rama
slew the demon Ravana, and is also
associated with the triumph of the
Goddess over a demon named Mahi-
shasura. For the artisans, such wor-
ship ritually marks the importance of
their tools as a means to earn their
livelihood, and such propitiation is
also believed to guarantee success for
the following year.
Worship of Weapons
In earlier times, a common rite among
the warrior classes on the festival of
Dussehra (usually occurring within
October and November). This festival
has two different charter myths, both of
which mark the triumph of good over
evil. It is celebrated as the day that the
god Rama slew the demon Ravana, and
is also associated with the triumph of
the Goddess over a demon named
Mahishasura. Given the martial tone of
both charter myths, it is easy to see how
it would be associated with soldiers and
fighting, and thus this was considered a
day to worship one’s weapons, as a sym-
bol of the deity. According to popular
belief, any endeavor begun on this festi-
val day will invariably succeed, and for
this reason, Dussehra has been a
favored day to begin military cam-
paigns. Since Dussehra comes after the
end of the monsoon rains, in which any
travel is nearly impossible, this is a
favorable time from a strategic perspec-
tive as well.Yajnavalkya Smrti
