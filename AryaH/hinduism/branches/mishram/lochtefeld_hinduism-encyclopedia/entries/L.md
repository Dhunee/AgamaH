Laghava
(“simplicity”) In Indian logic, one of the
general principles in constructing and
pursuing an argument. According to the
principle of “simplicity,” when one is
presented with two equally plausible
theories, one should choose the theory
that is easier to understand and makes
the fewest assumptions. The primary
criterion in evaluating an argument
is the validity of the argument itself.
Only after this has been satisfied
may one raise objections based on com-
plexity or simplicity.
Laghima
(“lightness”) One of eight superhuman
powers (siddhi) believed to be conferred
by high spiritual attainment. This partic-
ular power gives one the ability to
become as light as one desires, bestow-
ing the ability to fly.
Lajpat Rai, Lala
(1865–1928) Lawyer, reformer, and mili-
tant Hindu nationalist. Born to a hum-
ble Punjabi family, Lajpat Rai became
wealthy from his legal work. By the age
of thirty-five, he was able to devote all of
his earnings to public work. He joined
the Arya Samaj while still in his teens
and supported Lahore’s Dayanand
Anglo-Vedic College, which was founded
in 1889. At the turn of the century he was
active in a variety of social and educa-
tional endeavors. He eventually entered
politics. He actively resisted British rule,
which brought him several prison terms.
Unlike many of his contemporaries, he
refused to advocate violence. His com-
mitment to politics ultimately cost him
[[384]]

his life; he died from injuries sustained
in a beating by the police while leading a
demonstration in Lahore.
Lakshmana
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lakshmana is one of
King Dasharatha’s sons by his wife
Sumitra, and the younger half-brother
of Rama, the epic’s protagonist.
Throughout the Ramayana Lakshmana
is the model younger brother, existing
only to serve and support Rama. When
Rama is banished to the forest for four-
teen years, Lakshmana follows him like
a shadow for the entire time: first living
as a forest ascetic, searching for Rama’s
kidnapped wife Sita, then fighting hero-
ically in the battle with Ravana’s army;
finally he returns to serve Rama at his
court in Ayodhya.
Many of the characters in the
Ramayana are paradigms for Indian cul-
tural values. Lakshmana (as with his
brother Bharata) symbolizes the ideal
younger brother. In northern India,
brothers are the heart of the joint family.
They remain at home, whereas after
marriage, sisters live in their marital
families. The eldest brother in every
generation eventually becomes the head
of the joint family. Carrying primary
authority and responsibility for the fam-
ily as a whole, the eldest cannot succeed
without the cooperation of his younger
brothers who must acknowledge and
support his authority. In his service to
Rama and his complete disregard for his
own needs, Lakshmana is a dutiful
younger brother.
Despite his bravery, valor, and total
loyalty to Rama, Lakshmana is far from
perfect. He lacks Rama’s judgment and
forbearance, and tends to act before he
thinks. For example, when Bharata pur-
sues the two brothers after they have
gone into exile, Lakshmana leaps to the
conclusion that Bharata is seizing the
opportunity to kill them, to clear his
own way to the throne. Lakshmana pre-
pares to attack Bharata, but Rama’s
reasoning forestalls a potential tragedy.Lakshmi
Lakshmana’s most serious lapse of judg-
ment is with Shurpanakha, a demon
princess and sister to Ravana, the
demon-king of Lanka. When she makes
amorous advances toward Lakshmana,
he first ridicules her and then mutilates
her. Ravana kidnaps Rama’s wife, Sita, to
gain a measure of revenge against the
brothers. Like all of the characters in the
Ramayana, Lakshmana is neither good
nor evil—he has many virtues, but also
some very real flaws.
Lakshman Jhula
Sacred site (tirtha) along the Ganges in
the Tehri district of the state of Uttar
Pradesh, roughly five miles upriver from
the city of Rishikesh. The site takes its
present name from a swinging foot-
bridge (jhula) that spans the Ganges.
The local charter myth describes
Lakshman Jhula as the place where
Rama and Lakshmana live as ascetics
late in their lives, atoning for the sin of
brahminicide, which they incurred by
killing Ravana and his brothers (who are
considered brahmin demons). Today,
the area is famous for the Svargashrama
of Swami Shivananda, part of a network
of ashrams along its banks.
Lakshmi
(“good fortune,” “prosperity”) Hindu
goddess and wife of the god Vishnu.
According to tradition, Lakshmi is created
when the ocean of milk is churned to
yield the nectar of immortality. Just as
butter is the refined essence of milk, so
Lakshmi is the refined essence of the
primordial ocean, representing all the
best things that come from it. Lakshmi is
associated with wealth, good fortune,
and prosperity, and is considered the
embodiment of all these things. Images
of Lakshmi usually depict her with the
lotus and the elephant, both of which
are associated with good fortune. Many
images show gold coins falling from her
hands, symbolizing wealth.
These potent associations make
Lakshmi an extremely important force
Thirteenth-century sculpture of the goddess
Lakshmi. She is considered the embodiment of
wealth, prosperity, and fortune.
in Hindu life. Lakshmi exercises her
power by her mere presence—when she
comes, she brings prosperity and good
fortune; when she leaves, these benefits
leave with her. Given Lakshmi’s power,
people are understandably eager to
please her, especially since she has the
reputation for being capricious and fickle
in her relationships with human
beings—a reputation that reflects a real-
istic appraisal of life’s vicissitudes.
Lakshmi’s capriciousness and her repu-
tation for being somewhat spiteful make
people extremely careful in their deal-
ings with her, to avoid insulting her,
even if unintentionally.
Lakshmi’s primary annual festival is
Diwali, when she is believed to roam the
earth. People spend the days before
Diwali cleaning, repairing, and white-
washing their homes, making them
[[385]]
Lakshmibai
suitable for welcoming the goddess. On
the evening of Diwali, people open all
their doors and windows (to facilitate
her entry) and place lights on their win-
dowsills and balcony ledges to invite her
in. Gambling is a common practice dur-
ing Diwali. Gambling is usually con-
demned as a pernicious habit, but
during Diwali it reaffirms the connec-
tion between money and Lakshmi—
here in her guise as Lady Luck.
Despite her capricious relationships
with human beings, Lakshmi is consid-
ered to be the model wife, particularly in
her devotion and subordination to her
husband. When Lakshmi and Vishnu
appear together, she is significantly
smaller, signifying her subordinate sta-
tus. Another common image of the cou-
ple shows Lakshmi massaging Vishnu’s
feet, and thus her wifely subordination.
Lakshmi is not only the model for
human wives but is also believed to be
incarnate in each of them. Married
women are believed to embody the
good fortune of the household. It is gen-
erally accepted that households in
which they are not honored will never
be prosperous. For more information on
Lakshmi and all the goddesses of
Hinduism, see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986. See also Tortoise

Lakshmibai
(d. 1858) Queen of the small kingdom of
Jhansi in the southern part of the state of
Uttar Pradesh and a leader in the 1857
struggle against the British, known as
the “Mutiny” or the “First War of Indian
Independence.” Lakshmibai’s kingdom
was the victim of expanding British
power. The British colonial government
had pronounced the “doctrine of lapse”
edict, annexing any kingdom in which
the ruler had died heirless. Lakshmibai’s
husband died in 1853. Although he had
adopted a son just before his death, the
British refused to recognize the adop-
tion and sought to annex the kingdom.
Lakshmibai was one of the leaders during
the 1857 rebellion; she died in battle.
[[386]]

She was eulogized as a patriot and pro-
ponent of Indian independence, and
because of her power and martial ability,
she is considered a manifestation of the
powerful goddess Durga.
Lakshmidhara
(ca. mid-12th c.) Scholar, commentator,
and author of the Kalpataru, one of the
earliest examples of commentary litera-
ture known as nibandhas (“collec-
tions”). The nibandhas were compendia
of Hindu lore, compiling themes from
the Vedas, dharma literature, puranas,
and other authoritative religious texts,
into a single volume. Each of the
Kalpataru’s fourteen volumes is devoted
to a particular aspect of Hindu life, such
as daily practice, worship, gift-giving,
vows, pilgrimage, penances (prayash-
chitta), purification, and liberation
(moksha). As one of the earliest niband-
has, the Kalpataru served as a model for
later writers. Lakshmidhara’s work is
unusual in that he uses very few sources
for his work—primarily the epic
Mahabharata, and a few of the sectari-
an compendia known as puranas.
Unlike later commentators, he does not
cite the Vedas, the earliest Hindu reli-
gious texts, or the prescriptions found in
the dharma literature. His text consists
almost solely of excerpted passages,
with very little commentary of his own,
whereas later nibandha writers often
give voluminous explanations.
Lakshmi-Narayan Temple
A modern temple in Delhi just west of
Connaught Place. It was built in 1938 by
Ghanshyamdas Birla, the patriarch of a
prominent industrialist family. Although
the temple is dedicated to the god
Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, it is
more commonly called the “Birla tem-
ple” after its patron. Since Lakshmi is
considered the bestower of wealth, and
the temple was built by a businessman,
this dedication is hardly surprising.
Aside from his religious endowments,
Ghanshyamdas Birla was also the majorLanka
financial support behind the Indian
National Congress, the political party
led by Mohandas Gandhi which strug-
gled to gain Indian independence. Since
the day it was built the temple has been
open to people of all castes and commu-
nities, upholding the denial of untouch-
ability that was one of Gandhi’s most
important crusades.
Lakulisha
(2nd c.?) Legendary founder of the
Pashupata religious community, a
group of renunciant ascetics whose
patron deity was the god Shiva.
Lakulisha appears to have been an
important influence in the development
of other Shaivite ascetics, such as the
Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas. He has
been identified as an incarnation of
Shiva. Many statues have been identi-
fied as Lakulisha’s image; he is portrayed
as a naked yogi with a staff in one hand
and a citron in the other, with penis
erect, either standing or sitting in the
lotus posture (padmasana). For further
information see David Lorenzen, The
Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas, 1972.
Lal Ded
Another name for the Kashmiri poet-
saint Lalleshvari. See Lalleshvari.
Lalitaditya
(8th c.) One of the few kings of the
Kashmir region who was able to affect
the politics of the northern Indian plain,
partially due to the fragmented state of
the Hindu kingdoms there. Lalitaditya’s
armies pushed into the Ganges River
valley, successfully halting the advance
of the Arab forces in the Punjab region.
His successors were unable to retain
these gains.
Lallavakyani
(“Lalla’s Sayings”) Corpus of poetry
ascribed to the Kashmiri poet-saint
Lalleshvari, a devotee (bhakta) of the
god Shiva. The poems in this collection
allude to the difficult circumstances of
her early life, and the domestic prob-
lems that induced her to leave her mari-
tal home. They also describe her
encompassing devotion to Shiva, whom
she describes as the only true source of
happiness. These poems have been
translated into English, but all the edi-
tions are quite old: see Sir George
Grierson and Lionel D. Barnett, Lalla
Vakyani, 1920; and R. C. Temple, The
Word of Lalla, the Prophetess, 1924.
Lalleshvari
(14th c.) Devotional (bhakti) poet-saint
also known as Lal Ded, who is one of the
most popular poets in Kashmir.
Lalleshvari was a devotee (bhakta) of
the god Shiva; her songs focus on her
devotion to him. Like many other
female devotional exemplars, she had a
difficult time integrating her marriage
with her commitment to her chosen
deity. According to tradition, her mother-
in-law treated her quite cruelly. Her
husband is described as an unfeeling
man who neither objected to the abuse
nor comforted his wife. After about
twelve years of suffering she left home to
wander as a religious seeker. To symbol-
ize her renunciation of all attachments
and earthly values, including feminine
modesty, Lalleshvari wandered nude.
During her wanderings she composed
and sang songs of devotion to Shiva,
which are still popular today.
Lanka
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lanka is the kingdom
of the demon-king Ravana. Although
Lanka is sometimes identified with the
modern island of Sri Lanka, and though
southern Indian sites such as
Rameshvaram have been identified
with events in the Ramayana, the epic’s
descriptions should be read as mythic
and narrative accounts, rather than a
geographical primer. The divine archi-
tect Vishvakarma had originally built
Lanka for Kubera the minor deity, but
[[387]]
Lankalakshmi
Kubera had been dispossessed by
Ravana and his brothers.
Lankalakshmi
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lankalakshmi is the
name of the guardian deity of Lanka,
the demon-king Ravana’s capital city.
Lankalakshmi is also the rebirth of the
goddess Vijayalakshmi, who has been
cursed by the god Brahma to serve as
Lanka’s guardian deity. The curse will
last until an intruder to the city manages
to defeat her, foretelling the fall of
Ravana. This defeat comes with the
arrival of the monkey-god Hanuman,
who leaps across the ocean in search of
the goddess Sita, whom Ravana has kid-
napped. Lankalakshmi recognizes
Hanuman as an intruder and attacks
him, fulfilling her duty as a guardian
deity. Hanuman knocks her flat with a
powerful blow, breaking the curse and
signalling Ravana’s fall.
Lasya
One of two general categories in Indian
dance, which is soft, lyrical, and conveys
a mood of love. Its contrasting form,
tandava, is athletic, dramatic, and con-
veys violence and power.
Lava
In the Ramayana, the earlier of the two
great Indian epics, Lava is one of the
twin sons of Rama, the epic’s protago-
nist. After their mother, Sita, has been
cast into exile at the ashram of the sage
Valmiki, Lava is born in the usual man-
ner. His brother, Kusha, is magically
created by Valmiki out of kusha grass.
Later, Lava and Kusha go with Valmiki
to Rama’s court in Ayodhya. It is in
Rama’s court that they first recite the
epic poem composed by Valmiki, the
Ramayana. After Rama gives up his
throne, he divides his kingdom between
Lava and Kusha.
[[388]]

Leap Philosophy
(“ajativada”) Leap philosophy affirms
that one can attain complete freedom
from bondage—which in the Indian
context is identified as the end of rein-
carnation (samsara) and final liberation
of the soul (moksha)—but such free-
dom cannot be gained by a precisely
specified sequence of causes and
effects. Since gaining freedom is not a
matter of cause and effect, there is no
way to stimulate or influence this
process through one’s actions. Leap
philosophers tend to denigrate the
effectiveness of ritual action as a way to
gain final liberation, except as a
preparatory phase, stressing that
liberation comes only through gaining
inner realization. Sureshvara and
Shankaracharya, members of the
Advaita Vedanta school, dismiss ritual
action, except as preparation for wis-
dom. Both philosophers believe that
release from bondage comes through
insight gained in a moment of realiza-
tion, which radically and permanently
shifts one’s perspective on the world.
Leather
Considered an impure substance by
many traditional Hindus, because it is
the product of a dead animal. They
believe that leather is an appropriate
material for shoes, however, because the
feet are deemed the lowest and most
impure part of the body. For this reason,
many people put on their shoes by slip-
ping their feet into them without using
their hands, thus avoiding touching the
leather with a higher part of the body.
Leather’s associations with ritual impu-
rity (ashaucha) make it inappropriate
for other sorts of clothing—clothing
which the hot Indian climate would ren-
der problematic—although now it is
sometimes used for handbags and brief-
cases. In earlier times people who
wished to avoid leather would wear
wooden clogs instead; in modern times,
footwear options also include plastic,
rubber, and canvas.Limitationism
Left Hand Tantra
A variation of the tantra; the rituals for
this “left hand” variety include con-
sciously violating taboos on nonvegetar-
ian food, intoxicating drinks, and illicit
sexuality. See Vamachara.
Levirate
An ancient practice, long condemned,
in which a childless widow would have
intercourse with her deceased hus-
band’s brother in an attempt to perpetu-
ate his line. See Niyoga.
Lila
(“play”) A word whose broad literal
meaning denotes any sort of play, game,
or sport, but which in a theological con-
text conveys a fundamental assumption
about how God interacts with the world.
According to this notion, the supreme
deity engages in creation not from any
sense of need, but for the sheer enjoy-
ment and entertainment gained from
creating and taking part in the world.
This is particularly true for the god
Vishnu, especially in his manifestations
as Rama and Krishna. In this under-
standing, all divine interactions
between God and his devotees (bhakta)
are undertaken in this spirit of play,
although in their ignorance human
beings may not recognize the true
nature of this encounter. Final liberation
of the soul (moksha) comes when the
devotee recognizes the true nature of
this encounter, since after that moment
of realization one’s entire life is a series
of playful interactions with God himself.
One of the ways that contemporary
devotees strive to enter Rama’s and
Krishna’s divine world is through dra-
mas that are themselves known as lilas.
These lilas can be attended for enter-
tainment, but viewing them can also be
a deeply serious religious act. When
child actors portraying the deities are in
costume and in character, they are con-
sidered manifestations of the deities
themselves. For ardent devotees, view-
ing these lilas is an avenue for gaining
God’s grace, and an entry-point into a
privileged, divine world. For an excellent
consideration of how Krishna’s entire
life is considered as play, see David R.
Kinsley, The Sword and the Flute, 1975;
for a description of the Krishna lilas, see
John Stratton Hawley, At Play with
Krishna, 1981; and Anaradha Kapur,
Actors, Pilgrims, Kings, and Gods, 1990.
See also Ram Lila.
Limitationism
Theory explaining diversity used by later
branches of the Advaita Vedanta philo-
sophical school, one of the “six schools”
of classical Hindu philosophy. This
school of thought upholds monism—
the belief that a single Ultimate Reality
known as Brahman lies behind all
things, and that all things are merely dif-
fering forms of that reality. Proponents
claim that reality is non-dual (advaita),
that is, all things are nothing but the
formless, unqualified Brahman, despite
the appearance of difference and diver-
sity. For the Advaitins, the assumption of
diversity is a fundamental misunder-
standing of the ultimate nature of
things, and therefore is a manifestation
of avidya. Although often translated as
“ignorance,” avidya is better understood
as the lack of genuine understanding,
ultimately causing human beings to be
trapped in karmic bondage, reincarna-
tion (samsara), and suffering.
Theoretically, if avidya is a defect that
resides within an individual, and if
many individuals can be afflicted with
avidya at once, is there one avidya that
afflicts everyone, or are there many sep-
arate avidyas? Limitationism asserts
that there is a single avidya, afflicting
many people at once. The theory pro-
poses that avidya, in a person, is like the
quality of color in an object. The color
blue may be a single property of two
coexisting objects; each instance of the
color blue does not use up a finite “blue-
ness” in the world. In the same way,
many people may possess the single
property of avidya.
[[389]]
Linga
The Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneshvar. Built in the eleventh century,
the temple exemplifies the Orissan branch of the Nagara architectural style.
Linga
(“mark,” “sign”) Aside from the word’s
literal meaning as any emblematic sign,
linga is also the name for the pillar-
shaped form of the god Shiva.
Representing Shiva as the power of gen-
eration itself, from which men and
women derive their procreative force,
the linga is sometimes simplistically
called a “phallic” symbol. An equally
important part of the linga’s image is the
base (pitha) in which the shaft is placed,
a base which represents the female
organs of generation. The Gudimallam
linga, the oldest known image of Shiva
in this form, shows him as male and
female, transcending the most basic
defining factor of human identity.
Lingaraja Temple
Largest and most important of the tem-
ples in the city of Bhubaneshvar, dedi-
cated to the god Shiva in his aspect as
Tribhuvaneshvar, the “Lord of the Three
Worlds.” The temple was built in the
[[390]]

eleventh century C.E., representing the
high point of the Orissan branch of the
Nagara architectural style. The temple
building culminates in one single, high-
est point over the image of the temple’s
primary deity, with shorter subsidiary
buildings leading up to it. The Lingaraja
temple shows all the elements of the
Orissan style: a beehive-shaped tower
(deul) soaring 120 feet high, fronted by a
dance hall (natamandira), traditionally
used for performances, an entrance hall
(jagamohan), and an outer entrance
hall (bhogamandapa).
Lingayat
Kannada-speaking religious community
whose members are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Shiva, and who mainly live in
the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
Lingayat roots began in the seventh cen-
tury with the Nayanar poet-saints in
Tamil Nadu state, migrating northward.
The community’s founder was the poet-
saint Basavanna; others includedLohar
Allama Prabhu and Mahadeviyakka.
The community’s founding members
were driven by the hunger for God and
were impatient with anything that got in
its way—worship of images, caste dis-
tinctions, or the demands of family life.
These early influences have continued
to shape Lingayat culture. Lingayats do
not use images in their worship. The
only symbol they use is the linga of
Shiva, which all Lingayats wear as a sign
of membership in the community. The
Lingayats have also largely retained
their founders’ egalitarian principles.
Although the community eschews caste
distinctions, there are higher-status
priestly families known as jangamas,
from whom the celibate monks known
as viraktas are often drawn. In practice,
this egalitarian emphasis has made the
entire Lingayat community a jati, one of
the endogamous social subgroups that
make up larger Indian society; the dif-
ference is that the Lingayats are not
marked by their occupation, but by their
membership in a particular religious
community. The Lingayats are the dom-
inant community in modern Karnataka,
both in terms of traditional landholding
patterns and in their control over
regional politics. For further informa-
tion see A. K. Ramanujan, Speaking of
Siva,

Lion
In Hindu mythology, a lion or a tiger is
the animal vehicle of the Mother
Goddess, as in her manifestation as the
goddess Durga. Modern iconography
shows the Goddess riding either of these
animals, with no seeming difference
between them, perhaps reflecting the
fact that the Hindi word “sher” can refer
to either the lion or the tiger. The fact
that the Goddess rides such a dangerous
animal is clearly a symbol of her power
and capacity. In her mythology these
animals are often described as her allies,
engaging in battle at her command.
Liquor
Condemned by the traditional Hindus,
although attitudes differ based on the
type of liquor consumed. Consuming
beer, wine, and distilled spirits (“foreign
liquor”) carries the stigma of adopting
“foreign” Western values; whereas con-
suming undistilled, fermented bever-
ages such as “country liquor” and toddy
carry the taint of low-class behavior.
Patterns of drinking tend to reflect and
reinforce these negative attitudes. Since
liquor is taboo in polite society, people
who drink will often finish the bottle in
one sitting and become intoxicated,
thus “proving” that there is no such
thing as responsible drinking.
Despite the general cultural disap-
proval, there are a few Hindu temples
where liquor is the everyday offering to
the deity. The worshipers also receive
liquor as prasad, the sanctified food or
drink that carries the deity’s blessing.
Alcohol has also been incorporated into
religious rituals in certain types of
tantric religious practice. Tantra is a
secret ritual-based religious tradition,
based on the belief that there is an ulti-
mate unity of everything that exists.
From a tantric perspective, to affirm
that the entire universe is one princi-
ple means that the adept must reject
all concepts based on dualistic think-
ing. One way to do this is to partake of
the “Five Forbidden Things” (pan-
chamakara), consciously breaking soci-
etal norms forbidding consumption of
intoxicants, nonvegetarian food, and
illicit sexuality. This is always done with-
in a carefully defined ritual setting, in a
conscious effort to sacralize what is nor-
mally forbidden.
Lohar
Traditional Indian society was modeled
as a collection of endogamous sub-
groups (in which marriage is decreed by
law to occur only between members of
the same group) known as jatis (“birth”).
The jatis were organized (and their
social status determined) by the group’s
hereditary occupation, over which each

Lohari
Lokacharya
(ca. early 14th c.) Religious leader also
known as Pillai Lokacharya, the founder
of the Tengalai branch of the
Shrivaishnava religious community.
The Shrivaishnavas are devotees (bhakta)
of the god Vishnu. The Tengalais
have no faith in human capacities,
emphasizing the need for the devotee’s
absolute surrender to the grace of God,
which alone will save the devotee.

hereditary occupation was black-
smithing and iron working.
Lohari
Festival falling on the night before
Makara Sankranti, the day when the
sun moves into the zodiological sign of
Capricorn, which almost always falls on
January 14. The central focus of this fes-
tival is a large bonfire. Celebrants collect
fuel for weeks beforehand, lighting the
fire on the evening of the festival. People
dance, sing, and walk around the fire,
giving the fire offerings of sweets, fried
snacks, and peanuts; these same items
are also given to those present as prasad
or sanctified food.
Lohari is a seasonal festival, marking
the passing of the coldest period of the
winter and anticipating the return of
warmer weather, symbolized by the fire.
This festival is celebrated in the Punjab
and in northern India where Punjabis
have settled. This festival also serves as a
public display recognizing some change
within the family. Families that have
recorded marriages or births in the past
year celebrate with particular fervor,
whereas families in which a person has
died usually refrain.

Lopamudra
In Hindu mythology, the wife of the
sage Agastya.
Lost Wax Casting
A method of metal-casting used to cre-
ate the southern Indian bronzes during
the Chola dynasty (9th–14th c.). The
artisan makes a wax image of the statue,
then covers the wax with layers of clay.
The clay is fired and the wax vaporizes,
leaving a clay mold into which molten
metal is poured. Once the metal cools,
the clay mold is broken, revealing the
statue. Small imperfections are removed
by hand, and the statue is polished to a
high gloss. This casting method produces
exquisite detail and subtlety of expres-
sion, but is extremely time-consuming
because each wax image and clay mold
can only be used once.
Lota
A vessel for holding water that usually
narrows near the top (so that the vessel
can be carried in one hand) with a flared
opening to facilitate accurate pouring.
The lota is used for drinking. Water can
be poured directly into one’s mouth
without touching the vessel to one’s lips,
which would render the vessel and its
contents impure. A lota is also often
used in bathing (snana), to pour waterLunar Month, Structure of

Arranged marriages, however, remain
far more common.
LothalLunar Line
Ancient city and archeological site located
near the Gulf of Cambay in the modern
state of Gujarat. Lothal was one of the
cities of the Indus Valley civilization, a
highly developed urban culture that
flourished in the Indus Valley region
between the fourth and third millennia
B.C.E. Lothal was a port city, although
because of silting, the present site is now
well inland. The size of the harbor indi-
cates that it was a prominent port.
Archaeological evidence suggests that
Lothal continued to flourish for nearly
[[500]]
 years after the decline of Harappa
and Mohenjo-Daro, the two largest
cities of the Indus Valley civilization.One of the two great mythic lineages in
Hindu mythology, the other being the

Love Marriage
In modern India, the name given to a
marriage fixed by the bride and groom
themselves, rather than an arranged
marriage fixed by parents or guardians.
Although Western romantic notions
consider a love marriage the preferred
method, many Hindus consider love
marriages suspect. Love marriages carry
the stigma of rebellion—children usurp-
ing the role traditionally played by their
parents. It is sometimes thought to pre-
sent the danger of inter-caste marriage
and the likelihood that the marriage will
be rooted in lust or infatuation, thus
rendering it potentially unstable. The
family is considered the foundation of
society; anything undermining its sta-
bility is viewed quite dimly. Love mar-
riages are becoming more common
and accepted among modern Hindus,
Lunar Month, Structure of
Hindu festivals are determined accord-
ing to a lunar calendar, in which a year
is made of twelve lunar months. The
lunar month is divided into two halves,
each of which has fifteen days. In north-
ern India the lunar month begins with
the dark (krishna) half—when the moon
is waning. This phase lasts fifteen days,
ending with the new moon. This is fol-
lowed by the light (shukla) half of the
month—when the moon is waxing. This
phase lasts fifteen days, ending with the
full moon. The day after the full moon is
the first day of the next lunar month,
and so on. Any given lunar day is desig-
nated by the name of the month, the
half (light or dark), and the lunar day (1
to 15). In southern India the pattern is
reversed, with the lunar month starting
with the light half and ending on the
new moon.
The lunar month, as with all Hindu
conceptions of time, represents chang-
ing times of auspiciousness and inaus-
piciousness, peaks and valleys marking
times that are more or less propitious.
The full moon, with its associations of
fullness, abundance, and light, is always
auspicious. It is believed that religious
rites performed on this day generate as
much merit as those performed for an
entire month. The new moon, with its
associations of darkness and emptiness,
is a more ambiguous time. At times the
[[393]]
Lunar Month, Structure of
new moon can be highly auspicious, as
on the occasion of a Somavati
Amavasya (new moon falling on
Monday). Several major festivals (such
as Diwali) fall on the new moon. Despite
this, the new moon is less auspicious
than the full moon. Within each fort-
night various days are also associated
with particular deities, and their devo-
tees (bhakta) often do particular rites on
those days: The eleventh day (ekadashi)
is dedicated to the god Vishnu, the
eighth day (ashtami) to the Goddess, the
evening of the thirteenth day (trayo-
dashi) and the fourteenth to the god
Shiva, and the fourth day (chaturthi) to
the god Ganesh.
As mentioned earlier, the lunar cal-
endar is the basis for almost all Hindu
holidays. To correct the discrepancy
between the lunar and solar year (about
eleven days), and thus keep these festi-
vals at about the same time every year,
an intercalary month is inserted every
[[21]]
⁄2 years. Although this extra month
keeps the calendar in balance, it is con-
sidered highly inauspicious, perhaps
because it is an unusual occurrence.
During this month people take normal
precautions to protect themselves dur-
ing inauspicious times—basically
putting off any new activities until the
month is over, and propitiating protec-
tive deities until the end of the month.
