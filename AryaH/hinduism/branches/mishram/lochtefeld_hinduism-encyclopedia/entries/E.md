Earth
In Hindu mythology, Earth is considered
a goddess. The notion that India is a
sacred land is one of the most deeply
rooted elements in Hindu life, and many
of India’s mountains, rivers, and other
geographical features are considered
gods and goddesses. This belief extends
to Earth itself. In the Vedas, the oldest
Hindu sacred texts, Earth appears as the
goddess Prthivi, who is lauded for her
fertility, her nurturing capacity, and her
firmness in supporting all things. Prthivi
almost always appears in conjunction
with Dyaus, a male deity associated
with the sky, whose name is a cognate
form of the Greek god Zeus. Sky and
Earth thus form the divine couple, with
the rain from the sky fertilizing and
energizing the earth.
In later mythology the figure of
Prthivi is supplanted by the goddess
Bhudevi (“Earth Goddess”), who is con-
sidered to be one of the wives of the god
Vishnu. Bhudevi is less frequently asso-
ciated with fertility and nurturing; her
primary function is as a supplicant to
galvanize the world-rescuing activity of
Vishnu. When the wicked become too
oppressive, or a demon becomes too
powerful and disrupts the cosmic order,
Earth cries out to Vishnu for help, and
Vishnu obligingly restores the cosmic
balance. One example of this is the Boar
avatar, in which Earth herself is rescued
from bondage by Vishnu. For further
information see David R. Kinsley, Hindu
Goddesses, 1986.
Earth
(2) In its material form, one of the
five elements in traditional Indian
cosmology, the others being water,
fire, wind, and akasha. In some
philosophical schools, each of the
elements is paired with one of the five
senses; in this case earth is associated
with smell. The element earth is also
associated with certain bodily functions,
especially the elimination of solid wastes.
Eating
Throughout the world the act of eating
is imbued with cultural significance and
cultural messages, and Hindu culture
makes no exception. Given the strong
emphasis on purity, Hindus pay signifi-
cant attention to the preparation and
consumption of food. Factors such as
whom one eats with, who may prepare
one’s food, and what types of food one
will eat and how it should be prepared
all send messages about the social status
of an individual or a community. The
groups with the highest status, particu-
larly brahmins, are the strictest with
regard to their dining habits. For the
most part, such high-status groups
adhere to a principle known as com-
mensality—that is, only eating food
cooked by members of their social
group. With regard to the content of
one’s diet, the great divide is between
vegetarian and nonvegetarian. An exclu-
sively vegetarian diet indicates higher
status, and among nonvegetarians there
are status gradations depending on
what types of meat one eats. For ortho-
dox Hindus, every meal is a potential
source of ritual contamination and must
be carefully monitored. Food cooked in
water is seen as far more susceptible to
pollution (ashaucha) and greater care is
taken in accepting it, whereas food fried
in oil or ghee is believed to be much
more resistant to pollution and thus a
lesser source of ritual danger. From a
religious perspective, the safest meal of
all is the meal that is cooked and eaten
at home. See also Vegetarianism.
Eclipses
Without exception, eclipses are consid-
ered highly inauspicious and ritually
[[217]]
Eighteen Minor Works
dangerous times. As in many other cul-
tures, Indian astronomers were able to
figure out the motion of the moon, and
thus could predict both solar and lunar
eclipses fairly accurately. The tradi-
tional mythic explanation for eclipses
comes from the story of the Tortoise
avatar, in which the gods and demons
agree to join forces to churn the Ocean
of Milk into the nectar of immortality,
which they will then share. The gods
manage to trick the demons out of
their share, but as the gods divide it
among themselves, the demon Sainhikeya
slips into their midst in disguise. As
Sainhikeya begins to drink, the sun and
moon alert the god Vishnu to
Sainhikeya’s presence, and Vishnu
quickly uses his discus to cut off the
demon’s head. Yet since the demon
drank some of the nectar, both his head
and trunk become immortal, with the
head becoming Rahu and the trunk
becoming Ketu. Rahu has particular
enmity for the sun and moon, the
deities responsible for his demise, and
tries to swallow them whenever he
meets them in the heavens. He always
succeeds, but since he no longer has a
body to digest them, they escape
unharmed through Rahu’s severed neck.
This association with Rahu makes
eclipses inauspicious and ritually dan-
gerous times, and in popular culture
eclipses are believed to emit malevo-
lent rays that have a physical quality.
Many people respond to this danger by
remaining indoors for the duration of
an eclipse. During an eclipse, people
will often perform rites of protection,
including giving donations (dana) as a
way to give away potential bad luck.
Pregnant women must take particular
care, lest the inauspiciousness of the
time affect the growing child. Some
believe that pregnant women should
lie completely motionless during an
eclipse, fearing that the child will be
born missing the body part corre-
sponding to the one that the woman
moved. After the eclipse, people bathe
(snana) and perform other rites of
purification to remove any possible
[[218]]

lingering taint of impurity (ashaucha)
or bad luck.
Eighteen Minor Works
(Padinenkilkanakku) Name given a col-
lection of early Tamil works of literature,
which was complete by the late fifth
century C.E. All of these works have
a moral emphasis and aim to inculcate
ethical or religious values in the hearers.
The two most famous examples in
this collection are the Tirukkural and
the Naladiyar.
Ekadashi
(eleventh day) Hindu religious life is
primarily based on the lunar calendar,
in which the year contains twelve lunar
months, each of which is divided
equally into “dark” (waning) and
“bright” (waxing) halves. Ekadashi is
the name of the eleventh day in both
the waning and the waxing half of the
lunar month. Certain days during each
half of the lunar cycle are deemed
sacred to particular gods and goddess-
es, and these are days for special wor-
ship. The ekadashi or eleventh day in
each half of the lunar month is deemed
sacred to the god Vishnu. With one
exception, each of the twenty-four
ekadashis has a separate name, charter
myth, prescribed rites, and promised
result for fulfilling it. Pious Vaishnavas
observe each of these twenty-four festi-
val days. In their order of occurrence
throughout the year, the ekadashis are:
Papamochani Ekadashi and Kamada
Ekadashi during the lunar month of
Chaitra, Baruthani Ekadashi and
Mohini Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Baisakh, Achala Ekadashi
and Nirjala Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Jyeshth, Yogini Ekadashi and
Devshayani Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Ashadh, Kamika Ekadashi
and Putrada Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Shravan, Aja Ekadashi and
Parivartini Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Bhadrapada, Indira Ekadashi
and Papankusha Ekadashi during theEknath
lunar month of Ashvin, Rambha
Ekadashi and Devotthayan Ekadashi
during the lunar month of Kartik,
Utpanna Ekadashi and Mokshada
Ekadashi during the lunar month of
Margashirsha, Saphala Ekadashi and
Putrada Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Paush, Shattila Ekadashi and
Jaya Ekadashi during the lunar month
of Magh, and Vijaya Ekadashi and
Amalaki Ekadashi during the lunar
month of Phalgun. Of these ekadashis,
some are more important to the general
populace than others, particularly
Devshayani and Devotthayan Ekadashis,
which mark the rainy season “sleep” of
Vishnu during the chaturmas period. The
only ekadashi to appear twice is Putrada
(“son-giving”) Ekadashi. This promises
that faithful observance will bring the
birth of a son, and its reappearance clear-
ly points to the traditional preference for
sons over daughters.
Ekalavya
In the Mahabharata, the later of the
two great Hindu epics, Ekalavya is a
figure who illustrates the pervasive
reach of the caste system. Ekalavya is
a tribal boy who wants to learn
archery from Drona, the royal archery
teacher, but is refused because of his
low birth. Undaunted, Ekalavya
makes a clay image of Drona, treats it
as his teacher, or guru, and through
assiduous practice and devotion to his
guru becomes the most skilled archer
on the earth. When Arjuna, a young
warrior-king and Drona’s best stu-
dent, discovers this, he becomes jeal-
ous and complains to Drona, since
Drona has promised Arjuna that no
one will surpass him as an archer.
Drona asks Ekalavya how he has
become so skillful. When he learns
that Ekalavya has worshiped Drona’s
image as his guru, Drona notes that he
is entitled to a preceptor’s fee (dakshi-
na). As his fee he requests Ekalavya’s
right thumb, a gift that will consider-
ably diminish Ekalavya’s shooting
abilities. Ekalavya fulfills Drona’s wish
without hesitation, but from that day
is no longer better than Arjuna.
Ekmukhi Rudraksha
A particular type of rudraksha, which is
a bead made from the dried seed of the
tree Elaeocarpus ganitrus. The rudrak-
sha is considered sacred to the god
Shiva, and is often strung into garlands
and worn by his devotees (bhakta). The
seed itself is typically round, with a
knobby pitted surface and a natural
channel in the middle through which a
thread can be easily drawn. It has nat-
ural divisions running from top to bot-
tom, which divide the seed into units
known as “faces” (mukhi). The Ekmukhi
Rudraksha is one in which the dividing
lines running from top to bottom are
completely absent, making the whole
seed a single and undivided piece. Such
a rudraksha is extremely rare, as well as
holy, for it is believed to be a manifesta-
tion of Shiva himself in material form.
Their rarity also makes them extremely
valuable, and street sellers routinely
counterfeit them by carving reproduc-
tions out of pieces of wood, often with
the symbol Om on one side.
Eknath
(1533–1599) Poet and saint in the
Varkari Panth, a religious community
that worships the Hindu god Vithoba, at
his temple at Pandharpur in the mod-
ern state of Maharashtra. Eknath was a
brahmin who lived most of his life in the
city of Paithan, which was an important
trading and political center. Today, there
is a shrine to Eknath in Paithan. In keep-
ing with his birth as a brahmin, Eknath
was highly learned in traditional
Sanskritic lore. His best-known work is a
translation into Marathi of the eleventh
chapter of the Bhagavata Purana, a
sectarian religious text that is the most
important for the worship of the god
Krishna. Yet Eknath also seems to have
been intensely conscious of the spiritual
capacities of the lower castes and the
way in which social boundaries could be
[[219]]
Ekoddishta
leveled by devotion. In short poems
known as bharuds he speaks in a variety
of voices, including those of untouch-
ables, Muslims, and women. Traditional
accounts of his life describe him as
treating untouchable devotees (bhakta)
as his equals, and even eating
and drinking with them. Such flagrant
transgression of social boundaries
brought trouble from more orthodox
brahmins—who are portrayed as the vil-
lains in these traditional accounts—but
on each occasion Eknath managed to
escape being outcasted by them, often
through divine intervention. For further
information see G. A. Deleury, The Cult
of Vithoba, 1960; Justin E. Abbott, The
Life of Eknath, 1981; and Eleanor Zelliot,
“Chokamela and Eknath: Two Bhakti
Modes of Legitimacy for Modern
Change,” in Journal of Asian and African
Studies, 1980, Vol. 15, Nos. 1–2, 1980. See
also Sanskrit.
Ekoddishta
“Intended for one [person].” A particular
type of shraddha or memorial service
for the dead, which is performed for the
benefit of a single person. An ekoddishta
shraddha can be performed as a series
of sixteen offerings performed during
the first year after the person’s death.
These sixteen offerings are more com-
monly collapsed into a single rite per-
formed on the eleventh day after death,
the day after the ten-day period of ritual
impurity (maranashaucha) has come to
an end.
Elements
Traditional Indian cosmology holds that
there are five basic elements, four of
which are similar to those found in
medieval European conceptions: earth,
fire, water, and wind (as moving air that
is perceptible to human beings). The
fifth element, akasha, has no readily
understandable correlate to European
ideas. It is generally translated as
“space” and is considered to pervade
the environment around us, filling the
[[220]]

empty spaces. An unusual feature in
Indian cosmology is that each of these
elements is associated with a particular
sense: earth with smell, fire with sight,
water with taste, wind with touch, and
akasha with hearing.
Elements, Subtle
The subtle elements (tanmatras)
are one of the stages in the evolution
of the world and the human being in
the Samkhya philosophical school.
The subtle elements are the basis for
the formation of the five gross elements:
earth, air, fire, wind, and akasha.
See tanmatras.
Elephant
In ancient India, one of the emblems
of royalty, in part because an elephant’s
prodigious appetite would soon
bankrupt any individual pretending to
have the wealth of royalty. Elephants
also appear in the Hindu pantheon:
The divine elephant Airavata is the
animal vehicle of Indra, and the god
Ganesh has an elephant’s head on a
human body, a souvenir of his conflict
with Shiva.
Elephanta
Island in the harbor outside the city of
Bombay, most famous for its temple to
Shiva by the same name. The date of the
temple’s construction is disputed, but is
generally ascribed to the seventh or
eighth century C.E. Elephanta is a rock-
cut cave temple, in which the sandstone
hillside was carved away to form the
temple itself, and the images of the
deities. This follows the general pattern
of the rock-cut temples at Ellora in
Maharashtra and required careful plan-
ning, since carving errors could not be
corrected. The Elephanta shrine dis-
plays images of Shiva in his various
forms: as Lord of the Dance (Nataraja),
as the Lord of Asceticism (Yogishvara),
as Bearer of the Ganges (Ganghadhara),
as the pillar-shaped form known as the
linga, and as the combination of maleEroticism
Stone columns carved into the entrance of a cave in Ellora.
and female known as Ardhanarishvara.
The central image, and by far the most
famous, is the three-headed, eighteen-
foot-tall image of Shiva as Maheshvar,
the “great Lord.” The face on the left
shows his horrific and destructive facet
as Bhairava, the face on the right his
benevolent, creative facet as Uma,
whereas the center face shows him as
Tatpurusha—blissful, eternal, and tran-
scending the ephemeral affairs of the
world. Although the primary image is
virtually untouched, many of the others
sustained damage from Portuguese
imperialists who considered the images
idolatrous and used them for target
practice. For further information see
Pramod Chandra, Elephanta Caves,
Gharapuri, 1970.
Ellora
Historical site in modern Maharashtra,
about twenty miles north of Aurangabad.
It is world famous for a group of thirty-
three rock-cut temples, which were
sculpted between the fourth and tenth
centuries C.E. Twelve of the caves have
Buddhist images, and these tend to be
the oldest; four of the caves are Jain, and
the remaining seventeen are Hindu. In
each case, the caves were created by
excavating into the volcanic stone out-
crop of the hillside, carefully cutting
away the stone to leave finished images.
Several of the Hindu caves have images
of exceptional artistic quality. The most
famous is the eighth century
Kailasanatha Temple for which the
entire hillside was cut away, leaving the
temple behind, looking as if it had been
built there from the ground up.
Endogamy
In an anthropological sense, a marriage
pattern in which members of a particu-
lar social group marry only members of
the same group. In northern India, tradi-
tional marriages tend to be endogamous
with regard to the jati (hereditary occu-
pational group), and exogamous with
regard to the village community and the
gotra (mythic family lineage).
Eroticism
Although Hindu religious life is often
associated with detachment and
[[221]]
Erotics, Texts on
Erotic sculptures decorate the facade of the Kandariya Mahadev Temple in Khajuraho.
renunciation, Hindu culture has also
fostered considerable eroticism, which
has a recognized place in everyday life.
One example of this is the Kama Sutra ,
a well-known “manual” on the art of
love, which is but one example of a liter-
ary genre called ratishastra, or “treatises
on [sexual] pleasure.” Other examples of
eroticism in the culture can be seen in
the sculptures carved on the temples
Konarak and Khajuraho, and in the
amount of attention given to poetry on
love. In Hindu culture kama (“desire,”
particularly sexual desire) is one of the
purusharthas, or aims of life, with the
others being artha (wealth), dharma
(religious duty), and moksha (final lib-
eration of the soul). Erotic pleasure
is thus recognized as a legitimate goal,
as long as it is kept in proper perspec-
tive. Although renunciation is one of
the great themes in Hindu life, nonre-
nunciation has been stressed at least
as strongly.
In modern popular Hindu culture,
eroticism is expressed through the eso-
teric ritual tradition known as tantra, in
[[222]]

which sexual union is a symbol for liber-
ation. Sexual intercourse is sometimes
incorporated as an actual element in
tantric ritual, as the most notorious of
the panchamakara or “Five Forbidden
Things.” Although tantric practice has
strong popular associations with illicit
sexuality, such acts are always per-
formed within a strict ritual context. In
tantric practice, the ultimate aim is not
to satisfy one’s carnal desires, but to
demolish the dualism between sacred
and profane that is ultimately a sign of
ignorance. The act of ritualizing normally
taboo behavior is one way to destroy this
duality, as well as a way to emphasize
the superiority of tantric practice over
other forms of religious life. In such
practice, the adept is also imitating
Shiva, who is himself both the perfect
yogi and the model husband.
Erotics, Texts on
One of the established genres in Indian
literature was ratishastra, or “treatises
on [sexual] pleasure,” of which theEvolution
best-known is the Kama Sutra . Sexual
pleasure was seen as an established part
of human life, which did not have to be
hidden, and for which no excuses were
necessary. Kama (as both “desire” and
“sexual desire”) was one of the
purusharthas or aims of life. Satisfying
one’s desires was seen as a legitimate
goal and considered a good thing, inso-
far as the pursuit did not interfere with
other ends. The texts on erotics analyzed
and classified sexuality in terms of aes-
thetic experience, as well as a vehicle
for physical pleasure. For its sophisti-
cated practitioners, such well-defined
sexuality was intended to provide fulfill-
ment for both partners, and here the lit-
erature is unusual for giving women
equal desire and equal pleasure.
Error, Theories of
Indian philosophical schools give seri-
ous consideration to the questions of
how and why people make errors in
judgment. Although these schools may
cite seemingly mundane examples, such
as mistaking the silvery flash of a
seashell for a piece of silver, investigat-
ing judgment errors is ultimately rooted
in religious goals. Specifically, the reli-
gious goal is to gain true awareness of
the actual nature of things, and through
this to bring about final liberation of the
soul (moksha) from the karmic cycle of
reincarnation (samsara). Each school’s
answers to the question of truth and fal-
sity reveal fundamental differences
about the understanding each has of the
inherent nature of things, which have
clear implications for bondage and lib-
eration. Although the differing schools
disagree on the mechanics of “how” one
sees silver instead of a shell, there is gen-
eral agreement about why such a mis-
take takes place. This and other errors
are rooted in the karmic predispositions
stemming from avidya, most specifical-
ly the greed that prompts human beings
to look for items of value. Far more
explanation can be found in the individ-
ual entries, but in brief there are six
major theories of error.
In the Prabhakara branch of the
Mimamsa school, the theory is akhy-
ati or “nondiscrimination,” in which
the source of error is the inability to
make sharp distinctions. The theory
in the Naiyayika school is any-
athakhyati, the “discrimination of
something else,” in which the mind
projects an erroneous perception
(pratyaksha) onto another object.
The Mimamsa philosopher Kumarila
explains error as viparitakhyati or
“contrary discrimination,” in which
the source of error is a bad assessment
of an object’s similarities and differ-
ences. The Samkhya school pro-
pounds the theory of sadasatkhyati,
or “discrimination of the unreal as the
real,” in which the source of error is
merely an extension of the original
error to distinguish between the two basic
realities, purusha and prakrti. Ramanuja,
founder of the Vishishthadvaita Vedanta
school, propounds the theory of satkhy-
ati, “discrimination of the real,” in which
one correctly perceives the silvery flash,
but makes an incorrect assumption
based on this. The final theory of anir-
vachaniyakhyati or “indescribable dis-
crimination,” is advanced by the
Advaita Vedanta school; according to
this, one illusory perception is superim-
posed on another conventionally true
but ultimately illusory perception. For
further information see Bijayananda

Philosophy, 1978; and Karl H. Potter
(ed.), Presuppositions of India’s
Philosophies, 1972.

Evolution
Fundamental doctrine of the Samkhya
school of Indian philosophy. The
Samkhya school uses a theory of evolu-
tion to explain the human perception of
[[223]]
Expiation
an inner world of subjective experience
and the objective outer world, which it
argues are not true aspects of the real, or
essential, world. Samkhya metaphysics
posits two principles as the essence of
the universe, purusha and prakrti.
Purusha is pure awareness, which is
conscious but inactive and unchanging.
Prakrti is primal matter which, in its
most basic form, is an equilibrium of
three different unconscious forces
(gunas): sattva (goodness), rajas (pas-
sion), and tamas (decay). According to
the Samkhya, the conflation and confu-
sion of purusha and prakrti is the basic
cause for the bondage of the soul to the
cycle of reincarnation (samsara)—
where purusha is seen as if it is acting,
and prakrti is seen as if it is conscious.
While this misunderstanding does not
effect purusha, it causes prakrti to
undergo an evolutionary process, in
which this primal matter becomes
increasingly differentiated, leading to
further confusion of the nature of the
universe. The first stage of evolution is
called mahat (“great one”) and occurs
when the original equilibrium between
the three gunas has been disturbed;
mahat is also known as buddhi, which is
conceived as the cognitive faculty nec-
essary for thought. The mental processes
facilitated by buddhi spur the develop-
ment of ahamkar (“I-making”), in
which one finds the first feelings of ego-
consciousness. With the rise of this sub-
jective feeling comes the division into
subjective and objective worlds: on one
hand, ahamkar evolves the five subtle
elements (tanmatras), the precursors of
the gross elements, and on the other it
evolves into the eleven faculties: five
jnanendriyas or sense organs, five
karmendriyas or organs of action, and
the mind as the eleventh. At liberation
this process of evolution happens
in reverse, with the many successively
devolving into the one. As in
most Indian philosophical systems,
liberation comes when correct under-
standing has replaced a mistaken
one. For further information see
