      <description>reject his (KuppusvAmi shAstri) identification of dramidacharya with tirumazhisai for obvious reasons.
If it was so, we would be seeing yamuna, ramanuja, desika etc mentioning abt this identity somewhere - we see no such reference. no hagiography mentions abt such Sanskrit works either. Otoh, we hear how he avoided reciting any Vedic phrase in keeping with his varna dharma. And none of the reasons given by sastri are really strong.</description>

      <description>Bharuchi and his Vedantic Views
Introduction Ramanujacharya (1017-1137 C.E.), in his Vedarthasamgraha [ref. 1, pg. 250-251], states: “This path which is shown in all the *srutis *whose meaning is very lucidly explained by the ancient commentaries composed by Bodhayana, Tanka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Kapardi, Bharuchi etc., and accepted by all those who are competent to judge, is only arrived at by *Bhakti *that has developed along the above lines.” From this passage, it appears that Ramanujacharya acknowledges these 6 teachers as ancient authorities whose views are acceptable to him.</description>

      <description>Source: TW
Among all the systems of vedAnta, it is vishiShTadvAita (vadakalai) that puts the most emphasis on trying to give a unified synthesis of the karma &amp;amp; j~nAna kANDa. Their panentheism+++(=God is greater than the universe and includes and interpenetrates it)+++ helps explain almost all the putatively conflicting views of scripture.
Due to this panentheistic realism, the advaitin-s viciously attack them with the charge that their system compromises the nirvikAratva and avyayatva of Brahman.</description>
