- Kernosovskiy and related images show shrauta kuNDa-s, praNIta-like pAtra & sruva or darvi; along with ithyphallic deity with weapons. Proto-shrauta fire-ritual, deity cults (even atimArga) and idol worship existed in parallel from ancient times.
- Invasion state (from [MT](/note/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/india/1_invasion/meta-invasion/articles/MT/identity-impact)):
  - The front end of the wave was led by IA speakers with a hotraka "indra-para" religious core. At their rear were the ancestors of the Kalasha & probably Brokpa (~~drokpa~~).
  - On the steppe, just behind the first wave was an IA group with a distinct religious approach -- Adhvaryava & viShNu-focal with some rudra-focal elements scattered in their midst.
  - A more rudra-focal group lay on the steppes in the borderland with the Ir.
- Prājāpatya tradition rose as well, leading to Aindra decline.
- Core saMhitA-s were compiled in the kuru-pAnchAla realm; followed by the brAhmaNa-s and then the sUtra-s. Ritual was standardized, with Adhvaryava domination.
- Unanchored brahmavāda (i.e., philosophy of brahman that gets increasingly decoupled from the ancestral pantheon) arose.
  - nAstika counter-religions emerged - jaina, bauddha ..
- "Unanchored sāṃkhyā resulted in philosophical developments (otherwise very parallel to the yavana ones) that increasingly lost touch with the foundational layer of the religion." ([MT](/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/tattvam/articles/MT/learn_from_platonists/))
  - yoga and sectarian proto-Agamas developed on sAnkhya and some brahmavāda foundations.
- "On the mīmāṃsā front, the development of the Śaunakīya tradition was limited and formulaic after the Bṛhaddevatā and Nirukta. Instead, daivimīmāṃsā was overtaken by tendencies that had a more Kautsa structure even if not explicitly so." ([MT](/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/tattvam/articles/MT/learn_from_platonists/))
- Sectarian ritual traditions, being more welcoming of non-Arya-s, grew in popularity, overshadowing the shrauta orthodoxy.
- Off brahmavAda rooted in brahma-sUtras (in some cases with sectarian Agama-s and purANa-s), various vedAntic schools developed.
- Agama-based systems overcame orthodox opposition ("Vedaviruddham") - based on writings and practices of shrautin-s who also adhered to Agama-s. 
- With severe decline in royal patronage, shrauta tradition declined further. vedAntic maTha-s stepped into the vacuum and lapped up remaining smArta-s.
- Post European invasion and the scientific revolution, some hindu-s reexamined the history of their religion and its sister branches (including platonism).
