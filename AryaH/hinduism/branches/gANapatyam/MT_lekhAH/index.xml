One of the unusual tantra inspired texts from Japan that shows the origin of the Japanese gANapatya cult from the uchChiShTa gaNapati stream is the kangiten kOshiki, which was composed by the Japanese sage Kakuban, who lived between 1095-1143. gaNapati is called kangiten in the Japanese pantheon. The great Japanese hero Sugawara Michizane was an ardent worshiper of gaNapati and is said to have attained his “siddhis” through the invocation of the Japanese equivalent of uchChiShTa gaNapati.</description>

gaNapati while being one of the most widely worshiped deities of the Hindu pantheon is one of the most poorly understood ones in terms of origins and history. The sectarian worship of gaNapati and kumAra unlike the vibrant and well-preserved shaiva, shakta and vaiShNava systems are largely extinct or facing extinction. The literature of the gaNapatyas is also largely neglected or unknown to most Hindus (A consequence of this is their inability to properly circumvent weak western productions like that of Courtright).</description>
