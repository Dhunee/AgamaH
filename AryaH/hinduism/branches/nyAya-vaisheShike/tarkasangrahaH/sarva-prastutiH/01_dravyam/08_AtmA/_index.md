<details><summary>VN Jha - Comment</summary>

Ātman is soul or Self.  
Atman is also God.  
Atman is a substance no doubt, but it is not of the nature of either earth, or water, or fire, or sky, or time or space or mind.  
It is a spiritual substance.  

It is the locus of our inner world namely, cognition, knowledge, happiness, unhappiness, desire, aversion, volition, merit, demerit and impressions.  
Atman is the material cause of these qualities.  
These qualities are produced only in the atman.  
These are the members of our inner world.  

Atman is not conscious by nature.  
But ātman alone is capable of becoming conscious.  
Conscious is one who has consciousness.  
Consciousness is the property of the conscious.  
Cetana is not consciousness.  
If ātman is said to be cetana, it can only be called locus of caitanya.  
Consciousness, therefore, is the property of the atman which makes the ātman conscious.  
This consciousness, therefore, is the cognition or knowledge or desire or volition in terms of which the atman is called cetana. 

Consciousness is the guna of the soul which is a substance.  

God, however, is always cetana because His knowledge, desire and volition are eternal.  

An individual Self is cetana only after jñāna or iccha or prayatna is produced in him.  
His knowledge or desire or volition is a product because it is acquired and hence non-eternal.  

Atman alone is capable of becoming cetana.  
In jīvātman, jñāna is said to be agantuka i.e. a kārya or a product.  


[[31]]

The jīvātman acquires knowledge through the instrument of mind and an instrument cannot be equated with the agent who uses it and therefore, ātman is not even 'mind'.  

Atman is a distinct spiritual substance.  
God alone is always cetana, because He possesses eternal knowledge.
