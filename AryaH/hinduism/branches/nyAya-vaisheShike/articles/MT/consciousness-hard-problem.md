title = "Consciousness - Hard problem"
+++
After all the hard problem has more of a philosophical implication: if you ask an average person is another man conscious, they will say yes. If you next ask them is a fly is conscious then some would agree it is. If you as them if a plant is conscious even fewer might. If you ask them a stone is conscious most might say no. Now if you ask them the reason for their responses then some might invoke some aspect of biology. 

If that intuition is right then you have to ask why that is so? The more you probe people in this regard you find that they have difficulty presenting a completely coherent model for "emergence" of this property of consciousness -- there is a leap of faith at some point where it is equated to **computational self-awareness**+++(5)+++ -- i.e., a system that has a feedback loop in the computations it performs should be conscious. However, there is no logical bridge between this and qualia -- the first person experience. Hence a hard problem.
