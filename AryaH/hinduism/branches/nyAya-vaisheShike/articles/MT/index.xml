      <description>Source: here.
The bhagavata purANa preserves the 5 anuShTubhs composed by glAva maitreya, the udgAtA of the kurus, when he was asked about the atomic doctrine by vidura vaichitravIrya. It contains a clear exposition of the atomic doctrine. It is interesting that these openly vaisheShika mantras are preserved along side the more theistic formulation of typical of the sAMkhya associated with pA~ncharatra. It may also suggest the source for the elements of atomism in vaiShNava tantras like the lakShmI tantraM.</description>

      <description>After all the hard problem has more of a philosophical implication: if you ask an average person is another man conscious, they will say yes. If you next ask them is a fly is conscious then some would agree it is. If you as them if a plant is conscious even fewer might. If you ask them a stone is conscious most might say no. Now if you ask them the reason for their responses then some might invoke some aspect of biology.</description>
