One question that Western philosophers usually ask is whether there is such a thing as ‘Indian philosophy’ and, if so, what are the topics, questions and problems it raises. Philosophy is hard to delineate in general, yet there are typical questions it poses, and knowing them, rather than laying down its definitions, is perhaps a better way to understand it. The second set of questions raised more recently is whether ‘Comparative Philosophy’ constitutes a genuine method or a self-subsisting discipline in the vast field of World Philosophy. If philosophy must go global, being as it were an universal domain of inquiry that transcends all temporal, geographical, and cultural boundaries, then the response is in the affirmative, hence Indian texts must supply both a contribution as well as a precise account of their own standing point and research questions. The most fundamental and, at the same time, most difficult problem in comparative philosophy remains ‘translation,’ for readers must not only understand the unique nature of the Indian philosophical concepts themselves, free of any Western bias, but they also must be able to translate them properly into the general World philosophical language. For that to happen, scholars need to expand and build a new philosophical glossary, with input from all known forms of linguistic contexts, including Sanskrit. Things have more than one meaning-definition, therefore, translations must do justice to each shade or layer of meaning an object carries. However, there are instances when Indian philosophical concepts are harder, if not impossible to comprehend; thus, one must go about such conundra by simply looking at fundamental and idiosyncratic research questions, which define the general philosophical inquiry. Philosophy is impermanent not because of its solutions, but rather through its questions. The scholastic Sanskrit tradition has demonstrated that new inquiries arise always in respect to the ancient texts and through their translations, fresh interpretations and change of meaning does occur in the history of Indian philosophy, albeit sluggishly. Thus, there is arguably scope for creative progress, even here. One such change is the one that the commentators on various Sūtra texts had brought, which consisted mainly of bringing new shades of meaning, and together with it a new school of interpretation, all this by claiming to offer either a hidden meaning unexplained by the founder of the school, or by simply extending the list of categories \(padārtha\) in view of strengthening and defending their own tradition, now under attack. 





To introduce Indian philosophy to readers of Western philosophy, we should recall the old naturalist questions posed by the Pre-Socratics, those who coined the term. Therefore, what defines ‘philosophy’ is not the propositions taken to be true, but rather the constant perennial questions that lie at the basis of any fundamental description of the fabric of the world. To put it differently, philosophy develops first from realistic premises, with ontology, rather than logical inferences, with intuitions rather than justified reasons, with questions rather than definitions and presuppositions. Indeed, when one looks at the theories put forward by the first Pre-Socratic thinkers, namely the questions that Ionian, Pythagorean, and Eleatic physicists addressed, and then, when we compare these with the first Vedic philosophical speculations, one cannot but be struck by the seemingly analogous questions the early Vedic and Pre-Socratic philosophy gave rise to.1 Such questions lie in the zone of ‘ontology.’ Thus, Zeller differentiates 2 stages in the development of Pre-Socratic thought. The first is marked by questions on ‘substantial causes’ 

\(Thales, Anaximander\) and ‘essential natures’ \(Pythagoras, Anaximenes\), while the second stage raises questions related to the ‘origin,’ ‘decay,’ and ‘change’ of the world \(Heraclitus\), as well as the laws that cause such phenomena \(Empedocles\). 2 

One may see in the latter a maturation of inquiry from the fundamental questions about ‘being’ and a shift to those regarding ‘becoming’ for these take into account the importance of oneness and multiplicity \(Xenophanes\), and rationality in the framework of a philosophical realism \(Parmenides, Zeno\). Questions on the substantial cause of the world, the stuff out of which everything came to be, or what is the essential nature of which the ‘world’ \(one being\) or ‘things’ \(many beings\) consist of, are examples of naturalist types of inquiry. 

The second stage of Greek Pre-Socratic thought, one that resembles the Vedic and Upaniṣadic philosophy, raises questions about substantial ‘change’, apparent ‘transformation’ of the world, and what are the laws and principles behind these. These were explained by postulating the laws of combination and separation of ultimately imperishable substances. This stage includes atomic theories \(Leucippus\) and explanations about the cyclical and disintegrating nature of the world, primordial elements, which are qualitatively different from each other, limited in number, and infinitely divisible \(Empedocles\), questions about one universal cause such as a primordial ‘mind’ \(νοῦς\)\(Anaxagoras\), and questions about the essence of the world spoken of in terms of either ‘Being’ \(Parmenides\) or ‘numbers’ \(Pythagoras\).3 The rationale of this preliminary survey on the Pre-Socratic Greek philosophy is important because of their conspicuous resemblance with the problems raised by the early Vedic and Upaniṣadic seers.

here is that the first philosophical questions in philosophy lie in the zone of ontology \(nature of things\) and its broader domain, metaphysics \(relation of things\). 

Now, regarding the difference between ontology and metaphysics, one conceptual and methodological distinction must be made, one that is not always clearly drawn in modern analytic philosophy, because both terms are often used interchangeably. It is, it seems, that the Aristotelian corpus determines a terminological difference between the two, for it articulates a science of ontology that inquiries about ‘ontic beings’ \(τὰ ὄντα\) \(Categories 1a20\) and the formulation of a ‘science of being-as-being’ \(ἔστιν ἐπιστήμη τις ἣ θεωρεῖ τὸ ὂν ᾗ ὂν\) \(Metaphysics, Book Γ, 1003a\). Heidegger too seems to follow a distinction between ontology and metaphysics in his ‘Being and Time’ \(1927\) where he distinguishes an ‘ontological’ inquiry of a most general concept ‘Being’ \(Dasein\) from a more specific ‘ontic’ inquiry regarding beings caught in temporal existentiality.4 If we are to take into account both ancient and modern understandings, ontology is, and should therefore be, the ontic inquiry into the nature of beings and their essential and existential nature. Its purpose would then be to elucidate as far as we can the meaning of ‘Being’ \(a most elusive concept in metaphysics\) and its multifarious components, manifestations, real and mental events. Furthermore, it is important to mention that ontology implies a taxonomic agenda, whereas metaphysics is a broader domain that takes into consideration and elaborates upon the causal and logical relations between the ontic categories, putting them all in a broad ‘picture of the world.’5 Quinton goes as far as to say that any metaphysical system must arrange its categories into a sort of hierarchy, and that such an arrangement is ‘ontology.’ As we shall see, in Indian philosophy such a vertical display is characteristic of the Sāṃkhya school with its own successive stages of evolution derived from a primaeval elemental nature \(prakṛti\), whereas Vaiśeṣika, another important school, exemplifies a horizontal form of ontology, where categories are displayed synchronically, standing as they were in a relation of inter-dependence. 6

If metaphysics is – within the context of modern analytic philosophy – a domain that presents, by rational means, a general ‘picture of the world,’7 this should not be confused with a mere encyclopaedic account of the elements of such a picture, for metaphysics must include the domains of knowledge and language too. In Indian philosophy, taxonomy and enumeration is important, for as Vyomaśiva, 

[^4]: The difference between ‘Being’ \(ontological domain\) and ‘beings’ \(ontic domain\) has been revived more recently by Heidegger in Being and Time. \(1962 English trans\). 

[^5]:  Quinton 1973: 237. 

[^6]:  Halbfass 1992: 48–9. The order is, of course, a simplification; as far as Vaiśeṣika is concerned, its ontological categories are related both vertically, into a system of supervenience, as well as horizontally, for the category of particularity \(viśeṣa\) is a horizontal derivation of the quality of distinctness; as I shall argue later, the Vaiśeṣika ‘picture of the world’ is a realistic immanent pluralism. The synchronic arrangement is most telling when we analyse the nature of abstract substances, time, space, vacuum, and soul, which are said to be all-infinite and all-pervasive, which implies the assumption that these can co-exist as the same time and space. 

[^7]:  Quinton 1973: 235. 



a 9th century Vaiśeṣika commentator explains, philosophy intends to enumerate everything in the world that has the character of being.8 Another important characteristic, which is relevant for the study of Vaiśeṣika, is that metaphysics is not the simplification of Parmenides’ axiom ‘thinking is being’, or the Socratic thought-form dualism \(Timeous 51d-e\), but as Vaiśeṣika illustrates, thought is indeed only one component of reality, in the complete ontological framework, which stands on 3 important levels which are recognised even by modern analytic philosophy:9 \(1\) the basic or the ultimate; \(2\) the derived, or dependent level; and \(3\) the illusory or the fictitious. 10 As to how Vaiśeṣika presents its 6 categories, 11 

this tripartite pattern is most visible in the description of the chief category, namely ‘substance’ \(dravya\), upon which the whole edifice of the system’s metaphysics stands, for it is spoken in relation to adjacent categories, such as ‘qualities’ and ‘motion’ that substance relates to and is defined by. ‘Sub-stance’12 is the 

most basic category \(point 1\), particularly when it is regarded as a genus-universal \(sāmānya\), that is to say, as a simple all-pervasive essence in which the multitude of qualities are inherent. Between them, the latter represents the ‘species’ 

known by ‘lower universals’ \(point 3\), while the derived, or the dependent ontic level discussed previously stands in Vaiśeṣika philosophy for the ‘ultimate particularity’ \(antyaviśeṣa\) \(point 2\); its existence is infinite due to its inter-dependent nature within the universal. Point 3 of Vaiśeṣika metaphysics, this edition argues, could forcefully complement the controversial and dualistic matter-form \(later on essence-versus-existence\) tension and debate that pervaded the history of Scholastic philosophy from the post-Aristotelian age down to Duns Scotus and 

[^8]: Vyomaśiva’s Vyomavatī \(vol. 1, p. 21\), and Udayana’s Kiraṇāvalī \(GOS, p. 148\) talk about an ambitious intention of Kaṇāda, the founder of the system, to ‘enumerating everything in the world that has the character of being,’ via Halbfass, 1992, p. 69. 

[^9]:  Anthony Quinton, The Nature of Things 1992, I shall refer to this work throughout. 

[^10]:  Quinton 1973: 242. In Indian philosophy, we see the tripartite grades of metaphysics in Candramatī, who distinguishes between highest universality \(sattā\) and a specific universality \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\), both of which are part of the category of universal \(sāmānya\); if we analyse these 2 universals alongside particularity, as both Candrānanda and Praśastapāda do, then we obtain 3 levels of reality. The tripartite classification fits well with analytic philosophy, and Indian thought as well. 

[^11]: Each Indian philosophical system \(darśana\) must be approached through the list of its ‘categories’ 

\(padārtha\), for a list of these, see the Grimes dictionary 1996: 235–8. It is recommended, however, with great caution, for this dictionary, though a starting point, contains entry definitions that do not discuss divergent contradictory padārthas, which occur among commentators inside 1 school. 

One should be aware of the difference between the categories preserved in the founding sūtra texts, and the inflated list, which the subsequent commentators added. For example, if we look at Vaiśeṣikasūtra in its independent form, it seems to have had originally only 3 basic categories: substance \(dravya\), quality \(guṇa\), and action \(karma\), yet the commentarial tradition begins to discuss 6 categories, appending to these another 3: universal \(sāmānya\), particularity \(viśeṣa\) and inherence \(samavāya\). It worth mentioning that the ‘addition’ of 3 categories does nothing but characterise and elucidate the nature of the 3 fundamental categories, in particular, the substance category, and its relation to qualities, and more generally, cosmic ‘karmic’ motion. 

[^12]: Substance is a notoriously fuzzy translation for dravya, for a discussion of this, see the fifth chapter of Wilhelm Halbfass, On Being and What There Is, 1992.

Neo-Scholasticism.13 By contrast, metaphysics, as considered by Vaiśeṣika, has 3 descriptive levels: \(1\) a vast universality \(sāmānya\); \(2\) a specific universality \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\); and \(3\) an ultimate particularity \(antyaviśeṣa\). These are all characterised by ‘existence’ \(sattā\), which has an ontological universal status as well. This tripartite metaphysical model would be challenged further by later 

Vaiśeṣika scholastics, for instance, Śivāditya14 and Candramatī.15

Ontological categories \(padārtha\) undergo a considerable change under Praśastapāda \(6th century AD\). His work, not a ‘commentary’ \(vṛtti\), but rather an innovative ‘digest’ \(bhāṣya\), introduces, under the influence of Pāśupata 

Śaivism,16 a new theistic interpretation of the world and the origin of its constituent parts.17 His stress lies on epistemology more than on the ontology of being, as had been taken in its nominal, substantial form by Candrānanda. The nature of being is narrowly linked with that of thinking. As in the tripartite metaphysics mentioned earlier, the categories of Praśastapāda have 3 major basic features: they possess existence ‘existentiality’ \(astitva\), ‘knowability’ \(jñeyatva\), and 

‘nameability’ \(abhidheyatva\), and correspond to the 3 major areas of philosophical inquiry: ontology, epistemology, and language, respectively.18 The change Praśastapāda brought into the system is a subordination of ontology to epistemology, a fact that singles him out within the overall canonical tradition. Though Vaiśeṣika is usually regarded as an ontological system \(Halbfass 1992\), the textual evidence we have illustrates that we are dealing with something more than just an ontic enumeration. It puts forward a complex system of descriptive metaphysics, which combines elements of physics \(natural philosophy\), and draws different distinctions. Such distinctions are for instance between ritual actions and moral intentions, between perception, and inference, and intuition; relational distinctions between inherence and conjunction; between names, definitions, and abstract objects; between substance and essence; between quality and substratum; between laws and motions; between mind and mental states; between values and

[^14]:  Śivāditya SP p. 9 \(he classifies universal in ‘near universal,’ ‘remote universal,’ both ‘near and remote universal’\); we come across this tripartite gradation of metaphysics in Candramatī, who distinguishes between highest universality \(sattā\) and a specific universality \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\), both of which are part of the category of universal \(sāmānya\). If we analyse these 2 universals alongside particularity, as both Candrānanda and Praśastapāda do, then we obtain 3 levels of reality, which is accepted by both analytic philosophy and Indian thought. 

[^15]:  Candramatī DP 1.1. mentions 10 categories, but interestingly enough, he enumerates, alongside universality and particularity, a 9th category called commonness; it is worth asking what the difference and relationship are between commonness and universality; could it be that commonness is that lower universal that links particularity with universality as in the case of Candrānanda?

goals; and, last but not least, between karmic transmigration and ontic liberation. 19 

These are only some problems and questions addressed by Vaiśeṣika in particular, and Indian philosophy in general. 

The aim of this edition of Vaiśeṣikasūtra is, therefore, to introduce students of Western philosophy to some of the categories of Indian philosophy, and by way of this to demonstrate the necessity of conceptual correlation between Indian philosophy \(particularly Vaiśeṣika\) and the perennial and insoluble questions of today’s World philosophy. Despite the hurdles we face in translation, both textual-philological and philosophical-conceptual, nevertheless, the authors of this edition highlight that philosophical understanding lies in relations and correlations, a fact shown by Vaiśeṣika’s own categories bound by logical interconnections, 20 tele-

ological goals, and value-related implications. 21 Moreover, the project of comparative philosophy is arguably the continuation and confirmation of Strawson’s proposition that there is such a thing as a ‘central core of human thinking’ beyond history, and that there are categories and concepts of fundamental character that remain undiminished throughout time. 22 This present edition argues that by matching unrelated systems of thought \(Indian, Greek, analytic, and so forth\), our knowledge rebuilds and reconstructs while the ontic definitions of the world gain more clarity than has ever been possible. This work supports the idea that philosophy is a counterpart of history and that understanding comes not only through philological and empirical archaeological data, but also from relations, comparisons, and epistemic intuitions. 

One simple way to understand Indian philosophy is by looking into the research questions that a Vaiśeṣika student addresses in the opening dialogue of gloss VSc 1.1.1, on the one hand, and to the fundamental ontic categories of gloss VSc 1.1.4–6 on the other hand. The opening discussion between a teacher and a student is characteristic of the conversational mode of transmission of classical and early medieval Indian philosophy, a mode of teaching that was widespread in both Classical Greece \(see Plato’s Dialogues\) as well as in the Upaniṣads \(see Dialogue between Uddālaka Āruṇi and Śvetaketu\). At origin, the aphoristic style of Indian philosophy is either Śramaṇic or Buddhist. The second section of the Pāli canon known as Sutta Piṭaka comprises a vast number of ‘threads’ of thought \(‘sutta’ in Pāli, ‘sūtra’ in Sanskrit\) recognised to be the sayings of the Buddha himself. Sūtras, however, should not be confused with either ‘mantras’ \(in the Vedas\), or with ‘ślokas’ \(poetical verses that follow a precise meter used in the

Contrary to post-colonial theory, comparative philosophy argues that philosophical conversation should not make any judgements of superiority, or inferiority, nor the conversion and domination of thought over and above the reality of being, to which philosophy is committed.

epic literature\). The preservation of the sūtras is problematic, not least because they – unlike mantras and ślokas – lack in rhyme and beauty, which otherwise render them easier to memorise and transmit. These sūtras became the ‘founding 

texts’23 of certain scholastic schools: Mīmāṃsāsūtra, Vaiśeṣikasūtra, Nyāyasūtra, Yogasūtra, Pāśupatasūtra, Kāmasūtra, Sāṃkhyasūtra, 24 and Brahmasūtra are only a few examples of texts that generated subsequently a scholastic commentarial tradition. Yet readers should be cautious when interpreting these fundamental sūtra texts because their preservation in their current state is most probably inflated. 

A closer reading of their thread of thought shows that they contain not only the fundamental tenets of their own school, but the counter-arguments of opponents as well, which a careless reading would take to be the system’s own views. Thus, the reconstruction of the basic tenets of the sūtra-text must come from a thorough knowledge of the commentarial tradition, internal and external, as well as from further archaeological work \(textual-critical collation on manuscripts\). Hindu orthodox philosophical systems \(āstika\), that is to say, those that take the Vedas and Upaniṣads as authoritative for their tenets, developed to counter the forceful Buddhist rise, particularly the highly effective sūtra-style of philosophising. 

Teaching was heavily oral, hence, the style of these aphorisms had a mnemo-technic role in preserving such philosophies. The aphoristic style helped boost the spread of new currents of thought that had been common in other parts of the world, for instance, in ancient Greece among the Pre-Socratic thinkers25 and in 

Europe down to Nietzsche. 

Indian philosophy developed in a scholastic manner and current readers who study it are usually equipped with skills similar to those that European Classicists and Medievalists possess.26 Indian scholasticism presents many problems related to authorship, doctrinal change, and time of composition. Indeed, these are highly contentious issues in the history of Indian thought and have much to do with the way in which orthodox Hindus usually view their Vedic and philosophical thought: as an authorless, changeless, and timeless revelation handed down to sages from a remote past. Although conceptual or philosophical change does happen in the history of Indian thought, its progression is very slow indeed. Unlike Sanskrit scientific works \(astrology and mathematics\), the colophons of Sanskrit philosophical manuscripts hardly mention any date, and very little is known about

[^25]:  Heraclitus \(c. 475–535 BC\) seems to have handed down his thought in ‘pregnant, picturesque sentences which were often oracular and laconic to the point of obscurity,’ a fact that gained him the surname of ‘The Obscure,’ Zeller 1895: 66. 

[^26]: Yet, more recently, Indian philosophy has been approached in a more creative manner \(logics and epistemology\), for instance, the school of Bimal Krishna Matilal and his pupil Jonardon Ganeri; an even bolder and creative approach combining ancient and modern perspectives on ancient and modern philosophy is found in Richard Sorabji, Gandhi and the Stoics: Modern Experiments on Ancient Values, 2012. 



the founding fathers and authors.27 In order to either reconstruct an author or a concept, internal bibliographical references within one school, as well as external ones \(rival schools\), must be traced and taken into account ahead of others, as the latter ones might be free of bias and speculative change of mind. Once again, fresh textual and archaeological material is highly useful but insufficient; understanding Indian philosophy requires not only painstaking philological effort, but also wide-

ranging knowledge of Sanskrit language and literature.28

A common trunk of origin for the ramification of various systems is sometimes easier to pinpoint in Indian thought and literature, for unlike in the Western thought where philosophical insurrections and original ideas have been deeply sought, in the context of Sanskrit scholasticism, such insurrections and ideologi-cal ‘-isms’ hardly arise. With the exception of unorthodox systems \(for instance, Jaina, Buddhist, Cārvāka\), the function of Indian thought, particularly the Hindu one, is to justify, expand, and complement the original authoritative texts, not to criticise them. 29 However new an Indian philosophical system is, the tendency Brahmin philosophers have is to call on the authority of the Vedic and Upaniṣadic corpus to justify its orthodoxy. 

The history of Indian philosophy developed around ‘3 tensions,’ which may be classified as philosophical, religious, and social. Regarding the first, monistic interpretations about an ‘ultimate essence’ of reality often clashed with pluralistic worldviews that defined substance by ‘difference’ not simplicity \(Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika, Jaina\), facts which brought an inevitable tension between ‘idealism’ and ‘realism.’ A second type of tension is felt among influential religious traditions \(Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, Smārta, and Śākta\) of the second millennium AD that assimilate various orthodox ‘classical philosophies’ 

\(darśana\) into their own unified theologies. The result is a binary amalgamation \(e.g. Vaiśeṣika with Nyāya; Sāṃkhya with Yoga; Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā with Vedānta\), or the creation of further conceptual tensions between ‘immanent’ and ‘transcendent’ \(in Śaivism\). New theological doctrines such as the nature of knowledge or god would create further religious tensions, splits, and dissensions within the great Vedānta philosophy. There is also a more recent \(modern\) tension in Hindu philosophy, one that concerns modern Indian culture and society and produced new interpretations of Hinduism. This is a tension that only flourished recently \(19th–21st centuries\), chiefly as a response to the Western colonial challenge. Its interpretations revisit perennial philosophical themes concerning ‘freedom’ \(individual and collective\) \(Aurobindo\) as well as social and religious Indian ‘inclusiv-ism’ and ‘pluralism’ \(Ambedkar, Gandhi\). These new contributions are not in the

least negligible, for their general outlook is comparative and synthetic, drawing 

upon and balancing traditional with modern views.30

Given the previously discussed definition of metaphysics in analytic philosophy, as a ‘picture of the world’ \(Quinton\) explicitly, it is striking that when one looks at the classical orthodox Hindu systems, each of these individualises itself by putting forward a distinct view of reality, a worldview for which the term ‘darśana’ 

is a case in point. The term derives from the first-class stem √ dhṛ, which gives the past participle dhṛta meaning ‘uphold, maintained.’ The stem gave the Vedic concept of Ṛta, as well as dharma, the latter of which developed significantly into a multitude of meanings and usages. Of these, only 2 basic connotations will be discussed, one ontological, the other epistemological. When a philosophical darśana31 

focuses on the ontological, then the system deploys various ontic taxonomies and its defining feature is generally realistic pluralism. From this point of view, Sāṃkhya, Vaiśeṣika, Jaina, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā, and Nyāya might be considered realistic philosophies. When, on the other hand, such philosophies subordinate ontology to a form of ultimate knowledge, then a form of monistic idealism prevails. In this category, one may see Vedānta philosophy with all its subdivisions: Advaita, Bhāmatī, Vivaraṇa and Sureśvara’s Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, and Bhedābheda,32 with the exception of 

Dvaita Vedānta. Within Brahmanical thought, that is to say, its scholastic orthodox traditions, there are, however, other ‘pictures of the world,’ namely cosmological descriptions such as those of the Śaivite-Śāktic and Vaiṣṇava-bhakti movements of the second millennium AD. Śaivism, in particular, accommodates various tendencies \(monistic and dualistic\) but manages to offer a unified immanent-cum-transcendent theology with tremendous success across the whole spectrum of Hindu darśanas, not least the Vaiśeṣika system. 

Other philosophical schools may not fit into the category of the ‘orthodox picture’ \(āstika darśana\) of the world. As in the course of classical Greek philosophy, in classical Indian thought, revisionist Śramaṇic movements continue to grow in the post-Upaniṣadic era. Greek heterodox movements that threaten the religious or political establishment \(see Socrates Trials, Plato’s political fiasco in Syracuse, Aristotle’s flight from Athens\) have parallels in the Indian śastric movements, whose founding authors initiate new interpretations of the world \(in sūtra texts\) and supply solutions for liberation that conflict with the old Vedic descriptions \(saṃsāra, loka\). These movements would generate, in turn, lasting scholastic traditions. The Classical world abounds in ‘heterodox’ creativity. In the Greek world, such new philosophies are categorised in various currents: the Pythagorean thought, Sophistic

[^31]:  Sometimes confused with śastra \(‘science’\), darśana stands for a ‘worldview’ or ‘philosophical school,’ while śastra stands for a ‘discipline’ that encompasses authors from different traditions. 

[^32]: The tradition has several variations: Bhāskara \(Aupādhika Bhedābheda\) \(8th and 9th century AD\), Yādava and Nimbārka \(Svābhāvika Bhedābheda\) \(13th century AD\), and Caitanya \(Acintya Bhedābheda\) \(1486–1534\). 

[^10]: {{33}} Cynic and Cyrenaic thought, Stoicism, Epicurism, Pyrrhonism, and the Peripatetic school, while in the Subcontinent, Cārvāka Scepticism,34 Ājīvika 

Fatalism,35 Yogācāra-Mentalism, and Mādhyamika dialecticism are comparable examples. What all these may share in common is a natural craving for advancing new forms of descriptive metaphysics, substantiated in original and singular philosophical views \(darśanas\). The study of their tenets poses doxographical problems due to their marginalisation in relation to more established schools of thought privi-leged by the political, religious, and socio-cultural establishment. The ‘picture of the world’ of such movements varies; it inclines either towards idealistic and mentalistic elucidations or towards nihilistic and moralistic interpretations. Although these schools use analogous terminology, their semantics and hermeneutics differ considerably. Despite that, one prevalent aspect developed in their thought is to engage robustly with the elusive question of ‘being,’ either by refuting, marginalising, or simply redefining it entirely. They were all in one way or another critical of the then extant picture of metaphysics, hence they engaged themselves with ontology, which offered not only definitions but also existential solutions. The term 

‘soteriontology’ that more recently Halbfass discussed concerning Advaita Vedānta and some Mahāyāna Buddhist schools is one such example. 

It has been customary to limit the number of classical Indian philosophical systems to 6. This is the position that an important Jain commentator Haribhadrasūri \(c. 5th–8th centuries AD\) took in his ‘Compendium of Six Philosophies’ 

\(Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya\)36 and is a view taken for granted in the 19th century by Max Müller in a book with a similar title.37 The 6 systems discussed are the first teaching of Buddha, Nyāya, Sāṃkhya, Jaina, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā, and a separate one called Cārvāka \(Lokāyata\). That Lokāyata \(a materialistic system that denies the reality of substance-essence\) has not been listed among the 6 systems shows the bias of such doxographers but also indicates the necessary qualification that a darśana must meet, namely a knowledge that goes from an upper to a deeper physical description of the concrete materiality of the world. Haribhadrasūri’s canon, however, faces a challenge from a Lokāyata polemical work composed by a sceptical thinker known as Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa \(8th century AD\). His work, as the title ‘Lion of Destruction of Philosophical Theories’ \(Tattvopaplavasiṃha\) suggests, is one that deploys a major refutation of the validity of some of the doctrines

What is then the place of Vaiśeṣika in Indian philosophy? For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we shall say that its distinctness becomes evident only when contrasted with the whole panorama of the main classical systems. Sāṃkhya stands for a dualistic cosmology. Mīmāṃsā \(Jaiminīya\) is a form of hermeneutics based largely on the relationship between sound-language and act-ritual in view of a precise classification and performance of the Vedic ritual and mantras. Cārvāka is a nihilistic and materialistic system that denies the reality of the essence of world constituents \(e.g. Tattvopaplavasiṃha\). Buddhism is a dialectical philosophy of mind, which developed several variations: either mentalist \(Yogācāra\) or dialectic \(Mādhyamika\) and so forth. Nyāya is a system of logic with an enlarged theory of perception. There are Pāṇini’s grammar and the philosophy of language that generated subsequent important philosophical commentaries \(Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya and Bhartṛhari’s Vākyapadīya\). Jaina is a dualistic-cum-pluralistic philosophy in its ontological, epistemological, and soteriological descriptions. Vedānta is largely a transcendental philosophy with a dualistic epistemology that differentiates between a ‘lower’ \(vyavahārika\) and an ‘absolute’ \(pāramārthika\) reality. As far as the absolute reality is concerned, the Vedāntic sub-schools range from absolute monism \(Śaṅkara’s Advaita\) to qualified monism \(Rāmānuja\), and even dualism \(Madhva, Pūrṇa-prajña system\). Between these, there lie divergences of opinion in relation to the origin and nature of the world, which is either the product of a form of transformation \(Bhedābheda\) or just the manifestation of Brahma \(Bhāmatī and Vivaraṇa 

Advaita\).40 Śaivism – with its enormous rise and varied traditions \(Nakulīśa-Pāśupata, Śaiva System, Pratyabhijñā, Raseśvara System\)41 – represents, broadly speaking, an attempt to accomplishing an harmonious synthesis between transcendent and immanent explanations of reality, a fact that brought many of the classical darśanas under its spell and devotional allegiance. With several exceptions, the vast majority of these classical and early medieval systems deal with the soteriological

questions that have finality in an ontological irreversible state; in fact, the ontology somehow moves from a differentiated condition of becoming to a static state of being. In short, Indian philosophies begin, change, and challenge the scope of ontology. While the history of Western thought had shifted from the essentialist and naturalist ontology of the Pre-Socratics to the phenomenology and existentialism of the 20th century, in Indian philosophy, however, there has been a different type of development, a tendency towards a continual sharpening of the Upaniṣadic view on the nature of the world and the ultimate reality. Quite often, as the Śaivist tradition typifies, its description is the synthesis and interplay between an immanent and transcendent nature of being and ontology. 

**1.1 Vaiśeṣika**

What is the originality of Vaiśeṣika within the broader picture of classical Indian thought? What are its main ontological categories and what purpose do these serve to? In a preface to one important voluminous work on the system, Anantalal Thakur places Vaiśeṣika alongside Pāṇini’s grammar, as one of the fundamental aids for the study of all Indian systems of knowledge. 42 The significance of this statement stems from the fact that any knowledge system lies on both a precise 

‘language’ and the ontological reality of ‘object.’ In other words, without an interdependence between a science of language \(pada\) and a science of word-object \(padārtha\), there is no possibility for the knowledge of any real objects. Indeed, as Praśastapāda points out in his Bhāṣya, the objective ‘existentiality’ \(astitva\) and 

‘nameability’ \(abhidheyatva\)43 of the world’s constituents \(categories\) go hand in hand with their own ‘knowability’ \(jñeyatva\), all 3 representing core domains of knowledge: ontology, epistemology, and language. Can any word exist without a reference to object? Is there any hierarchy among the 3 major philosophical domains: ontology, language, and knowledge? If Aristotle knew Vaiśeṣika, his view would probably be that this Indian ontological system is of a more fundamental value, and, in a way, a most necessary one. As he put it in his Categories \(7b15\), the ‘knowable’ must be prior to the ‘knowledge’ itself, and as a rule, it is unlikely that a ‘knowable thing’ and the ‘process of knowledge’ are simultaneous, for otherwise, when ‘knowledge’ disappears that would lead to the destruction of the ‘knowable thing’ itself as well; but this is not so. 44 The point Aristotle makes

is that the knowable thing endures even after knowledge is no longer there, and that an object is prior to language, whence the priority and paramount importance of the ‘knowable thing’ that Aristotle defines in 10 forms of predication.45 The 

difference between the 6 categories of Vaiśeṣika46 and Aristotle’s 10 categories is that the former do not represent ‘forms of predication’ whose existence depends on language and predication, but rather exist independently from language, being real objects, having as they should, well-established ontological states interconnected and immanently derived from each other.47 Besides states, the substances in Vaiśeṣika can undergo conditions; such as, for instance, soul \(ātman\), whose nature can have ‘essential characteristics’48 in its ontological state, and ‘accidental characteristics’49 in its embodied condition. The particularity of Vaiśeṣika is a recurrent analysis of entities \(substances\) that have a fixed order and value, a focus on the knowledge of their intrinsic nature, and a description of the trans-mutation of their conditions that harness impurity and corruption to their nature. 

It is a system focused on entities \(nouns\) rather than actions \(verbs\). The construction of Pāṇini’s grammar seems to follow the same pattern of thought; both Vaiśeṣika and Pāṇini depart from the early etymologist and linguist Yāska, whose work Nirukta defines ‘verb’ \(ākhyāta\) as ‘consisting mainly of becoming’ 

\(bhāvapradhānam ākhyātām\) \(Durga com. Nirukta 1.1.9\). By that, Yāska places a heavy stress on the importance of action and verb, which he sees as a ‘continuous series of momentary becoming of bhava,’ whereas noun represents the ‘stagnation or solidification of the verb.’50 The universe of Vaiśeṣika stands in sharp contrast to Yāska’s view and his early re-interpretations. Vaiśeṣika is a substantialist philosophy at heart, a fact demonstrated by its Sūtrapāṭha, which lists 3 basic categories: substances \(dravya\), qualities \(guṇa\), and motions \(karma\), of which the first category represents the rock-bottom foundation on which other categories 

[^45]: The 10 categories are in fact ‘modes of predication’ that point to the reality of things beyond language. It is an attempt to provide a theory of individuation about the existence of a substance. The categories are enunciated by Aristotle in Cat 4.1.b.25: \(1\) substance; \(2\) quantity; \(3\) qualification; \(4\) relation; \(5\) location; \(6\) time; \(7\) position; \(8\) possession; \(9\) acting; and \(10\) being-affected \(Τῶν κατὰ μηδεμίαν συμπλοκὴν λεγομένων ἕκαστον ἤτοι \(1\) **οὐσίαν** σημαίνει ἢ \(2\) **ποσὸν** ἢ \(3\) **ποιὸν** ἢ \(4\) **πρός τι** ἢ \(5\) **ποὺ** ἢ \(6\) **ποτὲ** ἢ \(7\) **κεῖσθαι** ἢ \(8\) **ἔχειν** ἢ \(9\) **ποιεῖν** ἢ \(10\) **πάσχειν**\). 

[^46]: The standard numbers of Vaiśeṣika categories are: \(1\) substance \(9 in total\); \(2\) quality \(17 initially\); \(3\) motion \(5\); \(4\) universal \(2\); \(5\) particular \(2\); and \(6\) inherence \(between substance and quality\). Later Vaiśeṣika work Śivāditya’s Saptapadārthī adds ‘abhāva’ as the seventh padārtha \(SP 3\). 

[^47]:  One such example is the derivation of the category of ‘distinctness’ \(viśeṣa\) from the older category of quality of ‘separateness’ \(pṛthaktva\). 

[^48]: The essential characteristics of the soul – known as generic qualities sāmānyaguṇa – are number, dimension, separateness, conjunction, and disjunction \(VSc 3.2.17\). 

[^49]: The specific qualities of the soul are cognition, pleasure, pain, volition, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, and latent impetus \(VSc 3.2.17\). They constitute the psychological apparatus, a sort of subtle body – equivalent to what Praśastapāda calls ‘ativāhikaśarīra’ \(PD 359\) – that undergoes transmigration. 

[^50]:  Singh 1987: 191. 

\(quality, action, universality, particularity, and inherence\) reside. Among these, the substance-category is the most important of all. 

Substance is one of the most controversial topics in philosophy and demands much elucidation not only in the Western thought but also in Indian philosophy as well. Problems of translation abound for at least 2 reasons. First, because our modern vocabulary is of the second order: terms like ‘essence’ \(via Cicero\) and 

‘existence’ \(via Marius Victorinus\) are Latin adaptations and interpretations from Greek ‘ousia’ \(οὐσία\) and hyparxis \(ὑπάρξεις\), respectively.51 A second reason is the very problem of clarifying what substance means in both Greek and Scholastic philosophical contexts, the semantic shifts it has undergone throughout history, beginning with Aristotle’s first interpretations of Plato’s theory of forms, then under Islamic Neo-Platonist translations and re-interpretations, as well as during the debate on real distinction \(essence versus existence\) within the Thomist scholasticism. 52 It is, therefore, imperative that a new methodology of analysing the theory of substance should be sought with input from a comparative philosophical reflection that engages Indian \(Sanskrit\) ideas and literature. Philosophy is global, contextual, and cross-cultural. With Dilthey and Halbfass, the method of comparative philosophy argues that Indian philosophy can indeed live in the medium of Western thought and that, as a result, can challenge and change our old assumptions on the elusive topic of being, essence, and substance. 53

As mentioned, one of the chief characteristics of Vaiśeṣika philosophy is the reference and preference for individuality and individuation for the description of substance. It is an aspect by which the system contributes to some unanswered questions in Western philosophy. Thus, if we look again over Aristotle’s Categories, particularly the first chapters, we find several important directions, which may act as starting points to understand Vaiśeṣika in a comparative programme. 

1\) Aristotle distinguishes a 2-fold nature of substance: on the one hand, a ‘primary substance’ that is its individual nature \(e.g. one individual man\), and on the other hand, a ‘secondary substance,’ which is its specific genera \(e.g. man\) \(Cat 2a11\). He goes as far as to say that the individuality of a substance \(the primary substance\) is ‘more of a substance than genera’ \(Cat 2 b7\), a view that agrees with Vaiśeṣika’s view, according to which, an ultimate particularity defines the essence or nature of a ‘substance’ \(dravya\). A comparable classification is how Vaiśeṣika system differentiates between ‘permanent’ \(nitya\) and ‘impermanent’ \(anitya\) substances; given the character of substances as being wholes and compositional, as well as simple and universal, the usual translation of nitya by ‘eternal’ is unsatisfactory. The classification of the system in relation

{{15}}

to its 9 substances,54 is not according to their intrinsic state, but rather to their condition. What ‘nitya’ presumably means is the state of being 

‘indivisible,’ ‘indestructible,’ and a ‘simple whole’ \(unitary oneness\). 

The classification is problematic because all 9 substances are placed in the category of ‘permanent’ substances, when these are in a unitary state \(time, space, vacuum, and to a certain extent, soul\) or an atomic state \(mind, earth, water, lustre, wind\). In the second category of impermanent substances, Vaiśeṣika places some of the substances in ‘impermanent’ 

\(anitya\) \(earth, water, lustre, wind\), which can alternatively refer to the condition of being ‘divisible’ and ‘destructible.’ It is a category marked by the laws of motion, which is karma theory. The problem of this classification increases as regards the condition of the soul in this diagram. Is soul, that is to say \(ātman\), permanent or impermanent? Candrānanda’s commentary – which this edition puts forward – does not always specify when soul \(ātman\) refers to an embodied soul or when it refers to a pure eternal and essential dis-embodied soul. Its intrinsic nature is devoid of motion and activity \(VSc 5.2.23\), therefore, the question reoccurs as to how it is 

possible to acquire embodiment and transmigration.55

2\) A second important complementarity between Aristotle’s Categories and Vaiśeṣikasūtra’s is the valorisation of the individual ahead of the universal. Although Aristotle did not put differentiae \(διαφοραί\) into the list of his categories \(as Vaiśeṣika, and later on Dvaita Vedānta does\), he consistently maintains that a substance is primarily an individual, and not a genera \(Cat 2b20\), although he seems to contradict himself later in Cat 15a4–7, where he states that genera are always before species.56 Aristotle aims to safeguard the reality of individual nouns and subjects, for all knowledge and predication seems to point to these. As he puts it, ‘the primary substances stand to everything else…and all the rest are predicated of these’ \(Cat 2b29\). 57 Aristotle provides an epistemic or scientific method that runs from the individual to the universal and not vice-versa. Genera do not have value if they are not grounded on individuality first, which explains why he is in favour of the reality of the nouns and subjects ahead of the reality of verbs, actions, and processes. The stress Vaiśeṣika places here reminds of one of Śākaṭāyana and

[^55]: Transmigration of humans happens according to Candrānanda in relation to everything that has 

‘body’ \(śarīra\) \(VSc 4.2\), in which sense the term of ‘transmigration’ \(saṃsāra\) is used \(VSc 5.2.19\).

Yāska’s linguistic speculations, which shifted the lexicographic and semantic Vedic focus from nouns to verbs. The affinity of Vaiśeṣika with Aristotle lies primarily in the area of ontology and the theory of perception.58 Aristotle believes that if the primary substances did not exist initially, it would be then impossible for any of the other things to exist \(Cat 2a34; 2b7\). Aristotle like Vaiśeṣika, begins the inquiry of substances as the fundamental ingredients of the world; he employs a realistic method akin to that of a botanist,59 who collects the ingredients of the world, names and defines them so as to present a differentiated picture of reality \(made of substance\) in its both intrinsic and extrinsic totality. 

3\) The view of generality is one other important aspect in which Vaiśeṣika completes the missing dots within the dualistic cosmological framework of both Plato’s theory of forms and Aristotelian predication between ‘primary substances’ \(what ‘is’ in something\) versus secondary substance \(what is said ‘of’ something\). When Aristotle talks about combination and combined things \(Cat 1a16\), he points not to the universal interweaving of all things of the world – but, relatively faithful to the dualistic Platonic tradition – speaks about the combination between noun and verb, object and predication. 60 

Philoponus – one Aristotelian commentator of Late Antiquity – endorses this dualistic definition of being as either substance or accident with no inter-mediaries between them. 61 Indeed, as Ackrill justly noted more recently, in Cat 1b10, Aristotle does not seem to make a tripartite distinction between 

‘individual,’ ‘species,’ and ‘genus.’ When Aristotle, for instance, uses the conjunction ‘or’ \(ἤτοι\) in Cat 2b29, 62 while referring to the species or genera, he does not necessarily talk about 2 universals, lower \(species\) and higher \(genera\), respectively, but rather about one and the same. 

Quite to the contrary, however, Vaiśeṣika differentiates between an ‘ultimate individuality’ \(antyaviśeṣa\) inherently bound in the ‘universal’ \(sāmānya\) and the medium of a real ontological linking knot called ‘lower or specific universality’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\), which may stand for the category of ‘species.’ 

[^58]: The theory of perception in Vaiśeṣika is the combination of a ‘contact’ \(sannikarṣa\) of 4 main ontic entities: self, mind, senses, and objects. The combination is thus between not only noun and verb but implies other entities and qualities such as buddhi, a quality that is common to both mind and soul.

Reality – and the problem of ‘being’ – stands in Vaiśeṣika on 3 sub-levels of reality, which constitute a graded system of supervenience. 63 Substance can have 3 ontological conditions: general universal \(sāmānya\), specific universal \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\), and ultimate particularity \(antyaviśeṣa\), all of which possess an ontological reality. Halbfass claims that Vaiśeṣika exemplifies a horizontal form of descriptive metaphysics – perhaps an observation adduced in comparison with what Analytic philosophy calls to be a system of ‘supervenience.’ In fact, what we notice is a vertical system of conditions that substance stands on, and where the connection between the 3 levels of supervenience follows the laws of ‘entailment.’ Vaiśeṣika enacts this entailment better in its ‘ontological’ epistemology, namely, the theory of perception where the inferential induction is that by which an observer \(a yogi\) can grasp the particularity in universality, both simultaneously, and successively. 64 ‘Time’ and 

‘space,’ ‘soul,’ and ‘vacuum’ – all of which are highly abstract substances – 

are entities that can be intuited in both their successive conditions of particularity and plurality \(unit\), as well as in their universal, all-pervasive, infinitely extensive, infinite plurality \(oneness\). The substance soul, for example, has a differentiated and numerical-pluralised nature in both a ‘pre-existential’ state \(before birth embodiment\) and an ‘existential’ condition \(after the body’s disintegration\), and that is indicated by the difference that exists between the 2 sets of qualities it possesses: generic qualities \(pre-existential\) and specific qualities \(existential\), the latter being evanescent. When the soul is embodied, it acquires specific qualities, a kind of subtle body \(which is the vehicle of karmic bondage and transmigration\) – one condition that grants soul a concrete ‘plurality’. When, however, soul possesses only generic qualities in its pre-existent state, then soul is essentially ‘differentiated.’ The shift of ātman from its essential state and to ātman of its existential condition, does not change the nature of its plurality, but rather impregnates it with a specific concrete form. Plurality and identity of a substance that perdures through change and time do not disappear, but rather re-asserts. Individuation means to identify the addition of a new singularity added to the essential characteristic of substance. The generic qualities of ‘number’ \(saṃkhyā\) and ‘separateness’ \(pṛthaktva\) that characterise soul in its pre-existential ontological state should not be confused with the condition of the plurality of the souls that are both diverse and plural as Sūtrapāṭha 3.2.16 states. 65 The difference between 

[^63]:  If we add sattā, which is the highest form of generality, then Vaiśeṣika could point out a 4-level reality, sattā being the beyond-differentiation level of a substance, or perhaps the totality of the reality; it defines any real ontic being.

\[individual\] is connected with pleasure, and so on, another \[individual\] is not connected \[with pleasure\], indicates that souls are diverse and plural\). 

the 2 states and conditions is like that between ontology and existentiality, whence philosophical-religious existentialism \(mokṣa\) as well as metaphysics \(ontology\) derive, diverge, and depend. The concept of ‘soteriontology’ 

coined by Halbfass is indicative in this respect.66

4\) The category of viśeṣa and/or antyaviśeṣa represents one of the major Vaiśeṣika contributions to the problem of individuation in both Indian and Western metaphysics. 67 The system derives its name from the term ‘difference’ \(viśeṣa\), which is indeed the most peculiar aspect and where its originality lies. It seems that Western philosophy has not yet answer satisfactorily the problem of either differentiae,68 or individuals, even though the history of scholastic philosophy from John Philoponus to Duns Scotus and Gilles Deleuze had continued to offer emendations and clarifications to Aristotle’s fuzzy views on the differentiated nature of the substance. 69 His theory of individuation \(predication\) has several shortcomings, precisely because it begins from linguistic premises, rather than ontological ones. Of course, all these 10 forms of predication \(categories\) aim to define the reality of ‘things,’ the knowable objects that exist prior to the reality of knowledge and language itself. However, Aristotle’s predicative theory of individuation does not go as far as to differentiate the particularity in a species itself, because for him 

‘species’ and ‘genus’ of a substance seem to be the same. If he did so, he should have been able to differentiate it, or at least mention it in relation to the puzzling question regarding the status of individual instances of colour in a universal colour \(e.g. redness\).70 However, he did not. In so doing, he could have averted the problem of universals, deemed by Nominalists as a 

[^66]:  Halbfass 1992: 234. 

[^67]:  Halbfass has pointed out that antyaviśeṣa is neither a number nor a ‘principium individuationis’; but what is it? A ‘reference’ that identifies the nature of a substance as ultimately distinct? Or is it a real entity that exists in the nature of the substance itself? Such questions and possible new answers may come from Dvaita Vedānta philosophy where viśeṣa has been defined not as an independent entity \(for that would have compromised the dualism of this school\), and neither as a relation nor even as a new quality, Sharma 1962: 50. 

[^68]:  Regis \(1976: 157\), for instance, argues that there is no principle of individuation in Aristotle, who talked about the matte in a very elliptical or implicit manner; for Regis, an entity is an individual par excellence and it is not necessary to put forward a principle of individuation, nor to see one given by Aristotle. 

[^69]:  Ackrill \(2002: 77\) suggests that Aristotle’s last sentence of Cat 1b15 \(animal should be predicated of the individual man also for the individual man is both a man and an animal\) should be emended because The Philosopher refers only to ‘differentiae divisivae’ \(and not to differentiae constitutivae as well\). Yet, I believe that Aristotle has a slip of the tongue intuition, for he distinguishes between 3 ontological levels, but he did not elaborate further, for he did not wish to contradict the dualistic theory of predication. 

[^70]:  See Notes in Ackrill 2002\). Duns Scotus made one step to clarification when he argues on the perceptivity of accidentals: we do not comprehend the individuating difference ‘per se,’ but rather the accidental features that define the essences of objects, which we perceive, see Duns Scotus Lectura 142–3, Early Oxford Lecture on Individuation ed. Wolter, Allan B., 2005.

fallacy. However, Aristotle wishes only to clarify and avert the confusion between synonyms, homonyms, and paronyms, but more importantly, aims 

to safeguard the reality of forms and nouns and their ultimate meaning that lies in the individual instances of linguistic expression. 71 The urgency of this task was to surmount the slippery confusions that the Sophists brought into Greek philosophical thought, and he eventually aimed to counter their highly popular, and to a certain extent, dangerous, influence that went too far. 72

Vaiśeṣika solves the problem of individuation in several ways: \(1\) by propounding the existence of an ‘ultimate particularity’ \(antyaviśeṣa\); \(2\) it grants the ‘lower universal’ an ontological reality comparable to that of species; and \(3\) ascribes a quality of dharma \(dharmaviśeṣa\) to any particular object. The latter cognitive faculty \(dharmaviśeṣa\) encroaches a sort of informative data upon our senses, and upon the soul, which is the ultimate receptacle of knowledge \(not the mind\). This type of impingement leads to a form of inferential induction, a form of intuition about the essence and the reality of the very ultimate thing-object, which is not evanescent \(like in Yogācāra\), but real and inter-woven, 73 forming as it were, 

first a species and second a genera. Yoga is an intellectual practice – though not directly a soteriological one – for it comprises a yogic perception \(yogipratyakṣa\) that grasps the reality of dharmaviśeṣa, and through it, an ‘ultimate particularity’ \(antyaviśeṣa\). What constitutes liberation \(mokṣa, niḥśreyasa\) in Vaiśeṣika is not the achievement of these cognitive stages of ultimate substances and their essences, but rather their transcending and renunciation. Knowledge and cognition are only fleeing accidental qualities ultimately discarded. Pleasure, bliss, and knowledge are no longer part of the ontological liberated state; the only beauty that remains is the beauty of the infinite difference and the plurality of the 9 fundamental substances. 74

[^71]:  Synonyms may correspond to particularities, homonyms may correspond to genus, whereas paronyms may correspond to species; the problems unsolved by Aristotle’s theory of predication are mostly related to the dubious nature of paronyms. 

[^72]: The first Sophistic movement cost Socrates’ his own life, for among the accusations, there was the allegation of being a Sophist \(Plato’s Apology 18a–20c\). 

[^73]:  About the real yet non-existential character of ‘ultimate particularity,’ see Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra VSv \(long version\) 1985: 70, who speaks of an inter-dependent reality of the antyaviśeṣa, which do not have their own nature, but they stand on the nature of the substratum which is the universal; their reality is inferred and connected with the general nature of generality. The theoretical reality of antyaviśeṣa derives from several concepts: ‘inclusion’ \(aṅgikāra\), ‘concomitance’ \(vyāptihānyā\), and with another ‘real thing’ through a relation of ‘dependency’ \(prāsaṅga\), all these concepts demonstrate the grip, which by the 13th century AD, logic had on Vaiśeṣika, until its total assimilation by Nyāya. This is what in modern philosophy of physics is considered ‘structural realism’ where bottom-rock reality is relational. See Brigitte Falkenburg, Particle Metaphysics. A Critical Account of Subatomic Reality, 2007. 

[^74]: What is substance for Vaiśeṣika? It is a question to which arguably the system’s answer is that, as its nature or ultimate essence indicates, substance is differential and relational. This, however, should not be seen in an essentialism characterised by simplicity, but quite the opposite, a complexity that is indeterminately expanded horizontally, without mingling and confusion. 

**The Commentary: Candrānanda’s Vṛtti**

There is a large consensus among scholars that Candrānanda’s Vṛtti \(VSc for gloss; VS for Sūtrapāṭha\) is the oldest extant Vaiśeṣika commentary, and, as Isaacson states, the Sūtrapāṭha \(VS\) it contains is ‘quite probably the earliest one now available.’75 Though an older Sūtrapāṭha could still be reconstructed from an 

‘independent transmission of Vaiśeṣikasūtras,’76 this edition argues that before new major MSS are uncovered, and before any critical edition on VS becomes available, it is necessary to put forward an English translation with Roman transliteration. As far as Vaiśeṣika philosophy and its literature is concerned, and judging the previous editions and several manuscripts we have on this system, these aphorisms Vaiśeṣikasūtra – which Candrānanda commentary preserves – give us with a better and older version of its core tenets. We do not have sufficient reasons to doubt the reasonable reliability of sūtras as preserved by Candrānanda’s commentary. When I traced Wezler’s ‘independent transmission of Sūtrapāṭha,’ 

and after looking at more than half of the MSS catalogues, but more specifically at 5 new MSS that I have personally seen and photographed at Wai, Mysore, Bombay, and Madras, I likewise came to concur with Thakur, that the MSS we have on Sūtrapāṭha largely give us the Mithilā version \(Śaṅkaramiśra‘s Upaskāra\). 

After Vaiśeṣika’s amalgamation with Nyāya \(11th century AD\), it seems that, with the exception of Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra’s Vyākhyā \(‘short’ and ‘long versions’\) and Śaṅkaramiśra’s Upaskāra, the Vaiśeṣika system has been transmitted in MSS 

collected in the Nyāya and Jaina sections of manuscript catalogues. For instance, this is the case of MSS from Baroda and Ujjain, both of which are combined manuscripts \(Sammelhandschrift\). 

This second introductory section is addressed principally to scholars of Indology familiar with Sanskrit textual criticism and philology, and aims to offer an overview on the state of the Baroda 1961 edition, but more importantly, to pave the way and facilitate future scholars with a much expected critical edition on Vaiśeṣikasūtra by collating all MSS that I have located and identified in Appendix 

3. During my epic tour and fieldwork to South India \(2015-2016\), I had the fortune to access several manuscript collections, with the aim to complement the work of my predecessors: Kaviraj, Thakur, and Isaacson’s philological criticism on both VSc and Sūtrapāṭha. To those students not yet familiarised with Sanskrit, this section also offers a thematic synopsis of the commentary itself. A comparable synopsis had already been given by Thakur \(2003\) but is rather an eclectic summary, for it presents the topics of Sūtrapāṭha and the system itself based on glosses extracted from other Vaiśeṣika commentaries, and sadly overlooks key portions of Candrānanda’s commentaries on topics that are important, such as mokṣa \(e.g. VSc 10.21\). The synopsis I offer here focuses on Candrānanda’s

interpretation exclusively. As for Sūtrapāṭha, which will be briefly discussed in the second part of this chapter, I have brought into the discussion parallel passages that confirm that Candrānanda’s version of Vaiśeṣika aphorisms is as old as the 2nd century AD. 

Candrānanda’s’ commentary – whose *editio princeps* has been published at Baroda in 1961 by the eminent Jaina savant monk Muni Jambūvijayaji – is the oldest Vaiśeṣika commentary available at present,77 and its publication represents a landmark in Vaiśeṣika studies. Its importance has already been highlighted numerous times by both Indian scholars \(e.g. Thakur, Jambūvijayaji\) and Western ones \(e.g. Wezler, Isaacson, and Halbfass\).78 Though republished in 1982, the edition of 1961 should be used first as it does not contain the misprints of the second edition \(1982\). 79 The 1961 edition provides a more reliable basic mūla-text, so much so that since its publication, it replaced scholars’ reliance on a later and vastly popular Vaiśeṣika commentary: Śaṅkaramiśra’s Upaskāra \(VSs\). The latter is an inflated version of the Sūtrapāṭha as well as a late \(Navya-Nyāya\) interpretation on Sūtrapāṭha. 80 Yet, the reception of Candrānanda’s commentary among Vaiśeṣika students is still poor, partly because a fully annotated translation has not yet been available in English. 81 To my own surprise, there are still scholars in today’s India who either are not familiar with the Candrānanda commentary or are simply not aware of the early composition of it, a fact partly due to the assumption that the ‘earliest text’ is not of much relevance to a living tradition such as Brahmanism. This only proves how familiar and close to heart the old philosophical reflection is to modern Indian scholarship. 

[^77]: The edition of Baroda Oriental Institute, 1961 \(Gaekwad’s Oriental Series no 136\) is the printed edition I only use. 

[^78]:  I refer primarily to Isaacson’s ground-breaking textual critical work, his PhD thesis, ‘Materials for the study of Vaiśeṣika system,’ 1995, while Ferenc Ruzsa has provided a transliteration for the whole Vṛtti with multiple notes providing MSS variations \(his webpage is on [academia .e du](http://dx.doi.org/academia.edu)\). 

[^79]:  I have had this edition in my own hand, at Wai, but here I rely on Isaacson’s expertise, 1995, p. 355. 

[^80]:  I am grateful to Alexis Sanderson who – during my DPhil transfer examination – drew attention to this important matter; at the time, October 2013, I had little training in textual criticism and Sanskrit philosophy. This aspect is indeed important, for even today there are still scholars who keep on referring to Upaskāra as the main primary sources for Vaiśeṣika \(e.g. Gajendragadkar, 1988\). 

We thus recommend that – for a genuine study of the system – Candrānanda and Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra commentaries on Vaiśeṣikasūtra must be consulted and referred first. 

[^81]:  One interesting exception is the Italian translation of Arena, 1982 \(VSa\); but he only translates the sūtras; while for Candrānanda’s commentary, he provides his own summary and commentary. 

**1.2 MSS on VSc82**

When Jambūvijayaji published the edition of 1961, he used only 2 MSS. 83 He probably did not know that each of those 2 MSS had a further copy – preserved in Pune \(the MSS library of Bhandarkar Institute\) and another MS that has a copy preserved at Ujjain. Thus, there are 5 extant MSS on VSc, classified into 2 groups: those of a Jaina Devanagari Script and those of Śāradā script. Here, I only wish to list the MSS that have been used and already described by Jambūvijayaji \(J , Ś

have been laudably collated and compared by Isaacson and Ruzsa.84 Table 1.1 

gives a detailed and up to date description of all MSS on Candrānanda’s commentary. For a full description, readers are encouraged to consult not only Thakur’s introduction to Baroda edition 1961 but various descriptions extant in MSS catalogues \(see Illustration 3 in the Appendix\), as well as the technical doctorate research of Harunaga Isaacson \(1995, pp. 145–7\). Though still improvable, the edition of Baroda 1961 is reliable and, as Isaacson puts it, ‘a most impressive 

achievement, an example of scholarship of a rare order.’85

The point of this introduction is to trigger students’ interest in putting together a critical edition of Vaiśeṣikasūtra. It is only then can we state with certainty about the system’s own tenets on various doctrines and concepts and the place of these into the broader picture of world philosophy. One example of a widely misunder-stood doctrine – due mostly to the poor preservation of Sūtrapāṭha – is the nature of soteriology, which, for example, Frauwallner negated because the system is a pure 

[^82]: The Jain savant Muni Jambūvijayaji took an interest in Vaiśeṣika while he was working on Nayacakra of Mallavādin. He saw in the text he was revising that there were many Vaiśeṣika sūtras, which could not be found in the then extant Sūtrapāṭha of Śaṅkaramiśra \(15th century AD\). 

Intrigued by the sūtras present in the Nayacakra, Jambūvijayaji decided to trace their origin. From Jaisalmer, he received an MS from the collection of Muni Puṇyavijayajī, which proved of great value due to the many different sūtras it contained. Jambūvijayaji thus became the scholar responsible for the editio princeps of the oldest Vaiśeṣika commentary, and his edition was improved by Isaacson and Ruzsa collated and compared 3 additional MSS of various scripts, as follows: MS no 1831h \(Śārāda script\) from Baroda Oriental Institute, which in the footnotes of 1961 Baroda edition is designated with the siglum ‘O.’ A similar MS at Baroda Oriental Institute bears the number 403 and is from about 1875–6. It is also in Śārāda script and has 33 folia \(size 26.5 \+ 17 cm\). A final MS of the Scindia Oriental Institute, Ujjain, no. 4635, contains first the Tarkasaṁgraha text and the commentary \(Tarkadīpikā\), followed by the Sūtrapāṭha beginning on folio 22r15 and ending on folio 35r.106. 

[^83]: Thakur Introduction to VSc 1961. 

[^84]:  Puṇyavijayajī edited VSc in 1982, but as Isaacson warned, the text ‘has been reset’ due to ‘a sprinkling of new misprints added,’ p. 144, f14. Isaacson \(PhD\) provides only a portion of a proposed Devanāgarī critical edition \(without translation\) of VSc \(1.1 to 2.1 including\). His represents a good beginning of what the whole of the edition might look like, while the Hungarian Indologist Ferenc Ruzsa carried on the same task for the whole of VSc \(in roman transliteration\). Since my work is not textual critical or philological, nor am I fully equipped to compete with their technical competence, I shall henceforth refer to their philological reading of the MSS.

philosophy of nature incompatible with any religious and theological concerns. 86 

Liberation in Vaiśeṣika is gnostic, centred primarily on an essentialist ontological knowledge of all 6 categories \(padārtha\), including the substance soul \(ātman\). 

This knowledge is achieved through the medium of a certain ‘qualitative power’ 

\(dharmaviśeṣa\), which flashes out from each entity under scrutiny during the process of perception. A certain form of yogic intuition plays a role here. Thakur’s view is that ‘dharma’ from the opening sūtras \(VS 1.1.1–2\) refers to a quality that characterises all the world constituents and categories \(padārthadharma\).87 That 

is to say, ‘dharma’ is the means of knowledge that stands between the external objective world \(sattā\) and the mental and cognitive domain \(of mind and soul\). 

The mental inner domain and the objective external domain are bridged by the qualitative power of dharma \(with all its ramifications\) that stands for a third domain of reality. One may recognise in these 3 domains \(external-objective; inner-mental; and dharma\) the 3 important domains of Praśastapāda, which says that all world categories possess ‘existentiality,’ ‘nameability,’ and ‘knowability.’ 

What glues the 3 domains is dharma, which is the domain of knowability \(jñeyatva\) that is attached to any of the world’s constituents. It is the reason for which dharma is expressed with either capitals \(the sum of all knowledge VSc 1.1.1–2\) as well as a mere fleeting quality \(VSc 1.1.5\).88 It is also important to note that, 

although knowledge plays an important part, the system is not in the least ‘gnostic,’ \(in the Hellenistic sense\) for although ‘knowledge’ \(buddhi/jñāna\) represents a means by which liberation is achieved, nevertheless, at a certain point, because it is only a fleeing specific quality \(vaiśeṣikaguṇa\), it would be fully castoff from the nature of the soul. Both knowledge and dharma are not ontologically part of the soteriological state, but only the means by which an embodied self would achieve its free and pure nature. Nature is the state of potential infinite plurality of 

[^86]:  See discussion on this interpretation in Ionut Moise, Salvation in Indian Philosophy. Perfection and Simplicity for Vaiśeṣika, 2019. 

[^87]: Thakur, Introduction to VSc 1961, p. 3. 

[^88]:  In Candrānanda’s commentary, dharma is employed in a whole variety of ways ranging from ritualistic connotations \(VSc 6.2.1–2\) to the most subtle psychological underpinning, such as to be that ‘fine quality born of yoga’ practice \(yogajadharma VSc 9.13\). These different usages show the richness and problems of systematising the definition of the term. Among the different meanings received in Vaiśeṣika, a few can be mentioned. \(1\) Dharma \(in opposition to adharma\), a quality among the 24 \(VSc 1.1.5; 7\). \(2\) ‘Teaching instrument’ \(instrumental case\) leading to niḥśreyasa \(VS 1.1.2; VSc 1.1.6; VSc 6.2.11\). \(3\) ‘Teaching instrument’ leading to abhyudaya \(VS 

1.1.2; VSc 10.20\). \(4\) Ethical, āśramic and ritualistic implication \(VSc 6.1.4–6; VS 6.1.15, VSc 6.2.17–18\). \(5\) Type of ‘yogic dharma’ \(yogajadharma\) \(VSc 9. 13\). \(6\) ‘Collection’ \(sañcita\) of dharmas/adharma associated with the ‘doctrine of karma’ \(VSc 5.1.15; VSc 6.2.18; VSc 9.28\). \(7\) 

‘Teaching’ of śruti and smṛti texts and their injunctions \(VSc 6.1.1; VSc 10.19–20\). \(8\) ‘Corpus of teaching’ \(VS 1.1.1\). \(9\) The teaching about Īśvara, who is the authority on which āmnāya texts lay \(VSc 1.1.3\). \(10\) Related to ‘knowledge of true nature of padārthas’ \(VSc 1.1.6\), or to things 

‘small,’ ‘hidden,’ and ‘remote’ \(VSc 9.28\). \(11\) ‘Defining characteristic’ \(VSc 2.1.7–8; VSc 3.1.7; VS 4.2.5; VSc 9.8\). \(12\) ‘Mental category’ sometimes related to transmigration \(saṃskāra\) or involved in connecting soul with mind \(VSc 9.24–25; 9.28\). For more, see Moise 2019: 85–93.

**1.3 Synopsis of VSc \(Baroda ed. 1961\)**

Table 1.2 shows the dominant preoccupation of the Vaiśeṣikasūtra with certain themes and topics. A clear-cut differentiation between these might not be possible, because each ‘daily lesson’ \(āhnika\) discusses more than 1 topic. There is a great deal of overlap in the chapters \(adhyāya\) too, for themes and arguments intertwine continuously. In VSc 9, for instance, one cannot say that all the chapter is concerned with only epistemology because various topics crop up, such as the theory of the pre-existence of a product \(asatkāryavāda\), yoga, soul \(ātman\), canonical means of knowledge such as sound \(śabda-pramāṇa\), traditional recollection \(smṛti\), state of sleep \(svapna\), and mental residue \(saṃskāra\), all of which bound together. For another synopsis of Sūtrapāṭha, one may refer to Thakur \(2003\), but his presentation is eclectic and neglects certain key soteriological passages of Candrānanda. My synopsis presents only Candrānanda’s view on Vaiśeṣika doctrine. 

Since the Baroda edition is a Sanskrit  edition, to those students not yet familiar with the language, here now I provide a summary of its contents. Immediately after the first pages, we see Jambūvijayaji’s Sanskrit eulogy \(samarpaṇa\) to his guru followed by an English foreword by B.J. Sandesara \(pp. vii–x\). A Sanskrit summary of the contents \(viṣayānukrama\) \(pp. 11–14\) follows, as well as a Sanskrit bibliographical list of the works used \(pp. 15–17\). Furthermore, an English bibliographical list with abbreviations \(pp. xix–xxi\); an introduction \(prastāvanā\) in Sanskrit by the editor Muni Jambūvijayaji \(pp. 1–16\); a series of photocopies from the MSS used \(Jaina Devanagari and Śāradā, Sanskrit, and Tibetan scripts\); the English introduction of Anantalal Thakur \(pp. 1–23\); the Sanskrit text of VSc with a variant reading of the ‘P’ and ‘O’ MSS and the emendation by the editor \(pp. 1–76\); a Sanskrit comparative 10-fold appendix \(pariśiṣṭa\), which compares variations between VS and VSv \(‘short’ and ‘long version’\), and VSs \(pp. 

77–224\);89a new Sanskrit comparative appendix \(navam pariśiṣṭa\) \(pp. 225–6\); a section on MSS variations in Sanskrit \(vṛddhipattraka\) \(pp. 227–34\); an errata \(śuddhipattraka\) in English and Sanskrit \(pp. 235–7\); and a handwritten photocopy of the Tibetan sources discussed under Appendix 1 \(pp. 153–219\). A swift survey over the whole of VSc content can be made with the summary given by Jambūvijayaji \(pp. 11–14\). Table 1.2 shows the main concepts classified by chapter and daily lessons. 

[^89]: The seventh section in this appendix \(pp. 153–219\) contains an English presentation of the Tibetan sources adduced in support of the reconstruction of the VS. I have not had the chance to dwell on this aspect here.

***VSc 1.1 \(29 sūtras\)***

VSc begins with a discussion between a Brahmin student and a teacher whose name is Kaṇabhakṣa. The Brahmin requests some clarification on a quote from Chāndogya Upaniṣad \(8.12.1\) and asks about the means for the removal of pleasant and unpleasant affections in an embodied self, the meaning of dharma, its characteristic marks, as well as its purpose, the means by which dharma is achievable, and the prerequisites needed by a pupil to obtain it \(1\). A short explanation about the difference between ‘mundane elevation’ \(abhyudaya\) and ‘liberation’ \(niḥśreyasa\) is given \(2\), as well as the divine authorship of the Vedas \(3\), the list of 9 substances \(4\), and the list of 24 qualities \(5\). According to Candrānanda, the number of categories is 6 \(6\). Since the knowledge of these categories is paramount to produce merit \(dharma\), which leads to absolute liberation \(niḥśreyasa\), the whole lesson is concerned with listing and briefly describing the categories by 2 epistemological procedures: drawing ‘similarities’ 

\(sādharmya\) \(7\) and ‘differentiations’ \(vaidharmya\) \(8–16\). Within differentiations, the characteristics of dravya \(14\), quality \(15\), and motion \(16\) follow. 

Common cause \(17–19; 29\) and common effect \(22–8\) are equally taken into consideration. The importance of this lesson is that it shows not only the nature of soteriology but also the function to attain it by a dualistic epistemological method of inquiry \(with sādharmya and vaidharmya\) whereby once afflictions \(doṣa\) are exposed, detachment from these becomes a necessity, after which the achievement of merit that leads to niḥśreyasa is achieved \(6\). Among all categories, substances are paramount. They are related to both mundane elevation \(abhyudaya\) \(on which knowledge depends on the performance of a series of rituals and sacrifices\) and liberation \(niḥśreyasa\) \(where the soul is subject to\). In both cases, dharma, which is the teaching of this ontology, represents an important tool. 

***VSc 1.2 \(18 sūtras\)***

This lesson deals with the Vaiśeṣika’s metaphysics, particularly with 2 more categories, ‘universality’ \(sāmānya\) and ‘particularity’ \(viśeṣa\); after a brief discussion about the precedence of cause ahead of effect \(1–2\), the VS and VSc deal with the category of ‘universality’ and ‘particularity,’ both of which depend on a ‘cognition’ \(buddhi\) \(3\). Within universality, the ontological category of existence \(bhāva\) is defined as universal only \(4\). It seems that universality and particularity are 2 categories that explain the nature of the 3 preceding categories: ‘substantiality’ \(dravyatva\), ‘qualitiness’ \(guṇatva\), and ‘motionness’ 

\(karmatva\), which are both universals and particularities \(5\). An ‘ultimate particularity’ \(antyaviśeṣa\) is also discussed \(6\). ‘Being’ \(sattā\), which is not a separate category, nor a substance, motion, or quality, is that from which the notion of ‘existence’ \(‘sat sat’\) arises \(7–11\). After another explanation of dravyatva, guṇatva, and karmatva \(12–17\), this lesson ends with the doctrine of the ‘unity of existence’ \(eka bhāva\) \(18\).

***VSc 2.1 \(28 sūtras\)***

As stated in its introductory line, the programme of this lesson is to ‘differentiate’ 

between various basic elements \(mahābhūta\), namely ‘earth’ \(pṛthivī\) \(1\); ‘water’ 

\(ap\) \(2\); ‘lustre’ \(tejas\) \(3\), ‘wind’ \(vāyu\) \(4\); and ‘ether’ \(ākāśa\) \(5; 20\); and their relationship with qualities and defining ‘marks’ \(lakṣaṇa\) such as ‘fluidity’ 

\(dravatva\) \(6\) or ‘touch’ \(sparśa\) \(9\). Various opponents’ views \(VSc 15; 16; 20; 21; 23\) are exposed and rejected. Though sound-word is not mentioned in the list of the qualities \(VS 1.1.5\), in VS 2.1.16, however, it is said to be a quality of substances such as ākāśa. As in the case of bhāva, which again appears in \(28\), sound-word is a quality not mentioned by Kaṇāda’s classification. In fact, Kaṇāda’s Sūtrapāṭha did not specify a fixed number of categories as his commentators \(Candrānanda and Praśastapāda\) would do later; it could well be that they were ‘categories of knowledge’ intrinsic, or subsumed within categories, or within substances. 

***VSc 2.2 \(43 sūtras\)***

An extended lesson, this represents a continuation of the discussion on ‘discernment’ \(vaidharmya\) begun by the previous lesson, with a focus on substances like kāla, diś, and ākāśa, and on a specific characteristic of qualities such as ‘touchiness’ \(‘sparśavadviśeṣaguṇa’\) mentioned in the introductory line of the first sūtra. 

Other ‘characteristics of qualities’ are discussed, such as ‘hot’ \(uṣṇa\) \(2\), ‘smell’ 

\(gandha\) \(3\), and ‘coolness’ \(śīta\) \(5\), which are not usually mentioned in the canonical list of qualities. Similarly, certain characteristic marks \(liṅga\) of substances such as ‘time’ \(kāla\) \(6; 8; 11\), ‘wind’ \(vāyu\) \(7\), and ‘direction’ \(diś\) \(12–

18\) are also discussed. But the second part of this lesson \(from 19 onwards\) turns to more epistemological topics such as ‘doubt’ \(saṃśaya\) \(19\), which arises from vidyā, and avidyā \(23\), or sound-word which, as maintained by Candrānanda, is a non-eternal quality \(29; 42–3\); Vaiśeṣikas’ view on sound-word is refuted here most probably by Mīmāṃsā critics \(38–41\). 

***VSc 3.1 \(14 sūtras\)***

The third chapter mainly deals with the substance ‘soul’ \(ātman\), whose reality is proved in the first lesson with a description of inferential probans and pseudo-probans. One way by which Candrānanda demonstrates it is by ‘differentiating’ 

between ‘sense-objects’ \(indriyārtha\) \(1\) and the ‘sense-organs’ \(2\). These are established \(prasiddha\) to be different from each other. For example, here ‘sense-object’ is sound-word, whereas ‘sense-organ’ is ‘ear’ \(śrotra\) \(VSc 3.1.2\). Based on the differentiation between ‘senses’ and ‘objects,’ Candrānanda postulates the existence of a ‘knower to be inferred beyond these’ \(paro grahītātmānumīyate\). 

The soul, not the senses, is the ‘grasper’ \(grahītṛ\) of the objects \(VSc 2, 3\). Like in VSc 2.2, here too, we have some objections to the view expressed \(3; 7\) and it is for this very purpose that Candrānanda offers a list of 10 logical relations \(out 

{{29}}

of which 8 are inferential probans\) that Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology is based on, and which serve the purpose to prove the existence of soul \(8–9\). 90 There is also a 

discussion about several types of ‘non-established’ \(aprasiddha\), ‘contradictory’ 

\(virodha\), or ‘invalid arguments’ \(anapadeśa\) \(10\), a ‘doubtful reason’ \(sandigdha\) based on a non-existing \(asat\) cause \(11\), or ‘variable reason’ \(anaikāntika\) \(12\). Towards the close of this lesson, VSc explains the existence of soul through a categorisation of what is commonly called ‘ordinary knowledge’ \(jñāna\), produced out of a ‘4-fold contact’ \(catuṣṭayasannikarṣa\) \(13\). Ātman is also proved from the capacity of ‘propensity’ \(pravṛtti\) and ‘antipathy’ \(nivṛtti\) of and towards the body \(śarīra\); the motions in the body prove that, what ultimately exists, is a different grasper of perception, identified as the soul \(14\). 

***VSc 3.2 \(17 sūtras\)***

The 2 main substances discussed in this lesson are ‘soul’ \(ātman\) and ‘mind’ 

\(manas\). The proofs for the existence of soul derive from the theory of ‘knowledge’ \(jñāna\), which is produced through the ‘contact’ \(sannikarṣa\) between 

‘soul,’ ‘senses,’ and ‘sense-objects’ via the mediating role of ‘mind’ \(1\). The mark that proves the existence of mind is not only the ‘contact’ between objects, senses, and soul, but also because of the obvious ‘manifestation’ and ‘non-manifestation’ of knowledge \(jñānasyābhāvo bhāvaś ca\) \(1\). Twelve ‘physical marks’ 

\(ātmaliṅgāni\) for the existence of the embodied soul are described \(4\), against which an objection is raised \(6\) because a ‘seen mark’ \(dṛṣṭaliṅga\), like ‘breathing’ \(prāṇa\), cannot prove the existence of soul, but at most, it can be proved only 

‘on the basis of tradition’ \(āgamika\) \(8\). Candrānanda counters this view with the argument that the ‘I’ \(ahaṃ\) consciousness is real because, although in apposition with wind, it is, however, different from it, as well as from entities like ‘earth’ 

and so on \(9\). The lesson continues with a series of epistemological arguments, by which Candrānanda responds and refutes the opposite views raised against Vaiśeṣika’s tenets on the nature of soul and its number \(10–17\). 

***VSc 4.1 \(14 sūtras\)***

The analysis of substances goes into more minute detail. In judging the ‘permanent’ \(nitya\) nature of substances, VSc discusses the existence of atoms that are eternal, and their knowledge is equally important. Candrānanda deals with a 2-fold epistemology enunciated in the opening line, namely ‘comprehensibility’ \(upalabdhi\) and ‘non-comprehensibility’ \(anupalabdhi\),91 as referred to the 

[^90]:  Among which, the third proban \(ekārthasamavāyi\) is 2-fold \(kārya kāryāntara; kāraṇa kāraṇāntara\), while the virodha proban is 4-fold. See the section on epistemology \(fifth chapter of this thesis\). 

[^91]:  Ganesh Thite \(personal communication\) translates upalabdhi with ‘obtainment,’ and anupalabdhi with ‘non-obtainment’; other options can be ‘perception,’ ‘non-perception,’ ‘recognition,’ and 

‘non-recognition,’ respectively. 

existence of atoms \(1–5\), their triadic composition \(6–8\), and qualities \(9–14\). 

After a brief definition of ‘permanence’ \(nitya\) \(1\), a whole section on cognitive comprehension \(upalabdhi\) follows \(2–6\). This is the first epistemological part of this lesson, in which the knowledge of effects \(kārya\) that are impermanent \(2–3\) contrasts with the impermanent character of causes \(4\). Default knowledge or ignorance \(avidyā\) is the ‘impossibility’ \(abhāva\) of conceptualisation atoms beyond senses. But in the second part \(7–14\), 92 both Sūtrapāṭha and Vṛtti deal with the non-comprehension \(anupalabdhi\) of ‘atoms’ \(paramāṇu\) \(7\), or qualities like ‘number’ \(saṃkhyā\), ‘dimension’ \(parimāṇa\), ‘separateness’ \(pṛthaktva\), 

‘conjunction’ \(saṃyoga\), ‘disjunction’ \(vibhāga\), ‘farness’ \(paratva\),93 and ‘nearness’ \(aparatva\)94\(12\). The rationale behind this description is to establish whether things can be known, whether things have form, or can be perceived by eye \(13\). 

Things that have ‘form’ \(rūpa\) make knowledge possible \(6\), while things without form are not knowable by eye \(13\). This is the case in ordinary knowledge and perception. However, there are other things of an atomic form, which would be known only by forms of ‘extraordinary knowledge’ \(ārṣajñāna\) as mentioned by VSc 9.28. 

***VSc 4.2 \(19 sūtras\)***

From the knowledge of atomic substances \(in VSc 4.1\), this lesson takes the reader to the knowledge of basic elements \(mahābhūta\) that congregate to form various cosmic ‘bodies’ \(śarīra\), the main topic of this sub-chapter. It deals with the ‘perception’ \(pratyakṣa\) or ‘non-perception’ \(apratyakṣa\) of elements because not all elements are graspable. The bodies form out of 5 elements \(pañcātmaka\), of which only 3 are perceptible \(1\). VSc 4.2 offers a picture of the whole of Vaiśeṣika’s cosmology: the discussion runs from the abstract atomic elements to concrete bodies, which are ‘composite.’ These bodies are of many sorts: according to their substantial composition, earth, water, and so on \(3\), according to the 

‘variety of regions’ \(anekadeśa\), and their atomic composition to which these belong \(4\), according to their own ‘specific merit’ \(5\), and according to their 

‘particular effect, function’ \(kārya\) \(6\), which as a result bear a specific ‘name’ 

\(samākhyā\) \(7–9\). 95 These bodies are compounded from different types of atoms, where the birth composition determines the different regions in which their own subtle bodies will dwell after the decomposition of concrete bodies \(Varuṇaloka for water\) \(3\), such as Aṅgiras for the world for fire \(7–8\); as the Vedas indicates, there are also bodies ‘not born of womb,’ such as ‘moths’ \(śalabha\)\(6\), as well as 

‘sensorial body of the moon’ and ‘aqueous body’ \(9\). 

[^92]: With the exception when upalabdhi is proved through ‘inherence’ \(samavāya\). 

[^93]:  ‘Remoteness’ \(trans. Kumar, 2013, p. 27\); ‘priority’ \(trans. Halbfass, 1992, p. 208\). 

[^94]:  ‘Proximity’ \(trans. Kumar, 2013, p. 27\); ‘posteriority’ \(Halbfass, 1992, p. 208\). 

[^95]: This refers to the type of birth of bodies: for example, bodies not born out of the womb, VSc 4.2.7: aṅgārebhyo jāto’ṅgirā ity evamādisamākhyābhāvād manyāmahe santyayonijāni. 

{{31}}

***VSc 5.1 \(18 sūtras\)***

The fifth chapter largely deals with ‘motion’ \(karma\), which is the third among Vaiśeṣika categories as mentioned in VSc 1.1.6. In the first lesson, motion is 2-fold: caused by effort \(‘prayatna’\) \(1–12\), and not caused by effort \(13–18\), both of which may, or may not, concern soul. 96 Motion is possible because of a certain ‘conjunction’ \(saṃyoga\), and there are several kinds of such motions: 

‘hand-motion’ \(1\), ‘pestle-motion’ \(musalakarma\)\(2\), ‘stroke’ \(ābhighātā\) \(3\), 

‘soul-related-motion’ \(6\), ‘inertia’ \(gurutva\) \(7\), ‘impulse’ \(nodāna\) \(8–9\), ‘throwing up’ \(udasana\) \(10\), womb-child-motion’ \(dārakakarma\) \(11\), ‘spreading’ 

\(visphoṭana\) \(12\), ‘falling-during-sleep motion’ \(13\), ‘grass-motion’ \(tṛṇakarma\) \(14\), ‘gem-thief-motion’ \(15\), ‘arrow-motion’ \(16\), and ‘saṃskāra-motion’ \(18\). 

***VSc 5.2 \(28 sūtras\)***

It contains the soteriological doctrine of Vaiśeṣika, an event that takes place among other cosmological motions such as ‘earth-motion’ \(1\), due to an unseen force \(adṛṣṭa\), which is the cause for other cosmic motions such as ‘earthquake’ 

\(2\), ‘water-motion’ \(3–12\), and ‘crops-motion’ \(4\). Other motions discussed are 

‘fluidity’ \(dravatva\) \(5\), ‘ray-wind motion’ \(nāḍyāvāyusaṃyoga\) \(6\), ‘pushing’ 

\(nodana\) \(7\), ‘water-tree motion’ \(vṛkṣābhisarpaṇa\) \(8\), ‘freezing’ \(saṃghāta\) and ‘melting’ \(vilayana\) \(9\), ‘sky-water motion’ \(divyāsu\) \(10\), and ‘thunder-motion’ \(stanayitnu\) \(12\). Other cosmic motions enumerated are those between 

‘earth-water-wind’ \(13\), the motion of the ‘upward flaming of fire,’ the ‘motion of wind’ \(obliquely, zigzag\), the ‘first motion of atoms,’ or the ‘first motion of mind’ \(14\). On a more metaphysical level, other motions being mentioned are 

‘mind-motion’ on which yoga focuses on \(15–17\), ‘body-motion’ \(kāyakarmaṇa\) \(18\), motions triggered by adṛṣṭa within various effected actions \(kārya\) like ‘eating,’ ‘drinking,’ ‘going away,’ or ‘going near’ \(19\), and realisation of liberation \(mokṣa\) \(20\). After the list of motions \(physical and metaphysical\), the meaning of ‘darkness’ \(tamas\) \(21–22\), as well as the doctrine of the motionless nature of all-pervasive substances like ‘space’ \(diś\), ‘time’ \(kāla\), ‘ether’ \(ākāśa\), and soul \(23–28\) are given too. The fifth chapter is of particular importance for understanding the soteriology of the self, karma theory, and transmigration \(saṃsāra\). Being defined in a chapter on karma, liberation is to be read as being brought about at the moment when the soul is separated from all cosmological ‘relations’ \(saṃyoga\), which triggers motion \(‘theory of karma’\). 

[^96]:  Ātman being all-pervasive cannot have motion, cannot move. Here I am referring to volition \(prayatna\), which engages the embodied self with the external world.

***VSc 6.1 \(18 sūtras\)***

This chapter returns to qualities of which merit and its religious-ethical implications represent a chief topic, as the introductory line shows.97 Merit \(dharma\) is a quality with important relevance to both ethical and religious problems, as well as the Vaiśeṣika cosmology, and Candrānanda counts it among the specific qualities \(VSc 1.1.5; 3.2.17\) and other qualities. 98 Dharma is predominantly the subject of both lessons of the sixth chapter. The discussion of Vedas as a ‘composition,’ 

‘creation’ \(racanā\) by Bhagavān Maheśvara, makes it an ‘authoritative pramāṇa’ 

because of the ethical injunctions contained in the sacred texts \(Śāstras\) \(1\). In this lesson, 3 forms of knowledge are distinguished. First, the knowledge of the common people \(asmadvijñāna\); second, the knowledge which is only able to grasp the present things \(vartamānāvyavahita sambandhārtha viṣayaṃ\); and third, god’s knowledge, which is beyond our sense-organs. The ethics, to which the second lesson alludes in VSc 6.2.2, are built on the authority of the Vedic texts. 

Various ethical prescriptions and restrictions are discussed, such as ‘almsgiv-ings’ \(dadāti\) \(4\), ‘accepting’ \(pratigraha\) \(5\), ‘fellowship’99 \(samabhivyāhāra\) with good Brahmins \(8\), or restrictions of fellowship with impure Brahmins \(9\). 

Further ethical explanations are prescribed with regard to ‘violence’ \(hiṃsa\) \(10\), or ‘impure conversation’ with non-qualified persons \(11\), prescriptions, or restrictions in relation to the purity of ‘space,’ ‘time,’ ‘knowledge,’ and ‘behav-iour’ \(13\). In addition, there is a moral classification of Brahmins according to their ‘moral quality’ and Candrānanda differentiates between inferior \(hīna\) \(14\), mediocre \(sama\) \(17\), and qualified \(viśiṣṭa\) \(18\) types of Brahmins. 

***VSc 6.2 \(19 sūtras\)***

The second lesson is a continuation of the discussion on dharma enunciated in VSc 6.1, and deals with specific types of merit, mainly stipulated in the śruti and smṛti texts, all of which are conducive to elevation. These are of 3 kinds: \(1\) performances \(prayoga\) clearly expressed in the Vedas \(dṛṣṭa\); \(2\) acts where the purpose is mentioned \(dṛṣṭaprayojanāna\) in those texts; and \(3\) acts where the purpose is not mentioned in the sacred texts \(dṛṣṭābhāva\) \(1\). Candrānanda discusses 12 forms of ritualistic acts that lead to merit: sprinkling water \(abhiṣecana\), 

[^97]:  Candrānanda agrees with Praśastapāda, by recognising dharma as a quality of the self: karmāṇi vyākhyāya guṇā vyākhyāyante/tatra dharma ādau vyākhyāyate/śāstrādau tasy’oddiṣṭatvāt \(‘having explained the motions, now qualities will be described; here dharma will be explained first, as this is intended by the śāstra’\). The orthodoxy of Vaiśeṣika is here proved by its allegiance to the Vedas, whose injunctions are a ‘means’ \(sādhana\) of soteriological knowledge \(tasya vaidiko vidhiḥ sādhanaṁ; vedasya satyatā kuta iti cet yataḥ… see VSc 6.1.1\) 

[^98]:  For the list of vaiśeṣikaguṇas, see VSc 3.2.17: tasya guṇāḥ buddhi sukhaduḥkh’ecchādveṣa prayatnādṛṣṭa saṁskārā vaiśeṣikāḥ. Like Praśastapāda, Candrānanda also recognises in adṛṣṭa, 2 

vaiśeṣikaguṇas: dharma and adharma VSc 1.1.5. 

[^99]:  A literal translation might be ‘bringing together’ or ‘companionship,’ which could include feeding and speaking with the Brahmins. 

{{33}}

ablutions \(snāna\), fasting \(upavāsa\), celibacy \(brahmacarya\), apprenticeship with a guru \(gurukulavāsa\), forest-dwelling \(vānaprastha\), sacrifice \(yajña\), offerings \(dāna\), aspersion \(prokṣaṇa\), direction restriction \(diṅ-niyama\), lunar station restriction \(nakṣatra-niyama\), mantra restriction \(mantra-niyama\), and time restriction \(kāla-niyama\) \(2\). These injunctions correspond and differ according to the 4 ‘stages of life’ \(āśrama\); they are also classified 2-fold: when performed 

‘with break’ \(upadhā\) they lead to default, when performed ‘without break’ 

\(anupadhā\) they lead to merit \(3\). Within their respective categories, explanations are given related to ‘defect’ in a situation \(bhāvadoṣa\), for instance, ‘hypocrisy’ 

\(abhisandhi\) \(4–5\) and states of ‘purity’ \(śuci\) and ‘impurity’ \(aśuci\) \(6–8\). The lesson also contains an objection to the role of ‘effort’ in ritual performance, about which VSc responds that without ‘effort’ \(prayatna\) there is neither performance of yoga, nor mundane elevation \(10–11\). There is a turning point with sūtra 12, where merit turns out to be conductive to ‘liberation’ \(niḥśreyasa\). Though as a 

‘specific quality,’ dharma can act as a burden upon the self, here both VS and VSc describe it as dependent upon a chain of affections, ‘pleasure’ \(sukha\), ‘passion’ \(rāga\) \(12–13; 16\), and ‘satisfaction’ \(tṛpta\) \(14\), all of which seem to determine a ‘particular birth’ produced from a ‘particular passion’ \(16\). ‘Propensity’ 

\(pravṛtti\), which might be related to ‘effort,’ is produced by ‘volition’ \(icchā\) and ‘aversion’ \(dveṣa\), and subsequently produces an ‘accumulation’ \(sañcita\) of merit and default \(17\), which, because of the other 2 qualities, conjunction \(saṃyoga\) and disjunction \(vibhāga\), would lead to the emergence of a returning 

‘jantu’ trapped in a cyclical process called ‘birth condition’ \(janmākhya\) \(18\). It seems that the accumulation of merit and default is triggered by a chain of specific qualities. The last sūtra \(19\) concludes that mokṣa has been explained and should further be understood within the discussion of motion and soul, an obvious reference to VSc 5.2.20. 

***VSc 7.1 \(32 sūtras\)***

In the seventh chapter, the major topic of discussion is the category of qualities, some of which have already been explained \(7.1–3\). The first lesson deals with various qualities in relation to various basic elements and the question to which it responds is whether qualities are permanent or not. The impermanent nature of qualities is determined by the nature of elements, which can be impermanent too, due to their composite character \(4\); 100 as qualities reside in substance-elements, their production and dissolution depend on the state of these substance-elements. 

Another section of this lesson deals with the nature of qualities like ‘colour,’ 

‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ and ‘touch’ in the substance-mahābhūta ‘earth.’ Touch \(sparśa\) is not permanent because its ‘substratum’ \(āśraya\) is not permanent either \(4\). 

[^100]:  Candrānanda quotes sūtra 1.1.15 as one which elucidates the relationship between dravya and karma. If the ordering of the Sūtras was correctly made by the Baroda 1961 edition, Candrānanda must refer here, in fact, to 1.1.16 \(karmalakṣaṇa\) not 1.1.15 \(guṇalakṣaṇa\). 

The impermanence of ‘earth’ \(pṛthivī\) refers to the composite state of earth \(compounded by atoms – paramāṇu\) and the state of an earthly product such as pot \(ghaṭa\) that is prone to ‘destruction’ \(vināśa\). In the second part, however \(6–18\), the question of permanence and impermanence of qualities shifts towards that of atoms \(paramāṇu\). The nature of qualities like colour, taste, and touch is discussed in relation to substances like ‘water,’ ‘fire,’ and ‘air’ \(7–8\); when discussing the elements ‘water,’ ‘fire,’ and ‘wind,’ Candrānanda looks at the state of their atomic composition \(8–10\).101 Thakur \(2003\), classifies 9–13 as dealing with the 

‘origination of the first five qualities.’ Qualities are born of heating, hence they are not co-eternal with substances because substances pre-exist qualities \(12\).102 

The question of ‘permanence’ \(nitya\) seems to be coeval with the ‘understanding’ \(anupalabdhi\) of dimension \(15–31\). ‘Eternal’ \(nitya\) is whatever is ‘atomic’ 

\(aṇu\) or ‘gross’ or ‘large’ \(mahat\) \(15\).103 Universal concepts like ‘magnitude’ 

\(mahattva\) and ‘smallness’ \(aṇuttva\) are also considered \(21–23\). Valid knowledge \(vidyā\) is defined in relation to what manifests \(saṃbhava\), whereas ‘ignorance’ \(avidyā\) is defined in terms of ‘non-existence’ \(asaṃbhava\) \(27\). 104 The third part, finally \(28–32\), deals with the dimension of various substances such as ākāśa, which is ‘boundless’ \(paramamahattva\) \(28\), and more importantly, that of ‘soul,’ which is ‘exceedingly big’ \(paramahān\) \(29\). Mind is atomic and Candrānanda defines its function not as simultaneous, but rather as a sequential \(30\). Time, similarly, is ‘all-pervasive’ \(vibhū\) \(32\). 

***VSc 7.2 \(31 sūtras\)***

In this lesson, 4 sections can be distinguished: the first part is focused on the analysis of further qualities such as distinctness \(pṛthaktva\) \(1–14\). In order to explain it, both VS and VSc put forward a discussion of other conceptual or abstract categories: oneness \(ekatva\) \(1\), smallness \(aṇuttva\) and grossness \(mahattva\) \(4\), conjunction \(saṃyoga\) \(10\), and disjunction \(vibhāga\) \(11–12\), which are explained in juxtaposition to further characteristics such as ‘small’ and ‘gross’ 

\(12\). The second part \(15–24\) is epistemological. Though sound-word is not listed among the 17 qualities \(VS 1.1.5\), according to Vaiśeṣika’s theory of language, sound-word is disconnected from meaning \(artha\) \(19\). This section presents and rejects some opposing views, and supplies Vaiśeṣika’s theory of semantics, according to which, meaning is established by mutual conventional agreement \(sāmayika\) \(24\). Other qualities discussed are ‘proximity’ \(paratva\) and ‘remoteness’ \(aparatva\) \(21–24\), which have both a temporal and spatial connotation \(25–27\). The third part \(29–31\) shifts back to a discussion of another category: 

[^101]:  On atoms: VSc 7.1.6–10; 15–18; 26. 

[^102]: This doctrine is important because ātman in its liberated state is divested from its own vaiśeṣikaguṇas. 

[^103]:  Atom is eternal because is circular \(parimaṇḍalya\) \(VSc 7.1.26\)

[^104]: This could raise the question of whether for the Vaiśeṣikas, vidyā is the science of everything that so daringly both Vyomaśiva’s Vyomavati \(p. 47\) and Kir GOS \(p. 148\) put forward. 

{{35}}

inherence \(samavāya\) \(29\), a category with which Candrānanda explains how qualities are inherent in substances \(e.g. cloth inherent in threads\). The lesson ends by discussing the ontological concepts of ‘existence’ \(bhāva\) \(30\) and ‘suchness’ \(tattva\) \(31\). 

***VSc 8 \(17 sūtras\)105***

The eighth, ninth, and tenth chapters deal with Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology. Since knowledge \(buddhi; jñāna\) is a cognitive faculty, a quality \(as per VS 1.1.5\), its nature is impermanent, as it is caused by substances such as soul and mind \(2\). 

This lesson presents the Vaiśeṣika’s theory of knowledge \(or perception\) that is explained primarily in relation to the substance-category, an aspect that shows the capital role of this category in the ontological and epistemological structure of the system \(1\). As Nozawa describes, this lesson has a 3-fold structure. The first part \(1–3\) is an introduction dealing with knowledge, which Candrānanda says is produced from a contact \(sannikarṣa\) between substances \(1–2\),106 yet not in relation to qualities, which are not ultimately in contact with the sense-organs, therefore, they are not knowable perceptually \(3\). Cognition \(buddhi\) refers to that form of ‘perceptual knowledge’ \(as in VS 3.1.13\) that engages both mind and soul, being as they were, causes for the production of knowledge \(2\). The second part \(4–13\) deals with objects of perception, namely the first 3 categories: substance, quality, and motion. Candrānanda distinguishes between ‘substance padārtha’ as knowable through direct contact with the sense-organs, on the one hand, and quality and motion categories, which are known through an ‘inherence’ 

\(samavāya\) with the conjunct, which is substance \(4\), on the other hand. It seems that knowledge of ‘substance padārtha’ is the basis that the whole edifice of the 

‘theory of perception’ or ‘knowledge’ is based upon.107 Such epistemological discussion extends over other categories as well: ‘generality’ \(sāmānya\), which does not possess another generality; and ‘specificity’ \(viśeṣa\), which does not possess its own specificity \(5\). It is only substance \(tat eva\) that possesses ‘generality’ 

and ‘specificity.’ The knowledge of the 3 basic categories depends \(āpekṣate\) on another 2 categories: universality and particularity \(6\). The knowledge of the 3 categories, substance, quality, and motion, seems to depend on the knowledge of substance \(7\). Thus, substance is the foundation of Vaiśeṣika ontology, even though the Vṛtti mentions that there is no rule as to whether the substance category 

‘should be first’ \(8\). Inherence is defined as the co-existentiality between cause and effect, and in relation to a ‘specifier’ \(viśeṣaṇa\) and a ‘specified’ \(viśeṣya\) thing \(9\). There is no cause-effect relationship between substances as well as between the first categories \(10–11\). In the same context, mind is described as atomic \(aṇutva\), therefore, the chain of perceptual thought would be a line of 

[^105]:  A presentation of the eighth chapter, see Nozawa’s article, 1993a. 

[^106]:  On 4-fold contact that produces perceptual knowledge, see also VSc 3.1.13.

minute details being produced ‘in sequence’ \(jñānānāṃ krameṇāpi\). The example given is the phrase ‘gauḥ śuklā gacchatī,’ where cow is a substance \(or noun\), 

‘śuklā’ is a quality \(adjective\), and ‘gacchatī’ is a motion \(verb\); although they are produced in sequence, Candrānanda says that there is no cause-effect relationship between them \(11\). Other examples are given in order to explain the various relations between ‘near things’ \(sannikṛṣṭa\) and ‘distant things’ \(viprakṛṣṭa\) \(12\), or between ‘seen things’ \(loc. dṛṣṭeṣu\) and ‘unseen things’ \(loc. adṛṣṭeṣu\) \(13\). 

The third part of this chapter \(14–17\) deals with sense-organs \(artha\). These are proved in a consequential manner: for example, each of the sense-objects corresponds to a sense-organ, which subsequently corresponds to the 5 basic elements, out of which an object is produced. The sense-organs have a ‘fixed function’ 

\(pratiniyata\) in accordance with the specific elements \(15\). An example is given in sūtra 16 where earth relates to smell and nose, through co-existentiality; and, in sūtra 17, where there is a relationship between form, touch, and colour, corresponding to substances like water, lustre, and wind. 

***VSc 9 \(28 sūtras\)108***

The subject of inquiry in this chapter is ‘inference’ \(anumāna\). This lesson may be classified into 3 sections. The first part inquires into the nature of reality \(1–12\). 

The theory of asatkāryavāda comes into the first sūtra and its gloss. A real product \(sat\) is not extant prior to its actual physical production \(prāg utpatter asat\) because there is no ‘function’ \(kriyā\), ‘quality’ \(guṇa\), and ‘designation’ \(vyapadeśa\) of it \(1\). The word ‘sat’ refers to a current existing effect \(sadbhūta\)\(2\) and it is defined by a comparison with non-real \(asat\); the difference between them is that ‘sat’ has capacity to affect quality and designation, whereas ‘asat’ does not \(3\). In the continuation of this, non-real \(asat\) is furthermore defined \(4–10\). It is with the help of logical and epistemological reasoning that the ‘non-real’ is proved: these refer to ‘differentiation’ \(5\), the absence of the perception of a past thing \(6\), negative terms like ‘non-pot,’ ‘non-cow,’ and ‘default’ \(7\), absence of different meanings \(9\), special and temporal entities \(10\), and universality \(11\), as well as inferential reasoning \(12\). In the second part of the ninth chapter, we have yogic perception \(yogipratyakṣa\) \(13–17\), a superior form of perception produced out of a specific contact \(saṃyogaviśeṣa\) between mind and soul \(13\). Like soul, other substances are proved through this perceptual type of contact \(14\), but categories like quality and motion are known through co-existentiality \(16\). The third and last part \(18–28\) deals with various forms of knowledge. The inferential \(laiṅgika\) form of knowledge \(18\), ‘testimony’ \(śabda\) \(19\), ‘reason, agent’ \(hetu\), ‘pretext’ 

\(anapadeśa\), ‘mark’ \(liṅga\), and ‘efficient cause’ \(nimitta\) are considered synonymous \(20–1\). The production of ‘recollection’ \(smṛti\) is caused by a latent impression \(saṃskāra\), and a particular relation between mind and soul \(22\). Similar factors produce surface dreams \(svapna\) and ‘sub-conscious’ ones \(svapnāntika\) 

[^108]:  For a translation of VSc 9.1–12, see Halbfass, 1992, pp. 242–6.

\(22–3\) as well. It seems that a ‘specific dharma’ plays a role in dream functions \(24\). Ignorance \(avidyā\) and impure knowledge \(duṣṭa jñāna\) can arise because of certain ‘impurities’ \(doṣa\) in the embodied soul, and because of a ‘dormant impetus’ \(saṃskāra\) \(25–6\). The opposite of it is the ‘pure knowledge’ \(aduṣṭa vidyā\) \(27\), on which Candrānanda does not say more; he only says that it is of 2 types: perception \(pratyakṣa\) and inference \(anumāna\). He nevertheless discusses 2 unusual forms of knowledge – ārṣa and siddhadarśana – both produced from a ‘particular dharma’ \(28\). 

***VSc 10 \(21 sūtras\)***

The last chapter continues to deal with the system’s epistemology, and given its eclectic nature, a classification is needed. The first part \(1–3\) deals with a series of binary qualities such as pleasure \(sukha\) and pain \(duḥkha\) that inhere in soul \(1\); pleasure and pain relate to desired and undesired things \(2\). 109 There is also an elucidation about the difference between doubt \(saṃśaya\) and conclusion \(nirṇaya\) \(3–4\). The second part takes up the discussion of perception explained through various types of argument; cognition \(buddhi\) an equivalent term for pratyakṣa is explained as being produced through a cause-effect relationship, between a specifier \(viśeṣaṇa\) and ‘specified object’ \(viśeṣya\) \(5–6\), or between a ‘dependent’ \(sāpekṣa\) and ‘non-dependent’ \(anāpekṣa\) thing \(7\), 110 or explained through the concept of ‘destruction’ \(vināśa\) of body limbs, a section relevant to body and eschatology \(8–10\). Cognition – a specific quality of the embodied soul – is also proved in relation to ‘inherence’ and ‘contact’ 

\(12–18\). Finally, the third part concludes with the restatement of soteriology, based on several assumptions already discussed in the previous chapters. \(1\) The inferential type of knowledge \(laiṅgika pramāṇa\) by means of which inference has been explained \(19\); \(2\) the Vedic prescriptions, ‘seen’ or ‘unseen,’ in the sacred texts \(āmnāya\) \(20\); and \(3\) a restatement of Vaiśeṣika theism, with at least ‘4 stages’ in which absolute liberation \(niḥśreyasa\) can be realised \(21\). 

For a more simplified synopsis of all chapters in both VSc and VS, in Table 1.3, 

I present an alternative thematic classification that should be of better use. 

**1.4 Author and date of VSc**

About the author of VSc, we know very little.111 From the internal evidence, like that given by the colophon, we know that the name of the author is Candrānanda, 

[^109]: Though Candrānanda does not mention aniṣṭa in its gloss, we may assume that aniṣṭa refers to duḥkha. 

[^110]:  The simile used by Candrānanda is the ‘threads’ \(tantu\) that symbolise their interdependence from each other in a piece of cloth; the simile is also used to express the relations of precedence and successiveness. 

[^111]: I have little to add on Candrānanda as the author; yet, differently from Isaacson’s conjectures \(PhD

and the etymology of his name indicates the emphasis on knowledge he lays of his teaching. ‘Candra,’ whose masculine noun designates ‘moon’ while its adjectival form means ‘glittering’ or ‘shining,’ must illustrate the gnostic and philosophical allegiance of the author, for ‘moon’ in Indian thought is the symbol of ‘mind.’112 

The simile used here resembles the author’s name with the moon, whose name Candrānanda bears. A somehow problematic translation of the colophon could mean that knowledge comes from the author himself, and spreads over the cosmos, for the moon acts as spelling out the darkness during night-time. It is not a knowledge that comes as an inspiration from the cosmos \(like revelation in Christianity\), but quite the contrary, it is the author himself who is being praised as the bestower of this cosmic and cosmological knowledge \(Vaiśeṣika system\).

Gloss: like the moon produces bliss always in the night of knowledge/

Candrānanda composed this commentary to delight the moon. 

The New Catalogus Catalogorum gives information of a certain Candrānanda 

‘writer on medicine and medical lexicography,’ ‘son of Ravinandana, and grandson of Mahānandana,’ whom, according to the genealogy of Dhallaṇa, was originally from Kaśmīr. 117 Regarding the location of his activity, Isaacson states that the indications we have \(Śārāda script MS, and Abhinavagupta’s 1995\), here I only aim to discuss the colophon and the probable location of VSc composition.

[^114]:  The older MS \(siglum ‘P’ or ‘J’\), however, reads ‘vidyāsarvayāḥ’ for which I have opted here; Baroda MS \(siglum ‘O’ or ‘Ś’\) reads ‘vidyāyāḥ sarvathā.’ VSc 1961 provides ‘vidyāśarvaryāḥ,’ 

which might complicate the reading; but Ruzsa, who used the 1982 ed., makes a conjecture with 

‘vidyāsavayāḥ’ \(metre, requires āryā\).

reference to Candrānanda\)118 point clearly to Kaśmīr, though as he says, his remarks are ‘not conclusive.’119 Although I have no objection to the location and the date of Candrānanda put forward by Isaacson, yet, I do have a few reservations regarding Isaacson’s ‘impression’ of Candrānanda’s commentary as being ‘deeply influenced by Praśastapāda,’ not least because his assertions are grounded on secondary literature \(e.g. Nozawa readings\), rather than a direct comparative reading with PD. 120 Indeed, a certain doctrinal relationship with Praśastapāda has often been too much emphasised by scholars, such as Nozawa, who in his translation of the first 2 chapters provides extensive comparative footnotes with PD, and with later Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika works through the lenses of which Candrānanda is read. The case I make, however, is that though Candrānanda might have been contemporary with Praśastapāda, he does present an older and more traditional and canonical view on Vaiśeṣika doctrine, for the following reasons. \(1\) The number of specific qualities in VSc is smaller \(9\) than in PD \(16\). \(2\) The role of god is not so greatly emphasised in the cosmogony and eschatology of Vaiśeṣika. Candrānanda, for instance, ascribes adṛṣṭa as the cause and role for the formation of the world, and the gloss VSc 5.2.14 does not mention about god as operating adṛṣṭa, though it is true, both VSc 1.1.3 and VSc 10.21 acknowledge Bhagavān Īśvara as the creator of cosmos. \(3\) The religious affiliation of Candrānanda is Brahmanical, not explicitly Śaivist, whereas Praśastapāda is Śaivist; this may confirm the existence of various schools in Vaiśeṣika in the second half of the first millennium. \(4\) Candrānanda provides an older version of Sūtrapāṭha, and an older interpretation of the system than Praśastapāda. The hypothesis that we can launch is that, even if Candrānanda may not have been earlier than Praśastapāda, it is beyond doubt that his brevity and more conservative exegesis is older, hence more reliable than Praśastapāda’s innovative approach. As for the date of VSc, Aklujkar has dated VSc has having been composed between the 7th and 10th centuries AD. The ‘terminus post quem’ for Candrānanda is 600 AD, on the grounds of a reference he makes \(in VSc 3.2.4\) to Uddyotakara’s Vārttika. The 

‘terminus ante quem’ is the 10th century AD. Aklujkar says that Helārāja quotes from VSc, 121 whereas Isaacson identifies another reference to Vaiśeṣika in the Abhinavagupta’s commentary on Īshvarapratyabhijñāvimarshinī of Utpaladeva \(10th century AD\). The importance of Candrānanda’s commentary, however, resides not in the composition time, but rather in the conservative interpretation on the Sūtrapāṭha and the integrity of its version and the commentary it preserves. 

[^118]: Isaacson 1995, p. 141, \(via Shah, 1957, 7\) refers to Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarshinī of Utpaladeva with commentary by Abhinavagupta.
