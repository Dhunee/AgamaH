[^241]: the plurality of soul is proved from the unique varieties of ‘desires’ and ‘volitions’ 

that each soul has independently of others; souls are plural not only in their existential embodied condition, but in their pre-qualitness state as well, for soul has as a generic quality that never ceases to characterise it, ‘separateness’ \(pṛthaktva\). 

[^242]: what differentiates the ‘specific qualities’ of the soul from its ‘generic qualities’ is that the latter are those that define best the nature of the pure soul in its pre-embodied, intransitive, fixed state, the state of its liberation, where souls are differentiated not by happiness, sorrow, and so forth, but by calm and simplicity of an infinite number of different souls that through conjunction and disjunction are interrelated, forming as it were, a ‘one substance’ soul.

***3.2.17. \[plurality of soul\] is confirmed by the sacred scriptures \[śāstras\]***

‘one who desires \[heavenly\] village should perform a sacrifice’ \[…\], ‘one who desires heaven should perform a sacrifice’ \[…\], these are from śāstras’ authority 

\[and show that\] ‘souls’ are many;241 the \[specific\] qualities of it \[soul\] are ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion,’ ‘effort,’ ‘unseen force’ \[dharma and adharma\], \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; but the other qualities \[of soul\] are ‘num-

ber,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ \[and\] ‘disjunction.’242

thus, having explained the permanence, comprehension, and non-comprehension of the substances from the earlier discussion, he speaks now of another \[concept\]

***4.1.1. permanent is that \[thing\] which is not caused243***

that which is devoid of cause, non-substantiality, and so forth, that is called eter-

nal, such as the atoms, and so forth \[are\]; as for its comprehension244

***4.1.2. effect is the mark \[of its permanence\]***

even though atoms and so forth, are not comprehended by sense-organs, nevertheless, the body, the great elements and so forth, these products245 are their marks, because

[^243]: the permanent thing has no cause, which is to say, is uncaused, but as the following sūtra 4.1.2. mentions, it does have effect, it produces effects. 

[^244]: Here is the externalist view of Vaiśeṣika’s ontology, regardless of whether these substances are perdurers \(atoms of the mahābhūtas\) or eternal and wholistic \(vacuum, space, time, soul, and mind\). 

[^245]: bodies \(śarīra\) and the elements \(mahābhūta\) \(all of which are composed of atoms\) are products only figuratively, these are the proof for the aggregation of atoms; creation and destruction are in fact in Vaiśeṣika, the composition and decomposition of the infinite and unique particularities that at one stage formed a whole.

[^246]: effect is the ‘mark’ of the cause. 

[^247]: ‘specificity’ or ‘particularity’ is an eternal quality of the substances; it is eternal by its inherence in the substance, such as pṛthaktva demonstrates the pre-existential plurality of one substance, say, ātman. 

[^248]: if substance has particularity as its intimate nature, then it would be absurd to deny the permanent nature of particularity too; particularity does not seem to be extrinsic to substance but is rather part of the substance. 

[^249]: in Vaiśeṣika, cognitive comprehension is possible even in the case of essence-substantiality; this view agrees with Aristotle but disagrees with John Locke; see Copi 1970: 292–300. 

[^250]: here rūpa is translated as ‘appearance.’

[^251]: atoms do not have substances, but substances have atoms; atoms are minute and separated entities, and since they are defined by ‘antyaviśeṣa’ they cannot repeat like 

{{141}}

***4.1.3. existence of the effect is indeed due to the existence of the cause***

from causes such as thread, and so forth, \[there is\] the production of an effect, say cloth and so forth, which is because the effect is being preceded by cause, \[which we understand\] from the inferential marks of the product of the cause. 246

***4.1.4. impermanence is the negation of the particular existentials247***

when it is said indeed that ‘all effect is impermanent,’ then what is known is that some cause is permanent because of the negation of the permanence of particularity of a specific effect. 248

***4.1.5. and \[this negation of particularities\] is a false knowledge***

invalid knowledge is the non-comprehension of atoms because they are beyond senses, moreover it excludes \[the perception of\] impermanence; if an object is not seen, in what way can its impermanence be comprehended? therefore, impermanence is impossible to define; if \[asked\] how there can be comprehension \[at all\]? 

***4.1.6. comprehension \[of particularities\] is in respect to ‘shape’ ,  
boundless \[extension\], multitude \[of number\], and essence249***

comprehension takes place regarding substance due to the inherent boundless size, due to many substances inherent as a cause and because of the appearance250 

such as white, and so forth; how is it so? because of \[the following\]

***4.1.7. if \[a substance\] has no essence, no comprehension  
of \[their\] atoms \[will be possible\]251***

even though atoms have ‘form-colour’ due to the absence of an inherent cause, the 

substance,252 there is no comprehension of them \[the atoms\]

qualities as to form a ‘lower generality’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\); even though there are combinations of say, atoms forming one large reservoir of water \(see Praśastapāda’s Bhāṣya 

\[57–9\]\) where we have a discussion about the formation of the atoms of the most subtle substance vāyu, which through a process of atomic composition \(dyads, triads\) form the ‘great air’ \(mahān vāyuḥ\); then, through the same mechanism, Brahmā brings into a similar composition the formation of the ‘great reservoir’ of water \(mahān salilanidhi\), then the ‘great mass of fire’ \(mahāṃs tejorāśiḥ\), and so forth. 

[^252]: VSc 4.1.7 incidentally gives the definition of what Vaiśeṣika means by dravya, namely 

‘an entity’ which must have ‘generic essence’ as well as ‘particular essence’; although atoms have ‘particular essence’ they do not have ‘generic essence,’ therefore taking them separately from the mahābhūtas, atoms are not complete dravya because they lack the second fundamental characteristic of substance, namely ‘generic essence.’

[^253]: Candrānanda differs from the broader Vaiśeṣika tradition – which maintains that trayaṇuka can be perceived; see VSc 7.1.15, where the same view about the non-comprehension of tryaṇuka is re-asserted further. 

[^254]: ‘inherence of particularity’ in a substance and subsequently in many substances explains why – from an ontological point of view – particularity \(viśeṣa\) is co-extensive with universality \(sāmānya\); in other words, how the smallest is the grandest; if 

{{143}}

***4.1.8. non-comprehension of ‘air’ is because it lacks ‘impetus’ of ‘form’***

non-comprehension of ‘air’ is because it lacks ‘impetus’ which is called ‘form-colour’ in respect to the reality of the boundless and multiplicity of substances; it is established on the basis that the non-comprehension regarding the atomic 

triad253 is due to the conceptualisation of the particularitiness of substances’ multiplicity; what about ‘form-colour’? 

***4.1.9. \[but\] comprehension is possible when an essence subsists in many  
substances due to the \[intuitive perception of a\] specific form254***

comprehension \[of whiteness\] is due to a co-existence of the quality in \[a\] 

pot and so forth, which is a gross substance inherent in many substances, and because of a specific ‘form’ which is called ‘rūpatva,’ and which is a ‘universal 

particularity.’ 255

***4.1.10. in this way, the ‘cognition’ of ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’  
and ‘touch’ has been explained \[too\]***

by this \[above-mentioned logic\] the comprehension of ‘taste’ and so forth, is possible due to \[its\] co-existence in substance having many substances, and because of the universality and particularity of taste ‘rasatva’ and so forth. 

***4.1.11. \[inherence with substance\] is necessarily \[even\]  
when these \[qualities\] are absent256***

if there is non-comprehension of the atoms of colour inherent in one and many substances, nevertheless, perception is \[possible\] due to the transfer-concomitance which is the inherence of colour in one essence with many substances. 

***4.1.12. ‘numbers,’ ‘dimensions,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’  
‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ and motion  
are perceptible by \[the\] eye because of \[their\] transfer-  
concomitance in a substance which has ‘form’***

‘rūpi’ indicates a particular ‘form’ and it is by this that the comprehension of the things which are visualised by eye is possible, through the jointness of inherence 

\[of colours in things\] due also to the ‘particular universality’; why? 

the smallest is known, then the grandest becomes capable of being known as well, the 2 concepts being in a way synonymic. 

[^255]: quality and specificity of quality are 2 distinct existentials; both can be perceived by a third existential called ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

[^256]: ‘violation of the rule’ is the one mentioned above.

[^257]: quality and its repeatability in many substances, is a concept that stands in close relationship with the reality of universals. 

[^258]: inherence cannot be understood without the ‘genera’ or the ‘lower universal’ 

\(sāmānyaviśeṣa\) and should not to be confused with the ultimate particularity \(antyaviśeṣa\).’

[^259]: Ganesh Thite: ‘because of the absence of that’ refers to the ‘absence of sāmānya and viśeṣa.’

[^260]: the use of the preposition ‘adhi’ in the compound ‘adhyātmano’ points explicitly to ātman as the subject of this soteriological state’ ‘-adhi’ \(which means ‘over’\) is used in a prepositional compound, a governing compound possibly, to mean, ‘with respect to the self’ ‘concerning the self.’ Whitney, pp. 511–12, section 1310b.

***4.1.13. \[but\] those \[entities\] which have no form, are not visualised by eye***

when they \[qualities\] are situated in other large substances devoid of ‘form-colour’ they are not known. 

***4.1.14. this way, all sense-perceptual knowledge in relation to  
qualities and \[their\] existentiality are explained***

just as the ‘form’ and so forth are \[qualities\] comprehended because there are 

inherent in one great substance and many substances,257 like \[for instance\] a ‘large’ 

is inherent with qualities, \[and\] because of a co-existentiality with colours, due their respective inherence, the qualities are both ‘existential’ and have ‘qualitiness’ which is comprehended by senses such as \[the\] eye and so forth, but in the absence of ‘particular universal’258 \[these qualities\] are not explained259 because this \[particular universal\] makes them comprehensible; like quality, motions are 

\[comprehended\] by inherent-cum-inherence \[type of\] relation.

now concerning those products related first and foremost to the ‘embodied soul’260 

which have been mentioned, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***4.2.1. \[soul\] cannot be known from the group of 5261*** *** because the relation  
between the perceptible and imperceptible \[entities\] is imperceptible262***

\[objection\] the body is formed by the group of 5 elements,263 \[but\] as ‘air’ is not perceptible, \[only\] the group of 3, ‘earth’ and so forth is perceived, for example the relation \[between\] the 2 is not seen \[either\], thus the body would not be perceptible because \[it\] is made by perceptible264 and non-perceptible265 \[elements\]; but because of the perceptibility, we think that \[the body\] is not made from the group of 5 elements; \[response\] this not so, \[the embodied self\] is made by 3 perceptible \[elements\]

[^261]: ‘the group of 5’ refers to the 5 mahābhūtas, among which one needs to differentiate between those mahābhūtas that can form corporeal bodies \(śarīra\). See Garbha Upaniṣad \(Section 1\) edited by Paul Deussen, 1997. 

[^262]: saṃyoga \(usually rendered as a ‘conjunction’\) is indeed a quality, but its use must be read in broader grammatical terms, hence the translation as ‘relation’ and not ‘conjunction.’

[^263]: This is the view expressed in Garbha Upaniṣad ed. Deussen 1997: 639. 

[^264]: ‘perceptible elements’ are ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ and ‘lustre.’

[^265]: ‘non-perceptible’ elements are ‘wind’ and ‘vacuum.’

[^266]: ātman refers here to the embodied ‘soul,’ and, as such, it is intimately related to the 5 mahābhūtas; their cohabitation may form an inherent relation. 

[^267]: each class of atom corresponds to a region. 

[^268]: knowledge of the cosmos at its most subtle level through the ‘ultimate particularity’ 

\(antyaviśeṣa\) is obtained by a ‘specific dharma’ that is born by the intellectual practice of yoga; to know the ‘specific dharma’ of each and any single entity, is an instrument

\[response\] if \[you say that\] a product generates from ‘earth’ ,‘water’,‘lustre,’ and so forth, and from various ‘forms’ and effects, other qualities and shapes are produced, \[then\] that it is not so; for although we comprehend \[the qualities\] ‘shape’ 

of a thing made of earth and so forth, nevertheless \[a product\] is not 3 fold \[only\]. 

***4.2.3. because the mutual connection of 5 \[elements\]  
with ‘soul’ is not excluded266***

by the word ‘ātman’ \[Kaṇāda\] refers here to its own nature, and by means of it, the mutual connection between the 5 elements is not denied because it does not produce any \[new\] body; in the body made of ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ and so forth, \[these\] 

are connected but not inherent; \[for example\] the worlds of Varuṇa and so forth is made of waters and so forth \[elements\] which produce bodies \[accordingly\], but these are not \[bodies\] born out of a womb; why? 

***4.2.4. because \[it is understood\] from the previous \[sūtra\] that there are

atoms have many \[corresponding\] regions, of these, some of which are produced from moisture, but they are not of the nature of semen and blood; and \[regarding\] 

that, \[Kaṇāda says\]

atoms which depend on a ‘specific dharma’268 produce a body, but not the semen and so forth; \[if you ask\] how is it that those who possess dharma can have a body made of semen and so forth? \[then the response\] is the following

***4.2.6. \[dharma produces a body\] because of a particular effect269***

since there exists a body called mot and so forth due to their specific karmic activity, we think that these \[bodies\] are not born of a womb; and because of this 

\[reason\]

***4.2.7. \[bodies are varied\] because have a \[specific\] designation***

because of appellation like ‘Aṅgira born of coals’ we think that there are \[bodies\] 

non-womb born; why? 

and prerequisite for ultimate knowledge and absolute liberation; in this gloss, the formation of the body is made by a ‘specific dharma’ \(dharmaviśeṣa\), which presumably varies from a being to another.
