[^1]: I have amended the compound conventions printed by Muni Jambūvijayaji and decided to follow instead the advice of Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen by keeping compounds united \(guṇa and vrddhi\) and elsewhere to apply word division, however, possible inconsistencies may occur. Since the gloss is too brief, I have decided not to capitalise the beginning of sentences in either transliteration or translation. For variant manuscript readings, I recommend a comparison between Jambūvijayaji’s footnotes and other valuable contributions of new manuscript readings by Harunaga Isaacson \(in his PhD unpublished thesis, 1996\) and Ferenc Ruzsa, whose ‘critical edition’ and transliteration on [VSc is available online \(academia .e du\). ](http://dx.doi.org/academia.edu)

[^2]: this is one of the several alternative names by which Kaṇāda, the founder of the Vaiśeṣika system is mentioned in Sanskrit literature; others include Ulūka, Kaṇābhuj, and Kāśyapa. Kaṇabhakṣa may be translated as the ‘atom-eater.’

[^3]: it may refer to the question of whether upahataśarīra refers to liberation during the lifetime \(jīvanmukti\) when ātman has a body.

***1.1.1 now, therefore, we shall explain dharma***

a certain brahmin dedicated to the Vedic practice \[having\] fallen away from \[all\] 

impurity \[he\] was now struck by a Vedic sentence: ‘feelings of pleasure and pain cannot touch one without a body at all’ \[Chāndogya Up. 8.12.1\]; then, having pondered on this sentence, he went to Kaṇabhakṣa; 2 therefore \[he\] said: ‘Oh, Blessed, by this sentence it is indicated that the means for release belong to the one who is afflicted in body’; 3 so, tell me, what is the means \[for it\]? then, the sage responded: Dharma4 is; then the brahmin went on: what is Dharma? what are its defining marks? what are the other means for its achievement? what is 

\[its\] purpose? and whom does it benefit? now, regarding the explanation about the definition of Dharma, following these questions, the ‘atha’-word indicates 

\[a discussion to follow\] afterwards; likewise, the word ‘ataḥ’ indicates that \[the teaching\] is imparted, therefore, \[only\] to a pupil endowed with such qualities: 

‘detachment,’ ‘ability to address questions’, ‘intelligence’, which explain the grounds \[for achieving dharma\]; therefore, whosoever \[pupil\] is gifted with \[such\] 

qualities, following the questions raised \[by him\], consequently to such a pupil, we shall afterwards explain Dharma; \[on the question of\] what is Dharma, thus 

\[Kaṇāda\]5 replies –

[^4]: due to the many turns this concept takes, in this gloss it refers to Dharma – spelt with a capital ‘D’ – which is the ‘unified knowledge,’ the ‘soteriontological’ teaching that liberates man from all shackles of cosmos and ignorance; given that there is a whole variety of dharmas that characterise the entities in the cosmos, as well as the cognitive functions of the soul and mind \(see VSc 1.1.5\), Dharma with a capital letter would designate the ‘knowledge and the sum of all infinitesimal dharmas as expounded by Vaiśeṣika philosophy.’

[^5]: ‘iha’ translated sometimes with ‘it says’ or ‘he says,’ whereby ‘he’ refers to either Candrānanda, the author of the commentary, or Kaṇāda the author of Sūtrapāṭha \(Vaiśeṣikasūtra\).

[^6]: ‘abhyudaya’ refers to both ‘worldly and outwardly elevation,’ ‘heaven,’ or ‘mundane elevation’; it is a cosmic concept and should not be confused with the irreversible state of liberation \(mokṣa or niḥśreyasa\). 

[^7]: ‘niḥśreyasa’ represents the ‘absolute state of liberation’ in Vaiśeṣika, which is the ontological state of the ‘soul’ devoid of its ‘specific qualities’; VSc 1.1.2. is the gloss that seems to summarise such an irreversible state: ‘niḥśreyasamadhyātmano vaiśeṣikaguṇābhāvarūpo mokṣaḥ’ \(‘salvation is liberation of the nature of ātman devoid of \(its\) specific qualities’\). 

[^8]: ‘loka’ in Vedic cosmology is an unstable dwelling region, room, or cosmic or heavenly layer, where the subtle selves go as a result of a righteous life spent on earth; different from liberation \(niḥśreyasa\), loka is an impermanent state \(associated with elevation 

‘abhyudaya’\), therefore, those who wish to conclude their existence have the option of aspiring to niḥśreyasa. 

{{55}}

***1.1.2. Dharma is that from which there is achievement  
of elevation6 and liberation7***

because activities such as ‘sacrifice,’ ‘oblation to god,’ and so forth, which are brought about with ‘ghee’ and ‘flowers’ and so on, dissolve at the very time of their execution, and because they are unable to bring \[dharmic\] fruits at a later time, therefore, dharma is that \[instrumental quality\] out of which both elevation and liberation arise, thus one should understand \[it\]; elevation is the removal of sorrows and the achievement of a desired body in \[a\] world of Brahmā and other intermediate heavens; 8 liberation is mokṣa whose nature lacks \[ātman’s\] own specific qualities; thus, if you asked by which characteristic marks Dharma is known, 

\[then the response would be\] from the sacred texts; \[about\] how authoritative are these? \[he\] says –

***1.1.3. the authority of sacred texts is because \[these\]  
represent the speech of ‘that’9***

‘tat’ refers to Hiraṇyagarbha, the Great Ṛṣi, and is \[identical with\] Bhagavān Maheśvara, 10 having been himself made from the golden embryo, thus it is described; the sacred-texts are established as authoritative means of knowledge because they have been stated by a righteous person \[Ṛṣi\] and these are true, since they have been uttered \[primordially\] by Hiraṇyagarbha; and Īśvara is the intelligent agent proved to be the creator of the effect-products, because the body, worlds, and so forth, are \[his\] products, just as the pot is \[in relation to pot-maker\] 

and so forth; having stated dharma’s own nature and definition,11 \[now\] we shall speak about substances, qualities, \[and\] motions, which are \[knowable\] through Dharma; there \[we\] are –

[^9]: scholars such as Frauwallner debated whether ‘tat’ refers to ‘god,’ ‘that’ as a previous something \(sūtra\), or somebody \(Kaṇāda ‘himself’\). The prevalent scholarly view has been that the Vaiśeṣikasūtra is atheistic in ambit, for god is a concept borrowed only later from the Pāśupatas. 

[^10]: the concept of god in Vaiśeṣika should not be read in the key in which Aristotle ‘unmoved mover’ left it \(Met 12. 6, 7, 9; Phys 7. 1; 8. 4–5; De Mot Ani 2–4\); we know that soul is unmoved by nature, but as far as the golden embryo is concerned, God in Vaiśeṣika has an intrinsic effect or action \(kriya\), a fact which draws it closer to Anxagoras’ view on Logos from which all logoi derive; logoi have been translated by ‘seeds’ by a later post-Aristotelian byzantine philosopher named Maximus the Confessor. 

[^11]: definition plays an important role in Vaiśeṣika, so much so that Praśastapāda’s nameability, existence, and knowability form an essential part of it; for a comparative look at Aristotle’s view on definition see An Post. 2.1–13; Top 1.5–6; Met 6. 4. 10–12; 8. 2.

[^12]: although ‘diś’ has been rendered here by ‘space,’ its meaning is broader as it often designates ‘direction’ as a different concept from ‘spatial location.’

[^13]: what is substance in Indian philosophy in general and in Vaiśeṣika in particular is a difficult question to answer and that is due to the eclectic list given by Kaṇāda; once again we must look into other traditions, for instance, Aristotle Cat 5; Met 7. 1, 16, 17. 

[^14]: substantiality is the essence of a substance and contains 2 sets of qualities: \(1\) a set of generic qualities that do not change \(sāmānyaguṇa\), and a set of qualities that are accidental and perishable \(viśeṣaguṇa\); this classification applies predominantly to abstract substances: time, space, soul, and vacuum; accordingly, one also needs to distinguish between ‘essence-substantiality’ and ‘existential-substantiality.’

[^15]: what does meaning mean in Vaiśeṣika? See also Aristotle Cat 1; De Int 1–4, 8; Top 1.15; Met 4.2.1003a33–b15. 

{{57}}

***1.1.4. ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ ‘air,’ ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’  
‘space,’12 ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ these are the substances13***

substances are connected with essence-substantiality; 14 ‘earth’ is connected with earthiness; and in likewise manner, there is the designation of \[water\] and so forth; \[as for\] the manner in which the meaning15 is \[being indicated\] in \[the sentence\] ‘only nine substances and no more,’ the meaning of this is because the word ‘iti’ is \[used\]; thus, substances are described; again, on the question which are the qualities? \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***1.1.5. ‘form-colour,’16 ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch,’ ‘numbers,’  
‘dimensions,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’  
‘proximity,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’  
‘volition,’17*** *** ‘aversion,’ and ‘effort’ are the qualities***

these 17 qualities \[beginning with\] ‘form-colour’ and so forth, have been mentioned here; \[but\] because of the ‘ca’-word \[other qualities must\] also be included: 

‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ ‘viscosity,’ ‘impetus,’18 ‘dharma,’19 ‘adharma,’ ‘sound’; these shall be discussed later at the right time; concerning how many motions are there, again \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^16]: ‘rūpa’ may be rendered by ‘colour’ and ‘form-colour,’ respectively, but other alternatives such as ‘shape’ and ‘figure’ are to be considered too, Halbfass 1992: 104; for a discussion on form in relation to substance and matter see Aristotle Met 7.7–9, 11, 17; 8.2–3; 9.7; 12.1–5. 

[^17]: ‘volition’ \(icchā\), which may be interchangeably translated with ‘desire,’ has been cho-sen in this context because it is an initial form of ‘desire,’ whereby ‘desire’ may be standing between the low level of propensity and the higher level of ‘effort’ \(which is another quality of soul\). 

[^18]: ‘impetus’ \(saṃskāra\) can be of several types; elsewhere it has been translated by 

‘mental impetus,’ but it can be a ‘cosmic impetus’ too, depending on the phenomena involved; like ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’ \(jointly designated with ‘adṛṣṭa’\), saṃskāra is a specific quality that plays at least a 2-fold role – mental and physical. 

[^19]: dharma, as the infinitesimal ‘quality’ of the substance \(soul\) should be analysed in relation to and distinct from Dharma as discussed in VSc 1.1.1.

[^20]: for a discussion about action at Aristotle, see EN 3.1–5; 6 2.4; 7.3; MA 6–7; De An. 

3.9–11. 

[^21]: the 6 categories are substance, quality, motion, universality, particularity, and inherence; the word padārtha occurs here for the first time in the commentary of Candrānanda; in Sūtrapāṭha, there is no indication about the number 6 but here the commentator seems to settle the matter; Categories in VSc may not have the linguistic motivation which Aristotle seems to have ascribed by his 10 categories \(see Cat 1–5, 6–9; Top. 1.9; Met 5.7; 7.1; An Post 1. 27.43a25–43\). 

[^22]: possible locations of the quotes about these injunctions could be traced in the Brāhmaṇas \(SB 8.16.51–52\), see, for instance, Maurice Bloomfield concordance. 

{{59}}

***1.1.6. ‘upwards motion,’ ‘downwards motion,’ ‘pressing,’  
‘expansion,’ ‘going,’ these are the motions20***

these motions should be seen as only 5; due to \[our\] perception of motion, \[and\] 

because of the conceptualisation of ‘movement’, the ‘rotation’ and ‘evacua-tion’ and so forth \[have been included too\]; substances, qualities, motions are enumerated; universality, particularity, and inherence will also be mentioned, because of their connection with ‘tat’-word; thus, the true discernment between the 6 categories, 21 their similarity and dissimilarity lead to seeing corruption in objects, \[and\] the detachment from these is the instrumental cause of dharma which leads to liberation; ‘he ought to sacrifice on an even ground’22 this \[injunction\] refers to the substance ‘earth,’ ‘he brings water downwards’ and so forth, each according to its type \[such injunction refers\] to the substances that produce the knowledge of dharma, \[and\] that is conducive to elevation; yet, regarding qualities, there are \[injunctions\] like: ‘he should immolate a black animal’ and so forth; \[while\] in relation to motions there are \[injunctions\] like ‘they thresh rice’ 

and so forth; and, as a result of the discernment23concerning substances, their similarity and dissimilarity, this is the cause of elevation and liberation, for which 

\[reason Kaṇāda\] explains universality24 \[first\] –

[^23]: discernment plays a crucial role in Indian philosophy, but also among the neptic fathers \(Canévet 2014\) for it is a tool by which man distinguishes the good and evil in abstract things and events that come under human senses; a concept that may be useful here is εὐδαιμονία on which Aristotle speaks several times: EN 1.1–5, 7–12; 10.6–8; EE 

1.1–5; 2.1; 7.3; Pol 7.1–3.

[^25]: on causes in Aristotle, see Phys 2.3–7; Met 6.2; Met 1; An Post 2.2; Met 5.2, 30. 

[^26]: notable are the new concepts, ‘reality’ \(sat\) and ‘eternity’ \(nitya\), respectively; when it is said that the whole ‘category of substances’ is ‘impermanent’ \(transitory\), Kaṇāda refers to the ‘state’ and ‘composition’ that the substances can take; when, for example, a substance earth exists in its atomic state, that is ‘permanent’ because the atoms cannot be further divided, but when the substance earth is in the state of a ‘pot,’ then obviously earth is ‘impermanent,’ ‘perishable,’ because the earth-pot is dissolvable. The same reasoning may be applied to the categories of qualities \(for example, the ‘generic qualities’ 

of the ‘soul’ are permanent, while the ‘specific qualities’ of the self are impermanent, and removable\); presumably motions \(as different from activities, kriyā\) may follow a comparable pattern, for it is said in the sūtra, that they too are ‘permanent.’

[^27]: substances that are composed of atoms, say the mahābhūtas \(earth, water, lustre, wind\), are composed of atoms and represent the chemical composition of various objects \(pot\), biological bodies \(jantu\), and cosmic phenomena \(e.g. thunder\). 

[^28]: order of substances as this emerges in the aphorisms \(sūtra\) is very important; for instance, when the commentator’s enumeration states ‘vacuum and so forth,’ readers should go to sūtra 1.1.4, where the substances are enumerated and see what other substances follow after it, for these too are included in the definition of Candrānanda. 

[^29]: when Nozawa translates ‘in a state of final whole,’ his understanding is probably that whatever exists as non-composite must be a ‘simple whole’; my view is that when a substance is said to be non-composite it means that it cannot be divided further, not that it is ‘simple whole’; the view of ‘whole’ as ‘simplicity’ is characteristic of Latin and Islamic views on ‘essence’; there are 2 concepts in Vaiśeṣika \(pṛthaktva and antyaviśeṣa\) that could prove that the ‘essence’ of a substance in its pre-existential state is both many and one, both ‘particularised’ as well as ‘holistic.’ The system argues, through a network of webs and connections, both the unity and particularity of the visible and invisible world. 

[^30]: By ‘one-distinctness’ \(eka pṛthaktva\), the commentator clarifies what pṛthaktva is, namely the ‘quality’ of an eternal substance that is exclusively ‘pluralised’ by a series of ‘infinite unique distinct entities’ \(antyaviśeṣa\). Distinctness is present not only at the ultimate, infinitesimal level, but at higher levels too, for instance, ‘double-distinctness’ 

\(dvipṛthaktva\) and so forth. 

{{61}}

***1.1.7. substance, quality, \[and\] motion, are not different  
when: they possess existentiality, impermanence,  
substantiality, and \[are subject to\] cause25*** *** and effect,  
and when they possess particular universal.26***

‘substance is real, quality is real, motion is real’ this \[sentence indicates\] that reality is a characteristic of all 3 \[categories\]; similarly, the other \[substances\] except for 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, are impermanent; except for atoms,27 ‘vacuum,’ and so forth 

\[time, space, soul, mind\], 28 these are similar in that they have essence-substantiality, and have inherent causality; to be product means to ‘be coming out of a non-existent,’ likewise \[the 3 categories\] are similar except for the eternal substances; the 3 categories \[also\] do not differ because they are causative \[in nature\] and \[are\] 

capable of engendering an effect, such as ‘earth’ and others which are the inherent cause of substance, quality, motion; \[correspondingly\] ‘vacuum’ and so forth are \[inherent cause\] of qualities, for instance, ‘mind’ is the inherent cause of \[the knowledge of\] qualities and motions of the substances when in their non-composite state; 29 as for the qualities ‘colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ ‘smell,’ cool-‘touch,’ ‘num-

ber,’ ‘dimension,’ one-’distinctness,’30 ‘viscosity,’ \[and\] ‘sound,’ \[these\] are non-inherent causes; 31 \[whereas\] ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion,’ 

‘effort,’ ‘dharma,’ ‘adharma,’ ‘mental creative energy’32 are instrumental-causes; 33 

‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ hot-‘touch,’ ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ velocity are both 

\[instrumental and non-inherent\] causes; non-causes are: ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ 

duality, double-distinctness, circularity, and so forth; motions are the non-inherent cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’; the aspect in which the 3 \[categories\] 

are indistinguishable is when they have a particular universality, and \[each of the 3 categories\] have generality; 34 once the similarity of the 3 categories is established, dissimilarity will be stated \[too\]; 35 hence, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^31]: the verbs ‘to be’ and ‘to have’ are not always clearly differentiated in Sanskrit, therefore, when it is said that such ‘qualities are non-inherent cause,’ it means that ‘they do not inhere’ in something or that ‘they do not have inherence in something’. 

[^32]: here Candrānanda seems to replace saṃskāra with bhāvanā, which is possibly a synonym for saṃskāra. For him, saṃskāra possesses 2 sub-guṇas called vega and bhāvanā; in Praśastapāda’s PD 85, however, we have what appear to be 3 different sub-guṇas \(vega, bhāvanā, sthitisthāpaka\), where bhāvanā ‘cognitive faculty’ is a sub-guṇa of saṃskāra that defines the ‘non-corporeal’ \(amūrta\) entities such as ‘ātivāhikaśarīra’ as referred to by Praśastapāda \(PD 359\). 

[^33]: these are the specific qualities of the soul, which ātman possesses while in the embodied state; when it is said that they are ‘instrumental causes,’ the commentator perhaps refers to their capacity to bind the pure ‘soul’ into the cosmos. They are the instruments for any activity that the soul undergoes. Soul by nature is motionless, ‘passive,’ yet it can be affected or polluted by ‘active’ forces, such as these qualities are. 

[^34]: the commentator argues that alongside universality and particularity there is genera too. 

[^35]: ‘similarity’ and ‘dissimilarity’ imply each other not only from an ontological point of view, but also from an epistemological point of view; in fact, ontology pre-exists and is the ground onto which the epistemology develops, and it is this stress that distinguishes Vaiśeṣika \(ontology\) from the Nyāya \(epistemology\) system.

[^36]: ‘has no support’ in the sense that ‘it does no longer make sense at all.’

[^37]: allusion is being made here to the theory of asatkāryavāda, which acknowledges the accumulation of something new due to the creative power of a substance to multiply or expand. 

[^38]: ‘wholistic’ means ‘to have parts,’ therefore, limitless, all-pervasive; it refers to a state of absolute ‘complex simplicity’ that is unaffected by the danger of composition and decomposition \(birth and death\), such as the intrinsic nature of the substance ‘soul,’ 

‘space,’ ‘time,’ ‘vacuum,’ and to a certain extent, the ‘atomic mind.’

[^39]: Thakur \(2003: 28\) translates: ‘two or more causes of similar characteristics, having finiteness, motion, colour etc. can originate the effect’; effect may refer here to the newly shaped substance, and to sum up, the substance can ‘produce’ other substance, only regarding its shape not its intrinsic nature; ‘activity’ and ‘effects’ are the appropriate translation for ‘kārya’ insofar as an effect is changeable and impermanent. 

[^40]: these are the ‘subtle substances’ that exist in their pre-existential, pre-manifested, and pluralised state, and can be perceived only by a form of induction that uses 

‘antyaviśeṣa’ as a factor for their real ontological and cognitive determination \(through a dharmaviśeṣa\).

***1.1.8. substances generate other substances***

if you maintain \[the existence of\] both a \[singular\] ‘substance’ and \[plural\] ‘substances,’ then one substance cannot generate the separate diffusion \[of a different 

substance\];36 because substances are inherent causes, and they can produce an effect that is different from their own nature;37 but the substances that are holistic38 such as ‘vacuum’ cannot produce \[another\] substance, \[but only those substances\] that have a similar class, or have 2 or many ‘forms,’ ‘concrete shape,’ 

‘motion,’ and so forth, cause the production of effects;39 and ‘vacuum’ and other 

\[substances\] are not of this kind; since ‘mind’ does not possess ‘touch,’ it is not the cause for \[another\] substance, for a holistic substance40 is imperceptible. 41

***1.1.9. and quality \[generates\] other qualities***

like the previous \[gloss runs\], quality is both dual and many; for example, the colour of thread is inherent in the substratum42 of the substance-cloth \[and\] cannot produce \[itself other\] colour\[s\] and qualities indistinguishable from its own 

\[substratum\]. 43

***1.1.10. no motion is known to set up \[another\] motion***

motion does not engender another \[motion\], we notice the cessation of the \[subsequent\] motion;44 the perception of substances which are devoid of motionness would be impossible, if motion engendered motions; 45 thus, certain substances are fabricators, and others are not like that; some qualities are \[the\] cause \[of others\], others are not the cause \[of others\]; motions are never the cause of motion, 46 this is a \[form\] of dissimilarity; concerning another dissimilarity, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^41]: Thakur \(2003: 28\) translates: ‘the mind, since it has no touch, cannot be the cause of a new substance and the final embodied substances are also found to be unable to originate a new substance, because the case of origination in this connection is not seen.’

[^42]: Thakur \(2003: 28\): ‘the qualities colour etc. of the yarn produce colour etc. in the cloth which is inherent in their substratum; the qualities of the yarn are not the same with the qualities of the cloth.’

[^43]: Vaiśeṣika stresses further the difference between substance and quality. 

[^44]: See VSc 1.1.2. where Candrānanda presumably maintains that the effects of some ritualistic motions cannot produce new karmic results at a later time. 

[^45]: To avoid ‘infinite regress’ \(groundless logics\), and in order to argue for the possibility of ultimate knowledge and liberation \(which is the ground or the static state\), the system denies the permanent multiplication of action; here a new reference is given to those substances that are ‘devoid of motion’ see VS 3.2.27. 

[^46]: motion has distinct reality, and the fact that it cannot produce another motion shows that what glue and amalgamate entities are the qualities: conjunction \(saṃyoga\) and disjunction \(vibhāga\) which are attached to substances \(e.g. soul\); this gloss draws attention to the ambivalent nature of substances and qualities.

[^47]: Thakur \(2003: 29\): ‘Candrānanda furnished the example of two individual fingers \[substance\] producing a unit \[substance\] of two fingers through “conjunction” where there is no contradiction between two substances. Some more examples have also been cited to show the non-contradiction between effect and cause. We can observe the simple application of the rule in the following fact: cloth cannot be contradictory to its cause, the yarns, i.e. cloth cannot destroy its yarns, and yarns also cannot be contradictory to its effect, cloth i.e. yarns also cannot destroy the cloth.’

[^48]: this gloss mainly describes the various types of ‘non-contradiction’ or ‘non-obstruction’ between a cause and an effect, which otherwise are connected by a union. 

{{65}}

***1.1.11. substance is neither obstructed by effect, nor by cause***

obstruction is destruction, suspension; at any rate, a certain substance and so forth cannot be obstructed by an effect, nor by \[any\] substance-cause \[be it\] inherent or non-inherent; when the substance finger is an effect that would produce 2 fingers united, 47 then the union produced with the motion of the motion, \[the effect produced\] does not obstruct the 2 fingers substances and also does not obstruct the inherent and non-inherent substance-causes; and similarly the inch does not obstruct the union between inherent and non-inherent substance-causes, or their relation; mind does not obstruct the substances in their ultimate wholistic state, when there are activities of qualities and motions; ‘vacuum’ and other \[substances\] do not obstruct the qualities because they are permanent and not obstructive causes.48

***1.1.12. quality is both \[obstructable and non-obstructable\]***

both cause and effect are both obstructable and non-obstructable; ‘form-colour’ 

and so forth are existential \[qualities\] as follows: they are not obstructed by both cause and effect in the state of substances utterly devoid of parts, in the atom, atomic dyads, and so forth; \[qualities\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] 

‘touch’ do not obstruct mutually when they are not the product49 of cause and effect \[process\]; when there are words like first, middle, and last, adṛṣṭa produces effects through the contact with speed50 and ‘effort’ in relation to a substance possessed by ‘touch’; while in the case of existential things51 ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion’ these are not mutually obstructed by cause-effect \[relationship\]; ‘cognition’ \[forms\] by a continuous ligature with a ‘latent impetus,’ with \[various\] adversities such as impressions in intellect, 

‘pains’ and so forth, thus is how \[things\] should be understood concerning their 

existential becoming.52

[^49]: bhutā is the existential of the ‘past tense form,’ a product produced a priori. 

[^50]: speed, which is a sub-guṇa of the latent impetus \(saṃskāra\) may refer to a ‘unconscious motion’ effect, whereas effort may refer to a ‘conscious effort.’

[^51]: Thakur \(2003; 29\): ‘now, where there is no cause-effect relation, we see some qualities contradictory to each other, such as “conjunction” and “disjunction,” “pleasure” and 

“pain,” “volition” and “aversion.”’

[^52]: the large taxonomy that the system develops around the concept of ‘obstruction’ 

\(virodha\) shows the Vaiśeṣikas’ urge to systematise the ontological ‘difference’ that characterises the whole of reality.

[^53]: virodha is sometimes translated as ‘obstruction,’ but in the context of vaidharmya, the scope of this daily lesson \(āhnika\) is to describe what is different \(vaidharmya\); the sūtra stresses the radical ontological difference that exists between ‘motion’ and ‘effect’ 

\(product\). For example, consciously throwing a stone into a pond is very different from the unconscious effect of the motion of pebbles. 

[^54]: Thakur \(2012: 29\) translates saṃskāra with ‘tendency,’ see the index for pravṛtti. 

[^55]: ‘prasaṅga’ has been generally translated as the ‘context of an earlier discussion,’ an argument previously discussed, either in the written text or in an oral taught lesson \(āhnika\). 

[^56]: ‘saṃskāra’ is translated as ‘latent impetus’ \(when it refers to cosmic events\) and at other times as ‘mental impetus’ \(when it is used in the context of mental and psychological laws under which ātman is submitted\). 

[^57]: Thakur \(2003: 29\): ‘the effects of motion are “conjunction,” “disjunction,” and tendency; among these three conjunctions alone and not “disjunction” and tendency can contradict the motion.’ Thakur adds the following commentary ‘if the motion were contradicted by the other two, “conjunction” could not appear.’

{{67}}

***1.1.13. motion is contrary53 to effect***

among activities there are ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘latent impetus,’54 \[but\] 

motion is antithetical only to ‘conjunction,’ thus, it follows from this situation, 55 

that ‘conjunction’ is not produced, because ‘disjunction’ and ‘latent impetus’56 do 

not \[obstruct motion\]; 57 also another differentiation is –

***1.1.14. defining characteristics of substance are: to be  
possessed by activity, to be possessed by quality,  
to be an inherent cause \[of another entity\]58***

possessed by activity refers to that substance which has something inherent in it, 

\[and\] whose manifestation is exemplified by an effect caused by the first motion of an upwards motion, from this \[type of manifestation\] ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ 

‘soul’ are exempt; 59 that \[substance\]60 which has quality occurs in the manifestation as exemplified by a quality ‘form-colour’ and so forth;61 inherence, indicated 

by the word ‘iha’62 means \[that entity\] because of which \[these things\] happen which is the existential that is always united with, such as the sustainer is tightly united with the holded \[thing\], and that in which \[inherence exists\] is called inherent \[thing\]; cause is only that which is the cause of an inherent effect; in this respect, \[the concrete substances\] ‘earth’ and so forth represent the inherent cause of the 3 categories substance, quality, motion, \[while the abstract substances\] 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, represent \[the inherent cause\] of qualities; regarding \[substance\] ‘mind’ and those holistic substances \[are inherent cause of\] qualities and 

motions.63

[^58]: Thakur \(2003: 30\): ‘the characteristic features of a substance are that it becomes the substratum of motion and the substratum of quality and it becomes the inherent cause.’

[^59]: That ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and ‘soul’ are substances ‘devoid of motion,’ see VSc 5.2.23. 

[^60]: ‘guṇavat’ must refer here to a substance, see definition of substance in VS 1.1.14. 

[^61]: Thakur \(2003: 30\): ‘qualities are existent in each and every substance according to their capacity.’

[^62]: elsewhere ‘iha’ has been translated by the Latin idiom ‘hic and nunc’ widely used in psychology. 

[^63]: discussion of this gloss demonstrates the classification of the substances in a tripartite taxonomy: \(1\) concrete substances \(the mahābhūtas\); \(2\) abstract substances \(‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ ‘soul’\); and \(3\) atomic substances \(mind and mahābhūtas in their atomic state\).

[^64]: ‘quality is cause’ only in a dependent manner; alternative reading: ‘quality does not become a cause without expecting another thing in conjunction and disjunction.’

[^65]: quality can become ‘cause’ only with the medium of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction,’ 

plus other quality, or qualities; the chain of specific qualities that cause the birth \(janman\) of a new body is a case in point, see VSc 6.2.17–18; one may further note how such specific qualities are arranged in doubles of duality, one quality presupposing a conflicting one \(dharma and adharma, icchā and dveṣa, ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ 

and so forth\)

[^66]: in relation to its capacity to act as a cause, motion is just the opposite of quality, because it is an ‘independent’ not a ‘dependent cause’ such as quality; it does not require something else in order to create something by the medium of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’

{{69}}

***1.1.15. defining characteristics of quality are these: to be dependent on  
a substance, not possessed by \[another\] quality, \[and\] not to be  
an independent cause without ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’64***

‘dravyāśrayī’ means to depend on a substance-substratum, ‘aguṇavan’ means to be devoid of quality; independent \[quality\] is that which is not a cause of \[another\] ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’;65 for example, the ‘conjunction’ between ‘vacuum’ and 2 fingers requires the \[subsequent\] production of 2 fingers when the ‘conjunction’ of 2 fingers and ‘vacuum’ must be done; the ‘disjunction’ and mutual ‘disjunction’ of fingers expect the \[subsequent\] destruction of the effect for the sake of the ‘disjunction’ of 2 fingers and ‘vacuum’; thus, the quality \[‘conjunction’\] becomes cause for 

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ only when it requires something else. 

***1.1.16. defining characteristics of motion are these: it has \[only\] one  
substance \[as its substratum\], is devoid of quality, and is an  
independent cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’66***

‘eka’ means that motion has one substance as a substratum, not two, or \[it means\] 

that there exists only one activity in the substance, this is how oneness of substance 

\[is being explained\]; ‘aguṇam’ means that motion has no qualities; motion is an independent cause in relation to ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction,’ this means that when 

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are about to happen, having separated their own substratum from another thing, when they are joined with another substratum, they are independent of anything produced \[and\] destroyed; another dissimilarity as well \[is\] –

***1.1.17. essence-substantiality is common ground to \[categories\] substance,  
quality, motion***

word ‘sāmānya’ is a synonym for ‘genera’;67 ‘earth’ and so forth are the common 

cause of the 3 \[categories: substance, quality, motion\]; the ‘vacuum’ and so forth are the common causes of qualities because in each substance there can be many qualities, therefore these \[essences\] are being the common cause of qualities; ‘mind’ 

becomes the cause of the qualities and motions in the substances which are partless. 68

[^67]: Candrānanda offers here a ‘general’ and ‘metaphorical’ exegesis; likewise, the following sūtra 1.1.18 refers to generality as ‘similarity’ and ‘repetition,’ not as commonness and identity. 

[^68]: ‘mind’ becomes the cause of qualities and motions in the substances that are partless. It is an important statement for understanding the theory of transmigration in Vaiśeṣika, as explained in VSc 5.2.14 and VSc 5.2.19; passages that explain how manas \(with the quality ‘effort’\) is instrumental in the formation of a new body; yet, elsewhere manas shares with soul several specific qualities such as saṃskāra, which is presumably responsible for the transformation of the ‘soul’ from its all-pervasive ‘partless state’ \(possessed by generic qualities only\) down to its ‘embodied state’ \(possessed by specific qualities too\).

[^69]: this sūtra follows the definition of the previous one, to be the ‘essence cause’ to the 3 categories. 

[^70]: the gloss refers to a snowball effect, whereby motion does not produce another action, but rather its role is to impact the dimension \(e.g. mahat\) of substances and qualities. 

[^71]: ‘substratum’ may refer here to substance and its essence; ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ can only change the substance \(seen as a substratum\) but not its ‘essence’ \(which is unchangeable\). 

{{71}}

***1.1.18. similarly, the quality is \[defined as common  
ground for the 3 categories\]69***

‘substance is conjunctive’ \[1.1.25\], so it is said \[in the sentence\] ‘from a conjunction with fire other qualities are produced’ \[7.1.5–6\] thus it is said, ‘motion in hand’ is because of a connection between ‘effort’ and soul’ \[5.1.1\], such sentences show that only ‘conjunction’ is the common cause of substance, quality, motion, and no other quality can be a cause; for example, motion happens when a ball of cotton becomes conjoined with a cotton in speed, then the 2 cottons come into existence as \[1\] substance, whose dimension being produced is called ‘mahat,’70 

similarly other qualities are being produced mutatis-mutandis. 

***1.1.19. motion is \[a common ground\] of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’***

motion is a common cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ because of its combination with a substratum after having been separated from its own substratum. 71

***1.1.20. because of being \[absolutely\] distinct72 there is  
no essence-ground among substances73***

if indeed motion were to cause another substance, then the existence of ‘conjunction’ after \[motion\] was made would not re-occur; by \[the sentence\] ‘motion is not cause for substance’ then we recognise only the comprehension of ‘conjunction,’ 

when motion does not exist \[therein\].74

***1.1.21. \[but\] motions are not like qualities \[because  
they cannot cause other motions\]***

motion is the cause for ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ impulse, \[and\] stroke \[and all are\] connected with ‘conjunctions’ in either their own substratum or another substratum, but ‘effort’ and the ‘unseen force’ \[are qualities that occur\] only in another substratum; as such, motion cannot cause motion’s own substratum because from an earlier discussion we know about substances that are devoid of \[intrinsic\] activity; nor does motion reside in another substratum, because it ceases to be in conjunction with ‘tat’; therefore, motion is not the cause for motion, because motions are different from qualities which are the causes of motion; another differentiation is –

[^72]: substances are ‘absolutely distinct’ because of the category of viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa, which characterise their intrinsic nature. 

[^73]: ‘motion may not be common cause to substances’ because some of them \(‘soul,’ ‘time,’ 

‘space,’ ‘vacuum’\) do not possess intrinsic activity. 

[^74]: although ‘conjunction’ and ‘motion’ – as we have seen in 1.1.16 – are dependent, they do not overlap, and must not be confused with each other; one happens, the other does not.

[^75]: ‘common effect’ refers here to the repeatability of a substance, its capacity to extend, or create a ‘universal,’ ‘commonness,’ or ‘generality.’

[^76]: more importantly for the understanding of the ‘philosophy of difference’ is the following fact: that number is a quality that begins only from the digit ‘2’ onwards, which means that it is not to be confused with either digit ‘one’ \(zero\) or ‘1’ \(the unit\), which are not counted as numbers, but are rather different concepts altogether. 

[^77]: the quality ‘number’ is being analysed as different from the concept of ‘oneness’ and 

‘unit,’ namely by looking into the ‘general causality’ \(resemblance\) that exists between various ontological categories, and to show, in fact, the difference between the categories. 

{{73}}

***1.1.22. one substance is a common effect75 of \[many\] substances***

common effect \[causality\] is like the cloth \[being the effect\] of threads, where a substance shares an essential-genus with either a substance, 2, or many substances. 

***1.1.23. ‘numbers’ beginning with duality76 \[onwards\] have  
‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’77***

‘dvitva’ is the common effect of duality of substances, ‘tritva’ is \[the common effect\] of triad and so forth; similarly, in the case of dual ‘distinctness,’ and so forth; ‘conjunction’ takes place in the combination between 2 substances; ‘disjunction’ is after separating the duality \[of substances\], \[and\] because these subsist in many78 \[such qualities presumably\] have ‘commonality.’

***1.1.24. common motion is not known to have effect because  
of the non-inherence \[of motion in substance\]79***

because there is negation of co-existence of one motion in many substances, there is no common motion in 2 or many substances. 80

***1.1.25. substance \[is subject to\] conjunctions***

cloth is \[the common effect\] of thread conjunctions; a common effect refers to a substance whose conjunctions are an inherent cause of 2 or many \[substances\]. 

***1.1.26. ‘colour’ is \[is subject to\] colours***

such as the potsherds’ colour is from the colour of a pot, the common effect is the colour which has the substratum of 2 or many substances, colour \[being both\] 

cause and effect, thus \[other qualities\] ‘taste’ and so forth are \[explained\]. 

[^78]: the qualities mentioned subsist in many substratums, substances, or essences; if qualities have ‘commonness’ it follows that they can form ‘universals’ just as substances do. 

[^79]: there is a difference between motion and quality, the former being transitory while the latter being permanent – such a difference being translated in respect to ‘common effect’; it is partly due to the fact that while qualities can repeat themselves, thus able to form a ‘universal’ or ‘generality’ \(e.g. redness\), motions are always successive, thus transitory, and cannot form a ‘permanent whole.’

[^80]: there are substances that do not have intrinsic activity \(VSc 5.2.23\); if substances had intrinsic activity, they would be dissolvable as a result, but motions cannot have other motions inherent in them because they are units, and successive in motion, not simultaneous.

[^81]: ‘upwards throwing’ motion is caused by all 3 qualities mentioned. 

[^82]: gloss gives here the metaphor of the ‘beams of sun on a mountain’ to illustrate the haphazard movement of the beams, which presumably do not follow the usual pattern of the law of gravity; in other words, the movement is caused, not a cause of something else. 

*Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 75

***1.1.27. ‘conjunction,’81*** *** ‘effort,’ and ‘weight’ are \[the  
effect-activities\] of ‘throwing upwards’***

when the beams of the sun having no ‘weight’ \[are seen\] on a mountain, 82 and 

this \[in another example\] is because of the absence of ‘effort’ of mud-clay since it is not connected with a hand, \[then\] there is no ‘throwing upwards,’83 therefore 

‘throwing upwards’ is a common effect of ‘weight’ and so forth. 

***1.1.28. ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are \[the effect-activities\]  
of motions***

whatever ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are produced from both types of motion these are the common effect of motions. 

***1.1.29. as far as essential cause is concerned, it has been stated that  
motion is not the cause of substance or \[other\] motion***

in the discussion where the common cause of substances and so forth is described, it has been said that motion is not the cause of \[other\] substances and motions, therefore these \[substances and actions\] do not become a common effect of 

\[motion\] either; in this way, substance, quality, and motion are established to be 

variegated84 \[in nature\]. 

**// the first lesson of the first chapter //**

[^83]: a second metaphor given is how the blisters such as ‘lump’ can emerge, say on the skin, without having been triggered by scratching; thus, as in the previous metaphor, the upwards movements are triggered by different separate causes; Thakur \(2003: 33\) translates the simile on ‘loṣṭa’ as follows: ‘and as there is no “conjunction” between pebble and hand, there can be no throwing up of the pebble.’

[^84]: ‘nānā’ should not be translated by ‘numerous’ for this would imply number; it should, perhaps, be translated with ‘pluralised,’ ‘variegated,’ because several items can exist as identical, whereas ‘nānā’ refers to difference or uniqueness of identity.

[^85]: as the gloss will make clear, the cause is prior and more important than the effect, and can exist independently, whereas effect is secondary and has dependent existence \(due to asatkāryavāda theory\). 

[^86]: the 3 categories referred to are ‘universality’ \(sāmānya\), ‘particularity’ \(viśeṣa\), and 

‘inherence’ \(samavāya\). 

[^87]: if these real categories are dependent on mind and cognition, the philosophical question that arises is actually to what extent these categories are real; are these compositional elements? Balcerowicz suggested that they should not be equated with mental objects as Brentano might have suggested; in my opinion, here we are dealing with ‘dependent existentials,’ see Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra’s notion of antyaviśeṣa, as being real, yet possessing, nevertheless, only a ‘dependent reality’; this translation has drawn a distinction between cognition and knowledge; on knowledge in Aristotle see Met 13.10.1087a10– 25; De An 2.5.417a21–9; on identity and unity De Int 2; Top. 1.7; Met 6.2; 10.1.

**/ the second lesson of the first chapter /**

***1.2.1. absence of the effect presupposes absence of cause***

the 2 words ‘kārya’ and ‘kāraṇa’ have been previously explained, \[now\] he examines \[their\] meaning; in the absence of that thread and so forth, the substance as an effect say cloth and so forth is inherently caused either because of a ‘conjunction’ 

or because of an inherent cause; when the cause dissolves, the cloth and so forth dissolves \[too\]; effect \[on the contrary\] is of a different kind. 

***1.2.2. but the absence of effect does not \[presuppose\] the absence of cause85***

again, the non-production of a garment’s ‘conjunctions’ is not because of the non-production of a substance thread and its ’conjunctions’; having stated the association between the 3 categories, universal, and so forth, 86 therein \[he\] explains the universal. 

***1.2.3. universal and particular depend on a ‘cognition’87***

different cases of sacrificial piṇḍa as deriving from the ‘bull-bulls’ sequence are depended on \[Vedic\] knowledge and does occur in the reciprocal differentiation between ‘this one is other than ours’ which is \[the kind of reasoning that\] universality requires an ‘inclusive cognition’88 while particularity depends on an ‘exclu-

sive cognition.’89

***1.2.4. ‘existence’90 is only a universal***

‘existence’ is ‘reality’ and is only universal because it occurs in the 3 categories, substance and so forth, this is not \[to be confused with\] particularity. 

[^88]: ‘anuvṛttibuddhi’ implies repetition, hence the possibility of knowing the repetition of a quality ‘red’ in many substances; as such, it can grasp the reality of the lower universal 

‘redness’; Thakur \(2003: 35\) says that ‘anuvṛttibuddhi’ is the type of cognition of “this is a cow,” \[identical with\] “this is a cow,” in different cases, and the nature of this very knowledge of inclusion is that it is repeated in like manner.’ The question of repetition and difference has been a difficult topic in Western philosophy beginning with Duns Scotus up to modern times with Gilles Deleuze. 

[^89]: ‘vyāvṛttibuddhi’ on the other hand, implies non-repetition, identity, and focuses on what is unique, hence the designation of ‘exclusive cognition’; it is the analytical characteristic of the human brain to identify ultimate particularities and exclude ontological repetition; it is associated by mutual complementarity with ‘anuvṛttibuddhi,’ in the same way as sāmānya and viśeṣa are. 

[^90]: in this context, ‘bhāva’ can translate with both ‘reality’ and ‘existentiality’ \(a state, or a condition, respectively\).

[^91]: in Sanskrit there is often no clear indication between ‘have’ and ‘be, are’; nevertheless, sometimes ‘have’ is indicated by the suffix ‘vat.’

[^92]: to have ‘universal’ and ‘particular’ means to possess a ‘lower universal’ which designates a ‘genus’ or ‘genera,’ which, in Vaiśeṣika scholarship, is designated by one single term ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’; thus, 3 concepts are here: universality, particularity, and universal particularity \(lower universal, or species\). 

[^93]: in order to avoid infinite regress, or contradicting itself, the Vaiśeṣika system locates reality of an ‘entity in itself,’ in its own unique identity; some scholars translate this sūtra as ‘viśeṣas reside somewhere else’ \(other than the categories universal and particularity previously discussed\), this translation would put the reality of antyaviśeṣa under doubt; the sūtra draws a distinction between the category of ‘particularity’ and the ‘ultimate particularity.’

{{79}}

***1.2.5. substantiality, qualitiness, motionness, are  
\[or have\]91*** *** a universal particularity. 92***

inclusive cognition is that \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘substance has essence-substantiality’ in relation to ‘earth’ and so forth, it occurs in \[the expression\] ‘quality has qualitness’ in relation to colour and so forth, it occurs in \[the sentence\] 

‘motion has motionness’ in relation to upwards motion and so forth, these are 

\[all\] universals \[of\] substantiality, qualitiness, motionness, and are both mutual and exclusive ‘particularities.’

***1.2.6. ‘universal particularity’ exists except in the ultimate particularities93***

‘particularities’ are from particularitiness94 \[and exist\] through co-existence, in the eternal substances, ‘vacuum,’ and so forth, and atoms, and are the cause of the knowledge of ultimate difference \[as in the sentence\] ‘this one is different from that’ in relation to qualities having similar form due to illustrating this \[particularity\]; thus, particularity has been explained; but regarding ‘reality’ \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***1.2.7. ‘real’95*** *** is that which subsists in substance, quality, motion***

‘that because of which’ there is a ‘cognition’ of ‘real, real’ in the 3 differentiated 

\[categories\] substance, and so forth, that reason96 is ‘real’; if it is said that its destruction follows from the dissolution of \[its\] substratum, then \[the answer is\] 

no, because, 

***1.2.8. ‘reality’97*** *** is a completely other \[category\]  
than substance, quality, motion98***

since ‘reality’ is separate from substance, and so forth, therefore ‘reality’ is not destroyed when substance is destroyed, and so forth; as for the argument of substances as being differentiated \[from each other\] –

[^94]: ‘particularitiness’ may be equivalent to ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

[^95]: although ‘sat’ and ‘bhāva’ may be synonymous, for precision’s sake, in translation we shall differentiate between ‘real’ \(sat\) and ‘existential’ \(bhāva\). 

[^96]: ‘that reason’ refers to the difficult translation marked with commas in the gloss \(‘that because of which’\). 

[^97]: for ‘sattā,’ this edition proposes the translation ‘reality,’ for it is a broader concept than the nominal ‘sat’ \(real\). 

[^98]: this staunch realistic system builds upon the view that reality exists beyond the visible substances, qualities, and motions.

[^99]: although ‘bhāva’ and ‘sattā’ are slightly different concepts, the Sūtrapāṭha overlaps 

‘sattā’ with ‘bhāva’ by using them interchangeably; that is noticeable in this translation too, chiefly because the subject of the whole discussion here is ‘sattā’ \(VS 1.2.8\) while the subsequent sūtra replaces it with ‘bhāva.’

[^100]: obviously, reality cannot be confused with qualities and motion because their ‘existence’ is already there \(vartamānatva\); when it is said that ‘reality’ subsists in qualities and in motions, the system defines reality as ‘immanent’; in other words, reality is unfolding, and is not transcendent as in ‘idealistic’ or ‘mentalistic’ systems of thought. 

{{81}}

***1.2.9. \[reality\] is not a substance, because of the  
\[reality of\] oneness of substantiality***

because there is no substance-cause for \[another\] substance such as atomic-substances, ‘vacuum,’ and so forth, because of the connectivity between substance and an inherent cause, a pot, and so forth, has either one or many substances, 

‘reality’ again is comprehended in each of the present things, it has manifold substantiality, \[but\] is not a substance. 

***1.2.10. ‘reality’99 is not a motion, is not a quality,  
because it exists in quality and motion***

because no qualities occur in qualities, and no motions in motions, ‘reality’ subsists 

in qualities and in motion, \[therefore\] qualities and motions are not ‘realities.’100

***1.2.11. and \[reality\] is/ has no ‘universal particularity’101***

\[objection\] if ‘reality’ were one among substances and so forth, then ‘universal particularity,’ like in \[the universal\] substantiality, would occur in ‘reality’ too, 

\[such as\] substantiality, and so forth are; \[but\] this is not so; therefore, ‘reality’ is not a substance, quality, motion. 

***1.2.12. substantiality is stated as having one essence-substantiality***

such as substance is not ‘reality’ because \[this ‘reality’\] abides collectively in each substance, similarly substance is not essence because of the individuality of substantiality. 102

[^101]: apart from the ‘universal’ and ‘particularity,’ the system seems to acknowledge the existence of a ‘middle reality,’ namely that of ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\); while revising this translation, Thite insisted on translating ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’ as ‘universal and particularity,’ a view with which the author of these footnotes disagrees. 

[^102]: the fact that a substance \(air, lustre, water, earth\) has a reducible essence \(atoms\), as well as no continuous essence does not preclude its ontological status of substance; both abstract and concrete substances are to be considered substances; only their definition differs.

{{83}}

***1.2.13. because \[substantiality\] is no ‘universal particularity’103***

if ‘universal particularity’ subsisted in substantiality like something which has essence in substance, and so forth, the essence would be either substance, quality, motion; but essence is not \[the same as\] substance, and so forth. 104

***1.2.14. it is said that qualitiness exists in quality***

because of non-occurrence of qualities in \[other\] qualities, \[and\] ‘qualitiness’ 

occurs in qualities, therefore \[‘reality’\] is not a quality. 

***1.2.15. because \[qualitiness\] is/has no ‘universal particularity’105***

if qualitiness were either substance or motion, then there would be a ‘universal particularity’ existing in substantiality or motionness; \[but\] this is not so; therefore, qualitiness is neither substance nor motion. 

***1.2.16. it said that motionness106 is in motions***

due to the existence of motionness in motion, and because of the absence of motion in motion, motion is not motionness. 

***1.2.17. because \[motionness\] is/has no ‘universal particularity’***

if motionness were a substance or quality, then there would be substantiality or qualitiness in motionness, therefore motionness is neither a substance nor a quality. 

[^105]: ‘reality is only a universal’ or at any rate something that exists only in a ‘holistic,’ 

‘indivisible’ state. VS 1.2.13 and VS 1.2.15 insist on the same idea; the subject throughout these glosses is ‘sattā,’ but VS 1.2.13 sattā is not a quality. 

[^106]: ‘karmatva’ may be translated in this context as ‘capacity of activity’ but in order to avoid a confusion with kārya, which elsewhere has been translated with ‘activity,’ we shall now render ‘karmatva’ with ‘motionness.’
