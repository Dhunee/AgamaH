[^107]: ‘one’ \(eka\) refers to a substance state of ‘oneness’; yet, the concept is rather fuzzy, because although ‘eka’ is not a number, yet it is not clear whether the author refers to ‘oneness’ or a ‘unit’; it is also alleged that Kaṇāda may have referred to 2 marks: 

‘absent’ \(abhāva\) and ‘qualified’ \(sa\), respectively. 

[^108]: if there is a term that indicates the ‘essence’ of a thing, then ‘sattā’ may be taken to be one of the most powerful candidates; there are many possible translations for ‘sattā’ as 

‘abhinna’: whole, uninterrupted, undivided, unchanged, unbroken, not different from, integral numbers, unaltered; all substances have both an essential and differentiated state. In VSc 1.2.18, it refers to the essential nature of categories and substances. 

[^109]: the difference in defining something derives from the difference of the characteristic marks, which ultimately leads to the cognition of the ultimate differentiated nature of the substances and their essences. 

{{85}}

***1.2.18. ‘existence’ is one, because of the absence of a particularity of  
an existing sign, and because of the absence of a specific sign107***

word ‘eka’ indicates non-differentiation, but \[does\] not \[indicate\] ‘number’; the perception of mark, is that by which mark is indicated by the usage of liṅga indicated by \[sentences such as\] ‘sat sat,’ whereby ‘reality’ is recognised because of not being always differentiated, and since there is absence of conceiving the 

‘particularity,’ ‘reality’ has no differentiation.108

**// the second chapter//**


**/ the first lesson of the second chapter /**

thus, when the manifoldness of substances and so forth has been proved, and when the oneness of the earth and so forth is indicated, because of the indistinct definition of essence it is \[then\] said that there exists a differentiation because of the difference of defining characteristics \[of each substance\]. 109

***2.1.1. ‘earth’ has ‘form-colour,’110 ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch’***

concerning these, ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ are specific qualities, but the other \[qualities\]111 are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘weight,’ accidental-‘fluidity,’ 

\[and\] ‘latent-impetus’; ‘form-colour’ \[such as\] white and so forth, ‘taste’ \[such as\] 

sweet and so forth, ‘smell’ \[is\] fragrant, and repellent, while ‘touch’ has coldness and hotness when produced by cooking; and its activities are both external and internal \[as stated in 2.1.1\]. 

[^110]: translation of ‘rūpa’ with ‘form-colour’ is left to the discretion of the reader; in Vaiśeṣika context, the term has the potential to explain the ‘diversity-in-unity’ of a substance due to its intimate inherent relation with the substance; it can be translated as ‘shape,’ ‘form,’ and ‘colour’ depending on which substance and which sense-organ the context refers to; each quality usually corresponds to one particular sense-organ, and as Ganesh Thite pointed out, this relation between quality and sense-organ can be determined only if an initial perception has taken place. 

[^111]: by the locative ‘anye,’ Candrānanda refers to the list of ‘generic qualities’ 

\(sāmānyaguṇas\).

[^112]: Nozawa, 1993, says that the word ‘previous’ refers to the ‘previous substances’ such as earth and so forth have been explained in 2.1.1. 

[^113]: lustre is a substance that is more than fire, for it includes other intrinsic properties such as glow, golden shining, and many forms of light. 

[^114]: vāyu will be translated with ‘wind’ and ‘air,’ respectively, although ‘wind’ is a smaller category than the substance ‘air’ which encapsulates various ‘winds.’

[^115]: the expression ‘kāryam purvavat’ has been encountered already in several places; it sends the reader to the discussion of gloss VSc 2.1.1. where activities are said to be external and internal. 

{{87}}

***2.1.2. concerning ‘water,’ it \[has\] ‘form-colour,’  
‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ ‘fluidity,’ and ‘viscosity’***

‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch’ is like white, sweet, and cold; flowing means natural fluidity; viscid means viscosity of these \[waters\]; and ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ 

‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ 

and ‘latent-impetus’ \[these are the qualities of water\]. 112

***2.1.3. concerning ‘lustre,’113 it possesses ‘colour’ and ‘touch’***

‘form-colour’ refers to glittering and white, ‘touch’ refers to hot, only; and \[other qualities in relation to this substance are\] ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ 

‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; their activity is \[stated\] earlier \[as both external and internal, 2.1.1\]. 

***2.1.4. ‘air’114 has ‘touch’***

‘touch’ is not produced by baking, which is neither hot nor cold \[other qualities of ‘air’ are\] ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ 

‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; \[their\] activity \[is stated\] earlier115 \[in 2.1.1, as external and internal\]; the bodies belonging to earth 

and so forth subsist into the terrestrial worlds, and so forth.116

***2.1.5 these \[qualities\]117 are not known in relation to ‘vacuum’***

these \[qualities\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ do not exist in 

‘vacuum’; its \[other\] qualities are ‘sound,’ ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ 

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’

***2.1.6. fluidity of the earthly things like ghee, wax,  
honey, when in ‘conjunction’ with fire have  
common \[characteristics\] with ‘water’118***

‘madhūcchiṣṭaṃ’ refers to beeswax; whatever fluidity of ghee, honey, wax is produced from ‘conjunction’ with fire, that is common in earth and ‘water.’119

[^116]: as VSc 4.2. would clarify, there are cosmic layers, or worlds that have a different substantial or chemical composition: for instance, there is a world of fire or wind, and so forth; this is a Vedic cosmology to which Vaiśeṣika subscribes. 

[^117]: presumably ‘ta’ refers to the doctrine as regards the qualities and the substances discussed by previous sūtras \(‘earth,’ ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ ‘wind’\). 

[^118]: not only water, which makes clay and can be fluid and melting, but also earth and things made of earth, thus with a certain extent, water properties are common and similar to the properties of earth. 

[^119]: in other words, ‘fluidity’ is common to earth and water.

[^120]: all these metals, when in conjunction with fire, become lustre; therefore, fluidity is a quality that characterises them all. 

[^121]: ‘gotva’ is the essence of a bull. 

[^122]: ‘rump’ is the hind part of a mammal’s body or the lower back of a bird. 

[^123]: dharmaviśeṣa is the cognitive property that reveals the inner meaning and essence of the things, whereas words indicate the visible properties of things; in this way we understand both the essence and the feature of things; in Latin scholastic philosophy, we see a comparable theory of perception, known as individuation \(Duns Scotus\)’; in this gloss, ‘essence’ would be a universal \(e.g. gotva\), whereas the property would be, as Scotus indicates, the only thing that is known by our sense-perception; essence 

{{89}}

***2.1.7. lustry things: tin, lead, copper, silver, gold, possess common  
fluidity when \[they have\] a conntact with fire120***

because of a relation between fire and those which belong to lustre, because it relates to these, it follows that ‘fluidity’ shares a common nature with ‘lustre.’

***2.1.8. possessed by horns, possessed by hair at the \[tail’s\] end,  
possessed by dewlap, these are the visible marks of bullness***

the purpose of this sūtra is to exemplify; ‘gotve’121 aims to indicate an individual characterised by bullness; because it has horns, hump, and dewlap, \[bull\] is therefore called ‘viṣāṇī, kakudmān, sāsnāvān’ \[possessing horns, possessing hump, possessing hump\]; the word ‘prānta’ \[refers to\] a portion of rump, 122 hair is kept in 

it, therefore the word ‘vālā’ means tail; because there is a tail at the end, therefore a bull is described as ‘prānte vāladhiḥ’; by means of words it indicates things, but the indication of the inner meaning of things comes from dharma;123 concerning an individual bull which is not recognisable, its perception, for example, is from 

marks such as horn and so forth, which are those that cause \[us\] to infer it.124

***2.1.9. and ‘touch’ \[too, is a visbile mark of a substance\]***

because it is impossible to have something without a substratum, the comprehension of touch causes \[us\] to infer \[the existence of\] ‘air.’

***2.1.10. because \[usually\] visible things have ‘touch’, we cannot say  
that ‘air’ \[which is invisible\] is something which has marks***

if ‘air’ were indeed an object of touch like ‘earth’ and so forth, its grasp would go together with ‘smell,’ ‘taste,’ \[and\] ‘form,’ \[but\] this is not so, therefore \[touch\] is 

a mark of wind which is separate from earth and so forth.125

cannot be known directly, but qualities can; on individuation, see Aristotle Met 5.6.1016b31–5; 7.8.1034a5–8; 8.1.1042a26–31; 10.9.1058b5–12; 12.3.1070a9–13; De An 2.1.412a6–9; De Caelo 1.9.277b27–278b8. 

[^124]: perception is a mediated process, and that mediation comes through the perception of visible marks on the one hand, and from the perception of dharma properties that identify the nature of abstract things, on the other hand; likewise Duns Scotus, an abstract substance has not only an intrinsic essence \(unknowable\) but also an essence that has something added to it, which in the case of Vaiśeṣika is dharma. 

[^125]: Candrānanda wishes to distinguish the touch of wind from the touch of earth; each touch has its ‘particularity’ – its specific dharmaviśeṣa.

[^126]: there are atoms of wind, such as there are atoms of fire, atoms of earth, and atoms of water; all these 4 elemental substances differ from the abstract substances \(time, space, soul, and vacuum\) because these are reducible to a fragmented nature \(atoms\), by contrast with the latter abstract substances which are irreducible, for they cannot change substantially; Candrānanda indicates the difference between 2 types of substances by the sentence: ‘substance can be without substance and \[can\] have many substances.’

{{91}}

***2.1.11. \[air\] is a substance-essence because possesses immateriality***

‘air’ is that which has atoms126 as a ‘constitutive essence,’127 it exists because it is a 

substance devoid of an inherent cause and because it is not possessed by substantiality; substance indeed, can be without substance and \[can\] have many substances. 

***2.1.12. and \[air is a substance\] because has effect-activity and quality***

when the definition of substance says that ‘it has motion, possessed by quality’ 

\[1.1.14\] it means that \[substance\] has motion and quality inherent \[in it\], \[therefore\] that \[air\] is a large \[substance\]

***2.1.13. permanence \[of air\] is defined by \[its\] immateriality***

permanence is described by lacking an inherent cause, by not having substantial-

ity when ‘air’ is defined in the atomic \[state\].128

***2.1.14. wind-wind collision is the mark of \[air’s\] manifoldness***

because the collision of wind with a horizontal wind, there is a friction of wind whereby it goes up and then, because it is going up there is a collision, because of 

\[such a\] collision, the manifoldness of air is inferred; and now \[Kaṇāda adds\] –

***2.1.15. the visible mark of air is not known because of the absence of  
perception129 of air \[even when\] there exists a contact \[with air*** ***\]***

when for instance \[in the sentence\] ‘this is a bull,’ \[what you have implied are\] horns and so forth united with the perception which exists in the contact between bull and the eye, therefore these are sometimes visible marks, yet this is not the case with the skin when it is in contact with the air because the perception of this ‘air’ is grasped through the perception with that ‘touch’-quality, therefore, that which is comprehended as quality \[the comprehension\] may cause us to infer a non-comprehended 

‘air’; if it is said that \[this is so\] because of the absence of the substratum of this touch, this is due to it being different from the touch of earth and so forth, \[then\]

[^127]: svabhāva; in Vaiśeṣika there might be 2 terms to designate ‘essence,’ whereby svabhāva may indicate ‘changeable essence,’ whereas svarūpa might be ‘static essence’ \(equivalent to antyaviśeṣa, as Vādīndra defines\). 

[^128]: difference between permanence and infinity may be considered here; on infinity at Aristotle see Phys 3.4–8; De Caelo 1.5–7. 

[^129]: ‘perception’ refers to the 4-fold contact between ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ senses, and objects.

[^130]: one of the temptations of superficial and harmful knowledge is the obviation to the details; the Vaiśeṣika system is the exponent of an analytical mode of thinking where divisions and differentiation must be made prior to any form of generalisation; in this gloss, an opposing philosopher denounces Vaiśeṣika’s theory of differentiation by pointing out the visibility of the universal, but the Vaiśeṣikas do not deny the reality of the universal, they only posit that the particular is the ‘real’ lying at the foundation of any ontological description of reality. 

[^131]: The act of ‘naming,’ alongside that of ‘designation’ and ‘knowing’ occupies a major place in Vaiśeṣika. Praśastapāda speaks about the creation of mahābhūtas and the Great Egg that proceeds simply from Maheśvara’s act of 

{{93}}

***2.1.16. \[air seems to be\] indistinct because is seen generally130***

because ‘vacuum’ and so forth are imperceptible \[substances\], because of the negation of ‘air,’ this particular touch is not known from that which is perceived 

\[only\] generically; \[response\] if you say that there is an obstruction between touchability and all-pervasive beings \[vacuum\], how then do you know that ‘touch’ is established as that ‘existential’ which belongs to the elastic ‘air’ only, and is not to be \[considered to be\] a tenth substance? 

***2.1.17. therefore \[we prove air\] from tradition***

\[objection\] therefore, \[some\] declare that ‘air exists’ based on tradition and this subject is only a hearsay; \[but\] this is not so, 

***2.1.18. but \[air\] has been indicated by the act of naming131*** ***  
\[made by seers\] superior to us***

Great Lord is more superior to us, and so forth, due to his knowledge and so forth, the activity of giving names done by Him is the mark for the \[existence\] of the 9 substances;132 because the tenth \[substance\] is not named, therefore there are only 9 substances, and as a result, in the expression ‘superior to us’ the touch belongs to ‘air’ only, \[and the use of\] the plural form133 is for the sake \[of devotional\] glorification; on the question of how is that known, this is said –

naming \(maheśvarasyābhidhyānamātrāt\); as it is known, abhidhyāna is one of the 3 powers of speech, according to Praśastapāda’s PD 11: ṣaṇṇām api padārthānām astitvābhidheyatvajñeyatvāni; the ‘categories’ \(padārtha\), Praśastapāda informs us, have 3 major basic features: they possess existence ‘-isness’ \(astitva\), ‘knowability’ 

\(jñeyatva\), and ‘nameability’ \(abhidheyatva\). 

[^132]: in Vaiśeṣika, substances are 9 in number because they been defined by the Lord Īśvara.

[^134]: glosses VSc 2.1.18–19 elucidate the system’s philosophy of language, namely that language, even though it is sacred – for it derives from the Great Lord – yet it is arbitrarily designated by God and those superior seers who resemble Him; yet, VSc 2.1.19 says that ‘giving names’ is based on a prior perception; one may ask – if the Lord’s divine language is based on prior perception – is language in Vaiśeṣika eternal? 

[^135]: there is not sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that the origin of names and language is conventional and that meaning is ‘created’; the term used by the commentator here is ‘praṇīta’ \(past participle\), which means ‘given’ but that should not necessarily imply that such names have been ‘created’; ‘creation of language’ is not 

{{95}}

***2.1.19. \[the seers’\] act of naming is from a prior perception134***

observing the categories through direct perception, they \[the superior seers\] keep 

\[secret\] the names which have been seen when naming a child and when these names are given, therefore we think that there is a Lord who is superior to us who directly perceives the things which are not seen directly by us, and this naming is done by Him \[for\] He has seen all things directly \[even\] those things not directly seen by us, and He has instituted these names. 135

***2.1.20. marks of ‘vacuum’ are these: exiting and entering***

\[objection\] whatever departure and entry of a man that happens through the door, and so forth, not through the wall, and so forth, that is done by the ‘vacuum,’ 

therefore exit and entry are the mark of ‘vacuum’; 136 \[refutation\] if you say that 

‘vacuum’ means absence of \[something\] ‘concrete’ indeed; this is not so, 

***2.1.21. those \[2: exiting and entering\] are not the inferential mark of  
the \[vacuum\] because action subsists in one substance \[only\]***

act of exit and so forth which exists in regards to a man, for it is said that ‘motion has one substance’ and there is motionness of ‘vacuum,’ how is it that \[motion of exit and entry\] which is not in the ‘vacuum’ will lead to \[inffer vacuum\] since there is no connection \[between vacuum and motion\]; if you say that just as the act of falling which is sign of heaviness exists in cloth, in the same way, the exit of a man is the sign of ‘vacuum,’ then this is not so, 

***2.1.22. because of the difference \[of exiting and entering\]  
is coordinated with another cause137***

it is said that ‘weight’ is the non-inherent cause of motion, then, let it be inferred in the case of ‘vacuum,’ however, that it is not proper to say that ‘vacuum’ is not an inherent cause, because there is a difference between ‘vacuum’ as a permanent substance, and the absence of substratum of ‘vacuum’ concerning ‘weight’ and so forth, which is a non-inherent cause; 138 what has been said \[in the sentence\] ‘the exit by door and so forth’ that is caused by ‘vacuum,’ this is not so, 

one and the same with ‘arrangement of language,’ one is usually the work of a god, the other is the ability of a bard, poet, or seer. 

[^136]: in other words, the non-corporality is the intrinsic characteristic of ākāśa. Arena \(1987:92\) provides his own Italian commentary on VS, refers here to Sāṃkhyakārikā 

38–39. 

[^137]: the alternative translation: ‘“vacuum” is different in property because it results from another cause.’

[^138]: the difference between ‘weight’ and ‘vacuum’ is that while ‘weight’ is a non-inherent cause of motion, ‘vacuum’ is a permanent substance and is without substratum.

[^139]: the mark of ‘sound’ is not the mark of the entry and exit; ‘vacuum’ exists even inside the wall, not only in the door or the ‘space’ indicated by door; this is because ‘vacuum’ however little it might be, is all-pervasive – it is very minute as well as very large; like ‘soul,’ ‘vacuum’ – being all-pervasive – can pervade everything; for example, body cannot go through the wall, but ‘soul’ \[and ‘vacuum’\] does, because it is subtle in nature and all-pervasive means it can pervade the wall. 

[^140]: śabda stands in Vaiśeṣika not only for ‘sound’ as translated here, but for ‘word’ too. 

{{97}}

***2.1.23. absence of motion is because of a ‘conjunction’***

exit takes place in connection with \[the subtle\] body and so forth which is the substratum of motion and is connected with a tangible substance such as wall and so forth, and not because of the absence of ‘vacuum’ which because it goes everywhere exists there also \[in exit\], therefore ‘sound’ is the only mark of ‘vacuum’;139 

if you say that ‘sound’ is a quality performed by causes such as drum and so forth, the answer is no. 

***2.1.24. quality of a cause is seen prior to the quality of effect-  
product, \[thus\] sound has not other manifestation140*** ***  
because is not a quality of tangible things***

concerning the specific qualities of tangible things, these can be perceived by each corresponding sense-organ, \[and\] are perceived once the cause-effect production 

\[takes place\]; concerning qualities form and so forth, no portion of ‘sound’ is perceived in a certain section of the drum’s \[music\]; therefore, sound is not a specific quality previously produced by a cause \[such as\] the tangible drum and so forth; and the specific quality of a tangible \[substance\] is the proof of the cognisance of a product as long as it is effect of a cause; but141 ‘sound’ is not like this, therefore it is not a specific quality of tangible things;142 moreover, the specific quality of touchability is produced as long as the qualities exists as effects of a cause, and an effect is not when we see ‘sound’ being produced by \[another\] ‘sound’;143 as a result, due to the non-production of another effect, ‘sound’ is not a specific quality of something tangible. 

***2.1.25. because \[sound\] inheres elsewhere, because is perceptible,  
\[sound\] is neither a quality of ‘soul’ nor a quality of ‘mind.’ ***

‘elsewhere’ means it is ‘external’; those qualities of ‘soul,’ such as ‘pain’ and so forth are comprehended by many externally; a quality of the ‘soul’ is comprehensible by an external sense-organ, the \[sound\] however, is directly perceived by ear, therefore is not a quality of the ‘soul,’ consequently, due to eternal comprehensibility and because of the perceptibility through external sense-organ, \[sound\] 

is not a quality of mind; and due to the perceptibility through ear it \[sound\] is \[not a quality\] of ‘space’ and ‘time’; hence, being a quality, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^141]: particle ‘ca’ has been translated here with ‘but.’

[^142]: the commentary makes that case that ‘sound’ has its origin not in concrete tangible things; sound is a quality of the substance ‘vacuum.’

[^143]: this sentence ‘the specific quality of having touch is produced through the qualities of the cause once the effect is produced, and not when “sound” is produced by “sound” 

we see any effect being produced’ will be referred again by Candrānanda in the introduction to the āhnika VSc 2.2.

[^144]: ‘suchness’ \(tattva\) is that which exists temporally, and as such the sūtra equates it with ‘existence’; Heidegger once coined a specific ontological term, namely ‘the existential’ \(‘existenziell,’ the ‘what’ of a material ‘real’ is\), and refers to the entity that exists in temporality; it is worth asking whether this ‘suchness’ is equivalent with the 72 temporal dharmas as propounded by Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivāda \(Buddhism\) or the ‘specific quality of dharma’ which once extirpated, man acquires ‘liberation’; on existence in Aristotle, see Met 5.7; 7.1–2; De Int. 16b19–25, 21a18–33. 

{{99}}

***2.1.26. \[sound\] is a mark of ‘vacuum’***

because is being perceived \[sound\] causes \[us to infer\] ‘vacuum’. 

***2.1.27. immateriality and permanence \[of vacuum\]  
are explained by \[means of\] air***

just as air is permanent and is a substance due to its atomic nature, lacking possession of essence-substantiality, in the same way, ‘vacuum’ is also a substance and permanent because of the absence of anything that causes it. 

***2.1.28. by existence \[vacuum’s\] essence \[is explained\]144***

just as such an existence \[is proved\] through the particularity of proper mark and through the absence of a specific mark, in the same way, because of the absence of the mark of sound and because of the absence of specific mark, ‘vacuum’145 is one. 

**// this is the end of the first lesson of the second chapter/ /**


**/ the second lesson of the second chapter /**

it has been said \[in VSc 2.1.24\] that ‘a specific tangible quality is produced through the effects or qualities that originate from a cause, and that, each effect is produced like “word” is produced by “sound,”’ \[but\] that is not correct because a substance is not produced by another substance such as flower or a cloth is, however, the \[quality\] smell of flower originates in \[the case\] cloth, and such is the case of ‘heat’ in relation to ‘water’; \[hence\] it has been said –

***2.2.1. smell subsists in a contact between a flower and cloth, and does not manifest  
in another cloth \[because\] has no inferential marks of smell \[in that cloth\]146***

if you say that in the cloth connected with a flower no \[other\] smell is produced through the smell of \[a\] flower because we experience the smell of cloth also, 

\[then\] another smell different from both the flower-smell and cloth-smell would be produced, then this is not so, \[for\] we rather comprehend the smell of \[the\] 

flower alone, therefore \[to say that\] ‘smell is produced \[by another\] smell without the inception of an effect,’ this is wrong, because according to this argument, there would be another smell \[produced\]. 

[^145]: ‘vacuum’ is only one and like ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space,’ its ontological nature is not mixed, divisible, or composed, yet it can subsist in different shapes and states, and only in such states can it be said that it is varied and diverse; this explains the doctrine of one in many, but the many cannot form one; one that has complete essential ontological unity has oneness as its nature. 

[^146]: the specific smell of a flower on cloth proves that cloth has no smell, for smell belongs only to the flower, not to the cloth.

[^147]: Qualities are accidental and perdurant by contrast to substances, which are durable. 

[^148]: we do not comprehend the smell of the cloth – for cloth is made of earth – and because the smell of the flower is more powerful. 

{{101}}

***2.2.2. in this way, heat in ‘water’ is explained***

there is no specific ‘touch’ produced when ‘water’ is connected with ‘lustre,’ and regarding the absence of heat, the non-manifestation of touch which is variable is the proof that heat in water does not last as long as the parts of substance last;147 

because small particles of flower are transmitted in cloth and small particles of lustre are transmitted in ‘water,’ \[and\] because there are co-existent with something connected there, there is a comprehension of smell and touch; \[objection\] 

now, if you say that ‘colour’ and so forth do not exist other substances such as cloth and water, \[it follows\] then that the comprehension of smelling flowers and hot touch is at the same time with the recognition of smell of cloth and cold-touch, 

\[but\] this is not so, 

***2.2.3. ‘smell’ is invariably situated in ‘earth’ ***

although cloth’s own smell resides in the cloth which consists of earth, this is not comprehended because it is superseded by the smell of flower, 148 moreover, 

***2.2.4. heat \[is invariably situated\]149*** *** in ‘lustre’150***

heat is situated in lustre only, it does not pass over in ‘water,’ like when \[we\] 

apprehend heat. 

***2.2.5. coolness subsists in ‘water’***

because \[coolness\] has entered in the particles of ‘lustre,’ because of \[its\] co-existence with the joint thing, even though there is comprehension of heat, the coolness in water is not comprehended even if it is situated in the water dominated by heat; now \[he\] explains ‘time’ –

[^149]: Presumably here is locative; Candrānanda prefers using saptamī vibhakti a lot. 

[^150]: ‘lustre’ \(tejas\) as a substance is a broader concept, therefore, it should not be confused with ‘fire’ \(agni\).

[^151]: for what is time at Aristotle, see Phys 4.10–14. 

[^152]: latterness or subsequentness; the ability to form a chain or emerge randomly later in future. 

[^153]: description of ‘time’ goes hand in hand with that of ‘space’; in fact, time here is not time, but rather ‘space-time,’ close perhaps to what is discussed in the ‘relativity theory’ \(Minkowski diagrams\) or what is being described are ‘pointers’ in the diagram of reality \(e.g. one’s life\), which represent a certain position in ‘space’ and ‘time’ called 

‘event.’

[^154]: latterness is produced in the young man, who becomes old through time; the gloss gives a series of similes in order to explain the nature of ‘time,’ which otherwise is a highly abstract substance. 

{{103}}

***2.2.6. marks of ‘time’151*** *** are remoteness, simultaneousness,  
and non-simultaneousness, latterness,152*** *** and quickness  
in \[relation to\] another point of reference***

these are the marks of ‘time’ to be associated as distinct from each other; in that respect, \[time is\] regarding the following part of ‘space,’153 and in regard to the production of the cognition of a ‘next’ young \[individual\]; \[time is\] in relation to an old \[individual\] connected with an earlier situation whence the knowledge of latterness154 is produced; then, through the consideration of black hair and so forth, wrinkles, grey hair, and so forth, the knowledge of some young being is produced in relation \[and by comparison with\] the knowledge concerning an old being, that is time; similarly, regarding the activities of agents \[in the sentences\] ‘they are doing simultaneously, they are not doing simultaneously,’ out of these \[expressions\] one experiences and conceptualises time; likewise, for the sake of achieving the abundant \[karmic\] fruit of a ceremonial action such as 

‘cooked rice’ \[time\], it is known from a continuous progression of activities of the agent-priest who \[decides\] ‘today is done slowly,’ alternatively with ‘today is done quickly,’ and this is how the experience of time exists; the qualities of 

\[time\] are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’; 155 moreover, 

***2.2.7. substantiality \[and\] permanence \[of time\]  
are explained by \[the simile of\] ‘air’***

\[time\] is not like the atoms of wind due to its immateriality, \[on the contrary\] time 

has essence-substantiality and continuity.156

[^155]: the qualities of time are the same as the generic qualities of the soul when it reaches the state of liberation; the infinity and diversity of time are the same as the infinity and diversity of soul; time is a parallel substance to soul; therefore, time cannot circum-scribe nor condition the fate of the soul. 

[^156]: time is compared with the atoms of air, perhaps because it moves sequentially, and fragmentary in all directions, but is not exactly like the air, because it lacks constituent parts as air does.

[^157]: ‘tattva’ may be translated as ‘essence’ and ‘tattvic’ may indicate an ‘essential’ or 

‘pure’ entity. 

[^158]: ‘bhāva’ is an ‘existential’ \(a term derived from Heidegger’s temporal categories\) chiefly because the stem √ bhū has a dynamic implication that involves temporal change and activity; therefore, in tune with the broad philosophical terminology, I distinguish between ‘sattā’ \(universal permanent reality\) and ‘bhāva’ \(temporal existential thing\). 

[^159]: if ‘time’ has ‘oneness’ then its holistic nature would contradict its division in parts; philosophically speaking, ‘oneness’ should not be confused with ‘unit.’

[^160]: here again we are confronted with the dilemma of understanding what ‘one’ could mean; the objection’s understanding may be if ‘one’ is either ‘o’ or ‘1’; if it refers to 

‘o’ \(holistic oneness\), then it cannot have beginning, for oneness is a circle with no beginning; but if it is ‘1,’ it means that it has beginning in which case it is no longer eternal, for the unit is caused or produced by ‘o.’

{{105}}

***2.2.8. its essence157 is \[explained\] by existentiality158***

because of the absence of a particular positive mark, and because of the absence of a specific mark, the essence of time is one existential, \[but since\] time is one,159 

how do \[you then\] designate that ‘time’ has a beginning160 and so forth? to which 

\[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.9. \[its\] diversity is \[proved\] by the particularity of activities***

activity is the same as motion, because of the particularity of motion, after having seen the beginning, the endurance and the destruction of a thing, \[then\] there is the designation of the beginning of ‘time’ and so forth as regards the metaphorical plurality of ‘time,’ even though \[time\] is one; 161 \[objection\] no, \[because\] ‘time’ is 

only motion;162 how? because of the marks of ‘time.’

***2.2.10. \[diversity of time exists\] because there is existence \[of  
particularity\] in eternal \[substances\], 163*** *** and because of  
the absence \[of particularity\] in eternal \[substances\]***

\[objection\] if ‘time’ is different from motion then in this way the permanent time is \[proved\] from the marks of ‘time’ which may appear even in the permanent 

‘vacuum’ and so forth; \[the marks of time\] however, happen only in impermanent things; therefore those things which are changing have only periods of time;164 

therefore activity itself is time; \[response\] this is not so, because the marks of time occur in permanent things after a thing has occurred, and not because the activities are time; in connection with them \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^161]: with ādi ‘so forth’ \(at the end of a compound\), Candrānanda presumably indicates sthiti, and vināśa as well. 

[^162]: the static aspect of ‘time’ as devoid of motion is denied by the opponent here. 

[^163]: here we have the cornerstone of Vaiśeṣika philosophy that puts forward its hard metaphysics, namely the possibility of knowing abstract things in their diverse, pluralised, and particularised state, which is made by a theory of individuation \(antyaviśeṣa\), with an ultimate factor \(dharmaviśeṣa\) that proves an absolute ontological pluralism, which applies to both the minute state of matter, as well as the all-pervasive state of infinitely extendable substances such as ‘time,’ ‘space,’ ‘soul,’ and ‘vacuum.’

[^164]: like the earlier distinction between ‘oneness’ and ‘unit,’ Vaiśeṣika argues that ‘time’ 

as an absolute substance is different from its divisions or units, which can be said to be small ‘periods’ or ‘entities.’

[^165]: ‘space’ or ‘direction’ is a highly abstract substance, and likewise ‘time’ and ‘soul,’ 

its generic qualities – that is to say, the qualities that define its existence in the non-corporeal, absolute, and simple state – are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction.’

[^166]: the same observation as in the footnote on time \(sūtra 2.2.7\), space is here described similarly; space like time is sequentially and multi-dimensional, just as air is, for it which blows its winds in all directions, but always sequentially. 

[^167]: ‘tattva’ might be translated as the ‘essence’ of a thing, though in Sāṃkhya it could mean the ‘essential thing’; note that in Vaiśeṣika there no such thing as a radical distinction within abstract substances; further comparative study is needed about the possible contribution of Indian ontology to the Latin scholastic debate between ‘essence’ and 

‘existence’ that has divided European philosophy since Aquinas; a comparative view on Aristotle’s thought of essence could be helpful \(Met 7.4–6, 10–11, 17\). 

{{107}}

***2.2.11. \[these marks\] are called time in respect to the cause***

concerning the marks of time, when \[they\] lack a cause \[then\] \[the marks of time\] 

are impossible, then when an activity is caused \[the effect\] would be called ‘done’ 

and there will be no \[use of the word\] ‘simultaneous,’ therefore, whenever these 

\[marks\] are caused, there the term of time \[is used\]. 

***2.2.12. the marks \[of time\] are in regard to ‘that is  
from that,’ ‘this is obtained from this’***

mark of ‘space’ \[diś\] is the conceptualisation of a concrete demarcated substance 

\[in sentences\] such as ‘this is because of a previous one’; its qualities are ‘number,’ 

‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’;165 furthermore –

***2.2.13. regarding its essence and permanence \[space\]  
is explained by \[the simile of\] ‘air’***

like the ‘air’ \[which\] is has not materiality, \[so also\] ‘space’ is \[like air\] has \[its own\] essence and permanence. 166

***2.2.14. its essence167*** *** \[is known\] by its existence168***

meaning of ‘space’ is this: it is one due to the presence of specific marks of ‘space,’ 

as well as because of the absence of the specific marks of ‘space.’

***2.2.15. even though ‘space’ is one, \[its\] diversity is  
\[proved by\] particular activities169***

speech usages of ‘east,’ ‘south,’ and so forth as applied to ‘space,’ \[show\] the diversity of ‘space’ because of the diversity of specific \[sacrificial\] activities in respect to the offerings to gods towards the east, and the variety of place for offerings towards east, south, in this way there exists the diversity of ‘space’ like east, south, and so forth, \[being\] metaphorically explained by specific activities; \[objection\] if you say that there will be mutual dependency \[between motion and space\], thus \[we say\]

[^168]: ‘bhāva,’ as Halbfass pointed out, has rather dynamic connotations; by extrapolation, one may see in such dynamism the role of karma at play; whenever an absolute being falls from its absolute state, in the context of Indian philosophy, it can be said to be an existential state of decomposition and corruption; a long-time ago, Indian existentialism expressed itself in a predominantly substantialist driven manner \(Brahmanism\) or as mentalist \(Buddhism\). 

[^169]: ‘particular’ is the proof that ‘diversity’ does not refer to the ontological status of the substance as one; here diversity must refer to the states that one substance can undergo; the state makes a stable entity diverse and plural, not rather its static oneness.

***2.2.16. word ‘prācī’ \[east\] is used because of a ‘conjunction’ of the  
sun with a previous happening, a present happening, as well  
as a happening that is going to happen \[in the future\]***

whatever part of ‘space’ is conceptualised at the beginning of the day, \[that is conceptualised\] in past, present, and future relation with the sun; the designation 

‘east’ \[prācī\] is made because of the relation with the sun, therefore \[the sen-

tences\] ‘it goes further’ designates \[the direction of\] the sun.170

***2.2.17. similarly, \[space uses the words\] ‘south,’ ‘west,’ and ‘north’***

as from our logical connection with the sun, the designation of south and so forth 

\[can be defined\]. 

***2.2.18. in this way, the other ‘space’-related \[happenings\] are explained***

in the very same manner, only the other locations, south, east, and so forth are explained; now regarding ‘soul,’ it should be understood by means of causes, qualities such as ‘sound,’ and so forth; \[objection\] now, qualitiness which is not proved in connection with sound and so forth, having proved these, \[a question\] 

is addressed: how there is doubt concerning the qualitiness \[of sound\]? \[he\] says: does doubt have any reasonable \[standing\]? \[response\] it has indeed; \[objection\] 

what is that \[good\] reason? \[response\] that \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.19. doubt is \[produced\] due to the perception of  
generality, the non-perception of particularity, and  
from an \[uncertain\] specific recollection***

when there is a general gaze at a ‘man’ and a ‘tree,’ if there is no discerning of their particularities171 such as ‘hand’ \[of man\] and ‘cavity’ \[of tree\], then from memory172 of a specific detail there is henceforth a ‘doubt-knowledge’ \[as expressed by questions\] such as: ‘what could that be, a tree, or a man?’ \[doubt\] 

is 2-fold: external173 and internal; 174 the external \[doubt\] is 2-fold: perceptive and non-perceptive; regarding the imperceptible \[one\], first \[he\] says, like that –

[^172]: the knowledge produced is only a ‘reconstruction’ of such a gaze; yet, what Aristotle says about memory is only about the past, not the future or present, De Mem 1. 449b 10–20. 

[^173]: ‘external doubt’ that can be either imperceptible as per VSc 2.2.20 or perceptible as per VSc 2.2.21. 

[^174]: ‘internal doubt’ described in VSc 2.2.23 arises from vidyā and avidyā.

***2.2.20. \[is the dilemma between\] seen and unseen***

when for instance there is an indication of a man, there is the question as to what this gaze could be, \[and\] doubt \[is when man’s arrival\] is not seen, but only 

\[inferred\] from hearing; but as regards \[the perceptible doubt\] \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.21. \[arises when\] a ‘seen thing’ resembles a ‘visible thing’175***

now doubt is when after having seen the same man \[questions such as\], ‘is this really the one I saw earlier, or not the one I saw earlier?’

***2.2.22. \[doubt of\] the visible thing \[can be\] likely visible, unlikely  
visible, and both ways \[likely and unlikely\] visible***

at first, there is the gaze of Devadatta with the lock of hair, gradually the gaze of 

\[him\] with a shaved head, and in the third instance the gaze of the lock of hair sitting in its place \[head\]; in the fourth \[stage of visibility\], Devadatta is known by conversation and so forth, and doubt is in relation with \[the\] unspecified moment at the time of twilight \[when such questions arise\] ‘what could that be, a lock of hair, or a shaved head?’; in a previous sūtra, doubt was \[defined\] by recollecting 

\[too\] many objects, here however, doubt is because of a specific recollection of 

one and the same object;176 but, regarding the internal doubt \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.23. doubt is because of the \[dilemma between\]  
valid knowledge and invalid knowledge***

‘vidyā’ is perfect knowledge, ‘avidyā’ is deceiving knowledge; 177 when an astrol-

oger is asked for an auspicious \[thing\], \[the first time\] the thing is true, the second time \[it\] is non-true, \[but\] on the third time there is a doubt as to whether the real thing is true as in the first time, \[or\] true like in the second time; hence, that is how doubt is being described; in relation to that, ‘sound’ might be explained as such –

***2.2.24. ‘sound’ is that whose meaning178*** *** is grasped by ear***

‘sound’ is that whose subject-matter is perceived by ear; because ‘word’ has not been conventionalised in connection with universality and so forth, so that śabdatva should not be \[understood to be the same as\] śabda; \[this is why\] the word ‘artha’ \[object\] has been taken \[for śabda\]. 

situation in which this very prediction does not come true; and \(3\) a situation where there is a doubt about whether there is truth or not in the first and second situation enumerated \(see trans. Nozawa, 1993, p. 109\).

[^179]: sūtra refers to different kinds of specificities, one that is presumably ‘different in different objects’ and one that is ‘common in many objects,’ namely sāmānyaviśeṣa; the first one may be said to be the ultimate particularity, whereas the second is the ‘universal particularity’ \(a lower universal, such as genus and species, which is helpful to determine the ‘class’ of an object\). 

{{113}}

***2.2.25. doubt is when \[sound\] subsists in substance, quality, motion***

\[objection\] doubt in regard to ‘sound’ is due to its generic base, such as substantiality, qualitiness, and so forth \[motionness\]; on this, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.26. and \[doubt is\] when the particularity \[of sound\] is seen  
in both \[ways\], in the same \[homogenous\] species,  
and in different \[heterogeneous\] objects179***

the visibility of the particularity in ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ and so forth is because earthiness is homogenous as well as heterogeneous, of which quality and motion \[are such examples\]; therefore, doubt concerning ‘sound’ \[raises the question\] as to what is that particularity perceived by \[the\] ear in comparison with the qualities between different mutual subject-matters of things; this is not so, 

***2.2.27. because it is possessed by one substance,  
\[sound\] is not a substance***

because \[sound\] exists only in one substance \[such as\] ‘vacuum,’ this ‘sound’ is not a substance like, for instance, the substance pot and so forth; atoms and so forth are not a substance, and there cannot be many substances like pot and so forth. 

***2.2.28. because it is not visually perceptible, \[sound\] is not a motion180***

when substance or motion is perceptible by different organs, then that which belongs to the sight is visible too, but ‘sound,’ although it is perceived by \[the\] 

ear, is that which does not belong to the sight; in this manner the quality \[sound\] 

is firmly ascertained; however, 

***2.2.29. even though it is a quality, \[sound\] is similar to  
motions because it has a terminus point181***

even though \[sound\] is a quality, it is similar with motions \[in that it has\] termination, \[while\] destruction is inferred because is not known after production; \[objection\] if you say that even though \[sound\] exists \[but\] not comprehended because of some cause, \[then\] no, 

[^180]: ‘sound’ is again proved as a quality not a substance or motion. 

[^181]: ‘śabda’ might be subject to destruction and creation, because, like any other entity subjacent to motion, it becomes prone to change.

[^182]: it may be yet another reference to the theory of asatkāryavāda.

***2.2.30. because it has not real marks \[sound is invisible\]***

that which is not comprehended although it exists due to some cause, its mark makes us comprehend its existence, \[and\] in the case of sound, however, after the articulation due to an absence of any mark connected, there is only the absence 

\[of sound, ascertained\]. 

***2.2.31. \[sound\] is dissimilar from continuity \[hence is impermanent\]***

it is therefore impermanent by virtue of its dissimilarity to permanent \[entities\], and because of having been previously uttered \[produced\]

***2.2.32. \[sound exists\] because it is produced182***

and ‘sound’ is an effect, its production is due to ‘conjunction’ and so forth, therefore it is impermanent; furthermore, 

***2.2.33. \[sound exists\] because of \[its inevitable\] absence183***

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that is \[sound\] has a previous non-existence; that which has prior non-existence is destructible; 184 and because sound is produced by causes, it has a prior non-existence, the causes are not indicative \[of prior-existence\], why? 

***2.2.34. because \[it is subject to\] changes from \[its\] cause***

change of ‘sound’ is intelligible by \[the simile\] of a cause such as a drum, and so forth, \[whereby sound is\] big in a big drum, and small in a small one; but regarding \[its\] both manifestations, 

***2.2.35. because \[is subject to\] defect***

if \[sound\] is manifested permanently, then the sound used by one person in a sacrifice will not be used by another person, in the same way as sacrificial grass like ‘darbha’185\[is not used\] due to its defect of staleness, 186 therefore, sound is 

impermanent;187 why it is an effect-product? \[to which\] \[Kaṇāda\] says –

[^186]: grass cannot be used by another person because that will not give a proper result, it will be stale; here dharmaviśeṣa shows that it arises in a uniquely individual way. 

[^187]: ‘sound’ functions differently from grass because of being impermanent; a man can use the same ‘sound’ that has been used by another person, so sound is newly produced.

[^188]: Jambūvijayaji the editor, did not trace this quotation here. The quote may indicate that 

‘sound’ is a channel through which the Vedas have been revealed; since meaning and language is conventional, so also ‘sound’ is. 

[^189]: Possibly the objection is raised by the Mīmāṃsākas, who hold that language and meaning are eternal \(according to the Bhāṭṭās, the ‘particular is understood secondarily, or metaphorically, that is, via lakṣaṇā vṛtti; according to Prābhākaras, the particular is known at the same time as the universal. There is a logical concomitance between the two \(vyāpti\); personal communication: Marco Ferrante\). 

[^190]: the natural conclusion would be that if a thing is simultaneous \(it occurs in 2 places at the same time\) it will then be eternal, for neither time nor space can contain it; in the case of ‘sound’ however, it is impermanent because it cannot occur in 2 places \(at the same time\), so it cannot be both ‘1’ and ‘many’ as eternal entities usually are \(time, space, soul\). 

{{117}}

***2.2.36. ‘sound’ is brought forth by ‘conjunction’  
and ‘disjunction’ and ‘sound’***

because of a ‘conjunction’ between drum and stick, because of the separation of parts of cloth, and because of the production of sound out of \[another\] sound, just as there is a continuity of waves, we think that sound is an effect. 

***2.2.37. \[sound\] has no continuity, as its marks \[show\]***

‘from these, Vedas are descended’ \[…\]188 because of this \[Vedic sentence\] which is a Vedic mark, sound is impermanent; \[objection\] no, ‘sound’ is permanent. 189

***2.2.38. but \[if sound were permanent-continuous\]  
it will not occur twice190***

\[Mīmāṃsākas’ view\]191 the product-beings have 2 forms of activity: one is generative of effects, the other has the nature of division-distribution; however, ‘sound’ 

has only one function, \[namely\] that to ascertain meaning, which is pronuncia-tion, \[but\] ‘sound’ is not produced for the sake of itself, 192 therefore ‘sound’ is 

permanent. 

***2.2.39. \[sound is continuous\] because of the absence of ‘number’193***

the ‘sound’ is produced and is destroyed, ‘this word is mentioned twice’ \[but\] here because it has been destroyed, there is no repetition in number, but repetition of 

‘sound’ does exist, therefore ‘sound’ is permanent. 194

[^191]: Sūtrapāṭha rehearses the tenets, which belong to other orthodox and unorthodox schools for refutation without always specifying their name; we take it to be the Mīmāṃsākas’ view, which is expressed here and in the next sūtra, until end of VSc 2.2.42 where the Vaiśeṣika’s voice comes in again. 

[^192]: according to Mīmāṃsā sound is the vehicle that conveys the eternal meaning. 

[^193]: ‘number’ is a quality of eternal substances \(e.g. time, space, souls\); number is considered only from 2 onwards, thus, if it is said that number has no number, that means that ‘sound’ is impermanent for it occurs only once, after which it vanishes. 

[^194]: another feature of the impermanent nature of an entity is that it cannot be divided into parts; it is the reason why Vaiśeṣika insists that abstract substances such as ‘time,’ 

‘space,’ ‘vacuum,’ and ‘soul’ are ‘one’ even though we can see a certain diversity in them, this diversity should be seen only in metaphorical, not ontological terms.
