**/ the first lesson of the seventh chapter /**

now, he explains ‘form-colour’ and so forth, 

***7.1.1. the qualities have been stated***

the qualities intended by the sūtra358 are ‘form-colour’ and so forth, this is the 

meaning \[of the sūtra\]

***7.1.2. and the definition of qualities has been explained \[too\]***

the meaning is designated in respect to the difference between \[qualities\], substances, and motions as stated by \[the sūtra\] ‘\[qualities\] have substance as a substratum’ \[1.1.15\]

***7.1.3. and \[the definition\] has been stated thus: ‘this quality  
here’ is ‘such present quality’ \[hic et nunc\] ***

\[sūtra\] has stated that ‘earth’ has ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch,’ and others as such; concerning this \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***7.1.4. ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ and ‘touch’ are  
transitory \[qualities\] of ‘earth’ because of the  
impermanence of \[the concrete\] substance***

because the substratum is dissolvable, its ‘form-colour’ and so forth which are implied in \[that substratum\] are also dissolved, for example because substance-substratum is dissolved ‘pot’ \[made\] of ‘earth’ \[is dissolved too\]. 

***7.1.5. \[impermanence of concrete substance\] is  
because of a conjunction with fire***

destruction of ‘form-colour’ and so forth \[which happens\] in the atoms of ‘earth’ 

is because of the association with fire, 359 \[and because\] the inherent product disappears with its substratum too; 360 how is it that there is a connection of atoms with fire? 

[^360]: ‘inherence’ \(samavāya\) opposed to saṃyoga is supposed to explain a form of ‘occurrence’ \(vṛtti\), a ‘dependent occurrence’ of holes in their parts or of attributes in their substratum.

[^361]: qualities are permanent and by ‘manifestation’ of quality from another quality one may understand what seems to be the pīlupākavāda theory of qualities of atoms, whereby qualities are not destroyed but rather transformed as a result of a contact with fire. 

[^362]: alternative translation: ‘because from qualities such as black and so forth, different qualities are produced separately, therefore, earlier qualities of atom are destroyed, because something which has qualities cannot produce other qualities \[simultaneously\]’; what derives from this gloss is the capacity of production of new qualities successively, not simultaneously, and only after the previous ones have disappeared. 

{{191}}

***7.1.6. \[the impermanence of qualities is\] because the  
qualities metamorphose into others361***

because that from which there is production of blackness and other qualities and so forth is different from the production of other qualities;362 therefore, the previous qualities of atoms are destroyed, because a quality cannot be produced from that which possesses \[the same\] quality. 

***7.1.7. by this \[metamorphosis\] the impermanence363*** ***  
of the permanent364*** *** is explained***

in this way, the production of other qualities in the permanent atoms \[and\] the impermanence of ‘colour’ and so forth has been stated in relation to ‘earth’ 

\[atoms\] only;365 because –

***7.1.8. for example ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ are  
permanent because the essence is permanent ***

because of the permanence of the substratum, the atoms of ‘water,’366 ‘lustre,’ 

‘air,’ and \[their\] ‘form-colour’ and so forth are permanent too, due to the non-production of conflicting qualities, \[and\] because there is no destruction due to a 

‘conjunction’ with fire. 367

***7.1.9. \[another example:\] impermanence subsists in impermanent  
\[substances\] due to substances’ impermanence368***

in \[substances\] which are impermanent, ‘water’ and so forth, \[qualities\] such as 

‘form-colour’ and so forth are impermanent too, because of being destroyed with the destruction of the \[concrete\] substance. 

***7.1.10. and \[those qualities produced\] from heating the  
‘earth’ are primarily qualities of cause***

qualities such as ‘colour’ and so forth are produced in ‘earth’ which is impermanent when is in its ‘product form’, and these are preceded by the qualities of 

\[their\] cause; in ‘earth’ which is permanent together with the atoms’ intrinsic nature, \[their qualities\] are produced from heat due to a ‘conjunction’ between fire and heating. 

[^363]: ‘impermanence’ \(nitya\) here refers to qualities. 

[^364]: sūtra indicates the permanence of ‘substance’ \(dravya\). 

[^365]: regarding the dissolution of form-colour in relation to its substratum \(pot\). see VSc 7.1.4. 

[^366]: ‘salila’ another term for ‘water,’ ‘liquid,’ ‘tears.’

[^367]: the permanence of qualities is acknowledged. 

[^368]: alternative translation: when the substratum is destroyed, the qualities are destroyed too; when the permanent substances exist, the permanent qualities exist too.

[^369]: originally a substance has no \(specific\) qualities, for qualities are produced afterwards \(asatkāryavāda\); nor does it have motions, which brings us to infer that the English translation of ‘dravya’ is closer to ‘essence’ rather than a ‘concrete thing.’

[^370]: ‘motion’ \(karman\) has no qualities, such as a substance can have. 

[^371]: what could be the ‘subject-matter’ referred to here? the commentator says that subject-matter can be ‘undistinguished \(aviśeṣa\) from the qualities of the entire whole’; the answer may be drawn from the first line of the same gloss ‘qualities are produced due to the qualities of cause,’ which leaves us to infer that a substance has 2 sets 

{{193}}

***7.1.11. in ‘water’, ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ there are no \[other qualities\] that  
are produced from heating which are primarily qualities of cause***

in ‘water,’ which is a composite product and whose nature is an inherent cause, qualities such as ‘colour’ and so forth are produced; but in the permanent \[earth\] 

in its atomic structure, \[the qualities\] do not exist at all because there are no other opposite qualities \[produced from heating\] in the atoms of water. 

***7.1.12. there are no qualities \[other than\] the qualities  
produced from substance, because the qualities  
\[produced\] by motions are not qualities***

qualities are produced due to the qualities of cause in relation to a substance which is produced without qualities369 and they are not produced from \[other\] qualities and motions, 370 due to the absence of co-existence whose subject-matter is one 

and the same with the qualities of the whole \[thing\],371 just as motionness is. 

***7.1.13. this is how the cooked \[qualities\] are explained***

when that which is produced from cooking such as blackness and so forth ceases to exist because of a connection with fire, then, those \[products\] are established to be devoid of quality; if you say that – just as connection is produced in something which has connection – qualities born out of cooking \[of a substance which has qualities\] are then produced from baking, then \[the answer is\] no, 

***7.1.14. because \[qualities subsists\] in one substantiality \[only\]372***

if \[the qualities\] produced from heat are connected with one substance, \[then the question is\] how could they be produced since they are opposite \[in nature\]? the initiation of a ‘conjunction’ with a substance will not be a defective \[argument\] 

because substance is many; 373 now we shall discuss ‘dimension’ –

of qualities, some ‘specific,’ others ‘generic’ \(e.g. soul\); when, however, it is said that originally a substance has no qualities, that must refer to its ‘specific qualities’ 

\(vaiśeṣikaguṇa\) which occur as a result of ‘motion’ and presumably under the impact of adṛṣṭa \(karma theory\). 

[^372]: there are 3 kinds of substantiality: essential-universal; accidental-particular; and the specific-genera \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

[^373]: ‘contact’ \(saṃyoga\) takes place only among substances, whereas ‘inherence’ 

\(samavāya\) takes place between substances and qualities.

[^374]: the question to which the gloss attempts an answer is the following: starting with which size is the perception of an entity possible? The atom cannot be perceived because it is too small, neither dyad, nor even ‘mind’ which is of the size of an atom; it appears that for Vaiśeṣikas, it is possible to perceive ‘soul’ through ‘awareness’ \(see VSc 3.2.13\) but not ‘mind’ which is too small – unless one is an advanced yogi. 

[^375]: ‘ordinary perception’ \(pratyakṣa\) is possible with things that can be ‘seen’ somehow, therefore the size of ‘boundless’ of an entity begins with triad upwards \(such as the quality of ‘number’ applies to anything beyond ‘number two’; not with ‘zero’ or 

‘one,’ which presumably are not numbers\); the sentence ‘boundless and minuteness are causes’ shows once again that for Vaiśeṣika philosophy, ontology of qualities and substances precedes and is more important than epistemology. 

[^376]: the view that triad \(tryaṇuka\) is still un-graspable \(VSc 4.1.8\) differentiates Candrānanda from other Vaiśeṣika commentators, an observation upheld by both Isaacson and Priesendanz. 

[^377]: sūtra appears to acknowledge the difference between ‘multiplicity of causes’ 

\(kāraṇabahutva\) and ‘boundless of causes’ \(kāraṇamahattva\), one may point to a successive chain of causality, the other to its extension or capacity to form largeness or infinite extension of a collection of particularities \(pracayaviśeṣa\). 

[^378]: ‘accumulation of particularity’ is a very important concept in establishing the role of viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa in relation to the knowledge of ‘universals’ \(sāmānya\); substances which are said to be vibhū, like ‘vacuum’ and ‘soul,’ include immanently in themselves a multitude of particularities \(pracayaviśeṣa\); the concept of ‘particularity’ 

is a constitutive part of universality, and that particularity is indirectly as infinite and large as the universal is; if particularity is separate from universal, or if for example, 

{{195}}

***7.1.15. comprehension and non-comprehension of  
minuteness and boundless \[dimensions\] are explained  
in respect to the permanence \[of things\]***

‘permanence’ is the name of a chapter; ‘that which is comprehended, that is definitely \[of a certain\] large \[size\],’ but in atoms however, there is no perception of one atom, a dyad and mind; 374 thus in the chapter called ‘nitya,’ boundless is 

called permanent \[and there\] it is told that boundless and minuteness are causes for comprehensibility and incomprehensibility, because there is a rule of what boundless375 is regarding comprehensibility; concerning triad, although it is a 

\[type\] of boundless, it is still, incomprehensible. 376

***7.1.16. boundless is the accumulation of particularities,377*** *** because  
the substratum has multiplicity and is unlimited378***

plurality of ‘number’ – which exists in the atomic dyad which is the cause in the atomic triad – produces the boundless due to the absence of unlimited causes;379 

in a substance of the size of 2 fingers, the size of the finger is the cause which produces \[the\] great size; 380 ‘pracaya’ \[accumulation\] means ‘loose contact’;381 

in a substance having 2 cotton balls, the accumulation of 2 lumps of cotton ball requires a ‘loose contact’ between the parts \[whereby ‘accumulation’ or ‘loose contact’\] is the substratum of their own \[parts\] which are ‘the boundless.’382

the ‘particular good’ is divorced from Common Good \(the universal\), the particular becomes finite and just as a lost entity in ‘space,’ it becomes an existential doomed to suspension, or extinction; such a particular cannot exist indefinitely without absorp-tion, because the infinity of ‘space,’ its ‘dimension,’ is related to the infinity of ‘time’; 

‘time’ and ‘space’ being interrelated concepts, it follows that their particularity would no longer reside outside ‘time,’ but rather in ‘time’; yet, the ontological status of antyaviśeṣa, as that of other eternal substances is that of being a fundamentally ‘different,’ yet immanent part of ‘time.’

[^379]: the commentator seems to doubt that causes can form ‘boundless,’ or ‘accumulation’; cause produces effect, and once the effect perishes cause perishes too. 

[^380]: ‘boundless’ \(mahattva\) takes shape as result of additions ranging from simple to complex, from one to many. 

[^381]: about ‘loose contact’ see Vādīndra’s polemical passage which argues for the real 

‘nature’ \(svarūpa\) of the ‘ultimate particularities’ \(antyaviśeṣa\) VSv long version, p. 

70: ‘viśeṣeṣu sattāṅagīkāre svarupahāniprāsaṅga iti cet – na sattāyā svarūpahānyā 

saha vyāpti viraheṇa prasanṅgasya praśithilamūlatvāt; viśeṣeṣu sattāṅagīkāre viśeṣalakṣaṇa hāniḥ’; from this passage it follows that viśeṣa does not have sattā, but rather its existence is only ‘relative,’ ‘relational,’ and ‘dependent’ on something else, the substance; viśeṣa is a fuzzy concept that is very ‘loose’ \(praśithila\), and cannot exist independently. 

[^382]: ‘accumulation’ \(pracaya\) is a key concept for understanding the dilemma between 

‘particular’ and ‘universal,’ between ultimately small \(antyaviśeṣa\) and the universal \(sāmānya\).

[^383]: if boundless is a ‘reality’ \(the accumulation of parts\) so also the minuteness \(the many small parts that constitute great accumulation, e.g. antyaviśeṣa\) is; Vaiśeṣika sees no contradiction between one and many, between universal and particular. 

[^384]: ‘kuvala’ \(Ziziphus mauritiana\) refers most probably to the jujube tree and its fruit, whose precise natural distribution is uncertain due to its extensive cultivation; its origin is thought to be in southern Asia \(between Lebanon, northern India, and southern and central China\). 

[^385]: ‘āmalaka’ \(Emblica officinalis\) may refer to the gooseberry fruit, a species of ribes \(which includes currants\); it is spread in India \(where it is used in pickle\), the Caucasus, and northern Africa; it has a symbolical value in Theravada Buddhism. 

[^386]: ‘bilva’ \(Ægle marmelos\) possibly ‘Bengal quince,’ known as the ‘golden apple,’ is a species of a tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia; it grows in 

{{197}}

***7.1.17. minuteness is the reverse of that \[boundless\]383***

it should be acknowledged that minuteness is of the dimension of a dyad \[and\] is that which is completely different from the 3 causes out of which boundless exists. 

***7.1.18. minute and boundless, is that in which there  
is both manifestation of particularity as well  
as non-manifestation of particularity***

in boundless, there are things \[contained\] which are minute in respect to the arrangement of kuvala fruit384 by comparison with āmalaka fruit; 385 but āmalaka fruit is minute in comparison with bilva fruit; 386 thus, because of the \[relative\] 

presence and absence in one and the same substance, the designation of ‘minute’ 

and ‘great’ has a relative \[metaphorical value\]; from where did \[you derive such an assertion\]? 

***7.1.19. \[for example\] the oneness of ‘time’ \[has units and oneness\]387***

since, at one and the same time, 2 men arrange the same thing to be small and large in relation to another thing, therefore we know \[the sentence\] ‘this is metaphorical’; 388 in respect to the minute \[thing\] this \[is decided\] by mutual comparison. 

***7.1.20. \[minute and boundless are proved\] also from analogy***

just as there is whiteness only in a product made of white threads, and not blackness, similarly, from this exemplification, \[we say that\] boundless is generated only from a great size, and not from minuteness. 

India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malesia as a naturalised species, and it is a tree considered sacred by Hindus. 

[^387]: alternative translation: ‘because one and the same thing can be minute and large at the same “time”’; everything can be large and small when it is compared with the size of other things, both of which are an aspect of oneness; a small and a big thing, minuteness and largeness, can be simultaneous; but ‘time’ is not simultaneous, for as we shall see, it is a sum of units, only; it is conceived as a succession of minute points which together form the extended infinite and eternal ‘time’ which is metaphorically expressed; the main subject in this sūtra is not ‘time,’ but the fruit discussed in the previous gloss. 

[^388]: in other words, oneness of time is to be taken ‘metaphorically.’

[^389]: if there is absence of ‘minuteness’ and ‘boundless’ in the parts, then there is absence of ‘minuteness’ and ‘boundless’ in the ‘whole’ \(oneness\); whatever exists in parts, that is also present in the ‘whole’; Indian philosophy overcomes the Greek philosophical dilemma between parts and whole, logos-logos, addressed from very early by Anaximander. 

[^390]: ‘has, have’ is translated when we have the bahuvrīhi compound; but when we have the tatpuruṣa compound we translate by ‘is, are’; as Professor Thite clarifies, in the Vedic texts, there are accents, and with the help of such accents one can decide whether a word is a tatpuruṣa compound or bahuvrīhi; the ‘udātta’ accent, for instance, is not shown by any marks in Sanskrit, but in the Romanised texts, it is marked with a sign of a single apostrophe; in a tatpuruṣa compound, the accent stays on the second part of the compound but in the bahuvrīhi compound the accent stays on the first part of the compound \(see Aufrecht’s edition of Rig Veda\). 

{{199}}

***7.1.21. when minute and great \[things\] do not have minuteness, and  
boundless, \[they\] are explained by way of motions and qualities***

just as qualities and motions which are devoid of qualities due to the absence of the co-existence of oneness in qualities of parts such as ‘colour’ and so forth, in a similar manner, there is \[an\] absence of minuteness and largeness in \[the\] plurality of causes and so forth due to the absence of \[their\] inherence in the nature of 

oneness.389

***7.1.22. minuteness and boundless \[explain\] that motions  
and qualities have no390 \[other\] qualities***

just as because of the plurality of causes and so forth \[and\] due to the absence of co-existence in one and the same thing, there is absence of minuteness and boundless, in a similar manner the quality of motion391 is devoid of minuteness and boundless. 

***7.1.23. in this way, \[Kaṇāda\] explains shortness and lengthiness***

comprehension and non-comprehension are \[explained\] like minuteness and boundless; the lengthiness is produced from unlimited causes and so forth, shortness is \[just\] the reversal of that; therefore, this figurative usage is due to an existential particularity;392 concerning the absence of shortness and lengthiness there is an extension \[of the same rule of application\]. 

***7.1.24. motions are \[devoid of ‘x’\]393*** *** because of motions,  
qualities are \[devoid of ‘y’\]394*** *** because of qualities***

just as motions are devoid of minuteness and boundless due to the absence of the co-

existence of oneness in the multiplicity of causes,395 in the same way, the qualities of motions are devoid of shortness and lengthiness; these are the qualities of motions. 

[^391]: as in the preceding gloss 7.1.21, Candrānanda speaks of karmaguṇa, or guṇakarmani; earlier we mentioned that motions do not have qualities. 

[^392]: ‘viśeṣabhāva’ may be the ultimate existential \(antyaviśeṣa\) in the system’s theory of individuation, which ‘measures’ both the intervals as well as the sizes of things. 

[^393]: ‘devoid’ of minuteness and boundless; this sūtra must be read in relation to 7.1.22. 

[^394]: devoid of shortness and lengthiness; this sūtra must be read as a continuation of 7.1.22. 

[^395]: ‘absence of the inherence of oneness in the multiplicity of causes’ indicates that inherence is a different concept from the connection between ‘units’ out of which ‘multiplicity’ is made; it may well be the case that ‘oneness’ is not one and the same concept as ‘unit.’

[^398]: atoms are said to be globular \(or spherical\) but form a ‘continuum’ of a whole all-pervasive substance seen as a collection of minute entities; a comparable view that began with speculations from Aristotle’s Physics \(232b20\) was professed at Oxford in the 13th century but rejected as heretical by the Paris Condemnations in 1277. 

[^399]: the view according to whatever is globular is eternal derived from the definition about the composition of a substance; whatever has parts \[or corners\] is dissolvable; a globular object not only cannot have parts, but also by not having corners, it cannot ‘cling’ 

to something; the view that globular things must be eternal can also be encountered in classical Greek philosophy.

\[the\] 4-fold dimension is impermanent because it exists in continuous sub-

***7.1.27. ignorance is the logical mark of ‘valid knowledge’400***

that \[entity\] devoid of ‘dimension,’ the manifestation of a substance devoid of dimension, is the inferential mark for the existence of an atomic ‘dimension’; 

‘avidyā’ refers to the impossibility \[of measuring the atom\] and ‘vidyā’ refers to 

\[the\] ‘possibility’ \[of measurement\].401

***7.1.28. because of \[its\] omnipresence402 ‘vacuum’ is very large***

because of ‘conjunction,’ omnipresence is from the coming together \[and\] from 

‘disjunction’ between coagulating substances, \[thus\] ‘vacuum’ is understood to have extreme great size. 

***7.1.29. ‘soul’ is similar \[very large\]***

since ‘soul’ resembles ‘vacuum’ \[in dimension\], it should be seen as extremely great \[too\];403 the ‘space’ and ‘time’ are great also, even though they are not \[mentioned\] jointly. 

[^400]: sūtra draws a sharp distinction between ‘ontological knowledge’ and ‘logical knowledge’; the latter is based on ‘inferential marks’ \(liṅga\) and seems to have a lesser importance than ontological knowledge. 

[^401]: the impossibility of the existence of a substance having no measurement is the mark of the possibility \[of the measurement of the atom\]; ‘saṃbhava’ is translated with 

‘experience-perception’ because of the compound sam \(with\) \+ ‘bhāva’ \(existential\), as well as because the whole gloss refers to the epistemology of the atomic dimension; this is possible \(saṃbhava\) only in advanced forms of knowledge. 

[^402]: there is a difference between infinity and magnitude, for Vaiśeṣika seems to differentiate between vibhava and mahat. 

[^403]: that ‘soul’ is omnipresent is only a conjecture from VS 7.1.28–29.

[^404]: as elsewhere in this commentary ‘bhāva’ has been translated with ‘existential’ and 

‘entity.’

[^405]: the explanation of mind as atomic leads to another speculation \(possibly from the side of yogis\), namely that thinking is generally a successive, not simultaneous process; the argument Candrānanda puts forward is based on sheer logics; because mind is atomic, it cannot be in 2 places at the same time, nor simultaneous; these latter characteristics belong to substances that are all-pervasive \(time-space, soul, and vacuum\). 

{{203}}

***7.1.30. but ‘mind’, because of the absence of that

and due to the absence of all-pervasiveness, ‘mind’ is atomic \[in dimension\] 

which explains why it cannot cognise simultaneously. 405

***7.1.31. by means of qualities, ‘space’ is explained***

whenever one makes a limitation, there is an arrangement \[as expressed in the sentences\] ‘east \[of that\], from this to that limit,’ therefore ‘space’ is explained regarding concrete things, therefore ‘space’ is explained as possessed by largeness because the qualities are named in connection with concrete substances; therefore, 

***7.1.32. \[with space\] ‘time’ is explained by the causal \[principle\]406***

by means of a causality, which is the alternative causality between far and near 

\[time\], ‘time’ is inferred because of its existence everywhere,407 \[thus\] by such 

\[reasoning\] ‘time’ is explained as all-pervasive. 

**// the first lesson of the seventh chapter //**

**//the second lesson of the seventh chapter //**

now, concerning the succession of numbering, this represents the proof for the differential arrangement of \[qualities\] ‘number’ and so forth,408 due to their separate nature from \[other\] qualities ‘colour’ and so forth, for which purpose, \[he\] says –

[^406]: the principle of causality or ‘consequentiality’ is followed by both ‘time’ and ‘space,’ 

as well as ‘mind.’

[^407]: time inferred from ‘existence everywhere’ shows that ‘time’ is similar to ‘space’ and has an implied spatial or locative value as well. 

[^408]: Vaiśeṣika is a ‘philosophy of difference and particularity,’ so number plays a major role in demonstrating the differential nature of reality and its constituents.

[^409]: pṛthaktva is one of the generic qualities of ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space’; like the categories of sāmānya and viśeṣa – being correspondent to each other – pṛthaktva \(separateness\) and ekatva \(oneness\) should be analysed in mutual correspondence. 

[^410]: dvitva \(reduplication or separateness\) accounts for the infinite division of things belonging to the same class \(genera\), and in this respect one can say that a substance, as well as being a produced effect can be multiplied ad infinitum, remaining thus, from an ontological point of view, both one and many, both identical and separated; it is in this way that ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space’ subsist in their abstract yet essential ontological realm. 

[^411]: this is an important passage as it further elucidates what ‘sāmānya bhāva’ is in relation to the reality of particularity and universality, which both have an infinite extension, 

{{205}}

***7.2.1. another category is ‘oneness,’ which like ‘distinctness,’409*** *** is  
a different subject-matter \[having\] a distinct nature \[other  
than the nature of\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch.’***

‘form-colour’ is not the cause for the conceptualisation of ‘this is the same’ 

because conceptualisation varies in character; it is true that ‘colour’ might cause the conceptualisation of \[statements like\] ‘that possesses a ‘colour’ and so forth; but this rationalisation refers to another subject-matter; ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ are qualities which precede \[each other\], such as the effects are \[preceded\] 

by causes; production is \[thus\] the cognition of many objects, due to the ‘uniqueness’ and the reduplication of ‘distinctness’; 410 similarly, due to ‘distinctness’ 

there exists \[as a result\] reduplication, however, the ‘universal’ is not something different from ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness.’411

***7.2.2. from them \[oneness and separateness\]412*** *** permanence  
and impermanence of ‘lustre’ are explained by  
\[the simile of\] ‘form-colour’ and ‘touch.’***

just as there is permanence of substance, the ‘form-colour’ and ‘touch’ of ‘lustre’-

atoms are permanent,413 similarly the oneness and ‘distinctness’ are permanent too, if they exist in eternal substances; and to give an example, when ‘lustre’ is not a permanent substance, because its touch and ‘form-colour’ are not permanent, so also the singularity of oneness and ‘distinctness’ are not permanent when they subsist in an effect-product. 414

***7.2.3. and \[likewise\] production \[is explained\]415***

for instance, the effects of lustre \[emerge\] like qualities are preceded by causes because ‘distinctness’ and oneness produce \[the experience of\] ‘touch’ and ‘form-colour’; thus is \[also the case\] with ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ \[and\] ‘viscosity.’

reality, and permanence, whereby particularity being a universal as the universality, and universal being as specific as particularity. 

[^412]: alternatively: oneness and separateness. 

[^413]: when in Vaiśeṣika we have the mahābhūtas which are said to be impermanent, this transitory character applies only to the concrete form of mahābhūtas, however, the atoms constituting these mahābhūtas are permanent; so ultimately, substance is impermeant or eternal, even though it suffers modification and change. 

[^414]: the impermanence refers, therefore, to the nature of the effect and products to subsist ontological change \(pīlupākavāda\).

[^416]: sūtra tries to avoid infinite regress, because if ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ were derived from each other, the ontological knowledge \(which usually acknowledges a substratum\) would no longer be a valid ground for demonstration. 

[^417]: in other words, motions and qualities do not possess other qualities \(such as separateness and oneness\) for otherwise they would lead to infinite regress, and the ontological nature and definition of qualities would be lost. 

[^418]: possibly here a refutation of a Vedānta position. 

{{207}}

***7.2.4. the absence of‘distinctness’ and ‘oneness’ in a  
\[another\] distinctness’ ‘and ‘oneness’ demonstrates  
the \[reality\] of ‘minuteness’ and ‘largeness’416***

correspondingly, there is no ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ \[in another oneness and ‘distinctness’\] due to the absence of co-existence of one and the same subject-matter in the qualities, and in the constitution of oneness and ‘distinctness’ 

\[respectively\], this is the meaning \[of this sūtra\]. 

***7.2.5. motions \[are explained\] through motions, qualities through qualities417***

likewise \[if you say that\] because of the absence of \[motions\], the qualities of motions do not have ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ inherent in one and the same object and its qualities; \[objection\] this is not so, because that is like with all categories, \[for\] oneness is when there is absence of particularity. 

***7.2.6. oneness does not exist in all things418 because  
qualities and motions are innumerable419***

\[if you say\] that because motions and qualities are numberless, oneness subsists in all \[categories\], then this is not so; \[but\] if you say that qualities and so forth are metaphorically one, \[then Kaṇāda says this\]

***7.2.7. if420 oneness does not exist, metaphorical  
existence does not exist \[either\]***

if ‘oneness’ does not exist first and foremost \[in the substance\], then that oneness will be imagined to be metaphorical in qualities, but \[to say\] that oneness suffices to be established as a real entity,421 this is simply undesirable, because the difference \[between substance and quality\] is from a different passage: ‘\[oneness\] exists first in the substances and secondarily in the qualities’; \[objection\] now, if there is oneness of cause and effect because substances are numberless, \[it follows that\] 

owing the absence of oneness only, there will be difference \[in substances\]; but this cannot be so \[because\]

[^419]: as mentioned, ‘vacuum,’ ‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘soul’ are devoid of motion \(VSc 5.2.23\), and ‘soul,’ for instance, can exist in the soteriological state as deprived of specific qualities. 

[^420]: the beginning of the sentence can be translated with the ablative \(pañcamī vibhakti\), namely ‘because,’ ‘since,’ and ‘if.’

[^421]: ‘there will be only difference’ \(between oneness of substances and oneness of qualities\).

[^422]: ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ do not characterise perishable effect-products; they seem to characterise essences, and substances that have a permanent nature, however abstract these may be; thus, we may say giving that ‘time-space’ and ‘soul’ possess 

‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness,’ they possess as a result an all-pervasive nature that can show them to be one and many at the same time. 

[^423]: ‘causality’ and ‘substance’ are the most fundamental philosophical concepts in Vaiśeṣika. 

{{209}}

***7.2.8. if there is no oneness and ‘distinctness’ in cause and effect,  
there is no ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ \[separately either\]***

because of the dichotomy of cause and effect, there is no oneness of effect \[product\] and there is no ‘distinctness’ either, due to the absence of substratum other than the cause. 422

***7.2.9. this has been explained in regard to both  
permanence and impermanence***

although the subject-matter of the previous sūtra is the impermanent thing, this should be understood as explained in regard to permanent \[substances\] such as 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, in accordance with the potentiality \[of its existence\]; for example, between ‘vacuum’ and ‘sound,’ which are cause and effect, there is neither oneness nor ‘distinctness.’

***7.2.10. ‘conjunction’ is produced from one of the motions,  
both motions, and from a ‘conjunction’***

‘conjunction’ is produced from the motion of 1 of the 2 \[entities\]: the falcon’s activity of approaching a pillar; \[or\] when 2 wrestlers come together \[for a fight\]; 

‘conjunction’ is produced from \[either\] the 2 causes, \[or\] derived from a relation between an effect with non-effect,423 as for instance, when there is ‘conjunction’ 

of 2 fingers with the ‘vacuum-space’424 because of the 2 fingers’ ‘conjunctions’ 

with ‘vacuum.’

***7.2.11. in this way ‘disjunction’425*** *** is explained***

‘disjunction’ is produced from the motions of the 2 \[entities\]: that of a falcon when takes off \[from the pillar\]; \[‘disjunction’\] is produced from both motions of sheep departing \[from each other\]; but \[the ‘disjunction’\] produced from separation takes place when \[for instance\] 2 fingers are separated from each other 

\[or\] when the ‘vacuum-space’ between 2 fingers is obliterated, \[and\] there is a separation of the space between 2 fingers, through either cause or non-cause, for example, from the separation of the vacuum in hand there is separation of body-

fingers in ‘vacuum.’426

[^424]: ākāśa \(elsewhere translated as ‘vacuum’\) should not be confused with ‘space’ \(diś\), elsewhere translated as ‘direction.’

[^425]: as in other glosses, we have translated ‘vibhāga’ as ‘separation’ and ‘disjunction’ 

interchangeably. 

[^426]: VSc 7.2.11 contains 3 types of ‘disjunction’: when a thing goes away; when both things separate; and when there is a ‘disjunction’ there is another ‘disjunction.’

[^427]: as with other glosses, here ‘saṃyoga’ has been translated as ‘contact’ and conjunction’ interchangeably. 

[^428]: ‘largeness’ which is a form of universal is explained as not having ‘disjunction.’

[^429]: the sūtra is translated negatively by Ganesh Thite: ‘motions have no motions; qualities have no qualities.’

[^430]: Thite says that effect can exist without cause, after the cause disappears; the sūtra aims to prove the independent ontological reality of ‘contact’ and ‘separation’ without appealing to logical inference. 

{{211}}

***7.2.12. absence of ‘conjunction’427*** *** and ‘disjunction’ in  
\[another\] ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is not that the condition of these 2 exist because of an absence of combinations. 

***7.2.13. motions are \[explained\] by motions, qualities by qualities429***

the meaning of this sūtra is this: because there is absence of combination, these 

\[motions and qualities\] do not have ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’

***7.2.14. ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of cause and effect  
do not exist when there is no combination430***

the mutuality of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of cause and effect does not exist as in, for instance, between pot and potsherds, because of the absence of a pre-established combination; \[a\] pre-established combination means to have a separate moment of both, or one of the two, and that \[separate moment\] exists inherent in the combined permanent substances as well as impermanent substances, as, for instance, between a pot and cloth \[on the one hand\], and in the touch of the skin with earthly bodies \[on the other hand\]; there is no co-existence in the combination of pot and potsherds without inherence with the substratum, because pot is indeed inherent in these \[potsherds\];431 if you say that there is an \[inherent\] rela-

tion between word and meaning, then \[the answer is\] no,432

***7.2.15. because \[sound\] is a quality \[of vacuum\]433***

sound is not eternally joined with meaning, because it is \[only\] a quality of 

‘vacuum.’

[^431]: the gloss refers to the difference between yutasiddha and samavāya; it is a clear distinction between a combination of entities, and inherence between 2 concepts; see the saṃyoga and samavāya distinction. 

[^432]: Vaiśeṣika does not approve of the view according to which ‘meaning’ is intimately attached to the sound-word, for it wishes to stick to its own asatkāryavāda theory that words are ‘new’ and therefore language is always conventional not eternal, or pre-existent as the Mīmāṃsākas would acknowledge. 

[^433]: quality has no relation of combination with the substance; it can only inhere; ‘qualitiness’ \(guṇatva\) – which is used in the sūtra – is the state of having a quality, not only of being a quality.

[^436]: the previous gloss 7.2.14 speaks of a prayujate \(plunging\) with motions and effects, but this sūtra seems to contradict it. 

[^437]: the system reaffirms its commitment to realism; real connections cannot be made with mere concepts or to non-extant things; saṃyoga – the term used here – is referring only to the relation between real existentials.

with \[such\] quality.435

***7.2.17. and because \[qualities\] are devoid of activity436***

if there were ‘conjunction’ between ‘word’ with ‘meaning,’ sound would reach the meaning, \[but\] since meaning is inactive, the quality \[sound\] cannot move

there cannot be any ‘conjunction’ with ‘asat’ \[non-extant\]; 437 therefore, it is \[so\] 

because of the absence of ‘conjunction’ \[between sound and meaning\] -

stick and horn which are in ‘conjunction’ or inherent with both the possessor of stick and the possessor of horn, 440 this is visibly experienced; there is knowledge of meaning from sound, therefore, there must also be a contact with it \[meaning\]; 

\[response\] this is not so, 

[^438]: ‘artha’ within Vaiśeṣika’s realistic framework refers to ‘object’ and ‘meaning’ as well. 

[^439]: there is no gloss offered here by Candrānanda, and for the same sūtra Vādīndra glosses this only: ‘tasmād iti śeṣaḥ’ \(‘therefore this the remaining part’ may indicate that the commentator drew a final conclusion here, namely that language is not eternal, but only conventional, as the sūtra settled it\). 

[^440]: this is an objection contrary to Vaiśeṣika’s theory of language that does not see an intimate relation between ‘meaning’ and ‘sound.’

tasmāt sanketa nimittaḥ śabdād arthe pratyayo na saṃbandhāt /

[^441]: a question should be asked as to whether saṃbandha in Vaiśeṣika is a real ontological relation or a logico-inferential one. 

[^442]: the nature of language in Vaiśeṣika is radically different from the Mīmāṃsā’s; language is ‘conventional’ or artificial, that is to say, can be created by humans through new conventions.

***7.2.21. conceptualisation cannot be a condition  
\[derived\] from visibility \[only\]441***

impurity is that because of which there is the imperceptibility of the contact between the possessor of a stick and a possessor of horn; but if the contact \[between sound and meaning\] is imperceptible as already said, then the conceptualisation of meaning will not be made through contact \[between sound and meaning\]. 

***7.2.22. similarly, the absence of its conceptualisation \[is  
not a cause of the knowledge of meaning\]***

if there were a contact between meaning and word, then one who has not known the convention442 \[between them\] would understand the meaning from this \[word\]; 

***7.2.23. when you say that there is doubt because of the  
connection \[of vacuum\] with the connected \[sound\]***

\[objection\] now ‘vacuum’ is connected with ‘sound,’ and meaning \[is connected\] 

with ‘vacuum,’443 thus, due to the connection with the connected there is a subsistence with meaning; \[response\] this is not so, because all meanings are connected with ‘vacuum,’ there will be doubt regarding which meaning the word is used for, and there will be no knowledge; therefore, there is no subsistence \[between meaning and ‘vacuum’\], therefore –

***7.2.24. conceptualisation of meaning is because  
the meaning is conventional***

therefore, the conceptualisation is not because of a connection between meaning 

and word, \[but rather is caused\] by convention444

[^443]: This could be Mīmāṃsākas’ objection according to which meaning and word are eternal, being, as it were, connected with ākāśa. 

[^444]: The nature of word and meaning is thus not eternal as Mīmāṃsā maintains, but a convention settled by rules \(e.g. by grammarians such as Pāṇini\); in this respect, language, truth, and knowledge itself are ‘compositional’; the convention of words, as āhnika 6.2. made clear, is through the act of naming, by ṛṣis or God.

[^445]: On ‘buddhyapekṣam,’ see VSc 1.2.3 in conjunction with vyāvṛttibuddhi a specific cognitive function that has access to grasping the differentiated nature of things, VSc 1.2.6; namely to perceive things in their ultimate differentness; as Candrānanda says this type of cognition is produced in those seers \(tad darśināṁ\) who can draw such minute differentiations about the ultimate particularities, specifically about those things that have an indistinguishable shape and quality \(vartamānāstulyākṛtiguṇeṣu\). 

See ārṣajñāna VSc 9.28. 

[^446]: to be ‘dependent on cognition’ means that cognition mediated by the atomic mind distinguishes between pairs of opposite ontological categories, as well as in successive units, which follow one another. If there is something that defines the original

***7.2.25. ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ exist because of nearness and  
remoteness in relation to both ‘time’ and ‘space’***

when there are 2 balls having 1 direction, then ‘space-direction’ is the cause of their ‘near’ and ‘distant’ \[position in space and time\]; 2 things belonging to the same ‘time’ and connected with the present \[tense\] become \[the\] cause of 

‘remoteness’ and ‘proximity’ caused by ‘time’; and \[the illusion\] of these 2 balls is caused by and is dependent upon the ‘cognition’445 of nearness and remoteness. 

***7.2.26. because of the remoteness of cause and  
because of the nearness of cause***

‘conjunction’ between the remote and near location is a non-inherent cause; in a similar way, there is ‘conjunction’ of remote-and-near-‘space’ and posterior-and-prior-‘time’; due to the ‘conjunction’ between the near and distant balls with location in ‘time,’ there is near and nearness, and because there is remote there will be remoteness \[which notions\] are dependent upon a cognition of \[the concept\] near 

and the distant.446

***7.2.27. minuteness and largeness are explained because  
of the absence of the prior and posterior of  
proximity and remoteness \[of existentials\]447***

the cause of ‘proximity’ and ‘remoteness’ \[is established\] by the connections between prior and posterior \[things\] located in ‘space’ and ‘time’; and concerning these 2 things, because there is no intimate relation and because there is no ‘conjunction,’ \[then\] there is no \[concept of\] prior and posterior \[either\]. 

***7.2.28. motions are \[explained\] by means of motions,  
qualities are \[explained\] by means of qualities***

just as ‘motion’ and ‘quality’448 are devoid of minuteness and boundless, so also 

‘motion’ and ‘quality’ are devoid of ‘consequence’ and ‘non-consequence’ due to the absence of a ‘conjunction’ with the location in ‘time’ \[and\] ‘space’ of the 

‘existential’ \(bhāva\) with which \[conjunction\] is associated. 

mentality of the Vaiśeṣika system, then it is precisely this kind of reasoning: dualistic epistemology in a successive expanded pluralistic world. That is not to say that synchronic and intuitive thinking is missing in this system; successive reasoning defines the normal perception, while simultaneous, synchronic, and intuitive thinking define the ‘supernatural’ forms of knowledge such as ‘ārṣajñāna’ mentioned in VSc 9.28. 

[^447]: ‘existentials’ are not explicitly mentioned here; Vaiśeṣika students need familiarisa-tion not only with the odd Sanskrit syntax but also with the style of this darśana as well. 

[^448]: ‘karmaguṇa’ has been translated here not as a compound as it elsewhere in this commentary, but rather as 2 different nouns.

[^449]: inherence of ‘particularity’ in ‘universality’ is a doctrine that explains the web of interrelations that exists in the worldview of this system; there are no longer enigmas, or contradictions between particular and universal; the interrelatedness of the two is something that has been developed in other Middle Eastern traditions too \(Hebrew, Syriac, Islamic Sufi\). 

[^450]: ‘inherence’ explains that ‘real’ or ‘existential’ \(bhava\) is something other than the real categories of substance, quality, and motion, because reality is something that 

{{219}}

***7.2.29. cause-effect inherence is when ‘that \[is  
conceptualised\] here’ \[‘hic et nunc’\]***

qualities and so forth are inherent in substance; therefore \[Kaṇāda\] explains inherence as follows: it is that because of which there is conceptualisation of a cause-effect \[relation\] produced \[as expressed in the sentences\] ‘here in the threads there is cloth, here in the pot there is colour and so forth, here in the pot there is motion,’ 

this is co-existence; the knowledge of cause-effect is only indicative \[in the sentences\] ‘there is co-existence of generality in individuality, \[and co-existence\] of particularities in permanent substances,’449 this is how \[inherence\] has been stated. 

***7.2.30. obstruction between substantiality, qualitiness, and  
motionness is explained by existentiality450***

just as ‘substance’ is not one and the same \[existential\] with ‘substantiality,’ 

because it subsists in quality and motion and is not a real \[to be confused with\] 

motion and quality, so also ‘inherence’ is \[explained\]. 451

***7.2.31. also, that \[inherence\]452 is suchness***

just as the reality of oneness is because of non-particularity \[of visible marks\],453 

similarly, there is one inherence without specific marks as regard the \[experience of\] ‘hic et nunc’454 which is devoid of re-occurrence, has no parts, and is permanent. 

**// this is the seventh chapter //**

defines all 3 categories; see also VS 1.1.14 and other essential sūtra on reality, sattā, and bhāva. 

[^451]: ‘inherence’ \(samavāya\) is defined as a real independent category. 

[^452]: see sūtra 7.2.29. 

[^453]: oneness and universality are coextensive with the sādharmyic cognition; it focuses on simplicity of the abstract substances and entities in general. 

[^454]: ‘hic et nunc’ type of experience may be a form of intuition that ultimately leads to the knowledge of ‘tattva,’ which in certain contexts has been translated with ‘essence.’
