[^455]: likewise, VSc 1.1.6, Candrānanda re-confirms that the categories are 6 \(not 7 as in later Vaiśeṣika, for instance in Śivāditya’s Saptapadārthī which adds ‘abhāva’ as the seventh padārtha \[SP 3\]\). This shows that Candrānanda’s commentary is a more traditional and faithful rendering of the original tenets of the system. 

[^456]: ‘substance’ \(dravya\) is the most important category in Vaiśeṣika, a system that we could define to be an example of ‘substantialist philosophy’; sūtra 8.4 overempha-sises this view by saying that: ‘substance is the cause, and the cause of causes,’ which means that substance is the ‘ultimate reality,’ or the ‘essence’ of reality \(sattā\); what is aimed at by this system is an ‘essential knowledge,’ and the nature of substance is the ultimate form of such knowledge; to understand it better, one should consider reading Vaiśeṣika in contradistinction to Buddhist schools such as Mādhyamikā.

**/ the eighth chapter /**

now ‘cognition’ is explained

***8.1. knowledge is explained in regard to substances***

among the 6 categories, 455 knowledge is explained only in relation to substances,456 

and perception is that which produces it, yet, \[perception\] is not for the sake of qualities and so forth \[but rather for the sake of substances\]; 457 of these \[he says\]. 

***8.2. and ‘soul’ and ‘mind’ \[is the cause of knowledge\]***

causation of knowledge \[its production\] is explained as \[between\] ‘mind’ and 

‘soul’; now \[he\] says \[something\] regarding the knowledge in relation to qualities, and so forth. 

***8.3. it is said that production of knowledge is the ***

***indication of a detailed knowledge458***

because it has been said that the production of knowledge is \[made\] by the close contact with senses, qualities, and so forth, being not in contact with \[these\] 

senses, therefore, knowledge is now said \[to exist\] in relation to that \[knowledge 

by\] distant contact between these, that is \[by\] discernment,459 because, –

[^457]: ‘cognition’ refers to the ultimate form of knowledge, such as yogipratyakṣa, which targets the comprehension of the ultimate essences of substances, in relation to which qualities are secondary as they do not represent the main project of Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology; perception does not stop at the surface of things \(qualities\), it aims rather at the knowledge of substances and their essences. 

[^458]: ‘knowledge’ is real because being an effect, and given the theory of asatkāryavāda, all effects are ‘real new things.’

[^459]: vijñāna is a higher form of knowledge, perhaps that which relies on vaidharmya, see also parijñāna in VSc 1.1.6.

[^460]: there seem to be qualitative levels of perception; the basic one is the perception by senses, a more superior one however is ‘discernment,’ which grasps entities and their essences through a form of supra-sense perception \(atīndriya\). 

[^461]: on antyaviśeṣa, see VSc 1.2.6. 

[^462]: sāmānya and viśeṣa do not subsist in another sāmānya and viśeṣa, for otherwise the proof will fall into infinite regression. 

{{223}}

***8.4. when qualities and motions are not near \[our senses\] ***

***we say that substance is the cause for the production ***

***of \[our\] knowledge, and the cause of causes***

because substance is the inherent cause of qualities and motions, then in relation to these, there is production of discernment with the sense-organs which are in direct contact with the perception which is the cause \[of that discernment\],460 

and neither substance nor quality nor motion are the cause \[of that perceptive contact\] therefore, the knowledge of qualities and motions is produced from the co-existence with the contacted \[thing\], and the word ‘ca’ \[in the sūtra\] is used in the sense of cause \[of knowledge\]. 

***8.5. because of the absence of the ‘universal’ and ‘particularity’ ***

***in universality and particularity, from that, only, we know ***

***the knowledge \[concerning the ‘universal particularity’\]***

‘sattā’ is first and foremost a universal, regarding the ‘particularities’ and ‘ultimate particularity,’461 those \[seers\] who perceive them, the production of the knowledge \[about them\] is solely by contact with the substance-essence, and not because of \[another\] universal and particularity for these are absent in them \[universal and particularity\]; 462 but as regards the other concept \[‘universal particularity’\] \[Kaṇāda says\]

***8.6. concerning substance, quality, and motion \[the knowledge ***

***of these\] is dependent on ‘universal particularity’463***

substance, quality, motion \[are known\] because of the power of the sense-perception with substances, and because of the universal particularity and so forth, which \[like any real\] has a beginning464 \[and\] which has both particularity and universality, such as the substance and so forth have, this is how knowledge is produced; in this sūtra, ‘sattā’ is universal \[sāmānya\], ‘viśeṣa’ means existential-substantiality and so forth, \[but\] in an earlier sūtra it is \[explained\] differently; 

\[knowledge\] in relation to substance is based upon substance, quality, and motion, moreover, 

[^463]: because sūtra does not contain the particle ‘ca,’ we take the view that Kaṇāda refers here to a third concept, namely ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’ \(universal particularity\) which is the 

‘real’ contained by both ontological levels, viśeṣa as well as sāmānya; it is chiefly due to this concept that a substance is explained as both one and many. 

[^464]: ‘universal’ is created when the substance is created, meaning that it exists prior to the origination of the differentiated state of substance.

[^465]: it shows that dravya could be better translated by ‘essence’ so as to be differentiated from substance, quality, and motion. 

[^466]: the prevalence and importance of the meaning ‘dravya’ has already been asserted as the basis on which the whole structure of reality is built, followed by ‘lesser’ categories such as ‘qualities’ and ‘motions’; the use of ‘dravyapekṣam’ \(dependent on the substance\) is a case in point. 

[^467]: a more literal translation would be: substances are ‘comprehended prior’ to adjectives; needless to say, that the goal of the system is to grasp the ultimate reality and essence of things which is to be found in the concept of ‘dravya.’

{{225}}

***8.7. \[knowledge\] concerning substance465*** *** is based ***

***upon substance, quality, and motion***

knowledge of substance is due to the contact with \[the\] eye, \[and\] is dependent on ‘universality’ and ‘particularity’466 as for example \[in the sentence\] ‘\[something\] possessing horns is dependent on a quality for example “white,” which is equally dependent on the motion “goes,”’ in this way \[knowledge\] is produced; substances and so forth are comprehended first because of the adjective,467 by this, the cognition of adjective \[qualifier\] which is an effect, is conducive to the cognition of the qualified \[thing\]. 

***8.8. because there is absence of quality and motion in ***

***\[other\] qualities and motions, \[knowledge\] is not ***

***dependent on \[subsequent\] qualities and motions***

since there is absence of qualities and motions in \[other\] qualities and motions, there is no possibility for the knowledge of qualities and motions to be the instrumental \[cause\] of \[the knowledge\] of \[other\] qualities and motions; there is a rule concerning the prior production of the knowledge of substances; 468 as for 

example –

***8.9. knowledge of white is from whiteness, which is inherent ***

***\[in white\], because of the ‘cognition’ of whiteness, there is ***

***‘cognition’ of white \[thing\], these are cause-effect existentials***

because the universal white is inherent in the ‘quality white’ and from the knowledge of the ‘universality of white’ the cognition of the quality of whiteness is 

\[subsequently\] generated, it should also be considered that there is a connection between universal and quality; 469therefore, the cognition of the adjective is the cause, \[while\] the cognition of the qualified is the effect; but regarding the absence of the adjective \[specifier\] and the specified \[thing\] \[Kaṇāda says\] –

[^468]: it may refer to the intuitive perception that is not mediated by inference; as we shall see, in later Vaiśeṣika literature there is direct and indirect perception; for instance, Vādīndra’s VSv gloss on 3.1.20 \(short version p. 37\) differentiates between ‘indeterminate’ \(nirvikalpapratyakṣa\) versus ‘determinate’ \(savikalpapratyakṣa\); see also Candrānanda’s VSc 9.28 which distinguishes between siddhadarśana and ārṣajñāna, whereas PD of Praśastapāda \(pp. 186\) talks about a ‘simple perception’ 

\(svarūpālocanamātra\) as opposed to ‘differentiated perception’ \(savikalpa\). 

[^469]: on the connection between sāmānya and guṇa, see the chapter on guṇa in Halbfass 1992: 113–37.

[^470]: since both sentences are in the ablative, being as it were in a relation of correspondence, the sūtra has been translated with the conditional ‘if.’

{{227}}

***8.10. if there is no mutual causality among substances, ***

***there is no simultaneity of their cause \[either\]470***

because of the minuteness of ‘mind,’ and because of the absence of \[its\] simultaneity, although there is a sequence \[of cognitions\], still, there is no cause-effect relationship between cognitions of pot and cloth, because there is no link between a specifier and specified. 

***8.11. similarly, regarding substances, qualities, and motions ***

***\[these do not stand in a cause-effect relation\] due ***

***the absence of \[their own\] specific cause***

even though, in \[the sentence\] ‘the white cow goes’ the cognitions of substance, quality, \[and\] motion are being produced in a sequence, still, there is \[an\] absence of \[a\] cause-effect relationship because of the absence \[of a relation\] between a specifier and the specified thing, this reasoning, as stated earlier, is \[applicable\] 

without any difference; therefore, the cognition of substance is not the cause of the cognition of quality and motion, nor is the cognition of quality and motion a cause of another \[thing\]; however, regarding the absence of \[the rule concerning\] 

the adjectival specifier \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***8.12. ‘this one is this,’ ‘you have done,’ ‘feed him,’ \[all ***

***these rules\] are dependent on ‘cognition’***

‘ayam’ indicates \[something\] which is near, and ‘eṣaḥ’ is the perception of something \[slightly\] remote, ‘kṛtam tvayā’ indicates the experience of the doer and doing-activity, ‘bhojayainam’ indicates subject and object \[relation\]; the conceptualisation of the remote \[thing\] is dependent on that of the near \[thing\],471 in the word ‘kṛtam’ there is knowledge concerning a subject dependent on object, in the sentence ‘bhojaya’ there is knowledge concerning the object dependent on a subject; if the \[question is as to\] why there is a relation of dependence, \[then Kaṇāda says this\]

[^471]: as in many instances, aṇutva, mahattva, permanence and impermanence, proximity and remoteness, these dual concepts mutually imply each other in Vaiśeṣika logic and epistemology, whereby one point of reference implies another; the system is a dualistic epistemology in a pluralistic ontology.

[^472]: ‘noun’ and ‘adjective’ might indicate the viśeṣa and viśiṣṭa categories of Dvaita Vedānta, which play an important role in the grammar and ontology of both Vaiśeṣika and Dvaita schools. 

[^473]: word ‘artha’ refers to ‘subject-matter’ \(object-matter\) which in this gloss is under cognitive scrutiny. 

[^474]: artha refers here to padārtha \(ontological categories\); the 3 basic categories here are the first 3 padārtha: dravya, guṇa, and karma. 

{{229}}

***8.13. \[cognition is possible\] regarding visible \[things\] ***

***due to their existentiality, \[and cognition of\] unseen ***

***things is due to their non-existentiality***

as far as a visible thing is concerned, there are cognitions of remoteness and so forth in things which are near and so forth, but in relation to unseen things, however, although they are dependent, they are not cause and effect because there is no jointness between a ‘specified’ and ‘specifier’;472 while the cognitions are 

dependent on objects and sense-organs, now, the object is being described –

***8.14. \[word\] ‘artha’473 is used in regard to ***

***substance, quality, \[and\] motion***

even if the universal lacks any object \[to be known\], the word ‘artha’ is fully explained after having been established only in regard to the 3 categories, substance, and so forth;474 where \[is it that established\]? just as the universal and particular are devoid of other universality, so also regarding the reality of the universal of things and so forth, these are \[indicated\] by the knowledge \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘universal is from being universal,’ similarly, particularity being another ‘existential’ \[is expressed in the sentence\] ‘particularity is from particularity,’ and this is the discernment of those seers; in the same way, in the word substance, and so forth, the word ‘artha’ is used in a technical sense, even if 

\[substance, and so forth\] are not the subject of discussion; sense-organs are also described, and they are not \[to be confused with\] the group of 5 \[mahābhūtas\] 

because –

***8.15. regarding the substances, they are \[tied up\] ***

***with the nature of the five-fold group475***

because things at their inception are known not to have the 5 great elements \[as their cause\], but the 4 elements are those which generate their own genera, in the same way, the sense-organs have their function fixed \[to their specific\] ele-

ments;476 thus, \[he\] says –

[^475]: the group of 5 refers to the 5 mahābhūtas. 

[^476]: the gloss seems to discuss the levels of supervenience of the evolution of the cosmos, first substances \(essences\), second mahābhūtas \(elements\), and then the senses that correspond to each of the elements \(e.g. one particular sense is for ‘earth,’ another sense is for ‘water,’ and so forth\); the next sūtra, by using the ablative \(pañcamī vibhakti\), explains how these senses are ‘attached’ or ‘fixed’ to each element.

**// aṣṭamo’dhyāyaḥ //**

[^477]: bhūyastva is ‘abundance, plentifulness, majority, preponderance’ in \(Apte dict.: 1204\). 

[^478]: like Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivāda’s ontology, Vaiśeṣika draws an ontological distinction between the ‘function of senses’ \(e.g. smelling\), ‘senses’ as such \(e.g. nose-smell\), and the ‘objects of senses’ \(e.g. earth\). 

[^479]: once again, the category of viśeṣa comes into play, without which the real ontological distinction between ‘functions’ of smelling, ‘sense-organs’ of smelling, ‘qualities,’ and ‘substances’ cannot be conceived; such differentiations would be ultimately known by a sub-category known by the label of ‘dharmaviśeṣa.’

[^480]: ‘vacuum exists independently’ means that it is not an inherent cause as is the case with ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air,’ which are the inherent cause for taste, eye, and touch, respectively. 

{{231}}

***8.16. ‘earth’ is known when there is comprehension ***

***of ‘smell,’ due to \[its\] density477***

knowledge of smell \[of ‘earth’\] by smelling is caused by ‘earth’ when it is produced due to the density which is \[judged\] interdependently with the body; and having density, the smell of ‘earth’ is not comprehended by \[other organs\], leg and so forth; and being possessed by smell, and since smelling is inherent in it 

\[‘earth’\], the sense-organ of smell indicates the smell \[of earth\]; and this earth, having smell, is itself the cause; however, the other elements are connected \[with 

this\] only to a little extent.478

***8.17. similarly, there is knowledge of ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ and ***

***‘touch,’ as regards ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ due to ***

***the particular479*** *** ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ \[and\] ‘touch’***

by means of ‘form-colour’ we have the shining, by means of ‘taste’ we have the sweet which is inherent \[in the cake offering\] and it is not harnessed by the \[cooking process\], by means of ‘touch’ we have that which is cold, hot, and not-cooked, tongue, eye, and touch-organ \[of skin\] these indicate ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ \[and\] ‘touch,’ 

therefore due to tastiness, shape, \[and\] touchiness, due to the causes which are non-affected by other elements, and because of their amplitude in relation to the 3 sense-organs, therefore, ‘water,’ ‘lustre, \[and\]’ ‘air’ are to be considered as inherent causes; but, as regards ‘vacuum’ this exists independently, 480 \[for\] 

hearing is characterised by the cavity of the ear \[vacuum\], not by the lobe of the 

ear,481 because \[the lobe\] is not the root element \[to be perceived\] and \[hearing\] 

does not originate in the ear-organ \[but in ‘vacuum’\]; 482 thus, perception has been explained. 

**// the eighth chapter //**

[^481]: the gloss renders explicit the importance of the knowledge of the essence of the substances in their very subtle nature \(antyaviśeṣa, dharmaviśeṣa\); when it is said that 

‘hearing is characterised by the cavity of the ear’ the commentator must refer to the empty ‘space’ which is the substance ‘vacuum’; in other words, the essence of sound and hearing is ‘vacuum.’

[^482]: śabda which stands for ‘sound’ and ‘word’ is therefore explained as a quality of the substance ‘vacuum,’ therefore, its origin should be sought not in an instrumental cause \(ear\) but rather in its ultimate cause which is the substance ‘vacuum’; the earlier ontological distinction between ‘functions’ of senses, organs of ‘senses,’ and ‘object’ 

of senses, finds its utility here, namely by detecting the substance that is the ‘root-cause’ of any sense-perceptive manifestation.
