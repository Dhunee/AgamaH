[^270]: to ‘possess a beginning’ \(ādimattvāt\) means to have a compositional existence out of which the existential is emerging and exists. 

[^271]: reference is approximate; an effort should be made to trace the references that the editor Muni Jambūvijayaji could not find. 

[^272]: the substratum of the quality ‘effort’ is ‘soul.’

{{149}}

***4.2.8. \[their fix designation\] is because they possess signs-***

***references and other \[particular characteristics\]***

it is on account of perception that the names are granted by men after seeing the object, such as the birth of Aṅgiras \[from coal\], it is \[how\] names ‘Aṅgiras’ and so forth are \[given\]; therefore, a proper noun is meaningful because of possessing 

designations, names, and so forth;270 hence, 

***4.2.9. \[bodies\] not born of womb are referred by Vedic \[scriptures\]***

there are particular bodies not born of womb because there is an indication in the Vedas: ‘moon is born of mind’ \[Rig Veda 10.90\]271 thus, the body consisting of 

‘water’ is certainly not born of womb; however, the body consisting of ‘earth’ can be womb-born, as well as not womb-born. 

**// the fourth chapter / the section on substance is completed //**


**/the first lesson of the fifth chapter /**

thus, having described the substances, \[and\] having sketched out the qualities \[he\] 

speaks of motions for there should be little to be said \[concerning these\]; \[and\] 

with regard to that, \[Kaṇāda\] says:

***5.1.1. motion in the hand is because of a ***

***‘conjunction’ of the ‘soul’ with ‘effort’***

motion is caused because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘soul’ and hand at the beginning of an activity, \[and it is\] because ‘effort’ is dependent on a connection with its own substratum272; \[and\] since the cause is dependent on a ‘conjunction,’ ‘effort’ 

too is a cause; hence, motion in hand is because of these two \[causes\]. 

***5.1.2. similarly, the motion of a pestle is due to a connection with a hand***

such as ‘numbers’ have extension only, 273 so also the connection between hand and pestle is caused by a previous chain of \[differentiated\] activities which is 

‘effort’; 274 in the activity of the pestle however, the connection of ‘soul’ and hand is not an inherent cause of the activity of \[the\] pestle, because \[cause\] is already proved from a connection of hand conjoined with ‘soul.’

[^273]: in the sense that they point to a sequence: ‘atideśa’ \(grammatical rule about the extension of properties\). 

[^274]: The pūrvadhikṛta type of argument is meant to prove the argument for the existence of the souls, as derived from the doer of the effort.

[^275]: in other words, if we read the sūtra as a continuation of the preceding sūtra, 

‘hastotpatanakarmaṇi’ are different from ‘ātmasaṃyoga.’

[^276]: ‘then’ is missing here, but we can translate ‘cet’ with ‘then.’

[^277]: saṃyoga refers to the involuntary and non-conscious motion produced by reflex, not by a connection with soul volition. 

[^278]: ‘soul’ cannot have motion in itself, for all motions are secondary and happen because of ātman being connected with other things such as the hand \(one should also consider saṃyukta-samavāya ‘inferential induction’ by which things can be explained to happen\). 

{{151}}

***5.1.3. \[motion\] produced by the stroke from the activities of pestle is different ***

***from the ‘conjunction’ with hand which does not cause \[motions\]***

when a speedy thing is connected with a stroke, the \[impulsive\] upwards activity of the pestle is produced because it strikes the mortar, \[thus\] the ‘conjunction’ 

of hand and pestle is not the cause \[of that activity\] because it vanishes \[imme-diately\] after the stroke of made by a previous ‘effort’; similarly, the absence of intention \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘let the pestle substance go up’ \[indicates\] the absence of the relation of ‘intention-effort’ with generating a quality and motion, because the contact between hand and pestle is not dependent on 

‘effort’ which is absent, therefore ‘effort’, is not the cause of upwards movement 

\[but rather the impulse\]. 

***5.1.4. similarly, the motions of hand and pestle \[is not ***

***the cause\] of the ‘conjunction’ with ‘soul’275***

just as the connection of pestle and hand is not a cause \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘the jumping up of hand is co-extensive with \[the\] pestle,’ similarly, the connection between ‘soul’ and hand is not a cause \[of impulse\] either, because connection is dependent on \[something else\] and because of the absence of ‘effort’ 

due to the absence of intention \[as in the sentence\] ‘let the hand go upwards with 

\[the\] pestle’; if you ask why these 2 bumpings \[happen\], then276 \[the answer is this\]:

***5.1.5. but motion in hand is because of a stroke-with-pestle ***

***\[as well as\] because of a connection-with-pestle277***

the stroke of the mortar causes the jump-up motion of \[the\] pestle; the connection of hand with pestle however, is dependent on the activity of hand which is the cause of the pestle’s speed \[but\] the stroke is not the inherent cause \[of hand activities\]

***5.1.6. \[that motion is\] additionally due to a motion of the ***

***‘self’ when in ‘conjunction’ with the hand278***

‘ātman’ refers here to one part of body, 279 for just as the motion of the pestle in hand is not experienced \[by soul\], so also - because the connection with the parts of the hand \[motion\] is dependent on the speed of the hand at the time of the upwards going of the hand - motion is produced in that part without being \[inten-

tionally\] experienced \[by soul\].280

[^279]: Candrānanda explains that in this gloss, ātman refers to the embodied ‘soul’ or that which is seen as forming a part with the body

[^280]: the commentator draws a distinction between voluntary motions and involuntary motions; he draws attention to the fact that, when it is said that ātman moves, this refers to the ‘embodied self,’ not to the substance ‘soul’ which, as gloss 5.2.23 clarifies, is devoid of motion.

[^281]: a third form of motion, besides the conscious-voluntary and the unconscious-involuntary one, is the motion caused by the natural law of ‘gravitation,’ which again is not triggered by human will. 

[^282]: here the causality takes us from the physical to the psychological causes. 

[^283]: it refers to action-reaction type of forces, see Newton’s Third Law of Motion that explains that forces always come in pairs of action-reaction. 

[^284]: this shows the extent to which ‘the psychological’ can influence ‘the physical’; questions concerning the nature of this volition in Vaiśeṣika, and whether it has a free choice or deliberative connotation may be considered in relation to Aristotle’s thought \(EN 3.2–4; EE 2.6–10; Rhet. 1.4–7\).

***5.1.7. falling is due to the absence of \[any\] connection because of ‘weight’***

falling takes place because of ‘weight’ when the connection between pestle and hand ceases due to \[their\] disconnection

***5.1.8. in the absence of a specific impulse, neither ***

***upwards, nor oblique movement \[can happen\]***

bouncing \[happens\] through a specific connection dependent upon an ‘effort’ with speed and impulse; and when there is no intentional stimulation there is neither impulse, nor upwards \[motion\], nor oblique \[motion\], \[but\] bouncing is due to 

‘weight’ alone;281 how is \[this\] specific impulse \[produced\]? 

***5.1.9. a specific impulse is from a specific ‘effort’***

when \[I, for instance, say\] ‘I throw this here’ that produces a ‘conjunction’ \[with\] 

‘effort’ which is \[in turn\] produced by a ‘particular volition’ from which there is the production of a ‘conjunction,’ namely the pushing away or removal of the substance such as hand and so forth from another substance.282

***5.1.10. a specific upwards throwing \[can happen\] ***

***because of a specific pushing283***

specific pushing which is produced from the ‘effort’ which is characterised by 

‘volition’ of throwing away produces the act of throwing to a remote place. 284

***5.1.11. boyish activity has been explained in respect to a hand-motion***

whatever palpitation in the womb and so forth, happens in accordance with \[something\] dependent on ‘effort’ that was previously co-experienced by the ‘biological life’285 in one part of the body; 286 but the group of activities of the mother, happens due to an ‘unseen force’ related to the ‘self’ \[which force however is\] not experi-

enced by the embryo.287

[^285]: adṛṣṭa has therefore the power to influence the soul’s ‘effort’ and subsequently the individual ‘subtle body’ \(śarīraikadeśa\) which is forced to move out of the womb; here we might see an allusion to involuntary abortion, happened because of adṛṣṭa. 

[^286]: See VSc 5.1.6. where ātman is defined as a part of the body, or as simply the ‘embodied ātman.’

[^287]: this gloss refers to the condition of bondage, which the womb of the mother and the word itself both represent; in both these two conditions the law that affects the beings is the inauspicious dharma \(adṛṣṭa\); reality and liberation would be to escape from the bondage condition of the womb which is the world itself.

[^288]: Kaṇāda may refer here to the thunder noise produced from a flash-burning in the clouds. 

[^289]: sūtra presents types of actions that are by reflex not by ‘conscious activity’ or ‘effort.’

[^290]: this is not due to a conscious motion but rather a physical realistic motion not caused by ‘effort.’

{{155}}

***5.1.12. thunder \[has been explained\] from an eruption, ***

***burning288 \[has been explained\] likewise289***

when the mind is busy with something else, that act of going away takes place regarding the burnt hand, that happens also because of a relation between hand and ‘soul’ dependent on ‘effort’ \[and\] preceded by ‘life’;290 and this is not by \[controlled\] conscious conceptualisation. 

***5.1.13. falling \[of the body\] during sleep is due to ‘weight,’ ***

***\[and\] because of the absence of ‘effort’291***

in the absence of the ‘effort’ of the body, the act of falling of some limbs \[e.g. 

hand, leg\] of a sleepy person takes place because of gravity-‘weight,’ due to the 

absence of \[any\] relation \[between ‘effort’ and ‘self’\].292

***5.1.14. motion of grass \[happens\] due to a connection with ‘air’***

motion of grass and so forth, is due to a connection between grass and ‘air’ 

dependent on speed, these \[happen\] without \[the involvement of any\] ‘effort.’

***5.1.15. going of a gem, the approaching of needle, these ***

***are \[motions\] caused by the ‘unseen force’***

the gem going towards thief and so forth, and the needle \[movement\] towards magnet, the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that \[they have been\] made by ‘dharma’ 

and ‘adharma.’

***5.1.16. the specific ‘conjunctions’ which are non-***

***simultaneousness when an arrow \[moves\] is the proof ***

***of other \[kind of\] motion \[which is successive\]***

\[one\] motion \[happens\] first because of an impulse, \[and\] the many motions of an arrow are produced because of a ‘latent impetus’; 293 yet, because the first motions exist and are not connected with ‘vacuum,’ which \[causes them to\] disappear,294 

therefore, the subsequent motions \[formed\] with ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ 

would not be produced later, therefore motion is many. 

[^291]: a clear indication about the ‘law of gravity’ that in Western philosophy would be discovered and formalised by Newton. 

[^292]: it refers to an action produced from an unconscious situation, in the absence of a 

sense-object relation – for instance, the absence of conscious perception of the 4-fold contact between soul, mind, senses, and object. 

[^293]: although there is impulse at the beginning of a motion, however, the series of many movements are coordinated by another force, saṃskāra. 

[^294]: motion is not continuous but fragmented in successive fractions.

\[the\] first act of pushing is therefore explained as being produced by the ‘conjunction’ of a string with an arrow which necessitates ‘effort’ or the pressure of a bow string, \[but\] the spreading over \[of the arrow’s first motion\] is made by the 

‘latent impetus,’295 being independent of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’; consequently, pushing comes to an end because of a ‘disjunction’ due to a relation with the motion, \[and\] the effect produced from the first motion is withdrawn \[which shows\] that the subsequent and the latter motions of \[the\] arrow are \[all\] operated by the ‘latent impetus’ \[and\] this \[repetition\] is being indicated by \[this sūtra\]. 

***5.1.18. falling is due to ‘weight’ \[regardless\] the ***

***absence of a ‘latent impetus’296***

when there is a loss of ‘impetus’ with \[its\] connection between substances possessed by touch, \[then\]the motion of falling has ‘weight’ as \[its\] cause. 

**// the first lesson of the fifth chapter //**



**/ the second lesson of the fifth chapter/**

having stated the motions concerning the ‘embodied soul’ and those related to it, he comments upon the motions of the great elements –

***5.2.1. earth-motion is due to an impulse and a stroke, as ***

***well as to a conjunction with the conjunct***

a particular conjunction dependent on ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ speed, \[and\] ‘effort,’ 

combined and manifold, is the cause of motions due to pushing that is impelling, being the cause for non-‘disjunction,’ that is the ‘impulse,’ such as, for instance, when ‘earth’ called mud is pushed by a foot and so forth; motion takes place in the earth; ‘stroke’ means a connection dependent on ‘speed’ \[and\] is the cause of motion which is the reason for the ‘disjunction’ of something which is struck by strokes, for example due to the stroke of a chariot’s \[wheels\] with different portions of ‘earth’ and so forth, motions are seen; due to the conjunction of something connected by something pushed and something struck, motions take place because of a conjunction with the conjoint. 

[^296]: Kaṇāda recognises 2 different forces: saṃskāra and gurutva \(gravitation\); see earlier gloss 5.1.17, where there is a difference between ‘impulse’ \(nodana\) and ‘latent impetus’ \(saṃskāra\) too; hence, there could be 3 motions: \(1\) first-motion-impetus; \(2\) ‘latent impetus’ \(which happens after the first-motion\); and \(3\) gravitation due to weight.

***5.2.2. \[all\] these are caused by a specific ‘unseen force’***

whatever motion such as an earthquake and so forth in the entire earth – because of a connection with ‘air’ having conflicting motion – is produced in order to indicate the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of beings, that is caused by a specific ‘unseen’ force, for it indicates the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of all \[beings\]. 

***5.2.3. falling of ‘water’ is because of ‘weight’ \[and\] due to the ***

regarding the prosperity of crops, or \[their\] loss, \[these\] are produced by the

***5.2.6. \[waters’\} ascension \[happens\] because of ***

***a connection of ‘wind’ with rays***

‘nādi’ refers to ‘rays,’ and sun has 2 kinds of rays: bright and shining; the bright one takes the ‘water,’ \[while\] the shining one causes growth; the ascension is dependent on the ‘effort’ of the sun, which is joint with the ‘air’ called pure vein 

‘nādi.’

[^300]: vidhāraka stands for a cosmic authority, either personalised or not, which derives from the first-class stem dhṛ \(related to the concept of Ṛta and dharma\); it is thought that each of the elements is kept unified by a cosmic law. 

[^301]: ‘water’ being an eternal substance can subsist in itself, and the unity of its parts is maintained by either the atomic law to which Vaiśeṣika ascribes, or by ‘ṛta’ \(a ‘specific dharma’ that characterises all cosmic components, either concrete or abstract\); thus, it not certain whether water is upheld because of a \[transcendental\] upholder, yet, Vaiśeṣika distinguishes between the physical motions and metaphysical motions.

***mark \[of lustre’s activity\] therein***

‘lustre exists in the ethereal waters’ this \[sentence refers to\] ‘lustre,’ and the act of water descending from the clouds, that is ‘thunder’ \[and\] is the mark of ‘lustre.’

***5.2.11. and \[these phenomena\] are Vedic \[evidence\]***

‘the \[waters\] which held fire forcefully as an embryo’ \[Atharva Veda 1.33.1\]305 this 

Vedic sentence is the mark of the ‘lustre’ \[subsisting\] in the heavenly waters. 306

[^305]: quote traced back from Bloomfield’s Vedic Concordance; the edition of Jambūvijayaji \(Baroda 1961\), lacks such references, therefore every effort should be made to fill such lacunae. 

[^306]: ‘heavenly waters’ \(āpas\), but Āpaḥ is in Vedic astrology a feminine deity, and a per-sonification of Water, who presides over the Pūrvāṣāḍhās ‘asterism’ \(nakṣatra\); the deity has therefore a motherly function because only mothers can contain water like an embryo; waters according to this cosmogonic myth, cover and contain the golden embryo that is symbolised by lustre.

[^307]: substance ‘air’ is a broader concept than its local activities such as ‘wind’; thus, ‘wind’ 

may be seen as a component of ‘air,’ just as, for instance, ‘activity’ is a component of the substance ‘motion’; the commentator does not use different terminology for this ontological distinction. 

[^308]: one hypothetical reading would be that the ‘selves’ to which the commentary alludes are the ‘subtle bodies’ described in Vedic eschatology, which are subject to rebirth; relevant to this is Praśastapāda’s use of the epithet ‘ativāhikaśarīra’ \(Bhāṣya 359\) in relation to the workings of dharma and adharma, which presumably impacts the des-tiny of the minute, yet transmigratory ‘subtle body’; Indian philosophy distinguishes, I think, between ‘substance soul,’ ‘subtle body,’ and ‘body’; mokṣa for Vaiśeṣika is removing the ‘subtle body’ from the pure nature of ‘soul’ in order to liberate it from the shackles of motion \(karma theory\). 

{{163}}

***5.2.12. thunder is due to a ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of ‘water’***

thunder is the ‘sound’ of clouds and lightning; \[sound\] takes place because of a 

‘conjunction’ called mutual striking of waters which are being moved and which have become waves, ‘air’ has action from opposite directions; ‘sound’ is \[produced\] from a ‘disjunction’ of ‘water’ and from being cut off from one agitated 

‘wind.’307

***5.2.13. movement of ‘lustre’ and the motion of ‘air’ have ***

***been explained through ‘earth’-motions***

because ‘earth’-motion is \[triggered\] by a ‘conjunction’ with a conjoint impulse of the stroked \[thing\], it follows that ‘lustre’ and ‘air’ are types of irregular motion; 

\[thus\] this ‘earth’-motion is irregular; however, the regular \[motion is\]

***5.2.14. upwards burning of fire, oblique blowing of ‘wind’ ***

***and the first motion of atoms and ‘mind,’ \[all ***

***these\] are caused by the ‘unseen force’ ***

fire would stay or move sideways, the cooked thing would not change into ashes or water, also, if ‘air’ did not move horizontally there would be no kindling of fire for the substances to be purified; in the case of the subtle selves that had lost their bodies, 308 at the beginning of a new creation of the world there would not be a first motion of the atoms of ‘earth,’ and so forth, or, of their mutual approaching;309 

likewise, the yogis at the end of the world, those who had reached cosmic states, having steadied their ‘mind’ by ‘effort’ to continue \[in those states\], at the beginning \[of a new\] creation, there would be no initial motion of mind that connects 

\[them\] with a new body, all of these \[facts\] would not happen without the ‘unseen force’; 310 therefore, the upwards blowing of fire and the oblique blowing of ‘air,’ 

as well as the mutual motion of atoms, and the first motion of ‘mind,’ all these are also done by the ‘unseen force’ in the case of ‘living beings.’

[^309]: ‘bodies’ \(śarīra\) either ‘subtle’ or ‘gross’ are constituted from 2 mahābhūtas \(earth and lustre\); ‘their mutual approaching’ at the turn of cosmic cycles \(‘at the beginning of a new world\) refers to the inability of the atoms of earth to form a new body of these selves, which are presumably trapped in a limbo, as the Vedic cosmology describes; the ‘unseen force’ \(adṛṣṭa, or dharma and adharma\) is the law of karma that dramatically influences not only the formation of new bodies, but more importantly the arrangement of the whole new cosmos which takes a new shape with each new turn of the destruction and dissolution of cosmos. 

[^310]: the use of ‘adṛṣṭādṛṭa,’ which is the compound of adṛṣṭāt \(ablative\) \+ ṛṭe \(‘without’\) implies that all these motions and states of the individual selves ‘are attended by’ or 

‘depend on adṛṣṭa’; in other words, without adṛṣṭa, these do not happen.

***5.2.15. ‘mind-motion’ is explained by ‘hand-motion’***

when motion-in-hand happens because of a connection between ‘effort’ with 

‘soul,’ then, there is ‘mind-motion’ from a conjunction between ‘soul-mind-effort’ which is the motion of a embodied self \[ātman\]; while the ‘awakened-state’ 

is from ‘effort’ preceded by ‘volition’ and ‘aversion,’ yet, at the ‘time of awaken-ing,’ \[mind-motion\] is preceded by life principle; 

\[introductory line\]: since yoga is a ‘conjunction’ and because the ‘effect-of-motion’ is a limb of yoga, \[therefore\] yoga and mokṣa are \[both\] described in the chapter of motion – 

***5.2.16. the non-occurrence \[as well the occurrence ***

***of\] ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are because of a ***

***contact between soul-mind-senses-object***

‘anutpatti’ is explained to be the non-occurrence of the \[4-fold\] contact; thus, 

\[Kaṇāda\] says –

***5.2.17. yoga is that which, when‘mind’ stays in the ‘soul,’ \[makes such ***

***that\] ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ no longer exist in the embodied \[soul\]***

when indeed, ’mind’ is steady in the ‘soul’ and not in the senses, then there is non-occurrence of the 4-fold contact; the result of these 2 \[situations\] is the form of absence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain,’ yoga being the ‘conjunction’ between 

‘mind’ and ‘soul’ which depends on a breathing control of the ‘soul’ with a body. 

\[introductory line\] why the activity of prāṇāyāma, which is part of yoga, is not mentioned? 

***5.2.18. the motion of ‘ātman’ is explained ***

***by the motion of body***

here, the word ‘ātman’ refers to ‘air’; such as there is motion-in-hand because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘effort’ with ‘ātman,’ similarly, there is a ‘conjunction’ 

between ‘ātman,’ ‘air,’ and ‘effort’ \[and that\] is the motion of prāṇāyāma.

[^311]: sūtra does not necessarily imply that the atomic mind is that which goes away and in; it only mentions that a dravya – presumably but not certainly – the atomic mind, comes into contact with whatever is ‘consumed’ \(upayukta\), ‘eaten’ \(ānna\), and 

‘drunk’ \(āpāna\). 

{{167}}

***5.2.19. going away, coming in, ‘conjunction’ with \[something\] ***

***eaten, drunk, as well as ‘conjunction’ with other ***

***activities, are \[all\] caused by the ‘unseen force’***

at the time of death, there is going in and going forth of ‘mind’ from a previous body, the going in of the ‘mind’311 is due to a connection with another body, that 

which is situated in the womb begins to \[take shape\] from the state of ‘semen’ 

and ‘blood’ to \[that\] which is of the ‘measure’ of an ‘embryo,’ the conjunction between eaten and drunk is a contact312 attached to that which is used \[by the mother\] which enters through the vein in those \[stages of the foetus\] which are 

\[caught up\] in the cosmic cycle namely \[the development stages\] kālala, arbuda, māṃsa, peśī, and ghaṇa, as well as the ‘mind’-‘soul’-’conjunction’ with other activities, and the retreating of other \[activities\] and so forth \[all\] are done only by the ‘unseen force,’ and not by ‘effort.’

***5.2.20. absolute liberation is when there is absence of that ***

***\[unseen force\] because there is no ‘conjunction’ ***

***due to the non-manifestation \[of body\]***

in the absence of \[the\] ‘unseen force’ which is the instrumental cause of the begin-ningless motion of ‘form,’ the absence of the ‘conjunction’ of ‘mind’ and ‘soul,’ 

which is called life principle \[jīvana\], and the non-manifestation of a body, which is called mokṣa, is the argument for \[the existence of\] darkness \[according to which\] everything is covered and that knowledge of darkness cannot be ascertained; that is \[to say\] again –

***5.2.21. because it is a different \[category\] from substance, quality, and ***

***motion, darkness is only the absence of manifestation \[of light\]***

darkness is neither a substance, nor a quality, nor \[even\] motion because of the inscrutability of \[its\] substratum, because of \[its\] undifferentiated nature with regard to impermanent substances, because \[it\] is antithetical to brightness, because \[it\] is intangible, and because of \[its\] undifferentiated nature with regard to permanent substances, and due to the fact that \[it\] is perishable; therefore, darkness is only the absence of light; how is this? 

[^312]: this contact is called ‘sambandho’śitapītasaṁyoga’ and takes place throughout the stages of embryonic formation.

[^313]: ‘sadbhāvāt’ presumably the lustre light refers to another kind of light, the light that exists inside a cave, this light, however, is not the same as sunlight. 

[^314]: that ‘soul’ is devoid of motion might be just an explanatory innovation inserted by Candrānanda in the list of abstract substances. 

[^315]: ‘this explanation’ may refer to the above sūtras which use the vaidharmic \(or differential\) epistemological reasoning, which seeks to settle definitions by drawing distinctions \(rather than by sādharmyic reasoning that does so by drawing commonalities\). 

{{169}}

***5.2.22. and \[darkness\] is due to lustre being covered by another \[entity\]***

because of the absence of \[lustre’s\] occurrence in other substances, as in a mountain cave for instance, the brightness of Savitṛ \(sun god\) exists externally from that of the lustre’s manifestation \[inside the cave\], 313 therefore, we think that dark-

ness is the absence of lustre, only; external \[darkness\] is removable by a lamp, but 

\[darkness which is\] ignorance \[can be removed\] through the lustre of knowledge, thus, in this way both ‘liberation’ \[mokṣa\] and ‘yoga‘ \[yoga\] are explained. 

***5.2.23. ‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘vacuum’ are devoid of motion, and are ***

***distinguishable from \[things\] which are possessed by motion***

‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘vacuum’ are formless, and because \[they\] are different from 

‘earth’ and so forth, which have concrete form and activity, \[but space and so forth\] have no concrete form, therefore are motionless, \[but\] due to the word ‘ca’ 

\[and\], ‘soul’ is also \[considered\]314 devoid of motion. 

***5.2.24. by this \[explanation\]315 qualities and motions are being explained***

in this way, because of formlessness, the ‘qualities’ and ‘motions’ are to be considered motionless, because the word ‘ca,’ universal and so forth categories \[are motionless too\]. 316

***5.2.25. ‘inherence’ in things devoid of motion is a contradictory ***

***\[and different category\] than ‘motion’***

motion is not inherent in \[things\] that are devoid of motion, such as stroke and so forth, because motion is generating \[motion\] in its own substratum, 317 \[not the substratum of things\]

***5.2.26. but qualities are non-inherent causes***

concerning qualities which are stated to be causes, they are non-inherent, because themselves are cause such as cause \[itself\] is. 

[^316]: concepts that are devoid of motions are ākāśa, diś, ātman, guṇa, karma, and sāmānya; could they all have in common a universal nature as well? 

[^317]: ‘generating motion in its own substratum’ resembles Aristotle’s view on ‘essence’ or 

‘nature’ which has a ‘principle of movement,’ Aristotle \(Physics 192b20\).
