[^318]: perception of difference is fundamental for Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology; it refers to the possibility of the knowledge about the essence of substances which is ultimately ‘differentiated’; viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa are concepts of a crucial importance, both ontologically and epistemologically, respectively. 

[^319]: it is debatable if ‘direction’ is an appropriate translation for ‘diś.’

[^320]: all substances as well as all qualities are possessed by a ‘specific dharma,’ an epistemic entity that plays an important role in Vaiśeṣika’s theory of individuation, for it is dharma that which, for instance, identifies in a universal, say redness, a particular red from another particular red, both of which belong to the same class of redness.

***5.2.27. ‘space’ is defined by \[its\] qualities***

‘space’ which is explained as the instrumental cause of the perception of the variation \[of states\]318 as in sentences such as ‘departing eastwards’; extension is because of being cause and because of \[space being\] non-inherent \[in the perception of variation\]. 

***5.2.28. ‘time’ is defined by causality \[of the states of space\]***

that by means of which ‘direction’319 is explained \[produced\] by the conceptualisation of the manifold, by that, ‘time’ \[itself\] is explained to be the instrumental cause for the conceptualisation of the manifold \[as expressed in the sentence\] 

‘\[time\] done simultaneously \[with space\]’. 

**// the fifth chapter / section of motion is completed //**


**/ the first lesson of the sixth chapter /**

after having explained the motions, \[now\] qualities will be explained; concerning these, ‘dharma’ is being explained first, because this is how \[it\] was first intended by the śāstras; according to a Vedic injunction \[dharma\] is the means \[for the knowledge of qualities\];320 if you ask on the truthfulness of the Vedas, then \[the answer is yes\] because –

***6.1.1. sentences formulated in the Vedas, are preceded by an Intellect321***

‘one desirous of heaven should sacrifice agnihotra’ \[…\]322 such \[an\] element \[of faith\] is authoritative because it derives from a prior Intellect \[and\] because it is composed by Bhagavān Īśvara, therefore it is authoritative for its truthfulness is invariably connected with a trustworthy person who composed it; if you say that which is beyond sense organs is impossible to know, then, 

[^321]: given that the subject of this āhnika is the knowledge of qualities, the relationship between Vedas and Divine Intellect must be analysed through the lens of the relationship between the ‘quality’ sound \(e.g. Vedas\) and ‘substance’ God \(Intellect, Bhagavān Īśvara\). Between them there is an intimate relationship of ‘inherence.’

[^322]: Jambūvijayaji does not provide a reference to this sentence, but we take it to refer to the Vedas or Brāhmaṇas.

***6.1.2. \[the\] characteristic mark of a seer’s \[intellect\]  
is that it is unlike our cognition***

‘liṅga’ means the knowledge by means of which a subject-meaning is known; the knowledge of Maheśvara is not similar to our knowledge which connects the subject-matter with things near and present, because the god-like \[or seers’\] 

knowledge manifests about things which are beyond sense-organs; how is it that 

\[Maheśvara\] is known? 

***6.1.3. similarly, the characteristic mark of a Brahmin \[or  
seers’ knowledge\] is the act of naming \[things\]***

in our case, knowledge as to \[whether\] ‘this is a Brahmin’ cannot be produced without initiation, by mere sight, or ordinary perception; concerning \[the name of\] the son \[of Brahmiṣṭa\] and so forth, conducting the naming-ritual is after the consideration of the meaning as well as with the perception of \[him\]; the meaning of the sūtra is that conducting the naming-ritual of the Brahmin and so forth, is after due consideration with perception of the subject-matter, and these have been enunciated \[by the sūtra\]; therefore –

***6.1.4. sacrificial offerings are \[or must be\] preceded by \[Vedic\] knowledge***

this is how Parameśvara made the Vedas in the beginning arranging them in sentences in fix position\[s\], as well as the tradition smārta concerning offerings and so forth which have also been foreseen by the Intellect of Bhṛgu323 who is the 

maker of these \[offerings\], and who expounded their contents after having considered the sacred texts, he divided them into innumerable branches; therefore, 

injunctions such as the act of offering and so forth, are conducive to ‘dharma.’324

***6.1.5. similarly, receiving \[must be\] preceded by \[Vedic\] knowledge325***

for instance, the act of receiving is only in the case of a \[Brahmin\] who has lost his way of livelihood, one who has pure birth, \[and\] one who possesses the proper qualities for taking, \[such receiving\] leads to dharma. 

[^324]: translated ‘bring about’ instead of ‘they cause dharma’ because I wish to stress the ontological importance and prevalence of dharma in this commentary. 

[^325]: in other words, the act of receiving is \[or should be\] preceded by Intellect.

[^326]: ‘abhyudaya’ may be translated by ‘elevation’ or ‘prosperity’ in this world and the next world, a condition which the religious man aspires to by performing devotional and ritual deeds; it should not be confused with ‘liberation’ \(mokṣa\). 

{{175}}

***6.1.6. the sequence of the 2 \[offering and receiving\] is similar to \[the sequence\]  
of those things which are unrelated to each other \[by cause effect\]***

just as elements \[are\] each other independent parts and not mutual entities \[fused with each other\] by cause and effect, fire being not the cause of the sticks, but rather these are parts in themselves, in the same way, there is a sequence of 

\[throwing\] sticks in the fire, hence between these 2 things, dharma of giving is earlier, dharma of taking follows after, but cause and effect relation \[between them\] does not exist; why? 

***6.1.7. the qualities of one soul have no causality

qualities of another soul do not become the cause of another self; \[with regard\] 

to that

***6.1.8. ‘mundane elevation’326*** *** is \[obtained\] from the utterance  
\[of a blessing\] after feeding a pure \[Brahmin\]***

having fed a pure Brahmin, the ‘elevation’ of man is \[obtained\] from the utterance of his blessing and so forth, this becomes the cause of ‘dharma,’ this is the meaning. 

***6.1.9. this \[elevation\] does not exist when feeding an impure \[Brahmin\]***

there is no achievement of mundane elevation after having fed an impure Brahmin, even if there is the utterance of blessings, and so forth; 327 now, what is impure? 

***6.1.10. impurity \[consists\] of violence***

you should know that anyone who commits violence against another person is impure whether the \[violence\] is in the form of mental or corporeal pain; the word 

‘hiṃsa’ \[violence\] is an indication \[of many such kinds\], because –

[^327]: here the rule is addressed to pure Brahmins; blessing and true speeches have no effectiveness if the internal and deep purity of the Brahmin is not confirmed; in Indian philosophy, there is not always dissociation between speaker and the spoken, between object and meaning, between śabda Brahman and śabda of people; there is often a holistic and immanent yet dualistic and transcendental mode in understanding truth.

[^328]: samabhivyāhāra, ‘companionship’ includes ‘speech’ and ‘conversation,’ which means that even speech may be polluted by either listening to or conversing with a violent person. 

{{177}}

***6.1.11. impurity \[subsists even\] in companionship328***

concerning a person who gets impurity, \[that one\] commits a great sin even through sheer conversation \[with an impure Brahmin\], then what about \[impurity in\] speaking, and through feeding and so forth? in this passage the word 

‘samabhivyāhāra’ means conversation, while in the previous passage it means blessing. 

***6.1.12. such \[impurity\] does not subsist when \[in  
companionship\] with a pure \[Brahmin\] ***

that impurity in the form of conversation does not exist in a Brahmin who is devoid of violence and so forth; in the case of the pure \[Brahmin\] also –

***6.1.13. \[nor does impurity subsists in\] ‘propensity’  
towards a morally-qualified \[Brahmin\] ***

‘propensity’ of a person wishful of prosperity \[should not be\] towards only a Brahmin devoid of violence, but \[also\] towards a Brahmin who is qualified through 

\[qualities\] related to ‘time,’ ‘region,’ ‘knowledge,’ and ‘demeanour’; therefore, 

***6.1.14. there \[should not be\] propensity \[for companionship\]  
towards a mediocre \[or\] inferior \[Brahmin\]***

a pure Brahmin observing the space \[rule of settlement\] and other \[rules\] is described as \[a\] morally qualified \[Brahmin\]; one who is bound by \[only\] one of these moral qualities is mediocre; and one who is associated with all the qualities is a distinctively superior \[Brahmin\]; avoid these 2 impure \[Brahmins\], kṣatriya or other class, or any living creatures \[because they are\] considered inferior; one who desires ‘mundane elevation’ should not have propensity towards a mediocre or inferior Brahmin, but only towards a distinctively superior Brahmin, at the time of Vaiśākhī \[month\]329 

and so forth, offering \[him\] gold and along with a mantra, and so forth. 

***6.1.15. this is why, accepting \[offerings\] are explained \[differently\] between  
the inferior, mediocre, and morally-qualified \[Brahmins\]***

thereby, the act of accepting money from another at the time of calamity has been explained in a reverse sequence; and thus it is stated: ‘in the beginning one may accept from an inferior \[person\] in his absence \[may accept\] from a mediocre 

\[Brahmin\]; in the absence of that \[mediocre Brahmin\] however, one may accept from a superior-qualified \[Brahmin\].’

{{179}}

***6.1.16. comparably, avoiding the hostile ones \[should

in the similar reverse order, a Brahmin should kill enemies when these attack for the sake of killing \[and\] those who are inferior to himself. 

***6.1.17. when \[encountering\] a mediocre \[Brahmin\], should one  
sacrifice330 oneself \[to him\], or \[sacrifice\] the adversary\[?\]***

there is an option regarding the Brahmin who is attacked by an enemy endowed with qualities equal to his: \[either\] killing oneself or \[killing\] the aggressor. 

***6.1.18. \[but\] when \[encountering\] a morally-superior \[Brahmin\]  
one should sacrifice oneself \[rather than harming him\]331***

one who is captured by an enemy with superior qualities should \[rather\] accept death at the hands of the enemy; here the usage of \[the words\] inferior and so forth refer to oneself, and in mutual dependent relation with the act of accepting.

**// the second lesson of the sixth chapter //**

thus, having stated that ‘dharma’ is \[achieved\] from the injunctions of śruti and smṛti texts, regarding these, he now explains the specific types of ‘dharma’; for example –

purpose is seen, \[acts\] whose purpose is not seen are  
\[all acts which lead\] to ‘mundane elevation’***

concerning the visible acts from the smṛti and śruti texts we understand that ablutions which are the removal of dirt and so forth are of the visible kind, their performance \[however\] lacks any connection with a purpose, and all these lead to 

‘elevation’; which are these?

‘space,’ lunar station \(nakṣatra\), and injunctions regarding ‘time’  
are \[all performed\] in accordance with the ‘unseen force’334***

bathing is ablution in relation to the body and \[its performance\] consists of ‘water’ 

in respect to a specific ‘time’ and ‘space’; fasting is in the form of refraining from food preceded by a rule concerning day \[and\] night; celibacy is of the kind of abstaining from women and so forth, which means that \[abstaining\] refers to a Brahmin’s moral conduct in relation to ‘mind’ and ‘soul,’ and by the word ātman, it refers to Brahman; 335 dwelling with a guru is living in his house first for the purpose of wisdom, as well as devotion \[to him\], and other \[duties\]; dwelling in 

\[a\] forest is after having renounced the household to dwell in a forest as prescribed by the śāstras; sacrifice is cooked sacrifice and so forth; offering is ‘safety offer-

ing’336 and ‘gold offering’337 and so forth; sprinkling is in relation to adoration at 

twilight,338 and so forth; ‘space’-related rules and so forth regarding other ‘particularities’ \[of religious life\]; ‘direction’-related rule \[is the rule\] ‘one should eat facing east’ \[Tait. Brahm. 1.1.2\];339 the rule of constellation is: ‘one should enact fires on lunar mansion’ \[…\]; 340 the rule concerning mantra is ‘devasya tveti’341 

by which one takes out \[the material for the sacrificial cake\]; the rule regarding 

‘time’ is ‘a Brahmin should establish fire during spring-time’ \[…\]; thus, with all such things, when they have their ‘examined purpose’ concealed and are being conducted \[as such\], then, ‘dharma’ is obtained. 

***6.2.3. the \[duties of the\] 4 stages of life are both

now, whatever act344 concerning the 4 stages of life when performed with defect or without defect, that leads to ‘dharma’ or ‘adharma,’345 what is \[considered\] 

defect? 

[^339]: this reference follows the recommendation which the Italian edition \(VSi\) of Leonardo V. Arena \(1987:155\) provides. 

[^340]: according to Hindu astrology, Kṛttikā is the third of the 27 nakṣatras; it is ruled by Sun; see Black Yajurveda: Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 

[^341]: the rule can be rephrased as ‘one should take out the material for the sake \(devatasya\) of sacrificial cake.’

[^342]: ‘anupadhā category’ includes acts that should be performed ‘without break’ or ‘purity of intention’ \(VSc 6.2.5\). 

[^343]: ‘upadhā acts’ are acts that are not conductive to dharma because they are performed with a form of ‘internal impurity’ \(aśuci\), ‘break,’ or ‘failure’ \(VSc 6.2.4\). 

[^344]: the usual translation for ‘karma’ has been ‘motion,’ but in this context it may refer to 

‘acts’ or ‘deeds’ that any of the 4 āśramas require. 

[^345]: if there are defects, then the act leads to the absence of dharma, and when there are no defects in the act, then it leads to dharma.

***6.2.10. and there is a restraint which is known to have another meaning***

restraint does not mean something dissimilar from ‘effort’; if ‘effort’ is absent from all activities, there will be absence of ‘effort’ in the case of a person using pure food; \[objection\] if ‘effort’ is so important, then there will be mundane elevation even without yoga and so forth; \[response\] no, this cannot be so:

***6.2.11. when this \[yogic restraint\] is absent \[then\] there is absence  
of the ‘existential’ \[mundane elevation\] \[as well\]***

in the absence of the performance of yoga and so forth \[and\] only by ‘effort’ 

there is no mundane elevation, because it is a worthless instructive activity; now 

\[Kaṇāda\] explains ‘dharma’ which is conducive to absolute liberation. 

***6.2.12. \[yogic restraint is important\] because from ‘pleasure’ \[arises\] passion***

passion is augmented from ‘pleasure’ only, and is produced from subjects such as women, and so forth; 

***6.2.13. because \[passion\] becomes identical with the object \[of pleasure\]***

since one becomes identical with it \[passion\] due to causes \[like\] ‘pleasure,’ 

because the body is made of them \[the qualities of pleasure\] then, due to becoming identical, passion takes place; moreover, 

***6.2.14. \[because the subject\] is gratified***

when one is satisfied because of a full-grown body there is passion from satisfaction; moreover, 

***6.2.15. \[gratification\] is due the ‘unseen force’***

someone’s passion is produced from causes not previously seen and there the 

‘unseen force’ causes \[the ‘subtle self’\] to be born again; moreover,

[^348]: ‘crawling beings eating grass’ \(tiraścāṃ tṛṇādibhojane\). 

[^349]: ‘icchādveṣapūrvikā dharmādharmayoḥ pravrttiḥ’ could be simply translated by ‘propensity towards dharma’ and adharma is preceded by ‘propensity’ and ‘antipathy’; in other words, whatever inner and uncontrolled inclinations one has determines the future of acts conducive to dharma and adharma. 

[^350]: ‘grāmakāmeṣṭyādau’ may refer to a man who desires to join the collective inhabitants of a place such as heaven, reachable after death. 

[^351]: the gloss describes the chain of causation from the external psychological level of emotions \(‘volition’\) down to dharma, which is an invisible entity of an ethical order that characterises both the entities, either mental, molecular, or atomic; reality has at least 3 levels: physical, psychological, and ethical \(dharmic\). 

[^352]: questions must be addressed further: Where is this accumulation stored? Where is its substratum? the mind? the ‘soul’?

***6.2.16. a particular passion arises \[according to\] its particular species***

such as there are crawling beings348 eating grass and so forth, similarly there is passion \[according to\] a particularity of species also; and passion is because of 

‘pleasure’ and so forth, ‘aversion’ is because of ‘pain’ and so forth, therefore –

***6.2.17. ‘volition’ and ‘aversion’ precede the propensity  
towards ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’349***

‘volition’ precedes the propensity towards ‘dharma,’ and conversely, ‘aversion’ 

precedes the condition of being full of intoxication, but the one who overcomes 

\[these flaws\] precedes the desire to attain the heavenly abode first by oblation;350 

concerning someone infatuated with the wife of another, that \[thought\] has been preceded by a ‘volition’ as well as by adharma;351 hence, this is an accumulation 

of ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’;352 this is so, because, 

***6.2.18. from that \[unseen force\] there is ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’***

when there is accumulation of ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma,’ then there is ‘conjunction’ between flesh and senses, and that is called ‘birth-principle’ \[janman\], and when these \[dharma and adharma\] are reduced, the ‘disjunction’ \[of body from senses\] takes place at the time of death; moreover, the ‘being’353 is without begin-

ning and it returns like a \[Persian\] wheel of ‘water’-pots, and \[because of dharma and adharma\] there is ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ with body; this is explained in a reversed order, for example –

***6.2.19. liberation is explained in relation to ‘motion’ \[and\] ‘soul’***

the \[word\] ‘ātman’ refers to ‘mind,’354 \[and\] liberation is that \[which is to be understood\] in relation to mind motions, in the absence of ‘that,’355 in the absence of a connection \[of these mentioned above\], and in the ‘non-manifestation’ \[of body\]356 this is \[how\] liberation is explained;357

**// the sixth chapter //**

[^353]: the being that returns must be the ‘subtle self,’ which is to be identified by the term 

‘jantu’; it cannot be the ‘soul’ because soul lacks intrinsic capacity of motion. 

[^354]: contrary to what we might be tempted to translate, the commentator explains that 

‘ātma’ does not refer to ‘soul’ in this gloss. 

[^355]: ‘tat’ refers to adṛṣṭa \(tad abhāve\), see VSc 5.2.20. 

[^356]: ‘aprādurbhāva’ \(non-manifestation\) of a new ‘biological subtle body’ \(jantu\). 

[^357]: the importance of such negations derives from being discussed in relation to mokṣa; the ‘motion in mind’ is a particularly vital factor here; as it is known, buddhi, which is a vaiśeṣikaguṇa, will not be a constitutive part of the state of mokṣa; it will eventually vanish, leaving the ātman completely blank, which is due to the dissolution of adṛṣṭa, which seems to have manoeuvred them until then.
