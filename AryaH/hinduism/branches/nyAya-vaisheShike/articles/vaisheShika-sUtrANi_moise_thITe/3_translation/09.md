Up. 6.2.1\) who discuss whether in the beginning of the world the ‘real’ thing \(sat\) exists in an ‘undifferentiated,’ ‘non-phenomenal’ state \(asat\). I think the whole discussion of ‘asat’ is about what can be conceptualised or non-conceptualised through language, not about what exists or not. 

[^485]: allusion is made here to asatkāryavāda theory. 

[^486]: as in other instances, like cognition, the alternative appearance and disappearance of cognition proves the function and existence of ‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

[^487]: in other words, ‘real’ does not exist prior to its production, by which the gloss reaffirms the Vaiśeṣika theory of asatkāryavāda; if, however, ‘asat’ is taken – as mentioned in an earlier footnote – to be that which is not conceptualised \(not necessarily

**/ the ninth chapter /**

in order to elucidate inference, \[Kaṇāda\] shows now its object \[of application\]483

***9.1. non-real484*** *** is \[that\] which has no activity, quality, \[and\] designation***

effect is not grasped by direct perception before its prior production; 485 nor through 

inference due to its transformation when there is a mark of it, and when there is absence of an \[inferential\] mark, there is non-comprehension of activities and qualities, 486 and it is indicated by the word ‘vyapadeśa’ \[designation\] that there is 

\[1\] mark and not another mark; therefore, the un-real \[asat\] is prior to its \[present\] 

existence; 487 afterwards \[Kaṇāda says\]

***9.2. \[effect is understood in relation to\] real \[and\]488 un-real***

and the ‘un-real’ is like the ‘real’ effect-product which is destroyed at a subsequent time, \[and\] there is no termination of the ‘real’ due to the absence of designation of quality and activity; but concerning their inter-relation \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***9.3. ‘asat’ is different from ‘sat’ because it has ***

***no designation, quality, and activity***

because of the termination of the ‘real’489 prior to \[another\] production, 490 the 

‘real’ thing is a different subject-matter from the ‘non-real’ produced at a subsequent time due to its prior termination, \[and real is different from non-real\] 

because of the existence of designation, quality and activity. 

that which does not exist\), then asatkāryavāda may be another form of asatkāryavāda, for it does not radically deny the existence of an effect, but perhaps only its manifestation; on how asatkāryavāda could ‘with the appropriate clarification and adjustment be easily called satkāryavāda,’ see Halbfass 1992: 58. 

[^488]: instead of ‘is,’ Halbfass reads this sūtra with ‘becomes’ 1992: 243. 

[^489]: real’s termination refers to the ‘non-existence of real effect’ prior to its actual birth. 

[^490]: it is debatable if ‘termination’ refers here to the cessation of something, or just to the 

‘complete absence’ of something; does ‘unreal’ mean something completely ‘non-existent’ or it is just something ‘dormant’ or ‘un-manifested’? Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2. seems to be ambiguous about the nature of ‘sat’ and ‘asat’; should we read it in terms of absence versus the presence of a thing, actuality versus potentiality, or rather manifestation versus un-manifested thing?

[^491]: sūtra designates how the system can maintain 2 kinds of argument as well as 2 kinds of reality; one should not confuse the concept of ‘reality’ with ‘existence’; see Vādīndra who discusses how a thing can be ‘real’ and ‘non-existent’ at the same ‘time’; in this gloss, Candrānanda seems to agree with Vādīndra who maintains that the ‘non-existing real’ refers to the real that cannot exist independently because its ‘nature’ 

\(svarūpa\), stands on very flimsy foundations, that is to say, it has a quasi-inexistent substratum; for example, the substratum of antyaviśeṣa is the substance. 

[^492]: sūtra expresses here the ‘argument of difference,’ which is grounded upon inferential logic more than on a realistic ontological basis. 

{{235}}

***9.4. and the ‘real’ \[thing can also be\] ‘unreal’***

‘real’ thing also can be ‘unreal’ by excluding another existential, just as a bull is not a horse because of not doing \[horse\] activity, that is not a bull for it does not 

bear, therefore it is metaphorically called a ‘non-real’ \[thing\].491

***9.5. that which is ‘real’ \[demonstrated\] from that which is ***

***different, that also \[demonstrates\] ‘non-real’ as well492***

and ‘real’ is that which has a form completely absent in another thing, a subject-matter such as hare’s horn and so forth, which are a priori absent, metaphorically, and which is not \[the subject-matter\] of absence after destruction, such as hare’s horn which is ‘non-real’ as well; since ‘non-real’ \[things\] are a priori indistinct,493 

and since \[there is a doubt\] regarding the propensity of an agent not in someone else, then the reply\] is no, because there is conceptualisation of difference;494 \[and\] 

concerning that \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***9.6. knowledge of the non-real is because of the absence of the ***

***perception of a \[real\] entity, as well as because of the memory of ***

***that entity, and because of the perception of \[something\] opposite495***

knowledge concerning ‘asat’ is after seeing the dissolution of the thing that passed as in the \[expression\] ‘earlier’ \[indicated\] because \[it\] is not visible now, and because of the memory of the past thing \[and\] from having grasped the potsherds which are contrary and different; \[the non-real\] is produced after having imagined 

\[its\] destruction, for otherwise, how would that be perceived if its nature were not differentiated? 496 but regarding the prior absence, \[he\] says –

[^493]: ‘a priori indistinct’ does not necessarily mean prior ‘non-existence,’ it means that 

‘asat’ should be only seen as ‘undifferentiated,’ ‘undistinguished.’

[^494]: the ‘argument of difference’ mentioned in the previous footnote acquires a new explanation: the ‘grasping of difference’ is possible due to 2 factors: ontological, by the individuating factor \(antyaviśeṣa\), and the other epistemological \(dharmaviśeṣa\), which is the sense-data that the perceiver perceives directly through senses, with yogipratyakṣa. 

[^495]: on ‘virodha,’ see probans in VSc 3.1.8. 

[^496]: ‘perception of difference’ is possible because things are unique each time they are produced and each time they are destroyed.

***9.7. similarly, there is the perceptibility of an un-real ‘existential’497***

regarding the prior non-existence of a lump of clay there is ‘perceptual cognition’ of a pot-object at the time of \[its\] prior existence, but now the ‘cognition’ 

of a pot-object of the thing that came forth is contradictory \[because\] the state of the potsherd is remembered, therefore this co-produced existential was certainly previously non-existent, and the firm ‘cognition’ is that which refers to ‘asat’ as regards the prior non-existence of that ‘asat.’

***9.8. by means of this ‘a-ghaṭa’ \[non-pot\], ‘a-ga’ \[non-***

***bull\], ‘a-dharma’ \[non-dharma\] are explained***

when indeed a perfect perception of ‘the pot of a pan’ is produced in relation to the discernment resulted from \[the fact of\] ‘a pot in a pan,’ \[the sentence\] ‘this is not a pot, it is a pan’ is due to the absence of the \[direct\] experience of the pot as well as because it \[is based on\] recollection after seeing the dish and so forth, which is contrary to the pot, \[this is how knowledge\] should be understood; similarly, regarding a horse \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘it is a non-bull’ \[this knowledge is to be explained\], similarly, after seeing the generality; bath during night-time, this is to be understood as \[lawful\] dharma, because the knowledge of ‘un-lawful’ had been produced, thus these are 3 examples in which there is a difference between perceivable and unperceivable, and something \[intuitive\] which is beyond the sense-organ perception. 

***9.9. ‘non-existent,’ \[and\] ‘this is not’, \[between these 2 ***

***sentences\] there is no difference in meaning***

regarding the prior, secondary, or posterior non-existential \[abhūta\] that is of the nature of absolute non-existence, like for example a hare’s horn and so forth as indicated in the \[expressions such as\] ‘non-existential,’ ‘this is not,’ which are defined by synonymous words and do not express another meaning, therefore, the philosophy \[Vaiśeṣika\] defines \[things\] by means of synonymous words, 

\[and\] not by the negation of ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and so forth; but concerning the other 

\[things\]\[he mentions\] –

***9.10. \[in the sentence\] ‘there is no pot in the house,’ this indicates a ***

***negation of the connection between an existing pot and the house***

there is ‘no pot at this ‘time’ \[and\] ‘space,’ this \[sentence\] is the negation of 

‘space’ and so forth in regard to pot and so forth, and the absence of the produced pot’s own nature is not denied.

[^497]: quite contrary to the Buddhist view \(pratītyasamutpāda\), Vaiśeṣika sees ‘essence’ \(tattva\) and ‘reality’ \(sattā\) beyond the usual powers of perception such as seeing and so forth; thus, without officialising a doctrine of non-existence \(like the discussion on 

‘darkness’ attempts in VSc 5.2.21\) the system acknowledges reality beyond visibility, not least because there are forms of supra-perception. 

[^498]: like the expression ‘sadasat’ \(VS 9.2\) whereby for a thing to be ‘sat’ it needs to have quality and designation, it is only the manifestation and perception of ‘sat’ that can be doubted, not its immanent or ‘hidden’ existence in the cause; the gloss may render asatkāryavāda problematic is understood in Western terms such as ‘to be or not to be’; 

‘sat’ and ‘asat’ may have a predominant linguistic, and mental value, not necessarily an existential one. 

[^499]: ‘non-reality’ applies only to whatever entity is produced or effected; it refers to the 

‘non-reality’ of the ‘becoming.’

{{239}}

***9.11. ‘there is no other moon’ this \[expression\] ***

***precludes the universal moon***

‘there is no second moon,’ by this \[sentence\] the number \[of the moon\] is denied, therefore moon excludes the universal called moon, thus, as a matter of fact, it is said that there is no universal such as moonness; in the absence of such conditions as ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and ‘power of existence,’ \[some\] explain that it is something which is totally absent and \[they\] deny the universal moonness; because there is no grasping by perception, effect is both existing and non-existing in the cause,498 

\[one example is\] the non-production of curd from sand, \[but it is rather\] produced from milk. 

***9.12. the differentiation between ‘sat’ and ‘asat,’ \[shows\] that ***

***there is absence of ‘reality’ in the ‘effect-product’***

due to the opposition between ‘sat’ and ‘asat,’ there is no existential and non-existential effect in the cause simultaneously; therefore, \[effect\] is only un-real;499

\[introductory line\] because the subject-matter of perception is invisible 

\[parokṣa\],500 \[now\] the yogic perception is explained by the medium of both perception and inference. 501

***9.13. because of a particular ‘conjunction’ between ***

***‘soul’ and ‘mind’ \[taking place\] in the ‘soul’ ***

***\[there arises\] the perception of the ‘soul.’***

having withdrawn the senses from objects, and the ‘mind’ from them \[senses\], when ‘mind’ is concentrated only in the ‘soul,’ then the direct knowledge regarding one’s own ‘soul’ is produced from a specific connection between ‘soul’ and 

‘mind,’ which \[perception\] is dependent on a dharma born of yoga in those beings 

\[who practise contemplation\]. 502

[^500]: ‘direct perception has a peculiar subject-matter’ may refer here to the role of perception to see through a ‘specific dharma’ \(dharmaviśeṣa\), the ultimate ‘differential essence of things’ \(viṣayatva\). 

[^501]: \(preceding line to sūtra 9.13\) yogipratyakṣa is a direct perception about the nature of things and is explained to be both perceptual and inferential; to sum up, the theory of perception in Vaiśeṣika may be called ‘inferential induction.’

[^502]: explanation: the introductory line of this sūtra and gloss explains that there exists a special form of knowledge achieved by yogis; the use of the genitive dual in the introductory line \(pratyakṣānumānayoḥ\) might mean that, like Praśastapāda, Candrānanda acknowledges a 2-fold character of yogipratyakṣa; there is also an epistemological argument at stake here, namely whether ‘soul’ is its own perceiver, or whether is perceived by someone else, say ‘mind’ \(manas\).

[^503]: knowledge is produced in regard to the other substances through the contact between 

‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

[^504]: these ‘contacts’ \(saṃyukta\) depend on the knowledge that takes place between ‘mind’ 

and ‘soul.’

[^505]: ‘perceptive knowledge’ is already referred to in the previous sūtra 9.13. 

{{241}}

***9.14. in a similar way \[knowledge is produced\] in ***

***regard to the other substances503***

knowledge is produced in respect to \[several\] contacts:504 when substances’ 

contact with the ‘soul’ is not obstructed by atomic \[substances\] and so forth; in respect to ‘conjunctions’ of the soul that are not obstructed when all-pervasive 

\[substances\] are not in contact with the ‘soul,’ and when there are ‘conjunctions’ 

that obstruct the ‘soul,’ moreover, 

***9.15. \[perceptual knowledge\]505*** *** is also due to a contact ***

***between ‘soul,’ senses, ‘mind,’ and object-matter. ***

regarding things which are small, hidden, remote, their perceptual \[knowledge\] is also produced from the 4-fold perceptual contact;506 in this way, our perceptions and so forth \[are produced\]. 

***9.16. \[perception is produced\] in regard to motions and ***

***qualities through the co-existence \[of objects\] in them***

just as due to a ‘conjunction’ \[of mind\] with different causes, the knowledge concerning other substances \[soul and so forth\] is produced, similarly, the production of knowledge regarding motions and qualities \[happens\] by the inherence of those substances in their motions and qualities \[of things\]; 507and just as knowledge is produced in regards to minute things and our perception is through the 4-fold contact, similarly, the knowledge concerning qualities and motions is produced 

due to the co-existence with the connected \[object\].508

[^506]: ‘the 4-fold contact’ is the one mentioned in the sūtra itself 9.15. 

[^507]: once again, the ontological perceptual knowledge about the substances \(and their essences\) precedes any inferential knowledge about quality and motions; substance has proximity, whereas quality has a secondary value. 

[^508]: ‘saṃyuktasamavāya’ plays an important role within the Vaiśeṣika theory of perception; it is what may be called ‘inferential induction’ whereby the epistemology of the system lies in both perception and inference, among which the former is principal and crucial.

[^509]: the ‘intimate relation’ \(samavāya\) between the qualities and the substance ‘soul’ gives us the opportunity to analyse, define, and perceive ‘soul’ itself; however abstract a substance may be, qualities and their marks are an important medium by which we grasp the nature of substances, because between them there is an intimate relation, or as the Latin scholastic philosopher Duns Scotus would put it, there is only a ‘formal distinction’ not a ‘real distinction’ \(as the Thomist traditions maintain\). 

[^510]: the concept of ‘haecceity’ which Duns Scotus generated, puts forward a similar argument about the existence of ‘I’; namely by the ‘sense data’ which demonstrate both the individualised essence of ‘soul’ can be demonstrated; ‘univocity’ would mean that there is no sharp distinction between simple essence and individualised nature, but only a ‘formal’ one. 

[^511]: the discussion carries on about the specific qualities of the ‘soul,’ on whose essential knowledge liberation depends; on the other hand, the importance of the glosses 9.13 

through 9.17 lies in that it gives yoga a role to play at the cognitive level; neverthe-

{{243}}

***9.17. \[knowledge\] concerning the qualities of ‘soul’ \[is produced\] ***

***through their co-existence with the \[substance\] ‘soul’509***

just as from a ‘conjunction’ between ‘mind’ and ‘soul’ one’s knowledge concern-

ing one’s own ‘soul’ is produced,510 similarly the knowledge of ‘pleasure,’ and 

so forth,511 which are inherent in one’s own ‘soul,’ is produced \[as well\]; having explained yogic perception, he \[now\] explains the inference –

***9.18. \[the sentences\] ‘this is the effect of this,’ ‘this is connected ***

***with this,’ ‘this is inherent in one and the same thing,’ ***

***‘this is in conflict with this’ all these \[expressions\] are ***

***\[dependent\] on the mark \[of ‘that X thing’\]512***

after having shown only the connection between ‘this is of that,’ now he distinguishes between ‘cause and effect’ and so forth; by the grasp of \[the words\] ‘effect, cause’ it is understood that the defining indicators are only inherent in the genera and so forth; by the word ‘connected’ there is the conceptualisation of a ‘conjunct,’ 

such as smoke and so forth; other things are explained in the sūtra beginning with 

‘saṃyoga’; in this respect, Vṛttikāra513 says: ‘whosoever sees without doubt one part of an object in the relation established, in this way his remaining consideration is produced from the vision connected with the characteristic mark.’

***9.19. thereby, \[knowledge derived from\] word-sound is explained514***

just as inference presupposes the memory of an effect and so forth, which is the object-matter of a supra-sensual perception \[and is subject\] to the 3 tenses 

\[past, present, future\], 515 similarly the \[knowledge derived from\] ‘word-sound’ 

is dependent on the memory of convention and is the domain \[which covers\] the 3 temporalities, and is something beyond sense-perception;516 therefore, because inference possesses one and the same subsistence \[with śabda\] inference is to be ascertained \[as a result\]; if you \[asked\] as to what is the meaning of word \[śabda-pramāṇa\] then this would be stated –

less, since yoga entails mental motion, it must have only an intellectual role to play, a mediating role, not necessarily directly soteriological. 

[^512]: if glosses 9.13–17 dealt with perception, from VSc 9.18 onwards the commentator deals with inference, which is a second major epistemological pramāṇa in Vaiśeṣika. 

[^513]: Candrānanda quotes from an unknown ‘author of the Vṛtti commentary’ \(Vṛttikāra\), which is currently lost. 

[^514]: śabda-pramāṇa may be a ‘linguistic type of knowledge,’ subsumed under anumāna \(inferential logics and dialectics\). 

[^515]: allusion is made here to a supra-ordinary form of knowledge that transcends senses and temporality; later, in VSc 9.28 the commentator returns to it. 

[^516]: the theory of language in Vaiśeṣika is that sound-word \(śabda\) is not eternal, therefore the meaning, like knowledge itself, is a ‘composite entity or process’; that is to say, language is merely conventional, established by God or seers who possess the power to name, define, and memorise things and their essences, see, for instance, VSc 6.1.13.

[^517]: ‘comparison’ \(upamāna\) is not a different pramāṇa but is rather sub-included under 

‘inference’ \(anumāna\). 

[^518]: the gloss finally elucidates that there are no more than 2 pramāṇas; confusion may be created due to the subsuming under inference of other ‘sub-pramāṇas’ such as śabda, smṛti, and upamāna.

***9.20. reasoning, invalid argument, inferential mark, instrumental ***

***cause, means of knowledge, causation, these are synonymous***

by words such as ‘hetu’ \[reasoning\] and so forth, he ultimately explains the cause; reasoning \[and\] pretext means cause; thus, if you ask how the word can be a cause, the mark for understanding the existing object is:

***9.21. because of the \[object’s\] dependence on ‘cognition’ ***

***\[we can say\] ‘this belongs to this’***

just as ‘for the object of understanding, the movement of the hand should be understood as the cause,’ in that way someone who has understood the convention conceptualises the object after having seen the movement of the hand, and then, from its sound, as it \[is expressed in the sentence\] ‘for the sake of knowledge of this object, this word is the cause,’ one \[observer\], as a result of an established convention, conceptualises from the sound-word the object of the cause, just as worldly people conceptualise an object through gesture and so forth, hence, this word is the indicator of the meaning because of a convention \[between them\] as stated by the author of the Vṛtti that this \[word\] is the cause; in this way comparison and so forth are included \[in inference\]; 517 hence, the means of knowledge are only 2; and the means of knowledge is proved \[by the word\] ‘anena \[‘hereby’\] it is known,’ or by ‘pramā’ \[which indicates the authoritative\] means of knowledge;518 

memory is a part of inference, as expressed \[as follows\] –

***9.22. memory \[comes into existence\] from a particular ‘conjunction’ ***

***between ‘mind’ and ‘soul’ and because of a ‘latent impetus’519***

the visualisation of the rising of smoke follows from the perception of fire due to a \[perceptual\] ‘conjunction’ between ‘soul’ with ‘mind’, and from a specific 

\[impression\] called ‘bhāvanā’ \[expressed in sentences such as\] ‘whenever there is fire there is smoke,’ memory is produced. 

[^519]: saṃskāra \(latent impetus\) in VSc 9.22–4 deals with memory from sleep, whereas from VSc 9.25 onwards with memory in the awakened state.

[^520]: ‘svapnāntika’ might be the deep part of the dream, sub-consciousness in dreams, or the ‘awareness of dream.’

[^521]: the difference between a ‘voluntary dream’ caused by mind \(svapna\) and an ‘involuntary dream’ \(svapnāntika\) is that the latter is caused by karmic conjunctions that are beyond man’s control. 

[^522]: knowledge about dream indicates the ‘law of karma’ that is enacted by auspicious and inauspicious deeds caused by dharma and adharma. 

{{247}}

***9.23. and similarly, dream and ultimate consciousness520*** *** \[are produced\]***

dream is when knowledge concerning \[a person’s\] senses are stopped, and ‘mind’ 

is calm, which \[knowledge\] is produced by mind alone, \[but\] the ultimate consciousness and the knowledge of dream are both produced from a particular 

‘conjunction’ between ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ and the ‘conjunction’ based on an earlier experience which is associated with ‘bhāvanā’ \[mental energy\]. 521

***9.24. and from ‘dharma’ \[and adharma\]522***

knowledge concerning a dream whose object has not even been experienced is the subject-matter of ‘auspicious’ and ‘non-auspicious’ \[things\] due to ‘dharma’ 

\[merit\], and because of the word ‘ca’ \[in sūtra 9.24\] there is another ‘adharma’ \[as well\]; however, concerning \[cognition in an\] awakened \[state\] –

***9.25. \[there is\] ignorance because of a defect in the ***

***senses and because of a latent impression***

\[in the case of a person\] whose sense-organs have been affected by a defect \[doṣa\] of wind and so forth, from a latent impression caused by an earlier experience of lunar station \[asterism rajata\], as well as because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘mind’ and 

‘soul’ dependent on a particular dharma, 523 then \[defective\] knowledge occurs concerning for example \[the confusion between\] silver and an oyster shell; for instance the hesitation of the visualisation between a ‘southerner’ and a ‘camel.’

***9.26. that is defective knowledge***

whatever knowledge is characterised by ‘dream,’ ‘non-recognition,’ ‘reversed knowledge,’ \[or\] ‘doubt,’ that is defective \[cognition\] and is not a valid means of knowledge. 

***9.27. flawless \[knowledge\] is \[considered\] ‘vidyā’ \[authoritative\]***

whatever knowledge is not defective, that is called pratyakṣa \[perception\] and anumāna \[inference\], and that is called ‘vidyā’ ‘vidyā’ \[authoritative\]. 

[^523]: ‘viśiṣṭādharma’ may well be an allusion to ‘antyaviśeṣa’ \(VS 1.2.6\) which is the ‘cognitive factor’ for the identification of causes of illness; the mention of doṣas such as ‘vāta’ and so forth, shows that the Vaiśeṣika system plays a role in the Ayurvedic aetiology, in its medical practice, for the medic, like the yogi, is the observer who must introspect the ultimate particularity of any disorder, be it of either a physical or mental order; since antyaviśeṣa is a factor that differentiates the non-composite eternal substances, here the illness lies in the corrupted ‘soul,’ not the fundamental elements wind, fire, water, and earth.
