[^524]: from the main features of siddhadarśana and the reference to vipāka, we may perhaps be entitled to raise the question as to whether the distinction between siddhadarśana versus ārṣajñāna may correspond to the difference between abhyudaya and niḥśreyasa, where abhyudaya is a ‘worldly’ elevation, an upgrading to superior cosmic levels, where siddhadarśana seems to play a role; niḥśreyasa however, is very different from abhyudaya; it is like the difference between ārṣajñāna and siddhadarśana \(ārṣaṁ bhidyata iti varṇayanti\) whereby the latter seems to contain a spatial, dimensional or cosmic knowledge; at any rate, neither of them should be confused with yogipratyakṣa, which is a perception that plays a role in the soteriological-cognitive process of the knowledge of categories; the forms of knowledge discussed in the ninth adhyāya: duṣṭa and aduṣṭa, ārṣajñāna and siddhadarśana represent the Vaiśeṣika theory of perception, and are only extraordinary types of knowledge, not pramāṇas.

***9.28. knowledge of visionary sages and \[that\] of ***

***the perfectible ones is from dharma***

regarding the knowledge of the divine sages not grounded on the sacred texts, which \[knowledge\] is not based on inferential marks such as dharma and so forth, regarding, past, present, and future things which are beyond the reach of sense-organs, that is \[knowledge\] intuitively produced and it only sometimes belongs to worldly people \[when they announce\] ‘my heart tells me that my brother will come tomorrow,’ this \[knowledge\] is called aṛṣa \[seers’ knowledge\] being derived only from speculative logic, and guess, its result is only non-ascertainment; however, the \[knowledge\] of the perfectible sages is \[achieved\] from eye-anointment and chemicals, and \[perceives\] minute, hidden, \[and\] remote things, and discerns the ripening of dharma and adharma caused by \[the activities of\] celestial living beings, and those from the intermediate regions, and so forth; such knowledge is not different from perception and inference, \[but\] the sages’ visionary knowledge is different, thus it is explicated;524thus, this and that knowledge – of the sages and the knowledge of the perfect people – is produced from a ‘specific dharma’525 and from a contact between ‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

**// this is the ninth chapter //**

**10. **

**/ the tenth chapter /**

thus, since the earlier discussion concerning ‘cognition’526 is not complete, \[the author\] says that ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are the supporting basis of ‘cognition,’ 

‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’; 527 for example, some people say that ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ and 

‘chimeras’ are beings; \[but\] this is not so, 

[^525]: Candrānanda allocates a lot of scope to Vaiśeṣika’s ‘theory of difference’ in which he sees the capacity to offer a valid tool which responds to all needs; he offers several types of knowledge, siddhadarśana, aṛṣa, yogipratyakṣa, for 2 different kinds of purposes: abhyudaya and niḥśreyasa. 

[^526]: the tenth chapter ends with the restatement of soteriology, according to which, the nature and function of ‘cognition’ play a mediating role in achieving that. 

[^527]: in other words, such vaiśeṣikaguṇas exist in themselves, they cannot have other vaiśeṣikaguṇas as their substratum, because their substratum is the embodied ātman; if ‘pain’ and ‘pleasure’ were permanent and existed in themselves, then ‘liberation’ 

would be impossible, but this is something which the commentator rejects.

[^528]: each soul has its own set of ‘specific qualities’ \(vaiśeṣikaguṇa\) that are experienced individually and not by any other self; in addition to the individualistic and unique experience of ‘I’ \(ahaṃkāra\), this argument is proof of the existence of the plurality of the souls. 

[^529]: once again, dualistic epistemology is prevalent in Vaiśeṣika categories. 

[^530]: how can qualities be in one single subject-matter and yet many? what is their identity when they inhere in an object; a possible response to the manifoldness of qualities should be sought in relation to the variety of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’; see the argument for the plurality of the souls in āhnika VSc 3.2. 

{{251}}

***10.1. co-existence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ in the ‘soul’ is ***

***the cause of the \[knowledge of the\] difference between ***

***the 5 elements which constitute \[one body\]***

whatever co-existence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ exists in the ‘soul’ itself, that is the cause of a different subject-matter from the 5 elements \[mahābhūta\] ‘earth’ and so forth, and from the qualities such as ‘smell,’ ‘colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ inhabiting their substratum \[5 elements\], \[and this is\] because there cannot be co-existence of qualities there, or in another soul \[at the same time\];528 and the inherence of the 2 \[pain and pleasure\] in the ‘soul’ is one and the same with ‘I-consciousness’ 

\[ahaṃkāra\]; in spite of their co-existence in the ‘soul,’ \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***10.2. because \[‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are caused\] by a ***

***specific ‘desirable,’ ‘undesirable’ \[fact\], and because ***

***of their reciprocal opposition, ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ ***

***are existentials different from \[each other\]***

‘pleasure’ is produced from causes such as women, and so forth; ‘pain’ is produced from causes such as poison and so forth; ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are mutually opposite, because their production \[happened\] from mutual destruction; 529 therefore, there is difference between them and there is no identity \[between them\] 

through their co-existence in one object \[and\] its manifoldness;530 if you say that doubt and conclusion are based only on mutual non-reality \[but\] they are not actually existing things, \[then the answer is\] no, 

***10.3. and doubt and conclusion are different from each ***

***other, and this is the proof of another ‘cognition’***

manifestation of both doubt and conclusion is caused from the difference of their separate uniqueness, each of which possessing a different meaning; thus, doubt is produced in regard to a person who wants to know the particularity but who has not understood that particularity is due to the contemplation of generality;531 

another doubt is when after having understood the particularity through another means of knowledge, there comes \[as a result\] the discernment that ‘this is only a pillar \[not a man\],’ if these two things were not real then they would not be produced from causes which are different from each other; therefore, doubt and conclusion are 2 forms of knowledge different from each other, but the conclusion does not differ from perception and inference, this is what some people say. 

[^531]: the reality of ‘universals’ is possible only after the knowledge of ‘particularity’ has been grasped; the knowledge goes from simple to complex; without particularity the knowledge of the universal becomes the knowledge of generic things, \(epistemic generalisation\) which often leads to confusion and doubt; particularity and universality are opposite but equivalent terms for they imply each other; concerning universals in Aristotle see De Int 7.17a38–41; Met 7.13.

[^532]: viśeṣa \(particularity\) is that which defines the theory of perception in Vaiśeṣika from the highest visible level to the most minute invisible level. 

[^533]: ‘thing brought forth’ may refer to a thing from the past, the next sūtra refers to a thing from the future. 

{{253}}

***10.4. production of both \[doubt and conclusion\] is ***

***explained by the \[different\] means of knowledge ***

***\[pramāṇa\] perception and inference***

just as, when a person having memory – after having seen directly the mark of himself – this knowledge is not perceived in the same manner as that of the man who has only seen something generic, and having a particularity from memory wishes to investigate and grasp the particularity \[when the particular is not known\] 

a doubt arises as \[expressed in the question\] ‘is \[this\] a pillar or man’; and just as, by a contact with a past thing a perception as \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘this is an object like this’ is produced, in the same manner, conclusion-judgement takes place because of a contact with the particularity532 after doubt has been removed; now he explains the ‘cognitions’ of cause and effect –

***10.5. perception is explained with a thing brought forth \[already\]533***

after effect is produced from its own causes \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘this effect has occurred \[so\] it is produced,’ this is a cognition of effect \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘through the knowledge of adjective-qualification there is the knowledge of the qualified \[thing\]’ by means of this rule ‘that’ \[cognition of effect\] is produced, and it is the chief subject \[of cognition\]; elsewhere \[this subject-knowledge\] is secondary because of the absence of effect; thus, when the effect is going to be produced, 

***10.6. \[effect-knowledge exists\] because is seen in a subsequent effect ***

***\[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘it will happen’ \[in the future\]***

such as after an uninterrupted collection \[of causes\] as it must happen, 534 an effect such as a pot and so forth has been visibly produced, so also, now, after having seen that type of collection \[of causes\] even though the effect is not \[yet\] produced, having used the word ‘kārya’ \[effect\] metaphorically, the cognition concerning effect is produced \[as in the sentence\] ‘effect will happen’;535 although 

\[effect\] is being produced –

[^534]: ‘uninterrupted collection as it must happen’, refers to the necessity of the endless chain of causation entailed by the indestructible relationship between cause and effect \(vyāpti\); cause requires an effect, and effect requires a cause, both ontologically and epistemologically. 

[^535]: the epistemology of the system takes a logical-inferential turn not least because everything including ‘time’ is composed of parts which stand in a relation of interdependence; if, from an ontological point of view, there is a reality such as ‘present,’ then one can naturally assert the reality of subsequent temporal parts, ‘past’ and ‘future’ 

moments, whereby they necessarily presuppose each other.

***10.7. similarly, \[cognition of effect\] happens from both ***

***dependent and independent \[causes\]***

when there are threads spread out, dependent \[on each other\], the earlier and earlier connections are not \[yet\] comprehended, \[but\] after the ‘conjunction’ is no longer there, one comprehends the subsequent independent \[threads\], and observes the subordinate effects such as stripes and so forth; the production of the effect \[as in the assertion\] ‘this is an effect’ is in relation to the design of the ‘conjunction’ between produced and non-produced \[entities\] when there is the sight of the production of an effect from cause, this is \[how\] cognition is generated; just as there is production, so also there is destruction \[of things\] by some other effort \[or forces\], as in the case of pot substances and so forth, whose destruction is ‘abhūt’ 

as explained in \[the sentence\] ‘bhūtapratyakṣābhāvāt’ \[‘due to the absence of the past thing’\] \[VS 9.6\] and so forth, thus such things are told regarding the body which is the subject to transformation and so forth \[which is an effect of causes\]; regarding a destroyed \[thing\] –

***10.8. \[cognition of\] a ‘past thing’ is536*** *** from the ***

***\[cognition of another prior\] past thing***

meaning of ‘abhūt’ \[refers here to\] a destroyed \[thing\]; after having comprehended separately, \[body\] parts such as hand, foot, neck, and so forth, because of the ‘conjunction’ with a non-inherent cause which is destroyed when the effect-

product is destroyed,537 then there is the comprehension of ‘effect-product called body was there’; but when \[effect-product is\] destroyed –

***10.9. it exists also, because of the non-inherent effect \[in cause\]538***

because of the word ‘ca,’ \[we say that\] ‘conjunction’ \[both\] exists \[as well as\] is destroyed, for although the operation of the destroyer-cause does not destroy the body parts such as neck and so forth because of \[their\] conjunctions, and other parts of the body such as hands and so forth are destroyed due to disjunctions, an effect is not inherent in the body, because the destruction \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘effect is being destroyed’ is noticeable in the relation between a destroyed 

\[thing\] and a non-destroyed \[thing\], this is how knowledge generates; yet, other 

\[thinkers while\] commenting upon this, explain that ‘the past thing is an effect,’ 

\[but\] that is not correct because of the destructibility of the effect has been operated by that \[cause\]; and ‘cognition’ is \[produced\] like this –

[^538]: the non-inherence of the effect in the cause, according to asatkāryavāda, means that the effect cannot ‘pre-exist’ in the cause; effect exists only if there is a cause; alternative translation: ‘when it \[conjunction\] exists \[and when it does not exist\] \[cognition is possible\] because of the non-inherent effect \[in cause\],’ the alternate existence of ‘conjunction’ to exist and not to exist, is indicated by the conjunction ‘ca,’ see Thakur 2003: 119.

[^539]: viśeṣas are abstract individuals which stand beyond the visible particulars of the body \(head, back, belly, hand\); to put it differently, one may say that there is the ‘particular head’ on the one hand, but what viśeṣa indicates is perhaps that there is also an 

‘essence’ of a head, on the other hand, which is invisible to the naked eye. 

[^540]: sāmānyaviśeṣa has been translated here differently, and not in terms of ‘universal particularity’ or ‘generic specificity’ as elsewhere in this edition. 

[^541]: when it is said that ‘the first cognition’ is ‘the substance as a cause’ by this it is meant that ‘substance is the first and foremost category of knowledge’ among all padārthas, and in a sense the most important one; before knowing the effects of things, one needs 

{{257}}

***10.10. \[effect-product\] exists because it has been seen, with other ***

***caused-things, in one portion of one body, this it is one only***

when \[body\] parts such as hand and so forth, are inherent in an effect-product body and so forth, and sometimes in one and the same subject, then, the ‘cognition’ of the parts is comprehended; now, the production of cognition \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘the effect happened,’ is after a separation from that \[cause\], and after having comprehended their divisibility, both ‘in that’ and ‘each instance’; 

\[regarding the question\] which are these limbs, \[he\] says this –

***10.11. head, back, belly, hand, these are \[known\] ***

***by their ‘particularities.’539***

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that head, and so forth, are the limbs whose knowledge is produced from headiness and other parts, which have their own ‘generalities’ and ‘particularities’; 540 however, regarding the ‘cognition’ of cause \[Kaṇāda\] 

says –

***10.12. cause is \[known\] from the co-existence of effect in the essence***

the first ‘cognition’ \[expressed by the sentence\] ‘substance is the cause’541 takes 

place when one sees the effect of the substance or quality or motion inherent in 

\[that\] substance from which an effect is produced; when, however, \[effect\] has not 

\[yet\] been produced –

***10.13. or \[is known\] from a ‘conjunction’ \[with something else\]542***

even when ‘effect’ is going to be produced \[in the future\] through mutual ‘conjunction’ of threads and so forth, \[then\] cognition concerning ‘conjunction’ as the cause of the cloth is produced; the production of ‘cognition’ of cause \[derives\] 

from the effect that will be produced \[such as\] cloth is preceded by threads and so forth, 543 which stand in a mutual relation.544

to identify, inductively, the cause, which is the substance itself which is the cause and substratum of the effect-products. 

[^542]: as we know, there is a difference between ‘conjunction’ and ‘inherence.’

[^543]: in this case, thread is the cause while cloth is the effect; ‘preceded by threads’ means that threads are the cause of the cloth; a similar cause-effect discussion occurs in VSc 10.15. 

[^544]: ‘cognition’ is a ‘composite process’; in this case it is the mutual composition between cause and effect which is always intertwined; cognition should not be understood as the faculty of one organ, such as mind, as in Western philosophy.

[^545]: Arena in his Italian edition \(VSi\) 1982: 200, translates that motion is not an inherent cause, see also VSc 10.12. 

[^546]: ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are independent entities that work separately, not as cause-effect would do; therefore, the commentator says that they have no dependent cause; that is to say, they are ‘independent.’

[^547]: ‘inherence of their cause in the substance’ means that the qualities ‘conjunction’ and 

‘disjunction’ reside in their substratum, the substance. 

[^548]: something is caused because of the ‘inherence in a cause’; if a colour cannot be produced without being inherent in the cause, does this mean that effect pre-exists \(or inheres\) in the cause? 

{{259}}

***10.14. \[knowledge of cause\]545 is due to the ***

***co-existence of causes in motions***

because in ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ there is a non-dependent cause,546 and 

because of the co-existence of their cause in the substance, 547 motions cause the 

‘cognition of cause’ as soon as they are produced; now regarding the \[cognition of\] qualities –

***10.15. similarly, colour \[is known\] because its cause ***

***is inherent in \[another\] cause548***

cloth and so forth549 is that which has the nature of a product inherently connected with a cause, whereby the inherent cause is the threads in regard to cloth and so forth, the form-colour and so forth are called cause because of being inherent in the cause of causes; 550 because of the word ‘ca’ \[‘and’\] even though the form of effect is not \[yet\] produced, there is still cognition of cause. 

***10.16. regarding ‘conjunction,’ \[this is known\] because ***

***of its co-existence with the cause551***

cognition of ‘conjunction’ as a cause concerns substance \[cloth\] due to the co-existence with threads and so forth, which are the inherent causes of the effect cloth and so forth; however, regarding the origin of qualities and motions –

[^549]: ‘and so forth’ \(or ‘etc.’\) refers here to cloth and similar products, all of which are presumably made of the same material, threads. 

[^550]: even an effect can be considered a cause, which allows for an endless chain of causality; the expression ‘the cause of causes’ shows the infinity of the events and cosmic manifestations; the knowledge of the ultimate essence of such causes \(the substance\) is therefore the means to acquire ‘liberation’ which is the state that puts a halt to this endless chain of causality. 

[^551]: since the previous sūtras discuss the various causes, the subject of the sūtra I take to be the ‘cause.’

with fire is the cause of the things produced from heating because of the inherence; the ‘conjunction’ with a speedy substance is the cause of motion due to the co-existentiality of the motion in the cause, which is to be destroyed and due to the non-cause which is the destroyer \[of the motion\]; yet, regarding \[things\] made of heating –

***10.18. particularity \[is known\] because fire is in close ***

***contact with the contacted thing \[when burning\]***

regarding the inception of the form-colour produced from the heating of atoms, a ‘conjunction’ is dependent upon a specific quality, namely hot-touch which is inherent in the contacted fire; except for the substance, in other situations, ‘conjunction’ is a dependent cause; regarding beyond-senses \[cognition\] such as the past things –

***10.19. the authoritative inferential means of ***

***knowledge has been explained552***

\[means of knowledge based on\] inferential marks is called ‘parokṣa’ \[beyond eye-perception\], the inference \[anumāna\] is that which is known by means of effects \[in sentences such as\] ‘it will become’ and so forth, thus, the means of knowledge have been explained; in the beginning of this science \[Vaiśeṣika philosophy\], dharma was announced as that which is to be explained, therefore, in order to coordinate the meaning of the 2 sūtras \[the one from the beginning\] with the conclusion, even though it has been explicated, \[nevertheless, now, Kaṇāda\] 

explains it again –

***10.20. \[acts\] which are explicitly stated,553*** *** \[acts\] whose ***

***purpose is seen, \[acts\] whose purpose is not seen are ***

***\[all acts which lead\] to ‘mundane elevation’554***

performance of acts which are seen in the śruti and smṛti \[texts\] when their purpose is not \[visibly mentioned\] is for the sake of elevation, this is the meaning 

\[of the sūtra\]; the achievement of \[dharma\] is stated in the sacred texts; and the authority of the sacred texts is well-established –

[^554]: this sūtra is identical with VS 6.2.1.

***10.21. because \[the sacred texts\] are the speech of ‘Him’ the ***

***sacred texts are authoritative means of knowledge***

Bhagavān which means Īśvara \[and\] is known through the effect-products such as body, cosmos, and so forth, \[and\] since He composed the sacred texts, \[these texts\] are established as authoritative; the word ‘iti’ \[in the sūtra\] means comple-tion \[of Vaiśeṣika philosophy, here\]; hence, by the knowledge of differences and similarities between substances and so forth, through the production of knowledge \[obtained\] by the means of ‘detachment’ \[from the world\], and through the acquisition of a special knowledge about ‘adoration’ that follows a successive order of precepts such as ‘the soul should be known,’ and so forth, \[by all of these\] 

there is achievement of ‘absolute liberation.’

\[colophon\]555

/ he who gives always delight to the moon, is like the \[moon\] which gives bliss to the entire world / \[such a moon\] belongs to the night of knowledge, \[so also\] Candrānanda prepared this commentary //

// thus, the commentary on the Vaiśeṣikasūtra is concluded \[here\]//

[^555]: the colophon displays a play of poetic words using the simile of the moon \(symbol of knowledge in dark or ‘confusing’ times\); the Vaiśeṣika student should identify the main subject, which is the author himself, Candrānanda, and not the moon; Candrānanda resembles the moon because by ‘differential knowledge’ \(Vaiśeṣika philosophy\) he dispelled the darkness of knowledge, which is ignorance about reality.
