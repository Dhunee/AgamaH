1 I have amended the compound conventions printed by Muni Jambūvijayaji and decided to follow instead the advice of Bjarne Wernicke-Olesen by keeping compounds united \(guṇa and vrddhi\) and elsewhere to apply word division, however, possible inconsistencies may occur. Since the gloss is too brief, I have decided not to capitalise the beginning of sentences in either transliteration or translation. For variant manuscript readings, I recommend a comparison between Jambūvijayaji’s footnotes and other valuable contributions of new manuscript readings by Harunaga Isaacson \(in his PhD 

unpublished thesis, 1996\) and Ferenc Ruzsa, whose ‘critical edition’ and transliteration on [VSc is available online \(academia .e du\). ](http://dx.doi.org/academia.edu)

2 this is one of the several alternative names by which Kaṇāda, the founder of the Vaiśeṣika system is mentioned in Sanskrit literature; others include Ulūka, Kaṇābhuj, and Kāśyapa. Kaṇabhakṣa may be translated as the ‘atom-eater.’

3 it may refer to the question of whether upahataśarīra refers to liberation during the lifetime \(jīvanmukti\) when ātman has a body.

**1.1**

**/ the first lesson of the first chapter /**

***1.1.1 now, therefore, we shall explain dharma***

a certain brahmin dedicated to the Vedic practice \[having\] fallen away from \[all\] 

impurity \[he\] was now struck by a Vedic sentence: ‘feelings of pleasure and pain cannot touch one without a body at all’ \[Chāndogya Up. 8.12.1\]; then, having pondered on this sentence, he went to Kaṇabhakṣa; 2 therefore \[he\] said: ‘Oh, Blessed, by this sentence it is indicated that the means for release belong to the one who is afflicted in body’; 3 so, tell me, what is the means \[for it\]? then, the sage responded: Dharma4 is; then the brahmin went on: what is Dharma? what are its defining marks? what are the other means for its achievement? what is 

\[its\] purpose? and whom does it benefit? now, regarding the explanation about the definition of Dharma, following these questions, the ‘atha’-word indicates 

\[a discussion to follow\] afterwards; likewise, the word ‘ataḥ’ indicates that \[the teaching\] is imparted, therefore, \[only\] to a pupil endowed with such qualities: 

‘detachment,’ ‘ability to address questions’, ‘intelligence’, which explain the grounds \[for achieving dharma\]; therefore, whosoever \[pupil\] is gifted with \[such\] 

qualities, following the questions raised \[by him\], consequently to such a pupil, we shall afterwards explain Dharma; \[on the question of\] what is Dharma, thus 

\[Kaṇāda\]5 replies –

4 due to the many turns this concept takes, in this gloss it refers to Dharma – spelt with a capital ‘D’ – which is the ‘unified knowledge,’ the ‘soteriontological’ teaching that liberates man from all shackles of cosmos and ignorance; given that there is a whole variety of dharmas that characterise the entities in the cosmos, as well as the cognitive functions of the soul and mind \(see VSc 1.1.5\), Dharma with a capital letter would designate the ‘knowledge and the sum of all infinitesimal dharmas as expounded by Vaiśeṣika philosophy.’

5 ‘iha’ translated sometimes with ‘it says’ or ‘he says,’ whereby ‘he’ refers to either Candrānanda, the author of the commentary, or Kaṇāda the author of Sūtrapāṭha \(Vaiśeṣikasūtra\).

6 ‘abhyudaya’ refers to both ‘worldly and outwardly elevation,’ ‘heaven,’ or ‘mundane elevation’; it is a cosmic concept and should not be confused with the irreversible state of liberation \(mokṣa or niḥśreyasa\). 

7 ‘niḥśreyasa’ represents the ‘absolute state of liberation’ in Vaiśeṣika, which is the ontological state of the ‘soul’ devoid of its ‘specific qualities’; VSc 1.1.2. is the gloss that seems to summarise such an irreversible state: ‘niḥśreyasamadhyātmano vaiśeṣikaguṇābhāvarūpo mokṣaḥ’ \(‘salvation is liberation of the nature of ātman devoid of \(its\) specific qualities’\). 

8 ‘loka’ in Vedic cosmology is an unstable dwelling region, room, or cosmic or heavenly layer, where the subtle selves go as a result of a righteous life spent on earth; different from liberation \(niḥśreyasa\), loka is an impermanent state \(associated with elevation 

‘abhyudaya’\), therefore, those who wish to conclude their existence have the option of aspiring to niḥśreyasa. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 55

***1.1.2. Dharma is that from which there is achievement ***

***of elevation6 and liberation7***

because activities such as ‘sacrifice,’ ‘oblation to god,’ and so forth, which are brought about with ‘ghee’ and ‘flowers’ and so on, dissolve at the very time of their execution, and because they are unable to bring \[dharmic\] fruits at a later time, therefore, dharma is that \[instrumental quality\] out of which both elevation and liberation arise, thus one should understand \[it\]; elevation is the removal of sorrows and the achievement of a desired body in \[a\] world of Brahmā and other intermediate heavens; 8 liberation is mokṣa whose nature lacks \[ātman’s\] own specific qualities; thus, if you asked by which characteristic marks Dharma is known, 

\[then the response would be\] from the sacred texts; \[about\] how authoritative are these? \[he\] says –

***1.1.3. the authority of sacred texts is because \[these\] ***

***represent the speech of ‘that’9***

‘tat’ refers to Hiraṇyagarbha, the Great Ṛṣi, and is \[identical with\] Bhagavān Maheśvara, 10 having been himself made from the golden embryo, thus it is described; the sacred-texts are established as authoritative means of knowledge because they have been stated by a righteous person \[Ṛṣi\] and these are true, since they have been uttered \[primordially\] by Hiraṇyagarbha; and Īśvara is the intelligent agent proved to be the creator of the effect-products, because the body, worlds, and so forth, are \[his\] products, just as the pot is \[in relation to pot-maker\] 

and so forth; having stated dharma’s own nature and definition,11 \[now\] we shall speak about substances, qualities, \[and\] motions, which are \[knowable\] through Dharma; there \[we\] are –

9 scholars such as Frauwallner debated whether ‘tat’ refers to ‘god,’ ‘that’ as a previous something \(sūtra\), or somebody \(Kaṇāda ‘himself’\). The prevalent scholarly view has been that the Vaiśeṣikasūtra is atheistic in ambit, for god is a concept borrowed only later from the Pāśupatas. 

10 the concept of god in Vaiśeṣika should not be read in the key in which Aristotle ‘unmoved mover’ left it \(Met 12. 6, 7, 9; Phys 7. 1; 8. 4–5; De Mot Ani 2–4\); we know that soul is unmoved by nature, but as far as the golden embryo is concerned, God in Vaiśeṣika has an intrinsic effect or action \(kriya\), a fact which draws it closer to Anxagoras’ view on Logos from which all logoi derive; logoi have been translated by ‘seeds’ by a later post-Aristotelian byzantine philosopher named Maximus the Confessor. 

11 definition plays an important role in Vaiśeṣika, so much so that Praśastapāda’s nameability, existence, and knowability form an essential part of it; for a comparative look at Aristotle’s view on definition see An Post. 2.1–13; Top 1.5–6; Met 6. 4. 10–12; 8. 2.

12 although ‘diś’ has been rendered here by ‘space,’ its meaning is broader as it often designates ‘direction’ as a different concept from ‘spatial location.’

13 what is substance in Indian philosophy in general and in Vaiśeṣika in particular is a difficult question to answer and that is due to the eclectic list given by Kaṇāda; once again we must look into other traditions, for instance, Aristotle Cat 5; Met 7. 1, 16, 17. 

14 substantiality is the essence of a substance and contains 2 sets of qualities: \(1\) a set of generic qualities that do not change \(sāmānyaguṇa\), and a set of qualities that are accidental and perishable \(viśeṣaguṇa\); this classification applies predominantly to abstract substances: time, space, soul, and vacuum; accordingly, one also needs to distinguish between ‘essence-substantiality’ and ‘existential-substantiality.’

15 what does meaning mean in Vaiśeṣika? See also Aristotle Cat 1; De Int 1–4, 8; Top 1.15; Met 4.2.1003a33–b15. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 57

***1.1.4. ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ ‘air,’ ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ***

***‘space,’12 ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ these are the substances13***

substances are connected with essence-substantiality; 14 ‘earth’ is connected with earthiness; and in likewise manner, there is the designation of \[water\] and so forth; \[as for\] the manner in which the meaning15 is \[being indicated\] in \[the sentence\] ‘only nine substances and no more,’ the meaning of this is because the word ‘iti’ is \[used\]; thus, substances are described; again, on the question which are the qualities? \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***1.1.5. ‘form-colour,’16 ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch,’ ‘numbers,’ ***

***‘dimensions,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ***

***‘proximity,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ***

***‘volition,’17*** *** ‘aversion,’ and ‘effort’ are the qualities***

these 17 qualities \[beginning with\] ‘form-colour’ and so forth, have been mentioned here; \[but\] because of the ‘ca’-word \[other qualities must\] also be included: 

‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ ‘viscosity,’ ‘impetus,’18 ‘dharma,’19 ‘adharma,’ ‘sound’; these shall be discussed later at the right time; concerning how many motions are there, again \[Kaṇāda\] says –

16 ‘rūpa’ may be rendered by ‘colour’ and ‘form-colour,’ respectively, but other alternatives such as ‘shape’ and ‘figure’ are to be considered too, Halbfass 1992: 104; for a discussion on form in relation to substance and matter see Aristotle Met 7.7–9, 11, 17; 8.2–3; 9.7; 12.1–5. 

17 ‘volition’ \(icchā\), which may be interchangeably translated with ‘desire,’ has been cho-sen in this context because it is an initial form of ‘desire,’ whereby ‘desire’ may be standing between the low level of propensity and the higher level of ‘effort’ \(which is another quality of soul\). 

18 ‘impetus’ \(saṃskāra\) can be of several types; elsewhere it has been translated by 

‘mental impetus,’ but it can be a ‘cosmic impetus’ too, depending on the phenomena involved; like ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’ \(jointly designated with ‘adṛṣṭa’\), saṃskāra is a specific quality that plays at least a 2-fold role – mental and physical. 

19 dharma, as the infinitesimal ‘quality’ of the substance \(soul\) should be analysed in relation to and distinct from Dharma as discussed in VSc 1.1.1.

20 for a discussion about action at Aristotle, see EN 3.1–5; 6 2.4; 7.3; MA 6–7; De An. 

3.9–11. 

21 the 6 categories are substance, quality, motion, universality, particularity, and inherence; the word padārtha occurs here for the first time in the commentary of Candrānanda; in Sūtrapāṭha, there is no indication about the number 6 but here the commentator seems to settle the matter; Categories in VSc may not have the linguistic motivation which Aristotle seems to have ascribed by his 10 categories \(see Cat 1–5, 6–9; Top. 1.9; Met 5.7; 7.1; An Post 1. 27.43a25–43\). 

22 possible locations of the quotes about these injunctions could be traced in the Brāhmaṇas \(SB 8.16.51–52\), see, for instance, Maurice Bloomfield concordance. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 59

***1.1.6. ‘upwards motion,’ ‘downwards motion,’ ‘pressing,’ ***

***‘expansion,’ ‘going,’ these are the motions20***

these motions should be seen as only 5; due to \[our\] perception of motion, \[and\] 

because of the conceptualisation of ‘movement’, the ‘rotation’ and ‘evacua-tion’ and so forth \[have been included too\]; substances, qualities, motions are enumerated; universality, particularity, and inherence will also be mentioned, because of their connection with ‘tat’-word; thus, the true discernment between the 6 categories, 21 their similarity and dissimilarity lead to seeing corruption in objects, \[and\] the detachment from these is the instrumental cause of dharma which leads to liberation; ‘he ought to sacrifice on an even ground’22 this \[injunction\] refers to the substance ‘earth,’ ‘he brings water downwards’ and so forth, each according to its type \[such injunction refers\] to the substances that produce the knowledge of dharma, \[and\] that is conducive to elevation; yet, regarding qualities, there are \[injunctions\] like: ‘he should immolate a black animal’ and so forth; \[while\] in relation to motions there are \[injunctions\] like ‘they thresh rice’ 

and so forth; and, as a result of the discernment23concerning substances, their similarity and dissimilarity, this is the cause of elevation and liberation, for which 

\[reason Kaṇāda\] explains universality24 \[first\] –

23 discernment plays a crucial role in Indian philosophy, but also among the neptic fathers \(Canévet 2014\) for it is a tool by which man distinguishes the good and evil in abstract things and events that come under human senses; a concept that may be useful here is εὐδαιμονία on which Aristotle speaks several times: EN 1.1–5, 7–12; 10.6–8; EE 

1.1–5; 2.1; 7.3; Pol 7.1–3. 

24 ‘commonness’ is expressed in sūtra 1.1.7 as ‘aviśeṣa’ \(‘indistinct’\).

25 on causes in Aristotle, see Phys 2.3–7; Met 6.2; Met 1; An Post 2.2; Met 5.2, 30. 

26 notable are the new concepts, ‘reality’ \(sat\) and ‘eternity’ \(nitya\), respectively; when it is said that the whole ‘category of substances’ is ‘impermanent’ \(transitory\), Kaṇāda refers to the ‘state’ and ‘composition’ that the substances can take; when, for example, a substance earth exists in its atomic state, that is ‘permanent’ because the atoms cannot be further divided, but when the substance earth is in the state of a ‘pot,’ then obviously earth is ‘impermanent,’ ‘perishable,’ because the earth-pot is dissolvable. The same reasoning may be applied to the categories of qualities \(for example, the ‘generic qualities’ 

of the ‘soul’ are permanent, while the ‘specific qualities’ of the self are impermanent, and removable\); presumably motions \(as different from activities, kriyā\) may follow a comparable pattern, for it is said in the sūtra, that they too are ‘permanent.’

27 substances that are composed of atoms, say the mahābhūtas \(earth, water, lustre, wind\), are composed of atoms and represent the chemical composition of various objects \(pot\), biological bodies \(jantu\), and cosmic phenomena \(e.g. thunder\). 

28 order of substances as this emerges in the aphorisms \(sūtra\) is very important; for instance, when the commentator’s enumeration states ‘vacuum and so forth,’ readers should go to sūtra 1.1.4, where the substances are enumerated and see what other substances follow after it, for these too are included in the definition of Candrānanda. 

29 when Nozawa translates ‘in a state of final whole,’ his understanding is probably that whatever exists as non-composite must be a ‘simple whole’; my view is that when a substance is said to be non-composite it means that it cannot be divided further, not that it is ‘simple whole’; the view of ‘whole’ as ‘simplicity’ is characteristic of Latin and Islamic views on ‘essence’; there are 2 concepts in Vaiśeṣika \(pṛthaktva and antyaviśeṣa\) that could prove that the ‘essence’ of a substance in its pre-existential state is both many and one, both ‘particularised’ as well as ‘holistic.’ The system argues, through a network of webs and connections, both the unity and particularity of the visible and invisible world. 

30 By ‘one-distinctness’ \(eka pṛthaktva\), the commentator clarifies what pṛthaktva is, namely the ‘quality’ of an eternal substance that is exclusively ‘pluralised’ by a series of ‘infinite unique distinct entities’ \(antyaviśeṣa\). Distinctness is present not only at the ultimate, infinitesimal level, but at higher levels too, for instance, ‘double-distinctness’ 

\(dvipṛthaktva\) and so forth. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 61

***1.1.7. substance, quality, \[and\] motion, are not different ***

***when: they possess existentiality, impermanence, ***

***substantiality, and \[are subject to\] cause25*** *** and effect, ***

***and when they possess particular universal.26***

‘substance is real, quality is real, motion is real’ this \[sentence indicates\] that reality is a characteristic of all 3 \[categories\]; similarly, the other \[substances\] except for 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, are impermanent; except for atoms,27 ‘vacuum,’ and so forth 

\[time, space, soul, mind\], 28 these are similar in that they have essence-substantiality, and have inherent causality; to be product means to ‘be coming out of a non-existent,’ likewise \[the 3 categories\] are similar except for the eternal substances; the 3 categories \[also\] do not differ because they are causative \[in nature\] and \[are\] 

capable of engendering an effect, such as ‘earth’ and others which are the inherent cause of substance, quality, motion; \[correspondingly\] ‘vacuum’ and so forth are \[inherent cause\] of qualities, for instance, ‘mind’ is the inherent cause of \[the knowledge of\] qualities and motions of the substances when in their non-composite state; 29 as for the qualities ‘colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ ‘smell,’ cool-‘touch,’ ‘num-

ber,’ ‘dimension,’ one-’distinctness,’30 ‘viscosity,’ \[and\] ‘sound,’ \[these\] are non-inherent causes; 31 \[whereas\] ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion,’ 

‘effort,’ ‘dharma,’ ‘adharma,’ ‘mental creative energy’32 are instrumental-causes; 33 

‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ hot-‘touch,’ ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ velocity are both 

\[instrumental and non-inherent\] causes; non-causes are: ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ 

duality, double-distinctness, circularity, and so forth; motions are the non-inherent cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’; the aspect in which the 3 \[categories\] 

are indistinguishable is when they have a particular universality, and \[each of the 3 categories\] have generality; 34 once the similarity of the 3 categories is established, dissimilarity will be stated \[too\]; 35 hence, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

31 the verbs ‘to be’ and ‘to have’ are not always clearly differentiated in Sanskrit, therefore, when it is said that such ‘qualities are non-inherent cause,’ it means that ‘they do not inhere’ in something or that ‘they do not have inherence in something’. 

32 here Candrānanda seems to replace saṃskāra with bhāvanā, which is possibly a synonym for saṃskāra. For him, saṃskāra possesses 2 sub-guṇas called vega and bhāvanā; in Praśastapāda’s PD 85, however, we have what appear to be 3 different sub-guṇas \(vega, bhāvanā, sthitisthāpaka\), where bhāvanā ‘cognitive faculty’ is a sub-guṇa of saṃskāra that defines the ‘non-corporeal’ \(amūrta\) entities such as ‘ātivāhikaśarīra’ as referred to by Praśastapāda \(PD 359\). 

33 these are the specific qualities of the soul, which ātman possesses while in the embodied state; when it is said that they are ‘instrumental causes,’ the commentator perhaps refers to their capacity to bind the pure ‘soul’ into the cosmos. They are the instruments for any activity that the soul undergoes. Soul by nature is motionless, ‘passive,’ yet it can be affected or polluted by ‘active’ forces, such as these qualities are. 

34 the commentator argues that alongside universality and particularity there is genera too. 

35 ‘similarity’ and ‘dissimilarity’ imply each other not only from an ontological point of view, but also from an epistemological point of view; in fact, ontology pre-exists and is the ground onto which the epistemology develops, and it is this stress that distinguishes Vaiśeṣika \(ontology\) from the Nyāya \(epistemology\) system.

36 ‘has no support’ in the sense that ‘it does no longer make sense at all.’

37 allusion is being made here to the theory of asatkāryavāda, which acknowledges the accumulation of something new due to the creative power of a substance to multiply or expand. 

38 ‘wholistic’ means ‘to have parts,’ therefore, limitless, all-pervasive; it refers to a state of absolute ‘complex simplicity’ that is unaffected by the danger of composition and decomposition \(birth and death\), such as the intrinsic nature of the substance ‘soul,’ 

‘space,’ ‘time,’ ‘vacuum,’ and to a certain extent, the ‘atomic mind.’

39 Thakur \(2003: 28\) translates: ‘two or more causes of similar characteristics, having finiteness, motion, colour etc. can originate the effect’; effect may refer here to the newly shaped substance, and to sum up, the substance can ‘produce’ other substance, only regarding its shape not its intrinsic nature; ‘activity’ and ‘effects’ are the appropriate translation for ‘kārya’ insofar as an effect is changeable and impermanent. 

40 these are the ‘subtle substances’ that exist in their pre-existential, pre-manifested, and pluralised state, and can be perceived only by a form of induction that uses 

‘antyaviśeṣa’ as a factor for their real ontological and cognitive determination \(through a dharmaviśeṣa\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 63

***1.1.8. substances generate other substances***

if you maintain \[the existence of\] both a \[singular\] ‘substance’ and \[plural\] ‘substances,’ then one substance cannot generate the separate diffusion \[of a different 

substance\];36 because substances are inherent causes, and they can produce an effect that is different from their own nature;37 but the substances that are holistic38 such as ‘vacuum’ cannot produce \[another\] substance, \[but only those substances\] that have a similar class, or have 2 or many ‘forms,’ ‘concrete shape,’ 

‘motion,’ and so forth, cause the production of effects;39 and ‘vacuum’ and other 

\[substances\] are not of this kind; since ‘mind’ does not possess ‘touch,’ it is not the cause for \[another\] substance, for a holistic substance40 is imperceptible. 41

***1.1.9. and quality \[generates\] other qualities***

like the previous \[gloss runs\], quality is both dual and many; for example, the colour of thread is inherent in the substratum42 of the substance-cloth \[and\] cannot produce \[itself other\] colour\[s\] and qualities indistinguishable from its own 

\[substratum\]. 43

***1.1.10. no motion is known to set up \[another\] motion***

motion does not engender another \[motion\], we notice the cessation of the \[subsequent\] motion;44 the perception of substances which are devoid of motionness would be impossible, if motion engendered motions; 45 thus, certain substances are fabricators, and others are not like that; some qualities are \[the\] cause \[of others\], others are not the cause \[of others\]; motions are never the cause of motion, 46 this is a \[form\] of dissimilarity; concerning another dissimilarity, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

41 Thakur \(2003: 28\) translates: ‘the mind, since it has no touch, cannot be the cause of a new substance and the final embodied substances are also found to be unable to originate a new substance, because the case of origination in this connection is not seen.’

42 Thakur \(2003: 28\): ‘the qualities colour etc. of the yarn produce colour etc. in the cloth which is inherent in their substratum; the qualities of the yarn are not the same with the qualities of the cloth.’

43 Vaiśeṣika stresses further the difference between substance and quality. 

44 See VSc 1.1.2. where Candrānanda presumably maintains that the effects of some ritualistic motions cannot produce new karmic results at a later time. 

45 To avoid ‘infinite regress’ \(groundless logics\), and in order to argue for the possibility of ultimate knowledge and liberation \(which is the ground or the static state\), the system denies the permanent multiplication of action; here a new reference is given to those substances that are ‘devoid of motion’ see VS 3.2.27. 

46 motion has distinct reality, and the fact that it cannot produce another motion shows that what glue and amalgamate entities are the qualities: conjunction \(saṃyoga\) and disjunction \(vibhāga\) which are attached to substances \(e.g. soul\); this gloss draws attention to the ambivalent nature of substances and qualities.

47 Thakur \(2003: 29\): ‘Candrānanda furnished the example of two individual fingers \[substance\] producing a unit \[substance\] of two fingers through “conjunction” where there is no contradiction between two substances. Some more examples have also been cited to show the non-contradiction between effect and cause. We can observe the simple application of the rule in the following fact: cloth cannot be contradictory to its cause, the yarns, i.e. cloth cannot destroy its yarns, and yarns also cannot be contradictory to its effect, cloth i.e. yarns also cannot destroy the cloth.’

48 this gloss mainly describes the various types of ‘non-contradiction’ or ‘non-obstruction’ between a cause and an effect, which otherwise are connected by a union. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 65

***1.1.11. substance is neither obstructed by effect, nor by cause***

obstruction is destruction, suspension; at any rate, a certain substance and so forth cannot be obstructed by an effect, nor by \[any\] substance-cause \[be it\] inherent or non-inherent; when the substance finger is an effect that would produce 2 fingers united, 47 then the union produced with the motion of the motion, \[the effect produced\] does not obstruct the 2 fingers substances and also does not obstruct the inherent and non-inherent substance-causes; and similarly the inch does not obstruct the union between inherent and non-inherent substance-causes, or their relation; mind does not obstruct the substances in their ultimate wholistic state, when there are activities of qualities and motions; ‘vacuum’ and other \[substances\] do not obstruct the qualities because they are permanent and not obstructive causes.48

***1.1.12. quality is both \[obstructable and non-obstructable\]***

both cause and effect are both obstructable and non-obstructable; ‘form-colour’ 

and so forth are existential \[qualities\] as follows: they are not obstructed by both cause and effect in the state of substances utterly devoid of parts, in the atom, atomic dyads, and so forth; \[qualities\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] 

‘touch’ do not obstruct mutually when they are not the product49 of cause and effect \[process\]; when there are words like first, middle, and last, adṛṣṭa produces effects through the contact with speed50 and ‘effort’ in relation to a substance possessed by ‘touch’; while in the case of existential things51 ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion’ these are not mutually obstructed by cause-effect \[relationship\]; ‘cognition’ \[forms\] by a continuous ligature with a ‘latent impetus,’ with \[various\] adversities such as impressions in intellect, 

‘pains’ and so forth, thus is how \[things\] should be understood concerning their 

existential becoming.52

49 bhutā is the existential of the ‘past tense form,’ a product produced a priori. 

50 speed, which is a sub-guṇa of the latent impetus \(saṃskāra\) may refer to a ‘unconscious motion’ effect, whereas effort may refer to a ‘conscious effort.’

51 Thakur \(2003; 29\): ‘now, where there is no cause-effect relation, we see some qualities contradictory to each other, such as “conjunction” and “disjunction,” “pleasure” and 

“pain,” “volition” and “aversion.”’

52 the large taxonomy that the system develops around the concept of ‘obstruction’ 

\(virodha\) shows the Vaiśeṣikas’ urge to systematise the ontological ‘difference’ that characterises the whole of reality.

53 virodha is sometimes translated as ‘obstruction,’ but in the context of vaidharmya, the scope of this daily lesson \(āhnika\) is to describe what is different \(vaidharmya\); the sūtra stresses the radical ontological difference that exists between ‘motion’ and ‘effect’ 

\(product\). For example, consciously throwing a stone into a pond is very different from the unconscious effect of the motion of pebbles. 

54 Thakur \(2012: 29\) translates saṃskāra with ‘tendency,’ see the index for pravṛtti. 

55 ‘prasaṅga’ has been generally translated as the ‘context of an earlier discussion,’ an argument previously discussed, either in the written text or in an oral taught lesson \(āhnika\). 

56 ‘saṃskāra’ is translated as ‘latent impetus’ \(when it refers to cosmic events\) and at other times as ‘mental impetus’ \(when it is used in the context of mental and psychological laws under which ātman is submitted\). 

57 Thakur \(2003: 29\): ‘the effects of motion are “conjunction,” “disjunction,” and tendency; among these three conjunctions alone and not “disjunction” and tendency can contradict the motion.’ Thakur adds the following commentary ‘if the motion were contradicted by the other two, “conjunction” could not appear.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 67

***1.1.13. motion is contrary53 to effect***

among activities there are ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘latent impetus,’54 \[but\] 

motion is antithetical only to ‘conjunction,’ thus, it follows from this situation, 55 

that ‘conjunction’ is not produced, because ‘disjunction’ and ‘latent impetus’56 do 

not \[obstruct motion\]; 57 also another differentiation is –

***1.1.14. defining characteristics of substance are: to be ***

***possessed by activity, to be possessed by quality, ***

***to be an inherent cause \[of another entity\]58***

possessed by activity refers to that substance which has something inherent in it, 

\[and\] whose manifestation is exemplified by an effect caused by the first motion of an upwards motion, from this \[type of manifestation\] ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ 

‘soul’ are exempt; 59 that \[substance\]60 which has quality occurs in the manifestation as exemplified by a quality ‘form-colour’ and so forth;61 inherence, indicated 

by the word ‘iha’62 means \[that entity\] because of which \[these things\] happen which is the existential that is always united with, such as the sustainer is tightly united with the holded \[thing\], and that in which \[inherence exists\] is called inherent \[thing\]; cause is only that which is the cause of an inherent effect; in this respect, \[the concrete substances\] ‘earth’ and so forth represent the inherent cause of the 3 categories substance, quality, motion, \[while the abstract substances\] 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, represent \[the inherent cause\] of qualities; regarding \[substance\] ‘mind’ and those holistic substances \[are inherent cause of\] qualities and 

motions.63

58 Thakur \(2003: 30\): ‘the characteristic features of a substance are that it becomes the substratum of motion and the substratum of quality and it becomes the inherent cause.’

59 That ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and ‘soul’ are substances ‘devoid of motion,’ see VSc 5.2.23. 

60 ‘guṇavat’ must refer here to a substance, see definition of substance in VS 1.1.14. 

61 Thakur \(2003: 30\): ‘qualities are existent in each and every substance according to their capacity.’

62 elsewhere ‘iha’ has been translated by the Latin idiom ‘hic and nunc’ widely used in psychology. 

63 discussion of this gloss demonstrates the classification of the substances in a tripartite taxonomy: \(1\) concrete substances \(the mahābhūtas\); \(2\) abstract substances \(‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ ‘space,’ ‘soul’\); and \(3\) atomic substances \(mind and mahābhūtas in their atomic state\).

64 ‘quality is cause’ only in a dependent manner; alternative reading: ‘quality does not become a cause without expecting another thing in conjunction and disjunction.’

65 quality can become ‘cause’ only with the medium of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction,’ 

plus other quality, or qualities; the chain of specific qualities that cause the birth \(janman\) of a new body is a case in point, see VSc 6.2.17–18; one may further note how such specific qualities are arranged in doubles of duality, one quality presupposing a conflicting one \(dharma and adharma, icchā and dveṣa, ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ 

and so forth\)

66 in relation to its capacity to act as a cause, motion is just the opposite of quality, because it is an ‘independent’ not a ‘dependent cause’ such as quality; it does not require something else in order to create something by the medium of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 69

***1.1.15. defining characteristics of quality are these: to be dependent on ***

***a substance, not possessed by \[another\] quality, \[and\] not to be ***

***an independent cause without ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’64***

‘dravyāśrayī’ means to depend on a substance-substratum, ‘aguṇavan’ means to be devoid of quality; independent \[quality\] is that which is not a cause of \[another\] ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’;65 for example, the ‘conjunction’ between ‘vacuum’ and 2 fingers requires the \[subsequent\] production of 2 fingers when the ‘conjunction’ of 2 fingers and ‘vacuum’ must be done; the ‘disjunction’ and mutual ‘disjunction’ of fingers expect the \[subsequent\] destruction of the effect for the sake of the ‘disjunction’ of 2 fingers and ‘vacuum’; thus, the quality \[‘conjunction’\] becomes cause for 

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ only when it requires something else. 

***1.1.16. defining characteristics of motion are these: it has \[only\] one ***

***substance \[as its substratum\], is devoid of quality, and is an ***

***independent cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’66***

‘eka’ means that motion has one substance as a substratum, not two, or \[it means\] 

that there exists only one activity in the substance, this is how oneness of substance 

\[is being explained\]; ‘aguṇam’ means that motion has no qualities; motion is an independent cause in relation to ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction,’ this means that when 

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are about to happen, having separated their own substratum from another thing, when they are joined with another substratum, they are independent of anything produced \[and\] destroyed; another dissimilarity as well \[is\] –

***1.1.17. essence-substantiality is common ground to \[categories\] substance, ***

***quality, motion***

word ‘sāmānya’ is a synonym for ‘genera’;67 ‘earth’ and so forth are the common 

cause of the 3 \[categories: substance, quality, motion\]; the ‘vacuum’ and so forth are the common causes of qualities because in each substance there can be many qualities, therefore these \[essences\] are being the common cause of qualities; ‘mind’ 

becomes the cause of the qualities and motions in the substances which are partless. 68

67 Candrānanda offers here a ‘general’ and ‘metaphorical’ exegesis; likewise, the following sūtra 1.1.18 refers to generality as ‘similarity’ and ‘repetition,’ not as commonness and identity. 

68 ‘mind’ becomes the cause of qualities and motions in the substances that are partless. It is an important statement for understanding the theory of transmigration in Vaiśeṣika, as explained in VSc 5.2.14 and VSc 5.2.19; passages that explain how manas \(with the quality ‘effort’\) is instrumental in the formation of a new body; yet, elsewhere manas shares with soul several specific qualities such as saṃskāra, which is presumably responsible for the transformation of the ‘soul’ from its all-pervasive ‘partless state’ \(possessed by generic qualities only\) down to its ‘embodied state’ \(possessed by specific qualities too\).

69 this sūtra follows the definition of the previous one, to be the ‘essence cause’ to the 3 categories. 

70 the gloss refers to a snowball effect, whereby motion does not produce another action, but rather its role is to impact the dimension \(e.g. mahat\) of substances and qualities. 

71 ‘substratum’ may refer here to substance and its essence; ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ can only change the substance \(seen as a substratum\) but not its ‘essence’ \(which is unchangeable\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 71

***1.1.18. similarly, the quality is \[defined as common ***

***ground for the 3 categories\]69***

‘substance is conjunctive’ \[1.1.25\], so it is said \[in the sentence\] ‘from a conjunction with fire other qualities are produced’ \[7.1.5–6\] thus it is said, ‘motion in hand’ is because of a connection between ‘effort’ and soul’ \[5.1.1\], such sentences show that only ‘conjunction’ is the common cause of substance, quality, motion, and no other quality can be a cause; for example, motion happens when a ball of cotton becomes conjoined with a cotton in speed, then the 2 cottons come into existence as \[1\] substance, whose dimension being produced is called ‘mahat,’70 

similarly other qualities are being produced mutatis-mutandis. 

***1.1.19. motion is \[a common ground\] of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’***

motion is a common cause of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ because of its combination with a substratum after having been separated from its own substratum. 71

***1.1.20. because of being \[absolutely\] distinct72 there is ***

***no essence-ground among substances73***

if indeed motion were to cause another substance, then the existence of ‘conjunction’ after \[motion\] was made would not re-occur; by \[the sentence\] ‘motion is not cause for substance’ then we recognise only the comprehension of ‘conjunction,’ 

when motion does not exist \[therein\].74

***1.1.21. \[but\] motions are not like qualities \[because ***

***they cannot cause other motions\]***

motion is the cause for ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ impulse, \[and\] stroke \[and all are\] connected with ‘conjunctions’ in either their own substratum or another substratum, but ‘effort’ and the ‘unseen force’ \[are qualities that occur\] only in another substratum; as such, motion cannot cause motion’s own substratum because from an earlier discussion we know about substances that are devoid of \[intrinsic\] activity; nor does motion reside in another substratum, because it ceases to be in conjunction with ‘tat’; therefore, motion is not the cause for motion, because motions are different from qualities which are the causes of motion; another differentiation is –

72 substances are ‘absolutely distinct’ because of the category of viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa, which characterise their intrinsic nature. 

73 ‘motion may not be common cause to substances’ because some of them \(‘soul,’ ‘time,’ 

‘space,’ ‘vacuum’\) do not possess intrinsic activity. 

74 although ‘conjunction’ and ‘motion’ – as we have seen in 1.1.16 – are dependent, they do not overlap, and must not be confused with each other; one happens, the other does not.

75 ‘common effect’ refers here to the repeatability of a substance, its capacity to extend, or create a ‘universal,’ ‘commonness,’ or ‘generality.’

76 more importantly for the understanding of the ‘philosophy of difference’ is the following fact: that number is a quality that begins only from the digit ‘2’ onwards, which means that it is not to be confused with either digit ‘one’ \(zero\) or ‘1’ \(the unit\), which are not counted as numbers, but are rather different concepts altogether. 

77 the quality ‘number’ is being analysed as different from the concept of ‘oneness’ and 

‘unit,’ namely by looking into the ‘general causality’ \(resemblance\) that exists between various ontological categories, and to show, in fact, the difference between the categories. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 73

***1.1.22. one substance is a common effect75 of \[many\] substances***

common effect \[causality\] is like the cloth \[being the effect\] of threads, where a substance shares an essential-genus with either a substance, 2, or many substances. 

***1.1.23. ‘numbers’ beginning with duality76 \[onwards\] have ***

***‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’77***

‘dvitva’ is the common effect of duality of substances, ‘tritva’ is \[the common effect\] of triad and so forth; similarly, in the case of dual ‘distinctness,’ and so forth; ‘conjunction’ takes place in the combination between 2 substances; ‘disjunction’ is after separating the duality \[of substances\], \[and\] because these subsist in many78 \[such qualities presumably\] have ‘commonality.’

***1.1.24. common motion is not known to have effect because ***

***of the non-inherence \[of motion in substance\]79***

because there is negation of co-existence of one motion in many substances, there is no common motion in 2 or many substances. 80

***1.1.25. substance \[is subject to\] conjunctions***

cloth is \[the common effect\] of thread conjunctions; a common effect refers to a substance whose conjunctions are an inherent cause of 2 or many \[substances\]. 

***1.1.26. ‘colour’ is \[is subject to\] colours***

such as the potsherds’ colour is from the colour of a pot, the common effect is the colour which has the substratum of 2 or many substances, colour \[being both\] 

cause and effect, thus \[other qualities\] ‘taste’ and so forth are \[explained\]. 

78 the qualities mentioned subsist in many substratums, substances, or essences; if qualities have ‘commonness’ it follows that they can form ‘universals’ just as substances do. 

79 there is a difference between motion and quality, the former being transitory while the latter being permanent – such a difference being translated in respect to ‘common effect’; it is partly due to the fact that while qualities can repeat themselves, thus able to form a ‘universal’ or ‘generality’ \(e.g. redness\), motions are always successive, thus transitory, and cannot form a ‘permanent whole.’

80 there are substances that do not have intrinsic activity \(VSc 5.2.23\); if substances had intrinsic activity, they would be dissolvable as a result, but motions cannot have other motions inherent in them because they are units, and successive in motion, not simultaneous.

81 ‘upwards throwing’ motion is caused by all 3 qualities mentioned. 

82 gloss gives here the metaphor of the ‘beams of sun on a mountain’ to illustrate the haphazard movement of the beams, which presumably do not follow the usual pattern of the law of gravity; in other words, the movement is caused, not a cause of something else. 

*Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 75

***1.1.27. ‘conjunction,’81*** *** ‘effort,’ and ‘weight’ are \[the ***

***effect-activities\] of ‘throwing upwards’***

when the beams of the sun having no ‘weight’ \[are seen\] on a mountain, 82 and 

this \[in another example\] is because of the absence of ‘effort’ of mud-clay since it is not connected with a hand, \[then\] there is no ‘throwing upwards,’83 therefore 

‘throwing upwards’ is a common effect of ‘weight’ and so forth. 

***1.1.28. ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are \[the effect-activities\] ***

***of motions***

whatever ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are produced from both types of motion these are the common effect of motions. 

***1.1.29. as far as essential cause is concerned, it has been stated that ***

***motion is not the cause of substance or \[other\] motion***

in the discussion where the common cause of substances and so forth is described, it has been said that motion is not the cause of \[other\] substances and motions, therefore these \[substances and actions\] do not become a common effect of 

\[motion\] either; in this way, substance, quality, and motion are established to be 

variegated84 \[in nature\]. 

**// the first lesson of the first chapter //**

83 a second metaphor given is how the blisters such as ‘lump’ can emerge, say on the skin, without having been triggered by scratching; thus, as in the previous metaphor, the upwards movements are triggered by different separate causes; Thakur \(2003: 33\) translates the simile on ‘loṣṭa’ as follows: ‘and as there is no “conjunction” between pebble and hand, there can be no throwing up of the pebble.’

84 ‘nānā’ should not be translated by ‘numerous’ for this would imply number; it should, perhaps, be translated with ‘pluralised,’ ‘variegated,’ because several items can exist as identical, whereas ‘nānā’ refers to difference or uniqueness of identity.

85 as the gloss will make clear, the cause is prior and more important than the effect, and can exist independently, whereas effect is secondary and has dependent existence \(due to asatkāryavāda theory\). 

86 the 3 categories referred to are ‘universality’ \(sāmānya\), ‘particularity’ \(viśeṣa\), and 

‘inherence’ \(samavāya\). 

87 if these real categories are dependent on mind and cognition, the philosophical question that arises is actually to what extent these categories are real; are these compositional elements? Balcerowicz suggested that they should not be equated with mental objects as Brentano might have suggested; in my opinion, here we are dealing with ‘dependent existentials,’ see Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra’s notion of antyaviśeṣa, as being real, yet possessing, nevertheless, only a ‘dependent reality’; this translation has drawn a distinction between cognition and knowledge; on knowledge in Aristotle see Met 13.10.1087a10–

25; De An 2.5.417a21–9; on identity and unity De Int 2; Top. 1.7; Met 6.2; 10.1. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 77

**1.2. **

**/ the second lesson of the first chapter /**

***1.2.1. absence of the effect presupposes absence of cause***

the 2 words ‘kārya’ and ‘kāraṇa’ have been previously explained, \[now\] he examines \[their\] meaning; in the absence of that thread and so forth, the substance as an effect say cloth and so forth is inherently caused either because of a ‘conjunction’ 

or because of an inherent cause; when the cause dissolves, the cloth and so forth dissolves \[too\]; effect \[on the contrary\] is of a different kind. 

***1.2.2. but the absence of effect does not \[presuppose\] the absence of cause85***

again, the non-production of a garment’s ‘conjunctions’ is not because of the non-production of a substance thread and its ’conjunctions’; having stated the association between the 3 categories, universal, and so forth, 86 therein \[he\] explains the universal. 

***1.2.3. universal and particular depend on a ‘cognition’87***

different cases of sacrificial piṇḍa as deriving from the ‘bull-bulls’ sequence are depended on \[Vedic\] knowledge and does occur in the reciprocal differentiation between ‘this one is other than ours’ which is \[the kind of reasoning that\] universality requires an ‘inclusive cognition’88 while particularity depends on an ‘exclu-

sive cognition.’89

***1.2.4. ‘existence’90 is only a universal***

‘existence’ is ‘reality’ and is only universal because it occurs in the 3 categories, substance and so forth, this is not \[to be confused with\] particularity. 

88 ‘anuvṛttibuddhi’ implies repetition, hence the possibility of knowing the repetition of a quality ‘red’ in many substances; as such, it can grasp the reality of the lower universal 

‘redness’; Thakur \(2003: 35\) says that ‘anuvṛttibuddhi’ is the type of cognition of “this is a cow,” \[identical with\] “this is a cow,” in different cases, and the nature of this very knowledge of inclusion is that it is repeated in like manner.’ The question of repetition and difference has been a difficult topic in Western philosophy beginning with Duns Scotus up to modern times with Gilles Deleuze. 

89 ‘vyāvṛttibuddhi’ on the other hand, implies non-repetition, identity, and focuses on what is unique, hence the designation of ‘exclusive cognition’; it is the analytical characteristic of the human brain to identify ultimate particularities and exclude ontological repetition; it is associated by mutual complementarity with ‘anuvṛttibuddhi,’ in the same way as sāmānya and viśeṣa are. 

90 in this context, ‘bhāva’ can translate with both ‘reality’ and ‘existentiality’ \(a state, or a condition, respectively\).

91 in Sanskrit there is often no clear indication between ‘have’ and ‘be, are’; nevertheless, sometimes ‘have’ is indicated by the suffix ‘vat.’

92 to have ‘universal’ and ‘particular’ means to possess a ‘lower universal’ which designates a ‘genus’ or ‘genera,’ which, in Vaiśeṣika scholarship, is designated by one single term ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’; thus, 3 concepts are here: universality, particularity, and universal particularity \(lower universal, or species\). 

93 in order to avoid infinite regress, or contradicting itself, the Vaiśeṣika system locates reality of an ‘entity in itself,’ in its own unique identity; some scholars translate this sūtra as ‘viśeṣas reside somewhere else’ \(other than the categories universal and particularity previously discussed\), this translation would put the reality of antyaviśeṣa under doubt; the sūtra draws a distinction between the category of ‘particularity’ and the ‘ultimate particularity.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 79

***1.2.5. substantiality, qualitiness, motionness, are ***

***\[or have\]91*** *** a universal particularity. 92***

inclusive cognition is that \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘substance has essence-substantiality’ in relation to ‘earth’ and so forth, it occurs in \[the expression\] ‘quality has qualitness’ in relation to colour and so forth, it occurs in \[the sentence\] 

‘motion has motionness’ in relation to upwards motion and so forth, these are 

\[all\] universals \[of\] substantiality, qualitiness, motionness, and are both mutual and exclusive ‘particularities.’

***1.2.6. ‘universal particularity’ exists except in the ultimate particularities93***

‘particularities’ are from particularitiness94 \[and exist\] through co-existence, in the eternal substances, ‘vacuum,’ and so forth, and atoms, and are the cause of the knowledge of ultimate difference \[as in the sentence\] ‘this one is different from that’ in relation to qualities having similar form due to illustrating this \[particularity\]; thus, particularity has been explained; but regarding ‘reality’ \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***1.2.7. ‘real’95*** *** is that which subsists in substance, quality, motion***

‘that because of which’ there is a ‘cognition’ of ‘real, real’ in the 3 differentiated 

\[categories\] substance, and so forth, that reason96 is ‘real’; if it is said that its destruction follows from the dissolution of \[its\] substratum, then \[the answer is\] 

no, because, 

***1.2.8. ‘reality’97*** *** is a completely other \[category\] ***

***than substance, quality, motion98***

since ‘reality’ is separate from substance, and so forth, therefore ‘reality’ is not destroyed when substance is destroyed, and so forth; as for the argument of substances as being differentiated \[from each other\] –

94 ‘particularitiness’ may be equivalent to ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

95 although ‘sat’ and ‘bhāva’ may be synonymous, for precision’s sake, in translation we shall differentiate between ‘real’ \(sat\) and ‘existential’ \(bhāva\). 

96 ‘that reason’ refers to the difficult translation marked with commas in the gloss \(‘that because of which’\). 

97 for ‘sattā,’ this edition proposes the translation ‘reality,’ for it is a broader concept than the nominal ‘sat’ \(real\). 

98 this staunch realistic system builds upon the view that reality exists beyond the visible substances, qualities, and motions.

99 although ‘bhāva’ and ‘sattā’ are slightly different concepts, the Sūtrapāṭha overlaps 

‘sattā’ with ‘bhāva’ by using them interchangeably; that is noticeable in this translation too, chiefly because the subject of the whole discussion here is ‘sattā’ \(VS 1.2.8\) while the subsequent sūtra replaces it with ‘bhāva.’

100 obviously, reality cannot be confused with qualities and motion because their ‘existence’ is already there \(vartamānatva\); when it is said that ‘reality’ subsists in qualities and in motions, the system defines reality as ‘immanent’; in other words, reality is unfolding, and is not transcendent as in ‘idealistic’ or ‘mentalistic’ systems of thought. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 81

***1.2.9. \[reality\] is not a substance, because of the ***

***\[reality of\] oneness of substantiality***

because there is no substance-cause for \[another\] substance such as atomic-substances, ‘vacuum,’ and so forth, because of the connectivity between substance and an inherent cause, a pot, and so forth, has either one or many substances, 

‘reality’ again is comprehended in each of the present things, it has manifold substantiality, \[but\] is not a substance. 

***1.2.10. ‘reality’99 is not a motion, is not a quality, ***

***because it exists in quality and motion***

because no qualities occur in qualities, and no motions in motions, ‘reality’ subsists 

in qualities and in motion, \[therefore\] qualities and motions are not ‘realities.’100

***1.2.11. and \[reality\] is/ has no ‘universal particularity’101***

\[objection\] if ‘reality’ were one among substances and so forth, then ‘universal particularity,’ like in \[the universal\] substantiality, would occur in ‘reality’ too, 

\[such as\] substantiality, and so forth are; \[but\] this is not so; therefore, ‘reality’ is not a substance, quality, motion. 

***1.2.12. substantiality is stated as having one essence-substantiality***

such as substance is not ‘reality’ because \[this ‘reality’\] abides collectively in each substance, similarly substance is not essence because of the individuality of substantiality. 102

101 apart from the ‘universal’ and ‘particularity,’ the system seems to acknowledge the existence of a ‘middle reality,’ namely that of ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\); while revising this translation, Thite insisted on translating ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’ as ‘universal and particularity,’ a view with which the author of these footnotes disagrees. 

102 the fact that a substance \(air, lustre, water, earth\) has a reducible essence \(atoms\), as well as no continuous essence does not preclude its ontological status of substance; both abstract and concrete substances are to be considered substances; only their definition differs.

103 VS 1.2.13 may be read in relation to VS 1.2.11. 

104 substance is not substantiality, which refers to the fact that substantiality may be a type of essence of the category of substance, such as qualitiness is the essence of quality. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 83

***1.2.13. because \[substantiality\] is no ‘universal particularity’103***

if ‘universal particularity’ subsisted in substantiality like something which has essence in substance, and so forth, the essence would be either substance, quality, motion; but essence is not \[the same as\] substance, and so forth. 104

***1.2.14. it is said that qualitiness exists in quality***

because of non-occurrence of qualities in \[other\] qualities, \[and\] ‘qualitiness’ 

occurs in qualities, therefore \[‘reality’\] is not a quality. 

***1.2.15. because \[qualitiness\] is/has no ‘universal particularity’105***

if qualitiness were either substance or motion, then there would be a ‘universal particularity’ existing in substantiality or motionness; \[but\] this is not so; therefore, qualitiness is neither substance nor motion. 

***1.2.16. it said that motionness106 is in motions***

due to the existence of motionness in motion, and because of the absence of motion in motion, motion is not motionness. 

***1.2.17. because \[motionness\] is/has no ‘universal particularity’***

if motionness were a substance or quality, then there would be substantiality or qualitiness in motionness, therefore motionness is neither a substance nor a quality. 

105 ‘reality is only a universal’ or at any rate something that exists only in a ‘holistic,’ 

‘indivisible’ state. VS 1.2.13 and VS 1.2.15 insist on the same idea; the subject throughout these glosses is ‘sattā,’ but VS 1.2.13 sattā is not a quality. 

106 ‘karmatva’ may be translated in this context as ‘capacity of activity’ but in order to avoid a confusion with kārya, which elsewhere has been translated with ‘activity,’ we shall now render ‘karmatva’ with ‘motionness.’

107 ‘one’ \(eka\) refers to a substance state of ‘oneness’; yet, the concept is rather fuzzy, because although ‘eka’ is not a number, yet it is not clear whether the author refers to ‘oneness’ or a ‘unit’; it is also alleged that Kaṇāda may have referred to 2 marks: 

‘absent’ \(abhāva\) and ‘qualified’ \(sa\), respectively. 

108 if there is a term that indicates the ‘essence’ of a thing, then ‘sattā’ may be taken to be one of the most powerful candidates; there are many possible translations for ‘sattā’ as 

‘abhinna’: whole, uninterrupted, undivided, unchanged, unbroken, not different from, integral numbers, unaltered; all substances have both an essential and differentiated state. In VSc 1.2.18, it refers to the essential nature of categories and substances. 

109 the difference in defining something derives from the difference of the characteristic marks, which ultimately leads to the cognition of the ultimate differentiated nature of the substances and their essences. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 85

***1.2.18. ‘existence’ is one, because of the absence of a particularity of ***

***an existing sign, and because of the absence of a specific sign107***

word ‘eka’ indicates non-differentiation, but \[does\] not \[indicate\] ‘number’; the perception of mark, is that by which mark is indicated by the usage of liṅga indicated by \[sentences such as\] ‘sat sat,’ whereby ‘reality’ is recognised because of not being always differentiated, and since there is absence of conceiving the 

‘particularity,’ ‘reality’ has no differentiation.108

**/ the first lesson of the second chapter /**

thus, when the manifoldness of substances and so forth has been proved, and when the oneness of the earth and so forth is indicated, because of the indistinct definition of essence it is \[then\] said that there exists a differentiation because of the difference of defining characteristics \[of each substance\]. 109

***2.1.1. ‘earth’ has ‘form-colour,’110 ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch’***

concerning these, ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ are specific qualities, but the other \[qualities\]111 are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘weight,’ accidental-‘fluidity,’ 

\[and\] ‘latent-impetus’; ‘form-colour’ \[such as\] white and so forth, ‘taste’ \[such as\] 

sweet and so forth, ‘smell’ \[is\] fragrant, and repellent, while ‘touch’ has coldness and hotness when produced by cooking; and its activities are both external and internal \[as stated in 2.1.1\]. 

110 translation of ‘rūpa’ with ‘form-colour’ is left to the discretion of the reader; in Vaiśeṣika context, the term has the potential to explain the ‘diversity-in-unity’ of a substance due to its intimate inherent relation with the substance; it can be translated as ‘shape,’ ‘form,’ and ‘colour’ depending on which substance and which sense-organ the context refers to; each quality usually corresponds to one particular sense-organ, and as Ganesh Thite pointed out, this relation between quality and sense-organ can be determined only if an initial perception has taken place. 

111 by the locative ‘anye,’ Candrānanda refers to the list of ‘generic qualities’

114 vāyu will be translated with ‘wind’ and ‘air,’ respectively, although ‘wind’ is a smaller category than the substance ‘air’ which encapsulates various ‘winds.’

115 the expression ‘kāryam purvavat’ has been encountered already in several places; it sends the reader to the discussion of gloss VSc 2.1.1. where activities are said to be external and internal.

***2.1.2. concerning ‘water,’ it \[has\] ‘form-colour,’ ***

***‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ ‘fluidity,’ and ‘viscosity’***

‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch’ is like white, sweet, and cold; flowing means natural fluidity; viscid means viscosity of these \[waters\]; and ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ 

‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ 

and ‘latent-impetus’ \[these are the qualities of water\]. 112

***2.1.3. concerning ‘lustre,’113 it possesses ‘colour’ and ‘touch’***

‘form-colour’ refers to glittering and white, ‘touch’ refers to hot, only; and \[other qualities in relation to this substance are\] ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ 

‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; their activity is \[stated\] earlier \[as both external and internal, 2.1.1\]. 

***2.1.4. ‘air’114 has ‘touch’***

‘touch’ is not produced by baking, which is neither hot nor cold \[other qualities of ‘air’ are\] ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ 

‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ ‘weight,’ \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; \[their\] activity \[is stated\] earlier115 \[in 2.1.1, as external and internal\]; the bodies belonging to earth 

and so forth subsist into the terrestrial worlds, and so forth.116

***2.1.5 these \[qualities\]117 are not known in relation to ‘vacuum’***

these \[qualities\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ do not exist in

‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction.’

***2.1.6. fluidity of the earthly things like ghee, wax, ***

***common \[characteristics\] with ‘water’118***

‘madhūcchiṣṭaṃ’ refers to beeswax; whatever fluidity of ghee, honey, wax is produced from ‘conjunction’ with fire, that is common in earth and ‘water.’119

116 as VSc 4.2. would clarify, there are cosmic layers, or worlds that have a different substantial or chemical composition: for instance, there is a world of fire or wind, and so forth; this is a Vedic cosmology to which Vaiśeṣika subscribes. 

117 presumably ‘ta’ refers to the doctrine as regards the qualities and the substances discussed by previous sūtras \(‘earth,’ ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ ‘wind’\). 

118 not only water, which makes clay and can be fluid and melting, but also earth and things made of earth, thus with a certain extent, water properties are common and similar to the properties of earth. 

119 in other words, ‘fluidity’ is common to earth and water.

120 all these metals, when in conjunction with fire, become lustre; therefore, fluidity is a quality that characterises them all. 

121 ‘gotva’ is the essence of a bull. 

122 ‘rump’ is the hind part of a mammal’s body or the lower back of a bird. 

123 dharmaviśeṣa is the cognitive property that reveals the inner meaning and essence of the things, whereas words indicate the visible properties of things; in this way we understand both the essence and the feature of things; in Latin scholastic philosophy, we see a comparable theory of perception, known as individuation \(Duns Scotus\)’; in this gloss, ‘essence’ would be a universal \(e.g. gotva\), whereas the property would be, as Scotus indicates, the only thing that is known by our sense-perception; essence 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 89

***2.1.7. lustry things: tin, lead, copper, silver, gold, possess common ***

***fluidity when \[they have\] a conntact with fire120***

because of a relation between fire and those which belong to lustre, because it relates to these, it follows that ‘fluidity’ shares a common nature with ‘lustre.’

***2.1.8. possessed by horns, possessed by hair at the \[tail’s\] end, ***

***possessed by dewlap, these are the visible marks of bullness***

the purpose of this sūtra is to exemplify; ‘gotve’121 aims to indicate an individual characterised by bullness; because it has horns, hump, and dewlap, \[bull\] is therefore called ‘viṣāṇī, kakudmān, sāsnāvān’ \[possessing horns, possessing hump, possessing hump\]; the word ‘prānta’ \[refers to\] a portion of rump, 122 hair is kept in 

it, therefore the word ‘vālā’ means tail; because there is a tail at the end, therefore a bull is described as ‘prānte vāladhiḥ’; by means of words it indicates things, but the indication of the inner meaning of things comes from dharma;123 concerning an individual bull which is not recognisable, its perception, for example, is from 

marks such as horn and so forth, which are those that cause \[us\] to infer it.124

***2.1.9. and ‘touch’ \[too, is a visbile mark of a substance\]***

because it is impossible to have something without a substratum, the comprehension of touch causes \[us\] to infer \[the existence of\] ‘air.’

***2.1.10. because \[usually\] visible things have ‘touch’, we cannot say ***

***that ‘air’ \[which is invisible\] is something which has marks***

if ‘air’ were indeed an object of touch like ‘earth’ and so forth, its grasp would go together with ‘smell,’ ‘taste,’ \[and\] ‘form,’ \[but\] this is not so, therefore \[touch\] is 

a mark of wind which is separate from earth and so forth.125

cannot be known directly, but qualities can; on individuation, see Aristotle Met 5.6.1016b31–5; 7.8.1034a5–8; 8.1.1042a26–31; 10.9.1058b5–12; 12.3.1070a9–13; De An 2.1.412a6–9; De Caelo 1.9.277b27–278b8. 

124 perception is a mediated process, and that mediation comes through the perception of visible marks on the one hand, and from the perception of dharma properties that identify the nature of abstract things, on the other hand; likewise Duns Scotus, an abstract substance has not only an intrinsic essence \(unknowable\) but also an essence that has something added to it, which in the case of Vaiśeṣika is dharma. 

125 Candrānanda wishes to distinguish the touch of wind from the touch of earth; each touch has its ‘particularity’ – its specific dharmaviśeṣa.

126 there are atoms of wind, such as there are atoms of fire, atoms of earth, and atoms of water; all these 4 elemental substances differ from the abstract substances \(time, space, soul, and vacuum\) because these are reducible to a fragmented nature \(atoms\), by contrast with the latter abstract substances which are irreducible, for they cannot change substantially; Candrānanda indicates the difference between 2 types of substances by the sentence: ‘substance can be without substance and \[can\] have many substances.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 91

***2.1.11. \[air\] is a substance-essence because possesses immateriality***

‘air’ is that which has atoms126 as a ‘constitutive essence,’127 it exists because it is a 

substance devoid of an inherent cause and because it is not possessed by substantiality; substance indeed, can be without substance and \[can\] have many substances. 

***2.1.12. and \[air is a substance\] because has effect-activity and quality***

when the definition of substance says that ‘it has motion, possessed by quality’ 

\[1.1.14\] it means that \[substance\] has motion and quality inherent \[in it\], \[therefore\] that \[air\] is a large \[substance\]

***2.1.13. permanence \[of air\] is defined by \[its\] immateriality***

permanence is described by lacking an inherent cause, by not having substantial-

ity when ‘air’ is defined in the atomic \[state\].128

***2.1.14. wind-wind collision is the mark of \[air’s\] manifoldness***

because the collision of wind with a horizontal wind, there is a friction of wind whereby it goes up and then, because it is going up there is a collision, because of 

\[such a\] collision, the manifoldness of air is inferred; and now \[Kaṇāda adds\] –

***2.1.15. the visible mark of air is not known because of the absence of ***

***perception129 of air \[even when\] there exists a contact \[with air*** ***\]***

when for instance \[in the sentence\] ‘this is a bull,’ \[what you have implied are\] horns and so forth united with the perception which exists in the contact between bull and the eye, therefore these are sometimes visible marks, yet this is not the case with the skin when it is in contact with the air because the perception of this ‘air’ is grasped through the perception with that ‘touch’-quality, therefore, that which is comprehended as quality \[the comprehension\] may cause us to infer a non-comprehended 

‘air’; if it is said that \[this is so\] because of the absence of the substratum of this touch, this is due to it being different from the touch of earth and so forth, \[then\]

127 svabhāva; in Vaiśeṣika there might be 2 terms to designate ‘essence,’ whereby svabhāva may indicate ‘changeable essence,’ whereas svarūpa might be ‘static essence’ \(equivalent to antyaviśeṣa, as Vādīndra defines\). 

128 difference between permanence and infinity may be considered here; on infinity at Aristotle see Phys 3.4–8; De Caelo 1.5–7. 

129 ‘perception’ refers to the 4-fold contact between ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ senses, and objects.

130 one of the temptations of superficial and harmful knowledge is the obviation to the details; the Vaiśeṣika system is the exponent of an analytical mode of thinking where divisions and differentiation must be made prior to any form of generalisation; in this gloss, an opposing philosopher denounces Vaiśeṣika’s theory of differentiation by pointing out the visibility of the universal, but the Vaiśeṣikas do not deny the reality of the universal, they only posit that the particular is the ‘real’ lying at the foundation of any ontological description of reality. 

131 The act of ‘naming,’ alongside that of ‘designation’ and ‘knowing’ occupies a major place in Vaiśeṣika. Praśastapāda speaks about the creation of mahābhūtas and the Great Egg that proceeds simply from Maheśvara’s act of 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 93

***2.1.16. \[air seems to be\] indistinct because is seen generally130***

because ‘vacuum’ and so forth are imperceptible \[substances\], because of the negation of ‘air,’ this particular touch is not known from that which is perceived 

\[only\] generically; \[response\] if you say that there is an obstruction between touchability and all-pervasive beings \[vacuum\], how then do you know that ‘touch’ is established as that ‘existential’ which belongs to the elastic ‘air’ only, and is not to be \[considered to be\] a tenth substance? 

***2.1.17. therefore \[we prove air\] from tradition***

\[objection\] therefore, \[some\] declare that ‘air exists’ based on tradition and this subject is only a hearsay; \[but\] this is not so, 

***2.1.18. but \[air\] has been indicated by the act of naming131*** *** ***

***\[made by seers\] superior to us***

Great Lord is more superior to us, and so forth, due to his knowledge and so forth, the activity of giving names done by Him is the mark for the \[existence\] of the 9 substances;132 because the tenth \[substance\] is not named, therefore there are only 9 substances, and as a result, in the expression ‘superior to us’ the touch belongs to ‘air’ only, \[and the use of\] the plural form133 is for the sake \[of devotional\] glorification; on the question of how is that known, this is said –

naming \(maheśvarasyābhidhyānamātrāt\); as it is known, abhidhyāna is one of the 3 powers of speech, according to Praśastapāda’s PD 11: ṣaṇṇām api padārthānām astitvābhidheyatvajñeyatvāni; the ‘categories’ \(padārtha\), Praśastapāda informs us, have 3 major basic features: they possess existence ‘-isness’ \(astitva\), ‘knowability’ 

\(jñeyatva\), and ‘nameability’ \(abhidheyatva\). 

132 in Vaiśeṣika, substances are 9 in number because they been defined by the Lord Īśvara. 

133 as in some modern languages, e.g. French and German, the plural number is used to express a polite form of address.

134 glosses VSc 2.1.18–19 elucidate the system’s philosophy of language, namely that language, even though it is sacred – for it derives from the Great Lord – yet it is arbitrarily designated by God and those superior seers who resemble Him; yet, VSc 2.1.19 says that ‘giving names’ is based on a prior perception; one may ask – if the Lord’s divine language is based on prior perception – is language in Vaiśeṣika eternal? 

135 there is not sufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that the origin of names and language is conventional and that meaning is ‘created’; the term used by the commentator here is ‘praṇīta’ \(past participle\), which means ‘given’ but that should not necessarily imply that such names have been ‘created’; ‘creation of language’ is not 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 95

***2.1.19. \[the seers’\] act of naming is from a prior perception134***

observing the categories through direct perception, they \[the superior seers\] keep 

\[secret\] the names which have been seen when naming a child and when these names are given, therefore we think that there is a Lord who is superior to us who directly perceives the things which are not seen directly by us, and this naming is done by Him \[for\] He has seen all things directly \[even\] those things not directly seen by us, and He has instituted these names. 135

***2.1.20. marks of ‘vacuum’ are these: exiting and entering***

\[objection\] whatever departure and entry of a man that happens through the door, and so forth, not through the wall, and so forth, that is done by the ‘vacuum,’ 

therefore exit and entry are the mark of ‘vacuum’; 136 \[refutation\] if you say that 

‘vacuum’ means absence of \[something\] ‘concrete’ indeed; this is not so, 

***2.1.21. those \[2: exiting and entering\] are not the inferential mark of ***

***the \[vacuum\] because action subsists in one substance \[only\]***

act of exit and so forth which exists in regards to a man, for it is said that ‘motion has one substance’ and there is motionness of ‘vacuum,’ how is it that \[motion of exit and entry\] which is not in the ‘vacuum’ will lead to \[inffer vacuum\] since there is no connection \[between vacuum and motion\]; if you say that just as the act of falling which is sign of heaviness exists in cloth, in the same way, the exit of a man is the sign of ‘vacuum,’ then this is not so, 

***2.1.22. because of the difference \[of exiting and entering\] ***

***is coordinated with another cause137***

it is said that ‘weight’ is the non-inherent cause of motion, then, let it be inferred in the case of ‘vacuum,’ however, that it is not proper to say that ‘vacuum’ is not an inherent cause, because there is a difference between ‘vacuum’ as a permanent substance, and the absence of substratum of ‘vacuum’ concerning ‘weight’ and so forth, which is a non-inherent cause; 138 what has been said \[in the sentence\] ‘the exit by door and so forth’ that is caused by ‘vacuum,’ this is not so, 

one and the same with ‘arrangement of language,’ one is usually the work of a god, the other is the ability of a bard, poet, or seer. 

136 in other words, the non-corporality is the intrinsic characteristic of ākāśa. Arena \(1987:92\) provides his own Italian commentary on VS, refers here to Sāṃkhyakārikā 

38–39. 

137 the alternative translation: ‘“vacuum” is different in property because it results from another cause.’

138 the difference between ‘weight’ and ‘vacuum’ is that while ‘weight’ is a non-inherent cause of motion, ‘vacuum’ is a permanent substance and is without substratum.

139 the mark of ‘sound’ is not the mark of the entry and exit; ‘vacuum’ exists even inside the wall, not only in the door or the ‘space’ indicated by door; this is because ‘vacuum’ however little it might be, is all-pervasive – it is very minute as well as very large; like ‘soul,’ ‘vacuum’ – being all-pervasive – can pervade everything; for example, body cannot go through the wall, but ‘soul’ \[and ‘vacuum’\] does, because it is subtle in nature and all-pervasive means it can pervade the wall. 

140 śabda stands in Vaiśeṣika not only for ‘sound’ as translated here, but for ‘word’ too. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 97

***2.1.23. absence of motion is because of a ‘conjunction’***

exit takes place in connection with \[the subtle\] body and so forth which is the substratum of motion and is connected with a tangible substance such as wall and so forth, and not because of the absence of ‘vacuum’ which because it goes everywhere exists there also \[in exit\], therefore ‘sound’ is the only mark of ‘vacuum’;139 

if you say that ‘sound’ is a quality performed by causes such as drum and so forth, the answer is no. 

***2.1.24. quality of a cause is seen prior to the quality of effect-***

***product, \[thus\] sound has not other manifestation140*** *** ***

***because is not a quality of tangible things***

concerning the specific qualities of tangible things, these can be perceived by each corresponding sense-organ, \[and\] are perceived once the cause-effect production 

\[takes place\]; concerning qualities form and so forth, no portion of ‘sound’ is perceived in a certain section of the drum’s \[music\]; therefore, sound is not a specific quality previously produced by a cause \[such as\] the tangible drum and so forth; and the specific quality of a tangible \[substance\] is the proof of the cognisance of a product as long as it is effect of a cause; but141 ‘sound’ is not like this, therefore it is not a specific quality of tangible things;142 moreover, the specific quality of touchability is produced as long as the qualities exists as effects of a cause, and an effect is not when we see ‘sound’ being produced by \[another\] ‘sound’;143 as a result, due to the non-production of another effect, ‘sound’ is not a specific quality of something tangible. 

***2.1.25. because \[sound\] inheres elsewhere, because is perceptible, ***

***\[sound\] is neither a quality of ‘soul’ nor a quality of ‘mind.’ ***

‘elsewhere’ means it is ‘external’; those qualities of ‘soul,’ such as ‘pain’ and so forth are comprehended by many externally; a quality of the ‘soul’ is comprehensible by an external sense-organ, the \[sound\] however, is directly perceived by ear, therefore is not a quality of the ‘soul,’ consequently, due to eternal comprehensibility and because of the perceptibility through external sense-organ, \[sound\] 

is not a quality of mind; and due to the perceptibility through ear it \[sound\] is \[not a quality\] of ‘space’ and ‘time’; hence, being a quality, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

141 particle ‘ca’ has been translated here with ‘but.’

142 the commentary makes that case that ‘sound’ has its origin not in concrete tangible things; sound is a quality of the substance ‘vacuum.’

143 this sentence ‘the specific quality of having touch is produced through the qualities of the cause once the effect is produced, and not when “sound” is produced by “sound” 

we see any effect being produced’ will be referred again by Candrānanda in the introduction to the āhnika VSc 2.2.

144 ‘suchness’ \(tattva\) is that which exists temporally, and as such the sūtra equates it with ‘existence’; Heidegger once coined a specific ontological term, namely ‘the existential’ \(‘existenziell,’ the ‘what’ of a material ‘real’ is\), and refers to the entity that exists in temporality; it is worth asking whether this ‘suchness’ is equivalent with the 72 temporal dharmas as propounded by Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivāda \(Buddhism\) or the ‘specific quality of dharma’ which once extirpated, man acquires ‘liberation’; on existence in Aristotle, see Met 5.7; 7.1–2; De Int. 16b19–25, 21a18–33.

just as air is permanent and is a substance due to its atomic nature, lacking possession of essence-substantiality, in the same way, ‘vacuum’ is also a substance and permanent because of the absence of anything that causes it. 

***2.1.28. by existence \[vacuum’s\] essence \[is explained\]144***

just as such an existence \[is proved\] through the particularity of proper mark and through the absence of a specific mark, in the same way, because of the absence of the mark of sound and because of the absence of specific mark, ‘vacuum’145 is one. 

**// this is the end of the first lesson of the second chapter/ /**

**2.2. **

**/ the second lesson of the second chapter /**

it has been said \[in VSc 2.1.24\] that ‘a specific tangible quality is produced through the effects or qualities that originate from a cause, and that, each effect is produced like “word” is produced by “sound,”’ \[but\] that is not correct because a substance is not produced by another substance such as flower or a cloth is, however, the \[quality\] smell of flower originates in \[the case\] cloth, and such is the case of ‘heat’ in relation to ‘water’; \[hence\] it has been said –

***2.2.1. smell subsists in a contact between a flower and cloth, and does not manifest ***

***in another cloth \[because\] has no inferential marks of smell \[in that cloth\]146***

if you say that in the cloth connected with a flower no \[other\] smell is produced through the smell of \[a\] flower because we experience the smell of cloth also, 

\[then\] another smell different from both the flower-smell and cloth-smell would be produced, then this is not so, \[for\] we rather comprehend the smell of \[the\] 

flower alone, therefore \[to say that\] ‘smell is produced \[by another\] smell without the inception of an effect,’ this is wrong, because according to this argument, there would be another smell \[produced\]. 

145 ‘vacuum’ is only one and like ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space,’ its ontological nature is not mixed, divisible, or composed, yet it can subsist in different shapes and states, and only in such states can it be said that it is varied and diverse; this explains the doctrine of one in many, but the many cannot form one; one that has complete essential ontological unity has oneness as its nature. 

146 the specific smell of a flower on cloth proves that cloth has no smell, for smell belongs only to the flower, not to the cloth.

147 Qualities are accidental and perdurant by contrast to substances, which are durable. 

148 we do not comprehend the smell of the cloth – for cloth is made of earth – and because the smell of the flower is more powerful. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 101

***2.2.2. in this way, heat in ‘water’ is explained***

there is no specific ‘touch’ produced when ‘water’ is connected with ‘lustre,’ and regarding the absence of heat, the non-manifestation of touch which is variable is the proof that heat in water does not last as long as the parts of substance last;147 

because small particles of flower are transmitted in cloth and small particles of lustre are transmitted in ‘water,’ \[and\] because there are co-existent with something connected there, there is a comprehension of smell and touch; \[objection\] 

now, if you say that ‘colour’ and so forth do not exist other substances such as cloth and water, \[it follows\] then that the comprehension of smelling flowers and hot touch is at the same time with the recognition of smell of cloth and cold-touch, 

\[but\] this is not so, 

***2.2.3. ‘smell’ is invariably situated in ‘earth’ ***

although cloth’s own smell resides in the cloth which consists of earth, this is not comprehended because it is superseded by the smell of flower, 148 moreover, 

***2.2.4. heat \[is invariably situated\]149*** *** in ‘lustre’150***

heat is situated in lustre only, it does not pass over in ‘water,’ like when \[we\] 

apprehend heat. 

***2.2.5. coolness subsists in ‘water’***

because \[coolness\] has entered in the particles of ‘lustre,’ because of \[its\] co-existence with the joint thing, even though there is comprehension of heat, the coolness in water is not comprehended even if it is situated in the water dominated by heat; now \[he\] explains ‘time’ –

149 Presumably here is locative; Candrānanda prefers using saptamī vibhakti a lot. 

150 ‘lustre’ \(tejas\) as a substance is a broader concept, therefore, it should not be confused with ‘fire’ \(agni\).

151 for what is time at Aristotle, see Phys 4.10–14. 

152 latterness or subsequentness; the ability to form a chain or emerge randomly later in future. 

153 description of ‘time’ goes hand in hand with that of ‘space’; in fact, time here is not time, but rather ‘space-time,’ close perhaps to what is discussed in the ‘relativity theory’ \(Minkowski diagrams\) or what is being described are ‘pointers’ in the diagram of reality \(e.g. one’s life\), which represent a certain position in ‘space’ and ‘time’ called 

‘event.’

154 latterness is produced in the young man, who becomes old through time; the gloss gives a series of similes in order to explain the nature of ‘time,’ which otherwise is a highly abstract substance. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 103

***2.2.6. marks of ‘time’151*** *** are remoteness, simultaneousness, ***

***and non-simultaneousness, latterness,152*** *** and quickness ***

***in \[relation to\] another point of reference***

these are the marks of ‘time’ to be associated as distinct from each other; in that respect, \[time is\] regarding the following part of ‘space,’153 and in regard to the production of the cognition of a ‘next’ young \[individual\]; \[time is\] in relation to an old \[individual\] connected with an earlier situation whence the knowledge of latterness154 is produced; then, through the consideration of black hair and so forth, wrinkles, grey hair, and so forth, the knowledge of some young being is produced in relation \[and by comparison with\] the knowledge concerning an old being, that is time; similarly, regarding the activities of agents \[in the sentences\] ‘they are doing simultaneously, they are not doing simultaneously,’ out of these \[expressions\] one experiences and conceptualises time; likewise, for the sake of achieving the abundant \[karmic\] fruit of a ceremonial action such as 

‘cooked rice’ \[time\], it is known from a continuous progression of activities of the agent-priest who \[decides\] ‘today is done slowly,’ alternatively with ‘today is done quickly,’ and this is how the experience of time exists; the qualities of 

\[time\] are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’; 155 moreover, 

***2.2.7. substantiality \[and\] permanence \[of time\] ***

***are explained by \[the simile of\] ‘air’***

\[time\] is not like the atoms of wind due to its immateriality, \[on the contrary\] time 

has essence-substantiality and continuity.156

155 the qualities of time are the same as the generic qualities of the soul when it reaches the state of liberation; the infinity and diversity of time are the same as the infinity and diversity of soul; time is a parallel substance to soul; therefore, time cannot circum-scribe nor condition the fate of the soul. 

156 time is compared with the atoms of air, perhaps because it moves sequentially, and fragmentary in all directions, but is not exactly like the air, because it lacks constituent parts as air does.

157 ‘tattva’ may be translated as ‘essence’ and ‘tattvic’ may indicate an ‘essential’ or 

‘pure’ entity. 

158 ‘bhāva’ is an ‘existential’ \(a term derived from Heidegger’s temporal categories\) chiefly because the stem √ bhū has a dynamic implication that involves temporal change and activity; therefore, in tune with the broad philosophical terminology, I distinguish between ‘sattā’ \(universal permanent reality\) and ‘bhāva’ \(temporal existential thing\). 

159 if ‘time’ has ‘oneness’ then its holistic nature would contradict its division in parts; philosophically speaking, ‘oneness’ should not be confused with ‘unit.’

160 here again we are confronted with the dilemma of understanding what ‘one’ could mean; the objection’s understanding may be if ‘one’ is either ‘o’ or ‘1’; if it refers to 

‘o’ \(holistic oneness\), then it cannot have beginning, for oneness is a circle with no beginning; but if it is ‘1,’ it means that it has beginning in which case it is no longer eternal, for the unit is caused or produced by ‘o.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 105

***2.2.8. its essence157 is \[explained\] by existentiality158***

because of the absence of a particular positive mark, and because of the absence of a specific mark, the essence of time is one existential, \[but since\] time is one,159 

how do \[you then\] designate that ‘time’ has a beginning160 and so forth? to which 

\[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.9. \[its\] diversity is \[proved\] by the particularity of activities***

activity is the same as motion, because of the particularity of motion, after having seen the beginning, the endurance and the destruction of a thing, \[then\] there is the designation of the beginning of ‘time’ and so forth as regards the metaphorical plurality of ‘time,’ even though \[time\] is one; 161 \[objection\] no, \[because\] ‘time’ is 

only motion;162 how? because of the marks of ‘time.’

***2.2.10. \[diversity of time exists\] because there is existence \[of ***

***particularity\] in eternal \[substances\], 163*** *** and because of ***

***the absence \[of particularity\] in eternal \[substances\]***

\[objection\] if ‘time’ is different from motion then in this way the permanent time is \[proved\] from the marks of ‘time’ which may appear even in the permanent 

‘vacuum’ and so forth; \[the marks of time\] however, happen only in impermanent things; therefore those things which are changing have only periods of time;164 

therefore activity itself is time; \[response\] this is not so, because the marks of time occur in permanent things after a thing has occurred, and not because the activities are time; in connection with them \[Kaṇāda\] says –

161 with ādi ‘so forth’ \(at the end of a compound\), Candrānanda presumably indicates sthiti, and vināśa as well. 

162 the static aspect of ‘time’ as devoid of motion is denied by the opponent here. 

163 here we have the cornerstone of Vaiśeṣika philosophy that puts forward its hard metaphysics, namely the possibility of knowing abstract things in their diverse, pluralised, and particularised state, which is made by a theory of individuation \(antyaviśeṣa\), with an ultimate factor \(dharmaviśeṣa\) that proves an absolute ontological pluralism, which applies to both the minute state of matter, as well as the all-pervasive state of infinitely extendable substances such as ‘time,’ ‘space,’ ‘soul,’ and ‘vacuum.’

164 like the earlier distinction between ‘oneness’ and ‘unit,’ Vaiśeṣika argues that ‘time’ 

as an absolute substance is different from its divisions or units, which can be said to be small ‘periods’ or ‘entities.’

165 ‘space’ or ‘direction’ is a highly abstract substance, and likewise ‘time’ and ‘soul,’ 

its generic qualities – that is to say, the qualities that define its existence in the non-corporeal, absolute, and simple state – are ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction.’

166 the same observation as in the footnote on time \(sūtra 2.2.7\), space is here described similarly; space like time is sequentially and multi-dimensional, just as air is, for it which blows its winds in all directions, but always sequentially. 

167 ‘tattva’ might be translated as the ‘essence’ of a thing, though in Sāṃkhya it could mean the ‘essential thing’; note that in Vaiśeṣika there no such thing as a radical distinction within abstract substances; further comparative study is needed about the possible contribution of Indian ontology to the Latin scholastic debate between ‘essence’ and 

‘existence’ that has divided European philosophy since Aquinas; a comparative view on Aristotle’s thought of essence could be helpful \(Met 7.4–6, 10–11, 17\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 107

***2.2.11. \[these marks\] are called time in respect to the cause***

concerning the marks of time, when \[they\] lack a cause \[then\] \[the marks of time\] 

are impossible, then when an activity is caused \[the effect\] would be called ‘done’ 

and there will be no \[use of the word\] ‘simultaneous,’ therefore, whenever these 

\[marks\] are caused, there the term of time \[is used\]. 

***2.2.12. the marks \[of time\] are in regard to ‘that is ***

***from that,’ ‘this is obtained from this’***

mark of ‘space’ \[diś\] is the conceptualisation of a concrete demarcated substance 

\[in sentences\] such as ‘this is because of a previous one’; its qualities are ‘number,’ 

‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ and ‘disjunction’;165 furthermore –

***2.2.13. regarding its essence and permanence \[space\] ***

***is explained by \[the simile of\] ‘air’***

like the ‘air’ \[which\] is has not materiality, \[so also\] ‘space’ is \[like air\] has \[its own\] essence and permanence. 166

***2.2.14. its essence167*** *** \[is known\] by its existence168***

meaning of ‘space’ is this: it is one due to the presence of specific marks of ‘space,’ 

as well as because of the absence of the specific marks of ‘space.’

***2.2.15. even though ‘space’ is one, \[its\] diversity is ***

***\[proved by\] particular activities169***

speech usages of ‘east,’ ‘south,’ and so forth as applied to ‘space,’ \[show\] the diversity of ‘space’ because of the diversity of specific \[sacrificial\] activities in respect to the offerings to gods towards the east, and the variety of place for offerings towards east, south, in this way there exists the diversity of ‘space’ like east, south, and so forth, \[being\] metaphorically explained by specific activities; \[objection\] if you say that there will be mutual dependency \[between motion and space\], thus \[we say\]

168 ‘bhāva,’ as Halbfass pointed out, has rather dynamic connotations; by extrapolation, one may see in such dynamism the role of karma at play; whenever an absolute being falls from its absolute state, in the context of Indian philosophy, it can be said to be an existential state of decomposition and corruption; a long-time ago, Indian existentialism expressed itself in a predominantly substantialist driven manner \(Brahmanism\) or as mentalist \(Buddhism\). 

169 ‘particular’ is the proof that ‘diversity’ does not refer to the ontological status of the substance as one; here diversity must refer to the states that one substance can undergo; the state makes a stable entity diverse and plural, not rather its static oneness.

is 2-fold: external173 and internal; 174 the external \[doubt\] is 2-fold: perceptive and non-perceptive; regarding the imperceptible \[one\], first \[he\] says, like that –

when for instance there is an indication of a man, there is the question as to what this gaze could be, \[and\] doubt \[is when man’s arrival\] is not seen, but only 

\[inferred\] from hearing; but as regards \[the perceptible doubt\] \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.21. \[arises when\] a ‘seen thing’ resembles a ‘visible thing’175***

***visible, and both ways \[likely and unlikely\] visible***

at first, there is the gaze of Devadatta with the lock of hair, gradually the gaze of 

\[him\] with a shaved head, and in the third instance the gaze of the lock of hair sitting in its place \[head\]; in the fourth \[stage of visibility\], Devadatta is known by conversation and so forth, and doubt is in relation with \[the\] unspecified moment at the time of twilight \[when such questions arise\] ‘what could that be, a lock of hair, or a shaved head?’; in a previous sūtra, doubt was \[defined\] by recollecting 

\[too\] many objects, here however, doubt is because of a specific recollection of 

one and the same object;176 but, regarding the internal doubt \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.23. doubt is because of the \[dilemma between\] ***

‘vidyā’ is perfect knowledge, ‘avidyā’ is deceiving knowledge; 177 when an astrol-

oger is asked for an auspicious \[thing\], \[the first time\] the thing is true, the second time \[it\] is non-true, \[but\] on the third time there is a doubt as to whether the real thing is true as in the first time, \[or\] true like in the second time; hence, that is how doubt is being described; in relation to that, ‘sound’ might be explained as such –

‘sound’ is that whose subject-matter is perceived by ear; because ‘word’ has not been conventionalised in connection with universality and so forth, so that śabdatva should not be \[understood to be the same as\] śabda; \[this is why\] the word ‘artha’ \[object\] has been taken \[for śabda\]. 

situation in which this very prediction does not come true; and \(3\) a situation where there is a doubt about whether there is truth or not in the first and second situation enumerated \(see trans. Nozawa, 1993, p. 109\). 

178 ‘artha’ may be translated as both ‘subject-matter’ \(object-matter, or object-matter\) as well as ‘meaning.’

179 sūtra refers to different kinds of specificities, one that is presumably ‘different in different objects’ and one that is ‘common in many objects,’ namely sāmānyaviśeṣa; the first one may be said to be the ultimate particularity, whereas the second is the ‘universal particularity’ \(a lower universal, such as genus and species, which is helpful to determine the ‘class’ of an object\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 113

***2.2.25. doubt is when \[sound\] subsists in substance, quality, motion***

\[objection\] doubt in regard to ‘sound’ is due to its generic base, such as substantiality, qualitiness, and so forth \[motionness\]; on this, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***2.2.26. and \[doubt is\] when the particularity \[of sound\] is seen ***

***in both \[ways\], in the same \[homogenous\] species, ***

***and in different \[heterogeneous\] objects179***

the visibility of the particularity in ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ and so forth is because earthiness is homogenous as well as heterogeneous, of which quality and motion \[are such examples\]; therefore, doubt concerning ‘sound’ \[raises the question\] as to what is that particularity perceived by \[the\] ear in comparison with the qualities between different mutual subject-matters of things; this is not so, 

***2.2.27. because it is possessed by one substance, ***

***\[sound\] is not a substance***

because \[sound\] exists only in one substance \[such as\] ‘vacuum,’ this ‘sound’ is not a substance like, for instance, the substance pot and so forth; atoms and so forth are not a substance, and there cannot be many substances like pot and so forth. 

***2.2.28. because it is not visually perceptible, \[sound\] is not a motion180***

when substance or motion is perceptible by different organs, then that which belongs to the sight is visible too, but ‘sound,’ although it is perceived by \[the\] 

ear, is that which does not belong to the sight; in this manner the quality \[sound\] 

is firmly ascertained; however, 

***2.2.29. even though it is a quality, \[sound\] is similar to ***

***motions because it has a terminus point181***

even though \[sound\] is a quality, it is similar with motions \[in that it has\] termination, \[while\] destruction is inferred because is not known after production; \[objection\] if you say that even though \[sound\] exists \[but\] not comprehended because of some cause, \[then\] no, 

180 ‘sound’ is again proved as a quality not a substance or motion. 

181 ‘śabda’ might be subject to destruction and creation, because, like any other entity subjacent to motion, it becomes prone to change.

182 it may be yet another reference to the theory of asatkāryavāda. 

183 it refers to the previous absence or non-existence of the effect; once again, the Vaiśeṣikas ascertain their asatkāryavāda doctrine. 

184 the ablative has been translated here with an adjective. 

185 Today, darbha, a herb used since Vedic times, can be seen being used by the Brahmin priests at various ceremonies; it is known by the name of kuśa \(desmostachya bipin-nata\) and is alongside Soma, a very important element in the Vedic sacrifice. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 115

***2.2.30. because it has not real marks \[sound is invisible\]***

that which is not comprehended although it exists due to some cause, its mark makes us comprehend its existence, \[and\] in the case of sound, however, after the articulation due to an absence of any mark connected, there is only the absence 

\[of sound, ascertained\]. 

***2.2.31. \[sound\] is dissimilar from continuity \[hence is impermanent\]***

it is therefore impermanent by virtue of its dissimilarity to permanent \[entities\], and because of having been previously uttered \[produced\]

***2.2.32. \[sound exists\] because it is produced182***

and ‘sound’ is an effect, its production is due to ‘conjunction’ and so forth, therefore it is impermanent; furthermore, 

***2.2.33. \[sound exists\] because of \[its inevitable\] absence183***

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that is \[sound\] has a previous non-existence; that which has prior non-existence is destructible; 184 and because sound is produced by causes, it has a prior non-existence, the causes are not indicative \[of prior-existence\], why? 

***2.2.34. because \[it is subject to\] changes from \[its\] cause***

change of ‘sound’ is intelligible by \[the simile\] of a cause such as a drum, and so forth, \[whereby sound is\] big in a big drum, and small in a small one; but regarding \[its\] both manifestations, 

***2.2.35. because \[is subject to\] defect***

if \[sound\] is manifested permanently, then the sound used by one person in a sacrifice will not be used by another person, in the same way as sacrificial grass like ‘darbha’185\[is not used\] due to its defect of staleness, 186 therefore, sound is 

impermanent;187 why it is an effect-product? \[to which\] \[Kaṇāda\] says –

186 grass cannot be used by another person because that will not give a proper result, it will be stale; here dharmaviśeṣa shows that it arises in a uniquely individual way. 

187 ‘sound’ functions differently from grass because of being impermanent; a man can use the same ‘sound’ that has been used by another person, so sound is newly produced.

188 Jambūvijayaji the editor, did not trace this quotation here. The quote may indicate that 

‘sound’ is a channel through which the Vedas have been revealed; since meaning and language is conventional, so also ‘sound’ is. 

189 Possibly the objection is raised by the Mīmāṃsākas, who hold that language and meaning are eternal \(according to the Bhāṭṭās, the ‘particular is understood secondarily, or metaphorically, that is, via lakṣaṇā vṛtti; according to Prābhākaras, the particular is known at the same time as the universal. There is a logical concomitance between the two \(vyāpti\); personal communication: Marco Ferrante\). 

190 the natural conclusion would be that if a thing is simultaneous \(it occurs in 2 places at the same time\) it will then be eternal, for neither time nor space can contain it; in the case of ‘sound’ however, it is impermanent because it cannot occur in 2 places \(at the same time\), so it cannot be both ‘1’ and ‘many’ as eternal entities usually are \(time, space, soul\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 117

***2.2.36. ‘sound’ is brought forth by ‘conjunction’ ***

***and ‘disjunction’ and ‘sound’***

because of a ‘conjunction’ between drum and stick, because of the separation of parts of cloth, and because of the production of sound out of \[another\] sound, just as there is a continuity of waves, we think that sound is an effect. 

***2.2.37. \[sound\] has no continuity, as its marks \[show\]***

‘from these, Vedas are descended’ \[…\]188 because of this \[Vedic sentence\] which is a Vedic mark, sound is impermanent; \[objection\] no, ‘sound’ is permanent. 189

***2.2.38. but \[if sound were permanent-continuous\] ***

***it will not occur twice190***

\[Mīmāṃsākas’ view\]191 the product-beings have 2 forms of activity: one is generative of effects, the other has the nature of division-distribution; however, ‘sound’ 

has only one function, \[namely\] that to ascertain meaning, which is pronuncia-tion, \[but\] ‘sound’ is not produced for the sake of itself, 192 therefore ‘sound’ is 

permanent. 

***2.2.39. \[sound is continuous\] because of the absence of ‘number’193***

the ‘sound’ is produced and is destroyed, ‘this word is mentioned twice’ \[but\] here because it has been destroyed, there is no repetition in number, but repetition of 

‘sound’ does exist, therefore ‘sound’ is permanent. 194

191 Sūtrapāṭha rehearses the tenets, which belong to other orthodox and unorthodox schools for refutation without always specifying their name; we take it to be the Mīmāṃsākas’ view, which is expressed here and in the next sūtra, until end of VSc 2.2.42 where the Vaiśeṣika’s voice comes in again. 

192 according to Mīmāṃsā sound is the vehicle that conveys the eternal meaning. 

193 ‘number’ is a quality of eternal substances \(e.g. time, space, souls\); number is considered only from 2 onwards, thus, if it is said that number has no number, that means that ‘sound’ is impermanent for it occurs only once, after which it vanishes. 

194 another feature of the impermanent nature of an entity is that it cannot be divided into parts; it is the reason why Vaiśeṣika insists that abstract substances such as ‘time,’ 

‘space,’ ‘vacuum,’ and ‘soul’ are ‘one’ even though we can see a certain diversity in them, this diversity should be seen only in metaphorical, not ontological terms.

195 ‘gaṇana’ from the 10th class root √ gaṇ ‘to calculate.’

196 ‘but it does exist’ refers to the fact that although ‘sound’ terminates after an utterance, it re-occurs each time it is uttered. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 119

***2.2.40. \[sound is continuous\] because of the word ***

***‘prathama’ \[in the beginning\]***

because of the word ‘prathama’ \[first\], there is a sentence ‘he recites the first verse thrice,’ \[which indicates\] that the word first, and so forth \[…\] after the termination of the utterance of the word there will be no calculation195\[of the repetition\] of the 

first verse, but there is calculation,196 therefore \[sound\] is permanent

***2.2.41. and \[sound is continuous\] because of the existence of recognition***

if there were destruction of sound \[then\] the type of recognition \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘this is the same sound “go” \[cow\]’ would no longer be possible, therefore ‘sound’ is permanent; 197 \[Vaiśeṣika:\] this \[view\] is not correct, 

***2.2.42. given the \[sound’s\] manifoldness \[your arguments\] are ambiguous***

in a lamp and so forth, an activity198 is seen twice, the lightning came out twice, here there is absence of number, recognition is found in flames and so forth, therefore because many of these causes exist in impermanent things too, therefore, these reasons are ambiguous, therefore ‘sound’ is impermanent. 

***2.2.43. the ‘number’ \[of sound\] occurs generically***

200 for Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika, a ‘hetu’ \(liṅga\) is discussed in relation to an ‘pakṣa’ 

\(‘uncertain thing,’ e.g. ātman\) and a probandum \(sādhya\). In the Vaiśeṣika context, Candrānanda deliberates between a probandum \(śabda\) and an ‘uncertain thing’ to be proved \(where the pakṣa is ātman\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 121

***3.1.2. because the objects of senses have been established to ***

***be different from senses, this is the proof200*** *** that there ***

***is something different \[from the sense-object\]201***

‘soul’ \[which is\] beyond the graspable and the grasping \[activity\], sense-powers, and sense-object are inferred from the relation between the grasper and the grasped, which establishes \[the existence\] of a subject matter and of something other than the senses, for instance the existence of \[the\] ear is the basis established from the grasping of the meanings and of the words. 

***3.1.3. but this \[proof\]202 is invalid***

\[objection\] having stated the argument according to which \[soul\] is the existential grasper based on the proposition concerning the relation between grasper and the act-of-grasping, the reason stated is invalid and is lacking any ground; why do you imagine ‘soul’ as real? how do the senses not become the graspers \[of objects\]? 

this cannot be so, 

***3.1.4. because the causes \[you mentioned: sense-***

***objects\] do not have cognisance***

\[response\] because elements are ignorant \[lack consciousness\] concerning the causes of sense organs, the sense organs which are effect-products lack therefore, consciousness; concerning the lack of consciousness of things \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***3.1.5. \[as well as\] because effects do not have cognisance***

due to the other effects of things such as pot and so forth, the elements lack consciousness too

***3.1.6. \[as well as\] because cognisance \[is impermanent\]***

this present sūtra is given in order to conclude that, because elements lack consciousness, the sense organs are also ignorant. 

201 this is what we may call the ‘otherness argument’ \(arthāntara hetuḥ\) for the existence of the ‘soul.’ Other types of argument are designated in the following glosses. 

202 ‘that’ \(tat\) refers to the argument expressed under 3.1.2.

204 these may also be called relational ‘probans,’ or ‘probandums,’ as they are identified in Vaiśeṣika logics; one needs to distinguish between marks and probans; for instance, in the case of smoke and fire, smoke is the mark \(liṅga\), fire is the proban \(hetu\); Nyāya has a slightly different terminology hetu, liṅga \(marks\), on the one hand, and sādhya \(probans\), on the other. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 123

***3.1.7. the argument \[on difference, stated in sūtra 3.1.2\] is invalid203***

\[objection\] that there is another cause means that it is different from the definition of cause, thus, because the well-established object of sense-organs cannot cause \[us\] to infer \[the existence of soul\], because they have the property of being objects of sense-organs and are not connected with ‘soul,’ therefore it \[such argument\] is invalid; this is not so, 

***3.1.8. \[valid arguments are\]204 connected, inherent, inherent-w*** ***ith-one-***

***and-the-same-object, and conflicting; \[for example\] one ‘effect’ ***

***causes ‘another effect,’ ‘one cause’ produces ‘another cause,’; ***

***conflicting \[arguments are\] one ‘past thing’ is \[the mark\] of an ***

***‘inexistent thing’, the ‘inexistent thing’ is \[the mark\] of that ***

***which‘never existed,’ ‘a past thing’ is \[the mark\] of that which is ***

***‘a past thing’,\[and\] the ‘past thing’ is \[the mark\] of a ‘past thing’***

smoke is connected with fire, 205 horn is inherent in cow; one which is inherent-with-one-and-the-same-object is 2-fold: effect of another effect, such as ‘form’ is the \[cause\] of touch, one cause leads to another cause such as hand is the cause of foot; conflicting argument is 4-fold: the rain that has happened is a mark of an air-cloud connection, rain that has happened is a mark of the connection between wind and cloud which has not happened; the blackness which has not happened is a mark of a connection with fire which has not happened, the effect that has happened is a mark of the connection with the cause that has happened, therefore, here the cause and motion \[connection\] are established by objects of senses inherent \[in each other\] and are the mark of the ‘soul’; if you say that they are not inherent in the ‘soul,’ this is thus, for \[while\] the usage is different, the sense organs are to be used by the doer, because they are the causes just as mouth and so forth is; \[concerning\] how conjunction and so forth are the mark, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***3.1.9. \[these\] arguments are established on the \[principle of\] precedence***

that which is established like ‘conjunction’ and so forth is not separated from that which is known, that \[connected thing\] becomes a mark of some other thing too, because \[it\] is connected \[with another thing\] and therefore \[it\] is not disjoined; that is to say –

205 causative reason is called ‘saṃyogi’ when the object and senses are connected, but if these are not connected with the ‘soul,’ inference or valid argument cannot occur, for 

‘soul’ is the substratum of perception.

***3.1.12. \[for example, the argument according to which, because ***

***a thing\] has horns therefore it \[must be\] a horse; because ***

***\[a thing\] has horns therefore \[it must be\] a bull209***

‘this thing is a horse’ when such a ‘thing is to be proved,’210 to possess horns is a conflicting \[fact\] due to a concomitance211 between ‘possessing horns’ and a ‘different thing’ other than horse; when \[the pakṣa\] ‘this thing is a bull’ is to be proved \[then\] ‘possessing horns’ belongs to ‘more than one thing’212 due to a concomitance between one thing to be proved with its opposing \[thing\]; the word 

‘ca’ means an accumulation of non-mentioned \[things\]; 213 when ‘hair has horns’ 

is to be proved, then ‘possessing horns’ is something not established in the thing to be proved because it is not present in the object, thus \[it\] has been said in the previous argument; furthermore, 

difference between a ‘pakṣa’ which is an inferential statement previously stated \(e.g. 

the existence of a mountain or the statement ‘this is a horse’\), a doubtful ‘probandum’ \(fire, horse, bull\), and the visible ‘mark’ \(e.g. smoke, horns\). In this gloss, for instance, the objects to be proved \(sādhya\) are ‘horse’ and ‘bull,’ respectively, in relation to the reality of universals \(horseness, bullness\). 

211 in Vaiśeṣika and Nyaya, ‘concomitance’ is ‘vyāpti,’ which is the necessary linking knot between ‘reality’ and ‘appearance.’

212 ‘more than one thing’ refers to a class, genera, or species, which is usually characterised by a common feature \(horns\). 

213 when there is an ‘accumulation,’ the reality of things in logic is proved as implied in the proposition through ‘concomitance’ \(vyāpti\); in ontology, that reality is implied through ‘inherence’ of things, which means that ‘immanent reality’ \(hidden\) is as valid as ‘visible reality’ \(as shown by the visible marks, liṅga\).

214 sūtra draws a distinction between ‘knowledge by perception’ and ‘knowledge by inference’; it is in fact the difference between ontology and logics; now the commentator passes on to a different demonstration, not by inference \(logics as VSc 3.1.22\) but rather through the theory of perception, the so-called ‘4-fold contact’ produced between ‘mind,’ ‘senses,’ ‘objects,’ and ‘soul.’

215 ‘cognition,’ of which we know from the list of qualities VS 1.1.5, is called ‘buddhi’ 

and is defined here by the synonym ‘jñāna’; it is a ‘product’ \(kārya\), and as such its nature is – from a soteriological point of view – transitory. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 127

***3.1.13. as for the other \[kind of argument\] that is produced because ***

***of a contact between ‘mind,’ objects, senses, and ‘soul’214***

that which is produced from the 4-fold contact, which is called the activity of 

‘cognition’ \[jñāna\]215 that is something different from \[inference\], and it is another logical proof for producing the knowledge concerning ‘soul’; cognition depends on an inherent cause because it is an effect just as a pot is. 

***3.1.14. propensity and antipathy noticed in individual ***

***selves are the inferential marks of the \[existence\] ***

***of another \[cogniser, the soul\]***

‘pratyagātma’ refers to the body \[of the soul\];216 propensity and antipathy are seen in the body, \[and these\] cause us to infer ‘soul’; \[in the following inferential manner\]: the body is inhabited217 by something which has ‘effort’ because it is the cause for propensity and antipathy towards \[either\] beneficial and non-beneficial 

\[things\],218 just as a pot \[is\].219

**// the first lesson of the third chapter //**

**3.2. **

**/ the second lesson of the third chapter /**

it has been stated \[earlier\] that the cause of knowledge is \[explained\] by the \[4-fold perceptual\] contact between ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ senses, and object; in order to prove this probandum he explains ‘mind.’

216 ātman has been often used in the commentary to indicate either the ‘disembodied self’ 

\(‘soul’\) or the ‘embodied self’; here the explanation of Candrānanda is useful, but very often the lack of such an explanation confuses the reader particularly when he/

she analyses the nature of the ‘soul,’ the theory of karma and rebirth, or the soteriology of the system. 

217 ‘inhabited’ or ‘dependent’ \(adhiṣṭhita\). 

218 presumably, ‘beneficial’ and ‘non-beneficial’ refer to ‘auspiciousness’ or ‘non-auspiciousness’ of a pot that is broken by mistake or to be preserved for a long time. 

219 pot also exists because it depends on the will of men to make and use it for beneficial and non-beneficial purposes.

220 here ‘mind’ \(manas\) is omitted from enumeration, but evidently, as Candrānanda says, it is an implicit indicator for the function and motion of mind. 

221 ‘cognition’ is produced ‘with’ mind, and not ‘by mind,’ so it is because mind is only a component of the perceptual process; mind should not be seen as the ‘producer’ of knowledge – as is the case in Western philosophy; in Vaiśeṣika, mind is atomic, and as such it has only a mediating role to play, not a principal one. 

222 mind is explained by the simile of wind; see also similar passages for wind as an explanatory tool \(vāyunā vyākhyāte\), for ‘vacuum,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space’ in VSc 2.2.23; 3.2.2; 3.2.5; 5.2.12. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 129

***3.2.1. characteristic mark of ‘mind’ is the \[fluctuating\] presence ***

***and absence of the knowledge \[produced\] when there ***

***is a contact between ‘soul,’ senses, and object220***

when there is a contact between ‘soul,’ senses, and object, \[then\] there is a ‘cognition’ being produced with mind, 221 and it is \[sometimes\] present \[other times\] 

absent; thus, the production and non-production of ‘cognition’ is the mark for the existence of ‘mind’; \[its\] qualities \[are\] ‘number,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ \[and\] ‘latent impetus.’

***3.2.2. substantiality and permanence \[of mind\] are ***

***explained by \[the simile of\] ‘air’222***

substantiality and permanence of the atoms of ‘air’ are because they lack \[another\] 

essence, 223 \[and atomic\] ‘mind’ is likewise.224

***3.2.3. ‘mind’ is one because of a non-simultaneous ‘effort,’ as ***

***well as because of a non-simultaneous ‘cognition’***

because of the non-simultaneousness of ‘effort’ and ‘cognition,’ ‘mind’ is one in each body, it is concrete and devoid of ‘touch,’ holistic \[having no parts\], atomic, permanent, and fast-moving, but because ‘cognition’ is simultaneous with ‘effort’ 

there is production of cognitions as far as the many activities are produced and known. 

223 ‘not having substantiality’ meaning that they can exist fragmented, not necessarily aggregated in a large mass of a universal \(e.g. substantiality – air-ness, water-ness\); the accumulation of atoms, say in water, can form one large substance, for instance, a 

‘large reservoir of water’ \(see Praśastapāda’s Bhāṣya 57–9\). 

224 atoms are eternal too, even though they have no substance, because they are integrated into a substance; the comparison of mind with atoms is due to Vaiśeṣika’s peculiar view on the ‘atomic size’ of mind.

225 for an analogy between Indian and Greek thought on pleasure, see Aristotle EN 7.11–

14; 10.1–5. 

226 jīvana as a biological being, a ‘living entity’ and is formed not by matter as body \(śarīra\) is, but by something intermediate, equivalent to a ‘subtle body.’

227 ‘activated’ and ‘effected’ are the synonyms, as kārya designates both a product and an activity; all products might be active as opposed to abstract substances that are not products for they do not have intrinsic activity; it is important to remember that the definition of substance in Vaiśeṣika does not include a ‘principle of movement’ as Aristotle defined the nature of a substance in Physics 192b20. 

228 body is resembled here with a house that is subject to deterioration. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 131

***3.2.4. characteristic marks of the ‘soul’ are ‘inhaling,’ ‘exhaling,’ ***

***‘closing-eye,’ ‘opening-eye,’ ‘biological life,’ ‘mind-***

***movement,’ ‘alterations in different sense-organs,’ ***

***‘pleasure,’225 ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ and ‘aversion.’***

‘inhaling,’ ‘exhaling,’ ‘closing-eye,’ and ‘opening-eye,’ and the movement of 

‘mind’ are the marks of the ‘soul’ because they are produced by ‘effort,’ similarly the biological being226 is being produced227 by the ‘unseen force,’ the different alterations in the senses arise from recollection, for instance of qualities ‘pleasure’ 

and so forth; the oblique ‘air’ situated in the body is that which sustains the activity of ‘inhaling’ and ‘exhaling’ as a result of ‘effort,’ as it is in the case of a bagpipe filled in with \[the\] motion of air which is subject to changes of air that fills in the 

\[whole\] body; the activities of ‘closing-eye,’ ‘opening-eye’ are done by ‘effort,’ 

because the act of opening and closing of eyes is expressed by the word-kriyā, just as opening and closing of eyes of the ‘wooden puppet moved by strings’ is; the connection of ‘soul’ with mind based on unseen-force is life; the activity such as the growth of body and so forth is also called biological entity because it is subject for growth, wound, fracture, and sprouting, as for example a decrepit house;228 

the act of going of mind towards another sense organ – that is, the movement of mind – is to be done with effort because it is caused by the connection with the intended region like the action of testicle229 \[which activity\] is done with the effort of the child; observation of the ‘form,’ ‘latent impression,’ memory of enjoyment, 

‘effort,’ activity of ‘mind,’ connection of mind with enjoyment, modification of enjoyment, each of these preceding ones, \[each such observation\] is produced from an earlier cause, the knowledge however, is \[produced\] in a reverse order, after having remembered each preceding one, out of the subsequent one, \[thus\] 

‘soul’ is inferred \[as a result\]; there is no memory of another sense-organ having seen another object; there is no part of the body that can remember because \[it\] 

is different according to different stages of life; Devadatta’s conceptualisation of 

‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ has one or more incidental causes, 

\[and\] they are connected with the experience \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘by me,’ just as many people who have done a convention have a different simultaneous experience with the movement of \[the\] eyebrow of a dancer’230 \[Nyāyavārttika 1.1.10\] this is Uddyotakara’s \[statement\]; ‘pleasure’ and so forth are dependent on an owner of qualities because they are qualities like \[for instance\] ‘form-colour.’

229 ‘pelaka’ \(pela n. testicle\) means ‘the doer of testicle’ and refers to the play of a child that can be taken either as a ball to play with in a game, or as an erotic self-gratification act that a brahmacarya stage of life forbids; in either way, the discussion between enjoyment and effort is emphasised here, and effort \(either conscious or unconscious\) plays a role in the normal function of the embodied soul and it is the inferential marks that prove the existence of an inner agent, or doer \(pelaka\). 

230 the simile ‘eyebrow of a dancer’ is telling indeed, not only to students of Indian drama \(who may recognise the mudrā and other facial expression rules typical to the Kathak dance\) but also to students of Indian philosophy, particularly Sāṃkhya, where the dancer and the spectator are the canonical simile to express the difference between prakṛti and puruṣa.

just as when there is contact between \[the\] eye and the object there is no direct perception that Yajñadatta exists, so also with ‘soul’ when it is connected to breathing and so forth, with ‘pleasure’ and so forth, such knowledge is not produced \[either\]; then, how can breathing and so forth, the connection of which is not seen, be a visible mark of ‘soul’? to this \[he\] says: breathing and so forth, are not a visible mark. 

***3.2.7. \[it is not a valid inferential mark\] because what is seen ***

***is the generality, not the specificity \[of Yajñadatta\]232***

breathing and so forth which have no cause, and ‘pleasure’ and so forth, which have no substratum cannot be produced, therefore there must be some cause and substratum, because of this, that which is seen only generically, there is no 

\[knowledge\] of the particularity of spatiality and so forth, which are not denied, because they also can be causes; 

***3.2.8. therefore \[the proof of Yajñadatta’s soul is only\] from tradition***

‘soul exists’ this subject-matter \[argument\] is only a hearsay; \[response\] this is not so, 

***3.2.9. ‘ahaṃ’ is not from tradition \[for it\] is ontologically differentiated***

because the word-‘ahaṃ’ – which refers to the substance ‘soul’ as something different from ‘earth’ and many objects, substances – is used in apposition with a self \[expressed in the sentences\] ‘I breathe,’ ‘I am happy,’ therefore, due to marks such as ‘breath’ and so forth, \[soul’s reality\] is not something known traditionally; 

\[response\] and now, 

232 when one sees only the generality, the mind fails to see particularity; for a discussion about the difference between the ‘perception of the universal’ and the ‘perception of the particularity,’ see VSc 1.2.3–5.

233 It can be translated as direct perception, not mediated; the perception of ṛṣis. 

234 in the following gloss \(VSc 3.2.10\), Candrānanda describes a further and opposing argument that seems to ascribe the function of breath and pleasure to the body, not the 

‘soul’ \(VSc 3.2.10\). 

235 ‘metaphorical expression’ \(upacāra\), to be taken indirectly, because ‘soul’ cannot move, but only the body. 

236 Candrānanda agrees with that, to a certain extent, namely that it is the body of Devadatta that moves not the ‘soul’ \(second line of VSc 3.2.11\), since as stated in VSc 7.1.28–9, ‘soul,’ likewise ‘vacuum’ is all-pervasive in dimension \(vibhū\); it seems that the commentator argues for a paradoxical kind of argument, called ‘doubtful’ 

\(sandigdha\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 135

***3.2.10. \[it is ontologically differentiated\] because whenever ***

***there is direct perception of ‘I’233 \[in separate instances\] ***

***such as ‘I am Devadatta, I am Yajñadatta’***

if indeed, the absolute ‘I’ \[exists in sentences such as\] ‘I am Devadatta, I am Yajñadatta’ \[that indicates\] their ‘soul’234 because such ‘soul’ is directly perceived, then such a manner of speaking should be linked with the word-‘ahaṃ’ 

which indicates the ‘soul’ \[ātman\]; the word-‘ahaṃ’ indicates the body also, because it has the same substratum expressed by the word-Devadatta which indicates \[his\] body, therefore, breathing, ‘pleasure’ and so forth are not a decisive reasonable argument; how is it that the word-Devadatta indicates \[his\] body? to this, \[Kaṇāda\] says:

***3.2.11. \[soul is ontologically differentiated\] in the metaphorical ***

***expressions235 ‘Devadatta goes’ and ‘Viṣṇumitra goes,’ ***

***which indicate the perception of the embodied self236***

‘gacchati’ is the expression for motion-going, therefore the word Devadatta is applied for the sake of expressing the body because of the impossibility of motion in the case of ‘soul’; therefore, the word-’ahaṃ’ is also used in connection with body only, because it is seen along with the word Devadatta; \[objection\] this is not so, 

***3.2.12. \[no\] the upacāra argument \[as a proof of soul\] is doubtful237***

because ‘ahaṃ’ can be used in apposition238 to the word ‘Devadatta,’ the usage of the word-‘ahaṃ’ in connection with body is doubtful; does ‘ahaṃ’ refer to 

‘ātman’ used \[figuratively concerning body\] because the body is auxiliary to the 

‘soul’? or does it refer chiefly to the body? because \[of such doubt\] there is no clear determination as to whether ‘ahaṃ’ refers to ‘soul’ or ‘body’; regarding his own subject-matter \[for expressing\] a firm conviction, \[Kaṇāda\] says –

237 to distinguish this argument from others, this is what I define as the ‘otherness argument’ \(VSc 3.2.13\); what follows is a series of the 3 main counterarguments with which Candrānanda responds to those presented by the opponents so far; these are: \(1\) ‘sandigdha argument’ \(VSc 3.2.12\); \(2\) ‘otherness argument’ \(VSc 3.2.13\); and \(3\) ‘self-consciousness argument’ \(VSc 3.2.14\). 

238 ‘apposition’ is a grammatical construction in which 2 elements, normally noun phrases, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the 2 elements are said to be in apposition.

specific bodies of both Yajñadatta and Viṣṇumitra are related to a knowledge produced concerning \[a particular\] pleasure, pain, which is not \[the same as\] ours, and at the same time, \[their\] word-‘ahaṃ’ would be conventionally connected with our ahaṃkara; but regarding the expression ‘śarīra’ after seeing the body in relation to the usage of the word Devadatta, then similarly that will be used for 

‘him’; but this is not so; therefore, it does not refer to the body; but ‘ātman’ occurs 

\[only once\] since it is not used by others; thus, ‘pleasure’ and so forth which are the subject matter of ‘soul,’ and breathing and so forth which are the instruments 

\[of one soul\] these have the same substratum with the word-‘ahaṃ’; now, 

***3.2.15. \[no, there is no particularised intuition of soul\] , because ***

***soul is only one \[in number and nature\] due to the indistinct ***

***production of ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ and ‘cognition’ \[in all souls\]***

for example, because of the indistinct positive mark and absence of \[a\] specific mark, it is proved that there is only one existential, in the same manner due to the undifferentiated production of ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ and ‘cognition,’ as well as the absence of a specific mark, oneness of ‘soul’ is proved; 240 but this is not so, 

***3.2.16. \[quite the contrary\] the plurality \[of soul\] exists ***

***because of the singularities \[of its states\]***

because of one person’s connection with ‘pleasure’ and so forth, there is \[an\] 

absence of these \[pleasures and so forth\] in connection with another person, due to this \[diverse\] arrangement, ‘souls’ are plural. 

240 the gloss elucidates the flimsy character of the specific qualities \(pleasure, pain\) that come and go, and which are alternatively present and absent in each single ātman; this shows that oneness of soul should be understood in terms of units, and plurality, as the next sūtra 3.2.16 clarifies.

241 the plurality of soul is proved from the unique varieties of ‘desires’ and ‘volitions’ 

that each soul has independently of others; souls are plural not only in their existential embodied condition, but in their pre-qualitness state as well, for soul has as a generic quality that never ceases to characterise it, ‘separateness’ \(pṛthaktva\). 

242 what differentiates the ‘specific qualities’ of the soul from its ‘generic qualities’ is that the latter are those that define best the nature of the pure soul in its pre-embodied, intransitive, fixed state, the state of its liberation, where souls are differentiated not by happiness, sorrow, and so forth, but by calm and simplicity of an infinite number of different souls that through conjunction and disjunction are interrelated, forming as it were, a ‘one substance’ soul.

‘one who desires \[heavenly\] village should perform a sacrifice’ \[…\], ‘one who desires heaven should perform a sacrifice’ \[…\], these are from śāstras’ authority 

\[and show that\] ‘souls’ are many;241 the \[specific\] qualities of it \[soul\] are ‘cognition,’ ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ ‘volition,’ ‘aversion,’ ‘effort,’ ‘unseen force’ \[dharma and adharma\], \[and\] ‘latent impetus’; but the other qualities \[of soul\] are ‘num-

ber,’ ‘dimension,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ \[and\] ‘disjunction.’242

even though atoms and so forth, are not comprehended by sense-organs, nevertheless, the body, the great elements and so forth, these products245 are their marks, because

243 the permanent thing has no cause, which is to say, is uncaused, but as the following sūtra 4.1.2. mentions, it does have effect, it produces effects. 

244 Here is the externalist view of Vaiśeṣika’s ontology, regardless of whether these substances are perdurers \(atoms of the mahābhūtas\) or eternal and wholistic \(vacuum, space, time, soul, and mind\). 

245 bodies \(śarīra\) and the elements \(mahābhūta\) \(all of which are composed of atoms\) are products only figuratively, these are the proof for the aggregation of atoms; creation and destruction are in fact in Vaiśeṣika, the composition and decomposition of the infinite and unique particularities that at one stage formed a whole.

246 effect is the ‘mark’ of the cause. 

247 ‘specificity’ or ‘particularity’ is an eternal quality of the substances; it is eternal by its inherence in the substance, such as pṛthaktva demonstrates the pre-existential plurality of one substance, say, ātman. 

248 if substance has particularity as its intimate nature, then it would be absurd to deny the permanent nature of particularity too; particularity does not seem to be extrinsic to substance but is rather part of the substance. 

249 in Vaiśeṣika, cognitive comprehension is possible even in the case of essence-substantiality; this view agrees with Aristotle but disagrees with John Locke; see Copi 1970: 292–300. 

250 here rūpa is translated as ‘appearance.’

251 atoms do not have substances, but substances have atoms; atoms are minute and separated entities, and since they are defined by ‘antyaviśeṣa’ they cannot repeat like 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 141

***4.1.3. existence of the effect is indeed due to the existence of the cause***

from causes such as thread, and so forth, \[there is\] the production of an effect, say cloth and so forth, which is because the effect is being preceded by cause, \[which we understand\] from the inferential marks of the product of the cause. 246

***4.1.4. impermanence is the negation of the particular existentials247***

when it is said indeed that ‘all effect is impermanent,’ then what is known is that some cause is permanent because of the negation of the permanence of particularity of a specific effect. 248

***4.1.5. and \[this negation of particularities\] is a false knowledge***

invalid knowledge is the non-comprehension of atoms because they are beyond senses, moreover it excludes \[the perception of\] impermanence; if an object is not seen, in what way can its impermanence be comprehended? therefore, impermanence is impossible to define; if \[asked\] how there can be comprehension \[at all\]? 

***4.1.6. comprehension \[of particularities\] is in respect to ‘shape’ , ***

***boundless \[extension\], multitude \[of number\], and essence249***

comprehension takes place regarding substance due to the inherent boundless size, due to many substances inherent as a cause and because of the appearance250 

such as white, and so forth; how is it so? because of \[the following\]

***4.1.7. if \[a substance\] has no essence, no comprehension ***

***of \[their\] atoms \[will be possible\]251***

even though atoms have ‘form-colour’ due to the absence of an inherent cause, the 

substance,252 there is no comprehension of them \[the atoms\]

qualities as to form a ‘lower generality’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\); even though there are combinations of say, atoms forming one large reservoir of water \(see Praśastapāda’s Bhāṣya 

\[57–9\]\) where we have a discussion about the formation of the atoms of the most subtle substance vāyu, which through a process of atomic composition \(dyads, triads\) form the ‘great air’ \(mahān vāyuḥ\); then, through the same mechanism, Brahmā brings into a similar composition the formation of the ‘great reservoir’ of water \(mahān salilanidhi\), then the ‘great mass of fire’ \(mahāṃs tejorāśiḥ\), and so forth. 

252 VSc 4.1.7 incidentally gives the definition of what Vaiśeṣika means by dravya, namely 

‘an entity’ which must have ‘generic essence’ as well as ‘particular essence’; although atoms have ‘particular essence’ they do not have ‘generic essence,’ therefore taking them separately from the mahābhūtas, atoms are not complete dravya because they lack the second fundamental characteristic of substance, namely ‘generic essence.’

253 Candrānanda differs from the broader Vaiśeṣika tradition – which maintains that trayaṇuka can be perceived; see VSc 7.1.15, where the same view about the non-comprehension of tryaṇuka is re-asserted further. 

254 ‘inherence of particularity’ in a substance and subsequently in many substances explains why – from an ontological point of view – particularity \(viśeṣa\) is co-extensive with universality \(sāmānya\); in other words, how the smallest is the grandest; if 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 143

***4.1.8. non-comprehension of ‘air’ is because it lacks ‘impetus’ of ‘form’***

non-comprehension of ‘air’ is because it lacks ‘impetus’ which is called ‘form-colour’ in respect to the reality of the boundless and multiplicity of substances; it is established on the basis that the non-comprehension regarding the atomic 

triad253 is due to the conceptualisation of the particularitiness of substances’ multiplicity; what about ‘form-colour’? 

***4.1.9. \[but\] comprehension is possible when an essence subsists in many ***

***substances due to the \[intuitive perception of a\] specific form254***

comprehension \[of whiteness\] is due to a co-existence of the quality in \[a\] 

pot and so forth, which is a gross substance inherent in many substances, and because of a specific ‘form’ which is called ‘rūpatva,’ and which is a ‘universal 

particularity.’ 255

***4.1.10. in this way, the ‘cognition’ of ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ***

***and ‘touch’ has been explained \[too\]***

by this \[above-mentioned logic\] the comprehension of ‘taste’ and so forth, is possible due to \[its\] co-existence in substance having many substances, and because of the universality and particularity of taste ‘rasatva’ and so forth. 

***4.1.11. \[inherence with substance\] is necessarily \[even\] ***

***when these \[qualities\] are absent256***

if there is non-comprehension of the atoms of colour inherent in one and many substances, nevertheless, perception is \[possible\] due to the transfer-concomitance which is the inherence of colour in one essence with many substances. 

***4.1.12. ‘numbers,’ ‘dimensions,’ ‘distinctness,’ ‘conjunction,’ ***

***‘disjunction,’ ‘remoteness,’ ‘proximity,’ and motion ***

***are perceptible by \[the\] eye because of \[their\] transfer-***

***concomitance in a substance which has ‘form’***

‘rūpi’ indicates a particular ‘form’ and it is by this that the comprehension of the things which are visualised by eye is possible, through the jointness of inherence 

\[of colours in things\] due also to the ‘particular universality’; why? 

the smallest is known, then the grandest becomes capable of being known as well, the 2 concepts being in a way synonymic. 

255 quality and specificity of quality are 2 distinct existentials; both can be perceived by a third existential called ‘universal particularity’ \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

256 ‘violation of the rule’ is the one mentioned above.

257 quality and its repeatability in many substances, is a concept that stands in close relationship with the reality of universals. 

258 inherence cannot be understood without the ‘genera’ or the ‘lower universal’ 

\(sāmānyaviśeṣa\) and should not to be confused with the ultimate particularity \(antyaviśeṣa\).’

259 Ganesh Thite: ‘because of the absence of that’ refers to the ‘absence of sāmānya and viśeṣa.’

260 the use of the preposition ‘adhi’ in the compound ‘adhyātmano’ points explicitly to ātman as the subject of this soteriological state’ ‘-adhi’ \(which means ‘over’\) is used in a prepositional compound, a governing compound possibly, to mean, ‘with respect to the self’ ‘concerning the self.’ Whitney, pp. 511–12, section 1310b.

261 ‘the group of 5’ refers to the 5 mahābhūtas, among which one needs to differentiate between those mahābhūtas that can form corporeal bodies \(śarīra\). See Garbha Upaniṣad \(Section 1\) edited by Paul Deussen, 1997. 

262 saṃyoga \(usually rendered as a ‘conjunction’\) is indeed a quality, but its use must be read in broader grammatical terms, hence the translation as ‘relation’ and not ‘conjunction.’

263 This is the view expressed in Garbha Upaniṣad ed. Deussen 1997: 639. 

264 ‘perceptible elements’ are ‘earth,’ ‘water,’ and ‘lustre.’

265 ‘non-perceptible’ elements are ‘wind’ and ‘vacuum.’

266 ātman refers here to the embodied ‘soul,’ and, as such, it is intimately related to the 5 mahābhūtas; their cohabitation may form an inherent relation. 

267 each class of atom corresponds to a region. 

268 knowledge of the cosmos at its most subtle level through the ‘ultimate particularity’ 

\(antyaviśeṣa\) is obtained by a ‘specific dharma’ that is born by the intellectual practice of yoga; to know the ‘specific dharma’ of each and any single entity, is an instrument

are connected but not inherent; \[for example\] the worlds of Varuṇa and so forth is made of waters and so forth \[elements\] which produce bodies \[accordingly\], but these are not \[bodies\] born out of a womb; why?

***4.2.6. \[dharma produces a body\] because of a particular effect269***

since there exists a body called mot and so forth due to their specific karmic activity, we think that these \[bodies\] are not born of a womb; and because of this

because of appellation like ‘Aṅgira born of coals’ we think that there are \[bodies\] 

non-womb born; why? 

and prerequisite for ultimate knowledge and absolute liberation; in this gloss, the formation of the body is made by a ‘specific dharma’ \(dharmaviśeṣa\), which presumably varies from a being to another. 

269 ‘kārya,’ the effect which presumably is alluded to here, takes effect as a result of a specific dharma \(according to karma theory\), which the dharma can be either auspicious or non-auspicious.

motion is caused because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘soul’ and hand at the beginning of an activity, \[and it is\] because ‘effort’ is dependent on a connection with its own substratum272; \[and\] since the cause is dependent on a ‘conjunction,’ ‘effort’ 

too is a cause; hence, motion in hand is because of these two \[causes\]. 

***5.1.2. similarly, the motion of a pestle is due to a connection with a hand***

such as ‘numbers’ have extension only, 273 so also the connection between hand and pestle is caused by a previous chain of \[differentiated\] activities which is 

‘effort’; 274 in the activity of the pestle however, the connection of ‘soul’ and hand is not an inherent cause of the activity of \[the\] pestle, because \[cause\] is already proved from a connection of hand conjoined with ‘soul.’

273 in the sense that they point to a sequence: ‘atideśa’ \(grammatical rule about the extension of properties\). 

274 The pūrvadhikṛta type of argument is meant to prove the argument for the existence of the souls, as derived from the doer of the effort.

275 in other words, if we read the sūtra as a continuation of the preceding sūtra, 

‘hastotpatanakarmaṇi’ are different from ‘ātmasaṃyoga.’

276 ‘then’ is missing here, but we can translate ‘cet’ with ‘then.’

277 saṃyoga refers to the involuntary and non-conscious motion produced by reflex, not by a connection with soul volition. 

278 ‘soul’ cannot have motion in itself, for all motions are secondary and happen because of ātman being connected with other things such as the hand \(one should also consider saṃyukta-samavāya ‘inferential induction’ by which things can be explained to happen\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 151

***5.1.3. \[motion\] produced by the stroke from the activities of pestle is different ***

***from the ‘conjunction’ with hand which does not cause \[motions\]***

when a speedy thing is connected with a stroke, the \[impulsive\] upwards activity of the pestle is produced because it strikes the mortar, \[thus\] the ‘conjunction’ 

of hand and pestle is not the cause \[of that activity\] because it vanishes \[imme-diately\] after the stroke of made by a previous ‘effort’; similarly, the absence of intention \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘let the pestle substance go up’ \[indicates\] the absence of the relation of ‘intention-effort’ with generating a quality and motion, because the contact between hand and pestle is not dependent on 

‘effort’ which is absent, therefore ‘effort’, is not the cause of upwards movement 

\[but rather the impulse\]. 

***5.1.4. similarly, the motions of hand and pestle \[is not ***

***the cause\] of the ‘conjunction’ with ‘soul’275***

just as the connection of pestle and hand is not a cause \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘the jumping up of hand is co-extensive with \[the\] pestle,’ similarly, the connection between ‘soul’ and hand is not a cause \[of impulse\] either, because connection is dependent on \[something else\] and because of the absence of ‘effort’ 

due to the absence of intention \[as in the sentence\] ‘let the hand go upwards with 

\[the\] pestle’; if you ask why these 2 bumpings \[happen\], then276 \[the answer is this\]:

***5.1.5. but motion in hand is because of a stroke-with-pestle ***

***\[as well as\] because of a connection-with-pestle277***

the stroke of the mortar causes the jump-up motion of \[the\] pestle; the connection of hand with pestle however, is dependent on the activity of hand which is the cause of the pestle’s speed \[but\] the stroke is not the inherent cause \[of hand activities\]

***5.1.6. \[that motion is\] additionally due to a motion of the ***

***‘self’ when in ‘conjunction’ with the hand278***

‘ātman’ refers here to one part of body, 279 for just as the motion of the pestle in hand is not experienced \[by soul\], so also - because the connection with the parts of the hand \[motion\] is dependent on the speed of the hand at the time of the upwards going of the hand - motion is produced in that part without being \[inten-

tionally\] experienced \[by soul\].280

279 Candrānanda explains that in this gloss, ātman refers to the embodied ‘soul’ or that which is seen as forming a part with the body

280 the commentator draws a distinction between voluntary motions and involuntary motions; he draws attention to the fact that, when it is said that ātman moves, this refers to the ‘embodied self,’ not to the substance ‘soul’ which, as gloss 5.2.23 clarifies, is devoid of motion.

281 a third form of motion, besides the conscious-voluntary and the unconscious-involuntary one, is the motion caused by the natural law of ‘gravitation,’ which again is not triggered by human will. 

282 here the causality takes us from the physical to the psychological causes. 

283 it refers to action-reaction type of forces, see Newton’s Third Law of Motion that explains that forces always come in pairs of action-reaction. 

284 this shows the extent to which ‘the psychological’ can influence ‘the physical’; questions concerning the nature of this volition in Vaiśeṣika, and whether it has a free choice or deliberative connotation may be considered in relation to Aristotle’s thought \(EN 3.2–4; EE 2.6–10; Rhet. 1.4–7\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 153

***5.1.7. falling is due to the absence of \[any\] connection because of ‘weight’***

falling takes place because of ‘weight’ when the connection between pestle and hand ceases due to \[their\] disconnection

***5.1.8. in the absence of a specific impulse, neither ***

***upwards, nor oblique movement \[can happen\]***

bouncing \[happens\] through a specific connection dependent upon an ‘effort’ with speed and impulse; and when there is no intentional stimulation there is neither impulse, nor upwards \[motion\], nor oblique \[motion\], \[but\] bouncing is due to 

‘weight’ alone;281 how is \[this\] specific impulse \[produced\]? 

***5.1.9. a specific impulse is from a specific ‘effort’***

when \[I, for instance, say\] ‘I throw this here’ that produces a ‘conjunction’ \[with\] 

‘effort’ which is \[in turn\] produced by a ‘particular volition’ from which there is the production of a ‘conjunction,’ namely the pushing away or removal of the substance such as hand and so forth from another substance.282

***5.1.10. a specific upwards throwing \[can happen\] ***

***because of a specific pushing283***

specific pushing which is produced from the ‘effort’ which is characterised by 

‘volition’ of throwing away produces the act of throwing to a remote place. 284

***5.1.11. boyish activity has been explained in respect to a hand-motion***

whatever palpitation in the womb and so forth, happens in accordance with \[something\] dependent on ‘effort’ that was previously co-experienced by the ‘biological life’285 in one part of the body; 286 but the group of activities of the mother, happens due to an ‘unseen force’ related to the ‘self’ \[which force however is\] not experi-

enced by the embryo.287

285 adṛṣṭa has therefore the power to influence the soul’s ‘effort’ and subsequently the individual ‘subtle body’ \(śarīraikadeśa\) which is forced to move out of the womb; here we might see an allusion to involuntary abortion, happened because of adṛṣṭa. 

286 See VSc 5.1.6. where ātman is defined as a part of the body, or as simply the ‘embodied ātman.’

287 this gloss refers to the condition of bondage, which the womb of the mother and the word itself both represent; in both these two conditions the law that affects the beings is the inauspicious dharma \(adṛṣṭa\); reality and liberation would be to escape from the bondage condition of the womb which is the world itself.

288 Kaṇāda may refer here to the thunder noise produced from a flash-burning in the clouds. 

289 sūtra presents types of actions that are by reflex not by ‘conscious activity’ or ‘effort.’

290 this is not due to a conscious motion but rather a physical realistic motion not caused by ‘effort.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 155

***5.1.12. thunder \[has been explained\] from an eruption, ***

***burning288 \[has been explained\] likewise289***

when the mind is busy with something else, that act of going away takes place regarding the burnt hand, that happens also because of a relation between hand and ‘soul’ dependent on ‘effort’ \[and\] preceded by ‘life’;290 and this is not by \[controlled\] conscious conceptualisation. 

***5.1.13. falling \[of the body\] during sleep is due to ‘weight,’ ***

***\[and\] because of the absence of ‘effort’291***

in the absence of the ‘effort’ of the body, the act of falling of some limbs \[e.g. 

hand, leg\] of a sleepy person takes place because of gravity-‘weight,’ due to the 

absence of \[any\] relation \[between ‘effort’ and ‘self’\].292

***5.1.14. motion of grass \[happens\] due to a connection with ‘air’***

motion of grass and so forth, is due to a connection between grass and ‘air’ 

dependent on speed, these \[happen\] without \[the involvement of any\] ‘effort.’

***5.1.15. going of a gem, the approaching of needle, these ***

***are \[motions\] caused by the ‘unseen force’***

the gem going towards thief and so forth, and the needle \[movement\] towards magnet, the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that \[they have been\] made by ‘dharma’ 

and ‘adharma.’

***5.1.16. the specific ‘conjunctions’ which are non-***

***simultaneousness when an arrow \[moves\] is the proof ***

***of other \[kind of\] motion \[which is successive\]***

\[one\] motion \[happens\] first because of an impulse, \[and\] the many motions of an arrow are produced because of a ‘latent impetus’; 293 yet, because the first motions exist and are not connected with ‘vacuum,’ which \[causes them to\] disappear,294 

therefore, the subsequent motions \[formed\] with ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ 

would not be produced later, therefore motion is many. 

291 a clear indication about the ‘law of gravity’ that in Western philosophy would be discovered and formalised by Newton. 

292 it refers to an action produced from an unconscious situation, in the absence of a 

sense-object relation – for instance, the absence of conscious perception of the 4-fold contact between soul, mind, senses, and object. 

293 although there is impulse at the beginning of a motion, however, the series of many movements are coordinated by another force, saṃskāra. 

294 motion is not continuous but fragmented in successive fractions.

\[the\] first act of pushing is therefore explained as being produced by the ‘conjunction’ of a string with an arrow which necessitates ‘effort’ or the pressure of a bow string, \[but\] the spreading over \[of the arrow’s first motion\] is made by the 

‘latent impetus,’295 being independent of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’; consequently, pushing comes to an end because of a ‘disjunction’ due to a relation with the motion, \[and\] the effect produced from the first motion is withdrawn \[which shows\] that the subsequent and the latter motions of \[the\] arrow are \[all\] operated by the ‘latent impetus’ \[and\] this \[repetition\] is being indicated by \[this sūtra\]. 

***5.1.18. falling is due to ‘weight’ \[regardless\] the ***

having stated the motions concerning the ‘embodied soul’ and those related to it, he comments upon the motions of the great elements –

***5.2.1. earth-motion is due to an impulse and a stroke, as ***

***well as to a conjunction with the conjunct***

a particular conjunction dependent on ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ speed, \[and\] ‘effort,’ 

combined and manifold, is the cause of motions due to pushing that is impelling, being the cause for non-‘disjunction,’ that is the ‘impulse,’ such as, for instance, when ‘earth’ called mud is pushed by a foot and so forth; motion takes place in the earth; ‘stroke’ means a connection dependent on ‘speed’ \[and\] is the cause of motion which is the reason for the ‘disjunction’ of something which is struck by strokes, for example due to the stroke of a chariot’s \[wheels\] with different portions of ‘earth’ and so forth, motions are seen; due to the conjunction of something connected by something pushed and something struck, motions take place because of a conjunction with the conjoint. 

296 Kaṇāda recognises 2 different forces: saṃskāra and gurutva \(gravitation\); see earlier gloss 5.1.17, where there is a difference between ‘impulse’ \(nodana\) and ‘latent impetus’ \(saṃskāra\) too; hence, there could be 3 motions: \(1\) first-motion-impetus; \(2\) ‘latent impetus’ \(which happens after the first-motion\); and \(3\) gravitation due to weight.

297 cosmos in Vaiśeṣika is structured in layers of supervenience composed from the subtlest elements such as ‘wind’ to the grossest which is ‘earth.’ See Praśastapāda’ 

Bhāṣya 57–59 \(Bronkhorst edition\). 

298 ‘sins’ is only a conjecture; it is not being explicitly mentioned here. 

299 note that ‘flowing’ \(syandana\) is different from ‘weight’ \(gurutva\); ‘weight’ must be for solid things, while ‘fluidity’ \(dravatva\) could be for liquids or oily things. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 159

***5.2.2. \[all\] these are caused by a specific ‘unseen force’***

whatever motion such as an earthquake and so forth in the entire earth – because of a connection with ‘air’ having conflicting motion – is produced in order to indicate the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of beings, that is caused by a specific ‘unseen’ force, for it indicates the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of all \[beings\]. 

***5.2.3. falling of ‘water’ is because of ‘weight’ \[and\] due to the ***

***absence of a connection \[with something to contain it\]***

motion of falling happens because of the ‘weight’ of ‘water,’ in the absence of a connection between cloud and the sustainer air297

***5.2.4. \[all\] these are caused by a specific ‘unseen force’ \[too\]***

regarding the prosperity of crops, or \[their\] loss, \[these\] are produced by the 

‘unseen force’ \[demerit, adharma\] of all people, 298 \[so also\] it is said that the motion of the falling is being caused by the ‘unseen force.’

***5.2.5. flowing exists because of ‘fluidity’299***

when waters do not have a force-sustainer,300 the motion of the flowing ‘water’ 

happens because of ‘fluidity.’301

***5.2.6. \[waters’\} ascension \[happens\] because of ***

***a connection of ‘wind’ with rays***

‘nādi’ refers to ‘rays,’ and sun has 2 kinds of rays: bright and shining; the bright one takes the ‘water,’ \[while\] the shining one causes growth; the ascension is dependent on the ‘effort’ of the sun, which is joint with the ‘air’ called pure vein 

‘nādi.’

300 vidhāraka stands for a cosmic authority, either personalised or not, which derives from the first-class stem dhṛ \(related to the concept of Ṛta and dharma\); it is thought that each of the elements is kept unified by a cosmic law. 

301 ‘water’ being an eternal substance can subsist in itself, and the unity of its parts is maintained by either the atomic law to which Vaiśeṣika ascribes, or by ‘ṛta’ \(a ‘specific dharma’ that characterises all cosmic components, either concrete or abstract\); thus, it not certain whether water is upheld because of a \[transcendental\] upholder, yet, Vaiśeṣika distinguishes between the physical motions and metaphysical motions.

302 presumably ‘ārohaṇa’ refers here to the ‘expansion’ of a garment during the process of knitting, rather than its ‘ascension’ as the Monier-Williams dictionary, p. 151 renders. 

303 ‘that something which is pressed and pushed’ may refer to the action of a needle in the knitting process. 

304 ‘water circulation’ in this context goes against the law of gravitation \(weight\), which has been discussed in gloss 5.2.3.

***5.2.10. \[water\] discharged from clouds is the ***

‘lustre exists in the ethereal waters’ this \[sentence refers to\] ‘lustre,’ and the act of water descending from the clouds, that is ‘thunder’ \[and\] is the mark of ‘lustre.’

***5.2.11. and \[these phenomena\] are Vedic \[evidence\]***

‘the \[waters\] which held fire forcefully as an embryo’ \[Atharva Veda 1.33.1\]305 this 

Vedic sentence is the mark of the ‘lustre’ \[subsisting\] in the heavenly waters. 306

305 quote traced back from Bloomfield’s Vedic Concordance; the edition of Jambūvijayaji \(Baroda 1961\), lacks such references, therefore every effort should be made to fill such lacunae. 

306 ‘heavenly waters’ \(āpas\), but Āpaḥ is in Vedic astrology a feminine deity, and a per-sonification of Water, who presides over the Pūrvāṣāḍhās ‘asterism’ \(nakṣatra\); the deity has therefore a motherly function because only mothers can contain water like an embryo; waters according to this cosmogonic myth, cover and contain the golden embryo that is symbolised by lustre.

307 substance ‘air’ is a broader concept than its local activities such as ‘wind’; thus, ‘wind’ 

may be seen as a component of ‘air,’ just as, for instance, ‘activity’ is a component of the substance ‘motion’; the commentator does not use different terminology for this ontological distinction. 

308 one hypothetical reading would be that the ‘selves’ to which the commentary alludes are the ‘subtle bodies’ described in Vedic eschatology, which are subject to rebirth; relevant to this is Praśastapāda’s use of the epithet ‘ativāhikaśarīra’ \(Bhāṣya 359\) in relation to the workings of dharma and adharma, which presumably impacts the des-tiny of the minute, yet transmigratory ‘subtle body’; Indian philosophy distinguishes, I think, between ‘substance soul,’ ‘subtle body,’ and ‘body’; mokṣa for Vaiśeṣika is removing the ‘subtle body’ from the pure nature of ‘soul’ in order to liberate it from the shackles of motion \(karma theory\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 163

***5.2.12. thunder is due to a ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of ‘water’***

thunder is the ‘sound’ of clouds and lightning; \[sound\] takes place because of a 

‘conjunction’ called mutual striking of waters which are being moved and which have become waves, ‘air’ has action from opposite directions; ‘sound’ is \[produced\] from a ‘disjunction’ of ‘water’ and from being cut off from one agitated 

‘wind.’307

***5.2.13. movement of ‘lustre’ and the motion of ‘air’ have ***

***been explained through ‘earth’-motions***

because ‘earth’-motion is \[triggered\] by a ‘conjunction’ with a conjoint impulse of the stroked \[thing\], it follows that ‘lustre’ and ‘air’ are types of irregular motion; 

\[thus\] this ‘earth’-motion is irregular; however, the regular \[motion is\]

***5.2.14. upwards burning of fire, oblique blowing of ‘wind’ ***

***and the first motion of atoms and ‘mind,’ \[all ***

***these\] are caused by the ‘unseen force’ ***

fire would stay or move sideways, the cooked thing would not change into ashes or water, also, if ‘air’ did not move horizontally there would be no kindling of fire for the substances to be purified; in the case of the subtle selves that had lost their bodies, 308 at the beginning of a new creation of the world there would not be a first motion of the atoms of ‘earth,’ and so forth, or, of their mutual approaching;309 

likewise, the yogis at the end of the world, those who had reached cosmic states, having steadied their ‘mind’ by ‘effort’ to continue \[in those states\], at the beginning \[of a new\] creation, there would be no initial motion of mind that connects 

\[them\] with a new body, all of these \[facts\] would not happen without the ‘unseen force’; 310 therefore, the upwards blowing of fire and the oblique blowing of ‘air,’ 

as well as the mutual motion of atoms, and the first motion of ‘mind,’ all these are also done by the ‘unseen force’ in the case of ‘living beings.’

309 ‘bodies’ \(śarīra\) either ‘subtle’ or ‘gross’ are constituted from 2 mahābhūtas \(earth and lustre\); ‘their mutual approaching’ at the turn of cosmic cycles \(‘at the beginning of a new world\) refers to the inability of the atoms of earth to form a new body of these selves, which are presumably trapped in a limbo, as the Vedic cosmology describes; the ‘unseen force’ \(adṛṣṭa, or dharma and adharma\) is the law of karma that dramatically influences not only the formation of new bodies, but more importantly the arrangement of the whole new cosmos which takes a new shape with each new turn of the destruction and dissolution of cosmos. 

310 the use of ‘adṛṣṭādṛṭa,’ which is the compound of adṛṣṭāt \(ablative\) \+ ṛṭe \(‘without’\) implies that all these motions and states of the individual selves ‘are attended by’ or 

‘depend on adṛṣṭa’; in other words, without adṛṣṭa, these do not happen.

***5.2.15. ‘mind-motion’ is explained by ‘hand-motion’***

when motion-in-hand happens because of a connection between ‘effort’ with 

‘soul,’ then, there is ‘mind-motion’ from a conjunction between ‘soul-mind-effort’ which is the motion of a embodied self \[ātman\]; while the ‘awakened-state’ 

is from ‘effort’ preceded by ‘volition’ and ‘aversion,’ yet, at the ‘time of awaken-ing,’ \[mind-motion\] is preceded by life principle; 

\[introductory line\]: since yoga is a ‘conjunction’ and because the ‘effect-of-motion’ is a limb of yoga, \[therefore\] yoga and mokṣa are \[both\] described in the chapter of motion – 

***5.2.16. the non-occurrence \[as well the occurrence ***

***of\] ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are because of a ***

***contact between soul-mind-senses-object***

‘anutpatti’ is explained to be the non-occurrence of the \[4-fold\] contact; thus, 

\[Kaṇāda\] says –

***5.2.17. yoga is that which, when‘mind’ stays in the ‘soul,’ \[makes such ***

***that\] ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ no longer exist in the embodied \[soul\]***

when indeed, ’mind’ is steady in the ‘soul’ and not in the senses, then there is non-occurrence of the 4-fold contact; the result of these 2 \[situations\] is the form of absence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain,’ yoga being the ‘conjunction’ between 

‘mind’ and ‘soul’ which depends on a breathing control of the ‘soul’ with a body. 

\[introductory line\] why the activity of prāṇāyāma, which is part of yoga, is not mentioned? 

***5.2.18. the motion of ‘ātman’ is explained ***

***by the motion of body***

here, the word ‘ātman’ refers to ‘air’; such as there is motion-in-hand because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘effort’ with ‘ātman,’ similarly, there is a ‘conjunction’ 

between ‘ātman,’ ‘air,’ and ‘effort’ \[and that\] is the motion of prāṇāyāma.

311 sūtra does not necessarily imply that the atomic mind is that which goes away and in; it only mentions that a dravya – presumably but not certainly – the atomic mind, comes into contact with whatever is ‘consumed’ \(upayukta\), ‘eaten’ \(ānna\), and 

‘drunk’ \(āpāna\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 167

***5.2.19. going away, coming in, ‘conjunction’ with \[something\] ***

***eaten, drunk, as well as ‘conjunction’ with other ***

***activities, are \[all\] caused by the ‘unseen force’***

at the time of death, there is going in and going forth of ‘mind’ from a previous body, the going in of the ‘mind’311 is due to a connection with another body, that 

which is situated in the womb begins to \[take shape\] from the state of ‘semen’ 

and ‘blood’ to \[that\] which is of the ‘measure’ of an ‘embryo,’ the conjunction between eaten and drunk is a contact312 attached to that which is used \[by the mother\] which enters through the vein in those \[stages of the foetus\] which are 

\[caught up\] in the cosmic cycle namely \[the development stages\] kālala, arbuda, māṃsa, peśī, and ghaṇa, as well as the ‘mind’-‘soul’-’conjunction’ with other activities, and the retreating of other \[activities\] and so forth \[all\] are done only by the ‘unseen force,’ and not by ‘effort.’

***5.2.20. absolute liberation is when there is absence of that ***

***\[unseen force\] because there is no ‘conjunction’ ***

***due to the non-manifestation \[of body\]***

in the absence of \[the\] ‘unseen force’ which is the instrumental cause of the begin-ningless motion of ‘form,’ the absence of the ‘conjunction’ of ‘mind’ and ‘soul,’ 

which is called life principle \[jīvana\], and the non-manifestation of a body, which is called mokṣa, is the argument for \[the existence of\] darkness \[according to which\] everything is covered and that knowledge of darkness cannot be ascertained; that is \[to say\] again –

***5.2.21. because it is a different \[category\] from substance, quality, and ***

***motion, darkness is only the absence of manifestation \[of light\]***

darkness is neither a substance, nor a quality, nor \[even\] motion because of the inscrutability of \[its\] substratum, because of \[its\] undifferentiated nature with regard to impermanent substances, because \[it\] is antithetical to brightness, because \[it\] is intangible, and because of \[its\] undifferentiated nature with regard to permanent substances, and due to the fact that \[it\] is perishable; therefore, darkness is only the absence of light; how is this? 

312 this contact is called ‘sambandho’śitapītasaṁyoga’ and takes place throughout the stages of embryonic formation.

313 ‘sadbhāvāt’ presumably the lustre light refers to another kind of light, the light that exists inside a cave, this light, however, is not the same as sunlight. 

314 that ‘soul’ is devoid of motion might be just an explanatory innovation inserted by Candrānanda in the list of abstract substances. 

315 ‘this explanation’ may refer to the above sūtras which use the vaidharmic \(or differential\) epistemological reasoning, which seeks to settle definitions by drawing distinctions \(rather than by sādharmyic reasoning that does so by drawing commonalities\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 169

***5.2.22. and \[darkness\] is due to lustre being covered by another \[entity\]***

because of the absence of \[lustre’s\] occurrence in other substances, as in a mountain cave for instance, the brightness of Savitṛ \(sun god\) exists externally from that of the lustre’s manifestation \[inside the cave\], 313 therefore, we think that dark-

ness is the absence of lustre, only; external \[darkness\] is removable by a lamp, but 

\[darkness which is\] ignorance \[can be removed\] through the lustre of knowledge, thus, in this way both ‘liberation’ \[mokṣa\] and ‘yoga‘ \[yoga\] are explained. 

***5.2.23. ‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘vacuum’ are devoid of motion, and are ***

***distinguishable from \[things\] which are possessed by motion***

‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘vacuum’ are formless, and because \[they\] are different from 

‘earth’ and so forth, which have concrete form and activity, \[but space and so forth\] have no concrete form, therefore are motionless, \[but\] due to the word ‘ca’ 

\[and\], ‘soul’ is also \[considered\]314 devoid of motion. 

***5.2.24. by this \[explanation\]315 qualities and motions are being explained***

in this way, because of formlessness, the ‘qualities’ and ‘motions’ are to be considered motionless, because the word ‘ca,’ universal and so forth categories \[are motionless too\]. 316

***5.2.25. ‘inherence’ in things devoid of motion is a contradictory ***

***\[and different category\] than ‘motion’***

motion is not inherent in \[things\] that are devoid of motion, such as stroke and so forth, because motion is generating \[motion\] in its own substratum, 317 \[not the substratum of things\]

***5.2.26. but qualities are non-inherent causes***

concerning qualities which are stated to be causes, they are non-inherent, because themselves are cause such as cause \[itself\] is. 

316 concepts that are devoid of motions are ākāśa, diś, ātman, guṇa, karma, and sāmānya; could they all have in common a universal nature as well? 

317 ‘generating motion in its own substratum’ resembles Aristotle’s view on ‘essence’ or 

‘nature’ which has a ‘principle of movement,’ Aristotle \(Physics 192b20\).

318 perception of difference is fundamental for Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology; it refers to the possibility of the knowledge about the essence of substances which is ultimately ‘differentiated’; viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa are concepts of a crucial importance, both ontologically and epistemologically, respectively. 

319 it is debatable if ‘direction’ is an appropriate translation for ‘diś.’

320 all substances as well as all qualities are possessed by a ‘specific dharma,’ an epistemic entity that plays an important role in Vaiśeṣika’s theory of individuation, for it is dharma that which, for instance, identifies in a universal, say redness, a particular red from another particular red, both of which belong to the same class of redness. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 171

***5.2.27. ‘space’ is defined by \[its\] qualities***

‘space’ which is explained as the instrumental cause of the perception of the variation \[of states\]318 as in sentences such as ‘departing eastwards’; extension is because of being cause and because of \[space being\] non-inherent \[in the perception of variation\]. 

***5.2.28. ‘time’ is defined by causality \[of the states of space\]***

that by means of which ‘direction’319 is explained \[produced\] by the conceptualisation of the manifold, by that, ‘time’ \[itself\] is explained to be the instrumental cause for the conceptualisation of the manifold \[as expressed in the sentence\] 

‘\[time\] done simultaneously \[with space\]’.

after having explained the motions, \[now\] qualities will be explained; concerning these, ‘dharma’ is being explained first, because this is how \[it\] was first intended by the śāstras; according to a Vedic injunction \[dharma\] is the means \[for the knowledge of qualities\];320 if you ask on the truthfulness of the Vedas, then \[the answer is yes\] because –

***6.1.1. sentences formulated in the Vedas, are preceded by an Intellect321***

‘one desirous of heaven should sacrifice agnihotra’ \[…\]322 such \[an\] element \[of faith\] is authoritative because it derives from a prior Intellect \[and\] because it is composed by Bhagavān Īśvara, therefore it is authoritative for its truthfulness is invariably connected with a trustworthy person who composed it; if you say that which is beyond sense organs is impossible to know, then, 

321 given that the subject of this āhnika is the knowledge of qualities, the relationship between Vedas and Divine Intellect must be analysed through the lens of the relationship between the ‘quality’ sound \(e.g. Vedas\) and ‘substance’ God \(Intellect, Bhagavān Īśvara\). Between them there is an intimate relationship of ‘inherence.’

***6.1.2. \[the\] characteristic mark of a seer’s \[intellect\] ***

***is that it is unlike our cognition***

‘liṅga’ means the knowledge by means of which a subject-meaning is known; the knowledge of Maheśvara is not similar to our knowledge which connects the subject-matter with things near and present, because the god-like \[or seers’\] 

knowledge manifests about things which are beyond sense-organs; how is it that 

\[Maheśvara\] is known? 

***6.1.3. similarly, the characteristic mark of a Brahmin \[or ***

***seers’ knowledge\] is the act of naming \[things\]***

in our case, knowledge as to \[whether\] ‘this is a Brahmin’ cannot be produced without initiation, by mere sight, or ordinary perception; concerning \[the name of\] the son \[of Brahmiṣṭa\] and so forth, conducting the naming-ritual is after the consideration of the meaning as well as with the perception of \[him\]; the meaning of the sūtra is that conducting the naming-ritual of the Brahmin and so forth, is after due consideration with perception of the subject-matter, and these have been enunciated \[by the sūtra\]; therefore –

***6.1.4. sacrificial offerings are \[or must be\] preceded by \[Vedic\] knowledge***

this is how Parameśvara made the Vedas in the beginning arranging them in sentences in fix position\[s\], as well as the tradition smārta concerning offerings and so forth which have also been foreseen by the Intellect of Bhṛgu323 who is the 

maker of these \[offerings\], and who expounded their contents after having considered the sacred texts, he divided them into innumerable branches; therefore, 

injunctions such as the act of offering and so forth, are conducive to ‘dharma.’324

***6.1.5. similarly, receiving \[must be\] preceded by \[Vedic\] knowledge325***

for instance, the act of receiving is only in the case of a \[Brahmin\] who has lost his way of livelihood, one who has pure birth, \[and\] one who possesses the proper qualities for taking, \[such receiving\] leads to dharma. 

324 translated ‘bring about’ instead of ‘they cause dharma’ because I wish to stress the ontological importance and prevalence of dharma in this commentary. 

325 in other words, the act of receiving is \[or should be\] preceded by Intellect.

there is no achievement of mundane elevation after having fed an impure Brahmin, even if there is the utterance of blessings, and so forth; 327 now, what is impure?

you should know that anyone who commits violence against another person is impure whether the \[violence\] is in the form of mental or corporeal pain; the word 

‘hiṃsa’ \[violence\] is an indication \[of many such kinds\], because –

327 here the rule is addressed to pure Brahmins; blessing and true speeches have no effectiveness if the internal and deep purity of the Brahmin is not confirmed; in Indian philosophy, there is not always dissociation between speaker and the spoken, between object and meaning, between śabda Brahman and śabda of people; there is often a holistic and immanent yet dualistic and transcendental mode in understanding truth.

328 samabhivyāhāra, ‘companionship’ includes ‘speech’ and ‘conversation,’ which means that even speech may be polluted by either listening to or conversing with a violent person. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 177

***6.1.11. impurity \[subsists even\] in companionship328***

concerning a person who gets impurity, \[that one\] commits a great sin even through sheer conversation \[with an impure Brahmin\], then what about \[impurity in\] speaking, and through feeding and so forth? in this passage the word 

‘samabhivyāhāra’ means conversation, while in the previous passage it means blessing. 

***6.1.12. such \[impurity\] does not subsist when \[in ***

***companionship\] with a pure \[Brahmin\] ***

that impurity in the form of conversation does not exist in a Brahmin who is devoid of violence and so forth; in the case of the pure \[Brahmin\] also –

***6.1.13. \[nor does impurity subsists in\] ‘propensity’ ***

***towards a morally-qualified \[Brahmin\] ***

‘propensity’ of a person wishful of prosperity \[should not be\] towards only a Brahmin devoid of violence, but \[also\] towards a Brahmin who is qualified through 

\[qualities\] related to ‘time,’ ‘region,’ ‘knowledge,’ and ‘demeanour’; therefore, 

***6.1.14. there \[should not be\] propensity \[for companionship\] ***

***towards a mediocre \[or\] inferior \[Brahmin\]***

a pure Brahmin observing the space \[rule of settlement\] and other \[rules\] is described as \[a\] morally qualified \[Brahmin\]; one who is bound by \[only\] one of these moral qualities is mediocre; and one who is associated with all the qualities is a distinctively superior \[Brahmin\]; avoid these 2 impure \[Brahmins\], kṣatriya or other class, or any living creatures \[because they are\] considered inferior; one who desires ‘mundane elevation’ should not have propensity towards a mediocre or inferior Brahmin, but only towards a distinctively superior Brahmin, at the time of Vaiśākhī \[month\]329 

and so forth, offering \[him\] gold and along with a mantra, and so forth. 

***6.1.15. this is why, accepting \[offerings\] are explained \[differently\] between ***

***the inferior, mediocre, and morally-qualified \[Brahmins\]***

thereby, the act of accepting money from another at the time of calamity has been explained in a reverse sequence; and thus it is stated: ‘in the beginning one may accept from an inferior \[person\] in his absence \[may accept\] from a mediocre 

\[Brahmin\]; in the absence of that \[mediocre Brahmin\] however, one may accept from a superior-qualified \[Brahmin\].’

330 tyāga: ‘avoid,’ ‘abandon,’ ‘kill,’ or ‘sacrifice.’

331 ‘self-surrender’ \(ātmatyāga\) refers to a form of ‘suicide’ when one is attacked by a superior Brahmin; there should be self-sacrifice, rather than the act of sacrificing or killing a pure Brahmin. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 179

***6.1.16. comparably, avoiding the hostile ones \[should ***

***be applied in a reversed order\]***

in the similar reverse order, a Brahmin should kill enemies when these attack for the sake of killing \[and\] those who are inferior to himself. 

***6.1.17. when \[encountering\] a mediocre \[Brahmin\], should one ***

***sacrifice330 oneself \[to him\], or \[sacrifice\] the adversary\[?\]***

there is an option regarding the Brahmin who is attacked by an enemy endowed with qualities equal to his: \[either\] killing oneself or \[killing\] the aggressor. 

***6.1.18. \[but\] when \[encountering\] a morally-superior \[Brahmin\] ***

***one should sacrifice oneself \[rather than harming him\]331***

one who is captured by an enemy with superior qualities should \[rather\] accept death at the hands of the enemy; here the usage of \[the words\] inferior and so forth refer to oneself, and in mutual dependent relation with the act of accepting.

‘elevation’; which are these?

333 it could refer to saṃdhyā devotion that is performed at twilight. 

334 the author recognises adṛṣṭa the role to obtain benefits that lead to ‘mundane elevation’; all these acts enumerated are performed not for ‘liberation’ \(niḥśreyasa\) but rather for ‘abhyudaya,’ hence the translation with ‘for the sake of adṛṣṭa’ – it means that dharma is obtained from each of these acts. 

335 Vaiśeṣika accept Brahman as the generating principle. 

336 ‘abhayadānaṃ’ \(offering for protection\) refers to the protection of animals and other human beings, with reference to non-violence – it is basically referring to ahiṃsā. 

337 VSc 6.1.14. where ‘offering of gold’ is mentioned being performed at full moon in April–May. 

338 ‘prokṣaṇa’ a possible reference to the saṃdhyā ritual.

***forest, sacrifice, offering, sprinkling water,333 mantra related to*** *** ***

***‘space,’ lunar station \(nakṣatra\), and injunctions regarding ‘time’ ***

***are \[all performed\] in accordance with the ‘unseen force’334***

bathing is ablution in relation to the body and \[its performance\] consists of ‘water’ 

in respect to a specific ‘time’ and ‘space’; fasting is in the form of refraining from food preceded by a rule concerning day \[and\] night; celibacy is of the kind of abstaining from women and so forth, which means that \[abstaining\] refers to a Brahmin’s moral conduct in relation to ‘mind’ and ‘soul,’ and by the word ātman, it refers to Brahman; 335 dwelling with a guru is living in his house first for the purpose of wisdom, as well as devotion \[to him\], and other \[duties\]; dwelling in 

\[a\] forest is after having renounced the household to dwell in a forest as prescribed by the śāstras; sacrifice is cooked sacrifice and so forth; offering is ‘safety offer-

ing’336 and ‘gold offering’337 and so forth; sprinkling is in relation to adoration at 

twilight,338 and so forth; ‘space’-related rules and so forth regarding other ‘particularities’ \[of religious life\]; ‘direction’-related rule \[is the rule\] ‘one should eat facing east’ \[Tait. Brahm. 1.1.2\];339 the rule of constellation is: ‘one should enact fires on lunar mansion’ \[…\]; 340 the rule concerning mantra is ‘devasya tveti’341 

by which one takes out \[the material for the sacrificial cake\]; the rule regarding 

‘time’ is ‘a Brahmin should establish fire during spring-time’ \[…\]; thus, with all such things, when they have their ‘examined purpose’ concealed and are being conducted \[as such\], then, ‘dharma’ is obtained. 

***6.2.3. the \[duties of the\] 4 stages of life are both ***

***deceitful342 as well as non-deceitful343***

now, whatever act344 concerning the 4 stages of life when performed with defect or without defect, that leads to ‘dharma’ or ‘adharma,’345 what is \[considered\] 

defect? 

339 this reference follows the recommendation which the Italian edition \(VSi\) of Leonardo V. Arena \(1987:155\) provides. 

340 according to Hindu astrology, Kṛttikā is the third of the 27 nakṣatras; it is ruled by Sun; see Black Yajurveda: Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 

341 the rule can be rephrased as ‘one should take out the material for the sake \(devatasya\) of sacrificial cake.’

342 ‘anupadhā category’ includes acts that should be performed ‘without break’ or ‘purity of intention’ \(VSc 6.2.5\). 

343 ‘upadhā acts’ are acts that are not conductive to dharma because they are performed with a form of ‘internal impurity’ \(aśuci\), ‘break,’ or ‘failure’ \(VSc 6.2.4\). 

344 the usual translation for ‘karma’ has been ‘motion,’ but in this context it may refer to 

‘acts’ or ‘deeds’ that any of the 4 āśramas require. 

345 if there are defects, then the act leads to the absence of dharma, and when there are no defects in the act, then it leads to dharma.

***6.2.4. ‘defect’ is the fault in a condition***

***6.2.5. absence of defect \[refers to\] a flawless condition***

***and sprinkling upwards, according to the ‘form,’ ***

***‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ \[and\] ‘touch’ of a desired thing***

sprinkling upwards with ‘water’ only, and sprinkling downwards preceded by a mantra is a pure \[act\] and is not prohibited because its \[performance related to\] 

form and so forth is \[mentioned\] in the smṛti texts; that which is contrary \[to that\] 

that is impure; moreover –

***6.2.7. purity obstructs impurity***

corrupt speech and so forth \[unlawful acts\] is the \[reason\] because of which one who \[is\] absolutely pure \[entity\] is prohibited from \[interacting with\] an impure 

\[entity\]

***6.2.8. and \[obstructs\] other things \[as well\]347***

and liquor for example, is that which is also impure because it is clearly prohibited; therefore, one should eat something which is pure; indeed

***6.2.9. ‘mundane elevation’ is not obtained from pure food \[consumed\] ***

***by one who is unrestrained, because \[he/she\] lacks control***

one who is un-restraint and devoid of specific ‘effort,’ even if it uses pure food accidentally, there will be no ‘elevation’, for in this case it lacks a specific moral intention; \[objection\] that is not so, 

347 sūtra wishes to extend the discussion about things that are impure by comparison with pure things and acts.

***6.2.10. and there is a restraint which is known to have another meaning***

restraint does not mean something dissimilar from ‘effort’; if ‘effort’ is absent from all activities, there will be absence of ‘effort’ in the case of a person using pure food; \[objection\] if ‘effort’ is so important, then there will be mundane elevation even without yoga and so forth; \[response\] no, this cannot be so:

***6.2.11. when this \[yogic restraint\] is absent \[then\] there is absence ***

***of the ‘existential’ \[mundane elevation\] \[as well\]***

in the absence of the performance of yoga and so forth \[and\] only by ‘effort’ 

there is no mundane elevation, because it is a worthless instructive activity; now 

\[Kaṇāda\] explains ‘dharma’ which is conducive to absolute liberation. 

***6.2.12. \[yogic restraint is important\] because from ‘pleasure’ \[arises\] passion***

passion is augmented from ‘pleasure’ only, and is produced from subjects such as women, and so forth; 

***6.2.13. because \[passion\] becomes identical with the object \[of pleasure\]***

since one becomes identical with it \[passion\] due to causes \[like\] ‘pleasure,’ 

because the body is made of them \[the qualities of pleasure\] then, due to becoming identical, passion takes place; moreover, 

***6.2.14. \[because the subject\] is gratified***

when one is satisfied because of a full-grown body there is passion from satisfaction; moreover, 

***6.2.15. \[gratification\] is due the ‘unseen force’***

someone’s passion is produced from causes not previously seen and there the 

‘unseen force’ causes \[the ‘subtle self’\] to be born again; moreover,

348 ‘crawling beings eating grass’ \(tiraścāṃ tṛṇādibhojane\). 

349 ‘icchādveṣapūrvikā dharmādharmayoḥ pravrttiḥ’ could be simply translated by ‘propensity towards dharma’ and adharma is preceded by ‘propensity’ and ‘antipathy’; in other words, whatever inner and uncontrolled inclinations one has determines the future of acts conducive to dharma and adharma. 

350 ‘grāmakāmeṣṭyādau’ may refer to a man who desires to join the collective inhabitants of a place such as heaven, reachable after death. 

351 the gloss describes the chain of causation from the external psychological level of emotions \(‘volition’\) down to dharma, which is an invisible entity of an ethical order that characterises both the entities, either mental, molecular, or atomic; reality has at least 3 levels: physical, psychological, and ethical \(dharmic\). 

352 questions must be addressed further: Where is this accumulation stored? Where is its substratum? the mind? the ‘soul’? 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 187

***6.2.16. a particular passion arises \[according to\] its particular species***

such as there are crawling beings348 eating grass and so forth, similarly there is passion \[according to\] a particularity of species also; and passion is because of 

‘pleasure’ and so forth, ‘aversion’ is because of ‘pain’ and so forth, therefore –

***6.2.17. ‘volition’ and ‘aversion’ precede the propensity ***

***towards ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’349***

‘volition’ precedes the propensity towards ‘dharma,’ and conversely, ‘aversion’ 

precedes the condition of being full of intoxication, but the one who overcomes 

\[these flaws\] precedes the desire to attain the heavenly abode first by oblation;350 

concerning someone infatuated with the wife of another, that \[thought\] has been preceded by a ‘volition’ as well as by adharma;351 hence, this is an accumulation 

of ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma’;352 this is so, because, 

***6.2.18. from that \[unseen force\] there is ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’***

when there is accumulation of ‘dharma’ and ‘adharma,’ then there is ‘conjunction’ between flesh and senses, and that is called ‘birth-principle’ \[janman\], and when these \[dharma and adharma\] are reduced, the ‘disjunction’ \[of body from senses\] takes place at the time of death; moreover, the ‘being’353 is without begin-

ning and it returns like a \[Persian\] wheel of ‘water’-pots, and \[because of dharma and adharma\] there is ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ with body; this is explained in a reversed order, for example –

***6.2.19. liberation is explained in relation to ‘motion’ \[and\] ‘soul’***

the \[word\] ‘ātman’ refers to ‘mind,’354 \[and\] liberation is that \[which is to be understood\] in relation to mind motions, in the absence of ‘that,’355 in the absence of a connection \[of these mentioned above\], and in the ‘non-manifestation’ \[of body\]356 this is \[how\] liberation is explained;357

**// the sixth chapter //**

353 the being that returns must be the ‘subtle self,’ which is to be identified by the term 

‘jantu’; it cannot be the ‘soul’ because soul lacks intrinsic capacity of motion. 

354 contrary to what we might be tempted to translate, the commentator explains that 

‘ātma’ does not refer to ‘soul’ in this gloss. 

355 ‘tat’ refers to adṛṣṭa \(tad abhāve\), see VSc 5.2.20. 

356 ‘aprādurbhāva’ \(non-manifestation\) of a new ‘biological subtle body’ \(jantu\). 

357 the importance of such negations derives from being discussed in relation to mokṣa; the ‘motion in mind’ is a particularly vital factor here; as it is known, buddhi, which is a vaiśeṣikaguṇa, will not be a constitutive part of the state of mokṣa; it will eventually vanish, leaving the ātman completely blank, which is due to the dissolution of adṛṣṭa, which seems to have manoeuvred them until then.

now, he explains ‘form-colour’ and so forth,

the qualities intended by the sūtra358 are ‘form-colour’ and so forth, this is the 

meaning \[of the sūtra\]

***7.1.2. and the definition of qualities has been explained \[too\]***

the meaning is designated in respect to the difference between \[qualities\], substances, and motions as stated by \[the sūtra\] ‘\[qualities\] have substance as a substratum’ \[1.1.15\]

***7.1.3. and \[the definition\] has been stated thus: ‘this quality ***

***7.1.4. ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ and ‘touch’ are ***

***transitory \[qualities\] of ‘earth’ because of the ***

***impermanence of \[the concrete\] substance***

because the substratum is dissolvable, its ‘form-colour’ and so forth which are implied in \[that substratum\] are also dissolved, for example because substance-substratum is dissolved ‘pot’ \[made\] of ‘earth’ \[is dissolved too\]. 

***7.1.5. \[impermanence of concrete substance\] is ***

***because of a conjunction with fire***

destruction of ‘form-colour’ and so forth \[which happens\] in the atoms of ‘earth’ 

is because of the association with fire, 359 \[and because\] the inherent product disappears with its substratum too; 360 how is it that there is a connection of atoms with fire? 

360 ‘inherence’ \(samavāya\) opposed to saṃyoga is supposed to explain a form of ‘occurrence’ \(vṛtti\), a ‘dependent occurrence’ of holes in their parts or of attributes in their substratum.

361 qualities are permanent and by ‘manifestation’ of quality from another quality one may understand what seems to be the pīlupākavāda theory of qualities of atoms, whereby qualities are not destroyed but rather transformed as a result of a contact with fire. 

362 alternative translation: ‘because from qualities such as black and so forth, different qualities are produced separately, therefore, earlier qualities of atom are destroyed, because something which has qualities cannot produce other qualities \[simultaneously\]’; what derives from this gloss is the capacity of production of new qualities successively, not simultaneously, and only after the previous ones have disappeared. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 191

***7.1.6. \[the impermanence of qualities is\] because the ***

***qualities metamorphose into others361***

because that from which there is production of blackness and other qualities and so forth is different from the production of other qualities;362 therefore, the previous qualities of atoms are destroyed, because a quality cannot be produced from that which possesses \[the same\] quality. 

***7.1.7. by this \[metamorphosis\] the impermanence363*** *** ***

***of the permanent364*** *** is explained***

in this way, the production of other qualities in the permanent atoms \[and\] the impermanence of ‘colour’ and so forth has been stated in relation to ‘earth’ 

\[atoms\] only;365 because –

***7.1.8. for example ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ are ***

***permanent because the essence is permanent ***

because of the permanence of the substratum, the atoms of ‘water,’366 ‘lustre,’ 

‘air,’ and \[their\] ‘form-colour’ and so forth are permanent too, due to the non-production of conflicting qualities, \[and\] because there is no destruction due to a 

‘conjunction’ with fire. 367

***7.1.9. \[another example:\] impermanence subsists in impermanent ***

***\[substances\] due to substances’ impermanence368***

in \[substances\] which are impermanent, ‘water’ and so forth, \[qualities\] such as 

‘form-colour’ and so forth are impermanent too, because of being destroyed with the destruction of the \[concrete\] substance. 

***7.1.10. and \[those qualities produced\] from heating the ***

***‘earth’ are primarily qualities of cause***

qualities such as ‘colour’ and so forth are produced in ‘earth’ which is impermanent when is in its ‘product form’, and these are preceded by the qualities of 

\[their\] cause; in ‘earth’ which is permanent together with the atoms’ intrinsic nature, \[their qualities\] are produced from heat due to a ‘conjunction’ between fire and heating. 

363 ‘impermanence’ \(nitya\) here refers to qualities. 

364 sūtra indicates the permanence of ‘substance’ \(dravya\). 

365 regarding the dissolution of form-colour in relation to its substratum \(pot\). see VSc 7.1.4. 

366 ‘salila’ another term for ‘water,’ ‘liquid,’ ‘tears.’

367 the permanence of qualities is acknowledged. 

368 alternative translation: when the substratum is destroyed, the qualities are destroyed too; when the permanent substances exist, the permanent qualities exist too.

369 originally a substance has no \(specific\) qualities, for qualities are produced afterwards \(asatkāryavāda\); nor does it have motions, which brings us to infer that the English translation of ‘dravya’ is closer to ‘essence’ rather than a ‘concrete thing.’

370 ‘motion’ \(karman\) has no qualities, such as a substance can have. 

371 what could be the ‘subject-matter’ referred to here? the commentator says that subject-matter can be ‘undistinguished \(aviśeṣa\) from the qualities of the entire whole’; the answer may be drawn from the first line of the same gloss ‘qualities are produced due to the qualities of cause,’ which leaves us to infer that a substance has 2 sets 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 193

***7.1.11. in ‘water’, ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ there are no \[other qualities\] that ***

***are produced from heating which are primarily qualities of cause***

in ‘water,’ which is a composite product and whose nature is an inherent cause, qualities such as ‘colour’ and so forth are produced; but in the permanent \[earth\] 

in its atomic structure, \[the qualities\] do not exist at all because there are no other opposite qualities \[produced from heating\] in the atoms of water. 

***7.1.12. there are no qualities \[other than\] the qualities ***

***produced from substance, because the qualities ***

***\[produced\] by motions are not qualities***

qualities are produced due to the qualities of cause in relation to a substance which is produced without qualities369 and they are not produced from \[other\] qualities and motions, 370 due to the absence of co-existence whose subject-matter is one 

and the same with the qualities of the whole \[thing\],371 just as motionness is. 

***7.1.13. this is how the cooked \[qualities\] are explained***

when that which is produced from cooking such as blackness and so forth ceases to exist because of a connection with fire, then, those \[products\] are established to be devoid of quality; if you say that – just as connection is produced in something which has connection – qualities born out of cooking \[of a substance which has qualities\] are then produced from baking, then \[the answer is\] no, 

***7.1.14. because \[qualities subsists\] in one substantiality \[only\]372***

if \[the qualities\] produced from heat are connected with one substance, \[then the question is\] how could they be produced since they are opposite \[in nature\]? the initiation of a ‘conjunction’ with a substance will not be a defective \[argument\] 

because substance is many; 373 now we shall discuss ‘dimension’ –

of qualities, some ‘specific,’ others ‘generic’ \(e.g. soul\); when, however, it is said that originally a substance has no qualities, that must refer to its ‘specific qualities’ 

\(vaiśeṣikaguṇa\) which occur as a result of ‘motion’ and presumably under the impact of adṛṣṭa \(karma theory\). 

372 there are 3 kinds of substantiality: essential-universal; accidental-particular; and the specific-genera \(sāmānyaviśeṣa\). 

373 ‘contact’ \(saṃyoga\) takes place only among substances, whereas ‘inherence’ 

\(samavāya\) takes place between substances and qualities.

374 the question to which the gloss attempts an answer is the following: starting with which size is the perception of an entity possible? The atom cannot be perceived because it is too small, neither dyad, nor even ‘mind’ which is of the size of an atom; it appears that for Vaiśeṣikas, it is possible to perceive ‘soul’ through ‘awareness’ \(see VSc 3.2.13\) but not ‘mind’ which is too small – unless one is an advanced yogi. 

375 ‘ordinary perception’ \(pratyakṣa\) is possible with things that can be ‘seen’ somehow, therefore the size of ‘boundless’ of an entity begins with triad upwards \(such as the quality of ‘number’ applies to anything beyond ‘number two’; not with ‘zero’ or 

‘one,’ which presumably are not numbers\); the sentence ‘boundless and minuteness are causes’ shows once again that for Vaiśeṣika philosophy, ontology of qualities and substances precedes and is more important than epistemology. 

376 the view that triad \(tryaṇuka\) is still un-graspable \(VSc 4.1.8\) differentiates Candrānanda from other Vaiśeṣika commentators, an observation upheld by both Isaacson and Priesendanz. 

377 sūtra appears to acknowledge the difference between ‘multiplicity of causes’ 

\(kāraṇabahutva\) and ‘boundless of causes’ \(kāraṇamahattva\), one may point to a successive chain of causality, the other to its extension or capacity to form largeness or infinite extension of a collection of particularities \(pracayaviśeṣa\). 

378 ‘accumulation of particularity’ is a very important concept in establishing the role of viśeṣa and antyaviśeṣa in relation to the knowledge of ‘universals’ \(sāmānya\); substances which are said to be vibhū, like ‘vacuum’ and ‘soul,’ include immanently in themselves a multitude of particularities \(pracayaviśeṣa\); the concept of ‘particularity’ 

is a constitutive part of universality, and that particularity is indirectly as infinite and large as the universal is; if particularity is separate from universal, or if for example, 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 195

***7.1.15. comprehension and non-comprehension of ***

***minuteness and boundless \[dimensions\] are explained ***

***in respect to the permanence \[of things\]***

‘permanence’ is the name of a chapter; ‘that which is comprehended, that is definitely \[of a certain\] large \[size\],’ but in atoms however, there is no perception of one atom, a dyad and mind; 374 thus in the chapter called ‘nitya,’ boundless is 

called permanent \[and there\] it is told that boundless and minuteness are causes for comprehensibility and incomprehensibility, because there is a rule of what boundless375 is regarding comprehensibility; concerning triad, although it is a 

\[type\] of boundless, it is still, incomprehensible. 376

***7.1.16. boundless is the accumulation of particularities,377*** *** because ***

***the substratum has multiplicity and is unlimited378***

plurality of ‘number’ – which exists in the atomic dyad which is the cause in the atomic triad – produces the boundless due to the absence of unlimited causes;379 

in a substance of the size of 2 fingers, the size of the finger is the cause which produces \[the\] great size; 380 ‘pracaya’ \[accumulation\] means ‘loose contact’;381 

in a substance having 2 cotton balls, the accumulation of 2 lumps of cotton ball requires a ‘loose contact’ between the parts \[whereby ‘accumulation’ or ‘loose contact’\] is the substratum of their own \[parts\] which are ‘the boundless.’382

the ‘particular good’ is divorced from Common Good \(the universal\), the particular becomes finite and just as a lost entity in ‘space,’ it becomes an existential doomed to suspension, or extinction; such a particular cannot exist indefinitely without absorp-tion, because the infinity of ‘space,’ its ‘dimension,’ is related to the infinity of ‘time’; 

‘time’ and ‘space’ being interrelated concepts, it follows that their particularity would no longer reside outside ‘time,’ but rather in ‘time’; yet, the ontological status of antyaviśeṣa, as that of other eternal substances is that of being a fundamentally ‘different,’ yet immanent part of ‘time.’

379 the commentator seems to doubt that causes can form ‘boundless,’ or ‘accumulation’; cause produces effect, and once the effect perishes cause perishes too. 

380 ‘boundless’ \(mahattva\) takes shape as result of additions ranging from simple to complex, from one to many. 

381 about ‘loose contact’ see Vādīndra’s polemical passage which argues for the real 

‘nature’ \(svarūpa\) of the ‘ultimate particularities’ \(antyaviśeṣa\) VSv long version, p. 

70: ‘viśeṣeṣu sattāṅagīkāre svarupahāniprāsaṅga iti cet – na sattāyā svarūpahānyā 

saha vyāpti viraheṇa prasanṅgasya praśithilamūlatvāt; viśeṣeṣu sattāṅagīkāre viśeṣalakṣaṇa hāniḥ’; from this passage it follows that viśeṣa does not have sattā, but rather its existence is only ‘relative,’ ‘relational,’ and ‘dependent’ on something else, the substance; viśeṣa is a fuzzy concept that is very ‘loose’ \(praśithila\), and cannot exist independently. 

382 ‘accumulation’ \(pracaya\) is a key concept for understanding the dilemma between 

‘particular’ and ‘universal,’ between ultimately small \(antyaviśeṣa\) and the universal \(sāmānya\).

383 if boundless is a ‘reality’ \(the accumulation of parts\) so also the minuteness \(the many small parts that constitute great accumulation, e.g. antyaviśeṣa\) is; Vaiśeṣika sees no contradiction between one and many, between universal and particular. 

384 ‘kuvala’ \(Ziziphus mauritiana\) refers most probably to the jujube tree and its fruit, whose precise natural distribution is uncertain due to its extensive cultivation; its origin is thought to be in southern Asia \(between Lebanon, northern India, and southern and central China\). 

385 ‘āmalaka’ \(Emblica officinalis\) may refer to the gooseberry fruit, a species of ribes \(which includes currants\); it is spread in India \(where it is used in pickle\), the Caucasus, and northern Africa; it has a symbolical value in Theravada Buddhism.

***7.1.18. minute and boundless, is that in which there ***

***is both manifestation of particularity as well ***

in boundless, there are things \[contained\] which are minute in respect to the arrangement of kuvala fruit384 by comparison with āmalaka fruit; 385 but āmalaka fruit is minute in comparison with bilva fruit; 386 thus, because of the \[relative\] 

presence and absence in one and the same substance, the designation of ‘minute’ 

and ‘great’ has a relative \[metaphorical value\]; from where did \[you derive such an assertion\]? 

***7.1.19. \[for example\] the oneness of ‘time’ \[has units and oneness\]387***

since, at one and the same time, 2 men arrange the same thing to be small and large in relation to another thing, therefore we know \[the sentence\] ‘this is metaphorical’; 388 in respect to the minute \[thing\] this \[is decided\] by mutual comparison. 

***7.1.20. \[minute and boundless are proved\] also from analogy***

just as there is whiteness only in a product made of white threads, and not blackness, similarly, from this exemplification, \[we say that\] boundless is generated only from a great size, and not from minuteness. 

India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malesia as a naturalised species, and it is a tree considered sacred by Hindus. 

387 alternative translation: ‘because one and the same thing can be minute and large at the same “time”’; everything can be large and small when it is compared with the size of other things, both of which are an aspect of oneness; a small and a big thing, minuteness and largeness, can be simultaneous; but ‘time’ is not simultaneous, for as we shall see, it is a sum of units, only; it is conceived as a succession of minute points which together form the extended infinite and eternal ‘time’ which is metaphorically expressed; the main subject in this sūtra is not ‘time,’ but the fruit discussed in the previous gloss. 

388 in other words, oneness of time is to be taken ‘metaphorically.’

389 if there is absence of ‘minuteness’ and ‘boundless’ in the parts, then there is absence of ‘minuteness’ and ‘boundless’ in the ‘whole’ \(oneness\); whatever exists in parts, that is also present in the ‘whole’; Indian philosophy overcomes the Greek philosophical dilemma between parts and whole, logos-logos, addressed from very early by Anaximander. 

390 ‘has, have’ is translated when we have the bahuvrīhi compound; but when we have the tatpuruṣa compound we translate by ‘is, are’; as Professor Thite clarifies, in the Vedic texts, there are accents, and with the help of such accents one can decide whether a word is a tatpuruṣa compound or bahuvrīhi; the ‘udātta’ accent, for instance, is not shown by any marks in Sanskrit, but in the Romanised texts, it is marked with a sign of a single apostrophe; in a tatpuruṣa compound, the accent stays on the second part of the compound but in the bahuvrīhi compound the accent stays on the first part of the compound \(see Aufrecht’s edition of Rig Veda\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 199

***7.1.21. when minute and great \[things\] do not have minuteness, and ***

***boundless, \[they\] are explained by way of motions and qualities***

just as qualities and motions which are devoid of qualities due to the absence of the co-existence of oneness in qualities of parts such as ‘colour’ and so forth, in a similar manner, there is \[an\] absence of minuteness and largeness in \[the\] plurality of causes and so forth due to the absence of \[their\] inherence in the nature of 

oneness.389

***7.1.22. minuteness and boundless \[explain\] that motions ***

***and qualities have no390 \[other\] qualities***

just as because of the plurality of causes and so forth \[and\] due to the absence of co-existence in one and the same thing, there is absence of minuteness and boundless, in a similar manner the quality of motion391 is devoid of minuteness and boundless. 

***7.1.23. in this way, \[Kaṇāda\] explains shortness and lengthiness***

comprehension and non-comprehension are \[explained\] like minuteness and boundless; the lengthiness is produced from unlimited causes and so forth, shortness is \[just\] the reversal of that; therefore, this figurative usage is due to an existential particularity;392 concerning the absence of shortness and lengthiness there is an extension \[of the same rule of application\]. 

***7.1.24. motions are \[devoid of ‘x’\]393*** *** because of motions, ***

***qualities are \[devoid of ‘y’\]394*** *** because of qualities***

just as motions are devoid of minuteness and boundless due to the absence of the co-

existence of oneness in the multiplicity of causes,395 in the same way, the qualities of motions are devoid of shortness and lengthiness; these are the qualities of motions. 

391 as in the preceding gloss 7.1.21, Candrānanda speaks of karmaguṇa, or guṇakarmani; earlier we mentioned that motions do not have qualities. 

392 ‘viśeṣabhāva’ may be the ultimate existential \(antyaviśeṣa\) in the system’s theory of individuation, which ‘measures’ both the intervals as well as the sizes of things. 

393 ‘devoid’ of minuteness and boundless; this sūtra must be read in relation to 7.1.22. 

394 devoid of shortness and lengthiness; this sūtra must be read as a continuation of 7.1.22. 

395 ‘absence of the inherence of oneness in the multiplicity of causes’ indicates that inherence is a different concept from the connection between ‘units’ out of which ‘multiplicity’ is made; it may well be the case that ‘oneness’ is not one and the same concept as ‘unit.’

396 the 4 dimensions \(caturvidhaṃ parimāṇaṃ\) are ‘minuteness’ \(aṇutva\), ‘largeness’ 

\(mahattva\), ‘lengthiness’ \(dīrghatva\), and ‘shortness’ \(hrasvatva\). 

397 the gloss clarifies that shortness and lengthiness refer to the fixed dimension of things and should not be confused with other qualities such as ‘number.’

398 atoms are said to be globular \(or spherical\) but form a ‘continuum’ of a whole all-pervasive substance seen as a collection of minute entities; a comparable view that began with speculations from Aristotle’s Physics \(232b20\) was professed at Oxford in the 13th century but rejected as heretical by the Paris Condemnations in 1277. 

399 the view according to whatever is globular is eternal derived from the definition about the composition of a substance; whatever has parts \[or corners\] is dissolvable; a globular object not only cannot have parts, but also by not having corners, it cannot ‘cling’ 

to something; the view that globular things must be eternal can also be encountered in classical Greek philosophy.

***7.1.27. ignorance is the logical mark of ‘valid knowledge’400***

that \[entity\] devoid of ‘dimension,’ the manifestation of a substance devoid of dimension, is the inferential mark for the existence of an atomic ‘dimension’;

\[the\] ‘possibility’ \[of measurement\].401

***7.1.28. because of \[its\] omnipresence402 ‘vacuum’ is very large***

because of ‘conjunction,’ omnipresence is from the coming together \[and\] from 

‘disjunction’ between coagulating substances, \[thus\] ‘vacuum’ is understood to have extreme great size. 

***7.1.29. ‘soul’ is similar \[very large\]***

since ‘soul’ resembles ‘vacuum’ \[in dimension\], it should be seen as extremely great \[too\];403 the ‘space’ and ‘time’ are great also, even though they are not \[mentioned\] jointly. 

400 sūtra draws a sharp distinction between ‘ontological knowledge’ and ‘logical knowledge’; the latter is based on ‘inferential marks’ \(liṅga\) and seems to have a lesser importance than ontological knowledge. 

401 the impossibility of the existence of a substance having no measurement is the mark of the possibility \[of the measurement of the atom\]; ‘saṃbhava’ is translated with 

‘experience-perception’ because of the compound sam \(with\) \+ ‘bhāva’ \(existential\), as well as because the whole gloss refers to the epistemology of the atomic dimension; this is possible \(saṃbhava\) only in advanced forms of knowledge. 

402 there is a difference between infinity and magnitude, for Vaiśeṣika seems to differentiate between vibhava and mahat. 

403 that ‘soul’ is omnipresent is only a conjecture from VS 7.1.28–29.

404 as elsewhere in this commentary ‘bhāva’ has been translated with ‘existential’ and 

‘entity.’

405 the explanation of mind as atomic leads to another speculation \(possibly from the side of yogis\), namely that thinking is generally a successive, not simultaneous process; the argument Candrānanda puts forward is based on sheer logics; because mind is atomic, it cannot be in 2 places at the same time, nor simultaneous; these latter characteristics belong to substances that are all-pervasive \(time-space, soul, and vacuum\). 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 203

***7.1.30. but ‘mind’, because of the absence of that ***

***\[omnipresence\],404*** *** is atomic***

and due to the absence of all-pervasiveness, ‘mind’ is atomic \[in dimension\] 

which explains why it cannot cognise simultaneously. 405

***7.1.31. by means of qualities, ‘space’ is explained***

whenever one makes a limitation, there is an arrangement \[as expressed in the sentences\] ‘east \[of that\], from this to that limit,’ therefore ‘space’ is explained regarding concrete things, therefore ‘space’ is explained as possessed by largeness because the qualities are named in connection with concrete substances; therefore, 

***7.1.32. \[with space\] ‘time’ is explained by the causal \[principle\]406***

by means of a causality, which is the alternative causality between far and near 

\[time\], ‘time’ is inferred because of its existence everywhere,407 \[thus\] by such 

\[reasoning\] ‘time’ is explained as all-pervasive. 

**// the first lesson of the seventh chapter //**

**7.2. **

**//the second lesson of the seventh chapter //**

now, concerning the succession of numbering, this represents the proof for the differential arrangement of \[qualities\] ‘number’ and so forth,408 due to their separate nature from \[other\] qualities ‘colour’ and so forth, for which purpose, \[he\] says –

406 the principle of causality or ‘consequentiality’ is followed by both ‘time’ and ‘space,’ 

as well as ‘mind.’

407 time inferred from ‘existence everywhere’ shows that ‘time’ is similar to ‘space’ and has an implied spatial or locative value as well. 

408 Vaiśeṣika is a ‘philosophy of difference and particularity,’ so number plays a major role in demonstrating the differential nature of reality and its constituents.

409 pṛthaktva is one of the generic qualities of ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space’; like the categories of sāmānya and viśeṣa – being correspondent to each other – pṛthaktva \(separateness\) and ekatva \(oneness\) should be analysed in mutual correspondence. 

410 dvitva \(reduplication or separateness\) accounts for the infinite division of things belonging to the same class \(genera\), and in this respect one can say that a substance, as well as being a produced effect can be multiplied ad infinitum, remaining thus, from an ontological point of view, both one and many, both identical and separated; it is in this way that ‘soul,’ ‘time,’ and ‘space’ subsist in their abstract yet essential ontological realm. 

411 this is an important passage as it further elucidates what ‘sāmānya bhāva’ is in relation to the reality of particularity and universality, which both have an infinite extension, 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 205

***7.2.1. another category is ‘oneness,’ which like ‘distinctness,’409*** *** is ***

***a different subject-matter \[having\] a distinct nature \[other ***

***than the nature of\] ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘smell,’ ‘touch.’***

‘form-colour’ is not the cause for the conceptualisation of ‘this is the same’ 

because conceptualisation varies in character; it is true that ‘colour’ might cause the conceptualisation of \[statements like\] ‘that possesses a ‘colour’ and so forth; but this rationalisation refers to another subject-matter; ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ are qualities which precede \[each other\], such as the effects are \[preceded\] 

by causes; production is \[thus\] the cognition of many objects, due to the ‘uniqueness’ and the reduplication of ‘distinctness’; 410 similarly, due to ‘distinctness’ 

there exists \[as a result\] reduplication, however, the ‘universal’ is not something different from ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness.’411

***7.2.2. from them \[oneness and separateness\]412*** *** permanence ***

***and impermanence of ‘lustre’ are explained by ***

***\[the simile of\] ‘form-colour’ and ‘touch.’***

just as there is permanence of substance, the ‘form-colour’ and ‘touch’ of ‘lustre’-

atoms are permanent,413 similarly the oneness and ‘distinctness’ are permanent too, if they exist in eternal substances; and to give an example, when ‘lustre’ is not a permanent substance, because its touch and ‘form-colour’ are not permanent, so also the singularity of oneness and ‘distinctness’ are not permanent when they subsist in an effect-product. 414

***7.2.3. and \[likewise\] production \[is explained\]415***

for instance, the effects of lustre \[emerge\] like qualities are preceded by causes because ‘distinctness’ and oneness produce \[the experience of\] ‘touch’ and ‘form-colour’; thus is \[also the case\] with ‘weight,’ ‘fluidity,’ \[and\] ‘viscosity.’

reality, and permanence, whereby particularity being a universal as the universality, and universal being as specific as particularity. 

412 alternatively: oneness and separateness. 

413 when in Vaiśeṣika we have the mahābhūtas which are said to be impermanent, this transitory character applies only to the concrete form of mahābhūtas, however, the atoms constituting these mahābhūtas are permanent; so ultimately, substance is impermeant or eternal, even though it suffers modification and change. 

414 the impermanence refers, therefore, to the nature of the effect and products to subsist ontological change \(pīlupākavāda\). 

415 this sūtra should be read as a continuation of 7.2.2.

416 sūtra tries to avoid infinite regress, because if ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ were derived from each other, the ontological knowledge \(which usually acknowledges a substratum\) would no longer be a valid ground for demonstration. 

417 in other words, motions and qualities do not possess other qualities \(such as separateness and oneness\) for otherwise they would lead to infinite regress, and the ontological nature and definition of qualities would be lost. 

418 possibly here a refutation of a Vedānta position. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 207

***7.2.4. the absence of‘distinctness’ and ‘oneness’ in a ***

***\[another\] distinctness’ ‘and ‘oneness’ demonstrates ***

***the \[reality\] of ‘minuteness’ and ‘largeness’416***

correspondingly, there is no ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ \[in another oneness and ‘distinctness’\] due to the absence of co-existence of one and the same subject-matter in the qualities, and in the constitution of oneness and ‘distinctness’ 

\[respectively\], this is the meaning \[of this sūtra\]. 

***7.2.5. motions \[are explained\] through motions, qualities through qualities417***

likewise \[if you say that\] because of the absence of \[motions\], the qualities of motions do not have ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ inherent in one and the same object and its qualities; \[objection\] this is not so, because that is like with all categories, \[for\] oneness is when there is absence of particularity. 

***7.2.6. oneness does not exist in all things418 because ***

***qualities and motions are innumerable419***

\[if you say\] that because motions and qualities are numberless, oneness subsists in all \[categories\], then this is not so; \[but\] if you say that qualities and so forth are metaphorically one, \[then Kaṇāda says this\]

***7.2.7. if420 oneness does not exist, metaphorical ***

***existence does not exist \[either\]***

if ‘oneness’ does not exist first and foremost \[in the substance\], then that oneness will be imagined to be metaphorical in qualities, but \[to say\] that oneness suffices to be established as a real entity,421 this is simply undesirable, because the difference \[between substance and quality\] is from a different passage: ‘\[oneness\] exists first in the substances and secondarily in the qualities’; \[objection\] now, if there is oneness of cause and effect because substances are numberless, \[it follows that\] 

owing the absence of oneness only, there will be difference \[in substances\]; but this cannot be so \[because\]

419 as mentioned, ‘vacuum,’ ‘space,’ ‘time,’ and ‘soul’ are devoid of motion \(VSc 5.2.23\), and ‘soul,’ for instance, can exist in the soteriological state as deprived of specific qualities. 

420 the beginning of the sentence can be translated with the ablative \(pañcamī vibhakti\), namely ‘because,’ ‘since,’ and ‘if.’

421 ‘there will be only difference’ \(between oneness of substances and oneness of qualities\).

422 ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ do not characterise perishable effect-products; they seem to characterise essences, and substances that have a permanent nature, however abstract these may be; thus, we may say giving that ‘time-space’ and ‘soul’ possess 

‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness,’ they possess as a result an all-pervasive nature that can show them to be one and many at the same time. 

423 ‘causality’ and ‘substance’ are the most fundamental philosophical concepts in Vaiśeṣika. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 209

***7.2.8. if there is no oneness and ‘distinctness’ in cause and effect, ***

***there is no ‘oneness’ and ‘distinctness’ \[separately either\]***

because of the dichotomy of cause and effect, there is no oneness of effect \[product\] and there is no ‘distinctness’ either, due to the absence of substratum other than the cause. 422

***7.2.9. this has been explained in regard to both ***

***permanence and impermanence***

although the subject-matter of the previous sūtra is the impermanent thing, this should be understood as explained in regard to permanent \[substances\] such as 

‘vacuum’ and so forth, in accordance with the potentiality \[of its existence\]; for example, between ‘vacuum’ and ‘sound,’ which are cause and effect, there is neither oneness nor ‘distinctness.’

***7.2.10. ‘conjunction’ is produced from one of the motions, ***

***both motions, and from a ‘conjunction’***

‘conjunction’ is produced from the motion of 1 of the 2 \[entities\]: the falcon’s activity of approaching a pillar; \[or\] when 2 wrestlers come together \[for a fight\]; 

‘conjunction’ is produced from \[either\] the 2 causes, \[or\] derived from a relation between an effect with non-effect,423 as for instance, when there is ‘conjunction’ 

of 2 fingers with the ‘vacuum-space’424 because of the 2 fingers’ ‘conjunctions’ 

with ‘vacuum.’

***7.2.11. in this way ‘disjunction’425*** *** is explained***

‘disjunction’ is produced from the motions of the 2 \[entities\]: that of a falcon when takes off \[from the pillar\]; \[‘disjunction’\] is produced from both motions of sheep departing \[from each other\]; but \[the ‘disjunction’\] produced from separation takes place when \[for instance\] 2 fingers are separated from each other 

\[or\] when the ‘vacuum-space’ between 2 fingers is obliterated, \[and\] there is a separation of the space between 2 fingers, through either cause or non-cause, for example, from the separation of the vacuum in hand there is separation of body-

fingers in ‘vacuum.’426

424 ākāśa \(elsewhere translated as ‘vacuum’\) should not be confused with ‘space’ \(diś\), elsewhere translated as ‘direction.’

425 as in other glosses, we have translated ‘vibhāga’ as ‘separation’ and ‘disjunction’ 

interchangeably. 

426 VSc 7.2.11 contains 3 types of ‘disjunction’: when a thing goes away; when both things separate; and when there is a ‘disjunction’ there is another ‘disjunction.’

427 as with other glosses, here ‘saṃyoga’ has been translated as ‘contact’ and conjunction’ interchangeably. 

428 ‘largeness’ which is a form of universal is explained as not having ‘disjunction.’

429 the sūtra is translated negatively by Ganesh Thite: ‘motions have no motions; qualities have no qualities.’

430 Thite says that effect can exist without cause, after the cause disappears; the sūtra aims to prove the independent ontological reality of ‘contact’ and ‘separation’ without appealing to logical inference. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 211

***7.2.12. absence of ‘conjunction’427*** *** and ‘disjunction’ in ***

***\[another\] ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are ***

***explained by minuteness and boundless428***

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is not that the condition of these 2 exist because of an absence of combinations. 

***7.2.13. motions are \[explained\] by motions, qualities by qualities429***

the meaning of this sūtra is this: because there is absence of combination, these 

\[motions and qualities\] do not have ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’

***7.2.14. ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of cause and effect ***

***do not exist when there is no combination430***

the mutuality of ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ of cause and effect does not exist as in, for instance, between pot and potsherds, because of the absence of a pre-established combination; \[a\] pre-established combination means to have a separate moment of both, or one of the two, and that \[separate moment\] exists inherent in the combined permanent substances as well as impermanent substances, as, for instance, between a pot and cloth \[on the one hand\], and in the touch of the skin with earthly bodies \[on the other hand\]; there is no co-existence in the combination of pot and potsherds without inherence with the substratum, because pot is indeed inherent in these \[potsherds\];431 if you say that there is an \[inherent\] rela-

tion between word and meaning, then \[the answer is\] no,432

***7.2.15. because \[sound\] is a quality \[of vacuum\]433***

sound is not eternally joined with meaning, because it is \[only\] a quality of 

‘vacuum.’

431 the gloss refers to the difference between yutasiddha and samavāya; it is a clear distinction between a combination of entities, and inherence between 2 concepts; see the saṃyoga and samavāya distinction. 

432 Vaiśeṣika does not approve of the view according to which ‘meaning’ is intimately attached to the sound-word, for it wishes to stick to its own asatkāryavāda theory that words are ‘new’ and therefore language is always conventional not eternal, or pre-existent as the Mīmāṃsākas would acknowledge. 

433 quality has no relation of combination with the substance; it can only inhere; ‘qualitiness’ \(guṇatva\) – which is used in the sūtra – is the state of having a quality, not only of being a quality.

434 for a reminder of the list of qualities, see VSc 1.1.5. 

435 once again, there is a difference between prayujate \(to set in movement\) and saṃbandha \(connection\); this gloss tells us about the relationship between motion and qualities. 

436 the previous gloss 7.2.14 speaks of a prayujate \(plunging\) with motions and effects, but this sūtra seems to contradict it. 

437 the system reaffirms its commitment to realism; real connections cannot be made with mere concepts or to non-extant things; saṃyoga – the term used here – is referring only to the relation between real existentials. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 213

***7.2.16. and about quality \[and its relation\] that has been explained***

regarding quality, ‘form-colour,’ ‘taste,’ and so forth434 \[these\] are connected with the effect-activities too, but there is no \[intimate\] bond of qualities and motions 

with \[such\] quality.435

***7.2.17. and because \[qualities\] are devoid of activity436***

if there were ‘conjunction’ between ‘word’ with ‘meaning,’ sound would reach the meaning, \[but\] since meaning is inactive, the quality \[sound\] cannot move 

\[either\]. 

***7.2.18. because of the expression ‘does not exist,’ ***

***\[sound\] does not subsists \[in vacuum\]***

if there were a ‘conjunction’ between ‘sound’ and ‘meaning,’ then the word would not be used with regard to ‘asat’ \[non-extant\] in \[sentences such as\] ‘nāsti’ \[for\] 

there cannot be any ‘conjunction’ with ‘asat’ \[non-extant\]; 437 therefore, it is \[so\] 

because of the absence of ‘conjunction’ \[between sound and meaning\] -

***7.2.19. ‘sound’ and meaning do not subsist \[in each other\]438***

and now \[the counter-objection is the following\]439

***7.2.20. \[due to the relation\] of a stick which is in ‘conjunction,’ ***

***and due to the horn inherent \[in the animal\]***

stick and horn which are in ‘conjunction’ or inherent with both the possessor of stick and the possessor of horn, 440 this is visibly experienced; there is knowledge of meaning from sound, therefore, there must also be a contact with it \[meaning\]; 

\[response\] this is not so, 

438 ‘artha’ within Vaiśeṣika’s realistic framework refers to ‘object’ and ‘meaning’ as well. 

439 there is no gloss offered here by Candrānanda, and for the same sūtra Vādīndra glosses this only: ‘tasmād iti śeṣaḥ’ \(‘therefore this the remaining part’ may indicate that the commentator drew a final conclusion here, namely that language is not eternal, but only conventional, as the sūtra settled it\). 

440 this is an objection contrary to Vaiśeṣika’s theory of language that does not see an intimate relation between ‘meaning’ and ‘sound.’

441 a question should be asked as to whether saṃbandha in Vaiśeṣika is a real ontological relation or a logico-inferential one. 

442 the nature of language in Vaiśeṣika is radically different from the Mīmāṃsā’s; language is ‘conventional’ or artificial, that is to say, can be created by humans through new conventions. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 215

***7.2.21. conceptualisation cannot be a condition ***

***\[derived\] from visibility \[only\]441***

impurity is that because of which there is the imperceptibility of the contact between the possessor of a stick and a possessor of horn; but if the contact \[between sound and meaning\] is imperceptible as already said, then the conceptualisation of meaning will not be made through contact \[between sound and meaning\]. 

***7.2.22. similarly, the absence of its conceptualisation \[is ***

***not a cause of the knowledge of meaning\]***

if there were a contact between meaning and word, then one who has not known the convention442 \[between them\] would understand the meaning from this \[word\]; 

***7.2.23. when you say that there is doubt because of the ***

***connection \[of vacuum\] with the connected \[sound\]***

\[objection\] now ‘vacuum’ is connected with ‘sound,’ and meaning \[is connected\] 

with ‘vacuum,’443 thus, due to the connection with the connected there is a subsistence with meaning; \[response\] this is not so, because all meanings are connected with ‘vacuum,’ there will be doubt regarding which meaning the word is used for, and there will be no knowledge; therefore, there is no subsistence \[between meaning and ‘vacuum’\], therefore –

***7.2.24. conceptualisation of meaning is because ***

***the meaning is conventional***

therefore, the conceptualisation is not because of a connection between meaning 

and word, \[but rather is caused\] by convention444

443 This could be Mīmāṃsākas’ objection according to which meaning and word are eternal, being, as it were, connected with ākāśa. 

444 The nature of word and meaning is thus not eternal as Mīmāṃsā maintains, but a convention settled by rules \(e.g. by grammarians such as Pāṇini\); in this respect, language, truth, and knowledge itself are ‘compositional’; the convention of words, as āhnika 6.2. made clear, is through the act of naming, by ṛṣis or God.

445 On ‘buddhyapekṣam,’ see VSc 1.2.3 in conjunction with vyāvṛttibuddhi a specific cognitive function that has access to grasping the differentiated nature of things, VSc 1.2.6; namely to perceive things in their ultimate differentness; as Candrānanda says this type of cognition is produced in those seers \(tad darśināṁ\) who can draw such minute differentiations about the ultimate particularities, specifically about those things that have an indistinguishable shape and quality \(vartamānāstulyākṛtiguṇeṣu\). 

See ārṣajñāna VSc 9.28. 

446 to be ‘dependent on cognition’ means that cognition mediated by the atomic mind distinguishes between pairs of opposite ontological categories, as well as in successive units, which follow one another. If there is something that defines the original 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 217

***7.2.25. ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ exist because of nearness and ***

***remoteness in relation to both ‘time’ and ‘space’***

when there are 2 balls having 1 direction, then ‘space-direction’ is the cause of their ‘near’ and ‘distant’ \[position in space and time\]; 2 things belonging to the same ‘time’ and connected with the present \[tense\] become \[the\] cause of 

‘remoteness’ and ‘proximity’ caused by ‘time’; and \[the illusion\] of these 2 balls is caused by and is dependent upon the ‘cognition’445 of nearness and remoteness. 

***7.2.26. because of the remoteness of cause and ***

***because of the nearness of cause***

‘conjunction’ between the remote and near location is a non-inherent cause; in a similar way, there is ‘conjunction’ of remote-and-near-‘space’ and posterior-and-prior-‘time’; due to the ‘conjunction’ between the near and distant balls with location in ‘time,’ there is near and nearness, and because there is remote there will be remoteness \[which notions\] are dependent upon a cognition of \[the concept\] near 

and the distant.446

***7.2.27. minuteness and largeness are explained because ***

***of the absence of the prior and posterior of ***

***proximity and remoteness \[of existentials\]447***

the cause of ‘proximity’ and ‘remoteness’ \[is established\] by the connections between prior and posterior \[things\] located in ‘space’ and ‘time’; and concerning these 2 things, because there is no intimate relation and because there is no ‘conjunction,’ \[then\] there is no \[concept of\] prior and posterior \[either\]. 

***7.2.28. motions are \[explained\] by means of motions, ***

***qualities are \[explained\] by means of qualities***

just as ‘motion’ and ‘quality’448 are devoid of minuteness and boundless, so also 

‘motion’ and ‘quality’ are devoid of ‘consequence’ and ‘non-consequence’ due to the absence of a ‘conjunction’ with the location in ‘time’ \[and\] ‘space’ of the 

‘existential’ \(bhāva\) with which \[conjunction\] is associated. 

mentality of the Vaiśeṣika system, then it is precisely this kind of reasoning: dualistic epistemology in a successive expanded pluralistic world. That is not to say that synchronic and intuitive thinking is missing in this system; successive reasoning defines the normal perception, while simultaneous, synchronic, and intuitive thinking define the ‘supernatural’ forms of knowledge such as ‘ārṣajñāna’ mentioned in VSc 9.28. 

447 ‘existentials’ are not explicitly mentioned here; Vaiśeṣika students need familiarisa-tion not only with the odd Sanskrit syntax but also with the style of this darśana as well. 

448 ‘karmaguṇa’ has been translated here not as a compound as it elsewhere in this commentary, but rather as 2 different nouns.

449 inherence of ‘particularity’ in ‘universality’ is a doctrine that explains the web of interrelations that exists in the worldview of this system; there are no longer enigmas, or contradictions between particular and universal; the interrelatedness of the two is something that has been developed in other Middle Eastern traditions too \(Hebrew, Syriac, Islamic Sufi\). 

450 ‘inherence’ explains that ‘real’ or ‘existential’ \(bhava\) is something other than the real categories of substance, quality, and motion, because reality is something that 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 219

***7.2.29. cause-effect inherence is when ‘that \[is ***

***conceptualised\] here’ \[‘hic et nunc’\]***

qualities and so forth are inherent in substance; therefore \[Kaṇāda\] explains inherence as follows: it is that because of which there is conceptualisation of a cause-effect \[relation\] produced \[as expressed in the sentences\] ‘here in the threads there is cloth, here in the pot there is colour and so forth, here in the pot there is motion,’ 

this is co-existence; the knowledge of cause-effect is only indicative \[in the sentences\] ‘there is co-existence of generality in individuality, \[and co-existence\] of particularities in permanent substances,’449 this is how \[inherence\] has been stated. 

***7.2.30. obstruction between substantiality, qualitiness, and ***

***motionness is explained by existentiality450***

just as ‘substance’ is not one and the same \[existential\] with ‘substantiality,’ 

because it subsists in quality and motion and is not a real \[to be confused with\] 

motion and quality, so also ‘inherence’ is \[explained\]. 451

***7.2.31. also, that \[inherence\]452 is suchness***

just as the reality of oneness is because of non-particularity \[of visible marks\],453 

similarly, there is one inherence without specific marks as regard the \[experience of\] ‘hic et nunc’454 which is devoid of re-occurrence, has no parts, and is permanent. 

**// this is the seventh chapter //**

defines all 3 categories; see also VS 1.1.14 and other essential sūtra on reality, sattā, and bhāva. 

451 ‘inherence’ \(samavāya\) is defined as a real independent category. 

452 see sūtra 7.2.29. 

453 oneness and universality are coextensive with the sādharmyic cognition; it focuses on simplicity of the abstract substances and entities in general. 

454 ‘hic et nunc’ type of experience may be a form of intuition that ultimately leads to the knowledge of ‘tattva,’ which in certain contexts has been translated with ‘essence.’

455 likewise, VSc 1.1.6, Candrānanda re-confirms that the categories are 6 \(not 7 as in later Vaiśeṣika, for instance in Śivāditya’s Saptapadārthī which adds ‘abhāva’ as the seventh padārtha \[SP 3\]\). This shows that Candrānanda’s commentary is a more traditional and faithful rendering of the original tenets of the system. 

456 ‘substance’ \(dravya\) is the most important category in Vaiśeṣika, a system that we could define to be an example of ‘substantialist philosophy’; sūtra 8.4 overempha-sises this view by saying that: ‘substance is the cause, and the cause of causes,’ which means that substance is the ‘ultimate reality,’ or the ‘essence’ of reality \(sattā\); what is aimed at by this system is an ‘essential knowledge,’ and the nature of substance is the ultimate form of such knowledge; to understand it better, one should consider reading Vaiśeṣika in contradistinction to Buddhist schools such as Mādhyamikā.

**/ the eighth chapter /**

now ‘cognition’ is explained

***8.1. knowledge is explained in regard to substances***

among the 6 categories, 455 knowledge is explained only in relation to substances,456 

and perception is that which produces it, yet, \[perception\] is not for the sake of qualities and so forth \[but rather for the sake of substances\]; 457 of these \[he says\]. 

***8.2. and ‘soul’ and ‘mind’ \[is the cause of knowledge\]***

causation of knowledge \[its production\] is explained as \[between\] ‘mind’ and 

‘soul’; now \[he\] says \[something\] regarding the knowledge in relation to qualities, and so forth. 

***8.3. it is said that production of knowledge is the ***

***indication of a detailed knowledge458***

because it has been said that the production of knowledge is \[made\] by the close contact with senses, qualities, and so forth, being not in contact with \[these\] 

senses, therefore, knowledge is now said \[to exist\] in relation to that \[knowledge 

by\] distant contact between these, that is \[by\] discernment,459 because, –

457 ‘cognition’ refers to the ultimate form of knowledge, such as yogipratyakṣa, which targets the comprehension of the ultimate essences of substances, in relation to which qualities are secondary as they do not represent the main project of Vaiśeṣika’s epistemology; perception does not stop at the surface of things \(qualities\), it aims rather at the knowledge of substances and their essences. 

458 ‘knowledge’ is real because being an effect, and given the theory of asatkāryavāda, all effects are ‘real new things.’

459 vijñāna is a higher form of knowledge, perhaps that which relies on vaidharmya, see also parijñāna in VSc 1.1.6.

460 there seem to be qualitative levels of perception; the basic one is the perception by senses, a more superior one however is ‘discernment,’ which grasps entities and their essences through a form of supra-sense perception \(atīndriya\). 

461 on antyaviśeṣa, see VSc 1.2.6. 

462 sāmānya and viśeṣa do not subsist in another sāmānya and viśeṣa, for otherwise the proof will fall into infinite regression. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 223

***8.4. when qualities and motions are not near \[our senses\] ***

***we say that substance is the cause for the production ***

***of \[our\] knowledge, and the cause of causes***

because substance is the inherent cause of qualities and motions, then in relation to these, there is production of discernment with the sense-organs which are in direct contact with the perception which is the cause \[of that discernment\],460 

and neither substance nor quality nor motion are the cause \[of that perceptive contact\] therefore, the knowledge of qualities and motions is produced from the co-existence with the contacted \[thing\], and the word ‘ca’ \[in the sūtra\] is used in the sense of cause \[of knowledge\]. 

***8.5. because of the absence of the ‘universal’ and ‘particularity’ ***

***in universality and particularity, from that, only, we know ***

***the knowledge \[concerning the ‘universal particularity’\]***

‘sattā’ is first and foremost a universal, regarding the ‘particularities’ and ‘ultimate particularity,’461 those \[seers\] who perceive them, the production of the knowledge \[about them\] is solely by contact with the substance-essence, and not because of \[another\] universal and particularity for these are absent in them \[universal and particularity\]; 462 but as regards the other concept \[‘universal particularity’\] \[Kaṇāda says\]

***8.6. concerning substance, quality, and motion \[the knowledge ***

***of these\] is dependent on ‘universal particularity’463***

substance, quality, motion \[are known\] because of the power of the sense-perception with substances, and because of the universal particularity and so forth, which \[like any real\] has a beginning464 \[and\] which has both particularity and universality, such as the substance and so forth have, this is how knowledge is produced; in this sūtra, ‘sattā’ is universal \[sāmānya\], ‘viśeṣa’ means existential-substantiality and so forth, \[but\] in an earlier sūtra it is \[explained\] differently; 

\[knowledge\] in relation to substance is based upon substance, quality, and motion, moreover, 

463 because sūtra does not contain the particle ‘ca,’ we take the view that Kaṇāda refers here to a third concept, namely ‘sāmānyaviśeṣa’ \(universal particularity\) which is the 

‘real’ contained by both ontological levels, viśeṣa as well as sāmānya; it is chiefly due to this concept that a substance is explained as both one and many. 

464 ‘universal’ is created when the substance is created, meaning that it exists prior to the origination of the differentiated state of substance.

465 it shows that dravya could be better translated by ‘essence’ so as to be differentiated from substance, quality, and motion. 

466 the prevalence and importance of the meaning ‘dravya’ has already been asserted as the basis on which the whole structure of reality is built, followed by ‘lesser’ categories such as ‘qualities’ and ‘motions’; the use of ‘dravyapekṣam’ \(dependent on the substance\) is a case in point. 

467 a more literal translation would be: substances are ‘comprehended prior’ to adjectives; needless to say, that the goal of the system is to grasp the ultimate reality and essence of things which is to be found in the concept of ‘dravya.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 225

***8.7. \[knowledge\] concerning substance465*** *** is based ***

***upon substance, quality, and motion***

knowledge of substance is due to the contact with \[the\] eye, \[and\] is dependent on ‘universality’ and ‘particularity’466 as for example \[in the sentence\] ‘\[something\] possessing horns is dependent on a quality for example “white,” which is equally dependent on the motion “goes,”’ in this way \[knowledge\] is produced; substances and so forth are comprehended first because of the adjective,467 by this, the cognition of adjective \[qualifier\] which is an effect, is conducive to the cognition of the qualified \[thing\]. 

***8.8. because there is absence of quality and motion in ***

***\[other\] qualities and motions, \[knowledge\] is not ***

***dependent on \[subsequent\] qualities and motions***

since there is absence of qualities and motions in \[other\] qualities and motions, there is no possibility for the knowledge of qualities and motions to be the instrumental \[cause\] of \[the knowledge\] of \[other\] qualities and motions; there is a rule concerning the prior production of the knowledge of substances; 468 as for 

example –

***8.9. knowledge of white is from whiteness, which is inherent ***

***\[in white\], because of the ‘cognition’ of whiteness, there is ***

***‘cognition’ of white \[thing\], these are cause-effect existentials***

because the universal white is inherent in the ‘quality white’ and from the knowledge of the ‘universality of white’ the cognition of the quality of whiteness is 

\[subsequently\] generated, it should also be considered that there is a connection between universal and quality; 469therefore, the cognition of the adjective is the cause, \[while\] the cognition of the qualified is the effect; but regarding the absence of the adjective \[specifier\] and the specified \[thing\] \[Kaṇāda says\] –

468 it may refer to the intuitive perception that is not mediated by inference; as we shall see, in later Vaiśeṣika literature there is direct and indirect perception; for instance, Vādīndra’s VSv gloss on 3.1.20 \(short version p. 37\) differentiates between ‘indeterminate’ \(nirvikalpapratyakṣa\) versus ‘determinate’ \(savikalpapratyakṣa\); see also Candrānanda’s VSc 9.28 which distinguishes between siddhadarśana and ārṣajñāna, whereas PD of Praśastapāda \(pp. 186\) talks about a ‘simple perception’ 

\(svarūpālocanamātra\) as opposed to ‘differentiated perception’ \(savikalpa\). 

469 on the connection between sāmānya and guṇa, see the chapter on guṇa in Halbfass 1992: 113–37.

***8.10. if there is no mutual causality among substances, ***

***there is no simultaneity of their cause \[either\]470***

because of the minuteness of ‘mind,’ and because of the absence of \[its\] simultaneity, although there is a sequence \[of cognitions\], still, there is no cause-effect relationship between cognitions of pot and cloth, because there is no link between a specifier and specified. 

***8.11. similarly, regarding substances, qualities, and motions ***

***\[these do not stand in a cause-effect relation\] due ***

***the absence of \[their own\] specific cause***

even though, in \[the sentence\] ‘the white cow goes’ the cognitions of substance, quality, \[and\] motion are being produced in a sequence, still, there is \[an\] absence of \[a\] cause-effect relationship because of the absence \[of a relation\] between a specifier and the specified thing, this reasoning, as stated earlier, is \[applicable\] 

without any difference; therefore, the cognition of substance is not the cause of the cognition of quality and motion, nor is the cognition of quality and motion a cause of another \[thing\]; however, regarding the absence of \[the rule concerning\] 

the adjectival specifier \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***8.12. ‘this one is this,’ ‘you have done,’ ‘feed him,’ \[all ***

***these rules\] are dependent on ‘cognition’***

‘ayam’ indicates \[something\] which is near, and ‘eṣaḥ’ is the perception of something \[slightly\] remote, ‘kṛtam tvayā’ indicates the experience of the doer and doing-activity, ‘bhojayainam’ indicates subject and object \[relation\]; the conceptualisation of the remote \[thing\] is dependent on that of the near \[thing\],471 in the word ‘kṛtam’ there is knowledge concerning a subject dependent on object, in the sentence ‘bhojaya’ there is knowledge concerning the object dependent on a subject; if the \[question is as to\] why there is a relation of dependence, \[then Kaṇāda says this\]

471 as in many instances, aṇutva, mahattva, permanence and impermanence, proximity and remoteness, these dual concepts mutually imply each other in Vaiśeṣika logic and epistemology, whereby one point of reference implies another; the system is a dualistic epistemology in a pluralistic ontology.

***8.13. \[cognition is possible\] regarding visible \[things\] ***

***due to their existentiality, \[and cognition of\] unseen ***

***things is due to their non-existentiality***

as far as a visible thing is concerned, there are cognitions of remoteness and so forth in things which are near and so forth, but in relation to unseen things, however, although they are dependent, they are not cause and effect because there is no jointness between a ‘specified’ and ‘specifier’;472 while the cognitions are 

dependent on objects and sense-organs, now, the object is being described –

***8.14. \[word\] ‘artha’473 is used in regard to ***

***substance, quality, \[and\] motion***

even if the universal lacks any object \[to be known\], the word ‘artha’ is fully explained after having been established only in regard to the 3 categories, substance, and so forth;474 where \[is it that established\]? just as the universal and particular are devoid of other universality, so also regarding the reality of the universal of things and so forth, these are \[indicated\] by the knowledge \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘universal is from being universal,’ similarly, particularity being another ‘existential’ \[is expressed in the sentence\] ‘particularity is from particularity,’ and this is the discernment of those seers; in the same way, in the word substance, and so forth, the word ‘artha’ is used in a technical sense, even if 

\[substance, and so forth\] are not the subject of discussion; sense-organs are also described, and they are not \[to be confused with\] the group of 5 \[mahābhūtas\] 

because –

***8.15. regarding the substances, they are \[tied up\] ***

***with the nature of the five-fold group475***

because things at their inception are known not to have the 5 great elements \[as their cause\], but the 4 elements are those which generate their own genera, in the same way, the sense-organs have their function fixed \[to their specific\] ele-

ments;476 thus, \[he\] says –

475 the group of 5 refers to the 5 mahābhūtas. 

476 the gloss seems to discuss the levels of supervenience of the evolution of the cosmos, first substances \(essences\), second mahābhūtas \(elements\), and then the senses that correspond to each of the elements \(e.g. one particular sense is for ‘earth,’ another sense is for ‘water,’ and so forth\); the next sūtra, by using the ablative \(pañcamī vibhakti\), explains how these senses are ‘attached’ or ‘fixed’ to each element.

**// aṣṭamo’dhyāyaḥ //**

477 bhūyastva is ‘abundance, plentifulness, majority, preponderance’ in \(Apte dict.: 1204\). 

478 like Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivāda’s ontology, Vaiśeṣika draws an ontological distinction between the ‘function of senses’ \(e.g. smelling\), ‘senses’ as such \(e.g. nose-smell\), and the ‘objects of senses’ \(e.g. earth\). 

479 once again, the category of viśeṣa comes into play, without which the real ontological distinction between ‘functions’ of smelling, ‘sense-organs’ of smelling, ‘qualities,’ and ‘substances’ cannot be conceived; such differentiations would be ultimately known by a sub-category known by the label of ‘dharmaviśeṣa.’

480 ‘vacuum exists independently’ means that it is not an inherent cause as is the case with ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air,’ which are the inherent cause for taste, eye, and touch, respectively. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 231

***8.16. ‘earth’ is known when there is comprehension ***

***of ‘smell,’ due to \[its\] density477***

knowledge of smell \[of ‘earth’\] by smelling is caused by ‘earth’ when it is produced due to the density which is \[judged\] interdependently with the body; and having density, the smell of ‘earth’ is not comprehended by \[other organs\], leg and so forth; and being possessed by smell, and since smelling is inherent in it 

\[‘earth’\], the sense-organ of smell indicates the smell \[of earth\]; and this earth, having smell, is itself the cause; however, the other elements are connected \[with 

this\] only to a little extent.478

***8.17. similarly, there is knowledge of ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ and ***

***‘touch,’ as regards ‘water,’ ‘lustre,’ and ‘air’ due to ***

***the particular479*** *** ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ \[and\] ‘touch’***

by means of ‘form-colour’ we have the shining, by means of ‘taste’ we have the sweet which is inherent \[in the cake offering\] and it is not harnessed by the \[cooking process\], by means of ‘touch’ we have that which is cold, hot, and not-cooked, tongue, eye, and touch-organ \[of skin\] these indicate ‘taste,’ ‘form,’ \[and\] ‘touch,’ 

therefore due to tastiness, shape, \[and\] touchiness, due to the causes which are non-affected by other elements, and because of their amplitude in relation to the 3 sense-organs, therefore, ‘water,’ ‘lustre, \[and\]’ ‘air’ are to be considered as inherent causes; but, as regards ‘vacuum’ this exists independently, 480 \[for\] 

hearing is characterised by the cavity of the ear \[vacuum\], not by the lobe of the 

ear,481 because \[the lobe\] is not the root element \[to be perceived\] and \[hearing\] 

does not originate in the ear-organ \[but in ‘vacuum’\]; 482 thus, perception has been explained. 

**// the eighth chapter //**

481 the gloss renders explicit the importance of the knowledge of the essence of the substances in their very subtle nature \(antyaviśeṣa, dharmaviśeṣa\); when it is said that 

‘hearing is characterised by the cavity of the ear’ the commentator must refer to the empty ‘space’ which is the substance ‘vacuum’; in other words, the essence of sound and hearing is ‘vacuum.’

482 śabda which stands for ‘sound’ and ‘word’ is therefore explained as a quality of the substance ‘vacuum,’ therefore, its origin should be sought not in an instrumental cause \(ear\) but rather in its ultimate cause which is the substance ‘vacuum’; the earlier ontological distinction between ‘functions’ of senses, organs of ‘senses,’ and ‘object’ 

of senses, finds its utility here, namely by detecting the substance that is the ‘root-cause’ of any sense-perceptive manifestation.

483 for an alternative translation of VSc 9.1–12, see Halbfass 1992: 242–6. 

484 ‘asat’ may be taken to be the ‘undifferentiated’ entity that pre-exists in the cosmos; Upaniṣadic dialogue between the master Uddālaka Āruṇi and his son Śvetaketu \(Ch. 

Up. 6.2.1\) who discuss whether in the beginning of the world the ‘real’ thing \(sat\) exists in an ‘undifferentiated,’ ‘non-phenomenal’ state \(asat\). I think the whole discussion of ‘asat’ is about what can be conceptualised or non-conceptualised through language, not about what exists or not. 

485 allusion is made here to asatkāryavāda theory. 

486 as in other instances, like cognition, the alternative appearance and disappearance of cognition proves the function and existence of ‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

487 in other words, ‘real’ does not exist prior to its production, by which the gloss reaffirms the Vaiśeṣika theory of asatkāryavāda; if, however, ‘asat’ is taken – as mentioned in an earlier footnote – to be that which is not conceptualised \(not necessarily

**/ the ninth chapter /**

in order to elucidate inference, \[Kaṇāda\] shows now its object \[of application\]483

***9.1. non-real484*** *** is \[that\] which has no activity, quality, \[and\] designation***

effect is not grasped by direct perception before its prior production; 485 nor through 

inference due to its transformation when there is a mark of it, and when there is absence of an \[inferential\] mark, there is non-comprehension of activities and qualities, 486 and it is indicated by the word ‘vyapadeśa’ \[designation\] that there is 

\[1\] mark and not another mark; therefore, the un-real \[asat\] is prior to its \[present\] 

existence; 487 afterwards \[Kaṇāda says\]

***9.2. \[effect is understood in relation to\] real \[and\]488 un-real***

and the ‘un-real’ is like the ‘real’ effect-product which is destroyed at a subsequent time, \[and\] there is no termination of the ‘real’ due to the absence of designation of quality and activity; but concerning their inter-relation \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***9.3. ‘asat’ is different from ‘sat’ because it has ***

***no designation, quality, and activity***

because of the termination of the ‘real’489 prior to \[another\] production, 490 the 

‘real’ thing is a different subject-matter from the ‘non-real’ produced at a subsequent time due to its prior termination, \[and real is different from non-real\] 

because of the existence of designation, quality and activity. 

that which does not exist\), then asatkāryavāda may be another form of asatkāryavāda, for it does not radically deny the existence of an effect, but perhaps only its manifestation; on how asatkāryavāda could ‘with the appropriate clarification and adjustment be easily called satkāryavāda,’ see Halbfass 1992: 58. 

488 instead of ‘is,’ Halbfass reads this sūtra with ‘becomes’ 1992: 243. 

489 real’s termination refers to the ‘non-existence of real effect’ prior to its actual birth. 

490 it is debatable if ‘termination’ refers here to the cessation of something, or just to the 

‘complete absence’ of something; does ‘unreal’ mean something completely ‘non-existent’ or it is just something ‘dormant’ or ‘un-manifested’? Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2. seems to be ambiguous about the nature of ‘sat’ and ‘asat’; should we read it in terms of absence versus the presence of a thing, actuality versus potentiality, or rather manifestation versus un-manifested thing?

491 sūtra designates how the system can maintain 2 kinds of argument as well as 2 kinds of reality; one should not confuse the concept of ‘reality’ with ‘existence’; see Vādīndra who discusses how a thing can be ‘real’ and ‘non-existent’ at the same ‘time’; in this gloss, Candrānanda seems to agree with Vādīndra who maintains that the ‘non-existing real’ refers to the real that cannot exist independently because its ‘nature’ 

\(svarūpa\), stands on very flimsy foundations, that is to say, it has a quasi-inexistent substratum; for example, the substratum of antyaviśeṣa is the substance. 

492 sūtra expresses here the ‘argument of difference,’ which is grounded upon inferential logic more than on a realistic ontological basis. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 235

***9.4. and the ‘real’ \[thing can also be\] ‘unreal’***

‘real’ thing also can be ‘unreal’ by excluding another existential, just as a bull is not a horse because of not doing \[horse\] activity, that is not a bull for it does not 

bear, therefore it is metaphorically called a ‘non-real’ \[thing\].491

***9.5. that which is ‘real’ \[demonstrated\] from that which is ***

***different, that also \[demonstrates\] ‘non-real’ as well492***

and ‘real’ is that which has a form completely absent in another thing, a subject-matter such as hare’s horn and so forth, which are a priori absent, metaphorically, and which is not \[the subject-matter\] of absence after destruction, such as hare’s horn which is ‘non-real’ as well; since ‘non-real’ \[things\] are a priori indistinct,493 

and since \[there is a doubt\] regarding the propensity of an agent not in someone else, then the reply\] is no, because there is conceptualisation of difference;494 \[and\] 

concerning that \[Kaṇāda says\] –

***9.6. knowledge of the non-real is because of the absence of the ***

***perception of a \[real\] entity, as well as because of the memory of ***

***that entity, and because of the perception of \[something\] opposite495***

knowledge concerning ‘asat’ is after seeing the dissolution of the thing that passed as in the \[expression\] ‘earlier’ \[indicated\] because \[it\] is not visible now, and because of the memory of the past thing \[and\] from having grasped the potsherds which are contrary and different; \[the non-real\] is produced after having imagined 

\[its\] destruction, for otherwise, how would that be perceived if its nature were not differentiated? 496 but regarding the prior absence, \[he\] says –

493 ‘a priori indistinct’ does not necessarily mean prior ‘non-existence,’ it means that 

‘asat’ should be only seen as ‘undifferentiated,’ ‘undistinguished.’

494 the ‘argument of difference’ mentioned in the previous footnote acquires a new explanation: the ‘grasping of difference’ is possible due to 2 factors: ontological, by the individuating factor \(antyaviśeṣa\), and the other epistemological \(dharmaviśeṣa\), which is the sense-data that the perceiver perceives directly through senses, with yogipratyakṣa. 

495 on ‘virodha,’ see probans in VSc 3.1.8. 

496 ‘perception of difference’ is possible because things are unique each time they are produced and each time they are destroyed.

***9.7. similarly, there is the perceptibility of an un-real ‘existential’497***

regarding the prior non-existence of a lump of clay there is ‘perceptual cognition’ of a pot-object at the time of \[its\] prior existence, but now the ‘cognition’ 

of a pot-object of the thing that came forth is contradictory \[because\] the state of the potsherd is remembered, therefore this co-produced existential was certainly previously non-existent, and the firm ‘cognition’ is that which refers to ‘asat’ as regards the prior non-existence of that ‘asat.’

***9.8. by means of this ‘a-ghaṭa’ \[non-pot\], ‘a-ga’ \[non-***

***bull\], ‘a-dharma’ \[non-dharma\] are explained***

when indeed a perfect perception of ‘the pot of a pan’ is produced in relation to the discernment resulted from \[the fact of\] ‘a pot in a pan,’ \[the sentence\] ‘this is not a pot, it is a pan’ is due to the absence of the \[direct\] experience of the pot as well as because it \[is based on\] recollection after seeing the dish and so forth, which is contrary to the pot, \[this is how knowledge\] should be understood; similarly, regarding a horse \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘it is a non-bull’ \[this knowledge is to be explained\], similarly, after seeing the generality; bath during night-time, this is to be understood as \[lawful\] dharma, because the knowledge of ‘un-lawful’ had been produced, thus these are 3 examples in which there is a difference between perceivable and unperceivable, and something \[intuitive\] which is beyond the sense-organ perception. 

***9.9. ‘non-existent,’ \[and\] ‘this is not’, \[between these 2 ***

regarding the prior, secondary, or posterior non-existential \[abhūta\] that is of the nature of absolute non-existence, like for example a hare’s horn and so forth as indicated in the \[expressions such as\] ‘non-existential,’ ‘this is not,’ which are defined by synonymous words and do not express another meaning, therefore, the philosophy \[Vaiśeṣika\] defines \[things\] by means of synonymous words, 

\[and\] not by the negation of ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and so forth; but concerning the other 

\[things\]\[he mentions\] –

***9.10. \[in the sentence\] ‘there is no pot in the house,’ this indicates a ***

***negation of the connection between an existing pot and the house***

there is ‘no pot at this ‘time’ \[and\] ‘space,’ this \[sentence\] is the negation of 

‘space’ and so forth in regard to pot and so forth, and the absence of the produced pot’s own nature is not denied.

497 quite contrary to the Buddhist view \(pratītyasamutpāda\), Vaiśeṣika sees ‘essence’ \(tattva\) and ‘reality’ \(sattā\) beyond the usual powers of perception such as seeing and so forth; thus, without officialising a doctrine of non-existence \(like the discussion on 

‘darkness’ attempts in VSc 5.2.21\) the system acknowledges reality beyond visibility, not least because there are forms of supra-perception. 

498 like the expression ‘sadasat’ \(VS 9.2\) whereby for a thing to be ‘sat’ it needs to have quality and designation, it is only the manifestation and perception of ‘sat’ that can be doubted, not its immanent or ‘hidden’ existence in the cause; the gloss may render asatkāryavāda problematic is understood in Western terms such as ‘to be or not to be’; 

‘sat’ and ‘asat’ may have a predominant linguistic, and mental value, not necessarily an existential one. 

499 ‘non-reality’ applies only to whatever entity is produced or effected; it refers to the 

‘non-reality’ of the ‘becoming.’

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 239

***9.11. ‘there is no other moon’ this \[expression\] ***

***precludes the universal moon***

‘there is no second moon,’ by this \[sentence\] the number \[of the moon\] is denied, therefore moon excludes the universal called moon, thus, as a matter of fact, it is said that there is no universal such as moonness; in the absence of such conditions as ‘time,’ ‘space,’ and ‘power of existence,’ \[some\] explain that it is something which is totally absent and \[they\] deny the universal moonness; because there is no grasping by perception, effect is both existing and non-existing in the cause,498 

\[one example is\] the non-production of curd from sand, \[but it is rather\] produced from milk. 

***9.12. the differentiation between ‘sat’ and ‘asat,’ \[shows\] that ***

***there is absence of ‘reality’ in the ‘effect-product’***

due to the opposition between ‘sat’ and ‘asat,’ there is no existential and non-existential effect in the cause simultaneously; therefore, \[effect\] is only un-real;499

\[introductory line\] because the subject-matter of perception is invisible 

\[parokṣa\],500 \[now\] the yogic perception is explained by the medium of both perception and inference. 501

***9.13. because of a particular ‘conjunction’ between ***

***‘soul’ and ‘mind’ \[taking place\] in the ‘soul’ ***

***\[there arises\] the perception of the ‘soul.’***

having withdrawn the senses from objects, and the ‘mind’ from them \[senses\], when ‘mind’ is concentrated only in the ‘soul,’ then the direct knowledge regarding one’s own ‘soul’ is produced from a specific connection between ‘soul’ and 

‘mind,’ which \[perception\] is dependent on a dharma born of yoga in those beings 

\[who practise contemplation\]. 502

500 ‘direct perception has a peculiar subject-matter’ may refer here to the role of perception to see through a ‘specific dharma’ \(dharmaviśeṣa\), the ultimate ‘differential essence of things’ \(viṣayatva\). 

501 \(preceding line to sūtra 9.13\) yogipratyakṣa is a direct perception about the nature of things and is explained to be both perceptual and inferential; to sum up, the theory of perception in Vaiśeṣika may be called ‘inferential induction.’

502 explanation: the introductory line of this sūtra and gloss explains that there exists a special form of knowledge achieved by yogis; the use of the genitive dual in the introductory line \(pratyakṣānumānayoḥ\) might mean that, like Praśastapāda, Candrānanda acknowledges a 2-fold character of yogipratyakṣa; there is also an epistemological argument at stake here, namely whether ‘soul’ is its own perceiver, or whether is perceived by someone else, say ‘mind’ \(manas\).

503 knowledge is produced in regard to the other substances through the contact between 

‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

504 these ‘contacts’ \(saṃyukta\) depend on the knowledge that takes place between ‘mind’ 

and ‘soul.’

505 ‘perceptive knowledge’ is already referred to in the previous sūtra 9.13. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 241

***9.14. in a similar way \[knowledge is produced\] in ***

***regard to the other substances503***

knowledge is produced in respect to \[several\] contacts:504 when substances’ 

contact with the ‘soul’ is not obstructed by atomic \[substances\] and so forth; in respect to ‘conjunctions’ of the soul that are not obstructed when all-pervasive 

\[substances\] are not in contact with the ‘soul,’ and when there are ‘conjunctions’ 

that obstruct the ‘soul,’ moreover, 

***9.15. \[perceptual knowledge\]505*** *** is also due to a contact ***

***between ‘soul,’ senses, ‘mind,’ and object-matter. ***

regarding things which are small, hidden, remote, their perceptual \[knowledge\] is also produced from the 4-fold perceptual contact;506 in this way, our perceptions and so forth \[are produced\]. 

***9.16. \[perception is produced\] in regard to motions and ***

***qualities through the co-existence \[of objects\] in them***

just as due to a ‘conjunction’ \[of mind\] with different causes, the knowledge concerning other substances \[soul and so forth\] is produced, similarly, the production of knowledge regarding motions and qualities \[happens\] by the inherence of those substances in their motions and qualities \[of things\]; 507and just as knowledge is produced in regards to minute things and our perception is through the 4-fold contact, similarly, the knowledge concerning qualities and motions is produced 

due to the co-existence with the connected \[object\].508

506 ‘the 4-fold contact’ is the one mentioned in the sūtra itself 9.15. 

507 once again, the ontological perceptual knowledge about the substances \(and their essences\) precedes any inferential knowledge about quality and motions; substance has proximity, whereas quality has a secondary value. 

508 ‘saṃyuktasamavāya’ plays an important role within the Vaiśeṣika theory of perception; it is what may be called ‘inferential induction’ whereby the epistemology of the system lies in both perception and inference, among which the former is principal and crucial.

509 the ‘intimate relation’ \(samavāya\) between the qualities and the substance ‘soul’ gives us the opportunity to analyse, define, and perceive ‘soul’ itself; however abstract a substance may be, qualities and their marks are an important medium by which we grasp the nature of substances, because between them there is an intimate relation, or as the Latin scholastic philosopher Duns Scotus would put it, there is only a ‘formal distinction’ not a ‘real distinction’ \(as the Thomist traditions maintain\). 

510 the concept of ‘haecceity’ which Duns Scotus generated, puts forward a similar argument about the existence of ‘I’; namely by the ‘sense data’ which demonstrate both the individualised essence of ‘soul’ can be demonstrated; ‘univocity’ would mean that there is no sharp distinction between simple essence and individualised nature, but only a ‘formal’ one. 

511 the discussion carries on about the specific qualities of the ‘soul,’ on whose essential knowledge liberation depends; on the other hand, the importance of the glosses 9.13 

through 9.17 lies in that it gives yoga a role to play at the cognitive level; neverthe-

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 243

***9.17. \[knowledge\] concerning the qualities of ‘soul’ \[is produced\] ***

***through their co-existence with the \[substance\] ‘soul’509***

just as from a ‘conjunction’ between ‘mind’ and ‘soul’ one’s knowledge concern-

ing one’s own ‘soul’ is produced,510 similarly the knowledge of ‘pleasure,’ and 

so forth,511 which are inherent in one’s own ‘soul,’ is produced \[as well\]; having explained yogic perception, he \[now\] explains the inference –

***9.18. \[the sentences\] ‘this is the effect of this,’ ‘this is connected ***

***with this,’ ‘this is inherent in one and the same thing,’ ***

***‘this is in conflict with this’ all these \[expressions\] are ***

***\[dependent\] on the mark \[of ‘that X thing’\]512***

after having shown only the connection between ‘this is of that,’ now he distinguishes between ‘cause and effect’ and so forth; by the grasp of \[the words\] ‘effect, cause’ it is understood that the defining indicators are only inherent in the genera and so forth; by the word ‘connected’ there is the conceptualisation of a ‘conjunct,’ 

such as smoke and so forth; other things are explained in the sūtra beginning with 

‘saṃyoga’; in this respect, Vṛttikāra513 says: ‘whosoever sees without doubt one part of an object in the relation established, in this way his remaining consideration is produced from the vision connected with the characteristic mark.’

***9.19. thereby, \[knowledge derived from\] word-sound is explained514***

just as inference presupposes the memory of an effect and so forth, which is the object-matter of a supra-sensual perception \[and is subject\] to the 3 tenses 

\[past, present, future\], 515 similarly the \[knowledge derived from\] ‘word-sound’ 

is dependent on the memory of convention and is the domain \[which covers\] the 3 temporalities, and is something beyond sense-perception;516 therefore, because inference possesses one and the same subsistence \[with śabda\] inference is to be ascertained \[as a result\]; if you \[asked\] as to what is the meaning of word \[śabda-pramāṇa\] then this would be stated –

less, since yoga entails mental motion, it must have only an intellectual role to play, a mediating role, not necessarily directly soteriological. 

512 if glosses 9.13–17 dealt with perception, from VSc 9.18 onwards the commentator deals with inference, which is a second major epistemological pramāṇa in Vaiśeṣika. 

513 Candrānanda quotes from an unknown ‘author of the Vṛtti commentary’ \(Vṛttikāra\), which is currently lost. 

514 śabda-pramāṇa may be a ‘linguistic type of knowledge,’ subsumed under anumāna \(inferential logics and dialectics\). 

515 allusion is made here to a supra-ordinary form of knowledge that transcends senses and temporality; later, in VSc 9.28 the commentator returns to it. 

516 the theory of language in Vaiśeṣika is that sound-word \(śabda\) is not eternal, therefore the meaning, like knowledge itself, is a ‘composite entity or process’; that is to say, language is merely conventional, established by God or seers who possess the power to name, define, and memorise things and their essences, see, for instance, VSc 6.1.13.

517 ‘comparison’ \(upamāna\) is not a different pramāṇa but is rather sub-included under 

‘inference’ \(anumāna\). 

518 the gloss finally elucidates that there are no more than 2 pramāṇas; confusion may be created due to the subsuming under inference of other ‘sub-pramāṇas’ such as śabda, smṛti, and upamāna.

***9.20. reasoning, invalid argument, inferential mark, instrumental ***

***cause, means of knowledge, causation, these are synonymous***

by words such as ‘hetu’ \[reasoning\] and so forth, he ultimately explains the cause; reasoning \[and\] pretext means cause; thus, if you ask how the word can be a cause, the mark for understanding the existing object is:

***9.21. because of the \[object’s\] dependence on ‘cognition’ ***

***\[we can say\] ‘this belongs to this’***

just as ‘for the object of understanding, the movement of the hand should be understood as the cause,’ in that way someone who has understood the convention conceptualises the object after having seen the movement of the hand, and then, from its sound, as it \[is expressed in the sentence\] ‘for the sake of knowledge of this object, this word is the cause,’ one \[observer\], as a result of an established convention, conceptualises from the sound-word the object of the cause, just as worldly people conceptualise an object through gesture and so forth, hence, this word is the indicator of the meaning because of a convention \[between them\] as stated by the author of the Vṛtti that this \[word\] is the cause; in this way comparison and so forth are included \[in inference\]; 517 hence, the means of knowledge are only 2; and the means of knowledge is proved \[by the word\] ‘anena \[‘hereby’\] it is known,’ or by ‘pramā’ \[which indicates the authoritative\] means of knowledge;518 

memory is a part of inference, as expressed \[as follows\] –

***9.22. memory \[comes into existence\] from a particular ‘conjunction’ ***

***between ‘mind’ and ‘soul’ and because of a ‘latent impetus’519***

the visualisation of the rising of smoke follows from the perception of fire due to a \[perceptual\] ‘conjunction’ between ‘soul’ with ‘mind’, and from a specific 

\[impression\] called ‘bhāvanā’ \[expressed in sentences such as\] ‘whenever there is fire there is smoke,’ memory is produced. 

519 saṃskāra \(latent impetus\) in VSc 9.22–4 deals with memory from sleep, whereas from VSc 9.25 onwards with memory in the awakened state.

520 ‘svapnāntika’ might be the deep part of the dream, sub-consciousness in dreams, or the ‘awareness of dream.’

521 the difference between a ‘voluntary dream’ caused by mind \(svapna\) and an ‘involuntary dream’ \(svapnāntika\) is that the latter is caused by karmic conjunctions that are beyond man’s control. 

522 knowledge about dream indicates the ‘law of karma’ that is enacted by auspicious and inauspicious deeds caused by dharma and adharma. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 247

***9.23. and similarly, dream and ultimate consciousness520*** *** \[are produced\]***

dream is when knowledge concerning \[a person’s\] senses are stopped, and ‘mind’ 

is calm, which \[knowledge\] is produced by mind alone, \[but\] the ultimate consciousness and the knowledge of dream are both produced from a particular 

‘conjunction’ between ‘soul,’ ‘mind,’ and the ‘conjunction’ based on an earlier experience which is associated with ‘bhāvanā’ \[mental energy\]. 521

***9.24. and from ‘dharma’ \[and adharma\]522***

knowledge concerning a dream whose object has not even been experienced is the subject-matter of ‘auspicious’ and ‘non-auspicious’ \[things\] due to ‘dharma’ 

\[merit\], and because of the word ‘ca’ \[in sūtra 9.24\] there is another ‘adharma’ \[as well\]; however, concerning \[cognition in an\] awakened \[state\] –

***9.25. \[there is\] ignorance because of a defect in the ***

***senses and because of a latent impression***

\[in the case of a person\] whose sense-organs have been affected by a defect \[doṣa\] of wind and so forth, from a latent impression caused by an earlier experience of lunar station \[asterism rajata\], as well as because of a ‘conjunction’ between ‘mind’ and 

‘soul’ dependent on a particular dharma, 523 then \[defective\] knowledge occurs concerning for example \[the confusion between\] silver and an oyster shell; for instance the hesitation of the visualisation between a ‘southerner’ and a ‘camel.’

***9.26. that is defective knowledge***

whatever knowledge is characterised by ‘dream,’ ‘non-recognition,’ ‘reversed knowledge,’ \[or\] ‘doubt,’ that is defective \[cognition\] and is not a valid means of knowledge. 

***9.27. flawless \[knowledge\] is \[considered\] ‘vidyā’ \[authoritative\]***

whatever knowledge is not defective, that is called pratyakṣa \[perception\] and anumāna \[inference\], and that is called ‘vidyā’ ‘vidyā’ \[authoritative\]. 

523 ‘viśiṣṭādharma’ may well be an allusion to ‘antyaviśeṣa’ \(VS 1.2.6\) which is the ‘cognitive factor’ for the identification of causes of illness; the mention of doṣas such as ‘vāta’ and so forth, shows that the Vaiśeṣika system plays a role in the Ayurvedic aetiology, in its medical practice, for the medic, like the yogi, is the observer who must introspect the ultimate particularity of any disorder, be it of either a physical or mental order; since antyaviśeṣa is a factor that differentiates the non-composite eternal substances, here the illness lies in the corrupted ‘soul,’ not the fundamental elements wind, fire, water, and earth.

524 from the main features of siddhadarśana and the reference to vipāka, we may perhaps be entitled to raise the question as to whether the distinction between siddhadarśana versus ārṣajñāna may correspond to the difference between abhyudaya and niḥśreyasa, where abhyudaya is a ‘worldly’ elevation, an upgrading to superior cosmic levels, where siddhadarśana seems to play a role; niḥśreyasa however, is very different from abhyudaya; it is like the difference between ārṣajñāna and siddhadarśana \(ārṣaṁ bhidyata iti varṇayanti\) whereby the latter seems to contain a spatial, dimensional or cosmic knowledge; at any rate, neither of them should be confused with yogipratyakṣa, which is a perception that plays a role in the soteriological-cognitive process of the knowledge of categories; the forms of knowledge discussed in the ninth adhyāya: duṣṭa and aduṣṭa, ārṣajñāna and siddhadarśana represent the Vaiśeṣika theory of perception, and are only extraordinary types of knowledge, not pramāṇas. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 249

***9.28. knowledge of visionary sages and \[that\] of ***

***the perfectible ones is from dharma***

regarding the knowledge of the divine sages not grounded on the sacred texts, which \[knowledge\] is not based on inferential marks such as dharma and so forth, regarding, past, present, and future things which are beyond the reach of sense-organs, that is \[knowledge\] intuitively produced and it only sometimes belongs to worldly people \[when they announce\] ‘my heart tells me that my brother will come tomorrow,’ this \[knowledge\] is called aṛṣa \[seers’ knowledge\] being derived only from speculative logic, and guess, its result is only non-ascertainment; however, the \[knowledge\] of the perfectible sages is \[achieved\] from eye-anointment and chemicals, and \[perceives\] minute, hidden, \[and\] remote things, and discerns the ripening of dharma and adharma caused by \[the activities of\] celestial living beings, and those from the intermediate regions, and so forth; such knowledge is not different from perception and inference, \[but\] the sages’ visionary knowledge is different, thus it is explicated;524thus, this and that knowledge – of the sages and the knowledge of the perfect people – is produced from a ‘specific dharma’525 and from a contact between ‘mind’ and ‘soul.’

**// this is the ninth chapter //**

**10. **

**/ the tenth chapter /**

thus, since the earlier discussion concerning ‘cognition’526 is not complete, \[the author\] says that ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are the supporting basis of ‘cognition,’ 

‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’; 527 for example, some people say that ‘pleasure,’ ‘pain,’ and 

‘chimeras’ are beings; \[but\] this is not so, 

525 Candrānanda allocates a lot of scope to Vaiśeṣika’s ‘theory of difference’ in which he sees the capacity to offer a valid tool which responds to all needs; he offers several types of knowledge, siddhadarśana, aṛṣa, yogipratyakṣa, for 2 different kinds of purposes: abhyudaya and niḥśreyasa. 

526 the tenth chapter ends with the restatement of soteriology, according to which, the nature and function of ‘cognition’ play a mediating role in achieving that. 

527 in other words, such vaiśeṣikaguṇas exist in themselves, they cannot have other vaiśeṣikaguṇas as their substratum, because their substratum is the embodied ātman; if ‘pain’ and ‘pleasure’ were permanent and existed in themselves, then ‘liberation’ 

would be impossible, but this is something which the commentator rejects.

528 each soul has its own set of ‘specific qualities’ \(vaiśeṣikaguṇa\) that are experienced individually and not by any other self; in addition to the individualistic and unique experience of ‘I’ \(ahaṃkāra\), this argument is proof of the existence of the plurality of the souls. 

529 once again, dualistic epistemology is prevalent in Vaiśeṣika categories. 

530 how can qualities be in one single subject-matter and yet many? what is their identity when they inhere in an object; a possible response to the manifoldness of qualities should be sought in relation to the variety of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’; see the argument for the plurality of the souls in āhnika VSc 3.2. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 251

***10.1. co-existence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ in the ‘soul’ is ***

***the cause of the \[knowledge of the\] difference between ***

***the 5 elements which constitute \[one body\]***

whatever co-existence of ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ exists in the ‘soul’ itself, that is the cause of a different subject-matter from the 5 elements \[mahābhūta\] ‘earth’ and so forth, and from the qualities such as ‘smell,’ ‘colour,’ ‘taste,’ ‘touch,’ inhabiting their substratum \[5 elements\], \[and this is\] because there cannot be co-existence of qualities there, or in another soul \[at the same time\];528 and the inherence of the 2 \[pain and pleasure\] in the ‘soul’ is one and the same with ‘I-consciousness’ 

\[ahaṃkāra\]; in spite of their co-existence in the ‘soul,’ \[Kaṇāda\] says –

***10.2. because \[‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are caused\] by a ***

***specific ‘desirable,’ ‘undesirable’ \[fact\], and because ***

***of their reciprocal opposition, ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ ***

***are existentials different from \[each other\]***

‘pleasure’ is produced from causes such as women, and so forth; ‘pain’ is produced from causes such as poison and so forth; ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ are mutually opposite, because their production \[happened\] from mutual destruction; 529 therefore, there is difference between them and there is no identity \[between them\] 

through their co-existence in one object \[and\] its manifoldness;530 if you say that doubt and conclusion are based only on mutual non-reality \[but\] they are not actually existing things, \[then the answer is\] no, 

***10.3. and doubt and conclusion are different from each ***

***other, and this is the proof of another ‘cognition’***

manifestation of both doubt and conclusion is caused from the difference of their separate uniqueness, each of which possessing a different meaning; thus, doubt is produced in regard to a person who wants to know the particularity but who has not understood that particularity is due to the contemplation of generality;531 

another doubt is when after having understood the particularity through another means of knowledge, there comes \[as a result\] the discernment that ‘this is only a pillar \[not a man\],’ if these two things were not real then they would not be produced from causes which are different from each other; therefore, doubt and conclusion are 2 forms of knowledge different from each other, but the conclusion does not differ from perception and inference, this is what some people say. 

531 the reality of ‘universals’ is possible only after the knowledge of ‘particularity’ has been grasped; the knowledge goes from simple to complex; without particularity the knowledge of the universal becomes the knowledge of generic things, \(epistemic generalisation\) which often leads to confusion and doubt; particularity and universality are opposite but equivalent terms for they imply each other; concerning universals in Aristotle see De Int 7.17a38–41; Met 7.13.

532 viśeṣa \(particularity\) is that which defines the theory of perception in Vaiśeṣika from the highest visible level to the most minute invisible level. 

533 ‘thing brought forth’ may refer to a thing from the past, the next sūtra refers to a thing from the future. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 253

***10.4. production of both \[doubt and conclusion\] is ***

***explained by the \[different\] means of knowledge ***

***\[pramāṇa\] perception and inference***

just as, when a person having memory – after having seen directly the mark of himself – this knowledge is not perceived in the same manner as that of the man who has only seen something generic, and having a particularity from memory wishes to investigate and grasp the particularity \[when the particular is not known\] 

a doubt arises as \[expressed in the question\] ‘is \[this\] a pillar or man’; and just as, by a contact with a past thing a perception as \[expressed in the sentence\] ‘this is an object like this’ is produced, in the same manner, conclusion-judgement takes place because of a contact with the particularity532 after doubt has been removed; now he explains the ‘cognitions’ of cause and effect –

***10.5. perception is explained with a thing brought forth \[already\]533***

after effect is produced from its own causes \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘this effect has occurred \[so\] it is produced,’ this is a cognition of effect \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘through the knowledge of adjective-qualification there is the knowledge of the qualified \[thing\]’ by means of this rule ‘that’ \[cognition of effect\] is produced, and it is the chief subject \[of cognition\]; elsewhere \[this subject-knowledge\] is secondary because of the absence of effect; thus, when the effect is going to be produced, 

***10.6. \[effect-knowledge exists\] because is seen in a subsequent effect ***

***\[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘it will happen’ \[in the future\]***

such as after an uninterrupted collection \[of causes\] as it must happen, 534 an effect such as a pot and so forth has been visibly produced, so also, now, after having seen that type of collection \[of causes\] even though the effect is not \[yet\] produced, having used the word ‘kārya’ \[effect\] metaphorically, the cognition concerning effect is produced \[as in the sentence\] ‘effect will happen’;535 although 

\[effect\] is being produced –

534 ‘uninterrupted collection as it must happen’, refers to the necessity of the endless chain of causation entailed by the indestructible relationship between cause and effect \(vyāpti\); cause requires an effect, and effect requires a cause, both ontologically and epistemologically. 

535 the epistemology of the system takes a logical-inferential turn not least because everything including ‘time’ is composed of parts which stand in a relation of interdependence; if, from an ontological point of view, there is a reality such as ‘present,’ then one can naturally assert the reality of subsequent temporal parts, ‘past’ and ‘future’ 

moments, whereby they necessarily presuppose each other.

536 sūtra alludes to the theory of asatkāryavāda which allows for the possibility of new things \(as opposed to satkāryavāda, where effect exists already in the cause\). 

537 cause and effect are again mutually inclusive as well as mutually exclusive. 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 255

***10.7. similarly, \[cognition of effect\] happens from both ***

***dependent and independent \[causes\]***

when there are threads spread out, dependent \[on each other\], the earlier and earlier connections are not \[yet\] comprehended, \[but\] after the ‘conjunction’ is no longer there, one comprehends the subsequent independent \[threads\], and observes the subordinate effects such as stripes and so forth; the production of the effect \[as in the assertion\] ‘this is an effect’ is in relation to the design of the ‘conjunction’ between produced and non-produced \[entities\] when there is the sight of the production of an effect from cause, this is \[how\] cognition is generated; just as there is production, so also there is destruction \[of things\] by some other effort \[or forces\], as in the case of pot substances and so forth, whose destruction is ‘abhūt’ 

as explained in \[the sentence\] ‘bhūtapratyakṣābhāvāt’ \[‘due to the absence of the past thing’\] \[VS 9.6\] and so forth, thus such things are told regarding the body which is the subject to transformation and so forth \[which is an effect of causes\]; regarding a destroyed \[thing\] –

***10.8. \[cognition of\] a ‘past thing’ is536*** *** from the ***

***\[cognition of another prior\] past thing***

meaning of ‘abhūt’ \[refers here to\] a destroyed \[thing\]; after having comprehended separately, \[body\] parts such as hand, foot, neck, and so forth, because of the ‘conjunction’ with a non-inherent cause which is destroyed when the effect-

product is destroyed,537 then there is the comprehension of ‘effect-product called body was there’; but when \[effect-product is\] destroyed –

***10.9. it exists also, because of the non-inherent effect \[in cause\]538***

because of the word ‘ca,’ \[we say that\] ‘conjunction’ \[both\] exists \[as well as\] is destroyed, for although the operation of the destroyer-cause does not destroy the body parts such as neck and so forth because of \[their\] conjunctions, and other parts of the body such as hands and so forth are destroyed due to disjunctions, an effect is not inherent in the body, because the destruction \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘effect is being destroyed’ is noticeable in the relation between a destroyed 

\[thing\] and a non-destroyed \[thing\], this is how knowledge generates; yet, other 

\[thinkers while\] commenting upon this, explain that ‘the past thing is an effect,’ 

\[but\] that is not correct because of the destructibility of the effect has been operated by that \[cause\]; and ‘cognition’ is \[produced\] like this –

538 the non-inherence of the effect in the cause, according to asatkāryavāda, means that the effect cannot ‘pre-exist’ in the cause; effect exists only if there is a cause; alternative translation: ‘when it \[conjunction\] exists \[and when it does not exist\] \[cognition is possible\] because of the non-inherent effect \[in cause\],’ the alternate existence of ‘conjunction’ to exist and not to exist, is indicated by the conjunction ‘ca,’ see Thakur 2003: 119.

539 viśeṣas are abstract individuals which stand beyond the visible particulars of the body \(head, back, belly, hand\); to put it differently, one may say that there is the ‘particular head’ on the one hand, but what viśeṣa indicates is perhaps that there is also an 

‘essence’ of a head, on the other hand, which is invisible to the naked eye. 

540 sāmānyaviśeṣa has been translated here differently, and not in terms of ‘universal particularity’ or ‘generic specificity’ as elsewhere in this edition. 

541 when it is said that ‘the first cognition’ is ‘the substance as a cause’ by this it is meant that ‘substance is the first and foremost category of knowledge’ among all padārthas, and in a sense the most important one; before knowing the effects of things, one needs 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 257

***10.10. \[effect-product\] exists because it has been seen, with other ***

***caused-things, in one portion of one body, this it is one only***

when \[body\] parts such as hand and so forth, are inherent in an effect-product body and so forth, and sometimes in one and the same subject, then, the ‘cognition’ of the parts is comprehended; now, the production of cognition \[as expressed in the sentence\] ‘the effect happened,’ is after a separation from that \[cause\], and after having comprehended their divisibility, both ‘in that’ and ‘each instance’; 

\[regarding the question\] which are these limbs, \[he\] says this –

***10.11. head, back, belly, hand, these are \[known\] ***

***by their ‘particularities.’539***

the meaning of this \[sūtra\] is that head, and so forth, are the limbs whose knowledge is produced from headiness and other parts, which have their own ‘generalities’ and ‘particularities’; 540 however, regarding the ‘cognition’ of cause \[Kaṇāda\] 

says –

***10.12. cause is \[known\] from the co-existence of effect in the essence***

the first ‘cognition’ \[expressed by the sentence\] ‘substance is the cause’541 takes 

place when one sees the effect of the substance or quality or motion inherent in 

\[that\] substance from which an effect is produced; when, however, \[effect\] has not 

\[yet\] been produced –

***10.13. or \[is known\] from a ‘conjunction’ \[with something else\]542***

even when ‘effect’ is going to be produced \[in the future\] through mutual ‘conjunction’ of threads and so forth, \[then\] cognition concerning ‘conjunction’ as the cause of the cloth is produced; the production of ‘cognition’ of cause \[derives\] 

from the effect that will be produced \[such as\] cloth is preceded by threads and so forth, 543 which stand in a mutual relation.544

to identify, inductively, the cause, which is the substance itself which is the cause and substratum of the effect-products. 

542 as we know, there is a difference between ‘conjunction’ and ‘inherence.’

543 in this case, thread is the cause while cloth is the effect; ‘preceded by threads’ means that threads are the cause of the cloth; a similar cause-effect discussion occurs in VSc 10.15. 

544 ‘cognition’ is a ‘composite process’; in this case it is the mutual composition between cause and effect which is always intertwined; cognition should not be understood as the faculty of one organ, such as mind, as in Western philosophy.

545 Arena in his Italian edition \(VSi\) 1982: 200, translates that motion is not an inherent cause, see also VSc 10.12. 

546 ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ are independent entities that work separately, not as cause-effect would do; therefore, the commentator says that they have no dependent cause; that is to say, they are ‘independent.’

547 ‘inherence of their cause in the substance’ means that the qualities ‘conjunction’ and 

‘disjunction’ reside in their substratum, the substance. 

548 something is caused because of the ‘inherence in a cause’; if a colour cannot be produced without being inherent in the cause, does this mean that effect pre-exists \(or inheres\) in the cause? 

* Vaiśeṣikasūtra * 259

***10.14. \[knowledge of cause\]545 is due to the ***

***co-existence of causes in motions***

because in ‘conjunction’ and ‘disjunction’ there is a non-dependent cause,546 and 

because of the co-existence of their cause in the substance, 547 motions cause the 

‘cognition of cause’ as soon as they are produced; now regarding the \[cognition of\] qualities –

***10.15. similarly, colour \[is known\] because its cause ***

***is inherent in \[another\] cause548***

cloth and so forth549 is that which has the nature of a product inherently connected with a cause, whereby the inherent cause is the threads in regard to cloth and so forth, the form-colour and so forth are called cause because of being inherent in the cause of causes; 550 because of the word ‘ca’ \[‘and’\] even though the form of effect is not \[yet\] produced, there is still cognition of cause. 

***10.16. regarding ‘conjunction,’ \[this is known\] because ***

***of its co-existence with the cause551***

cognition of ‘conjunction’ as a cause concerns substance \[cloth\] due to the co-existence with threads and so forth, which are the inherent causes of the effect cloth and so forth; however, regarding the origin of qualities and motions –

549 ‘and so forth’ \(or ‘etc.’\) refers here to cloth and similar products, all of which are presumably made of the same material, threads. 

550 even an effect can be considered a cause, which allows for an endless chain of causality; the expression ‘the cause of causes’ shows the infinity of the events and cosmic manifestations; the knowledge of the ultimate essence of such causes \(the substance\) is therefore the means to acquire ‘liberation’ which is the state that puts a halt to this endless chain of causality. 

551 since the previous sūtras discuss the various causes, the subject of the sūtra I take to be the ‘cause.’

552 this valid means of knowledge is ‘inference,’ which is one of the two major pramāṇas on which Vaiśeṣika is based. 

553 ‘dṛṣṭānāṃ’ refers to ‘injunctions’ explicitly mentioned in the śruti and smṛti texts \(courtesy of Pundit Devadatta Patil\).

***10.17. similarly, \[cause is known\] because it can ***

***inhere in both cause and non-cause***

regarding the pot which is a cause as well as a non-cause, the ‘conjunction’ 

with fire is the cause of the things produced from heating because of the inherence; the ‘conjunction’ with a speedy substance is the cause of motion due to the co-existentiality of the motion in the cause, which is to be destroyed and due to the non-cause which is the destroyer \[of the motion\]; yet, regarding \[things\] made of heating –

***10.18. particularity \[is known\] because fire is in close ***

***contact with the contacted thing \[when burning\]***

regarding the inception of the form-colour produced from the heating of atoms, a ‘conjunction’ is dependent upon a specific quality, namely hot-touch which is inherent in the contacted fire; except for the substance, in other situations, ‘conjunction’ is a dependent cause; regarding beyond-senses \[cognition\] such as the past things –

***10.19. the authoritative inferential means of ***

***knowledge has been explained552***

\[means of knowledge based on\] inferential marks is called ‘parokṣa’ \[beyond eye-perception\], the inference \[anumāna\] is that which is known by means of effects \[in sentences such as\] ‘it will become’ and so forth, thus, the means of knowledge have been explained; in the beginning of this science \[Vaiśeṣika philosophy\], dharma was announced as that which is to be explained, therefore, in order to coordinate the meaning of the 2 sūtras \[the one from the beginning\] with the conclusion, even though it has been explicated, \[nevertheless, now, Kaṇāda\] 

explains it again –

***10.20. \[acts\] which are explicitly stated,553*** *** \[acts\] whose ***

***purpose is seen, \[acts\] whose purpose is not seen are ***

***\[all acts which lead\] to ‘mundane elevation’554***

performance of acts which are seen in the śruti and smṛti \[texts\] when their purpose is not \[visibly mentioned\] is for the sake of elevation, this is the meaning 

\[of the sūtra\]; the achievement of \[dharma\] is stated in the sacred texts; and the authority of the sacred texts is well-established –

554 this sūtra is identical with VS 6.2.1.

Bhagavān which means Īśvara \[and\] is known through the effect-products such as body, cosmos, and so forth, \[and\] since He composed the sacred texts, \[these texts\] are established as authoritative; the word ‘iti’ \[in the sūtra\] means comple-tion \[of Vaiśeṣika philosophy, here\]; hence, by the knowledge of differences and similarities between substances and so forth, through the production of knowledge \[obtained\] by the means of ‘detachment’ \[from the world\], and through the acquisition of a special knowledge about ‘adoration’ that follows a successive order of precepts such as ‘the soul should be known,’ and so forth, \[by all of these\] 

there is achievement of ‘absolute liberation.’

\[colophon\]555

/ he who gives always delight to the moon, is like the \[moon\] which gives bliss to the entire world / \[such a moon\] belongs to the night of knowledge, \[so also\] Candrānanda prepared this commentary //

// thus, the commentary on the Vaiśeṣikasūtra is concluded \[here\]//

555 the colophon displays a play of poetic words using the simile of the moon \(symbol of knowledge in dark or ‘confusing’ times\); the Vaiśeṣika student should identify the main subject, which is the author himself, Candrānanda, and not the moon; Candrānanda resembles the moon because by ‘differential knowledge’ \(Vaiśeṣika philosophy\) he dispelled the darkness of knowledge, which is ignorance about reality.
