Two major assets are presented by VSc \(ed. 1961\). One is the very early date of the commentary itself, and the second is the Vaiśeṣikasūtra \(Sūtrapāṭha\), which contains 7 different sūtras ‘nowhere quoted in the entire philosophical literature.’1 

These ‘new’ sūtras are: VS 2.2.33 \(abhāvāt\); VS 5.2.4 \(tad viśeṣeṇādṛṣṭakāritam\); VS 7.1.6 \(guṇāntaraprādurbhāvāt\); 7.2.2 \(tayor nityatvānityatve tejaso rūpasparśābhyāṃ vyākhyāte\); 7.2.3 \(niṣpattiś ca\); 7.2.22 \(tathā pratyayābhāvaḥ\); and 7.2.23 \(saṃbaddhasaṃbandhāt iti sandehaḥ\). 2 So far, VS of Candrānanda stood the test of time and all the challenge of textual-criticism. When comparing VS with ‘A’ \(Ahmedabad MS\), Isaacson confirms that A is ‘clearly closer to VS’ 

\(shortened ‘C’\).3 Before Isaacson’s new MSS readings \(unpublished PhD dissertation\), we knew from Thakur about 16 MSS, most of which supply the Mithilā 

version \(of Upaskāra\). New ones \(‘A’ and ‘T’\) read by Isaacson, as well as the recent publication of volume 32 of the New Catalogus Catalogorum \(henceforth NCC\), gives new locations for ‘all’ MSS on Vaiśeṣikasūtras \(see Appendix 3\), 

and bodes well for a fresh reading of both Vaiśeṣika’s tenets and a forthcoming critical edition. With my current research, I have begun the task of inventorying all such MSS, and a descriptive list may be found in Appendix 3 of this edition. 

Starting from the ‘Vaiśeṣikasūtra entry,’ we must make all effort in collecting all MSS descriptions on Vaiśeṣika, principally its Sūtrapāṭha, all of which are currently extant and available in Indian libraries as per NCC description. 

**2.1 MSS on Sūtrapāṭha**

In 2013, the University of Madras finally published volume 32 of NCC, which reached the letter ‘v’ and has provided the entry for ‘Vaiśeṣikasūtra.’ So we can finally identify various locations where Vaiśeṣika MSS on the mūla text could be found and photographed, some of which had already been visited and explored

by certain scholars \(at Trivandrum, Pune, Jodhpur, Darbangha\). 4 Beginning from the textual-philological evidence provided by Isaacson \(PhD\), here I should mention briefly the MSS on Sūtrapāṭha, which I have been able to look at, as well as additional ones that I had the chance to photograph during my Erasmus research field-work to India \(2015–2016\). To my knowledge, 3 scholars before myself had 

looked at MSS containing Sūtrapāṭha alone.5

Gopinath Kaviraj \(1929\)6 provides information about ‘an apparently very old manuscript \(undated\) of the Vaiśeṣikaūtras, from a private collection in Benares.’ 

This MS \(henceforth ‘Be’\) contains several differences from the Sūtrapāṭha of Upaskāra. It is still not published, and, as per 1995, Isaacson could not trace its 

location.7

Anantalal Thakur is by far the scholar who looked most extensively over the Vaiśeṣika MSS, but sadly, he does not give a thorough description of these. In an article published in 1963,8 he indicates having ‘collated the sūtra-readings from six printed editions and sixteen Manuscripts preserved in different Manuscripts Libraries.’9 Among them, Thakur also notes ‘two’10 that have been used for the publication of Vyākhyā \(Darbangha 1957\) and Vṛtti \(Baroda 1961\). 

Harunaga Isaacson, in his PhD thesis, brings further contributions by consulting 2 additional MSS containing Sūtrapāṭha alone, and provides a ‘diplomatic edition’ for each one of these, as well as a ‘tentative reconstruction of the presumed hyparchtype of both, followed by an attempt at evaluation.’11 This MSS is \(1\) the Ahmedabad MS \(henceforth ‘A’\) and \(2\) a second MS from Trivandrum \(henceforth ‘T’\). A is a ‘Sammelhandschrift’ \(a collated MS consisting of several heterogeneous MSS, in this case, the Nyāyasūtra first, second Sūtrapāṭha of 

[^4]:  For the ‘Vaiśeṣikasūtra’ entry, see NCC vol. XXXII, p. 65–68. I say ‘could’ because some MSS are almost impossible to obtain, even though they are mentioned in NCC. Two MSS \(140 and 183\), for instance, are mentioned in the entry; these are supposed to be in the Sanskrit Pāṭhaśālā of Rajapur \(South Maharashtra\). When I visited the site, the young pundits had no knowledge of any \(handwritten\) list of the MSS, which obviously they should have possessed. All MSS \(presumably not yet classified\) were preserved in about 20 big bags on the roof of the main building. The pāṭhaśālā 

most probably belonged to the Vedānta tradition, because many MSS I looked at, randomly, belonged to that tradition and were not very old \(paper, 18th and 19th century, approximately\). 

[^5]:  I should add Ferenc Ruzsa, though he looked at improving the VSc Baroda edition, and only took into consideration the MSS related to VSc, not to VS.

Vaiśeṣika, and then Nyāyavatara, a Jaina treatise on logic\). 12 T is a palm-leaf manuscript, and represents an independent recension and is located in the Kerala University Manuscripts Library, Trivandrum \(no 22615\). Like ‘A,’ ‘T’ also con-

tains Nyāyasūtra without commentary.13

**2.2 New MSS on Sūtrapāṭha**

Finally, this edition takes into consideration new MSS and begins from the first-hand reading of 5 new different MSS \(paper\) that only contain Sūtrapāṭha, collected by Ionut Moise from Mumbai, Wai, Mysore, and Madras. These are not old \( *post ante quem*: 18th century, approximately\); all of them well preserved. These are as follows. 

Prajñapāṭhaśāḷā Maṇḍaḷa \(Wai, South Maharashtra\). I have photocopied 3 MSS: numbers 6108, 6109, and 6110. 14 I marked them as follows: W \(6108\), 1

W \(6109\), and W \(6110\). When there was an agreement in the MSS collation, 2

3

I refered to these as ‘W.’ All of these present more or less the Sūtrapāṭha version of Upaskāra with its chapters, classified in a further 2 lessons each \(which is not the case with VSc, where the last chapters 8, 9, and 10 have no lesson-division\). 

They all begin with a devotional salutation \(‘Śrī Ganeśāya namaḥ’: W , W and 1

3; 

‘śrīmad sadgurucaranābhyāmānamaḥ’ W \). They are preserved and wrapped in 2

used newspaper \(Marathi\) on which another serial number is given. The sūtras are separated by simple and double slashes \(/\). Each lesson is marked, and a prior reader highlighted each one of those signposts in pencil: W \(paper\) is 25.3 × 

1

[^9]: size, Devanagari script, 4 folios with approximately 13–15 lines per page, and 51 letters per line; it is complete, in good readable condition, and the year provided by Wai MSS catalogue vol. II \(p. 777\) is 1813. W \(paper\) handwriting is 2

slightly bigger, in Devanagari script, 30.5 × 10.7 size, 4 folios, 12 lines per page, 45 letters per line, it is complete, good condition, not dated, but judging by the size and writing style it could be the same age or perhaps slightly earlier, end of the 18th century. Among the 3 Wai MSS, this looks the most ‘archaic.’ W like 3

the other 2, bears the title ‘Vaiśeṣikasūtrani’ on the newspaper cover \(Devanagari script\) paper, 24.2 × 12.6 size, 7 folios with 10 lines per page, and 47 letters per line; it is complete and in a wonderful condition, with tidy handwriting. It is the best preserved among the 3 and has no date, but it is possibly from the 19th century. Like all others, this MS provides the Upaskāra version of the Sūtrapāṭha. 

The catalogue lists another MS \(no 6111, with 119 folios\), which presents the Vaiśeṣikasūtras with Upaskāra commentary, but since my goal was to trace back only the ‘independent transmission’ of VS, I have not taken a photocopy.

Oriental Research Institute Mysore. From a large collection of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika MSS, I have selected only MS no E 37153 \(alternative no: C 4416/1\). 15 

I shall refer to it with ‘M.’ It bears the title ‘Vaiśeṣikasūtram’ and the author \(not the scribe\) is ‘Kaṇādaḥ.’ Paper with Devanagari script, 32 × 10 size, 9 folios with approximately 48 letters per line. It is complete and in good condition. Like 

‘W,’ ‘M’ seems to give the Sūtrapāṭha version of Upaskāra \(split in the exactly the same lesson as others\). It begins with a salutatory devotional greeting \(‘Śrī 

Ganeśāya namaḥ’\). The writing is small, with pencil highlighting after each lesson. Sūtras are separated by a simple slash, and only rarely by double slashes. 

The Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay presents us with a slightly different version of the Sūtrapāṭha \(henceforth ‘B’\). In this MS, some sūtras are not separated by a slash \(/\), e.g. VS 6.2.18. Here we deal with an older MS, dated 1715 Śake, in Sanskrit \(Sk.\), no 1934 \(but in Velankar’s Catalogue no 1059\); it has 9 folios, on paper and is preserved at the Asiatic Society of Bombay in the collection of Bhau Daji Collection \(BD – 30/4\). 16 One interesting addition regarding Sūtrapāṭha is that it does not follow the Sūtrapāṭha of Śaṅkaramiśra, as it omits to mention 

‘padārthānāṃ’ from VS 1.1.4. 

Madras. Governmental Oriental Manuscripts Library. Finally, this is most probably a 20th-century MS, and I have photocopied it from the Governmental MSS Library of Madras, yet I will not count it among the Sūtrapāṭha MSS discussed because it is more of a digest of Vaiśeṣika tenets. I shall refer to it as ‘C.’ 

The title it bears is ‘Vaiśeṣikavastunirṇayaḥ’ by an author called Nṛsiṃha, it is paper Devanagari script, it is complete and bears 2 numbers: 20432 and R 3092b \(accession and serial\), the latter being the one that is inscribed on the front page. 

It is a ‘Sammelhandschrift’ \(composite manuscript\) and as a result collated in the shape of a ‘book-note,’ not on separate folios like all others. 17

Note. As a concluding remark, and based on my fresh efforts to bring something new, I must point out with Thakur and Isaacson, that, with meagre exceptions, the majority of these sūtras of the MSS present us with the Mithilā version \(of Śaṅkaramiśra\). Nonetheless, one should still keep an eye on the possibility of a ‘few interesting exceptions.’18

This list represents only the beginning of an exhaustive task to inventorying all the descriptions of Sūtrapāṭha MSS. Now, with the publication of NCC, volume 32, we are in the position of undertaking such a task, which may be considered the inauguration for a forthcoming critical edition. Forthcoming researchers, however, must be warned that some of the MSS are to be found in ‘Sammelhandschrift,’ 

therefore, they should look up for Vaiśeṣika MSS at different sections in the catalogues; other traditions could have well preserved the Vaiśeṣika sources for

different reasons either to combat its tenets or to profitably make use of its doctrine, as Jaina scholars did. 

**2.3 Locating and identifying the Vaiśeṣikasūtra MSS**

The description given by the entry Vaiśeṣikasūtra that NCC vol. 32 supplies and enables us to now trace the location of all known MSS on Sūtrapāṭha \(VS 

or Vaiśeṣikasūtra\), as well as all MSS on Vaiśeṣika commentaries that have been catalogued.19 The Illustration 3 \(Appendix\) has been made on the basis of the bibliography of MSS catalogues offered by NCC volume 28, pp. i–lxxxiv \(unless otherwise specified in the footnotes\). In addition, or, in the absence of these \(some of which I could not trace\), I have consulted other catalogues \(not mentioned by NCC vol. 28\) that give useful descriptions of Vaiśeṣika MSS 

that preserve Sūtrapāṭha both independently, as well as attached to different commentaries \(e.g. Tarkabhāṣā, Upaskāra\) or catalogued under other sections \(e.g. Nyāya\). The list of NCC abbreviations, locations, and serial numbers is a preliminary guide and incomplete, for I could not access all such catalogues. 

Yet, Indian readers with research in such centres and MSS libraries would do well to complete the table, read, photograph, and collate all such MSS, in view of what should become of the first critical edition of Vaiśeṣikasūtra \(Sūtrapāṭha\). The author of this edition possesses at present 6 such scanned MSS on Sūtrapāṭha. Should a forthcoming Vaiśeṣika scholar venture to collect and undertake such a critical edition of VS, then I would be more than happy to offer the MSS I collected from Bombay, Wai, Mysore, and Madras \(see their 

description in Section 2.2 of this introduction\), which will eventually spare the time and travels to South India. As far as Candrānanda’s Vṛtti is concerned, its 5 MSS on which it is based are indicated with bold. As for the reconstruction of Sūtrapāṭha, the approximate locations of such MSS are to be found in Illustration 3 \(see Appendix\). 

The list of MSS that has been given here represents only a point of departure. The Vaiśeṣikasūtra entry also includes ‘printed’ editions of Sūtrapāṭha \(Ptd.\) transmitted or included as it were in various ‘un-orthodox’ commentaries \(Sanskrit, Hindi\) of classical and post-colonial commentators, 20 most of which do not necessarily bother to preserve the ‘original’ Sūtrapāṭha, but rather supply, like Praśastapāda, their own personal interpretation of the system and its original Sūtrapāṭha tenets. 

[^19]:  For an expanded list of such catalogues, see volume 28 of NCC. This is, of course, incomplete, and represents only a starting point, as many other catalogues have been published since or simply have not been consulted by the Madras editors. Researchers should consult many other private and handwritten catalogues that are not open for viewing or consultation \(e.g. Srimaccarukirti Pandi-tacarya Jaina Bhandara Mutt, Śravaṇabeḷagoḷa; when I visited the site in August 2016, as a young decorate researcher, no permission had been granted for me to visit the MSS library\). 

[^20]:  Among classical and medieval commentators, the NCC entry mentions Praśastapāda, 

{{45}}

Such published commentaries are identifiable under various titles, 21 which are 

commentaries on either Sūtrapāṭha, Bhāṣya, or Independent \(eclectic\) tradition of Vaiśeṣika interpretation.22 Many such titles \(e.g. Padārthadharmasaṃgraha, Kiraṇāvalī\) send us to ‘additional descriptions’ \(Addl. MSS\) and refer to MSS 

on the commentaries themselves, not necessarily to an ‘independent Sūtrapāṭha tradition,’ which as I discussed here, must be traced and reconstructed in view of a forthcoming critical edition. 

**2.4 Date of Sūtrapāṭha**

The main contention upheld by Frauwallner and the Austrian school has been the many additions the Sūtrapāṭha suffered in the course of time. It has been repeat-edly maintained, even after the publication of VSc and its Sūtrapāṭha \(1961\), that the opening sūtras, as well as those sūtras related to mokṣa, did not exist in the original version of Sūtrapāṭha,23 and that they are a later addition to VS. More recently, this view has been challenged by scholars from the French and Japanese schools, 24 showing that the ancient form of VS we have in VSc, should not be regarded as unreliable. Houben, for instance, shows that Bhartṛhari \(5th century AD\) who chronologically preceded Praśastapāda \(6th century\), does indeed refer to the beginning sūtras of all known versions of the Sūtrapāṭha \(dharmaṃ 

vyākhyāsyāma iti\). 25 On the doctrine of the dimension of the soul, which changed in the early phase of the history of the system, Adachi points that these changes must have taken place very early, because Āryadeva's Catuhśataka \(the ninth chapter\) \(c.225 and 250 AD\) rejects the Vaiśeṣika doctrine of the activity in the eternal and all-pervasive soul, and reproduces accurately the sūtras 7.1.28–29 

from Sūtrapāṭha. Furthermore, in relation to this, VS 5.2.18–20 are sūtras that prove that both liberation \(mokṣa\) and transmigration \(saṃsāra\) are old concepts in the Vaiśeṣika system and that the sūtras in question had existed in the

[^23]: Wezler, 1982, pp. 663–74. 

[^24]:  Nozawa seems to be an exception within Franco-Japanese school; according to him the doctrine of an all-pervasive character of the soul is a late addition in Vaiśeṣika; he goes as far as to say that the whole of the seventh chapter of VS is a later addition, Nozawa, 1981, pp. 464–5. 

[^25]:  Houben, 1994, p. 718, informs us that Mallvadin, c. 550 AD, quotes a sutra, VS 9.12, which is traceable only in the Sūtrapāṭha of Candrānanda, therefore its Sūtrapāṭha must be the oldest we have. 



Sūtrapāṭha at least from the same time. 26 In philological studies, the external evidence discussed by Adachi and Houben represent solid proof for dating MSS. 

If Houben and Adachi are both right, then we have reason to suppose that the opening sūtras \(VS 1.1.1–3\), the soteriological sūtras \(VS 5.2.18–20\), and the ones about the all-pervasive soul \(VS 7.1.28–29\), all of which are fully preserved by Candrānanda’s commentary, are sufficient ground for the conjecture that most portions of Sūtrapāṭha we have are as old as the second century AD. This confirms once more the date of Jacobi on VS, which he supposes to be ‘as old as, or rather somewhat older than Nyāyasūtra and Brahmasūtra.’27 Hence, the date of some of the sūtras, the one we rely on for the doctrine of Vaiśeṣika’s soteriology, could be as early as 200 AD or even earlier. 

**2.5 Textual problems**

Although the style of VS and VSc is simple and straightforward, with a medium level of difficulty for translation, while the grammar and syntax do not pose major problems for translation, 28 the 1961 edition and its Sūtrapāṭha, as Thakur says, are based on MSS that ‘abound with scribal mistakes.’29 These have been dealt skilfully by Jambūvijayaji in the footnotes where he provides variant readings, and since then more work has been done by Ruzsa and Isaacson, who compared the variant reading of VS with other MSS, ‘A’ and ‘T,’ respectively.30 Since the 

materials on which they are based are rather poor, critical editions are always 

problematic.31 Since I am not fully trained in manuscriptology, nor is my method of research philological-historical, I should like to leave the ‘section of textual problems’ in the hands of more skilful scholars such as Isaacson and Ruzsa, who would take the trouble to compare the VS with other newly discovered MSS. 

Isaacson comes up with findings that are ‘interesting exceptions.’32 As far as this edition is concerned I will not deal with providing variant readings from the Sūtrapāṭha MSS I have photocopied and read throughout my trip to South India, 33 

but only philosophical and comparative conceptual observations. The philological discussion of this chapter only wished to follow the desideratum of Wezler 

[^26]:  Adachi, 1994, p. 659. 

[^27]:  Jacobi, 1911, p. 29, dates NS and BS composition between 200 and 450 AD. 

[^28]: Working on this translation, I came to the same conclusion as Isaacson does, 1995, p. 156: ‘the text is on the whole far less problematic than Bhaṭṭa Vādīndra’s commentary, dealt with in the previous part: the language is simpler, the thought is less convoluted and the textual transmission somewhat less defective.’

[^33]:  Although I have undergone a similar inquiry, by consulting 5 new MSS \(plus 1\), which I found and photographed at Wai, Mysore, Madras, and Bombay, yet none of them can provide a substantially different reading of the Sūtrapāṭha, particularly regarding those sūtras related to soteriology. 

{{47}}

and Isaacson, who urged the need to unearth and reconstruct a full picture of a possible ‘independent transmission’ of the Sūtrapāṭha.34 Despite difficult textual readings, as for instance VSc 5.2.14, fortunately, the 1961 Baroda edition is a good one. In the words of Isaacson:

MSS affiliations of Vaiśeṣika are easily determined and clear-cut; a fact that is indicative of a rather slender transmission, i.e. one with a relatively small number of manuscripts, and freedom from contamination. It should be noted in this connection that the manuscripts can be associated with a rather limited geographical area beyond which we have no evidence that Candrānanda’s 

commentary ever spread.35

Indeed, though Thakur says that none of the available versions of the sūtra-text is ‘absolutely correct,’ still he recognises that Candrānanda offers ‘a better text generally.’36 Nonetheless, any Vaiśeṣika scholar is required to look up the sources and must provide alternative MSS readings, as these could shed new light on our system’s doctrine. For the present edition, these alternative versions will be restricted only to Sūtrapāṭha which refer to the soteriology of the system. 

**2.6 Conclusion**

This 2-fold introductory chapter has provided, on the one hand, a short introduction to Indian philosophy and Vaiśeṣika to a non-specialist audience, and on the other hand, gave Indologists a thematic overview of VSc and its MSS preservation. Although a great deal of textual critical work has been done so far by Jambūvijayaji, Thakur, Nozawa, Honda,37 Isaacson, and Ruzsa, a new critical edition of VSc remains a desideratum. This is more urgently the case because Jambūvijayaji did not take into consideration for his edition the publication of 3 extant MSS on VSc: J \(J s, J \) and Ś both of which are from BORI, as well as 2

AD. It belonged to the eminent Jain scholar Muni Shri Puṇyavijayajī. All my critical textual observations will be made on the basis of their reading of such MSS 

made by my predecessors \(Ruzsa, Isaacson, etc.\), while for Sūtrapāṭha, I shall bring into the discussion reading variations of my own newly photographed MSS, described earlier. Whatever the variations might be, it is unlikely they can change

substantially the current understanding we have on the Vaiśeṣika system or its 

‘controversial’ doctrines such as soteriology. What follows, however, is a translation with notes that pertain to World philosophy at large and aims to illuminate the problems related to ontology from a Western–Eastern comparative perspective. 

As mentioned in the first section of this introduction, philosophy is a global affair, therefore, Indian philosophy must play a clarifying role in this.
