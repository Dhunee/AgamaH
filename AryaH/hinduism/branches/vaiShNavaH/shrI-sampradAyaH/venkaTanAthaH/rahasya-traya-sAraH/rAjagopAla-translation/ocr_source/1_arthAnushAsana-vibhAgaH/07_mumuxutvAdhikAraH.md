(7) THE CHAPTER ON THE ASPIRATION 

FOR MUKTI. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Who, indeed, is there that will bear the bondage of saṁsāra -- who that has understood the revolutions of time, the nature of matter (prakriti) and its evolutes or modifications which cause contraction of knowledge, the evils attendant on the enjoy. ment of the pleasures of this world and of svarga, the experience of sufferings resulting from sia which resemble & pit of fire, the true relationship that exists necesgarily between himself and the Supreme Being, the region of divine bliss and also the nature of the body which is like a prison-house ? 

Thus, from the Sāstras which treat of the soul, a man should understand the principles and truths explained so far. He should know clearly that the soul or selt is self-luminous or luminous by itself, is a knower, doer and enjoyer having a body and that the goal is atomic, eternal, without parts or limbs, incapable of being cut, burnt, injured, dried up or otherwise affected and that its essential nature is such as not to admit of increase or diminution and that, in all these respects, it is different from the body, the senses and the like which are attributes of the self. With the conviction that the soul or self is capable of passing op into another world and taking up another body, the man learos, in a general way, that it is possible for him to have higher aims or goals than those found in this world. He is full of dread at the thought of falling into hell and the like or experiencing the sufferings of another life and abstains from those actions which are the causes thereof. He is also convinced that he is different from Īśvara in that while be is supported and controlled by Īśvara and exists solely for the fulllment of His purposes and is besides weak, atomic and subject to ignorance, doubts, errors, sufferings and the like, being the abode of impurities, Īśvara, of whom his self is an attribute, is, in every one of these respects, absolutely the opposite. From this

knowledge he becomes fit to desire the glory due to his essential nature (of rendering service to Bhagavan). He then realises the most important truths from the Tirumantra which is a concise summary of all that is needed. By an understanding of the signi. ficance of the third letter in its first word aum, namely, m, he realises that the self is essentially Jnana or knowledge in its nature (and has knowledge algo as an attribate.) By this realisation be gives up the notion of 'I' in regard to the body ((i.e.) mistaking the body for 'I') and of 'mine' in regard to those things that are connected with the body. Similarly from the dative or the fourtha case of the first syllable a where the dative termination has been dropped ((i.c.) from aya), we should learn that the Jiva exists for Īśvara and thereby, corapletely and without any trace, give up the erroneous notion implicit and explicit in the words 'I' and 'mine' in regard to the following the aotion of 'I' in regard (even) to the soul as distinct from the body, that it is s'esha to oneself and the notion of 'mine' in regard to the attributes of the soul (such as this jnāna is mine). In this connection we should remember. (Bhattar's) śloka (written in the form of an imagi. Dary dialogue between Īśvara and the Jiva which reads 46 follows:-) 

"Bhagavān: You are mine. 

The Jiva : I exiet (only) for myself. Bhagavān: Where is it stated ? The Jīva: Where is the opposite stated ? 

Bhagavān: In the original pranāna : the Veda. The Jiva: The opposite view is based on the strength of 

my own enjoyment of myself from begianing less time. 

Bhagavin: But protests have been recorded then and there. The Jiva : Where is it objected to ? and by whora?' CHAPTER 

Bhagavān: The protest or objection was made in such 

works as the Gita and it was made by me. 

The Jiva: 

Is there any witness ? 

Bhagavānı: The wise man. 

The Jiva : 

But he is an interested witness. 

Thus in this dispute between Bhagavan and the Jiva, the need arises for an arbitrator." 

With a knowledge of the meaning of u in aum, which means 'only', we should root out the notion of 'I' in thinking "I am the sesha of others (those other than Bhagavan) and the notion of \*nride' in thinking, "Another (and not Bhagavan ) is my s'eshi." By an understanding of the negation contained in the middle word (viz. namo, na mama ) which declares that there is no such thing as independence for the Jiva, we should rid ourselves of the notion of 'I' in thinking that in respect of the means of securing one's own protection, one is wholly independent' and the notion of 'mine' in thinking that this act or activity for securing protection is unconditionally 'one's.' By the force of this very negation (na mama ), we should give up erroneous notions that may exist in regard to the fruit (of the upāya), which consists in fature enjoyment (in Vaikuṇṭha) extending up to the service of the Lord, which is the meaning of the dative in the third word (Nārāyanāya) - erroneous notions of 'I' in thinking on the analogy of other fruits enjoyed here (in this world), "I will be the independent doer” and “I will be the enjoyer subject to no one else " and "mine" in thinking "I do this for myself" and "I enjoy this for myself". (These notions of 'I' and 'mine' in varied situa tions should be completely rooted out by considering the meanings, implicit and explicit, in the several words of the Tirumantra.) Thus ope should become well established in right knowledge and should say to oneself in the words of the Alwars . " Having

'enjoyed the pleasures of sense and found them petty, I have now given them up and found relief." "The pleasures of the five senses in seeing, hearing, touching, spelling and tasting and, so also, the unlimited but inferior enjoyment of one's own self (ātmānubhava), which is not capable of being realised by the sepses, have been given up by me.” “When He is gracious, what is there difficult of attainment? I have had enough of dharma, artha and kama. They are petty." "The 'fruits obtained by these weak.minded men are temporary and end after & short time.' "Having come into this world which is not eternal and is full of misery, seek me as your refage." "Having heard of those who were mighty and valiant and of those who had immense treasures of wealth and who, after the lapse of some time, bave left nothing bebind them but tales of their lives, the wise man never considers as 'his', sons, wives, houses, land and the like, nor Wealth". "The 'world is all misery”. “Even in Svarga, since there is fear of a fall after the expiry of the ordained period, there is no bappiness". "It is only fools who banker after kingdoms, thinking that they are theirs. Men like me never long for them, because they are not intoxicated by the strong liquor of egotism the sense of 'I')." "From the mansion of Brahma downwards, O sage, these evils exist; therefore the wise never desire the attaia. ment of Svarga." "Above the mansion of Brahma, there lies the supreme world of Vishou, which is pure, eternal, full of supreme splendour and is called 'the Supreme Brabman. Fools, deluded by the pleasures of the senses and tormented by vanity, covetousness, arrogance, anger, perfidy and delusion never go to that world. Only good men without possessiveness and egotism, who remain indifferent to the pairs of opposites (like

pleasare and pain, heat and cold and the like), who have full control over their senses, and who are devoted to Yogic meditation go there." "In that world are beautiful vimanas (airsbips) which can travel as they please, Assembly halls, gardens of varied kinds, O king, and, likewise lotus tanks, full of pellucid water.” “ 18Com pared with that world of the Supreme Being, these lower worlds (of Brahma and Indra) are like hell." From these and other sayings, the Jiva should realise the seven kinds of evil inherent in the enjoyment of non-sentient things, viz. their littleness, their instability, their origin in pain, their being mingled with pain, their resulting ultimately in pain, their origin being due to a perverse egotism and their being opposed to the bliss which is his nature. He should also realise such of these evils as are inherent in the enjoyment of one's self, ātmānubhava. He should then realise, with clear vision, the unique character of the enjoyment of of the bliss of Bhagavan, which, in every one of these respects, is opposed to them. He would then attain the condition of "one who longs eagerly for the Supreme Being and who, consequently, is averse from things that are other than the Supreme Being. He would then abstain from activity whose characteristics Brahma is 16 said to have described (as leading to fruits other than Mokṣa ) and embrace renunciation whose characteristics are said to have been described by the 'sage Narāyaṇa (as leading to Mokṣa). It is only men of this type that can be described as competent aspirants for mukti. Even if a man knows clearly wbat is high and what is low among the tatvas and what is high and what is low among the aims and objects desired as the goal of life as explained above, if he does not adopt the upāya which can becore the supreme goal of life, after acquiring & distaste for other pleasures (vairāgya), he will be an object of ridicule like the dog whose tail does not hide its private parts nor drives flies and mosquitoes. His learning will be of no use to him. 80 has it been said :

THE ASPIRATION FOR MUKTI 

"Learning is "fruitful when it leads to purity of character and of conduct:" "The 18 Sastras have been enjoined by wise men for securing serenity of mind. Therefore only he who has attained serenity of mind should be considered as having a knowledge of all the sāstras". Therefore, "men "should conduct themselves in a manner which will be in keeping with their age, with the duties which they undertake, with their goal in life, with their learning, and with their birth, so that their appearance, speech and action are all alike" - it is only these that will secure the glory described in passages like the following: when & man performs bis duties, he is lauded by others. "The gods consider him as a Brahmin who is clad in whatever rags he can obtain, eats whatever food comes to him and has his bed wherever he can find it;" " The gods\* bow to him (who is free from the pairs of opposites, who has no attachment to anything in life and who ever delights in doing good to all beings"). TAMIL VERSE: 

The wise man longs for Mokṣa, which is the supreme goal or aim of life, having conquered the senses by the grace of those ācāryas who bave taught him of the eternal bliss of holding the feet of Bhagavan, who stands ever ready to redeem him, of the sea of samsara whose essential nature is to perish and of that which is good and that which is evil. SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

There may be born somewhere in this world some one who, being lucky and wise and desirous of obtaining release from saṁsāra, gives up the pleasures of external objects which are like honey mixed with poison and who, being averse, also, to the limited delight of realising or experiencing his self (atmānubhava), longs for the enjoyment of the infinite bliss of Brahman.
