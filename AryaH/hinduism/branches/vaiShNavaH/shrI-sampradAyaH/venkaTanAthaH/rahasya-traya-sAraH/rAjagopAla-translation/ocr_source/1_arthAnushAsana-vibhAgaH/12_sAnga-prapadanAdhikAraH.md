(12) THE CHAPTER ON THE PERFORMANCE 

OF PRAPATTI WITH ITS ANGAS. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When & desired object is incapable of attainment by oneself and by other upāyas, prapatti is the placing of the responsibility or burden of securing it in somebody who is capable of doing go with a request or supplication. It is declared to be the specific thought such as (the following): "This object should be accom. plished (for me) by you without my making any effort of my own hereafter." 

THE NATURE OF THE ANGI: 

In this upāya ( consisting of angł and angas ) to be adopted by the seeker after mokṣa, the angī is the surrender of one's self or ātmā with a clear anderstaadiog tbat, neither in the prapatti nor in the fruit thereof, one has any independence; it should be in the same way as one would surrender a jewel belonging to another to that person bimself to be kept safe by him and to be worn by him. 

That is ;--- one should realise that, in relation to the Lord of all who appears in the base and the suffix of the first letter in the pranava (i.e.) a which means Īśvara and the suffix of the dative or fourth case which has been dropped (ie) aya (for the Lord of all) as the protector of all and the seshi of all, one has no interest or connection at all in the activity of protecting one-self or those related to one-self and also in what results from the protection of oneself and those related to oneself, either as depending upon one. self or as bringing about some results for oneself. It is the specific form of thought that one is s'esha to the Lord and is entirely de. pendent apon the Lord - in this, the most important feature is surrendering the responsibility of protection (bharanyasa ) to the Lord. 

128 OHAPTER 

THE MANNER IN WHICH BHARANYASA 

SHOULD BE PERFORMED: The manner in which this form of mental realisation contain ed in the injunction "One 'should surrender one's self to me" should be effected is as follows:- The person should realise this within biniself: viz., "I am absolutely dependent (upon the Lord); I am His s'esha and exist only for Him. My s'eshatva does not belong to anybody else and has no dependence on any. body else. Therefore Īśvara who is the seshi and who is inde. pendent should protect me for the fulfilment of His own purposes. As is said in the śloka : "Even my self!A or ātmā does not belong to me; (if & man should consider what does not belong to him as his, he could consider the whole earth as his )'; my soal does not belong to me, it does not belong to anyone else (than Bhagavan), I do not belong to myself, por can I say that any thing belongs to me unconditionally. As stated in the śloka -" The embodied being who is like a lump of clay and is entirely dependent on the Lord) is not able to protect himself; how can be protect others ?', I am incapable of protecting myself and those who are said to be mine, independently (of the Lord) or for the sake of myself as the main person interested in it." Just as the wise Uparicharvasu Balways felt that bis soul, bis kingdom, bis wealth, his wife, and his vehicles were all for Bhagavan, we should also say, "I and what is mine are His. The responsibility of protecting these is also that of the Lord who is the universal Protector" for it is said : " the surrender of the responsibility for one's self and of what is one's is called ütmanikṣepa." " There is no one other than Bhagavan who is capable of affording protection ". The fruit of this protection should also be considered primarily His, for it has been said, "Ārmas nikṣept consists (also) in giving up all rela. tionship to the fruit resulting from His protection and surrender ing it (vix the fruit) to Kesava "who is the chief beneficiary". 1.

PERFORMANCE OF PRAPATTI 

129 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

To all seekers of mokṣa (whether bhaktas or prapannas), the surrender of one's svarüpa or self and the rest (i.e) the fruit in common. To one who has no other upāya ((i.e.) prapannā) and is therefore akinchand, the surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharanyása ) is an additional angi. To all prapannas, whatever may be the object desired by them, the surrender of the responsibility is cominon. To those prapannas who are desirous of (only) mokṣa, the surrender of one's self or svartipa and also of the fruit arising therefrom is an additional (requirement). 

IS WARA IS THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY : 

If it is asked how, when the Jiva who performs prapatti as the upāya for the sake of some gain or fruit is the person interes. ted in the fruit, Īśvara becomes the chief beneficiary, the answer is as follows:-Īśvara becomes the chief beneficiary, because, just like the modifications of acit or matter, the benefits (purushār. thas) granted by Him to cit (jiva) are pleasing to Him. Being the seshi of all, He is the chief beneficiary. To a man of culti vated tastes, who is not in need of anything, the delight in melting dolls made of metals and shaping them into ornaments and wear. ing them in admiration of their beauty is not different (in kind) from the delight enjoyed by him in keeping & sentient being like a parrot in a cage and feeding it with milk and seeing it fly accord ing to His pleasure. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA 

Tuerefore, ātmasamarpanam (the surrending of the self to the Lord for protection) means here the realisation of the self as existing solely for the purpose of the Saviour and that to such an extent that the self feels no further responsibility, whatever, for its own protection and this should be accompanied by the knowledge that the fruits of such surrender are not one's own. 

180 CHAPTER 

The purport of the śloka in Alavandar's Stotra (52) which says "Whatever I may be in the body, the senses and the like, and whatever may be the qualities of my Dature, I who know that I am Thy sesha hereby surrender myself at this very moment at thy two lotus-like feet" -- the purport of this śloka is as follows: 

If a man has (somehow) come into possession of a cloth bag with the king's seal op it, he would return the bag (to the king), even though he does not know for certain the nature and character of the gem contained within it, in the hope that the king would take it back. So also even those who have not the intelligence to know, with perfect clearness, the nature, character and state of the soul as distinguished from the body may surrender their self or soul with the little knowledge that they possess. If they do so, even for that much, Bhagavan will be prepared to remit the punishment for the theft consisting in making away with one's self (i. e. clain ing it as one's own) from beginningless time. This idea contained in the sāstras is what (Alavandar) has in mind. In the next \*śloka (53) it might appear as if he revoked the surrender (made before); but its meaning is only this : Even when & person is bent on sorren. dering his self without a knowledge of such things as the nature of bis self, if he surrendere it with the notion that it is his owo, like the presentation to a king of something belonging to oneself, it would not completely put an end to the crime of having stolen one's self. It does not mean that Alavandar considered his self. surrender made in śloka 52 in accordance with the injunctions contained in the sāstras, as having been made in ignorance. 

So from these two ślokas, it is clear that the essence of the sāstras which priiparily prescribe bharasamarpanam as in the words of Alavandar (60) "The responsibility of protecting me is also Thine", consists in saying "a mania “It is not mine" and getting rid of the feeling of ope's connection (with everything), though one may not have & true and discriminatory knowledge about such things as the essential nature of the self. 

NOTE: "However O lord, what can I surrender to Thee, O Madhava, when I know that I and whatever belongs to me are always thine. As I have notbing of my own, I have nothing to surrender, I am only giving Thee what belongs to Thec",

THE MEANING OF THE ANGI IN DVAYAM : 

Thus in the first part of the Dvaya which deals with the upāya or means, the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility (for one's protection) accompanied by the thought that one is s'esha to the Lord and exists only for Him is to be understood in connection with the verb (prapadye) joined with the word s'aranam which treats of the upāya preceded by supreme faith ( mahavisvāsa ) and which contains within it, in an implicit form, the sapplication for protection. 

Thus (from what has been said in this chapter and in the foregoing chapters ), although these six (the five angas and the angī) may be understood separately, while considering, in detail, the meaning of each part of the sentence, yet they constitute only a single mental act while anderstanding the whole sentence, just like the understanding of other sentences having several parts. Therefore, in accordance with the s'astras, this principal action with its angas is performed only once. 

PRAPATTI IS A MOMENTARY ACTION. 

An archer's action in discharging an arrow for bitting a target may be constituted of several separate acts (like observing the object, taking the aim and discharging the arrow) and yet it is all accomplished in a single moment. Similar is the act of sarren. dering (to the Lord) the responsibility of (one's) protection. This is evident from the sruti itself. (The sruti says, "\* Pra nava (aum) is the bow: the soul or self is the arrow; it must be discharged at Brahman, which is the target, with great care and with keen concentration ". 

That this surrender of the responsibility of protection (bhara. samarpana) should be chiefly thought of while uttering the 

. 

\* Mundaka Upanishad II-4132 OHAPTER 

mantras of prapatti is clearly stated as follows in Satyaki tantra by the Saviour Himself, who undertakes the responsibility: "With this mantra one sbould surrender one's self to me. The one who has surrendered to me the responsibility of doing what should be done will become one who has done one's daty." 

A BRIEF STATEMENT OF WHAT BHARASAMARPANA IS: 

In (the performance of) this (angī), the conclusion regarding the adoption of this upāya with its angas is as follows it consiste in the act of surrendering the responsibility for the protection of one's self preceded by the following:--the giving up of the thought that one is the doer (for it is the Lord that does everything), the giving up of the thought of 'mine' (that there is anything belong ing to oneself), the giving up of the fruit of the action, the giving ap of the thought that he himself adopts the means for obtaining that fruit; these must be accompanied by anukūlya saṅkalpa, pratiktlyavarjana and the rest and, likewise, reverent bowing down to the succession of gurus and with the utterance of Dvaya. The surrender of the responsibility for the protection of one's self carries with it implicity the surrender of one's Svarupa or self and the fruit or gain arising from it. 

The giving up of the thought that one is the doer will result from the realisation of one's entire dependance on the Lord throughout the existence of the soul. This will make one know that this doership has been vouchsafed to one by the Lord Hiinself. 

The giving up of the thought of "MINE' (mama) and of the fruit (of prapatti) will arise from the knowledge that one, as well 88 what belongs to one, exists, by one's very nature, solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of Bhagavan alone. 

The giving up of the upāya for attaining the fruit (mokṣa) will result from & knowledge that the prapatti performed by a man for winning the grace of the Saviour cannot directly and immediately be the cause of the main fruit, namely, mokṣa, that

prapatti is non-sentient and, therefore, incapable of possessing the will to grant the fruit and that only Īśvara is the upāya for this fruit (mokṣa). Since Bhagavad who, out of the love natural to Him, has been the primeval cause of everything from the time of giving the man the body and the senses to the time of his utter. ing the Duaya-since Bhagavan is possessed of the will accompanied by the desire to show His grace and is the immediate and direct cause of the final fruit, vix mokṣa) and since he also stands Himself in the place of the prescribed upāya in the case of the man who is incapable of (adopting) other upāyas, He alone is the upāya for the fruit. The authority for this conclusion is the nature of the object, (namely, Bhagavan) es understood from the s'āstra which reveals the Person who has that nature and this authority cannot be challenged by reason. 

NADATHUR AMMĀL'S SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF 

PRAPATTI : 

The following is a summary of the performance of prapatti with its angas as given by Sri Nadathur Ammal: 

"I have been wandering in samsāra by doing, from beginning less time, what is displeasing to Thee. From this day onwards, I will do what is pleasing (to Thee). I will not do what will displease (Thee). I have no capital with which to attain Thee, I have made up my mind to seek only Thee as the upāya. Be Thou my upāya! Hereafter, either in the removal of what is evil or in the attainment of what is good, I have no further responsibility from now onwards". In this the determination to do what is pleasing and abstinence from what is displeasing have to be stated only once as accessories or angas to the upāya. His acting later in accordance with this determination to do what is pleasing etc. will be the result or fruit of the upāya and will last as long as bis self lasts. If, in accordance with the words of Sri Ammal, we take the avoidance of what is displeasing as meaning only the determi. nation to avoid what is displeasing, it is evident that it has to be made only once (i.c at the time of prapatti). It is true that it has 

134 OR APTER 

been said :-"I have dissociated myself from sids which cast one into samsāra." (But it may be explained in this way :-) The avoidance of what is displeasing may meen either having no connection (at all) with it (i...) giving it up or the determination to avoid it. In either case, this is, at the first iostant, an anga and the actual avoidance is the result or fruit of prapatti which follows afterwards. This holds good also in regard to visvāsa or faith. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Doing what is pleasing (to the Lord) and avoiding what is displeasing (in one's life after prapatti) are the result of meritorious deeds done in the past, and also the determination made at the time of performing prapatti. 

Therefore wise are they who perform prapatti in order to render faultless service during their life-time and to attain mokṣa after casting off the body resulting from prārabdha karma, 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Our princely Acharyas, who wear the crown of proficiency in the Vedas, have placed us for protection under the feet of the Lord, who, from beginningless time, has resolved, in His great compassion, to save us; they have done so in order that there may be no further responsibility in ourselves (for our protection), by saying to us, "Do not forget the truth that the Lord, who is the sool of the world, will protect you who are related to Him as s'esha (existing solely for His purposes)," 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The horse, the chariot and the charioteer -- the end of the Vedas (the Upanishads) shows that the three tattvas, cit, acit, and

Īśvara are related to one another respectively like the thres mentioned above and have always had varied activities in accordance with their respective nature. In connection with these activities, all the three are of the nature of being the material) causes; two, cit and Īśvara, are of the nature of doers, and ope (1.) Īśvara is alone independent (of all others). Therefore the jiva, kbe responsibility for whose protection has been undertaken by Īśvara who is the Master, is carefree and has no further responsibility of his own in the matter of his protection.
