(5) THE CHAPTER ON THE THREE 'REALS'  (OR TATVAS) page107



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:



प्रकृत्यात्मभ्रान्तिर्गलति चिदचिल्लक्षणधिया  
तथा जीवेशैक्यप्रभृतिकलहस्तद्विभजनात् ।  
अतो भोक्ता भोग्यं तदुभयनियन्तेति निगमै  
र्विभक्तं नस्तत्वत्रयमुपदिशन्त्यक्षतधियः ॥ १४ ॥



The delusion that the soul is nothing but the body and the senses (_prakṛti_) disappears when one has a knowledge of the distinctive features of sentient beings and non-sentient things. So also the disputes on such questions as the unity of the _jīva_ and God will no longer continue, when the characteristic features of each of them are marked out. Our _ācārya_ s, whose wisdom never failed, teach us about the existence of three realities (_Tattva_s) classified in the s'āstrās as the experiencing subjects (bhoktā), the objects of experience and enjoyment (bhogyam) and He who rules over both of them (_Iśvara_).



CLASSIFICATION OF TATVAS OR REALS AND ITS USE:



It may be asked why the ācāryas should state that the three tatvās or 'reals' should be specially prescribed for the study of those who seek _mokṣa_ , when they form only a part of the six things that should be known, namely, the five truths arthapanchaka and the relationship of soul and body (which exists between God and the world). The answer is as follows: It is necessary to root out the delusion that the body is the atma and that the _jīva_ is independent (of the Lord), as well as the view that there is no God, which is the cause of that delusion, for these are great obstacles to _mokṣa_.



The sāstrās, therefore, divide Reality into three classes ; the experiencing subject, the object of experience or enjoyment, and the Ruler who controls and directs them. Among them, non-sentient things which are the objects of experience are of three kinds (1) _Prakṛti_ or matter which has the three qualities of sattvam, rajas and tamas (2) Kala or time and (3) Śuddha Satvam, the substance of which the transcendental region beyond matter called Vaikuṇṭha   is made. The nature of (1) _Prakṛti_ has been thus described :-"It is [^f134] non-sentient (achetana). It exists (always) for others and it is eternal, but subject always to change or modification. It has three qualities sattvam, rajas and tamas and is the field of action (_karma_) for the _jīva_". The nature of (2) Kala or time is described thus :- " _Bhagavān_ [^f135] Kala (i.e.) Time, which is the body of _Bhagavān_, has no beginning nor end." "It takes [^f136] the forms of such divisions as kalaa and muhoortha which are respectively 1-3/8 minutes and 1/30th part of a day (and is the cause of the modifications of matter). But it causes no change or modification in the transcendental world (Aprākritaloka) beyond matter". The nature of the transcendental world beyond matter is such that it is made of s'uddha sattvam. The world [^f137] made of it is of the nature of _jñāna_ and bliss. God controls time there ; time is not the [^f138] cause of any change or modification in the world of Śuddha-sattvam (as it is in the world of matter). Thus the nature of _Prakṛti_, Kāla and Śuddha sattva which belong to three classes of non-sentient things (achetana), has been described.

NOW FOR THE EXPERIENCING SUBJECT OR _JĪVA_:



"The jivātma is [^f139] neither a god nor a man"; "He is  [^f140] neither a god nor a man”. (That is: These distinctions are based only on the respective bodies, whereas the soul within has no such distinctions.) The _jīva_ is of three kinds :- Baddha or the soul in bondage is called in the Gita " Kshara" (because he is in contact with matter which is subject to change) All beings[^f141] (from _Brahma_ to the blade of grass) are 'Ksharas' or Baddhas. The _mukta_ or the soul which has obtained release from contact with matter is no longer subject to change and is called akshara or Kootastha (because it is imputable). The third class of _jīva_s are the Sūris[^f142] who are described as seeing eternally the transcendental world beyond matter. The third class of "Real' is _Iśvara_ who has been thus described :- He is all ;[^f143] He knows all; He sees all; He possesses all strength, all knowledge, all power, all wealth : He is without fatigue, without lassitude, without fear, without anger, without desire and other such (blemishes). Thus has the nature of _Iśvara_ been taught,

Thus the three realities consist of the Ruler and the Ruled (the latter including _prakṛti_ and the sentient beings) and our _ācārya_ s (Śrī Yāmunācārya and Śrī Rāmānuj_ācārya_) have stated this concisely in the words "(_Iśvara_)[^30] on whom depend the essential nature (_svarūpa_), the continuance (sthiti) and the activity (_pravṛtti_) of the three kinds of sentient beings and of non-sentient things with all their differences". The three kinds of sentient beings are those that are in bondage (_baddha_), those that have obtained release (_mukta_) and those that are eternally free (_nitya_). The three kinds of non-sentient things are _Prakṛti_ with its three qualities (sattvam, rajas and tamas). Time, and Śuddhasattvam. The essential nature (_svarūpa_) means the substance or thing which is defined by attributes peculiar and unique to it. Continuance (sthiti, means continuance of the thing or object in time. This is eternal for eternal things. In the case of non-eternal things, this continuance is subject to expansion and contraction in accordance with the will of _Iśvara_. Activity or _pravṛtti_ includes action and abstention from action. All these three : the essential nature (_svarūpa_), the continuance in time (sthithi) and the activity (_pravṛtti_) are seen (by perception and other pramaņas) to be different in the case of each thing or object,

[^30]:
Alavandar: Atmasiddhi and Rāmānuja’s Vaikuṇṭha gadyam.




When the _pramāṇa_s or sources of knowledge (like perception and inference) reveal an object or thing, they disclose the essential Nature or _svarūpa_ of the object, the attributes that define it, the (other) qualities of the object so defined and also its activities. The essential nature is always revealed as endowed with the attributes that define it. It is not possible to speak of the essential nature of a thing (_svarūpa_) except in terms of the respective attributes. To speak of an object minus its attributes would be as meaningless as to speak of a hare's horns.



THE NATURE OF THE _JĪVA_.



Therefore the essential nature (_svarūpa_) of the _jīva_ may be described as _jñāna_ (knowledge), bliss (ānanda), (amala) being pure, and being atomic (anu) in terms of its defining attributes (i. e.) being of the nature of knowledge, being of the nature of bliss, being pure and being atomic. This reality, viz. the _jīva_ is always _śeṣa_ to _Iśvara_ (i.e.) it exists only for _Iśvara_ and it is unconditional _śeṣa_ only to Him. Thus its existing (always) for the Lord is affirmed (ayogavyavaccheda) and also its existing for no other than the Lord (anya yogavyavaccheda). This quality of being _śeṣa_ to the Lord, which is disclosed in the first word of Tiru_mantra_, namely om (_aum_), is of the nature of a  relationship ( sambandha) and requires, therefore, a thing having that relationship and cannot be understood without it. So this _śeṣatva_ may be called an additional quality of a thing, namely, the _jīva_, which has already been defined by its defining attributes. Here the definition of the _jīva_ is that it is a thing which is sentient while being also atomic. Similarly the _jīva_ may also be defined as a thing which is sentient while being also, by its nature, _śeṣa_. So this quality of being _śeṣa_ may also be called an attribute which defines the thing, viz, the _jīva_. Similarly _Iśvara_ may be defined as having sentience along with omnipresence (vibhu). He may also be defined as one that is absolutely independent of everything else, while being the unconditional seshin (i.e.) one for whom all other things exist (unconditionally). The class of atmas which includes _jīva_s and _Iśvara_ may be defined as those that are sentient and pratyak (i.e.) which are subjective and have inwardness. To be sentient is to be the possessor of knowledge. To be subjective or inward (or pratyak) is to possess luminosity to oneself. The atmā or soul is self-luminous and shines as I' without the help of the attributive knowledge [^f145] (_dharmabhūta _ _jñāna_)[^31] . Since sentience and inwardness (pratyaktva) are common to both _jīva_s and _Iśvara_, the _jīva_ has to be defined as having, in addition, dependance by its very nature (on _Iśvara_). In the aṣṭākṣara, in the dative of the first syllable (āya) a in _aum_ (om), the _jīva_'s existence for the fulfilment of _Iśvara_'s purposes is stated without any condition; therefore the _jīva_ is unconditionally and absolutely dependent upon the Lord of Śrī (Lakṣmī ), who is the universal Saviour. This statement of the absolute relationship between the _jīva_ and _Iśvara_ throughout the existence (of the former ) is called ayogavyavaccheda or denial of the non-existence of the relationship. The second syllable u in _aum_ (om) in _aṣṭākṣara_ means 'only' and brings out the idea that the _jīva_ exists for the purposes of only _Iśvara_ and denies his dependence or existence for the sake of any others. This denial is called anya-yogavyavaccheda or denial of (the _jīva_'s ) relationship with others. We will show later that this _śeṣa_tva extends from the Lord to His devotees as well. The activity of sentient beings consists in their being the doers and the enjoyers subject to _Iśvara_'s will and purpose. Since this activity and this capacity for enjoyment are given to them by Him, they are for His purposes and not their own.

[^f145]: The soul is of the nature of jñāna or knowledge (i.c.) its _svarūpa_ is knowledge. At the same time the soul has knowledge as an attribute and this jñāna or knowledge is called Dharma bhuta jñāna or attributive knowledge.*

jñāna or attributive knowledge.




BADDHAS :



The difference between sentient beings that are in bondage and others consists in the former having _avidyā_ (ignorance), _karma_, the impressions left by past _karma_ (vāsana) the inclinations due to them (ruchi or taste for worldly enjoyment) and association with _prakṛti_ or matter. The differences existing mutually among _jīva_s in respect of knowledge, pleasures and the like may be seen in the groups of _jīva_s r_aṅgī_ng from _Brahma_ to a blade of grass.



These bound souls support bodies given to them by _Iśvara_ in accordance with their respective _karma_, both by their essential nature (_svarūpa_) as _jñāna_ and by their attributive knowledge (dharına bhūta _jñāna_). The support given to the body by the essential nature (_svarūpa_) serves to make it exist. The support given to it by the attributive knowledge or _dharma_bhūtā_jñāna_, while in such states as waking, serves to enable the body to be useful for securing the ends or goal of life and for adopting the means to secure these ends. In the case of the supreme devotee who has already adopted the means of attaining _mukti_, the support given by attributive knowledge makes the body useful for the enjoyment of _Bhagavān_ and for rendering service to Him. In the case of sinners, this support given to the body is productive of adverse experiences. When the _jīva_ leaves the body, the latter undergoes disintegration, The constituent substances of the body into which it disintegrates (such as the five elements) remain the body of _Iśvara_. As regards continuance in time (sthiti), the specific character of souls in bondage, as distinguished from others, is continuous association with the body until _mukti_. As regards activities, these _jīva_s in bondage have three kinds: puṇya, papa and that which is neither of these two.



MUKTAS:



The difference between released souls and others is that the former have attained their essential nature in a manifest condition by the removal of obstacles. As regards their continuance in time (sthiti), their distinctive feature consists in this their essential Nature (_svarūpa_), which has become manifest, will continue to be so without any end. Among souls that have attained _mukti_ or release, the mutual difference is their having attained the manifestation of their essential nature earlier or later. The difference in their activities consists in specific kinds of service to the Lord chosen by each and prompted by love, which has resulted from the perfect enjoyment of _Bhagavān_ gained after the loss of it from time immemorial.



_NITYA_S:



The specific and distinctive feature of the _nitya_s (the eternally free) is that the manifestation of their essential nature (_svarūpa_) is without any beginning and also their absolute dependence (on the Lord): The specific feature of their continued existence in time is that their enjoyment of the [^f146] _śeṣī_[^32]  is beginningless. Since this is common to all _nitya_s, there is no mutual difference between their respective states of continuous existence in time. The difference in their activities consists in the continu ous performance of specific kinds of service to the Lord from beginningless time which, though different, yet form a continuous stream of service. It has been said that such _nitya_s as Ananta (_Śeṣa_ ) and Garuḍa hold certain specific offices and perform specific kinds of service in due relation to them. If so, it may be asked, how it would be possible to reconcile this with the statement (made by Śrī _Rāmānuja_ in the _Gadya_) that _nitya_s (the eternally free) and muktas (who have attained _mokṣa_ ) have all access to all kinds of service. The answer is that they are not barred from any form of service which is pleasing to them and is in accordance with the will of the Lord and that no one of them ever desires to render the forms of service which have been specially marked off for others. Besides, the service rendered by any one of them is as pleasing to the Lord as that done by others; therefore the service rendered by any one of them gives the same pleasure of service to all of them. There is no difference in the delight which results from the service as its fruit. Hence there is nothing unreasonable in stating that all of them have access to every form of service.

_DHARMABHŪTA _JÑĀNA[^33]

(Attributive knowledge).

[^33]:
According to Viśiṣṭādvaitins, the self or atma is,in its essential nature or _svarūpa_, knowledge. It also possesses jñāna or knowledge as its dharma or attribute." This knowledge is called dharma bhuta jñāna or attributive knowledge. (See foot-note before the previous foot-note)


To all these ātmās or souls, in the same way as their essential nature (_svarūpa_) is that of a substance, their attributive knowledge (_dharma_bhūtājñāna) is also a substance. Its essential nature has not been separately referred to in the [^f148] passage[^34] because of its having been included as an attribute to the soul.

[^f148]: the passage which refers to the three kinds of achetana in Alavandar’s Atmasiddhi and Rāmānuja’s Vaikuṇṭhagadyam .)*


[^34]:
the passage which refers to the three kinds of achetana in Alavandar’s Ātmasiddhi and Rāmānuja’s Vaikuṇṭhagadyam.


This attributive knowledge is luminous by itself to the soul which possesses it, while revealing objects. That is, when the attributive knowledge reveals, for example, a pot to the soul which possesses that attributive knowledge, it reveals its own existence as well). To _Iśvara_ and the _nitya_s (the eternally free), this attributive knowledge is eternally all-pervasive. For others in the state of _samsāra_ or bondage, it is subject to varying degrees of contraction and expansion owing to _karma_. In the state of _mukti_, it is all pervasive for all released souls, owing to perfect expansion and remains so throughout. The functions (_pravṛtti_) of attributive knowledge are as follows :- It discloses objects (external or internal); while willing or making an effort, it directs the body (and the senses etc.); in the state of bondage, it undergoes contraction and expansion; it undergoes experiences (bhoga) which reveal objects as agreeable or disagreeable. Experience or Bhoga is the process of feeling a thing as agreeable or disagreeable. All objects, which are among the glories of _Iśvara_, are, by their very nature, Agreeable and are enjoyed as being Agreeable by _Iśvara_, the _nitya_s and the souls that have attained _mokṣa_ . To those in _samsāra_, however, these objects appear at different times, and in different places and in relation to different _jīva_s as slightly agreeable, or disagreeable, or indifferent, but these variations do not belong to them by nature. Their slight agreeableness, disagreeableness, or being neither of the two is the fruit of the past actions of the _jīva_s awarded to them by _Iśvara_, whose will is irresistible. The _jīva_s that are in bondage are subject to the experience of the fruits of their _karma_, both by nature and by auxiliary causes. By nature they are subject to it, because they are sentient beings entirely under the control of another (_Iśvara_). The auxiliary causes are their having committed offences against the Lord. In the case of muktas and _nitya_s, although, by their nature as being subject to the control of _Iśvara_, the experience of the fruit of action might be possible, yet since they never perform any action displeasing to Him, there are no auxiliary causes for such experiences. _Iśvara_, by His essential nature, is not subject to such experience or enjoyment of the fruits of action, since He stands as the Ruler over all and with no one else to command Him. Nor are there any auxiliary causes in His case, as there is no one whose commands He may be said to have disobeyed.

The essential nature (_svarūpa_) of all ātmās, jīvās as well as _Iśvara_, is being selfluminous to oneself. This luminosity of the self to itself suffers, even in the case of those in bondage, no contraction or expansion at any time. The attributive knowledge (_dharma_bhūtajñāna) of all ātmās is luminous to its supporting self, while disclosing objects (like pots). A common characteristic of _svarūpa_ _jñāna_ or the self and attributive knowledge or dharniabhūtajrāna is their both being of the nature of knowledge and being self-luminous (i.e.) being luminous without requiring anything else to light them up. Attributive knowledge has the additional characteristic of revealing or disclosing objects (vishayitva). The additional characteristic possessed by svarüpa_jñāna_ (or the self) is subjectiveness or inwardness (pratyaktva). _Jñāna_ or knowledge, (which is the character of both of them), may be defined as that which makes a thing laminous; that is, it makes either itself or something else fit for being spoken out and acted upon (vyavahāra). Self-luminosity is the capability of being luminous without the need of any other known ledge to illumine it. Attributive knowledge has vishayitva, because it discloses objects other than itself (like pots, cloths etc.) The subjectiveness or inwardness of souls or ātmās (pratyaktva) consists in their being luminous to themselves ; that is, the benefit of their luminosity is enjoyed by themselves The atma or self is the recipient of the benefit of every object being disclosed or revealed. Pratyaktva is only a special instance of this general statement, for in it, the self receives the benefit of its own disclosure or revelation. A thing which does not possess this pratyaktva or subjectiveness does not also possess the common benefit of objects being disclosed. It cannot, therefore, be called sentient. Though subjective knowledge or the 'I' and attributive knowledge, which is its attribute, are both luminous by themselves, yet they are also capable of being apprehended by other forms of knowledge (like that from _śāstra_s), as being endowed with attributes like being eternal. When one's attributive knowledge happens to be known or apprehended by one with the help of another piece of knowledge, the latter is called another piece of knowledge, merely because of the direction to which the attributive knowledge is turned. When we perceive an object, say a pot, _dharma_bhūtajñāna contacts the object and reveals it to the soul or self; but when the _dharmabhūta jñāna_ itself becomes the object of knowledge, it is revealed to the self  by a part of it.



THE THREE KINDS OF NON-SENTIENT BEINGS :

The three classes of non-sentient things are capable of being apprehended only by others, (and not by themselves). Non sentience means being without the possession of knowledge. To be capable of being apprehended only by others means that their apprehension is not to themselves or for their own benefit. These two (viz. being without the possession of knowledge and the apprehension not being for their own benefit) are true also of attributive knowledge (_dharmabhūta _jñāna), which is thus a non-sentient thing.

Of the three classes of non-sentient things, matter (_Prakṛti_) and time (Kala) are jaḍa (i.e.) not luminous by themselves. There are some who hold that Śuddha-sattvam is also jaḍa. To be jaḍa is to be without self-luminosity. Those who have studied such treatises as Pancharātra or the Lord's _Śāstra_ would say that Śuddhasattvam is luminous by itself, as it is declared to be so in that _śāstra_. It may be asked why, if it is luminous by itself, it is not directly perceived by beings in the state of _samsāra_, without having to be known through _śāstra_ only. The answer is as follows:- The soul whose essential nature (_svarūpa_) is knowledge and its attributive knowledge are both laminous by themselves and yet the former is luminous to itself and not to other souls, who have to know it with the help of their own attributive knowledge. Attributive knowledge, though luminous to its substrate, namely the soul, is not luminous to others. In the same way, the Śuddha sattvam may be luminous by itself only to _Iśvara_, the muktas and the _nitya_s and not to others. There is nothing unreasonable in this view.



It has been said in the following _śloka_  :



“We [^f149] bow to Hari and proceed to expound the s'astra called Nyāya-_Tattva_ :- to Hari who sees, directly by perception and of His own accord, all things simultaneously." It may be asked how, to _Iśvara_ who sees all things with His attributive knowledge, Śuddha-sattvam could be[^35] luminous by itself, when it is illuminated by the attributive knowledge of _Iśvara_. The answer is as follows - _Iśvara_'s attributive knowledge apprehends all things including His own divine _svarūpa_ and yet do we not hold that His divine form is luminous by itself? So also it is possible that Śuddhasattvam is self-luminous, though it is apprehended also by the attributive knowledge of _Iśvara_. This is true also of _nitya_s. When lighting up an object (like a pot), attributive knowledge, it has already been said, is luminous by itself only to its sub-strate, namely, the self or soul. In the same way Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous by itself to those that have attained release in their new state. There is nothing inconceivable in this. The luminosity of attributive knowledge is obstructed at the time when it is not light ing up external objects (like pots ), by past _karma_ of certain kinds. So also the luminosity of Śuddhasattva may meet with obstruction in the state of bondage and may not, therefore, be apprehended by those in _samsāra_.

[^f149]: Nyāya-tatvam: Mangala sloka


[^35]:
A pot is not luminous, because it becomes visible or is seen only when lighted up by the flame of a lamp. The flame of a lamp is luminous, because it does not require anything else to become visible.




SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_,



‘‘धियः स्वयंप्रकाशत्वं मुक्तौ स्वाभाविकं यथा ।  
बद्धे कदाचित्संरुद्धं तथाऽत्राऽपि नियम्यते ॥’’१४-अ॥





The luminosity of (attributive) knowledge is natural to it (svabhavika), after release from _samsāra_, but is obstructed some times during bondage. So also in this case, (there may be obstruction during _samsāra_ and luminousness after release)".



Substances which are subject to modification (vikarī) are sometimes agreeable and sometimes disagreeable to the same individual and to different individuals. (Similarly Śuddha-sattvam may be luminous to God, the eternally free souls and those souls that have attained release from bondage, while being non-luminous to those in bondage.) There is no contradiction in this. In matters ascertained by the authority of the Scriptures, it is no use pointing out inconsistency based on analogy. If, without accepting this principle, we were to say that Śuddhasattvam is said to be luminous not in reality, but by courtesy, as it were, or figuratively (upacāra), it might become possible to argue that knowledge, bliss etc. are also true of the self or soul only figuratively and not in truth. It may be asked :-" How could there be, in a luminous object (viz. s'uddhasattvam), qualities like form and taste and classifications like earth and water and also modifications. Self luminous things like the soul and attributive knowledge do not, in general, have shape, taste, smell and the like)"? The answer is as follows:- (All self-luminous objects are not alike but have differences peculiar to each); for example, knowledge or self which is the substrate (1.e. the soul) and attributive knowledge, though both are luminous, are different from each other in other respects. Knowledge, which is the substrate, has subjectivity, while attributive knowledge is objective, and apprehends objects. So this objection can be given a counter-check (pratibandhi) and cannot hold good in a matter where the authority of the śāstra  must be accepted. Śuddhasattvam, which is luminous, is included among the three classes of non-sentient things, because it has not the quality of sentience or being the knower. The activities (_pravṛtti_) of these three kinds of non-sentient things are of the nature of varied modifications (pariņāma) in accordance with the will of _Iśvara_.



_PRAKṚTI_.



Among these, _prakṛti_ or matter is, in its essential nature, possessed of three qualities or attributes. _Prakṛti_ or matter is constantly subject to modification. When its three qualities sattvam, rajas and tamas are evenly balanced, there is dissolution or termination of the world (mahapralayam) and when these qualities are uneven in proportions, _prakṛti_ undergoes modifications into mahat and the like. The region of matter which is not modified and the region which has become modified have been classified by the _Śāstra_s into twenty-four tatvās or reals - _prakṛti_, mahut, ahankāra, tanınātras (five), the elements (bhūtas) (five) and the senses (eleven) - the senses of knowledge (five), the senses of action (five) and the mind (manas).



Sometimes they are spoken of as more than twenty-four or less than twenty-four in accordance with the terms or basis of classification. The subdivisions of each of these classes of _tattva_s or reals, and the deities (abhimāni devatās ) presiding over or representing each of them should be understood by those who are qualified for their respective meditation. What we are primarily concerned with here is their being different from the atmā or self. These may all be understood as weapons and ornaments of the Supreme Being, in the following way







TAMIL VERSE:

पुरुडन् मणिवरमागप् पॊण्ड्रामूलप्  
पिरगिरुदि मऱुवाग मान् ऱण्डागत्  
तॆरुण्मरुळ् वाण्मऱैवाग वाङ्गारङ्गळ्  
शार्ङ्गञ् जङ्गाग मनन् दिगिरियाग  
इरुडीगङ्गळीरैन्दुञ् शरङ्गळाग  
विरुबूदमालै वनमालैयाग  
करुडनुरुवा मऱैयिन् पॊरुळाङ् गण्णन्  
करिगिरिमेनिण्ड्रनैत्तुङ् गाक्किण्ड्राने. (12)



The self or soul is the invaluable gem, (koustubha); _prakṛti_ or matter is the mole on the Lord's body (_Śrī_vatsa); the _tattva_ or real called mahat is His club; knowledge and ignorance (_jñāna_ and a_jñāna_) are His sword and its sheath; the ahankāras are His bow and conch (tamasa ahankāra is the bow (sārnga ) and sātvika ahankāra the conch); the mind is His discus (chakra); the ten senses are arrows; the tanmātras and the bhūtas (the elements) form His vanamālā (vaijayanti) or garland of wild flowers; Garuḍa is the Veda and Śrī kṛṣṇa (Kannan) the object of description in the Veda, is endowed with these and protects all from the top of Hastigiri".



The distinctive features of each of these twenty-four reals' may be seen in their respective definitions. Of these the twenty three reals which are effects and modifications of _prakṛti_ and also their effects and modifications differ from one another in their nature and these differences may be understood from a study of the purānas.



ESSENTIAL NATURE, ACTIVITY ETC. OF _PRAKṚTI_:



Śuddhasattvam[^f151]


[^f151]: Pāñcarātram



"Satvam or Śuddhasattvam illumines its own existence; it is different from the quality called sattvam" "The creator[^f152] is beyond tamas;' "It is different from[^f153] _prakṛti_ and is revered by the gods". These and other passages declare the existence of a region (of s'uddha sattvam) beyond tamas. Therefore the passages which say[^f154] "It (_Prakṛti_) is eternal and has no limits and is beyond all measure. It is endless and incapable of being measured” should be understood as stating that moola _prakṛti_ or matter is endless or infinite except for the region covered by the _nitya_ vibhūti (the region of eternal glory).

The activity or _pravṛtti_ of matter (or _prakṛti_) is to become modified with its three qualities duly balanced ( during pralaya), and with them as a given after creation (_śrī_shti), for the sake of the experience of souls bound in samsarā, and for their release from bondage and so also for the delectation or _līlā_ of _Iśvara_. It also acts in various ways, having assumed the forms of the body and the senses. Owing to the qualities of rajas and tamas in it, it conceals the truths concerning the reals' (_tattva_s) and gives rise to false or erroneous knowledge. While existing for the experiences of the _baddha_ during _samsāra_, it may also reveal the _tattva_s or 'reals. just as they are, when the quality of sattvam in it is developed and may help in the striving for _mokṣa_. All these contribute to the delectation or _līlā_ of _Iśvara_.



Śuddhasattvam is, in its essential nature (_svarūpa_), the seat or abode of that sattvam which is unmixed with rajas and tamas. Its specific state in time or sthiti is eternal in the (permanent) halls and towers (of Vaikuṇṭha  ) and in the specific and permanent forms of _Iśvara_ and the eternally free. It is not eternal but temporary in such things as the forms that come into existence out of a temporary desire of _Iśvara_, of the _nitya_s and of the muktas. Its specific activity is to undergo modifications to suit their desires so as to serve as accessories for the enjoyment (Bhoga) of _Iśvara_, the _śeṣī_, and as instruments for the service to be rendered by the _śeṣa_s.



TIME: Kāla.



Time or Kāla is, in its essential nature, non-sentient or non luminous and all-pervasive (vibhu). It is eternal because its continued existence ( sthiti) is not limited by time. Its activity consists in its being accessory to creation and the like by such divisions as kală (1/30 of muhūrta ), kāṣṭha (1/30 of _kāla_) and the like.





All these substances (dravya ) are, in their essential nature (_svarūpa_), eternal. Some of them are said to be temporary or transient, owing to their assuming a new state or condition (avastha), which justifies their being called by a new name. As new states similar to those which have perished follow each other in continuous succession, they are said to be eternal in the sense of a stream or current of water (retaining the same form, though the water at any time may be different ).



The essential nature (_svarūpa_), the existence in time (sthiti), and the activity (_pravṛtti_) of all these substances are dependent upon _Iśvara_, because they have no existence etc, apart from His existence and without His will or desire. Therefore it is due to _Iśvara_'s will that all substances are, by their very nature, agreeable. From this it follows that to _Iśvara_, to the eternally free and to the released souls, they are all agreeable. To those bound in _samsāra_, however, they appear as disagreeable or as only slightly agreeable at different times and to different persons in accordance with the _karma_ of those persons. Even to bound souls, the essential Nature of their own self or soul is always to be agreeable, as such is the will of _Iśvara_. It is indeed, because of this false identification with the self which is agreeable and also _karma_, that the body which is disagreeable appears agreeable to those who are ignorant. Since _prakṛti_ and its modifications are harmful owing to _karma_, the man who desires release from bondage should abandon the attachment to them. To those that have attained _mokṣa_ , however, these very things are agreeable and not to be rejected. All those things that are taken for one's own with the notion of 'I' and 'Mine' are harmful. They become agreeable, when a man has come to understand his real nature and to realise that these things exist for the purposes of the Lord. We will explain this matter at length when we come to speak of the perfect and complete enjoyment of (the bliss of ) _Brahman_.



_IŚVARA_ :

The essential nature (_svarūpa_ ) of _Iśvara_ on whom depends the existence of all things is truth (satyam), knowledge (_jñāna_),infiniteness ( ananta ), bliss (_ānanda_ ) and purity (amalatvam ) because of attributes like being truth, being knowledge, being infinite, being blissful and being pure. These attributes define His _svarūpa_ or essential nature. This truth is brought out by the Alwars in the following passages: "Thou [^f155] art light that never becomes extinct and is not capable of being measured" (where His essential nature as Truth and knowledge is revealed as also His infiniteness ) " Thou that [^f156] art perfect knowledge and bliss" and “Thou [^f157] that envelopest all and art a Light greater than all other lights, being both knowledge and bliss" "He is the [^f158] Pure". In these and other ways the Alwars meditated on Him. His other qualities, along with His divine and auspicious form and such other things, are attributes of His essential nature ( _svarūpa_) already defined by those attributes. Among these qualities knowledge, strength, lordship, valour, energy, splendour-these six are associated with His nature as the Supreme Being. Goodness, spontaneous love, and the like are qualities that make him easily accessible to all. These qualities are, at all times, connected with His essential nature (_svarūpa_ ). The statement that some of these qualities are associated with the Supreme Person (_Para_), some with _vyūha_ and so forth is only to show what qualities the Lord of all reveals to those who are devoted to any of these manifestations of His. (It does not mean that the other qualities are absent in any of these forms). Just as in the respective _vidyā_s of the Upaniṣads, we are to meditate on certain specified attributes of _Brahman_, so also certain specified attributes are to be meditated upon in connection with particular forms of the Lord as revealed in Pūncharātra or the Scripture of the Lord. In the _Para_ or Supreme _Vāsudeva_, all the six [^f159] qualities[^36] beginning with knowledge are to be thought of. The _śāstra_s sometimes say that the vyuhas (or emanations ) are four  and in some places that they are three. where it is said that there are four vyūhas and that _Vāsudeva_ is one of them, since there is no difference in the qualities to be meditated on between the Supreme _Vāsudeva_ and the _Vyūha_ _Vāsudeva_, it is tantamount to saying that there are three vyuhas. Those who hold that the vyūhas are three state their view briefly in the following _śloka_  :- "O Lord, Thy original form shone with these six attributes; then came three forms of Thine which had, each of them, a couple of these attributes." Their respective qualities and activities are epitomised in the following _śloka_  :-- "O, Sovereign of [^f160] _Śrī_r_aṅga_! As the Supreme _Vāsudeva_ (_Para_) endowed with all the six qualities, you are the object of blissful enjoyment for those that have attained _mokṣa_ ; as _Saṅkarṣaṇa_ being endowed with strength and knowledge, you destroy the Universe and also promulgate the _śāstra_s; as Pradyumna being endowed with lordship and virility, you create the Universe and make _Dharma_ prevail; as Aniruddha being endowed with splendour and the power to overcome others, you protect the world and teach the Truth. In this way you divide yourself."

The differences arising from planes like the waking state have been thus summarised :-"O Lord, [^37] of [^f162] those that meditate on Thee, some are like those in the waking state, some like those that dream in sleep, others like those that sleep without dreams, and others still are like those that have fallen into a swoon. (In the first group, the senses function, in the second the senses do not function, only the wind is active; in the third group even the wind does not function; they only breathe; in the fourth group even the breath is suspended). In the same way, O Lord, Thou art in four forms and dividest Thyself into four forms and art meditated upon with attributes and weapons suited to each."

[^f162]: Rangarajastavam: Uttarashatakam: 39


[^37]:
This sloka cannot be understood without the account given in the Appendix.


The twelve forms that begin with Keśava are other forms derived from the vyūhas. (_Bhagavān_ also manifests Himself as vibhavas.) These vibhavas are thirty odd forms like Padmanabha. Among them Avatars like Matsya and Kurma are specified in relation to some specific purpose. In these vibhavas or avatārs, _Iśvara_ conceals those attributes of His which He wants to conceal and reveals those attributes which He wants to reveal to suit the special mission which He has undertaken in them. Among them, there are varied manifestations which are countless. So has it been said, "The [^f163] forms of Kṛṣṇa are innumerable", Other forms similarly derived from the vibhavas can also be seen in the _śāstra_s. Sometimes the Lord enters into some _jīva_s with His own specific form and into others with His energy (_śakti_) and accomplishes wonderful things. These belong to another class of vibhavas. The forms of the Supreme _Vāsudeva_ (_Para_), the Vyuhas and the Vibhavas assume the [^f164] forms[^38] of the images and enter into the shapes of images (installed in temples), for the sake of devotees as desired by them. This is arcāvatara: The Lord is (also) present in a subtle form in the hearts of all _jīva_s. This form is called Antaryāmi _Avatāra_, as meditation on this form has been prescribed as the means which enables those who wish to enter into the meditation of the Antaryāmin or the divine all-pervading _svarūpa_ of the Lord. It has been said of this meditation: "Those [^f165] who have attained success in Asht_aṅga_ _yoga_ and who are desirous of worshipping the one who dwells in the heart are fit to meditate on the one (i.e.) the form in which He dwells in the hearts of all." Therefore this One (Hārda) is spoken as Antaryāmi.

[^f163]: _Pāñcarātra_


[^f164]: Sātvatasamhita: 6-22 This is stated in the following passage: "He assumes a form similar to that of the image, enters into it, and remains there”.*


[^f165]: Sātvatasamhita: 2-7-8


[^38]:
Sātvatasamhita: 6-22 This is stated in the following passage: "He assumes a form similar to that of the image, enters into it, and remains there”.




All these forms of incarnation are constituted of the substance called s'uddhasattvam and have no connection with _karma_ or its fruits. They are therefore called pure creation (s'uddha _śrī_shti). These avatārs (vibhava, _arcā_ and Hārda ) are all real; in them there is no contraction or abridgement of _jñāna_ and the other attributes of _Iśvara_; the bodies of these avatārs are made of Śuddha-sattvam; the reason for these avatars is only the Lord's will; their time of manifestation is the time when _dharma_ has to be safe-guarded; their purpose is the protection of the good and the like; those who meditate on these avatars with clear knowledge may attain _mokṣa_  at the end of this very life without any future birth, by their successful adoption of the right means suited to their competency and capacity. All these truths have. been explained by the Gitācharya in five _śloka_ s beginning with:-



"Bahuni me [^f166] vyatītāni etc." Many are the births that I have gone through, just like you.”

[^f166]: Bhagavadgītā: IV 5




This meditation on the vibhavas (or avatārs) creates supreme faith or confidence (mahāvisvāsa) in the mind of the seeker after salvation who seeks _prapatti_ as an independent means or _upāya_, by affording him a knowledge of the great qualities of the Lord who is sought as the refuge and this at the moment when he adopts _prapatti_ as the means. So also the worship of Archāvatāra (the image) will lead easily to _mokṣa_. _Bhagavān_ Śaunaka has said :-[^f167] " Having shaped a beautiful image of Viṣṇu  with a lovely face and lovely eyes, out of gold, silver and the like in a manner that would be pleasing, one should adore it, bow to it, sacrifice to it and meditate on it. By doing so, one would enter into that form which is none other than _Brahman_ and will have all one's sins dispelled." The Alwars, too, very largely dwelt on this secret doctrine about the Lord's avatārs and the distinctive excellence of the avatars in the form of _arcā_ or consecrated images and considered the Supreme Self (in Vaikuṇṭha  ) as their original cause.

[^f167]: Viṣṇudharma: 103-16




_Iśvara_, who is in these varied forms, creates, maintains and destroys all, is also the giver of _mokṣa_  and has such other activities. These activities of His are due to the overflow of His bliss or ānanda.



Lakṣmī



_Iśvara_ is with His consort in all situations as stated in passages like : "Lakṣmī , the [^f168] mother of the world, is eternal and inseparable from Viṣṇu ." This may also be clearly understood from the writings of Parāśara and Parankusa (Nammalwar), who, for the help which they have rendered, have been spoken of by Alavandar with great regard in these terms: "I bow to the generous sage, Parāśara, who composed that gem of a purāņa (_Viṣṇu_purāna), wherein he discloses, as they are in reality, the truths concerning _cit_, _acit_ apd _Iśvara_, their distinctive nature, swarga, _mokṣa_  and the means of attaining them" and "I bow my head at the two feet of Nammalwar fragrant with vakula flowers, for they are, to all those who are connected with me, mother, father, wives, 8008 and all forms of wealth and lordship."

[^f168]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-22-53




In this context, we have to understand a difference in their activities or division of labour, as it were ; for the Lord is concerned with the punishment (of the evildoer) and Lakṣmī  with pleading to Him for mercy on behalf of the sinner; the Mimāmsakas have declared that the object which is stated by analogy to have attributes similar to those of another object actually described must be different by that very circumstance[^39] from that other object. So in this case, as it has been stated by analogy or atides'a "Just[^f170] as Viṣṇu  is everywhere, so also is Lakṣmī , O, best of Brahmins", there should be a difference between _Bhagavān_ and Lakṣmī . This difference should be understood as referring (here) only to the difference in their functions or activities. This is the conclusion arrived at in the following _śloka_  in _Śrī_gunaratnakosa; "Youth and other attributes are common to both of you; however the Lord has manly qualities, like independence, conquest of foes, firmness and the like; you have such feminine qualities as existing solely for the husband, compassion and forgiveness. Thus you two have taken diverse qualities." "It is impossible to understand the real nature of God", says Nammalvar in (1-3-6). So in a matter like this, vain assertion or insistence is not proper,

[^f170]: Viṣṇupurāṇa: 1-8-17


[^39]:
Without requiring any other authority to prove it. The different activities shared by Lakṣmī  and Her Lord are determined by their own will and not by difference in the nature of the two.




As has been said: "Some make [^f171] weak cases appear strong." Although it is possible to prove whatever we please with the help of our proficiency in logical disputation, we submit to the Authority of the _śāstra_s. Therefore we should understand clearly the truth concerning the Real or _Tattva_ that rules and the reals or _tattva_s that are ruled, only in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s. We need not try to know all things but should try to know what is exceedingly useful. In matters which are only of limited use, we need not be so curious to obtain knowledge. The pilot tries to know just as much about the (vast) ocean as  would enable him to steer the ship along the right path. Similarly we have to understand, necessarily, as much as has been said here. In order to obtain unshakable conviction (about these truths), more elaborate treatises may be studied.

[^f171]: Mahābhārata: Sabhaparva 39-5




OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE TATVAS



OR ‘REALS':



Here we have classified the _Tattva_s into three. So also some consider _Iśvara_ 48 the only real or _Tattva_, because all other reals are His attributes. Some have classified the _tattva_s into two as follows: The ruler and the ruled; the self and the non-self; the means and the end (_upāya_ and _upeya_ ). Some classify what should be known into four : the Saviour and that which is to be saved; that which should be rejected and that which should be accepted. Others classify what should be known ander five heads as pointed out before and others into six. In the Rahasya_śāstra_s, what should be known is stated to be seven. To all those who think in those varied ways, there are respective advantages accruing to the strengthening of their knowledge and their daily observances.



What is said in the following _śloka_ , is of course true: "A knowledge[^40] of the śāstras can be obtained only with the greatest difficulty. Further it may unsettle the mind. Therefore having obtained a knowledge of Hari from the teaching of the _guru_, a man should cease from all such activities." This does not mean that one should make no attempt to learn the _śāstra_s. It only means that one should learn what is most important as quickly as possible and proceed at once to adopt the means learnt therefrom for attaining _mokṣa_ , without spending too much time over elaborate treatises, which might cause delay in the adoption of the means. The man who has enough to eat without tilling the soil would never think of tilling it. So also without wasting time over what is unimportant, we should, as soon as possible, adopt the means prescribed for _mokṣa_ ,

A clear knowledge of what is useful, indifference to the three ends (_dharma_, artha, and kama) and being one in thought, word and deed - these constitute the elixir of happiness.

माऱ निनैन्दरुळान् मऱैनूल्दन्द वादियरे. (12)



Our ancient _ācārya_s who gave as the essence of the Veda have, out of compassion (for us), taught us clearly all about the three wonderful and varied _tattva_s, _cit_, _acit_ and _Iśvara_ in order to remove,' from our minds, the cruel delusion in regard to the body arising from _karma_ and the notion that we are independent (of the Lord).





SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

आवापोद्वापतस्स्युः कतिकति कविधीचित्रवत्ततदर्थेषु  
आनन्त्यादस्तिनास्त्योरनवधिकुहनायुक्तिकान्ताः कृतान्ताः ।

By the addition of a point here and the omission of a point there, there are countless systems of thought, each appearing beautiful with fallacious arguments owing to the endless differences due to 'is' and 'is not'. These are indeed as numerous as the poems composed by the imagination of poets (some omitting an incident and others inventing an incident and so forth). Notwithstanding this, the unparalleled vision of the truth (about the _tattva_s) will make them all vanish at once into thin air. When the man is seen in reality, the delusion that he is an animal or a log of wood, sthāņu vanishes at once. So also when, with the help of the _pramāṇa_s, _Puruṣottama_ is ascertained as the Supreme Deity, the delusion that Rudra (_Sthāṇu_) or any other is the Supreme Deity is at once dispelled.
