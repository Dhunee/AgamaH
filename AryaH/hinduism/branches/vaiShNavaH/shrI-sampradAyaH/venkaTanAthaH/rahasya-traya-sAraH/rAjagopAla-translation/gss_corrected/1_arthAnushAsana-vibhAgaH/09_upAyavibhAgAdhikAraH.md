(9) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MEANS OR _UPĀYA_ FOR ATTAINING (MUKTI). page162

SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_.

उपायः स्वप्राप्तेरुपनिषदधीतस्स भगवान्  
प्रसत्त्यै तस्योक्ते प्रपदननिदिध्यासनगती ।  
तदारोहः पुंसस्सुकृतपरिपाकेन महता  
निदानं तत्राऽपि स्वयमखिलनिर्माण निपुणः ॥ २२ ॥

_Bhagavān_ is declared in the Upaniṣads to be Himself the means (_upāya_) of attaining Him. The ways of _bhakti_ and _prapatti_ are indicated for winning His grace. The adoption of these [^46] *ways is the result of the great ripening of meritorious deeds (done in the past ) and, even for this, _Bhagavān_, who has the ability to create everything, is Himself the cause.

[^46]: These ways: The commentary Sārāsvādinī says that the Sanskrit   word Gati does not mean here ways or _upāya_s but forms of knowledge.

_UPĀYA_ AND UPEYA:

The means or _upāya_ to be adopted by them (i.e.) the seekers after _mukti_) is a special kind of expansion of knowledge. The _upeya_ or object of attainment which can be realised by this means is another special kind of expansion of knowledge. Of these, the special kind of expansion of knowledge which is the means requires the help of instruments of knowledge (karana ) and has been prescribed in the _Śāstra_s. It has for its object _Brahman_ who is always endowed with the five attributes like satyam, (satyam, _jñāna_m, anantan,anandam, amalatvam ) which define His essential nature or substance ( _svarūpa_), along with the qualities Associated invariably with the respective _vidyā_ or form of meditation. The object of attainment (_upeya_) which is a special kind of expansion of knowledge does not require any instruments of knowledge. It is the natural heritage of the _jīvātmā_ and has for its object _Brahman_ perfect with all qualities and glorious possessions (vibhūtis).

_ŚLOKA_:

उपासितगुणादेर्या प्राप्तावप्यबहिष्क्रिया ।  
सा तत्क्रतुनयग्राह्या नाकारान्तरवर्जनम् ॥

The principle of tatkratu[^47] states only that  the qualities (and forms) meditated upon would not be excluded in the attainment; it does not exclude other qualities (and forms ). Service to the Lord is also the object of attainment (_upeya_ ) as it is the overflow of the experience (of _Bhagavān_ ) which is attained.

[^47]: The principle of tatkratu or tatkratu nyaya is to the effect that in whatever form or manner and with whatever qualities one meditates on God - in that very form and with those very qualities will one attain Him. Though service to the Lord is not specifically prescribed in a _vidyā_, it will be attained after _mukti_.

BHAGAVÃN IS BOTH _UPĀYA_ AND UPEYA:

_Iśvara_ is the object of the knowledge which is the means, _upāya_, and is also the object of the knowledge which is attainment : He is the means or _Upāya_ as being the giver of the (desired) fruit and, likewise. He is Upeya because He is Himself the object that is to be enjoyed. In the case of the _mumukṣu_ who has adopted _prapatti_ as the sole and independent means, _Iśvara_ takes the place of other _upāya_s. In the case of others also (i, e.) those who adopt _bhakti_, _Iśvara_ whose favour has been won by _prapatti_ (adopted as an auxiliary means to _bhakti_) intervenes and, standing in the place of rites and duties which are too hard for them in those situations which lie between the beginning of _karma_ _yoga_ and the completion of the (prescribed) meditation, brings about the removal of sins and the manifestation of sattvam which can result from their performance. He sees to it that the meditation or worship which has been adopted as an _upāya_ is so complete as to bear fruit.

KARMA YOGA:

Karma Yoga means the performance of certain kinds of _karma_ or rites and duties as the result of knowledge acquired from the _śāstra_s in regard to the true nature of the _Jīvātmā_ and the Paramātmā. The rites and duties consist of the following: (1) _nitya_ karna or regular duties to be performed compulsorily (like the daily sandhya vandana) (2) _naimittika_ _karma_ or rites to be compulsorily performed on specific occasions (like the eclipse of the sun or the moon) and (3) such kārya karmās or rites as are optional and as have been chosen to be within one's ability. Though these kāıya rites are ordained for obtaining certain specified fruits like _svarga_, they have to be performed without any desire for those fruits. All these rites and duties, 1, 2 and 3, have to be performed regularly and in accordance with the prescribed rules by the Karma-yogin.

This _karma_ _yoga_ has several subdivisions described in the _śloka_ s beginning with "Some perform the rites or sacrifices (Yajna) which are of the nature of the worship of the Gods" (Bhagavadgītā IV 25.) They include such (items) as the adoration of the gods, the performance of austerities (tapas), pilgrimage to sacred places, giving in charity, and sacrifices.

In the same way as, in accordance with the differences of competence, _prapatti_ becomes the means of attaining _mukti_, either through _bhakti_ or directly by itself and without the intervention of _bhakti_, so also _karma_ _yoga_, either through _Jñāna_ Yoga or without it, becomes the means of having a vision of one's

or ātmā with the help of yogic auxiliaries like yama (self-rest raint), _niyama_ (observance of rites) and _prāṇāyāma_ (the control of the breath).

JÑĀNA YOGA:

_Jñāna_ Yoga is the constant and uninterrupted contemplation, by one who has conquered his mind by karna-_yoga_, of his _svarūpa_ or essential nature or the self as being distinct from matter, (the body, the senses and the like) - his _svarūpa_ which is the mode or prakāra of _Iśvara_ in virtue of its relation to Him as His body or śarīra. The self is the body of _Iśvara_ ( as has been already pointed out) because it is supported and controlled by Him and serves His purposes.

If a person has succeeded in attaining to a vision of his self ( ātmāvalokana) by the practice of _yoga_ preceded by _karma_ _yoga_ and _Jñāna_ _yoga_ and if he escapes the spare of being (permanently) attracted by the pleasure of enjoying this vision which is so great as to create a distaste for all sense-pleasures - then he begins the practice of _bhakti_ _yoga_ which is (the direct) means for the attainment of the supreme goal of enjoying _Bhagavān_. While practising _bhakti_yoga, the aspirant contemplates on _Bhagavān_ as the Inner Self, or antaryāmin of his own self which is His body. The vision that he has (already ) acquired of his own pure self is then useful, for it is only through it that he reaches its Inner Self, just as the cloth within which a gem is tied up is first to be seen before the gem itself can be seen. In this way the vision of one's self serves as a qualification for the practice of _bhakti_ _yoga_.

_BHAKTI_ YOGA:

_Bhakti_ _yoga_ is the special form of meditation which is of the nature of unsurpassed love and which has, for its object, the essential nature and the like (form, qualities, etc.) of _Bhagavān_ who is not dependent on any one else, who is not subject to the authority of any one else and who does not exist for the fulfilment of the purposes of any one else. _Bhakti_ is of the form of a continuous stream of knowledge which is of the nature of uninterrupted memory like oil streaming down continuously; it has clearness similar to that of visual perception; it grows from strength to strength by being practised every day until the day of journey to Paramapada and terminates in the remembrance of the last moment. The performance of the rites and duties of one's _varṇa_ and _āśrama_ is auxiliary to it (_bhakti_ _yoga_ ), as it dispels sins that cause rajas and tamas, which, like weeds, impede the growth of sattvam so necessary for the expansion of knowledge. This _bhakti_ _yoga_ is also a means or sadhana in accordance with the specific desire of the sādhaka, for acquiring lordship (in this world or in _svarga_) and other fruits (like kaivalya). This is. calculated to strengthen the faith of the weak-minded as stated in the _śloka_  ; "Worldly' benefits have also been mentioned as arising from _bhakti_-_yoga_. They produce confidence in the attainment of _mukti_ (by verifying what is stated in the śāstra  from the example of these worldly benefits). This idea is expressed in the _śloka_  in the Gita (7-16) which says: "Four kinds of persons worship me etc.” The superiority of the Jnāni which is stated there in the words, " Among them, the Jñāni is the best because he desires to be always with _Bhagavān_ and is devoted solely and exclusively to Him" is thus described by _Bhagavān_ Himself com " Four *kinds of people are my men. They are all devotees (bhaktas). Of them they who worship me alone exclusively are the best, for they do not approach other deities. They perform the prescribed rites and duties without caring for their fruits and desire to attain me alone. The other three kinds of devotees desire ( worldly) fruits which have an end and they are subject to lapses. The wise man who worships me with sole and exclusive devotion attains _mokṣa_ ."

_Bhakti_ _yoga_ which has thus been prescribed as the means of obtaining _mokṣa_  has been called _parābhakti_. Love of the Lord which results from intimacy with sāttvikas (and the scriptures ) and which produces _parābhakti_ is also called _bhakti_, because it generates an eager desire to know _Iśvara_ with perfect clearness. It has been said: "Owing to smy devotion to the Lord and to my _guru_s, I have attained spiritual purity and come to know _Janārdana_ with the help of the _Śāstra_s." (So _parābhakti_ is born successively of a knowledge of the truth obtained from the _śāstra_s which leads to _karma_ _yoga_ and the like). It (_parābhakti_) produces in its turn an eager desire and determination to see the Lord and makes the man cry out as follows- "O Lord, 'who art the abode of attributes like _jñāna_, be pleased to show Thy whole self 1" “Vouchsafe Thy grace so that I may see Thee": "May I see Thee some day!" By this keen desire alone, he wins the grace of _Bhagavān_ who rewards him with a perfect visual perception of himself for the time being. This visual perception is called parajñāna. From this perfect vision of the _svarūpa_ of the Lord is born an excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord similar to the yearning feltt by a man suffering from great thirst at the sight of a tank. This (excessive and unsurpassed love for the Lord) is called parama _bhakti_, Parama _bhakti_ produces an eager desire and determination to enjoy the Lord without any limitations, as the _bhakta_ feels that it is impossible to live any longer without this experience of the Lord as described in the Tiruvoymozhi 10.10-1 (where the Alwar cries out that he will not hereafter allow the Lord to leave him) and that he must become one with the Lord and declares all this with an oath that cannot be ignored by the Lord. It causes (likewise) an excessive eagerness in the Lord to give him _mokṣa_  immediately and makes him attain _mokṣa_  after quenching his great thirst for union.

_BHAKTI_ AND _PRAPATTI_:

(_Prapatti_ stands in the place of _parābhakti_ to the man who adopts it as the direct and independent means). Siace _bhakti_ _yoga_ is not suitable for those who do not belong to the three higher castes and (likewise) also for those in these three castes who are wanting in _jñāna_ or ability or both and since it will not suit those who cannot endure any delay in the attainment of its fruit (namely, _mokṣa_) and are therefore extremely impatient, _prapatti_ is prescribed as the sole and independent means of _mokṣa_  for them. Since it will be the means of securing all desired objects, it has been prescribed in the place of _parābhakti_ for those who know their limitations. Just as in the case of the man who practises the vidyās, _parābhakti_ is followed by (certain) stages of attainment (like para _jñāna_ ), this _prapatti_ will be followed by certain favourable results or states in accordance with the desire of the man who adopts it as the independent _upāya_. These states are to be considered as part of the fruits of _prapatti_.

CLASSIFICATION OF _UPĀYA_S

Thus _prapatti_ and _bhakti_ are said to be optional in relation to those who are qualified for them as they secure the same final goal or fruit.

_BHAKTI_ IS DIFFERENT FROM _PRAPATTI_:

That the two are different from each other is evident from the adhikarana or section. "The _Brahma_ _Vidyā_s are different as their *[^48] names and the like are different ". _Brahma_ sūtras (III-3.56). That there is option (to choose any of them) is also evident from the section : " There is option (to adopt any of them ) because the result or (final) fruit is the same". Brahnia sītras (III - 3. 57).

[^48]: _Bhakti_ leads through _yoga_ to para-_bhakti_ which leads to para-_Jñāna_, which, in its turn, leads to parama-_bhakti_.

It may be seen that, as in _upāsanā_s there are differences in _mantra_s and the like (_aṅga_s), there are, in _Nyāsa_ _Vidyā_ also, differences stated in the different branches of the vedas (Shakhas) and in the different samhitas of the agamas. Just as obeisance (namaskāra) is divided into three forms, verbal, mental and bodily, so _prapatti_, too, is said to be of different kinds owing to the excess of one or other of these differences. It has been stated by some that, just as obeisance becomes complete when all the three, verbal, mental and bodily are combined, _prapatti_, too, becomes complete when verbal and bodily actions are combined with mental states or _jñāna_. This statement of theirs should be understood as meaning that mental _prapatti_ is full and complete and that verbal and bodily activities are, as it were, the overflow of the mental _prapatti_ (_jñāna_). (It should not be taken to mean that _prapatti_ is incomplete when verbal and bodily actions are absent). We have already stated that all these are productive of the desired result or fruit in accordance with the competency of those who adopt them,

110 TAMIL VERSE:

निण्ड्रनिलैक्कुऱ निऱ्‌कुङ् गरुममुनेर्मदियाल्  
नण्ड्रॆन नाडिय ञानमुनल्गुमुट्कण्णुडैयार्  
ऒण्ड्रियबत्तियुमॊण्ड्रुमिलाविरैवार्क्करुळाल्  
अण्ड्रु पयण्ड्ररुमाऱुमऱिन्दवरन्दणरे. (16)

They are Brahmins who know the following :-- (1) Karma Yoga is suited to one's state (viz. _varṇa_, _āśrama_ and the like); (2) _Jñāna_ Yoga adopted with keen intelligence on account of its beneficial results: (3) _Bhakti_ Yoga adopted by those with an inner vision which is delightful and (4) _Prapatti_ which yields immediate fruit by the grace of God to those who are destitute of the qualifications (for the other three ) and who cannot endure delay in attaining _mokṣa_ .

SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

कर्मज्ञानमुपासनञ्च शरणव्रज्येति चावस्थितान्  
सन्मार्गानपवर्गसाधनविधौ सद्वारकाद्वारकान् ।  
एकद्व्याकृतियोगसंभृतपृथग्भावानुभावानिमान्  
सम्यक्प्रेक्ष्य शरण्यसारथिगिरामन्ते रमन्ते बुधाः ॥ २३ ॥

Karma, _Jñāna_, _Upāsana_ (_bhakti_ ) and likewise _śaraṇāgati_ are the good ways prescribed in the Vedas for securing _mokṣa_[^49] ; of these some are indirect and auxiliary means (namely, _karma_ and _jñāna_ ) while the others, _bhakti_ and _śaraṇāgati_ are direct and independent _upāya_s for _mukti_. Of these, some (i.e. _karma_ and _jñāna_), have only one form (that of being in. direct and auxiliary means ); _bhakti_ has only one form (that of being the direct and independent means for _mukti_, while _śaraṇāgati_ or _prapatti_ has two forms, that of being an indirect and auxiliary means as leading to _bhakti_ and also that of being the direct and independent means or _upāya_ for obtaining _mukti_. The wise (who know the s'ăstras), having understood well the difference among these _upāya_s due to their having this single or twofold nature, delight in the last words (caramaśloka  ) of the charioteer who is the Saviour of all, (i.e.) they prefer śaraṇāgati),

[^49]: Commentators of _Brahma_ _sūtra_s like Sudarśana Bhatta point out that this difference in names applies especially to _nyāsa_, since it is a different word from 'contemplate', ‘meditate', and 'adore' which are used in connection with the other _vidyā_s and which mean thc same thing, whereas _nyāsa_ has a different meaning (altogether).
