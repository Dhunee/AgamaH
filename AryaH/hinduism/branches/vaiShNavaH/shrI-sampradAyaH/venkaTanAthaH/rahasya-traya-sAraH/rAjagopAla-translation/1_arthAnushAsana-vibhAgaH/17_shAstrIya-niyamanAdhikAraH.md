(17) THE CHAPTER ON THE ORDINANCES 

IMPOSED BY THE SASTRAS. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Having laid, on Mukunda, the responsibility for his protection and become free from sin like those released from samsāra, the prapanna walks along the path laid down in the stāstras until his release from bondage, since (unlike the mukta) he cannot read the mind of the lord directly and since the path has been ordained for us by the command of the Omnipotent Lord and since, by straying from that path, he will immediately bring, on himself and on others, ills of various kinds. 

THE PRAPANNA SHOULD HAVE THE SASTRA 

FOR HIS GUIDE: 

(It has been stated so far that) owing to his relationship as a s'esha, the prapanna has to render service to Bhagavan and to Bhagavatās. Now it may be asked whether this service arises from his desire and in accordance with the sāstras or from his mere desire without any reference at all to the sāstras. The answer is as follows; To the man who is in this world full of the darkness of ignorance, the sāstra is required as a lamp (to show the path that he should take). So the service that he is to render should be according to the s'āstra; in matters where the s'āstra gives an option or alternatives, he may follow his own discretion. "How ja this", it may be asked. When Sri Ramanuja was about to leave this world, he observed his foremost disciples grieving exceedingly, He called them to his side and commanded them on pain of offence to Alavandar not to think of taking their own lives owing to their sorrow at his death. "They will (if they do so) have no connection with me”, he said. On hearing this, they were filled with sorrow and begged that they might be told what they should do thereafter. This was Sri Ramanuja's reply:

SRI RAMANUJA'S ADVICE: 

"If a man has become a prapanna, the salvation of his soul or self is the responsibility of Bhagavan, and he himself has nothing to do with it. If he thinks that he has anything to do with it, bis surrender of responsibility (prapatti or ätma samarpanam) must have been false or insincere. The maintenance of the body depends upon his past karma, and he should not feel anxious about it. If he feels anxious about it, he is a sceptic or nästika. Therefore neither in regard to his spiritual welfare nor in regard to his bodily welfare, has he anything more to do. If so, it may be asked whether the man might go about doing whatever he liked with his three kinds of organs, mind, speech and body. The answer is that doing so is not in keeping with his svarība or essential nature. It is true that he has nothing (wore) to do with regard to the upāya or means, but he should direct these viz., mind, speech and body to the rendering of service which is the goal of his existence. There are five kinds of service which be can render for the rest of his life: (1) to study the Bhashya and to spread the knowledge obtained therefrom; (2) if the man is not qualified for it, to study the writings of the Alvars and spread their knowledge; (3) if the man is not competent to do it (i.e.) No. (2), to serve in holy temples sanctified (by the Alvars), by cooking food, by making chandanam, by lighting lamps and by weaving garlands (for use in the temples ); (4) if not competent to do (3), to meditate on the meaning of Dvaya;; (5) if not competent to do (4), to seek the good will of some Sri Vaishnava who is well disposed to bim and would look upon him as bis follower and spend his life with bim, 

PITFALLS IN THE PATH OF THE PRAPANNA: 

The man who is qualified to live in this way has to avoid pitfalls in front of him by behaving carefully in three matters. "They concern - (1) those who are suitable or favourable (anukula) (2) those who are unsuitable or unfavourable (pratikūla) and (3) those who are neither the one nor the other. The suitable are 

170 CHAPTER 

Sri Vaishnavas, the unsuitable are those that are the enemies of Bhagavan; those who are neither the one nor the other are those in samsära. The prapanna will rejoice at the sight of the suitable (anukila) as at chandana, flowers and the like and as at moonlight and the southero breeze and (other) beloved objects. At the sight of the unsuitable (pratiküla), he will be full of dread as at the sight of the serpent and the fire. At the sight of those who are Deither of these two, he will behave as at the sight of wood or stone and treat them (with indifference), as if they were straw. If they are agreeable, he sh uld impart the knowledge of truth to them ;, otherwise, he should pity their sad fate. It is the inclination for wealth and sensual pleasure that stands in the way of such behaviour. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, & mon should treat & Sri Vaishnava with disregard or contempt, he would provoke the wrath of Bhagavan in the same way as & man who treats the prince with disrespect in the presence of the king would provoke the king's anger. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should remain subservient to those who are unsuitable, he would provoke disgust in the mind of Bhagavan in the same way as a queen who, while her lord is an en perur, begs alms of the mean and unworthy would provoke disgust in the king's mind. If & man should treat with respect those who are neither the one nor the other, the Lord would have no regard for him, as his knowledge serves no useful purpose like that of one who cannot distingaish between a gem and a piece of stone", 

SRI RAMANUJA'S ADVICE EXPLAINED: 

Io connection with this code of conduct prescribed by Sri Ramanuja for the prapanna, we have to remember that the pursuit of wealth and sense pleasures which are against dharma bave already been probibited altogether (for all including non prapannas) es in the following slokas:- "One should not\*, in any circumstances and even in critical times, accept any gifts, pot

even # cowrie, from an unchaste woman, a eunuch, an out.caste (patita) or an enemy." "They are dear to me. they who are born blind to the imperfections of others, who are eunuchs in regard to the wives of other men and who are dumb in the matter of censuring others." So the injunction contained in the Bhashyakāra's words (really) means that even in regard to the acquisition of wealth and sense-pleasures which are not opposed to dharma, the prapanna shoald not deviate from his proper state in regard to these three classes of persons, the suitable, the upsuitable and those who are neither of these two. That those who are suitable should not be treated with disregard is declared in Sandilya 

with disregard; so also Bhagavan does not like those who do not treat bis bhaktas with due respect." That those who are unsuitable should not be associated with, is declared in the Mahabharata : “Those who hate Kesava, the Supreme Being, and cannot, meditate on Him - to them and to those who 388ociate with them with respect, there will be no benefit at all from bathing in the holy waters". So also it it said: "One should not Associate with fools, with those who are addicted to sin, with those who are crael by nature, and with those who criticise adversely the sāstras of Bhagavārı (Pancharatra). Association with them will pat an end to bhakti". That those who are neither the one nor the other should be treated like straw is well known from slokas like the following:- "Omen of the world, from this day onwards, you are what you are and we are what we are. You are in quest of wealth and sense pleasures; we are in quest of Narayana (80) there cannot be any companionship between you and us. We are the servants of the Lord; you are the slaves of the senses". The words that the prapanna should walk warily (lest he should fall into pitfalls) indicate that the (five) services ordained as essential by the Bhashyakara (in his words quoted above) stand in the same category as services like Sandhyāvandana which can be

5. ?172 CHAPTER 

learnt only from the sästras and that, for that reason, these five, too, should be done in accordance with the injunctions prescribed in the sāstras, in order that they may become real and proper services. It may be asked: ("How can bis (Sri Ramanuja's) words be interpreted to include also those rites and duties that are prescribed in the sāstras and that these five services which he has specifically mentioned should also be done according to the sāstras?") The answer is that it is clear from the Bhashyakūra's words "If he should go about doing as he likes, it would be against his svarība or essential nature." As Alavandar puts it, "Whatever agrees not with the sāstras is Āsuric in nature; those ections that are opposed to the sāstras are inconsistent with his Dature which is godly". Further it has been said by the Lord who is entitled to our service - "The 'struti and the sinritis are indeed my commands. He who transgresses them violates my commands. He does injury to me. Though he may be devoted to me he should not be called & Vaishnava". Sri Ramanaja's meaning is that, since the Master bas also made this declaration, the prapanna should serve in accordance with the sõstras as long as he lives in the body. In his Gītārtha Sangraha. Alavandar says : - "From the? karmas pertaining to one's varna and äsrama to bhakti yoga, one should perform everything, directed by love alone (of the Lord). One should give up the notion that these are upāyas or means (for attaining one's ends). One should place the upāya without fear on God; (i.e) one sbould realise that Bhagavan is alone the upāya)". It is obvious that 'by love alone' excludes the notion that it is an upāya owing to the word 'alove' and this idea is elaborated in "having given up the notion that these are upāyas or means". It is true that, that the love (of the Lord) is indicated as having & wonderful power of inspiring one to service prescribed in the sāstra. But in the words "from the karınas pertainingto one's varna and asrama", it is shown that the nature of these karmas has to be ascertained only from the süstras.

ORDINANCES OF SASTRAS 

173 

This ordinance imposed by the sāstras is well known from the following slokas in the chapter on prapatti : " In order that there may be no violation of dharma, for the protection of the family, for kezping ignorant men in the right path by setting them an example, for the preservation of the nuoral law as defined in the sāstras, for diy (Lakshmi's ) satisfaction and for the satis. faction of the Lord armed with Sarnga who is the God of all gods, the prapanna who is wise should aot even think of transgressing the ordinances of the Veda". The evil that would result from the transgression is described immediately afterwards as follows : “Even a king's favourite, who, because it serves no purpose of his own, destroys the bund of a river dug by the king's orders, which is of great use to the world, is beautiful in itself and causes abundance of crops, - even be will be impaled for having done so ); So also though he may be dear, tbe man who violates the ordinances of the Vedas is do favourite of mine inasmuch as he violates my commands.” If, having offended the Lord, the prapanna does pot seek pardon, it will produce, before he attains mukti, some evil or otber in accordance with his specific qualification. 

That apart, there is no greater bell (for the prapanna) than the displeasure caused to Bhagavān. This displeasure of Bhaga van will disappear if he obtains pardon. (As the Gita says) Iswara, by His very nature, is full of love to all. So till His displeasure disappears, it will give the prapanna excruciating pain. If the man has no such pain, bis devotion to the Master and his desire for rendering service after moksha have to be doubted. 

Since this violation of the Lord's command is opposed to the Lord's pleasure wbich is our final goal as stated in the sloka : "When shall I, Thy servant, look upon Thee alone as my Master and

give the delight by rendering service ?" the observance of the ordinances of the sāstras bas to be understood in those places in the three mysteries (mantras) where the removal of obstacles is referred to. In the case of those who have not completed their adoption of brapatti) the upāya, the observance of these ordinances will remove the hindrances or obstacles to the completion of prapatti and win for them the grace of the Lord. In the case of those whose adoption of the upāya is complete, it will win the favour of the Lord by removing the causes that might bring about His displeasure (in future). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The paths indicated in the sāstras deal with acts or rites of two kinds: obligatory and permissive. The former have to be done for avoiding the Lord's punishment and the latter for obtain. ing the respective benefits. 

Even when a permissible act is performed, if there is violation of the prescribed method, it becomes an offence or violation of the command. Therefore transgression of the rule prescribed in the s'astra is nowhere countenanced. 

When the same rite is prescribed both for avoiding a trans gression and for obtaining a benefit - in that rite, there is a mingl. ing of competency (adhikara) according to scholars. When the same karma or rite is prescribed as nitya (obligatory) and also kamya (for the sake of a benefit), the act or rite performed for the specific benefit will serve (also) as the performance of the nitya (by that single performance). 

In rites (karmas or services) prescribed for the attainment of certain benefits, the benefit will not be obtained, when the service is not performed, but there is no transgression. Such is the opinion of competent scholars.

TAMIL VERSE: 

By following the four Vedas (and the Smritis and other sastras) in which the Supreme Being who measured the three worlds with His feet has ordained what is right and what is wrong, we have attained the state of service similar to that of the eternal sūris who are full of the love (of God). To us who live in the dark night (of samsāra), there is no other light than that of this moon (viz. the sāstras) to dispel the darkness that grows denser and denser at every step. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The wise man learns what is in accordance with the will of the Ruler\* who is the originator of the Universe; from the Srutis ; from the Smritis ; and from the traditional practice of elders ; from the promptings of his own reason in the case of the man with a pure heart; from good resolutions not departing from dharma; and also the traditional practice of the family, of the fcharana and of the country. Sometimes he tries to understand the Lord's will from the commands of those who are competent to direct him and also from omens, sigas, dreams and the like.
