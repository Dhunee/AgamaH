<li>THE CHAPTER ON THE DUTIES OF A SISHYA.</li>
</ol>
<p>T WIL</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA :</p>
<p>The sishya or disciple should be staunch in his devotion to the guru; he shonld be intent on doing such things as extending the renown (of his guru) (and rendering service to him); he should have the greatest regard for such things as his guru&rsquo;s propesty and his house, he should guard the spiritnal tradition in order to hand it on to another who is worthy; the sislıya who is grateful and is perfect in his performance (vf the ordained rites) is he not sure to attain the trensure (viz.) Bhagavan ?</p>
<p>THE SERVICE RENDERED BY THE SISHYA TO THE</p>
<p>GURU IS IN NO IVAY A RECOMPENSE:</p>
<p>The sāstras say that since the acharya reveals the meanings (and mysteries) of religion like one who reveals to a poor man the existence of a great treasure within his house, the sishya should feel graieful to the úchuirya, who is the great bencfactor, and never do anything against his interests. The sastras declare that the sishya should behave in this way) merely in order that he may not be looked upon with contempt by (those who are in) the two vibhūtis (i, e) this world, the lili tibliti and ihe region of eternal glory (nitya vibhiti) and by the Lord who los tipae (twer) rimlilis. (They give this advice) in order that the (s&rsquo;ishy) may not Teemble such men as Hiranya and Rivana who did evil to Prahlada and Vibbishana for giving the wholesome advice. It has been stated:- &ldquo;The in-and who steals larning ( by listening to the sichārya without his periission and in hiding&rsquo;, the man who does evil to his gurit, and the man who speaks all of the Vedas and of the Lord wbo rules over all these men, the s&rsquo;rutis declare, shonld be punished at once&rdquo;. So when the sishya is asked to behave properly to the guru, it is not to say that, by doing so, he will make due requital or recompense (for what the guru has done</p>

<p>to him), but that he would then avoid the evil consequences for himself (referred to above).</p>
<p>It is said: &ldquo;The sishya shunld surrender his body, his property and his life-breath to his guru&rdquo;, and likewise it is said, “The sishya* should give his guru is dakshina the whole of his wealth or one half of it or one fonrth of it. If he is unable to do $0, he should give whatever he can.&quot; These slokas state only some of the duties of the sishya like prostration (namaskars) and salutation (abhivadana). They do no not consider this gift as a requital or recompense to the uchiryu, who does not expect any such return and imparts instruction merely as a patter of duty; for it is said: “The guru&rsquo; should teach out of compassion and without any desire (for profit)&quot;.</p>
<p>When it is stated in the Vedantas that the sishya should behave towards the guru as towards Bhagavan (Himself) and should have as devoted an aflection to the gurie as to the Lord, when it it said, “Tue sishya should never ruisbehave cither with the mind or with the speech or with the borly and should behave towards him as if he is not different or separate from hituself&quot; and further, “The s&rsquo;ishrau should adore the vichiirya as he does Bhagavan &ldquo;&ndash;when writers like Sandilya and Apastauiba say so, they do not prescure the offer of a fee or recompense. They give the advice merely in order that the s&rsquo;ishig&rsquo;a who has the sāsira for his eyes Day 1)et become blind of vision with eyes wide open, and in order that he, poor from his birth onward, may not lose this (blisstul) expezivrice which resembles the (blissful) experience of Bhagavan. That all this is no fe or recompense (to the gurie) has been declarrd by Sandilya Bhagavan in the following sloku : “Even the gods cannot make a recompense for the gift of the knowledge of God. The s&rsquo;ishya should (therefore) give whatever lies in his power to the richuryu who has given biin (this) instruc tion.&rdquo; When it is said &quot; whatever lies in his power&quot;, it rueans</p>

<p>that it should be given as an outlet for his affection and regard. The s&rsquo;ishya should, on Do account, consider himself as having thereby recompensed his guru.</p>
<p>THE DUTIES OF THE SISHYA :</p>
<p>The sishya, who is thus without any means of recompensing (his guru), should consider it his duty to behave as follows:&ndash; He should not let the instructions imparted to him become useless like water kept in a skull, by actions and observances opposed to them; for it has been said : - “Water kept in a skull and milk preserved in a water-skin made of dog&rsquo;s leather becoine worthless owing to the impurity of the containers. So also does the s&rsquo;üstra taught to one who misbehaves. The sishya should not make mere learning an end in itself, for it is said: “That süstra &lsquo;which, having been earnt from the üchürya, does not lead to non-attachment (to worldly things), to the performance of dharma or to serenity of mind that sāstra, however beautiful in its diction and style, is as useless to the man as the cawing of a crow.&quot; He should not eat the vomit, as it were, by making the sāstra which comes out of his mouth the means of his livelihood. He should not make the sastra the prostitute&rsquo;s adorament, the sandal paste (chandana) inade only for sale, the bag of parched rice emptied in a thorough. fare, or the garland of flowers in the monkey&rsquo;s hands, for it has been said in ridicule :- Learned to men who study their subjects carefully, again and again, owing to their greed for money make their learning useful to others like prostitutes adorning their persoas again and again to serve (the lusts of) others.&quot;</p>
<p>Learning approached the Brahmio and said, &ldquo;]&rdquo; am your wealtb; guard me with care; do not give me away to those who bave no liking (for me). If you guard me in this manner I shall become very powerful&quot;. As desired in those words, learning should not be betrayed into the bands of those who already clasp hate and the like in their hands.</p>

<p>DUTIES OF THE SISHYA</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>The sishya should clearly realise that he cannot make any r&rsquo;e. compense to the acharya who has enabled him, though born blind, to become fit for the assembly of the immortals that are free from ignorance and error. As tanght in the sloka: “ The man who worships Bhagavan alone (the ekiintin) shonle, while speaking of himself, call himself the follower of Vishon. He should never refer to himself by his village, or his family, for, to him, Bhagaran is every thing&quot;. Superior to this is the state (described by Viswa. nitra while addressing Dasaratha ): - &quot; This is adeed befitting one wbo was born of a noble: race and who always calls himself Vasishta&rsquo;s disciple. No one else would call himself so, ( lest of kings”. The s&rsquo;ishiya should realise that the Saviour* Hlinuself was born in such a family and adopted this form of referring to hinuself and should adopt it in his own life saying :&ndash;&ldquo;You have &ldquo;reformed me froin wickedness. What requital can I make to</p>
<p>you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE IMPARTING OF INSTRUCTION SIIOULI) BE PRECEDED BY MEDITATION OF THE SUCCESSION</p>
<p>OF GURUS:</p>
<p>When the s&rsquo;ishja hands over the great wealth of the truths contained in the gist of the three mysteries (mantras) thus acquired lig binn (from his cichuirga) to one who, as pointed ont in an earlier chapter, has been found fit for it, he should impart instruction first on the succession of ichiryas and reveal also his gratitude (to them) and the sacredness of those truths. As an example are quoted the words of the Brahmarishi Sri Parasara to Bhagavan Maitreya:&ndash; &quot; Brahma, born of the lotus, the grand father of all, first gave instruction to great sages like Daksbu at their request, In that same way was the instruction imparted by them to King Purukutsa on the banks of the Narbada. He banded it over to Sarasvata and by Sarasvata was it imparted to me&rdquo;. When the</p>

<p>578 СПАРТRR</p>
<p>man who imparts instruction in the mysteries of the science of the soul is without a tradition and teaches (merely) on the strength of his own reading of the books or of what he over-heard from (a hiding place) bebind a wall, he will, like one who wears stolen jewels. be ever in dread of those that see him. Moreover it inay even become sinful, for it has been said :- &ldquo;The mantra&rsquo; which is learnt by mere chance by one in hiding, under some pretext or from books &ndash; that mantra will be of no avail; on the other hand, it may even cause evil&rdquo;. Even when &amp; man has learnt from a guru and then teaches, if he sbould learn and teach against the regulations enjoined for it, he would create disgust in the minds of onlookers like one who wears jewels made from the inoney given to bim along with &ldquo;Kala &lsquo;* (These regulations) may be seen in the following slokas &quot; Bow to the guru,&rdquo; ask for explanations, render service to him and then learn the essential nature of the self&quot;.</p>
<p>It is said also, &ldquo;Maitreya prostrated (pranipatya) before Parasara and made salutations to hiin (abhivadya)&rdquo;. As stated in the s-loka :-&ldquo;He who impartsla instruction in violation of the regu lations and he who learns violating the regulations — of these two, one will die or will come to bate the other&rdquo; as stated here, it may even have evil consequences. Even when the nian has learnt according to the regulations and then teaches, if he should not render dne praise to his guru, his sishya may suspect that the truths revealed by him may have no basis (or authority) like para Hitic plants growing (on the branches of trees) and treat them with Jisregard. This omission of giving due praise to one&rsquo;s guru before (ne&rsquo;s sishya is included a one among the thirty-two kinds of offences. It has been stated: “ T&rsquo;he wise nad should reveal (the greatness of) his guru and guard the mantra with great care.</p>
<p>(NOTE * Kala : When a man is dangerously ill and longs for recovery. he has the figure of a man (K’alapurasha) made with gingely seeds, decks it with jewels and gives it to a poor man along with money. To receive such a gift is looked upon as a disgusting thing.) 16. Padmasamhita : Charyapada: 23 - 49. 19. Mahabharata : Santi parva: 17. Bhagavad Gita: 4 - 24.</p>

<p>DUTIES OF THE SISHYA</p>
<p>By the owission to reveal (the former) and the omission to guard (the latter) respectively, a persons&rsquo;s wealth and term of life suffer diminution&quot;. (By this on ission), the wealth of enjoying Bhaga. van with clarity of knowledge and the state of mind wbich consists in the thought of one being il s&rsquo;esha, which is the cause of the soul or self becoming and continuing as an entity - these two will suffer decline. If, while revealing the greatness of his guru, a man should contradict the teaching imparted to him by the gurn in the sastras, he would be called a vleceiver and become also &amp; sioner, for it is said: &ldquo;Ile who &ldquo;leaches astronomy, law, the sustra of expiatory rites and the science of medicine against the spirit of the respective sāstras is called a Brahmaghitaku&rdquo; or one who has committed the sin of killing a Brahipin &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Tf a man should fail to impart instruction to a worthy sishya at the appropriate time, he would be called a miser and incur also the sin of violating the Lord&rsquo;s command contained in the sloka : “One should cast off one&rsquo;s body after imparting one&rsquo;s knowledge of the self to a worthy s&rsquo;ishya. A man should not die without iniparting to a worthy s&rsquo;ishya that knowledge which is the cause of the world&rsquo;s being (or which is the cause of the world&rsquo;s knowledge)&rdquo;. Therefore when the king&rsquo;s torch-bearer is commanded by the king to go on i certain mission, he would hand over the torch in his hand to some one who is found fit for it and then start (on bis mission). When a inan imparts instruction in a similar manner to a pupil who is apt for it, he should first reveal (the greatness of) his guru and then teach the truths taught to him. Even when, owing to some (favourable) circumstances, he has received divine vision and divine anditions and learnt truths with their help, he should express the truth in the following words: - &ldquo;I learnt this owing to the grace of my great ūchiirpa. I am not stating what I learnt by my own cleverness&rdquo; This is what (Sanjaya), for exanıple, says : &ldquo;By the graces of Vyasa did I hear, directly, this great Yogasastra, which Sri Krishna, who has wisdom and</p>

<p>other attributes taught in person&rdquo;. If he should say so, the truths that he teaches would be held in high esteem. He would (also) then be esteemed as &amp; grateful sishya by sātvikas. As one who spoke the trath, he would be regarded by the Upanishads and by the Person revealed in the Upanishads as an authority having the same validity as they themselves are. His acharya too, would feel gratified to find that, in this grateful and diligent s&rsquo;ishya, his labours have borne fruit.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>He who imparted instruction in the vidyās or meditations that lead directly and by themselves to moksha &ndash; he is considered in the süstras on moksha as the greatest of ichāryas.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA :</p>
<p>The Vedas declare that a man attains moksha by having an acharya and the same is declared in the Swritis also. Tchairyas knew that, in this world and so also, in the world beyond, the feet of the acharya are the refuge (for the s&rsquo;ishya).</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Even (the omniscient and omnipotent) Mayan cannot requite the acharya who dispelled all the darkness (in the mind) by lighting the bright lanıp of wisdom therein. (Therefore) for what was received before (from the acharya), it is indeed very little (that is done by the sishya) in reconting his praise with delight, in constant meditation of him, and in extending his growing renown.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>The tip of the achirya&rsquo;s tongne shines hright being the throne on which is seated (the god) Hayagriva. So we do not consider any deity as being higher than the acharya. Even Narayana plays the part of the itchürya without ever giving up His supreme greatness, in order to save those who are sugk in the sea of samsāra.</p>
