THE CHAPTER ON THE CHARAMA SLOKA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

(1) Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, who stands close to the Upaniṣads and from whuni, as from the boundless ocean of mercy, came of its own accord, the śloka (Charama śloka) which puts an end to the sorrows of all men, - by seeking Him as our refuge in \*accord ance with the injunction (contained in that stola), and as the eternal dharna (Siddhopāyal, we feel happy with our sins extin. gnished and free from (all) doubts and fears. 

\* NOTE:-- or by good luck (ridhina). 

(2) Many are the paths prescribed in the srutis) (Karma yoga, Juana joga and Bhakti goga), they are hard to understand and impossible of adoption owing to the restrictions and observan ces enjoined for them; the fruit to be attained by pursuing thein is at too great a distance and (above all) they are unsuitable for simple folk (destitute of intelligence and ability) to us who feel anxious on these accounts, (He who is) the easy highway, the charioteer and the guide of all men, has, by His grace, enjoined certain victuals (the charama śloka) for the journey in order to lead us to His own feet without any bindrances. 

TAMIL VERSE: 

OS 

In order to afford salvation to all the beings created with ope biod by Himself and Lakṣmī of shining bracelets, He became the son of Vasudeva so that the beautiful city of Dwaraka night prosper. He was then pleased to be the charioteer of the princes (the Pandavas) and He has beconie for us the unique dharma (Siddhopāya ) which He, with Tulasi flowers adorning His chest, has Himself declared to us and pats a stop to the game of blind. man's buff which stood in the way of our seeing, enjoying and 

bearing His feet (in Vaikuṇṭha) op our head.

INTRODUCTION TO CHARAMA SLOKA: 

\* This' Narāyaṇa, the Lord of Sri, who abides (for everi in the ocean of wilk has left His serpent-bed and arrived at the city of Madhura." As stated in this śloka, the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of Sri, incarnated in the beautiful city of Dwaraka in order to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma on a firm footing; He became easily accessible to every one, and assumed tbe role of a messenger to the Pandavas who had sought His protection, as stated in the passage : "On being\* thus advised, the sons of Pritha and the twins made namaskarams to Janardana, () best of men, along with Draupadi." He made Arjuna the warrior in the chariot and acted as his charioteer to do his bidding. This Arjupa realised that the Lord of all had determined to slay his enemies using him as a (mere) instrument, and that the destruction of his kidsnen was certain. He became troubled in wind by inopportune affection and inopportune campassion and by the fear that the slaying of his ūcharyas and others, thongh they appeared (against him) in war-like trim, was a sin. So be wanteil to know what was tbe proper thing for him to do and begged (Sri Kr̥ṣṇa) saying, "Bes pleased to tell me what, you feel sure, is to my lasting benefit. I am your disciple and have sought your pro. tection. Therefore advise me as to what I should do”. In order to dispel his grief, the Lord explained to him the eternal and essen. tial nature of the soul or self (āitman) which is different from the body and the like (the senses etc.) and likewise karma yoga and jnānu yoga, which are, to the man who understands this essential nature, the mediate means for attaining the supreine goal and also bhakti yoga which has been enjoined as the primary and direct means of attaining it, as also all its accessories. Though Arjuna was eagar to attain this supreme end quickly, he thought it too hard to perform it (bhakti-yoga) with all its accessories and though he had the knowledge and the ability needed for its adoption, he realised that the nature of this upaju was such that it would secure

the end in view only after a very long period of adoption and after unceasing attention and that the end in view could not be attained quickly, So Arjuna became overwhelmed with despair. Vader the guise of teaching Arjuna, the Achirya of the Gitopanishad is graciously pleased, out of His infinite compassion, to expluin this most secret upāya (viz. prapatti) in the charama śloka which is the conclusion of the teaching and which leaves nothing unsaid. Prapatti which is one of the upüyas that be enjoined as optional in the sloku: "I can be attained by those who desire to serve ne only by bhakti or by prapatti. There is no other way of attaining ine", is the means alike, of attaining His feet and all other things that are desired, for it has been said, “Only so long as "prapatti which extinguishes all sins is not performed, only so long will there be suffering, etc." It can be performed without any accessories other than the determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord and the avoidance of what is adverse to Him and the like. It is tasier of performance and can be done in just an instant. Since the Supreme Lord, who is the Savionr, has Himself taught this truth which is well known from the sirutis, it has also the sanction of the cicluirga (for Bhagavan is Himself the wchary«r here). The permission of the ācārya is prescribed in such treatises as Viṣṇu. tuttva as follows: - "Giving Sup all object of desire and the kurmas by which they can be secured, Saraṅgati with its five ringas (the angus and the ange heing six ) should he performed with the permission of the üchirja in accordance with the rules prescribed in the sustras and with renunciation of the fruits of all actions." 

SARVA PHARMĪN ETC. We have refuted, at considerable length, in Tütparya chait. strikā and Nikṣepa-rakṣui, the interpretations given of this śloka by such perverse (cominentators ) as Saṅkara. Here we will state the best and most appropriate meanings as established in the tradition of wise men. The first half of this (śloka) enjoins the

468 CHAPTER 

upāya, the second ball is the sesha which is subordinate or supple wentary to it by way of indication of the end to be attained by that upüya). Therefore the main purport of this siloka is to prescribe the upāya. Dharma is & means of attaining an object which can be understood solely from the sāstra. The use of the plural forn), dharmant, indicates the manifold nature of the dhar. mias enjoined in the süstra as the means of attaining the desired objects or ends. The word sarva (all) suggests that these dhar. mas) have certain accessories or angas. There is certainly no impropriety in calling the accessories to dharma by the word dharma. If (on the other hand) we interpret the word sarva (all) as the opposite of 'one', it would indicate the manifoldness of the angis (the dharmas theroselves). 

Though the word dharma is used without any qualification or restriction, yet what is intended (by the word) here is the various kinds of upasana, or ineditation prescribed for the attaioment of mokṣa in the sústras with all their accessories (such kinds of meditation as dahara vidyā, sad vid yıi and Sandilya vidya). The knowledge of Purushottama (which is praised highly in the Gitu (Chap. XI) is conclusively shown in (Sri Rāmanuja's) Gita Bhuishya and elsewhere as leading merely to the knowledge of the Truth or Reality which is of help to all vidyās or forins of meditation; the know ledge of the truth concerning the avatūrs (of Bhagavan) is shown in Ch. IV there as the cause of the adopted upisanas yielding their fruit quickly, residence in places where there are tewples of Narāyaṇa and the like are also shown to make the upasanas effective by the removal or extinction of those sins which stand in the way of the upasanas bearing fruit. Therefore it is not proper to consider them as direct and primary means of attaining mokṣa and to state that the plural form of dharma, vix, dharmin is used to include these also, (for they are only mediate culises of mokṣu and not direct causes like the repaisanās). This plural form dharmith is sigoificant io as much as it refers to such different and many vidyās, as Sündily vidyā and dahara vid y even without the three mentioned above ((viz) the knowledge of Purushottama and 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

469 

of the avatars and residence in holy places ), for it has been said \* The "vidyās are many, as their names and the like are different;" there is no impropriety even if we take the plural to signify the manifoldness of the angi's (forins of meditation) and of the angas or their accessories. 

THE MEANING OF PARITYAJYA (HAVING GIVEN UP). 

la the word purityijyt, the 'giving up' or abandonment consists in the aversion to other kinds of upāya (than prapatti), which arises from a consideration of one's being destitute of the competency for them, for it has been said, "By this 'prapatti and with only akinchanya or one's being without other upāyas as a prerequisite etc)". If there is connexion due to desire, the giving up of that desire is certainly #yāga or renunciation. 

The preposition pari (before tyaj) is to show the extreme aversion arising from the lack of competence (for other upüyas ) at all times and in every form, which the person destitute of upāyas has come to realise in himself as expressed in the following passages, “I see no means of crossing (the sea of sainsāra) in all the eternity of time which lies before me," and " It is 'only by the lotus feet of the Lord that I shall attain the desired goal. I have no other means of attaining spiritual welfare in any of my births." 

"Aversion in every form" means being without the improper desire to perform what is impossible for a man with the thought: “Though I cannot adopt the upāya in full perfection, I will do it to the best of my ability; when that also is too difficult to perform, I will adopt, in the place of the prescribed angas, something less difficult or the upāyas which will produce the prescribed upājas",

470 CHAPTER 

The object of this anuvāda\* (statement of what has already occurred) pamely sarva dharmān parityajya (which is not a Tidli or injunction) is to indicate the person who is specially competent to adopt prapatti, The preposition pari in parityajya is to indicate the person who is most competent or has full con petency. In the sentence:- "Having to reacbed this world which is perishable and without pleasure, you should resort to me with devotion," having reached does not state a vidhi or injunction meaning - "Reach this world". It only means 'Being in this would' or 'since you are in this world'. So also, here, the words sarvadharmūn parityajya do not mean give up all dharmas'. It should be taken to mean: "You that have given up all dhar. mas". Since this usage of having done a thing' (past participle) is met with in other senses also, it is not right to say that 'having given up all dharmas' or giving up all dharnas is one of the accessories enjoined for prapatti. 

If parityajya (having given up) is to be considered (at all) as enjoining what should be done (vidhi), there is nothing wrong in stating that it enjoins, as in the chapters on Prapatti and else where, the thought of helplessness (kiirpasya) which is of the nature of such thoughts as being destitute of upãyes. In that interpretation, sarva dharman parityajya would mean "Reflect at first on the state in which you are unfit for the adoption or per formance of every form of dharma" (in this case it would be a vidhi). This state has been (well) expressed in such passages as the following: "lam the abode of all offences (against Thee) and I have no means of saving myself oor have I anything else to attain than Thee", and "I have not performed dharma with any constancy; I have not realised the nature of the self nor have I bhakti or devotion to Thy lotus feet". Even this interpretation, which is not the meaning that strikes one immediately and is 

\*NOTE: What is meant is not that the person should give up but that as he is unable to adopt other dharmas, he should seek the Lord as an upāya.

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

471 

therefore a little strained, is better than the meanings given by Saṅkara and others that what is intended here is such as the giving up of the dharmas themselves in their essential nature (svarīpa), because it is not out of keeping with any pramūnas (for in the chapters on prapatti, it is enjoined that the rites and observances of castes &pd üs'ramas should (always) be performed). 

When we take partyajya is a vidhi or injnnction, it would be appropriate to say that the meaning of sarva dharmūn parityajya is - "No durma of any kind need be performed for the sake of prapatti", in the sense that prapatti does not require any of them (als anges). In that case, the use of the preposition pari woold suggest that even such observances as are stated in " This should be done after performing achamana" and "This should be done with bodily purity", which are requisite for securing fitness for all rites in common, are not to be accepted as angas for prapatti. 

Notwithstanding this, if it is nuaintained that the giving up of such charmos as kurma g'ogu, jrūna joga and bhakti yoga in their essential forın (svarīpa) is an anga or accessory to prapatti, it would follow that prapatti is not in the competence of any one. The abandonment of a dharma can be enjoined only in the case of a person who is capable of perform ing it. This would be opposed to the thought of helpless. ness ( kürparya ), which is called an «nga ( of prapatti ) according to many pramīṇas. It would also be opposed to the tradition that prapatti is for those who are destitute of upāyas, which is evident from such passages as the following: "I am without any upüyas and have no other saviour". "I was not born into any of the four castes so as to be competent for the performance of dharma". "I have given" up the rites to be performed by a Brahmin who has the mark of worshipping the three fires after ablution", and "I am not well established in the

472 CHAPTER 

performance of dharma, nor have I realised the pature of my self 

etc. 

To state that the jiva (kṣetrajna) is eternally incapable of all other upāyas, since he is entirely dependent on and subject to the control of Īśvara and (in the same brenth) to state that the giving up of these dharmus or upāyas is enjoined on him is against all s'iistrus and is opposed also to the very words of these writers and their actual practice. (For bow can a man give up a dharma which he is not capable of performing? How can i inan proceedi to perform kainkarya, if he is incapable of it owing to otter depen dence and subjection?). It would, therefore, he extremely ridi. culous to hold this view. If this view were right, thep by the same logic, even the vidhi contained in vraja (seek me etc.) would be iwpossible of perfornance. 

The statement that the jirutma is eternally incapable of all other upāras would only go to confirm the view that parityajya (here, does not enjoin the giving up and) only states what has already occurred (anuvārda) (owing to ipability ), which these writers would not like to accept. 

(Further) the 19e of a single set of words in a single sentence cannot mean both the statewent of what has occurred owing to inability in the case of the man who is not capable and the injunc. tion to the man who is capable of performance to give it up ( which is another view held by sowe) 

Nor can it be held that the option is given to the same person (adhikūrī) who is capable of performing charme either to perform the dharma or to give it up. This would mean two alternative courses, one of which is difficult and the other light, when there is no difference in the object of attain njent. For if the ruan who is capable of adopting the difficult "piya is enjoined to adopt the lighter or easier upāya by giving up the performance (of what he is capable of ), then no one would ever think of adopting the more difficult upüya and since there is no other way in which the 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

473 

difference in competency could be stated, all the sūstras which enjoin the performance or adoption of the more difficult upāya would carry no weight, 

It is also extremely inappropriate to say that, in order to stimulate the adoption of the easier upāya, the difficult upiya is (first) enjoined and then forbidden for performance. 

The view that what are not (really) upāyas are enjoined as upiyas (and are thereafter condemned as unfit for performance) - this view would tend to look upon the srutis and the Smr̥tis as deceptive. Even such things as the essential nature of the Savionr (which we learn only from them) could not (then) be known for certain, 

It is true that, in the world, among those that are desirous of wealth, some choose cultivation of the soil and other such difficult operations, while others choose lighter professions like dealing in rubies and other gems; but this option is determined by the differences in capacity or competence among the adhikūris. 

Kooarathalvan's commentary on the charama siloka :-"You that suffer (froin anxiety) because of the impossibility of adoption of other upāyas, give up everything that has been declared as the means of attaining nie and seek me as (your) refuge (tor salvation) 

this commentary, too, means only what has been explained (as the ineaning so far) and is not, therefore, opposed to it. (In that commentary 'giving up' states only what has occurred before (anuvāda) or nieans only "without doing it as an anga required for prapatti." 

It is true that, in such cases, as Sanāvartana or the conclu. sion of the Priijapatyavrata, baths accompanied by certain vratas or observances are prescribed and also (as an alternative) baths without any such vratas (which are easier). But this option is determined by the condition or the circumstances in which the person is situated. If we do not take it in this light, the enjoining474 CHAPTER 

of the more difficult alternative vould be of no use (for no one would adopt it). 

There is another (wrong) view that the adhikari competent for prapatti is the person who has fullness of knowledge or fallness of faith and that the adhikarī for upāsanā is the person who lacks this fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith. If this view were accepted, it would follow that such men as Vyasa who taught the churamaśloka and the like and who, because of their piety, had fullness of knowledge and fullness of faith should be looked upon as incompetent for upisani. There is no evidence or pramāṇa to prove that when they taught, they had knowledge and faith and having (later) become weak in intelligence and faith adopted upāsanā. There is no evidence in the respective accounts of their lives to sbow that though they were prupannas (with prapatti as their upāya) they practised upāsanii also for setting an example to the world. Even if this were adınitted to be a fact, the adoption of a dharma which is forbidden to a man for the sake of setting an' example to the world would be a sin so far as he is concerned and as the observance or adoption of the dharma is opposed to the mun's competence, it would not be a proper example to set the world right. (Sri Rāmanuja) has explained in the Gitā Bhishyu that loka saṅgraha consists in a man choosing one of two ways of life (permitted for himself) as being easy of performance by others and beneficial to them, and adopting that way of life as an example to others in order to establish them firmly in it. A sannyűsin adopting the way of life peculiar to the house-holder and forbidden to himself is not setting an example for the sake of the betterment of the world (lokasaṅgraha). This would be vnly the violation of the commandment (of the Lord). In the same way, the adoption by a prapanna of a dharna forbidden to him, under the mis apprehension that it would be a forin of kainkarya is also opposed to bis competency: 

There is nothing wrong in a prapanna perforining those rites that are prescribed in the sāstras and that are not required for prapatti with the idea that they are (forms of) kuinkarya (service). 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

475 

If it is maintained that as an anga or accessory of præpatti, men should give up all dharmas (rites and observances) appro. priate to their respective cistes (and asramas) and capable also of being perforined by thein, it would follow that they would lose the fruit viz, the kainkarya or service appropriate to their respective caste, rīsrama and the like, in the period after prapatti; (it would also follow) that they should give up also such dharmas as nod. violence and speaking the truth which are common to all and tbe showing of reverence to ācharyas and roam about like cattle, beasts and birds. 

It may be argued that dharmas which are of the Dature of refraining (from actions) and which are understood from probi bitory texts (such as do not kill ') are not activities calculated to protect oneself and are therefore not opposed to prahatti and that, owing to this what is intended here is only the giving up of such activities as are positive (pruvritti) (and not mere abstentions from activity). 'This argument, too, is unsound. Nivritti, abstention or renunciation, is also a form of activity arising from one's will or determination, and it too, may occur for the sake of protecting oneself as may be seen in the world and from the Vedas. (Prohi bitory texts in the Vedas presume that eveo abstentions are activities. Refraining from treasonable activities is often for the sake of protection of one's self from the penal code). 

If it be held that, on the strength of the injunction (vidhi) contained in parityajya), the prapanna should give up all dharias whether they be positive activities (pravritti) or absteu. tions from actions (nivritti) and that this is the real inteolion of the s'istras, then it would follow that the ancients who performed prapatti and those who are prapannas today have done and are doing what is against the süstras in performing different kinds of kuinkarya (pravritti) and in performing expiatory rites for offences (committed by them) (for what is forbidden should, on that view, be performed and no expiation would be necessary for it). These men who are propagators of the tradition of prapatti 10 accordance with the pramānas end who are also supremely 

476 CHAPTER 

compassionate could, under no stretch of imagination, be thought of as deluded or deceitful. 

It may be argued that this objection would stand only if the giving up of all dharmas (rites and observances) is enjoined (on the prapanna) for the rest of his life, and that it would not bold good, if the giving up of all dlarınas in their essential form (svarüpa) is considered as an anga (of prapatti) to be done only at the time of performing prapatti and if their resumption is pernitted after that performance. The answer to this argument is as follows:- " There is no need at all to enjoin the giving np of an activity or of an abstention which is not likely to be present at all at that time. If only such activities or dharmas in their svarūpa as are likely or possible at the time are enjoined to be given up, it would follow that prapatti should be performed after giving up such things as the following :-- residence in holy places sacred to Bhagavan, the tuft of hair, the sacred thread (yagnopa vita) and the wearing of the mark of the sect (pundra). 

Therefore the proper interpretation of the vidhi (if it be taken as vidhi) enjoining the giving up is this: "Prapalli does not require, as an anga or accessory, apy dharma or observance or rite which is required as an anga (such as harina) to uprisana (meditation) according to vidjüs'. 

ven in this view that parityajya indicates a vidhi or injunc tion to give up. the person competent for prapatti is one who is incapable of other upāyas, or one who, though capable of other upāyas, is too inipatient to endure the delay in attaining the fruit (which the other upāyas inight entail). If we take this view, it will not be agriost any of the pramūnas (viz those which enjoin the rites of the varias iod asramas, and those which enjoin bhakti yoga and the like). Former achiiryas did not discuss the point whether or not the giving up of all dhurmas in their essential forn is an anga of prapatti. Their discussions were confined only to the question of which words in the charama śloka respectively indicated the qualification necessary for prapatti viz. that of being 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

477 

destitute of otber upiigers and whicb words the idea that pripatti did not require (aoy anga or accessory). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Soine üchuryus, who were conversant with the requirements of a sentence, thought that the charamu śloka speaks first (in purityujya) of the person competent for prapatti (as one who is unable to adopt other upriyas) and then declares by the word ekam we alone) that proporti as an upcya does not require anything else as angn or accessory. Others said that the charama śloka speaks first of prapulti pot requiring anything else as angu and then declares who the competent person is for the easier rpüya in the word vraju) by the suggestion contained in the word soku or grief (in mii suchun) (for the grief should be the grief due to the man's inability to adopt other mpiyas). (There was no discussion among these earlier cluir yas of the point whether prapatti enjoined the giving up of all dharmas (even such as those ordained for the varias and the āsramas). Thus the discussion was confined only to the way in which the words (in the śloka) should he construed, though there was no difference in the meaning as a whole, and the anthor of Sri Bhushya did not stop the discussion. What was (wrongly) iunagined as having been the subject of discussion by other people who did not know what had formerly taken place -- that was shown to be without any foundation by such teachers as Vishpuchitta. 

But it may be asked how the difference between those who are competent and those who are not competent (for praputti) could be justified in the face of such slokus as the following: "'l5is is the upriya for those who do not understand; this is also the upāya for those who know well: this is the upcija for those who want to reach (quickly) the shore beyond saṁsāra and this is the upāya also for those who want (immediately) to render con. stant service to the Lord", and "Hari is the only upāya to 13. Lakṣmī Taotra; 17 - 100. 

14. Bhattar. 

478 CHAPTER 

those who do not know of other upüyas, either with tbeir ignorance or with their koowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord (of all), and on account of intensity of bhakti". The answer to this question is as follows:- The «jñānam or ignorance referred to in the word (ajnirat) in Lakṣmī Tantra and avidyātah in Bhattar's śloka is not the ignorance of such beings as cattle of what is stated in the sastras. It means only this much, lack of a clear understanding of such forms (of adora tion) as upasanas or ignorance, even in regard to prapatti, of subtle diceties or distinctions in it. The word vijānatiim in Lakṣmītantran (to those who know) and deve paribrudatayi viditaya (with the knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord of all) refer only to the kind of knowledge which enables one to understand such things as upasanas or the kind of knowledge which enables a man to have a clear understanding of such things as the qualities of the Saviour, which is necessary for prapatti. It does not (certainly) mean a knowledge of all things, in general, for only the koowledge of the Savionr's quality of being the Lord of all is referred to bere. Even if a man has this know ledge that is essential (for upasana), when he is withont the ability to adopt that (upasana), he is one that is destitute of upüyas (akinchan) and has competency for prapatti, 

Here another objection might be raised, viz.," }ven if a man has ( the knowledge and) the ability, he should remain without any endeavour on his own part, koowing as he does, the Saviour's nature, for does not Sita say:- "If Sii Rāma', who can destroy the hosts of his enemies, discharges his arrows on Lanka and takes me away from here, it will be the appropriate thing for him?". The answer to this is that (Sita's attitude ) would be an example of the pra. panna's later life (not of what he should do or should not do before prapatti). If this is not admitted, all süstras which enjoin the adoption of upāyas would be meaningless. 

15. Rāmayana : Sundarakanda : 39 - 30.

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

479 

Even when a man has both the knowledge of the other upāya (viz. upüsana) and the ability to adopt it, if he is too impatient to brook delay in the attainment (of the end), he may be competent for perforining prapatti, if he thinks that only prupatti would secure his object reco, (the quick attainment). This (that even the man who has the knowledge abd ability to adopt upūsana may adopt prapatti if he cannot lirook delay) is disclosed in the words: " This is the upüya for those who want to cross the sea of san süra"; "for those who want to cross', here, weaos "Those who want to reach the shore beyond samsura quickly (i, e) those that desire a quick removal of the hindrances that stand in their way. “This is the wpaya for those who desire tinantyan" (the perfect enjoyment of the service of Brahman) which is one's (lue on account of one's essential nature. Here also the meaning is 'those who desire to have it quickly' (i.e. those who cannot brook existence without that enjoyment. 

Having these two in mind, Bhattar says, "by the intensity of their bhakti." Here bhakti does not signify bhakti yoga, but 'intensity of the love (of the Lord)'. Intensity of bhakti or love means a state of inind in which the man would cease to exist if he could not have quick attainment. Though this is not the bhakti yoga enjoined for some adhikaris, jet some get that state of mind by the grace of Bhagavan due to righteous acts (in previous births). The man who has this state of wiod is also competent for prapatti. 

Therefore prapatti way be adopted by (1) those who do not know of other upüyas and who have a knowledge of what prapatti is in general (without a knowledge of details and distinctions); (2) those who have a clear understanding of prapatti and the other upāya (upāsana) but lack the ability to adopt the latter; (3) those who, though they have both the koowledge and the ability, cappot brook delay (in the attaidnient of the end) and cannot exist with out it. This man who cannot brook delay is also destitute of upāyas for attaining the end in his view at the time when he wants 

480 CHAPTER 

it (s0 he, too, is competent for prapatti). It is in consideration of this circumstance that (Bhattar) wrote:- " who know of no other upāya in the world". 

Vyasa and others who held administrative offices (under the Tord) could brook delay and were also capable of the other upüya (i.e.) upūsana. Therefore it is that they adopted upüsana and not because they were wanting in knowledge or in faith.

(If it be asked, "Why is it said in some places) that a man adopts upasanu owing to weakness of intelligence?" the answer is as follows):-" When a man is incapable of an upāya which is extremely difficult of adoption and yet adopts it because of an obstinate desire, the ignoring of the easy upāya should be con sidered as being due to weakness of intellect.” Or it is proper also to explain their adoption of the difficult upüra as due to their unfitness for prapatti (owing to their lack of faith in it and the like.) This is not the explanation in the case of Vyasa and others (adopt ing upisana), for they remove all the doubts of others (and cannot be considered as wanting in knowledge or faith). 

Since in this manner the competency of a man either for trpaisana or for prapatti is determined, both the śāstras (those of upisana and those of prapatti) have their own respective purpose. 

The difference between the two adhikāris in regard to the rites and observances of their caste and disrama is only the difference of the purpose for which or the thought with which they are perforiped. It is true that, in the case of the prapanila, the perforipance of any rite or observance will prevent the attaioment of his eod, because, like the Brahma missile, it would cease to have any effect, if any other rite is performed to attain the same end. But if these rites are performed for their own sake (without the desire for any fruit) or for such things as the glory of Bhagavad or 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

481 

the welfare of Bhagavatas, there is no impropriety (and prapatti would not lose its efficacy). 

But it may be asked by sonie:-“Even if it is admitted that the giving up of the dharmas themselves is not enjoined, it is possible that purityajya ( having given up) may mean the giving up of (only) the thought that they are upāyas. (The answer to this question is as follows:) "In those tests which refer to the activities of the prapanna after the performance of prapatti, it may be held rightly that what is ordained is the giving up of the thought that these activities are upāyas. But the charama-śloka is a text which enjoins an upuyu (before prupatti) and not what should be done after it, and the word parityajya occurs there, Therefore this interpretation would result in the injunction that these dharmas in their essential form sbonld be performed as angas or accessories to prapatti, but without the thought that they are upāyas. If this vicw were accepted, then, the view that certain things should be performed after prapatti merely for their own sake (without any aim, object or the desire for any fruit) and as mere service (to the Lord) would become untenable. (For they would still be angas or accessories and coold not be an end in themselves ). Nor could there be, in that case, the absence of any requisite or accessory dharma which is said to be the anique feature of pr«patti Thus this upāya would cease to be within the competence of the man destitute of all upüyas. This is how it would result. Tliere is no need to enjoin here the giving up of the thought of their being upāyas in regard to those dharnas that are not repüyas. So the performance of those dharmas which are upuyus without the thought that they are upāyas would only be the adherence to such upciyas as the old püsanas. If it is maintained that the word parityajya means the giving up of the thought of their being upāyas, then there would bave been no need to reconcile the conflicting statements about the ordinance con cerning abandonment and that about performance by saying that the difference is due to tbe persons competent for each of them, It is only if the text is held to enjoin the giving up of the dharmas 

482 CHAPTER 

themselves, there would arise any such conflict. If it is held that the adoption of karma, jñāna and bhakti, but without the thought that they are upāyas is an anga to prapatli, there would be no essential difference between the bhakta and the prapama. The difference would only be pomipa) . ) the man who has bhakti as the main and independent means and prapatti as an accessory to it could be called a bhakta and the man who adopts prapatti as the inain and independent means and bhakti as an accessory to it wonld be called a prapanna, but both wonld perform the same dharinas and there would be no difference in their action. 

It may be argued that, in regard to accessory activity, there Deed not be fullness or perfection of performance and that some short-comings might be allowed therein ; but this argnment is not sound. Has it not been stated:-"A rite or observance performed for the attainment of a certain frnit will yield the desired fruit, only when all the accessory rites or angas are duly performed?" (Part Mināmsā). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Thus if it is stated that the alarmus themselves in their essential forn should be given up, even the rendering of service would beconie an offence. If it is said that what is to be given up is only the thought that they are uspiyas, then the dharmas in their essential form would become an anga (of prapatti). 

It is only those who have torgotten the episodes of Kakasura and the like that world mainisin, as angas of prapatti, these 

harınas without the thought that they are upāyas and that the person is himself the doer of the action and its beneficiary (for the doership and the benetit are God's). 

We have (also ) heard that, by a single performance alone of prapatti far removed from any other dharma, the ancients obtained at once what they desired. .

If it is inaintained that the angas of blakti yoga which might be presumed as necessary also for prapatti are declared to be no necessary for prapatte and as being no augas to it, the potency of the upiya (prapatti), which is equal in might to the Brahma missile, becomes well established and the rendering of service and 

the like will also become appropriate. 

Therefore the view that here (in parityajya) the giving up of all dharmas, (rites, observances and the like) is enjoined (for prapatti) and the view that what is enjoined to be given up is only the thought of their Icing upüyas and the thought that they are argas to it -- these views conflict with such sāstras as ordain the observance of the corumandments, with the sustras nbich state that prapatti does not require anything else, with the tradi. tional observances of former üchāryas and with the code of conduct followed by virtuous mea in former times who had become prapannas. Thus owing to the objections pointed out so far, the giving up of all dharmas is not an anga to prapatti ; nor is the performance of these dharinas in their essential form an anga (without the thought of their being upriyus or angas to prapatti), because as has beeu stated before, praputti does not require the performance of any other dharma. Therefore this injunction or ordinance about giving up' (traga) has, for its purport, the stateinent that prupatti does not require any (aid) from any other alarma. 

To make this denial, there must be a wrong presumption of soioetbing that has to be denied. If it is asked what dharnas (rites, observances and the like) are presumed (wrongly) as being reqnisite and are then stated to be unnecessary (the answer is as follows) - In the vidyās or fornis of ineditation (upāsanas) t'njoined in Vedānta, some of the accessories which appear as angas in certain vidyas, such as the rites, duties and observances of the varnas and the asramas and also such things as meditation on the route to mokṣa are required also in other vidyös or forins of meditation. So also there may, at first, be a (wrong) presump484 CHAPTER 

tion that in nyüsavidyā too, these inigbt be required as accessary. To correct this presumption, here (in parityajya), these dharmas which might be thought of (wrongly) on the analogy of upūsanas as angas (to prapatti) are not required for it. This is the right interpretation of the text here. 

Though these dharmas capoot be considered as accessory aids (to prapatti) as they are stated to he for uprisana in Brahmcı Sūtras (3.4 -33), yet as stated in another siitrat (3 - 4 - 32), the karmas ordained for the different asramas have to be performed, as they are enjoined as ordinances or commands; there is nothing to prevent their perfornuance by the prapanna (since command ments have to be obeyed as such (and for no other reason). 

CONCLUSION: 

Therefore, as neither the performance of these dharmas por their giving op is an anga to pruputti; to be without the desire to do what is beyond one's ability is a mark of competency (for prapatti). The performance of those duties or rites which are niitya and nuimitlikat and which are within the range of one's ability takes rank as were service consisting in the observance of & command, 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

It is only the thought or the will to do wbat is pleasing to the Lord that is stated (in the süstras) as an ange of prapatti, The action arising out of that will or thought is not an anga. The rites of the varìu and israma are the proper thing to do in virtue of their being the Lord's command and not because it is the consequence of the will or the thonghat to do what is pleasing to Him, 

If so, it may be asked: "What is the purpose or object of performiog those manifold and great acts of service which cannot be included among the commands to perform nitya and naimittika 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

485 

karma?" These cannot be included among any of the other upāyas for mokṣa (because they are not performed with the object of attaining mokṣa); por are they angas or accessories to prapatti, because it does not require any such angas or aids. The person does not perforiu them because of the fear that the Lord would be offended at their non-performance, por does he perform them with the desire that they would bring about, by themselves, extinction of his sins or the attainment of such fruits as svarga, cattle, children and the like. Neither does he perform them merely for his own delight just like worldly men playing dice and the like, nor does he perform them to please the Lord having seen, like the freed souls, by actual observation, what would be approved of hy Him. If so, why does he perform them, it may be asked. (The answer is as follows) - He proceeds to perform them because it is evident from the sāstras that these acts of service have, for their fruit, the propitiation of the Lord (just like other fruits) As one in whose nature the quality of sattvam pre dominates, he acquires a taste for pleasing the Tord and follows the light shed by the lamp of the s'āstras in trying to give delight to the Lord who stands in varied relationships to him (ns father, mother etc.), in the saine way as he shows his love to his friends, 

children and the like. 

In this connection some may ask :- "In the case of the wise man who has made a complete surrender of all responsibility to the Lord of all, is not the criterion for deciding what should be given up and what taken up, the knowledge of his own essential nature (svarīpa?) So he is bound (only) by the knowledge of his own essential nature (to do or not to do this or tbat); why, then, should he follow the dictates of the sistras?". This question is improper, for, if it is determined what his essential nature is with the help of the s'āstras, then there is no other guide for him thap the sāstras, until the time of his attaining mukti, to help him to understand what aims in life he should avoid as also the upāyas therefor, and what aims he should have and also the upāyas for securing these aims. From the knowledge that he is sesha to the Lord and the 

486 CHAPTER 

like, it is just possible to know a few things that are appropriate to the sesha. The knowledge of one's essential nature cannot indicate, unequivocally, in what manner service shonld be rendered in order that it may please the s'eshi, and what upāyas should be adopted for this service. This beiog so, is one ignores the süstras and renders service with forbidden snbstances (like opium, say) or even among substances that are permitted, to render service with substances acquired unjustly and thus render service according to one's own sweet will and pleasure in ways opposed to what is enjoined in the s'āstras, then there wonld be no difference between reverential conduct and offence. Then since there is no criterion besides one's own's own taste, one might think of performing as service all that is considered as forbidden and therefore avoided by seekers after mukti. The author of Sri Blizslya has stated (in regard to the offering of food (havis) to Archi):- " Having "collected those things which are not prohibited in the sustras etc." Therefore the proper thing is to render such forms of service as are enjoined in the süstras as competent to the person concerned and subject to the dictates of the sistrus. The teaching contained in the śloka :- "To knows what onght to be done and what ought . not to be done, the only authoriy that you have is the śāstra. Therefore wbile you are here, noderstand the karma enjoined in the sustru just as it is” – this teaching is common to all ( what. ever their corupetency). Sri Alnvandar in his Grtirthasaṅgraha says:-"Among these ekuintins ( who are devoted exclusively to the Lord), the wise map (jmni) is called paramaikinti, one who has supienie devotion to the Lord to the exclusion of all other interests. Ilis being alive is solely dependent on the Lord, To be united with Him is bis (only 1 delight; to part from Him is his (only ) pain. His mind is always with the Lord. He considers himself as an entity only becanse of his meditating on Hiin, of visiting holy places (sacred to Hiin), and of speaking of Him to others, of bowing to Him and uttering his sacred names.

actioos are performed with his life-breath, miod, will and the senses all dedicated to Him. He performs all the duties pertaining to him and also practises bhakti inspired solely by love. He shonlu give up the idea of their being upüyas and place the upāya in the Lord without any fear". In these ślokas what Aḷavandār meant by the words "inspired solely by love" was not that he should ignore the sristras. His idea was to emphasise the great inspi. ration arising from his love (of the Lord), whose s'esha he is, to perform those acts of service which he can coderstand only from the s'āstras, in order to give delight to Him. When these ślokas are considered in relation to the man who practises upasanas ant the like, its aim is to show that these upāsanas are most pleasing to the person himself, that they are not the direct means of attain ing the supreme end, but are the means of winning the favour of the Saviour who is the direct means or upāya for obtaining this end, and that the Lord of all who is pleased by these upisanas stands, as the direct upāya for the attainment of this end. When the silokas are considered in relation to the man who has alopted prupalii as the principal and independent means, their aim is to show that, thongh he perforios the ordinances of nitya and nai. mittika karm and such other rites just as they are enjoined for blakti yogn, since he does not perforın them for the sake of other objects like starga and mokṣa and perforins then solely for pleasing the fiord, be has not adopted any other upāya (for mokṣer and has no other interests or object. (Their aim is also) to show that, as he is destitute of other payas, the Lord Flimself stands in the place of those i piiyas and rewards him with the desired fruit. 

Those who have not studied Vedānta might ask (in this connection:- Both these adhiküris (the bhakta and the prapanmu) are devoted solely and exclusively to the Tiord as stated (in the ślokas):-" \Vise men do not worship Brahma, Rudra and other gods, for the reward that can he given by them is limited," "They

488 CHAPTER 

are "my devotees who have no devotion to other deities, who love those that are devoted to me and who seek me alone as their upüya" and "He who has attained the lotus feet of Viṣṇu should not worship other deities." If these two adhikāris should perform the rites and observances of their castes and asramas as stated (ia Aḷavandār's ślokas! (viz., all the karmas pertaining to them and also bhakti), would not their supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord be adversely affected in as much as these rites or dharmas are mixed up with (the worsbip of) such gods as Agoi and ladra?" Here, as explained in the Brahma Sūtras (1-2-29), names like Agni may be considered, on the authority of Jainini, as directly referring to Brahman or Bhagavan for Agui and other such words may be etymologically derived as agram nayati. (He who receives the best part of the offering for Hunself) etc. There is no worship or contact with other deities, because they are like the sacred Dunes fonnd in Sahasraniima (etymologically applicable to Bhagavad). The author of Sri Bhashya has stated in his Nitya:--"Having pleased the gods, the rishis and the Manes with oblations and with the thought that they have Bhagavin as their inner self" etc. So it is perfectly in accordance with the sustras to perform these respective rites ineditating that the Supreme Being hus the respective deities as His body In "Pratardana vidya and the like we are taught in the sustras that the Supreme Being may be meditated on (or worshipped) in three forms: rone) in His own divine and essential nature, (two), the Supreme Being as having sentient beings as His attribute (or body), and ( three) the Supreme Being ay having non-sentient things as His attribute (or body). Though He is worshipped in these three ways, the worship is really to the Supreme Being and not to llis attributes (or budies) (namely . the sentient and non-sentient beings). In the same way here also, the bhakta or prapanna does not adore the gods, the rishis and the Manes, who are really attri. hutes or bodies of the Supreme Being.

As stated in the following ślokas: "In alla vajnas, it is I that am worshipped and it is also I myself that rewards (those who perforın ther) with the fruits thereof," "It is Thou" alone that assumest the forms of the Pitris add the gods and receivest the offerings (kavis) (uade to the gods) and the offerings (kavya) made to the Manes in sriddhas" and "Those who\* propitiate the Pitris, the guis, the Brahmios and Agai--they propitiate only Viṣṇu who is the inner self of all things"-as stated in these ślokas, it is only the Supreme Being, who is the inner sell of all, that is the object of duration to the wise man. Therefore to the man who performs kainkarya or service according to the süstras with this knowledge, there is no association with other upuyus; there 19 10 4ssociation for him with other objects or purposes in acquiring the necessary substances for worship and in eatiog the food offered (to th?se gods). Similarly there is no association for him with other deities whon, obeying the injunctious (contained in the s'astrasi, he worships the Supreme Being having, for His attributes, sentient beings and non-sentient things. It has been said, “ He who worships as the Supreme Being any deity other thun Narayan't who dwells in his heart, who controls him and is his Lord and Master--he is usinner," " Je wlio considersøe Narāyaṇa as being (only) equal to other deities ---- he will stay in hell as long as the sun and the moon last”, and “One should oota" go near the places where Buddha, Rudra and the like are wor sinpped and so also near the cremation ground, near a corpse, near & forest and acar the capital city of a kingdom." As stated in thesa s lokas), it would be an sin for a paramaikantin if other deities are looked upon by him as the Supreme Being, if they are considered equad (to Narāyaṇa) and if he goes to places where other deities are worshipped, when these deities have nothing to do with his witya and naimiltika rites and observances.

the inner self of all and who is the object of adoration in these sites and observances (nitya and naimittika), there is no thought in the mind of the man (with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord) of these deities being the Supreme Self, of their being equal to Bhagavan, of their being independent of the Lord, of their being objects of adoration or of their being the dispensers of the fruits of actions. Therefore in the same way as by Prana, Vaisviinara, and the three worlds which are the attributes of the Supreme Being in the Vidyas or meditations called Vaisvünara vidya and the like. he is not affected, so also his exclusive devotion to the Lord is not (in the least) affected by such attributes as Agni (which are associated with these rites and observances, nitya and naimittika). 

While proceeding to state the adoration of Bhagavan to be performed by the prapanna in the day and the night, Vangipuram Naubi has described the dharınas of the castes and the asramas with their respective mantras (in the following passages) :-" (The prapanna) should spend his time by performing duly all the rites ordained for the time of the sandhyā, after sipping the water (üchamana) with the prescribed mantras; after this he should perform the homa to the sacrificial fires during the Agnihotra rites with the prescribed mantras and with sainit (fnel), ghee and other ench substances. He should do every karma at the time prescribed for them in the sāsiras". Then he says: "He should "perform, without being lazy, all the rites from the bath to Brahma yajna prescribed in the Vedas for his iisrama as fit to be done at doon", He continues : "Then he should perform the prescribed Vajna to the gods and to the pitris (Mines), after which he should eat the food offered to Bhagavan (which act is called anuyāga)". Bhattar and Kooratbalvan, too, in their respective nityas, have stated as follows:-- " With the vertical mark (Urdhivapuura) on his forehead, (he) should perform the rites ordained in the srutis, and

Smr̥tis as far as it lies in his power, with the thought that they form the adoration of the Supreme Being and then offer oblations of water (tarpanam)". Peria Jeer (Nanjeer) begins by performing obeisance with the words: "I seek the feet of Parāśara Bhuttarya". By this be reininds us of the special tradition concerning the homage to be paid to gurus and the like. After this, he says “I will now describe the manner in which service should be rendered to the lotus feet of Bhagavan every day by men with exclusive devotion to him (Ekuiltins)”. He then says " (The Ekāntin) should sprinkle water on himself by uttering the mantra beginning with Āpohi and then sip water (achamana) with the utterance of the intrus which denote Bhagavaa; after this he should offer arghya to the Supreine Being who is in the sphere of the sun and then perform japa, meditating on Bhagavan with the niantra of Gāyatri. After the japa, he should offer praise to Purushottama. Oblations of water (tarpana) should then be made to the gods, the rishis and the piiris (Manes, who have Narayaon as their inner self." We see also that, in all families which follow the tradition of the anthor of Sri Bhashya, until the present day, weidings and upanayanas (initiation with the sacred thread) have been perforined in accordance with their respective (Grilyu) stītrus, (Apastaiba and the like) with the respective mantras denoting the respective deities. It is also well-known to all that the great vichiryas like Peria Nainbi performed yojnas (sacrifices) and the like in accordance with their respective sītras. Therefore in the case of those who follow the teaching of the author of Sri Bhishya, his disciples and their disciples, it is not proper to perforin any rites (like those of weddings) with the mantras in certain sumhitās\* following the doctrines of the Āgamas (Pūñcariitra) which are prescribed specially (to those who follow theur). 

(\*NOTE: Satvatam : Padmam: Jayakhyam, etc. these are the agama samhitas.) 

We have already shown in Sri pañcarātrarakṣii (The Defence of pañcaratra) that the pañcaratra is of four kinds or 

492 CHAPTER 

systenus (Igama Siddhiinta, Mantra Siddharta, Tantra Sid. dhinta and Tantrāntara Siddhānta) in accordance with the con petency and the like (ability) of the person concerned, that the principle holds good that what is not stated in any one of them should be taken from the others, provided there is no conflict or opposition and that, in all the four kinds or systems of pañca riitru, the direct means or upiya of attaining mokṣa is set forth and that by every one of them. there is the attainment of mokslu, juist in the same way as to all the four sisramus there are Brahmat Vidyais (bhakti and prapatti) and that to every one of them there is the possibility of attaining mokṣa. It has also been stated there, at considerable length, that if a person were to perform all karmas or rites with any mantras of his own liking, ignoring what is enjoined in those sustras as the proper tning for each kind or system, he should perform expiatory rites (prāyaschitta) and the like. Therefore until the time of attaining mukti, there is no authority for rendering service or kainkarya (to the Lord) in any maoner other than what is ordained in the stāstrus as appropriate for each adhikūrī. 

Hence since even the prupanna is subject to the authority of the süstrus and shonld perform only such service as is perunitted or enjoined by them, the following (heretical) views which are opposed to the scriptures and the traditional observances (of the good) supported by right reason or logic are not to be accepled by those who desire to stand in sattuuni. (views such as the following): (1) Both those commands that are enjoined as positive rites or actions and those that forbid curtain activities should be violated ; (2) Both those activities and rites that are enjoined and those that are forbidden should be given up. (3) The rites and observances of the varius and visramus are dependent only on the bodies (of Brahmins and the like) and may therefore be given up by the person who has attained a true knowledge of the essential nature of his self (which is different from the body ). (4) They may be performed or may not be performed (5) Even if they are given up, no harm will result except the loss of the Lord's pleasure

(6) The only harn that would result in their being given up is the ill.will of society and other such (erroneous) views. 

It is true that, as for those in the asrama of the Sanayasin, to whom certain old rites and observances (of the grihasthüsrama) are forbidden and certain new rites and observances enjoined, (so also) for those who are Bhagavatas, as a consequence of their being snch, certain things are forbidden and certain new things are enjoined. But no karma or rite which has been ordained as com pulsory of performance should (on any account) be given up. For it has been stated :- "The man who does not perform the rites pertaining to the sandhyā is always impure and is unfit for the performance of any (other) rite. Whatever other rite or karma he nay perform, he will not obtain the fruit thereof”. As in the differences in the manner of performing the sandhyit meditation or worship that are found in the sūtras and the ditferent Dharma Süslrus (Mlanu, Apastamba and the like) those differences that are found in the different samhitüs of the Lord's Süstra (Pūrcha. rātra) and also such differences in the sandhyu meditation as are stated in the Itihasas and the Purāṇas -- these differences shonld be observed respectively by those who follow these respective süstras. Conduct like the following which is enjoined in the sāstras and the Ithihasas, Damely, "At the time of the \*\* parvas, one should pray to the deities for protection" and "One should bow in front of places where the gods are worshipped -- (conduct like this) is restricted in the case of the man who is supremely and exclusively devoted to Bhagavan (Paramaikantin) owing to the authority of the süstra (i,e. the only deity or God that he should pay homage to is Bhagavad). Therefore no siistra is violated. 

Such injunctions as the following :-"Thereforest the mantra called Ashtiikṣara should be repeated at the time of the sandhya, by pure-minded devotees of mine always in order to purify their

selves", and "uttering the Dvaya always in this spanner with its meaping at heart" in the gadya - these instructions should be carried out without any conflict with the performance of the rites (sritya and naimittika) which are compulsory of performance and at such times as are left over after their performance, Naradi and others have also stated:-“The japa (namely, the repetition of Ashtīkṣara) sbould be performed at such times as do not conflict with the performance of rites ordained in the sritis and the Smr̥tis." Vangipuram Nambi, too, has said: -" Having spent your time in performing the homa in rites like Agnihotra etc" Even in his last days, the author of Sri Bhishya stood up with great difficulty and offered the anjali of water at the time of sandhsya. Therefore giving up the rites of the varias and the asramas on the pretext that they are dependent on the upadhi of the body is opposed to such things as the traditional observances of the ancients. If this pretext were sound, since even such special forms of service (in temples) as the weaving of garlands and the lighting of lamps capaot be performed without the upüdhi (or conditioning factor) of the body, the senses and the like-even these would have to be given up (by the man who has realised bis essential nature (svarīīpa). If the perforınance of such services is desired, the external purity (üchüra) and the purificatory rites (samskürus) which qualify (a person) for such service, cannot be given up.

To retlect on such things as the caste of devotees merely for the purpose of treating them with disregard will bring ruin; but if it is donc only for understanding the restrictions enjoined in the sristras, there is po harm io it anywhere, 

That is the reason why, in the süstras, Dharmavyadha Tnladhara, Sabari, Vidura and others are described only by their respective castes. 

Their conduct, too, as described in the Itihasas, was only in accordance with their castes; if there was\* any exceptional circum stances (in their lives against the rules of their caste), it was due to the exceptional instructions or regulations. The wharmas or rites prescribed for a certain place, a certain period of time, a certain withikari and the like should not be adopted at a different place and a different time or by another adhiküri. 

Some (people) who cannot understand the purport of certain episodes (in the Itihasas and Purāṇas) increase the lila ruser which Bhagavan enjoys in Kaliyuga. " Daughters-in-law should be treated with regard and properly adorned by their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, their husbands and so also by their brothers. in-law who desire to have varied prosperity. Those houses which are cursed by daughters.in-law on account of their ill treatment will fall into ruin as if pulled down by evil spirits". In statenients 

(\*NOTE: Vidura was cremated according to Brahma Medha rites because an aerial voice ordered it.) 

496 CHAPTER 

like the above, the injunction about treating (the daughter-in-law) with regard has, on account of propriety, to be determined with proper restrictions in each case (the mother-in-law's regard is shown differently front that of the husband or the brother-in-law and so on). So also injunctions regarding the respect to be shown to devotees among mlecchas and the like bave to be understood with proper reservations and restrictions. 

These reservations and restrictions are established also by the practice of successive generations of men accepted on all hands as wise and virtuous. Therefore the performance of the Lord's service along with the observance of the regulations enjoined for the respective castes and īsramas is not opposed to the state of supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (parmaikantitva). 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Even the service rendered directly to the Lord of Lakṣmī is surely divided by good men into two classes : valuable and worthless. 

That (service) is declared to be valuable service which is rendered by the nian who has done what he ought to do (ie the prapanna) with no other aim and for no other purpose (i. c. for its own sake) or for the protection of such persons as gurus. 

That (service) is declared to be of no value which is rendered for ostentation (or vanity), for injuring others, for preventing others from rendering service or for the sake of some gain. 

The Lord of all receives, with His fert, the service renderer by those have no supreine and exclusive devotion to Him and that done by those who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Him, with His head. This idea is expressed by Bhagavan Veda Vyasa in the following (passages ):" That which is offered to the gods and the Pitris (Manes) in accordance with the prescribed rules 

33. Mababharata : Santi Parva : 358-63, 64. 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

497 

reaches the feet of the God of gods. The rites performed by wise 114n who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Bhagavan - these Bhagavan receives with His head". 

The rites, mitja and naimittika, which are performed in this way as commandments of the Lord (ājna) and those valuable services which are rendered by a man for the pleasure of the Lord as those approved by Him (anujmui) - these have no connection with praputti and this is declared by the injunction contained in the word parityajya (having given up) (in the charuma śloka ). 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

1. Therefore one should not perform, for the sake of prapatti, those things of which one is capable, nor should one acquire, for the sake of prapatti, the ability or skill needed to accoinplish what one is incapable of. 

According to this interpretation ( of the word parit yajya in the Churuma śloka ), ūkinchanya or being destitute of upiyas which confers competence (udhiküra) for prupatti is suggested by the sentence which states "Do not grieve". If purityujyı, on the other hand, is considered as an anuvāda or expression of what has already occurred (nainely, the person being incapable of any upya), then, the word eka (10e alone) indicates that among those rites which arise from the Lord's command and those which are approved of by him, there is no connection between such of them as are perforined as being within the range of a man's ability and pripatti. In this interpretation, the sentence ma suchah (Do pot grievel mukes clear the qnalification (adhikūru) needed for prapatti which has already been expressed (in parityajya) and indicates also the manner in which the prapanna should conduct himself after the performance of prapatti (i.e.) being free from all vare or apsiety, 

498 CHAPTER 

There are some other ways of interpreting the word (pari tyjya) without treating the injunction regarding 'giving up' as having no authority : 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

2. What is asked to be given up may be stated to be the prevention of the vain effort to perform what one is not capable of or the giving up of such vain effort along with the shame or re worse due to one's inability (to do it in full). 

3 The word tyaga contained in parityajya may also be considered as preventing the continuance of the trivial desire to perforna (these rites) like a drowning man catching at a reed or a hlade of grass. 

4. In the Brahma Sritras, it is declared that any one of the vidyās (thirty two vidyās or forms of meditation described in the Upaniṣads) may be adopted at one's option, as all of them yield the same fruit. By drawing onr attention to it, the injunction for tyaga contained in parityajya may also be to suggest that pra. patti is like the Brahma missile, which proves ineffective if any other upāya is also adopted: 

(To suin up :-) The forms of injunction may be such as follows: 

1. To the man who proceeds to adopt what he is not capable of, it says “Don't". 

2. To the inan who is firri ly determined to do what is not in his power, it says, "Give up this determination ". 

3. If a inau were to adopt one of the payas (other than prapatti) which are left open to the option (of the aspirant to mukti), it says to bin that, by the principle of the Brahma missile, it would conflict with the effectiveness of prapatti. 

29 

MEANING OF PARITYAJYA 

493 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Therefore the meanings of the words sarva dharman pari. tyajya (giving up all dharmas) which are approved of by the wise are as follows: 

(1) incompetence to do those things that are not within one's 

power gives competence for prapatti; and (21 being destitute of all other upiyas is a qualification for 

praputti; 

(3) the dharmas or rites being no accessory or anga to prapatti; 

(4) the prevention of effort in trying to do what is not possible 

for one; 

(5) the giving up of the desire to do what is beyond one's ability; 

(6) the indication of the principle of the Brahia missile. 

The interpretation (which is given by some) that what is asked to be given up is the dharınas or rites associated with other deities (than Bhagavan) is not objectionable, but as this applies to both the man who adopts bhakti or upüsuna and the man who adopts prapatti, this interpretation is inappropriate here (in the context specially relating to the prapania ). 

"The giving "up of upuyas" stated in such passages as the following :-One should give up the upāyas and also the apuyas (those activities that are forbidden )" should also be interpreted in the same way 

(TAMIL VERSE EMBODYING THESE IDEAS :) 

"Do not endeavour to do what is beyond your power though you have begun the attempt; at the outset, it is the part of wisdom to give up the desire to do what lies beyond your ability; the path

of prapatti does not require any aids ; if you desire other aids for it, it will lose its potency like the Brbama missile ; you are not among those who have the full knowledge required to follow the path of bhakti or upūsana, which takes a long time to bear fruit; hence if you seek my feet as your refuge reflecting on your being destitute of other upāyas, I will pardon all your sins": Let us extol the great and good qualities of the holy Sri Kr̥ṣṇa who spoke these words. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORDS MĀM AND AHAJI 

IN THE CHARAMA SLOKA:-- 

As stated in the contexte in the Gita, which describes the secret of ervatāra or incarnation and that in which Sri Kr̥ṣṇa” declares Himself as (Purushottama), the primary aim of the words mām (me) and ahan (I) (in the charama s'loka) is to disclose (Bhagavad's) easy accessibility and His absolute independence (and omnipotence) respectively. 

SANSKRIT SIOKAS: 

He who knows the secret of incarnation to consist in its being real, in the incarnation continuing in its real nature (as Bhagavan) though incarnating in lower forms, in its being constituted of the (transcendental, substance called suddhasatvam in its being cansert only by Bhagavan's own will or desire (and not by karma); in its occurrence at a time when there is decline of dharma and in its being occasioned for the purpose of protecting the good -- (he who knows all this) will never be born again. 

This knowledge of the secret of incardation is required for the bhakta, who has prapatti as an anga, to complete and perfect bis upuya. To the man who has adopted prapatti as the direct and independent means, it reveals the easy accessibility of the omni potent and independeat Lord. The accessibility and ownipotence 

35. Bhagavad Gita : Chap. IV. 

36. Bhagavad Gita: Chap. XY,

501 

which are declared in these two contexts are complementary to each other, 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Even if a person is independent and omnipotent, if he is not accessible, no one will seek him (for protection). Even if a person is sought (for protection) on account of bis easy accessibility, he cannot award the desired fruit if he is dependent on others. 

Towards one who is not independent, there is no possibility of rendering service, as the person rendering service, might think of acting as he pleases; and towards one who is not easily accessible, service might be possible though difficult, but as is seen in the world, it does not confer happiness or pleasure (on the person rendering service), 

The Saviour who is both accessible and supreme is not only merely accessible like a blade of grass but exalted (in status and pature). Though exalted and supreme, he is not inaccessible like Mount Meru, but easily accessible. Therefore He is both capable of being sought (for protection) and capable of being attained. In these two words sīm and aham, the eagerness with which the universal Saviour and Seshi is awaiting an opportunity for protect ing (the jiva ) is disclosed. 

Īśvara who thus waits for an occasion or opportunity as stated in the passage :-- " The Lordexpects a prayer for protection," is ever favourably inclined saying, " When will these (jivus) pray for my help?" This attitude of His is suggested by the word mm (me. The word aham (1) shows His attitude of readiness to copftr. for His own glory, the desired fruit as quickly as possible saying, “ When shall I take back (and wear) (these jīvas) like jewels from which the dirt (prakriti) has been removed," 

Thus the charama siloka indicates by the words nām and ekan (ine alone) the Siddhopüya who does not require anything 

37. Lakṣmī Tantram. 

502 CHAPTER 

else than the surrender of responsibility (bharanyāsa) with the prayer for protection performed according to the injunction. And by tbe words saranam vraja (seek as refuge or upāya) it shows, in the form of an injunction (vidhi) Sadhyopūga (namely, prapatti) which is the ineans of wipping His grace. Since the vidye called prapatti, which is here enjoined, is ordained as it ineans of propitiating the Saviour, it becomes an upayı and re sembles in that respect bhakti yoga. Īśvara who is propitiater thereby is the direct means or upöya for mokṣa. What has to be understood as a distinguishing feature of this vid yii (prupatti) is its being an upāya which does not require (any aid or acces sory). All the attributes vecessory for this purpose are also sigui. fied in the words mām and ekan (me alone). 

By the word inam (me) which denotes the Savionr whose nature is indicated in such ślokas as the following: "This Nara yana \*who has the ocean of milk as His abode has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed of Adhisesha" by this word ( mm) are disclosed His being the Universal Saviour, His being the universal S'eshi, His being the Lord of Sri, Ilis veidy Nara yada (the resting place of Naras) which are revealed in Tiru mantra and Dunya, and so also the qunlities which can be inferred from them, namely, omniscience, omnipotence and the like, and, 30 also, such qualities as Ilis being supremely compassionate, His good nature (sausilya) and His love which are all the niarks of supremacy and accessibility. ('The word miim also discloses ), like the word having the dual termination, vis, charaan (the two feet) in Duijor, the divinely auspicious forw of Partha sārathi which suggests Loth His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility and which is onr auspicious refuge. Here these four squalities of His, namely, His love, I Jis being the Master, His good nature (sansilya) and His accessibility which are stated in such passages is the following :-- "O Thon that hast incoruparable attributes, Thon that ownest the three worlds, Thon that art my

Saviour! Thon that dwellest on Mount Veokatam, which is tagerly longed for by hosts of incomparable gods and rishis!" - these four qualities are revealed when Sri Kr̥ṣṇa did not treat Arjuna's misplaced compassion and affection at the beginning with risregard, when He Himself declared : " There is 20% one bigher than I ", when He served as charioteer to Arjuna who addressed Ilim as “0, Krishoa O Yadava" and said " Drive my chariot and statiun it between the two armies" and when, at Arjupa's request, He revealed to Him His universal form immanent in all things and when later, as soon as he prayed to see His former delightful form as Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, He stood before him once again an his chariotcer. Among the aforesaid qualities of the Saviour, the most importaat attributes that ire essential for the protection of those who seek Him have been briefly set forth in the Bhagavat Sistra: "Though Bhagavans who keeps all under flis control is both omniscient and compassionate, He expects & prayer for pro tection, since He has to conduct the course of the world of san Stira" anil in this stoka of the wise xichirya, “In the face of 'Thy omoiscience, omnipotence and compassion, my sins cannot bu\*ar fruit." Among these three qualities, knowledge and night tre required in common for conferring punishnient and favour. l'he Lord's being the Master serves the purpose both of His cleriving the delight of Lilā from man in sainsira and His deriving enjoyment or bhoga in Vaikuṇṭha from the soul that has obtained mukti, So this attribute of Lordship cannot restraia the Lord's jnünu or knowledge and sakti or might so us to operate only in the work of protection. Compassion and its varieties (literally - branches) good nature, love and the like are solely responsible for the conferment of favours. The ancients who appreciated this distinguishing feature of mercy wrote is follows:--"O Thou "that art the Lord of Brubwa, the god of the gods! I have not the ability to adore I hee or to praise Thee. (Therefore) with com

"I will "oot believe that I could be saved by anything other than Thy compassion," "I look to" Thy compassion alone for salvation," "O Thou that, "in spite of having the glorious Lakṣmī, art so full of compassion as to come and abide permanently in my heart", It is impossible" to protect me except with Thy holy compassion," "I will sweep.\* Thy temple (and render such other service) being the recipient of Thy compassion and the compassion of Thy consort who dwells in the lotus," "Showing" Thy mercy with the exclamation 'Ha! Ha!!", "Show de Bonly Thy compassion so that I, Thy servant, may realise that I have nothing else to attain thao Thee and that I have no other upāya (than Thee ) and so that I nay find delight only in rendering service to Thee." "O Lord of Hastigiri52! Those that are devoted to Thee by their qualities and actions with the knowledge of Thee -- it is Thy compassion which has made ther devoted to thee. I consider thać only that compassion is a source of strength to me who am destitute of upūgus." In these Ways, these ancients looked lipon (the Lord's) compassion by their refuge and considered the relationship of the s'eshy to the sesha and other qualities (of the Lord) as the obedient servants of compassion and became solely dependent on the Lord's mercy, Sita devi also said, in spite of the existence of other qualities: "kama", the descendant of Kakustha, extended his protection to him (Kakasura, out of compassion, though be deserved the punisb ment of being killed”.

wise and have a vision of me etc.," the primary importance of (the Lord's) compassion is indicated. Haciog (Arjuoa) with this primary quality so essential for protection and other attributes which are ancillary to it, Sri Kr̥ṣṇa referred to Himself as him (ine). 

THE MEANING OF EKAM IN THE CHARAMA SLOKA: 

(1: While the siogular form māin (ine) itself indicates the idea of alone' (ekum), the further use of the word ekan is, according to some, to disclose that He who is the object of attain. ineat is Hivuself the means or upāya for that attainment like the (celestial) kalpuku tree giving itself (to those that ask). Thus (these commentators) suggest that the use of eka after min is to suggest the identity of the object of attainment and the means of attaining it. This interpretation finds support in the sentence mim ekam cv«r® in a similar context :- " By all\* means, seek the protection only of me alone who am the inner self of all beings, You will then have no fear of any kind." Since the word eva (only) is already present, it is but proper to seek some other piir puse for the existence or use of the word ekam in addition to only. (This purpose is the declaration of the oneness of the means and the end). 

(2) As against this, others say that the word ekam which has the following nieanings: 'chief', 'something other than', and 

there is no other than this', is, in this sentence, a mere synonym of 'no other' and means 'only' or 'alone' as in the ślokas, “Those who seek me alone (and no other) as their refuge will surmount the insurmountable müyā" and "Seek the protectiou of Him alone (and no other)". In this way they mention that by emphasising the fullness of the qualities of the Saviour, one is made to understand that one cannot adopt an upāya by one's owa independence. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:-"As 

54. Bhagavatam: 11 - 12 - 14. 55. Bhagavad Gita: 7-14 

506 CHAPTER 

the man adopts, for his owo protection, the means ordained for Him by the sāstras for propitiating the Lord), it is just possible that he might think of himself also as doing something for his pro tection on an equal footing with the Saviour who is the Siddho püya. Taking into account this possibility, the word eka denies that there is any upāya other than the Lord to make the upāyas two. If it be asked how this denial is made, the answer is as follows: It is true that the jiva is the doer according to the pramāṇas, for it is stated: - "He is the doer; otherwise the sāstras could have no meaning or purpose". Still this doership of the jiva is depen dept on the Supreme Being and is very limited (in its scope) besides being subject to bindrances. Therefore though he adopts the upuya, it is only on account of the Lord's grace as stated in the śloka :-- " Without Thy\* compassion, 0 Varada, even the prayer that Tbou shouldst be my itpüya would not arise from me." When the Lord withholds His help and stimulation, the jiva cao. not even stretch out his limbs or bend them. Therefore he prac tises the upāya revealed by the Lord, with the help of the body and the senses given by Him and with His help and looks up to Him like the chūtaka bird for the desired fruit to be given by Him. So it is improper for the intelligent aspirant to mukti to consider himself, as another siddhopāya equal to the Lord, who is absolute ly independent of others and whose activities extend everywhere and can meet with no biadcances or obstacles. This is, according to these commentators, the purport of the word eka. (only He and no other). (3) Followicg this line of reasoning, they say also that the word eka (one) is used to prevent the consideration of prapatti which is sadhyopaya as being equal to Siddhopüya. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- Although like bhakti. yoga, prapatii too, has been enjoined as an endeavour to propiti. ate (the Lord), yet its purpose is merely to allay the displeasure of the Supreme Ruler who has innate compassion and other such qualities. For the direct attainment of the desired fruit, it is only

the will of the Lord who has, by His very nature, the ability and the compassion (necessary for protecting the jīva) - it is only His will that is the cause. He accepts the responsibility for pro tecting the prapunna who is absolutely destitue of upāyas and Himself stands in the place of such more difficult upāyas as bhakti yoga. He expects only the vyāja (pretext or gesture ) of pra. patti accompanied by such things as the will to do what is pleasing to Him. This nyāsa vidyż does not require any ancillary rite or accessory and has this as its distinguishing feature. Therefore in this vidya, He is the only upāya to be prayed for as stated in the following passages: "Sarañagatik consists in the thought "I pray that Thou alone shonldst be wy upāya"; "I made Him the sosubject of the thought that the Lord should be my upāya. Even this became possible only by virtue of His compassion." "O Lorde that mad'st me consent and placed me beneath Thy feet I" As stated in these passages, to piace the mere vyāja or pretext vis. prapatti, which too was inspired only by Him acting as the upāya to place it on an equal footing with Him is not proper. This is the purport of the word eka (only · Do other). 

Taking into consideration the fact 'thnt sādhyopāya is a inere pretext or gesture (vyāja) in relation to Siddhopaya and is with. out any importance, sone (writers) exaggerated its insignificance by statiog that prapatti consists merely in (1) the knowledge of the relation of the sesha to the s'eshī (2) the mere knowledge that the Lord is the Siddhopaya, (3) nonresistance (to His grace) (4) mere acceptance or receptivity (5) the attitude of being different from acit or non-sentient matter (6) the activity of the septient being and (7) serenity of mind (8) an attribute of the adhikari. Ironi these (exaggerated statements) it is not proper to conclude that any of them is the real meaning of prapatti, for the pu port (of these exaggerations) is quite different. All these interpretations are opposed to the positive injunction contained in sarana vraja

(seek me as Thy Saviour). They would also lead to too wide an application (atiprasanga). We will explain how:- (1) & (2) If praptti were to consist only in the knowledge of the relationship of the s'esha to the s'eshin or in the knowledge that the Lord is Siddhopüya, then since this knowledge wonld of itself arise from the sentence or text (stating it), there would be no need to state it in the form of an injunction (ordaining 'know this "). If it be said that mokṣa might result from mere knowledge and without doing the thing enjoined in a vidhi or injunction, it would, as ex plained in Sri Bhishya and elsewhere (Vedūrthasaṅgrahu), be opposed to the spirit of) the injunctions directing one to upāsanas; if it be held that the man who has a knowledge of the truth should thereby acqnire a different kind of knowledge called prapatti, then the essential pature (svarīpa) of this knowledge should be under stood in accordance with the texts or passages ordaining the dharine (s'aranam vraja), those that describe or deline its characteristics fthat it can yield fruits not attainable otherwise etc.) and those that prescribe the mapper of adopting it (anush tana) (the utterance of the Duaya and the like). If the statement that prapatti consists only in the acceptance of Siddhopūra were true, it would mean that the man should first know Sidu hopeira and then perform the action called 'surrender of responsibility (bharanyosa) for which he is competent and that this surrender should be preceded by the prayer enjoined in the vidhis or injunc tions, (3) If prapatti were to consist in nere non-resistance (to the Lord's grace), it would mean (a) that it was possible for him to resist Īśvara owing to sperior strength. This would imply that Īśvara is not omnipotent or (b) If resistance means resist. ing the Lord's grace by con, 'nitting an offence and inenrring punishment, it would follow that prapaiti is only a nieans of pr. pitiation (c) If resistance means resisting in means of one's own activity to protect oneself, then since there is no such resistance of the nature of activity in such states as pralaya and sushupti (dreamless sleep) and so also in the waking stake when the man is capable of action but does not act, Īśvara would have to 

MEANING OF EKAM 

509 

award mokslia to him. (4) If prapatti were to consist in mere acceptance, it would then stand on the same footing as upisana. There would be no difference between the bhakta and the prapanna. (5) If prapatti were to consist merely in being different from non-sentient things, it would be present even when the man acts against the will of God. This, certainly, could not be the cause of being saved or protected. (6) If prapatti were to consist in the mere activity of the sentient being, not only upisanas but other activities of the sentient being (like eating, breathing, etc.,) would lie the cause of salvation. There would then be no difference between prapatti and all these activities. If it be said that prapatti is what happens to a man of its own accord, there would then be no need for instructions (upades') concerning it. (7) If it be said that prapatti meaos serenity of mind without the purpose of obtaining any frnit, then it would vary with different individuals in accordance with their respective tastes. (8) If prapatti were a mere attribute of the adhikiri (and not something to be done), the word vrajı would be improper, for it lays down soniething to be done and there is no reference to any fruit or the desire for it (and the like). So it would not be proper to call prupulti an attribute of the adhikari.\* If it were possible to condemn (the performance of) prapatti in these ways, althongh it is enjoined as something to be performed, it would be equally possible to condemn also upasanas and the like in the same mander In that case, the attempt to distinguish prapatti from upāsanas and the like (which was the reason for the argunent) would fail. If it be said that though this Siddhopāya (Īśvara ) has accepted the responsibility of protecting one and is bent op granting the (desired) frnit, yet the man should consider that this acceptance is unnecessary, prapatti would then be a case of meditating on wbat is not true (drishti vidhi) (and it would not lead to mokṣa ). 

NOTE\*: “He who desires svarga should perform Jyotishtona". In this sentence, the adhikari is seen to be one who desires a certain fruit, namely Svarga. 

510 CA APTEN 

If it means the thought that the acceptance by Īśvara, too, is annecessary, it would be opposed to the idea contained in the words of the Lord saranam vraja (seek me as the Saviour). 

(NOTE\*_Drishti vidhi eg. "Imagine the mind to be Brahman and meditatc on it". This kind of meditation would not lead to mokṣa.) 

Therefore Īśvara is the object of propitiation and He is the Siddhopūya and is of great importance. Both bhakti and prapalit are ways of propitiation and are sadhyopāyas which are not so important. The aspirant to mukti) should be firmly established in either of these two, according to his competence. 

(4) It has also been stated by some (āchiiryas) that the word eka is employed to indicate how the Saviour, who has accepted the responsibility, stands alone, requiring nothing else after the per formance of prapatti, so that there need be no adoption of any of the means (like upisana) prescribed for the attainment of the desired fruit. This may he explained as follows :--- If a person has performed prapatti as an ange and then adopts also upusanus and the like as angī, the Saviour becomes the upüya for the fruit desired. In the case of the man who adopts prapatti as a direct and independent inerny, being destitute of the other pros and impatient of delny, the game Īśvara takes, upon This own qualities, the borden that lies between prapatli and Himself. As stated in the tollowing passages :- " l'hose who6 are incapable of bhaktı yoga and seek Thee as u püya they, too, pass beyond sansürat and reach Thy abode, Varkuuta", and "Thou hasta Thyself given Thy feet as the fruit of my attaioment and as the upüga for attaining it" - as stated here, the Lord limself, who is endowed with the qualities essential for it, stands as the Dispenser of the fruit desired, without requiring any ancillary rite or dharma. Therefore what is stated in the charama.śloka comes to this :- " Bear this in mind and seek Me alone for your salvation". (5) It is said by some that the word cka is used here for the porpose of making it

clear that, when prapatti is performed to Him who is perfect in every way, nothing else is required except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore the Lord teaches that one should not introduce, into this, ancillary rites such as are requireri for the vidyās, under the impression that they, too, form upāyas for propitiating Him. The Lord's purport (in the śloka) is as follows --" Prapatti does not require any aids such as are per formed either because they are my commands or because their performance is approved of by me. When I become gracious owing to the performance of prapatti, I am bent on granting the desired fruit and stand as the one and only surety for this upāyu which is capable of being performed in an instant. In regard to the fruit of this prapatti, nothing else need be performed. I do not require any such aid in regard to my determination to save Thee". This announts to saying that, with the exception of such things as the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord), no oiber auxiliury causes should be added on in the name of ancillaries to proputti. 

As stated (in the Saranagati Ga:lya " Thou that utterest the Duaya in some manner or other" and in Varadarīja stava. “By the mere words which state prapatti, I long to see l'hee - Thee that canst not be attained by bhakti", even though a man has not the clear understanding necessary for the full and perfect performance of prapatti, this upya will be effective even if it be adopted in a less satisfactory manner. Therefore there is certainly no need to seek ancillary rites or dharmas for this upāya. 

(It is true that) (in the Rāmayana) it is stated :- " Thea Rāma," the slayer of his enemies, spread kus'a grass on the beach, had uis arm shining like the body of & serpent for his pillow, folded his hands in anjali and lay down facing the east and expecting the arrival of the god of the ocean" and, likewise, in the story of Brahmadatta in the episode of Saptavyadha, “The kingit vas in great danger and sought with devotion Narāyaṇa, the chief of the 94.

gods, the Saviour and the Ruler over all, as his upāya with concentra tion of mind and fasting for six nights. The renowned king saw in his contemplation (dliyana) the Lord Narāyaṇa" But these ipcillary rites that are described in the Rimiyunu and Hari. wamsa) are not necessary for prapatti. In these two places, what is of importance is the ritual of sitting with the intention of star ving onto death and therefore the ancillary actions described there are proper. The same explanation holds good in the case of Hamaskara well performed. (There is no prapalti in all these cases). But in prapatti, no other requisites are needed except such is the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord - such as are stated in the chapters on Prapatti. We do not find any ancillary rites except such requisites, at the time, as the will to do what is pleasing. in the following instances of those who performed prapatti with only their being destitute of all updyjcs for their sole wealth. (a) Droupadi, (b) Damayanti, (c) Rakṣasis, (d) Vibbishana, (e) Kshatrabandbu, (f) Muchukunda, (g) Gajendra, (h) the l'apdavas, (i) the gods, (j) Sumukha. (k) Trisankn, (1) Sanasrhepa, (m) Kirata, (n) kaka, (o) Kapota and the like We find that, by the instantaneous performance of mere prapatti without any other requisites, the desired fruit was obtaine:) by kuch of these that sought protection in the same manner, even in prupatti performed for the sake of mokṣa, there is nothing to prevent the attainment of the fruit at the desired time. This is the purport also of the words mü s'uchah (Do not grieve). 

If parilyajya is interpreteri to inean that there is nothing else required for propulli, this interpretation of the word oka inay be considered as confirming or en nhasizing this. (It need not there. fore be looked upon as redundant). Or the word ekı may be considered to have another ineaning, bamely, the idea of the upāya

and the upeya being the same. If the word eka is considered as stating that prupatti does not require anything else, then the word parityajya inay be considered as having the other meanings stated before. 

If it be asked why the word eka should be used as an adjective of the Saviour, when (properly speaking), it should quality prapatti (80 that it might mean that prapatti alone is necessary withont any ancillary dharmas), the answer is as follows: The words, miim ekan (me alone) are employed to show that, in the case of the man destitute of other upāyas, these ancillary dharmus other than prapatti are in no way connected with the Saviour as the means of propitiating Him. (6) It is also stated by some (comentators) that, as in the first half of the śloka we find the words sarva dharniin (all dharmas) and in the second half the word sarva pāpobhyo (from all sins), the word eka stands here as the counter-part or counter-poise to the world all. If this be admitted, then the gist of the charma śloka would be: 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

If a man is in despair because of his inability to adopt such means or upāyas as will yield the respective fruits desired by hin, then, I myself (single as I anı) will stand for him as the respective means or upāya to enable him to secure that fruit." 

This statement may be explained as follows: "Whatever be the object that a man, whoever be may be, wishes to attain and whatever be the meaos or upāyas by which he cannot attain them and likewise, the attainment of mokṣa desired by the aspirant, which cannot be attained by karma yoga, jnisa yoga and bhakti yoga, all these fruits, can, O great sage, be attained by propatti. The place desired by the aspiraat to mukti is that supreme abode from which the man who reaches it never returos". As declared (in the passage cited above), when a man falls into grief because he cannot obtain any one of the fruits desired by him either because

CHAPTER 

of ignorance of the means prescribed in the śāstras for acquiring the respective fruit, or because even wbile possessing that know ledge, he is unable to adopt the prescribed ineans, or because, while possessing both (the knowledge and the ability), be is too impatient to wait until the time when the fruit will be attained thereby - (when a man falls into grief in this way) the Charma-śloka declares to him, “ You need not go about in search of these means. I will myself be the only and sole upöya for your attainment of all these fruits, provided I am propitiated by the performanc: of prupatti. The Charma Sloka says, as it were :- " This single and sovereign pedicine will give you all the health which a larger pumber of other medicines may confer on you. It is enough, if, instead of falling into despair, you take this single medicine. This will cure all the ailments that can be cured by other medicines. After taking this medicine, you can enjoy all pleasures. Therefore you need not fall into despair thinking that you have lost your health and the pleasures." This is, as it were, the meaning of the Churama-slok«. 

Though the word eka stands as the counter-part of the word sarva (all) and qualifies the Savionr as He is post importani. being the Sidhopüya, yet it is tantamount to stating that prupalli alone is enjoined as the single dharma in the place of all other dharmus, as in the phrase " by nyasa alone" From this it follows that even those who desire the three eods (other than mokṣu (viz). (dharma, arth and kisma) my perform pruputti to Bhagavan for securing them. So it is not proper to have any contact with other deities except as they fignre as attributes to the Lord in the performance of the nitya and imittika rites, as stated in such ślokas as the following:-"I am propitiating Hiin from whom, O lodra, yon have obtained your position of lordship. I will not adore you. Here is my anjali to you. You may strike me with your thunderbolt or abstain from doing so. I will never adore any one but Govinda."

Even those who seek other upāyas for attaining mokṣa (like bhakti yoga) may perform prapatti in order to get rid of the hindrances in the way (of those upāyas). Prapatti is suitable in the case also of those who want to get rid of obstacles to the attain. inent (of Bhagavan ) vix, sias and this is declared bere (in the charama-śloka) to show that it is capable of securing any fruit that may be desired (by one). The idea that prapatti will destroy the obstacles to the upāyas for attainment (namely, sins) is conveyed (by Sri Rāmanuja) in bis Gitū Bhashya in his second interpretation of the śloka). In the Gadya, he has declared that prapatti will help to get rid of the hindraaces to the attainment of Bhagavan It does not mean that, in those two places, Sri kimagujr expresses one of these two ideas in disregard of the other. Both passages illustrate the potency of this upery (pru. patti) which cın secure all desired ends. The pranavan (aum) enters into the body of another inantra, viz. namo Nariyaṇāya as il part thereof and yet is itself an independent mantra, So also this prapatti forms an uniga to bhakti in the case of others. This is evident from the anthority of the texts. That bhakti and prapatti stand as alternative upriyas determined by the comu petence of the persons concerned is evident from such passages as the following: "I am capable of being attained 0, Thou of great wisdom, either by deep bhakti or by prapatti on the part of those who desire to render service to me, I cannot be attained by any other means ". 

(There is a well-known śloka which says):- "A man attains mokṣa either by right knowledge, or by death in the waters of the Ganga or hy namuskura well-performed or by bhakti". In such pussiges th:ize that are direct means of attaining mukti are stated along with others that are not direct but only auxiliary. This is only a way of exaggerating the importance of these indirect weaps.

CONCLUSION IN REGARD TO THE MEANING OF 

THE WORD EKA 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Six meanings have (thus) been pointed out by ācāryas for the word eka. They are (1) the identity of the object of attain ment (Bhagavad) and the means or upāya for that attainment (2) the denial of one's own importance (i. e. of the jiva's works); (3) prapatti being only a mere pretext or gesture (vyāja). (4) the absence of any relation or connection between prapatti and other upāyas; (5) and likewise, the absence of any relation or connection hetween prapatti and the angas or ancillary dharmas (karma yoga, etc.) of other upāyas (like bhakti) and (6) prapatti as a single means of securing all desired ends without any distinction whatsoever. 

THE SAVIOUR IS BHAGAVAN WITH SRI AS HIS 

ATTRIBUTE: There are some commentators who state that the meaning of the word eku (a single ope) declares that the Saviour is only one (namely, Bhagavan) and that Sri has nothing to do with salvation). But their contention does not stand to reason. Just as qualities and forins qualify the Lord as His attributes, so also Sri is an attribute of His (inseparable from Him). She is the ruler over all beings' and is dear to Bbagavan and is declared in the srutis as sharing in His duties and as ever bent on protecting those that seek her help. Though it is stated (in the Chaindogya Upaniṣad and otber Vedic texts) that the material cause of the Universe is only one (sat), yet other things that are requisite as material causes are understood its existing as His attributes (viz. cit and acit in their subtle and unmanifested forms) on the authority of the pramāṇas. So also in this context, Sri shunld be understood, although not distinctly stated. Even when a single form of upāsana or meditation is enjoined, the qualities that are connected with the object of meditation enter also into it. Similarly though a single deity is enjoined as the Saviour to be sought, Sri,

who is IIis attribute, should also be considered as being associated with Elim (in the act of salvation | The Siddhopaya (namely, Bhagavan ) is (of conrse) single bat His qualities remain with Hiin though not explicitly stated). In the suns way, in the opinion of those who see with the eye of the Sāstra, Trakṣmi (His sponse) is associated iosepir ibly with Hi'n an attribuite, Tight and the object enitting light (tre insepurable fron euch other) and when one is minti nell, the other is also presint bv 1390ciation Tike. wise whea either (Bhgavin or Sril is mentioned, the other is also present by virtue of their being always with each other.

There fore, on the anthority of many Vedic texts and Sytritis which cannot le stated to have some other purport, the siogle one who is to be sought as the Savionr is the Lord with His attribute Sri who is His consort. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD SARANAM IN THE 

CHARAMA-SLOKA: 

The meanings that have (already) been given to the word s'aranani occurring in Duayan (on p. ) should be borne in mind in regard to the word saraqan employed here in the charuma-śloka. This prayer for refuge or upüya (saranam though taught to Arjuna, should be considered applicable to all ind this is evident from the\* Svetāsvatara Upaniṣad and from Sri Rāmanaja's words in the (Saraṇāgati) Gadya: "O Thou that art the Saviour of all beings in the world ignoring the differ

ences that may exist aipong those that seek Thee". Similarly in such passages as the following :- “Those Brahmioses who know the first part of the Veda and those people who understand the meaning of its latter part declare that the Supreme Being, Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, is the ever-existing dharmu or upāya ", " The greatío and emiosat Rishis say that Thou art the refuge and the Saviour of those that have sought Thy protection". "He is the "Yoga (upüya) and the one who leads those who know bhakti yoga to their goal". and "Bhagavan 71Awhom the wise call the eternal means (upüya) and the goal of attainment" -- (in such passages ) also, since there is no limitation of ineaning, it has to be understood that the Saviour is for all. The only reqarsite for seeking Hun as the Saviour or Refuge is that the person should be destitute of any other refuge or protector. 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD VRAJA: 

The word vraju also, like the word prapadye (in Dva ya ) enjoins self-sgrrender with all its auxiliaries. In the word (prapadye in Dunya), the first person is used, because it is the thought or neditation in the mind of the inun who perforins prapatti. Here (in the charamaśloka) it is ia the second person, since the injunction is addressed to the man (Arjuna) who stands opposite to the Lord (i.c.) Sri Kr̥ṣṇa) saying: "I am" Thy disciple and (it is only fitting that) Thou shouldst order me to do what is right". Auxiliaries like the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord are also indicated here and may be found suggested in \*suitable words as in Dvaya, There is a ( well-known) principle which states: “When an action is enjoined in the sastra, a single performance of it satisfies the requirements of the süstra".

upāsana bowever, is an exception to tbis general rule because it requires frequent repetition. But prapatti is no such exception (and hence a single performance will quite do ). This stateinent is confirmed also by such words as the following: -"To the man who performs prapatti only once and says "I exist for Thee " - to that inap I grant freedom fron fear from all beings. This is my vow". To the man who performs bharanyāsa (the surrender of responsibility) to the generous and omnipotent (Lord), there is no reason for delay in the attainment except his own desire. Therefore in the case of this nyasa vidyā, the peculiarity is that it arrests even the consequences of past karna which have already begun to operate (priirabdha karma). 

In this connection some (commentators) ask "An action maybe enjoined for perforinance only by a man who has freedom of will and action, How can an action be enjoined (in the word craja) for performance by one who has been taught as being absolutely dependent (on the Lord) in the Vedānta and other sāstrus treating of the self and in such as the moolt niantra? This (question) is the result of an inadequate runderstanding of what is meant by complete dependence on another the Lord). As deter 

other wise the śāstras which enjoin dharmas would have no purpose or meaning", and " The doership (of the jiva) is depen. dent on the Supreme Self, for the sruti says so". Since the jiva is an agent or doer subject to the will of Bhagavan, there is notbiog to prevent an injunction asking him to do something. 

Just as nonsentient things (acit) like ether and fire bear the attributes respectively of sound and heat created by Īśvara, the jiva', absolute dependence on Īśvara consists in bearing this burden of free will (and responsibility) (granted to him by Īśvara). If it be maintained that he has no responsibility at all as a doer or agent, it would be like the beresies (siddhānta) which attribute

520 CHAPTER 

doership (respectively) to prakriti and avidya (Sankhya and Advaita). If (on the other hand) it be maintained that the jiva's doership is dependent only on bilmself (and on nobody else), then since it would resemble the heresy which does not admit the existence of one who is in supreme control of all selves, it would be # form of atheisid, If it is held that the doersbiy which comes from the will of the Lord is merely the state of being the knower, there would be no such thing a9 a desire for the ends of life (purushārtha) and the eodeavour to attain them. It it be held that apart from the knowledge and the particular form of knowledge called desire, there is no such thing as effort (or mental activity), it would be impossible to adopt any means for securing objects that are tangible or intangible and for rendering service for its own enke. Therefore it has to be admitted that the self has these three (attributes):«-knowledge, desire, and effort (knowing, feeling and willing). Among these (three), desire and effort are only different niodifications or states of knowledge and this may be upderstood from the principle of logical economy \*adopted by Sri Ranvapuja in his Vedārthasaṅgrahu. 

l'he doership or ayuntship which consists in being the sent (israya) of an action (or the place where an action takes place) is a common attribute of both sentient beings and non seotient things (for the latter also move about and undergo changes). But the sert (usraya) of an effort or endeavour (prayatna) is (an attribute) peculiar to septicot beings. Effort or endeavone (prayatna) is a form of knowledge or will that is the cause of sti mulating one to exercise the body (the senses and the like). When one is the seat of mere knowledge and of were enjoyibent (bhogar), there is only the doership which consists in being the seat of such action as is common to sentient beings and non-sentient things.

called 

Olt whina'y the 

When & person is stimulated by his will to act in & particular manner, he becomes the seat of endeavour or effort (prayatna) and is a doer of that particular form. It cannot justly be maio tained that this form of doership is found only in rendering kain. karya or service. Even in this case, the man must have adopted an upāya with a view to attaining the end called the love of the Lord. If all this is admitted, it is only the doership that takes the form of ao endeavour or effort which would lead to bondage - it is only this form of doership that should be avoided. If it be asked what that form of doership is, the answer is as follows:- Īśvara has given the jiva such qualities as knowledge and ability and also such things as the senses and the body. He supports the jiva and stimulates him (to action). He enjoys also the fruit of (that) action. When He is thus renderiog help (to the jīva), if the latter should consider himself as being ditferent froin this and if, even when be considers his position in the right spirit, he adopts an upiya for some (worldly) pnrpose - the endeavonr would lead to bondage. Even bhakli and propalli would certainly lead to bondnge in the case of the man who perfornus them for securing other ends (than mokṣa). Therefore just like the doership in the state of attain. ment (multi) of the man who longs for rendering service to the Lord by virtue of his very nature and with no other purpose, the doership in the state when he adopts an upāya (for the sake of mukti and service) is not improper. The doersbip of varied forms of service (to the Lord) in the state of attainment (i. e. mukti) results from the selfs owo longing (to render service) combined with the varied desires of the Lord (which have no connection with kurma). The doership in the state of saṁsāra is of different kiods corresponding to the conditioning factor (upādhi) in the forms of sattvani, rajas and tamas which have been evolved in accordance with the past karma and by the will of Īśvara. That doership which results from rajas and tamas and 80 also from that sattva which is the cause of attachment to other interests (than mokṣa) - that doership leads to bondage. That doersbip (on the other hand) which results from the form of 

522 (HAPTER 

superior sattvam which creates a longing for he attainment of Bhagavan -- that doership leads to mokṣa. In the state of mukti, the doersbip will bave no connection at all with any of these three qualities. 

Therefore between the tests which state that the self is not a doer and the texts which state that the self is a doer, there is no conflict, since it is possible to discriminate wherein it hils doership and wherein it has no doership. If it be az ked how this conld be understood, the answer is as follows:- The texts which declare that the self is not a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that the doership of the self which is dependent on Īśvara and on the qualities of prakriti (sattva, rajas and tamas) should not be considered as independent of other (forons). The texts which declare that the self is a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that, of the jnina or knowledge and its particular forms called desire to perforin and effort' which have come to him in accordance with such things as the desire of Īśvara, the jiva is hitnself the seat or āsraru. This conclusion has been taught clearly by the Gutachuiryu Himself in the slokes beginning with the following --" It is ascertained that when a man does any action with his body, speech or mind, there are five canses that contribute to that action, vix, the body, the self, thu senses, the vital breath and fifthly Divinity or duitam" In that context the Divinity that is called the fifth (canse) is Purushotama When Prrushotama stimulates the jiva to perform in action, lle is called the karayiti or one who causes that action, He is (also ) called the kartī or doer in regard to those actions like the awarding of the fruit ( to the jiva) and the creation of the world. When He does not prevent the senlient being from performing an action, He is said to be indifferent. Since Ile permits it, He is said to be anumantü (i. e.) one who acquiesces. As Īśvara, sometimes, acts like an expert porter who carries a heavy veight to help an apprentice who can carry only a light burden, He is also said to co-operate (with the jīva ) (sahakürī). In such things as the 

76. Bhagavad Gita 18-15 

MEANING OF VRAJA 

523 

creation (of the woi kl), since differences like gods and men are due to the conditioning factor (upādhi) of their respective past karina, Īśvara is declared not to be the doer as stated in the śloka: "The fouri castes were created by me in accordance wtih such qualities as sattvam that are found in jīvas and also with their past karma. Though I perform the act of creation, I am not the real cause nor am I tainted by it." Thus from Īśvara who has the common and general doership of all things without exception, the jiva acqnires the power to make an effort and act in accordance with his own will. Therefore it is evident that the jiva is fit to be directed to do a thing and the word vraja may justly enjoin the performance of an action. 

Since the durma called saranagati can rightly be enjoined for performance, jnst like such things as blakti, the stateinent of Tirukkurnkai Piran Pillan (the foremost of the disciples of Sri Rāmanuja) that the good we do for ourselves is like wilk that is Lought (in the market) and that the good that comes from Iswarı is like mother's milk shonld be understood to mean that we should remember that bheiti, prapatli and the like result (from the grace of) (tod and that the jiva is solely dependent (on Īśvara).. (It does not mean that we are not right in performing blakti or prapalli and sliould leave everything to God.) 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

He who states that the texts which declare bhakti to be an upāya are only for the purpose of creating faith in prapatti is undermining faith in every svírstra withont directly appearing to do so. 

Bhakti as an upāya has been compared (by some critics of it) " to water from a sacred river contained in a pitcher but mingled with a drop of liquor". But this comparison or simile would hold good only when egoisia is mingled with (bhakti). The same condem.

nation would hold good in the case of prapatti also, when it is mingled with egoism or ahaukāra. 

It is stated by some that Aḷavandār begs, in the following śloka, forgiveness for baving performed prapatti - "Io consideration\* of iny grandfather, Nathamuni, and ignoring what I myself have done, vouchsafe unto me Thy grace." Here Aḷavandār is not seeking pardon for the prapatti which he performed in accordance with the süstras, on the ground that the performance was an offence. He is seeking pardon for any trace af egoism (ahanküra) that might have been present in him and no njore than that. If it were for having performed prapatti, he should beg the pardon (of the Lord) for having shown reverence to previous ācāryas, for this, too, would be an offence, being an action of his. Thus there would be no end to the making of apologies (anuvasthi (i.e.) infinite regress). If it is argued that this second begeing of for giveness is both for itself and for other offences, it might also be argued that the previous performance of prapatti is also begging forgiveness for that action and for previous actions. If these fallacious arguments were adopted, it would follow that the ancients, too, signed in performing prupatti and that it was not proper to show reverence to them. So the reverence shown in this stotra (by Aḷavandār) (to his grandfather etc,) at the beginning and at the end is either for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the prapatti done here or for removing any defects in the per forniance. As in this reverence shown to āchāryas, in prapatti and the like also, the doership that is subject to the will of another (viz Īśvara ) is no fault. There is a (wrong ) view that since the doership of the jiva is subject (to the will of Īśvara ), the self has no real doership and therefore if a man knows this real nature of his (that he is not a doer), Done of the forbidden actions that might be performed by hin will leave any stain on him.

'Being like a child' means 'remaining without revealing his "greatness' and this is established in the sūtra “Without revealing his greatness) for this fits in with the vid yā” (and pot behaving in a childish manner.) (The Gītā says :-) 

"To those that shave not renounced their doership and the fruit of their actions, the fruits of their karma will (certainly) follow and they will be of three kinds, what is undesirable, what is desirable and what is partly desirable and partly undesirable. These consequences of karmu never affect those who have renounced." und " He "who, while performing an action, does not think that it is done by him and whose mind has no attachment to the fruits of thut action -- . he does not slay any one even though he has slain all those that live in these three worlds"'These passages do not refer, as shown in Gutu.bhiskya to sins committed deliberately ifter the replaciarion. Otherwise they would conflict with inany instrus. Further the word "thongh he has slain" apply to what is done in a righteous War. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The contention that like a potent medicine which is taken now acting like a cure for upwholesome things that may be done in the future, prapatti will destroy any sins that might be committed after its performance - this contention is disproved by huodreds of texts in the srutis and the stritis which are directly applicable to the prapanna and are not sublated by other texts. 

In such ślokas as the following, Manu and others, too, pres cribed the conditions under which transgressions may be permitted: " When there is a real fear that want of food might cause death,

if a man eats food obtained from wherever it was possible, he will not be tainted by the sin thereof, in the same way as mire does pot stain ether (ākiis'a)" "At a tiipe" when there is a fear that want of food wight cause death, the man that eats the food obtained by him, whatever the source might be, will not be stained by the sja thereof, in the same way as water does not wet the leaf of the lotus." That this rule applies equally to the man who knows or ineditates on Brahman is seen stated in the Stitra which says, "At a time when death is feared ( owing to starvation ), the man (the ruan who meditates on Brahman) may eat any food, what soever, for the sāstras say so ” and this is taught there with the help of an illustration. Therefore the view that the self is not a doer and that it is entirely dependent (on Īśvara) and hence will not be stained by any sins committed after prapatti though they are deliberate and that no further prapatti need be performed (for their expiation) - this view is opposed to our siddhuinta (Sri Rāmanuja's doctrine ). 

In this context some ( commentators) explain the meaning of vraja otherwise ((i. e. that it does not enjoin any action) and state that to the aspirant to mukti, there is no upiya to be adopted except the knowledge of relationship that is learnt from the siistrus to exist between the jīva and Īśvara. They find support for this view in the following ślokas without comprehending their real purport. The ślokas are:- "The self is the propertyes of Bhagavad. He who considers his self as belonging to himself, is a thief of the self. Is there any form of sin that is not committed by him?" " Bhagavad controlses all beings in the universe from within the sphere of the sun and He is the ruler over all. He is within your heart and if you have no quarrel with him, you need not go (on a

pilgrimage) to the Ganga or to Kurukṣetru" and "Rememberka always that the Lord is the naster, that the self or atmit is His servant and that this relationship exists always by your very nature." This argument is opposed to the natural and self evident injunction for bhakti, prapatti and the like. Since listen. iny to Vedānta and reflecting on it arise from mere desire, there is no need also 10 enjoin the knowledge (of relationship) which arises from the s'üstras. (\* There is no need for the süstra to enjoin something which a man will do of his own accord). As is well known, it has been established in Sri Bhuishri) that if knowledge which need not be enjoined is called the means of attaining mukli, it would be opposed to the injunction orduining certain things for perforinance and there would be other objections too; (the injunc tion made in the sustras would serve no purpose at all). 

If this is admitted, the knowledge of the relationship between the jiva and Īśvara is indirectly helpful to all aspirants to makit, whatever vill vi they may adopt. When a man has acquired this knowledge from the sustrus, the question then arises “ What is the means or ipi ya for attaining Bhagavan, the Lord of Sri, who is our master and who imparts insurpassed bliss ?" When this question has arisen, the answer is that these means or upāyas are certain other forms of knowledge (other than the knowledge of relationship) which are enjoined for the purpose in accordance with each man's competence and they are bhakti and prapatti. Of these, prapatli is the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection along with its auxiliaries its stated in the following passage: "Wien the question\* arises : " To whom is this self to be surrendered for protection ? the answer is "To Viṣṇu ". In order to show that this (prajatti) should be performed with the knowledge of the relation ship existing between one's self and I:wara, it was stated that pra. patti is the knowledge of the relationship. (It does not mean that prapatli is ruerely that knowledge and notbing else). We have

CHAPTER 

already described at great length the essential pature (svarūpa) of this prapatti, its auxiliaries and the like (pages 115 - 135). 

TAMIL VERSE: 

"I ain the means as well as the end to be attained. The aspirant (to.mukti) should become subject to me and seek my protection. The upāya called saraṇāgati is not the direct means for the attainment. Sadhanas or means like bhakti yoga and karma yoga are no aids to prapatti; other troublesome angas are Bot required for prapatti. I will myself stand in the place of all sach means (as are prescribed for attaining the desired fruits). I am the messenger and the master. Seek me as your refage and be free from all apxiety". So says the Lord and surrounds me 

on all sides). 

THE MEANING OF THE WORD AHAM (1) IN 

THE SECOND HALF OF THE SLOKA 

Thus in the first half of the charama śloka, Sri Krishda enjoins, for a particular person (adhikari), the adoption of that upāya (prapatti) which is referred to in the first part of Dvaya and which has (in itself) the potency of all dharmas or rites and, at the same time a peculiar and unique potency of its own whicb none of them possesses (for it can destroy even that karma which has already begun to operate and yield its consequences). He has explained that this upāya does not require any special or ancillary dharmas on the part of the adhikari and has to be perforined only once. In the second half of the śloka, be graciously explains, at length, the fruit to be attained (by adopting this 1paya), which in (only) briefly indicated by the word namas in the second part of Dvaya. In the first half of the s-loka, Sri Kr̥ṣṇa stated that which has to be done by the person or adhikari (seeking mukti). In the second half. He states what He, as the Saviour who has accepted the responsibility of protecting, will perform and comforts the man who has done what he ought to do (se) performed prapatti. 

MEANING OF AHAMI ANI) TWA 

Here from the first person singular, mokṣu rishyami (I) will set Thee free). (from this) itself, the mending 'l' is evident. So the use of the word ahain (I) has the purpose of indicatiny. by virtue of its meaning, the power of accomplishing what is to others inipossible, for tbis is essential for setting (one) free from all sins. Its purport is this:- "I that bound the offender with fetters and that am destitute of equals and superiors am now full of compassion as the result of a vyāja or pretext and am bent on granting him pardon. (When I am thus inclined) there is no one to prevent me. Nor is there any one else who is capaile of making him attain freedom (from sids)". This idea is well-known from such passages as the following:--"Bhagavan Vishou is the giver of mokṣa". "The jivasa" have been boood with the bonds of kurma by tbe Supreme Being for His tili and they can be liberated from these bonds only by Him. No one else is capable of doing so." In this word aham (1), Bhagavan's natural compassion is the onperior aiding turce and the graciousness of the Lord which results from prapatii acts as a subordinate aiding force and Ilis independence ind omnipotence, which are irresistible, stand as the foremost and siree ageury to dispel all obstacles. If it be asked how, the unswer is as follows.--. "His natural compassion makes Him so gracious us to overlook countless ofiences in consideration of some slight pipirja or pretest. This graciousness accompanied by compassion makes the Lord's independence and omnipotence operate for the removal of all hindrances that stand in the way of prapannas. 'T'hus Īśvara, who has all the qualities essential for grauting freedom froin all sids, can act towards that end withont requiring any aid. This is the purport of the ahanı or (I) and it announts to saying " I myself (withont the belp of anybody else)". 

THE MEANING OF THE IORD TWĀ (THEE) : 

The word tuvui (Thee) means: Thon that hast acquired the power of discrinination (viveka) necessary to understand the (nature of the) three tattvus (reals) viz., cit, acit and Īśvara,

THE MEANINGS OF SARVA PĀPEBHYO (FROM ALL 

SINS) : 

Having this referred to the Dispenser of mukti who is capable of putting the jiva in bondage or out of it and also to the aspirant to mukti who is incapable (of any endeavour) and who has surrendered (to the Lord) the responsiblity for his protection, the śloka proceeds to speak of the bonds in the word sarvapūpebliyo (from all sids). Sin is the cause of evil and what it is can be understood from the s'üstras. Evil' means 'becoming subject to what is disagreeable and losing what is agreeable.' Here (in the charama - śloka) sin denotes also acts of inerit (punya) which lead to enjoy. ment in samsūra (which includes svarga), for they, too, are to the aspirant to mukti, productive of undesirable fruits. It has been said:-"This ølsvarga and other such places are, my child, like hell when compared with the abode of the Supreme Being". Thus to the aspirant to mukti, even such places as svarga are like hell. In the case of the aspirant, therefore, that which leads to svarga is, in no way, different from that which leads to hell. That is why the aspirant to mukti is enjoined to give up those means which lead to dharma, artha (wealth) and küma (pleasure), in the same way as he is enjoined to give up sinful actions. Indeed the Śrutis and the Smr̥tis declare that good deeds and evil deeds are both to be avoided by the aspirant to mukti, for it is stated "Giving up

of and 

punya and papa of which are both of the nature, karm which are hard to give up etc." 

Thus having denoted, by the word pāpa (sins), both punya and pāpa, which are the causes of bondage, the śloka indicates, by the plural of the word pāpa (viz. püpebhyall, their being countless. If so, it may be asked what purpose is served by the word sarva (all). (The apswer is) the word 'all' is used for the purpose of including among the hosts of sins, avdiyü or ignorance, the past impressions (vāsanas) which create a liking for adverse things, the taste (ruchi) for evil things and the contact with prakriti or watter both in its gross state and in its subtle state (io pralaya), for these are the causes of karma and also the products of karına. (Io the Saranagati Gadya), Sri Rāmanuja has, in three clauses chooranikas, indicated, both explicitly by the words themselves and implicitly from their meaning, those hindrances or obstacles which are referred to in all sins. The three passages begin with munovākkiiyaih' (by mind, speech and body). 

(A question might arise in this connection):- It is said, \*Having and ministere1 the aff uirs entrusted to them by the Lord for a long time and again and again, they reach the end of their karma and attain mukti, where jīvas who were formerly Brahmas, Indras, and Rudras, are enjoying bliss in Paramapada (the supreme abode)." (So also) it is said: "Those that have been appointed by the Sapreme Being) to be administrators should remain here in the world of saṁsāra) until the expiry of their period of administration". (We find also the following :-) The man who adopts a bhakti or upāsana as the means will have the bep •fit of the destruction (the fruits of) such karmas (punya and pāpa) as have not begun to yield their consequences at the very begioning of this upiisana; for (it is said) that there will be delay (for their attaining mukti) till the enjoyment is

completed of those karıas that have began to operate (prie rabdha). This is applicable even to those who are not adidini strators. The question may be asked:- "If so, what is the meaning of saying that the Lord will pardon also in the case of the prapanna) those karmas which have began to operate and yield their fruits ?" The answer is as follows:- “Even in the case of karmas which have begun to bear fruit, if the man who has adopted prapatti as the direct and independent upūya con. siders as evil and undesirable those parts which would lead to another birth or (even) another day's existence and grieves on that account, Īśvara will give bin pardon even in respect of all that kurna. If the prapanna is so impatient as to feel that he cannot bear to live without the immediate attainnient of mokṣa, the lord will, at that very instant, pardon even all that karma which has hegin to hear fruit so that no trace of it may be left over. There. fore there is no reason why one should not pray for pardon even in respect of that karma which has legun to bear fruit (priirabdha). 

(In the Survivvigati.gudpu Sri Ranınuja av:-) "Pandon all sins without exception, (sins) past, futme, and present - cona mitted by the mind, the speech, or the bedy." Here past (sins) refer to those committed before prapati and future (sins) refer to those that might le committed after the performince of prupulti. We do not see any sios committed at the instant of performing prapaiti. What, then, is the meaning of present (kriyamaina) sios? (The answer is):- By the word 'present' (kriyamiiṇa) is meant that which was begin before and which will be com pleted in future? According to this definition, those sins which were begun before and which require a long time for their completion and thuse that might be done on account of negligence or careless ness at the instant of performing prapatti - these are called present (sins) - Future (sin s) are those that may begin after prapatli. Among those sius which are committed after prapalli and which may be partly of the present and partly of the future, those which are not couunitted doliberately will be pardoped by Īśvara and will leave no trace at all (on the self). Those that are 

29 

MEANING OF SARVAPAPEBHYO 

533 

committed deliberately can be atoned for by the performance again of prapatti, for it is said:-"If an "offence be committed, expiation should be made therefor and the expiation to be made is only the performance of prapatti again." When it is said that if Īśvara is bent on granting mokṣa, even deadly sins cannot stand in the way, apd that there will be no punishment for sing committed delibe. rately after prapatti, what is meant is not that there is no need for expiation or priyaschitta, but that if Īśvara is again propitiated by prapatti, (which is the prāyaschitta), mokṣa is sure to follow. It is the result of God's forgiveness that the man is induced to perform expiation by a further prapatti. 

It has been said (by some richāryas) that, to Īśvara, the sins or offences of the jīva are (agreeable) like the dirt on the body of a beloved wife and like the slime on the body of the new-born calf to the cow. This only means that even if wicked men should perform prapatti, Īśvara will not forsake them and will bring them round to righteous ways. It does not mean that sins committed deliberately would give delight to Īśvara. If so, the prapanna should have, by all the means in his power, to commit such sins. 

Even if offences are committed deliberately owing to the peculiar nature of a nian's prakriti, and even if a further prapatti is not performed (by way of expiation), it is the peculiar character. istic of Īśvara's forgiveness that He sees to it that such prapannas do not go to hell and that He awards them light punishments (sufferings) as (kings do) in the case of their offending sons. Sins lead to sufferings that are seen and that are tangible and also to sufferiogs like those in hell. So when it is said that there is no hell for the prapanna as in the following ślokas :- “Those who87 consider Viṣṇu, the bearer of Saroga, as the supreme end of life and who perform prapatti to Him never go to the world of Yama" and “Whatever be the family into which they are born, and 

96. Lakṣmī Tantram: 17-91192. 98. ?? 97. Vamana-purāṇa: 94 - 43.534 OA APTER 

wherever they may live, those who are ever attached to Vasudeva never go to hell" when such statements are made to the effect that there is no hell for them, there is nothing in them to deny that they will not have any sufferings in this life itself (like blind ness). Logic cannot repudiate explicit statements (made in the sruti and the smriii). It is idle to say that, even in some of those who have committed offences and who have not repented for them by performing a further prapatti. we do not see such visible sufferings as blindness which are stated to be their punishments. Even in their lives, we may see such sufferings as the following in accordance with the seriousness of their offences :-- many varieties of suffering due to the three well-known canses (the elements of Dature, the body and supernatural powers), dullness of the intelli gence required for the Lord's service, the diminution of delight and the absence of it in the enjoyment of Bhagavan, the alssence of delight in rendering service to Bhagavan and His devotees, offences against the Lord and His devotees, the centre, the boycott and the like by the virtuous, the destrnction of their good deeds, the loss of the est en in which they were formerly held by good men, the suffering dine iu the frustration of their ambitions and desires, ilod such other forms of sorrow. It is well-known from the srutis, the Dhurma siistries of Nanu and others and from the Itihasis, Purunas and the pañcaratru that, for varied kinds of sins of omission and commission, there are varied kinds of visible suffering. Therefore when blindness and the like are taken by way of examplo, it should be taken only as one instance (and not as an invariable form of suffering). This is evident from the opeping words of the septence which speak of sofferings in the world in general, 

It is not possible to argue, with any certainty, that the varied sufferings which come to a man as the fruit of sins committed deliberately after prapatti and which find support in the authority of the texts are due to past karma which has begun to yield its fruit. These may conie as the result of either of the two kinds of karma. That is why good men (sõlvikus) dread offences that 

MEANING OF SARVAPAPEBHYO 

535 

might be committed deliberately. If this were otherwise, it would be opposed to the s'āstra which enjoins a further prapatti and to the code of conduct followed by virtuous men and to ancient tradition. 

(It is true) Nanjiyar stated that if a man does not feel reped tant after committing an offence, he shonld be considered as without knowledge. But what is meant is that his omission to repent is due to dulness of intelligence and not that the prapatti was not fnl. filled. Deliberate offences which would meet with Bhagavan's dis approval would not be committed by some men as these result from conditions created by past karma. Io the case of some others who commit such offences, repentance and the like put an end to them. Men of hard hearts may not repeat at all. Therefore if deliberate offences bappen to be committed, the inan should repent and perform prapatti again. If he does not, they would lead to light punishments or sufferings in accordance with what is said in the s'rutis and the like. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

Wise men who have performed prapatti would never think of committing offences deliberately, men of a mediocre intelligence repent (for such offences.) Hard - hearted men meet with punish ment for them. 

Therefore in order that there may be no punishment of any kind, one should guard against deliberate offences. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

When one performs the commands of the omnipotent Lord (nitya and naimittika karma) solely for the purpose of pleasing Him, no punishment will ensue, though he may not have thought (of avoiding any such punishment). 

If & prapanna should try, as much as it lies in his power, to avoid offences, be should avoid. even more carefully, offences

against the devotees of Bhagavan and association with those who commit such offences. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

The countless and serious sips committed by the man who meditates on Brahman (Brahinavit) will be transferred to the man who hates hijo. Realising this, one should dread committing any offence against a Brahmavit. 

Even by associatiog with one who has offended against the devotees of Brahman, a man will incur sins. (At the same time) & man should not hate one who offends against the devotees of 

Īśvara, who alone is competent to punish hint. 

TAMIL VERSE 

The Lord, whose will is irresistible and who creates, in the minds of those who do not care for him, all their desires and who also frustrates them -- the Lord has turned my mind today froni sansüra or bondage and has placed me beneath His two feet for protection. He has been pleased to forget His wrath caused by my actions in the past prompted by my mind before the perfor mance of prapatti and has appeared already (as avatars and archii) to grant we mukti. He sipiles gently, wondering whether we shall accept His grace today or tomorrow. 

THE MEANING OF THE IVORN MOKSHAYISHYIMI 

(I WILL SET THEE FREE) 

The word mokṣayishyami 'I will set thee tree from all sins) means "I will haunt thee release (from the bondage of samsara) at the time when you want it".

537 

taken literally." The answer to this question is as follows:-- 

• There is no conflict between these two statements for they apply to different cases. "I will not forgive" occurs in the śloka : “Though a man adores me with a hundred lotnses, O Goddess of the earth, whichevel 10 devotee of Viṣṇu touches blood even unawares I will not pardon bin. I will never pardon bis offence, O Goddess of the Earth, even if he tries to show me a hundred marks of reverent attention (upachāra)". It only means. "I will not forgive the man for such trivial forms of expiation (as the uffering of lotuses and external marks of attention). Here in the Charamaśloka, the word mokṣa yishyimi (means “I will forgive all (offences) if the man adopts the particular upüya which is an atonewent for all sins.” The intention of the Saviour is expressed indeed in the śloka :---"Be itm Vibhighana or Ravana himself, bring him here, O Sugrīva. I will grant him pardon." These words are not seeming-pleasant, for there is no conflict between what is stated in Varihapurānam) aod what is stated in the Gita, as they apply to different situations. If they are to be taken as only seeming-pleasant, all the texts in the süstras which enjoin bhakti and prapatti would be void of authority, 

Here “Releasing from sins " menns Īśvara giviug up His intention to punish the singer for having violated His commands from beginningless time. By this turning away (of Īśvara) froio the thought of punishuiuent, the effects of His punishnient, such as uvid yā or ignorance, would all cease lo exist. Isware's turning away from the thought of punishment means His will which takes tbe form: “By my gracetal will the loan who performs all his duties as for nje and as being done by me attain the world that is etertial". The cessation of such things as avidya in the jiva iDeans the expansion of inteiligence, kuowledge, wisdow and such others.

DE CHAPTER 

The manner and the order in which the causes of sumsāra, which are of the nature of punya and papa will disappear are as follows - The bindrances to the adoption of the upiya have dis appeared already by their respective causes (such as the performance of the rites and duties of varnas und üsranas), then the punyas and papas done before the adoption of the upāya which are opposed to the attainment (of mukti) will disappear without any trace at the beginning of the adoption of the upiya, provided they are not such as have already begun to yield their fruit prarabdha). Among sins committed after prapatti, those offences which may be com mitted without any awareness of them and which are the result of unfavourable conditions of place, time and the like will not in the least taint (the self). Those offences which are committed delibe rately when there is no danger of death will cease either by some form of atonement or expiation which is within the ruan's power or by experiencing the frnit of the karma which would be of the gature of a light punishment. That portion of the karma which has begun to yield its fruit to the prapanna that will have to be experienced within the tinie desired by him (for nukti) will disappear either by the experience or enjoyment of the fruit or by an intervening rite of expiation. That which remains will disappear by the potency of the upüya (prapatti). 

Among those good deeds (pulya) which are done deliberately with thought both (of mokṣa and of sainsīra), such as are not hindrances and such good deeds (purya) done before and after the adoption of the upāya by the uprisaka ls are capable of streng theoing his vidya or Meditation -- these will disappear after having yielded their fruit. Those good deeds (punyu) done before and after the adoption of the upiya (damely, upisana) which are of no use to the meditation or vidyu and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit and those good deeds, done before and after, which are useful for the meditation but which have had no occasion to yield their frnit owing to the superior strength of (other) karma favourable for the meditation and unfavourable for it and which still remain without yielding their fruit - these too, will disappear 

MEANING OF MOKSHAYISHYAMI 

539 

in the last monents of the man's life. This truth is expressed in the sütra "By 16 the same principle, the deeds, too, which are other than sinful will not stain (the self)." Those good deeds (which are the cause of rain, food and the like which are necessary for the performance of the vidyā) will cease to exist immediately after the fall of the body". 

Since those good deeds which were performed solely for pleasing the Lord and which were merely of the nature of service have already yielded their fruit, there is no need to speak about their staining the self. Those deeds which were performed by the man for setting an exanıple to the rest of the world (lokasaṅgraha) had to be performed as commands of the Lord. They are of the nature of pure kainkarya or service and have already given their fruits. Among them, if any such good deeds were done without the renunciation of egoism (sātvikatyāga) out of carelessness, they, too, would amonnt to sins as stated in the śloka "Tapas is!\* no sin, the study of the Vega is no sin, the rites and duties prescrib ed for each man are no sins, nor is the earning of money by hard work for their sake a sin. If these very things are done with a wrong intention with the thought, “I am doing this and doing this for myself", they become sinful". These (sins) will become subject to the release promised in mokṣa pishyiimi. Those pra. pattis that were performed for other ends (than mukti) must have already yielded their fruit. 

For the sake of the end for which a former prapatti was performed, a second or further prapatti ought not to be performed, as it would be inconsistant with the potency of prapatti and with the intense and great faith with which the first prapatti was performed. If one were to perform more than one prapatti for the sake of a single end in view, it would be like adopting another upāya (and there would be need for atonement).

The disappearance or destruction of past karma means Īśvara's giving up the thought of awarding the person the fruit thereof. When karma is said not to stain or taint the self (aslesha), it means that the thought of awarding the fruit or consequence of the karma in the case of those who have sought His protection does not even arise ip Īśvara. 

If it be asked"(It is stated in the srutis that the good deeds and the bad deeds of the man who is to obtain mukli will be distri. buted among his friends and his foes respectively (at the last moment of his life). If good deeds and had deeds for past karna) are all destroyed in the manner described above, how can this distribution take place ?" The answer is: The distribution among foes and friends will be, respectively, of those evil deeds which are said not to taint and to be destroyed, (aslesha and vināsa) and those good deeds (punya) which are done deliberately after the adoption of the upāya and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit hy stronger karma. (It is said in the srutis) that Īśvara distributes these among the man's friends and foes at the time of his death, Why should Īśvara wait until the time of the map's death for this distribution, when He could as well bave done so, at the very beginning when the man adopted the upāya ?" The answers to these questions are as follows: "A man may have behaved with favourable intentions towards the devotee at first, but later he may change and behave with evil intentions. In such circum stances the good deeds should not have already been given away to the friend (who has afterwards turned foe). Further the Lord desires to give opportunities to foes who have done evil to the devotee to beg for forgiveness. These are the reasons why Īśvara does not effect the transfer of the good and the bad karma until the last inoments of the devotee. 

The good deeds done by a man for the sake of such ends as svarga are, to the aspirant for mukti, of the pature of sins (papa).. Hence such good deeds (of tbe devotee) will not be transferred to bis friend, if the latter is an aspirapt for mukti.

--- ---- -- ------- ---· ---- --- -- - ---- It may be asked "What is the ineaning of transferring tho karmas performed by one man to some others?" The answer is as follows:---"' he punishment or reward which Īśvara intended to award to those who performed these karmas is now transferred to his foes and friends in equal measure," It may be asked, “If punishmenis and rewards for the karmus performed by one man are to be awarded to some other man or wen, would there not be too wide ao iupplication (atiprusungu) (i.c.) the punishment does not go to the evinduer but to some body else who has pot done evil. It is also against the principle that he who sowed must reap the harvest". The answer is this:- There will be no such unfairness due to tov wide an application (utiprasung«), because the rewards und punishments are awarded in accordance with the obligations or offences done, respectively, by these friends and foes to the aspirant for mukti. That is why it is nowhere stated that these good deeds and bait deeds are transferred to those who are neither friends nor foes. The word 'transfer is used here in the sense that (their friends and foes) will have fruits similar to those of the karmas said w be transferred. This sruti which speaks of the transfer of good and bici deeds suggests the extreme of pleasure and displeasure that the Lord would feel, if the obligations and offences de done to the journi (the mu of wisilom) who is extrempe. ly dear to the Lord. 

If we take the interpretation given in the sloku (on paye 318), varva papeblıyoh (from will xlos) would briefly include, as desired hy the man, all hindrances to tht itttainvient of the Lord, all miodrances to the proper adoption of the upāya and also the causes uf experiencing disagreeable things. 

Here the hindrance to the attainment of the Lord is the Lord's will that the offender shall not enjoy Him. The hindrance to the 

NOTE\* This interpretation:-"If a man is in despair at the thought that he is incapable of performing whatever will produce the ends desired by him, I myself stand in the place of those actions.") 

542 CHAPTER 

upāya is the Lord's will that the offender shall not understand Hiru aright and do wbat is necessary to propitiate Him. The causes of experienciog disagreeable things consist in the will of God that the man shall experience the consequences or fruits of doing such karmas as displeased Him. 

If all punishments are cancelled in the case of the aspirant for mukti, the effects of such punishments, namely, contact with acit and the like will stand cancelled by the Lord's grace which cancell ed the punishments. Thereafter since there are no causes, there will be no such effects as disagreeable experiences. This is indicated in the siitra: "The man who has attained 108 mokṣa will never return to saṁsāra, for the s'rutis say so", These conclusions are within the reach of the knowledge of those very wise men who have stndied Sri Bhashya for a long time along with the traditions of the good. 

Thus (the words) "I will release thee from all sins" speak of the removal of the stream of all hindrances which are of the natuce of either causes (the Lord's will to punish) or effects (avidyñ and the like); it means the same thing as saying that the self will (then) have the manifestation (āvirbhiva) of the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan. For Bhagavad Sonnaka says:-"When thelo dirt is washed away, the gew shines of itself, but the sheen is not newly produced. In the saine way, when the self casts off its blemishes or faults, jrrāna is not newly created in it (for it is already there). When a tapk is dug, water and space are not newly created. What is already present is now brought to mani. festation. How can a thing which did not exist before arise anew? So by the casting off of evil qualities, good qualities like jnūna shine forth. They are pot dewly produced, for it has been stated (in the sāstras) that they are eternal qualities of the self". Since the substance called jnūna or knowledge and its inherent power to cover all objects are both eternal, the right word to use is 'mani festation' (i.c.) it is used in its primary sense.

(It is true that) the expansion of jnīra or knowledge to cover 

do what is good and other such things and the foring of service or kainkarya arise anew. Still as their origin depends on the con ditional factor (upādhi), namely, the removal of hindrances thereto, the word 'manifestation' (avirbhara) is used in such places as: " May 19 the perforidance of different kinds of service which are natural to myself manifest itself." This is in order to show that when the hindrances disappear, these services will automatically follow. (In the state of sumsiira), the objects (in the Universe) which are all the glorious possessions of Bhagavan appear dis. agreeable in various ways or (only) slightly agreeable as a result of the conditioning factor (upūdhi), namely, karma. In the state of mokṣa, they would all become agreeable (siuce karma has dis appeared), as agreeableness is their natural quality. Therefore in that state, too, the word 'Inanifestation' (of agreeableness) may justly be used. Therefore the words "I will release thee from all sios" nake it evident that the self will have a new state in which all things will mauifost their datural agreeableness to it. 

If the word ckan means the identity of the upāya and the peya or the end of attainment (as has already been indicated), this attainment of the desired end is also made plain. Therefore the idea that was expressed clearly in the śloka (Gītā - 18 - 65), namely “Thou wilt come to me" may be considered to be stated ia the churāṇa śloka (also) by the meaning implicit in the word ekam, and by the statement that the hindrances to that attainment are destroyed ----(I will release thee from all sios). Therefore the wharama-śloka cannot be said to snpplement or explain what has been stated in the preceeding sloku.\* 

107. Ashtasloki: 3. 

NOTE: The author declares that the charama-śloka is not explanatory of the previous śloka (Gita 18-65) as stated by some who consider it to refer to bhaktiyoga. It is independent of the previous śloka and concerns itself with prapatti.544 

SRIMAD RAHASYATRA YASARA 

CHAPTER 

Here an objection that has no soundness in it may be raised to this effect:-"When it is said "I will release thee from all gins", does it follow from those words alone that the release from sins would lead to the attainment of Bhagavan stated in "Thou wilt reach me?" Is it not possible that, with the removal or pardon of all sins, the self may attain the state called kaivalyan in which it enjoys only itself without attaining Bhagavan ? That there is a state called kaivalyam, has, it is well known, been declared in such treatises as Naradiya kalpam, where we find the śloka :-- "This mantra enables a man to obtain wealth and lord ship in this world, svarga and the like in the world beyond, kaivalya (the enjoyment of one's own self) and the enjoyment of Bhagavau". Alavandac also says " To those who desire to have wealth and lordship, the enjoyment of their own self dissociated from the body and, likewise, the performance of kainkarya or service at the feet of the Lord etc. etc." He says also (elsewhere): \* Without the grace 208 of Lakṣmī, the beloved consort of the Lord with the lotus eyes, we cannot have the valuable things desired (hy men) in samsara, the enjoyment of the disembodied) self, i kaivalya) and the enjoyment of Bhagavan". In the Gady, also, is found quoted (the sentence) in Jitantu stotrı - “Leaving all desired pleasures and the enjoy nient of the (disemboditd) self, I have reached Thy feet." This truth is also stated at length in Sri Rāmanuja's Gitā-blushya and such other writings. There fore should not the freedom from all sins which results from the statement "I will release thee from all sins" be considered common to kaivalya and the enjoyment of Bhagavau ?". 

The objection (slated on far) is unsound for the following reasons:- " If all sins have disappeared, there is no reason wby the self should be without the experience of Bhagavan, which is its natural and inherent right. Therefore the state of the enjoy ment of the mere self (kaivalyam) without the enjoyment of Bhagavan would not be the goal of attainment then. Hence in 

108. Gitarthasaṅgraba : 12.

that state (kaivalyam), (we should understand that) the karmas which produce wealth, and such sufferings aus old age and death have disappeared but that the karma which is a bindrance to the perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan has not yet been destroyed. This state (of kaivalya) is a particular kind of enjoyment which consists in the experience of one's own disembodied self. Of this state it has been said :-"lo that experience of the self, the self feels that there is nothing greater than it", and also, “If a man desires! this enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, these three (karma yoga, jnāna yoga and bhakti yoga) will enable him to attain that extreme which is called kaivalyure". As stated (in these ślokas), this expe rience in which there is neither contact with acit or watter nor knjoynent of Bhagavan and which results from the adoption of a particular upīra within the man's ability was called kaivalyam, because it is the enjoyment of the mere (kevala) sell without association with either acit or Bhagavan. 

(In some places) mukti or the attaininent of Bhagavan is called by the word kaivalyam in order to show that all upādhis or conditioning factors have ceased to exist in mukti. So also the word mukti is sometinies employed to denote the experience of the disembodied self as in the śloka "O, Lord of Hastigiri," I look upon all the enjoyments of this world, the title of Brahma, the high position of Rudra, and the experience of the disembodied self, which is called mukti - I look upon these as water poured in the soil saturated with salt. I koow the bliss of rendering service to Thee". The word mukti employed here should be explained as in the śloka :- " The man who it is free from desire, fear and anger - he is always a mukta (aven here in saṁsāra). It only means "He resembles & mukta". It inay be asked "Is it (kaivalyam) pot stated to be freedom from old age, and death ? " The answer is that it is just like calling the gods immortal (amara), (That is : they are not truly immortal.) Compared

with human beings, they may be said to be relatively inmortal, for they live much longer. Or it may be explained as stating that kaivalyam will lead, in course of time, to mukti. In the same way should be explained the use of the word nukti when it is intended to mean merely the attiinment of the same abode or loka as that of \*the Vibhavas or Vyihas and also samipya and sārūpya. 

It has been declared that real mukti is different from the others) in the (following) śloka:-"Some live 318A in the worlds of Viṣṇu. This is sālokyam (living in the same loka or world as Viṣṇu). Some reach near Him. This is sāmipyam (attaining 

place near Viṣṇu). Some others attain a form resembling that of Viṣṇu. This is sāriipyam (having a form resembling His). Others still attain sayujyam and it is this which goes by the name mokṣa". The sižyujyam referred to here is going to Paramapadu and enjoying the same bliss as that of Bhagavan (and this alone is real and true mukti). That the experience of the mere disen bodied self is not eternal and that it is not real mokṣa are evident from these ślokas :- "There are four kinds' of people who are mide and who are called my devotees. Ainong them, those who are exclusively attached to me (ekiintins) are the best, for they worship no other deities. To these men who perform their duties and rites without any attachment or desire for their fruit. I am alone the goal. The other three virtuous kinds of bhaktas or devotees are said to be desirous of certain ends. All these (three) are liable to fall (from their bigh state) but the jnani (who is an ckiinti attains mokṣa " (Again it is said) : " Having 118 listened to this story, the man who has lost his wealth will become free from the sorrow due to it; the man (jijnirsuh) who wants to enjoy his disembodied self will attain bhakti or devotion (to the 

NOTE : He who worships or meditates on the Vihhavas ( avatars ) or Vyuhas will, after death, go to the world of the Vibhayas or V'ynhas in accordance with the principle called tatkranu: As he meditates, so will he bc “ from that world after meditation on the Supreme Being, he will reach Pardmapada, which is true mokṣa). 113A, Bhagavatam

Lord), tbe bhakta or devotee will attain mokṣa". This amounts to stating that the jijnüsuh spoken of in the Gitii, who is desirous of experiencing his self, will, in course of time, become a jnsini. It has been said :- “When thello attachment to the pleasures of life ceases, the self, which is different from the body and which is happy, will become manifest. Without being canght (in this state) viz, kaivalge, if yon want to realise that your essential nature consists in being sesha to Bhagavan and in being eternal, get hold of Bhagavan and then give up the pleasures of worldly objects." In this (Tamil verse) the enjoyment of Bhagavan is said to be eternal and the experience of the disembodied self, which is distin. guished fronı it, is indirectly stated to be not eternal. It is true that) the experience of the measureless self is described as imperish ahle or without changes like diminution or increase; - like the state ment of the fruit of the rite called chuiturmiisya being imperishable; it only means that it will last for a very long time (i. e.) many and many a kalpa (and not that it is eternal). This locality where the self enjoys itself is thus described :-- " The place'1called the amritam of yogis is the place to which those who want to enjoy their own self go." That this locality is not Paramapada is also evident from another) siloka in the very sanie context: "Those who12 are yogins and who, being ekāntins, are constantly meditat. ing on Brahman, reach that supreme abode which the eternal stiris are gazing at. (It is clear from this, that the ekantin who is desirous of attaining Bhagavan is here stated to go to a place other than that (to which the man who is desirous of enjoyiog his self would go) and that it is it place gazed at by the săiris, 

In such treatises as Sri Bhashya (and Gitābhishya ) it ha: been stated that those who meditate on their self with Brahman as its inner self as in Panchirgni-vidya and the like pass (after death) along the archirudi route and attain Brahman.

Therefore to those that meditate on their self according to the Panchāgni vidyā, there is an intermediate result or experience consisting in the enjoyment of the mere self. However, according to the principle explained in the madhu vidya, they will ultimately attain Brabuan. If, however, the neditation is on the self either as associated with prakriti or matter or as disembodied or dissociat ed from matter, whether the self is meditated on in its essential nature (svarīpu) or as if it were Brahman, -- in all these four cases, as when name (nūma) and the like are meditated on as if they were (Brahman), there is neither the passage along the archirīdi route por the attainment of Brahman. This is declared in the following :-- Bādarāyana is of 120A opinion that the Ati vühikas (escorts) lead those who do not weditate on pratikas (i.e.) parts or aspects (of Brahman). In either of the other alternatives, there is conflict (with the srutis) and also with the \*principle of tat-kratu. In another context to prove that the being rpeditated on in that vidyā is (not the jiva (but) the Supreme Being or Brabinan, the Sūtrakāra gives this as his reason for saying 80 : "Since the person who meditates according to this vidyii is said to pass along the archirūdi route.” This is done in the sõitra “sioce 19 puention\* is made of the route meditated on by those who have listened to the Upaniṣads” (i.c.) to those who ineditate on Brabnian. 

Therefore to those who do not attaiu Brahman, there should not have been the cancellation of all sins spoken of in the charama 

\* NOTE:- If it is said that only those who mcditate on Brahman will attain Brahnian, it would conflict with ponchagni vidya, according to which he who meditates on his self with Brahman as its inner self will travel along the archiradi roure and reach Brahman). If. on the other hand, it is said that those who meditate on (not the cause i e.) Brahman (but) on the effect such as prakriti. nama iname) and the like, it would conflict with what is stated in Sad vidja Therefore Badarāyaṇa expresses his conclusion negatively thus : \* The escort leads, by the archiradi route, those who do not meditate on parts or aspects of Brahman pratikus: From this it would follow that those who medi tate on Brahman alone would take the archiradi route and also those who meditate on the self but with Brahman as its inner self. Tat-kratu is the principle which states the truth “ As a man meditates, so will he be". So if he meditates on the self alone, he will become the self (and not attain Brahmao). 120A Brahmasutras: 4-3-14.

siloka. To those whose sins have been pardoned or cancelled, there is no limitation in regard to the enjoyment of Brahman, Thus since in this śloka, the annulment of all sins is declared, (we have to understand that) even that particular karma which resulted in the experience of the mere self and which stood as a bindrance to the fall and perfect enjoyment of Brahman is annulled or cancel led. From this it would follow that what is stated in the previous śloka nauely, " 'Thou wilt attain myself” is declared in this śloka also mām cva eshyasi. "Thou wilt attain myself" means "the full and perfect enjoyment of Brahman'. In order that this perfect enjoyment may happen, the archirādi route has to be traversed and a particular region or locality has also to be reached. 

It is clear from the sāstras which speak of such things as this route that, from beginningless time, the independent and omni. potent Lord has made it a rule that the full and perfect enjoyment (of Himself) should be granted in this order (namely, the archiridi route, the entrance into the region or locality and then the enjoy ment). 

Before starting on the archirādi route, when a man under stands the essential natore (svarīpa) of Brahman with the belp of the sustras and so also when he has a vision of Brahman with the help of yoga and when he reaches such worlds as those of Vibhava, the vision or realisation which he gets results from some specific good deeds and is dependent on the instruments of knowledge. Therefore this vision will be partial or limited and liable to interru ption. But the vision that results in the state of mukti is full and perfect, because there are no factors that limit or diminish the experience nor is it liable to any further interruption or break, As an Overflow (parivāha) of this enjoyment arises the perfect service or kuinkarya in which the s'eshi (the Lord) finds delight and this

idea is expressed in the s-loka: "Though' yon live for a hundred years, I will always be your servant. Therefore give me orders saying . " Do this in this beautiful place." Here all the successive stages of realisation (or fruit) which are stated (by Sri Rāmanuja , in the (Saraṇāgati) Gadya in the sentence with the word pāramarthika are also implicitly suggested in accordance with the pramūnas. 

THE MEANING OF MĪ SUCHAH (DO NOT GRIEVE - DO 

NOT DESPAIR) 

Thereafter the words "Do not griove" reveal the certainty of what has been stated before ". 

There are some commentators) who hold that "Do not grieve" enjoins something to be avoided. (According to thein ), if, after at man has performed prapatti, be grieved or fell into despair, he would be violatiog the injunction and the Saviour who is the upüyor would become indifferent and leave him to look after himself. The man would thus become liable, in their opinion, to this disad vantage or risk. This view is opposed to their own commentary on the sins committed deliberately after prapatti and on the words " from all sins". It is also opposed to the texts in the s'rutis and the Smr̥tis which declare that the Saviour will never forsake the man who has songbt His protection. Therefore since all causes for grief or despair have disappeared in the case of the man who has adopted this upāya, it repeats that there is absolutely no cause for despair and aims at confirrwag the nian's faith. 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS :-- 

Many causes of sorrow (in the case of Arjuna) like those con cerning the destruction of relatives have already been removed by appropriate and excellent teaching. Now the sorrow or despair caused by the thougbt that the dharma or rites enjoined (for mukti)

are too difficult to perform, that the hindrances to mukti are insuperable and that the end in view can be attained only after protracted delay - it is this sorrow that is now dispelled. 

(The Lord) intends to say: After I have taught you this upāya, which, without being too bard to adopt for the end desired by you, is also capable of annulling all hindrances that stand in the way and is not liable to cause any (undue) delay in the attainment of that aim -- after this has been taught to you, there is no room for despair due to such things is the difficulty of adopting an upāya. If you adopt this up iyu, your welfare is my burden or responsibility and I shall myself be interested in looking after it. If I do not protect you, it will be a reproach to me. You are, as it were, muy property or wealth (to look after) and there is no reason why you should grieve". 

The grief that is here put an end to is not the old sorrow carsed (in Arjana's mind) by the thonght of killing (bis) relatives. It is a different kind of grief that has to be consistent with the context. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows :- "The rich qualities!\*\* that distingnish the nature of the gods lead to mokṣa, the qualities that make for the nature of the Asuras are the causes that lead to bondage". When the two were thus distio guished, Arjuna was grieved at the thought of what he should do if be belonged to the class of Asuras. Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, who understood this, said to him :- "O Pandava! do not grieve. You are boro to attain the rich qualities of the gods". Similarly here, when (Arjuna) is extremely desirous of attaining the supreme end, he grieves at the thought tbat the upāya taught 80 far has to be adopted for a long time, and is subject to many hindrances, while being extremely difficult of performance even for those who are very careful. At the thought of that «paya and of bis own (want of) capacity for adopting it, he grieveà, saying to himself "Hoir can I succeed in adopting this upāya and secure the end in view?" To Arjuna who was in despair (at this thought), Sri Kr̥ṣṇa shows

another upāya which can be dnly performed in a single instant, which is without any obstacles, and which is (also) easy of perfor mance. By doing so, He makes Arjuna care.free and certain in regard to the attainment of the desired end and then says, “ Do not griove". So the words should certainly be understood as intended to dispel the despair due to such things as the difficulty of adopting the (former) upāya. (It is only this grief that is here put an end to and no other). 

In this Bhagavad Giti, the Gitācārya, at first, imparts a knowledge of the difference between prakriti (inatter, the body) and the soul or self; then He describes karma yoga and jñāna yoga which are indirect means leading to mokṣa; thereafter Fe teaches bhakti yoga with its angas, which has been enjoined as the direct means of attaining mokṣa and says:-- "Thus 124 has been taught to you the joint which is the most secret of all secrets. Consider all these and then do what you desire to do". Though He perceived the dissatisfaction that passed over Arjuna's face at that instant, Sri Kr̥ṣṇa did not at once favour him with instruc tions concerning the easier upüya, for it has been said: "The Lord of 128the world tests the minds of those who are weak of heart". Instead of declaring the final conclusion by saying: " This is the direct ineans of attaining mokṣa and is supremely good to you. Act in accordance with this." - instead of saying so, he says:-"Do whatever you wish to do," as if He were indifferent (and not interested in Arjuna's spiritual welfare) like one who tells a traveller, " This \*\*route leads to the land of the Vidarbhas and this other to the land of the Kosalas. (Take which aver you choose)". Sri Kr̥ṣṇa makes others think that this is the cause of Arjuna's mental depresssion and enjoys the līlā of instructing him once again in the principal means of attaining mokṣa viz., bhakti yoga. He hegios by stating : " I will teach you again this greatest secret of all ", and in two silokus explains

to him, conclusively and with deep earnestness, what it is, so that he may remember that it is just what has already been taught. On seeing that Arjupa's depression has become twice as great as before, the Supreme Ruler, who is (now) the Charioteer, feels that Arjuna is now in a state of fitness to receive instruction in regard to the means of attaining mokṣa (viz. prapatti) which is the supreme secret and is, at the same time, extremely easy of adoption. Without the least delay, even without prefacing that upāya with any praise, the Lord immediately teaches him to perform sāranā. gati towards Hinself. Thus acting as the Charioteer also to the chariot of Arjuna's mind, (i.e. to all his aspirations), the Lord dispels all bis griefs. That the grief which is here pnt an end to is therefore different from the oli grief concerning the destruction of his relatives etc.) thus becomes cle:tr after a careful consideration of the context (in which the words occur). 

In the first half of this sloku, since (the Lord) says to the man who is destitute of all other niyas, "Take refuge under me alone," the man who is incapable (of making any endeavour) surrenders the resposibility tof his protection) into the hands of One who has the ability. Further the independent and omnipotent Seshi, who is compassionate, accepts the responsibility. There fore (in the first half of the śloka), the prapanna becomes free from all responsibility iu regard to bis own protection. And since the Seshi, who is omnipotent and is ever truthful towards those who have sought His protection, has accepted the responsibility and is 90 gracious as to say .-"I will release you from all sins", there is absolutely no likelihood of any evils like hell ensuing in the future. Freedom from fear results from this śloka, as also free dont.om all doubt, because these are the glorious and true words of Sri\*\* Ranganatha Himself, who is ever truthful. 

(\*\*NOTE: Here the reference is to the words of Sri Ranganatha as recorded in Saranagati Gadya : “ Therefore be free from all uncertainty about the attainment of knowledge concerning myself, about having a vision of myself and also about the attainnient of myself).":554 CHAPTER 

Therefore, if one has been told about this special upāya and if vue adopts it, one will have no grief or despair, at all, in connection with that upuya. 

Here it may be asked :-- From the words “Do pot grieve", it is evident that grief ( at one's being without upāyas) wakes one competent for prapatti; how then could it be stated that fear is also one of the marks of competency for prapatti, as shown in the following śloka :-"I dreadaaz, O, best of gods, at the sight of this saṁsāra which fills me with fear, Save me, O Lord of the lotus eyes. I know of no other upāya than Thee ", and in the Tamil verse:-“ Embrace this red-hot iron pillar, 0, sinner"; in dread at these words, I have come and sought Thy feet for protection.” To this question the answer is as follows:- Having realised that Lie end desired by him has not been so far artaided, the man 

reves; he is also afraid at the prospect, in future, of formidable obstacles to the end desired by him. Therefore ( he has both grief ind fear) In the case of the aspirant to mukti, when either of the twu viz., the annuluent of what is undesirable and the attain 

pent of what is desired is mentioned, the other also comes to the mind). In the same way when either of the two marks of competency for prapatti, viz., grief and fear, is nientioned, thu otiver is also taken for granted. In the wan who is absolutely without payas (and is therefore fit for perforining prapatti), these two, grief and fear, are excessive. Therefore by way of conclusion, this adhikari who is overwhelmed with excessive grief is tanght the upüya which is appropriute for him, and is thereby madde free of all doubt, free from all responsibility (concerning is protection), free from all fear and thus delighted at heart. On this extreme feal', we have already stated as follows :- " The Lord bis cine.129 - the Lord who said: - “ Thon that art afraid of scimsuiru, conje and seek protection from me".

The prapanna who has done what lie ought to do (i.e) prapaitli, should continue) to perform the rites and duties (ordained for his vara and üsrama) (nitya and naimillika), which are among the kainkaryas done by the virtuous : such karma as is described in the following śloka - " Do ibat\* karm which, when performed, does not yield any fruit and which, when omilted, will bring in evil.” This is evident from the passages which are found before and after this śloka and also in this very śloka, where it is said that tho omission will cause evil. Therefore since the prapamu) has no uncertainty concerning the attaioment of the viesired end, since he has nothing further to do for the sake of mokslia, sinch what he has yet to perform is only the keeping of (the Lord's) commands for their own sake, and since, if offences should be committed (there-after), they could easily be atoned for hy repentance and the like as pojoteil out in another chapter -- there is no reason why he should not feel delighted at heart. Thongh this delight is ningled with disgust (nirveda) in the intelli gent (prapaina) who is still connected with such unwholesomne things as the body, yet the two may exist without any inconsistency a: the disgust and the delight are due to different factors respectively. 

The words "Do not grieve" are, themselves, an indication of the cancellation of all causes of grief; even that portion of the karma which has already begun to operate (prirabdha) and which will cause grief will be cancelled and the man who is so impatient as not to be capable of existing even for a moment longer will attain mokṣa at that very instant. As stated in the Tamil verse : "The Lord is's one who, to those that seek His protection, grants Vaikuṇṭha at the time of their death”, we have to believe that all that unexpired part of the karma which has already begun to operate (prārabdhe) will be annulled and that mokṣa will be at the death of this body. Therefore if, in this bodily existence itself, it be felt by a man) that what remains of this life is an evil, it will also

556 CHAPTER 

certainly be cancelled by the will of the omnipotent Lord whose grace has been secured by prapatti. 

(In this congection it may be asked whether it is not a sin to desire to die iin niediately after performing prapatti). The answer is as follows:-) 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

In some forms of expiation for sins (prayaschitta) and like. wise, in certain kinds of offering (made in the fire) like sarvasvāra karma, it is not considered a sin if the man gives up life (by casting the body down a precipice or in the fire), So also there is no impropriety in praying for instant death in the saramagati of tile prapanna who cannot bear to continue in samstra even for a moinent (ārta). On the other hand, the prapanna who desires to live a long life (dripta) commits an offence, if he violates the rule in the sastras which enjoins the protection of one's own life. 

In the same way as yogis cast off their bodies in virtue of certain yogas practised by them, there is nothing to prevent the man who, while performing frapatti, longs to die immediately. It cannot be said that such casting off of the body is not permitted to those who are in Kali yuga, like entrance into holy waters for giving up one's life there. In fact the artha prapanna who prays for immediate death is one who saves his self sooner than all others. 

Prapannas are spoken of as belonging to two classes ārtas and driptas on account of the difference in the intensity of the grief felt by them respectively, (It should not, therefore, be thought that the latter iiz., the dripta has no grief. The dripta pra. panna is one who grieves at the thought of another janma and believes that he will some day or other attain mokṣa and has the patience to wait until the end of this existence. The word dripta is here used not io (the usual) sense of one who has arrogance or pride, which is a quality opposed to the virtues of the soul and leads one to treat good men with disesteem. The word Ārta-prapanna 

MEANING OF MĀ SUCHAH 

in nsed here to denote the inan who, in this life, looks upon even Brahua's position of lordship as an obstacle to the perfect enjoy. ment of Bhagavan, who feels that his present association with the body is unbearable as with a raging fire, and who, therefore, cannot endure existence even for a single mondent after the performance of prapatti. He is, therefore, like one who plays, " Be please 182 to make my body and my life-breath perish." Ho is put the arta referred to in the Gjiti (7.16) "Ārilo, jijnisuh, arthurthi, etc.," where urta means "ope who prays for the recovery of his lost wealth or lordship " 

There are some who are of opinion that, in Sui Rana's words:. " Whether 18the man is an ürta (who cinnot bear delay in the attainment of the desired end) or & dripto ( who has no such impatience), the man who seeks refnye should (always ) be protected", there is atividu or exaggeration in that even the dripta who is proul or arrogant is stated to be worthy of protection. Whatever that may be, there is no room for dispute in regard to this passage where mokṣa is provised to the man who grieves for the evils of samsvira but can bear to live till the end of this life and then attain mokṣa, for he is not one who is proud or arrogant, 

The use of the future tense in mokṣayishyāmi (I will release you) is not inappropriate in the case of the ürta who prays for immediate release from the body, for the end desired is to come after the adoption of the upāya and the word is used at the time when the upāya is taught (i.e. before the adoption of the upiya), 

• These classifications into ürias and driptas arise on account of differences in the inteasily of the Lord's grace which are due to the difi'erences in the good deeds performed by them before. 

Such statements as are made in the ślokas -- " The man's who has performed prupatti after learning the truth experiences, 

132. Tiruvoymozhi: 10-7-9 139. 

133. Rāmayana : Yuddhakanda : 18-28. 

558 CHAPTER 

in this life, the consequences of his prārabdha karma alone (i.e.) that karma which has begun to yield its fruit in this life, and there after attains mokṣa" - such statements do not apply to the arta. (Sri Rāmanuja) has described what the driptaprapanna shonld do after the performance of prapatti, in bis gadya, in the passages beginning with:-“ You will be free from all trace of suffering or hindrance caused by the body, the elements (carth, water, fire, etc.,) or the gods "and ending with "Be free from all uncertainty in regard to knowledge concerning me and the vision and the attain vient of myself". 

The freedom from grief that is stated here (in the charanu. vloku) has no limiting factors. Thrrefore the causes of all forms of grief are stated here to be annulled for the man who has a know ledge of this upāya and adopts it. By the teaching given here, mere knowledge (of the upuya) may exist without its adoption, but it would be of no use at all as stated in the śloka. "The song does not regulate (the actions of) the man though he way sing it very often. Creatures behave in accordance with their past impres. sions (vūsana) like the bird\* • Kulinga', which, though it utters the words nii sāhasan kuru, (Do not behave rashly), continues to behave rashly". So in this śloka, it is inuplied that annulment of grief would be the fruit of a combination of both knowledge and action. 

Therefore, here, all grief or despair that might arise in regard to the adoption of the upāya, whether before its adoption or after it, or in the middle of it - all this grief is here (said to be) annulled, 

If it be asked how, the answer is as follows; Despair may arise in many forms ;- (1) in regard to one's competency for the upüya, (2) in regard to (the potency of) the upriya itself, (3) in

regard to the things that the prapanna should do after prapatti, and so also (4) in regard to the end to be attained including the full and perfect service or kainkarya to be rendered. (1) Among them, this dharma called saranagati, which is to be adopted, is not confined to any particular family (jāti) caste or üsrama. Pro. vided there are the desire for attaining the end in view and faith in the upa ya which is the means for that attainment and such things As knowledge of one's being destitute (of other upiyas), there is no reason why any one should despair at the thought that he inay not be competent (to adopt the upriya). 

(2) The (siidhya) upiri ya (prapatti) is capable of being per formed or adopted in a single instant with all its accessories, it is easy of prrformance; it does not need to be repeated; it does not take long to bear fruit; its accessories are not dificult; it is capable of yirlding the desired fruit just at the time when it is desired; therefore to the man who is destitute (of other upāyas ) and who is afraid of delay (in attaining the desired end), there is 00 reason for despair at all thinking that he may have to adopt other apriyas like bhakti, which liave to be practised for 2 long time with all accessories thereof, which are difficult of performince even to those who are very careful and whose acces. sories are also equally difficult to accomplish and which yield the riesired fruit only after a long time, 

The Saviour who is propitiated by this easier upriya and who is to grant the desired end is easily accessible to all, inspires confi dence, is supremely compassionate and is independent and omdi potent without subjection to any one else). Therefore there is no reason why one should despair at the thought of the Siddhopaya (the Gord). 

13) After the performance of this upāya, none of the good deeds that may be done by a man either by say of keeping the commands (of the Lord) or winning Ilis approval is an auxiliary or anga for prapatti. Therefore even if, owing to adverse circum. stances of place and time, !here are short.comings in their perfor. 

560 CHAPTER 

mance, there is no reason for grief or despair at the thought that these shortcomings might adversely affect the accessories (for they are not its accessories ). 

If, in dread of certain sios due to prārabdha karma which render a man absolutely unfit for all karma like a piece of burnt cloth, by causing a inan to offend the great devotees (of God) deliberately, if, in such cases, the man desires at the time of the first prapatti that his actions after prapatti should be free from all such offence or if he perforins a later prapatti for avoiding these offences - if he does these, there is no reason for grief.or sorrow at the thought that offences may happen to be committed in future. Even if, at the time of the first prapatti, one has not prayed for a later life free of all offence, in case offences are committed deliberately, the Saviour of those that have no (other) refuge who stated, "I will never forsake the man who comes to me in the gnise of a friend" will create repentance in his mind, and induce him to perform expiation or prüyaschitta which in this case) is a further prapatti. If the inan is too stubboru to feel repentant, (the Lord) will cause sufferings by way of punishment and thus prevent him from committing further offences. Thus before the time when the attainwent of the desired end is prayed for the expiation will be over, Therefore the prapanna need not feel grieved at the thought that great sufferings like those of hell would come to him as a result of deliberate offences committed by him which flash like lightning and disappear quickly. 

(4) Since the artaprapannu will have the desired end at the very time of performning prapatti, there is no reason why he should feel grieved at the thonght thar ti body which resembles hell would continue, (for the body has been thus described):- " If a man" is fond of his body constituted of flesh, blood, pus, foecal matter, urine, muscle, fat and bone -- then he should be fond also 

of hell".

As for the dripta prapanna : 

All rites or dharmas of renunciation such as karmayoga will never be in vain as stated in the śloka :-- "The beginning that has been made in this karma-yoga will never prove futile. There is no harm in its being left inconiplete; even a fraction of it saves a man from the great fear of saṁsāra" " The foundation that is laid is, as it were, a foundation of stone" and especially with regard to the man who has performed saraṇāgati, it has been stated: "I will never forsake himn.” Further the dripta frapannu is certain of attaining what he desired, though it is delayed until the time specified by himn. So the dripta prapanna has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that the good deed in the forio of prapatti might be counteracted by certain evil deeds which might be thought capable of doing so, as has been said in the śloka “ A yajna ""performed by one loses its effect by untruthfulness, tapas perishes by arrogance, age becomes diminished by contemn. ptuous talk of Brahmios and gifts of charity lose their virtue by their revelation.” since he has prayed for mokslia at the end of this life, he has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that, oning to certain prarabuha karma ( which has begun to yield its fruit), he might have to take another birth. 

Since he is a prapanna for no other object (than mokṣa). all his sins which might act as obstacles will be absolved; therefore he hus no reason to grieve that the supreme end desired by him would suffer delay owing to such lindrances as the enjoyment of big inere disembodied self. 

The Lord intends to say :- “You bave become the recipient of my grace which can cancel the causes of all forms of grief. So if, hereafter, you should entertain grief or despair, it would be as foolish as when you had no grief or despair before performing prapatti, while being subject to punishment by me. This grief or despair is not in keeping with the peculiar potency of this rüya,

with my glory as Siddhopāya who has accepted the responsibility of protecting you and with your state as one who has done what he ought to do by the surrender of all responsibilities to me." In their last moments achūryas teach their good disciples the purport given above of this last sentence, un s'uchali, "Do not grieve", which is the quintessence of the charana-śloka (the last śloka ), 

Among the words of this siloka (charamasloku) are expressed explicitly by the words themselves or suggested implictly by their meaning, the following ideas concerning this upīya :(1) the person who is competent for it, the preliminary condition of being desti. tute (of all other upiyas), the needlessness, for it, of any auxiliary rites which are too difficult to perform, the inappropriateness of trying to perform actions which are beyond one's power, the futility of obstinately attempting to do what is impossible (for one) this upāya being such as will not tolerate (the adoption of any other upāya); (2) the Saviour who alone can be of use to the aspirant for mukti, the Saviour's being perfect and full in such qualities as accessibility and good nature; the Saviour being the teacher of what is most salutary (hita); the end of attainment (viz, the Lord) being Himself the means of attainment; His being capable of acting in all matters without being hindered (by any one) and without the aid of any one else ; His expecting a mere pretext (or vyāja) for protecting (one): His not requiring the intervention of any other upiiya: Ilis being capable of being propitiated without any other anxiliary rites: His being the Saviour who can grant whatevfir fruit is desired; His intol. erance of the acceptance of any other protector; His being ever in the company of Sri lor Lakṣmī !; His capacity for being placed in the position of other upüyas; His readiness to accept the responsibility or burden (of protecting ode); (3) the Sadhyopii ya which is of the nature of the surrender of responsi bility; its ancillaries; its being within the competency of every one; its requiriog to be perforined only once; its being easy of performance; its capacity to bear fruit without delay its being potent enough to andul prörabilha karma; (4) the inan who

A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF THE 

CHARAJA SLOKA:-- 

\*This is the sum and substance of the meaning of the śloka : 

" Your knowledge is limited; your ability is insignificant; your life is short anıl you are also impatient of delay. Therefore do not go about secking other upriyas which you cannot (fully) under stand, which you cannot easily adopt and which can bear fruit only564 CHAPTER 

after much delay. Realise that I who am easy of access to all, who ain the Saviour of all the worlds, and who an endowed with all the attributes essential for x Saviour, am the only upāya and perform the surrender of the responsibility of protecting your self to me with its five singus. When you hilve adopted this upāya, you will have done what you ought to do, you will become my ward and be extremely dear to me. Supremely compassionate and gracious, independent and omnipotent, I will, myself, by my mere will and without any other aid, and for the fulfilment of iny own purposes, free you from the panifold, endless, and insuruountable groups of olsstacles without leaving any 'trace of them. I will enable you to have enjoyments similar to inine own, since you will enjoy myself and all that belongs to me. I will find delight in tuaking you render all forms of service in all places, at all times and in all circumstances — service which will be of the nature of the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyiuent (of myself). You have absolntely no cause for grief." 

SANSKRIT SLOKA :

TAMIL VERSE: 

Giving up those dharmas which have to be performed with extreme care, we were convinced that the true refuge for us is the feet of that Gopala which are fragrant with tulasi and we resorted to them at once. By the gracious and fascinating words of that Supreine Person, we have become free from ignorance so that the karma which has been separated from us can never follow us.
