(13) THE CHAPTER ON THE MAN WHO HAS DONE WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE (I.E.) _PRAPATTI_. page195



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_.

समर्थे सर्वज्ञे सहजसुहृदि स्वीकृतभरे  
यदर्थं कर्तव्यं न पुनरिह यत्किञ्चिदपि नः ।  
नियच्छन्तस्तस्मिन्निरुपधिमहानन्दजलधौ  
कृतार्थीकुर्मः स्वं कृपणमपि कैङ्कर्यधनिनः ॥ ३० ॥



When _Bhagavān_, who is omnipotent, who knows all things and who is, by His nature, full of love for us, has accepted the responsibility (of protecting us ), there is nothing more remaining to be done by us here for it; let us therefore fix our souls in that bundle of supreme bliss and feel the satisfaction (of having attained our object) by becoming rich in rendering service to Him, poor though we may have been before.



THE _PRAPANNA_ HAS DONE WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO



AND HAS ATTAINED HIS GOAL:



(1) The man who has adopted this _upāya_ (_prapatti_) has, from the time when he adopted it, nothing else to do for attaining the fruit thereof. (2) What he had to do has been done by performing _prapatti_ once; (3) (_Bhagavān_) who is independent (of all others), whose will is irresistible and who is the one that rewards us with the fruit (of our actions) says, "Do not grieve ,"[_Carama_ _śloka_] . Owing to these (three) reasons, the _prapanna_ would become care-free at the thought of having surrendered his bhara. The Lord of all who has been accepted as the _upāya_*, which is ever present [_Siddhopāya_ - the _upāya_ which is ever present is _Bhagavān_, for He is always eager to save the _jīva_.] as stated in, "Seek refuge under me alone", has said "I will release Thee from all sins", and since the Lord can (always) be trusted and since He is capable (of acting according to His word), he would have no doubts or fears in regard to the realisation of his object. So he (the _prapanna_) would rejoice at having given up even the slightest trace of other aims or objects and also with having given up other _upāya_s along with _upāya_s which are subsidiary to them. Like a poor man who has received a great treasure with little effort, he would rejoice at the prospect of the supreme goal (of life ) which he is to attain. It has been said: "He who has sought, in every possible manner, the refuge of Nārāyaṇa  who is the Saviour and the _guru_ of the world is not the servant of the gods, of the rishis, of animals, of men and of the pitṛs. He is in no way their debtor". In regard to such _jīva_s (kshetrajnas) as have taken the names of Prajāpati (the Lord of creatures ) and Pasupati (the Lord of beasts, viz. bound souls), he is able, like one whose promissory note registered in the unwritten Vedas under certain conditions (upādhi relating to caste etc.) and requiring service as interest for the principal ( borrowed by him from them) has been fully discharged (torn off).

Therefore when he has to pronounce their names in the performance of *such compulsory and regularly recurrent and occasional rites as the five great yajnas (Panchamaha yajnas), he would realise that these names refer really to _Iśvara_ (_Bhagavān_) etymologically: as has been stated by the sages in passages like :-" Those who worship the pitṛs (the spirits of their fore-fathers), the gods, the Brahmins and Agni - they (in reality) worship only Viṣṇu , who is the Inner Self of all beings." When the king's servants place a garland and a jewel on the coat worn by the king, their object is not to please the coat but to gain the favour of the king.



The same idea has been expressed in such places as the chapter called Yajnagrahara in the Mahābhārata   (Ch. 349 Śānti Parva:"The Great Padmanabha receives the quintessences of all the offerings made in sacrifices" and when the gods asked _Brahma_ who was performing a sacrifice to _Bhagavān_ he replied: "Neither by me nor by any one else who wants to cross the sea of _samsāra_ are you adored with sacrifices. It is only _Bhagavān_ who receives our offerings”)[The idea is that Prajāpati, Pasupati. Agni and others are only like the coat of a king and that, within them, there is the Inner Ruler, Immortal, who alone is Parameśvara or the Supreme Ruler.] and in Hastigiri Māhātmya. In the _Brahma_ _Sūtra_s also (1-2-29), it is said : "Since words like Agni refer directly also to _Brahman_, Jaimini is of the opinion that there is nothing unreasonable in it". Such words as gods and pitṛs have no connection with the coats called gods and pitṛs and by the full significance contained in their parts (i.e.) etymology or derivation, they stand for _Iśvara_ (_Bhagavān_), in the same way as words like Nārāyaṇa  do. In pronouncing such words (Prajāpati, Pasupati, Agni), the _prapanna_ would realise that there is no violation of his sole and exclusive devotion to _Bhagavān_, in the same way as, when the pure Sacrificers (s'uddhayaji) who live in Swetadvipa pronounce the word Nārāyaṇa  (Nārānam ayanam), they do not go against their exclusive devotion to _Bhagavān_ by using the word Nāra. _Bhagavān_ has willed to accept him as His servant to render service in accordance with his _varṇa_, _āśrama_, occasions (like the birth of a child) and qualities (like being a Vaiṣṇava). Therefore by service to Him who is the Ruler and the _śeṣī_-service which consists in obedient performance of His commands and permissions as understood from the _Śāstra_s, the _prapanna_ would do his little bit of service like the freed souls who understand the mind of the Lord by direct perception and be like the muktas; he would be extolled, according to the śāstra s and those who stand by them, as one who, by the completion of the _upāya_ (_prapatti_), has done his duty and who, by the completion of his aim in life, has attained satisfaction.



Śrī _Rāmānuja_ has conclusively described the _prapanna_'s reflection on his satisfactory fulfilment of his duty thus in his _Śaraṇāgati_ _Gadya_ :-"Therefore rest happy in the assurance free from all doubt that you will know me, see me, and attain me As I truly am". This is what it means:-"We were wandering in _samsāra_ owing to _Bhagavān_'s punishment inflicted on us for transgressing His commands from beginningless time. By the compassion of _Bhagavān_ ever waiting for an opportunity (to save us), we came into the reach of the kind glances of our good _ācārya_ s and by repeating after them their utterance of _Dvaya_, we have completed our _prapatti_. There is no further means needed for obtaining the Saviour. Therefore He will pardon (all the sins) which were the cause of the punishment. The Lord of Śrī(Lakṣmī ) who is the _śeṣī_  of all and who is capable of purifying His devotees and obtaining their service, will, for His own glory, protect us. With this faith, the _prapanna_ would be free from all care or anxiety or responsibility." (This is the purport of Śrī_Rāmānuja_'s words in the _Gadya_). This idea is the conclusive meaning which is surely contained also in the Saviour's words "Do not grieve" (in the _carama_ _śloka_).



THE MARKS OF ONE WHO HAS PERFORMED



_PRAPATTI_ :



Since one of the qualifications for the performance of _prapatti_, is sorrow or grief before _prapatti_, if he had no grief before, he would not have the necessary qualification for performing _prapatti_. So by the principle "when there is no cause, there is no effect," his _upāya_ (_prapatti_) will not be effective. If, after the performance of _prapatti_, he grieves owing to want of faith in the words of the Saviour, it would follow by the principle "When the effect is absent, there must have been absence of all the required materials (or causes)" that his _upāya_ is incomplete (owing to want of full faith) and that the benefit or fruit will be delayed inasmuch as it will require the completion of the _upāya_. The man who was formerly full of grief and who is now free from sorrow in accordance with the words" Do not grieve" may be considered to have done what should be done (i.e.) _prapatti_ in the proper manner,



TAMIL VERSE:

मन्नवर् विण्णवर् वानोरिऱैयॊण्ड्रुम् वान्गरुत्तोर्  
अन्नवर् वेळ्वियनैत्तुमुडित्तनरन्बुडैयार्क्-

कॆन्नवरन्दरवॆण्ड्रु नम्मत्तिगिरित्तिरुमाल्  
मुन्नम् वरुन्दि यडैक्कलङ्गॊण्ड नम्मुक्कियरे. (20)

Our spiritual leaders whom the Lord of Śrī that dwells on Hastigiri has taken into His protection after endeavouring for a long time to find out what boon He should confer on those who loved Him. They are like kings and gods (to us), for they have, ever in their minds, the abode of the Lord of the eternal suris and they are like Paramahamsas, because they have completed all rites that have to be performed, (or like swans in their purity or in their capacity to separate the essential from the non-essential).



140 SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:



भगवति हरौ पारं गन्तुं भरन्यसनं कृतं  
परिमितसुखप्राप्त्यै कृत्यं प्रहीणमकृत्यवत् ।  
भवति च वपुर्वृत्तिः पूर्वं कृतैर्नियतक्रमा  
परमिह विभोराज्ञासेतुर्बुधैरनुपाल्यते ॥ ३१ ॥



Bharanyāsa (or the surrender of the responsibility of protection) has been made (at the feet of) _Bhagavān_ (Hari) for reaching beyond _samsāra_. So also actions that can produce only limited pleasures have been given up just like forbidden actions. The sustenance of the body will continue in accordance with past _karma_ (which has begun to operate). So nothing needs to be done for it. Thereafter (i.e) after _prapatti_ the bounds[^54] * imposed by the Lord's command are scrupulously observed by wise men, (merely because it is the Lord's command.)

[^54]:
This means that the _nitya_ and _naimittika_ karmas which are ordained by the Lord in the śāstra s have still to be performed after _prapatti_, as, otherwise, there would be transgression of His command.
