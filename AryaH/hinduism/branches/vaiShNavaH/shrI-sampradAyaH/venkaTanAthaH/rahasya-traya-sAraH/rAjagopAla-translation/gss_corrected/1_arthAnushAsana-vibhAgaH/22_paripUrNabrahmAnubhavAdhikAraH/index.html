<p>Led by his guides (archis and others) to the Lord of Lakṣmī  who is possessed of varied glories in the region beyond tamas (i e.) <em>prakṛti</em> and having attained Him, the <em>mukta</em> has his essential nature in full manifestation and realises his inseparable connection with the Lord and as a consequence, acquires the *eight attributes (of freedom from sin and the like. See page _____) and without any question of his returning again (to <em>samsāra</em> ), he attains, in regard to enjoyment, perfect resemblance to the Lord.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE BLISS OF <em>BRAHMAN</em> :</p>
<p>If it is asked what is this full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> by the <em>mukta</em> who has traversed the path (described before), the answer is as follows:- He will in all places, at all times, and in all situations, have, for his unsurpassed joys, the supreme Ruler with His countless forms, attributes, glories and activities without missing any of them. This is thus described (in the following verse):&ndash; &ldquo;She will never, in the least, miss (the sight of) <em>Bhagavān</em> whose eyes are as beautiful as the lotus and who is the Lord of the world.&rdquo; (Since the Lord enjoys His own forms, attributes, glories and activities Himself), there is perfect similarity between the <em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s enjoyment and the Lord&rsquo;s. Therefore (the <em>śruti</em> s) speak of perfect similarity.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em> is delightful as may be seen from the following passages. &ldquo;He is all knowledge and all bliss&rdquo;. &ldquo;The attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is a remedy for the disease of (<em>samsāra</em>). It is of the nature of joy which is unsurpassed and confers joy on others. It is an end in itself and lasts forever&rdquo;. Other things are enjoyable in this way: If the king is the queen&rsquo;s joy, then all objects and instruments of his enjoyment as well as the places where he finds delight are alike, objects of joy to her. Similarly the <em>mukta</em> finds joy in all that pertains to the Lord. That the Supreme Ruler who has all forms, attributes and the like is an object of enjoyment is evident from the <em>śruti</em> s and the _smṛti_s. This idea has been expressed in the section on Bhima in the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s. The <em>svarūpa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> is called Paramapada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the <em>svarūpa</em> of <em>Bhagavān</em> happens only after reaching a most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or <em>svarūpa</em> of the <em>Jīva</em>, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attributes, <em>jñāna</em> and ānanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three have, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment.</p>
<p>It has been said above that such things as <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s <em>svarūpa</em>, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (<em>nitya</em> vibhūti) which is constituted of pure <em>sattvam</em> and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the <em>mukta</em>. It may be asked, “This may be true. But by sense perception (pratyaksha) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilā <em>vibhūti</em> are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the _śāstra_s also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in <em>līlā</em> vibhūti be objects of delight to the <em>mukta</em> ?&quot; The answer is as follows:&ndash;  There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagreeable to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile has decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set him free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like- pleasures, the prison house may appear agreeable as a symbol of his father&rsquo;s glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : &ndash;&quot; To be with you is <em>mokṣa</em> for me; to be without you is hell to me;&quot; again, &ldquo;To me living without ŚrīRāma, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rākṣasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?&rdquo; In Tiruvoymozi 4-8 it is said :-&ldquo;As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intelligence, my charm, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life.&rdquo; As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (<em>Līlā</em> <em>Vibhūti</em>), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the <em>jīva</em> is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a <em>mukta</em> enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) <em>Bhagavān</em>. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a man bound to <em>samsāra</em>, while to one released from the bondage of <em>karma</em>, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for them by the will of God.</p>
<p>That <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who has, for his <em>prakāra</em> or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Nārāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in <em>Dvaya</em>. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and the _Bhāṣya_kāra has explained it in several places in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> ).</p>
<p>FULL AND PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF BHAGAVĀN</p>
<p>OVERFLOWS INTO <em>KAIÑKARYA</em> OR SERVICE.</p>
<p>( It is said in the _śruti_s that the <em>mukta</em> eats whatever he wants and can create whichever relations he wants). The enjoyment of food in the state of <em>mukti</em> and the contact with relations and the like are not due to <em>karma</em>, whether puṇya or papa, but are dependent only on the will of the <em>mukta</em> which is (always ) in accordance with the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>. Therefore they are not the consequences or fruits of <em>karma</em>, but fall into the category of pure service which is the overflow of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>. Thus the ultimate goal of attainment is the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> which extends also to those services that are desired by the <em>mukta</em>. When this experience has once been attained, it never afterwards ceases and this my be seen from the following passages :</p>
<p>“The place from which the man who has meditated on <em>Brahman</em> never returns- that place is attained by him (the <em>prapanna</em>)&quot;; again, “Those great souls who have attained the highest reach me and are never afterwards born in <em>samsāra</em>, which is the abode of suffering and is ever-ch_aṅgī_ng. All the worlds including that of <em>Brahma</em> are places, O Arjuna, from which souls return to <em>samsāra</em>. But the soul that has attained me, is, O Son of Kunti, never born again.&quot;, and further &ldquo;When the man who has become dissociated from all contact with <em>prakṛti</em> has seen <em>Brahman</em> who is the 26th real, he will never be born again, because he has attained all that has to be attained.&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;The heavenly bodies like the moon and the sun (the presiding deities that govern them) are born again in <em>samsāra</em> (after reaching their high positions). But those who meditate on <em>Bhagavān</em> with the <em>mantra</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> * of twelve syllables never come back to <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>(The same idea is evident also) in: &ldquo;If a man utters the words Namo Nārāyaṇa with hands folded over the head (i.e. performs <em>prapatti</em>) and then goes (by the shining path), he will not be allowed to return to the world of <em>samsāra</em>, even if he furnishes security for his return to <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> &quot; and in other passages like this.(end of page 218)</p>
<p>Even if they come to <em>Līlā</em>-<em>vibhūti</em> (this world of ours) by their own will and pleasure which are of the form of service to the Lord, there will be no diminution of their enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and in this sense there will be no return to <em>samsāra</em>.</p>
<p>As regards these souls that attain this endless enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>, it is not possible to say whether their last body is that of a deva, a man or other creatures. Even such beings as <em>Brahma</em> have to attain <em>mokṣa</em>. So also the great sages say : &ndash; “Even such others as the virtuous hunter who follow gruesome professions attain the goal owing to their practice of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> in their previous birth, as may be seen from the instance of Sramani”</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF BLISS AMONG THE MUKTAS:</p>
<p>The followers of Anandatirtha take into account the superiority or inferiority of _jīva_s in the state of the quest for <em>mukti</em> and maintain that, in accordance with these degrees of merit or demerit (while in the state of seeking <em>mukti</em>), there would be differences in enjoyment even after they have attained <em>mukti</em>. They have forgotten the passages in such authorities as the <em>śruti</em> which speak of perfect equality with the Supreme Being in regard to enjoyment (after release from bondage).</p>
<p>Some hold that, in accordance with defects in the observance of the prescribed code of conduct by the seeker after <em>mukti</em>, there would be diminution in the bliss enjoyed. Even admitting that their words deserve serious consideration as those of trust worthy authorities, they mean only this much that, in the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> which occurs before <em>mukti</em>, there would be degrees of joy. It is true that there may be delay or no delay in attaining release from bondage, but after release is (once) attained, there is no difference at all in the enjoyment of bliss (between muktas and muktas).</p>
<p>Some _jīva_s attain, ia such worlds as those of Viṣṇu , the privilege of living in the same world as Viṣṇu  (sālokya ), some _jīva_s attain proximity to the presence of Viṣṇu  (sāmipya ); some attain forms similar to that of Viṣṇu  (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upacāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following <em>śloka</em>  - &ldquo;Some live in the worlds of Viṣṇu ; others approach very near to Viṣṇu ; others, again, acquire forms resembling <em>Viṣṇu</em>&rsquo;s; yet others attain sayujya with Viṣṇu . This, alone, is called <em>mokṣa</em> .&rdquo; This <em>śloka</em>  declares that only sāyujya in Paramapada is <em>mokṣa</em> . In the same way as a hundred and the like are included within a thousand, sālokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;I do not at all&quot;A beg for <em>mokṣa</em>  which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee.&rdquo; Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the <em>mukta</em>, the object of enjoyment is <em>Brahman</em> with His prakāras or modes. Since <em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em> both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the <em>mukta</em> is called sayuk (with <em>Brahman</em>).</p>
<p>In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the passages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and sārshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be redundant to use two words when one would be enough?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows:</p>
<details open><summary>संस्कृतम् - विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>
<p>सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।<br>
सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥</p>

<p>सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।<br>
सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥</p>
</details>
<p>Sayujyam between the two (<em>Brahman</em> and the <em>mukta</em>) means that there is no difference so far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : sārshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two men may have before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of them may enjoy it more intensely than the other).</p>
<p>It is true that the <em>mukta</em> has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father who cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, <em>Iśvara</em> who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the <em>mukta</em> who only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras has stated at the beginning of the section : &ldquo;(The &lsquo;<em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s enjoyment is ) exclusive of the work of the world&rdquo; and concludes it by saying:&rdquo; The resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the <em>śruti</em> s, and also by inference linga&rdquo;. Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on <em>Brahman</em> say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoyment&quot;.</p>
<p>REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF</p>
<p>IDENTITY:</p>
<p>To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with <em>Brahman</em> (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts in the <em>śruti</em> [ Such śrutis as the following:-<em>Brahman</em> is the eternal among eternals, the sentient among sentients. (1) He is one and satisfies the desires of the many: Svetasvatara Upaniṣad. 2) Without any blemish or stain he attains perfect resemblance (paramam samyam).]  which declare that <em>Brahman</em> is different from the _jīva_s. Besides, their view is opposed also to the _śruti_s which declare that the <em>mukta</em> will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to <em>Brahman</em> and that the <em>mukta</em> will be like <em>Brahman</em>. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- &ldquo;They will attain my likeness (sādharmyam)&rdquo;:</p>
<p>The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasiṣṭa and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - &ldquo;The <em>jīva</em> released from bondage (i.e.) the <em>mukta</em>, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when he reaches Him. Having attained the Omniscient <em>Brahman</em>, he, too, becomes omniscient. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of <em>karma</em>, he, too, becomes free from <em>karma</em>. Having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissful, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by <em>karma</em>), he, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained <em>Bhagavān</em> who is without the qualities (of <em>prakṛti</em>) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached <em>Brahman</em> who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (<em>Prakṛti</em>), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being who is independent of <em>karma</em>, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Having accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asuya), meditate on <em>Brahman</em> who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the passage cited above, the <em>mukta</em> is called &lsquo;independent&rsquo; (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past <em>karma</em>. The _Bhāṣya_kāra (Śrī <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has explained the meaning of the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to <em>karma</em>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thus since in the śrutis, the _smṛti_s and the sūtras, resemblance between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the <em>mukta</em> and <em>Brahman</em> in the state of release from bondage have to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the <em>śruti</em> s which declare difference between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Brahman</em>. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such passages should be construed in the same manner as in the <em>śloka</em>  : &ldquo;The aikyam between Rama and Sugrīva arose O, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self&rsquo;s but of interests).</p>
<p>If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following:&ndash;</p>
<p>(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (<em>Bhagavān</em> who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the <em>jīva</em>&ndash; who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the <em>jīva</em>), good men call them one. The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the <em>jīva</em>, and the <em>jīva</em>, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the <em>jīva</em>, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, O Kasyapa, <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em>, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Puruṣottama</em> is different from both the <em>baddha</em> and <em>mukta</em>. He is called the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>(3) He who is within the <em>jīva</em> as his Inner Ruler &ndash; He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of <em>prakṛti</em>: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Purusha by the Vedas. The consequences of past <em>karma</em> do not cling to Him, in the same way as water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The <em>jīva</em> who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to bondage owing to past <em>karma</em> and attains <em>mokṣa</em>  by meditating on <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(4) &ldquo;Just as fire in a ball of (red-hot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore the perfect resemblance of the <em>jīva</em> (parama samyam) (to <em>Brahman</em>) is only that arising from <em>jñāna</em> and bhoga (enjoyment) and the like. <em>Iśvara</em> has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):&ndash; being the cause of the world, the conferring of <em>mokṣa</em>  on _jīva_s, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the one for whom all things and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one who is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want <em>mokṣa</em> , the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one whose essential nature is omnipresence, <em>Jñāna</em> and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Laksh mi. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The <em>mukta</em>&rsquo;s distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by <em>Iśvara</em>); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (_śeṣa_tva), being atomic (anu) and such others.</p>
<p>THE MUKTA WILL NEVER BE IN <em>SAMSĀRA</em> AGAIN :</p>
<p>If it be so, it may be asked whether the <em>mukta</em>  who is not independent (of God) may not, for some reason or other, incur the possibility of a return to <em>samsāra</em>. The <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s dependence on Iswars has been stated in the <em>śloka</em>  :-“For enabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than <em>Puruṣottama</em> who is competent &lsquo;&rsquo;. The answer to that question is, &ldquo;There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- &ldquo;Those who perform <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> with great devotion and those who have performed <em>prapatti</em> which is considered as a superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain sāyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;. Ever in the state of desire for <em>mukti</em>, the <em>mukta</em> had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentient things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having <em>Brahman</em> as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self as separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyaksha ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to <em>samsāra</em> of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three <em>tattva_s, <em>cit</em>. <em>acit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contraction, there is no possibility of his ever going back to <em>samsāra</em> owing to a_jñāna</em> or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in <em>samsāra</em> deepened into the form of love called <em>bhakti</em> and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific nature of <em>Bhagavān</em> has, now, in the state of <em>mukti</em>, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now a vision of all aspects of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s distinctive nature of which even the śāstra s are incapable. Therefore <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s great love for him as stated in the <em>śloka</em> : &ldquo;The jnanī is dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Omniscient though I am)&rdquo; - <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s love for himna is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connected with him only in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from <em>karma</em>, there is the possibility of his returning to <em>samsāra</em> by the will of <em>Iśvara</em> who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the <em>mukta</em> is no longer subject to the injunctions of śāstra , there is no possibility of his violating the Lord&rsquo;s command in the state of <em>mukti</em>. He cannot do anything opposed to the will of <em>Iśvara</em> as the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called <em>mokṣa</em> , which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> and which extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Considering all this, the Sitra-kāra said: &ldquo;There is no return (to <em>samsāra</em>) - no return, for the Scripture says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>APPENDIX ( Chapter V Page 65 )</p>
<p>THE VISĀKHASTAMBHA AS DESCRIBED IN THE SATVATA SAMHITĀ AND</p>
<p>THE <em>LAKṣMĪ</em>  TANTRA.</p>
<p>In the region of eternal glory (<em>nitya</em> <em>vibhūti</em>), there is a huge column constituted of _śuddhasattva_m. It is a special form in which <em>Bhagavān</em> appears there. This column or pillar is called Visakha yoopa. The column consists of four parts called, respectively, jāgrat, (the waking state ), svapna (the dream ), <em>suṣupti</em> (dreamless sleep) and turīya (the fourth stage, counting from below upwards). In the part called jāgratsthana, which is somewhere above the base of the column, there are four divine forms on the four sides called, respectively, <em>Vāsudeva</em>, <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em>, Pradyumna and Aniruddha facing the east, the south the west and the north and shining like branches around that part of the column. This collection of four forms is called Jāgratvyuha. The activity of this vynha is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. The four forms are bright in colours, white, red and the like. They have also arms or weapons. Above this part of the column is the part called svapnasthāna. Here, too, there are four divine forms <em>Vāsudeva</em>, Sankarshna, Pradyumna and Aniruddha shining like branches, as before, to the east, the south, the west and the north. This collection of four vyuhas in the second part of the column from below is called svapnavyuha. These four forms have no activities like creation and maintenance, but have only the will to do so. Their colours, too, are not so bright as those of the lower <em>vyūha</em>. They have weapons but no banners and other accessories. Above the svapnasthana, which is the second part from below, is the third part or sthāna called sushuptisthāna. Here too there are four divine forms with the same aan es as in the two other parts already described and in the same order. This collection of four forms is called sushuptivyuha. These forms have neither activities nor even the will or the desire to act. They have just the experience of their owa bliss and nothing else. In the form of <em>Vāsudeva</em> which is like å branch of the column shooting on the eastern side, there is no such thing as a body with limbs and the like and it shines with all the six qualities. The other three forms, <em>Saṅkarṣaṇa</em> and the like on the other three sides have a body with hands, feet and the like. But they have no weapons; on the palms they bear lines resembling the conch, and the weapons. These forms have no colours. The uppermost or fourth part of the column (Turīya sthāna) has also similar four forms with the same names as in the former parts. This collection of four is the Turīya vyūha. They have no bodies with limbs and the like but resemble the <em>Vāsudeva</em> form of the <em>suṣupti</em> <em>vyūha</em>. They have no activities, no will, no weapons and no lines on the palm resembling arms. All the six qualities shine in the form called <em>Vāsudeva</em> and the other three have, each, only two of these qualities. The names jāgrat, svapna, <em>suṣupti</em> and turīya are given to them on the analogy of these states in man in the ordinary world, according to the greater or the lesser activity found in each. The turīya state is like that in a swoon when even the breath is suspended, whereas in the <em>suṣupti</em> state, the man just breathes in or breathes out; in the svapna, his external senses cease to act, only the mind is active, in the jāgrat state, both the mind and the external senses act.</p>
<p>These four parts with four vyūhas in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them. On the lowest stage of meditation, there is no full control of the external senses and the mind; in the second stage of development, control of the external senses has been attained but not of the mind; in the next stage, the mind, too, has been controlled and the man who meditates is seen just breathing in and breathing out with no other activity or sign of life; in the last or perfect development of meditation, he is like one in a swoon, not even breathing in or out:</p>
