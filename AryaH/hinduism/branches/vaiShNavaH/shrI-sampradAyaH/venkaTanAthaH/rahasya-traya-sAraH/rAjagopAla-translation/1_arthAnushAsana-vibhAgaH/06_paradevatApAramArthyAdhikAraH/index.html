<li>THE CHAPTER ON THE TRUTH CONCERNING</li>
</ol>
<p>THE SUPREME DEITY.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>Those who are not proficient in the Sastras say that there is only a single self, that all deities (like Indra, Agni and so on) are only one, that the three deities (Brahma, Vishnu and Siva), when properly understood, are alike and of equal rank, that these three deities are only one deity (in three forms) and that the Supreme Deity is other than these three and hold other such (erroneous) views, but those who bave discrimination entertain no regard for these (divergent views). The Upanishads, with one voice, and so also Mana, Vyasa and others, following the Upanishads, proclaim that Sriman Narayana is our Lord who has all (things and beings) for His body, that He (alone) can give mukti and that He is the object of blissful enjoyment for those who have attained moksha,</p>
<p>WHY SHOULD WE DETERMINE WHO THE</p>
<p>SUPREME DEITY IS:</p>
<p>All &lsquo;reals&rsquo; have been classified into matter ( Prakriti), the individual self and the Supreme Self or Iswara on the basis of the differences among them pointed out before. (From a knowledge of this classification alone), it is not possible to attain supreme devo tion to a single deity to the exclusion of all others, unless the truth as to who is the Supreme Deity has been gacertained as in the words of the Alwar: &ldquo;She will not worship any god other than Bhagavan por dream of any such god&rdquo;. Further, to no one but the exclusive devotee of the Supreme Deity, is moksha possible of attainment without delay. So it is necessary to decide who is the Supreme Deity.</p>
<p>CRITICISM OF ERRONEOUS VIEWS:</p>
<p>In this context, the view that all things and beings) are the substance of Brahman cannot be accepted, since sentient and non</p>
<p>ON THE SUPREME DEITY,</p>
<p>sentient things are kaowa by the pramāņas.to be entirely different from one another. In the same way, the essential differences beton ween the jīva and Iswara cannot be ignored (and they disprove the view that they are one). Similarly the mutual differences among the gods are based on the pramūņas, because of their 8880. ciation with varied pleasures aod pains. Therefore, though the indwelling Supreme Self, Antaryāmin is one, the view that Brabma, Rudra, and the other gods are not different from Iswara and from one another cannot be justified.</p>
<p>BRAHMĀ, RUDRA AND OTHERS ARE</p>
<p>CREATED BEINGS:</p>
<p>Those who are considered as the chief among these gods, namely, Brahma, Rudra, Indra and others are created beings subject to the law of karma, as can be proved by pramāņas. It has been said, &ldquo;When &lsquo;all individual beings and even the aggregate jiva (Samashti) have gone into dissolution and when mahat has become merged into prakriti (from which it evolved), there is one remaining as the soul of the universe and He is the Lord Narayana.&rdquo; Again it is said, “The god Narayana is at the beginning; from Him arises Brahma&quot;, &ldquo;Narayana is the Supreme Deity; From Him was born Brahma, the four-faced, and from Brabma arose Rudra, 0 goddess &ldquo;, and further, it is stated, &ldquo;Then you, &ldquo;the irresistible, assumed the form of Visbou from that eternal existence (viz. Narayana) for the protection of all beings.&rdquo; From this it is clear that, by his own will, He incarnated as the middle one (i.e. Vishnu) of the Trinity. He who is expressed by the names, Visbau and Narayana, iş stated to have been the ultimate cause of the world in His previous and original state. It is</p>

<p>74 CHAPTER</p>
<p>also said elsewhere, &quot; There is no &ldquo;being in the world that is eternal, either among those that move or among those that do not move, except that one Primaeval Purusha called Vasudeva.&rdquo; This declares that He alone is eternal. Therefore, other views such as the following: &ldquo;The gods of the trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva), are of equal greatness&rdquo;; &ldquo;The three gods of the Trinity are only one&rdquo;, &ldquo;Iswara is above and beyond the Trinity&rdquo; &ldquo;Either Brabma or Rudra among the Trinity is the Sapreme Lord &ldquo;-these views stating equality, identity, the exis. tence of an entity superior to all the three of the Trinity and the supremacy of a different member of the Trinity, are against the pramāņas. That Brahma, Radra, and the like are created beings subject to karma may be seen in the following passages :-&rdquo; Theo purusha or person created by Him (Narayana) is called Brahma in the world&rdquo;. &ldquo;Having &lsquo;caused the dissolution of the worlds before, you lay on the waters of the great ocean and created me at first by your Māya (will).&rdquo;, &quot; Brahma&rsquo;s name is Ka and I, Isa role over all embodied beings. We two were born from your limbs. Therefore you are called Kesava (Ka and Isa)&rdquo; Further Brahma says, &ldquo;I was born from His graciousness for some reason and you, from His wrath, for some other reason, in one of the earlier creations.&rdquo; The very words of these rival gods, which are, so to say, a deed of release written with their own hands, declare this truth. That Brahma and Radrs are subject to karma and attained their high status, because of having worshipped the Lord of all with special rites, may be seen from the following pags ages : &ndash; &ldquo;All the gods sacrifice to Vasudeva and all the gods bow to Vasudeva.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahma, &ldquo;Rudra and Indra, together with all other gods and the great rishis worship the divine Narayana or Hari, the greatest of Gods &ldquo;, &quot; Meditating constantly on the</p>

<p>ON THE SUPREME DEITY</p>
<p>Lord, Brahma, Isana (Rudra) and others have not yet attained to # realisation of His nature. It is He whose protection I seek.&rdquo; And Brahma says :- &quot; Having created me in the divine lotus in your navel sbining like the sun, you have assigned to me all the duties of creation (of Prajapati) and with this burden imposed on me, I worship you, the Lord of the Universe.&rdquo; And in another place, we find the following :- &ldquo;Brahma, &ldquo;born of the lotus, bav. ing worshipped Vishou for thousands of crores of yugas, obtained again the position of the creator of the three worlds. This is what we have heard.&rdquo; So also it is said :-&rdquo; 18 Mahadeva (Rudra), who is called Viswaropa, sacrificed all things in a great yajna called Sarvamedha and then sacrificed himself also mentally&rdquo;, &ldquo;Maha. deva sacrificed himself in the Sarvamedha and became the god of gode. The føresplendent Rudra, clad in the skin of the elephant, reaches all the worlds with his knowledge and shines with his fame&rdquo;. &ldquo;Since in this &ldquo;great sacrifice, he gave me my share of the offering, he has been authorised by me, in the Vedas and the Sutras, as fit to receive his share of the offerings.&rdquo; These gods, Brahma, Rudra and others are dependent upon the Maya of Bhagavad ((i.e.) Prakriti) epd are subject to the influence of the gunas (satvan, rajas and tamas). Their knowledge is also sub. ject to contraction and expansion. All this may be understood from the incidents of the loss of the Vedas and others and also from the following sloka :-&ldquo;All the 17A gods beginning with Brahma, all men, and all animals are enveloped by the dense darkness of delusion arising from the whirlwind of Vishnu&rsquo;s Maya (Prakriti),&rdquo; &ldquo;The wise say that &rsquo;these (positions) are the rewards of those who follow the good path of Satva, namely, Brahma and the other creators, and the deities presiding over dkarma, makat and avyaktam&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE OTHER GODS ARE THE SERVANTS</p>
<p>OF BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>That these (Brahma and Rudra) render service to the Lord, who is their inner self, with the help of the knowledge given to them by Him may be seen from the following sloka : &ldquo;These two &ldquo;, who are the greatest among the gods, are considered to have been born (respectively) out of His (Bhagavan&rsquo;s) graciousness and wrath; and they perform the duties of creation and destruc tion in accordance with the lines laid down by Him.&rdquo; They are not pure and are not objects for spiritual meditation (subhasraya), for it has been said: &ldquo;Bhagavan **Hiranyagarbha (Brahma), Vasava (Indra) and Prajapati &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; all these gods and others are impure, their births being due to past karma&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;From Brahma&rsquo;l to the blade of grass, all beings that have their existence in the world have had their births as the result of karma and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths ( samsāra)&rdquo; and further, “The man who has no attacbment (to the things of this world) should koow that every being including Brahma is impure as being tainted by the ripening of karma &ndash; to Him, Vasudeva alone is the Supreme Goal or refuge.&rdquo; These statements have been made by Parasara, Sounaka, Suka and others. Brabma, Rudra and others have to seek Bhagavan&rsquo;s protection and Bhaga van has to seek no body else&rsquo;s protection. This is clear from His own words :&ldquo;The godses are under the protection of Rudra, O King, and Rudra is under the protection of Brahma. Brahma is under my protection and I do not seek the protection of any one. There is no one that I need for my protection, for I am the refuge of all.&rdquo; These gods are among the great possessions (vibhuti) of Bhagavan, who is the Lord of both tilāvibhuti and nitya-vibhūti,) &mdash; for it is said, “Brabma&rdquo; Daksha and others, Kala,</p>

</ol>
<p>ON THE SUPREME DEITY:</p>
<p>Rudra and the destroyer of Kala - all these are among the vibhutis of Bhagavan,&rdquo; where Brabma and Rudra are spoken of as being on the same footing as Daksha and others.</p>
<p>THE OTHER GODS ARE THE PRAKĀRAS OR</p>
<p>MODES OF BHAGAVAN.</p>
<p>These gods (Brahma, Rudra etc.) are others like the modes or prakāras of the Lord of all who has all things as Hja body. This is clear from the grammatical apposition or co-ordi. nation (sāmānādkikaranya) in which they are used, just like other substances, in connection with such words as Narayana. (For example it is said that Rudra is Narayana, Brahma is Narayana, the earth is Narayana and so on.)</p>
<p>That these are His bodies and that He is their inner self or goal is evident from these words of Brahma to Rudra :- &ldquo;He is* the inner self of you, of me and of all those who are called embo died beings. He sees all but cannot be apprehended by any one, anywhere.&rdquo; These are s&rsquo;eshas who exist solely for the fulfilment of His purposes and He is their s&rsquo;eshi. This truth was expressed by the all-knowing Rudra himself in Mantrarājapadastotra, where he says, &ldquo;Al beings are, by their nature, the servants of the Supreme Self. Therefore I am also Thy servant and, with this knowledge, I bow to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BHAGAVĀN HAS NEITHER EQUALS NOR SUPERIORS :</p>
<p>Thus Narayana is destitute, in every way, of equals and superiors. This may be seen from the following slokas :- &ldquo;O best* of men, there is no one superior to (Narayana ) the god of the lotus-like eyes;&rdquo; &ldquo;There was no one superior to Him in the past nor will there be any one superior to Him in the future : “There is not god superior to Vishnu, O best of kings; &quot; &ldquo;There is sting</p>

<p>nothing more auspicious thao Vasudeva, there is nothing more pari fying than Vasudeva. There is no greater divinity than Vasudeva. No one who adores Vasudeva ever perisbes.&rdquo; &ldquo;In all the three worlds, there was no one like Him ever born and there will be no one like Him born in the future.&rdquo; &quot; There is no divinity higher than Kesaya.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the ** King of all kings, Vishnu, the great Brabman. We know Him to be Iswara. He is the Father, the Creator.&rdquo; Those who are lucky, even while in their mother&rsquo;s womb and have received, while in the state of being born, the glance of Madhusudana will become desirous of moksha; for His glance dispels rajas and tamas. Those who are looked at by Brahma and Rudra just before birth will become subject to the influence of rajas and tamas. This difference is brought out in the following passages - &ldquo;He who is looked at by Madhusudana just as he is being born should be considered to a pure soul (sātvika) and he will ever think of the goal of moksha. Jf, on the other hand, a person is looked at immediately at birth by Brabms or Rudra, his mind will be overcome by rajas and tamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE ASPIRANT FOR MUKTI SHOULD WORSHIP</p>
<p>ONLY BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>That these gods are not to be worshipped by those who desire moksha (and that Narayana, the Lord of all, who is the cause of these gods, is alone the deity to be worshipped by all those who desire moksha, including these gods) may be seen from the follow ing slokas :- &ldquo;To those who are sunk in the sea of samsāra and whose minds are overpowered by the objects of sense plea sures, there is no other refuge than the ship of Vishnu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who have a disoriminating intelligence never worship Brahma, or Rudra or any of the other gods, for the fruit of their worship</p>

<p>is very limited,” “Hari alone is fit to be meditated upon, O Brabmins, by you who are noted for your satvam. He is always to be adored and I am the means for en. abling you to remember Hari.” If, in some places, these gods are spoken of as assisting in the attainment of moksha, it should be understood to mean that they, like Acharyas, assist by imparting knowledge and in such other ways. This is also the purport of the following passage ; &quot; The man who is a devotee of the god of the sun (Surya) will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Rudra by the Sun&rsquo;s grace. He who ia a devotee of Sankara will, after seven more births, become a devotee of Vishnu by the grace of Sankara.&rdquo; And again :&mdash; &ldquo;He who is &amp; devotee of Vasudeva will, after those seven births, become one with Vasudeva by His grace.&rdquo; In this context it has to be stated that devotion to Sarya and others leads gradually to devotion to Bhagavan, only in the case of those who are not subject to mental delusions about the Supreme Self and the Self&rsquo;s that are below it - such delusions de holding that they are all one or that the lower self is the Sapreme Self or that all these divinities are of equal power, and provided they are pot filled with the hatred natural to the asuric or demoniac Dature. This is evident from the sloka : &ldquo;Those who* hold Parushottama as being similar to the other deities are to be con sidered heretics unfit for any kind of karma or rite.&rdquo; People who have such delusions in their knowledge (and worsbip) will meet with defeat due to the panishment inflicted by Bhagavan, although they have devotion to other deities. From the following sloka : &ldquo;O mighty Radra, get Sāstras of delading import composed and by prompting men to slight effort, show the fruit of these actions as soon as possible&rdquo;-froin this sloka, we may infer that, if there is success in achieving tangible fruits by following these false sastras, it is only for making men fall into delusion and thence into hell.</p>
<p>If Bhagavan, whose will is irresistible, decides that some one deserves His punisbment, then that person will find no other god</p>

<p>capable of protecting him. It is said in the Rāmāyana &ldquo;If a man has t&rsquo;deserved death at the hands of Rama, neither the four-faced Brahma, who was born of no mortal, nor the three-eyed Rudra who destroyed Tripura, nor the great Indra, who is the leader of the gods, will be able to shield him in battle.&rdquo; If, on the other hand, a man seeks refuge under Bhagavan, even if all the gods and intimate friends of His, like Sugriva, the great king, propose to injure him, Iswara will protect him by over-coming wicked men like Ravana who should be overcome, and helping, by persuasion, such good people as the leaders of the monkeys who bad spoken against Vibbishana, as they deserve that course. For has he not said :-&ldquo;To him who has sought my protection even once and begged of me saying, &ldquo;I am thine&rdquo; &ndash; to him I afford protection from all beings. This is my vow&rdquo; and is He not one who ever keeps bis word and sees that His vows do not fail ?</p>
<p>THE BOONS GRANTED BY OTHER DEITIES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GRACE OF BHAGAVĀN.</p>
<p>If men seek the favour of other gods, they will soon obtain minor rewards which are like poison mixed with honey, for it is said, “Those who desire the fruits of karma or rites perform sacrifices to the gods and obtain the rewards of their actions in the world of men very soon.&rdquo; And again :- &quot; From thema&rdquo; they obtain the objects of their desire as ordained by myself&quot;. The Lord said to the gods :&ndash; &ldquo;This Brahma&rdquo; is your father and mother and grandfather, and will, under instructions from me, grant boons to all beings, and Rudra, his younger brother, who had bis origio in my forehead, will, under instructions from Brahma, grant boods to all beings&quot; As stated in these passages, these are dependent upon Bhagavan. It is said :&ndash; &ldquo;The rewards (obtained from these deities) are of</p>

<p>a very limited nature; &quot; &quot; In kalpas or ages when satva is pre. dominant, Hari&rsquo;s glory becomes great and, only in them, those who have successfully practised yoga in accordance with the sāstras will attain the supreme goal.&rdquo; Therefore, from these other deities, moksha cannot be attained even after a length of time. From the Lord of all, on the other hand, a man obtains unsurpassed wealth and the like, even as Brahma attained his high position after wor® shipping Vishnu for crores of thousands of yugas; and afterwards, like the man who bathes in the Ganga for physical refreshment and thereby obtains purification also from all his sins, he gets inci dentally freedom from sins; his rajas apd tamas decline and his satuam becomes dominant and, in course of time, he will attain moksha like Janaka, Ambarisha, Kekaya and others. But there is delay in such cases as may be seen in the following passages : &ldquo;At the 48A end of many virtuous lives, the man attains spiritual wisdom and seeks my proteotion” and again, &quot; Those who have attained success in crores of births will at length become well established here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who have, in many thousands of lives, become purified of their sins by penance, meditation and yoga (samadhi) will acquire devotion to Krishna,&rdquo; When the desire for moksha has become ardent and when the man practiges 80 upāya which is within his power, there will be no delay in the attainment of moksha, for He has declared : &ldquo;To those who have fixed their minds on me - to them I become the redeemer and save them quickly out of the sea of samsāra&rdquo;. To him who adopts prapatti as the independent means, there is neither delay nor absence of delay, except in accordance with his own desire These distinctions will be accepted by all who have regard for the pramānas and they have their effect by the will of Iswara which cannot be questioned, for has it not been said, &quot; The lordship of Iswara is absolutely independent and brooks no questioning ?&quot; To</p>

<p>those who do not clearly vaderstand these principles in this way, the worship of other deities is prescribed in such passages as the following: &ldquo;They may &ldquo;be worshipped by men other than those who have discriminating intelligence,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who worship these other deities without knowing that they are the bodies of Bhagavad are like a follower of Charvaka (a materialist who believes that there is nothing other than the body called the soul) who anoints the body of the king, his master, without knowing that his master has a soul. It is true that the soul of the king is pleased with the service done to his body. In the Bame way, A8 &amp; matter of fact, the devotion to these other deities is really the worsbip of Bhagavan, 88 they are only His bodies. Notwithstanding this, the fruit of this devotion to the lower deities would be only partial and incomplete. (We may remember in this connection the sloka in the Gita) which says:- &quot; Those who sacrifice with faith and earnestness to other deities &ndash; they, too, sacrifice only to me, but not in the manner and according to the rules prescribed for it.&rdquo; Since the rite is perfornied in an irregular manner without the observance of all the rules, the fruit will be partial and incomplete, If, on the other band, a man, knowing that these other gods are only the bodies of Bhagavan, offers wor ship to them owing to a special desire for obtaining quickly the smaller goods of life, the fruit will be fully and completely realised in perfect measure.</p>
<p>The Gita thas speaks of those who approach Bhagavan for minor fruits :-&quot; The man&quot; who has lost his wealth but seeks to re cover it, the man who wants to enjoy his own soul, and the man who wants to acquire prosperity” All these will have their reward in even greater measure.&quot; Of those who adore Bhagavad without any such desire for minor fruits and only for the sake of moksha, it is said, &ldquo;Hari&rdquo;, who confers moksha, gives to His worshippers who meditate on Him, health of body, wealth, and enjoymente, in</p>

<p>addition to what they desire vis., moksha&quot;. These are, so to say, adventitious or incidental rewards (ānushangika ) aot sought by them. Sri Kulasekhara Perumsl, to whom such adventitious prosperity was vouchsafed, says in this connection:-&ldquo;The 56A man who desires only Thee and does not seek great prosperity - pros perity comes and seeks him.&rdquo; Isandan also has stated this in his stotra thus &ldquo;Those enjoyments which were formerly desired but could not be obtained come to us, of their own accord, without any effort or exertion on our part, like rivers flowing into the ocean, (although we do not desire them now).&rdquo; (It may be asked why all those who desire only moksha are not blessed with the good things of this life ). (The answer is):- This is dae to the special form of meditation or vidyā practised by the devotee and the special desires of his earlier life. (Some. vidyās secure worldly prosperity in addition to moksha after death, while others secure only moksha.)</p>
<p>The Alwars, too, have spoken of these differences between the Lord of all on one side and Brahma, Rudra and the other gods on the other side, in passages such as the following: “The gods* are only the food eaten by Bhagavan and vomited afterwards, (eaten during pralaya and vomited after creation); are there any (gods) who are not of the nature of this vomit?&quot; &ldquo;Narayana **created the god with four faces, and the god with four faces cre ated Sankara.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou&rdquo; that art the original bulb of the lotus of the navel, from which arose Brahma, Siva, Indra and the others who worship you with reverence.” “ Arjuna &ldquo;saw on Siva&rsquo;s head, the flowers of the garland that he had placed at the feet of the holy Bhagavan which had measured the whole world, and anderstood clearly that Sri Krishna was the Supreme Deity Wearing garland of green tulasi.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indra“ who rules over the gode, Brahma the god with four faces, and the great Siva with his matted locks of hair - (all these) meditate with earnestness and</p>

<p>sincerity on His lotus-like feet and go about praising Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He alone&rdquo; is the Lord of Siva who is spoken of in high terms, of Brahma and of all others.&quot; &ldquo;O Lord whose glory cannot be adequately understood even by him who rides on the unique bull and by Brahma,&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;Neither the god who has the ball for his banner, viz. Siva aor Brahma, nor Indra nor any other knows the remedy for the disease called &quot; birth&rdquo; (i.e.) samsāra.&quot;</p>
<p>This truth about Bhagavan being the Supreme Deity should be considered as present in the first letter a of aum in Tirumantra and in the word Nārāyana therein and in the word Narayana occurring in Duayam along with its attribute Sriman (along with Sri or Lakshmi) and likewise in the words &lsquo;me&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; occurring in the Charama Sloka.</p>
<p>For men other than those who have this conviction about the Supreme Deity, it is not possible to be in the state of having Bhagavan alone exclusively as their protector, a state such as is described in the following and other words of the Alwars: &ldquo;There is 68 no refuge other than Krishda&rdquo;. &ldquo;Whether you * weed out my suffering or whether you do not weed it out, I have no other means of getting it removed.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know of no other staff of support for my soul&rdquo;. (We may see also) the ten stanzas beginning with: “If you do not withbold the suffering due to my karma&quot;, The Alwar* who learnt all spiritual truths directly from the Lord of all discerned the truth about the Supreme Deity in Tirumantra, gave up all devotion to other deities and became well established in exclusive devotion to Bhagavan, which extends to His devotees and also in rendering exclusive service to the Lord and His devotees. He gives expression to this in the following verse. &ldquo;I cannot eo live in agreement with those who</p>

<p>hold that there is any other deity (than the Lord); I have also obtained the privilege of rendering service to Thy devotees.&rdquo; In the verse beginning with &ldquo;The earth, water, fire, air, ether&ndash;having created these,&rdquo; the Alwar places (before himself) the three gods concerned in this controversy and, after a consideration of pramānas, ignores two of them and decides on the remaining deity who is Sapreme Light&quot;: &ldquo;as His god having a complexion resembling that of a cloud.&rdquo; Perialwar also declares in the follow ing verse that the deity who is of this form and complexion is the Supreme Reality (Tatva) described in all the Vedas ; &ldquo;If &ldquo;you &ldquo;meditate on the god who is of the colour of the ocean by attering the origin of all Veda, namely, the syllable aum with three mātras (metrical units) etc. etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having in mind the passage in Taittiriya which describes the Supreme Deity as being the Lord of Lakshmi, the Alwar under stands that this description excludes other gods and exclaims:-&ldquo;I have seen Lakshmi and the form of the Lord shining like gold on which she rests.&rdquo; Beginning with this verse he concludes with the statement that &quot; for wise men it is only Bhagavan who ever acts in conjunction with Lakshmi that is both refuge and goal.&rdquo; This be declares in the following verse :- &ldquo;Our refaget is the goddess residing in the beautiful lotus covered with honey, who bas long eyes and sbines with a splendour which throws into the shade the lightning seated in the black cloud and who fascinates (with her beauty) the God armed with the discus and wearing the garland of tulasi on his broad chest.&rdquo; The conclusion has been arrived at that this couple (Bhagavan and Sri) are our goal of attainment and our refuge.</p>
<p>This truth regarding the Supreme Deity was taught at great length by the great sage, Parasara, to his worthy disciple who was fit to receive the great spiritual secrets, in the following sloka -</p>

<p>“Io all beings, gods, men and animals, all that is masculine is Bhagavan, Hari, and all that is feminine is Laksbmi, O Maitreya, and there is no one other than they,&rdquo; Tbis sage, Parasara, obtained the knowledge concerning the Supreme Deity by the grace of Pulastya and Vasishta who gave him this boop :-&ldquo;You will&rdquo; understand the truth about the Supreme Deity.&quot; &ldquo;What Was?&rdquo; said to you by Pulastya will certainly become true.&quot; Our great Acharya, Sri Yamunamudi, also speaks of Parasara with the greatest regard in &lsquo;I bow to Parasara, the best of sages.&quot; And Nammalwar, who received the gift of knowledge free from all delusion and bhakti from Bhagavan and who occupies the highest place in the line of those who have performed prapatti, has stated the same truth (namely, that Lakshmi should also be considered along with Bhagavad as our refuge and our goal): &ldquo;You have 78 epabled me to have a vision of Thyself and Thy consort (Lakshmi) with the sbining bracelets, standing together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We bave already stated all that should be said in this connec tion in our commentary on The Four Slokas (of Yamunacharya) with a refutation of the views of opponents and refer the reader to the same.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Our Acharyas have proclaiped, in so uncertain terms, that our eternal Lord with His Consort seated on the lotus is the Supreme Deity, so that disputants, proud of their knowledge of reasoning and argumentation, may not, each according to his own will, declare that the ultimate cause is this or that (Brahma, Rudra or Indra) thus causing dread to the Vedas* and trepidation to all devotees. 74.
