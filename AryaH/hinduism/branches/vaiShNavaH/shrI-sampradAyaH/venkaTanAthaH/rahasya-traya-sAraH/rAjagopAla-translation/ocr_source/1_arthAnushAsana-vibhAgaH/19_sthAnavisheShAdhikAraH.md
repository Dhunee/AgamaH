(19) THE CHAPTER ON THE PLACES SUITABLE 

FOR THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRAPANNA. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The place where it is possible to concentrate all one's attention on such things as service at the feet of Bhagavan and His adorit tion, or the place where one can find some one or other whose wind is exclusively and staunchly fixed on Bhagavan - that is the place of abode for prapannās as it is almost equal to Vaikunta. Many places that have been prescribed (for abode ) by the sages gene rally have this fitness (in these two respects). 

THE PLACE SUITED TO THE RESIDENCE OF 

THE PRAPANNA: 

As an end in itself, the prapanna is desirous and eager to live, the rest of his life in a manner that would be inoffensive and agreeable to the Lord. He is exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord as described in the sloka :-- The 'devotee who is exclusively attached to Bhagavan is not to be described or desig Dated as belonging to a certain village or a certain family, but as belonging to Bhagavan, for Bhagavan alone is everything to him. 

THE PLACES INHABITED BY BHAGAVATĀS ARE 

THE MOST SUITABLE. 

If it be asked what is the proper place for his residence, the answer is as follows:- Holy regions like Aryavarta bave now, owing to the nature of the Yuga (Kali) become unfit for abode, owing to the rites of varna and asrama getting mingled. There fore the proper place for residence at present is any place where the practice of the dharmu of the four varnas is well established. Even among these places, those regions which are. inbabited by Bhagavatas are to be chosen by (the prapanna) desirous of moksha. It has been said :-"What 'austerities must they have

practised (in their past lives) - they who live in places where there are devotees that adore, with folded hands, Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, who has a complexion similar to that of a black cloud, and that look upon Hiin as their protector ?" Though it is stated " In Kali, O, 2A Maitreya, men deluded by heretics will not adore Visbnu, the Lord of the World, the Ruler who created all things", we are also told about places where Bhagavatas live in Kali Yuga : " In Kali 'Yuga, there will be born, here and there, noble souls who consider that Narayana is the supreme object of attainment. They will be born in numbers in Tamil Nad on the banks of the Tamraparni, of the Kritamala, of the Palar, of the renowned Cauvery and of the river which flows westwards and again : "Those who drink the waters of these rivers, O, king, become pure ia mind and greatly devoted to Bhagavan who is called Vasudeva". As stated in these passages, it is these places inhabited by Bhagavatās, that are suitable for the residence of the prapanna in this Kali Yuga. In Sri Narayaniya the devas and the rishis said, "When & dharma stands on & single leg ready to go elsewhere, how are we to live, O Lord? Please tell us this”, Bhagavan replied as follows: "You should live in places where gurus of good character and possessed of self-control are held in reverence and where dharma has not undergone any deterioration. The places which should be chosen by you, O best of devotees, are those where flourish the Vedas, yajņas, austerities (tapas), truth, control of the senses and the slaughter of animals only for the sake of dharma (sacrifices). Adharma will not touch you with its foot". 

THE HOLY PLACES WHERE BHAGAVĀN IS WORSHIPPED IN TEMPLES ARE 

SPECIALLY SUITABLE: Among them, the boly places where Bhagavan has chosen to be present as archā would be proper for the prapannas' 2A. Vishnupurana: 6-1-50

residence. He should live permanently in one among them which is suitable for his service to the Lord). As an example of holy places where satva is predominant, Srirangam is indicated in the following passage . "Until the 'fall of the body, live in peace here in Srirangam itself." That only the holy places of Bhagavan are suitable for the residence of the wise man has been stated by the great sage (Vyasa) in the context of the places of pilgrimage in Āranya Parva, thus :- "The place where the Supreme Being, the God Narayana who is eternal, dwells -- that is sacred; that is most holy; that is the place of the sacred water that purifies; that is the place fit for austerities; that is the place where the divine seers and the siddhas and all others perform penance", and (in another context) elsewhere, we find -" There is a mountain called Gomanta, 0, king, which is full of all the minerals. On that mountain dwells the lotus-eyed Lord Narayana, the Lord of Lakshmi, who is sung in hymas (there) by those who desire moksha." Bhagavan Valmiki also has stated :- “This mountain, Chitrakuta, which resembles Himavan, the king of mountains, is possessed of glory, for Sri Rāma born of the race of Kakustha dwells on it like Kubera in Nandana." The word subhaga in this siloka refers to the glory of that mountain as one to be visited for having been the residence of Bhagavad. In the Satvata Sastras also, the holy places where there are the spontaneous inanifestations of Bhagavan, those that were established by siddhās and those founded by devotees and the degrees of sanctity attached to them are described separately and it is also stated there that those who dwell within the bounda ries of these holy places will attain a special boon at the time of their laying down the body :-"The wind" of man which is under the sway of the foul senses is always surrounded by impure influ ences. It is, however, purified in the last moments by residence in the abode of Narayana."

Therefore as stated in the sloka :-"A man should live in a place where there is a temple of Vishnu and do some kind of service (there). If he is unable to perform any service, he should At least abstain from what is forbidden"; the prapanna would do well to live in a place sanctified by the presence of Bhagavan and Bhagavatas and capable of promoting satva guna. 

It is true that it is said: “ The places where a man in full control of his senses lives — that place has in it Kurukshetra, Naimisa and, likewise, Pushkaram." But this should be taken to mean that, when & righteous man lives in some insignificant place, because of his inability to live elsewhere, that place becomes sanc tified by his residence. This is illustrated in the episode of Sandili.\* 

Therefore the statement in the following sloka :-- "The man " who performs prapatti by uttering this mantra at the very time when be attains this knowledge -- that man attaios moksha wherever he may die losing his consciousness whether it be in & holy place of pilgrimage or the house of one who eats dog's flesh" - this statement that there is no special place prescribed for death, should also be understood in the light of what has been said above, as pointing out that this will be no bindrance to the attaio ment of moksha. 

TAMIL VERSES :

invincible and incomparable Sri Rāma worshipped, the temple or vimāna which is the refuge of Vibbishana, the ally of Sri Rāma, the temple or vimāna, which secures all sorts of benefits unattainable elsewhere, the temple or vimāna which has the shape of pranava, the temple or vimāna which destroys all sins, however insurmountable they may be that temple of Srirangam is indeed full of the nectar of grace which never satiates. 

(2) The mountain which reveals to us the two feet of Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, the mountain where wicked sinners get rid of both their puiya and papa, the mountain which is renowned as being indeed moksha itself, the mountain on which flow holy streams with pellucid walers, the mountain that is extolled as the abode of all righteous actions, the mountain that secures all the enjoyments of Paramapada (the region of dazzling gold), the mountain that is longed for by the eternal săiris and the people of this earth - that mountain is only the mountain described in the Vedas and famous as lhe Venkata Hills. 

(3) Hastigiri (Kancheepuram ) where dwells Sri Rāma who, with bis might and with his arrow discharged from his beautiful bow in the great battle-field, sbook down the bunch of ten heads of the Raksbasa who was powerful in the use of missiles and where dwells also Sri Kr̥ṣṇa, the great friend of man, who ate the rising batter kept by Yasoda, after churning the abundant curd into which the chura was pressed – this Hastigiri cuts off the sins of devotees leaving no trace of them behind. It does, of itself, the work of the Lord's chakra and lets the latter remain as a mere ornament to His hand : 

(4) That place on the earth where dwell (the devotees of the Lord), who long for the world above (Paramapada) which is the famous residence of Narayana, the Lord of Lakshmi, born of the lotus full of honey (pollen) - that place is as'sacred as the Himalaya surrounded by forests, the Ganga, the Cauvery, the sea, the holy cities (like Ayodhya, Mathura, Kasi and Kanchi) and Sri Vaikanta all in one.

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

The place which is not to the liking of the minds of those who taste the nectar of the stories of Bhagavan (Vaikunta) - that place does not shine in the world, merely because it is called Kasi, (Kasi: that which shines); it does not become a (suitable) place of residence merely because it is called Ayodhya; it does not save us from our sins merely because it is called Avanti (Ave to protect); Kanchi is not excellent because of its name; nor is Madhura considered & seat of excellence merely because it is called Madhura. So also other cities do not become worthy merely because of their nanes, (if they are not to the liking of those who delight in the ambrosia of stories concerning Bhagavan (Vaikunta ).
