(24) THE CHAPTER ON THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY SADHYOPAYA OR THE UPAYA THAT HAS TO BE 

ADOPTED. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

It appears to us, from the srutis, smritis and the words of gurus fortified by reason, that the Omoipotent Lord being propi. tiated by yajnas (sacrifices ), gifts made in charity, offerings made in the fire (homa ), adoration, surrender of reponsibility (bhararı yasa ), constant meditation (bhakti yoga) and the like in accor dance with one's competence confers benefits op men. This is also what religious tradition prescribes, 

THE NEED FOR THE CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS 

MEANT BY SĀDHYOPĀYA: 

A man may have a clear koowledge of Siddhopaya (viz. Bhagavan) who is omniscient, omnipotent and supremely com. passionate, who, along with His Spouse, is the s'eshi of all and the Saviour of the whole world: he may even have become perfect in his averseness to sainsīra , by seeing that what is considered agreeable by unintelligent persoas is really disagreeable as stated in the sloka: "Health' gives (only) potency to the senses; wealth (only) creates enemies; long life makes one suffer bereavement of relations, What is there in these things that can delight a man?", He may have acquired an eager longing for the attainment of the Supreme Being as stated in the sloka :- "He who loves Bhage van, the Supreme Being, has no love for anything else"; be may have the feeling of urgency in regard to moksha as stated in the sloka :- "By payiag a beavy price in the from of virtuous deeds, this boat of a body has been bought. Before this boat is broken (or becomes leaky), hasten to crose the sea of sorrow'. In spite

of all these, if he does not clearly anderstand (all) about the sadhyopāya, prescribed in the injunction, “Seek refuge under me alone" and in the sentence which expresses the action, "I seek refuge" (in Duaya), which is the means of extinguishing the punishment inflicted by Bhagavan which biads a map to samsāra and which resulted from beginningless and continued violation of His commands - if he does not understand it, there is no way of propitiating and winning the grace of the Supreme Ruler, who is the Siddhopāya. Tberefore we will remove misconceptions that might arise concerning (1) competence therefor (2) the nature of sadhyopāya and (3) the accessories pertaining to it. 

COMPETENCE: PRAPATTI IS OPEN TO ALL (CASTES): 

1. There are some who will ask: " This prapatti is a dharma prescribed in the Vedas. If so, how can it be said that every one (of all castes) is qualified to perform it?" The answer to this question is given on the authority of the Svetasvatara Sruti, which says that the Supreme Ruler is the Saviour of all. This truth is confirmed by expository passages like the following: “Take me to Raghava who is the Protector of all the worlds”, and in slokas like:--"You should seek the protection of Vishnu who is fit to be approached by every one, who is easy of approach, who can never go wrong and has no one to compare with Him and who removes the suffering of those who perform prapatti". It is confirmed also by passages in the Sātvatasamhita (2.9), wbich says that all the three castes beginning with the Kshatriyas and ending with the Sudras who have performed prapatti, are competent to adore the four vynhas, without mantras. So also is 

"The man born even into low castes who has performed prapatti once to Bhagavan -- that man is protected by Bhagavan from the ills of samsāra oven though he is a patricide or a matricide." 

4. Ramayana: Yuddha Kanda : 17-15 

262 OB APTBR 

It is true that upāsana or meditation (in accordance with the teaching of the Upanishads ) has been deterioined as fit (only) for the three higher castes in the section Apasīdra; bat speaking the truth which is given as an injunction in the Vedas is enjoined for all castes; so also prapatti is a dharma common to all and may be performed either with Vedic mantras or with mantras found in the Tantras in accordance with the person's respective competence, without any violation of propriety. We have heard, in the s'astras, of even such beings as crows performing prapatti. The Saviour Hintself bas declared: "Women," Vaisyas and Sndras that are born of sippers - wboever they might be -they attain, O Partha, the highest state if they seek my protection". Here seeking of the Lord for protection by bhakti or prapatti is stated to be common to all. Even in the matter of upāsana or meditation (according to the vidyās in the Upanishads) thougb the beginning can be made only by men in the three higher castes, the end of the course can be attained by men in the bodies of any caste. This is stated in Vishnudharma in the following sloka :-"Though Dharmavyādha and others belonged to low and gruesome castes, yet since, in their previous births, they had practised bkaktiyoga, they continued it in their latest life and, having completed it therein, attained their goal like \*Sramani.” 

\* NOTE: (Sabari) or Sramani was of the caste of hunters and attained mukti by bhakti to Bhagavatas and Bhagavao. 

Thus upāsana or bhakti yoge should be commenced only by the three higher castes. But there is no such restriction in the general statement about the competence for prapatti. Further in the special statement about the qualifications for prapatti, it is definitely declared that every one is fit to adopt prapatti. The special qualifications requisite for prapatii have already been described by us. 

Therefore birth in the three bigher castes or the absence of it is do competence for prapatti, when anaccompanied by the 6. Sri Bhashya: 1-3-9

PRAPATTI IS NOT MERE FAITH

inability to adopt other upayas. The only qualification that is essential is ākinchanya, inability to adopt other upayas). This may be seen from the Tamil verse: "I was not born into any of the foar castes to enable me to perform dharma", and from the sloka: "O Thou Saviour! I was born into a family renowned in the world for their fame, their purity, their practice of yoga, their knowledge of the truth concerning matter (prakriti) with its three qualities and the jivas and for their steadfast attachment to Thy lotag like feet, and yet with a mind inclined to sin, I am sunkin samsāra: and am going down." Therefore it is beyond doubt that com petence for prapatti is open to persons of all castes who have & knowledge of the Saviour and of saranāgati and possess also 

MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OR 

SVARUPA OF PRAPATTI: 

2. The statement of learned men that the saranāgati re ferred to in Duaya means only faith in the two feet of Narayana being the only upāya for the attainment of Narayana with His Spouse this statement should be taken to mean only that faith in saranāgati in the mind of the person and faith as an accessory to prapatti are very important. (It does not mean that faith alone is enough). So also the words of the author of Sri Bhashya .--"Pra. patti is faith; it is prayer accompanied by a faith that Bhagavan will grant whatever is desired on account of a single act of prayer" come these words of the Bhashyakūra emphasise the importance of faith at the beginning and then declare in the words of Bharatamuni which define prapatti that prapatti is a prayer (for help) with faith (in the person whose belp is sought). (It has been shown already that) sarrender of self is the angi and that the others (like kārpanya) are angas (i...) Accessories. "Nyasa bastol been declared as having five accessories or angas." Therefore these words of the Bhashya. kara that prapatti consists in prayer (for help) which might mean % Tirucchanda Viruttam: 90. 

10A Lakshmi Tantram: 17-74. 10. Alavandar: Stotram: 01.264 " CHAPTÁR 

that the Lord expects only the prayer for help should be understood only as empbasising the importance of one of the angas (namely, the seeking of the Lord's protection ), for it is said "The 108 Lord expects the expression of the desire for protection". This is only one of the angas (and not the angi). (The Bhashyakara should not be taken as stating that the prayer alone will do). In the shorter gadya also (Srirangagadya), Sri Ramanuja makes the prayer with faith preceding it and concludes with the words namostu te (v.e.) "I bow to Thee". Further be uses the word s'aranam which means seeking (the Lord) as upāya. From these two, it is evident that self-surrender is present. That the word namas in namostute means surrender of self is well-known from such passages as the following:-- "I bow" to Bhagavao to whom, having surrendered his self which is what is meant by namaskāra, & man gets rid of his suffering and enjoys whatever he desires." In Sri Vaikunta Gadya the surrender of self preceded by prayer is explicit. Therefore (since Sri Ramanuja states in Vaikunta - gadya: "Praying for protection), the person should surrender his (or her) self to Bhagaven after bowing to Him,") it is clear that surrender of self is different from the prayer for protection and is the angī with the prayer as an anga. It has therefore to be concladed that in the words: "One should" surren. der one's self by attering this mantra", and "the surrender" of one's self and of what belongs to one's self", the angi which is garrender of self, is declared as a vidhi or injunction. 

If this were not accepted (as true), it would lead to constru ing the sentence "Saranāgati is of 1A six kinds" in its apparent meaning and thinking that the five accessories or angas of prapatti Bre, every one of them, a form of prapatti or angī, in the same Way as we conclude that there are seven different kinds of ablution (snāna) from the sentence :- "Ablution 188 is said to be of seven kinds".

24. 

PRAYER ALONE IS NOT PRAPATTI 

. If it is argued that the angas are not considered to be angis on account of the statement: “One 13Cshould perform prapatti with its five angas or accessories," then by the force of the same argumentandin accordance with the statement "Nyása is tabaccom panied by five angas", we should, in reason, correct such state ments as "Prapatti is prayer" and "Prapatti is faith", and hold that " Nikshepa or surrender is the augi", and that the rest are 

(only) angas, 

Even if we judge by the principle that, (when there is a diffe. rence in the statements ), that statement which is made in a larger number of contexts should be accepted as true, it would be evident, from a study of the chapters on Prapatti in Sātvika Tantra, Lakshmi Tantra, Ahirbudhriya Samhita, and the like, that Nik shepa or self-surrender is the angi. Even in the sloka :-"Thou 18€ Halone, shouldst be my upāya. It is this idea of prayer that is called saranagati", it is indicated by suggestion in the word upaya coming along with the word 'alone' that what ia referred to is bharanyāsa or surrender of responsibility which is the main theme in that context. Even in ordinary life, an accessory is often spoken of as if it were the main thing in order to emphasise some one aspect or other. The word ülambha, which means 'killing' is employed to mean also 'yāga or sacrifice in a wider sense; so also in "seek refuge" in the Charama sloka and the like, the verbs signify the sacrifice of the self or ātma yiiga, which is usually ex pressed by such words as vyāsa, nikshepa and tyāga (surrender), This is in keeping with Vedic usage. 

What is called Vāga is a special form of thought indicating that a particular offering (havis) is made to a particular deity. Ātrayāga or the sacrifice (or surrender of self) is (likewise) a special form of thought indicating this : « My soul, which is the most delicious of offerings (havis ), is for Sriman Narayana. We

have already stated (on page 137) that in this surrender of selt, the nature of the action to be performed which is common to all .who desire benefits of whatever kind is the surrender of the res... 

ponsibility for protection. SANSKRIT SLOKAS : 

Here in the surrender of selt for the sake of moksha, since there is to be made an offering (havis), owing to the injunction regarding the manner in which the offering should be made, there is an additional feature for the man who is destitate of other upāyas, namely, the surrender of the responsibility for the pro tection of the self. Therefore by sach authors as Rama Misra (Uyyakkondar) god others, when they want to speak of the surren. der of responsibility (bharanyasa), a single aspect of it, namely, the abstention from his own activity on the part of the prapanna has been used to indicate prapatti. As in the world of ordinary life, when the surrender of responsibility has not been made, abstention from one's own activity will not result thereafter merely from the request for protection. He who sees the subtle feature that is common to these three, namely, being destitute of all upayas for protection, surrender of respsasibility and the prayer for being the upāya --- be alone sees. (That sabtle feature wbicb is common to all the three of them is refraining from all activity of one's own for one's protection. Since there is this common feature in all the three, the other two are sometimes used to denote bharanyāsa). 

Thus the surrender of one's responsibility for the protection of one's self is the main injunction that is made in all sāstras treating of prapatti and it has five accessories. (Such eminent authorities) as Sri Vishnucbitta, Vadibamgambuvaha, and Varadacharya have succinctly stated (this truth). 

THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE IS SESHA TO THB 

LORD IS NOT IN ITSELF PRAPATTI: 3. There are some who say: "When a man has understood the truth regarding the tattvas from the sāstras, has be not realised his relationship as sesha to Bhagavan ? Further, in 

24 KNOWLEDGE OF BEBHATVA IS NOT PRAPATTI 287 

the staka, "If you desire to attain the highest state and to adopt the upaya for it, remember that Hari is (your) master and that you are His servant and that this relationship exists for ever by the very nature (of thiags), (in this sloka) -- is not the meaning as follows:- "If you desire the highest goal of life and the means of attaining it, you should understand clearly that you are the servant and that Iswara is the master and that this relationship exists by nature"? They ask "When this is so, is there an action (besides the thought of the relationship) enjoined called ātrasamarpa. nam". This question does not deserve any consideration, just like the dictum (of the Advaitins) that, by the mere kaowledge of the text of the \*sruti, moksha can be attained. 

\*NOTE: 

Texts like "That Thou art" and "I am Brahmap". 

SANSKRIT SLOKAS: 

To the man who prides himself op having stolen from Bhagam van the gem Kaustubha (which is the symbol of his soul) and who is the prince of all sinners (ie. the greatest of all sinners) the surreader of responsibility (bharanyāsa) (to the Lord) has been enjoin. ed as an expiation. The thought that he is the sesha of the Supreme Being, which qualifies the prapanna, serves also to prevent the theft of the soul (atmapahāra) in the future (1.6.) after prapatti. 

The map first understands from the săstras that his self which is a Real (Tattva) has the attribute of being & s'esha. Then with this oompetency and with the accessories pertaining (to prapatti) and also with the specific idea of the particular benefit desired, be surrenders the responsibility for the protection of bis soul (to Bhagavan) bearing in mind bis relationship as a sesha. This surrender of responsibility which is enjoined as an upaya for the remission of the punishment resulting from endless sins is indeed what is called ātmasamarpana (the surrender of the self ). 

14. Vishnu Tattva:

SRIMAD RAHASYATR 

CHAPTER 

When it is said that moksha is attained by a knowledge of the truth, it should be understood as meaning that it is only by way of leading to the adoption of an upaya. This is evident from the authority of the injunction (vidhi) contained in such paseages as "Worship\*\* me" and "seek 18cefage under me". 

SANSKRIT SLOKA : 

The instruction which states:- "From knowledge arises moksha", shoald be understood in one of two ways:- Bhakti preceeded by jnana or knowledge leads to moksha or from jnāna or knowledge, wbich is of the nature of bhakti, results moksha (for bhakti is itself a form of knowledge). 

Similarly the knowledge of the relationship of being a sesha to the Lord which arises from a study of the s'āstra is common to all forms of activity for moksha, by refraining from the worldy life, like bharanyāsa and upasana or bhakti, Since the activity of the s'esha, pamely, service, is the extreme limit of the goalof attainment, it is certainly not possible to adopt any of the upāyas enjoined for moksha, without adderstanding the relationship of sesha to the Lord. Even if a man adopts the dharmas enjoined for the attain. ment of moksha without knowing this relationship of being a s'esha, these dharmas or upāyas themselves will (in course of time) produce that knowledge of the relationsbip and will become the cause of moksha by making the adoption of the upāya perfect and complete. So the atmasamarpanam that is enjoined for perfor mance is not the mere knowledge of the relationship of being & s'esha; if it is asked wbat, then, it is, the answer is that it is the surrender of the responsibility for one's protection accompanied by such things 88 the knowledge of the relationsbip of being & s'esha. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA. 

The contention that the particular kind of knowledge called prapatti results merely from the sentences or passages of the 15. Bhagavad gita: 9-33 

16. Bhagavad gita : 18-66 : 

24 PRAPATTI IS NOT MERE REFRAINING FROM ACTIVITY 269 

vāstra, that it is, on that account, called siddhopaya and that it is not an upaya to be accomplished by a certain activity -- this con tention also is refuted by the injunction or vidhi (saranam vraja). 

It it is argued that s'arananı vraja "geek protection" merely means “Know this truth (that the Lord is the Saviour)", the answer is that it is opposed to the natural and obvious meaning of the words. It would also be against the plain and explicit rules or vidhis for the performance of prapatti as in the sentence: "Per. forn this prapatti accompanied by its five accessories or angas," If it is held that what is intended in the Charama sloka is merely this, that Iswara is the upāya for moksha and that no activity is enjoined in this siloka for the man who wants moksha, it would mean that it is merely the teaching of a truth that is needed for bhakti yoga, which is the subject treated in that context. (The Charaına sloka would then cease to have anything to do with prapatti), 

REFRAINING FROM ONE'S OWN ACTIVITY IS 

NOT IN ITSELF PRAPATTI: 

There are some who hold that prapatti is merely refraining from one's own activity for protecting one self and that what is enjoined for its accomplishment is only the abandonment of all dharmas or upāyas. The answer to this view is as follows:- Even though it is abstention, this abandonment of all dharmas is itself an activity or dharma of the person for his own protection (and this would be inconsistent with their own words). Further this view is in conflict also with the passage (quoted above) enjoining the performance of prapatti with its five angas. 

The view held by some that the regarding of prapati as an. upaya or as an auxiliary to Siddhopāya (for moksha ) is opposed to the doctrine that the Siddhopāya, namely, Iswara, is the only upaya, that He is already an existent upāya, that He is the Sap. reme Sentient, that He has supreme compassion, and omnipotenge and that He is independent of all others -- this view is at variance 

270 CHAPTEK 

with the srutis and the smritis. It is not based on any general proposition such as: "Wherever an auxiliary condition is required, there cannot be a single upaya" and "Where an accessory is required, there is no independent doership"). Since there are these objections and others, this view is based on fallacious reasoning. If it were considered sound reasoning, it would mean that, even in upāsana, whatever is accepted as auxiliary should be rejected as unnecessary. 

If it were further argued that even upāsana is not a means or upāya, it would be inconsistent with what has been stated else where by those who hold this view, for wbile commenting on the passage, "Having given up all dharmas, seek refuge under me", they interpret the word dharma as upasana or upāya for the attaioment of moksha. If they contend that in order to remove Arjana's haughtiness, Sri Krishna prescribes unnecessary burdens and uses the word dharma to mean what Arjuna, in his delusion or inability to understand the real purport of the teaching, considers as necessary upāyas in the phrase "all dharmas", (the answer is as follows):It is stated (io Yagnyavalkya Smriti 1-8):-- "The adora tion of the Lord, personal purity, control of the senses, aon-violence, giving in charity, repeating the Vedas, other Vedic rites - among all these, having a vision of the Supreme Being by karına yoga jnāna yoga and bhakti yoga is the highest dharma". Again it is said - "Among all dharmas, the dharmal which consists in the adoration of Vishnu is the highest, for He protects His devotee as if he were His own body"; and farther, "There is no other karma" enjoined in the Vedas for the expiation of sins than the adoration of Vishnu". If those well-known dharmas which are described as supreme sad which are activities for moksha of the Dature of abstention from worldly action, are stated to be no dharmas, much more 80 would the dharmas prescribed for worldly ends cease to be dharmas, and none of the sāstras would carry

24 

BHAKTI OR PRAPATTI QUITE NECESSARY 271 

any authority or weight. Those who hold those views would then line up with atheists and heretics. 

It may be asked: (The words in the Gita are): "Give np all dharias". In order that the meaning of the word all may not be contracted or reduced in application, since the seeking of the Lord's protection is also denoted by the word dharma just like upāsanas, should it not also be given up, in as much as it is also an upaya or sādhana? Similarly to consider prapatti 4s & sādhana, or upāya or an auxiliary condition is at variance with the words in the Gita: "Give up all dharmas or upāyas.". We ask in reply :-"(What do you really mean?) If you mean that we should adopt the upaya giving up the thought that it will directly and by itself lead to the end in viow, it applies also equally to bhakti yoga. If it is meant that we should give up the thought of prapatti being a dharma even for winding the grace of the Lord, we answer, “In that case, you will have to give up even the thought that Siddhopaya, namely, "Sri Krishna, is the eternal dharmale or upāya ", in order that the meaning of all in all dharmas may not suffer reduction of application. 

If it is argued that what are to be abandoned are all dharmas other than the one described in this passage - (namely, the Charana sloka ), the same answer might be given in support of the performance of saranūgati which is prescribed in this very passage: (sarasam vraja). 

A further doubt might arise as follows:- “Upāsanas, as upāyas, require that they should be originated or started; upa. sanay have to be promoted to higher and higher perfection; upa. sanas require the fulfilment of auxiliary conditions - Not so, this upāya, namely Bhagavad. He does not require to be originated or increased in intensity por does He require any auxiliary help or means of approach. He is eternal, has neither growth nor decay and has always such qualities as full and perfect compassion which 

i 

18. Mahabharata: Aranya Parva: 71-123. DARA 

CBAPTRR 

are of His very pature. Without any means of approach, He is ever existent as an upaya and is of irresistible might: Of what use, then, are bhakti and prapatti in His case ?" The answer is that they help to obtain remission of the punishment which is the cause of samsāra and which has been ipflicted for beginciogless and successive acts of offence. When these upāyas are adopted for other benefits (than moksha ) (for instance, svarga), they generate favourable dispositions (in the Lord) suited to the attainment of the respective benefits, just like Jyotishtoma and the like and thus serve as aids. In the case of the man wbo desires moksha, they, as vyāja or sādhyopāya, cause appeasement in Siddhopāya so as to cancel the punishment and then to remove the contraction of knowledge and the like due to that punisbment, 80 that Siddhopaya or the Lord confers (on the person) benefits extending up to perfect service. It is in this way these upāyas help as long as the self lasts. 

. Therefore those pramānas or authoritative passages which state that Siddhopāya (the Lord) confers the ultimate goal of perfect service (kainkarya ) along with preliminary benefits after removing all undesirable hindrances and that sādhyopaya (bhakti and prapatti) leads to these benefits by propitiating Siddhopaya - these pramānas are both apposite and agree with one another very well. 

IS THERE ANY NEED FOR THE SASTRA 

ENJOINING PRAPATTI ? 

4. Notwithstanding all this, some may ask: "Why should the sāstra enjoin this upāya called prapatti? (The sāstra has to help only when man cannot find out things for himself with his common sense or reason). In ordinary life, when a man is about to sink (into ruin ) because he cannot protect himself, he seeks the protection of some one who happens to be by his side and who has the ability to protect him. In the same way, if a man has under. stood bimself and Iswara from the s'āstra which trests of the existent upāya, will be not:neek Iswara for protection, of his own 

24 WHY SHOULD SĀSTRA ENJOIN PRAPATTI 278 

accord, (without the sāstra enjoining it)? So there is no prop.: riety in the sastra prescribing prapatti in the place of bhakti. 

This question is based on appropriate reasoning but proceeds too far. This is how it goes too far. In ordinary life (in the world) when a man seeks the help of another, he tries to learn before-band in what way he should approach the other, so that the latter may take pity on him and then he seeks bis protection. Similarly we should know who is competent to seek Iswara's pro tection and in what manner he should do so, so that the Lord may protect him; there is no pramana or authority other than the stāstra which deals with what abould be done and which can tell 08 how we should proceed to seek His help. It cannot be maintained that, by means of inference (or anumāna), we can understand that the Lord will protect if we seek refuge under Him and then seek His protection. For in that case, every one who has a know. ledge of the truth concerning Iswara may adopt the means in the manner suggested by his own inference and the texts in the stāstra which prescribe upāsana (bhakti) would then become useless. The distinction that he who is capable should adopt upāsana and the like and that he who is not capable of them should resort to prapatti - this distinction cannot be established by means of inference ( anumāna ). If the stāstra does not enjoin the per. formance of prapatti in the place of other upāyas to those who are incapable of them, they will bave to lose the fruit of these other upāyas as they are not competent enough for their proper per formance. This is how it stands. Though in ordinary life (in the world), we see service to kings and the like conferring certain benefits, yet we hold that in regard to the weaving of garlands, the lighting of lamps, the singing of hymns, the act of prostrating, and so on (in temples), if these things are done without any reference to the sāstras (as to how they should be done!, they will become offences. The worship of Bhagavan and His service have to be done with the right accessories as laid down in the stāstras and the fruits arising therefroin have also to be understood only from the sāstras. In the same way, although we see instances of prapattiBRIMAD RAHASYATRAYASARA 

CRAPTER 

io worldly life and the benefits arising theretrom, yet we can understand only from the sāstras the relationship of cause and effect that exists between prapatti performed with particular mantras and in accordance with the instructions of the good Acharya and certain special benefits which would result therefrom. Just as certain special forms of worship and service are prescribed for certain special benefits, prapatti, too, has been enjoined. If it were otherwise, no rules would have to be prescribed for the service of Bhagavan, in the same way as there are none for the service of the king. It would lead to the wrong view that, for prapatti also, the initiation into mantras with the instructions of good acharyas is unnecessary. That even those who are not competent for the utterance of mantras may perform prapatti to the Saviour who has certain specific attributes and that certain specific benefits will be derived therefrom, provided it is performed in the proper way without anything wanting and without any up due excess - this cannot be determined by any sound inference, Therefore just as particular forms of worship and service to Bhagavan are enjoined (in the sāstras) with certain accessories, there is nothing inappropriate in the sāstra prescribing the per formance of prapatti with certain accessories (angas ). 

THE VIEW THAT UPĀSANA OR BHAKTI IS INCONSISTENT WITH ONE'S ESSEN 

TIAL NATURE IS WRONG: 

5. There are some who maintain that even among these upayas which are enjoined by the sāstras, upūsanas are opposed to the essential nature (of the jiva ). This should be taken to mean only a desire to praise prapatti with emphasis on it and not to condemn upāsanas ( as being against one's nature). The reasons are as follows: 

(a) It cannot be said that they are against the essential nature of the jīve on the ground that they would destroy the self, for the self is eternal (and cannot be destroyed). 

24 BHAKTI NOT INCONSISTENT WITH SVARUPA 875 

(b) It cannot be stated that the self or soul is, in its essential nature (svarupa), incapable, as the Sankhya saya, of being a doer, and is therefore incapablo, by its very nature, of performing upasanas. For the self is a doer in bhakti (or upa. sanas) and the like is in the performance of prapatti, and in rendering service (to Bhagavan and to Bhagavatas). As stated in the Brahma Sutras: "The 'Self is a doer (capable of endea vour or effort); otherwise the sāstras which enjoin doing certain things and refraining from certain other things would have no purpose or aim", and again, “This "doership of the self is dependent on Brahman" As stated in these passages, the self is a doer capable of endeavour, though his being a doer is dependent on Bhagavan. If it is maintained that the self is absolutely in capable of action, it would follow that, since purposetul action is the sign or mark, of the existence of a thing, the self is void or non-existent. If it is held that the self merely exists and is without jnāna (or knowledge), without the desire to act, and without the endeavour or effort needed for action, it would follow that it is incapable also of enjoyment (boktritvam). This would mean that samsāra is illusory and that there is no need for any upāya for the attaioment of moksha. The sloka "Lakshmi" comes of her own accord to a man who makes no endeavour. Another man does not obtain even food, bard though he worke. This is also due to past karma" - this sloka should not be inter preted as stating that the upayas prescribed in the sāstras are all of no use. It only emphasises that certain benefits come to a man as a result of certain actions performed in previous (births). 

(c) Nor can it be maintained that upasanas ara, accor. ding to sāstras, against the essential nature of the jiva, because they would bring evil consequences. For, unlike actions performed out of the desire for worldly gains (kāmya) and actions prohibited

21. Mahabharata: Santi Parva;

276 · ORAPTER: 

in the sāstras (nishiddha), which are obstacles to mnoksha and which arise from desire (rāga) and the like, upāsanas cannot bind the soul to samsara, because they are not performed out of a desire for worldly gains and because they are enjoined in the sāstras only for those who want moksha. 

Thus upāsanas cannot destroy the essential nature of the self, they are not impossible of performance por do they bring evil consequences; there is, therefore, no justification for their be ing considered to be at variance with the essential nature (of the self). 

(d) Again it may be argued that since the self is different from such things as the body, there is no propriety in the man who koows that, in bis essential nature as the self, there is no such thing 28 varna or āsrama, performing the duties and rites (dharmas) and other upayas which are connected with them, because they all arise from the (erroneous) notion. "I am a Brahmin, I am & Kshatriya." (It may be argued) on this ground that these rites and duties (dharmas) which are dependent on one's caste (vara) and asrama may justly be considered as being against the essential nature of the self. This argument, too, is not sound for the following reagoo :-- Even if he understands that, in its essential nature, the self is not Brahmin and the like, yet since he is, owing to certain forms of past karna, in close association with the body which has the attributes of Brahmin and the like, he should not give up the dharmas enjoined by the sāstrus in accor dance with his varna and āsrama and also in accordance with his capacity for getting rid of the illt of life and for attaining good things, as long as he is with that body, in the same way as he makes endeavours to ward off such things as bunger and thirst which arise from that association with the body. Therefore it cannot be maintained that these dharmas should be given up on the ground that they are against the essential nature of the soul because the body is different from the soul to (the man endowed with discrimination.) In regard to the performance of these 

24 BHAKTI NOT INCONSISTENT WITH SVARUPA 277 

dharmas, it is not the delusion that the essential nature of the self bas Brahminness and the like which gives competence, but the association with the body which has such attributes as Brahmiz. ness. Therefore we do not see any conflict between upāsanas and the essential nature of the self on account of the intelligent discri. mination between the body and the soul which is necessary for the performance of all dharma. That upāsanas have within then the notion of "I" (ahamkara) finds 20 authority or sanction in the sāstras, but was merely assumed by these critics to exist. (In the performance of karma yoga, we are enjoined to give up the notion that we are free agents and that we want certain benefits ). 

(e) Some say that since karma yoga and the like have to be performed with the help of the body and the senses which are adventitious (upādhi) and wbich were acquired as the result of past karma, they are against the essential nature of the self. To them we reply that, even for a kaowledge of one's essential nature and for learning Dvaya and the like, there is nee i for such things as the mind. (So they would have to say that knowledge of the essential nature and learning Dvaya are against the essential Dature.) Thus their objection would extend to the latter also. 

THE OBJECTION THAT THE JĪVA WHO IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE LORD CANNOT AND 

SHOULD NOT ADOPT AN UPAYA. 

(f) It might be asked, “ Whatever that might be, since the jīva exists solely for Iswara (sesha ), he is not expected to protect himself and since he is absolutely subject to the will and control of Iswara, be cannot protect himself; is it proper then to prescribe a means or upüya &s necessary to be adopted by him for his protection and to call this an upaya that is capable of being adopted by him? Whea this is 80, bhakti yoga and the like are productive of evil to the essential Oature of the self (svarūpa); as they are inconsistent with his being & s'esha who exists only for Iswara and are not possible of adoption, as they are inconsistent 

278 OBAPTIR 

with bis being absolutely ander the will and control of Iowara". This objection has already been answered as leading to the logical conclusion of the possibility of salvation for all. If the Lord were to grant a jiva mukti or salvation without any consideration (vyāja) whatsoever, the jiva should be a mukti from beginning less time, If it is beld that Iswara, being independent and omni. potent, makes a man & mukta whenever He is pleased, it would mean that he is partial to some and cruel to others. Similar here. sies would follow : Further those sāstras which prescribe the means for attaining mukti would become meaningless. Therefore in adopting this means enjoined as the result of the jiva's being a s'esha there is appropriateness and also a like appropriateness in the owner protecting what is his own. It would become possible to adopt such means as are agreeable to Him with the help of the measure of independence granted (to us) by Him as the Supreme Controller and to expect His favour in regard to the fruit or object of attainment. This s'eshatva or existing solely for the Lord and being absolutely subject to His will and control - these two will help, in the stage of realisation, to perform the kind of service that is agreeable to Him as that ordained by Him. 

If these objectors hold that, on account of the knowledge of being the s'esha and of entire dependence on Iswara, the jiva should make no effort for his own protection, it would follow that the service (kainkarya ) rendered in accordance with the sastras for the attainment of the Lord's favour and so also prapatti which is prescribed as possible, would he beyond his competence, because they are understood as being opposed to bis essential Dature. We have already stated that prapatti is capable of being adopted as & means in as much as it has been prescribed in the words "sara. nam vraja" (seek refage), as something that has to be performed over and above the mere kpowledge of the relationship (between the jiva and Iswara ) arising from the texts. Therefore there is no inappropriateness in the jiva, who exists only for the Lord and who is entirely subject to His control, adopting such means of bis own for his protection as he is competent to adopt, 

24 TAE RITES OF VARNA & ASRAMA MUST BE PERFORMED 279 

THE OBJECTION THAT THE RITES OF VARŅA AND ASRAMA AND BHAKTI YOGA ARE INCON SISTENT WITH EXCLUSIVE DEVO. 

TION TO THE LORD. 

(g) However, it may be stated, since the jiva bas understood clearly that He exists solely for Iswara and for no other, it is opposed to his nature as a supreme and exclusive devotee of the Lord to practise the rites (dharma ) ordained for his varṇa and asrama, because they imply the mediatorship of other deities (like Agni, Surya and Varuna) and also to practise such things as bhakti yoga which have these rites as their anga or accessory. It is only s'uddha vājis who worship the Lord alone (without any reference to other deities) that deserve to be called mer with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (paramaikānti)". This objection can arise only from a lack of clear understanding of the conclusion arrived at in such treatises as Sri Bhashya. It may be asked how. The answer is that in such vidyās as Pratardana and Madhu vidyā, it is distinctly stated that the Supreme Being is to be worshipped or meditated upon by the aspirant for mukti 8s having Indra and other deities as His body. The author of Sri Bhashya has declared that in regard to the rites and duties of the varna and ūsrama also, which are angas or accessories to the vidyās, the object of worship or meditation is only the Supreme Self who has the respective deities as His body. Therefore what is opposed to exclusive devotion to the Lord is the worship of other deities as if they were iodependent, and also connection with other deities owing to a desire for certain specific fruits, when these deities have nothing to do with the rites and duties which are com. pulsory and recurrent (nitya ) as well as those wbich are inci. dental and occasional (naimittika ). There is no opposition to supremo and exclusive devotion to the Lord in performing one's ordained rites and duties without any attachment to or desire for any other fruit and with the thought that these deities are attri. butes of the Lord and that such words as Agai denote the Lord 

280 CHAPTER 

who has Agni and the like as His body or attributes. There is no opposition to exclusive devotion, likewise, in following the princi ple: "These \*words (Agai, Indra etc.) directly denote, by their etymological significance, the Supreme Self. It is not improper to think 89. So says Jaimini", for these are rites and daties enjoined (in the stāstras). 

(b) "But", it may be argued again, "the sõstras have enjoined also rites for such things as betwitchment (\*\* abhichāra) to produce conviction. In the same manner, the forms of meditation (or upiisana ) have been enjoined only in order to produce convic tion or faith in the efficacy of wbat is prescribed (by the sāstras) viz., prapatti. It does not mean that they are to be performed. To tbe aspirant for mukti, the end or object of attaionient and the means of attaining it are both one and the same. Therefore the means favourable for the attainment of lbat end is only Iswara, It is on account of this that the god presiding over dharma condemned upāsanas as opposed to the end in view, while saying to bis son :-"0, "Bharata, If you are afraid of sins, do not begin any activity and remain with the thought that Narayana is the oply end to be attained with all your heart." This arguinent, too, is not tenable for the following reasons: 

(1) The rites of bewitchment ( abhichāra) and the like are sources of evil, because they are performed for purposes or fruits that are evil. Since thakti or upasana is enjoined for attaining moksha, it cannot be a source of evil: 

Suddha Yalis . Those whose adoration is solely to Bhagavan without any intermediaray like Agni, Varuna and the like. 

\*\* NOTE:- The Vedas prescribe the rites called abhichara for causing the death of one's enemy. They do so in order that by seeing the effect, men may have faith in the sastra. 

22. Brahma Sutras: 1-2-29 23. Vishnu dharma : 66-72 

24 

BHAKTI YOGA IS A TRUE UPAYA 

281 

(2) It would be inconsistent with the view of these critics to hold that bhakti or upāsana is enjoined only to produce an eager desire for the adoption of an easier means, viz., prapatti, by describing & more difficult means, vis, bhakti, for they bold that bhakti is no means at all (to attain moksha). Besides bhakti does not yield its fruit in this life but only after it. So it cannot create faith or conviction in the other means prescribed, vix., prapatti. Men generally adopt, of their own accord, the easier means in pre ference to the more difficult means. The success of the easier means in producing the desired result will create faith or convic tion in regard to the more difficult means and not vice versa. So the more difficult upāya cannot cause faith in the efficacy of the easier means. It will, therefore, have to be argued in support of their view that, when certain fruits or good results which will arise from a main rite or angī are stated to arise from its anga or accessory rite, it should be considered only as arthavada or mere praise having no literal truth according to a principle (or nyāya) of the Mimamsakas. Here moksha is really the fruit of prapatti, which is the angī and this fruit is, in the view of these critics, for the sake of mere praise (which is not true), assigned to its anga bhakti also. So, bhakti is, according to them, really not capable of yielding moksha. This argument, too, is no good as it would be inconsistent with the contention of these critics, for they would then have to admit that bhakti is an anga or accessory of prapatti (which they deny). 

The means or upāya, that is favoured by Iswara, who is the object of attainment, can be understood only from the sāstra (and it is no use asserting that bhakti is not favoured by Him). Reason is not competent to say that the means, viz., bhakti is opposed to the end in view (Bhagavan). If we are to object to any one thing that is prescribed in the stāstras by reasoning which is against the sastra, there would, by parity of reasoning, be no validity in any of the things or dharmas prescribed in the s'āstras and, likewise, in the s'astras prescribing prapatti as well. 

282 ON APTER 

Further there is no authority for the statement that in the sloka quoted above (from Vishnu dharma :'note 23), the word pātaka (sin) refers to upāsanas and the like. Therefore since bhakti and prapatti are both enjoined for the aspirant to mukti, they are, either of them, to be adopted in accordance with the competence (of the individual concerned). 

(i) Nor would it be proper to hold that, though these two bhakti and prapatti are enjoined (in the stāstras), bhakti or upāsana and the like are not to be practised in as much as they have not been favoured for adoption by the acharyas; (for instance) such things as the slaying of a bull for the entertainment of a guest at dinner, though enjoined, are opposed to the traditional practice of the learned (sishta). This objection, too, is not that of a thinking mind. It is only when all the achāryas avoid the performance of & rite or observance, that it should be abandoned in accordance with the saying: "Though a ritead has been prescribed in the sāstra, yet if it will retard the attainment of svarga and is also repugnant to the general public, it should not be performed". In regard to the rites in question, since they were adopted by such ancient acharyas as Parasara who is described by Alavandar as one of the best sages, it cannot be maintained that they are against the traditional observance of all learned inen. 

(j) In the same way, it cannot be argued that, “though these rites were suitable as dharmas to be practised in other yugas, since in Kali Yuga, it is not possible to find men competent to perform such things as the upusana or meditation of the Supreme Self, they are pot suited for observance in this age. That is why it has been said :-“Whatever 25 fruit a nan obtained in Krita Yuga by redunciation (tyāga), whatever fruit a man obtained in the Dvapara Yuga by the performance of yajnas, whatever a man obtained in Tretayuga by worshipping the Lord, that a mag attains in Kali Yuga by the mere mention of His names", and so also in the Mahābhirata " Kali Yug& has this one great 24.

283 

advantage, O, king; in Kali, a man gets rid of his past karma by the mere mention of Sri Krishna's names and attains the Lord": Against this objection we may state that even at the present time, there may be present men who are competent to perform such things as upāsanas and who, like the ancient Ūchāryas, are established in yoga for its own sake, for it is said :-" To the \* man who has Govinda at heart, there is Kritayuga in Kali yuga and to him who does not entertain Achyuta at heart, there is Kali Yuga even in Krita Yuga," If these were not admitted, it would follow that even prapatti, which is different from the mention of the Lord's names (samkārtana) is not to be performed, becanse it is difficult to find men who are competent to perform it and who have the intense faith (inahii visvisa ) necessary for it, for it has been said :-“There is ano man (O Brahma) who is competent to be initiated into this mantru. who is competent to perform the rite uttering this mantra or who will listen to it." Therefore since there is no other objection to such things as upāsanas, they can be said to be unsuitable only for those adhikūrīs who are "destitute28A of all upūyas and who have no other way of salvation", because they are inappropriate for their competence in the same way as ablutions by complete immersion in water are unsuitable for those that are ill. It is in regard to such men as do not under. stand their being incompetent ( for bhakti or upasana ) and who adopt it as a means that it is said: “It is owing a' to the weakness of mind which fails to understand its competence or incompetence that a man adopts bhakti as an upāya. Therefore even these upāsanas and the like are, for other adhikaris, suitable to the extent of their competence. Incompetence for them arises from inability to adopt them or the inability to eodnre delay (in attain ing salvation). The inan who has this incoinpetence adopts pra. patti. The man wbo has adopted prapatti as an independent and direct upāya is proclaimed as "one who has 29A performed & sacri.

fice, one who has 298 done what be ought to do' and 'one who29C has perforined a hundred sacrifices' by the Alvars, the great sages and the Lord's Sastras ( Bhagavat Săstra) and the Vedas. Further these authorities also praise all bis activities ap to the time of death, as if they were the varied duties connected with yajnas and ending with the final bath (avabhrita). They hold also that, in the same way as the man who has performed a yajna performs the compulsory and occasional rites (sritya and na imit tika ) after it, the man who has adopted prapatti should perform the duties of his varna and āsrama as the commands of the Lord who is omnipotent and that the man who has performed the sacri fice or yajna of the self does not require the performance of any other activity for the fruit desired by bim. Therefore as stated in such places as the sloka :-"The Yogi iskop superior to all those who practise austerities (tapas); he is soperior also to the jnănīs and to those who perform the rites and duties (ordained for them). Therefore, 0 Arjuna, become a yogin"; the dharmas or activities of renunciation are superior to the activities or dharmas of action (pravritti); so also the yoga connected with the self is superior to all other yogas; of all yogas the highest is the yoga connected with (Sri Krishna), the son of Vasudeva, for it has been said, "The sopan who fixes his mind on me and worships me with earnest faith should be considered as the highest among yogis". Similarly of all the vid yiis or forus of meditation on the Supreme Self, only the particular vidyā which is called nyāsa, nikshepa and 80 on is the bighest, for, among other reasons, it is easy, it has to be performed only once, and it leads to the attainment of the end 800n. This truth regarding the Nyasa vidyā is stated explicitly in the Bhagavat Sāstra in the following slokas: "Of all othe auste rities (tapas) prescribed for the attainment of moksha, the auste rity called nyasa (prapatti) is the bighest ", and "Those who, with their thoughts fixed only on moksha, are alsorbed in the per

formance of karmayoga and those, again, who follow jnana yoga aod bhaktiyoga do not deserve to be placed on a par with even ode-ten millionth of the man who has performed prapatti". 

To the man who is unable (owing to illness ) to perform such things as ablution by immersion," the medita:ion on A Vishnu, which is called mental ablation, is ordained; thereby be obtains not only the purity of those who perforun the other kinds of ablution, but acquires freedom from sins and the pleasure of the immediate en joyment of Bhagavan. In the same way, though prapatti is ordained for those who are not competent to perform such things as upisanas, it confers the fruits attainable from them; it secures them (the upāya, pamely, upasana also); it redeerns the man who is destitute of all other upayas ( akinchana ); and further it secures the fruit (desired by him) at the time when he wants it. There. fore prapatti has superior potency. 

DOES PRAPATTI REQUIRE ANGAS OR ACCESSORIES ? 

So far we have removed the misconceptions that may arise about the competence for the upiya and its essential nature (svarīpa). Henceforward we will proceed to remove those mis. conceptions that might be entertained in regard to accessories of that upaya. (1) Is it necessary that this püya sbould be accom. pained by such things as the determination to do what is agreeable (ānukūlya sankalpa )? Will the Saviour who said, “If & \*8 man seeks protection with the desire for the immediate attainment of an object (ürta ) or with endurance of delay in the attain uent (dripta), he should be protected by those who know the s'istras, even though he might be an enemy," "I will, in no circumstances, abandon one who has come to me in the guise of a friend, even though there are faults in biw. The great will appreciate this," and "Bring hin\* here, O Sugriva, whether he be Vibhishana or

oven Ravana bimaself. I promise protection to him" - ( will the Saviour who said these words) and who was gracious even to his enemies care for the faults of those who have sought refuge under him? The ancients describe Him as the Protector of the whole world without any consideration of merit. Therefore these acces. sories (such as ūnukiilya sankalpa) are not requisites but attri butes that are most likely to be met with in those who have performed prapatti." Such is the contention of some critics. In reply to this misconception, it may be said that the passages on wbich it is based may really have, for their purport, the idea that though such attributes as ūnukiilya do not continue after the performance of prapatti, some expiation will occur and there will be no diminution in the fruit of prapatti, (They do not mean that qualifications like ānukilyasankalpa are not required at the time of the performance of prapatti). If this explanation is not accepted, many authoritative passages which distinguish bet ween the main rite (angi) and its accessories (anga) such as "Saraṇāgati is of six kinds," "Nyasa has five angas" and "Let him perform that prapatti which has five accessories " - many such authoritative passages would offer opposition. We have already stated that (the absence of these accessories) would be against what is the subject of experience in the world in regard to the conventions regarding the surrender of objects that have to be protected and that these accessories are required only once and so on. Even the divine missile, Brahmastra, requires its own acces sories (angas). Hence the sloka that there is no other requisite \*\* for prapatti anywhere and at any time" only states that it does not require aoy other dhurma cor rite. (It does not mean that reved) the angus of prapatti are not reqnired). Otherwise even intense faith (mahüvisvāsa) which these critics commend as an anga wight be considered as an attribute which may be found (in a prapanna) and not as an anga. 

36. Sanatkumara Samhita.

MAHAVISVASA 

287 

WHY SHOULD INTENSE FAITH BE CALLED AN 

ANGA INSTEAD OF MERE FAITH ? 

In this connextion, some others may contend as follows:--- “When the believer has faith in what is stated in the sāstras, what is the meaning of saying that there is something else called 'intense faith' or mahüvisvāsa? Therefore there is no point in bolding that this mahāvisvõsa is anything other than the faith in the sāstra which is general and that it is & special anga or accessory of pra. patti. This contention (or objection) is refuted by the well-known fact that there are degrees of faith as stated in the sloka:"One should never place confidence in a man whom one does not trust. Even in a man whom one trusts, too much confidence should not be reposed." It is also refuted by the text which prescribes extra ordinary faith as an anga or accessory (in regard to prapatti ). 

Bhagavan Narada has declared in Srimad Ashtakshara Brahma Vidya that there are, in different men, varying degrees of faith in the Moolamantra. (He says):- "In sproportion to the degree of faith that a man has in Ashtakshara, will be attain the fruit thereof. It is impossible to measure its greatness." The Supreme Ruler of all will ultimately protect even those prapannas who are far from perfect and whose faith is not strong enough. If authority is asked for this statement, here it is :--"By these man who has once uttered the two syllables 'Harih' - by bim steps have been taken for entering moksha". In accordance with this, Alavandar has conveyed the same idea in the sloka :-- "Whoever' folds his hands in worship to Thee in any manner and at any time - his sios vanish at once. It generates all good things. It never fails to bear fruit," and so also, “A single" drop of the ocean of nectar called bhakti towards the two lotuses of Thy feet will extinguish instantly the spreading wildfire called samsāra and confer superior happiness". By uttering the three syllables

CHAPTER 

"Govinda", Kshatrabandu, who stood surrounded by his past kar mas swarming (like ants ), attained the highest state." As implied in these passages, Iswara will promote the perfection of the upaya And protect the man. Has not this idea been conveyed by Sri Sandilya Bhagavan to Devala in the following sloka :- "Mapy of your previous births ended in vain. Consider how this life, too, may end in vain and perform prapatti? Froin the sloka :-"The divine 43A seers say that Thou art to be sought as the Saviour and that 'Thou protectest those who have soagbt Thy protection." -- (from this sloka) it should be understood that intense faith oan be found (only) in the divine seers and not in ordinary men) and that, by the authority of what is said by the divine seers, those whose faith is not strong should strengthen it. Therefore since there are varying degrees of faith, what is stated in the stāstra about intense faith being an anga of prapatti cannot be objected to. 

CAUSES OF THE DECAY OF FAITH AND THE 

REMEDY THEREFOR 

We will now show how some people suffer from diminution of faith and state how this tendency can be corrected. Some may ask: - "How could bhakti anil prapatti lead to such opposite results is worldly prosperity and mokshi inerely because of the difference in the mental attitude (of those who adopt them)? Have we ever seen the same seed yielding two different fruits owing to the diversity of intentions in the (inind of the) sower? The answer to this question is as follows:- "The sāstra which is the (sole) authority in regard to matters pertaining to it in tbe same way as sense perception (pratyaksha) is in regard to what per. tains to it -- the sāstra cao certainly declare it to be so and reason has no right to attempt to disprove it. In worldly life, if we give an object to a charitable and generous king as an article for sale, we shall obtain a liberal return; but if it is given (without any

WILL TAE SAME UPAYA YIELD DIFFERENT FRUITS? 289 

thought of such retorn) merely as an offering or tribate, we see it produce whatever is desired (by the person). 

These two bhakti and prapatti, are of the nature of a rite prompted by pravritti (activity prompted by worldly interests), when they are adopted by a person who expects some benefit other than (moksha) and in the case of those who desire only the feet of Bhagavan, they are of the nature of & rite of renunciation (nivritti). The same holds good of such things as the rites and duties which are compulsory and regularly recurrent and those which are compulsory and occasional (ritya and naimittika), 

If it be asked whether üpasāna (bhakti) and prapatti, which are different in their nature since the former has to be repeated ooptinuously (till death) and the latter to be performed only once -- whether these two could yield the same fruit; the answer is as follows:- "It is certainly poosible, since it depends upon the competency of the person (adopting the upāya), as in worldly life and in the Vedic tradition. 

To those aspirants to mukti who have adopted prapatti as an independent and direct means, the upaya (means) and the end (which is) moksha, namely, the attainment of Bhagavan are one and the same (i. c) Bhagavan. However, owing to the degree of urgency (tvarā) in the desire for moksha which arises from the suffering of samsūra, there may be delay or absence of delay in the attainment of the fruit in accordance with the time when it is respectively desired by the persons concerned (viz.) ārta and dripta). 

The reason why the Alvars, Nathamuni and the like obtained such things as direct vision (sākshñtkāra) of Bhagavan, while others who adopted prapatti had to go without it is (two fold)--the diffe rence in the desire for the fruit expressed at the time of prapatti and also the difference in the past good karma which had begun to operate in this life. 

290 CHAPTER 

Though that part of the fruit formerly desired is certain owing to the performance of prapatti on a single occasion, yet, if a person eagerly desires some other part of the fruit pot desired before, & further prapatti is also appropriate. 

2. Some critics may entertain doubts in regard to the effective dess of prapatti which is the means of attaining all benefits without exception, when it is found that some forms of prapatti intended to secure tangible benefits in this life itself fail to do so. These critics should be made to understand that if there is no effect, it is due to some defect in the activity (karma), in the doer (karta) or in the means or accessories ( südhana ), just as in the case of other rites prescribed in the sāstras. (For instance, the s'āstra says, “He who desires rain should perform a yajna with kariri (bamboo sprouts )". If the rain does not follow the yajna, it must be due to some defect in the performance of the karma, in the doer, or in the sacrificer or in the acoessories or sadhanas employed in the sacrifice). Defect in the performance (of prapatti) consists in the lack of intense faith, (mahüvisvūsa ), and the like, Defect in the doer consists in the absence of coinpetency prescribed for prapatti. Defect in the sadhunas or accessories is the absence of such things as the teaching of the wise which is essential for the performance of prapatti in accordance with the süstras. When prapatti is done without any of these defects, we see even the attainment of visible and (tangible) fruits that have been desired as the result.

Yet others might contend as follows:-"Such sages as Vyasa who are alike the expounders of all siistras including the stāstra on prapatti state:-- "Attor" studying all the sāstras and after frequent investigation of their meaning with the help of reason, this one truth alone becomes evident: Narayana should always be meditated on," "Hari "Salone is fit to be meditated on always by people like you who are sāttvikas." " Vishnu " is cons

tantly to be ineditated on. He should never be forgotten." When they have arrived at this conclusion, how could it be said that, by the performance of prapatti on a single occasion, moksha could be attained? The passage in the Gita which saya :- " Those 46A who perform prapatti to me alone, get over mīyā which cannot be easily got over -- this passage and others like it refer to prapatti which is an anga or accessory to bhakti (upāsana) or meditation, Similarly such texts as the Charama sloka should be considered as prescribing prapatti with its accessories only as an anga of bhakti". This contention of theirs is inappropriate. (For it has been said): " Those who are incapable of meditation (upāsana or bhakti) and seek Thee as their upüya-even they cross over samsāra and enter Thy abode, Vaikunta,” “Whatever object is desired, by whatsoever person and whatever cannot be obtaised by other means, and that moksha from which abode there is no return and which cannot be attained by karma yoga, jiūnayoga, or bhakti yoga, all these fruits are obtained, O great sage, by those who respectively strive for them by the performance of prapatti. The Supreme Self is attained only thereby." As stated in these passa ges, if prapatti adopted as a direct and independent upāya is well established, the prapanna acquires, as its reward, the capacity to meditate constantly on Narayana as stated in Sri Vaikunta gadya. This is just like milk being a suitable drink for both the healthy man and the man who is in ill-health. Though meditation (upāsana or bhakti) with its (Vedic) angas is not within the competency of every one, yet it is not impossible for everyone to meditate on the Lord in such measure as is possible for one with his competency, as may be seen in the passage - "May 1, "as the result of Thy will, be endowed with the power of constantly medita ting un Thee!" The author of Sri Bhashya, too, after teaching this upāya (prapatti) in his smaller gadya (Sri Ranga gadya) and in the longer gadya (Saraņāgati gadya) and referred to it briefly in the Vaikuntagadya, is pleased to teach this form of

meditation so that the desire for the end in view may gain in strength without suffering any diminution. He does so in the passage which begins as follows: "In order to that one may continue to live the life of the spirit, one should meditate in this manner," 

THE RITES NITYA AND NAIMITTIKA ARE, 

ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN UP 

BY THE PRAPANNA: 

The author of Sri Bhashya has also described in his Nitya the special form of worship (poojā) which is referred to in "I spent'l my time in studying the books which mention the attributes of the Lord, in listening to others reading them and in worshipping Him," (The description) begios (with the sentence):- "I will now explain the manner in which the man with exclusive devotion to Bhagavan should perform the adoration (ārādhana) of the Lord, Having become a worshipper with supreme and exclusive devotion to Him and with a desire only to serve Him", he goes on to say, "Remain meditatingó (on the Lord) with a vision as clear as 

visual perception and with extreme love ( to Him)". 

This service to the Lord wbich is the overflow of vninterrupt. ed meditation and seeks no other interest or profit and wbich consists in five forms of service io the course of the day, is in accord with what is enjoined in the scripture of Bhagavan (Bhagavat Sastra ) and with what has been prescribed by Vyasa, Daksha and other great sages. It is also inplicit in the following Tamil verses: "Giving up anger and deceit and controlling the senses, 53Aone should perform adoration five times in the day", as commented on by the acharyas. "Approaching" the Lord in the morning (abhigamana), then proceeding to collect the materials required for his worship

(upādāna); next performing the adoration (@radhana), afterwards uttering the sacred mantras (japa); lastly meditating on the Supreme Lord (dhyāna); thas in the aforesaid five parts of the day, I will spend my days adoriag Him with the good incense and flowers gathered by me with my own effort." Having heard, from the author of Sri Bhashya, this five-fold division of the day and what should be done in each, Vangipuram Nambi briefly summarised it in his Nitya in the words quoted above. This may be seen also in the treatise on daily life written by Periajeer and others. Any differences that might appear in these descriptions are easily ex. plained as due to differences found in different Samhitas. 

Hence the prapanna should spend his time in accordance with such sāstraic scheme of life as has been taught by his acharya in rendering service to Bhagavan with no other purpose than to please Him. (In this context the following passages may be borne in mind):- "I do not desire to go to the divine world leaving Thee; oor do I desire to enjoy immortality so also without Thee, I have no desire for the glory which comes of ruling the world". “ You will benjoy yourself with Sita on the slopes of the moun tains. I will render all service to you whether you are awake or asleep". "I mays be born to any one in whatever family; (wher ever I may be born), may I have the eager longiog to enjoy the pleasure of rendering service to Thee! I will never do anything on behalf of any other deity with my body, mind, speech or head". "The only object that I have in view is that the Lord should take me into His service for His owd pleasure." 

This daily worship of Bhagavan consisting of abhigamana (apprnach) (and the four other duties) should not be done for the sake of such things as vanity, gain or honours as done by up believers; nor should it be done for the sake of any other object in

view (than pleasing Bhagavan, as may be done by those wbo have no knowledge of the truth and have not yet acquired freedom from the desire for worldly pleasures (vairāgya) and other such virtues. Without any desire even for the attainment of moksha as by those who adopt bhakti yoga but bave not completed it, if this mode of worship is performed with the sole desire of doing what is agreesble to the Lord for its own sake, as it is done by those who have already attained mukti, this abhigamana (approach) and other things will shield the prapanna from the approach to other deities (abhigamana), from activities for the sake of other inte. rests (upadana), from yajnas to other deities, from words about other (deities ) and from meditation (dhyāna ) of the other deities. 

Perialwar bas pointed out that there will be no approach to other deities (abhigamana) in the following verse - "Now to that I have the austerity (tapas) of rendering service to Thee, it would be a detraction from Thy glory, if I were hereafter to stand with bowed head in front of the house of any other. Kindly note", He has also pointed out that there will be no activity for securing other things (upādāna) in the verge :-- "I will not so beg of Thee food for eating or cloth for wear." That there will be no yajna or sacrifice to others is brought out in passages like these :- "She's will never adore any deity other than Bhagavan even in her thoughts”, “Who else® merits our flowers and our adoration than our Lord ?" "(The 6 worship of other deities than Bhagavan) is like washing & wooden doll when ones' mother is at band to be served", and "O men" of the world who neglect Bhagavan and worship jivas as if they were deities! Are you washing a wooden doll with warm water when similar service can and should be rendered to the mothers that gave you birth? Are you without the grace of the Lord tbat you cannot render service to Him ?." In the discourse of the seven sages also, it has been declared thus :

KAINKARYA TO DEVOTEES

“He wbo \*bas stolen the \*bulb of the lotus - let bim worsbip other deities than Vishnu, who does good to Brahmins, who exercises control over the gods, who is worshipped by all those who live in the three worlds, who is the cause of the creation, the maintenance, and the destruction of the three worlds, who is under the control of no one else, who is the support of the world and who both creates and destroys the world, and who is the guru of the world," and again, “He who has stolen the bulb of the lotus - he is one who never performs those dharnias which please the Lord, who never favours them, and who is of such a nature that he practises evil dharmas and evil rites." That the prapanna will never utter the praise of others is declared in verses like the follow. ing:--Tiruvoymozhi 3-9 and also in: "The mouth will never sing the praise of any one other than the Lord.” So also that the prapanna will never think of others is declared in the following passages :-"My thoughts are never with any deity other than the Lord. Bhagavan who helps the gods is aware of this." and "I will" never think that there are other deities that I want to attain and that will come to me." 

(Our ancient seers) have declared that even those who are not competent to perform this five-fold schewe of adoration may not fail to render this service or kainkarya, if they will perform such compulsory and occasional rites as they are competent for, if they sing the praise of the Lord and the like and if they render service to such persons as have the competency to perform that adoration and as have exclusive devotion to the Lord in accordance with their competence and in perfect dependence on them. And this may be seen in the following passages :-“The adoration of Vishnu is

superior to all other adorations. The adoration of Vishun's devotee, which is different from it, is said to be superior even to that "; "Satagopan" is ever in the company of the servants of Bbagavan who saved Gokula with the bill (as an umbrella)" and "The tapas of those who are attached to the devotees of the Lord will surpass that of (even) those who sing the praise of the Lord." The joy of those who render this service and of those who look with delight on this service rendered by them is of the same nature as that of Iswara, who alone is competent to rule over the affairs of the world (jagad vyāpāra) and of those who have already attained inukti and merely look on. There is nothing inappropriate in this joy being the same in the case of those who perform the service and of those wbo look on it with delight, for it is just like the purifying influence described in the following sloka :-"To hears of the performance of dharma ( done by others), to see it, to think of it, to speak of it and to find delight in it - all these, O best of kings, purify always the person doing so." 

So also it is said in the Mahābhārata :-"Therefore73A & Sadra should not utter my names with the pranava (the syllable Om), and in the Nāradiyakalpa "The japa of the ashtökshara? has been prescribed, for women and for Sudras to be performed without the dative suffix thus:- (namonārüyana). Similarly there are no rules for them about the svara, about pranava and about touching the limbs (anganyāsa ). It is declared in the sāstras that for women and for Sudras, japa consists in the mere utterance of the mantra (without them)". In the Varāhapura. nam, it is said, “The pano born of the caste of those who eat dog's flesh woke up as soon as ihe day dawned, finished his obser. vance which consisted in singing the praise of Bhagavan and returned after uttering the mantra "Namo Nārāyaṇa".

24 FORM OF MEDITATION FOR ASHTAKSHARA 297 

we find the following :- " If a man goes to Vaikunta uttering the moolamantra, 'Nano Nārana' with his hands folded in reve. rence over bis head, he will dever return to the world of sansöra etc , and “If one is "to utter the name of Bhagavan, one should say "namo Narana". The middle of the sugar.cane (i.e.) Ashta. kshara with eight joints becomes suitable to everyone, if the root and the top (i.e.) the first and the last syllable are cut off. So also there is nothing inappropriate in all prapannas enjoying the delight (rasa) of thinking of Bhagavan at any time whatever. It is only for bhakti yoga, which has its angas or accessories and wbich is different from prapatti, that some are not competent. Even though prapatti becomes perfect by the rite which lasts only for a moment (we are taught) thus by the Saviour: "Always?' utter the dvaya with the thought of its iDeaning in your mind)". Therefore the command "Narayana is to be meditated on always" should be taken as an upāya for some (viz. those who adopt bhakti) and as the fruit for others, (panely prapannas). Thus the command is in Do way opposed to prapatti adopted as a direct and independent means. 

Sri Ramanuja has explained in such treatises as Sri Bhashya how prapatti is an anga to bhakti or upūsana. In the gadya he explains how prapatti can also be an independent and direct means, It is true we find the following :-"There is nothing other then yoga which can destroy such evil traits as ignorance (avidya) (and conceit)” and, “Past karmae cannot be destroyed even in ten thousand births without yoga. Only the fire of yoga can con aume away the dry grass of karma." But since prapatti has been enjoined as a direct and independent means, on the strength of that ordinance, the passages cited above (on yoga) should be consider ed as applicable only to those others who are competent for them. 

Similarly answers to other misconceptions that might arise in regard to sūdhyopāya (bhakti and prapatti) may be found in

TAMIL VERSE: 

The Sruti states at length that the Supreme Being chooses those who should win His grace; but this choice (of the jiva bound by karma for the bestowal of His grace) is based on some conside ration. Therefore we obtain redemption by the mercy of the Lord who, as antaryāmī, supports the world and, as Savivar, helps us cross the sea of samsara and by understanding clearly the good paths for winning His grace (bhakti end prapatti) as described in the s'āstras. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Those (great men) who were well-versed in the dialectical methods of rationalists wbich resemble the art of conjuring, who stand first like the little finger while counting men renowned in argument and whose thoughts have been rendered clear by the soap-out of the Upanishads and the tradition that has followed therefrom-- (those great men) have taught as, in the manner described in this chapter, that Sādhyopāya (bhakti and prapatti) are the means of securing the favour of Siddhopüya (namely 

Bhagavan ).
