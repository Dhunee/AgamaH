<p>(1) <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, who stands close to the Upaniṣads and from whom, as from the boundless ocean of mercy, came of its own accord, the <em>śloka</em> (<em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) which puts an end to the sorrows of all men, - by seeking Him as our refuge in<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> accordance with the injunction (contained in that <em>śloka</em>), and as the eternal <em>dharma</em> (<em>Siddhopāya</em>), we feel happy with our sins extinguished and free from (all) doubts and fears.</p>
<p>(2) Many are the paths prescribed (in the _śruti_s) (Karma <em>yoga</em>, <em>Jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>Bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>), they are hard to understand and impossible of adoption owing to the restrictions and observances enjoined for them; the fruit to be attained by pursuing them is at too great a distance and (above all) they are unsuitable for simple folk (destitute of intelligence and ability) to us who feel anxious on these accounts, (He who is) the easy highway, the charioteer and the guide of all men, has, by His grace, enjoined certain victuals (the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) for the journey in order to lead us to His own feet without any hindrances.</p>

<p>In order to afford salvation to all the beings created with one mind by Himself and <em>Lakṣmī</em> of shining bracelets, He became the son of <em>Vāsudeva</em> so that the beautiful city of Dwaraka might prosper. He was then pleased to be the charioteer of the princes (the Pandavas) and He has become for us the unique <em>dharma</em> (<em>Siddhopāya</em> ) which He, with Tulasi flowers adorning His chest, has Himself declared to us and puts a stop to the game of blind-man&rsquo;s buff which stood in the way of our seeing, enjoying and bearing His feet (in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em>) on our head.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO CARAMA ŚLOKA</p>
<p>This Nārāyaṇa, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who abides (for ever in the ocean of milk has left His serpent-bed and arrived at the city of Madhura.&quot; As stated in this <em>śloka</em>, the Supreme Ruler, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, incarnated in the beautiful city of Dwaraka in order to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to establish <em>dharma</em> on a firm footing; He became easily accessible to everyone, and assumed the role of a messenger to the Pandavas who had sought His protection, as stated in the passage : &ldquo;On being thus advised, the sons of Pritha and the twins made namaskarams to <em>Janārdana</em>, O best of men, along with Draupadi.&rdquo; He made Arjuna the warrior in the chariot and acted as his charioteer to do his bidding. This Arjuna realised that the Lord of all had determined to slay his enemies using him as a (mere) instrument, and that the destruction of his kinsmen was certain. He became troubled in mind by inopportune affection and inopportune compassion and by the fear that the slaying of his ācharyas and others, though they appeared (against him) in war-like trim, was a sin. So he wanted to know what was the proper thing for him to do and begged (<em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa) saying, &ldquo;Be pleased to tell me what, you feel sure, is to my lasting benefit. I am your disciple and have sought your protection. Therefore advise me as to what I should do”. In order to dispel his grief, the Lord explained to him the eternal and essential nature of the soul or self (ātman) which is different from the body and the like (the senses etc.) and likewise <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> and jnānu <em>yoga</em>, which are, to the man who understands this essential nature, the mediate means for attaining the supreme goal and also <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> which has been enjoined as the primary and direct means of attaining it, as also all its accessories. Though Arjuna was eager to attain this supreme end quickly, he thought it too hard to perform it (<em>bhakti</em> -<em>yoga</em>) with all its accessories and though he had the knowledge and the ability needed for its adoption, he realised that the nature of this <em>upāya</em> was such that it would secure</p>
<p>the end in view only after a very long period of adoption and after unceasing attention and that the end in view could not be attained quickly, So Arjuna became overwhelmed with despair. Under the guise of teaching Arjuna, the ācārya of the Gitopanishad is graciously pleased, out of His infinite compassion, to explain this most secret <em>upāya</em> (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> which is the conclusion of the teaching and which leaves nothing unsaid. <em>Prapatti</em> which is one of the _upāya_s that be enjoined as optional in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;I can be attained by those who desire to serve me only by <em>bhakti</em>  or by <em>prapatti</em>. There is no other way of attaining ine&rdquo;, is the means alike, of attaining His feet and all other things that are desired, for it has been said, “Only so long as <em>prapatti</em> which extinguishes all sins is not performed, only so long will there be suffering, etc.&rdquo; It can be performed without any accessories other than the determination to do what is agreeable to the Lord and the avoidance of what is adverse to Him and the like. It is easier of performance and can be done in just an instant. Since the Supreme Lord, who is the Saviour, has Himself taught this truth which is well known from the _śruti_s, it has also the sanction of the ācārya (for <em>Bhagavān</em> is Himself the ācārya here). The permission of the ācārya is prescribed in such treatises as <em>Viṣṇutattva</em> as follows: - &ldquo;Giving up all object of desire and the karmas by which they can be secured, <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> with its five _aṅga_s (the _aṅga_s and the <em>aṅgī</em> being six ) should be performed with the permission of the ācārya in accordance with the rules prescribed in the _śāstra_s and with renunciation of the fruits of all actions.”</p>
<p>_SARVADHARMĀN ETC._page526</p>
<p>We have refuted, at considerable length, in Tātparyachandrikā and <em>Nikṣepa</em>-rakshā, the interpretations given of this <em>śloka</em> by such perverse (commentators ) as Sankara. Here we will state the best and most appropriate meanings as established in the tradition of wise men. The first half of this (<em>śloka</em>) enjoins the</p>
<p><em>upāya</em>, the second half is the <em>śeṣa</em> which is subordinate or supplementary to it by way of indication of the end to be attained (by that <em>upāya</em>). Therefore the main purport of this <em>śloka</em> is to prescribe the <em>upāya</em>. <em>Dharma</em> is a means of attaining an object which can be understood solely from the <em>śāstra</em>. The use of the plural form, <em>dharmān</em>, indicates the manifold nature of the _dharma_s enjoined in the <em>Śāstra</em> as the means of attaining the desired objects or ends. The word sarva (all) suggests that (these _dharma_s) have certain accessories or _aṅga_s. There is certainly no impropriety in calling the accessories to <em>dharma</em> by the word <em>dharma</em>. If (on the other hand) we interpret the word sarva (all) as the opposite of &lsquo;one&rsquo;, it would indicate the manifoldness of the _aṅgī_s (the _dharma_s themselves).</p>
<p>Though the word <em>dharma</em> is used without any qualification or restriction, yet what is intended (by the word) here is the various kinds of <em>upāsana</em>, or ineditation prescribed for the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> in the _śāstra_s with all their accessories (such kinds of meditation as dahara <em>vidyā</em>, sadvidyā and <em>Śāṇḍilyavidyā</em>). The knowledge of <em>Puruṣottama</em> (which is praised highly in the Gitā (Chap. XI) is conclusively shown in (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s) Gitābhāṣya and elsewhere as leading merely to the knowledge of the Truth or Reality which is of help to all vidyās or forms of meditation; the knowledge of the truth concerning the avatārs (of <em>Bhagavān</em>) is shown in Ch. IV there as the cause of the adopted upāsanas yielding their fruit quickly, residence in places where there are temples of Nārāyaṇa and the like are also shown to make the _upāsana_s effective by the removal or extinction of those sins which stand in the way of the _upāsana_s bearing fruit. Therefore it is not proper to consider them as direct and primary means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and to state that the plural form of <em>dharma</em>, viz, dharmān is used to include these also, (for they are only mediate culises of <em>mokṣa</em> and not direct causes like the _upāsanā_s). This plural form dharmān is significant in as much as it refers to such different and many vidyās, as Śāṇḍilya <em>vidyā</em> and dahara <em>vidyā</em> even without the three mentioned above ((viz) the knowledge of <em>Puruṣottama</em> and of the avatars and residence in holy places , for it has been said  “The vidyās are many, as their names and the like are different;&rdquo; there is no impropriety even if we take the plural to signify the manifoldness of the <em>aṅgī</em>&rsquo;s (forms of meditation) and of the _aṅga_s or their accessories.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF PARITYAJYA (HAVING GIVEN UP). page528</p>
<p>ln the word <em>parityajya</em>, the &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; or abandonment consists in the aversion to other kinds of <em>upāya</em> (than <em>prapatti</em>), which arises from a consideration of one&rsquo;s being destitute of the competency for them, for it has been said, &ldquo;By this &lsquo;<em>prapatti</em> and with only <em>ākiñcanya</em> or one&rsquo;s being without other _upāya_s as a prerequisite etc)&rdquo;. If there is connexion due to desire, the giving up of that desire is certainly tyāga or renunciation.</p>
<p>The preposition pari (before tyaj) is to show the extreme aversion arising from the lack of competence (for other _upāya_s ) at all times and in every form, which the person destitute of _upāya_s has come to realise in himself as expressed in the following passages, “I see no means of crossing (the sea of sainsāra) in all the eternity of time which lies before me,&quot; and &quot; It is &lsquo;only by the lotus feet of the Lord that I shall attain the desired goal. I have no other means of attaining spiritual welfare in any of my births.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aversion in every form&rdquo; means being without the improper desire to perform what is impossible for a man with the thought: “Though I cannot adopt the <em>upāya</em> in full perfection, I will do it to the best of my ability; when that also is too difficult to perform, I will adopt, in the place of the prescribed _aṅga_s, something less difficult or the _upāya_s which will produce the prescribed _upāya_s&quot;,</p>
<p>The object of this anuvāda<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (statement of what has already occurred) namely sarva dharmān <em>parityajya</em> (which is not a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction) is to indicate the person who is specially competent to adopt <em>prapatti</em>, The preposition <em>pari</em> in <em>parityajya</em> is to indicate the person who is most competent or has full competence. In the sentence:- &ldquo;Having reached this world which is perishable and without pleasure, you should resort to me with devotion,&rdquo; having reached does not state a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction meaning - &ldquo;Reach this world&rdquo;. It only means &lsquo;Being in this world&rsquo; or &lsquo;since you are in this world&rsquo;. So also, here, the words <em>sarvadharmān parityajya</em> do not mean give up all _dharma_s&rsquo;. It should be taken to mean: &ldquo;You that have given up all _dharma_s&rdquo;. Since this usage of having done a thing&rsquo; (past participle) is met with in other senses also, it is not right to say that &lsquo;having given up all _dharma_s&rsquo; or giving up all dharnas is one of the accessories enjoined for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) is to be considered (at all) as enjoining what should be done (<em>vidhi</em>), there is nothing wrong in stating that it enjoins, as in the chapters on <em>Prapatti</em> and elsewhere, the thought of helplessness (kārpaṇya) which is of the nature of such thoughts as being destitute of upãyas. In that interpretation, <em>sarva dharmān parityajya</em> would mean &ldquo;Reflect at first on the state in which you are unfit for the adoption or performance of every form of <em>dharma</em>&rdquo; (in this case it would be a <em>vidhi</em>). This state has been (well) expressed in such passages as the following: &ldquo;l am the abode of all offences (against Thee) and I have no means of saving myself or have I anything else to attain than Thee&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I have not performed <em>dharma</em> with any constancy; I have not realised the nature of the self nor have I <em>bhakti</em>  or devotion to Thy lotus feet&rdquo;. Even this interpretation, which is not the meaning that strikes one immediately and is</p>
<p>therefore a little strained, is better than the meanings given by Sankara and others that what is intended here is such as the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves in their essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), because it is not out of keeping with any _pramāṇa_s (for in the chapters on <em>prapatti</em>, it is enjoined that the rites and observances of castes and ās&rsquo;ramas should (always) be performed).</p>
<p>When we take partyajya as a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction, it would be appropriate to say that the meaning of sarva dharmān <em>parityajya</em> is - &ldquo;No <em>dharma</em> of any kind need be performed for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>&rdquo;, in the sense that <em>prapatti</em> does not require any of them (as _aṅga_s). In that case, the use of the preposition pari would suggest that even such observances as are stated in &quot; This should be done after performing achamana&quot; and &ldquo;This should be done with bodily purity&rdquo;, which are requisite for securing fitness for all rites in common, are not to be accepted as _aṅga_s for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, if it is maintained that the giving up of such _dharma_s as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> in their essential forın (<em>svarūpa</em>) is an aṅga or accessory to <em>prapatti</em>, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> is not in the competence of any one. The abandonment of a <em>dharma</em> can be enjoined only in the case of a person who is capable of performing it. This would be opposed to the thought of helplessness ( kārpaṇya ), which is called an <em>aṅga</em> ( of <em>prapatti</em> ) according to many pramāņas. It would also be opposed to the tradition that <em>prapatti</em> is for those who are destitute of _upāya_s, which is evident from such passages as the following: &ldquo;I am without any _upāya_s and have no other saviour&rdquo;. &ldquo;I was not born into any of the four castes so as to be competent for the performance of <em>dharma</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;I have given up the rites to be performed by a Brahmin who has the mark of worshipping the three fires after ablution&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am not well established in the performance of <em>dharma</em>, nor have I realised the nature of my self etc.</p>
<p>To state that the <em>jīva</em> (kshetrajna) is eternally incapable of all other _upāya_s, since he is entirely dependent on and subject to the control of <em>Iśvara</em> and (in the same breath) to state that the giving up of these _dharma_s or _upāya_s is enjoined on him is against all s&rsquo;astras and is opposed also to the very words of these writers and their actual practice. (For how can a man give up a <em>dharma</em> which he is not capable of performing? How can a man proceed to perform <em>kaiṅkarya</em>, if he is incapable of it owing to otter dependence and subjection?). It would, therefore, be extremely ridiculous to hold this view. If this view were right, then by the same logic, even the <em>vidhi</em> contained in vraja (seek me etc.) would be impossible of performance.</p>
<p>The statement that the jīvātmā is eternally incapable of all other _upāya_s would only go to confirm the view that <em>parityajya</em> (here, does not enjoin the giving up and) only states what has already occurred (anuvāda) (owing to inability ), which these writers would not like to accept.</p>
<p>(Further) the use of a single set of words in a single sentence cannot mean both the statement of what has occurred owing to inability in the case of the man who is not capable and the injunction to the man who is capable of performance to give it up ( which is another view held by some)</p>
<p>Nor can it be held that the option is given to the same person (adhikārī) who is capable of performing <em>dharma</em> either to perform the <em>dharma</em> or to give it up. This would mean two alternative courses, one of which is difficult and the other light, when there is no difference in the object of attainment. For if the man who is capable of adopting the difficult <em>upāya</em> is enjoined to adopt the lighter or easier <em>upāya</em> by giving up the performance (of what he is capable of ), then no one would ever think of adopting the more difficult <em>upāya</em> and since there is no other way in which the difference in competency could be stated, all the _śāstra_s which enjoin the performance or adoption of the more difficult <em>upāya</em> would carry no weight,</p>
<p>It is also extremely inappropriate to say that, in order to stimulate the adoption of the easier <em>upāya</em>, the difficult <em>upāya</em> is (first) enjoined and then forbidden for performance.</p>
<p>The view that what are not (really) _upāya_s are enjoined as _upāya_s (and are thereafter condemned as unfit for performance) - this view would tend to look upon the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s as deceptive. Even such things as the essential nature of the Saviour (which we learn only from them) could not (then) be known for certain,</p>
<p>It is true that, in the world, among those that are desirous of wealth, some choose cultivation of the soil and other such difficult operations, while others choose lighter professions like dealing in rubies and other gems; but this option is determined by the differences in capacity or competence among the adhikārīs.</p>
<p>Kooarathalvan&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;You that suffer (from anxiety) because of the impossibility of adoption of other _upāya_s, give up everything that has been declared as the means of attaining me and seek me as (your) refuge (tor salvation)”&ndash;this commentary, too, means only what has been explained (as the meaning so far) and is not, therefore, opposed to it. (In that commentary &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; states only what has occurred before (anuvāda) or means only &ldquo;without doing it as an <em>aṅga</em> required for <em>prapatti</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that, in such cases, as Samāvartana or the conclusion of the <em>Prājāpatyavrata</em>, baths accompanied by certain vratas or observances are prescribed and also (as an alternative) baths without any such vratas (which are easier). But this option is determined by the condition or the circumstances in which the person is situated. If we do not take it in this light, the enjoining of the more difficult alternative would be of no use (for no one would adopt it).</p>
<p>There is another (wrong) view that the adhikārī competent for <em>prapatti</em> is the person who has fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith and that the adhikārī for <em>upāsanā</em> is the person who lacks this fullness of knowledge or fullness of faith. If this view were accepted, it would follow that such men as Vyasa who taught the churama_śloka_ and the like and who, because of their piety, had fullness of knowledge and fullness of faith should be looked upon as incompetent for <em>upāsanā</em>. There is no evidence or pramāņa to prove that when they taught, they had knowledge and faith and having (later) become weak in intelligence and faith adopted <em>upāsanā</em>. There is no evidence in the respective accounts of their lives to show that though they were prapannas (with <em>prapatti</em> as their <em>upāya</em>) they practised <em>upāsanā</em> also for setting an example to the world. Even if this were adınitted to be a fact, the adoption of a <em>dharma</em> which is forbidden to a man for the sake of setting an&rsquo; example to the world would be a sin so far as he is concerned and as the observance or adoption of the <em>dharma</em> is opposed to the man&rsquo;s competence, it would not be a proper example to set the world right. (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has explained in the Gitā <em>Bhāṣya</em> that loka sangraha consists in a man choosing one of two ways of life (permitted for himself) as being easy of performance by others and beneficial to them, and adopting that way of life as an example to others in order to establish them firmly in it. A sannyāsin adopting the way of life peculiar to the house-holder and forbidden to himself is not setting an example for the sake of the betterment of the world (lokasangraha). This would be only the violation of the commandment (of the Lord). In the same way, the adoption by a <em>prapanna</em> of a <em>dharma</em> forbidden to him, under the misapprehension that it would be a form of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> is also opposed to his competency:</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong in a <em>prapanna</em> performing those rites that are prescribed in the _śāstra_s and that are not required for <em>prapatti</em> with the idea that they are (forms of) <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (service).</p>
<p>If it is maintained that as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory of <em>prapatti</em>, men should give up all _dharma_s (rites and observances) appropriate to their respective castes (and _āśrama_s) and capable also of being performed by them, it would follow that they would lose the fruit viz, the <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service appropriate to their respective caste, <em>āśrama</em> and the like, in the period after <em>prapatti</em>; (it would also follow) that they should give up also such _dharma_s as non-violence and speaking the truth which are common to all and the showing of reverence to ācharyas and roam about like cattle, beasts and birds.</p>
<p>It may be argued that _dharma_s which are of the nature of refraining (from actions) and which are understood from prohibitory texts (such as do not kill ) are not activities calculated to protect oneself and are therefore not opposed to <em>prapatti</em> and that, owing to this what is intended here is only the giving up of such activities as are positive (pruvritti) (and not mere abstentions from activity). This argument, too, is unsound. <em>Nivṛtti</em>, abstention or renunciation, is also a form of activity arising from one&rsquo;s will or determination, and it too, may occur for the sake of protecting oneself as may be seen in the world and from the Vedas. (Prohibitory texts in the Vedas presume that even abstentions are activities. Refraining from treasonable activities is often for the sake of protection of one&rsquo;s self from the penal code).</p>
<p>If it be held that, on the strength of the injunction (<em>vidhi</em>) contained in <em>parityajya</em>), the <em>prapanna</em> should give up all dhamas whether they be positive activities (<em>pravṛtti</em>) or abstentions from actions (<em>nivṛtti</em>) and that this is the real intention of the śāstras, then it would follow that the ancients who performed <em>prapatti</em> and those who are prapannas today have done and are doing what is against the _Śāstra_s in performing different kinds of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (<em>pravṛtti</em>) and in performing expiatory rites for offences (committed by them) (for what is forbidden should, on that view, be performed and no expiation would be necessary for it). These men who are propagators of the tradition of <em>prapatti</em> in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s and who are also supremely compassionate could, under no stretch of imagination, be thought of as deluded or deceitful.</p>
<p>It may be argued that this objection would stand only if the giving up of all _dharma_s (rites and observances) is enjoined (on the <em>prapanna</em>) for the rest of his life, and that it would not hold good, if the giving up of all _dharma_s in their essential form (<em>svarūpa</em>) is considered as an <em>aṅga</em> (of <em>prapatti</em>) to be done only at the time of performing <em>prapatti</em> and if their resumption is permitted after that performance. The answer to this argument is as follows:- &quot; There is no need at all to enjoin the giving np of an activity or of an abstention which is not likely to be present at all at that time. If only such activities or _dharma_s in their <em>svarūpa</em> as are likely or possible at the time are enjoined to be given up, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> should be performed after giving up such things as the following :&ndash; residence in holy places sacred to <em>Bhagavān</em>, the tuft of hair, the sacred thread (yajñopavīta) and the wearing of the mark of the sect (puṇḍra).</p>
<p>Therefore the proper interpretation of the <em>vidhi</em> (if it be taken as <em>vidhi</em>) enjoining the giving up is this: &ldquo;<em>Prapatti</em> does not require, as an <em>aṅga</em> or accessory, any <em>dharma</em> or observance or rite which is required as an <em>aṅga</em> (such as <em>karma</em>) to <em>upāsana</em> (meditation) according to vidyās”.</p>
<p>Even in this view that <em>parityajya</em> indicates a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction to give up, the person competent for <em>prapatti</em> is one who is incapable of other _upāya_s, or one who, though capable of other _upāya_s, is too impatient to endure the delay in attaining the fruit (which the other _upāya_s might entail). If we take this view, it will not be against any of the _pramāṇa_s (viz. those which enjoin the rites of the varṇas and _āśrama_s, and those which enjoin <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> and the like). Former _ācārya_s did not discuss the point whether or not the giving up of all _dharma_s in their essential forn is an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em>. Their discussions were confined only to the question of which words in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> respectively indicated the qualification necessary for <em>prapatti</em> viz. that of being destitute of other _upāya_s and which words the idea that <em>prapatti</em> did not require (any <em>aṅga</em> or accessory).</p>

<p>Soine_ācārya_s, who were conversant with the requirements of a sentence, thought that the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> speaks first (in <em>parityajya</em>) of the person competent for <em>prapatti</em> (as one who is unable to adopt other _upāya_s) and then declares by the word ‘ekam’ we alone) that <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> does not require anything else as <em>aṅga</em> or accessory. Others said that the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> speaks first of <em>prapatti</em> not requiring anything else as <em>aṅga</em> and then declares who the competent person is for the easier <em>upāya</em> in the word vraja) by the suggestion contained in the word śoka or grief (in mā śuchaH) (for the grief should be the grief due to the man&rsquo;s inability to adopt other _upāya_s). (There was no discussion among these earlier āchāryas of the point whether <em>prapatti</em> enjoined the giving up of all _dharma_s (even such as those ordained for the varṇas and the āśramas). Thus the discussion was confined only to the way in which the words (in the <em>śloka</em>) should be construed, though there was no difference in the meaning as a whole, and the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> did not stop the discussion. What was (wrongly) imagined as having been the subject of discussion by other people who did not know what had formerly taken place &ndash; that was shown to be without any foundation by such teachers as Vishṇuchitta.</p>
<p>But it may be asked how the difference between those who are competent and those who are not competent (for <em>prapatti</em>) could be justified in the face of such _śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who do not understand; this is also the <em>upāya</em> for those who know well: this is the <em>upāya</em> for those who want to reach (quickly) the shore beyond <em>samsāra</em> and this is the <em>upāya</em> also for those who want (immediately) to render constant service to the Lord&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hari is the only <em>upāya</em> to those who do not know of other _upāya_s, either with their ignorance or with their knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord (of all), and on account of intensity of <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;. The answer to this question is as follows:- The ajñānam or ignorance referred to in the word (<em>ajñānāt</em>) in <em>Lakṣmī</em> Tantra and <em>avidyātah</em> in Bhattar&rsquo;s <em>śloka</em> is not the ignorance of such beings as cattle of what is stated in the _śāstra_s. It means only this much, lack of a clear understanding of such forms (of adoration) as _upāsana_s or ignorance, even in regard to <em>prapatti</em>, of subtle niceties or distinctions in it. The word <em>vijānatām</em> in _Lakṣmī_tantram (to those who know) and ‘<em>deve paribṛḍatayā viditayā’</em> (with the knowledge of such qualities of the Lord as His being the Lord of all) refer only to the kind of knowledge which enables one to understand such things as _upāsana_s or the kind of knowledge which enables a man to have a clear understanding of such things as the qualities of the Saviour, which is necessary for <em>prapatti</em>. It does not (certainly) mean a knowledge of all things, in general, for only the knowledge of the Saviour&rsquo;s quality of being the Lord of all is referred to here. Even if a man has this knowledge that is essential (for <em>upāsana</em>), when he is without the ability to adopt that (<em>upāsana</em>), he is one that is destitute of _upāya_s (akinchan) and has competency for <em>prapatti</em>,</p>
<p>Here another objection might be raised, viz.,&rdquo; Even if a man has ( the knowledge and) the ability, he should remain without any endeavour on his own part, knowing as he does, the Saviour&rsquo;s nature, for does not Sītā say:- &ldquo;If <em>Śrī</em> Rāma&rsquo;, who can destroy the hosts of his enemies, discharges his arrows on Lanka and takes me away from here, it will be the appropriate thing for him?&rdquo;. The answer to this is that (Sītā&rsquo;s attitude ) would be an example of the <em>prapanna</em>&rsquo;s later life (not of what he should do or should not do before <em>prapatti</em>). If this is not admitted, all _Śāstra_s which enjoin the adoption of _upāya_s would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Even when a man has both the knowledge of the other <em>upāya</em> (viz. <em>upāsana</em>) and the ability to adopt it, if he is too impatient to brook delay in the attainment (of the end), he may be competent for performing <em>prapatti</em>, if he thinks that only <em>prapatti</em> would secure his object reco, (the quick attainment). This (that even the man who has the knowledge and ability to adopt <em>upāsana</em> may adopt <em>prapatti</em> if he cannot lirook delay) is disclosed in the words: &quot; This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who want to cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;for those who want to cross&rsquo;, here, means &ldquo;Those who want to reach the shore beyond <em>samsāra</em> quickly (i.e.) those that desire a quick removal of the hindrances that stand in their way. “This is the <em>upāya</em> for those who desire <em>ānantyam</em>&rdquo; (the perfect enjoyment of the service of <em>Brahman</em>) which is one&rsquo;s due on account of one&rsquo;s essential nature. Here also the meaning is &rsquo;those who desire to have it quickly&rsquo; (i.e. those who cannot brook existence without that enjoyment.)</p>
<p>Having these two in mind, Bhattar says, &ldquo;by the intensity of their <em>bhakti</em>.&rdquo; Here <em>bhakti</em>  does not signify <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>, but &lsquo;intensity of the love (of the Lord)&rsquo;. Intensity of <em>bhakti</em>  or love means a state of mind in which the man would cease to exist if he could not have quick attainment. Though this is not the <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> enjoined for some adhikārīs, yet some get that state of mind by the grace of <em>Bhagavān</em> due to righteous acts (in previous births). The man who has this state of mind is also competent for <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore <em>prapatti</em> may be adopted by (1) those who do not know of other _upāya_s and who have a knowledge of what <em>prapatti</em> is in general (without a knowledge of details and distinctions); (2) those who have a clear understanding of <em>prapatti</em> and the other <em>upāya</em> (<em>upāsana</em>) but lack the ability to adopt the latter; (3) those who, though they have both the knowledge and the ability, cannot brook delay (in the attainment of the end) and cannot exist without it. This man who cannot brook delay is also destitute of _upāya_s for attaining the end in his view at the time when he wants it (so he, too, is competent for <em>prapatti</em>). It is in consideration of this circumstance that (Bhattar) wrote:- &quot; who know of no other <em>upāya</em> in the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Vyasa and others who held administrative offices (under the Lord) could brook delay and were also capable of the other <em>upāya</em> (i.e.) <em>upāsana</em>. Therefore it is that they adopted <em>upāsana</em> and not because they were wanting in knowledge or in faith. (Those who hold administrative offices must serve their full period before thinking of attainment.)</p>

<p>(If it be asked, &ldquo;Why is it said ( in some places) that a man adopts <em>upāsana</em> owing to weakness of intelligence?&rdquo; the answer is as follows):-&rdquo; When a man is incapable of an <em>upāya</em> which is extremely difficult of adoption and yet adopts it because of an obstinate desire, the ignoring of the easy <em>upāya</em> should be considered as being due to weakness of intellect.” Or it is proper also to explain their adoption of the difficult <em>upāya</em> as due to their unfitness for <em>prapatti</em> (owing to their lack of faith in it and the like.) This is not the explanation in the case of Vyasa and others (adopting <em>upāsana</em>), for they remove all the doubts of others (and cannot be considered as wanting in knowledge or faith).</p>
<p>Since in this manner the competency of a man either for <em>upāsana</em> or for <em>prapatti</em> is determined, both the _śāstra_s (those of <em>upāsana</em> and those of <em>prapatti</em>) have their own respective purpose.</p>
<p>The difference between the two adhikāris in regard to the rites and observances of their caste and disrama is only the difference of the purpose for which or the thought with which they are performed. It is true that, in the case of the prapanila, the performance of any rite or observance will prevent the attainment of his eod, because, like the <em>Brahma</em> missile, it would cease to have any effect, if any other rite is performed to attain the same end. But if these rites are performed for their own sake (without the desire for any fruit) or for such things as the glory of <em>Bhagavān</em> or the welfare of Bhāgavatas, there is no impropriety (and <em>prapatti</em> would not lose its efficacy).</p>
<p>But it may be asked by some:-“Even if it is admitted that the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves is not enjoined, it is possible that ‘<em>parityajya</em>’ ( having given up) may mean the giving up of (only) the thought that they are _upāya_s. (The answer to this question is as follows:) &ldquo;In those tests which refer to the activities of the <em>prapanna</em> after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, it may be held rightly that what is ordained is the giving up of the thought that these activities are _upāya_s. But the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> is a text which enjoins an <em>upāya</em> (before <em>prapatti</em>) and not what should be done after it, and the word <em>parityajya</em> occurs there, Therefore this interpretation would result in the injunction that these _dharma_s in their essential form should be performed as _aṅga_s or accessories to <em>prapatti</em>, but without the thought that they are _upāya_s. If this view were accepted, then, the view that certain things should be performed after <em>prapatti</em> merely for their own sake (without any aim, object or the desire for any fruit) and as mere service (to the Lord) would become untenable. (For they would still be _aṅga_s or accessories and could not be an end in themselves ). Nor could there be, in that case, the absence of any requisite or accessory <em>dharma</em> which is said to be the unique feature of <em>prapatti</em> Thus this <em>upāya</em> would cease to be within the competence of the man destitute of all _upāya_s. This is how it would result. There is no need to enjoin here the giving up of the thought of their being _upāya_s in regard to those _dharma_s that are not _upāya_s. So the performance of those _dharma_s which are _upāya_s without the thought that they are _upāya_s would only be the adherence to such _upāya_s as the old _upāsana_s. If it is maintained that the word <em>parityajya</em> means the giving up of the thought of their being _upāya_s, then there would have been no need to reconcile the conflicting statements about the ordinance concerning abandonment and that about performance by saying that the difference is due to the persons competent for each of them. It is only if the text is held to enjoin the giving up of the _dharma_s themselves, there would arise any such conflict. If it is held that the adoption of <em>karma</em>, <em>jñāna</em> and <em>bhakti</em> , but without the thought that they are _upāya_s is an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>, there would be no essential difference between the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>. The difference would only be nominal.)  the man who has <em>bhakti</em>  as the main and independent means and <em>prapatti</em> as an accessory to it could be called a <em>bhakta</em> and the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as the main and independent means and <em>bhakti</em>  as an accessory to it would be called a <em>prapanna</em>, but both would perform the same _dharma_s and there would be no difference in their action.</p>
<p>It may be argued that, in regard to accessory activity, there need not be fullness or perfection of performance and that some short-comings might be allowed therein ; but this argument is not sound. Has it not been stated:-&ldquo;A rite or observance performed for the attainment of a certain fruit will yield the desired fruit, only when all the accessory rites or _aṅga_s are duly performed?&rdquo; (<em>Pūrva Mīmāmsā</em>).</p>

<p>Thus if it is stated that the _dharma_s themselves in their essential forn should be given up, even the rendering of service would become an offence. If it is said that what is to be given up is only the thought that they are _upāya_s, then the _dharma_s in their essential form would become an <em>aṅga</em> (of <em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>It is only those who have forgotten the episodes<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of Kakasura and the like that world maintain, as _aṅga_s of <em>prapatti</em>, these _dharma_s without the thought that they are _upāya_s and that the person is himself the doer of the action and its beneficiary (for the doership and the benetit are God&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>We have (also ) heard that, by a single performance alone of <em>prapatti</em> far removed from any other <em>dharma</em>, the ancients obtained at once what they desired.</p>
<p>If it is maintained that the _aṅga_s of <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em> which might be presumed as necessary also for <em>prapatti</em> are declared to be not necessary for <em>prapatti</em> and as being no _aṅga_s to it, the potency of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>), which is equal in might to the <em>Brahma</em> missile, becomes well established and the rendering of service and the like will also become appropriate.</p>
<p>Therefore the view that here (in <em>parityajya</em>) the giving up of all _dharma_s, (rites, observances and the like) is enjoined (for <em>prapatti</em>) and the view that what is enjoined to be given up is only the thought of their being _upāya_s and the thought that they are _aṅga_s to it &ndash; these views conflict with such _śāstra_s as ordain the observance of the commandments, with the _śāstra_s which state that <em>prapatti</em> does not require anything else, with the traditional observances of former _ācārya_s and with the code of conduct followed by virtuous men in former times who had become prapannas. Thus owing to the objections pointed out so far, the giving up of all _dharma_s is not an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em> ; nor is the performance of these _dharma_s in their essential form an <em>aṅga</em> (without the thought of their being _upāya_s or _aṅga_s to <em>prapatti</em>), because as has been stated before, <em>prapatti</em> does not require the performance of any other <em>dharma</em>. Therefore this injunction or ordinance about ‘giving up&rsquo; (<em>tyāga</em>) has, for its purport, the statement that <em>prapatti</em> does not require any (aid) from any other <em>dharma</em>.</p>
<p>To make this denial, there must be a wrong presumption of something that has to be denied. If it is asked what _dharma_s (rites, observances and the like) are presumed (wrongly) as being requisite and are then stated to be unnecessary (the answer is as follows) - In the vidyās or forms of meditation (upāsanas) enjoined in Vedanta, some of the accessories which appear as _aṅga_s in certain _vidyā_s, such as the rites, duties and observances of the _varṇa_s and the _āśrama_s and also such things as meditation on the route to <em>mokṣa</em> are required also in other _vidyā_s or forms of meditation. So also there may, at first, be a (wrong) presumption that in _nyāsa_vidyā too, these might be required as accessory. To correct this presumption, here (in <em>parityajya</em>), these _dharma_s which might be thought of (wrongly) on the analogy of _upāsana_s as _aṅga_s (to <em>prapatti</em>) are not required for it. This is the right interpretation of the text here.</p>
<p>Though these _dharma_s cannot be considered as accessory aids (to <em>prapatti</em>) as they are stated to be for <em>upāsana</em> in <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (3.4 -33), yet as stated in another <em>sūtra</em> (3 - 4 - 32), the karmas ordained for the different _āśrama_s have to be performed, as they are enjoined as ordinances or commands; there is nothing to prevent their perfornuance by the <em>prapanna</em> (since commandments have to be obeyed as such (and for no other reason).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: page543</p>
<p>Therefore, as neither the performance of these _dharma_s nor their giving up is an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>; to be without the desire to do what is beyond one&rsquo;s ability is a mark of competency (for <em>prapatti</em>). The performance of those duties or rites which are <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> and which are within the range of one&rsquo;s ability takes rank as mere service consisting in the observance of a command,</p>

<p>It is only the thought or the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord that is stated (in the _Śāstra_s) as an <em>aṅga</em> of <em>prapatti</em>, The action arising out of that will or thought is not an <em>aṅga</em>. The rites of the varṇa and āśrama are the proper thing to do in virtue of their being the Lord&rsquo;s command and not because it is the consequence of the will or the thought to do what is pleasing to Him,</p>
<p>If so, it may be asked: &ldquo;What is the purpose or object of performing those manifold and great acts of service which cannot be included among the commands to perform <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> <em>karma</em> ?&rdquo; These cannot be included among any of the other _upāya_s for <em>mokṣa</em> (because they are not performed with the object of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>); nor are they _aṅga_s or accessories to <em>prapatti</em>, because it does not require any such _aṅga_s or aids. The person does not perform them because of the fear that the Lord would be offended at their non-performance, nor does he perform them with the desire that they would bring about, by themselves, extinction of his sins or the attainment of such fruits as <em>svarga</em>, cattle, children and the like. Neither does he perform them merely for his own delight just like worldly men playing dice and the like, nor does he perform them to please the Lord having seen, like the freed souls, by actual observation, what would be approved of by Him. If so, why does he perform them, it may be asked. (The answer is as follows) - He proceeds to perform them because it is evident from the _śāstra_s that these acts of service have, for their fruit, the propitiation of the Lord (just like other fruits) As one in whose nature the quality of <em>sattvam</em> predominates, he acquires a taste for pleasing the Lord and follows the light shed by the lamp of the śāstras in trying to give delight to the Lord who stands in varied relationships to him (as father, mother etc.), in the same way as he shows his love to his friends, children and the like.</p>
<p>In this connection some may ask :- &ldquo;In the case of the wise man who has made a complete surrender of all responsibility to the Lord of all, is not the criterion for deciding what should be given up and what taken up, the knowledge of his own essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>?) So he is bound (only) by the knowledge of his own essential nature (to do or not to do this or that); why, then, should he follow the dictates of the _śāstra_s?&rdquo;. This question is improper, for, if it is determined what his essential nature is with the help of the śāstras, then there is no other guide for him than the _śāstra_s, until the time of his attaining <em>mukti</em>, to help him to understand what aims in life he should avoid as also the _upāya_s therefor, and what aims he should have and also the _upāya_s for securing these aims. From the knowledge that he is <em>śeṣa</em> to the Lord and the like, it is just possible to know a few things that are appropriate to the <em>śeṣa</em>. The knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature cannot indicate, unequivocally, in what manner service should be rendered in order that it may please the <em>śeṣī</em>, and what _upāya_s should be adopted for this service. This being so, if one ignores the _Śāstra_s and renders service with forbidden substances (like opium, say) or even among substances that are permitted, to render service with substances acquired unjustly and thus render service according to one&rsquo;s own sweet will and pleasure in ways opposed to what is enjoined in the śāstras, then there would be no difference between reverential conduct and offence. Then since there is no criterion besides one&rsquo;s own taste, one might think of performing as service all that is considered as forbidden and therefore avoided by seekers after <em>mukti</em>. The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has stated (in regard to the offering of food (<em>havis</em>) to Archi):- &quot; Having &ldquo;collected those things which are not prohibited in the _śāstra_s etc.&rdquo; Therefore the proper thing is to render such forms of service as are enjoined in the _Śāstra_s as competent to the person concerned and subject to the dictates of the _śāstra_s. The teaching contained in the <em>śloka</em> :- &ldquo;To know what ought to be done and what ought . not to be done, the only authority that you have is the <em>śāstra</em>. Therefore while you are here, understand the <em>karma</em>  enjoined in the <em>śāstra</em> just as it is” – this teaching is common to all ( whatever their competency). <em>Śrī</em> Alavandar in his Gitarthasangraha says:-&ldquo;Among these ekantins ( who are devoted exclusively to the Lord), the wise man (jnani) is called paramaikanti, one who has supreme devotion to the Lord to the exclusion of all other interests. His being alive is solely dependent on the Lord, To be united with Him is his only delight; to part from Him is his (only ) pain. His mind is always with the Lord. He considers himself as an entity only becanse of his meditating on Him, of visiting holy places (sacred to Him), and of speaking of Him to others, of bowing to Him and uttering his sacred names. His actions are performed with his life-breath, mind, will and the senses all dedicated to Him. He performs all the duties pertaining to him and also practises <em>bhakti</em>  inspired solely by love. He should give up the idea of their being _upāya_s and place the <em>upāya</em> in the Lord without any fear&rdquo;. In these _śloka_s what Alavandar meant by the words &ldquo;inspired solely by love&rdquo; was not that he should ignore the _śāstra_s. His idea was to emphasise the great inspiration arising from his love (of the Lord), whose <em>śeṣa</em> he is, to perform those acts of service which he can understand only from the śāstras, in order to give delight to Him. When these _śloka_s are considered in relation to the man who practises _upāsana_s and the like, its aim is to show that these upāsanas are most pleasing to the person himself, that they are not the direct means of attaining the supreme end, but are the means of winning the favour of the Saviour who is the direct means or <em>upāya</em> for obtaining this end, and that the Lord of all who is pleased by these _upāsana_s stands, as the direct <em>upāya</em> for the attainment of this end. When the _śloka_s are considered in relation to the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the principal and independent means, their aim is to show that, though he performs the ordinances of <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> <em>karma</em> and such other rites just as they are enjoined for <em>bhakti</em> <em>yoga</em>, since he does not perform them for the sake of other objects like <em>svarga</em> and <em>mokṣa</em> and perforins them solely for pleasing the Lord, he has not adopted any other <em>upāya</em> (for <em>mokṣa</em> and has no other interests or object. (Their aim is also) to show that, as he is destitute of other _upāya_s, the Lord Himself stands in the place of those _upāya_s and rewards him with the desired fruit.</p>
<p>Those who have not studied Vedanta might ask (in this connection:- Both these adhikārīs (the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>) are devoted solely and exclusively to the Lord as stated (in the _śloka_s):-&rdquo; Wise men do not worship <em>Brahma</em>, Rudra and other gods, for the reward that can he given by them is limited,&rdquo; &ldquo;They are &ldquo;my devotees who have no devotion to other deities, who love those that are devoted to me and who seek me alone as their <em>upāya</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;He who has attained the lotus feet of <em>Viṣṇu</em> should not worship other deities.&rdquo; If these two adhikāris should perform the rites and observances of their castes and _āśrama_s as stated (ia Alavandar&rsquo;s _śloka_s! (viz., all the <em>karma</em> s pertaining to them and also <em>bhakti</em> ), would not their supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord be adversely affected in as much as these rites or _dharma_s are mixed up with (the worship of) such gods as Agoi and lndra?&rdquo; Here, as explained in the <em>Brahma</em> _Sūtra_s (1-2-29), names like Agni may be considered, on the authority of Jaimini, as directly referring to <em>Brahman</em> or <em>Bhagavān</em> for Agni and other such words may be etymologically derived as agram nayati. (He who receives the best part of the offering for Himself) etc. There is no worship or contact with other deities, because they are like the sacred names found in Sahasranama (etymologically applicable to <em>Bhagavān</em>). The author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> has stated in his <em>Nitya</em>:&ndash;&ldquo;Having pleased the gods, the rishis and the Manes with oblations and with the thought that they have <em>Bhagavān</em> as their inner self&rdquo; etc. So it is perfectly in accordance with the _śāstra_s to perform these respective rites meditating that the Supreme Being has the respective deities as His body In &ldquo;Pratardana <em>vidyā</em> and the like we are taught in the _śāstra_s that the Supreme Being may be meditated on (or worshipped) in three forms: (one) in His own divine and essential nature, (two), the Supreme Being as having sentient beings as His attribute (or body), and ( three) the Supreme Being as having non-sentient things as His attribute (or body). Though He is worshipped in these three ways, the worship is really to the Supreme Being and not to His attributes (or bodies) (namely . the sentient and non-sentient beings). In the same way here also, the <em>bhakta</em> or <em>prapanna</em> does not adore the gods, the rishis and the Manes, who are really attributes or bodies of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>As stated in the following _śloka_s: &ldquo;In all yajnas, it is I that am worshipped and it is also I myself that rewards (those who perforın them) with the fruits thereof,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is Thou alone that assumest the forms of the Pitrs and the gods and receivest the offerings (<em>havis</em>) (made to the gods) and the offerings (kavya) made to the Manes in sraddhas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Those who propitiate the Pitṛs, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni&ndash;they propitiate only <em>Viṣṇu</em> who is the inner self of all things&rdquo;-as stated in these _śloka_s, it is only the Supreme Being, who is the inner self of all, that is the object of adoration to the wise man. Therefore to the man who performs <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service according to the _Śāstra_s with this knowledge, there is no association with other _upāya_s; there is no association for him with other objects or purposes in acquiring the necessary substances for worship and in eating the food offered (to these gods). Similarly there is no association for him with other deities whom, obeying the injunctions (contained in the s&rsquo;astras, he worships the Supreme Being having, for His attributes, sentient beings and non-sentient things. It has been said, “ He who worships as the Supreme Being any deity other thun Nārāyaṇa who dwells in his heart, who controls him and is his Lord and Master&ndash;he is a sinner,&rdquo; &quot; He who considers Nārāyaṇa as being (only) equal to other deities &mdash;- he will stay in hell as long as the sun and the moon last”, and “One should not go near the places where Buddha, Rudra and the like are worshipped and so also near the cremation ground, near a corpse, near a forest and near the capital city of a kingdom.&rdquo; As stated (in these _śloka_s), it would be a sin for a paramaikantin if other deities are looked upon by him as the Supreme Being, if they are considered equal (to Nārāyaṇa) and if he goes to places where other deities are worshipped, when these deities have nothing to do with his <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> rites and observances. Since these deities stand in the position of bodies to the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who is the object of adoration in these sites and observances (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>), there is no thought in the mind of the man (with supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord) of these deities being the Supreme Self, of their being equal to <em>Bhagavān</em>, of their being independent of the Lord, of their being objects of adoration or of their being the dispensers of the fruits of actions. Therefore in the same way as by Prana, Vaisvanara, and the three worlds which are the attributes of the Supreme Being in the _Vidyā_s or meditations called Vaisvanara <em>vidyā</em> and the like. he is not affected, so also his exclusive devotion to the Lord is not (in the least) affected by such attributes as Agni (which are associated with these rites and observances, <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>).</p>
<p>While proceeding to state the adoration of <em>Bhagavān</em> to be performed by the <em>prapanna</em> in the day and the night, V_aṅgī_puram Nambi has described the _dharma_s of the castes and the _āśrama_s with their respective _mantra_s (in the following passages) :-&rdquo; (The <em>prapanna</em>) should spend his time by performing duly all the rites ordained for the time of the sandhyā, after sipping the water (achamana) with the prescribed _mantra_s; after this he should perform the homa to the sacrificial fires during the Agnihotra rites with the prescribed _mantra_s and with samit (fuel), ghee and other such substances. He should do every <em>karma</em>  at the time prescribed for them in the _śāstra_s&quot;. Then he says: &ldquo;He should &ldquo;perform, without being lazy, all the rites from the bath to <em>Brahma</em> yajna prescribed in the Vedas for his āśrama as fit to be done at noon&rdquo;, He continues : &ldquo;Then he should perform the prescribed yajna to the gods and to the pitṛs (Manes), after which he should eat the food offered to <em>Bhagavān</em> (which act is called <em>anuyāga</em>)&rdquo;. Bhattar and Koorathalvan, too, in their respective _nitya_s, have stated as follows:&ndash; &quot; With the vertical mark (<em>ūrdhvapuṇḍra</em>) on his forehead, (he) should perform the rites ordained in the _śruti_s, and _smṛti_s as far as it lies in his power, with the thought that they form the adoration of the Supreme Being and then offer oblations of water (tarpaṇam)&rdquo;. Peria Jeer (Nanjeer) begins by performing obeisance with the words: &ldquo;I seek the feet of Parāśara Bhattārya&rdquo;. By this he reminds us of the special tradition concerning the homage to be paid to _guru_s and the like. After this, he says “I will now describe the manner in which service should be rendered to the lotus feet of <em>Bhagavān</em> every day by men with exclusive devotion to him (<em>ekāntins</em>)”. He then says &quot; (The Ekāntin) should sprinkle water on himself by uttering the <em>mantra</em> beginning with Āpohi and then sip water (āchamana) with the utterance of the _mantra_s which denote <em>Bhagavān</em>; after this he should offer arghya to the Supreme Being who is in the sphere of the sun and then perform japa, meditating on <em>Bhagavān</em> with the <em>mantra</em> of Gāyatri. After the japa, he should offer praise to <em>Puruṣottama</em>. Oblations of water (tarpana) should then be made to the gods, the rishis and the pitṛs (Manes, who have Narayaṇa as their inner self.&quot; We see also that, in all families which follow the tradition of the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, until the present day, weddings and upanayanas (initiation with the sacred thread) have been performed in accordance with their respective (Gṛhya) sūtras, (Āpastamba and the like) with the respective _mantra_s denoting the respective deities. It is also well-known to all that the great _ācārya_s like Peria Nambi performed yajnas (sacrifices) and the like in accordance with their respective sūtras. Therefore in the case of those who follow the teaching of the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>, his disciples and their disciples, it is not proper to perforin any rites (like those of weddings) with the _mantra_s in certain samhitās following the doctrines of the Āgamas (Pāñcharātra)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> which are prescribed specially (to those who follow them).</p>
<p>We have already shown in <em>Śrī</em> Pancharātrarakshā (The Defence of <em>Pāñcarātra</em>) that the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> is of four kinds or systems <em>(Āgama Siddhānta, Mantra Siddhānta, Tantra Siddhānta and Tantrāntara Siddhānta</em>) in accordance with the competency and the like (ability) of the person concerned, that the principle holds good that what is not stated in any one of them should be taken from the others, provided there is no conflict or opposition and that, in all the four kinds of systems of Pāñcha rātra, the direct means or <em>upāya</em> of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> is set forth and that by every one of them there is the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>, just in the same way as to all the four āśramas there are <em>Brahma</em> Vidyās (<em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em>) and that to every one of them there is the possibility of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>. It has also been stated there, at considerable length, that if a person were to perform all <em>karma</em> s or rites with any _mantra_s of his own liking, ignoring what is enjoined in those sustras as the proper thing for each kind or system, he should perform expiatory rites (<em>prāyaścitta</em>) and the like. Therefore until the time of attaining <em>mukti</em>, there is no authority for rendering service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> (to the Lord) in any manner other than what is ordained in the _śāstra_s as appropriate for each adhikārī.</p>
<p>Hence since even the <em>prapanna</em> is subject to the authority of the sastrus and should perform only such service as is permitted or enjoined by them, the following (heretical) views which are opposed to the scriptures and the traditional observances (of the good) supported by right reason or logic are not to be accepted by those who desire to stand in <em>sattvam</em>. (views such as the following): (1) Both those commands that are enjoined as positive rites or actions and those that forbid certain activities should be violated ; (2) Both those activities and rites that are enjoined and those that are forbidden should be given up. (3) The rites and observances of the variṭas and āśramas are dependent only on the bodies (of Brahmins and the like) and may therefore be given up by the person who has attained a true knowledge of the essential nature of his self (which is different from the body ). (4) They may be performed or may not be performed (5) Even if they are given up, no harm will result except the loss of the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure (6) The only harm that would result in their being given up is the ill.will of society and other such (erroneous) views.</p>
<p>It is true that, as for those in the <em>āśrama</em> of the Sannyasin, to whom certain old rites and observances (of the grihasth_āśrama_) are forbidden and certain new rites and observances enjoined, (so also) for those who are Bhāgavatas, as a consequence of their being snch, certain things are forbidden and certain new things are enjoined. But no <em>karma</em>  or rite which has been ordained as compulsory of performance should (on any account) be given up. For it has been stated :- &ldquo;The man who does not perform the rites pertaining to the sandhyā is always impure and is unfit for the performance of any (other) rite. Whatever other rite or <em>karma</em>  he may perform, he will not obtain the fruit thereof”. As in the differences in the manner of performing the sandhyā meditation or worship that are found in the sūtras and the different <em>Dharma</em> <em>Śāstra_s (Manu, Āpastamba and the like) those differences that are found in the different samhitas of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>śāstra</em> (P_arcā</em>. rātra) and also such differences in the sandhya meditation as are stated in the Itihāsas and the Purāṇas &ndash; these differences should be observed respectively by those who follow these respective _Śāstra_s. Conduct like the following which is enjoined in the _śāstra_s and the Itihasas, Namely, &ldquo;At the time of the parvas, one should pray to the deities for protection&rdquo; and &ldquo;One should bow in front of places where the gods are worshipped &ndash; (conduct like this) is restricted in the case of the man who is supremely and exclusively devoted to <em>Bhagavān</em> (Paramaikantin) owing to the authority of the <em>Śāstra</em> (i,e. the only deity or God that he should pay homage to is <em>Bhagavān</em>). Therefore no <em>śāstra</em> is violated.</p>
<p>Such injunctions as the following :-&ldquo;Therefore the <em>mantra</em> called <em>aṣṭākṣara</em> should be repeated at the time of the sandhya, by pure-minded devotees of mine always in order to purify their selves&rdquo;, and &ldquo;uttering the <em>Dvaya</em> always in this manner with its meaning at heart&rdquo; in the <em>Gadya</em> - these instructions should be carried out without any conflict with the performance of the rites <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>) which are compulsory of performance and at such times as are left over after their performance, Nārada and others have also stated:-“The japa (namely, the repetition of <em>Aṣṭākṣara</em>) should be performed at such times as do not conflict with the performance of rites ordained in the _śruti_s and the _smṛti_s.&rdquo; V_aṅgī_puram Nambi, too, has said: -&rdquo; Having spent your time in performing the homa in rites like Agnihotra etc&quot; Even in his last days, the author of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> stood up with great difficulty and offered the anjali of water at the time of sandhyā. Therefore giving up the rites of the varṇas and the _āśrama_s on the pretext that they are dependent on the upadhi of the body is opposed to such things as the traditional observances of the ancients. If this pretext were sound, since even such special forms of service (in temples) as the weaving of garlands and the lighting of lamps cannot be performed without the upādhi (or conditioning factor) of the body, the senses and the like-even these would have to be given up (by the man who has realised his essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>). If the perforınance of such services is desired, the external purity (āchāra) and the purificatory rites (samskāras) which qualify (a person) for such service, cannot be given up.</p>

<p>Observing the restrictions concerning food, residence<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> (if the reading is ‘gṛha’) or receiving from the good <em>ācārya</em> the _mantra_s prescribed for the person, money<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , caste and the like, one should render service to the Lord of <em>Lakṣmī</em> in accordance with one&rsquo;s ability and with no other aim or purpose.</p>
<p>Just in the same way as a chaste wife looks after her auspicious thread, clothes and the like with the greatest care, the pra panna should preserve the path and manner prescribed in the _Śāstra_s for the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The husband takes proper care of his wife either with punishment or with favours, respectively, when she loses her thread and the like or guards them with care. So also will the Lord (his devotee for giving up or performing the enjoined rites).</p>
<p>To reflect on such things as the caste of devotees merely for the purpose of treating them with disregard will bring ruin; but if it is done only for understanding the restrictions enjoined in the _śāstra_s, there is no harm in it anywhere.</p>
<p>That is the reason why, in the _Śāstra_s, _Dharma_vyadha Tuladhara, Sabari, Vidura and others are described only by their respective castes.</p>
<p>Their conduct, too, as described in the Itihasas, was only in accordance with their castes; if there was any exceptional<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> circumstances (in their lives against the rules of their caste), it was due to the exceptional instructions or regulations. The _dharma_s or rites prescribed for a certain place, a certain period of time, a certain adhikārī and the like should not be adopted at a different place and a different time or by another adhikārī.</p>
<p>Some (people) who cannot understand the purport of certain episodes (in the Itihasas and Purāṇas) increase the <em>līlā</em> rasa which <em>Bhagavān</em> enjoys in Kaliyuga. &quot; Daughters-in-law should be treated with regard and properly adorned by their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, their husbands and so also by their brothers-in-law who desire to have varied prosperity. Those houses which are cursed by daughters-in-law on account of their ill treatment will fall into ruin as if pulled down by evil spirits&quot;. In statements like the above, the injunction about treating (the daughter-in-law) with regard has, on account of propriety, to be determined with proper restrictions in each case (the mother-in-law&rsquo;s regard is shown differently from that of the husband or the brother-in-law and so on). So also injunctions regarding the respect to be shown to devotees among mlecchas and the like have to be understood with proper reservations and restrictions.</p>
<p>These reservations and restrictions are established also by the practice of successive generations of men accepted on all hands as wise and virtuous. Therefore the performance of the Lord&rsquo;s service along with the observance of the regulations enjoined for the respective castes and _āśrama_s is not opposed to the state of supreme and exclusive devotion to the Lord (<em>paramaikāntitva</em>).</p>

<p>Even the service rendered directly to the Lord of <em>Lakṣmī</em> is surely divided by good men into two classes : valuable and worthless.</p>
<p>That (service) is declared to be valuable service which is rendered by the man who has done what he ought to do (i.e. the <em>prapanna</em>) with no other aim and for no other purpose (i.e. for its own sake) or for the protection of such persons as _guru_s.</p>
<p>That (service) is declared to be of no value which is rendered for ostentation (or vanity), for injuring others, for preventing others from rendering service or for the sake of some gain.</p>
<p>The Lord of all receives, with His feet, the service rendered by those who have no supreine and exclusive devotion to Him and that done by those who have supreme and exclusive devotion to Him, with His head. This idea is expressed by <em>Bhagavān</em> Veda Vyasa in the following (passages ):&quot; That which is offered to the gods and the _Pitṛ_s (Manes) in accordance with the prescribed rules</p>
<p>reaches the feet of the God of gods. The rites performed by wise men who have supreme and exclusive devotion to <em>Bhagavān</em> - these <em>Bhagavān</em> receives with His head&quot;.</p>
<p>The rites, <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>, which are performed in this way as commandments of the Lord (<em>ājñā</em>) and those valuable services which are rendered by a man for the pleasure of the Lord as those approved by Him (<em>anujñā</em>) - these have no connection with <em>prapatti</em> and this is declared by the injunction contained in the word <em>parityajya</em> (having given up) (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ).</p>

<li>Therefore one should not perform, for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>, those things of which one is capable, nor should one acquire, for the sake of <em>prapatti</em>, the ability or skill needed to accomplish what one is incapable of.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to this interpretation ( of the word <em>parityajya</em> in the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em> ), <em>ākiñcanya</em> or being destitute of _upāya_s which confers competence (<em>adhikāra</em>) for <em>prapatti</em> is suggested by the sentence which states &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo;. If <em>parityajya</em>, on the other hand, is considered as an anuvāda or expression of what has already occurred (namely, the person being incapable of any <em>upāya</em>), then, the word ‘<em>eka</em>’ (me alone) indicates that among those rites which arise from the Lord&rsquo;s command and those which are approved of by him, there is no connection between such of them as are performed as being within the range of a man&rsquo;s ability and <em>prapatti</em>. In this interpretation, the sentence ma śuchah (Do not grieve) makes clear the qualification (<em>adhikāra</em>) needed for <em>prapatti</em> which has already been expressed (in <em>parityajya</em>) and indicates also the manner in which the <em>prapanna</em> should conduct himself after the performance of <em>prapatti</em> (i.e.) being free from all care or anxiety.</p>
<p>There are some other ways of interpreting the word (<em>parityajya</em>) without treating the injunction regarding &lsquo;giving up&rsquo; as having no authority :</p>

<li>What is asked to be given up may be stated to be the prevention of the vain effort to perform what one is not capable of or the giving up of such vain effort along with the shame or remorse due to one&rsquo;s inability (to do it in full).</li>
</ol>
<p>3 The word tyāga contained in <em>parityajya</em> may also be considered as preventing the continuance of the trivial desire to perform (these rites) like a drowning man catching at a reed or a blade of grass.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the <em>Brahma</em> Sūtras, it is declared that any one of the vidyās (thirty two vidyās or forms of meditation described in the Upaniṣads) may be adopted at one&rsquo;s option, as all of them yield the same fruit. By drawing our attention to it, the injunction for <em>tyāga</em> contained in <em>parityajya</em> may also be to suggest that <em>prapatti</em> is like the <em>Brahma</em> missile, which proves ineffective if any other <em>upāya</em> is also adopted:</li>
</ol>
<p>(To sum up :-) The forms of injunction may be such as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To the man who proceeds to adopt what he is not capable of, it says “Don&rsquo;t&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the man who is firmly determined to do what is not in his power, it says, &ldquo;Give up this determination &ldquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a man were to adopt one of the _upāya_s (other than <em>prapatti</em>) which are left open to the option (of the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>), it says to him that, by the principle of the <em>Brahma</em> missile, it would conflict with the effectiveness of <em>prapatti</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the meanings of the words <em>sarva dharmān parityajya</em> (giving up all _dharma_s) which are approved of by the wise are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) incompetence to do those things that are not within one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>power gives competence for <em>prapatti</em>; and  being destitute of all other _upāya_s is a qualification for <em>prapatti</em>;</p>
<p>(3) the _dharma_s or rites being no accessory or <em>aṅga</em> to <em>prapatti</em>;</p>
<p>(4) the prevention of effort in trying to do what is not possible</p>
<p>for one;</p>
<p>(5) the giving up of the desire to do what is beyond one&rsquo;s ability;</p>
<p>(6) the indication of the principle of the <em>Brahma</em> missile.</p>
<p>The interpretation (which is given by some) that what is asked to be given up is the _dharma_s or rites associated with other deities (than <em>Bhagavān</em>) is not objectionable, but as this applies to both the man who adopts <em>bhakti</em>  or <em>upāsana</em> and the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em>, this interpretation is inappropriate here (in the context especially relating to the <em>prapanna</em> ).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The giving &ldquo;up of _upāya_s&rdquo; stated in such passages as the following :-One should give up the _upāya_s and also the apāyas (those activities that are forbidden )&rdquo; should also be interpreted in the same way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not endeavour to do what is beyond your power though you have begun the attempt; at the outset, it is the part of wisdom to give up the desire to do what lies beyond your ability; the path of <em>prapatti</em> does not require any aids ; if you desire other aids for it, it will lose its potency like the <em>Brahma</em> missile ; you are not among those who have the full knowledge required to follow the path of <em>bhakti</em>  or <em>upāsana</em>, which takes a long time to bear fruit; hence if you seek my feet as your refuge reflecting on your being destitute of other _upāya_s, I will pardon all your sins&rdquo;: Let us extol the great and good qualities of the holy <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa who spoke these words.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORDS MĀM AND AHAM</p>
<p>IN THE <em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>:&ndash; page559</p>
<p>As stated in the context in the Gita, which describes the secret of <em>avatāra</em> or incarnation and that in which <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa” declares Himself as (<em>Puruṣottama</em>), the primary aim of the words <em>mām</em> (me) and <em>aham</em> (I) (in the <em>carama</em> s&rsquo;loka) is to disclose (<em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s) easy accessibility and His absolute independence (and omnipotence) respectively.</p>

<p>He who knows the secret of incarnation to consist in its being real, in the incarnation continuing in its real nature (as <em>Bhagavān</em>) though incarnating in lower forms, in its being constituted of the (transcendental, substance called Śuddhasattvam in its being caused only by <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s own will or desire (and not by <em>karma</em> ); in its occurrence at a time when there is decline of <em>dharma</em> and in its being occasioned for the purpose of protecting the good &ndash; (he who knows all this) will never be born again.</p>
<p>This knowledge of the secret of incarnation is required for the <em>bhakta</em>, who has <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>aṅga</em>, to complete and perfect his <em>upāya</em>. To the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the direct and independent means, it reveals the easy accessibility of the omnipotent and independent Lord. The accessibility and omnipotence which are declared in these two contexts are complementary to each other,</p>

<p>Even if a person is independent and omnipotent, if he is not accessible, no one will seek him (for protection). Even if a person is sought (for protection) on account of his easy accessibility, he cannot award the desired fruit if he is dependent on others.</p>
<p>Towards one who is not independent, there is no possibility of rendering service, as the person rendering service, might think of acting as he pleases; and towards one who is not easily accessible, service might be possible though difficult, but as is seen in the world, it does not confer happiness or pleasure (on the person rendering service),</p>
<p>The Saviour who is both accessible and supreme is not only merely accessible like a blade of grass but exalted (in status and nature). Though exalted and supreme, he is not inaccessible like Mount Meru, but easily accessible. Therefore He is both capable of being sought (for protection) and capable of being attained. In these two words <em>mām</em> and <em>aham</em>, the eagerness with which the universal Saviour and <em>śeṣī</em> is awaiting an opportunity for protecting (the <em>jīva</em> ) is disclosed.</p>
<p><em>Iśvara</em> who thus waits for an occasion or opportunity as stated in the passage :&ndash; &quot; The Lord expects a prayer for protection,&rdquo; is ever favourably inclined saying, &quot; When will these (_jīva_s) pray for my help?&rdquo; This attitude of His is suggested by the word <em>mām</em> (me). The word <em>aham</em> (1) shows His attitude of readiness to confer for His own glory, the desired fruit as quickly as possible saying, “ When shall I take back (and wear) (these _jīva_s) like jewels from which the dirt (<em>prakṛti</em>) has been removed,&quot;</p>
<p>Thus the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> indicates by the words <em>mām</em> and ekam (me alone) the <em>Siddhopāya</em> who does not require anything else than the surrender of responsibility (<em>bharanyāsa</em>) with the prayer for protection performed according to the injunction. And by the words saranam vraja (seek as refuge or <em>upāya</em>) it shows, in the form of an injunction (<em>vidhi</em>) <em>Sādhyopāya</em> (namely, <em>prapatti</em>) which is the means of winning His grace. Since the <em>vidyā</em> called <em>prapatti</em>, which is here enjoined, is ordained as a means of propitiating the Saviour, it becomes an <em>upāya</em> and resembles in that respect <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. <em>Iśvara</em> who is propitiated thereby is the direct means or <em>upāya</em> for <em>mokṣa</em>. What has to be understood as a distinguishing feature of this vidyāi (<em>prapatti</em>) is its being an <em>upāya</em> which does not require (any aid or accessory). All the attributes necessary for this purpose are also signified in the words <em>mām</em> and ekam (me alone).</p>
<p>By the word <em>mām</em> (me) which denotes the Saviour whose nature is indicated in such <em>śloka_s as the following: &ldquo;This Nārāyaṇa who has the ocean of milk as His abode has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed of Adi_śeṣa</em>&rdquo; by this word ( <em>mām</em>) are disclosed His being the Universal Saviour, His being the universal <em>Śeṣī</em>, His being the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, His being Nārāyaṇa (the resting place of Naras) which are revealed in Tiru_mantra_ and <em>Dvaya</em>, and so also the qualities which can be inferred from them, namely, omniscience, omnipotence and the like, and, 30 also, such qualities as Ilis being supremely compassionate, His good nature (sauśīlya) and His love which are all the marks of supremacy and accessibility. (&lsquo;The word <em>mām</em> also discloses ), like the word having the dual termination, viz, <em>caraṇau</em> (the two feet) in <em>Dvaya</em>, the divinely auspicious form of Pārthasārathi which suggests both His being the Supreme Being and His easy accessibility and which is our auspicious refuge. Here these four qualities of His, namely, His love, His being the Master, His good nature (sauśīlya) and His accessibility which are stated in such passages as the following :&ndash; &ldquo;O Thou that hast incomparable attributes, Thou that ownest the three worlds, Thou that art my Saviour! Thou that dwellest on Mount Veṅkatam, which is eagerly longed for by hosts of incomparable gods and rishis!&rdquo; - these four qualities are revealed when <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa did not treat Arjuna&rsquo;s misplaced compassion and affection at the beginning with disregard, when He Himself declared : &quot; There is no one higher than I &ldquo;, when He served as charioteer to Arjuna who addressed Him as “O, Krishṇa O Yādava&rdquo; and said &quot; Drive my chariot and station it between the two armies&quot; and when, at Arjuna&rsquo;s request, He revealed to Him His universal form immanent in all things and when later, as soon as he prayed to see His former delightful form as <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, He stood before him once again as his charioteer. Among the aforesaid qualities of the Saviour, the most important attributes that are essential for the protection of those who seek Him have been briefly set forth in the Bhagavat <em>Śāstra</em>: &ldquo;Though <em>Bhagavān</em> who keeps all under His control is both omniscient and compassionate, He expects a prayer for protection, since He has to conduct the course of the world of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo; anil in this <em>śloka</em> of the wise āchārya, “In the face of &lsquo;Thy omniscience, omnipotence and compassion, my sins cannot bear fruit.&quot; Among these three qualities, knowledge and might tre required in common for conferring punishment and favour. l&rsquo;he Lord&rsquo;s being the Master serves the purpose both of His deriving the delight of Līlā from man in <em>samsāra</em> and His deriving enjoyment or bhoga in <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> from the soul that has obtained <em>mukti</em>, So this attribute of Lordship cannot restrain the Lord&rsquo;s jñāna or knowledge and <em>śakti</em> or might so as to operate only in the work of protection. Compassion and its varieties (literally - branches) good nature, love and the like are solely responsible for the conferment of favours. The ancients who appreciated this distinguishing feature of mercy wrote as follows:&ndash;&ldquo;O Thou &ldquo;that art the Lord of <em>Brahma</em>, the god of the gods! I have not the ability to adore Thee or to praise Thee. (Therefore) with compassion alone in Thy heart, bestow Thy grace on me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I relied on Thy compassion alone for protection.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not believe that I could be saved by anything other than Thy compassion,&rdquo; &ldquo;I look to Thy compassion alone for salvation,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou that, in spite of having the glorious <em>Lakṣmī</em>, art so full of compassion as to come and abide permanently in my heart&rdquo;, It is impossible&rdquo; to protect me except with Thy holy compassion,&quot; &ldquo;I will sweep Thy temple (and render such other service) being the recipient of Thy compassion and the compassion of Thy consort who dwells in the lotus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Showing&rdquo; Thy mercy with the exclamation &lsquo;Ha! Ha!!&quot;, &ldquo;Show me only Thy compassion so that I, Thy servant, may realise that I have nothing else to attain than Thee and that I have no other <em>upāya</em> (than Thee ) and so that I may find delight only in rendering service to Thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord of Hastigiri! Those that are devoted to Thee by their qualities and actions with the knowledge of Thee &ndash; it is Thy compassion which has made them devoted to thee. I consider that only that compassion is a source of strength to me who am destitute of _upāya_s.&rdquo; In these Ways, these ancients looked lipon (the Lord&rsquo;s) compassion by their refuge and considered the relationship of the <em>śeṣī</em> to the <em>śeṣa</em> and other qualities (of the Lord) as the obedient servants of compassion and became solely dependent on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, Sītā devi also said, in spite of the existence of other qualities: &ldquo;Rāma, the descendant of Kakustha, extended his protection to him (Kakasura), out of compassion, though he deserved the punishment of being killed”.</p>
<p>Since <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> has also written in his <em>Gadya</em> &ldquo;At <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the time of the death of the body, you will, by my grace alone, become wise and have a vision of me etc.,&rdquo; the primary importance of (the Lord&rsquo;s) compassion is indicated. Facing (Arjuna) with this primary quality so essential for protection and other attributes which are ancillary to it, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa referred to Himself as <em>mām</em> (me).</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF EKAM IN THE <em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>: page564</p>
<p>(1: While the singular form <em>mām</em>(me) itself indicates the idea of alone&rsquo; (ekam), the further use of the word <em>ekam</em> is, according to some, to disclose that He who is the object of attainment is Himself the means or <em>upāya</em> for that attainment like the (celestial) <em>kalpaka</em> tree giving itself (to those that ask). Thus (these commentators) suggest that the use of <em>ekam</em> after <em>mām</em> is to suggest the identity of the object of attainment and the means of attaining it. This interpretation finds support in the sentence <em>mām ekam eva</em> in a similar context :- &quot; By all means, seek the protection only of me alone who am the inner self of all beings, You will then have no fear of any kind.&rdquo; Since the word eva (only) is already present, it is but proper to seek some other purpose for the existence or use of the word <em>ekam</em> in addition to only. (This purpose is the declaration of the oneness of the means and the end).</p>
<p>(2) As against this, others say that the word ekam which has the following nieanings: &lsquo;chief&rsquo;, &lsquo;something other than&rsquo;, and ‘there is no other than this&rsquo;, is, in this sentence, a mere synonym of &rsquo;no other&rsquo; and means &lsquo;only&rsquo; or &lsquo;alone&rsquo; as in the _śloka_s, “Those who seek me alone (and no other) as their refuge will surmount the insurmountable māyā&quot; and &ldquo;Seek the protection of Him alone (and no other)&rdquo;. In this way they mention that by emphasising the fullness of the qualities of the Saviour, one is made to understand that one cannot adopt an <em>upāya</em> by one&rsquo;s own independence. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:-&ldquo;As the man adopts, for his own protection, the means ordained for Him by the _śāstra_s for propitiating (the Lord), it is just possible that he might think of himself also as doing something for his protection on an equal footing with the Saviour who is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>. Taking into account this possibility, the word <em>eka</em> denies that there is any <em>upāya</em> other than the Lord to make the _upāya_s two. If it be asked how this denial is made, the answer is as follows: It is true that the <em>jīva</em> is the doer according to the pramāņas, for it is stated: - &ldquo;He is the doer; otherwise the _śāstra_s could have no meaning or purpose&rdquo;. Still this doership of the <em>jīva</em> is dependent on the Supreme Being and is very limited (in its scope) besides being subject to hindrances. Therefore though he adopts the <em>upāya</em>, it is only on account of the Lord&rsquo;s grace as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &quot; Without Thy compassion, O Varada, even the prayer that Thou shouldst be my <em>upāya</em> would not arise from me.&rdquo; When the Lord withholds His help and stimulation, the <em>jīva</em> cannot even stretch out his limbs or bend them. Therefore he practises the <em>upāya</em> revealed by the Lord, with the help of the body and the senses given by Him and with His help and looks up to Him like the chātaka bird for the desired fruit to be given by Him. So it is improper for the intelligent aspirant to <em>mukti</em> to consider himself, as another <em>Siddhopāya</em> equal to the Lord, who is absolutely independent of others and whose activities extend everywhere and can meet with no hindrances or obstacles. This is, according to these commentators, the purport of the word <em>eka.</em> (only He and no other). (3) Following this line of reasoning, they say also that the word <em>eka</em> (one) is used to prevent the consideration of <em>prapatti</em> which is <em>sādhyopāya</em> as being equal to <em>Siddhopāya</em>. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows:- Although like <em>bhakti</em> . <em>yoga</em>, <em>prapatti</em> too, has been enjoined as an endeavour to propiti. ate (the Lord), yet its purpose is merely to allay the displeasure of the Supreme Ruler who has innate compassion and other such qualities. For the direct attainment of the desired fruit, it is only the will of the Lord who has, by His very nature, the ability and the compassion (necessary for protecting the <em>jīva</em>) - it is only His will that is the cause. He accepts the responsibility for protecting the <em>prapanna</em> who is absolutely destitute of _upāya_s and Himself stands in the place of such more difficult _upāya_s as <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. He expects only the <em>vyāja</em> (pretext or gesture ) of <em>prapatti</em> accompanied by such things as the will to do what is pleasing to Him. This nyāsa <em>vidyā</em> does not require any ancillary rite or accessory and has this as its distinguishing feature. Therefore in this <em>vidyā</em>, He is the only <em>upāya</em> to be prayed for as stated in the following passages: &ldquo;Śaraṇāgati consists in the thought &ldquo;I pray that Thou alone shouldst be my <em>upāya</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;I made Him the subject of the thought that the Lord should be my <em>upāya</em>. Even this became possible only by virtue of His compassion.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord that mad&rsquo;st me consent and placed me beneath Thy feet I&rdquo; As stated in these passages, to piace the mere <em>vyāja</em> or pretext vis. <em>prapatti</em>, which too was inspired only by Him acting as the <em>upāya</em> to place it on an equal footing with Him is not proper. This is the purport of the word eka (only · no other).</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the fact that <em>Sādhyopāya</em> is a inere pretext or gesture (<em>vyāja</em>) in relation to <em>Siddhopāya</em> and is without any importance, some (writers) exaggerated its insignificance by stating that <em>prapatti</em> consists merely in (1) the knowledge of the relation of the <em>śeṣa</em> to the s&rsquo;eshī (2) the mere knowledge that the Lord is the <em>Siddhopāya</em>, (3) nonresistance (to His grace) (4) mere acceptance or receptivity (5) the attitude of being different from <em>acit</em> or non-sentient matter (6) the activity of the sentient being and (7) serenity of mind (8) an attribute of the adhikārī. From these (exaggerated statements) it is not proper to conclude that any of them is the real meaning of <em>prapatti</em>, for the purport (of these exaggerations) is quite different. All these interpretations are opposed to the positive injunction contained in <em>śaraṇam vraja</em> (seek me as Thy Saviour). They would also lead to too wide an application (atipras_aṅga_). We will explain how:- (1) &amp; (2) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist only in the knowledge of the relationship of the <em>śeṣa</em> to the <em>śeṣin</em> or in the knowledge that the Lord is <em>Siddhopāya</em>, then since this knowledge would of itself arise from the sentence or text (stating it), there would be no need to state it in the form of an injunction (ordaining &lsquo;know this &ldquo;). If it be said that <em>mokṣa</em> might result from mere knowledge and without doing the thing enjoined in a <em>vidhi</em> or injunction, it would, as explained in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> and elsewhere (Vedārthasangraha), be opposed to (the spirit of) the injunctions directing one to upāsanas; if it be held that the man who has a knowledge of the truth should thereby acquire a different kind of knowledge called <em>prapatti</em>, then the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of this knowledge should be understood in accordance with the texts or passages ordaining the <em>dharma</em> (ś&rsquo;araṇam vraja), those that describe or define its characteristics (that it can yield fruits not attainable otherwise etc.) and those that prescribe the manner of adopting it (anushṭhāna) (the utterance of the <em>Dvaya</em> and the like). If the statement that <em>prapatti</em> consists only in the acceptance of <em>Siddhopāya</em> were true, it would mean that the man should first know <em>Siddhopāya</em> and then perform the action called &lsquo;surrender of responsibility (<em>bharanyāsa</em>) for which he is competent and that this surrender should be preceded by the prayer enjoined in the vidhis or injunctions, (3) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in mere non-resistance (to the Lord&rsquo;s grace), it would mean (a) that it was possible for him to resist <em>Iśvara</em> owing to superior strength. This would imply that <em>Iśvara</em> is not omnipotent or (b) If resistance means resisting the Lord&rsquo;s grace by committing an offence and incurring punishment, it would follow that <em>prapatti</em> is only a means of propitiation (c) If resistance means resisting in means of one&rsquo;s own activity to protect oneself, then since there is no such resistance of the nature of activity in such states as pralaya and <em>suṣupti</em> (dreamless sleep) and so also in the waking stake when the man is capable of action but does not act, <em>Iśvara</em> would have to</p>
<p>award <em>mokṣa</em> to him. (4) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in mere acceptance, it would then stand on the same footing as <em>upāsana</em>. There would be no difference between the <em>bhakta</em> and the <em>prapanna</em>. (5) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist merely in being different from non-sentient things, it would be present even when the man acts against the will of God. This, certainly, could not be the cause of being saved or protected. (6) If <em>prapatti</em> were to consist in the mere activity of the sentient being, not only upāsanas but other activities of the sentient being (like eating, breathing, etc.,) would lie the cause of salvation. There would then be no difference between <em>prapatti</em> and all these activities. If it be said that <em>prapatti</em> is what happens to a man of its own accord, there would then be no need for instructions (upadeśa&rsquo;) concerning it. (7) If it be said that <em>prapatti</em> means serenity of mind without the purpose of obtaining any fruit, then it would vary with different individuals in accordance with their respective tastes. (8) If <em>prapatti</em> were a mere attribute of the adhikāri (and not something to be done), the word vraja would be improper, for it lays down something to be done and there is no reference to any fruit or the desire for it (and the like). So it would not be proper to call <em>prapatti</em> an attribute of the adhikārī<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> . If it were possible to condemn (the performance of) <em>prapatti</em> in these ways, although it is enjoined as something to be performed, it would be equally possible to condemn also upāsanas and the like in the same manner In that case, the attempt to distinguish <em>prapatti</em> from upāsanas and the like (which was the reason for the argument) would fail. If it be said that though this <em>Siddhopāya</em> (<em>Iśvara</em> ) has accepted the responsibility of protecting one and is bent op granting the (desired) fruit, yet the man should consider that this acceptance is unnecessary, <em>prapatti</em> would then be a case of meditating on what is not true (drishti <em>vidhi</em>)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> (and it would not lead to <em>mokṣa</em> ).</p>
<p>If it means the thought that the acceptance by <em>Iśvara</em>, too, is unnecessary, it would be opposed to the idea contained in the words of the Lord <em>śaraṇam vraja</em> (seek me as the Saviour).</p>
<p>Therefore <em>Iśvara</em> is the object of propitiation and He is the <em>Siddhopāya</em> and is of great importance. Both <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> are ways of propitiation and are _Sādhyopāya_s which are not so important. (The aspirant to <em>mukti</em>) should be firmly established in either of these two, according to his competence.</p>
<p>(4) It has also been stated by some (_ācārya_s) that the word eka is employed to indicate how the Saviour, who has accepted the responsibility, stands alone, requiring nothing else after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, so that there need be no adoption of any of the means (like <em>upāsana</em>) prescribed for the attainment of the desired fruit. This may be explained as follows :&mdash; If a person has performed <em>prapatti</em> as an <em>aṅga</em> and then adopts also upāsanas  and the like as angī, the Saviour becomes the <em>upāya</em> for the fruit desired. In the case of the man who adopts <em>prapatti</em> as a direct and independent means, being destitute of the other pros and impatient of delay, the game <em>Iśvara</em> takes, upon his own qualities, the burden that lies between <em>prapatti</em> and Himself. As stated in the following passages :- &quot; Those who are incapable of bhaktı <em>yoga</em> and seek Thee as <em>upāya</em> they, too, pass beyond <em>samsāra</em> and reach Thy abode, Vaikuṇṭha”, and &ldquo;Thou hast Thyself given Thy feet as the fruit of my attainment and as the <em>upāya</em> for attaining it&rdquo; - as stated here, the Lord himself, who is endowed with the qualities essential for it, stands as the Dispenser of the fruit desired, without requiring any ancillary rite or <em>dharma</em>. Therefore what is stated in the <em>carama</em>.<em>śloka</em> comes to this :- &quot; Bear this in mind and seek Me alone for your salvation&rdquo;. (5) It is said by some that the word <em>eka</em> is used here for the purpose of making it clear that, when <em>prapatti</em> is performed to Him who is perfect in every way, nothing else is required except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore the Lord teaches that one should not introduce, into this, ancillary rites such as are required for the vidyās, under the impression that they, too, form _upāya_s for propitiating Him. The Lord&rsquo;s purport (in the <em>śloka</em>) is as follows &ndash;&rdquo; <em>Prapatti</em> does not require any aids such as are performed either because they are my commands or because their performance is approved of by me. When I become gracious owing to the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, I am bent on granting the desired fruit and stand as the one and only surety for this <em>upāya</em> which is capable of being performed in an instant. In regard to the fruit of this <em>prapatti</em>, nothing else need be performed. I do not require any such aid in regard to my determination to save Thee&quot;. This amounts to saying that, with the exception of such things as the will to do what is pleasing (to the Lord), no other auxiliary causes should be added on in the name of ancillaries to <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>As stated (in the <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em> &quot; Thou that utterest the <em>Dvaya</em> in some manner or other&quot; and in Varadarāja stava. “By the mere words which state <em>prapatti</em>, I long to see Thee - Thee that canst not be attained by <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;, even though a man has not the clear understanding necessary for the full and perfect performance of <em>prapatti</em>, this <em>upāya</em> will be effective even if it be adopted in a less satisfactory manner. Therefore there is certainly no need to seek ancillary rites or _dharma_s for this <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>(It is true that) (in the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em>) it is stated :- &quot; Then Rāma,&rdquo; the slayer of his enemies, spread kuśa grass on the beach, had his arm shining like the body of a serpent for his pillow, folded his hands in añjali and lay down facing the east and expecting the arrival of the god of the ocean&quot; and, likewise, in the story of _Brahma_datta in the episode of Saptavyādha, “The king was in great danger and sought with devotion Nārāyaṇa, the chief of the gods, the Saviour and the Ruler over all, as his <em>upāya</em> with concentration of mind and fasting for six nights. The renowned king saw in his contemplation (<em>dhyāna</em>) the Lord Nārāyaṇa&quot; But these ancillary rites that are described in the Rāmāyaṇa and Harivamśa) are not necessary for <em>prapatti</em>. In these two places, what is of importance is the ritual of sitting with the intention of starving onto death and therefore the ancillary actions described there are proper. The same explanation holds good in the case of namaskāra well performed. (There is no <em>prapatti</em> in all these cases). But in <em>prapatti</em>, no other requisites are needed except such as the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord - such as are stated in the chapters on <em>Prapatti</em>. We do not find any ancillary rites except such requisites, at the time, as the will to do what is pleasing. in the following instances of those who performed <em>prapatti</em> with only their being destitute of all _upāya_s for their sole wealth. (a) Draupadi, (b) Damayanti, (c) Rākṣasis, (d) Vibhishana, (e) Kshatrabandbu, (f) Muchukunda, (g) Gajendra, (h) the pāṇḍavas, (i) the gods, (j) Sumukha. (k) Triśanku, (1) Śunaśśepha, (m) Kirāta, (n) kāka, (o) Kapota<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> and the like. We find that, by the instantaneous performance of mere <em>prapatti</em> without any other requisites, the desired fruit was obtained) by each of these that sought protection in the same manner, even in <em>prapatti</em> performed for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em>, there is nothing to prevent the attainment of the fruit at the desired time. This is the purport also of the words <em>mā s&rsquo;uchah</em> (Do not grieve).</p>
<p>If <em>parityajya</em> is interpreted to mean that there is nothing else required for <em>prapatti</em>, this interpretation of the word <em>eka</em> may be considered as confirming or emphasizing this. (It need not therefore be looked upon as redundant). Or the word eka may be considered to have another meaning, namely, the idea of the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> being the same. If the word eka is considered as stating that <em>prapatti</em> does not require anything else, then the word <em>parityajya</em> may be considered as having the other meanings stated before.</p>
<p>If it be asked why the word <em>eka</em> should be used as an adjective of the Saviour, when (properly speaking), it should qualify <em>prapatti</em> (so that it might mean that <em>prapatti</em> alone is necessary without any ancillary _dharma_s), the answer is as follows: The words, <em>mām ekam</em> (me alone) are employed to show that, in the case of the man destitute of other _upāya_s, these ancillary _dharma_s other than <em>prapatti</em> are in no way connected with the Saviour as the means of propitiating Him. (6) It is also stated by some (commentators) that, as in the first half of the <em>śloka</em> we find the words <em>sarva dharmān</em> (all _dharma_s) and in the second half the word <em>sarva pāpebhyo</em> (from all sins), the word <em>eka</em> stands here as the counterpart or counterpoise to the world all. If this be admitted, then the gist of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> would be:</p>
<details open><summary>संस्कृतम् - विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>
<p>सुदुष्करेण शोचेद्यो येनयेनेष्टहेतुना ।<br>
स स तस्याहमेवेति चरमश्लोकसंग्रहः ॥</p>

<details><summary>संस्कृतम् - मूलम्</summary>

</details>
<p>If a man is in despair because of his inability to adopt such means or _upāya_s as will yield the respective fruits desired by him, then, I myself (single as I am) will stand for him as the respective means or <em>upāya</em> to enable him to secure that fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement may be explained as follows: &ldquo;Whatever be the object that a man, whoever be may be, wishes to attain and whatever be the means or _upāya_s by which he cannot attain them and likewise, the attainment of <em>mokṣa</em> desired by the aspirant, which cannot be attained by <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>, all these fruits, can, O great sage, be attained by <em>prapatti</em>. The place desired by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> is that supreme abode from which the man who reaches it never returns&rdquo;. As declared (in the passage cited above), when a man falls into grief because he cannot obtain any one of the fruits desired by him either because of ignorance of the means prescribed in the _śāstra_s for acquiring the respective fruit, or because even while possessing that knowledge, he is unable to adopt the prescribed means, or because, while possessing both (the knowledge and the ability), he is too impatient to wait until the time when the fruit will be attained thereby - (when a man falls into grief in this way) the <em>Carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> declares to him, “ You need not go about in search of these means. I will myself be the only and sole <em>upāya</em> for your attainment of all these fruits, provided I am propitiated by the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. The <em>Carama</em> <em>Śloka</em> says, as it were :- &quot; This single and sovereign medicine will give you all the health which a larger number of other medicines may confer on you. It is enough, if, instead of falling into despair, you take this single medicine. This will cure all the ailments that can be cured by other medicines. After taking this medicine, you can enjoy all pleasures. Therefore you need not fall into despair thinking that you have lost your health and the pleasures.&quot; This is, as it were, the meaning of the <em>Carama</em> <em>śloka</em>.</p>
<p>Though the word <em>eka</em> stands as the counter-part of the word <em>sarva</em> (all) and qualifies the Saviour as He is most important being the Sidhopāya, yet it is tantamount to stating that <em>prapatti</em> alone is enjoined as the single <em>dharma</em> in the place of all other _dharma_s, as in the phrase &quot; by <em>nyāsa</em> alone&quot; From this it follows that even those who desire the three ends (other than <em>mokṣa</em> (viz). (<em>dharma</em>, artha and kāma) may perform prupatti to <em>Bhagavān</em> for securing them. So it is not proper to have any contact with other deities except as they figure as attributes to the Lord in the performance of the <em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em> rites, as stated in such _śloka_s as the following:-&ldquo;I am propitiating Him from whom, O lndra, you have obtained your position of lordship. I will not adore you. Here is my anjali to you. You may strike me with your thunderbolt or abstain from doing so. I will never adore any one but Govinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even those who seek other _upāya_s for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (like <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>) may perform <em>prapatti</em> in order to get rid of the hindrances in the way (of those _upāya_s). <em>Prapatti</em> is suitable in the case also of those who want to get rid of obstacles to the attainment (of <em>Bhagavān</em> ) viz, sins and this is declared here (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) to show that it is capable of securing any fruit that may be desired (by one). The idea that <em>prapatti</em> will destroy the obstacles to the _upāya_s for attainment (namely, sins) is conveyed (by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) in his Gitā <em>Bhāṣya</em> in his second interpretation (of the <em>śloka</em>). In the <em>Gadya</em>, he has declared that <em>prapatti</em> will help to get rid of the hindrances to the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> It does not mean that, in those two places, <em>Śrī</em> Rāmānuja expresses one of these two ideas in disregard of the other. Both passages illustrate the potency of this <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which cın secure all desired ends. The _praṇava_n (<em>aum</em>) enters into the body of another <em>mantra</em>, viz. <em>namo</em> Nārāyaṇāya as a part thereof and yet is itself an independent <em>mantra</em>. So also this <em>prapatti</em> forms an <em>aṅga</em> to <em>bhakti</em>  in the case of others. This is evident from the authority of the texts. That <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> stand as alternative _upāya_s determined by the competence of the persons concerned is evident from such passages as the following: &ldquo;I am capable of being attained O, Thou of great wisdom, either by deep <em>bhakti</em>  or by <em>prapatti</em> on the part of those who desire to render service to me, I cannot be attained by any other means &ldquo;.</p>
<p>(There is a well-known <em>śloka</em> which says):- &ldquo;A man attains <em>mokṣa</em> either by right knowledge, or by death in the waters of the G_aṅga_ or by namaskāra well-performed or by <em>bhakti</em> &ldquo;. In such passages those that are direct means of attaining <em>mukti</em> are stated along with others that are not direct but only auxiliary. This is only a way of exaggerating the importance of these indirect means.</p>

<p>Six meanings have (thus) been pointed out by_ācārya_s for the word eka. They are (1) the identity of the object of attainment (<em>Bhagavān</em>) and the means or <em>upāya</em> for that attainment (2) the denial of one&rsquo;s own importance (i. e. of the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s works); (3) <em>prapatti</em> being only a mere pretext or gesture (<em>vyāja</em>). (4) the absence of any relation or connection between <em>prapatti</em> and other _upāya_s; (5) and likewise, the absence of any relation or connection between <em>prapatti</em> and the _aṅga_s or ancillary _dharma_s (<em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, etc.) of other _upāya_s (like <em>bhakti</em> ) and (6) <em>prapatti</em> as a single means of securing all desired ends without any distinction whatsoever.</p>
<p>THE SAVIOUR IS BHAGAVAN WITH <em>ŚRĪ</em> AS HIS</p>
<p>ATTRIBUTE: page575</p>
<p>There are some commentators who state that the meaning of the word eka (a single one) declares that the Saviour is only one (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em>) and that <em>Śrī</em> has nothing to do with salvation). But their contention does not stand to reason. Just as qualities and forms qualify the Lord as His attributes, so also <em>Śrī</em> is an attribute of His (inseparable from Him). She is the ruler over all beings and is dear to <em>Bhagavān</em> and is declared in the _śruti_s as sharing in His duties and as ever bent on protecting those that seek her help. Though it is stated (in the Chandogya Upaniṣad and other Vedic texts) that the material cause of the Universe is only one (sat), yet other things that are requisite as material causes are understood as existing as His attributes (viz. <em>cit</em> and <em>acit</em> in their subtle and unmanifested forms) on the authority of the pramāņas. So also in this context, <em>Śrī</em> should be understood, although not distinctly stated. Even when a single form of <em>upāsana</em> or meditation is enjoined, the qualities that are connected with the object of meditation enter also into it. Similarly though a single deity is enjoined as the Saviour to be sought, <em>Śrī</em>, who is His attribute, should also be considered as being associated with Him (in the act of salvation). The <em>Siddhopāya</em> (namely, <em>Bhagavān</em> ) is (of course) single but His qualities remain with Him (though not explicitly stated). In the same way, in the opinion of those who see with the eye of the <em>Śāstra</em>, <em>Lakṣmī</em> (His spouse) is associated inseparably with Him as an attribute, Light and the object emitting light (are inseparable from each other) and when one is mentioned , the other is also presint by association. Likewise when either (<em>Bhagavān</em> or <em>Śrī</em>) is mentioned, the other is also present by virtue of their being always with each other. Sages have declared in the _smṛti_s that she helps (_jīva_s) to cross the sea of <em>samsāra</em> and both of them (<em>Bhagavān</em> and <em>Śrī</em>) have themselves spoken to the same effect in such (samhitas) treatises as sātvatam. In <em>Dvaya</em> it is considered appropriate that <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service in the state of attainment (<em>mokṣa</em>) should extend to <em>Śrī</em> (as to <em>Bhagavān</em>) So <em>Śrī</em> is equally connected with Him in both the states, that of the endeavour for attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (the first half of <em>Dvaya</em>) and that after attainment (the second half of it). Therefore, on the authority of many Vedic texts and _Śruti_s which cannot be stated to have some other purport, the single one who is to be sought as the Saviour is the Lord with His attribute <em>Śrī</em> who is His consort.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD SARANAM IN THE</p>
<p><em>CARAMA</em>-<em>ŚLOKA</em>: page576</p>
<p>The meanings that have (already) been given to the word <em>ś&rsquo;araṇam</em> occurring in <em>Dvayam</em> (on p. ) should be borne in mind in regard to the word <em>śaraṇam</em> employed here in the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em>. This prayer for refuge or <em>upāya</em> (saranam though taught to Arjuna, should be considered applicable to all and this is evident from the<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Svetāsvatara Upaniṣad and from <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s words in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em>) <em>Gadya</em>: &ldquo;O Thou that art the Saviour of all beings in the world ignoring the differences that may exist among those that seek Thee&rdquo;. Similarly in such passages as the following :- “Those Brahmins who know the first part of the Veda and those people who understand the meaning of its latter part declare that the Supreme Being, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, is the ever-existing <em>dharma</em> or <em>upāya</em> &ldquo;, &quot; The great and eminent Rishis say that Thou art the refuge and the Saviour of those that have sought Thy protection&rdquo;. &ldquo;He is the &ldquo;Yoga (<em>upāya</em>) and the one who leads those who know <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> to their goal&rdquo;. and &ldquo;<em>Bhagavān</em> whom the wise call the eternal means (<em>upāya</em>) and the goal of attainment&rdquo; &ndash; (in such passages ) also, since there is no limitation of meaning, it has to be understood that the Saviour is for all. The only requisite for seeking Him as the Saviour or Refuge is that the person should be destitute of any other refuge or protector.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD VRAJA: page577</p>
<p>The word vraja also, like the word prapadye (in <em>Dvaya</em> ) enjoins self-surrender with all its auxiliaries. In the word (prapadye in <em>Dvaya</em>), the first person is used, because it is the thought or meditation in the mind of the man who performs <em>prapatti</em>. Here (in the <em>caramaśloka</em>) it is in the second person, since the injunction is addressed to the man (Arjuna) who stands opposite to the Lord (i.e.) <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa saying: &ldquo;I am Thy disciple and (it is only fitting that) Thou shouldst order me to do what is right&rdquo;. Auxiliaries like the will to do what is pleasing to the Lord are also indicated here and may be found suggested in <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> suitable words as in <em>Dvaya</em>, There is a ( well-known) principle which states: “When an action is enjoined in the <em>śāstra</em>, a single performance of it satisfies the requirements of the <em>Śāstra</em>&rdquo;. The <em>upāsana</em> however, is an exception to this general rule because it requires frequent repetition. But <em>prapatti</em> is no such exception (and hence a single performance will quite do ). This statement is confirmed also by such words as the following: -&ldquo;To the man who performs <em>prapatti</em> only once and says &ldquo;I exist for Thee &quot; - to that man I grant freedom from fear from all beings. This is my vow&rdquo;. To the man who performs <em>bharanyāsa</em> (the surrender of responsibility) to the generous and omnipotent (Lord), there is no reason for delay in the attainment except his own desire. Therefore in the case of this <em>nyāsa</em> <em>vidyā</em>, the peculiarity is that it arrests even the consequences of past <em>karma</em> which have already begun to operate (prarabdha <em>karma</em> ).</p>
<p>In this connection some (commentators) ask &ldquo;An action may be enjoined for performance only by a man who has freedom of will and action, How can an action be enjoined (in the word vraja) for performance by one who has been taught as being absolutely dependent (on the Lord) in the Vedanta and other _śāstra_s treating of the self and in such as the mool <em>mantra</em>? This (question) is the result of an inadequate understanding of what is meant by complete dependence on another the Lord). As determined in vedanta (_śāstra_s), “He (i.e.)the <em>jīva</em> is the doer; otherwise the _śāstra_s which enjoin _dharma_s would have no purpose or meaning&rdquo;, and &quot; The doership (of the <em>jīva</em>) is dependent on the Supreme Self, for the <em>śruti</em> says so&rdquo;. Since the <em>jīva</em> is an agent or doer subject to the will of <em>Bhagavān</em>, there is nothing to prevent an injunction asking him to do something.</p>
<p>Just as non-sentient things (<em>acit</em>) like ether and fire bear the attributes respectively of sound and heat created by <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s absolute dependence on <em>Iśvara</em> consists in bearing this burden of free will (and responsibility) (granted to him by <em>Iśvara</em>). If it be maintained that he has no responsibility at all as a doer or agent, it would be like the heresies (siddhanta) which attribute doership (respectively) to <em>prakṛti</em> and a_vidyā_ (Sankhya and Advaita). If (on the other hand) it be maintained that the <em>jīva</em>&rsquo;s doership is dependent only on himself (and on nobody else), then since it would resemble the heresy which does not admit the existence of one who is in supreme control of all selves, it would be a form of atheism.  If it is held that the doership which comes from the will of the Lord is merely the state of being the knower, there would be no such thing as a desire for the ends of life (<em>puruṣārtha</em>) and the endeavour to attain them. It it be held that apart from the knowledge and the particular form of knowledge called desire, there is no such thing as effort (or mental activity), it would be impossible to adopt any means for securing objects that are t_aṅgī_ble or int_aṅgī_ble and for rendering service for its own sake . Therefore it has to be admitted that the self has these three (attributes):&ndash;knowledge, desire, and effort (knowing, feeling and willing). Among these (three), desire and effort are only different modifications or states of knowledge and this may be understood from the principle of logical economy <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> adopted by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> in his Vedārthasangraha.</p>
<p>The doership or agentship which consists in being the seat (<em>āśraya</em>) of an action (or the place where an action takes place) is a common attribute of both sentient beings and non sentient things (for the latter also move about and undergo changes). But the seat (<em>āśraya</em>) of an effort or endeavour (prayatna) is (an attribute) peculiar to sentient beings. Effort or endeavour (prayatna) is a form of knowledge or will that is the cause of stimulating one to exercise the body (the senses and the like). When one is the seat of mere knowledge and of mere enjoyment (bhoga), there is only the doership which consists in being the seat of such action as is common to sentient beings and non-sentient things.</p>
<p>When a person is stimulated by his will to act in a particular manner, he becomes the seat of endeavour or effort (prayatna) and is a doer of that particular form. It cannot justly be maintained that this form of doership is found only in rendering <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service. Even in this case, the man must have adopted an <em>upāya</em> with a view to attaining the end called the love of the Lord. If all this is admitted, it is only the doership that takes the form of an endeavour or effort which would lead to bondage - it is only this form of doership that should be avoided. If it be asked what that form of doership is, the answer is as follows:- <em>Iśvara</em> has given the <em>jīva</em> such qualities as knowledge and ability and also such things as the senses and the body. He supports the <em>jīva</em> and stimulates him (to action). He enjoys also the fruit of (that) action. When He is thus rendering help (to the <em>jīva</em>), if the latter should consider himself as being different from this and if, even when he considers his position in the right spirit, he adopts an <em>upāya</em> for some (worldly) purpose - the endeavour would lead to bondage. Even <em>bhakti</em> and <em>prapatti</em> would certainly lead to bondnge in the case of the man who performs them for securing other ends (than <em>mokṣa</em>). Therefore just like the doership in the state of attainment (<em>mukti</em>) of the man who longs for rendering service to the Lord by virtue of his very nature and with no other purpose, the doership in the state when he adopts an <em>upāya</em> (for the sake of <em>mukti</em> and service) is not improper. The doership of varied forms of service (to the Lord) in the state of attainment (i. e. <em>mukti</em>) results from the self’s own longing (to render service) combined with the varied desires of the Lord (which have no connection with <em>karma</em>). The doership in the state of <em>samsāra</em> is of different kinds corresponding to the conditioning factor (upādhi) in the forms of sattva, rajas and tamas which have been evolved in accordance with the past <em>karma</em>  and by the will of <em>Iśvara</em>. That doership which results from rajas and tamas and so also from that sattva which is the cause of attachment to other interests (than <em>mokṣa</em>) - that doership leads to bondage. That doership (on the other hand) which results from the form of superior <em>sattvam</em> which creates a longing for he attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> &ndash; that doership leads to <em>mokṣa</em>. In the state of <em>mukti</em>, the doership will have no connection at all with any of these three qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore between the texts which state that the self is not a doer and the texts which state that the self is a doer, there is no conflict, since it is possible to discriminate wherein it has doership and wherein it has no doership. If it be asked how this could be understood, the answer is as follows:- The texts which declare that the self is not a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that the doership of the self which is dependent on <em>Iśvara</em> and on the qualities of <em>prakṛti</em> (sattva, rajas and tamas) should not be considered as independent of other (forms). The texts which declare that the self is a doer or agent have, for their purport, the truth that, of the <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge and its particular forms called desire to perform and effort which have come to him in accordance with such things as the desire of <em>Iśvara</em>, the <em>jīva</em> is himself the seat or āsraya. This conclusion has been taught clearly by the <em>Gītācārya</em> Himself in the _śloka_s beginning with the following &ndash;&rdquo; It is ascertained that when a man does any action with his body, speech or mind, there are five causes that contribute to that action, viz, the body, the self, the senses, the vital breath and fifthly Divinity or daivam In that context the Divinity that is called the fifth (cause) is <em>Puruṣottama</em>. When <em>Puruṣottama</em> stimulates the <em>jīva</em> to perform in action, He is called the kārayitā or one who causes that action, He is (also ) called the karta or doer in regard to those actions like the awarding of the fruit ( to the <em>jīva</em>) and the creation of the world. When He does not prevent the sentient being from performing an action, He is said to be indifferent. Since he permits it, He is said to be anumantā (i.e.) one who acquiesces. As <em>Iśvara</em>, sometimes, acts like an expert porter who carries a heavy weight to help an apprentice who can carry only a light burden, He is also said to co-operate (with the <em>jīva</em> ) (sahakārī). In such things as the</p>
<p>creation (of the world), since differences like gods and men are due to the conditioning factor (upādhi) of their respective past <em>karma</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> is declared not to be the doer as stated in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;The four castes were created by me in accordance with such qualities as sattva that are found in _jīva_s and also with their past <em>karma</em> . Though I perform the act of creation, I am not the real cause nor am I tainted by it.&rdquo; Thus from <em>Iśvara</em> who has the common and general doership of all things without exception, the <em>jīva</em> acquires the power to make an effort and act in accordance with his own will. Therefore it is evident that the <em>jīva</em> is fit to be directed to do a thing and the word vraja may justly enjoin the performance of an action.</p>
<p>Since the <em>dharma</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em> can rightly be enjoined for performance, just like such things as <em>bhakti</em>, the statement of Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan (the foremost of the disciples of <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) that the good we do for ourselves is like milk that is bought (in the market) and that the good that comes from <em>Iśvara</em> is like mother&rsquo;s milk should be understood to mean that we should remember that <em>bhakti</em>, <em>prapatti</em> and the like result (from the grace of) God and that the <em>jīva</em> is solely dependent (on <em>Iśvara</em>). (It does not mean that we are not right in performing <em>bhakti</em> or <em>prapatti</em> and should leave everything to God.)</p>

<p>He who states that the texts which declare <em>bhakti</em>  to be an <em>upāya</em> are only for the purpose of creating faith in <em>prapatti</em> is undermining faith in every <em>śāstra</em> without directly appearing to do so.</p>
<p><em>Bhakti</em> as an <em>upāya</em> has been compared (by some critics of it) &quot; to water from a sacred river contained in a pitcher but mingled with a drop of liquor&rdquo;. But this comparison or simile would hold good only when egoism is mingled with (<em>bhakti</em> ). The same condemnation would hold good in the case of <em>prapatti</em> also, when it is mingled with egoism or ahankāra.</p>
<p>It is stated by some that Alavandar begs, in the following <em>śloka</em>, forgiveness for having performed <em>prapatti</em> - &ldquo;In consideration* of my grandfather, Nāthamuni, and ignoring what I myself have done, vouchsafe unto me Thy grace.&rdquo; Here Alavandar is not seeking pardon for the <em>prapatti</em> which he performed in accordance with the _Śāstra_s, on the ground that the performance was an offence. He is seeking pardon for any trace af egoism (ahaṅkāra) that might have been present in him and no more than that. If it were for having performed <em>prapatti</em>, he should beg the pardon (of the Lord) for having shown reverence to previous_ācārya_s, for this, too, would be an offence, being an action of his. Thus there would be no end to the making of apologies (anavasthā (i.e.) infinite regress). If it is argued that this second begging of forgiveness is both for itself and for other offences, it might also be argued that the previous performance of <em>prapatti</em> is also begging forgiveness for that action and for previous actions. If these fallacious arguments were adopted, it would follow that the ancients, too, sinned in performing <em>prapatti</em> and that it was not proper to show reverence to them. So the reverence shown in this stotra (by Alavandar) (to his grandfather etc,) at the beginning and at the end is either for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the <em>prapatti</em> done here or for removing any defects in the performance. As in this reverence shown to āchāryas, in <em>prapatti</em> and the like also, the doership that is subject to the will of another (viz <em>Iśvara</em> ) is no fault. There is a (wrong ) view that since the doership of the <em>jīva</em> is subject (to the will of <em>Iśvara</em> ), the self has no real doership and therefore if a man knows this real nature of his (that he is not a doer), none of the forbidden actions that might be performed by him will leave any stain on him. This view finds its refutation (also in what has been said so far.)</p>
<p>In the upanishads, it is stated that the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> should be like a child. Some writers argue from this that he might act just as he pleases (doing even forbidden things). &lsquo;Being like a child&rsquo; means &lsquo;remaining without revealing his &ldquo;greatness&rsquo; and this is established in the sūtra “Without revealing his greatness) for this fits in with the <em>vidyā</em>” (and not behaving in a childish manner.)</p>
<p>(The Gītā says :-)</p>
<p>&ldquo;To those that have not renounced their doership and the fruit of their actions, the fruits of their <em>karma</em>  will (certainly) follow and they will be of three kinds, what is undesirable, what is desirable and what is partly desirable and partly undesirable. These consequences of <em>karma</em> never affect those who have renounced.&rdquo; and &quot; He who, while performing an action, does not think that it is done by him and whose mind has no attachment to the fruits of that action &ndash; . he does not slay any one even though he has slain all those that live in these three worlds&rdquo;&lsquo;These passages do not refer, as shown in Gita_Bhāṣya_ to sins committed deliberately after the renunciation. Otherwise they would conflict with many _śāstra_s. Further the words &ldquo;though he has slain&rdquo; apply to what is done in a righteous war.</p>

<p>The contention that like a potent medicine which is taken now acting like a cure for unwholesome things that may be done in the future, <em>prapatti</em> will destroy any sins that might be committed after its performance - this contention is disproved by hundreds of texts in the _śruti_s and the stritis which are directly applicable to the <em>prapanna</em> and are not sublated by other texts.</p>
<p>In such _śloka_s as the following, Manu and others, too, prescribed the conditions under which transgressions may be permitted: &quot; When there is a real fear that want of food might cause death, if a man eats food obtained from wherever it was possible, he will not be tainted by the sin thereof, in the same way as mire does not stain ether (ākās&rsquo;a)&rdquo; &ldquo;At a time&rdquo; when there is a fear that want of food might cause death, the man that eats the food obtained by him, whatever the source might be, will not be stained by the sin thereof, in the same way as water does not wet the leaf of the lotus.&rdquo; That this rule applies equally to the man who knows or meditates on <em>Brahman</em> is seen stated in the <em>Sūtra</em> which says, &ldquo;At a time when death is feared ( owing to starvation ), the man (the man who meditates on <em>Brahman</em>) may eat any food, whatsoever, for the _śāstra_s say so ” and this is taught there with the help of an illustration<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> . Therefore the view that the self is not a doer and that it is entirely dependent (on <em>Iśvara</em>) and hence will not be stained by any sins committed after <em>prapatti</em> though they are deliberate and that no further <em>prapatti</em> need be performed (for their expiation) - this view is opposed to our siddhanta (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s doctrine ).</p>
<p>In this context some ( commentators) explain the meaning of vraja otherwise ((i.e. that it does not enjoin any action) and state that to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, there is no <em>upāya</em> to be adopted except the knowledge of relationship that is learnt from the sāstrās to exist between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>. They find support for this view in the following _śloka_s without comprehending their real purport. The <em>śloka_s are:- &ldquo;The self is the property of Bhagavan. He who considers his self as belonging to himself, is a thief of the self. Is there any form of sin that is not committed by him?&rdquo; &quot; Bhagavan controls all beings in the universe from within the sphere of the sun and He is the ruler over all. He is within your heart and if you have no quarrel with him, you need not go (on a pilgrimage) to the G_aṅga</em> or to Kurukṣetra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remember always that the Lord is the master, that the self or atma is His servant and that this relationship exists always by your very nature.&rdquo; This argument is opposed to the natural and self evident injunction for <em>bhakti</em> , <em>prapatti</em> and the like. Since listening to Vedanta and reflecting on it arise from mere desire, there is no need also to enjoin the knowledge (of relationship) which arises from the s&rsquo;astras. ( There is no need for the <em>Śāstra</em> to enjoin something which a man will do of his own accord). As is well known, it has been established (in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em>) that if knowledge which need not be enjoined is called the means of attaining <em>mukti</em>, it would be opposed to the injunction ordaining certain things for performance and there would be other objections too; (the injunction made in the _śāstra_s would serve no purpose at all).</p>
<p>If this is admitted, the knowledge of the relationship between the <em>jīva</em> and <em>Iśvara</em> is indirectly helpful to all aspirants to <em>mukti</em>, whatever <em>vidyā</em>  they may adopt. When a man has acquired this knowledge from the <em>śāstra_s, the question then arises “ What is the means or <em>upāya</em> for attaining <em>Bhagavān</em>, the Lord of <em>Śrī</em>, who is our master and who imparts unsurpassed bliss ?&quot; When this question has arisen, the answer is that these means or <em>upāya_s are certain other forms of knowledge (other than the knowledge of relationship) which are enjoined for the purpose in accordance with each man&rsquo;s competence and they are <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em>. Of these, <em>prapatti</em> is the surrender of the responsibility for one&rsquo;s protection along with its auxiliaries as stated in the following passage: &ldquo;When the question  arises : &quot; To whom is this self to be surrendered for protection ? the answer is &ldquo;To <em>Viṣṇu</em> &ldquo;. In order to show that this (<em>prapatti</em>) should be performed with the knowledge of the relationship existing between one&rsquo;s self and <em>Iśvara</em>, it was stated that <em>prapatti</em> is the knowledge of the relationship. (It does not mean that <em>prapatti</em> is merely that knowledge and nothing else). We have already described at great length the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of this <em>prapatti</em>, its auxiliaries and the like (pages</em></em>______).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the means as well as the end to be attained. The aspirant (to.<em>mukti</em>) should become subject to me and seek my protection. The <em>upāya</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em> is not the direct means for the attainment. Sadhanas or means like <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> and <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> are no aids to <em>prapatti</em>; other troublesome _aṅga_s are not required for <em>prapatti</em>. I will myself stand in the place of all such means (as are prescribed for attaining the desired fruits). I am the messenger and the master. Seek me as your refuge and be free from all anxiety&rdquo;. So says the Lord and surrounds me on all sides).</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD AHAM (1) IN</p>
<p>THE SECOND HALF OF THE <em>ŚLOKA</em>                  page587</p>
<p>Thus in the first half of the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa enjoins, for a particular person (adhikārī), the adoption of that <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>) which is referred to in the first part of <em>Dvaya</em> and which has (in itself) the potency of all _dharma_s or rites and, at the same time a peculiar and unique potency of its own which none of them possesses (for it can destroy even that <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate and yield its consequences). He has explained that this <em>upāya</em> does not require any special or ancillary _dharma_s on the part of the adhikārī and has to be performed only once. In the second half of the <em>śloka</em>, he graciously explains, at length, the fruit to be attained (by adopting this <em>upāya</em>), which is (only) briefly indicated by the word <em>namas</em> in the second part of <em>Dvaya</em>. In the first half of the <em>śloka</em>, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa stated that which has to be done by the person or adhikārī (seeking <em>mukti</em>). In the second half. He states what He, as the Saviour who has accepted the responsibility of protecting, will perform and comforts the man who has done what he ought to do (i.e.) performed <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>Here from the first person singular, _mokṣa_yiṣyāmi (I) will set Thee free). (from this) itself, the meaning &rsquo;l&rsquo; is evident. So the use of the word <em>aham</em> (I) has the purpose of indicating. by virtue of its meaning, the power of accomplishing what is to others impossible, for this is essential for setting (one) free from all sins. Its purport is this:- &ldquo;I that bound the offender with fetters and that am destitute of equals and superiors am now full of compassion as the result of a <em>vyāja</em> or pretext and am bent on granting him pardon. (When I am thus inclined) there is no one to prevent me. Nor is there any one else who is capable of making him attain freedom (from sins)&rdquo;. This idea is well-known from such passages as the following:&ndash;&quot;<em>Bhagavān</em> <em>Viṣṇu</em> is the giver of <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. &ldquo;The _jīva_s have been bound with the bonds of <em>karma</em> by the Supreme Being for His līlā and they can be liberated from these bonds only by Him. No one else is capable of doing so.&rdquo; In this word <em>aham</em> (1), <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s natural compassion is the superior aiding force and the graciousness of the Lord which results from <em>prapatti</em> acts as a subordinate aiding force and His independence and omnipotence, which are irresistible, stand as the foremost and siree ageury to dispel all obstacles. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows.&ndash;. &ldquo;His natural compassion makes Him so gracious as to overlook countless offences in consideration of some slight <em>vyāja</em> or pretext. This graciousness accompanied by compassion makes the Lord&rsquo;s independence and omnipotence operate for the removal of all hindrances that stand in the way of prapannas. &lsquo;Thus <em>Iśvara</em>, who has all the qualities essential for granting freedom from all sins, can act towards that end without requiring any aid. This is the purport of the <em>aham</em> or (I) and it amounts to saying &quot; I myself (without the help of anybody else)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD TWĀ (THEE) :  page588</p>
<p>The word <em>tvā</em> (Thee) means: Thou that hast acquired the power of discrimination (viveka) necessary to understand the (nature of the) three _tattva_s (reals) viz., <em>cit</em>, <em>acit</em> and <em>Iśvara</em>, and hast realised such defects or demerits as triviality and transience which are inherent in such ends of life as wealth and lordship, Thou that art eager to attain the supreme end of life which consists in attaining me, Thou that hast given up all connexion with extremely difficult upăyas which have been taught for that purpose, Thou that hast surrendered the responsibility for protecting to me who is the object of attainment and who is capable of removing all obstacles, Thou that having done what ought to be done, hast nothing else to do towards the attainment of the desired fruit</p>
<p>THE MEANINGS OF SARVA PĀPEBHYO (FROM ALL</p>
<p>SINS) : page589</p>
<p>Having thus referred to the Dispenser of <em>mukti</em> who is capable of putting the <em>jīva</em> in bondage or out of it and also to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> who is incapable (of any endeavour) and who has surrendered (to the Lord) the responsibility for his protection, the <em>śloka</em> proceeds to speak of the bonds in the word sarvapūpebhyo (from all sins). Sin is the cause of evil and what it is can be understood from the śāstras. Evil means &lsquo;becoming subject to what is disagreeable and losing what is agreeable.&rsquo; Here (in the <em>carama</em> - <em>śloka</em>) sin denotes also acts of merit (puṇya) which lead to enjoyment in <em>samsāra</em> (which includes <em>svarga</em>), for they, too, are to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, productive of undesirable fruits. It has been said:-&ldquo;This <em>svarga</em> and other such places are, my child, like hell when compared with the abode of the Supreme Being&rdquo;. Thus to the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, even such places as <em>svarga</em> are like hell. In the case of the aspirant, therefore, that which leads to <em>svarga</em> is, in no way, different from that which leads to hell. That is why the aspirant to <em>mukti</em> is enjoined to give up those means which lead to <em>dharma</em>, artha (wealth) and kāma (pleasure), in the same way as he is enjoined to give up sinful actions. Indeed the _Śruti_s and the _Smṛti_s declare that good deeds and evil deeds are both to be avoided by the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, for it is stated &ldquo;Giving up puṇya and papa of which are both of the nature, <em>karma</em> which are hard to give up etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus having denoted, by the word <em>pāpa</em> (sins), both <em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>, which are the causes of bondage, the <em>śloka</em> indicates, by the plural of the word <em>pāpa</em> (viz. pāpebhyah), their being countless. If so, it may be asked what purpose is served by the word sarva (all). (The answer is) the word &lsquo;all&rsquo; is used for the purpose of including among the hosts of sins, <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, the past impressions (vāsanas) which create a liking for adverse things, the taste (ruchi) for evil things and the contact with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter both in its gross state and in its subtle state (in pralaya), for these are the causes of <em>karma</em>  and also the products of <em>karma</em>. (In the <em>Śaraṇāgati</em> <em>Gadya</em>), <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> has, in three clauses _cūrṇika_s, indicated, both explicitly by the words themselves and implicitly from their meaning, those hindrances or obstacles which are referred to in ‘all sins’. The three passages begin with <em>manovākkāyaih</em>&rsquo; (by mind, speech and body).</p>
<p>(A question might arise in this connection):- It is said, “Having administered the affairs entrusted to them by the Lord for a long time and again and again, they reach the end of their <em>karma</em>  and attain <em>mukti</em>, where _jīva_s who were formerly _Brahma_s, Indras, and Rudras, are enjoying bliss in Paramapada (the supreme abode).&rdquo; (So also) it is said: &ldquo;Those that have been appointed (by the Supreme Being) to be administrators should remain here in the world of <em>samsāra</em>) until the expiry of their period of administration&rdquo;. (We find also the following :-) The man who adopts a <em>bhakti</em>  or <em>upāsana</em> as the means will have the benefit of the destruction (the fruits of) such karmas (<em>puṇya</em> and <em>pāpa</em>) as have not begun to yield their consequences at the very beginning of this <em>upāsana</em>; for (it is said) that there will be delay (for their attaining <em>mukti</em>) till the enjoyment is completed of those karmas that have began to operate (prā rabdha). This is applicable even to those who are not administrators. The question may be asked:- &ldquo;If so, what is the meaning of saying that the Lord will pardon also in the case of the <em>prapanna</em>) those <em>karma</em> s which have began to operate and yield their fruits ?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:- “Even in the case of karmas which have begun to bear fruit, if the man who has adopted <em>prapatti</em> as the direct and independent <em>upāya</em> considers as evil and undesirable those parts which would lead to another birth or (even) another day&rsquo;s existence and grieves on that account, <em>Iśvara</em> will give him pardon even in respect of all that <em>karma</em>. If the <em>prapanna</em> is so impatient as to feel that he cannot bear to live without the immediate attainment of <em>mokṣa</em>, the lord will, at that very instant, pardon even all that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to bear fruit so that no trace of it may be left over. Therefore there is no reason why one should not pray for pardon even in respect of that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to bear fruit (<em>prārabdha</em>).</p>
<p>(In the _Śaraṇāgatigadya _ Śrī Rāmānuja says:-) &ldquo;Pardon all sins without exception, (sins) past, future, and present - committed by the mind, the speech, or the body.&rdquo; Here past (sins) refer to those committed before <em>prapatti</em> and future (sins) refer to those that might be committed after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. We do not see any sins committed at the instant of performing <em>prapatti</em>. What, then, is the meaning of present <em>(kriyamāṇa</em>) sins? (The answer is):- By the word &lsquo;present&rsquo; (<em>kriyamāṇa</em>) is meant that which was begun before and which will be completed in future? According to this definition, those sins which were begun before and which require a long time for their completion and thus that might be done on account of negligence or carelessness at the instant of performing <em>prapatti</em> - these are called present (sins) - Future (sins) are those that may begin after <em>prapatti</em>. Among those sins which are committed after <em>prapatti</em> and which may be partly of the present and partly of the future, those which are not committed deliberately will be pardoned by <em>Iśvara</em> and will leave no trace at all (on the self). Those that are committed deliberately can be atoned for by the performance again of <em>prapatti</em>, for it is said:-&ldquo;If an offence be committed, expiation should be made therefor and the expiation to be made is only the performance of <em>prapatti</em> again.&rdquo; When it is said that if <em>Iśvara</em> is bent on granting <em>mokṣa</em>, even deadly sins cannot stand in the way, and that there will be no punishment for sins committed delibe. rately after <em>prapatti</em>, what is meant is not that there is no need for expiation or <em>prāyaścitta</em>, but that if <em>Iśvara</em> is again propitiated by <em>prapatti</em>, (which is the <em>prāyaścitta</em>), <em>mokṣa</em> is sure to follow. It is the result of God&rsquo;s forgiveness that the man is induced to perform expiation by a further <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>It has been said (by some _ācārya_s) that, to <em>Iśvara</em>, the sins or offences of the <em>jīva</em> are (agreeable) like the dirt on the body of a beloved wife and like the slime on the body of the newborn calf to the cow. This only means that even if wicked men should perform <em>prapatti</em>, <em>Iśvara</em> will not forsake them and will bring them round to righteous ways. It does not mean that sins committed deliberately would give delight to <em>Iśvara</em>. If so, the <em>prapanna</em> should have, by all the means in his power, to commit such sins.</p>
<p>Even if offences are committed deliberately owing to the peculiar nature of a man&rsquo;s <em>prakṛti</em>, and even if a further <em>prapatti</em> is not performed (by way of expiation), it is the peculiar characteristic of <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s forgiveness that He sees to it that such prapannas do not go to hell and that He awards them light punishments (sufferings) as (kings do) in the case of their offending sons. Sins lead to sufferings that are seen and that are t_aṅgī_ble and also to sufferings like those in hell. So when it is said that there is no hell for the <em>prapanna</em> as in the following _śloka_s :- “Those who consider <em>Viṣṇu</em>, the bearer of <em>ṣārṅga</em>, as the supreme end of life and who perform <em>prapatti</em> to Him never go to the world of Yama&rdquo; and “Whatever be the family into which they are born, and wherever they may live, those who are ever attached to <em>Vāsudeva</em> never go to hell&quot; when such statements are made to the effect that there is no hell for them, there is nothing in them to deny that they will not have any sufferings in this life itself (like blindness). Logic cannot repudiate explicit statements (made in the <em>śruti</em> and the smṛti). It is idle to say that, even in some of those who have committed offences and who have not repented for them by performing a further <em>prapatti</em>. we do not see such visible sufferings as blindness which are stated to be their punishments. Even in their lives, we may see such sufferings as the following in accordance with the seriousness of their offences :&ndash; many varieties of suffering due to the three well-known causes (the elements of nature, the body and supernatural powers), dullness of the intelligence required for the Lord&rsquo;s service, the diminution of delight and the absence of it in the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, the absence of delight in rendering service to <em>Bhagavān</em> and His devotees, offences against the Lord and His devotees, the censure, the boycott and the like by the virtuous, the destruction of their good deeds, the loss of the esteem in which they were formerly held by good men, the suffering done in the frustration of their ambitions and desires, and such other  forms of sorrow. It is well-known from the _śruti_s, the <em>Dharma</em> _śāstra_s of Manu and others and from the Itihasas, Purāṇas and the <em>Pāñcarātra</em> that, for varied kinds of sins of omission and commission, there are varied kinds of visible suffering. Therefore when blindness and the like are taken by way of example, it should be taken only as one instance (and not as an invariable form of suffering). This is evident from the opening words of the sentence which speak of sufferings in the world in general,</p>
<p>It is not possible to argue, with any certainty, that the varied sufferings which come to a man as the fruit of sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> and which find support in the authority of the texts are due to past <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit. These may come as the result of either of the two kinds of <em>karma</em> . That is why good men (_sātvika_s) dread offences that might be committed deliberately. If this were otherwise, it would be opposed to the śāstra which enjoins a further <em>prapatti</em> and to the code of conduct followed by virtuous men and to ancient tradition.</p>
<p>(It is true) Nanjiyar stated that if a man does not feel repentant after committing an offence, he should be considered as without knowledge. But what is meant is that his omission to repent is due to dullness of intelligence and not that the <em>prapatti</em> was not fulfilled. Deliberate offences which would meet with <em>Bhagavān</em>&rsquo;s disapproval would not be committed by some men as these result from conditions created by past <em>karma</em> . In the case of some others who commit such offences, repentance and the like put an end to them. Men of hard hearts may not repent at all. Therefore if deliberate offences happen to be committed, the man should repent and perform <em>prapatti</em> again. If he does not, they would lead to light punishments or sufferings in accordance with what is said in the śrutis and the like.</p>

<p>The Lord, whose will is irresistible and who creates, in the minds of those who do not care for him, all their desires and who also frustrates them &ndash; the Lord has turned my mind today froni <em>samsāra</em> or bondage and has placed me beneath His two feet for protection. He has been pleased to forget His wrath caused by my actions in the past prompted by my mind before the performance of <em>prapatti</em> and has appeared already (as avatars and <em>arcā</em>) to grant me <em>mukti</em>.

<p>THE MEANING OF THE WORD _MOKṢA_YIṢYĀMI</p>
<p>(I WILL SET THEE FREE)   page595</p>
<p>The word _mokṣa_yishyami &lsquo;I will set thee free from all sins means &ldquo;I will grant thee release (from the bondage of <em>samsāra</em>) at the time when you want it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked :&ndash;&quot;(ln another context) the. Lord says, “I will never pardon&quot;. Is it not opposed to what is stated here viz. &ldquo;I will set thee free from all sins?&rdquo;; therefore this should be merely to give a little seeming comfort in words and is not to be taken literally.&quot; The answer to this question is as follows:&ndash;</p>
<p>• There is no conflict between these two statements for they apply to different cases. &ldquo;I will not forgive&rdquo; occurs in the <em>śloka</em> : “Though a man adores me with a hundred lotuses, O Goddess of the earth, whichever  devotee of <em>Viṣṇu</em> touches blood even unawares I will not pardon him. I will never pardon his offence, O Goddess of the Earth, even if he tries to show me a hundred marks of reverent attention (upacāra)&quot;. It only means  &ldquo;I will not forgive the man for such trivial forms of expiation (as the offering of lotuses and external marks of attention). Here in the <em>Caramaśloka</em>, the word <em>mokṣayiṣyami</em> (means “I will forgive all (offences) if the man adopts the particular <em>upāya</em> which is an atonement for all sins.” The intention of the Saviour is expressed indeed in the <em>śloka</em> :&mdash;&ldquo;Be it Vibhīṣaṇa or Rāvaṇa himself, bring him here, O Sugrīva. I will grant him pardon.&rdquo; These words are not seeming-pleasant, for there is no conflict between what is stated (in Varāhapurāṇam) and what is stated in the Gita, as they apply to different situations. If they are to be taken as only seeming-pleasant, all the texts in the _Śāstra_s which enjoin <em>bhakti</em>  and <em>prapatti</em> would be void of authority,</p>
<p>Here “Releasing from sins &quot; means <em>Iśvara</em> giving up His intention to punish the sinner for having violated His commands from beginningless time. By this turning away (of <em>Iśvara</em>) from the thought of punishment, the effects of His punishment, such as <em>avidyā</em> or ignorance, would all cease to exist. <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s turning away from the thought of punishment means His will which takes the form: “By my grace will the man who performs all his duties as for me and as being done by me attain the world that is eternal&rdquo;. The cessation of such things as a_vidyā_ in the <em>jīva</em> means the expansion of intelligence, knowledge, wisdom and such others.</p>
<p>The manner and the order in which the causes of <em>samsāra</em>, which are of the nature of puṇya and papa will disappear are as follows - The hindrances to the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> have disappeared already by their respective causes (such as the performance of the rites and duties of _varṇa_s and _āśrama_s), then the puṇyas and papas done before the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> which are opposed to the attainment (of <em>mukti</em>) will disappear without any trace at the beginning of the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>, provided they are not such as have already begun to yield their fruit (prarabdha). Among sins committed after <em>prapatti</em>, those offences which may be committed without any awareness of them and which are the result of unfavourable conditions of place, time and the like will not in the least taint (the self). Those offences which are committed deliberately when there is no danger of death will cease either by some form of atonement or expiation which is within the man&rsquo;s power or by experiencing the fruit of the <em>karma</em>  which would be of the nature of a light punishment. That portion of the <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit to the <em>prapanna</em> that will have to be experienced within the time desired by him (for <em>mukti</em>) will disappear either by the experience or enjoyment of the fruit or by an intervening rite of expiation. That which remains will disappear by the potency of the <em>upāya</em> (<em>prapatti</em>).</p>
<p>Among those good deeds (puṇya) which are done deliberately with thought both (of <em>mokṣa</em> and of <em>samsāra</em>), such as are not hindrances and such good deeds (puṇya) done before and after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> by the upasaka as are capable of strengthening his <em>vidyā</em> or Meditation &ndash; these will disappear after having yielded their fruit. Those good deeds (puṇya) done before and after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> (namely, <em>upāsana</em>) which are of no use to the meditation or <em>vidyā</em> and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit and those good deeds, done before and after, which are useful for the meditation but which have had no occasion to yield their fruit owing to the superior strength of (other) <em>karma</em>  favourable for the meditation and unfavourable for it and which still remain without yielding their fruit - these too, will disappear in the last moments of the man&rsquo;s life. This truth is expressed in the sütra &ldquo;By the same principle, the deeds, too, which are other than sinful will not stain (the self).&rdquo; Those good deeds (which are the cause of rain, food and the like which are necessary for the performance of the <em>vidyā</em>) will cease to exist immediately after the fall of the body&quot;.</p>
<p>Since those good deeds which were performed solely for pleasing the Lord and which were merely of the nature of service have already yielded their fruit, there is no need to speak about their staining the self. Those deeds which were performed by the man for setting an exanıple to the rest of the world (lokasangraha) had to be performed as commands of the Lord. They are of the nature of pure <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service and have already given their fruits. Among them, if any such good deeds were done without the renunciation of egoism (sātvikatyāga) out of carelessness, they, too, would amount to sins as stated in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;<em>Tapas</em> is no sin, the study of the <em>Veda</em> is no sin, the rites and duties prescribed for each man are no sins, nor is the earning of money by hard work for their sake a sin. If these very things are done with a wrong intention with the thought, “I am doing this and doing this for myself&rdquo;, they become sinful&quot;. These (sins) will become subject to the release promised in <em>mokṣayiṣyāmi</em>. Those prapattis that were performed for other ends (than <em>mukti</em>) must have already yielded their fruit.</p>
<p>For the sake of the end for which a former <em>prapatti</em> was performed, a second or further <em>prapatti</em> ought not to be performed, as it would be inconsistent with the potency of <em>prapatti</em> and with the intense and great faith with which the first <em>prapatti</em> was performed. If one were to perform more than one <em>prapatti</em> for the sake of a single end in view, it would be like adopting another <em>upāya</em> (and there would be need for atonement).</p>
<p>The disappearance or destruction of past <em>karma</em>  means <em>Iśvara</em>&rsquo;s giving up the thought of awarding the person the fruit thereof. When <em>karma</em>  is said not to stain or taint the self (<em>aśleṣa</em>), it means that the thought of awarding the fruit or consequence of the <em>karma</em>  in the case of those who have sought His protection does not even arise in <em>Iśvara</em>.</p>
<p>If it be asked, “(It is stated in the _śruti_s that the good deeds and the bad deeds of the man who is to obtain <em>mukti</em> will be distributed among his friends and his foes respectively (at the last moment of his life). If good deeds and bad deeds for past karna) are all destroyed in the manner described above, how can this distribution take place ?&quot; The answer is: The distribution among foes and friends will be, respectively, of those evil deeds which are said not to taint and to be destroyed, (<em>aśleṣa</em> and <em>vināśa</em>) and those good deeds (puṇya) which are done deliberately after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and which have been prevented from yielding their fruit by stronger <em>karma</em> . (It is said in the _śruti_s) that <em>Iśvara</em> distributes these among the man&rsquo;s friends and foes at the time of his death, Why should <em>Iśvara</em> wait until the time of the man&rsquo;s death for this distribution, when He could as well have done so, at the very beginning when the man adopted the <em>upāya</em> ?&quot; The answers to these questions are as follows: &ldquo;A man may have behaved with favourable intentions towards the devotee at first, but later he may change and behave with evil intentions. In such circumstances the good deeds should not have already been given away to the friend (who has afterwards turned foe). Further the Lord desires to give opportunities to foes who have done evil to the devotee to beg for forgiveness. These are the reasons why <em>Iśvara</em> does not effect the transfer of the good and the bad <em>karma</em>  until the last moments of the devotee.</p>
<p>The good deeds done by a man for the sake of such ends as <em>svarga</em> are, to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, of the nature of sins (papa).. Hence such good deeds (of the devotee) will not be transferred to his friend, if the latter is an aspirant for <em>mukti</em>.</p>
<p>It may be asked,  &ldquo;What is the meaning of transferring the <em>karma</em> s performed by one man to some others?&rdquo; The answer is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The punishment or reward which <em>Iśvara</em> intended to award to those who performed these <em>karma</em> s is now transferred to his foes and friends in equal measure,&rdquo; It may be asked, “If punishments and rewards for the karmas performed by one man are to be awarded to some other man or men, would there not be too wide an application (<em>atiprasaṅga</em>) (i.e.) the punishment does not go to the evildoer but to somebody else who has not done evil. It is also against the principle that he who sowed must reap the harvest&rdquo;. The answer is this:- There will be no such unfairness due to too wide an application (<em>atiprasaṅga</em>), because the rewards and punishments are awarded in accordance with the obligations or offences done, respectively, by these friends and foes to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>. That is why it is nowhere stated that these good deeds and bad deeds are transferred to those who are neither friends nor foes. The word &rsquo;transfer’ is used here in the sense that (their friends and foes) will have fruits similar to those of the karmas said to be transferred. This <em>śruti</em> which speaks of the transfer of good and bad deeds suggests the extreme of pleasure and displeasure that the Lord would feel, if the obligations and offences are done to the_ jñānī_ (the man of wisdom) who is extremely dear to the Lord.</p>
<p>If we take the *[^f1] interpretation given in the <em>śloka</em> (on page __________), <em>sarva pāpebhyah</em> (from all sins) would briefly include, as desired by the man, all hindrances to the attainment of the Lord, all hindrances to the proper adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and also the causes of experiencing disagreeable things.</p>
<p>Here the hindrance to the attainment of the Lord is the Lord&rsquo;s will that the offender shall not enjoy Him. The hindrance to the <em>upāya</em> is the Lord&rsquo;s will that the offender shall not understand Him aright and do what is necessary to propitiate Him. The causes of experiencing disagreeable things consist in the will of God that the man shall experience the consequences or fruits of doing such karmas as displeased Him.</p>
<p>If all punishments are cancelled in the case of the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, the effects of such punishments, namely, contact with <em>acit</em> and the like will stand cancelled by the Lord&rsquo;s grace which cancelled the punishments. Thereafter since there are no causes, there will be no such effects as disagreeable experiences. This is indicated in the <em>sūtra</em>: &ldquo;The man who has attained  <em>mokṣa</em> will never return to <em>samsāra</em>, for the śrutis say so&rdquo;, These conclusions are within the reach of the knowledge of those very wise men who have studied <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> for a long time along with the traditions of the good.</p>
<p>Thus (the words) &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo; speak of the removal of the stream of all hindrances which are of the nature of either causes (the Lord&rsquo;s will to punish) or effects (a_vidyā_ and the like); it means the same thing as saying that the self will (then) have the manifestation (āvirbhāva) of the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>. For Bhagavan Śaunaka says:-&ldquo;When the dirt is washed away, the gem shines of itself, but the sheen is not newly produced. In the saine way, when the self casts off its blemishes or faults, <em>jñāna</em> is not newly created in it (for it is already there). When a tank is dug, water and space are not newly created. What is already present is now brought to manifestation. How can a thing which did not exist before arise anew? So by the casting off of evil qualities, good qualities like jnūna shine forth. They are not newly produced, for it has been stated (in the _śāstra_s) that they are eternal qualities of the self&rdquo;. Since the substance called <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge and its inherent power to cover all objects are both eternal, the right word to use is &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (i.e.) it is used in its primary sense.</p>
<p>(It is true that) the expansion of <em>jñāna</em> or knowledge to cover all objects, the freedom from pain, sorrow and the like. The will to do what is good and other such things and the forms of service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> arise anew. Still as their origin depends on the conditional factor (upādhi), namely, the removal of hindrances thereto, the word &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (<em>āvirbhāva</em>) is used in such places as the performance of different kinds of service which are natural to myself manifest itself.&quot; This is in order to show that when the hindrances disappear, these services will automatically follow. (In the state of <em>samsāra</em>), the objects (in the Universe) which are all the glorious possessions of <em>Bhagavān</em> appear disagreeable in various ways or (only) slightly agreeable as a result of the conditioning factor (<em>upādhi</em>), namely, <em>karma</em> . In the state of <em>mokṣa</em>, they would all become agreeable (since <em>karma</em>  has disappeared), as agreeableness is their natural quality. Therefore in that state, too, the word &lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; (of agreeableness) may justly be used. Therefore the words &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&quot;make it evident that the self will have a new state in which all things will manifest their natural agreeableness to it.</p>
<p>If the word <em>ekam</em> means the identity of the <em>upāya</em> and the <em>upeya</em> or the end of attainment (as has already been indicated), this attainment of the desired end is also made plain. Therefore the idea that was expressed clearly in the <em>śloka</em> (Gītā - 18 - 65), namely “Thou wilt come to me&rdquo; may be considered to be stated in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em> (also) by the meaning implicit in the word ekam, and by the statement that the hindrances to that attainment are destroyed &mdash;-(I will release thee from all sins). Therefore the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> cannot be said to supplement or explain what has been stated in the preceding <em>śloka</em>.[^f2] *</p>
<p>Here an objection that has no soundness in it may be raised to this effect:-&ldquo;When it is said &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo;, does it follow from those words alone that the release from sins would lead to the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> stated in &ldquo;Thou wilt reach me?&rdquo; Is it not possible that, with the removal or pardon of all sins, the self may attain the state called <em>kaivalya</em> in which it enjoys only itself without attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> ? That there is a state called <em>kaivalya</em>, has, it is well known, been declared in such treatises as Nāradīya kalpam, where we find the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;This <em>mantra</em> enables a man to obtain wealth and lordship in this world, <em>svarga</em> and the like in the world beyond, kaivalya (the enjoyment of one&rsquo;s own self) and the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>&rdquo;. Alavandar also says &quot; To those who desire to have wealth and lordship, the enjoyment of their own self dissociated from the body and, likewise, the performance of <em>kaiṅkarya</em> or service at the feet of the Lord etc. etc.&rdquo; He says also (elsewhere):  Without the grace  of <em>Lakṣmī</em>, the beloved consort of the Lord with the lotus eyes, we cannot have the valuable things desired (by men) in <em>samsāra</em>, the enjoyment of the disembodied self (in kaivalya) and the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>&quot;. In the <em>Gadya</em>, also, is found quoted (the sentence) in Jitante stotra - “Leaving all desired pleasures and the enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, I have reached Thy feet.&quot; This truth is also stated at length in <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>&rsquo;s Gitā_Bhāṣya_ and such other writings. Therefore should not the freedom from all sins which results from the statement &ldquo;I will release thee from all sins&rdquo; be considered common to kaivalya and the enjoyment of Bhagavan ?&quot;.</p>
<p>The objection (stated so far) is unsound for the following reasons:- &quot; If all sins have disappeared, there is no reason why the self should be without the experience of <em>Bhagavān</em>, which is its natural and inherent right. Therefore the state of the enjoyment of the mere self (<em>kaivalya</em>) without the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> would not be the goal of attainment then. Hence in that state (<em>kaivalya</em>), (we should understand that) the <em>karma</em> s which produce wealth, and such sufferings as old age and death have disappeared but that the <em>karma</em>  which is a hindrance to the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> has not yet been destroyed. This state (of kaivalya) is a particular kind of enjoyment which consists in the experience of one&rsquo;s own disembodied self. Of this state it has been said :-&ldquo;lo that experience of the self, the self feels that there is nothing greater than it&rdquo;, and also, “If a man desires! this enjoyment of the (disembodied) self, these three (<em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em>, <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> and <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>) will enable him to attain that extreme which is called kaivalya&quot;. As stated (in these _śloka_s), this experience in which there is neither contact with <em>acit</em> or matter nor enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> and which results from the adoption of a particular <em>upāya</em> within the man&rsquo;s ability was called <em>kaivalya</em>, because it is the enjoyment of the mere (kevala) self without association with either <em>acit</em> or <em>Bhagavān</em>. qq604</p>
<p>(In some places) <em>mukti</em> or the attainment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is called by the word <em>kaivalya</em> in order to show that all upādhis or conditioning factors have ceased to exist in <em>mukti</em>. So also the word <em>mukti</em> is sometimes employed to denote the experience of the disembodied self as in the <em>śloka</em> &ldquo;O, Lord of Hastigiri,&rdquo; I look upon all the enjoyments of this world, the title of <em>Brahma</em>, the high position of Rudra, and the experience of the disembodied self, which is called <em>mukti</em> - I look upon these as water poured in the soil saturated with salt. I know the bliss of rendering service to Thee&quot;. The word <em>mukti</em> employed here should be explained as in the <em>śloka</em> :- &quot; The man who is free from desire, fear and anger - he is always a <em>mukta</em> (aven here in <em>samsāra</em>). It only means &ldquo;He resembles a <em>mukta</em>&rdquo;. It may be asked &ldquo;Is it (<em>kaivalya</em>) not stated to be freedom from old age, and death ? &quot; The answer is that it is just like calling the gods immortal (amara), (That is : they are not truly immortal.) Compared</p>
<p>with human beings, they may be said to be relatively immortal, for they live much longer. Or it may be explained as stating that <em>kaivalya</em> will lead, in course of time, to <em>mukti</em>. In the same way should be explained the use of the word <em>mukti</em> when it is intended to mean merely the attainment of the same abode or loka as that of <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> the vibhavas or vyuhas and also samipya and sārūpya.</p>
<p>It has been declared that real <em>mukti</em> is different from the others in the (following) <em>śloka</em>:-&ldquo;Some live  in the worlds of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. This is sālokyam (living in the same loka or world as <em>Viṣṇu</em>). Some reach near Him. This is sāmipyam (attaining a place near <em>Viṣṇu</em>). Some others attain a form resembling that of <em>Viṣṇu</em>. This is sārupyam (having a form resembling His). Others still attain sayujyam and it is this which goes by the name <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. The sayujyam referred to here is going to Paramapada and enjoying the same bliss as that of <em>Bhagavān</em> (and this alone is real and true <em>mukti</em>). That the experience of the mere disembodied self is not eternal and that it is not real <em>mokṣa</em> are evident from these _śloka_s :- &ldquo;There are four kinds of people who are mine and who are called my devotees. Among them, those who are exclusively attached to me (ekantins) are the best, for they worship no other deities. To these men who perform their duties and rites without any attachment or desire for their fruit. I am alone the goal. The other three virtuous kinds of bhaktas or devotees are said to be desirous of certain ends. All these (three) are liable to fall (from their high state) but the jnani (who is an <em>ekāntin</em> attains <em>mokṣa</em> &quot; (Again it is said) : &quot; Having  listened to this story, the man who has lost his wealth will become free from the sorrow due to it; the man (jijnasu) who wants to enjoy his disembodied self will attain <em>bhakti</em>  or devotion (to the Lord), the <em>bhakta</em> or devotee will attain <em>mokṣa</em>&rdquo;. This amounts to stating that the jijnasuh spoken of in the Gita, who is desirous of experiencing his self, will, in course of time, become a jnani. It has been said :- “When the attachment to the pleasures of life ceases, the self, which is different from the body and which is happy, will become manifest. Without being caught (in this state) viz, kaivalya, if you want to realise that your essential nature consists in being <em>śeṣa</em> to <em>Bhagavān</em> and in being eternal, get hold of <em>Bhagavān</em> and then give up the pleasures of worldly objects.&rdquo; In this (Tamil verse) the enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> is said to be eternal and the experience of the disembodied self, which is distinguished fronı it, is indirectly stated to be not eternal. (It is true that) the experience of the measureless self is described as imperishable or without changes like diminution or increase; - like the statement of the fruit of the rite called <em>cāturmāsya</em> being imperishable; it only means that it will last for a very long time (i.e.) many and many a kalpa (and not that it is eternal). This locality where the self enjoys itself is thus described :&ndash; &quot; The place called the <em>amṛtam</em> of yogis is the place to which those who want to enjoy their own self go.&quot; That this locality is not Paramapada is also evident from another siloka in the very same context: &ldquo;Those who are yogins and who, being ekāntins, are constantly meditating on <em>Brahman</em>, reach that supreme abode which the eternal suris are gazing at. (It is clear from this, that the <em>ekāntin</em> who is desirous of attaining <em>Bhagavān</em> is here stated to go to a place other than that (to which the man who is desirous of enjoying his self would go) and that it is a place gazed at by the suris,</p>
<p>In such treatises as <em>Śrī</em> <em>Bhāṣya</em> (and Gitā_Bhāṣya_ ) it has been stated that those who meditate on their self with <em>Brahman</em> as its inner self as in Pañcāgni-<em>vidyā</em> and the like pass (after death) along the <em>arcirādi</em> route and attain <em>Brahman</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore to those that meditate on their self according to the <em>Pañcāgni vidyā</em>, there is an intermediate result or experience consisting in the enjoyment of the mere self. However, according to the principle explained in the madhu <em>vidyā</em>, they will ultimately attain <em>Brahman</em>. If, however, the meditation is on the self either as associated with <em>prakṛti</em> or matter or as disembodied or dissociated from matter, whether the self is meditated on in its essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) or as if it were <em>Brahman</em>, &ndash; in all these four cases, as when name (nāma) and the like are meditated on as if they were (<em>Brahman</em>), there is neither the passage along the arcirādi route for the attainment of <em>Brahman</em>. This is declared in the following :&ndash; Bādarāyana is of opinion that the Ativāhikās (escorts) lead those who do not meditate on pratikas (i.e.) parts or aspects (of <em>Brahman</em>). In either of the other alternatives, there is conflict (with the _śruti_s) and also with the principle of tat-kratu. In another context to prove that the being meditated on in that <em>vidyā</em> is (not the <em>jīva</em> (but) the Supreme Being or <em>Brahman</em>, the Sūtrakāra gives this as his reason for saying so: &ldquo;Since the person who meditates according to this <em>vidyā</em> is said to pass along the archirādi route.” This is done in the sūtra “since  mention<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> *  is made of the route meditated on by those who have listened to the Upaniṣads” (i.e.) to those who meditate on <em>Brahman</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore to those who do not attain <em>Brahman</em>, there should not have been the cancellation of all sins spoken of in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>. To those whose sins have been pardoned or cancelled, there is no limitation in regard to the enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>, Thus since in this <em>śloka</em>, the annulment of all sins is declared, (we have to understand that) even that particular <em>karma</em>  which resulted in the experience of the mere self and which stood as a hindrance to the fall and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em> is annulled or cancelled. From this it would follow that what is stated in the previous <em>śloka</em> namely, &quot; &lsquo;Thou wilt attain myself” is declared in this <em>śloka</em> also <em>mām eva eṣyasi</em>. &ldquo;Thou wilt attain myself&rdquo; means &ldquo;the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Brahman</em>&rsquo;. In order that this perfect enjoyment may happen, the archirādi route has to be traversed and a particular region or locality has also to be reached.</p>
<p>It is clear from the _śāstra_s which speak of such things as this route that, from beginningless time, the independent and omnipotent Lord has made it a rule that the full and perfect enjoyment (of Himself) should be granted in this order (namely, the archiridi route, the entrance into the region or locality and then the enjoyment).</p>
<p>Before starting on the archirādi route, when a man understands the essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>) of <em>Brahman</em> with the help of the _śāstra_s and so also when he has a vision of <em>Brahman</em> with the help of <em>yoga</em> and when he reaches such worlds as those of *<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> <em>Vibhava</em>, the vision or realisation which he gets results from some specific good deeds and is dependent on the instruments of knowledge. Therefore this vision will be partial or limited and liable to interruption. But the vision that results in the state of <em>mukti</em> is full and perfect, because there are no factors that limit or diminish the experience nor is it liable to any further interruption or break, As an Overflow (parivāha) of this enjoyment arises the perfect service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> in which the <em>śeṣī</em> (the Lord) finds delight and this idea is expressed in the <em>śloka</em>: &ldquo;Though you live for a hundred years, I will always be your servant. Therefore give me orders saying . &quot; Do this in this beautiful place.&rdquo; Here all the successive stages of realisation (or fruit) which are stated (by <em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em> , in the (<em>Śaraṇāgati</em>) <em>Gadya</em> in the sentence with the word pāramarthika are also implicitly suggested in accordance with the _pramāṇa_s.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF ‘MĀ ŚUCHAH’ (DO NOT GRIEVE - DO</p>
<p>NOT DESPAIR)  page609</p>
<p>Thereafter the words,  &ldquo;Do not grieve” reveal the certainty of what has been stated before &ldquo;.</p>
<p>There are some commentators) who hold that &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo; enjoins something to be avoided. (According to them ), if, after a man has performed <em>prapatti</em>, he grieved or fell into despair, he would be violating the injunction and the Saviour who is the <em>upāya</em> would become indifferent and leave him to look after himself. The man would thus become liable, in their opinion, to this disadvantage or risk. This view is opposed to their own commentary on the sins committed deliberately after <em>prapatti</em> and on the words &quot; from all sins&rdquo;. It is also opposed to the texts in the śrutis and the _smṛti_s which declare that the Saviour will never forsake the man who has sought His protection. Therefore since all causes for grief or despair have disappeared in the case of the man who has adopted this <em>upāya</em>, it repeats that there is absolutely no cause for despair and aims at confirming the man&rsquo;s faith.</p>

</details>
<p>Many causes of sorrow (in the case of Arjuna) like those concerning the destruction of relatives have already been removed by appropriate and excellent teaching. Now the sorrow or despair caused by the thought that the <em>dharma</em> or rites enjoined (for <em>mukti</em>) are too difficult to perform, that the hindrances to <em>mukti</em> are insuperable and that the end in view can be attained only after protracted delay - it is this sorrow that is now dispelled.</p>
<p>(The Lord) intends to say: After I have taught you this <em>upāya</em>, which, without being too hard to adopt for the end desired by you, is also capable of annulling all hindrances that stand in the way and is not liable to cause any (undue) delay in the attainment of that aim &ndash; after this has been taught to you, there is no room for despair due to such things is the difficulty of adopting an <em>upāya</em>. If you adopt this <em>upāya</em>, your welfare is my burden or responsibility and I shall myself be interested in looking after it. If I do not protect you, it will be a reproach to me. You are, as it were, muy property or wealth (to look after) and there is no reason why you should grieve&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The grief that is here put an end to is not the old sorrow caused (in Arjuna&rsquo;s mind) by the thought of killing (his) relatives. It is a different kind of grief that has to be consistent with the context. If it be asked how, the answer is as follows :- &ldquo;The rich qualities  that distinguish the nature of the gods lead to <em>mokṣa</em>, the qualities that make for the nature of the Asuras are the causes that lead to bondage&rdquo;. When the two were thus distinguished, Arjuna was grieved at the thought of what he should do if he belonged to the class of Asuras. <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa, who understood this, said to him :- &ldquo;O Pandava! do not grieve. You are born to attain the rich qualities of the gods&rdquo;. Similarly here, when (Arjuna) is extremely desirous of attaining the supreme end, he grieves at the thought that the <em>upāya</em> taught so far has to be adopted for a long time, and is subject to many hindrances, while being extremely difficult of performance even for those who are very careful. At the thought of that <em>upāya</em> and of his own (want of) capacity for adopting it, he grieves, saying to himself &ldquo;How can I succeed in adopting this <em>upāya</em> and secure the end in view?&rdquo; To Arjuna who was in despair (at this thought), <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa shows another <em>upāya</em> which can be only performed in a single instant, which is without any obstacles, and which is (also) easy of performance. By doing so, He makes Arjuna care-free and certain in regard to the attainment of the desired end and then says, “ Do not grieve&rdquo;. So the words should certainly be understood as intended to dispel the despair due to such things as the difficulty of adopting the (former) <em>upāya</em>. (It is only this grief that is here put an end to and no other).</p>
<p>In this Bhagavadgītā, the <em>Gītācārya</em>, at first, imparts a knowledge of the difference between <em>prakṛti</em> (matter, the body) and the soul or self; then He describes <em>karma</em>  <em>yoga</em> and <em>jñāna</em> <em>yoga</em> which are indirect means leading to <em>mokṣa</em>; thereafter he teaches <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em> with its _aṅga_s, which has been enjoined as the direct means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and says:&ndash; &ldquo;Thus has been taught to you the jñāna which is the most secret of all secrets. Consider all these and then do what you desire to do&rdquo;. Though He perceived the dissatisfaction that passed over Arjuna&rsquo;s face at that instant, <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa did not at once favour him with instructions concerning the easier <em>upāya</em>, for it has been said: &ldquo;The Lord of the world tests the minds of those who are weak of heart&rdquo;. Instead of declaring the final conclusion by saying: &quot; This is the direct means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> and is supremely good to you. Act in accordance with this.&rdquo; - instead of saying so, he says:-&ldquo;Do whatever you wish to do,&rdquo; as if He were indifferent (and not interested in Arjuna&rsquo;s spiritual welfare) like one who tells a traveller, &quot; This route leads to the land of the Vidarbhas and this other to the land of the Kosalas. (Take whichever you choose)&rdquo;. <em>Śrī</em> Kṛṣṇa makes others think that this is the cause of Arjuna&rsquo;s mental depression and enjoys the līlā of instructing him once again in the principal means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em>  viz., <em>bhakti</em>  <em>yoga</em>. He begins by stating : &quot; I will teach you again this greatest secret of all &ldquo;, and in two _śloka_s explains to him, conclusively and with deep earnestness, what it is, so that he may remember that it is just what has already been taught. On seeing that Arjuna&rsquo;s depression has become twice as great as before, the Supreme Ruler, who is (now) the Charioteer, feels that Arjuna is now in a state of fitness to receive instruction in regard to the means of attaining <em>mokṣa</em> (viz. <em>prapatti</em>) which is the supreme secret and is, at the same time, extremely easy of adoption. Without the least delay, even without prefacing that <em>upāya</em> with any praise, the Lord immediately teaches him to perform <em>śaraṇāgati</em> towards Himself. Thus acting as the Charioteer also to the chariot of Arjuna&rsquo;s mind, (i.e. to all his aspirations), the Lord dispels all his griefs. That the grief which is here put an end to is therefore different from the old grief (concerning the destruction of his relatives etc.) thus becomes clear after a careful consideration of the context (in which the words occur).</p>
<p>In the first half of this <em>śloka</em>, since (the Lord) says to the man who is destitute of all other _upāya_s, &ldquo;Take refuge under me alone,&rdquo; the man who is incapable (of making any endeavour) surrenders the responsibility of his protection) into the hands of One who has the ability. Further the independent and omnipotent <em>śeṣī</em>, who is compassionate, accepts the responsibility. Therefore (in the first half of the <em>śloka</em>), the <em>prapanna</em> becomes free from all responsibility in regard to his own protection. And since the <em>śeṣī</em>, who is omnipotent and is ever truthful towards those who have sought His protection, has accepted the responsibility and is so gracious as to say .-&ldquo;I will release you from all sins&rdquo;, there is absolutely no likelihood of any evils like hell ensuing in the future. Freedom from fear results from this <em>śloka</em>, as also freedom from all doubt, , because these are the glorious and true words of <em>Śrī</em> *<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Raṅganātha Himself, who is ever truthful.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one has been told about this special <em>upāya</em> and if one adopts it, one will have no grief or despair, at all, in connection with that <em>upāya</em>.</p>
<p>Here it may be asked :&ndash; From the words “Do not grieve&rdquo;, it is evident that grief ( at one&rsquo;s being without _upāya_s) makes one competent for <em>prapatti</em>; how then could it be stated that fear is also one of the marks of competency for <em>prapatti</em>, as shown in the following <em>śloka</em> :-&ldquo;I dread, O, best of gods, at the sight of this <em>samsāra</em> which fills me with fear, Save me, O Lord of the lotus eyes. I know of no other <em>upāya</em> than Thee &ldquo;, and in the Tamil verse:-“ Embrace this red-hot iron pillar, O, sinner&rdquo;; in dread at these words, I have come and sought Thy feet for protection.” To this question the answer is as follows:- Having realised that the end desired by him has not been so far attained, the man grieves; he is also afraid at the prospect, in future, of formidable obstacles to the end desired by him. Therefore ( he has both grief and fear) In the case of the aspirant to <em>mukti</em>, when either of the two viz., the annulment of what is undesirable and the attainment of what is desired is mentioned, the other also comes (to the mind). In the same way when either of the two marks of competency for <em>prapatti</em>, viz., grief and fear, is mentioned, the other is also taken for granted. In the man who is absolutely without _upāya_s (and is therefore fit for performing <em>prapatti</em>), these two, grief and fear, are excessive. Therefore by way of conclusion, this adhikārī who is overwhelmed with excessive grief is taught the <em>upāya</em> which is appropriate for him, and is thereby made free of all doubt, free from all responsibility (concerning his protection), free from all fear and thus delighted at heart. On this extreme fear, we have already stated as follows :- &quot; The Lord has ???? - the Lord who said: - “ Thou that art afraid of <em>samsāra</em>, come and seek protection from me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <em>prapanna</em> who has done what he ought to do (i.e) <em>prapatti</em>, should (continue to) perform the rites and duties (ordained for his <em>varṇa</em> and <em>āśrama</em>) (<em>nitya</em> and <em>naimittika</em>), which are among the _kaiṅkarya_s done by the virtuous : such <em>karma</em>  as is described in the following <em>śloka</em> - &quot; Do that <em>karma</em> which, when performed, does not yield any fruit and which, when omitted, will bring in evil.” This is evident from the passages which are found before and after this <em>śloka</em> and also in this very <em>śloka</em>, where it is said that the omission will cause evil. Therefore since the <em>prapanna</em> has no uncertainty concerning the attainment of the desired end, since he has nothing further to do for the sake of <em>mokṣa</em>, since what he has yet to perform is only the keeping of (the Lord&rsquo;s) commands for their own sake, and since, if offences should be committed (thereafter), they could easily be atoned for by repentance and the like as pointed out in another chapter &ndash; there is no reason why he should not feel delighted at heart. Though this delight is mingled with disgust (nirveda) in the intelligent (<em>prapanna</em>) who is still connected with such unwholesome things as the body, yet the two may exist without any inconsistency as the disgust and the delight are due to different factors respectively.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo; are, themselves, an indication of the cancellation of all causes of grief; even that portion of the <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate (prarabdha) and which will cause grief will be cancelled and the man who is so impatient as not to be capable of existing even for a moment longer will attain <em>mokṣa</em>  at that very instant. As stated in the Tamil verse : &ldquo;The Lord is one who, to those that seek His protection, grants <em>Vaikuṇṭha</em> at the time of their death”, we have to believe that all that unexpired part of the <em>karma</em>  which has already begun to operate (prārabdha) will be annulled and that _mokṣa _ will be at the death of this body. Therefore if, in this bodily existence itself, it be felt (by a man) that what remains of this life is an evil, it will also certainly be cancelled by the will of the omnipotent Lord whose grace has been secured by <em>prapatti</em>.</p>
<p>(In this connection it may be asked whether it is not a sin to desire to die immediately after performing <em>prapatti</em>). The answer is as follows:-)</p>

</details>
<p>In some forms of expiation for sins (prayaschitta) and like. wise, in certain kinds of offering (made in the fire) like <em>sarvasvāra karma</em> , it is not considered a sin if the man gives up life (by casting the body down a precipice or in the fire), So also there is no impropriety in praying for instant death in the <em>śaraṇāgati</em> of the <em>prapanna</em> who cannot bear to continue in <em>samsāra</em> even for a moment (ārta). On the other hand, the <em>prapanna</em> who desires to live a long life (dripta) commits an offence, if he violates the rule in the _śāstra_s which enjoins the protection of one&rsquo;s own life.</p>
<p>In the same way as yogis cast off their bodies in virtue of certain yogas practised by them, there is nothing to prevent the man who, while performing <em>prapatti</em>, longs to die immediately. It cannot be said that such casting off of the body is not permitted to those who are in Kali yuga, like entrance into holy waters for giving up one&rsquo;s life there. In fact the <em>ārtaprapanna</em> who prays for immediate death is one who saves his self sooner than all others.</p>
<p>Prapannas are spoken of as belonging to two classes ārtas and driptas on account of the difference in the intensity of the grief felt by them respectively, (It should not, therefore, be thought that the latter viz., the dripta has no grief. The <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> is one who grieves at the thought of another janma and believes that he will some day or other attain <em>mokṣa</em> and has the patience to wait until the end of this existence. The word dripta is here used not in (the usual) sense of one who has arrogance or pride, which is a quality opposed to the virtues of the soul and leads one to treat good men with disesteem. The word _ārtaprapanna _is used here to denote the man who, in this life, looks upon even <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;s position of lordship as an obstacle to the perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em>, who feels that his present association with the body is unbearable as with a raging fire, and who, therefore, cannot endure existence even for a single moment after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>. He is, therefore, like one who prays, &quot; Be pleased  to make my body and my life-breath perish.&rdquo; He is not the ārta referred to in the Gitā (7.16) &ldquo;<em>ārto, jijñāsuh, arthārthī,</em> etc.,&rdquo; where ārta means &ldquo;one who prays for the recovery of his lost wealth or lordship &quot;</p>
<p>There are some who are of opinion that, in <em>Śrī</em> Rāma’s words:. &quot; Whether the man is an ārta (who cannot bear delay in the attainment of the desired end) or a dṛpta ( who has no such impatience), the man who seeks refuge should (always ) be protected&rdquo;, there is <em>ativāda</em> or exaggeration in that even the dripta who is proud or arrogant is stated to be worthy of protection. Whatever that may be, there is no room for dispute in regard to this passage where <em>mokṣa</em>  is promised to the man who grieves for the evils of <em>samsāra</em> but can bear to live till the end of this life and then attain <em>mokṣa</em>, for he is not one who is proud or arrogant.</p>
<p>The use of the future tense in _mokṣa_yishyāmi (I will release you) is not inappropriate in the case of the ārta who prays for immediate release from the body, for the end desired is to come after the adoption of the <em>upāya</em> and the word is used at the time when the <em>upāya</em> is taught (i.e. before the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>),</p>
<p>• These classifications into ārtas and driptas arise on account of differences in the intensity of the Lord&rsquo;s grace which are due to the differences in the good deeds performed by them before.</p>
<p>Such statements as are made in the _śloka_s &ndash; &quot; The man who has performed <em>prapatti</em> after learning the truth experiences, in this life, the consequences of his prārabdha <em>karma</em>  alone (i.e.) that <em>karma</em>  which has begun to yield its fruit in this life, and there after attains <em>mokṣa</em>&quot; - such statements do not apply to the ārta. (<em>Śrī</em> <em>Rāmānuja</em>) has described what the <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> should do after the performance of <em>prapatti</em>, in his <em>Gadya</em>, in the passages beginning with:-“ You will be free from all trace of suffering or hindrance caused by the body, the elements (earth, water, fire, etc.,) or the gods &ldquo;and ending with &ldquo;Be free from all uncertainty in regard to knowledge concerning me and the vision and the attainment  of myself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The freedom from grief that is stated here (in the <em>carama</em> <em>śloka</em>) has no limiting factors. Therefore the causes of all forms of grief are stated here to be annulled for the man who has a knowledge of this <em>upāya</em> and adopts it. By the teaching given here, mere knowledge (of the <em>upāya</em>) may exist without its adoption, but it would be of no use at all as stated in the <em>śloka</em>. &ldquo;The song does not regulate (the actions of) the man though he may sing it very often. Creatures behave in accordance with their past impressions (vāsana) like the bird <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> *Kulinga&rsquo;, which, though it utters the words <em>mā sāhasam kuru</em>, (Do not behave rashly), continues to behave rashly&rdquo;. So in this <em>śloka</em>, it is implied that annulment of grief would be the fruit of a combination of both knowledge and action.</p>
<p>Therefore, here, all grief or despair that might arise in regard to the adoption of the <em>upāya</em>, whether before its adoption or after it, or in the middle of it - all this grief is here (said to be) annulled,</p>
<p>If it be asked how, the answer is as follows; Despair may arise in many forms ;- (1) in regard to one&rsquo;s competency for the <em>upāya</em>, (2) in regard to (the potency of) the <em>upāya</em> itself, (3) in regard to the things that the <em>prapanna</em> should do after <em>prapatti</em>, and so also (4) in regard to the end to be attained including the full and perfect service or <em>kaiṅkarya</em> to be rendered. (1) Among them, this <em>dharma</em> called <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, which is to be adopted, is not confined to any particular family (<em>jāti</em>) caste or āśrama. Provided there are the desire for attaining the end in view and faith in the <em>upāya</em> which is the means for that attainment and such things as knowledge of one&rsquo;s being destitute (of other _upāya_s), there is no reason why any one should despair at the thought that he may not be competent (to adopt the <em>upāya</em>).</p>
<p>(2) The <em>(sādhya) upāya (prapatti)</em> is capable of being performed or adopted in a single instant with all its accessories, it is easy of performance; it does not need to be repeated; it does not take long to bear fruit; its accessories are not difficult; it is capable of yielding the desired fruit just at the time when it is desired; therefore to the man who is destitute (of other _upāya_s ) and who is afraid of delay (in attaining the desired end), there is no reason for despair at all thinking that he may have to adopt other _upāya_s like <em>bhakti</em> , which have to be practised for a long time with all accessories thereof, which are difficult of performance even to those who are very careful and whose accessories are also equally difficult to accomplish and which yield the desired fruit only after a long time,</p>
<p>The Saviour who is propitiated by this easier <em>upāya</em> and who is to grant the desired end is easily accessible to all, inspires confidence, is supremely compassionate and is independent and omnipotent without subjection to any one else). Therefore there is no reason why one should despair at the thought of the <em>Siddhopāya</em> (the Lord).</p>
<p>(3) After the performance of this <em>upāya</em>, none of the good deeds that may be done by a man either by say of keeping the commands (of the Lord) or winning His approval is an auxiliary or <em>aṅga</em> for <em>prapatti</em>. Therefore even if, owing to adverse circumstances of place and time, !here are shortcomings in their performance, there is no reason for grief or despair at the thought that these shortcomings might adversely affect the accessories (for they are not its accessories ).</p>
<p>If, in dread of certain sins due to prārabdha <em>karma</em>  which render a man absolutely unfit for all <em>karma</em>  like a piece of burnt cloth, by causing a man to offend the great devotees (of God) deliberately, if, in such cases, the man desires at the time of the first <em>prapatti</em> that his actions after <em>prapatti</em> should be free from all such offence or if he performs a later <em>prapatti</em> for avoiding these offences - if he does these, there is no reason for grief.or sorrow at the thought that offences may happen to be committed in future. Even if, at the time of the first <em>prapatti</em>, one has not prayed for a later life free of all offence, in case offences are committed deliberately, the Saviour of those that have no (other) refuge who stated, &ldquo;I will never forsake the man who comes to me in the guise of a friend&rdquo; will create repentance in his mind, and induce him to perform expiation or prayaschitta which (in this case) is a further <em>prapatti</em>. If the man is too stubborn to feel repentant, (the Lord) will cause sufferings by way of punishment and thus prevent him from committing further offences. Thus before the time when the attainment of the desired end is prayed for the expiation will be over, Therefore the <em>prapanna</em> need not feel grieved at the thought that great sufferings like those of hell would come to him as a result of deliberate offences committed by him which flash like lightning and disappear quickly.</p>
<p>(4) Since the <em>ārtaprapanna</em> will have the desired end at the very time of performning <em>prapatti</em>, there is no reason why he should feel grieved at the thought thar the body which resembles hell would continue, (for the body has been thus described):- &quot; If a man is fond of his body constituted of flesh, blood, pus, foecal matter, urine, muscle, fat and bone &ndash; then he should be fond also</p>
<p>of hell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As for the <em>dṛptaprapanna</em> :</p>
<p>All rites or _dharma_s of renunciation such as <em>karma</em> <em>yoga</em> will never be in vain as stated in the <em>śloka</em> :&ndash; &ldquo;The beginning that has been made in this <em>karma</em> -<em>yoga</em> will never prove futile. There is no harm in its being left incomplete; even a fraction of it saves a man from the great fear of <em>samsāra</em>&rdquo; &quot; The foundation that is laid is, as it were, a foundation of stone and especially with regard to the man who has performed <em>śaraṇāgati</em>, it has been stated: &ldquo;I will never forsake him. Further the dripta <em>prapanna</em> is certain of attaining what he desired, though it is delayed until the time specified by him. So the dripta <em>prapanna</em> has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that the good deed in the form of <em>prapatti</em> might be counteracted by certain evil deeds which might be thought capable of doing so, as has been said in the <em>śloka</em> “ A yajna &ldquo;&ldquo;performed by one loses its effect by untruthfulness, tapas perishes by arrogance, age becomes diminished by contemptuous talk of Brahmins and gifts of charity lose their virtue by their revelation.” since he has prayed for <em>mokṣa</em> at the end of this life, he has no reason to feel grieved at the thought that, owing to certain prarabdha <em>karma</em>  ( which has begun to yield its fruit), he might have to take another birth.</p>
<p>Since he is a <em>prapanna</em> for no other object (than <em>mokṣa</em>). all his sins which might act as obstacles will be absolved; therefore he hus no reason to grieve that the supreme end desired by him would suffer delay owing to such hindrances as the enjoyment of his mere disembodied self.</p>
<p>The Lord intends to say :- “You have become the recipient of my grace which can cancel the causes of all forms of grief. So if, hereafter, you should entertain grief or despair, it would be as foolish as when you had no grief or despair before performing <em>prapatti</em>, while being subject to punishment by me. This grief or despair is not in keeping with the peculiar potency of this <em>upāya</em>,</p>
<p>with my glory as <em>Siddhopāya</em> who has accepted the responsibility of protecting you and with your state as one who has done what he ought to do by the surrender of all responsibilities to me.&rdquo; In their last moments_ācārya_s teach their good disciples the purport given above of this last sentence,<em>’ mā śucah</em>’ &ldquo;Do not grieve&rdquo;, which is the quintessence of the <em>carama</em>-<em>śloka</em> (the last <em>śloka</em> ),</p>
<p>Among the words of this <em>śloka</em> (<em>caramaśloka</em>) are expressed explicitly by the words themselves or suggested implicitly by their meaning, the following ideas concerning this <em>upāya</em> :(1) the person who is competent for it, the preliminary condition of being destitute (of all other _upāya_s), the needlessness, for it, of any auxiliary rites which are too difficult to perform, the inappropriateness of trying to perform actions which are beyond one&rsquo;s power, the futility of obstinately attempting to do what is impossible (for one) this <em>upāya</em> being such as will not tolerate (the adoption of any other <em>upāya</em>); (2) the Saviour who alone can be of use to the aspirant for <em>mukti</em>, the Saviour&rsquo;s being perfect and full in such qualities as accessibility and good nature; the Saviour being the teacher of what is most salutary (<em>hita</em>); the end of attainment (viz, the Lord) being Himself the means of attainment; His being capable of acting in all matters without being hindered (by any one) and without the aid of any one else ; His expecting a mere pretext (or <em>vyāja</em>) for protecting (one): His not requiring the intervention of any other <em>upāya</em>: His being capable of being propitiated without any other auxiliary rites: His being the Saviour who can grant whatever fruit is desired; His intolerance of the acceptance of any other protector; His being ever in the company of <em>Śrī</em> (or <em>Lakṣmī</em>); His capacity for being placed in the position of other _upāya_s; His readiness to accept the responsibility or burden (of protecting one); (3) the <em>Sādhyopāya</em> which is of the nature of the surrender of responsibility; its ancillaries; its being within the competency of every one; its requiring to be perforined only once; its being easy of performance; its capacity to bear fruit without delay its being potent enough to annul prarabdhakarma ; (4) the man who performs <em>prapatti</em> being a doer or agent subject to the Supreme Self; his being subject to the authority of the s&rsquo;astras; (5) The Saviour&rsquo;s supreme compassion; His being ever gracious; His independence and freedom from subservience to any one else ; His being irresistible; His not requiring any other aid, His waiting for a pretext (to protect the <em>jīva</em>); (6) the <em>prapanna</em> being one who has done what he onght to do; the absence, on his part, of any need to do anything else (than <em>prapatti</em>) in regard to the <em>upāya</em> adopted by him or the fruit expected from it; his being extremely dear to <em>Bhagavān</em>; (7) the many obstacles ( to <em>mukti</em>) past, present and future; and the varied nature of the different groups of obstacles, their being capable of annulment by the mere will of <em>Iśvara</em>, the time of this annulment being dependent on the will of the <em>prapanna</em>: the nature of the annulment of these obstacles; (8) the manifestation of one&rsquo;s real and essential nature (<em>svarūpa</em>), which is different from the mere enjoyment of one&rsquo;s dis-embodied self : the full and perfect enjoyment of <em>Bhagavān</em> ; service of all kinds; freedom from coming back (to <em>samsāra</em>); (9) the manifold causes of grief or despair before (the performance of <em>prapatti</em>), the freedom from such grief or despair after (its performance); freedom from all uncertainty, at all times of reflection; freedom from grief, freedom from fear, a peculiar delight, biding the time when the body will perish and the delight in the performance of service free froin offence; these are the principal ideas (suggested) along with other things required for them.</p>
<p>A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF THE</p>
<p><em>CARAMA</em> <em>ŚLOKA</em>:&ndash;  page622</p>
<p>*This is the sum and substance of the meaning of the <em>śloka</em> :</p>
<p>&quot; Your knowledge is limited; your ability is insignificant; your life is short and you are also impatient of delay. Therefore do not go about seeking other _upāya_s which you cannot (fully) understand, which you cannot easily adopt and which can bear fruit only after much delay. Realise that I who am easy of access to all, who am the Saviour of all the worlds, and who am endowed with all the attributes essential for a Saviour, am the only <em>upāya</em> and perform the surrender of the responsibility of protecting your self to me with its five aṅgas. When you have adopted this <em>upāya</em>, you will have done what you ought to do, you will become my ward and be extremely dear to me. Supremely compassionate and gracious, independent and omnipotent, I will, myself, by my mere will and without any other aid, and for the fulfilment of iny own purposes, free you from the manifold, endless, and insurmountable groups of obstacles without leaving any trace of them. I will enable you to have enjoyments similar to mine own, since you will enjoy myself and all that belongs to me. I will find delight in making you render all forms of service in all places, at all times and in all circumstances — service which will be of the nature of the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment (of myself). You have absolutely no cause for grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are some (acharyas) who have understood the noble and charming <em>śloka</em> uttered by Hari which is like the gem koustubha taken out of the ocean of Vyasa&rsquo;s Veda (<em>Mahābhārata</em>). Its meaning finds confirmation in the ways of the world (or the _smṛti_s) and in the paths of the Vedas. On hearing the words of these (ācharyas) which are like steps in the staircase that leads to the mansion of <em>mukti</em>, great souls like Vaiśampāyana and Śounaka nod their heads (in approval and admiration).</p>
