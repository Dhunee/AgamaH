(22) THE CHAPTER ON THE FULL AND PERFECT



ENJOYMENT OF THE BLISS OF _BRAHMAN_. page274



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

वितमसि पदे लक्ष्मीकान्तं विचित्रविभूतिकं

सचिवगमितस्संपद्याविर्भवत्सहजाकृतिः ।

स्फुटतदपृथक्सिद्धिस्सिद्ध्यद्गुणाष्टकतत्फलो

भजति परमं साम्यं भोगे निवृत्तिकथोज्झितम् ॥ ४८ ॥

Led by his guides (archis and others) to the Lord of Lakṣmī  who is possessed of varied glories in the region beyond tamas (i e.) _prakṛti_ and having attained Him, the _mukta_ has his essential nature in full manifestation and realises his inseparable connection with the Lord and as a consequence, acquires the *eight attributes (of freedom from sin and the like. See page _____) and without any question of his returning again (to _samsāra_ ), he attains, in regard to enjoyment, perfect resemblance to the Lord.



THE NATURE OF THE BLISS OF _BRAHMAN_ :



If it is asked what is this full and perfect enjoyment of _Brahman_ by the _mukta_ who has traversed the path (described before), the answer is as follows:- He will in all places, at all times, and in all situations, have, for his unsurpassed joys, the supreme Ruler with His countless forms, attributes, glories and activities without missing any of them. This is thus described (in the following verse):-- "She will never, in the least, miss (the sight of) _Bhagavān_ whose eyes are as beautiful as the lotus and who is the Lord of the world." (Since the Lord enjoys His own forms, attributes, glories and activities Himself), there is perfect similarity between the _mukta_'s enjoyment and the Lord's. Therefore (the _śruti_ s) speak of perfect similarity.



The Lord's _svarūpa_ is delightful as may be seen from the following passages. "He is all knowledge and all bliss". "The attainment of _Bhagavān_ is a remedy for the disease of (_samsāra_). It is of the nature of joy which is unsurpassed and confers joy on others. It is an end in itself and lasts forever". Other things are enjoyable in this way: If the king is the queen's joy, then all objects and instruments of his enjoyment as well as the places where he finds delight are alike, objects of joy to her. Similarly the _mukta_ finds joy in all that pertains to the Lord. That the Supreme Ruler who has all forms, attributes and the like is an object of enjoyment is evident from the _śruti_ s and the _smṛti_s. This idea has been expressed in the section on Bhima in the _Brahma_ _Sūtra_s. The _svarūpa_ of _Bhagavān_ is called Paramapada, because it is the ultimate and supreme object of attainment being of unsurpassed agreeableness. Since the perfect enjoyment of the _svarūpa_ of _Bhagavān_ happens only after reaching a most delightful region far superior to all others, that region is also called Paramapada. The essential nature or _svarūpa_ of the _Jīva_, which is the recipient of this joy in the attainment of _Bhagavān_ which is also among the glorious possessions (Vibhūtis) of the Lord and which has, for its attributes, _jñāna_ and ānanda, is also (sometimes ) called Paramapada. Along with the others, these three have, in common, only the feature of being the object of attainment.



It has been said above that such things as _Bhagavān_'s _svarūpa_, attributes and forms, the region of eternal glory (_nitya_ vibhūti) which is constituted of pure _sattvam_ and his own suurüpa are objects of delight to the _mukta_. It may be asked, “This may be true. But by sense perception (pratyaksha) and other sources of knowledge, the objects in this world of lilā _vibhūti_ are found to be disagreeable and are declared by the _śāstra_s also to be things to be given up, How then could they viz. the objects in _līlā_ vibhūti be objects of delight to the _mukta_ ?" The answer is as follows:--  There is nothing inconceivable in this. What appears disagreeable to the man suffering from (excess of) bile is felt as agreeable when the bile has decreased. Again when the prince is in the prison house it is disagreeable. But when the emperor is pleased to set him free and to place him by his own side to enjoy like- pleasures, the prison house may appear agreeable as a symbol of his father's glory, although it has not undergone any change. It is said in the Rāmāyana : --" To be with you is _mokṣa_ for me; to be without you is hell to me;" again, "To me living without ŚrīRāma, the great warrior, in the midst of these Rākṣasis, of what use is life, or wealth, or ornaments?" In Tiruvoymozi 4-8 it is said :-"As the Lord does not care for me, it would not at all matter if I lost all that I would otherwise prize highly, viz., my beauty, my mind, my modesty, the sheen of my complexion, my intelligence, my charm, my bracelets, my girdle, my body and my very life." As illustrated in the passages cited above, the objects of this world (_Līlā_ _Vibhūti_), which appear disagreeable or only slightly agreeable, when the _jīva_ is not blessed with union with the Lord, may appear supremely agreeable, when he has become a _mukta_ enjoying without intermission (the bliss of) _Bhagavān_. There is nothing inconsistent in this. The same object may be disagreeable or only slightly agreeable to a man bound to _samsāra_, while to one released from the bondage of _karma_, it is agreeable. This is the nature ordained for them by the will of God.



That _Bhagavān_, the Lord of _Śrī_, who has, for his _prakāra_ or mode, all things whose agreeableness is dependent on His will, is the goal of attainment is implicit in the words in the dative or fourth case (Nārāyaṇāya) in Tirumantra and in _Dvaya_. The service referred to before is the overflow of love born of the perfect enjoyment of _Brahman_ and the _Bhāṣya_kāra has explained it in several places in the (_Śaraṇāgati_ _Gadya_ ).



FULL AND PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF BHAGAVĀN



OVERFLOWS INTO _KAIÑKARYA_ OR SERVICE.



( It is said in the _śruti_s that the _mukta_ eats whatever he wants and can create whichever relations he wants). The enjoyment of food in the state of _mukti_ and the contact with relations and the like are not due to _karma_, whether puṇya or papa, but are dependent only on the will of the _mukta_ which is (always ) in accordance with the will of _Bhagavān_. Therefore they are not the consequences or fruits of _karma_, but fall into the category of pure service which is the overflow of the perfect enjoyment of _Brahman_. Thus the ultimate goal of attainment is the full and perfect enjoyment of _Brahman_ which extends also to those services that are desired by the _mukta_. When this experience has once been attained, it never afterwards ceases and this my be seen from the following passages :

“The place from which the man who has meditated on _Brahman_ never returns- that place is attained by him (the _prapanna_)"; again, “Those great souls who have attained the highest reach me and are never afterwards born in _samsāra_, which is the abode of suffering and is ever-ch_aṅgī_ng. All the worlds including that of _Brahma_ are places, O Arjuna, from which souls return to _samsāra_. But the soul that has attained me, is, O Son of Kunti, never born again.", and further "When the man who has become dissociated from all contact with _prakṛti_ has seen _Brahman_ who is the 26th real, he will never be born again, because he has attained all that has to be attained.", and also "The heavenly bodies like the moon and the sun (the presiding deities that govern them) are born again in _samsāra_ (after reaching their high positions). But those who meditate on _Bhagavān_ with the _mantra_[^60] * of twelve syllables never come back to _samsāra_.

[^60]:
Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya: with Om (or _aum_) preceding it.


(The same idea is evident also) in: "If a man utters the words Namo Nārāyaṇa with hands folded over the head (i.e. performs _prapatti_) and then goes (by the shining path), he will not be allowed to return to the world of _samsāra_, even if he furnishes security for his return to _Vaikuṇṭha_ " and in other passages like this.(end of page 218)

Even if they come to _Līlā_-_vibhūti_ (this world of ours) by their own will and pleasure which are of the form of service to the Lord, there will be no diminution of their enjoyment of _Brahman_ and in this sense there will be no return to _samsāra_.

As regards these souls that attain this endless enjoyment of _Brahman_, it is not possible to say whether their last body is that of a deva, a man or other creatures. Even such beings as _Brahma_ have to attain _mokṣa_. So also the great sages say : -- “Even such others as the virtuous hunter who follow gruesome professions attain the goal owing to their practice of _bhakti_ _yoga_ in their previous birth, as may be seen from the instance of Sramani”

THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF BLISS AMONG THE MUKTAS:

The followers of Anandatirtha take into account the superiority or inferiority of _jīva_s in the state of the quest for _mukti_ and maintain that, in accordance with these degrees of merit or demerit (while in the state of seeking _mukti_), there would be differences in enjoyment even after they have attained _mukti_. They have forgotten the passages in such authorities as the _śruti_ which speak of perfect equality with the Supreme Being in regard to enjoyment (after release from bondage).

Some hold that, in accordance with defects in the observance of the prescribed code of conduct by the seeker after _mukti_, there would be diminution in the bliss enjoyed. Even admitting that their words deserve serious consideration as those of trust worthy authorities, they mean only this much that, in the enjoyment of _Bhagavān_ which occurs before _mukti_, there would be degrees of joy. It is true that there may be delay or no delay in attaining release from bondage, but after release is (once) attained, there is no difference at all in the enjoyment of bliss (between muktas and muktas).

Some _jīva_s attain, ia such worlds as those of Viṣṇu , the privilege of living in the same world as Viṣṇu  (sālokya ), some _jīva_s attain proximity to the presence of Viṣṇu  (sāmipya ); some attain forms similar to that of Viṣṇu  (sārūpya): these, too, are sometimes called muktas by courtesy (upacāra), since they are very near the ultimate goal (but they are not really muktas in the true sense of the word). This idea is set forth in the following _śloka_  - "Some live in the worlds of Viṣṇu ; others approach very near to Viṣṇu ; others, again, acquire forms resembling _Viṣṇu_'s; yet others attain sayujya with Viṣṇu . This, alone, is called _mokṣa_ ." This _śloka_  declares that only sāyujya in Paramapada is _mokṣa_ . In the same way as a hundred and the like are included within a thousand, sālokya and the like are included within sāyujya. The truth of this statement may be seen in the following _śloka_  : "I do not at all"A beg for _mokṣa_  which goes by the names of sālokya and sarūpya. I long, O Lord that hast taken a vow (to protect those that seek Thy help) - I long, O Thou with long arms, for sãyujya with Tbee." Sayujya means the relationship between two who are united in communion (sayuk). One might be sayuk with another, although only in the common enjoyment of a certain pleasure. Here in regard to the _mukta_, the object of enjoyment is _Brahman_ with His prakāras or modes. Since _Brahman_ and the _mukta_ both commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss, the _mukta_ is called sayuk (with _Brahman_).



In this connection, it may be asked why, in one of the passages of the Veda, the two words, sayujya and sārshtitha are employed (in the same sentence ), when they mean the same thing, namely, communion in the enjoyment (would it not be redundant to use two words when one would be enough?). The answer is (that there is a difference in meaning between the two words ), and it is as follows:



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_:

सायुज्यमुभयोरत्र भोक्तव्यस्याविशिष्टता ।

सार्ष्टिता तत्र भोगस्य तारतम्यविहीनता ॥

Sayujyam between the two (_Brahman_ and the _mukta_) means that there is no difference so far as the objects of enjoyment are concerned : sārshtita (between the two) means that there is no difference in the degree or intensity of their enjoyment. (Two men may have before them the same object of enjoyment and yet one of them may enjoy it more intensely than the other).



It is true that the _mukta_ has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying and such other things in regard to the world (Jagad Vyāpāra). But just as the father who cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruit from the cultivated field, _Iśvara_ who is engaged in the work of the world (Jagad Vyāpāra ) and the _mukta_ who only witnesses it have the same degree of enjoyment in the joy arising from that work. The author of the _Brahma_ Sūtras has stated at the beginning of the section : "(The '_mukta_'s enjoyment is ) exclusive of the work of the world" and concludes it by saying:" The resemblance or equality (sāmyam) between the _mukta_ and _Brahman_ is only so far as the enjoyment is concerned, as stated in the _śruti_ s, and also by inference linga". Sakatayana has also stated as follows:- Those who meditate on _Brahman_ say that sāyujyam consists in the sameness or equality of enjoyment".



REFUTATION OF THE ADVAITIC DOCTRINE OF



IDENTITY:



To those (viz. Advaitins) who maintain that the word Sayujyam, means oneness or identity with _Brahman_ (aikyam), the derivative or etymological meaning of the word, sãyujyam, is at variance, as also the texts in the _śruti_ [ Such śrutis as the following:-_Brahman_ is the eternal among eternals, the sentient among sentients. (1) He is one and satisfies the desires of the many: Svetasvatara Upaniṣad. 2) Without any blemish or stain he attains perfect resemblance (paramam samyam).]  which declare that _Brahman_ is different from the _jīva_s. Besides, their view is opposed also to the _śruti_s which declare that the _mukta_ will attain perfect resemblance (sāmyam) to _Brahman_ and that the _mukta_ will be like _Brahman_. The author of the Gita has conveyed the same idea in :- "They will attain my likeness (sādharmyam)":



The Maharshi (Vyāsa) has also expressed this idea at great length in the discourse between Vasiṣṭa and Karala and concludes by saying that this is the supreme truth - "The _jīva_ released from bondage (i.e.) the _mukta_, attains the Supreme Being and acquires attributes similar to those of the Supreme Being. He too becomes free from all imperfections when he reaches Him. Having attained the Omniscient _Brahman_, he, too, becomes omniscient. Having reached Him who is free from the bondage of _karma_, he, too, becomes free from _karma_. Having attained _Bhagavān_ who is free from suffering and sorrow, he, too, becomes free from them. Having reached Him who is blissful, he, too, becomes blissful. O best of Bharatas, having attained _Bhagavān_ who acts by His will alone (without being influenced by _karma_), he, too, acts merely by his will. He becomes resplendent and having attained _Bhagavān_ who is without the qualities (of _prakṛti_) he, too, is without those qualities. Having reached _Brahman_ who is without the body and the senses constituted of matter (_Prakṛti_), he, too, becomes free from them. Having attained the Supreme Being who is independent of _karma_, he too, becomes independent. I have thus described the truth to you, O great king, just as it is in reality. Having accepted this teaching with a mind free from discontent (asuya), meditate on _Brahman_ who is eternal and free from all imperfections and who is the (ultimate) cause of the world".



In the passage cited above, the _mukta_ is called 'independent' (svatantra ), because he is free from the influence of past _karma_. The _Bhāṣya_kāra (Śrī _Rāmānuja_) has explained the meaning of the word Svarat (literally the independent king) as being not subject to _karma_'.



Thus since in the śrutis, the _smṛti_s and the sūtras, resemblance between the _mukta_ and _Brahman_ (sāmyam) is explicitly stated, those places in the texts which seem to speak of identity (aikyam) between the _mukta_ and _Brahman_ in the state of release from bondage have to be explained in a manner that would not be inconsistent with the _śruti_ s which declare difference between the _jīva_ and _Brahman_. The word aikyam or (identity ) in such passages should be construed in the same manner as in the _śloka_  : "The aikyam between Rama and Sugrīva arose O, Lady, in this way.” (Here aikyam means friendship, identity not of self's but of interests).



If it were not construed in this way, it would be in conflict with thousands of authoritative passages like the following:--



(1) “When the person who is twice-born (dvija) sees that he is different from the Supreme Being and that the Supreme Being is different from himself, he becomes free from bondage and will see for ever (_Bhagavān_ who is) the 26th real. The Supreme Being is one and the _jīva_-- who is the 25th real - is another. Since the Supreme Being is within him (the _jīva_), good men call them one. The Supreme Being, O, king, is different from the _jīva_, and the _jīva_, who is the 25th real, is different from the 24 reals. Therefore good men do not consider the _jīva_, who is the 25th real, as being identical with the Supreme Being. So in dread of birth and death, they perform, O Kasyapa, _karma_ _yoga_, acquire thereby purity of mind, and then perform _jñāna_ _yoga_, and then meditate on the Supreme Being as the supreme object of attainment.

(2) _Puruṣottama_ is different from both the _baddha_ and _mukta_. He is called the Supreme Being.

(3) He who is within the _jīva_ as his Inner Ruler -- He is eternal: He is free from the qualities of _prakṛti_: He should be known as Nārāyaṇa: He is the soul of all and is called Purusha by the Vedas. The consequences of past _karma_ do not cling to Him, in the same way as water does not cling to the leaf of the lotus. The _jīva_ who is inferior to the Supreme Being becomes subject to bondage owing to past _karma_ and attains _mokṣa_  by meditating on _Brahman_".

(4) "Just as fire in a ball of (red-hot) iron seems to be one with the iron, though it is really different from it, so the Supreme Being pervades the world and is inseparable from it".



Therefore the perfect resemblance of the _jīva_ (parama samyam) (to _Brahman_) is only that arising from _jñāna_ and bhoga (enjoyment) and the like. _Iśvara_ has, for His definition, the following attributes which are like the umbrella and the chamara (insignia of royalty):-- being the cause of the world, the conferring of _mokṣa_  on _jīva_s, being the support of the world, being the controller of the world, the one for whom all things and all sentient beings exist, the one who has everything for His body, the one who is denoted by all words, the one who can be understood from all the Vedas, the one who is the refuge of all the world, the one who should be adored by all those who want _mokṣa_ , the one who grants the fruits (of all actions), the one whose essential nature is omnipresence, _Jñāna_ and ānanda (bliss), the one who is the spouse of Laksh mi. These are peculiar to Him and are His distinctive features. The _mukta_'s distinctive attributes are the following : being sustained (by _Iśvara_); being controlled by Him, existing only for the Lord (_śeṣa_tva), being atomic (anu) and such others.



THE MUKTA WILL NEVER BE IN _SAMSĀRA_ AGAIN :



If it be so, it may be asked whether the _mukta_  who is not independent (of God) may not, for some reason or other, incur the possibility of a return to _samsāra_. The _jīva_'s dependence on Iswars has been stated in the _śloka_  :-“For enabling a man to get the good things of life, and for taking away from him the ills of life, there is no one other than _Puruṣottama_ who is competent ''. The answer to that question is, "There will be no such possibility, for has He not Himself declared :- "Those who perform _bhakti_ _yoga_ with great devotion and those who have performed _prapatti_ which is considered as a superior form of penance (tapas) will obtain sāyujya and will for ever render service to me. They will always be free from the ills of _samsāra_". Ever in the state of desire for _mukti_, the _mukta_ had an aversion to the enjoyment of non-sentient things (matter) and also to the mere enjoyment of his own self (kaivalya). This aversion is now well established in him; for as he sees all things having _Brahman_ as their inner self, there is no possibility of his enjoying his own self as separate (from everything else), and as he sees by constant perception (pratyaksha ) the imperfections of all other objects (than God), there is no possibility of his returning to _samsāra_ of his own free will. As his knowledge of the three _tattva_s, _cit_. _acit_ and _Iśvara_ and of what is good and what is evil, which he acquired before, has now attained expansion without any break or contraction, there is no possibility of his ever going back to _samsāra_ owing to a_jñāna_ or ignorance. The knowledge which formerly in _samsāra_ deepened into the form of love called _bhakti_ and which he acquired by his distinctive knowledge of the specific nature of _Bhagavān_ has, now, in the state of _mukti_, become ripened into the form of supreme love, because he has now a vision of all aspects of _Bhagavān_'s distinctive nature of which even the śāstra s are incapable. Therefore _Iśvara_'s great love for him as stated in the _śloka_ : "The jnanī is dear to me (How dear he is to me cannot be described even by me, Omniscient though I am)" - _Iśvara_'s love for himna is so overwhelming that its flow is irresistible and that its current reaches even those uplands which are connected with him only in distant relationship. Therefore it cannot be stated that, though he is free from _karma_, there is the possibility of his returning to _samsāra_ by the will of _Iśvara_ who is independent (and all-powerful). Since the _mukta_ is no longer subject to the injunctions of śāstra , there is no possibility of his violating the Lord's command in the state of _mukti_. He cannot do anything opposed to the will of _Iśvara_ as the Lord's pleasure is now his pleasure. Therefore the ultimate goal or attainment called _mokṣa_ , which is of the nature of perfect and full enjoyment of _Brahman_ and which extends into service, has now become eternal for him (i.e.) it will last as long as his soul lasts. Considering all this, the Sitra-kāra said: "There is no return (to _samsāra_) - no return, for the Scripture says so."

of Doctrine.



APPENDIX ( Chapter V Page 65 )



THE VISĀKHASTAMBHA AS DESCRIBED IN THE SATVATA SAMHITĀ AND



THE _LAKṣMĪ_  TANTRA.



In the region of eternal glory (_nitya_ _vibhūti_), there is a huge column constituted of _śuddhasattva_m. It is a special form in which _Bhagavān_ appears there. This column or pillar is called Visakha yoopa. The column consists of four parts called, respectively, jāgrat, (the waking state ), svapna (the dream ), _suṣupti_ (dreamless sleep) and turīya (the fourth stage, counting from below upwards). In the part called jāgratsthana, which is somewhere above the base of the column, there are four divine forms on the four sides called, respectively, _Vāsudeva_, _Saṅkarṣaṇa_, Pradyumna and Aniruddha facing the east, the south the west and the north and shining like branches around that part of the column. This collection of four forms is called Jāgratvyuha. The activity of this vynha is the creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. The four forms are bright in colours, white, red and the like. They have also arms or weapons. Above this part of the column is the part called svapnasthāna. Here, too, there are four divine forms _Vāsudeva_, Sankarshna, Pradyumna and Aniruddha shining like branches, as before, to the east, the south, the west and the north. This collection of four vyuhas in the second part of the column from below is called svapnavyuha. These four forms have no activities like creation and maintenance, but have only the will to do so. Their colours, too, are not so bright as those of the lower _vyūha_. They have weapons but no banners and other accessories. Above the svapnasthana, which is the second part from below, is the third part or sthāna called sushuptisthāna. Here too there are four divine forms with the same aan es as in the two other parts already described and in the same order. This collection of four forms is called sushuptivyuha. These forms have neither activities nor even the will or the desire to act. They have just the experience of their owa bliss and nothing else. In the form of _Vāsudeva_ which is like å branch of the column shooting on the eastern side, there is no such thing as a body with limbs and the like and it shines with all the six qualities. The other three forms, _Saṅkarṣaṇa_ and the like on the other three sides have a body with hands, feet and the like. But they have no weapons; on the palms they bear lines resembling the conch, and the weapons. These forms have no colours. The uppermost or fourth part of the column (Turīya sthāna) has also similar four forms with the same names as in the former parts. This collection of four is the Turīya vyūha. They have no bodies with limbs and the like but resemble the _Vāsudeva_ form of the _suṣupti_ _vyūha_. They have no activities, no will, no weapons and no lines on the palm resembling arms. All the six qualities shine in the form called _Vāsudeva_ and the other three have, each, only two of these qualities. The names jāgrat, svapna, _suṣupti_ and turīya are given to them on the analogy of these states in man in the ordinary world, according to the greater or the lesser activity found in each. The turīya state is like that in a swoon when even the breath is suspended, whereas in the _suṣupti_ state, the man just breathes in or breathes out; in the svapna, his external senses cease to act, only the mind is active, in the jāgrat state, both the mind and the external senses act.



These four parts with four vyūhas in each correspond to the four stages of development that may be found in the worshipper who meditates on them. On the lowest stage of meditation, there is no full control of the external senses and the mind; in the second stage of development, control of the external senses has been attained but not of the mind; in the next stage, the mind, too, has been controlled and the man who meditates is seen just breathing in and breathing out with no other activity or sign of life; in the last or perfect development of meditation, he is like one in a swoon, not even breathing in or out:

and Disputed Points
