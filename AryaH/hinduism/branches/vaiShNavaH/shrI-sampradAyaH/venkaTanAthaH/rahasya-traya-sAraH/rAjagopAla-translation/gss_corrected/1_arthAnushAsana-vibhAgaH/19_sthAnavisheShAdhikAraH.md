(19) THE CHAPTER ON THE PLACES SUITABLE

FOR THE RESIDENCE OF THE _PRAPANNA_. page249



SANSKRIT _ŚLOKA_ :

यत्रैकाग्र्यं भवति भगवत्पादसेवार्चनादेः

यत्रैकान्त्यव्यवसितधियो यस्य कस्यापि लाभः ।

वासस्थानं तदिह कृतिनां भाति वैकुण्ठकल्पं

प्रायो देशा मुनिभिरुदिताः प्रायिकौचित्यवन्तः ॥ ४२ ॥

The place where it is possible to concentrate all one's attention on such things as service at the feet of _Bhagavān_ and His adoration, or the place where one can find some one or other whose wind is exclusively and staunchly fixed on _Bhagavān_ - that is the place of abode for prapannās as it is almost equal to Vaikuṇṭha. Many places that have been prescribed (for abode ) by the sages generally have this fitness (in these two respects).



THE PLACE SUITED TO THE RESIDENCE OF



THE _PRAPANNA_:



As an end in itself, the _prapanna_ is desirous and eager to live, the rest of his life in a manner that would be inoffensive and agreeable to the Lord. He is exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord as described in the _śloka_  :-- The 'devotee who is exclusively attached to _Bhagavān_ is not to be described or designated as belonging to a certain village or a certain family, but as belonging to _Bhagavān_, for _Bhagavān_ alone is everything to him.



THE PLACES INHABITED BY BHAGAVATĀS ARE



THE MOST SUITABLE.



If it be asked what is the proper place for his residence, the answer is as follows:- Holy regions like Aryavarta have now, owing to the nature of the Yuga (Kali) become unfit for abode, owing to the rites of _varṇa_ and _āśrama_ getting mingled. Therefore the proper place for residence at present is any place where the practice of the _dharma_ of the four _varṇa_s is well established. Even among these places, those regions which are. inbabited by Bhāgavatas are to be chosen by (the _prapanna_) desirous of _mokṣa_ . It has been said :-"What austerities must they have practised (in their past lives) - they who live in places where there are devotees that adore, with folded hands, Śrī kṛṣṇa, who has a complexion similar to that of a black cloud, and that look upon Him as their protector ?" Though it is stated " In Kali, O, Maitreya, men deluded by heretics will not adore _Viṣṇu_, the Lord of the World, the Ruler who created all things", we are also told about places where Bhāgavatas live in Kali Yuga : " In Kali Yuga, there will be born, here and there, noble souls who consider that Nārāyaṇa  is the supreme object of attainment. They will be born in numbers in Tamil Nad on the banks of the Tamraparni, of the Kritamala, of the Palar, of the renowned Cauvery and of the river which flows westwards and again : "Those who drink the waters of these rivers, O, king, become pure ia mind and greatly devoted to _Bhagavān_ who is called _Vāsudeva_". As stated in these passages, it is these places inhabited by Bhagavatās, that are suitable for the residence of the _prapanna_ in this Kali Yuga. In Śrī Narayaniya the devas and the rishis said, "When _dharma_ stands on a single leg ready to go elsewhere, how are we to live, O Lord? Please tell us this”, _Bhagavān_ replied as follows: "You should live in places where _guru_s of good character and possessed of self-control are held in reverence and where _dharma_ has not undergone any deterioration. The places which should be chosen by you, O best of devotees, are those where flourish the Vedas, yajņas, austerities (tapas), truth, control of the senses and the slaughter of animals only for the sake of _dharma_ (sacrifices). A_dharma_ will not touch you with its foot".



THE HOLY PLACES WHERE BHAGAVĀN IS WORSHIPPED IN TEMPLES ARE



SPECIALLY SUITABLE:

Among them, the boly places where _Bhagavān_ has chosen to be present as archā would be proper for the prapannas' residence. He should live permanently in one among them which is suitable for his service to the Lord). As an example of holy places where sattva is predominant, _Śrī_r_aṅga_m is indicated in the following passage . "Until the 'fall of the body, live in peace here in _Śrī_r_aṅga_m itself." That only the holy places of _Bhagavān_ are suitable for the residence of the wise man has been stated by the great sage (Vyāsa) in the context of the places of pilgrimage in Āranya Parva, thus :- "The place where the Supreme Being, the God Nārāyaṇa  who is eternal, dwells -- that is sacred; that is most holy; that is the place of the sacred water that purifies; that is the place fit for austerities; that is the place where the divine seers and the siddhas and all others perform penance", and (in another context) elsewhere, we find -" There is a mountain called Gomanta, O, king, which is full of all the minerals. On that mountain dwells the lotus-eyed Lord Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of Lakṣmī , who is sung in hymns (there) by those who desire _mokṣa_ ." _Bhagavān_ Vālmīki also has stated :- “This mountain, Chitrakuta, which resembles Himavan, the king of mountains, is possessed of glory, for ŚrīRāma born of the race of Kakustha dwells on it like Kubera in Nandana." The word subhaga in this siloka refers to the glory of that mountain as one to be visited for having been the residence of _Bhagavān_. In the Sātvata śāstra s also, the holy places where there are the spontaneous manifestations of _Bhagavān_, those that were established by siddhās and those founded by devotees and the degrees of sanctity attached to them are described separately and it is also stated there that those who dwell within the boundaries of these holy places will attain a special boon at the time of their laying down the body :-"The wind" of man which is under the sway of the foul senses is always surrounded by impure influences. It is, however, purified in the last moments by residence in the abode of Nārāyaṇa ."Therefore as stated in the _śloka_  :-"A man should live in a place where there is a temple of Viṣṇu  and do some kind of service (there). If he is unable to perform any service, he should At least abstain from what is forbidden"; the _prapanna_ would do well to live in a place sanctified by the presence of _Bhagavān_ and Bhāgavatas and capable of promoting sattva _guṇa_.



It is true that it is said: “ The places where a man in full control of his senses lives — that place has in it Kurukṣetra, Naimisa and, likewise, Pushkaram." But this should be taken to mean that, when a righteous man lives in some insignificant place, because of his inability to live elsewhere, that place becomes sanctified by his residence. This is illustrated in the episode of Sandili.[ Sandili, a great devotee of the Lord, was living on an island in the sea. Garuḍa, who saw it, wondered why she should dwell in such a mean place. Owing to this offensive thought, his wings were burnt away and he recovered their use only after obtaining her pardon.]



Therefore the statement in the following _śloka_  :-- "The man " who performs _prapatti_ by uttering this _mantra_ at the very time when he attains this knowledge -- that man attains _mokṣa_  wherever he may die losing his consciousness whether it be in a holy place of pilgrimage or the house of one who eats dog's flesh" - this statement that there is no special place prescribed for death, should also be understood in the light of what has been said above, as pointing out that this will be no hindrance to the attainment of _mokṣa_ .

(2) The mountain which reveals to us the two feet of Śrīkṛṣṇa, the mountain where wicked sinners get rid of both their puiya and papa, the mountain which is renowned as being indeed _mokṣa_  itself, the mountain on which flow holy streams with pellucid walers, the mountain that is extolled as the abode of all righteous actions, the mountain that secures all the enjoyments of Paramapada (the region of dazzling gold), the mountain that is longed for by the eternal săiris and the people of this earth - that mountain is only the mountain described in the Vedas and famous as lhe Venkata Hills.

उत्तम वमर्त्तल ममैत्तदो रॆऴिऱ्‌ ऱनुवुनुयर्त्त कणैयाल्

अत्तिरवरक्कन् मुडिबत्तु मॊरुगॊत्तॆन वुदिर्त्त तिऱलोन्

मत्तुऱुमिगुत्त तयिर्मॊय्त्तवॆणॆय् वैत्तदुणुमत्तनिडमा

मत्तिगिरिबत्तर्विनै तॊत्तऱवऱुक्कुमणियत्तिगिरिये.

(3) Hastigiri (Kancheepuram ) where dwells ŚrīRama who, with his might and with his arrow discharged from his beautiful bow in the great battle-field, sh ook down the bunch of ten heads of the Rākṣasa who was powerful in the use of missiles and where dwells also Śrīkṛṣṇa, the great friend of man, who ate the rising batter kept by Yasoda, after churning the abundant curd into which the chura was pressed – this Hastigiri cuts off the sins of devotees leaving no trace of them behind. It does, of itself, the work of the Lord's chakra and lets the latter remain as a mere ornament to His hand :

तेनार् कमलत् तिरुमगणादन् ऱिगऴ्न्दुऱैयुम्

वानाडुगन्दवर् वैयत्तिरुप्पिडम् वण्ड्ररुमक्

कानारिमयमुङ् गङ्गैयुङ् गाविरियुङ् गडलुम्

नानानगरमु नागमुङ् गूडिय नन्निलमे. (26)





(4) That place on the earth where dwell (the devotees of the Lord), who long for the world above (Paramapada) which is the famous residence of Nārāyaṇa , the Lord of Lakṣmī , born of the lotus full of honey (pollen) - that place is as sacred as the Himalaya surrounded by forests, the G_aṅga_, the Cauvery, the sea, the holy cities (like Ayodhya, Mathura, Kasi and Kanchi) and ŚrīVaikanta all in one.



SANSKRIT VERSE:

सा काशीति न चाकशीति भुवि सायोद्ध्येति नाद्ध्यास्यते

सावन्तीति न कल्मषादवति सा काञ्चीति नोदञ्चति ।

धत्ते सा मधुरेति नोत्तमधुरां नान्यापि मान्या पुरी

या वैकुण्ठकथासुधारसभुजां रोचेत नो चेतसे ॥ ४३ ॥

The place which is not to the liking of the minds of those who taste the nectar of the stories of _Bhagavān_ (Vaikuṇṭha  ) - that place does not shine in the world, merely because it is called Kasi, (Kasi: that which shines); it does not become a (suitable) place of residence merely because it is called Ayodhya; it does not save us from our sins merely because it is called Avanti (Ave to protect); Kanchi is not excellent because of its name; nor is Madhura considered a seat of excellence merely because it is called Madhura. So also other cities do not become worthy merely because of their names, (if they are not to the liking of those who delight in the ambrosia of stories concerning _Bhagavān_ (Vaikuṇṭha   ).
