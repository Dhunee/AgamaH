(21) THE CHAPTER ON THE PRESCRIBED 

PATH OR ROUTE. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

Fire (archis), day.time, the bright half of the month sukla paksha), Uttarāyaṇa and the year, thence Vayu, Surya, Chandra and then Lightning, Varuna, Indra, Prajapati or Brahma -- having traversed this path in the order given above, the self crosses the river Viraja; then follows the wonder that defies (all description in words. 

THE ROUTE CALLED ARCHIRĀDI : 

Thus the Lord who lives in the heart add who is full of love (for the Jiva) starts with the self who desires mukti and who bas entered into the nädi in the head from out of Brahmapuri, pamely, the gross body, by the Brahma Nädi, which is, as it were, the main gate (of that city). In this He resembles & king who walks to and fro with his charming child in bis arins.

As has been said in the following verses :- "The self' passes through a beautiful opening in the centre of the sphere of the sup." "The "self makes an opening in the sphere of the sun, whose rays fill his chariot". "He goes through the middle of the sphere of the fiery sun", "The Lord' helps him to climb up by a ladder to Vaikunta through the sphere of the sun whose hot rays dispel the darkness and then removes the ladder," - (as described in these verses), the Lord sets the self on the path called devayına and leads him Himself with the following to guide bim, namely, archis or fire, day, the bright half of the month, Uttarayana and the year, Vayo, Surya and Chandra and Lightning: with Lighto. ing who is called also amunava and his companions, Varuna, Indra and Prajapati, the self is belped on its way.

says :- " With these guides who are immortal, he reaches Vaikunta and casts off this beaatiful prison bouse of samsāra." 

NOTE: Fire, Day, Suklapaksha, Uttarayana and the year arc, of course, inanimate; but the deities presiding over them (abhimani devatas) are the guides here referred to.) 

ENTERTAINMENT ON THE WAY: 

The Lord has said, “I remember my devotee and lead him to the supreme goal." In every one of these regions on the way (which belong respectively to Surya, Chandra etc.), the self enjoys all those delights which are described at great length in the sāstrās of Bhagavan (Āgamis). Thereafter it arrives at & region wbich it has long been eager to see and which has been described as follows:- "When 'shall I see with my own eyes the world called Vaikunta? It sbipes brilliantly, it is always with Bhagavan who is possessed of the six attributes, like jnana; it can never be attained by those who are not devoted to Vishnu; it is free from the three qualities of prakriti or matter (sattvam, rajas and tamas). It is full of the eternal sūris who divide the day into five parts and render the service to the Lord appropriate to each; it is also full of released souls who are like the eternal sūris. It has presence chambers, balls, and mansions. It is beautiful with forests and gardens; it has broad and deep wells, lakes and groves which adoro it. It is free from the sufferings due to prakriti; it is fit to be praised by the devās. It shines like ten thousand suns sbiping at once; it is constituted of pure sattvam unmingled with rajas and tamas," 

As soon as the self arrives at this region, it casts off the subtle body ( sukshma s'arira) which was kept on merely for the sake of the journey and not for experiencing the fruits of past karma: it casts off this subtle body like a boat which is set adrift after the crossing of the river and when the self has crossed the

river Viraja, the Lord endows the self with a body that is super - sensuous and not constituted of matter or prakriti; it is helped to reach the lake called Airammadiyam and then to approach the asvattha tree called Somasavana and is then welcomed by five hundred celestial damsels (apsaras) with garlands, ointments, fragrant powders, raiments and ornaments. The self is then decked by them with adoraments suited to Brabraan and the fragrances, flavours and splendours of Brabman are made to enter into it. It is then received by the eternal sūris. As the Alwar says. "The eternal sūris with crowns on their heads coupe ia groups to receive these self's or souls who are esteemed as the ser vants of Govinda in successive generations. They take the self to the tower with high walls which is adorned with banners. The self is then led to the entrance where the gates are kept by guards called Indra and Prajapati and receives super-sensuous (aprākrita) honours befitting a king. This is described in the three verses beginning with 10.9.9.-"As soon as they (the muktas) arrive at the gate, the guards who are eternal sūris say:-" The devotees of Bhagavan are oor wasters. So please enter our abode". "The sūris, who were there, wondered at the blessing vouchsafed to these released souls arriving from the earth. They considered it their own good fortune that these souls entered Vaikunta and wasbed their feet and beautiful women received them with treasures, fragrant powder, the pürnakumbha and the lamp. Then these souls lived ( for ever with the eternal sūris enjoying endless delights." 

Thereafter the self is led into the enchanting assembly in the hall (mantapa) set with gezin. As has been said in these slokas: "I do to not know how long I have spent my time in vain with this prakriti being subject to her sway. How can I remain associated with this prakriti, which takes the excellent forms (or bodies of the devās), the middling forms (or bodies of men) and the mean

forms (or bodies which experience the pains of hell)? I will depart from her and give up all contact with her and attain Bhagavan who is free from all blemish. I will become one with Him and I will not be one with this non - sentient prakriti. It is in the fitness of things that I should be one with Him and not with this prakriti", and "When shall "I see, with my eyes, Kesava who is black as a cloud, whose eyes are broad and who is playing with Lakshmi in the gardens? and "When shall we all see Sri Rama with his complexion black as a cloud and with bis long arms, - Kama wbo is firmly set in sattva, who has taken & staanch vow to protect those that seek his help and who is bent on relieving the sorrows of the world? Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness of the whole world, Sri Rama will dispel all our sorrow the moment we see him" - as stated in these slokas, the Lord reveals to the mukta His blissful form so that be may get rid of all his sorrows, enables him to acquire bis essential nature (with the \*eight great qualities), takes him to His feet and by säyujya with Himself - which means equal enjoyment - places him in the midst of His eternal servants (nitya süris) who enjoy eternal bliss and who (henceforth) are of the same class as be. 

Then the Lord blesses him with the grant of all such services as were desired by him and as are agreeable to Himself, having previously removed all hindrances and enabled bim to attain, bis essential nature, in a manifest form, and without any limitations of place, time and circumstance, so that these services may last es long as his soul lasts. The Lord embraces the nukta wbo has arrived just now and treats him, without the slightest difference, in the same manger as He treats the sūris, who are eternally free from all imperfections and who are like friends of the same age among themselves and with the Lord The Lord is immensely delighted at the bliss enjoyed by this eternal servant of His wbo is 

\*NOTE:--- The eight qualities :- freedom from sin, being without old age, without death, without sorrow, without hunger. without thirst, with all desired objects and with a will that meets with no hindrance. 11. Jitanta Stotram : 2-21

staunchly and exclusively devoted to Him, and who has attained the exalted position desired by Alavandar in his \* Stotram and by Sri Ramanuja in his Vaikuntagadyam. 

\* NOTE:-- In the Stotram and the Gadyam Sri Alavandar and Sri Rama nuja cry out, as it were, saying :- When shall I go to Vaikunta and see the Lord face to face and be His devoted and eternal servant? 

ARCHIRĀDI IS NOT THE ONLY ROUTE TO MOKSHA OR VAIKUNTA. THERE ARE OTHER ROUTES AS WELL. 

As in the case of such meditations as Madhu Vidya which are the means of attaining moksha after obtaining positions like those of the Vasüs, “The pore" quality of sattva makes the self attain Nara yapa who is of the form of Apiruddha. The Lord who is of the pure nature of Aniruddha leads him himself to the Supreme Vasu. deva (Para Vasudeva)," and again: "Koow, \*0 best of Brabmins, that this is the truth. Tbose who bave become free from punya apd pāpa, who are devoid of karma which is like fuel kind. ling the fire of samsāra and who walk along the route to the world of Vishnu - to them the sun who dispels the darkness of all the world is said to be the doorway." "This world is sustained by the SUD. With their material body burnt up by the sun, they become invisible as they bave no bodies and are of the nature of the soul wbich is atomic in size. They then enter the god Aniruddha. Having remained in the body of Aniruddha (for some time) and leaving it, they reach Pradyumda remaining now as only mind. Leaving Pradyumna, they enter into Sankarshana who is the deity presiding over Jīvas (abhimani detata). Along with them proceed those who have perform.ed Jnāna Yoga and Karma yoga. Having become free from the three qualities (sattvam, rajas and tamas), they enter into the Supreme Being who is the abode of all, who resides within the Self and who is free from all imper fections. Know that Vasudeva is the abode of all (vāsa) and that He is, in truth, impjanent as antaryāmi ip all. Those who bave

subjected themselves to spiritual disciplines, who have perfect control over their senses and who have attained peace of mind enter into Vasudeva, considering Him as the only object of attaia ment." 

(As in the case of Madhu Vidya) and in these passages cited from the Mahābhārata, it has also been stated that there is another route for muktas :-- "They go from here to Svetadvipa, and reach gari who has the Universe as His form. Then they reach Hari in the form of Aniruddha who is in the ocean of milk. From there they go to Pradyumna, who is the Lord of Brahma and of all others. Thence they proceed to Sankarshana, the eternal Bhagavan. To those who want to have, for ever, the bliss of Brahman, who have attained success in being staunchly and exclu sively devoted to Bhagavan and who perform the worship of the Lord in the five different periods of the day -- to them this is another path (leading to moksha). In the section (devoted to Pancharatra in Sri Bhashya, it is said also that "those who attain mukti give up the worship of the incarnational form (Vibhava), proce 

ed thence to the worship of the Vyiha’and finally after the worsbip of the Vyüha, attain the Sapreme Being called Vasudeva." These refer to particular classes of those who attain mukti. Similarly certain specified routes are laid down for those who attain mukti after remaining for a wbile in the Satyaloka, the world of Brahma. These also apply to special cases such as krama mukti (release by gradation). It is not our object to describe these differences in the routes to mukti, which are diverse for diverse souls, as their know. ledge is prescribed only to the respective udhikäris. 

THE MEDITATION ON THE ROUTE. HOW USEFUL 

TO THE PRAPANNA 

To the man who has adopted bhakti or upāsana as big upaya, the meditation on the path to mukti bas been prescribed as an anga to be performed daily. But to the man who has adopted 

16. Jayat Samhita: 

17. Sri Bhashya: 2-2-41 

214 prapatti as the means, there is no such need. Still, at the time of adopting this upāya, since he should know what his goal is in order that he may be competent to adopt the upāya, the meditation may help to remember the supreme goal. It becomes an end in itself, as it produces a keen delight in knowing that, very soon, the supreme goal begged for at the time of prapatti will be attained. In this respect it is like counting the days before the ensuing wedding. The prapanna will attain the desired object even by a cursory knowledge (of the path) (though the details are not known to him.) 

Of this meditation on the path to mukti, the state of Sita is an example (of whom it is said):"It looked 18 as if Sita was driving in the chariot of her mind drawn by her desires which were like fleet horses, towards Sri Rama, the greatest of kings, who was aware of his nature that always insisted on protectiog those that sought bis help". 

TAMIL VERSE: 

Agoi, Daytime, Suklapaksha, Uttarāyana, the year, the interveping Vayu, Surya, Chandra, Lightning, Varuna, the king of the devas, (Indra) with his uw brella (sigpifying rulerskip) and Prajapati – by these the soul of the mukta is entertained on the way with delights and thereafter it enters the abode of bliss. 

SANSKRIT SLOKA: 

We become exhausted by frequent a acept (to svarga) and descent back to the earth along the path of the Pitris (the path of smoke) like the water-pot going up and down the well by the rotation of the water-wheel. (We become exhausted likewise) by incessant journey, to and fro, along the route to hell. (80) Hari makes the various deities (on the shiniog path of archis) entertain us who are so exbausted and at length confers bliss on us by keeping us, as it were, under His shade which is (like the shade of & sandal tree). 18.
