  <p>(27) THE CHAPTER ON THE MOOLAMANTRA</p>
<p>(ASHTAKSHARA.)</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>(1) THE GOD OF THE MANTRA: Of us who, with a knowledge of its meaning, are medi.&rsquo; tating on the mantra taught to us by our ācharya which consiste of the pranava (aum) at the begipning with the word namas (namo) immediately following it and then the word Nārāyaḥāya revealed in the Vedas - of us who are not competent to adopt other upayas and the responsibility of redeeming whose souls has been accepted by our Lord, May He dispel very soon all those obstacles (past karma) which stand in the way of our enjoying the imperial bliss of service to Him!.</p>
<p>(2) THE SEER WHO REVEALED THE MANTRA:</p>
<p>May that great seer dwelling in the hermitage of Badarika ( Narayana ), the friend of (all ) good men, who occupies &amp; certain cbariot called Moolamantra with its eight syllables as ) its eigbt wheels and who instructs his reverent pupils, Nara and others (Narada and the like) in the dharma concerning bimself wbich is characteristic of Krita Yuga - may that great seer confer (His) blessing on us !</p>
<p>(3) THE MANTRA: Tjet us adore that great mantra, the most important of the * vgūpaka inantras, within which lies idibedded the gist of all the revealed truths found in the srutis and the smritis without any exception.</p>
<p>* The three mantras Namo Narayanaya, Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, and Namo Vishnave, with the Pranava (AUM) preceding each are called yyapaka mantras for they bave the words, Narayana, Vasudeva and Visbpu, which by their etymology, convey the meaning &lsquo;Omnipresent&rsquo; or &lsquo;all pervading&rsquo; (yyapaka)</p>
<p>346 OHA</p>
<p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>APTER</p>
<p>(4) THE DISCIPLE WHO HAS BEEN INITIATED INTO THE MEANING OF THE MANTRA BY THE</p>
<p>GRACE OF THE GURU:</p>
<p>Here a being* who has been blessed by his guru with vision sees all the meaning concealed within the moola-mantra, without any exception, as if it is a treasure placed underneath a plate made of crystal.</p>
<p>. *NOTE: Commentators say that there is here an implied reference also to the author himself who obtained all his knowledge concerning the moola mantra from his acharya, Sri Appullar:</p>
<p>THE PURPORT OF THE THREE MANTRAS AND THEIR</p>
<p>RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER:</p>
<p>So far we have explained the most essential truths which every sātvika should remember and established them on a firın basis (of authority (pramūna) and argument). We will now proceed to show in what ways, in the three great mysteries (mantras) which reveal all these (truths), the words and the sentences should be construed (in order that their meanings may be properly understood).</p>
<p>Among them, the first, Damely, Tirumantra (Ashtük shara) helps us to understand such things as our essential nature, (svarīpa) which finds true happiness only in being the s&rsquo;esha of the Supreme Being. By that (revelation), it creates a longing for the Supreme Goal of attainment preceded by the removal of all obstacles thereto and also a feeling of urgency (tvarū) (in regard to that attainment) whereby the competency for the adoption of the upāya (prapatti) becomes perfected. Dvaya reveals clearly the manner in which this particular upaya should be adopted by this adhikari with an antecedent longing for the fruit thereof. The charama sloka enjoins (as a vidhi) the adoption of this upāya. Though it is possible to find all these truths in each of these three mantras by itself, from the words themselves and from the sepse</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MANTRAS</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>suggested by them (ārtha ), yet each of these three bas &amp; primary aim (which is different from that of the others). In the Tiru mantra, the first syllable ( a ) in the first word ( aum) expresses, in a concise form, the Supreme Reality who is the Protector or Saviour; in the middle word (namas ) (namo) and the third word (Nārāyanāya ) are to be understood respectively the upāya (pra. patti) and the Upeya (the end or goal, viz., service to Narayana ); what is stated briefly (in the Tirumantra) is made clear in Dvaya. (1) The word prapadye in Duaya indicates the particular kind of adhikāri (namely, one who is destitute of other upāyas - akinchana) by the first person singular and (2) the needlessness of other upayas, is inferred from the sense, and (so also) (3) the disappearance of the hindrances to the goal is implicit in the last word namas, The Charama-sloka explains dis. tinctly these (three things), (that are only hinted at in the Dvaya ). These three (mantras) are to us (inen destitute of other upāyas), maintenance, nourishment and enjoyment (of the fruit), being, respectively, the causes of knowledge (jnāna ), practice or adoption (anushtāna ) and the end or fruit (of our endeavour.)</p>
<p>It has been said: &ldquo;The God,&rsquo; Narayana, who is perfect in the possession of the six attributes is certainly in the form of Ashtūkshara in the mouths of tbose who utter the mantra,&rdquo; So, from the tongue of the cichārya, it dispels the darkness (ignorance) in the cave of the disciple&rsquo;s heart and makes him realise his pure and essential pature, wbich finds bliss only in being the sesha of the Supreme Being. Since it gives (in this manner) real (spiri tual) existence to biin, the Tirumantra is his maintenance (dhüraka). T&rsquo;he sharama sloka is the cause of his advancement in the parti, cular kind of knowledge which would enable him to adopt the final upaya (prapatti). It is the final word as a precept or instruction concerning the upāya, omitting nothing that should be learnt. Therefore the Charama siloka is bis nourishment (poshaka). Dvaya is the cause of the attaioment of the Supreme Goal of</p>
<ol>
<li>Naradiyam: 1-32</li>
</ol>
<p>348 CHAPTER</p>
<p>existence by a single utterance of it and enables &amp; person by con stant meditation to feel that he has attained bis object. Therefore Dvaya is an object of enjoyment (bhogya).</p>
<p>THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF TIRUMANTRA:</p>
<p>Among these three mantras), in regard to Tirumantra, the seer, (rishi), the metre (cchandas) the god revealed by it, (devata), the germ (bija), the potency (sakti), the colour (varia), the application (viniyoga), the locality (sthāna) and nyāsa should be learnt from the respective kalpas and traditions (sampradaya). The greatness and glory of Tirumantra are well known froin Upanishads like Atharvana and Kata, from s&rsquo;astras like that of Manu, and from various kalpas like Nārāyanūtmaka Hairanyagarbha kalpa, Nāradīya kalpa and Bodhūyaniya kalpa.</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;Of &ldquo;all mantras, the mantras treating of Bbagavan are the highest. Of the countless mantras treating of Bhagavan, the three vyāpaka mantras are the highest, so also the eternal moola-inantra is the highest of all mantras ; of all secrets, this is the supreme secret; of all things that purify, this is the most purificatory&rdquo;. So it is the highest among the three vyāpaka mantras; it is the essence of all the Vedas; it is capable of remov ing all evil influences; it is the means of obtaining all the objects desired by men; it helps in the adoption of all upāyas; it can be uttered by all castes, either in its Vedic form (with aum) or in its tantric form (without the aunı), in accordance with their respective competence; it reveals, in po uncertain terms, all the reals (tattvas), both those that are pervaded by Bhagavan and that which pervades all (viz the Supreme Self); it does not require the help or aid of any other mantra and is common to all the forms of Bhagavan (*like Sri Rama, Sri Krishna and so on). Owing to these reasons, all</p>
<p>NOTE.. They may all be worshipped with the utterance of the moola mantra, whereas other mantras are to be used only in connection with particular forms.</p>

<p>achārgas delight in it. The Alvars, too, sing its praise with delight in the following passages &ndash; &quot; Having learnts Thy holy mantra with eight syllables&rdquo;, &ldquo;Those who have been initiated by the acharya into the mantra with eight syllables and utter it with the proper nishta are capable of ruling over Vaikunta&rdquo;, &quot; Those who constantly delight in the mantra with eight syllables and utter it become capable of ruling over Vaikunta&quot;, &ldquo;You were devotees that sang the name of the Lord saying &ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&rdquo; 80 that country and town might understand&rdquo; and &ldquo;By uttering the holy name Namo Nārāyaṇāya in the proper way (2. e.) without seeking any material gain&rdquo; etc, etc. The seers (rishis) too, have declared as follows:- &ldquo;Many were the great seers like Sanaka who attained the abode of Visbnu by uttering the Ashtākshara&rdquo;, &ldquo;Just&rsquo; as among the deities there is no one superior to Narayana, there is, among the mantras, no mantra superior to the Ashta kshara&rdquo;; &ldquo;Raising my hand and swearing that it is true, I declare this to you! O my children and my disciples, listen. There is no mantra superior to the mantra of eight syllables. Adore Bhagavan with it always. Show your devotion to Him with it, and worship Him with it. Those who show their devotion to Him by looking upon this mantra as supreme will never perish (i. e. will not be in Samsāra.)&rdquo; and 11&quot; Sitting, or lying down, or standing anywhere, we have adopted only the mantra, Namo Nārāyanāya as our upāya.&quot;</p>
<p>The Supreme Ruler bad this mantra taught to Pundarika by Narada; he received it as his supreme good; and as stated in the sloka ; &quot; Pandarika &ldquo;whose mind was ever bent on dharma understood that, of all things to be attained, Narayana was the highest and attained mukti by uttering the mantra with eight syllables : Namo Nārāyaṇāya&rdquo;. He practised this mantra and 3. Peria Thirumozhi 8-10-3</p>

<p>IT MAY BE UTTERED BY ALL WITH THE OMISSION OF THE PRAŅAVA AND THE SUFFIX OF THE</p>
<p>FOURTH CASE AT THE END:</p>
<p>When this mantra is taken without the pranava (at the beginning) and the dative suffix at the end of Narayana (i. e.) (as Namo Nārāyana), every one is competent to utter it. This may be seen from the Varaha purāna in the context of the sanctity of Kaisika Dvādasī, where it is said : 18&quot; (Nampaduvan), who was of the caste that eat dog&rsquo;s flesh, came back after pronouncing the words: Namo Nārāyaņa&quot;. It may also be evident from the following Tamil verses: “When the name of Bhagavan is uttered, one should say Namo Nārāyana &ldquo;, &quot; Having sobtained this excellent garland called Namo Narayana etc&rdquo; and &quot; There is 1certainly a toogue in the mouth and there is certainly also the mantra called Namo Nāraņa&quot; which should be uttered at a single breath&quot;.</p>
<p>To Brahmins and the like (Kshatriyas), the mantra consists of eight syllables including the praiava just as it occurs in the Veda. It has been stated: &ldquo;Karma!? *is said, in the ocean of nectar called Pancharatra, to be of three kinds: to Brabmins karma is Vaidic (i.e.) to be performed with Vedic mantras; to Kshatrias, karma is both Vaidic and tantric; to Vaisyas and Sudras karma is tantric; or karma may be tantric to all.

<p>NOTE: When the worship of Vishnu is performed with only Vedic mantras, it is Vaidic karma; when it is performed only with the mantras found in Panchararra, it is tantric and when it is performed with both, the karma is said to be both Vaidic and tantric.</p>

<p>pranava at the beginning) and the Shadakshara (the mantra with six syllables, Namo Vishnave with the pranava at the beginning) - these are the principal mantras of Visboa whose splendour is beyond all measure. These mantras with the pranava ( at the beginning) are Vaidika mantras; without the pranava they are Tântric mantras. To women and Sudras the utterance of the Moolainantra should be without the dative suffix (of the word Narayana). So also there is, for them, no svara, no pranava nor anganyāsa or other rules. To them the utterance of the mere mantra (without pranava ) is enjoined.&rdquo; In accor dance with this, it has been stated further: &ldquo;The syllable a in the latter part of the word Nārāyana (i.e.) ayana denotes Visboa. If the nasal sound of the vowel m (anuswāra) at the end of the word ayanam be added to it, it becomes am and this &lsquo;a with the m2 becomes the germ (bija) of moolamantra. By this addition, the mantra comes to consist of eight letters.</p>
<p>Even without the pranava, these adhikaris (women and Sudras) obtain the same fruit or goal and this may be seen from the following sloka - &ldquo;Of what use are many mantras for the purpose of the fruit desired? Of what use are many vratas (ascetic observances )? The mantra, Namo Nārāyanāya, copfers all the boons that may be desired&rdquo;. The a in an which has been frescribed as a substitute for praṇava (aum) should be considered as having, in brief, all the meaning contained in prasava, because the syllable a being the first letter is stated (in the sāstra) to denote everything in a concise form. The meaning of the syllable u in the praňava, namely, &lsquo;only&rsquo; is inferred from the meaning. The ideas of knowersbip and the like contained in the third letter of prānava, namely m should be understood as being present in the base of the second syllable of namas (or namo), namely n.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF PRAŅAVA AND ITS POTENCY:</p>
<p>When the pranava is used as an independent mantra by itself, it may be pronounced in &amp; single unit or instant of time (mātra), 18. Naradiya Kalpam: 1-57</p>

<p>or two units of time, or three or three and a half units of time and its meanings vary in accordance with these units of time to denote either Brahman as effect ( kārya ) or Brahman as cause ( karana): (i. e.) when it is pronounced in a single unit of time, it means Brabman with the earth as His body; when in two units, it means, Brahman with the antariksha (the middle air or sky) as His body: when in three units, it means Brabmao with the world of svarga as His body; when in three and a half units of time, it denotes Brahman the Pure and the ultimate cause (of every thing). In some sāstras it is said that, when the pranava begins any of the three vyāpaka mantras, it should be considered as a single syllable (without any parts as a • 14 - m) and as denoting then the Supreme Self.</p>
<p>20&rdquo; Pranava or the Veda consistiog of three letters, existed at the beginning, and the three Vedas, Rik, Yajus, and Sāman were within it (in a, u and m respectively). It should be kept as a secret. It is a Veda with three letters and is different from the other Vedas. He who knows the pranava is a Vedavit (one who knows the Veda or the three Vedas).&quot; The greatness and glory of pranava are well known from such passages as the above. In the nyāsavidya, the pranava is an independent mantra and refers to the surrender of the self, for it has been said: “The havis or offering called the self should be taken with the mantra beginning vasuranya and offered in the eternal fire called Achyuta with the mantra called pranava&quot;. For the same reason some construe it even here as denoting surrender. Others construe that the pranava should be considered in the Tirumantra only as helping to realise one&rsquo;s being sesha (tu the Lord), sioce primarily it gives knowledge of the essential Dature (svarūpa) of the jiva being s&rsquo;esha, If so, it contributes &amp; qualification or element of compe tence for the upāya (viz. praying for protection).</p>

<p>MEANING OF A IN PRANAVAS</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>It has been said :-&ldquo;By &amp; knowledge of Iswara, the devont jīva attains supreme purity&rdquo;. When we consider pranava as giving only a knowledge of the s&rsquo;eshi (Bhagavao), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean that it removes the upfitness of the jiva for the adoption of the upāya. When we consider pranava as indi. cating a kpowledge of the upaya, namely, Bhagavan, (and not the knowledge of the seshi), &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; would mean inoksha. Bhagavan Sandilya explained, as follows, the way in which the meaning of pranava should be considered:- &ldquo;This Supreme Being is of such and such a nature and the jiva is of such and such a nature. Yoga is said to be a kaowledge of the relationship bet. ween the two (that Iswara is the seshi and the jiva the sesha )&rdquo;. This meaning has been elaborated as follows:-&ldquo;the a (in*pranava) is Vishnu who creates, sustains and destroys the world, the m (in it) means the jiva, who exists for the fulfiment of the pur poses of Vishnu. The u (in it) indicates that this relationship between the two can exist only between them (and no others). So pranava which consists of three letters and is the essence of the (tbree) Vedas reveals this meaning.&rdquo; The Tamil verse which says, &ldquo;I am the &ldquo;servant of Bhagavao, the Lord of Tirukkanna puram; bow am I entitled to be the servant of anyone else ?&rdquo; - tbis Tamil verse also explains the meaning of pranava. The strutis and the smritis describe the three letters of pranava as the essence of the three Vedas.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF A IN PRANAVA:</p>
<p>That these letters have these ineanings will be seen from the following passage in Vamana purāļa : -&lsquo;By the first** letter a in the prinava, which is one of the members or limbs of the mantra with eight letters, Bhagavan, who is the support of every. thing, is denoted; the letter a is the origin of all words and Brahman is the origin of all things denoted by these words.</p>

<p>Therefore a denotes Bhagavan. He is denoted by that letter. This relationship between the letter a and Bhagavān is seen from the meaning to be appropriate.&rdquo; Sri Ramanuja stated in the Vedārthasangraha that by the first letter (of pranava) which is the origin of all words is denoted Narayana who is the origin of all things denoted by these words. From this it follows that Bhaga van is the material and the instrumental cause of the whole world and that, as may be inferred from this, He is both omniscient and omnipotent and has other such qualities. &ldquo;a means* negation (No) and wben masculine denotes Vishnu&rdquo;. &ldquo;The letter a denotes Vishnu&rdquo;; &quot; By using the letter a, wbich is the first name of Narayana, what (an excellent) benedictory prayer has been made !&quot; All this is evident from the Nighantus and the usage of scholars.</p>
<p>When this a depotes the Supreme Ruler, it is derived, accord. ing to the science of grammar, from the verbal root ava which means to protect, to please etc., (the termination va is dropped) and the word that results refers to one who is a protector and so on (one who pleases). Though this root has many meanings, its best-known meaning is to protect; further it is this meaning which is required here (in connection with the mantra &lsquo;aum&rsquo;); besides there is no authoritative etymological explanation that it should be considered as having many meanings; so the first meaning given (in grammar), namely, to protect is the direct and primary mean. ing of the word and the other meanings, when required, should be considered 88 suggested (lukshaņā) by the primary meaning. This is the appropriate way of explaining and the acharyas have commented on it only in this way as meaning the Protector or Saviour. As the meaning &lsquo;protector&rsquo; is not restricted by any limiting adjunct, the protectorship extends to all. The manner of protection varies with the objects of protection as shown by the pramāņas (sources of knowledge). Since the protection is not stated to be based on any reason or condition, it might appear to be unconditioned (nirupādhika) but Iswara, who is omnipotent and independent, expects some vyāja or action prescribed by His 26.

<p>will to be performed by the jīva, which would serve as a justification for conferring moksha and the like on those who are in samsāra. Towards the nityas ( the eternal süres) and those who have already attained mukti, the protection is full and complete by way of maintaining what is already present and this is the result of Bhagavan&rsquo;s natural and unconditioned mercy. But this natural mercy (kūrunya) is restrained in the case of those in samsāra by the condition (upādhi) of the need for punishment which has arisen by beginningless offence when actions which are displeasing to Him have occurred. Prapatti and other vyājas have been prescribed in the Sāstras only for renoving this condition which acts as a restraining force (on the Lord&rsquo;s (mercy).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>The fact of being the Master makes it appropriate that He should proteot; prapatti and the like are (only) secondary helps.</p>
<p>The primary reason (for protecting) is the Omnipresent Lord&rsquo;s mercy which is not dependent upon anything else.</p>
<p>As stated in the siloka : &ldquo;In all &ldquo;siddhāntas and in Vedanta, it is declared that the Lord protects with His consort Lakshmi, ever by His side, for she is the very embodiment of mercy&rdquo;, the Lord who has determined to grant redemption to all is ever ready (to do so) with His consort. The relationship with His spouse for the purpose of protection, which is evident from the pramāņas is derived (not explicitly from the words but) by inference from the purpose (of protection) which is evident from the pramānas. Whenever Bhagavan is referred to, Lakshmi should also be con. sidered as referred to, for it results from the principle:- &ldquo;If two things are enjoined as necessary, wherever one of them is men. tioned, the other should also be considered as indicated” (Sanni. yogasishtanyāya). Thus the acharyas, too, have said, “Since Thou(Lakshmi) art ever inseparably connected with Thy Lord,</p>

<p>356 CHAPTER</p>
<p>even the Veda does not mention Thee separately.&rdquo; In all vidyās or forms of meditation (prescribed in the Upanishads) all qualities and attributes of Brahman which define Bis Dature are to be meditated upon (even though only one or two of them are actually mentioned in the particular Vidyā). Sirr ilarly this attribute, Damely, Lakshmi, who is the most important of all attributes sbould also be borbe in mind. It is this attribute (Lakshmi) which rules out other deities, (for they are not related to Lakshmi in that way) and defines Bhagavan&rsquo;s essential nature which is not dependent upon anything else, as having an excellence which sur passes everything else, His essential nature, form and glories, wbich do not arise from any other source, acquire even greater splendour from the essential pature, form and glories of Lakshmi, who is His attribute, and shine thereby. This may be seen in the simile; &ldquo;like radiance which cannot be separated from the **sun.&rdquo; And this has been declared by the great sages who understood the nature and person of the Supreme Deity. So also in the word Nārāyaṇa in Tirumantra, Narayana&rsquo;s relationsbip to His consort should be borne in mind. This relationship to the spouse is dis tinctly and explicitly stated in the Duaya (Srimat - with Sri). In Sri Ramapuja&rsquo;s elaboration of the Dvaya in bis *Gadya, it is true that, among the nrārās in the words beginning with Bhagavan Nārāyana (Nārānām + ayanan) Lakshmi is included among the ruāras by commentators. (From tbis it might be argued that she is also a jīva like other hāras). But this inclusion is only to indicate Her dependence ou Her Lord and Nāras means etymo logically only “those who are related to Nara&rdquo; without the specification of the form of relationship. So from that, it should not be inferred that Laksbwi is also a jiva.</p>
<p>Here the first letter a is in the dative or fourth case singular, the (usual) dative singular suffix has been dropped. The reasons for bolding that the a is in the dative singular (when no case - suffix is seen ) are as follows: (1) In the place whicb enjoins the</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF A IN AUM</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>surrender of the self to the Supreme Self (i.e.) the Taittirīya Upanishad, the pranava is prescribed as the mantra (for doing so); (80 it should mean &rsquo;to the Supreme Self (dative)&rsquo;, (2) the mantra should reveal the nature of the action to be performed, (3) the self to be surrendered is seen in the third letter (m) (in aum) and the Supreme Brabman for whom it is surrendered is seen in the base (prakriti, viz. a) of the first letter; (4) the person to whom the surrender is made and the object which is surrendered should not be in the saine case. Therefore the a (which is the first letter) should be considered to be in the case (i.e.) (dative) suited to the word indicating the person to whom the surrender is made. The view of perverse interpreters (Advaitins) that a und the m (in aum are in the same case (nominative or first case ) and indicate the identity in the essential nature of the jiva and the Supreme Self is opposed to many pramānas (like pratyaksha and sabda); besides it would not fit in with the natural and obvious meaning of the word namo (namas) and the dative of the word Narayana (i.e.) Nārāyaṇāya which are uttered along with the pranava, This is obvious also from the text twhich distinguisbes pranava as the bow, the self as the arrow, Brahman as the target and the act of surrender as the hitting of the target (the arrow and the target cannot be identical). In the pranava in Tirumantra, when the intention is the surrender of responsibility (bharasamarpanam), the dative or fourth case should be considered to bave the same meaning as the dative in the pranava considered as an independent mantra (i.e.) the person to whom the surrender is made. When the pranava is interpreted as indicating the essential nature (svarīpa) of the self wbich consists in existing solely for the Supreme Self (i.c.) in being sesha, the dative signifies &lsquo;baving another&rsquo;s interests alone as one&rsquo;s interests&rsquo;. Therefore it reveals the relationship of sesha and s&rsquo;eshi which exists between the jīva and the Paramātmā. We should then bear in mind that we are unconditional s&rsquo;eshas (nirupādhika sesha) to the Supreme Self, who is the unconditional seshi (nirupādhika seshi).</p>
<p>† Mundakopanishad : II - jj - 4.</p>
<p>858 CHAPTER</p>
<p>When the Lord who is the Supreme Ruler says, “You are my s&rsquo;esha&quot; and pursues him, the jival, owing to his egoism, tries to wriggle out saying, “ I exist only for myself.&quot; Therefore the thought that we are seshas to the Supreme Ruler will give (apiri. tual) existence to the jīva, who is otherwise, as it were, (spiritually) non-existent. To indicate the importance of this thought that we are seshas), the relationship to the s&rsquo;eshi (for a) is declared even before the mention of the sesha (namely 11 the jīva).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA;</p>
<p>When the relationship of our being seshas to the Supreme Being is well established in the mind, the other requisities (for spiritual life) such as self-control and serenity (suma and duma) follow easily as being necessary to it. When that thought is not established in the mind, all the rest serve no purpose and are, as it were, non-existent.</p>
<p>When Iswara is the s&rsquo;eshi of all, He is always (to be thought of as) with His Consort, for it has been said, “The two kinds of glory (nityavibhuti and lila - viblitti) are s&rsquo;esha to me and to her, O Brahma and this is declared in the Vedanta and in my siīstras (Pancharātra āgamas).&quot; So also it is said &ldquo;Being seshisl is single and it rests with two (Bhagavan and Lakshui).” In the Agaisho miya sacrifice, the deity (to whom the havis or offering is made) is not Agni alone nor Soma alone; the deity of the sacrifice (which is single) is Agni and Sonia. So also in this offering of the self, the deity to whom the offering is intended is both (Bhagavan and Lakshmi). In order to reveal this, it was said “Being s&rsquo;eshi is single and it rests with two&rdquo;. When we consider the text* in the Kata sruti, it becomes clear from the words themselves that the self is s&rsquo;esha to both. To be sesha is to serve the purposes of another without the primary desire to gain something for oneself. 30. Vishvaksena Sambita 31. Somasi Andan - vide before (page )</p>
<p>NOTE*: KATA TEXT: By the letter a is denoted Vishnu, the ruler of all the worlds, and Lakshmi who is supported by Vishnu is denoted by the letter w; the m indicates that the jiva is their servapt. This is the definition of pranava.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF U IN AUM.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>The author of Sri Bhashya has explained it as follows:-681A He is the s&rsquo;esha whose essential nature (svarupa) has, for its sole interest, the promotion of the glory or excellence of another; the other is the s&rsquo;eshi.&quot; The genitive dual case ending which is indicated by the Kata sruti (their servant) is elliptical. The genitive or sixth case, which ordinarily indicates relationship in general, extends here to the special relationship of being sesha to s&rsquo;eshi which is understood from the pramūnas. Or it may be considered that in order to make clear the relationship of existing only for them&rsquo;, (viz. Bhagavad and Lakshmi), the dative daal termination is present, though in ellipsis. If we take this view, the sruti which says &ldquo;the servant of both&rdquo; explains the neaning of the elliptical dative dual.</p>
<p>If we take this interpretation that the u refers to Lakshmi and that the self is s&rsquo;esha to both (Bhagavan and Lakshmi) the only! formerly stated to be the meaning of&rsquo;u (in a u 1) is not given by the word itself but is suggested by the context. It comes to this that this self (the jiva) is the unconditioned s&rsquo;esha to both Bhaga van and Lakshmi and to no other.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF U IV AUM :</p>
<p>If, on the other bapd, we take the middle letter u to mean &lsquo;only&rsquo; in accordance with Vedic usage, the meaning &lsquo;only&rsquo; is to prevent the doubts concerning the relationship of being sesha extending to any other (deity) unconditionally and this is done by the word itself (and is not merely suggested by the context). Since it declares that the relationship of being sesha to other deities than Bhagavan and lakshmi does not pertain to one&rsquo;s essential Oature, it follows that contact with other deities should not exist to the man who has a knowledge of the nature of his self, and this avoid ance of contact extends even to the devotees of other deities. In the chapter on the Ultimate Object in Life, we have already stated that, since being s&rsquo;esha to Bhagavatas is pleasing to the Lord, it does not constitute the offence of being sesha to others.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>31A Vedarthasangraba.</p>
<p>360 CE APTER</p>
<p>Thus if by the force of the word itself (namely w), we get the meaning that the relationship of being sesha is ruled out in the case of others, it is also evident that the idea of the relationship not existing (towards the Lord) is also ruled out, (since there is no limitation of time (ie) the self is always s&rsquo;esha to the Lord and is never non-s&rsquo;esha to Him). By this ruling out of the non-existence of the relationsbip of sesha, the substance (dravya) called the sentient being&rsquo; is seen to be an attribute incapable of being sepa rated from Iswara (at any time or place) and is therefore shown to be bis body, in the same way as non-septient matter is His body.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF M IN AUM:</p>
<p>The third letter m (in aunı) denotes, primarily, the jiva but means also by implication (upalakshana) all other things wbich are s&rsquo;esha to the Lord. That this (m) denotes the jīvātma may be understood from the following: (1) The letter m which denotes the jiva should be used to perform vyāpaka nyasa (ie ) to performa nyūsa in one&rsquo;s body as if it pervades the whole body&quot;: (2) The five groups of consonants (in the Sanskrit alphabet) each contain. ing five letters beginning with k (F) and ending with m(A) denote the twentyfive tattvas or reals as stated in the Tattvasagarasamhita and the like. The Supreme Ruler is always within these reals as their Inner Self” and (3) “The five* letters in the Ka (F) group denote the five elements (bliitāni), those in the Cha (a) group depote the five senses of action karmendriyās); those in the ta (E) group denote the five senses of knowledge (jncnedriyis), those in the ta (a) group denote the five tanmatras (like sidell) the pa (T) denotes the urind, the pha (i) ahankūru, ba (a) denotes inahat and bha (27) prakriti. The jiviitin:t is denoted by the letter m and he is the twentyfifth tattva or real.&quot;</p>
<p>From these it is evident that the jivātma is different both) from the twenty-four reals which have the defects of inertness and non-septience and from the twenty-sixtb Real, (namely,</p>

<p>Iswara) who is the (ultimate) cause of everything, the Saviour of all and the seshi of all and who is indicated by the first letter (in aum),</p>
<p>In the Tirumantra, the words, and Nāra (in Narayana), refer only to the attributes, namely, the jiva (and matter) as determinate words (* Nishkarshaka words) and do not refer to the Supreme Self within the jīva (and matter).</p>
<p>If we examine the grammatical form of this letter (m), it is found to have been derived from the root mana meaning &rsquo;to kaow&rsquo; and other such roots (mas - meaning &lsquo;measure &lsquo;) and it denotes the jīvātmā who is atomic and who is of the essential nature (svarüpa) of jnina and (at the same time) possessed of the attri. bute, jnāra. This is in accordance with the Brahma Sutra (2-3-19), which says &quot; The jīvātmā is a kaower (ie) he possesses the attribute &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; (and is not merely ināna or knowledge as the Advaitins contend) and this is from the s&rsquo;ruti itself&quot;.</p>
<p>Though the jīvātmi is said to be, in general terms, of the essential nature of knowledge, yet since this essential nature (svarūpa) is koown froin the pramūnas (sabdha and the like) to be agreeable and pleasing, it is also of the essential nature of kinanda or bliss which is a specific form of knowledge</p>
<p>When the jivütmii is said to be possessed of the attribute, knowledge, since the pramillas declare him to be possessed of knowledge without any restrictive word, it should be understood that in the state of mukti, his knowledge is all-pervasive and got limited by conditions (or upüdhi) and without any restriction or livnit.</p>
<p>* NOTE: According to Visishtadvaita doctrine, many words are in determinate in meaning; for example go or cow&rsquo; may mean the body of the cow, or the soul of the cow or the Supreme Self within the cow as its Antaryami; some words are determipate in meaning, for instance &lsquo;cowocss&rsquo; ( gorvam ) which refers only to the jati (genus) &lsquo;cow&rsquo; of the cow. The m (in aum) refers to the jiva and not to the Supreme Self).</p>
<p>362 CE APTER</p>
<p>When we consider this natural and pure form of the jivātmü, it will appear that it is free from the ipertness and other such defects of nonsentient things and so also from such things as pain, suffering etc., which are found in sainsāra. Hence in the essen tial nature and the attributes (svarūpa and dharma) of the jivātmā, there is also spotlessness or freedom from all impurity or defect (nirmalatva). The seeker after salvation should meditate that the jīvātmā is absolutely pure and has its enjoyment only in being sesha to the Supreme Being and this may be seen from the Brahma Sutra (3-3-52) which says: &ldquo;No, only the state (of the jivātmā) that differs from the state of samsāra (should be medi. tated upon), for that is the state which will ensue (in moksha) as in the contemplation of Brahman as He is &ldquo;.</p>
<p>To the prapama, the meditation on the fruit of attainment in mukti is useful in creating &amp; desire for that fruit. The forms of meditation (concerning the form of the self) are different in accordance with the difference in the fruits desired and this is evident from the eighth chapter of the Gita and Sri Bhashya and other such treatises.</p>
<p>Since the pramānas declare a plurality (or very large number) of souls, this third letter me (in aum), used in the singular, denotes the jāti or geous (and not a single individual), as in the Brahma Sutra (2-3.18) which says. The soul (or self) is not (generated) for (80 says) the Sruti.&rsquo; (Here the word &rsquo; soul&rsquo; denotes the genus and therefore it really means &rsquo; souls&rsquo; (or self&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Though it is stated here that all souls are s&rsquo;eshas to Bhagavan in general terms as in: &ndash;&ldquo;Alsouls33A are the servants of the Supreme Self by their very nature&rdquo; &ndash; yet since the individual is also included in the all souls,&rsquo; it follows that for that reason, every one should realise that he is also the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Here the knowledge of being a s&rsquo;esha, the abandonment of the conceit of one&rsquo;s independence (of the Lord), the adoption of the</p>
<p>33A. Iswara Samhita</p>
<p>MEANING OF M</p>
<p>363</p>
<p>particular upaya (dainely, prapatti) and the prayer for the fruit to be attained, namely, the service of a sesha to the Lord have all to arise in the individual; therefore the individual is the principal (figure). So some ichāryas say that the word aham (I) should be taken as anderstood and as being the substantive to which the m (which means the jiva) is the adjective &ldquo;I who am a jiva&rdquo;. In that case, as stated also in slokas wbich elaborate the pranava, &ldquo;Whatever is mine and I myself are Tbine, O Lord, Madhava! I am well aware of this &ldquo;; since attributes always follow the princi. pal (or the substantive), the qualities and attributes are also intend ed by implication (upalakshana), (2) Other acharyas hold that the third letter itself (w) shows the aham (or I) by dropping, in the word (asmat=I) of the first part as and the latter part at and retaining only the consonant in the middle, in accordance with Vedic usage. Ia Nyasa vidyā (as described in the Taittiriya upanishad) which enjoins the offering of the self as an oblation to the Supreme Being, the pranava is called the mantra (for it). In order that the action to be performed may be made clear, the actual words indicating the Supreme Self and the individual self should be expressed and not remain merely implicit. Since according to the praminas, the first letter (a) denotes the person to whom the surrender is made and the middle letter (u) has some other meaning (either only or Lakshmi), by the law of what remains (pāriseshya) the third letter (n) should indicate the oblation, namely, the individual self that is to be offered. There fore it is appropriate to hold that this (third) letter should mean (Iham (or I). Therefore it is that Bhattar commented on the pranava in Tiruixantra as follows:- &ldquo;I exist* only as the property for Bhagavad who is indicated by the letter a&rdquo;.</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NAMAS OR NAMO IN TIRUMANTRA:</p>

<p>genitive or sixth case ending, and the na (which precedes it) means negation &rsquo;no&rsquo; or &rsquo;not&rsquo;. So it is equivalent to na mama (not mine). The negation na (not) is placed first to indicate its greater importance as in the sentence drishtā Sītā** (seen was Sītā). The genitive case in ma is &amp; mark of relationship in general (sam. bandha sāmünya) and implies (bere) the particular form of relationship (that of a sesha to the s&rsquo;eshi). It is with this idea indeed that Bhattar said, &quot; I do not then exist for myself.” The idea contained in this namas which has the same purport as the only of the middle letter u in pranava&ndash;for all sentences should be considered as expressive of exclusive affirmation (avadharana) - this idea is of the greatest importance, and it is said in such slokas as the following:- &quot; The cause of samsāra (bondage) is the two letters inama (mine) and the cause of attaining the eternal Brah man is the sentence having three letters na mama (I am) not mine).&rdquo; The idea of the following sloka has also the same porport as this namas:-&ldquo;All that is crooked is the cause of samsāra; all that is straight is the cause that effects the attainment of Brahman&rdquo;. (Here the idea that we exist for Bbagavan is straight and the idea that we exist for ourselves is crooked.)</p>
<p>If it is asked “What is it that is not mine (11a mama)?&rdquo;, the answer is found supplied by the context (anushanga) viz., the third letter in prunava and is as follows :</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not belong to myself&rdquo;. In the chapter on * uushang« (The Context) it is evident that the meaning indicated by the context (anushanga) is more appropriate than the peaning arrived at by the insertion of a new word (adhyāhüra).- Here na mama aham &ldquo;I am not mide&rdquo; specifies that I am not mine. As the</p>
<p>(*NOTE: Namas. Advaitins might say that the ma is in the ablative or fifth case meaning &ldquo;thao I&rdquo; (There is nothing other than I) and if we con sider that the word kinchir is understood and insert it, na ma&rsquo; may mean &ldquo;There is nothing else other than l&rdquo;. Here the word kinchit has to be understood (adhyahara) which is not so appropriate, as anushanga ). 36. Ramayana: Bala Kanda: 1-78 38. Mahabharata : Santi parva -</p>

<p>MEANING OF NAMO</p>
<p>865</p>
<p>middle letter (in pranava ) pamely only, has already stated that I exist only for Iswara, which negates seshatva to others, this specification in namas indicates that in others oneself is also incla. ded. By the principle illustrated in f go-balīvarda (the specifics. tion is to show the negation of oneself in special as not having been included in the others&rsquo; stated in the middle letter).</p>
<p>Aham na inanna (&ldquo;I am not mine&rdquo;) is the sentence in namas. From this it becoms clear that even one&rsquo;s svarüpa (essential nature) does not belong to oneself. Since attributes and qualities always follow the principal or substantive, it is tantamount to saying, specially, that one is not the unconditioned master of any. thing (belonging to one). This is the purpose of the specification,</p>
<p>If we do not take the word aham from the context (anu. shanga) and accept the interpretation given above, it would mean that the general misapprehension that certain things (for example, our body and our qualities) really belong to us will be taken away from one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>Thus namas dispels one&rsquo;s conceit (abhimana) about oneself and about those wbich appear to be one&rsquo;s by stating that they do not belong to one and the root causes of samsāra, namely the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine&rsquo; which are false, are thereby removed. The conceit (ahamkiira) which is thus removed is a form of illu. sory knowledge. The word ahamkāra is used also to mean one of the twenty-four reals (tattras), but that ahamkrira is not capable of being removed by mere intelligence. It persists with the jīva until its separation from the subtle body (sīkshma sarira). Though this connection with the non-sentient tattva (real) called ahatkāra continues to exist, its effects in the form of the disease of conceit (abhimana) and the like which are illusory are cured by medicine in the forın of discrimination (viveka) resulting from such things as the moolamantra.</p>

<p>NOTE! ( Though the Sanskrit word Go would include &ldquo;bull&rdquo; yet the pharse go and bull is often used to emphasise bull and draw special attention to</p>
<p>366 CHAPTER</p>
<p>Since, from the middle letter of pranava, the notion that one is s&rsquo;esha to any other than the Lord is got rid of, there is no need to state separately that one is not sesha to oneself. Therefore the porport may also be to show that the person to whom certain things appear to be s&rsquo;esha and who appears to be s&rsquo;eshi is pot the unconditioned master or s&rsquo;eshi of any of these things. All those things that are s&rsquo;esha to the jīva (like his body, bis attributes, bis wealth etc.) are indeed those that were given to bim for His own purposes by the Supreme: Ruler, who is the s&rsquo;eshi of all.</p>
<p>Those qualities and the like of the jīvas which are eternal have become theirs by the eternal will of Iswara. The transitory bodies and the like which are theirs in the impure state (samsāra) and in the pure state (after mukti when they might take bodies for some parpose or other)&ndash;these result from the transitory will of Iswara as the effect of past karma (in the case of the former) and without any relation to karnia (in the case of the latter).</p>
<p>The pranava states that the jīva is sesha to none other than Bhagavan). So it becomes evident that he is not sesha even to himself as he is other than Bhagavan; it follows from this that, in the same way as he is s&rsquo;esha to nobody else (than Bhagavan), no other thing is unconditionally s&rsquo;esha to him. This does not appear in the pranava. Therefore this may be the purport of the nanas that the jiva is in no way independent li.e.) that he has no svītail tryam). In that case, taking froid the context (anushangu) the 11 in praiata, it would give the meaning &ldquo;I am not capable of maintaining or looking after myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also possible to understaod (adhyāhara), the word sviita ntrya (independence) after sa mnamu. It would then read na mama svātantryan (I have no independence). The absence of independence in the case of the sentient being is the inability to act independently (of the Lord) (i.c.) without His help. This is because, though in the state of bondage and in the state of release, be acts in accordance with his own mind, he can act only</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>MEANING OF NAMO</p>
<p>867</p>
<p>with such things as the senses given by Iswara and by His stimu. lation and with His help.</p>
<p>The protectorship of all, indicated by the base (prakriti) (viz) a in the first letter of pranava, ensues, in the case of those who adopt an upaya, only by stimulating them to the adoption of any one of the upāyas. Though the jiva adopts the upāya, since his activity is dependent on the Lord and since the one who affords protection by granting the fruit (of the upāya) is the Supreme Ruler who is gracious, it is only His protectorship of all indicated in the base of the first letter (of pranava) that is confirmed by this namas. Similarly Iswara&rsquo;s being the anconditional s&rsquo;eshi of all which is stated by the dative case (fourth case) of the first letter &amp; in the pranava (where the case ending has been dropped) &ndash; this is confirmed by the interpretation suggested before, which denies unconditioned seshitvain to the jīva. As declared in the Brahma Sutra (2-3-40), “The doership of the jīva is due to the Supreme Being as stated in the Sruti &ldquo;, the independence that the jiva seems to possess is granted to him in the execution of His own purposes by the Supreme Being who is the unconditioned s&rsquo;eshi of all. The jiva&rsquo;s being seshi to other things is also due to its being given to him by the voconditioned seshi for the fulfilment of His own purposes. To sum up SANSKRIT SLOKAS:~</p>
<p>The Lord of Sri is (alone) independent in all things and is (alune) the Master (of all) without being dependent on any one else. Independence without any dependence for help on others and mastership belong to no one else.</p>
<p>This gist of the pranava and of the namas has been taught to us by (our) üchāryas, in order that we may have the competence (for prapatti), namely, such as having the Lord alone as our refuge.</p>
<p>In ordinary life, being master over others and being inde pendent of others are considered desirable, and being &amp; servant and</p>
<p>368 CHAPTER</p>
<p>being dependent on others are considered undesirable. This is merely due to past karma as a conditioning factor (upādhi). But here (in spiritual life), being a servant (of the Lord) and being dependent (on the Lord) are agreeable to those who have a know. ledge of the truth, for they are appropriate and natural to our svarīpa (essential nature), as stated in such passages as the following: &ldquo;We are all, by 40% nature, His servants&rdquo;. Thus it becomes evident that the jīva exists solely for another (Iswara) and is entirely dependent on Him. So the jiva may rightly be en. ployed to do what is pleasing to the s&rsquo;eshi, who alone is independent (and omnipotent). Therefore it follows that the jiva should be s&rsquo;esha (and render service) to His devotees, as stated in the Tamil verse) ;-&rdquo; The Lord.&rdquo; who is absolutely pure, has made ine the servant of His servants&rdquo;. If the Lord who is the s&rsquo;eshi, and who is independent (and all powerful) is pleased to make us seshas to His good devotees, it cannot be called improper or inappropriate; nor can it be avoided (or resisted). Since He is s&rsquo;eshi, He has a right to employ us in whatever He desires, and since He is all powerful, He can enforce it. This idea may also be seen in the</p>
<p>Tamil) verse :- &ldquo;I will never&rdquo; associate with those who think that there is any deity other than Thee. But gladly do I accept (the privilege of) being servant to Thy devotees.&quot;</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKAS :</p>
<p>Being sesha to His devotees results to the Supreme Ruler from His own desire; but to us, it is a consequence of our being dependent on Him. (Sometimes) even to us, it may come as a consequence of our own desire, for to one who appreciates the worth of (virtuous) qualities, a desire to serve may arise towards those who are great by their virtues. Thus) service may be done owing to an appreciation of (noble) qualities, like the service of Lakshmada to Sri Rama. The omnipotent Lord has Himself</p>

<p>said. &ldquo;I *render service to those who are my kinsmen by virtue of my beiog independent. I give one half (of what I have) to my kinsfolk and enjoy the other half. I forgive also harsh words (employed) by them towards me &ldquo;. Thus by virtue of these words of His, He has willed that we should be s&rsquo;eshas to Himself and to His devotees. It has already been shown in the chapter on the extreme limit of the ultimate goal of life) that the service rendered as s&rsquo;eshas by the devotees to one another is due to the will of the omni-potent Lord and is appropriate in different ways (in exalting others and in being exalted by them).</p>
<p>Since the jīva who is thus (akinchana) destitute (of any upāyas) has to receive the desired object from the independent s&rsquo;eshi in accordance with His will, the prayer for protection (saranavaranam) which is explicitly stated in Dvaya and the Charama sloka for winning His favour is necessary and it is here implicit, in nanas of the Tirumantra. Since the surrender of the self and the prayer for protection are inseparable, the word which denotes either denotes also the other and is intended to express both. The word namas is itself (often) employed to stand for the prayer for protection, as may be seen from the following silokas: &ldquo;The deity:42A with eyes broad like lotuses that was seen by me before - He has now become (incarnate as) yoar relative vis. Janardapa, the tiger among men&rdquo;. &ldquo;Madhava&rdquo; is both the father and the mother of the whole world. Seek His protection, O best among men, for He is capable of protecting (you).&rdquo; &quot; When Mar kandeya) gave them this advice, the tbree sons of Kunti and the twins, O best of the Bharatas, made namaskāra to Janardana along with Droupadi &ldquo;, so also in the episode of Danjayanti (we find the following); &ldquo;She considered that the time had come to scek refuge of the gods. So she made namaskiira with (all) her speech and (all) her mind.&rdquo; (Since namas has been used to</p>

<p>signify the prayer for protection ), it indicates that the responsi. bility for protecting oneself is not of the jiva (na mama bharah), where the word bharah (the burden of responsibility) is under. stood. Thus its purport may also be the surrender of responsi. bility. That the word namas indicates the surrender of self (atna samarpanam) is also wellknown from the following slokas : &ldquo;Of all yajnas which&rsquo;s are performed with samit and such like as an aid, the man who has surrendered his self (ātma samarpana) to Bhagavan with the word namas is said to have performed the best Yajna,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I bow to Bhagavan, for namas (bowing) or atma samarpaņam to Him enables a man to get rid of his suffering and enjoy wbatever he wants &ldquo;.</p>
<p>That the word namas has these meanings, viz., “I do not belong to myself; nor is any activity of mine s&rsquo;esha to me; all these are s&rsquo;esha only to Bhagavān,&rdquo; is stated in the section on the namaskāra in Nirukti.</p>
<p>THE THREE MEANINGS OF NAMAS:</p>
<p>Sthila, Stikshma and Para : Abirbhudhaya (Siva) commented on the word namas as having three different meanings : &amp; gross meaning (sthūlārtha) a subtle meaning (sīkshmārtha), and a supreme meaning (para), in the following slokas :</p>
<p>I. STHULĀRTHA :</p>
<p>(8) The act of an intelligent man bowing his body, of his own accord, before another who is higher (without expecting any gain fron it) is called namas. In the sastras, all sentient beings are spoken of as belonging to two classes, the higher (Jyāyān), and the lower (ajyāyān). There is no one other than these. The primary meaning of the higher being&rsquo; is He who has superior excellence both in time and (place) and in attributes. Bhagavan is present at all times and in all places and possesses also qualities that are 45. Abirbudhnaya samhita: 37 - 37. 46. Mantrarajapada: Stotram : 47. Ahirbudhnya: Samhita : 52 (2-33).</p>
<p>STHULĀRTHA OF NAMAS</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>beyond (all) measure. So He alone is the higher (Jyāyan). All sentient beings other than He are lower (ajyāyān). The relation between these two, the higher and the lower, is that He is the s&rsquo;eshi and the others (who are lower) are s&rsquo;eshas (to Him). The higher is only One; all the rest are lower and the relation between these two consists in this, that He is bowed to and that the others bow to Him. He who is bowed to is called the higher and the s&rsquo;eshi; the others who are seshas are said to be those who bow ( to him). The relation between them and Him is not on account of any gain (expected by them); this relation between the higher and the lower is due to their nature, when the sentient being bows to the Higher Person without expecting any gain and with a certain feeling; that feeling is called nanana ( bowing) (b) Namanam (bowing ) consists in the thought: &ldquo;Bhagavan is always my seshī and I am always his s&rsquo;esha,&rdquo; for it is this thought that is the cause of the bowing (of the body). This howing makes Bhagavan bend in favour to the man who bows (i.c.) it makes Bhagavan grant to the man who bows whatever is desired by him. This is certain. Bhagavan, who is higher, observes the bowing of the man who is lower and bends (is inclined) (to do him grace). Since it makes Bhagavan bend in favour, this action is called namas: (c) Uttering the word namas with speech, having this namas in mind and bowing with the body&ndash;this is namas in its perfection (saramāgati) and what is different from it in being defective in one or other of the three aspects is called defective namas. This is perfect prapatti (as aingi).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you its accessories or angas in their perfection : Listen. &ldquo;The prapatti that I perform to Bhagavan, the Supreme Being, is itself my eternal fruit. I desire no other fruit.&rdquo; To have this (thought) is the best of accessories (angas). The desire for (other) fruit or gain is opposed to this anga. Ākinchanya or being destitute is the condition of being without the knowledge or the ability to perform bhakti. This state of destitution is due to false notions (vāsanas) that have been persisting in the mind from beginningless time and to the man&rsquo;s being by nature without</p>
<p>372 OB APTER</p>
<p>independence. It is due also to the mind being covered by the impurities of desire and hatred (rāga and dvesha). The external manifestation of this teeling of helplessness is called kārparyam and it is the second anga. The thought that one is independent and could act of one&rsquo;s own accord is opposed to this. The third anga is the thought that, though Bhagavan is the Supreme Being, He is merciful to all creatures and is ever bent on showing His grace to them. This is called mahavis&rsquo;vāsa or intense faith and the thought that Bhagavan will reward or pupish according to one&rsquo;s karma and will (therefore) be iodifferent towards one-this thought is opposed to intense faith. The fourth anga is the thought that Bhagavan is all-powerful and can protect us and the prayer (result. ing from it) for protection. This would arise if we give up the thought that Bhagavan, though merciful, is wanting in the ability to protect us. The obstacle to this anga is the thought that He would be indifferent to us as He is without the quality of goodness. The fifth anga is called the avoidance of what is disagreeable (to Bhagavan). It consists in avoiding actions which would be against the will of the Master, Tbe obstacle to this is doiog what is for bidden in the s&rsquo;āstras. The sixth anga is the determination to do good to all creatures in as much as all creatures-both those that nove and those that do not move&ndash;are His body. Doing what is harmful to them is opposed to this. Thus have I explained to you nanana (or s&rsquo;aranāgati) which consists of the angas and the upāngas&rdquo;, which mean avoiding what is opposed to them. This is the gross (sthila) meaniog of the word namas.</p>
<p>II. THE SUBTLE MEANING - SÖKSHMĀRTHA:</p>
<p>Learn (now) the subtle meaning - (sīkshmārtha). Whenever the sentient being considers himself and what is connected with him as his own, the two letters ma, and ma in mama (mine) sigoify the notion of mine&rsquo; or mamakāra. The thought regarding oneself and those things that are connected with</p>
<p>(* NOTE: Angas are accessorics, upangas are those that are accessories to angas: berc the avoidance of what is opposed to the respective angas).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>SUKSHMARTHA AND PARARTHA</p>
<p>373</p>
<p>one that one is independent and that these things belong to oneself - this thought has arisen from the false notion which has grown in strength owing to wrong impressions (vāsanas) which are from time immemorial (beginningless ), This notion can be countered by the right thought viz., me na ( These are not mine). The meaning of me na is, “I am not independent. I am not sesha to myself (but to God). (My) body and other things are not nine; they are seshas to the Supreme Being.&rdquo; By this right understanding, those false thoughts that they belong to oneself disappear, Owing to those false thoughts that have acisen from false impressions (vāsanas ), which are from time immemorial (anadi) and which have grown in strength by notions opposed to the true nature of things, (we think as follows ):- &ldquo;I am inde. pendent: these things are mine.&rdquo; This thought is got rid of by the word namas uttered by tho man performing prapatti with the right understanding that Bhagavan (Vishnu) is the inner self or soul of all. Thus has the subtle meaning been explained,</p>
<p>III. THE SUPREME MEANING: (parārtha):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen now to the supreme meaning (para), which is differ ent (from what has been said before). The syllable na indicates the upāya (or endeavour): ma indicates that it is principal or all - important and the visarga (fipal aspirate) vis., S (in namas) means Bhagavan. This is the meaning obtained from that word (namas):-&ldquo;In order to attain Bhagavan, who is eternal and who is the highest ruler, who is omnipotent and is called Purushottama - (in order to attain Him), Bhagavan is Himself the principal means called ramana, Thus have I explained to you the three meanings of namas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo; Since, in the above, it is stated that only the Sapreme Seshi should be bowed to or sought as refuge, it is evident and appropriate that the Being to whom namas is due is the Supreme Seshi. In order to make it clear who this Supreme Seshī is, the specific Dame (Bhagavan) is given. In one of the slokas quoted before,374 CHAPTER</p>
<p>it is said, &ldquo;Doing what is forbidden by the sāstras is opposed to this (avoiding what is disagreeable to Him)&rdquo;, and so also &ldquo;Doing evil to other creatures is opposed to this doing what is pleasing to Him). The gist of these sentences is that, if at the time of per. forming prapatti, there occurs an act which is deliberate and is disagreeable (to the Lord), there are absent the determination to do what is pleasing (to Him) and also such things as the abstinence in thought from doing what is disagreeable (to Him). If, after the performance of prapatti, the man deliberately does what is dis. agreeable (to Him), he acts in a manner which is opposed to the command of Bhagavan, whom he sought with eagerness (while performing prapatti).</p>
<p>In the slokas cited above, the gross meaning (sthūlārtha) is that which appears obvious from etymological derivation according to grammar. The subtle meaning (sūkshmārtha) is that which appears from interpretation based on the similarity of syllables on the strength of Nirukta. The supreme meaning (parārtha) is that which is explained in the secret sāstras (i.c.) sāstras which comment on the meaning of the secret mantras) with the help of the conventions regarding the meaning of letters. (In the slokas cited above), in the first (sthilartha) interpretation, the behaviour which is inherent by nature to the s&rsquo;esha (namely, namana) and the structure or constitution of sūdhyopāya with its angas, are explained. Then, in the second, they clarify the svarūpy of the jiva, as this is essential to the aspirant to mukti who adopts the upāya, namely, that he has no unconditional independence. Then in the third (i.e.) para, the slokas indicate the nature of siddhopāya (Bhagavan), who can be won by the adoption of the particular sādhyopāya and who is also the object to be attained. It may also be understood as stating that surrender (of self) is more important&rsquo; than all other upayas. All these are to be understood in their proper places where the ten different interpretations are given later on.</p>
<p>MEANING OF NARAYANA</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKAS:&ndash;</p>
<p>All the mantras that are combined with the word namas with its various meanings as stated above become operative mantras to be einployed while surrendering one&rsquo;s self. The ma in praķava and in the namas lead to the consideration of one&rsquo;s self either by reference to the Jiva as a genus (Jāti) including one, or by reference to &lsquo;I&rsquo; directly which is like catching hold of the horns (ic) (by pointing to what is essential and all-important). Since the consideration that has been pointed out in regard to one, applies equally to others as well, there is no question of any one being the Saviour of any other. Therefore since all creatures are dependent (on another) in the matter of protecting themselves and protecting others, protectorship not dependent on others is vested only in the Lord of Kamala (Lakshmi)</p>
<p>THE WORD NĪRĪVĀŅA IN TIRUMANTRA:</p>
<p>The word Noirii yana here (in Tirumantra) explains (in full), hy its conventional usage and by its etymology, the unconditional Saviour who appears in the first letter (of the pranava) as the Protector of all and as the s&rsquo;eshi of all. His grace is to be obtained by means of the siidhyopaya called saraṇāgati (seeking protection or refuge of the Lord), wbicb is seen either implicitly or explicitly in the word namas. He is to be the recipient of the service rendered by the prapannu, which is implicit in the dative (fourth) case ( of the word Narayana) (i.e.) Nürüyanya.</p>
<p>Explanation or elaboration is the clarification of what has been briefly stated before in another mander, so that there may be no ignorance, doubt or misconception (about its meaning). This explanation may be seen wherever it occurs [/i.e.) the meaning hinted at in the first letter a (of pranava) is explained in the word Nārāyana and the meaning of m in pranava is explained in</p>
<p>the word Nara and 80 oD).</p>
<p>376 CHAPTER</p>
<p>This word, Nārāyana, which is of great help in showing clearly the two tattvas, namely, the sesha and the s&rsquo;eshi finds the first place, in the Vishnugāyatri and in the Tiruuiriyarīyam, where certain names are commented upon before other vyāpaka names of Bhagavan.</p>
<p>[ NOTE:-Vishnugayatri: Narayanaya vidinahe; Vasudeva ya dhimahi, Tanno Vishnuh prachodayar,]</p>
<p>(Narayana, Vasudeva and Vishnu are called vyapaka names because their etymology indicates that the one referred to by them is present everyo: where).</p>
<p>In the Nārāyaṇānuvāka which aims at determining the person of the Supreme Deity, who is the object of meditation in all vidyās, the word Nārāyaṇa is repeated ipany tirpes, thus showing great regard, for the purpose of declaring that Brahma, Siva and others, who might, on first thought, be considered as the Supreme Deity, on the strength of the presence of their names in. the vidyas are only the ribhūtis (or glorious possessions) of Nari yana just like the universe (which attests His glory). This it does by stating them in *grammatical co-ordination or apposition with Narayana (sāmānādhikaranyam).</p>
<p>It declares that even these, (Brahma, Siva and others) are included in the meaning of Nāra (the first part of the compound) and that Narayana is their resting place or refuge.</p>
<p>The potency of this name is well-known from the following passages: &ldquo;Those who are afraid of sanisāra and who suffer from terrible viseases are relieved of their sufferings by merely uttering the word Nārāyaṇa, and attain lappiness”. “The mano in whose mouth is the auspicious word, Narayana, is followed by</p>
<p>(* NOTE:-Grammatical co-ordination: The following sentences in the Narayananuvaka arc referred to here: “ This universe is all the deity Narayana: He is the inner self of the universe: Narayana is the Supreme Jyotis (Light): The Supreme Being is Narayana: Narayana is the Supreme Brahmap: Nara yana is the Supreme Tarrva (Reality)&hellip;&hellip;. He is Brahma: He is Siva: He is Indra : He is Akshara and He is the Supreme Independent Sovereign Ruler&rdquo;). 48. Vyasa Sanjaya samvada :</p>

<p>MEANING OF NARAYANA</p>

<p>Narayana even as the calf is followed by the cow.&rdquo; &quot; The word SO Narayana is always available. Oar speech is within our control. Notwithstanding this, the jivas fall into the darkest hell by not utteriog the word&rdquo;: &quot; The name, Narayana, confers (on the man who utters it) good birth in a Vaishnavite family: it confers also wealth.” “The mother 6 who gives the name, Narayana, to her son will never go to hell.&rdquo; In the Nāradīya kalpa it is said: &quot; Even those who atter the mere word, Narayana, are relieved of their diseases, of their dangers, of their fears and of their sorrows. There is no doubt of this.&rdquo; In another purāņa it is stated that if the number of vowels and consonants (in the word, Narayana ) be taken separately into account, it will (be seen to) resemble Tiru. mantra in having eight letters and may be treated as such.</p>
<p>The compound word Nārāyana may be split up into its two component parts thus: Nārāh ayanan yasya (He to whom Nārās are the resting place ) and Nārāņām ayanam (the resting place of Nārās). The word Nārās is here determinate in meaning and denotes only the nārās (sentient beings and non-sentient things) and does not refer also to the Lord who is their inter self. Therefore the two words are not in grammatical apposition. Nam malvar distinctly showed the meanings of these two ways of combining the two parts of the word (samāsa) in the following two passages by using the word at the end and at the beginning respectively. &ldquo;He who has, as His s&rsquo;eshas,&rdquo; countless jivas with koowledge and bliss as their attributes and with self-luminousness as their nature and also His own poble qualities&ndash;that Narayana,&quot; and &quot; Narayana&quot; is the Lord of all the seven worlds&quot;.

It should be borne in mind that this nārās includes the queen, the ornaments, the weapons, the attendants, the furniture and the like, the door-keepers, the retinue and such others.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKAS:</p>
<p>In the word Narayana, are contained all the attributes (of Brahman) which are established in the four chapters) of the Sarīraka Sastra:(Brahma sātras), namely, His being the cause of the Universe, the irrefutability of the proposition that He is the cause, His being the upaya for the attainment of mukti and His being the object of attainment (in mukti). All this has been explained by Bhattar in His Nitya in the words beginning with &ldquo;Knowledge, bliss, purity and the like.”</p>
<p>THE MEANING OF NĀRĀS:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I created the waters, which are called sārās, and lay withia them. Therefore am I called Narayana.&rdquo; &ldquo;The waters are called Nārās because they were born of Nara (i. e. Bhagavan). They were at first His abode. Therefore is He called Narayana.&rdquo; In these two slokas, the waters refer by implication (upalakshana) to the other tattvas (reals) as well. This is evident from such passages as the following :- &ldquo;The stattvas or reals had all their origin from Nara. Therefore are they known as Nāriis. To Him they are the abode, therefore is He considered to be Narayana.&rdquo; In this interpretation of the word as a grain matical compound Bahn vrihi samāsa ( Nārüh ayanan yasya), it is stated that the tattvas had their origin from Nara and are therefore called nrārüs. From this it follows that, as stated in Mahopanishad and elsewbere, Narayana is the cause of all (things and beings ) including Brahma and Isana ( Siva) in every way (i. e. the material cause aod the instrumental cause). The word ayana (resting place ) is derived</p>

<p>MEANING OF NARAYANA</p>

<p>in this way:-I yate iti&rsquo; ayanam&rsquo;. That which is pervaded is ayana (the passive voice being used for deriving the word). This declares that He pervades all, as they are all pervaded by him and that in order that He may do so, He has unparallelled subtleness (stikshmatva). Ayana may be derived also in another way: Iyate asmin iti : (That in which it is), in which case it would mean tbat in which everything rests. The word Narayana may be considered also as a compound of the tatpurusha type (tatpurusha samāsa), in which case it would be split into Narāņam and. ayanaın (the abode of Nārās ). It is true that the compound word should then be in the neuter gender Nārāyaṇam, but by the auth ority of nirukti, the masculine form Nārāyanah is not improper. The pramanas are the following :-&ldquo;He is also 58called Narayana, for He is the resting place or abode of Narās&rdquo;. &ldquo;The multitude of all jivas is called Nārās. Since Bhagavan is to be attained by them and is also the upāya for attaining Him, He is called Nara yana&rdquo;. &ldquo;Nāra is so called because it means the multitude of jīvas which are indicated by the word nara. I am the goal to be attained by them; I am also the upāya for that attainment. Therefore am I called Nārāyaṇa by the seers.&rdquo; &ldquo;The 6 wise call the multitude of jīvas by the name Nāra. He is called Narayana because He is their ayana (abode or resting place). Therefore those who are thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedanta declare Him to be the kinsman, the mother, the father, the guru and the abode or resting place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD NARA:</p>
<p>The verbal root in means &rsquo;to perish&rsquo;; so ra (in nara) deno es pon-sentient things (i.e.) matter which perishes (i. e.) changes its essential nature (svartipa). Nara therefore, denotes those that do not perish or change their essential nature (i. c.) chetanas (sentient beings, using the na samāsa on the analogy of words like Naga - which means .mountain&rsquo;, for it does not (na) go</p>

<p>380 CHAPTER</p>
<p>or move (ga) and naika, na-eka &quot; pot one&rdquo; (1. c.) many&rsquo;. So Nara means sentient beings only; nāra means the multitude of naras. Their ayanan (abode or resting place) is Narayana. This declares that He who has under His control the three kinds of chetanas or sentient beings (the bound, the released and the eternal) and also nonsentient things, their essential nature (or existence) their sustenance, and their activity&ndash;He is, to the three kinds of multitudinous souls (the bound, the released and the eternal) who are denoted by the word nara, the Dispenser of what they desire. It says also that sioce He is blissful, He is, of Bis own accord, the upeya (i. e.) the object of attainment and is also the support or resting place (adhāra), for it is said, “ Thus basei it been explained how the three worlds have Vishnu as the adhara (resting place or abode)” and “He 61A has entered into the three lokas, viz. the non-sentient, the sentient and the released souls and supports thern without andergoing any change.&quot;</p>
<p>How these meanings are traceable in the word ayana will now be explained :- The word a yana may be derived from the verbal root in (which means to go), in three ways: (1) īyate anena iti ayana). Ayana is that by which or with which one goes, where it refers to the instrument (karana) or aid. ( When derived in this way) Iswara becomes the upāya or means (2) iyate asau iti ayana) &ldquo;That which is reached. In this derivation Iswara becomes the upeya or object that is reacbed or attained: (3) īyato asmin iti a gana): &ldquo;that in which it rests.&rdquo; In this derivation Iswara becomes the support or ādhāra on which everything reste. Ayana may also be derived from the verbal root «y, which means &ldquo;to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is evident that Iswara has in Hin the qualities necessary for being the upāya, the upeya and the like, vie., easy accessibility (saulabhyam) and being supreme (paratvam). When ayana means &lsquo;abode&rsquo;, if we take Nārāyana to be a bahuvrihi compound ( Nārāh Ayanam Yasya) (He whose abode is Nārās ), it is consi.</p>

<p>MEANING OF NARAYANA</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>dered to indicate that Narayan&amp; pervades all things and beings within thein (i, e.) that He is jminanent within them. If we take Nārāyana to be a tatpurusha compound (Nārāņam ayananı: the abode of Nārās, the (compound) word indicates that He pervades them froin withont (they being withio Him (i.c.) that He is transcendent. These two are declared in the s&rsquo;rutis (i, e) in Nārāyaṇānīvikam) Immanence (or antarvyāpti) mends being present inseparably connected with other things and beings in such a way that it cannot be said that He is not present where they are: Traoscendence (bahiruyapti) means being present also in places where they are not present. Such things as Tine ( Kala) are omnipresent (vibli). So it should not be stated that Iswara is outside of them. When it is said &ldquo;Narayana who is smaller (aiyiin) than all the smallest: the meaning of the word (i!!u is not &lsquo;of small size&rsquo; but subtle&rsquo;. So the passage really means: “Narayana who is subtler than all the subtle things &ldquo;. It means that owing to His being subtle pothing can prevent Him from being within then,</p>
<p>In the sruli ( which says “ He is smaller than the grain called s&rsquo;yāmāka), the purport is that He is of the size of the object within Which He is present (i.c.) of the measure of the upādhi or conditioning factor, and this is distinctly stated in the Brahma sūtras and their commentary (Sri Bhishyanı). Being full and complete in every object, on the part of One who is both immanent and transcendent, means that that aspect or phase of His which is within any one upidhi or conditioning factor is capable of (creat. ing, sustaining and destroying) and doing such other things to all thiogs and beiogs. It does not mean that His essential nature is all contained (and exhausted) within any one object (to the excla sion of all others). If we understand it in that sense, it would be opposed to His transcendence. If we explain this by saying that Iswara has the power of bringing together those which cannot be brought together (aghatitaghatanā sakti), it would be acceptance of the position of other systems (like Bhaskara&rsquo;s and Yadava</p>
<ol start="62">
<li>Vishnupurana: 1-9-41.</li>
</ol>
<p>382 CHAPTER</p>
<p>prakasa&rsquo;s), which maintain the possibility of bringing together things which are opposed to each other (Bhaskara and Yađava prakasa say that difference and non-difference can coexist). Here in Tirumantra, when the Supreme Ruler of all is indicated by the first letter (of pranava), the base nara of the word Nārūs and the word ayana, all these words are purposely used to indicate His being the Protector and His being the ultimate ) cause (in a), His being eternal and His being the netă (guide) (in the word nara) and His being the resting place or support and the ioner self in the word ayana) in different ways. (It should not be thought that tbese three wean the same thing and that two of them are therefore redundant).</p>
<p>If it be asked: &ldquo;While the Chetana or sentient being is already indicated by the third letter of praava (111), wby should it be mentioned again in the word Naru (in Narayana)&rdquo;. The answer is as follows: &ldquo;I do not exist without Thee, (my support); Thou dost not exist without me, (for I bring out Thy character:) &quot; &ldquo;Rama&rsquo;s younger brother (Lakshmana), and Lakshmana&rsquo;s elder brother&rdquo;. (In the two passages mentioned above, there is apparent repetition, but it is not a fault since it serves &amp; definite purpose). (In the first passage ), the first part of the sentence emphasises the importance of the Seshi and the second emphasises the importance of the s&rsquo;esha; so also (in the secodd. passage ) Rama&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in Ramanuja (Rama&rsquo;s younger brother) and Laksh. inapa&rsquo;s importance is hinted at in Lakshmanapirvaja (Laksh. mapa&rsquo;s elder brother): Thus each is characterised by the other. In the pranava, the s&rsquo;eshie&rsquo;s inportance is proininent as in the chariot of Arjuna ( where Arjuna is prominent and Sri Krishna is not, being only the charioteer ); in the word Narayana, the s&rsquo;eshi&rsquo;s importance is prominent as in the Rosamundala (the Rusakridii described in the Bhigavatam), where Sri Krishna is all-important and the Gopis not so.</p>
<p>Even in the praat, though verbally the jīva is proibinent, the prominence, so far as the purport is considered, is of the Protector or Saviour.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF NARAYANA</p>
<p>383</p>
<p>The jiva who appears in the pranava as of the form (ākāra) of jnana, both in his essential nature and in his attribute, and also as being atomic (aņı), is described in the word Nara as eternal (without change or deterioration.) Further since Narāh means &rsquo;the multitude of naras&rsquo;, it makes clear the fact of the jīvas being different from one another. If (on the other hand) we take the word Nārüh to rean those who have their origin from Nara (Bhagavan ), it indicates that the jivas have Brahman for their cause (in so-far as their embodiment is concerned). Owing to these additional meanings appearing in the word (Narayana), the two&rsquo; words serve a purpose ( and are not redundant).</p>
<p>(When the word Nāriyana is taken as a bahuvrihi compound which can be split into Nārāh ayanam yasya), the word ayana is in grammatical co-ordination with Nārāh. By the word ayana, such ideas as their (nārāh) being pervaded by Bhagavan are to be understood. The meaning of the s&rsquo;ruti *63A that in regard to many chetanas who are eternal, one Chetana who is eternal is the cause of their attaining the desired objects&ndash;this meaning may also be seep here.</p>
<p>It is true that the jiva is, according to the pramūnas, eternal. When he was described before as taking his origin from Brahman, what was meant was that, in respect of bis body which is his attribute, the origin was from Brahman (but not his essential nature, which is eternal.)</p>
<p>The other interpretations which are given in kalpas like Vārdyanitmaku are also similar to these.</p>
<p>In the sloka :&ndash; “Both sentientó beings and non-sentient things whicb are all different from Vishnu are called Nāram. He who has tūran as His «tyanan (abode or resting place) is Nara yana&rdquo; (in the light of this sloka) what was stated before (in Pūdmottaram), viz., Nārāh is the collection of all persons&rdquo; should</p>
<p>63A. * Katopanishad: II-5-13</p>
<p>64.384 CHAPTER</p>
<p>be taken in a wider sense (upalakshana) to include also the collection of all tattvas (non-sentiept included). Because even nod-septient matter is not perishable in its essential nature (svarīpa) and also owing to the continuity (pravāha) of the different states (avasthās) into which it changes, (even) non. sentient matter is eternal. Nārāh means therefore by implication (upalakshana) all the tattvas which are eternal and wbich are denoted by the word Nara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nara means also Nārāyana for the following reasons : (1) While pervading all (beings and things), He (i. e.) Narayana is na ra (one who does not change or deteriorate), for He is not tainted by the faults or impurities in them and by the sufferings which might be caused by them; (2) the verbal root nr means &quot; to lead&rdquo;: He who leads (souls) is Nara : (3) In the Sahasra. nāma, Jahon, Narayana and Nara are said to be the names of Bhagavan : (4) In the passage, &ldquo;The waters are the sons of Nara, the word Nara indicates oply Narayana and this is evident from the sentence in Vyasasmriti :&ndash; &ldquo;The waters took their origin from Narayana and they alone became afterwards His ayana or resting place&rdquo;. So the eternal and Supreme Ruler who leads all (to Himself ) is called by the name Nara.</p>
<p>In the Ahirbudhnyasamhita (we find the following slokas : “Those that are related to nara are nārāh. That nara is Puru shottama. It is He that confers knowledge on those that have sought His protection. It is He that dispels all (their) ignorance. Wherever He may be, He does not updergo any change. Hence He is called Nara, because He is always the same (na ra), Sentient beings and non-sentient things that are related to Him are His seshas. They are supported by Him, controlled by Him and created by Him. He has entered into them for supporting them. Therefore are they called Nārāh (because they are sup ported, created and controlled by Nara). He controls all nārās;</p>

<p>that is, by being within them, He pervades them in order to do such things as sustaining them. The nārāk are helpful (to us) in ander standing Him, for, by their existence is His existence understood. He is the ayana or abode of nārās and they are always His abode. To souls that are nārāh, He is the supreme end to be attained and also the means or upāya of attaining Him &ldquo;. This interpretation makes it clear that those attributes which define the essential nature of the Supreme Being such 48 (satyam, jnanan and irnandam) and the qualities or attributes of the essential nature so defined, such as compassion, His activities and the specific forms assumed by Him and likewise the three kinds of sentient beiogs, (the bound, the released and the eternal) and all non-sentient things — all these are meant by the word nārāk. From all this it may be inferred that He has the attribute of being the support of all except Himself. Hence it declares also that He stands by Himself and in Himself (alone). From this, the delusion maintained by men of perverted vision (Advaitins) that Purusho tama, who pervades, supports, controls and masters them and the muurās who are related to Him are identical in their essential nature-this delusion will disappear, since it is evident that He is the soul of all and that He has such glories as that of being denoted by all words.</p>
<p>The word nara (neaning . &lsquo;one who does not change&rsquo;) brings out the meaning of the clarificatory texts in the sruti (wbere Brabman is declared to be satyain, the Real that is un changing). The word nāra which means those things which bave their origin in Nara as declared in the passage : &ldquo;Those reals or tattvas that are born of Nara are called nārāk”-this word brings out the meaning of the s&rsquo;ruti that declares Brahman to be the ultimate cause of all; the word a yana brings out the meaning of the texts prescribing forms of meditation or worship (as leading to the attainment of ends desired by men).</p>
<p>Such texts as those in the Subālopanishad declare that the Supreme Being who is the inner self of all and who has all kinds</p>
<p>386 CHAPTER</p>
<p>of kinsbip (to us) is Narayana. (By this declaration) these pasf ages state that the Supreme Being is no other deity thao Narayana.</p>
<p>Those who are relatives in the world became relatives (tous) by the will of Bhagavan. “O, Best off? deities, Thou art my mother. Thou art my father: Thou art my kinsman: Tbou art my guru : Thou art my learning: Thou art my wealth. So Thou art by all &ldquo;, The Lord is moyes nuaster who is my benefactor, He is my father, ny kinsman, my king.&rdquo; &quot; Thou art the world&rsquo;s father, its mother, its beloved son, its affectionate friend, its well. wisber and its guru : Thou art the goal to be attained and also the upaya or means by which it is to be attained. I am Tbine, I am sustained by Thee. I am Thy servant. I am one who considers Thee as the highest benefit. I am one who bas per. formed prapatti to Thee. Therefore the burden of protecting me is Thine&rdquo;. The Supreme Ruler is thas one who is the upcoadi. tioned relative in every form. If He is pleased (with us), there will be no one who will be opposed to us, for it has been said :&ndash; &ldquo;He from wbose&rsquo;&rsquo; favour all these people will become favourable (to us)&ndash;that Rama is now soliciting the favour of Sugriva, the best of monkeys&rdquo;, and &ldquo;When Kesaya,&rdquo; the best of deities, who loves His devotees, is pleased, (with a man), his mind becomes clear thereby and all creatures&ndash;those that move and those that do not move become favourable to him. “When &ldquo;A Bhagavan who is the God of all gods and who controls even Brabma is gracious, all the tbree worlds becowe favourable&rdquo;. “Iswara is, by His very nature, &ldquo;the well-wisheria of all creatures &ldquo;. If He is (at any time) differ. ently disposed, it is due to the upādhi or circumstance of the chetana (or sentient being) having disobeyed His command. Even that disposition (of Iswara&rsquo;s) will change (and become favourable) by some little gesture or consideration (vyuja). Havo they not</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF THE DATIVE (HOURTH) CASE OF</p>
<p>THE WORD NĀRĀYANA (i.e.) NĀRĀYAŅĀYA:</p>
<p>We will now set forth the meanings of the fourth case such as &quot; for the sake of some one&rdquo; which will correspond with the mean ing of the sentences to be shown hereafter :</p>
<p>Considered in the obvious and ordinary way, it may be thought that the fourth case is nsed because of the word namas (which governs the fourth cuse (according to grawmar). In that view there is nothing noteworthy in the use of the dative case. This is the part of the Tirumantra which is the cause of the attainment of the fruit (desired), for it has been said: “That part of the mantra (moolamantra). wbich remains after the sixth letter counting frow namas (i.e.) a and which is after the fifteenth letter conoting the consonants of the alphabet beginning with ka li.e.) na, and leaving the consonantal part of 70- that part which remains after the ì in Nurāyanāya, (i. e.) āya, is called the potent part of that mantra.&rsquo; This part is concerned with the attainment of the fruit. According to some interpretations, the prayer for the attainment of the fruit is found here. There is no difference of opinion in regard to the statement that the meanings of a word dif. fer in accordance with the purpose, the context, the mark or sign, the propriety. the locality and the tisue of its use and not by the were word as such. One of the meanings of the fourth case that are accepted is sampradūna (ie) to make the word indicate the person to whom a thing is given and who thereby becomes its sishin. Here in the fourth case Nārāyaṇāya in Tirumantra, it is true that what does not belong to Iswara is not given to Him, for the jiva is always Narayaba&rsquo;s s&rsquo;esha and belongs to Him. So it might be thought that the sampradana which is indicated by the fourth case does</p>

</ol>
<p>388 CHAPTER</p>
<p>not apply here. But in as much as the jiva offers to Iswara what already belongs to Him for protection by Himself, it may be beld that the fourth case indicates sampradana and Ahirbudbnya (Siva) commented in this manner on the dative or fourth case in the Vyāpaka Mantras :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surrender or offer of the self whicb is shown to be subordinate or s&rsquo;esha is indicated by the fourth case in such words as Vishnu (i.e. Namo followed by Vishnu). When the qnestion is asked: &ldquo;To whom is this self wbich is subordinate offered or surrendered for the sake of protection &ldquo;, the answer is &quot; to Visbnu&rdquo;. Thus Visbou is indicated by the fourth case&rdquo;. This is a commentary also on the fourth case in words like Narayapa as the sloka says &lsquo;in such words as Visbnu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this Tirumantra, the meanings of the seven sacred letters beginping from na have been separately stated in the mantra. smritis and these meanings have been summarised as follows by some acharyas in passages like the following :- &ldquo;The meaning of na is looking after the welfare of all, helping to incline the wind (of the jiva) towards Paramapada and destroying those unworthy qualities of the self wbich are opposed to it. Since the letter ma signifies doing what is good to those who have sought (Him), helping to expand their attributive jnina (koowledge), and securing for them the respect of others : these are said to be its meanings hy those that know. The letter in signifies giving up scepticism, rendering service always to Bhagavan and doing the work of the acharya which consists in leading the sishya to Parumapadı. These benefits will, in the opinion of those that know the mantra, accrue to those that meditate on this letter. Tbose that meditate on the letter rā will acquire the love of the Lord, give ap the love of those that sre other than the Lord and protect the kingdom (from evils). By the letter ya, wise men acquire the eagerness to adopt the Yoga necessary for attaining Bbagavan and also its fruit.</p>

<p>From the letter ņā one acquires the desire to praise the Lord and the command of language necessary for praising Him. The letter ya causes dread io (the miods) of Yakshas, Rakshasas, Vethala, and goblins (bhītas). Those that kaow the mantras have thos described the function of the different letters &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Thus Tirumantra which has been rendered free from the stain arising from perverse controversialists with the help of a careful study of the interpretations derived from grammar, nirukta and the like - will, like a rairror, reveal clearly the essential nature of the Supreme Being, and also whatever is difficult to see in regard to one&rsquo;s own essential nature.</p>

<p>UPON WITH REFERENCE TO TIRUMANTRA:</p>
<p>When we reflect in accordance with the praiānas, on the essential nature of the Supreme Being, who is the deity indicated by this (mantra) in all the forms which are explicitly stated and which are also implicit in this mantru, we should reflect on the following qualities of His in principal and on other excellent traits connected with them:- such qualities as His being the protector : His protectorship being the result of His very nature: His pro. tectorship extending to all, the many ways of His protection, correspondiog to the nature of the thing to be protected, His being the protector at all times, His being the protector in all places, His protection b.ing of all kinds, His protection being directed by His own interest, the omoiscience so essential for &amp; protector, His omnipotence, the protection being irrevocable by any except His own will, the irresistibility by others of His protection, His supreme mercy, His expecting an occasion for protection, His requiring from the jiva just a pretext or vyāja for extending His protection, His accessibility to all those who have sought His help. His nature being such as may ever be relied on (for succour), His having as His attribute (Lakshmi) who will recommend the pardon of those who have committed offences (17), His being the Seshi, His beiug the Seshī under all conditions and at all times and to all,</p>

<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>(Thus) here in Tirumantra, the Lord is to be reflected upon by good men in a concise form (in the letter a) as ibe consort of Sri (Laksbmi) and as the Saviour:(in the dative or the fourth case whose affix has been dropped) as the s&rsquo;eshi, and as destitute of equals and superiors : in the word namas ) as the upaya or weaps of attaining Him: (in the word Narayuba) as the in-dwelling Self of all, (and in the fourth case of that word) as the object of atlain ment and as the Person to whom service is due.</p>
<p>THE QUALITIES OF THE JIVĀTMĀ: In the same way, when the jivatma who is to attaio the Supreme Being, which is the object of bis attaioment, reflects on himself with the help of the Tirumantra, he should note the following principal qualities of his own, which are indicated explicitly by the words themselvts and a hich lie implicit in their meaning and uther qualities connected with them, wbich are all accepted on the authority of the pramāras : &lsquo;That he has to be redeemed by Bhagavan and Sri (Lakshmi), that he cannot be saved by any one else, that he has one who will protect bini in all places, at all times, and in every manner, that he has &amp; Saviour who has noble qualities, that he has one (Lakshmi) to recommend</p>

<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>In the three words of this (Tirumantra), we should reflect, in brief, on our being entitled to be the s&rsquo;esha, of no one other than the Lord, that we bave no other upāya thao the Lord, and that we have no other end to attain than tbe Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the Tirumantra has ( as stated in Nāradiyakalpam) everything that a man ought to know. From it one can under. stand the essential nature of cit (sentiept beiogs ) acit (000-sentient matter) and Iswara, as well as the differences among the jīvas themselves. The Tirumantra also teaches the unconditional differences between the jiva (the individual self) and the Supreme Sell, as, the former is s&rsquo;esha and the latter Seshi. It determines Also the person of the Supreme Deity who is both the material and the instrumental cause of the whole universe. Therefore even those who live in the same locality as those that meditate on the Tirunantra in this mapper will never have delusions such 48.the following :- &quot; There is no Iswara or God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Iswara is attri.</p>

<p>TEN WAYS OF CONSTRUING AND INTERPRETING</p>
<p>TIRUMANTRA: We sball now copsider in what manner the Tirumantra should be considered as forming &amp; sentence or sentences and the meaning of such sentence or sentences:</p>
<p>The Tirumantra is considered as being a single sentence, as being two sentences and as beiаg three sentences, in different traditions. So also the ineanings of the sentence or sentences are reflected opon in many ways:</p>
<p>* Sec page (89). &hellip;.</p>
<p>TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>397</p>
<p>ONE SENTENCE-INDICATING UPAYA.</p>
<p>(1) When it is looked upon as a single sentence, the con nection of words is to this effect :-&rdquo; Adoration to Narayapa wbogo nature is such as can be ascertained from the pranava (aum), for it has been said: &ldquo;Prasava&rdquo; is the word that denotes Bhaga van.&rdquo; (It is true that) the praava itself is the name of Bhagavan, but there is no repetition or redundancy in another name being used, viz,, Narayana, for, as stated in Sandilya Smriti and the like, the aum (or pranava) is not of much avail, because its meaning by itself is not definite&rdquo;. Therefore, in the Vyāpaka mantras, the other pawe is for the purpose of indicating the particular (deity). This way of construing the sentence, when considered in the light of the gross interpretation described in such places as the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (see before) will make it (Tirumantra) appear as indicating the upāya. However the essential nature (of the jīva) and the supreme goal of life are also implicit in it (for, without a knowledge of them, no upāya can be adopted). ONE SENTENCE INDICATING KAINKARYA.</p>
<p>(2) Considering such passages as &quot; (They) fold&rdquo; their hands together (in anjali) and with great delight atter the word namas&rdquo;. the mantra is held also as indicating the activity of the s&rsquo;esha, namely, service, which is included in the supreme experience of Bhagavan in moksha. This form of service must (necessarily) be preceded by a reflection on (one&rsquo;s) essential nature or &ldquo;svaripa * (i. e.) that of being a s&rsquo;esha to the Lord. This can be made use of also by those who have adopted the upāya (prapatti), even in their present state, when they can realise the happiness (of tbat service to tue Lord). TWO SENTENCES INDICATING SVAROPA:</p>
<p>(3) When these two ideas become well-established, it is necesary to have a clear and distinctive knowledge of one&rsquo;s essential 76. Patanjali: Yogasutras: I-1-27 77. Sandilya Spariti: 5-71 78. Mahabharata: Santi Parva: 344. 45.</p>

<p>nature. For that purpose, the Tirumantra may be looked upon as being two sentences (a) a Nārāyanāya um - (b) namas (or na mama) meaning (a) &ldquo;I am the unconditional sesha of Bhagavan alone who is indicated by the letter a (in aum) and who has such attributes as being the universal Redeemer and the support of all and (I am the sesha) of no other. (b) I do not belong to myself, neither am I the unconditional master of anything oor have I any (absolute or unconditioned) independence. If it be asked &quot; Will there not be reduod sacy owing to the letter a and the word Nārāyana being both the names of Bhagavan? The answer is (as follows):&ndash; In that case one of the two should be considered as An adjective to the other) for the purpose of indicating the special qualities (such as protectorship) contained in its etymological interpretation. The redaadaacy would also cease if we construe the sentence into &quot; (I am the sesha) of Narayana who is denoted by the letter a in (aum)&rdquo;. Do we not see the word &lsquo;Bhayavan&rsquo;, which is His name, being employed in apposition or grammatical co-ordination (stim.inidhikara ?ya) with the word · Vasudeva! (in the Vasudeva mantra )? There is no redundance, as the word Narayana serves a purpose, being used for removing all doubts as to which deity is the ultimate universal cause deaoted by the letter wbich is the origin of all letters (namely a ). The order of words in a sentence is depeаdent on the ways in which they are recited (according to tradition); but the construction or syotactical con. nection of the words is in accordance with the meaning.</p>
<p>When thus taken as two sentences, the whole of the Tiru. mantra is descriptive of the essential nature (svarīpa) of the jiva. In the light of this coustruction, oamely, that of describing the essential nature, the ancients used to say: &ldquo;Be born in Tiru. mantra, grow up in Duaya and stand firm in Dvaya alone&rdquo;. * Birtb&rsquo; is due to the birth of a kaowledge of one&rsquo;s essential nature and the disappearance of the state wbich preceded it. This may be seen (from the verse): “Before I had a knowledge of</p>

<p>TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>my essential nature, I was like one unborn. After attaining that knowledge, I was born and I do not forget this&rdquo;. That is acknow. ledging, of one&rsquo;s own accord, that one is the sesha of no one other than Bhagavan, that one is not subject to the will of any one other than Bhagavan tbat, consequently, one has no other interests than being sesha to Him and that one bas no other saviour than He. &ldquo;Growth&rsquo; means the adoption of the upaya resulting from &amp; knowledge of a particular thing that has to be performed as being suited to one&rsquo;s competency. &ldquo;To stand firm in Dvaya alone&rdquo; means to become well-established in this upāya and in the (know. ledge of the) fruit arising from it, without associating oneself with any other upāya and without any other end in view. Thus Tiru mantra and Dvaya combined together reveal the svarūpa, the upaya and the end for which the upaya is adopted.</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING THE UPAYA :</p>
<p>(4) In this construction of Tirumantra into two sentences, some consider that the whole of Tirumantra has, for its purport, the surrender of the self with its accessories. In that case, the m in praṇava should be considered to be in the dowioative or first case. By the principle of the offering of the havis (or oblation), Tirumantra would then mean &ldquo;This unconditional ofleriog, namely, the self or soul is surrendered to Narayana who is denoted by the letter a as His responsibility and who is the deity subject to no conditions or limiting factors (upādhi). In this unconditional sacrifice of the self, the word namas (nu mama) would come to mean that one dissociates oneself from oneself and says, &quot; The burden of my protection is not mine.&rdquo; As when (an offering is made) with the words: “This is for ladra and not wine&rdquo;, here also, the two sentences are essential; one to express the connection (of the offering) with the Supreme Being and the denial of its connection with oneself. Also in this surrender with the words namas (na mama), the purport may also extend to the denial of one&rsquo;s being an agent or doer absolutely independeat of the Supreme Being. The two sentences may also be considered to</p>
<p>400 CHAPTER</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>suggest the meaning; &ldquo;The burden of my protection is of no other (than Bhagavan) nor is it my own&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That Tirumantra has, for its purport, the offering or surrender of the self was stated in the Nitya as follows :- &ldquo;After offering the self to the deity with the moolamantra etc&rdquo; This idea is shows also in Sri Vaikunta Gadya as follows: &ldquo;Praying that Bhagavan should accept one for eternal service to Himself alone, one should prostrate oneself and offer the soul to Bhagavan with the utterance of the sacred moolamantra&rdquo;,</p>
<p>TWO SENTENCES INDICATING PURUSHĀRTHA:</p>
<p>(5) In each of the two sentences, some understand &amp; word (like syām) meaning &lsquo;I pray that etc&rsquo; or &lsquo;May I&rsquo; etc. (In that case the first sentence would be aum Nārāyaṇīya syām, and the second na mama syām), and their meanings would be:</p>
<p>“May I render service to Narayana denoted by the letter al May there be no hindrances to this!&rdquo; Tirumantra, 48 &amp; whole, would then be a prayer for the attainment of what is desired and the removal of all undesirable things and this is considered the supreme end. In that case the reflection on one&rsquo;s svarība is implicit in it. Similarly even when the Tirumantra is con. sidered to have, for its purport, only the indication of one&rsquo;s svarība, (as in the third meaning) it would, by suggestion or implication, indicate the specific end to be attained. The upaya and the prayer would then be known from the respective pramānas</p>
<p>which ordain prapatti.</p>
<p>It is often said that Tirumantra has, for its purport, the knowledge of svarūpa, of upāya and of purushārtha, because a knowledge of these which did not exist before is acquired from it. The knowledge of these is prāpya (to be acquired) and the Tiru mantra from which this knowledge arises may therefore be said to be prāpyapara (i.c.) to bave, for its purport, the knowledge of these three. But the expression prapyapara does not mean that</p>
<ol start="80">
<li>Sri Ramanuja: Nitya</li>
</ol>
<p>29</p>
<p>TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>401</p>
<p>Tirumantra has, for its denotation, this knowledge. It denotes the svarūpa, upāya and purushartha and not the knowledge of these which afterwards arises from it. (For example: the word *cow&rsquo; denotes the animal called &lsquo;cow&rsquo;; but when the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; is employed, we got also a knowledge of the cow. From this we should not say that the word &lsquo;cow&rsquo; denotes the knowledge of the cow. It denotes only the cow though, subsequently, the knowledge also arises. To put it in other words, the denotation of the word and the items of knowledge which may arise when the word is employed are two different things. &lsquo;Cow&rsquo; and knowledge of the cow&rsquo; are two different things.</p>
<p>THREE SENTENCES:</p>
<p>When Tirumantra is considered as consisting of three. sentences (there are several ways of understanding the meaning:) (6) &amp; (7) The svarūpa or essential nature (of the jiva) and his sapreme goal (purushārtha) are stated by the words themselves and the upāya is implicit in the meaning (though not expressed by the words); (8) or the svarūpa and the upāya are stated by the words themselves and the purushārtha is implicit in the meaning: (9) or the upaya and the purushārtha are stated by the words themselves and the svarüpa is implicit in the meaning (10) or the svarīipa, the upāya and the purushārtha ( all the three) are stated (distinctly) by the words themselves.</p>
<p>(6) If it be asked how this is, the answer is as follows: The first two words indicate svarüpa and the third word purushirtha.</p>
<p>As stated in the following sloka : I am&rdquo; the property (s&rsquo;esha)</p>
<p>na mama of only Bhagavan who is denoted by the letter a; I do not exist for myself : He who is depoted by the word &lsquo;Narayana&rsquo;, which means the person whose abode or dwelling place is the multitude of the etermal nārās (i.e.) jivas &mdash; To Him the varied forms of service which I should reader in virtue of my nature should 81. Ashtasloki: 3.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p>SRINAD RAHASYATRAYASARA</p>
<p>CHAPTRR</p>
<p>appear (to me) in all places and in all states&rdquo;. (as stated in this s&rsquo;loka ), the prasava and the nainas clarify the svarīpa ; and the third word Nārāya tāya with the predicate understood (Damely syām) is &amp; prayer for the attainment of the goal, in view of the idea of existing for Bhagavan expressed (already) by the pranava. The form of the prayer would be “May I be for Narayana!&quot; In this view, the prayer for the removal of hindrances (to s&rsquo;eshatva) results from the meaning (and not from the words themselves, because the attainment of the purushārtha is impossi. ble without the remov.sl of hindrances). As stated in the Dvaya and in such passages as &ldquo;ThouRlA shalt enjoy thyself on the slopes of the hills in the company of Sita&rdquo;, since the one to whom service is due has a spouse, the meaning would here also be, “May I be for Narayana as well as for Lakshmi!&quot;. If the predicate be needed, &amp; word like bhaveyain (May I be) should be understood. This prayer has indeed bsea made in such forins as the following:&ndash; “May I sørender faultless service remaining with Bhagavan con. stantly in all places and in all states.&quot; &ldquo;Vouchsafe upto ine Thy grace so that I may render service to Thee&rdquo;. &ldquo;I pray bor eternal service to Thee&rdquo; and &quot; I should be * Thy eternal servant,&quot;</p>
<p>“Existing for His sake&rsquo; is eleraal; so there is no need to pray for it; this relationship of existing for His sake (as His s&rsquo;esha) is already expressed by the prapava. Therefore prayer is inide bere for service (to Bhagavan), which is the overflow of the full and perfect enjoyment of Bhagavan and which contains within itself all other ends of life as in the colomon saying: &ldquo;Io the ocean is a Bin all puddle (i.e.) the larger contains the smaller within it)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKAS:&mdash;</p>
<p>Here in the dative or fourth case ( in the word Nārāyaṇāya ), although the jiva expects his owa guia (namely, the attuipment of bis purushārtha ), yet it ends in the Master gaining pleasure or 81A. Ramayana : Ayodhyakanda:31 • 27. 84. Sri Ramanuja : Siria Gadya. 82. Tiruvoymozbi: 3-3-2,</p>

<p>delight. (Therefore there is no violation of the proper function of the, s&rsquo;esha). (Likewise) desiring that the Master should gain conduces also to one&rsquo;s own bliss or ananda.</p>
<p>&quot; Whether it is said, &ldquo;I beg for service which would please Thee&rdquo; or &quot; Thou shouldst find delight in having my service&quot; - iD either case, both are gainers&quot;. (This is the idea). It has been said:-&quot; Food Mis of two kiads, that which has three qualities and that which has six qualities: That which hast three qualities is for those bound by karma; the other is for others&quot;. Here the food with six qualities is the enjoyment of the (six) qualities of Bhagavan and also the different kinds of service which result from them and wbich are most enjoyable.</p>
<p>(In the Brahma Stitras) it is said that since the srutis indicate that there would be perfect resemblance or equality (bhoga mātra sāmya) only in regard to enjoyment between Brahman and the mukta, the perfect equality is only in enjoyment and in jnana or ko wledge. Therefore there is nothing (in the srutis or the sūtras) opposed to the mukta being a sesha (to Bhagavan) which pertains to his e34 atial nature (svarīpa) and, as a result thereof, rendering service (kainkarya) to Him. It has been explained in Sri Bhashya and elsewhere that when, in the state of aspiriog to mukti and in the state of mukti, the jiva ineditates on his being Brahman, what is meant is that this contemplation is only in virtue of the self or jīva being the body of Bhagavad. Therefore this notion of &ldquo;I am Brahnan&rdquo; is indeed the result of the body (here the self or jiva) being dependent on the inner self (Bhagavan ) and existing only for the fulfilment of His purposes. (Therefore there is no impropriety in the self being sesha to Bhagavan even in the state of mukti ). The service that is rendered in the state of release or mukti comes from the very pature of the self: it is free from the pairs of* opposites, constant and un-intermittent, and produces 86. Lakshmi tantram.</p>

<p>unlimited delight. In the state of aspiration to mukti (mumukshu) the service that is rendered for its own sake is due to the circon. stance or upadhi of some good karma done in the past; it has to andare the pairs of opposites (dvandva ) such as heat and cold sod pleasare and pain; it is interrupted by sleep and other such (hindrances) and the delight arising therefrom is limited.</p>
<p>Here all activities of the jiva which do not form the service of Bhagaven and which do not fit ia with His commands will yield adverse results of some kind or other. Among those activities which are permitted by Bhagavan, those which are for the purpose of attaining svarga, cows and the lik: will yield fruits which may appear to be pleasant but which are miagled with many undesirable elements. Therefore they are, for that reason, bindrances. So, as stated in the s-loka : &ldquo;Oaer should give up the performance of those actions which are aimed at attaining the three ends, namely, dharma, wealth (artha) and pleasure (kāma),&rdquo; the aspirant to mukti may perform those rites or actions in relation to Bhagavan which are the means of securing bhakti and jnana and also of promoting the glory of Bhagavan and of Bhagavatas without caring for any other fruit. Since these rites or actions are not productive of life in samsāra, they would be included in the proper form of service, The state of being a s&rsquo;esha to Bhagavan indicated in the pranava extends to that of being a sesha to His devotees in so far as laid down in the pramānas, as a consequence of the jiva&rsquo;s absolute subjection to and sole existence for Hiin, which are indicated appropriately by the word namas.</p>
<p>So tbe kainkarya or service to Bhagavad which is desired in the word Nārāyaṇāya extends to His devotees. This idea is expressed in such slokas as the following :- &ldquo;I am greatly pleased with those wbo bave devotion towards my devotees. Therefore one should bouqur them greatly&rdquo;, and. “Therefore in order to obtain the grace of Bhagavan, one should please His</p>

<p>SERVICE TO BHAGAVATAS</p>

<p>devotees. By this the Lord becomes heartily inclined to show His grace. There is no doubt of this &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The saying that “dependence upon others isA miserable&rdquo; means (only) that the dependence on the worthless, which is due to past karına and which is not suited to one&rsquo;s svarvpa, is the cause of misery. Being subject to the will of) Bbagavan and tadiyas is the prescribed goal suited to one who realises the essential nature of his self and it is therefore the cause of unsurpassed delight. &ldquo;Tadiyas&rdquo; or &lsquo;Bhagavatas&rsquo; means those who feel a delight in heing the servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are some who maintain that service to His devotees (tadiyas) logically follows when one desires to serve Narayana who his for His attribute Nārās, for service to the substantive in Nāriņām a yanam iaclides (they say) service to Narūnām (all nārās ) which is the adjective or attribute. (If the logic of this s&rsquo;atement that what is prescribed for the substantive should be coosidered as prescribed also for its adjective or attribute, (in other words ), if being the attribute is itself the cause (of being honoured and served), then every thing that is denoted by the word Nārās here, such as Brahina and the other gods, the enemies of Bhaga van, cattle and the like, would coine under those to whone service shonld be desired. If it is said, “He desires to serve mea&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;, it does not follow that he desires to serve men also who are the adjectives of the sovereign (in the phrase &lsquo;men&rsquo;s sovereign&quot;), So also, by mere logic, the desire to serve Nārās will not become proved. (That will require pramilas for proof). Therefore only this much can be said:- By the authority of the pramānas, since the aspirant desires to do what is pleasing to the Master, he desires to serve those who are dear to Hun and who realise that they are His s&rsquo;eshas and have no other interests in life. Even in the experience of the state of mukti, the experience of everything else indicated by the word Nara which is included in the experience or enjoyment of Bhagavan - even this is not understood from (the) logic (of the adjective and the substantive ). It is understood from 89 A. Manusmriti : 4 - 160.</p>
<p>406 OH APTER</p>
<p>the authority of the pramana, (namely the sruti wbich says &quot; He sees all, and attains all things&quot;.</p>
<p>So far the Tirumantra was construed as having three sentences among which the first two were held as indicating the svarzpa of the jīva and the third as indicating the prayer for the attainment of the purushārtha or goal aimed at.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Different from this is the construction of Tirumantra into three sentences of which the pranava brings out the svarūpa or essential nature, namas forms the prayer for the removal of hindrances or evils, and the purushartha which will result from that renewal is indicated in Nārāyarāya syāın (&ldquo;May I be for Narayana !&rdquo;) That the namas in Tirumantra too, like the namas in Dvaya has, as its parport, the prayer for the removal of hindrances - this interpretation, too, is explained in Bhattar&rsquo;s Nitya in the slokas: “As stated in the pranava, I am the sesha of Bbagayan; in spite of it, I wily subdued by the notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and Mine&rsquo; owing to (my) past karma. The word namas states that, hereafter, I should reinember my being sesha tu Bhagavan and render service to klim&quot;. Therefore the syntactical con struction becomes in this interpretation): Ahain na mama syam &ldquo;I sball not be my owa sesha or na mama kinchit syat&rdquo; &ldquo;May I have no hindrances&rsquo;&rdquo; Sy.iin or Syiłt being understood. So it amounts to a prayer for tha complete removal of all hindrances such as avidyż or ignorance, karma, the impressions left by them (vāsanas), the taste or inclination (ruchi) and the association with prakriti or inatter. This has been shown in the passage in Vedārthasangraha, where it is said. &quot; Owing to beginningless avidyā or ignorance, two kinds of karını, good and evil (pulya and pāpa) have been floving like a stream. Oa accjunt of this, the jīva becomes enclosed in bodies of four kinds: Brabina und the other gods, men, anivaals and plants. So in accordance with the notion entertained by the jiva regarding his nature, the streain of samsāra increases in its volume. In order to get rid of the fear caused by it which is hard to resist etc.” So also it ia said,</li>
</ol>
<p>27</p>
<p>TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>&quot; In ordersA to protect the souls of samsārins whose nature is such that they have false notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; about the body, bad ways of life due to these (false notions) and the impure body which results therefrom, the Lord of the Nityasuris was born into all sorts of castes and species &ldquo;.</p>
<p>It may be asked :-&rdquo; When &amp; prayer has been made for the removal of hindrances, where is the need for another prayer for the attainment of the desired end? Will it not follow as a natural consequence? Hlas it not been said: “When the jīva attaingas Brabman, those qualities or attributes of his which are natural to him and which were, till now, bidden begin to shine forth. This is revealed by the word Svena in the sruti&quot;. &ldquo;In the same way as the brightness or radiance of &amp; gem is not produced (anew) but is a natural consequence of washing away the dirt covering it), so also jnana or knowledge is not produced in the soul (anew). When a tank or a well is dug, the water and the ether (space) are not created but siviply come into prominence (having already been there). It is only what already exists that is manifested clearly, How can there be the production of a thing which did not exist ? So also on the removal of uodesirable or evil qualities, qualities like koowledge begin to shine forth. They are not created anew, for these qualities are eternal in the jiva (since they belong to his essential nature) &ldquo;?</p>
<p>The answer to this question may be expressed as follows :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son begs of bis father for his share of the property, though it is lawfully his. In the same way the servant (the jiva) who has offended (the Master) begs of the Supreme Being tbat be should be peripitted to render service &ldquo;. There is nothing inappro. priate in the jiva who has lost what he is entitled to, praying thus:&ndash; “May I have what is my sbarel Be Thou so gracious en to pardon my offence;&rdquo;</p>

<ol start="91">
<li>Vishau Dharma: 104 - (55 - 57). 90. Brahma Sutras: 4.4.1.</li>
</ol>
<p>408 CHAPTER</p>
<p>From the passages quoted above, it would appear also that just 28 when the bindrance is removed the radiance Datural to the gem begins to shine by the will of God, as stated io.&rdquo; All thingsøla exist as such only by T&rsquo;hy will&rdquo;, so also such things as the expansion of jriina which naturally belong to the Jiva, are wapifested as a result of the Lord&rsquo;s will, wbich is of the form of the compassion Datural to Him.</p>
<p>But it may be asked: &ldquo;In a (*)system of thought which bolds that the non-existence (of a thing) weaps the presence of some other tbing, the n boval of hiudraoces should, by itself, be the attainment of wbat is desired. Hence will out the separate prayer for it be redundant? Besides bas not the author of Sri Bhashya declared: “The disappearance of avidyā (literally, igaorance; karma ) is itself moksha&rdquo;?</p>
<p>(NOTE (*): Vísishtadvaitins hold thi t the non-cxistence (of a thing) is simply the existence of some other thing and not a category apart. For example, when we say, &ldquo;There is no pot on the floor&rsquo;, the non-existence of the pot is merely the existence of the floor. Tarkikas hold, on the oth:r hanj, that pon-existence or the absence of a thiny (abhava) should be considered as a separate category ).</p>
<p>To that question the answer is as follows: - For the sake of some purpose, a single thing may be indicated (in two ways), in its essential nature (svarūpa) and also in a form that is opposed to it So (here ), it is called the attainment of what is desired and the disappearance of what is not desired, because of the intention to signify &amp; special purpose. In the state of samsāra, the dis. appearance of something that is undesirable way be another undesirable thing or the disappearance of what is desired and what is not desirable alike. But in the state of moksha, since every thing (without exception) that is undesirable disappears, wbal remains is all agreeable So the two (the disappearance of the undesirable and the attainment of what is desired) were stated separately in order to show, with great regard, that the former state (samsāra) is most undesirable and the latter most desirable, since it</p>
<p>91A. Sri Vaikuntasatvan: 36.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>TEN MEANINGS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>409</p>
<p>(is free from all undesirable elements and) bas only what is desir able. Further the two have to be stated separately, since the withdrawal of punishment by Bhagavan and such things as the expansion of the jiva&rsquo;s knowledge are different things. It is not improper to pray separately for these two things since the remission of punishment by God which is the cause of the contraction of knowledge and the like is different from such things as the expan. sion of knowledge, service and the like wbich results from the disappearance of the contraction of knowledge, service and the like, which were the results of that punishment ?</p>
<p>There is also another reason for two separate prayers - In some other systems of thought (like that of the Türkikas), moksha means the disappearance of all undesirable things and the attain. ment of a state similar to that of a stone (with no positive content in the forni of enjoyment or bliss). In order to show that moksha in our system is not of that kind, bat has &amp; positive content of enjoyment or bliss, the two are stated as being separate and also to show that in the attainmeot of Bhagavan (in mukti), there is no such thing as an alloy of misery or pain just as there is in attaining such states as the position of Indra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus if it is held that the svarīipa and the prayer are expressed explicitly by the words themselves, the upaya prescribed by the süstras, for the attainment of the end in view (purushārtha) nouuely, the sādhyopāya, is implicit in the meaning of namas which states the disappearance of undesirable things in the case of the inan destitute of all other upāyas as a result of bharanyāsa.</p>
<p>(8) SVARÜPA AND UPÃYA :</p>
<p>Since the prayer for the purushārtha is not a mere desire but the soliciting of a protector, the anga and other accessories may be considered also as implicit and not expressed. The Tirumantra would then mainly indicate the svarüpa and upāya. If we split Narayana into nārāņām uyanam yena &ldquo;He by whom He becomse</p>
<p>410 CHAPTER</p>
<p>the resting place of nārās (the world of jivas), the word ayana may be considered also as indicating the upaya, for He is the upaya.</p>
<p>(9) UPAYA AND PURUSHARTHA :</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA</p>
<p>Some acharyas considered that, as in the order in which these are expressed in Dvaya and in the charama sloka, bere, in Tiru mantra also, the pra lava (tāram) expresses bharanyāsa or the surrend&rsquo;r of the respoosibility of protection and that the other two words namas and Nárāyaṇāya express the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>(10) THREE SENTENCES INDICATING RESPECTIVELY</p>
<p>SVARŪPA, U PĀYA AND PURUSHĀRTHA</p>
<p>Tirumantra may be consi lered also as stating all the three, viz., svaripa, upaya and purushārtha io that order. In this case the prajava states the svarüpa or essential nature of the jiva (as Bhagavad&rsquo;s s&rsquo;esha), the namas states the upāya and what remains (i.c.) Nārāya līya states the prayer for the purushārtha or the attainment of the end in view.</p>
<p>The details concerning these three should be understood by a study of the Vedanta stāstras. The construction or interpretation given above of Tiruinantra has resemblances to the order in which the tattva, the upaya and the purushārtha are explained in the Vedantha sāstras. Does not that sasira proceed in this way? Jo the first two chapters (adhyāyas) (of the Brahma sītras), the Supreme Real (Brahman) and the reals subordinate to it are determined. In the third chapter, competency (adhikāra) and accessories (angas) are stated along with the upāya and in the fourth chapter, the fruit or the attainment of the goal is explained by way of conclusion. The essential Dature of the Supreme Real and that of the lower reals explained in the first two chapters (adhyāyas ) and the fruit or goal of attainnuent explained in the fourth are the same for the inan wbo has adopted prapatti ag te</p>

<p>411</p>
<p>direct and independent means or upāya. The shortcomings and sufferings in samsara which are dealt with in the sections (pada) on Vairagya and Ubhayalinga in the third chapter and the Redeemer&rsquo;s being opposed to all that is of the nature of blemish Theya) and His being the sole possessor of all auspicious qualities &mdash; these, too, must necessarily be understood by tbe prapanna who is 20 aspirant to mukti. The different forms of meditation or worship (upāsana) of Brabman, which are treated of in the third section (pada) of the third chapter (of the Brahma sütras ), should be adopted by those who are competent for them (i.e.) those who have adopted bhakti. The man who is not competent for them and who is destitute of other upāyas should realise that these forms of meditation are too bigh for him and adopt siyāşa as bis upāya. For, as stated in the following sub-sections:- Nānā sabdadi bhedāt (Brahma sutras 3-3-56) (The forms of meditation or worship or vidyās concerning Brahman) are different from one another, for their names are different and vikalpah avisishta phalatvat (3&mdash;3&ndash;57). (Any one of them may be adopted as there is no difference in the resulting fruit). Nyasa is different from the other vidyas and in yielding the fruit conferred by them, does not require any other aid. The man who has adopted upāsana (or bhakti) should perform the rights and duties pertaining to his varna (caste) and āsrama (stage of life) as an accessory or anga to the vidya or form of meditation as stated in Brahma Sutras (3.4.33) * The man who practises bhakti should perform the duties of his varna and asrama as an anga to bhakti.&rdquo; The nan who has adopted prapatti as a direct and independent upāya should perforın these rites and duties as having been enjoined by Bhagavan and for *heir own sake (without expecting any gain or reward), for it is said in the Brahma Stitras (3.4 - 32). “Since they are enjoined, yajnas and other rites become the duties of the (respective) ūsramas&rdquo;. If this is understood the, svarūpa, upaya and puru. shartha which are explained in the Sārīraka Sastras (Brahma sūtras) are all to be found within the sacred Ashtūkshara. We have already explained how the five truths that ought to be understood may be found in thie. (Chap. 4). он APTER</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF THE TEN INTERPRETATIONS OF</p>
<p>TIRUMANTRA GIVEN ABOVE:</p>
<p>Thus the acharyas consider Tirumantra, which has in. bumerable meanings within it, as having ten (different) meanings in accordance with their respective tradition: When the Tirumantra is considered as a siogle sentence, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature (svartipa) of the jiva and (2) his activity as &amp; s&rsquo;esha. When coosidered as two sentences, it is thought of as indicating (1) the essential nature of the self and (2) the surrender (of the self) by a positive and a negative state. ment, Damely, (The burden of protecting me is Bhagavan&rsquo;s : it is not mine) and so also (3) as indicating &amp; prayer for the puru. shūrtha. When it is considered as three sentences, it is thought of in the following ways:- (1) The first two words indicate the svarīpa and the third word indicates the prayer: (2) The pranava indicates the essential nature or svarūpa, and the other two words indicate the prayer for the removal of undesirable elements and for the attaioment of the desired end. (3) In the same manner, the first word indicates the svarīžpa and the other two indicate the upāya, (4) the first word indicates the surrender (of the self) and the other two indicate the prayer for the attain. ment of the fruit ( desired), (5) The three words indicate res.. pectively the tattva, the upaya and the purushārtha.</p>
<p>When some of these meanings are considered as the main interpretations, the others, too, should be looked upon as being implicit in the meaning, though not expressed explicitly by the words thenselves.</p>
<p>SL.VSKRIT SLOKAS :</p>
<p>Therefore by the interpretations of the words and the sentences tbus taught (to us) by the acharyas, who have realised the truth, other interpretations stated by those who are outside the pale of Vedic religion and by beretics (within that fold) have been rejected.</p>

<p>THE GREATNESS OF ASHTAKSHARA</p>
<p>413</p>
<p>The man who has attained a clear and sure koowledge of Tirumantra which cannot be shaken by those outside the pale of Vedic religion and by heretics &ndash; that man has been described as follows in the siloka :- &ldquo;He has &ldquo;nouated the (top most) storey of the palace of the knowledge of Tirumantra and bas obtained freedom from all anxiety (about bimself). The wise man looks down (from there) at ignorant people suffering for lack of this knowledge, like a man on the top of a mountain looking at people standing below (it)&rdquo;. The knowledge referred to in the following sloka : &ldquo;Food, &ldquo;sleep, ear and sex are common both to animals and to men. The superiority of men to animals consists in their possession of koowledge. Those who are without knowledge are like animals&rdquo;-the koowledge referred to here is this clear and sure kaowledge. (The man who has this knowledge) will never be moved or troubled by praise or censure as stated in the sloka : &quot; Here he is called &amp; wise man (pandita) who like the (unsullied) waters in the depths of the Ganga will never feel elated by praise or pained by censure&rdquo;. &ldquo;In the land where the man who has a true knowledge of Tiru. mantra and who stands firmly in its meditation, is honoured, there will be po disease, no famine and no fear of robbers&rdquo;. As stated in this sloka : No such evil will occur there. It has been stated by those who are proficient in Ayurveda : “Adoration® to that unique physician who killed, without exception, all diseases like rāga (desire) which are chronic, which lie spread over all parts of the body and which cause feverish activity, ignorance, dissatisf&amp;c. tion (with everything)&rdquo;. The sloka quoted above really means, in accordance with the above statement in Vāgbhataın, that in the land where a knowledge of Tirumantra is honoured) there will be no such priacipal diseases as rāgu or desire, no contraction of knowledge, for koowledge has been described as wealth or Sri and no such great robbers as those who steal the self which cannot be</p>

<p>OTHER VYĀPAKA MANTRAS</p>
<p>The ideas contained in the other Vyapaka mantras which contain the words (Vishnu and Vasudeva), namely Namo Vishnavi preceded by pranava and namo Bhagavate Vasudevāya prece. ded by praňava are just those which have been declared as existing in Tirumantra. As interpreted by Ahirbudhnya such qualities 48 pervasiveness, splendour, entrance (into all) or immanence and will, wbich are deduced from the respective verbal roots are additional qualities in the Supreme Being, Vishon and decisive of His being the Supreme Deity&quot;. The meanings of the word &ldquo;Vishnu” as derived from the root Vish which means &ldquo;to pervade, &lsquo;vas&rsquo; which means to &lsquo;shine&rsquo;, vis . which means &rsquo;to enter&rdquo; and ish which means &rsquo;to will&rsquo; and so also the meanings of the Vasudeva derived from vasati, vasayati, which mean respectively, &ldquo;He dwells within all&rdquo; and &lsquo;He makes all dwell within Himself&rdquo; and Divyati which means &lsquo;shines&rsquo;, from which follow His being the support of all, His being free from any taint due to contact with them, His sportive activity, and His will to conquer - all these meanings are contained in parts of the word “ Narayana&quot;.</p>
<p>As stated in the sloka : “Whatever* a man ought to know is all contained in Ashtakshara, that is, the Vedas viz., Rik, Yajus, Saman and so also Atharvan and other collections of words,&quot; as stated therein, this Ashtakshara is, by itself, the revelation of all that is desired by the aspir: nt to mukli, in relation to the tattva (Truth) and hita (the means or upaya for reaching the goal). A single utterence of it is equal to frequent repetitions of all the vedas, for it has been said, &ldquo;Whatever fruit is gained by those who repeat the Rik, Yajus and Sama Vedas many times &ndash; that fruit is gained by the man who utters the Ashtakshara mantra</p>

<p>only once. A single utterance of this mantra is equal to &amp; repetition of all the Vedas. Though, as stated in the sloka: &ldquo;In proportion to the faith that &amp; inan has in the Moolamantra does ho attain the ends he desires, it is impossible to estimate adequately its great Dess&rdquo; (though, as stated in the sloka), there are degrees of success varying in accordance with the degrees of faith, the potency (of the mantra) is boundless (incapable of being measured) in the case of those who have great and intense faith (mahā visvāsa ) in it. Since in that sloka (100) it is not specifically stated by whom it is impossible to measure its potency, it may be inferred that even Narayana who propagated this mantra, who is the subject of this mantra and who is, by nature, omniscient and who incarnated 49 Nara and Narayana and propagated (by precept and practice) the Scripture without letting it become extinct-that even Narayana koows that its potency is pot capable of being measured. Tiru. mangai Alvar who wis initiated into tbis mantra and its meaning by the seer of this mantra (Bhagavaal, who is also its deity, has declared as follows:- &ldquo;If thou shouldst, with the help of the mantra of eight letters, always enjoy Bhagavan, who appears at the end of the Vedas which form the wealth of Brahmins, thon shalt be happy.&rdquo; TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Those wise men with eight qualities who meditate on the mantra of eight letters which treats of Bhagavan who is possessed of eight qualities and who created the eight-bodied (Rudra), the eight-eyed (Brahma), the sight quarters and their eight guardians, the eight prakritis, and the eight great mountains-these wise inen have, within their (easy) reach, the eight great flowers, the eight siddhis or super-natural powers, the eight kinds of bhakti or devotion, the eight angas or accessories of yoga, the eight kinds of wealth, the eight great qualities, tho eight times eight arts or kalas and the rasa or emotional state or sentiment which is beyond the eight rasas, namely, the emotional state called sānti or serenity of spirit. 100.
