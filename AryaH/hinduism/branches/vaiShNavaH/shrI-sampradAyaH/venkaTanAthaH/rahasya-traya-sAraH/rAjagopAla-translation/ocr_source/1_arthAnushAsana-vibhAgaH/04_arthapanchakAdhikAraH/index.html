<li>THE CHAPTER ON THE FIVE THINGS THAT</li>
</ol>
<p>SHOULD BE KNOWN TO EVERY SEEKER</p>
<p>AFTER SALVATION.</p>
<p>SANSKRIT SLOKA:</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; in Om and in the word &lsquo;Narāyaṇa&rsquo; occurring in Ashtakṣara, the supreme end of life (i.e.) Bhagavan, who is opposed to all that is objectionable or faulty, is indicated; in the in in om and in the part nāra occurring in Nārāyaṇāya, the essential natare (svarūpa) of the jiva who is to attain this end is dis</p>
<p>(siddha upāya) namely, Bhagavan, is indicated in the part ayance occurring in Nārāyana and the means to be accomplished or adopted (sādhya upāya ), which is self-surrender, is in namas; the fruit desired, viz., the enjoyment of Brabman which includes also service to Him is disclosed in the dative or fourth case in Nārāyaṇāya; the bindrance to it, namely, the feeling of &lsquo;mine&rsquo; is in the word mama occurring in sramah (na mama ). He who understands the Ashtākṣara mantra that reveals all these five and *Dvayam too, which is to the same effect&ndash;he will be consi dered by all as one who knows everything.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO SPEAK OF FIVE THINGS AND THOSE</p>
<p>WHO SPEAK OF SIX.</p>
<p>In the words Nārāyana and in on, the relationship between Īśvara and the jiva is revealed as that between the soul and the body. Having taken this relationship as the foundation or basis of the Viśiṣṭādvaita system, some investigated the five truths that should be known to every one who desires mokṣa. Others took this relationship also as one of the things to be koown and hence spoke of the six things to be known. If it be asked what the five</p>
<p>NOTE:-* Dvayam may mean also the two (i.c.) Dvayam and charama</p>
<p>śloka,</p>
<p>THE FIVE THINGS TO BE KNOWN.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>things are that should be onderstood by the seeker after mokṣa along with tbe relationship itself, the answer is as follows: &ldquo;The patare&rsquo; of &ldquo;the end to be attained ” vis. Brahman, the nature of the individual self who is the seeker of the attainment, the means of attainment (upāya), the fruit resulting from it and so also the hindrances to the attainment of Brabman - all the Vedas with their (elucidatory) itihāsās and purānās speak of these five,&rdquo;</p>
<p>BRAHMAN, THE END TO BE ATTAINED:</p>
<p>ITS SVARĪPA:</p>
<p>Among these, the essential nature of Brabman, which is the object of attainment, is revealed in the first letter a in om and in the word &lsquo;Narāyaṇa&rsquo; in Tirumantra and in the words Nārāyana with the adjectives &lsquo;Srünün&rsquo; occurring in Duayam and in the words &lsquo;me&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; occurring in the Charama śloka. It is in this way that they should be considered. Wbile doing so, one should thiok of His essential nature (svarūpa) as infinite jñāna and infinite bliss ever inseparable from His consort, Lakṣmī, who, in every form and in all situations, participates in all His actions. For there are many authoritative passages in support of this prescribed contemplation -</p>
<p>“The Lord of the Universe is over with Lakṣmī in Vai. kunta, the world beyond” (Here the reference is to the Supreme Lord (Para) in Vaikuṇṭha.)</p>
<p>“This 3Narāyaṇa is always with Sri &ndash; Narāyaṇa whose abode is the ocean of milk. He has now come to the city of Madhura leaving His bed (Adiśeṣa)&rdquo; (The reference is here to the Vyüha) “Thou art the God Narāyaṇa, the spouse of Sri and hast the Chakra is Thy weapon and Thou art omnipresent&quot;. (The refe rence is to the Vibhava or avatāra.)</p>

<p>“ Bhagavan has the smole, Sri Vatsa, on His chest and Sri is with Him eternally.&quot; &ldquo;Lakṣmī is bever inseparable from Viṣṇu.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be (Laksbmana) 7said as follows to Rāma in the presence of Sita&rdquo;. (Here Sri is indicated as purushakāra). &ldquo;The renowned Lakṣmana spoke thus to Sita and to Rāma who had the great vow (of protecting His suppliants)&rdquo;. (Here Sri is indi cated in the state of Her being the upāya). “This Sita is capable of protecting this host of Rakṣasis from (the anger of) Raghava.&quot; (Here and in the next passage, Sri is indicated as the upāya) &ldquo;I will be to your protector&rdquo; ( Sita&rsquo;s words to the Raksbasis ). &ldquo;You will llenjoy yourself on the slopes of the hills with Sita and, whether you are asleep or awake, I will render service to you&rdquo; (8&amp;ys Lakṣmana): (Here is the prayer for the fruit, namely, kaina karya ). &ldquo;He is &rsquo; seated on the serpent Ananta ( Sesba), along</p>
<p>servant and thus find delight?&rdquo; (This is also prayer for service ). &ldquo;Thy &ldquo;spouse is Purushottama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Lord, &ldquo;who is along with Sri, is pleased by the service rendered to Him by the eternal Suris who delight in that service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worship as Viṣṇu with the inseparable Sri; He is the sea of purity and bliss&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The #beloved of Sri, who is infinite and whose form is the unique abode of all auspicious qualities &quot;</p>

<p>Goal, which is called Viṣṇu, is free from all imperfections.&rdquo; and &ldquo;He is greater than the great; in the Lord of the great and the low, there are no such things as pain.&rdquo; He is to be considered also as possessing all those qualities which are necessary for one who is the object of attainment and who is, likewise, the means of attainment. Many are the passages that speak of Bhagavan&rsquo;s qualities :</p>
<p>* Bear &ldquo;now of a man (Sri Rauna) possessed of these quali. ties&rdquo;.</p>
<p>* Him who his possessed of these geralities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“Him who *was possessed of such qualities and of irresistible valour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; There are so many poble qualities, O King, in your son.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;* Benevolence, compassion, learning, integrity of character. control of the senses, control of the mind these six qualities adorn Rāma, the best of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; He is known to be earnest in the matter of dharmu; He is affectionate to those that seek His protection.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou-ert scapable of affording protection and art also the refuge of all. This is declared by the divine sages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* Thou art the tree in which the good find their resting place; and Thou art the supreme refuge of all those who are in distress.**</p>
<p>&quot; He is the store-house of such qualities as splendour strength, lordship, great wisdom, sapreme valour and might.&quot;</p>
<p>* Is there any one that can comprehend the qualities of Viṣṇu, who is the inner self of all beings?&quot; &ldquo;My boy, just as the gems in the ocean are countless, the qualities of the Lord armed with Chakra are innumerable ; &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; His esqualities cannot be enumerated even in tens of thou. sands of yesis by even all the gods assembled together. If there be any man of pure mind anywhere, gifted with the period of life appointed for Brahma and if he be further endowed with a thousand mouths, he way be able, o best of gods, to enumerate one teo-thousandth fraction of Thy qualities or may bot be able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Though Thy &ldquo;qualities are infinite, yet six of them are fore most among them; even as the niverse is borne within thy body, the other qualities too, are contained within them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; It is * owing to the deficiency of arrows that the man who wishes to cover the sky desists and not owing to any deficiency in the space of the sky. (So also ) we fall back from the praise of Govinda, owing to our deficiency of intelligence and aot owing to any deficiency in His qualities.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has &ldquo;noble qualities like bliss, which are limitless in extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BHAGAVAN HAS A DIVINE AND AUSPICIOUS FORM:</p>
<p>Bhagavan should be thought of, also, es having a trans cendent, super sensuous (aprākrita), divide and auspicious form, which is the resting place (āsraya ) of the universe, for there are many passages which refer to this form of His</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Him whose form ever remains the same &ndash; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who has faith in His form that is eternal and in His being the Supreme Deity - him Bhagavan approaches soon, O Pauṣkara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Hari has another form entirely different from all forms seen in the universe, in which all these saktīs abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He &ldquo;assumes by His will a form that is immense and that is pleasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the pañcaratra Sastra (Bhagavat Sastra ), it is learnt that this form of the Lord is of five kinds (1) The Supreme (Para Vasudeva ), (2) Vyžiha (Vasudeva, Saṅkarshana, Ani. ruddba and Pradyumna), (3) Vibhava (avatārs like Rāma and Kr̥ṣṇa), (4) Hārda and (5) archa (images worshipped in temples).</p>
<p>Details concerning them may be learnt from the pañcaratra śāstra and from tradition. Bhagavan should also be considered as having endless glories or possessions (Vibhiti). For there are passages like the following which describe His vibhutis</p>

<p>These vibhūtis (possessions or glories) of God are of two kinds, sentient and non-sentient, and these again are of two kinds, some existing for His Lila or sport and others for His enjoyment (bhoga). This division into things for play (lila) and things for enjoyment (bhoga) is based on the difference in the rasa or delectation, though all of them have agreeableness (or ānukiilgan) in common. Bhagavan should be considered as being engaged in the work of the Universe merely for His play or sport (lila), for it has been said as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; From</p>
<p>whom</p>
<p>is the origin etc. of this world&quot;</p>

<p>THE FIVE THINGS TO BE KNOWN</p>
<p>* SUMMARY.</p>
<p>Thus Brahman, the object of attainment, is ever with Lakṣmī : He is infinite jñāna and infinite bliss, and is opposed to all that is imperfect and objectionable. He is possessed of countless auspicious qualities like wisdom and power. He has a celestial and transcendent form of auspicious nature. He has two vibhūtis (rula and nitya ) which are His body; He has, for His play or sport (lila), the work of creating the world, of maintaining and controlling it and the like.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL SELF:</p>
<p>Now for the individual self (Pratyak ātmā) which is to attain Brahman :</p>
<p>We should know that the in.lividual self is in three categories : Baddha or those who are in the bondage of sansürer, Mukta, or those who have attained release froin sainsāra and Nitya or those who are eternally free fron bondage. The seeker after salvation should also know the peculiar features which distinguish him as a seeker of the means of mukti, from other baddhas.</p>
<p>The baddhas (or the bound) are those caught up in the cycle of births and deaths owing to the stream of beginningless karma, They range from Brahma to the blade of grass and are called kṣetrajnāh. (Brabma, gods, men, beasts, trees, grass and so on ).</p>
<p>The muktās (or released souls) are those who, by adopting the means (upāya ) prescribed in the s&rsquo;āstrüs, have obtained the Lord&rsquo;s grace, permanently transcended the cycle of births and deaths, and have obtained unsurpassed bliss as a result of the uprestricted enjoyment of Bhagavan.</p>
<p>The nityās (the eternally free) are those whose knowledge has never undergone contraction and who are, in this respect, like</p>
<p>NOTE: This sumunarises Prapya (i.c.) the object of attainment, wiz. Brahman.42 CHAPTER</p>
<p>Īśvara Himself. &ldquo;They &quot; are.&rdquo;, it has been said, &quot; of the same age as the Lord, eternal and free fronı all trace of imperfections,&rdquo;</p>
<p>They have never been in saṁsāra and are engaged in eternal service to the Lord o.g. Adapta (i.e.) Adisesba, Garnda and Vish. vaksena.</p>
<p>The characteristic attributes common to all the three of them are being atomic (in size) (aṇu) and being of the nature of knowledge (jñāna), bliss (ānanda), purity (amalatvam) and the like. They are all śeṣas to Bhagavan and are entirely subject to His will. One should also understand what is distinctive and peculiar to one as a mumukṣu or seeker after salvation. This has been (already) mentioned in the Introductory Chapter and will be described later on also.</p>
<p>The essential nature of the jiva who seeks attainment should be thought of, while considering the letter in in om and in namas or namo in Tirumantra, and in the part nāra of the word Nārāyana, wherever it occurrs in the Ashtakṣara and the Dvayam, in the first person singular form &quot; I seek refuge&quot; prapadye in Duayain, in the second person singular of the word &quot; thyself&quot; in &ldquo;surrender thyself&rdquo; (vraja) and in the word thec (tva) and in the sentence &quot; despair not&quot; in the charamaśloka.</p>
<p>THE MEANS OF ATTAINMENT.</p>
<p>We will describe at length the means of attainment (upāya) and its auxiliaries and also the nature of the fruit to be attained in their proper context later.</p>
<p>Among these two, the upāya or means of attainment is to be considered as indicated in Tirumantra in the word namas or namo and in the part ayana (resting place). in Nārāyanāya ; n Duayam in the first part and in the Charama siloka in the first half.</p>

<p>THE FIVE TBINGS TO BE KNOWN</p>
<p>THE GOAL OF ATTAINMENT.</p>
<p>The Dature of the fruit to be attained or enjoyed is mentioned in the dative or fourth care (i.e) in Nārāyaṇāya in the Tiru mantra, in the word namah in the Dvaya, and in the charama</p>
<p>siloka in the words &ldquo;I will free thee from all sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE HINDRANCE TO ATTAINMENT,</p>
<p>The bindrances to the attainment are the multitude of obstacles that stand in the way of our attaining mokṣa, such as ignorance (avidyā), karma and vāsana or impression left in the mind by karma in previous births,</p>
<p>The foremost of these bindrances is the punishment ipflicted by Bhagavan for disobedience of His orders contionally from time immemorial. This chastisement causes association with prakr̥ti or matter with its three qualities (satva, rajas and tamas) and thereby contraction of knowledge. It brings about a connec tion between the soul on the one hand, and the body, the senses and the like which are specific modifications of matter (or prakr̥ti) on the other. Further it makes the jīva subject to the sway of the body and the senses. To quote the words of the Alwar, “With the &lsquo;strong ropes of my sins, Thou hast bound me tightly with the body, covered the sores within the body (like flesh, fat and blood) with the skin and let me walk away from Thee.&quot; &ldquo;With the body given by Thee at the time of creation, I have been wandering about to the satisfaction of the body.&rdquo; This chastisement often consists in placing the jiva in the body of animals which can have no knowledge of the Sāstras and cannot act in accordance with them. Even in births like those of men, it copfounds the mind with the views of infidels and heretics and, even in the case of those who escape this, causes, through the concealing agency of the peacock feather of primal matter (moola-prakr̥ti) and its modifications, the bodies and the senses, (1) ignorance</p>

</ol>
<p>of the truth and (2) erraneous knowledge and so also (3) sub. jection to sepse-pleasures. As Sri Rāmanuja says, &ldquo;This ** (association with matter) causes obscuration of a knowledge of the essential nature of Bhagavan and also false knowledge. Besides it makes the jiva think that tbis association is delightful.&rdquo; As &amp; consequence of this, it induces the jiva to disobey His orders and do forbidden things for the sake of petty pleasures. To quote again the words of the Alwar: &ldquo;Is it right on Thy part to confound my soul and excite my five senses by showing me, who am &amp; sinner, all sorts of petty pleasures?&rdquo; One act of disobedience leads to further acts of sin. Well has it been said, &ldquo;Sin &ldquo;committed again and again destroys wisdom and the man withoot wisdom begins further acts of a sinful nature.&rdquo; In consequence the Lord makes the jiva wander again and again through the cycle of life in the womb, birth, old age, death, and bell, as stated by Himself, &ldquo;I throw them always into asuric births&rdquo; By means of the scriptures of those who are actuated by rajas and tamas, which show the way to secure petty pleasures, the jiva is made to fall at the feet of petty deities who are themselves souls ( kṣetrajna) fettered with similar cbains. “Those who are actuated by rajas&rdquo; it has been declared, “worship gakṣas and Rakṣasas ; and those who are actuated by tamas worship the spirits of the dead and elemental spirits ( Bhūtagana)&quot;. The jiva is deloded into considering bimself as greatly benefited by the mean and gruesome enjoyments afforded by these deities in the same way as worms find a pleasure in dirt and filth.</p>
<p>Even those who practise yoga are made to practise it in con. Dection with petty deities or in the meditations of such inanimate</p>

<p>things as *nāma being Brahman and are made to fall therefrom in the acquisition of minor results. Even those who are devoted to the soul or ātmā are made to meditate on their ātmā either in contact with matter or as separated from matter either as if it were Brahman or as the atma in its own essential datore. As the regolt of these four kinds of meditation, the jiva obtains petty enjoyments after which he falls back into saṁsāra. Even in the case of those who practise trae meditation on Brabman, and who meditate prima. rily on their own selves as having Brahman for their inner self or who think primarily of Brabman who has for His body their own selves - even they may be detained by the state of kaivalya or the enjoyment of their own selves, by the attainment of the It eight kiods of siddhi, by the attainment of the status of the vasus, or by the entrance into the body of Brahma and the like. Their (temporary) lapse from the highest aim or goal of life (namely, the enjoyment of the bliss of Brahman) is like that of &amp; prince, whose coronation day has been already fixed, casting eyes on the servant maids who attended on hini while in prison. They are made to linger fondly over the body and the senses which are tbe result of past karma and those that are related to the body (like relatives) and the enjoyments connected with them. In this way they become subject to other pleasures than the final goal. Thus there are many forms of hindrance in the way of the attainment of Bhagavan. When a well thirty-two steps wide has to be leaped over, it makes no difference whether the man falls at the very first step or at the thirty-second step. In the same way wherever or at whatever stage the bindrance occurs, the jiva has not transcended samsūra,</p>
<p>* NOTE:- In the Chandogya Upaniṣad VII chapter, it is stated as follows:- *He who worships nama or names like rig veda, sama veda, Itihasa and purāṇa as if they were Brabman will realise only very limited fruits such as can be reached with these namos&quot;.</p>
<p>** NOTE: The eight kinds of siddhi: Anima (contraction of one&rsquo;s body to the size of an atom, mahima (assuming a huge form) Laghima (makiog one&rsquo;s body light) Garima (making the body heavy), vasitvam (mastery over self), aisvar yam (lordship) prapti the power of obtaining whatever one wants and prakamyam (perfect froedom of the will.)</p>
<p>46 CHAPTER</p>
<p>It is true the Gītā says that for those who practise skarnia. yoga, the effort will never porish or be in vain. What has been built up will, of course, remain built up, as it were, of stone, But we cannot say when the fruit will be attained, whether at the end of a kalpa or of a manvantaru or of a yuga. Even sages like Vasiabta, who ever acted in such a manner as to please God, had to wait long. Those who acted against the will of God like Vritra and Kshatrabandhu attained mokṣa without any such delay. So it is difficult to say which individuals have done meritorious deeds that would lead to mokṣa without delay. Similarly it is difficult to state who have done bad deeds leading to divine chastisement causing delay.</p>
<p>SARAŅĀGATI THE ONLY MEANS OF GETTING RID OF</p>
<p>THESE HINDRANCES:</p>
<p>How can this chief hindrance which is of the nature of divine panishment resulting from disobedience of the Lord&rsquo;s commands and which is the root cause of this chain of suffering-how can this be removed? The author of Sri Bhashya (Sri Rāmanaja) has declared that the only remedy for this bindrance is to obtain the favour of the Lord and that this can be done only by Saraṇāgati or self-surrender to the &amp;Lord. This declaration is made by him, while commenting on the order in which the senses, the mind and the like have to be controlled as stated in Kata Upaniṣad.</p>
<p>All these bindrances to mokṣa are to be understood in whatever is contrary to what is ordained in the three mysteries (mantras) (e. g. the feeling that the jiva is independent and acts for bis own purposes which is opposed to the truths shown in the Ashtakṣara), in the egoism, or sense of &lsquo;my&rsquo; or &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in the genitive mama in nanah (na + mama) and also in the words all thy sing&rsquo; in the charama śloka. These have to be thought of, 80 that ope inay feel the suffering which lies in walking on the bot</p>

<p>THE FIVE THINGS TO BE KNOWN</p>
<p>sands of saṁsāra and desire to hasten towards the path leading to bliss.</p>
<p>TAMIL VERSE:</p>
<p>Those who know these five have declared them in order that I may not despair in mind and in order that the darkness of igno rance may not confound me- the five namely - the Lord of the lotus-born Lakṣmī, who stands as the one thing to be attained, the jiva who loves the lord and craves for His grace by seeking His feet, the means (or upüya) to be adopted by the jiva for the attainment, and the fruit resulting therefrom, as also the strong fetters of sin due to delusion or ignorance (which are bindrances).</p>
<p>SANSKRIT VERSE:</p>
<p>That which is to be attained is the Supreme Brahman who is the s&rsquo;eshi of all; I am also a fit person to attain Him; the attain. ment should come to me as inheritance due naturally to me as to</p>
<p>the Suris; alas, by ny egoism and the ignorance arising from it, I have lost it, but I have been taught that, by surrendering myself to the divine couple who are my s&rsquo;eshis, I can now attain it.</p>
